'''Afrin Canton''' ({{lang-ku|Kantona Efrînê}}, {{lang-ar|مقاطعة عفرين}}, {{lang-syc|ܦܠܩܐ ܕܥܦܪܝܢ|translit=Pelqo d'Afrin}}) was one of the cantons of the de facto autonomous [[Democratic Federation of Northern Syria]] (DFNS). [[Syria]]'s [[Afrin District]] fell under the control of the [[People's Protection Units]] (YPG) around 2012 and an "Afrin Canton" (now [[Afrin Region]]) was declared in 2014. Afrin Canton in its latest form was established in 2017, however, as part of the reorganisation of the DFNS' subdivisions. With [[Afrin, Syria|Afrin]] as its administrative centre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://civiroglu.net/the-constitution-of-the-rojava-cantons/|title=The Constitution of the Rojava Cantons; Personal Website of Mutlu Civiroglu|publisher=civiroglu.net|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the canton was part of the larger [[Afrin Region]]. As a result of the Turkish-led [[Operation Olive Branch]] in early 2018, Afrin Canton became part of the [[Turkish occupation of Northern Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://syria.liveuamap.com/en/2018/17-march-ypg-start-retreating-from-afrin-city-center-after|title=YPG start retreating from Afrin city center after they abandoned and burned their headquarters in the city|publisher=syria.liveuamap.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/report-turkey-backed-forces-push-into-syrian-town-of-afrin/2018/03/18/1c87b1fa-2a82-11e8-a227-fd2b009466bc_story.html|title=Turkey’s forces capture Syrian Kurdish town of Afrin|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
Afrin is the furthest west and most mountainous part of Aleppo Governorate. It consists of southern part of the [[Kurd Mountains]]. Afrîn Canton is bordered by the de facto [[Shahba Canton]] to the east, [[Kilis Province]] of [[Turkey]] to the north and [[Hatay Province]] of [[Turkey]] to the west, [[Al-Dana Nahiyah]] of the [[Harem District]] of [[Idlib Governorate|Idlib]] and [[Mount Simeon District]] of [[Aleppo Governorate]]s of [[Syria]] to the south.

== Demographics ==
The population of the Afrin Canton area was overwhelmingly ethnic [[Kurds in Syria|Kurdish]], to the degree that the canton had been described as "homogeneously Kurdish".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rojava's Sustainability and the YPG's Regional Strategy|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/rojavas-sustainability-and-the-pkks-regional-strategy|work=Washington Institute|date=2 August 2016|accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall population of Afrin Canton, based on the 2004 Syrian census, was about 200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssyr.sy/General%20census/census%202004/pop-man.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208115353/http://www.cbssyr.sy/General%20census/census%202004/pop-man.pdf |archivedate=2015-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cities and towns with more than 10.000 inhabitants according to the 2004 Syrian census are [[Afrin, Syria|Afrin]] (36,562) and [[Jandairis]] (13,661).

Throughout the course of the [[Syrian Civil War]], Afrin Canton served a safe haven for inbound refugees of all ethnicities, fleeing violence and destruction from civil war factions, in particular the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) and the diverse more or less [[Islamism|Islamist]] rebel groups of the [[Syrian opposition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serious allegations against the Turkish government|url=https://www.gfbv.de/en/news/ankara-inhumane-treatment-of-refugees-7891/|work=Gesellschaft für bedrohte Völker|date=2 August 2016|accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1,150 emigrants enter Afrin canton|url=http://en.hawarnews.com/1150-emigrants-enter-afrin-canton/|publisher=[[Hawar News Agency]]|date=18 October 2016|accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a June 2016 estimate from the International Middle East Peace Research Center, about 316,000 displaced Syrians of Kurdish, [[Yazidi]], [[Arab]] and [[Syrian Turkmen|Turkmen]] ethnicity lived in Afrin Canton at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Will Afrin be the next Kobani?|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/06/turkey-syria-afrin-under-refugee-siege.html|publisher=Al-Monitor|date=9 June 2016|accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Rojava conflict}}

According to [[René Dussaud]], the area of Kurd-Dagh and the plain near [[Antioch]] were settled by Kurds since antiquity.&lt;ref name=dussaud&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dussaud|first1=René|title= Topographie historique de la Syrie antique et médiévale|year=1927|publisher=Geuthner|pages=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A People Without a Country: The Kurds and Kurdistan|last=Chaliand|first=Gérard|publisher=Zed Books|year=1993|isbn=9781856491945|location=|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stefan Sperl says that there is a reason to believe that Kurdish settlements in the [[Kurd Mountains]] go back to the [[Seleucid]] era, since those regions stood in the path to [[Antioch]]; Kurds in the early periods served as mercenaries and mounted archers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kreyenbroek|first1=P.G.|last2=Sperl|first2=S.|title= The Kurds: A Contemporary Overview|year=1992|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=JZ6JAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415072654|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the Kurd Mountains were already Kurdish-inhabited when the [[Crusades]] broke out at the end of the 11th century.&lt;ref name=sperl&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kreyenbroek|first1=P.G.|last2=Sperl|first2=S.|title= The Kurds: A Contemporary Overview|year=1992|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415072654|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area around Afrin, today's Afrin Canton, over the centuries developed as the center of a distinctive [[Sufism|Sufi]] "Kurdish Islam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jordi |last=Tejel |url=http://www.kurdipedia.org/books/74488.pdf |format=PDF |title=Syria's kurds history, politics and society |year=2009 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-203-89211-9 |pages=100–101 |edition=1. publ. |author2=Welle, Jane |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001038/http://www.kurdipedia.org/books/74488.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern post-independence Syria, the Kurdish society of the canton was subject to heavy-handed [[Arabization]] policies by the Damascus government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SYRIA: The Silenced Kurds; Vol. 8, No. 4(E)|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1996/Syria.htm|website=Human Rights Watch|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of the [[Syrian Civil War]], Damascus government forces pulled back from the canton in spring 2012 to give way to autonomous self-administration within the [[Rojava]] framework, which was formally declared on 29 January 2014, and the territory of Afrin Canton has virtually never seen civil war combat.&lt;ref name=schmiedinger&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newsdeeply.com/syria/community/2016/02/24/afrin-and-the-race-for-the-azaz-corridor|title=Afrin and the Race for the Azaz Corridor|author=Thomas Schmidinger|publisher=Newsdeeply|date=24 February 2016|accessdate=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has however at various times been the target of artillery shelling by [[Islamism|Islamist]] rebel groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aranews.net/2015/08/nusra-militants-shell-kurdish-areas-in-syrias-afrin-kurds-respond/|title=Nusra militants shell Kurdish areas in Syria’s Afrin, Kurds respond|publisher=ARA News|date=30 August 2015|accessdate=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=50392|title=Turkish forces shell Afrin countryside, killing and injuring about 16 most of them from the self-defense forces and Asayish|publisher=SOHR|date=9 July 2016|accessdate=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schmiedinger /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aranews.net/2016/02/turkey-bombs-kurdish-city-of-afrin-northern-syria-civilian-casualties-reported/|title=Turkey strikes Kurdish city of Afrin northern Syria, civilian casualties reported|publisher=ARA News|date=19 February 2016|accessdate=2016-10-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103054447/http://aranews.net/2016/02/turkey-bombs-kurdish-city-of-afrin-northern-syria-civilian-casualties-reported/|archive-date=2016-11-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Russian military troops had reportedly stationed themselves in Afrin as part of an agreement to protect the YPG from further Turkish attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US and Russian military units patrol Kurdish-controlled areas in northern Syria|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/pictures-us-russian-military-units-patrol-kurdish-controlled-areas-northern-syria/|agency=Al-Masdar|date=May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afrin Canton was captured by the [[Turkish Land Forces]] and [[Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army]] as result of [[Operation Olive Branch]] from January to March 2018. Many civilians and officials fled from Afrin City before its capture by Turkish-led troops on 18 March 2018, and the YPG vowed to retake it. The YPG consequently announced its intention to start a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerilla war]] in Afrin Canton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Al Jazeera|title=Syrian civilians flee embattled Eastern Ghouta and Afrin|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/syrian-civilians-flee-embattled-eastern-ghouta-afrin-180316160255579.html|website=Al Jazeera|publisher=Al Jazeera Media Network|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/11-killed-bomb-blast-syrias-afrin-falls-pro-turkish-forces-428752063 |title=11 killed in bomb blast as Syria's Afrin falls to pro-Turkish forces |author= |work=[[Middle East Eye]] |date=19 March 2018 |accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aleppo soap 01.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Aleppo soap]]

A diverse agricultural production was at the heart of the Afrin Canton's economy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Afrin is building its economy on agriculture|url=http://en.hawarnews.com/afrin-is-building-its-economy-on-agriculture/|publisher=[[Hawar News Agency]]|date=8 August 2016|accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; traditionally olives in particular, and more recently there was a focus on increasing wheat production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agriculture Commission is Looking at the Process of Receiving Wheat from Farmers|url=http://cantonafrin.com/en/news/view/1123.agriculture-commission-is-looking-at-the-process-of-receiving-wheat-from-farmers.html|website=Afrin Canton|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A well-known product from the area is [[Aleppo soap]], a hard soap made from olive oil and lye, distinguished by the inclusion of laurel oil. While Afrin Canton has been the source of olive oil for Aleppo soap since antiquity, the destruction caused by the Syrian Civil War to other parts of [[Aleppo governorate]] increasingly made the entire production chains locate in Afrin Canton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Famous Aleppo soap victim of Syria's conflict|url=http://www.yourmiddleeast.com/features/famous-aleppo-soap-victim-of-syrias-conflict_9985|work=YourMiddleEast|date=4 October 2012|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Will Syria's Kurds succeed at self-sufficiency?|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/04/kurdish-areas-norther-syria-economy-self-sufficiency.html|publisher=Al-Monitor|date=3 May 2016|accessdate=6 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508233809/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/04/kurdish-areas-norther-syria-economy-self-sufficiency.html|archive-date=2016-05-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of the fighting for Aleppo, up to 50 percent of the city's industrial production was moved to Afrin Canton.&lt;ref name=sufficiency&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/04/kurdish-areas-norther-syria-economy-self-sufficiency.html|title=Will Syria's Kurds succeed at self-sufficiency?|publisher=Al-Monitor|date=3 May 2016|access-date=2018-01-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508233809/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/04/kurdish-areas-norther-syria-economy-self-sufficiency.html|archive-date=2016-05-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of early 2016, two million pairs of jeans were produced per month and exported across Syria.&lt;ref name=sufficiency/&gt; In January 2017, 400 textile industry workshops counted 17,000 employees, supplying the whole of Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cooperativeeconomy.info/rojava-the-economic-branches-in-detail/|title=Rojava: The Economic Branches in Detail|work=cooperativeeconomy.info|date=14 January 2017|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tourism ===
{{further|Tourism in Syria}}

Afrin District also served as center for domestic tourism due to its beautiful landscapes. Syrians continued to travel to the region for recreational purposes after the formation of Afrin Region, and later Afrin Canton. The tourism was however somewhat constricted due to the YPG's tight control of the borders, and the war; local tourism mostly collapsed during the Turkish invasion of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/07/picnickers-return-to-afrin.html |title=Day trippers flock to Afrin's orchards as Aleppo restores security |author=Khaled al-Khateb |work=[[al-Monitor]] |date=26 July 2018 |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Education in Syria|Rojava#Education, media, culture}}

Like in the other Rojava canton, primary education in the public schools is initially by mother tongue instruction either Kurdish or Arabic, with the aim of [[Multilingualism|bilingualism]] in Kurdish and Arabic in secondary schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://anfenglish.com/culture/education-in-rojava-after-the-revolution|title=Education in Rojava after the revolution|publisher=ANF|date=2016-05-16|accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/11/syria-kurdistan-self-governance-teach-kurdish-language.html|title=After 52-year ban, Syrian Kurds now taught Kurdish in schools|publisher=Al-Monitor|date=2015-11-06|accessdate=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curricula are a topic of continuous debate between the canton' Boards of Education and the Syrian central government in Damascus, which partly pays the teachers.&lt;ref name=syriaclanguage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://syrianobserver.com/EN/News/31729/Hassakeh_Syriac_Language_Be_Taught_PYD_controlled_Schools/|title=Hassakeh: Syriac Language to Be Taught in PYD-controlled Schools|publisher=The Syrian Observer|date=3 October 2016|accessdate=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new-compass.net/articles/revolutionary-education-rojava|title=Revolutionary Education in Rojava|publisher=New Compass|date=2015-02-17|accessdate=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aranews.net/2015/10/kurds-introduce-own-curriculum-at-schools-of-rojava-2/|title=Kurds introduce own curriculum at schools of Rojava|publisher=Ara News|date=2015-10-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606071936/http://aranews.net/2015/10/kurds-introduce-own-curriculum-at-schools-of-rojava-2/|archive-date=6 June 2017|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal, regional and local administrations in Rojava put much emphasis on promoting libraries and educational centers, to facilitate learning and social and artistic activities.&lt;ref name=k24education&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurdistan24.net/en/news/dfa4b335-fe1c-4a3c-b5b6-7bc5848e9e97/Kurds-establish-university-in-Rojava-amid-Syrian-instability|title=Kurds establish university in Rojava amid Syrian instability|publisher=Kurdistan24|date=2016-07-07|accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afrin Canton has one institution of higher education, the [[University of Afrin]], founded in 2015. After teaching three programs (Electromechanical Engineering, Kurdish Literature and Economy) in the first academic year, the second academic year with an increased 22 professors and 250 students has three additional programs (Human Medicine, Journalism and Agricultural Engineering).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.hawarnews.com/afrin-university-is-opened-today/|title=Afrin University is opened today|publisher=[[Hawar News Agency]]|date=9 October 2016|accessdate=2016-10-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018171102/http://en.hawarnews.com/afrin-university-is-opened-today/|archive-date=2016-10-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apamea Cibotus''', '''Apamea ad Maeandrum''' (on the [[Maeander]]), '''Apamea''' or '''Apameia''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀπάμεια}}, {{lang-grc| κιβωτός}}) was an ancient city in [[Anatolia]] founded in the 3rd century BC by [[Antiochus I Soter]], who named it after his mother [[Apama]]. It was in Hellenistic [[Phrygia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/858373/Apamea-Cibotus Encyclopædia Britannica, "Apamea Cibotus"]&lt;/ref&gt; but became part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Pisidia]].&lt;ref name=Lequien/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pius Bonifacius Gams, [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=65154&amp;dirids=1 ''Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae''], Leipzig 1931, p.&amp;nbsp;451&lt;/ref&gt; It was near, but on lower ground than, [[Celaenae]] (Kelainai).

==Geography==
The site is now partly occupied by the city of ''[[Dinar (District), Afyonkarahisar|Dinar]]'' (sometimes locally known also as ''Geyikler'', "the gazelles," perhaps from a tradition of the Persian hunting-park, seen by [[Xenophon]] at Celaenae), which by 1911 was connected with [[İzmir]] by railway; there are considerable remains, including a theater and a great number of important [[Graeco-Roman]] inscriptions.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Apamea|display=Apamea s.v. 2|volume=2|page=159|first=David George|last=Hogarth|authorlink=David George Hogarth}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Strabo]] (p.&amp;nbsp;577) says, that the town lies at the source (ekbolais) of the [[Marsyas]], and the river flows through the middle of the city, having its origin in the city, and being carried down to the suburbs with a violent and precipitous current it joins the [[Maeander]] after the latter is joined by the [[Orgas]] (called the Catarrhactes by [[Herodotus]], vii. 26).

==History==
The original inhabitants were residents of Celaenae who were compelled by Antiochus I Soter to move farther down the river, where they founded the city of Apamea (Strabo, xii. 577). [[Antiochus the Great]] transplanted many [[Jewish people|Jews]] there. (Josephus, ''Ant.'' xii. 3, § 4). It became a seat of [[Seleucid]] power, and a center of Graeco-Roman and [[Graeco-Hebrew]] civilization and commerce. There [[Antiochus the Great]] collected the army with which he met the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] at [[Battle of Magnesia|Magnesia]], and two years later the [[Treaty of Apamea]] between Rome and the Seleucid realm was signed there. After Antiochus' departure for the East, Apamea lapsed to the [[Pergamon|Pergamene]] kingdom and thence to [[Rome]] in 133 BCE, but it was resold to [[Mithridates V of Pontus]], who held it till 120 BCE. After the [[Mithridatic Wars]] it became and remained a great center for trade, largely carried on by resident [[Italian people|Italians]] and by Jews.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; By order of Flaccus, a large amount of Jewish money &amp;ndash; nearly 45 [[kilograms]] of gold &amp;ndash; intended for the Temple in Jerusalem was confiscated in Apamea in the year 62 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''Pro Flacco'', ch. xxviii.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 84 BCE [[Sulla]] made it the seat of a ''[[conventus]]'', and it long claimed primacy among Phrygian cities.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; When Strabo wrote, Apamea was a place of great trade in the Roman [[Asia (Roman province)|province of Asia]], next in importance to [[Ephesus]]. Its commerce was owing to its position on the great road to [[Cappadocia]], and it was also the center of other roads. When Cicero was [[proconsul]] of [[Cilicia]], 51 BCE, Apamea was within his jurisdiction (''ad Fam.'' xiii. 67), but the dioecesis, or conventus, of Apamea was afterwards attached to Asia. [[Pliny the Elder]] enumerates six towns which belonged to the conventus of Apamea, and he observes that there were nine others of little note.
[[File:The Open court (1887) (14786963093).jpg|thumb|right|coin of Kibotos]]The city minted its own coins in antiquity.  The name [[Kibotos|Cibotus]] appears on some coins of Apamea, and it has been conjectured that it was so called from the wealth that was collected in this great emporium; for kibôtos in Greek is a chest or coffer. Pliny (v. 29) says that it was first Celaenae, then Cibotus, and then Apamea; which cannot be quite correct, because Celaenae was a different place from Apamea, though near it. But there may have been a place on the site of Apamea, which was called Cibotus.

The country about Apamea has been shaken by earthquakes, one of which is recorded as having happened in the time of [[Claudius]] ([[Tacitus|Tacit.]] ''Ann. '' xii. 58); and on this occasion the payment of taxes to the Romans was remitted for five years. [[Nicolaus of Damascus]] (''Athen. '' p.&amp;nbsp;332) records a violent earthquake at Apamea at a previous date, during the [[Mithridatic Wars]]: lakes appeared where none were before, and rivers and springs; and many which existed before disappeared. Strabo (p.&amp;nbsp;579) speaks of this great catastrophe, and of other convulsions at an earlier period.

[[File:Kibotos 1096.jpg|thumb|right|[[Battle of Kibitos]], [[13th century|13C]] manuscript]]Apamea continued to be a prosperous town under the [[Roman Empire]]. Its decline dates from the local disorganization of the empire in the 3rd century; and though a [[Diocese|bishopric]], it was not an important military or commercial center in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times. The [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] took it first in 1080, and from the late 13th century onwards it was always in [[Muslim]] hands. For a long period it was one of the greatest cities of [[Asia Minor]], commanding the Maeander road; but when the trade routes were diverted to [[Constantinople]] it rapidly declined, and its ruin was completed by an earthquake.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===Apamea in Jewish tradition===
Apamea is mentioned in the [[Talmud]].  The passages relating to witchcraft in Apamea (Ber. 62a) and to a dream in Apamea (Niddah, 30b) probably refer to the Apamea in Phrygia which was looked upon as a fabulously distant habitation. Similarly the much-discussed passage, Yeb. 115b, which treats of the journey of the exilarch Isaac, should also be interpreted to mean a journey from [[Corduene]] to Apamea in Phrygia; for if [[Apamea (Babylonia)|Apamea in Mesene]] were meant (Brüll's ''Jahrb.'' x. 145) it is quite impossible that the [[Babylonia]]ns should have had any difficulty in identifying the body of such a distinguished personage.

===Christian Apamea===
Apamea Cibotus is enumerated by [[Hierocles (author of Synecdemus)|Hierocles]] among the [[Diocese|episcopal cities]] of the [[Roman province]] of [[Pisidia]]. [[Lequien]] gives the names of nine of its bishops. The first is a Julianus of Apamea at the Maeander who, [[Eusebius]] records, was in about 253 reported by [[Alexander of Hierapolis (Phrygia)]] to have joined others in examining the claims of the [[Montanism|Montanist]] [[Maximilla]]. The list of bishops from Pisidia who participated in the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) includes Tharsitius of Apamea. It also gives a Paulus of Apamea, but Lequien considers that in the latter case "Apamea" is a mistake for "Acmonia". A Bishop Theodulus of Apamea (who may, however, have been of Apamea in Bithynia) witnessed a will of [[Gregory of Nazianzus]]. Paulinus took part in the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451) and was a signatory of the letter from the bishops of Pisidia to Emperor [[Leo I the Thracian]] concerning the killing in 457 of [[Proterius of Alexandria]]. In the early 6th century, Conon abandoned his bishopric of Apamea in Phrygia and became a military leader in a rebellion against [[Emperor Anastasius]]. The acts of the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] (553) were signed by "John by the mercy of God bishop of the city of Apamea in the province of Pisidia". Sisinnius of Apamea was one of the Pisidian bishops at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] (787). The [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox)|Council held at Constantinople in 879–880]] was attended by two bishops of Apamea in Pisidia, one appointed by [[Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople]] the other by [[Photios I of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=Lequien&gt;Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0agp0mJFG_sC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. I, coll. 1045-1046&lt;/ref&gt;

Since it is no longer a residential diocese, Apamea Cibotus is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 834&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Armorica.png|thumb|300px|The Roman geographical area of Armorica. The Seine and the Loire are marked in red.]]'''Armorica''' or '''Aremorica''' is the name given in ancient times to the part of [[Gaul]] between the [[Seine]] and the [[Loire]] that includes the [[Brittany]] [[Peninsula]], extending inland to an indeterminate point and down the Atlantic Coast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Aremorica ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary'', ''s.v.'' "Aremorica"]; [http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/Aremorica ''The Free Dictionary'', ''s.v.'' "Aremorica"].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[toponymy|toponym]] is based on the Gaulish phrase ''are-mori'' "on/at [the] sea", made into the Gaulish place name ''Aremorica'' (''*are-mor-ika'') "Place by the Sea". The suffix ''-ika'' was first used to create [[adjective|adjectival forms]] and then names (see regions such as [[Pays d'Ouche]] from ''Utica'' and [[Perche]] from ''Pertica''). The original designation was vague, including a large part of what became [[Normandy]] in the 10th century and, in some interpretations, the whole of the coast down to the [[Garonne]]. Later, the term became restricted to Brittany.

In [[Breton language|Breton]], which belongs to the [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic]] branch of the [[Insular Celtic languages]], along with [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Cornish language|Cornish]], "on [the] sea" is ''war vor'' (Welsh ''ar fôr'', "f" being voiced and pronounced like English "v"), but the older form ''arvor'' is used to refer to the coastal regions of Brittany, in contrast to ''argoad'' (''ar'' "on/at", ''coad'' "forest" [Welsh ''ar goed'' or ''coed'' "trees"]) for the inland regions.&lt;ref&gt;The Irish form is ''ar mhuir'', the Manx is ''er vooir'' and the Scottish form ''air mhuir''. However, in those languages, the phrase means "on the sea", as opposed to ''ar thír'' or ''ar thalamh/ar thalúin'' (''er heer/er haloo'', ''air thìr/air thalamh'') "on the land".&lt;/ref&gt; The cognate modern usages suggest that the Romans first contacted coastal people in the inland region and assumed that the regional name ''Aremorica'' referred to the whole area, both coastal and inland.

== History ==
[[Image:Britonia6hcentury.png|thumb|right|200px|Map of Briton settlements in the 6th-century, including what became Brittany and [[Britonia]] (in Spain).]]
[[Pliny the Elder]], in his ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]'' (4.17.105), claims that Armorica was the older name for ''[[Aquitaine|Aquitania]]'' and states Armorica's southern boundary extended to the [[Pyrenees]]. Taking into account the Gaulish origin of the name, that is perfectly correct and logical, as Aremorica is not a country name but a word that describes a type of geographical region, one that is by the sea. Pliny lists the following [[Celtic tribe]]s as living in the area: the [[Aedui]] and [[Carnuteni]] as having treaties with [[Rome]]; the [[Meaux|Meldi]] and [[Segusiavi|Secusiani]] as having some measure of independence; and the [[Boii]], [[Senones]], [[Aulerci]] (both the [[Eburovices]] and [[Cenomani]]), the [[Parisii (Gaul)|Parisii]], [[Tricasses]], [[Andicavi]], [[Viducasses]], [[Baiocasses|Bodiocasses]], [[Veneti (Gaul)|Veneti]], [[Coriosolites|Coriosvelites]], [[Diablinti]], [[Rhedones]], [[Turones]], and the [[Etusiati|Atseui]].

Trade between Armorica and Britain, described by [[Diodorus Siculus]] and implied by Pliny&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-compass.com/images/store/HICO/chapters/523.pdf History Compass : Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419084640/http://www.history-compass.com/images/store/HICO/chapters/523.pdf |date=April 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was long-established. Because, even after the campaign of [[Publius Licinius Crassus (son of triumvir)|Publius Crassus]] in 57 BC, continued resistance to Roman rule in Armorica was still being supported by Celtic aristocrats in [[Roman Britain|Britain]], [[Julius Caesar]] led two invasions of Britain in 55 and 54 in response. Some hint of the complicated cultural web that bound Armorica and the Britanniae (the "Britains" of Pliny) is given by Caesar when he describes [[Diviciacus (Suessiones)|Diviciacus]] of the [[Suessiones]], as "the most powerful ruler in the whole of Gaul, who had control not only over a large area of this region but also of Britain"&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''[[De Bello Gallico]]'' ii.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological sites along the south coast of England, notably at [[Hengistbury Head]], show connections with Armorica as far east as the [[Solent]]. This 'prehistoric' connection of Cornwall and Brittany set the stage for the link that continued into the medieval era. Still farther East, however, the typical Continental connections of the Britannic coast were with the lower Seine valley instead.

Archaeology has not yet been as enlightening in Iron-Age Armorica as the coinage, which has been surveyed by [[Philip de Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;"Coinage in Iron Age Armorica", ''Studies in Celtic Coinage'', 2 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Roman Empire]], Armorica was administered as part of the province of [[Gallia Lugdunensis]], which had its capital in [[Lugdunum]], (modern day [[Lyon]]). When the [[Roman province]]s were reorganized in the 4th century, Armorica (''[[Tractus Armoricanus et Nervicanus]]'') was placed under the second and third divisions of Lugdunensis. After the legions retreated from Britannia (407) the local elite there expelled the civilian magistrates in the following year; Armorica too rebelled in the 430s and again in the 440s, throwing out the ruling officials, as the Romano-Britons had done. At the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]] in 451 a Roman coalition led by General [[Flavius Aetius]] and the Visigothic King [[Theodoric I]] clashed violently with the Hunnic alliance commanded by King [[Attila the Hun]]. [[Jordanes]] lists Aëtius' allies as including Armoricans and other Celtic or German tribes (Getica 36.191).

The "Armorican" peninsula came to be settled with [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] from Britain during the poorly documented period of the 5th-7th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Fleuriot's primarily linguistic researches in ''Les Origines de la Bretagne'', emphasizes instead the broader influx of Britons into Roman Gaul that preceded the fifth-century collapse of Roman power.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in distant Byzantium [[Procopius]] heard tales of migrations to the Frankish mainland from the island, largely legendary for him, of ''[[Brittia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius, in ''History of the Wars'', viii, 20, 6-14.&lt;/ref&gt; These settlers, whether refugees or not, made the presence felt of their coherent groups in the naming of the westernmost, Atlantic-facing provinces of Armorica, [[Cornouaille]] ("[[Cornwall]]") and [[Domnonée|Domnonea]] ("[[Devon]]").&lt;ref&gt;K. Jackson, ''Language and History in Early Britain'' Edinburgh, 1953:14f.&lt;/ref&gt; These settlements are associated with leaders like Saints [[Samson of Dol]] and [[Pol Aurelian]], among the "founder saints" of Brittany.

The linguistic origins of [[Breton (language)|Breton]] are clear: it is a [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic language]] descended from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] [[British language (Celtic)|British language]], like [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Cornish language|Cornish]] one of the [[Insular Celtic languages]], brought by these migrating Britons. Still, questions of the relations between the Celtic ''cultures'' of Britain&amp;mdash; [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]]&amp;mdash; and Celtic [[Breton language|Breton]] are far from settled. Martin Henig (2003) suggests that in Armorica as in [[sub-Roman Britain]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;There was a fair amount of creation of identity in the [[migration period]]. We know that the mixed, but largely British and Frankish population of Kent repackaged themselves as '[[Jutes]]', and the largely British populations in the lands east of Dumnonia (Devon and Cornwall) seem to have ended up as 'West Saxons'. In western Armorica the small elite which managed to impose an identity on the population happened to be British rather than 'Gallo-Roman' in origin, so they became Bretons. The process may have been essentially the same."
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba72/book.shtml. [[Martin Henig]], ''British Archaeology'', 2003, review of ''The British Settlement of Brittany'' by Pierre-Roland Giot, Philippe Guigon &amp; Bernard Merdrignac]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; According to [[C.E.V. Nixon]], the collapse of Roman power and the depredations of the [[Visigoths]] led Armorica to act "like a magnet to peasants, ''coloni'', slaves and the hard-pressed" who deserted other Roman territories, further weakening them.&lt;ref&gt;C.E.V. Nixon, "Relations Between Visigoths and Romans in Fifth Century Gaul", in John Drinkwater, Hugh Elton (eds) ''Fifth-Century Gaul: A Crisis of Identity?'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vikings]] settled in the [[Cotentin]] peninsula and the lower Seine around [[Rouen]] in the ninth and early tenth centuries, and these regions came to be known as ''[[Normandy]]'', the name ''Armorica'' fell out of use in the area. With western Armorica having already evolved into ''[[Brittany]]'', the east was recast from a [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish]] viewpoint as the ''Breton March'' under a Frankish [[marquis]].

==In popular culture==

The home village of the fictional comic-book hero [[Asterix]] was located in Armorica during the [[Roman Republic]]; there, "indomitable Gauls" hold out against Rome. The unnamed village was reported as having been discovered by archaeologists in a spoof article in the British ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper on [[April Fool's Day]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | last = Keys | first = David | title = Asterix's home village is uncovered in France: Archaeological dig reveals fortified Iron Age settlement on 10-acre site | publisher = The Independent | date = 1 April 1993 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/asterixs-home-village-is-uncovered-in-france-archaeological-dig-reveals-fortified-iron-age-settlement-on-10acre-site-1452580.html | accessdate = 17 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''North Armorica'' is mentioned in the first sentence of [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.

Armorica is featured extensively in [[Bernard Cornwell]]'s novel ''[[The Winter King (novel)|The Winter King]]'', where Ynys Trebes, later [[Mont Saint Michel]], is besieged and destroyed by the Franks.

In ''[[The Farfarers: Before the Norse]]'',&lt;ref name="Farley"&gt;{{cite book | last = Mowat | first = Farley | authorlink = Farley Mowat | title = [[The Farfarers: Before the Norse]] | publisher = Key Porter Books, Limited | isbn = 978-1-883642-56-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Farley Mowat]] speculated that Armorica was the origin of the [[Albans]], who fled from Romans to Britain and Orkney and later fled from Norse, discovering Iceland, Greenland, [[Ungava Peninsula]], Quebec and Newfoundland.

The protagonist, Mathurin Kerbouchard, of [[Louis L'Amour]]'s ''[[The Walking Drum]]'' is a native of Brittany and extensively references the culture of Armorica in the 12th century.

Armorica is the home country of Felix in Juliet Marillier's "Seer of Sevenwaters", the 5th book in the Sevenwaters series.

A '''backroad''' is a secondary type of road, usually found in [[rural area]]s.

In North Carolina, where they are also referred to as "blue roads", the roads are often constructed of [[gravel]], and are one or two-laned roads off larger roads such as [[parkway]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheila Turnage]] and Jim Hargan, ''Compass American Guides North Carolina', (Edition 5, Random House, 2009) {{ISBN|1-4000-0904-9}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4000-0904-6}}, p. 273, found at [https://books.google.com/books?id=YMh0jIfmxToC&amp;pg=PA273&amp;dq=%22Blue+Roads%22&amp;lr=&amp;cd=81#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Blue%20Roads%22&amp;f=false Google Books].  Accessed February 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Vermont]], the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] has established a Better Backroads program to help towns and organizations deal with road-related [[soil erosion]] problems through grants. Both paved and unpaved backroads are eligible for these grants, which seek to protect water quality from sediment accumulation caused by road and ditch erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vt.nrcs.usda.gov/rc&amp;d/bbcoverpage.html |title=Better Back Roads |author=Vermont [[Natural Resources Conservation Service|NRCS]] |date= |work=Official website |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |accessdate=17 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304140156/http://www.vt.nrcs.usda.gov/rc%26d/bbcoverpage.html |archivedate=4 March 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many back-roads in [[North Carolina]] were created when the states rural transportation system began investing for factories to located outside of urban areas and into rural areas. This created a system of back-roads that allowed for factories to disperse away from busy urban areas. This was done in the late 1940's under Governor [[W. Kerr Scott|Kerr Scott]] where investment began and was known as the states rural [[Farm-to-market road|farm-to-market]] road system. The idea for the farm-to-market road system was to connect farms out in rural areas to the markets in which they sold there produce, this would allow for easy transportation for those who transported there goods to market places. Ultimately these types of roads became state highways or nice quality roads however, the importance of there beginnings is that they began as rural back-roads for agricultural purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=Tyler Gray|date=2018-05-07|title=Farm to Factory: Secondary Road Building and the Rural Industrial Geography of Post–World War II North Carolina|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/692618|journal=Journal of Southern History|language=en|volume=84|issue=2|pages=277–310|doi=10.1353/soh.2018.0086|issn=2325-6893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Backroad Safety ==
Back roads, sometimes called rural roads are known to be unsafe. Back-roads usually have a fatality rate of about two and a half times more than any other road in the United States. A study done in 2015 by TRIP a National Transportation Research Group found that back-roads have a traffic fatality rate of 2.18 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, whereas all roads combined in the United States have a traffic fatality rate of 0.38 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled. Back-roads contribute to 22% of total amount of vehicle miles traveled in the United States, but make up 43% (15,132) of the total amount of vehicle collisions in 2015 (35,092). In 2015 Texas had the highest number of rural non interstate traffic deaths at 1,259 and California in second with 1,219 deaths&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tripnet.org|title=TRIP|website=www.tripnet.org|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Back roads are known to have features that make them less safe then a highway, some of the features that are seen in back-roads are narrow lanes, limited shoulders, sharp curves, pavement drop offs, steep slopes, and limited clear zones along roadsides. Given that the majority of back roads were built early in american history, they were often designed with different widths and height restrictions, this makes for unsafe road conditions for modern vehicles and trucks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tripnet.org|title=TRIP|website=www.tripnet.org|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A '''Catena''' in soil science ([[pedology (soil study)|pedology]]) is a series of distinct but co-evolving soils arrayed a slope.[5] Each soil type or "facet" differs somewhat from its neighbours, but all occur in the same climate and on the same underlying parent material. A mature catena is in equilibrium as the processes of deposition and erosion are in balance.

== The catena concept ==
The catena concept originated in Central [[Uganda]], by chemist W.S. Martin [3] to describe a hill slope sequence at the Bukalasa research station. The term catena (Latin: chain) was first coined by scientist Geoffrey Milne to describe these soil-topography units. The concept of a catena was developed in order to analyze the regular variation of soils across a slope. The example of this approach consists first in a structural component, the recurring pattern of certain soils in a landscape [[transect]]s in which every chain element has its place in the chain, a soil has it in a landscape.

== Formation ==
The term soil catena is used to describe the lateral variation in soils over a hillslope. [2][9] A slope can be broken into sections known as a [[ridge]], crest, midslope, and toeslope. The ridge or hilltop tends to accumulate organic matter that allows formation of an adequate thickness of soil. Steeper slope or crest sections tend to be freely drained, while at the bottom of slopes or toeslopes there is usually higher in moisture content due to poor drainage.[7] Toeslope soils are not only higher in moisture content, but are also known to be richer in clay and organic matter.[2]

[[Lithology]] and [[Relief (geography)|relief]] can be the primary controls on the development of certain catenas [4] with easily disaggregated parent rock and high relief favoring particle redistribution and therefore the formation of distinct soils in particle-source and particle-deposition zones along a slope.[8]

Catenas can also develop on low relief hillslopes, but because less potential energy is available the redistribution of mass can be dominated by subsurface flow of plasma, a combination of dissolved and suspended solids in soil water.[1][6][8]

== Open system ==
[[File:Catena of soils.jpg|thumb|A catena is a sequence of soils down a slope, created by the balance of processes such as [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], infiltration and runoff.]]

[[File:Gully in the Soils Tulach north Blair Atholl - geograph.org.uk - 318986.jpg|thumb|left|Gullies in wet peaty soil in Scotland show where water has run off, before sinking into deeper soils at the bottom of the catena.]]
A catena forms when the climate, including [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[evaporation]], is the same for the whole slope, and when sufficient time has passed for equilibrium to be reached between the processes that bring materials in to a facet and the processes that take materials away. The result is a predictable sequence of soil facets.&lt;ref name="Schaetzl"&gt;Schaetzl, 2005. pp. 469-474.&lt;/ref&gt; A catena is thus an [[open system (systems theory)|open system]] which has continuous input and output processes. On a steeper slope in the middle of a catena, erosion, such as by runoff, is faster, so facets are typically thinner and drier. Conversely, on a shallower slope at the top or bottom of a catena, soils are thicker and deeper. In addition, the top facets lose materials such as mineral salts when these are washed out by rain (eluviation), while the bottom facets gain materials when these are washed in (illuviation).&lt;ref name=Schaetzl/&gt;&lt;ref name="Waugh"&gt;Waugh, 2000. p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

A catena can form on various underlying or parent materials and in different [[climate]]s.&lt;ref name=Schaetzl/&gt; On impermeable acid rocks such as [[metamorphism (geology)|metamorphic]] [[schist]]s in a high [[rainfall]] climate like that of Western [[Scotland]], the catena consists of thick acidic [[peat]] forming wet  [[bog]] on the flatter facets, and thinner, drier, somewhat less acidic peaty [[podsol]]s on the steeper facets. Thus the soil depth, acidity ([[pH]]) and soil moisture vary continuously along the slope.&lt;ref name=Schaetzl/&gt;&lt;ref name=Waugh/&gt; On a permeable basic rock such as [[chalk]], the catena may consist of thick [[brown earth]]s on the flatter facets, with thin [[rendzina]]s on the steeper slopes, while the valley bottom may include alkaline [[fen]] [[peat]] or river [[alluvium]].

== Importance ==
The importance of a catena is the variation of soils across a small area such as a slope. Understanding the soils that make up a catena could facilitate the mapping of soils across a given region.

Many fields of study are taken into consideration when studying catenas, studying catenas could help to understand the influence of soil hydrology on soil formation.

Catenas are found to be a great location for the study of [[soil science]], given that the catena concept focuses on past history of the land surface, on [[hydrology]], erosion, sediment transport, and [[Pedogenesis|pedogenic]] processes.

The term '''collective landscape''' was introduced to [[landscape design]] and [[landscape planning]] by [[Geoffrey Jellicoe|Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe]]. He wrote, on the dust jacket of his book:
::''The landscape of man'', that '' "The world is moving into a phase when landscape design may well be recognized as the most comprehensive of the arts. Man creates around him an environment that is a projection into nature of his abstract ideas. It is only in the present century that the '''collective landscape''' has emerged as a social necessity. We are promoting a landscape art on a scale never conceived of in history." ''

==Definitions==
It appears that the term was inspired by [[Carl Jung]]'s use of the term [[collective unconscious]]. Jellicoe admired Jung, but the use of 'collective landscape' in the above quotation has something in common with its use in [[collectivism]]. Unlike the terms [[public park]] and [[national park]], the term collective landscape is a psychological construct and an abstract concept.

'Collective landscape' is therefore best understood as a landscape which:
* exists in the collective unconscious
* like other [[public good]]s, does not belong to any individual

==Contemporary applications==
In American contemporary [[landscape architecture]] the term 'collective landscape' is used to mean 'landscape which matters to the community' as in the following quotation from the ''Smokey Mountain News'' for the week of 10/12/05: '' "The struggle to preserve a '''collective landscape''' heritage has been fought and won by the Cherokee once in the past, but is now at risk again." ''

==Population==
According to the 2001 census only 4,491 people were resident of Monsterrat. The total local-born population was 69% while those born abroad were 31%.&lt;ref name="2001 census"/&gt;
The estimated mid-year population of 2014 is 5,100 (medium fertility scenario of The 2012 Revision of the World Population Prospects).&lt;ref name="WPP 2012"&gt;[http://esa.un.org/wpp/index.htm Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, World Population Prospects: The 2012 Revision]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;''note:''
Approximately two thirds of the population left the island following the resumption of volcanic activity in July 1995. According to the [[2001 UK Census]] 7,983 Montserratian-born people were residing in the UK (almost twice the population of Montserrat itself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/23/34792376.xls |title=Country-of-birth database |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] |accessdate=2008-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617032129/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/23/34792376.xls |archivedate=2009-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography vol 1.jpg|275px|right|thumb|Title page to the 1856 edition of ''The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography'', vol. 1.]]
The '''''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography''''', first published in 1854, was the last of a series of classical dictionaries edited by the [[English people|English]] scholar [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] (1813&amp;ndash;1893), which included as sister works ''[[A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]'' and the ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]''. As declared by Smith in the ''Preface'': "The Dictionary of Geography ... is designed mainly to illustrate the Greek and Roman writers, and to enable a diligent student to read them in the most profitable manner". The book stays up to the description: in two massive volumes the dictionary provides detailed coverage of all the important countries, regions, towns, cities, geographical features that occur in Greek and Roman literature, without forgetting those mentioned solely in the Bible. The work was last reissued in 2005.

'''''Fram''''' ("Forward") is a [[ship]] that was used in expeditions of the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] regions by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] explorers [[Fridtjof Nansen]], [[Otto Sverdrup]], [[Oscar Wisting]], and [[Roald Amundsen]] between 1893 and 1912. It was designed and built by the Scottish-Norwegian shipwright [[Colin Archer]] for Fridtjof Nansen's 1893 Arctic expedition in which the plan was to freeze ''Fram''  into the [[Arctic ice]] sheet and float with it over the [[Geographic North Pole|North Pole]].

''Fram'' is said{{by who|date=April 2018}} to have sailed farther north (85°57'N) and farther south (78°41'S) than any other wooden ship. ''Fram'' is preserved at the [[Fram Museum]] in [[Oslo]], Norway.

==Construction==
Nansen's ambition was to explore the [[Arctic]] farther north than anyone else. To do that, he would have to deal with a problem that many sailing on the polar ocean had encountered before him: the freezing ice could crush a ship. Nansen's idea was to build a ship that could survive the pressure, not by pure strength, but because it would be of a shape designed to let the ice push the ship up, so it would "float" on top of the ice.
[[File:Fram 1893-1896 engineering drawing.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Engineering drawings]]

''Fram'' is a three-masted [[schooner]] with a total length of 39 meters and width of 11 meters. The ship is both unusually wide and unusually shallow in order to better withstand the forces of pressing ice.

Nansen commissioned the shipwright [[Colin Archer]] from [[Larvik]] to construct a vessel with these characteristics. ''Fram'' was built with an outer layer of [[Chlorocardium rodiei|greenheart]] wood to withstand the ice and with almost no [[keel]] to handle the shallow waters Nansen expected to encounter. The [[rudder]] and [[propeller]] were designed to be retracted. The ship was also carefully insulated to allow the crew to live on board for up to five years. The ship also included a [[windmill]], which ran a generator to provide electric power for lighting by [[Arc lamp|electric arc lamps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nansen | first = Fridtjof | authorlink = Fridtjof Nansen | year = 1897 | title = Farthest North, Volumes I and II | chapter=ch 2 | publisher = Archibald Constable &amp; Co. | location = London | ref = {{sfnRef|Nansen}} | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, ''Fram'' was fitted with a steam engine. Prior to Amundsen's expedition to the South Pole in 1910, the engine was replaced with a diesel engine, a first for polar exploration vessels.

==Expeditions==
Fram was used in several expeditions:
[[File:Framprow.jpg|thumb|150px|The prow of ''Fram'', as seen in the [[Fram Museum]] in 2010.]]

===Nansen's 1893–1896 Arctic expedition===
{{main|Nansen's Fram expedition}}
Wreckage found at Greenland from {{USS|Jeannette|1878|6}}, which was lost off Siberia, and driftwood found in the regions of [[Svalbard]] and [[Greenland]], suggested that an [[ocean current]] flowed beneath the Arctic ice sheet from east to west, bringing driftwood from the [[Siberia]]n region to Svalbard and further west. Nansen had ''Fram'' built in order to explore this theory.

[[File:PSM V57 D433 The ship named fram.png|thumb|left|''Fram'' in port, circa 1900&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Popular Science Monthly/Volume 57/August 1900/The Evolution and Present Status of the Automobile]]&lt;/ref&gt;
]]
He undertook an expedition that came to last three years. When Nansen realised that ''Fram'' would not reach the North Pole directly by the force of the current, he and [[Hjalmar Johansen]] set out to reach it on skis. After reaching 86° 14' north, he had to turn back to spend the winter at [[Franz Joseph Land]]. Nansen and Johansen survived on [[walrus]] and [[polar bear]] meat and [[blubber]]. Finally meeting British explorers, the [[Jackson-Harmsworth Expedition]], they arrived back in Norway only days before the ''Fram'' also returned there. The ship had spent nearly three years trapped in the ice, reaching 85° 57' N.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]], ''[[The Worst Journey in the World]]'', Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers, 1922, p. xxii&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sverdrup's 1898–1902 Canadian Arctic islands expedition===
In 1898, [[Otto Sverdrup]], who had brought ''Fram'' back on the first Arctic voyage, led a scientific expedition to the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]]. ''Fram'' was slightly modified for this journey, its [[Freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] being increased. ''Fram'' left harbour on 24 June 1898, with 17 men on board. Their aim was to chart the lands of the Arctic Islands, and to sample the geology, flora and fauna. The expeditions lasted till 1902, leading to charts covering 260,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, more than any other Arctic expedition.&lt;ref name=GKenny&gt;Gerard Kenney ''Ships of Wood and Men of Iron: A Norwegian-Canadian Saga of Exploration in the High Arctic'', {{ISBN|0-88977-168-5}}, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amundsen's 1910–1912 South Pole expedition===
[[File:Fram 1910-1912 Diesel Engine.jpg|thumb|150px|For [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition]], ''Fram'' was fitted with this diesel engine.]]

{{main|Amundsen's South Pole expedition}}
''Fram'' was used by [[Roald Amundsen]] in his southern polar expedition from 1910 to 1912, the first to reach the South Pole, during which ''Fram'' reached 78° 41' S.

==Preservation of ''Fram''==
The ship was left to decay in storage from 1912 until the late 1920s, when [[Lars Christensen]], [[Otto Sverdrup]] and [[Oscar Wisting]] initiated efforts to preserve her. In 1935, the ship was installed in the [[Fram Museum]], where she now stands.

'''Frankfurt Zoological Society''' (FZS) is an international conservation organisation founded in 1858 with headquarters in Frankfurt am Main, [[Germany]]. FZS focuses on maintaining biodiversity and conserving wildlife and ecosystems in protected areas and outstanding wild places.&lt;ref&gt;https://fzs.org/en/&lt;/ref&gt; FZS leads and supports about 30 projects in 18 countries. 
[[Bernhard Grzimek]], renowned German zoo director, zoologist, book author, editor, and animal conservationist in postwar West-Germany, served as president of the Frankfurt Zoological Society for over forty years.

==History==
FZS was founded in 1858 by Frankfurt citizens to establish a zoo, the [[Frankfurt Zoological Garden]], which it operated until the [[First World War]].
The city council then assumed responsibility for the zoo until 1950, when the society again became the zoo's development association.
In the 1950s the society became involved in conservation in the [[Serengeti]], and began supporting development of national parks in Africa. Since then the society has become increasingly involved in protecting and preserving endangered animals and their environments worldwide.&lt;ref name=self/&gt;

==Activities==
FZS provides logistical support to conservation areas around the world, sponsors animal census surveys, provides conservation-related education and gives advice to organizations involved in establishing conservation areas.
FZS participates in programs to protect highly endangered species and to reintroduce endangered species, acquires land for conservation areas and helps protect and regenerate natural landscapes.&lt;ref name=self/&gt;

===Projects===
Projects are designed as long-term and carried out in close cooperation with local organisations and authorities. Also, the integration of the local population is a vital aspect of FZS's project work.
FZS concentrates its efforts on habitats in grasslands, wetlands, forests and mountains.  All projects follow the common goal of maintaining wilderness and biodiversity.

Each year, enormous herds of wildebeest and zebra move thousands of kilometres across the Serengeti-Mara. These herds have a pivotal role in maintaining the ecosystem.]]

====Africa====
Traditionally, many FZS projects are located in [[Tanzania]]. Currently, FZS is engaged in the protection of the Serengeti,&lt;ref&gt;https://fzs.org/en/projects-2/current-projects/serengeti-conservation/&lt;/ref&gt; the Selous&lt;ref&gt;https://fzs.org/en/projects-2/current-projects/selous-conservation-project/&lt;/ref&gt; and the Mahale Ecosystem&lt;ref&gt;https://fzs.org/en/projects-2/current-projects/mahale/&lt;/ref&gt; and carries out research for the preservation of East Africas threatened habitats. 
Livestock and migration data is collected, rangers, scientists and veterinarians are educated and environmental education is promoted. 
Further projects are located in [[Zimbabwe]] ([[Gonarezhou]] sanctuary), [[Zambia]] (North [[Luangwa, Zambia|Luangwa]]) and the [[Democratic republic of Congo]] ([[Virunga National Park|Virunga]] and [[Maiko]] Nationalpark).&lt;ref&gt;https://fzs.org/en/projects-2/current-projects/virunga-conservation-project/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://fzs.org/en/projects-2/current-projects/maiko/&lt;/ref&gt; Exemplary local partners are Tanzania National Parks Authority (TANAPA) and Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI).

====Asia====
Another major project is situated in Central [[Sumatra]]: The [[Bukit Tigapuluh]] Sanctuary for the preservation of rainforest and wildlife. This project is aiming at the resettlement and reintroduction of confiscated  Orang Utans, which are prepared for their life in the wild through the local "jungle school". Further aspects of the work on site are conflict-prevention between humans and elephants, environmental education and initiatives supporting the local population in balancing out economical development and their traditions. 
Important project partners on site are the [[Bukit Tigapuluh National Park]] as well as the Orang Utan Project (TOP), the Jambi Province Conservation Authority and [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]].&lt;ref&gt;https://fzs.org/en/projects-2/current-projects/bukit-tigapuluh/&lt;/ref&gt;

====South America====
In South America, FZS furthers the protection of the biodiverse forests located at the [[Andes]]´ eastern slope and the adjacent lowlands. 
Patrols, aerial view evaluation, the education of rangers and environmental education are supported here. 
On site, FZS collaborates, amongst others, with Crees Foundation and the Fondo de las Américas (FONDAM).&lt;ref&gt;https://fzs.org/en/projects-2/current-projects/peru-programme/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Europe====
In [[Kazakhstan]], FZS is involved in the [[Altyn Dala]] Conservation. This international joint project furthers the protection of Kazakhstans unique grasslands and their keystone species. 
The initiative aims at building up a network of protected grasslands in central Kazakhstan. A special focus lies on the saiga-antilopes, of the [[Betpak-Dala]] population as they hold a key role in the ecosystems of the steppes and semi-deserts. 
Exemplary local project-partners are the Association for the Conservation of Biodiversity of Kazakhstan (ACBK) and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB).&lt;ref&gt;https://fzs.org/en/projects-2/current-projects/kasachstan/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coal]], [[iron ore]], [[bauxite]], [[zinc]], [[uranium]], [[antimony]], [[arsenic]], [[potash]], [[feldspar]], [[fluorspar]], [[gypsum]], [[timber]], [[fish]], [[gold]]

===Natural hazards===
Flooding, [[avalanche]]s, midwinter windstorms, [[drought]], [[forest fire]]s in the south near the Mediterranean

===Environment===
The region that now comprises France consisted of open grassland during the Pleistocene Ice Age. France gradually became forested as the glaciers retreated starting in 10,000 BC, but clearing of these primeval forests began in Neolithic times. These forests were still fairly extensive until the medieval era. 

In prehistoric times, France was home to large predatory animals such as wolves and brown bears, as well as herbivores such as elk. The larger fauna have disappeared outside the Pyrenees Mountains where bears live as a protected species. Smaller animals include martens, wild pigs, foxes, weasels, bats, rodents, rabbits, and assorted birds.

By the 15th century, France had largely been denuded of its forests and was forced to rely on Scandinavia and their North American colonies for lumber. Significant remaining forested areas are in the Gascony region and north in the Alsace-Ardennes area. The Ardennes Forest was the scene of extensive fighting in both world wars.

The upper central part of this region is dominated by the [[Paris Basin]], which consists of a layered sequence of [[sedimentary rock]]s. Fertile soils over much of the area make good agricultural land. The [[Normandy]] coast to the upper left is characterized by high, chalk cliffs, while the [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]] coast (the peninsula to the left) is highly indented where deep valleys were drowned by the sea, and the [[Bay of Biscay|Biscay]] coast to the southwest is marked by flat, sandy beaches.

==Political geography==

===Internal divisions===

{{main article|Administrative divisions of France}}

[[File:Départements+régions (France)-2016.svg|thumb|Regions and departments of Metropolitan France in 2016.]]

France has several levels of internal divisions. The first-level administrative division of Integral France is regions. Besides this the French Republic has sovereignty over several other territories, with various administrative levels. 
*Metropolitan (i.e. European) France is divided into 12 ''[[Région in France|régions]]'' and 1 territorial collectivity, [[Corsica]]. However, Corsica is referred to as a region in common speech. These regions are subdivided into 96 ''[[département]]s'', which are further divided into 329 [[arrondissements of France|arrondissements]], which are further divided into 3,879 [[Canton in France|cantons]], which are further divided into 36,568 [[Communes of France|communes]] (as of 1/1/2004).
[[File:France-Constituent-Lands.png|thumb|450px|The lands making up the French Republic, shown at the same [[Scale (map)|geographic scale]].]]
[[File:French Guiana in its region.svg|thumb|350px|[[French Guiana]]]]

*Five overseas regions (''[[région d'outre-mer|régions d'outre-mer]]'', or ''ROM''): [[Guadeloupe]], [[French Guiana]], [[Martinique]], [[Mayotte]], and [[Réunion]], with identical status to metropolitan regions. Each of these overseas regions also being an overseas département (''[[département d'outre-mer]]'', or ''DOM''), with the same status as a ''{{lang|fr|département}}'' of metropolitan France. This double structure (''région''/''{{lang|fr|département}}'') is new, due to the recent extension of the regional scheme to the overseas départements, and may soon transform into a single structure, with the merger of the regional and departmental assemblies. Another proposed change is that new ''départements'' are created such as in the case of [[Réunion]], where it has been proposed to create a second ''{{lang|fr|département}}'' in the south of the island, with the ''région'' of Réunion above these two ''départements''.
[[File:Territorial waters - France.svg|500px|thumb|The [[exclusive economic zone]]s of France]]
*Four overseas collectivities (''[[collectivité d'outre-mer|collectivités d'outre-mer]]'', or ''COM''): [[Saint-Pierre and Miquelon]], [[Saint Barthélemy]], [[Saint Martin]], and [[Wallis and Futuna]]. 
*One overseas "country" (''[[pays d'outre-mer]]'', or ''POM''): [[French Polynesia]]. In 2003 it became an overseas collectivity (or ''COM''). Its statutory law of 27 February 2004 gives it the particular designation of overseas country inside the Republic (or ''POM''), but without legal modification of its status.
*One [[sui generis]] collectivity (''[[collectivité sui generis]]''): [[New Caledonia]], whose status is unique in the French Republic.
*One overseas territory (''[[territoire d'outre-mer]]'', or ''TOM''): the [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]] divided into 5 districts: [[Kerguelen Islands]], [[Crozet Islands]], [[Île Amsterdam]] and [[Île Saint-Paul]], [[Adélie Land]], and the [[Îles Éparses|Scattered islands]] ([[Banc du Geyser]], [[Bassas da India]], [[Europa Island|Europa]], [[Juan de Nova Island|Juan de Nova]], [[Glorioso Islands|Glorioso]], and [[Tromelin Island|Tromelin]]).
*One uninhabited island in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Mexico which belongs directly to the central State [[public land]] and is administered by the high-commissioner of the French Republic in French Polynesia: [[Clipperton Island|Clipperton]].

===Boundaries===
* Land boundaries:
** ''Total:'' {{convert|3966.2|km}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4442">The '''geology of Guinea-Bissau''' is oldest in the east and becomes younger toward the west, with sediments from the past 66 million years nearer the coast. Some rock units in the northeast are as much as 680 million years old and throughout the geologic past [[Guinea-Bissau]] was influenced by the [[Mauritanide Belt]] [[orogeny]] and was submerged or partially submerged as a marine shelf or river delta for most of its existence. 

==Stratigraphy==
The oldest rocks in Guinea-Bissau are 680 million years old, dating to the [[Neoproterozoic]] in the [[Koulountou Group]] in the far northeast of the country. The Koulountou Group includes schistose lava rocks that are part of the [[Calc-Alkaline Complex]] of the [[Mauritanide Belt]]. The rocks are believed to have originated from volcanism at a continental margin, related to the Mauritanide orogeny. 

Radiometric dating of the unmetamorphosed, but slightly folded sedimentary rocks [[Youkounkoun Group]] gives an age of 580 million years ago. Geologists believe the Youkounkoun Group may be the remains of a[[molasse]] formed after the orogeny. The [[Mali Group]] and [[Batapa Group]] are both the same age, or slightly younger than the Youkounkoun Group. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schluter, Thomas |year=2006|title=Geological Atlas of Africa|publisher=Springer|p=126-127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)===
The [[Bove Basin]] covers most of central Guinea-Bissau, filled with thick sequences of sedimentary rock from the [[Paleozoic]]. The lowest unit is the 250 to 600 meter thick [[Pita Group]] from the [[Ordovician]] and early [[Devonian]]. The formation has conglomerate sandstones, probably the result of an alluvial plain. The overlying [[Telimele Group]] is thought to be from the Late Devonian, due to the presence of [[graptolite]] fossils. Similarly, the Late Devonian [[Bafata Group]] preserves the remains of a marine carbonate shelf environment. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=126}}

===Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)===
[[Mesozoic]] rocks from 251 to 66 million years ago are largely absent in Guinea-Bissau. In the west, there is an unconformity between Paleozoic sediments and [[Cenozoic]] marine sediments, which are cut by [[mafic]] [[Dike (geology)|dykes]]. 

In the past 2.5 million years of the [[Quaternary]], Guinea-Bissau's surficial geology and geomorphology have changed considerably, with the formation of new terraces and [[duricrust]], as well as frequent marine transgressions. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=126}}

==Structural Geology &amp; Tectonics==
The Bove Basin has a large and shallow open fold known as the [[Bove-Bofata Syncline]], that strikes northeast-southwest. The syncline is cut with brittle faults. 

==Natural resource geology==
Mining is not a significant part of the [[economy of Guinea-Bissau]], except for pits quarrying sand, gravel and clay for roads and building material. Lateritic regolith overlying Paleozoic sediments is known to contain [[bauxite]], but there is currently no exploitation of these resources. Some small, low-grade gold anomalies exist in the northeast of Guinea-Bissau. Geologists have found soil anomalies of zinc, copper, molybdenum and lead associated with Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, although they remain poorly understood. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=126}}

[[Eocene]] carbonates, formed in a shallow, sheltered bay, in the Farim region contain large phosphate reserves, discovered during oil drilling in the 1950s. The Directorate of Geology and Mines drilled seven boreholes in the region in the 1970s and in one hole, encountered a 4.9 meter sandy phosphate layer. Subsequent drilling produced estimates of 112 million tons in the deposit. The phosphate deposit is the southern equivalent of similar deposits in the Mauritania-Senegal-Guinea basin. Mining the deposits would be costly due to 26 to 50 meters over overlying sediments. The government of Guinea-Bissau experimented with applying ground phosphates extracted from the deposit on grain and groundnut fields, but never reported the results. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |title=Guinea-Bissau: Rocks for Crops|publisher=University of Guelph|url= http://www.uoguelph.ca/~geology/rocks_for_crops/30guinea_bissau.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Holy Land''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|אֶרֶץ הַקּוֹדֶשׁ}} {{transl|he|''Eretz HaKodesh''}}, {{lang-la|Terra Sancta}}; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|الأرض المقدسة}} {{transl|ar|''Al-Arḍ Al-Muqaddasah''}} or {{lang|ar|الديار المقدسة}} {{transl|ar|''Ad-Diyar Al-Muqaddasah''}}) is an area roughly located between the [[Jordan River]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] that also includes the Eastern Bank of the Jordan River. Traditionally, it is synonymous with both the biblical [[Land of Israel]] and historical [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. The term usually refers to a territory roughly corresponding to the modern [[State of Israel]], the [[Palestinian territories]], western [[Jordan]], and parts of southern [[Lebanon]] and southwestern [[Syria]]. It is considered [[holy]] by [[Jews]], [[Christian]]s, and [[Muslim]]s.

Part of the significance of the land stems from the [[religious significance of Jerusalem]], the holiest city to [[Judaism]], the historical region of [[Ministry of Jesus|Jesus' ministry]], and the site of the [[Isra and Mi'raj]] event in [[Islam]].

The holiness of the land to Christianity was part of the motivation for the [[Crusades]], as European Christians sought to win back the Holy Land from the Muslims, who had [[Muslim conquests|conquered it]] from the Christian [[Byzantine Empire]].

Many sites in the Holy Land have long been [[pilgrimage]] destinations for adherents of the [[Abrahamic religions]], including Jews, Christians, Muslims, and [[Bahá'ís]]. [[Pilgrim]]s visit the Holy Land to touch and see physical manifestations of their [[faith]], confirm their beliefs in the holy context with collective excitation, and connect personally to the Holy Land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael Sebastian |last=Metti |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Jerusalem - the most powerful brand in history |url=http://www.metti-bronner.com/Jerusalem.pdf |work=[[Stockholm University School of Business]] |publisher= |date=2011-06-01 |accessdate=1 July 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews do not commonly refer to the [[Land of Israel]] as "Holy Land" ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|אֶרֶץ הַקוֹדֵשׁ}} {{transl|he|''Eretz HaKodesh''}}). The [[Tanakh]] explicitly refers to it as "holy land" in only one passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Zechariah|2:16|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "holy land" is further used twice in the deuterocanonical books.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Wisdom|12:3|NRSV}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||2 Maccabees|1:7|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The holiness of the Land of Israel is generally implied in the Tanakh by the Land being given to the [[Israelites]] by God, that is, it is the "[[promised land]]", an integral part of [[Covenant (biblical)|God's covenant]]. In the [[Torah]] many [[mitzvot]] commanded to the Israelites can only be performed in the Land of Israel,&lt;ref&gt;Aharon Ziegler, ''Halakhic positions of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik: Volume 4'', KTAV Publishing House, 2007, p.173&lt;/ref&gt; which serves to differentiate it from other lands. For example, in the Land of Israel, "no land shall be sold permanently" (Lev. 25:23). [[Shmita]] is only observed with respect to the land of Israel, and the observance of many [[Jewish holiday|holy]] days is different, as an extra day is observed in the [[Jewish diaspora]].

According to [[Eliezer Schweid]]:
{{quote|The uniqueness of the Land of Israel is...'geo-theological' and not merely climatic. This is the land which faces the entrance of the spiritual world, that sphere of existence that lies beyond the physical world known to us through our senses. This is the key to the land's unique status with regard to prophecy and prayer, and also with regard to the commandments&lt;ref&gt;''The Land of Israel: National Home Or Land of Destiny'', By Eliezer Schweid, Translated by Deborah Greniman, Published 1985 Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, {{ISBN|0-8386-3234-3}}, p.56.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From the perspective of the 1906 [[Jewish Encyclopedia]], the holiness of Israel had been concentrated since the sixteenth century, especially for burial, in the "[[Four Holy Cities]]": [[Jerusalem]], [[Hebron]], [[Safed]] and [[Tiberias]] - as [[Judaism]]'s holiest cities. Jerusalem, as the site of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], is considered especially significant.&lt;ref name=1000BCE&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Sacred burials are still undertaken for diaspora Jews who wish to lie buried in the holy soil of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11867-palestine-holiness-of | title=PALESTINE, HOLINESS OF | publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com | accessdate=December 7, 2011 | author=Joseph Jacobs, Judah David Eisenstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jewish tradition, Jerusalem is Mount [[Moriah]], the location of the [[binding of Isaac]]. The [[Hebrew Bible]] mentions the name "[[Jerusalem]]" 669 times, often because many mitzvot can only be performed within its environs. The name "[[Zion]]", which usually refers to Jerusalem, but sometimes the Land of Israel, appears in the Hebrew Bible 154 times.

The [[Talmud]] mentions the religious duty of colonising Israel.&lt;ref name="Herzog1967"&gt;{{cite book|author=Isaac Herzog|title=The Main Institutions of Jewish Law: The law of obligations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eq3XAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=27 June 2011|year=1967|publisher=Soncino Press|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; So significant in Judaism is the act of purchasing land in Israel, the Talmud allows for the lifting of certain religious restrictions of [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] observance to further its acquisition and settlement.&lt;ref name="Zahavi1962"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yosef Zahavi|title=Eretz Israel in rabbinic lore (Midreshei Eretz Israel): an anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yK7hAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=19 June 2011|year=1962|publisher=Tehilla Institute|page=28|quote=If one buys a house from a non-Jew in Israel, the title deed may be written for him even on the Sabbath.

Eleazar b. Shammua' and R. [[Johanan HaSandlar]] left Israel to study from R. [[Judah ben Bathyra]], they only managed to reach [[Sidon]] when "the thought of the sanctity of Palestine overcame their resolution, and they shed tears, rent their garments, and turned back".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to the Jewish population being concentrated in Israel, emigration was generally prevented, which resulted in a limiting of the amount of space available for Jewish learning. However, after suffering persecutions in Israel for centuries after the destruction of the Temple, Rabbis who had found it very difficult to retain their position moved to Babylon, which offered them better protection. Many Jews wanted Israel to be the place where they died, in order to be buried there. The sage Rabbi Anan said "To be buried in Israel is like being buried under the altar."&lt;ref name="first"/&gt;&lt;ref name="(Translator)2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gil1997"/&gt; The saying "His land will absolve His people" implies that burial in Israel will cause one to be absolved of all one's sins.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11867-palestine-holiness-of|title=PALESTINE, HOLINESS OF - JewishEncyclopedia.com|last=|first=|date=|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3364937/jewish/Why-Do-Jews-Fly-Their-Dead-to-Israel-for-Burial.htm|title=Why Do Jews Fly Their Dead to Israel for Burial?|website=www.chabad.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tebnine11.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Crusader castle of [[Toron]] in the village of [[Tebnine|Tibnin]], [[Lebanon]]]]

For [[Christian]]s, the [[Land of Israel]] is considered holy because of its association with the [[Birth of Jesus|birth]], ministry, [[crucifixion]] and [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] of [[Jesus]], whom Christians regard as the Savior or [[Messiah]], and because it is the land of the Jewish people (according to the Bible). Christian books, including editions of the Bible, often had maps of the Holy Land (considered to be Galilee, Samaria, Judea). For instance, the ''Itinerarium Sacrae Scripturae'' (Travel book through Holy Scripture) of Heinrich Bünting (1545-1606), a German Protestant pastor, featured such a map.&lt;ref name="wdl"/&gt; His book was very popular, and it provided "the most complete available summary of biblical geography and described the geography of the Holy Land by tracing the travels of major figures from the Old and New testaments."&lt;ref name="wdl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Description of the Holy Land|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2891/|website=[[World Digital Library]]|date=1585|language=German|author1=Bünting, Heinrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a geographic term, the description "Holy Land" loosely encompasses modern-day [[Israel]], the [[Palestinian territories]], [[Lebanon]], western [[Jordan]] and south-western [[Syria]].

{{See also|Jerusalem in Islam|Syria (region)}}
In the [[Qur'an]], the term {{lang-ar|'''الأرض المقدسة'''}} ({{transl|ar|''Al-Ard Al-Muqaddasah''}}, {{lang-en|"Holy Land"}}) is used in a passage about [[Moses in Islam|Musa]] ([[Moses]]) proclaiming to the [[Children of Israel]]: "O my people! Enter the holy land which [[Allah]] hath assigned unto you, and turn not back ignominiously, for then will ye be overthrown, to your own ruin." ([[wikisource:The Holy Qur'an/Al-Meada|Surah 5:21]]) The Quran also refers to the land as being 'Blessed'.&lt;ref name="Cite quran|17|1|e=16|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|17|1|e=16|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite quran|21|51|e=82|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|21|51|e=82|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite quran|34|10|e=18|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|34|10|e=18|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerusalem]] (referred to as ''Al-Quds'' ({{lang-ar|الـقُـدس}}, "The Holy")) has particular significance in Islam. The Quran refers to [[Muhammad]]'s experiencing the [[Isra and Mi'raj]] as "a Journey by night from ''[[Masjid Al-Haram|Al-Masjidil-Haram]]'' to ''[[Masjid Al-Aqsa|Al-Masjidil-Aqsa]]'', whose precincts We did bless ..." (17:1).&lt;ref name="Cite quran|17|1|e=16|s=ns"/&gt; ''[[Ahadith]]'' infer that the "Farthest Masjid" is in Al-Quds; for example, as narrated by [[Abu Huraira]]h: "On the night journey of the Apostle of Allah, two cups, one containing wine and the other containing milk, were presented to him at Al-Quds (Jerusalem). He looked at them and took the cup of milk. Angel Gabriel said, "Praise be to Allah, who guided you to Al-Fitrah (the right path); if you had taken (the cup of) wine, your ''[[Ummah]]'' would have gone astray". However, some modern scholars argue that the 'Farthest Mosque' was a building or prayer-site just outside [[Medina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3596681,00.html|title=The myth of al-Aqsa:Holiness of Jerusalem to Islam has always been politically motivated|website=Ynetnews|date=15 Sep 2008|author=[[Mordechai Kedar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/temples.html|title=The Jewish Temples: The Temples of Jerusalem in Islam|author=[[Martin Kramer]]|website=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present building of Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem had not been built in Muhammad's day, and the Quran does not contain any other reference to Jerusalem, apart from the reference to the change of the ''[[Qibla]]h'' from Jerusalem to Mecca. [[Jerusalem]] was Islam's first ''Qiblah'' (direction of prayer) in Muhammad's lifetime, however, this was later changed to the [[Kaaba]] in the [[Hijaz]]i city of [[Mecca]], following a revelation to Muhammad by the Archangel [[Jibril]],&lt;ref name="Cite quran|2|142|e=177|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|2|142|e=177|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which it is understood by scholars {{who|date=February 2016}} that it was in answer to the rejection by the Jews of Muhammed's Prophetship.

The exact region referred to as being 'blessed' in the Qur'an, in verses like [17:1], [21:71] and [34:18],&lt;ref name="Cite quran|17|1|e=16|s=ns"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite quran|21|51|e=82|s=ns"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite quran|34|10|e=18|s=ns"/&gt; has been interpreted differently by various scholars. [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]] likens it to a wide land-range including [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]], especially the cities of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]]; Az-Zujaj describes it as, ''"[[Damascus]], Palestine, and a bit of [[Jordan]]"''; [[Muadh ibn Jabal]] as, ''"the area between [[al-Arish]] and the [[Euphrates]]"''; and [[Ibn Abbas]] as, ''"the land of [[Jericho]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;Ali (1991), p. 934&lt;/ref&gt; This overall region is referred to as "[[Ash-Shām]]" ({{lang-ar|الـشَّـام}}).&lt;ref name="Volume 9 1997 page 261"&gt;Article "AL-SHĀM" by [[C.E.

From the classical perspective however Syria, including Palestine, formed no more than the western fringes of what was reckoned to be Arabia between the first line of cities and the coast. Since there is no clear dividing line between what are called today the Syrian and Arabian deserts, which actually form one stretch of arid tableland, the classical concept of what actually constituted Syria had more to its credit geographically than the vaguer Arab concept of Syria as Bilad al-Sham. Under the Romans, there was actually a province of Syria. with its capital at Antioch, which carried the name of the territory. Otherwise. down the centuries, Syria like Arabia and Mesopotamia was no more than a geographic expression. In Islamic times, the Arab geographers used the name arabicized as Suriyah, to denote one special region of Bilad al-Sham, which was the middle section of the valley of the Orontes river, in the vicinity of the towns of Homs and Hama. They also noted that it was an old name for the whole of Bilad al-Sham which had gone out of use. As a geographic expression, however, the name Syria survived in its original classical sense in Byzantine and Western European usage, and also in the Syriac literature of some of the Eastern Christian churches, from which it occasionally found its way into Christian Arabic usage. It was only in the nineteenth century that the use of the name was revived in its modern Arabic form, frequently as Suriyya rather than the older Suriyah, to denote the whole of Bilad al-Sham: first of all in the Christian Arabic literature of the period, and under the influence of Western Europe. By the end of that century it had already replaced the name of Bilad al-Sham even in Muslim Arabic usage.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human ecology''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] and [[transdisciplinary]] study of the relationship between [[human]]s and their [[natural environment|natural]], [[Social environment|social]], and [[built environment]]s. The philosophy and study of human ecology has a diffuse history with advancements in [[ecology]], [[geography]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[zoology]], [[epidemiology]], [[public health]], and [[home economics]], among others.

==Historical development==
{{more|History of ecology}}
The roots of ecology as a broader discipline can be traced to the Greeks and a lengthy list of developments in [[natural history|natural history science]]. Ecology also has notably developed in other cultures. Traditional knowledge, as it is called, includes the human propensity for intuitive knowledge, intelligent relations, understanding, and for passing on information about the natural world and the human experience.&lt;ref name="Young74" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huntignton00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Huntington | first1=H.

Like other contemporary researchers of his time, Haeckel adopted his terminology from [[Carl Linnaeus]] where human ecological connections were more evident. In his 1749 publication, ''Specimen academicum de oeconomia naturae'', Linnaeus developed a science that included the ''economy and polis of nature''. Polis stems from its Greek roots for a political community (originally based on the city-states), sharing its roots with the word police in reference to the promotion of growth and maintenance of good social order in a community.&lt;ref name="Young74" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce10"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Pearce | first1=T. | title=A great complication of circumstances | journal=Journal of the History of Biology | date=2010 | volume=43 | issue=3 | pages=493–528 | doi=10.1007/s10739-009-9205-0 | pmid=20665080 | url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~/trpearce/Pearce2010.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331011216/http://home.uchicago.edu/~/trpearce/Pearce2010.pdf | archivedate=2012-03-31 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kricher09"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Kricher | first1=J. | title=The balance of nature: Ecology's enduring myth | publisher=Princeton University Press | pages=252 | isbn=0-691-13898-2 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=G66yLaHLv2QC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Specimen+academicum+de+oeconomia+naturae+to+english#v=onepage&amp;q=Specimen%20academicum%20de%20oeconomia%20naturae&amp;f=false| date=2009-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Egerton07"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Egerton | first1=F.

Ecology is not just biological, but a human science as well.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt; An early and influential social scientist in the history of human ecology was [[Herbert Spencer]]. Spencer was influenced by and reciprocated his influence onto the works of Charles Darwin. Herbert Spencer coined the phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]", he was an early founder of sociology where he developed the idea of society as an organism, and he created an early precedent for the socio-ecological approach that was the subsequent aim and link between sociology and human ecology.&lt;ref name="Young74" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Catton94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Catton | first1=W.

In 1894, an influential [[Chicago school (sociology)|sociologist at the University of Chicago]] named [[Albion W. Small]], collaborated with sociologist [[George E. Vincent]] and published a "‘‘laboratory guide’’ to studying people in their ‘‘every-day occupations.’’"&lt;ref name="Gross04" /&gt;{{rp|578}} This was a guidebook that trained students of sociology how they could study [[society]] in a way that a [[natural history|natural historian]] would study birds. Their publication "explicitly included the relation of the social world to the material environment."&lt;ref name="Gross04" /&gt;{{rp|578}}

The first English-language use of the term "ecology" is credited to American chemist and founder of the field of home economics, [[Ellen Swallow Richards]]. Richards first introduced the term as "[[oekology]]" in 1892, and subsequently developed the term "human ecology".&lt;ref name="Merchant2"/&gt;

The term "human ecology" was published in 1907 in [[Ellen Swallow Richards]] work "Sanitation in Daily Life", defined there as "the study of the surroundings of human beings in the effects they produce on the lives of men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Ellen H.|title=Sanitation in Daily Life|origyear=1907 |year=2012|publisher=Forgotten Books|asin=B008KX8KGA|pages=v.|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sanitation-Daily-Life-Classic-Reprint/dp/B008KX8KGA#reader_B008KX8KGA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard's use of the term recognized humans as part of rather than separate from nature.&lt;ref name="Merchant2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Merchant|first=C.|title=American Environmental History: An Introduction|date=2007|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0231140355|pages=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term made its first formal appearance in the field of sociology in the 1921 book "Introduction to the Science of Sociology",&lt;ref name="Park21"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Park | editor1-first=R.

Human ecology has a fragmented academic history with developments spread throughout a range of disciplines, including: home economics, geography, anthropology, sociology, zoology, and psychology.

Human ecology has been defined as a type of analysis applied to the relations in human beings that was traditionally applied to plants and animals in ecology.&lt;ref name="Park36"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Park | first1=R. E. | date=1936 | title=Human ecology | journal=American Journal of Sociology | volume=42 | issue=1 | pages=1–15 | jstor=2768859 | doi=10.1086/217327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toward this aim, human ecologists (which can include [[sociologists]]) integrate diverse perspectives from a broad spectrum of disciplines covering "wider points of view".&lt;ref name="Borden08"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Borden | first1=R.J | title=A brief history of SHE: Reflections on the founding and first twenty five years of the Society for Human Ecology | journal=Human Ecology Review | volume=15 | issue=1 | date=2008 | pages=95–108 | url=http://www.humanecologyreview.org/pastissues/her151/borden.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|107}} In its 1972 premier edition, the editors of ''[[Human Ecology (journal)|Human Ecology: An Interdisciplinary Journal]]'' gave an introductory statement on the scope of topics in human ecology.&lt;ref name="HEJ"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Editors | title=Introductory statement | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=1 | date=1972 | jstor=4602239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their statement provides a broad overview on the interdisciplinary nature of the topic:

* Genetic, physiological, and social adaptation to the environment and to environmental change;
* The role of social, cultural, and psychological factors in the maintenance or disruption of ecosystems;
* Effects of population density on health, social organization, or environmental quality;
* New adaptive problems in urban environments;
* Interrelations of technological and environmental changes;
* The development of unifying principles in the study of biological and cultural adaptation;
* The genesis of maladaptions in human biological and cultural evolution;
* The relation of food quality and quantity to physical and intellectual performance and to demographic change;
* The application of computers, remote sensing devices, and other new tools and techniques&lt;ref name="HEJ" /&gt;{{rp|1}}

Forty years later in the same journal, [[Daniel Bates|Daniel G. Bates]] (2012)&lt;ref name="Bates12"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bates | first1=D. G. | title=On forty years: Remarks from the editor | journal=Hum. Ecol. | volume=40 | issue=1 | pages=1–4 | doi=10.1007/s10745-012-9461-z| date=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; notes lines of continuity in the discipline and the way it has changed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today there is greater emphasis on the problems facing individuals and how actors deal with them with the consequence that there is much more attention to decision-making at the individual level as people strategize and optimize risk, costs and benefits within specific contexts. Rather than attempting to formulate a cultural ecology or even a specifically “human ecology” model, researchers more often draw on demographic, economic and evolutionary theory as well as upon models derived from field ecology.&lt;ref name="Bates12" /&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While theoretical discussions continue, research published in ''[[Human Ecology Review]]'' suggests that recent discourse has shifted toward applying principles of human ecology. Some of these applications focus instead on addressing problems that cross disciplinary boundaries or transcend those boundaries altogether. Scholarship has increasingly tended away from [[Gerald L. Young]]'s idea of a "unified theory" of human ecological knowledge—that human ecology may emerge as its own discipline—and more toward the pluralism best espoused by [[Paul Shepard]]: that human ecology is healthiest when "running out in all directions.".&lt;ref name="Shepard67"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Shepard | first1=P. | date=1967 | title=What ever happened to human ecology? | journal=BioScience | volume=17 | issue=12 | pages=891–894 | jstor=1293928 | doi = 10.2307/1293928 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  But human ecology is neither anti-discipline nor anti-theory, rather it is the ongoing attempt to formulate, synthesize, and apply theory to bridge the widening schism between man and nature. This new human ecology emphasizes complexity over [[reductionism]], focuses on changes over stable states, and expands ecological concepts beyond plants and animals to include people.

==Application to epidemiology and public health==
The application of ecological concepts to epidemiology has similar roots to those of other disciplinary applications, with Carl Linnaeus having played a seminal role. However, the term appears to have come  into common use in the medical and public health literature in the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Corwin EHL. Ecology of health. New York: Commonwealth Fund, 1949. Cited in le Riche WH, Milner J. Epidemiology as Medical Ecology.  Churchill Livingstone.

Ecohealth research in practice: Innovative Applications of an Ecosystem Approach to Health. Springer, IDRC 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing in turn from the application of concepts such as the social-ecological model of health, human ecology has converged with the mainstream of global public health literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=F |last1=White |first2=L |last2=Stallones |first3=JM. |last3=Last |title=Global Public Health: Ecological Foundations|date=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-975190-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection to home economics==
In addition to its links to other disciplines, human ecology has a strong historical linkage to the field of home economics through the work of [[Ellen Swallow Richards]], among others. However, as early as the 1960s, a number of universities began to rename home economics departments, schools, and colleges as human ecology programs. In part, this name change was a response to perceived difficulties with the term home economics in a modernizing society, and reflects a recognition of human ecology as one of the initial choices for the discipline which was to become home economics.&lt;ref name=Cornell&gt;{{cite web|title=Why the Change to Human Ecology?|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/homeEc/cases/namechange.html|publisher=Cornell University |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current human ecology programs include [[Cornell University College of Human Ecology]] and the University of Alberta's Department of Human Ecology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Alberta Department of Human Ecology|url=http://www.hecol.ualberta.ca/}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

Ecological resilience is an important conceptual framework in conservation management and it is defined as the preservation of biological relations in ecosystems that persevere and regenerate in response to disturbance over time. However, persistent, systematic, large and nonrandom disturbance caused by the niche constructing behavior of human beings, habitat conversion and land development, has pushed many of the Earth's ecosystems to the extent of their resilient thresholds. Three planetary thresholds have already been crossed, including [[biodiversity loss]], [[climate change]], and [[nitrogen cycle]]s. These biophysical systems are ecologically interrelated and naturally resilient, but human civilization has transitioned the planet to an [[Anthropocene]] epoch, where the threshold for planetary scale resilience has been crossed and the ecological state of the Earth is deteriorating rapidly to the detriment of humanity.&lt;ref name="Rockström09"&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Rockström |first = W. |last2 = Noone |first2 = K. |last3=Persson| first3=A. | last4=Chapin| first4=S. | last5=Lambin | first5=E.

[[Ecological economics]] is an [[economics|economic science]] that extends its methods of valuation onto nature in an effort to address the inequity between market growth and biodiversity loss.&lt;ref name="de Groot02" /&gt; Natural capital is the stock of materials or information stored in biodiversity that generates services that can enhance the welfare of communities.&lt;ref name="Costanza97"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Costanza, R. |title=The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital |journal=Nature |volume=387 |pages=253–260 |date=1997 |url=http://www.uvm.edu/giee/publications/Nature_Paper.pdf |doi=10.1038/387253a0 |ref=harv |issue=6630 |display-authors=1 |last2=d'Arge |first2=Ralph |last3=De Groot |first3=Rudolf |last4=Farber |first4=Stephen |last5=Grasso |first5=Monica |last6=Hannon |first6=Bruce |last7=Limburg |first7=Karin |last8=Naeem |first8=Shahid |last9=O'Neill |first9=Robert V. |last10=Paruelo |first10=Jose |last11=Raskin |first11=Robert G. |last12=Sutton |first12=Paul |last13=Van Den Belt |first13=Marjan |bibcode=1997Natur.387..253C |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226124242/http://www.uvm.edu/giee/publications/Nature_Paper.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Population losses are the more sensitive indicator of natural capital than are species extinction in the accounting of ecosystem services.

The work of [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] is notable for building on the integration between ecology and its economic origins. Boulding drew parallels between ecology and economics, most generally in that they are both studies of individuals as members of a system, and indicated that the “household of man” and the “household of nature” could somehow be integrated to create a perspective of greater value.&lt;ref&gt;Boulding, K.E. 1950. ''An Ecological Introduction''.  In A Reconstruction of Economics, Wiley, New York. pp. 3-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boulding, K.E. 1966. ''Economics and Ecology''.  In Nature Environments of North America, F.F. Darling and J.P. Milton, eds, Doubleday New York. pp.225-231.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interdisciplinary approaches==
{{quote box
| quote =
Human ecology may be defined: (1) from a bio-ecological standpoint as the study of man as the ecological dominant in plant and animal communities and systems; (2) from a bio-ecological standpoint as simply another animal affecting and being affected by his physical environment; and (3) as a human being, somehow different from animal life in general, interacting with physical and modified environments in a distinctive and creative way. A truly interdisciplinary human ecology will most likely address itself to all three.&lt;ref name="Young74" /&gt;{{Rp|8–9}}
| width = 30%
| align = right}}

Human ecology expands functionalism from ecology to the human mind. People's perception of a complex world is a function of their ability to be able to comprehend beyond the immediate, both in time and in space. This concept manifested in the popular slogan promoting sustainability: "think global, act local." Moreover, people's conception of community stems from not only their physical location but their mental and emotional connections and varies from "community as place, community as way of life, or community of collective action."&lt;ref name="Young74"/&gt;

In these early years, human ecology was still deeply enmeshed in its respective disciplines: geography, sociology, anthropology, psychology, and economics. Scholars through the 1970s until present have called for a greater integration between all of the scattered disciplines that has each established formal ecological research.&lt;ref name="Young74"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu07" /&gt;

===In art===

While some of the early writers considered how art fit into a human ecology, it was Sears who posed the idea that in the long run human ecology will in fact look more like art. [[Bill Carpenter (writer)|Bill Carpenter]] (1986) calls human ecology the "possibility of an aesthetic science," renewing dialogue about how art fits into a human ecological perspective. According to Carpenter, human ecology as an aesthetic science counters the disciplinary fragmentation of knowledge by examining human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, B. 1986. ''Human Ecology: The Possibility of an Aesthetic Science''. Paper presented at the Society for Human Ecology conference.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In education===

While the reputation of human ecology in institutions of higher learning is growing, there is no human ecology at the primary and secondary education levels. Educational theorist Sir [[Ken Robinson (educationalist)|Kenneth Robinson]] has called for diversification of education to promote creativity in academic and non-academic (i.e.- educate their “whole being”) activities to implement a “new conception of human ecology”.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, K. 2006. TED Talk, http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bioregionalism and urban ecology==
{{main article|Bioregionalism}}
{{see also|Urban ecology}}

In the late 1960s, ecological concepts started to become integrated into the applied fields, namely [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]], and [[planning]]. [[Ian McHarg]] called for a future when all planning would be “human ecological planning” by default, always bound up in humans’ relationships with their environments. He emphasized local, place-based planning that takes into consideration all the “layers” of information from [[geology]] to [[botany]] to zoology to [[cultural history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McHarg | first1 = I. | date = 1981 | title = Ecological Planning at Pennsylvania | url = | journal = Landscape Planning | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 109–120 | doi=10.1016/0304-3924(81)90029-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the [[new urbanism]] movement, like [[James Howard Kunstler]] and [[Andres Duany]], have embraced the term human ecology as way to describe the problem of—and prescribe the solutions for—the landscapes and lifestyles of an automobile oriented society. Duany has called the human ecology movement to be "the agenda for the years ahead."&lt;ref&gt;In Kunstler, J.H. 1994. ''The Geography of Nowhere''. New York:Touchstone. pp.260&lt;/ref&gt; While McHargian planning is still widely respected, the [[landscape urbanism]] movement seeks a new understanding between human and environment relations.  Among these theorists is [[Frederich Steiner]], who published ''Human Ecology: Following Nature's Lead'' in 2002 which focuses on the relationships among landscape, culture, and planning. The work highlights the beauty of scientific inquiry by revealing those purely human dimensions which underlie our concepts of ecology.  While Steiner discusses specific ecological settings, such as cityscapes and waterscapes, and the relationships between socio-cultural and environmental regions, he also takes a diverse approach to ecology—considering even the unique synthesis between ecology and [[political geography]]. [[Deiter Steiner]]'s 2003 ''Human Ecology: Fragments of Anti-fragmentary'' view of the world is an important expose of recent trends in human ecology.  Part literature review, the book is divided into four sections: "human ecology", "the implicit and the explicit", "structuration", and "the regional dimension".&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, D. and M. Nauser (eds.). 1993. ''Human Ecology: Fragments of Anti-fragmentary Views of the World.'' London and New York: Routledge. Human Ecology Forum 108 ''Human Ecology Review'', 2008; Vol. 15, No. 1,&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the work stresses the need for transciplinarity, antidualism, and wholeness of perspective.

The field was started in the 1960s by the ecologists [[Robert MacArthur|Robert H. MacArthur]]&lt;!--The book title includes the initial.--&gt; and [[E. O. Wilson]]&lt;!--He really goes by "E. O." conventionally.--&gt;,&lt;ref name="MacArthur &amp; Wilson 1967"&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacArthur |first1=Robert H. |authorlink1=Robert MacArthur |last2=Wilson |first2=E. O. |authorlink2=E. O.

== Definitions ==
For biogeographical purposes, an insular environment or "island" is any area of habitat suitable for a specific ecosystem, surrounded by an expanse of unsuitable habitat.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} While this may be a traditional [[island]]—a mass of land surrounded by water—the term may also be applied to many nontraditional "islands", such as the peaks of mountains,&lt;ref name="Brown 1978" /&gt; isolated springs or lakes surrounded by desert,{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, and non-contiguous woodlands.&lt;ref name="Sahney, Benton, Ferry 2010" /&gt; The concept is often applied to natural habitats surrounded by human-altered landscapes, such as expanses of [[grassland]] surrounded by highways or housing tracts{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, and national parks.&lt;ref name="Newmark 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Newmark |first=W.

== Theory ==
The theory of insular biogeography proposes that the number of species found in an undisturbed insular environment ("island") is determined by [[immigration]] and [[extinction]]. And further, that the isolated populations may follow different evolutionary routes, as shown by Darwin's observation of [[Darwin's finches|finches]] in the [[Galapagos Islands]]. Immigration and emigration are affected by the distance of an island from a source of colonists ([[Distance decay|distance effect]]). Usually this source is the mainland, but it can also be other islands. Islands that are more isolated are less likely to receive immigrants than islands that are less isolated.

The rate of extinction once a species manages to colonize an island is affected by island size; this is the [[species-area curve]] or effect. Larger islands contain larger habitat areas and opportunities for more different varieties of habitat. Larger habitat size reduces the probability of extinction due to [[Stochastic|chance]] [[Event (probability theory)|events]]. [[Habitat]] [[heterogeneity]] increases the number of species that will be successful after immigration.

Over time, the countervailing forces of extinction and immigration result in an equilibrium level of species richness.

[[File:Insular Biogeography (Distance).png|thumb|This diagram shows the effect of an island’s distance from the mainland on the amount of species richness. The sizes of the two islands are approximately the same. Island 1 receives more random dispersion of organisms, while island number two, since it is farther away, receives less random dispersion of organisms.]]

[[File:Insular Biogeography (Size).png|thumb|This diagram shows the effect of an island’s size on the amount of species richness. The diagram shows two islands equidistant from the mainland. Island 1 receives less random dispersion of organisms. While island 2 receives more of the arrows and therefore more random dispersion of organisms.]]

=== Modifications ===

In addition to having an effect on immigration rates, isolation can also affect extinction rates.  Populations on islands that are less isolated are less likely to go extinct because individuals from the source population and other islands can immigrate and "rescue" the population from extinction; this is known as the rescue effect.

In addition to having an effect on extinction, island size can also affect immigration rates.  Species may actively target larger islands for their greater number of resources and available niches; or, larger islands may accumulate more species by chance just because they are larger. This is the target effect.

=== Influencing factors ===
[[Image:Area species curve herpetofauna.svg|thumb|right|220px|Total number of reptilian and amphibian species on seven small and large islands in the [[West Indies]]]]
* Degree of isolation (distance to nearest neighbour, and mainland)
* Length of isolation (time)
* Size of island (larger area usually facilitates greater diversity)
* The habitat suitability which includes:
** Climate (tropical versus arctic, humid versus arid, etc.)
** Initial plant and animal composition if previously attached to a larger land mass  (e.g. [[marsupials]], [[primates]])
** The current species composition
* Location relative to ocean currents (influences nutrient, fish, bird, and seed flow patterns)
* [[Serendipity]] (the impacts of chance arrivals)
* Human activity

== Historical record ==
The theory can be studied through the fossils, which provide a record of life on Earth. 300 million years ago, Europe and North America lay on the equator and were covered by steamy tropical rainforests. Climate change devastated these tropical rainforests during the [[Carboniferous]] Period and as the climate grew drier, rainforests fragmented. Shrunken islands of forest were uninhabitable for amphibians but were well suited to reptiles, which became more diverse and even varied their diet in the rapidly changing environment; this [[Carboniferous rainforest collapse]] event triggered an evolutionary burst among reptiles.&lt;ref name="Sahney, Benton, Ferry 2010" /&gt;

== Research experiments ==
The theory of island biogeography was experimentally tested by E. O. Wilson and his student [[Daniel Simberloff]] in the [[mangrove]] islands in the [[Florida Keys]].&lt;ref name = "Simberloff"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Simberloff |first=Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Simberloff |last2=Wilson |first2=Edward O. |authorlink2=E. O. Wilson

  |doi=10.2307/1934856 |accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Species richness on several small mangroves islands were surveyed. The islands were fumigated with [[methyl bromide]] to clear their [[arthropod]] communities. Following fumigation the immigration of species onto the islands was monitored. Within a year the islands had been recolonised. Islands closer to the mainland recovered faster as predicted by the Theory of Island Biogeography. The effect of island size was not tested, since all islands were of approximately equal size.

Research conducted at the rainforest research station on [[Barro Colorado Island]] has yielded a large number of publications concerning the ecological changes following the formation of islands, such as the local extinction of large predators and the subsequent changes in prey populations.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

== Applications in conservation biology ==

Within a few years of the publishing of the theory, its potential application to the field of [[conservation biology]] had been realised and was being vigorously debated in [[ecology|ecological]] circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Lomolino |first=Mark V. |title=A Call for a New Paradigm of Island Biogeography |work=Global Ecology and Biogeography: A Journal of Macroecology |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=1–6 |date=January 2000 |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2699.2000.00185.x/abstract |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.2000.00185.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea that reserves and [[national park]]s formed islands inside human-altered landscapes ([[habitat fragmentation]]), and that these reserves could lose species as they 'relaxed towards equilibrium' (that is they would lose species as they achieved their new equilibrium number, known as ecosystem decay) caused a great deal of concern. This is particularly true when conserving larger species which tend to have larger ranges. A study by William Newmark, published in the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] and reported in the [[New York Times]], showed a strong [[correlation]] between the size of a protected [[United States|U.S.]] National Park and the number of species of mammals.

This led to the debate known as [[SLOSS debate|single large or several small]] (SLOSS), described by writer [[David Quammen]] in ''The Song of the Dodo'' as "ecology's own genteel version of trench warfare".&lt;ref name = "Quammen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Quammen |first=David |title=The Song of the Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinctions |publisher=Scribner |year=1996 |isbn=0-684-80083-7 |page=446}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years after the publication of Wilson and Simberloff's papers ecologists had found more examples of the species-area relationship, and conservation planning was taking the view that the one large reserve could hold more species than several smaller reserves, and that larger reserves should be the norm in [[reserve design]]. This view was in particular championed by [[Jared Diamond]]. This led to concern by other ecologists, including Dan Simberloff, who considered this to be an unproven over-simplification that would damage conservation efforts. Habitat diversity was as or more important than size in determining the number of species protected.

Island biogeography theory also led to the development of [[wildlife corridor]]s as a conservation tool to increase connectivity between habitat islands. Wildlife corridors can increase the movement of species between parks and reserves and therefore increase the number of species that can be supported, but they can also allow for the spread of disease and pathogens between populations, complicating the simple proscription of connectivity being good for biodiversity.

In species diversity, island biogeography most describes [[allopatric speciation]]. Allopatric speciation is where new gene pools arise out of natural selection in isolated gene pools. Island biogeography is also useful in considering [[sympatric speciation]], the idea of different species arising from one ancestral species in the same area. Interbreeding between the two differently adapted species would prevent speciation, but in some species, sympatric speciation appears to have occurred.

'''Nanoscale iron particles''' are sub-micrometer particles of [[iron]] metal. They are highly [[Chemical reaction|reactive]] because of their large surface area. In the presence of oxygen and water, they rapidly [[oxidize]] to form free iron [[ion]]s. They are widely used in medical and laboratory applications and have also been studied for remediation of industrial sites contaminated with chlorinated organic compounds.
== Synthesis ==
Iron nanoparticles can be synthesized by the reduction of Fe(II) or Fe(III) salt with [[sodium borohydride]] in an aqueous medium.


[[File:Reduction of Fe(III).gif]]

== Reactivity ==
When exposed to oxygen and water, iron oxidizes. This [[redox]] process can occur under either [[acid]]ic or neutral/[[Base (chemistry)|basic]] conditions:

:2 Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(s) + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) → 2 Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l)

: Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(s) + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (aq) → Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) + 2 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq)

==Research==
Research has shown that nanoscale iron particles can be effectively used to treat several forms of [[ground contamination]], including grounds contaminated by [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs), chlorinated organic solvents, and [[organochlorine]] pesticides.  Nanoscale iron particle are easily transportable through ground water, allowing for [[In_situ#Biology|in situ]] treatment.  Additionally, the nanoparticle-water slurry can be injected into the contaminated area and stay there for long periods of time.&lt;ref name="Zhang"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zhang |first=Wei-xian |year=2003 |title=Nanoscale iron particles for environmental remediation: an overview |journal=[[Journal of Nanoparticle Research]] |volume=5 |pages=323–332 |doi=10.1023/A:1025520116015 |issue=3/4|bibcode=2003JNR.....5..323Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors combine to make this method of cheaper than most currently used alternative.

Researchers have found that although metallic iron nanoparticles remediate contaminants well, they tend to agglomerate on the soil surfaces.  In response, [[carbon nanoparticles]] and water-soluble [[polyelectrolyte]]s have been used as supports to the metallic iron nanoparticles.  The [[hydrophobic]] contaminants adsorb to these supports, improving permeability in sand and soil.&lt;ref name="Zhang"/&gt;

In field tests have generally confirmed lab findings.  However, research is still ongoing and nanoscale iron particles are not yet commonly used for treating ground contamination.

'''John Hooker''' (or "Hoker") ''alias'' '''John Vowell''' (c. 1527–1601) of [[Exeter]] in Devon, was an English historian, writer, solicitor, [[antiquary]], and civic administrator. From 1555 to his death he was [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] of Exeter. He was twice [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Exeter (UK Parliament constituency)|Exeter]] in 1570/1 and 1586, and for [[Athenry]] in Ireland in 1569 and wrote an influential treatise on parliamentary procedure. He wrote an eye-witness account of the siege of Exeter during the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]] in 1549.  He spent several years in Ireland as legal adviser to Sir [[Peter Carew (died 1575)|Peter Carew]], and following Carew's death in 1575 wrote his biography. He was one of the editors of the second edition of [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''[[Holinshed's Chronicles|Chronicles]]'', published in 1587. His last, unpublished and probably uncompleted work was the first topographical description of the county of Devon. He founded a guild of [[Company of Merchant Adventurers of Exeter|Merchant Adventurers]] under a charter from Queen Mary.&lt;ref&gt;Hooker, Joseph Dalton, Life and Letters of Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker O.M., G.C.S.I., 2001, p.7 [https://books.google.com/books?id=tpTKKP7Z7xAC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=hurst+castle+hooker&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2XS8f3xnOR&amp;sig=fXv_DrDBOSFlKk0210f8G6UTAhI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=M475UvaaHOzA7AbSpYHYAw&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=hurst%20castle%20hooker&amp;f=false]

==Origins==
Hooker was born at Bourbridge Hall in [[Exeter, England|Exeter]], Devon, England. He was the second son and eventual heir of Robert Vowell (d.1538) of Exeter&lt;ref name="Vivian, p.479"&gt;Vivian, p.479&lt;/ref&gt; ''alias'' Hooker by his third wife Agnes Dobell (or Doble), daughter of John Dobell of [[Woodbridge, Suffolk|Woodbridge]] in Suffolk.&lt;ref&gt;Vivian, Lt.Col. J.L., (Ed.) The Visitations of the County of Devon: Comprising the Heralds' Visitations of 1531, 1564 &amp; 1620, Exeter, 1895, p.479, pedigree of Hooker ''alias'' Vowell&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather was John Vowell ''alias'' Hooker (d.1493), MP for [[Exeter (UK Parliament constituency)|Exeter]].&lt;ref name="Vivian, p.479"/&gt;

The earliest recorded member of the Vowell family was Jenaph (or Seraph&lt;ref name="Hooker, Joseph Dalton, 2001, p7"&gt;Hooker, Joseph Dalton, 2001, p7&lt;/ref&gt;) Vowell of [[Pembroke, Pembrokeshire|Pembroke]] in Wales, from whom John Hooker (d.1601) was 6th in descent. The original Welsh name was possibly ''ap-Howell''.&lt;ref name="Hooker, Joseph Dalton, 2001, p7"/&gt; Jenaph's son Jago Vowell married Alice Hooker, daughter and heiress of Richard Hooker of [[Hurst Castle]], Southampton.&lt;ref name="Vivian, p.479"/&gt; Thus, as was commonly required in former times on receipt of an inheritance, the Vowell family assumed the name Hooker in the 15th century, but frequently retained the earlier name; in fact John Hooker was known as John Vowell for much of his life. By the time he was born the family had been prominent in Exeter for several generations.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

==Education==
Hooker received an excellent [[Classics|classical]] education, reading Roman law at Oxford followed by a period in Europe studying with leading Protestant divines,&lt;ref name="You"&gt;{{Cite book

==Career==

===In Exeter===
{{Quote box|quote=[I denounce those who chose] to supporte the authoritie of the Idoll of Rome whome they never sawe in contempte of their trewe &amp; lawfull kinge, whom they knewe and oughte to obeye.|source=—Hooker, on the siege of Exeter, in ''The description of the citie of Excester'', 1.67|align=right|width=25%}}
[[File:Exeter, 1563.jpg|thumb|right|A map of Exeter in the time of Hooker]]
During the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]] of 1549 Hooker experienced at first hand the siege of Exeter, and left a vivid manuscript account of its events in which he made no effort to conceal his anti-Catholic sympathies.&lt;ref name="You"/&gt; From 1551 to 1553 he was employed by [[Myles Coverdale]] during his short incumbency as [[Bishop of Exeter]]. In 1555 he became the first [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] of Exeter, a post he held until his death.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

As chamberlain he was responsible for the city's finances, he dealt with disputes between guilds and merchants, oversaw the rebuilding of the high school, planted many trees in the city, and collected and put in order the city's archives.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt; He used these archives to compile his "Annals" of the City in which he details the characteristics of every Tudor mayor of Exeter, and in 1578 he wrote and published ''The Lives of the Bishops of Exeter''.&lt;ref name="You"/&gt; In 1570/71 he was MP for Exeter.

At a time when it was deemed essential for cities and nations to have ancient lineage, Hooker described the supposed foundation of Exeter by Corinaeus, nephew of [[Brutus of Britain]], son of [[Aeneas]]. He advocated emulating the governmental institutions of the Roman Republic, which in his opinion brought Rome to greatness, and held up the municipal government of Exeter as a model republican commonwealth worthy of emulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===In Ireland===
In 1568, possibly because he regarded himself as underpaid for the work he was doing for Exeter, Hooker was persuaded by Sir [[Peter Carew (died 1575)|Peter Carew]] to accompany him to Ireland as his legal adviser. He organised Carew's papers in support of his claim for the barony of Idrone, a task to which he committed himself so deeply that in 1569 he was returned to the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish parliament]] as member for [[Athenry (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Athenry]]. Hooker later wrote a biography of Carew, ''The dyscourse and dyscoverye of the lyffe of Sir Peter Carew'', in which he almost certainly understated the deceit and aggression behind Carew's Irish venture.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Until Carew's death in 1575, Hooker spent much time in Ireland, but he had also been returned to the English parliament in 1571 as one of the [[burgess (title)|burgess]]es of Exeter. The session had lasted only a few weeks, but he kept a journal in which he accurately recorded the proceedings. His experiences in the Irish and English parliaments led him to write a treatise on parliamentary practice, ''The Order and Usage how to Keepe a Parlement in England'', which was published in two editions in 1572. One edition had a preface addressed to [[William FitzWilliam (Lord Deputy)|William FitzWilliam]], [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]] and was clearly intended to bring order to the Irish assembly; the other was addressed to the Exeter city authorities, presumably to aid his successor burgesses. In writing his treatise Hooker took much inspiration from the [[Modus Tenendi Parliamentum]], a treatise from the early 14th century.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

In 1586 Hooker again represented Exeter in parliament. At this time he was one of the editors of the second edition of [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''Chronicles'', published in 1587. Hooker's ''Order and Usage'' was included within it and he contributed an updated history of Ireland, with parts of his ''Life of Carew'' and a translation of ''Expugnatio Hibernica'' ("Conquest of Ireland") by [[Gerald of Wales]]. In his Irish section he made his religious and political sympathies very clear, repeatedly denouncing the Catholicism of the native Irish, seeing it as the cause both of their poverty and rebelliousness. Rome he described as "the pestilent [[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]]" and the pope "the sonne of sathan, and the manne of sinne, and the enimie unto the crosse of Christ, whose bloodthirstiness will never be quenched".&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

===Later life===
{{Quote box|quote=a verye ancient towne ... and maye be equall with some cities for it is the cheffe emporium of that countrie and most inhabited with merchantes whose cheffest trade in tyme of peace was with Spayne ... it is a clene and sweete towne, very well paved...|source=—Hooker, on Barnstaple, in ''Synopsis Corographical, 261–262''|align=right|width=25%}}
Hooker continued to serve Exeter in his later years, becoming [[coroner]] in 1583 and [[Recorder (legal office)|recorder]] in 1590. He was also appointed as [[Steward (office)|steward]] of [[Bradninch]] by Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] in 1587.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt; By this time he was involved in the long task of organising and writing his historically-based description of his home county which he titled ''Synopsis Corographical of the county of Devon''. He probably started work on this before his antiquary friend [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew]] began writing his similar ''Survey of Cornwall''.&lt;ref name="You"/&gt; In writing his ''Synopsis'', Hooker was influenced by the style and structure of [[William Harrison (clergyman)|William Harrison's]] ''Description of England'', which had been published in 1577 as part of the first edition of Holinshed's ''Chronicles''.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

Although Hooker revised his ''Synopsis'' many times, he probably never completed it to his satisfaction. The work survives today as two almost identical manuscripts, one in the [[British Library]] the other in the [[Devon Record Office]],&lt;ref&gt;One, dated 1599/1600, is in the British Library; the other (ex-libris [[John Prince (Totnes)|John Prince]]) is dated 1599 and is in the [[Devon Record Office]]. An extract of the British Library copy was published in {{Cite journal

==Marriage &amp; progeny==
He married twice:
*Firstly in the 1540s to married Martha Tucker (died pre-1586), a daughter of Robert Tucker of Exeter by whom he had three sons and two daughters including:
**Robert Hooker (d.1602) eldest son.&lt;ref name="Vivian 1531, p.479"&gt;[[John Lambrick Vivian|Vivian, Lt.Col. J.L.]], (Ed.) The Visitations of the County of Devon: Comprising the  [[Heraldic visitation|Heralds' Visitations]] of 1531, 1564 &amp; 1620, Exeter, 1895, p.479&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Secondly he married Anastryce Bridgeman (c. 1540–1599), a daughter of [[Edward Bridgeman]] of Exeter,&lt;ref name="Vivian 1531, p.479"/&gt; by whom he had seven sons and five daughters.

==Death &amp; burial==
In later life his health failed. He wrote: "...my sight waxeth Dymme my hyringe [hearing] very thycke my speache imperfecte and my memory very feeble". He died in Exeter on 8 November 1601 at the age of 76 and was buried at St Mary Major, Exeter.&lt;ref&gt;Vivian, p.479, quoting St Mary Major, Exeter, parish register; Dictionary of National Biography suggests he died at some time between 26 January and 15 September in 1601 and was "probably buried in the cathedral".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kipu Falls''' is a [[waterfall]] in East Kauai, [[Hawaii]].

Kipu Falls has a dangerous reputation due to [[drowning]] deaths of five people in a five-year span, as well as numerous other injuries. Due to the drowning deaths, Grove Farms Company, which owns the land where the falls are located, decided to block off the access route. From a legal perspective, visitors were [[trespassing]], as the falls were not actually open to the public. Injuries became more prevalent after guide books began publicizing the falls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/19/kipu-falls-hawaii-swimming-hole_n_903502.html | title=Kipu Falls, Hawaii Swimming Hole, Is A Deadly Tourist Trap | date=September 18, 2011 | publisher=Associated Press | accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/15328936/owner-of-deadly-kauai-swimming-hole-blocks-access | title=Kauai's popular Kipu Falls fenced-off | publisher=Hawaii News Now | year=2011 | first=Brooks | last=Baehr | accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Central Park on foggy night.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Central Park]] on a foggy night]]
'''Landscape lighting''' or '''garden lighting''' refers to the use of outdoor [[lighting|illumination]] of private [[garden]]s and public [[landscape]]s; for the enhancement and purposes of safety, nighttime [[aesthetic]]s, [[accessibility]], security, [[recreation]] and [[sport]]s, and social and event uses.

==History==
The public [[landscape]] and [[garden]]s have been [[Lighting|illuminated]] for as long as interior [[building|structures]] have - for beauty, security, [[Circulation (architecture)|circulation]], and social occasions; since ancient times by firelight from wood, [[candle]]s, and animal-[[plant oil]] fells in [[torch]]es, [[Sconce (light fixture)|sconces]] and [[lantern]]s. Since the 17th century's introductions of new interior illumination fuels, the technology has then been used outdoors and in gardens. As systems were developed for power delivery, [[Gas lighting]] of the 19th century and [[electric light]] of the 20th century became part of exterior functioning and design.&lt;ref name="landscape"&gt;The Landscape Lighting Book {{ISBN|0-471-45136-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current==
Conventionally generated and sourced [[electricity]] remains the most used source for landscape lighting in the early twenty-first century.&lt;!---?-{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}-?---&gt; With the combination of increasing demand for more efficient lighting, increasing availability of [[sustainable design]]s, [[global warming]] considerations, and aesthetic and safety concerns in [[garden design|garden]] and [[landscape design]] the methods and equipment of outdoor illumination have been evolving. The increasing use of LEDs, [[solar power]], [[low voltage]] fixtures, energy efficient lamps, and energy-saving [[lighting design]] are examples of innovation in the field.&lt;ref name="landscape"/&gt;

==Power sources==
Landscape lighting can be powered by:&lt;ref name="landscape"/&gt;
* Conventional electricity-based  fixtures: Fixed post, wall-mounted, free-hanging, in-grade,  tree-mounted, stake-mounted, stationary, and movable
** Line voltage: 120V - [[light bulbs]], [[compact fluorescent lamps|compact fluorescent lamps-bulbs]], custom [[neon lamp]]s
** [[Extra-low voltage]]: 12V  - light bulbs, [[fiber optics]]
* Solar source electricity based fixtures:
** On each fixture - [[photovoltaics]] - light bulbs
** From property's [[solar panel]] system - lighting fixtures, fiber optics
* [[Rechargeable battery|Rechargeable]] [[electrical battery|battery]] fixtures: Table top lanterns, LED candles
*Other:
** Natural gas - fixed post lamps and wall lanterns, flex-connection fixtures
** Propane - table top portable lanterns, flex-connection fixtures
** Oil fuels - [[hurricane lamp]]s, 'camping lanterns'
** [[Fire]]-based flame - pernazzle lanterns, [[outdoor fireplace]]s, [[chimineas]], fire bowls, "tiki-torches"

==Lighting components==
There are many different types of landscape lighting systems, controls and switching, wiring connections, fixture types, functions-purposes-styles, and light sources.
:Components can include:

: "I'd rather do wrong to others than allow them to do wrong to me!"
: [A remark made by Cao Cao in 189 after he killed Lü Boshe's family by mistake while he was on his way to Chenliu (陳留; around present-day [[Kaifeng]], [[Henan]]). The exact words in this quote were altered in the historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]''. See the article on [[Lü Boshe]] for details.]&lt;ref&gt;(孫盛雜記曰： ... 旣而悽愴曰：「寧我負人，毋人負我！」) ''Zaji'' annotation in ''[[Sanguozhi]]'' vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confucius===
[[Confucius]] (孔夫子; Kǒng Fū Zǐ, lit. "''Master Kong,''" but most frequently referred to as '''Kongzi''' (孔子), traditionally 551 &amp;ndash; 479 BCE) was a famous Chinese thinker and social philosopher, whose teachings have deeply influenced East Asian life and thought.
;十五向學,三十而立,四十而不惑,五十而知天命,六十而耳順,七十而從心欲，不踰矩.
:Shí wǔ xiàng xué, sān shí érlì, sì shí ér bùhuò, wǔ shí ér zhī tiānmìng, liù shí ér ěrshùn, qī shí ér cóng xīn yù, bù yú ju.
:"At fifteen, I aspired to learning. At thirty, I established my stand. At forty, I had no delusions. At fifty, I knew my destiny. At sixty, I knew truth in all I heard. At seventy, I could follow the wishes of my heart without doing wrong."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.confucius.org/lunyu/ed0204.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

:Xue er shi xi zhi, bu yi yue hu?
:"To learn and to practice what is learned time and again is pleasure, is it not?" (Beginning sentence of the [[Analects]])&lt;ref&gt;http://www.confucius.org/lunyu/ed0101.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

;有朋自远方来，不亦乐乎？

==D==

Deng never held office as the head of state or the head of government, but served as the ''[[de facto]]'' leader of the People's Republic of China from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. He pioneered "[[Socialism with Chinese characteristics]]" and [[Chinese economic reform]], also known as the "[[socialist market economy]]".

;不管黑猫白猫，捉到老鼠就是好猫。
:Buguan hei mao bai mao, zhuo dao laoshu jiu shi hao mao.
: "No matter if it is a white cat or a black cat; as long as it can catch mice, it is a good cat."
(Source: From a speech in a meeting of the Secretariat, actually a [[Sichuan]] proverb)

;实事求是。
:Shí shì qiú shì
:[[Seek truth from facts]]
:(Actually coined by [[Mao Zedong]], but never really effectively used until Deng's time. This is a slogan referring to pragmatism. Beginning in the late 1970s, it was promoted by Deng Xiaoping and is a part of the official ideology of [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics]]. The phrase means to look for economic and political solutions that have practical application rather than those based on political ideology.)

;一部分先富起来。
:Yibufen xian fuqilai.
: Some must get rich first!
:(The first reforms in the late 1970s and early 1980s consisted of opening trade with the outside world, instituting the household responsibility system in agriculture, by which farmers could sell their surplus crops on the open market, and the establishment of township village enterprises.)

;一国两制
:yì guó liǎng zhì
:[[One country, two systems]]
(Also coined by Mao Zedong. This idea was later proposed by Deng Xiaoping during the early 1980s for the reunification of China. He suggested that there will be only one China, but areas such as Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan can have their own capitalist economical and political systems, while mainland China uses the "socialist" system.)

His story is told in the chapter entitled ''Biography of the Assassins'' (刺客列傳) in [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', or ''Shiji''.
reportedly shouted out this impromptu poem after a cup of wine with friends: " (
;风潇潇兮，易水寒，壮士一去兮不复返!

;道可道﹐非常道；名可名，非常名。
:Dao ke dao, fei chang dao; ming ke ming, fei chang ming.

;东方红
:Dōngfāng hóng
:[[The East Is Red (song)|The East Is Red]]
:(A song that was the de facto anthem of the People's Republic of China during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s. The lyrics of the song were attributed to, Li Youyuan, a farmer from northern Shaanxi, and the melody was from a local folk song. He allegedly got his inspiration upon seeing the rising sun in the morning of a sunny day.

==M==

===Mao Zedong===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Little red book.jpg|thumb|[[Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong|The Little Red Book]]]] --&gt;
[[Mao Zedong]] (1893 &amp;ndash; 1976) (also ''Mao Tse-Tung'' in [[Wade-Giles]]) was Chairman of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CCP) from 1945 until his death. He instigated several major socio-political programmes (some through [[collectivisation]]), including the [[Anti-Rightist Movement|Anti-Rightist Campaign]], the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]].
;百花齊放，百家爭鳴
:Bǎihuā qífàng, bǎijiā zhēngmíng.
: "Let a hundred flowers bloom; let a hundred schools of thought contend."
:( Mao had used this to signal what he had wanted from the intellectuals of the country, for different and competing ideologies to voice their opinions about the issues of the day.)

;一切反动派都是纸老虎。
:Yiqie fandongpai dou shi zhi laohu.
:”All Reactionaries are Paper Tigers.“
:([[Paper tiger]] is a literal English translation of the Chinese phrase zhǐ lǎohǔ (Chinese: 紙老虎), meaning something which seems as threatening as a tiger, but is really harmless. The phrase is an ancient one in Chinese, but sources differ as to when it entered the English vocabulary. Although some sources may claim it dates back as far as 1850 [1], it seems the Chinese phrase was first translated when it was applied to describe the United States. In 1956, Mao Zedong said of the United States:
:”In appearance it is very powerful but in reality it is nothing to be afraid of; it is a paper tiger. Outwardly a tiger, it is made of paper, unable to withstand the wind and the rain. I believe the United States is nothing but a paper tiger.”

; 枪杆子里面出政权
:Qiangganzi limian chu zhengquan.
:"Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."
:(The gun is here a metaphor for the military. Mao believed that “''the gun must never be allowed to command the Party''").

===Mozi===
[[Mozi]] {{zh|c=墨子|p=Mòzǐ|w='''Mo Tzu'''}}, [[Latinization (literature)|Lat.]] as '''Micius''', c. 470 BCE&amp;ndash;c. 390 BCE), was a [[philosopher]] who lived in [[China]] during the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] period (early [[Warring States period]]). He founded the school of [[Mohism]] and argued strongly against [[Confucianism]] and [[Daoism]]. During the [[Warring States period]], [[Mohism]] was actively developed and practiced in many states, but fell out of favour when the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalist]] [[Qin Dynasty]] came to power.
;視人之國若視其國，視人之家若視其家，視人之身若視其身。
:Shi ren zhi guo ruo shi qi guo, shi ren zhi jia shi qi jia, shi ren zhi shen ruo qi shen.
:“They look at the states of others as if they were their own states; they look at the families of others as if they were their own families; they look at others as if they were themselves.”

==S==

===Sun Yatsen===
[[Sun Yat-sen]] ({{zh|孫逸仙}}; November 12, 1866&amp;ndash;March 12, 1925) was a [[China|Chinese]] [[revolutionary]] and political leader often referred to as the “[[Father of the Nation|father of modern China]]”. Sun is highly regarded as the National Father of modern China. His political philosophy, known as the [[Three Principles of the People]], was proclaimed in August 1905.
;三民主義
:Sānmínzhǔyì
:Three Principles of the People
:(The Three People's Principles, or collectively ''San-min Doctrine'', is a political philosophy as part of a program to make China a free, prosperous, and powerful nation. Its legacy of implementation is most apparent in the governmental organization of the [[Republic of China]]. The principles also appear in the first line of the [[National Anthem of the Republic of China]]: 三民主義，吾黨所宗，/ 以建民國，以進大同。. Sānmín Zhǔyì, wú dǎng suǒ zōng, / Yǐ jiàn Mínguó, yǐ jìn Dàtóng.

:The World is for all.

===Tan Daoji===
[[Tan Daoji]] (檀道濟; (died 436) was a high level general of the dynasty Liu Song. He was one of the most respected generals during the Southern and Northern Dynasties era. Because of this, however, he was feared by Emperor Wen and even more so by Emperor Wen's brother, the prime minister Liu Yikang, and during an illness of Emperor Wen, Liu Yikang had Tan arrested and executed on false accusations of treason. Tan was said to have had [[Thirty-Six Strategies]]. 
;隔岸觀火。
:Gé àn guān huǒ
:Watch the fires burning from across the river
:(Delay entering the field of battle until all the other players have become exhausted fighting amongst themselves.)

;借刀殺人。
:Jiè dāo shā rén.
:Kill with a borrowed knife
:(Attack using the strength of another)

==W==

===Wang Xizhi===
[[Wang Xizhi]] (王羲之) (303 - 361) was a [[Chinese calligrapher]], traditionally referred to as the "Sage of Calligraphy" (書聖). 
His most famous work is the [[wikisource:Preface to the Poems Composed at the Orchid Pavilion|"Preface to the Poems Composed at the Orchid Pavilion"]] ({{zh|c=[[Wiktionary:兰亭序|兰亭序]]|p=Lán Tíng Xù}}), the preface of a collection of poems written by a number of poets when [[Orchid Pavilion Gathering|gathering at Lanting]] near the town of Shaoxing for the [[Xiuxi|Spring Purification Festival]]. The original is lost, but there  are a number of fine tracing copies and rubbings.
;後之視今，亦由今之視昔。
:Hòu zhī shì jīn, yì yóu jīn zhī shì xí.
: When future generations look back to my time, it will probably be similar to how I now think of the past.

==X==

===Xunzi===
[[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]] (荀子; born Zhao c. 310–237 BCE) was a Chinese philosopher who lived during the Warring States Period, and was part of the during the Hundred Schools of Thought.
;人之性、惡；其善，偽也。
:Ren zhi xing ĕ; qi shan wei ye.
:Human nature is evil, and goodness is caused by intentional activity.
:(Xunzi  thought that man is prone to evil dispositions, and that ethical norms had been invented to avoid this.)

==Z==

===Zhuangzi===
[[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]] (pinyin), Chuang Tzŭ (Wade-Giles), Chuang Tsu, Zhuang Tze, or Chuang Tse (Traditional Chinese characters: 莊子; Simplified Chinese characters: 庄子, literally meaning "Master Zhuang") was a famous philosopher in ancient China who lived around the 4th century BCE during the Warring States Period, corresponding to the Hundred Schools of Thought philosophical summit of Chinese thought. Another well-known part of the book, which is also found in Chapter 2, is usually called "Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly".
;莊周夢蝶
:Zhuāng Zhōu mèng dié
:"Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly"
:(昔者庄周梦为胡蝶，栩栩然胡蝶也。自喻适志与！不知周也。俄然觉，则蘧蘧然周也。不知周之梦为胡蝶与？胡蝶之梦为周与？周与胡蝶则必有分矣。此之谓物化。
:“Once Zhuang Zhou dreamt he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting and fluttering around, happy with himself and doing as he pleased. He didn't know he was Zhuang Zhou. Suddenly he woke up and there he was, solid and unmistakable Zhuang Zhou. But he didn't know if he was Zhuang Zhou who had dreamt he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he was Zhuang Zhou. Between Zhuang Zhou and a butterfly there must be some distinction! This is called the Transformation of Things.”
:Translated by [[Burton Watson]] 1968. The name of the passage has become a common Chinese idiom, and has spread into Western languages as well. It appears, inter alia, as an illustration in [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' famous essay "''A New Refutation of Time''", and may have inspired [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s 1918 short story "Polaris".)

[[File:Serven Khaalga Jurchen inscription.jpg|thumb|300px|Rock inscription in Jurchen dated 1196 at Serven Khaalga, Bayankhutag, Mongolia.  The inscription relates to Genghis Khan's alliance with the Jin against the Tatars.]]
The '''list of Jurchen inscriptions''' comprises a list of the corpus of known inscriptions written in the [[Jurchen language]] using the [[Jurchen script]].  There are ten monumental inscriptions, mostly dating to the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]], but the latest monument dates to the early [[Ming Dynasty]] (1413).  There are also a number of short Jurchen inscriptions on portable artefacts such as mirrors, [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] and [[paiza]]. In contrast with [[List of Khitan inscriptions|inscriptions in Khitan scripts]], there are no known examples of stone-inscribed epitaphs in the Jurchen script.

{{for|the list of episodes of the 1968-77 BBC series|List of The Morecambe &amp; Wise Show (1968 TV series) episodes}}

This is an episode summary of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[TV comedy]] show ''[[The Morecambe &amp; Wise Show (1978 TV series)|The Morecambe and Wise Show]]'', starring [[Morecambe and Wise]]. This was the second show of this title to feature the pair, and was broadcast for a total of four series and seven specials between 1978 and 1983.

| ShortSummary    = No series was made in 1978 in an effort to make the Christmas Show stronger, but there was one hour-long offering (the same length as the [[BBC]] shows had been, but with adverts).  This opened with a sequence whereby a lorry with a [[BBC]] logo emblazoned on its side, appears at [[Thames Television]]'s studios, the back doors are flung open, and [[Eric Morecambe]] and [[Ernie Wise]] are thrown out, in a direct nod to the bad feeling that was present at the time the partnership had departed their previous employers.  The format remained reasonably faithful to that used previously although [[Eddie Braben]] did not join them immediately.  There's the familiar end-of-show play "What Ern Wrote", this time it is a pastiche of ''Dr Jekyll &amp; Mrs Hyde'': however, there is a more cinematic feel to the parody and it moves beyond the confines of being a single set stage piece. There is also a pet shop sketch with the ''"Will he come out for a bit of [[Kit Kat]]?"'' line, itself a nod to the fact the duo were now on commercial television. The show closes with ''Walkin' in the Sunshine'' rather than ''Bring Me Sunshine''.  The episode is available on DVD as part of a Thames TV set released in March 2008.

| ShortSummary    = The show opens with Morecambe being stuck on one side of the stage with his suit on the other, resorting to increasingly absurd ways to cross the stage, whilst Wise reads out messages from Christmas cards received by the duo.  The line-up for this first Thames Christmas Show featured several guest stars. A spoof dance routine featuring 'Anna Ford' opened the show, but since Ford herself had refused to appear, a stand in was used, with camera angles and slapstick comedy carefully concealing her face. [[Leonard Rossiter]] provided the third [[The Andrews Sisters|Andrews Sister]] in a "Fabulous Forties" segment; and a spoof ''This Is Your Life'' with the Royal Family opening the show. Former Labour Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] made a surprise appearance, though this was leaked in the press in advance. In one sequence, Wilson manages to upset Morecambe by joking about his beloved Luton Town Football Club; Morecambe then disappears to the back of the flat, returning with a ''Maggie Rules O.K.'' banner, a reference to Conservative opposition leader [[Margaret Thatcher]] (who would become Prime Minister the following year).  The show was written by [[Barry Cryer]] and [[John Junkin]] (who also make cameo appearances) with [[Eddie Braben]] still under contract to the BBC until the following year. The show closes with a song and dance routine rather than ''Bring Me Sunshine''

| ShortSummary    = This was the only television programme the duo made in this year, with Morecambe's heart attack ensuing a lull in their activities.  To a certain extent, the duo's output was seen to be "playing it safe" by bringing back safe and established guest stars and this edition saw the return of actress [[Glenda Jackson]] and the inevitable [[Des O'Connor]] as well as newcomer to the show, [[David Frost]], who interviewed the duo about their long career.  The show was more of an interview on the whole, but there was some newly made material, the stand-out section being a mimed version of the novelty song ''I Tawt I Taw A Puddy Tat'' with Morecambe as the mischievous Sylvester the cat and Wise as Tweety Pie.  Harking back to the duo's previous incarnation at the [[BBC]] the programme also featured [[Arthur Tolcher]] (not now, Arthur!) and [[Janet Webb]] who had appeared at the end of their show ten years previously as "the lady who comes down at the end."  The show played heavily on the pair's previous success with their festive programmes, and further cemented their relationship with the viewing public by appearing despite Morecambe's poor health.  As a joke on his recent heart by-pass operation, Morecambe was not permitted to descend the staircase in the studio and this duty was performed by [[Garfield Morgan]].  However, when Morecambe did appear, he ran up and down the same staircase several times to prove his fitness.  When united with Wise the pair embraced and stated how good it was to be back together again.  They returned to form the following year with another full series, their first since 1976.

| ShortSummary    =  The traditional opening spot sees Wise attempting to present Ern's Gala Night only to be interrupted by Morecambe who appears dressed as an explorer. This is followed by a sketch featuring a remote control on the television and a Mastermind parody. A Songs Of The Highlands skit follows, then an MI6 sketch on a park bench. A spoof tobacco advert is followed by a flat-based sketch which is largely a re-hash of a routine done with Cliff Richard some years earlier with the BBC although there are updates; notably, the production number at the end of the sketch is different, being Painting The Clouds With Sunshine and closing with Wogan accompanying Wise to sing Bring Me Sunshine to be interrupted by Morecambe.

| ShortSummary    = The opening sketch sees Wise again attempting to perform a song to be interrupted by Morecambe as a "Hell's Grandad" (a rehash of the BBC sketch featuring "Spick Sparkle". This is followed by a guest spot by Hannah Gordon who performs the Banana Boat Song (again reusing material from a BBC sketch featuring Nina. This is followed by a spoof bell-ringing short, and a flat sketch with the "fellow writer" is directly copied from a previous BBC incarnation too. Only the nature of the comedy in this sketch have dated it somewhat, with stereotypical allusions to homosexuality. Gordon then accompanies Wise to perform Bring Me Sunshine only to be interrupted by Morecambe once again as the credits roll.

There is then a new sketch set in a Chinese Restaurant and a spoof interview "Focus On The Arts". A doctors' surgery sketch in which Morecambe has lost his voice follows, closing with a two-handed flat-based sketch focusing on reading material; Wise performs Bring Me Sunshine to close, again interrupted by Morecambe who tries to fight his way through the curtain tabs which are sealed.

This is followed by a hotel reception sketch where Morecambe attempt to check into Wise's hotel and a short skit where the duo play the card game snap. Morecambe then attempts a ventriloquist act with disastrous results.. This episode features a flat-based sketch where a local vicar turns out to be a champion spoon and washboard champion. In line with other programmes in this series, Guyler plays the drums to the signature tune Bring Me Sunshine with Wise, whilst Morecambe "goes and waits for the bus" only to disturb the song.

A travel agent sketch featuring Morecambe's largely mute wife follows. With further reworkings from the BBC era the flat sketch features a budding writer character (the BBC routine featured a character that Morecambe refers to as "Miss Flanagan &amp; Allen", and The pay-off to the flat-based sketch sees sit-com star Tessa Wyatt appear and she also performs the final song with Wise, whilst Morecambe again disappears only to re-appear and disrupt the proceedings.

| ShortSummary    =  In another re-working of a popular BBC routine, Morecambe appears as Mr. Fantastic (the BBC version having been Mr. Memory). A short window cleaner sketch is followed by another BBC reworking as a Foreign Legion spoof. The flat sketch again re-uses material where Wise has employed an au pair girl with predicable results; Gemma Craven features in this sketch and then joins Wise in another Gene Kelly recreation, this time to an arrangement of "Bring Me Sunshine" as a pastiche of An American In Paris whilst Morecambe interrupts the proceedings in usual riotous style bringing chaos to the routine to Wise's chagrin.

The show closed with the signature tune Bring Me Sunshine.

| ProdCode        = 16.65m &lt;ref name="digitalspy.co.uk1"/&gt;
| ShortSummary    = This show marked in some ways the fact that [[Morecambe &amp; Wise]] were no longer a prime asset; it was the first time in their television careers that their festive offering had not been broadcast on Christmas Night, the schedulers opting instead for 23 December. This was also because, until 1982, Thames Television only operated from Monday at 9.25am until Friday at 7pm; as Christmas Day fell on a Friday, [[London Weekend Television]] (LWT) held the franchise to broadcast that evening - in fact, Morecambe actually references the fact the show is not on Christmas Day within one of the sketches, gaining a round of applause from the studio audience. The guest list was nonetheless impressive with [[Ralph Richardson]] heading up a stellar list, [[Suzanne Danielle]] doing a ''Razzle Dazzle'' routine with the boys (and including future assistant on ''[[The Generation Game]]'' - [[Rosemary Ford]] - in the dance troupe), a re-hash of the [[BBC]] health food shop routine, now featuring Valerie Minfie, and the obligatory play, which was ''Julius Caesar'', a thinly covered remake of the popular [[BBC]] sketch ''Antony &amp; Cleopatra'' from ten years earlier featuring [[Ian Ogilvy]]. This show saw M&amp;W use technology more to gain laughs with blue screen techniques being used in some sketches, and ends with Bring Me Sunshine by the duo

| ShortSummary    = Returning from the previous seasonal show was [[All Creatures Great and Small (TV series)|''All Creatures Great &amp; Small'']] star Robert Hardy, joined by both Rula Lenska and Richard Vernon who had appeared in previous shows; the opening routine perhaps prophetically discussed the retiring of the double act but this in itself was a further reworking of BBC material but somehow the pace of the dialogue was becoming lost. In an update of several older sketches, the Video Shop was offered as well as a Lingerie Shop and a ''[[Chattanooga Choo Choo]]'' routine. The closing play was the ''Yukon Gold Rush'' and featured Rula Lenska in another reworking of a BBC idea.  Notable of this and many other shows was the absence of the favourite signature tune over the end credits. Again, this show was not broadcast on Christmas Night but two evenings later.

| ShortSummary    = What was to be the duo's final festive offering was billed once again as Eric &amp; Ernie's Xmas Show and some re-hashed material from earlier BBC shows despite Eddie Braben's continued input. The most notable re-used ideas were the Harpenden Hot-Shots and the final play "What Ern Wrote" was entitled The Planter's Wife and featured Nanette Newman in the titular role. This sketch was set in Malaysia with the musical ending performed by puppets. The sketch that had aired originally in the 1976 seasonal show with Elton John ("sounds like an exit on the motorway...") was thinly re-worked here with Peter Skellern in the same role. A song-and-dance number of 'Swinging Down The Lane' remade from their ATV days closes the proceedings but there's no signature tune to be heard. Following the end of the show, Thames continuity announcer [[Philip Elsmore]] appears to introduce the next programme which is to feature Des O'Connor, the duo appear behind Elsmore to make derogatory remarks about the star in a long-standing in-joke; this would be the duo's final appearance as Morecambe died the following year.

In 1980, Thames released a pair of [[VHS]] tapes; the first was the complete 1980 Christmas show, while the other was a compilation from the three that Morecambe and Wise had produced for the company at that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.morecambeandwise.com/viewpage.aspx?pageid=149 |title=Christmas with Morecambe &amp; Wise |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2007 |website=morecambeandwise.com |publisher= |access-date=11 March 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.morecambeandwise.com/viewpage.aspx?pageid=150 |title=Eric &amp; Ernie's Christmas Show |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2007 |website=morecambeandwise.com |publisher= |access-date=11 March 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44326">The adjectival forms of the names of [[astronomical bodies]] are not always easily predictable. Attested adjectival forms of the larger bodies are listed below, along with non-obvious derivations of some smaller bodies; in some cases these are accompanied by their [[demonym]]ic equivalents, which denote purported inhabitants of these bodies.

For Classical (Greco-Roman) names, the adjectival form is normally derived from the [[genitive case]], which may differ from the [[nominative case]] used in English for the noun form. For instance, for a large portion of names ending in ''-s,'' the genitive and therefore the adjective changes the ''-s'' to a ''-d, -t,'' or ''-r,'' as in Isis&amp;ndash;Isidian and Ceres&amp;ndash;Cererian;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is reflected in [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], where both nominal and adjectival forms derive from the genitive:

(Italian ''Ero'''t'''e'' is avoided for euphemistic reasons; the alternative forms ''Mima, Meti, Teti, Isi'' are loans from the French.)

However, in other cases the final consonant is not part of the root and so is dropped in Russian and Italian:

This approach is not foolproof; note Italian ''Eros'' above and Russian Немесида ''Nemesi'''d'''a'' (Nemesis), but Italian ''Nemesi'' and English adj. ''Nemesian''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
occasionally an ''-n'' has been lost from the noun form, and reappears in the adjective, as in Pluto&amp;ndash;Plutonian and Atlas–Atlantean.{{#tag:ref|Other cases of [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] ''-n-'' are not original to the root, but are added to form an adjective by analogy with ''Plutonian'', as in ''Callisto'''n'''ian'' for ''Callistoan''.|group="note"}}

Many of the more recent or more obscure names are only attested in mythological or literary contexts, rather than in specifically astronomical contexts. Forms ending in ''-ish'' or ''-ine,'' such as "Puckish", are not included below if a derivation in ''-an'' is also attested. Rare forms, or forms only attested with spellings not in keeping with the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]-approved spelling (such as ''c'' for ''k''), are shown in ''italics''.

;Note on pronunciation
The suffix ''-ian'' is always unstressed: that is, {{IPAc-en|i|ə|n}}. The related suffix ''-ean'' has traditionally been stressed, that is, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|ə|n}}; but in practice it is often pronounced as if it were ''-ian.'' This dichotomy should be familiar from the dual pronunciations of ''Caribbean'' as {{respell|KARR|i|BEE|ən}} and {{respell|kə|RIB|ee|ən}}.

The '''list of ecoregions in Wisconsin''' are listings of [[terrestrial ecoregions]] (see also, [[ecosystem]]) in the United States' State of [[Wisconsin]], as defined separately by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (USEPA), and the [[World Wildlife Fund]].

==USEPA==
The USEPA ecoregion classification system has four levels, but only Levels I, III, and IV are shown on this list. Level I divides North America into 15 broad ecoregions (or [[biomes]]).  Wisconsin is within the Eastern Temperate Forest, and in the Great Plains, Level I regions.  Level IV ecoregions (denoted by numbers and letters) are a further subdivision of Level III ecoregions  (denoted by numbers alone).&lt;ref name=CEC&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]] |title=Ecological Regions of North America: Toward a Common Perspective |url=http://www3.cec.org/islandora/en/item/1701-ecological-regions-north-america-toward-common-perspective |year=1997 |accessdate=2013-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-wisconsin-ecoregions-l4-map.php Plant Maps Interactive -Wisconsin Ecoregions (based on EPA data)], retrieved 2013-04-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.epa.gov/wed/ecoregions/wi/wi_eco.pdf Level 3 and Level 4 Ecoregions of Wisconsin] USEPA&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1854">The '''net reproduction rate''' ('''NRR''') is the average number of daughters that would be born to a female (or a group of females) if she passed through her lifetime conforming to the age-specific fertility and mortality rates of a given year. This rate is similar to the [[gross reproduction rate]] but takes into account that some females will die before completing their childbearing years. An NRR of '''one''' means that each generation of mothers is having exactly enough daughters to replace themselves in the population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetwire.org/details/62] Retrieved on August 28, 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224163842/http://www.planetwire.org/details/62 |date=February 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dharmalingham|first=A.|title=The Methods and Materials of Demography|editor=David Swanson |editor2=Jacob S.

The NRR is particularly relevant where sex ratios at birth are significantly affected by the use of reproductive technologies, or where life expectancy is low.

The current (2015–20) estimate for the NRR worldwide under the UN's medium variant model is 1.09 daughters per woman.&lt;ref&gt;http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=PopDiv&amp;f=variableID%3A48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shomal-Iran.png|The provinces of Northern Iran|thumb|right]]
'''Northern Iran''' includes the Southern [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] regions representing provinces of '''[[Gilan]]''', '''[[Mazandaran Province|Mazandaran]]''', and '''[[Golestan Province|Golestan]]''' of [[Iran]] (Ancient kingdom of [[Hyrcania]], medieval region of [[Tabaristan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mystery of Mazandaran's Daevas. Volume II:The Rostam's Seven Labours|author=Tahmasbpour, Ali |year=2016|publisher=Tehran.Ashjae|isbn=978-600-97086-1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major provinces, Gilan and Mazandaran, are covered with dense forests, snow-covered mountains and impressive sea shores. The major cities are [[Amol]], [[Babol|Bâbol]], [[Bandar-e Anzali|Anzali]], [[Rasht]], [[Chalus, Iran|Câlus]],  [[Sari, Iran|Sâri]] and [[Qaem Shahr]] (shâhi). Northern Iran has numerous villages, particularly [[Masouleh|Massulé]], appreciated by travellers.

Northern Iran was a trendy spot during the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Pahlevi era]], especially amongst foreign tourists. It was a luxurious place that provided all types of modern recreational facilities as well as tourism infrastructure. Today, it’s mostly visited by domestic tourists.

==Climate==
*'''[[moderate climate|Plain moderate climate]]''': covering central and western plains of [[Mazandaran Province|Mazandaran]]. The average annual rainfall amounts to 1200 or 1300 millimetres, and as we proceed to the east the amount decreases.
*'''[[Mountainous climate]]''': the high mountains and northern parts of the [[Alborz]] range. In the heights, the weather is cold mountainous and most of the precipitation is in the form of snow.
*'''[[Semi-arid climate]]''': This climate prevails some parts of [[Gorgan valley]] (north of [[Gorgan Rud]] as far as the [[Turkmenistan]] border). In this area, the average annual rainfall stands at 500 millimetres.

England is bordered by [[Scotland]] to the north, [[Wales]] to the west and the [[North Sea]], [[Irish Sea]], [[Celtic Sea]], [[Bristol Channel]] and [[English Channel]]. The [[Capital (political)|capital]] is [[London]], the largest metropolitan area in Great Britain, and the largest urban zone in the [[European Union]] by many measures.&lt;ref group ="note"&gt;The official definition of LUZ ([[Larger Urban Zone]]) is used by the European Statistical Agency ([[Eurostat]]) when describing [[conurbation]]s and areas of high population. This definition ranks London highest, above Paris; and a ranking of population within municipal boundaries also puts London on top (see [[Largest cities of the European Union by population within city limits]]). However, research by the [[University of Avignon]] in France ranks Paris first and London second when including the whole urban area and [[hinterland]], that is the outlying cities as well (see [[Largest urban areas of the European Union]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pearl Roundabout''' or '''Lulu Roundabout''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{rtl-lang|ar|دوار اللؤلؤ(ة)}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Dawwār al-luʾluʾ(ah)}}'', "Roundabout of the pearl(s)") was a roundabout located near the [[Central business district|financial district]] of [[Manama]], [[Bahrain]]. The [[roundabout]] was named after the [[pearl]] monument that previously stood on the site and was destroyed on March 18, 2011 by government forces as part of a crackdown on protesters during the [[Bahraini uprising (2011–present)]].&lt;ref name=yalibnan/&gt;

==Location==
The roundabout was located in the heart of the capital Manama and was surrounded by the Bahrain Central Market, Marina, Pearl and City Center Roundabout&lt;ref name = "Al Wasat"&gt;{{citation | publisher = Al Wasat | journal = News | url = http://www.alwasatnews.com/3116/news/read/532856/1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well the [[Abraj Al Lulu]] (Pearl Towers) apartment complex, which is named after the Pearl Monument. Also near the destroyed roundabout are some of the city's major remaining landmarks, including the [[Bahrain World Trade Center]] and the [[Bahrain Financial Harbour]].

The roundabout served originally as a major traffic intersection for routes into the capital city, although it is now bypassed by a flyover and junction complex built as part of Bahrain's 2030 modernization plan.&lt;ref name=yalibnan&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Second Man Dies in Bahrain Skirmishes|url=http://www.yalibnan.com/2011/02/15/second-man-dies-in-bahrain-skirmishes/|work=[[Ya Libnan]] |publisher=|date=2011-02-15 |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pearl Monument==
The Pearl Monument previously stood in the center of the circle,&lt;ref name=yalibnan/&gt; having been erected in 1982 on the occasion of the third summit of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]], which was hosted by Bahrain for the first time in Manama on November 9–11 of that year.&lt;ref name = "Al Wasat"/&gt;&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/timeline-of-the-gcc-summit-1.723199 Timeline of the GCC Summit], gulfnews.com, Dec. 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbols and representation===
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Bahrain coin 500Fils.JPG|thumb|The Pearl Monument depicted on a [[Bahraini dinar|500 fils coin]] in Bahrain]] --&gt;
The Pearl Monument consisted of six [[dhow]] "sails" projecting up to the sky, which came together to hold a [[pearl]] at the top. The six sails designated the Gulf Cooperation Council's six member nations, while the pearl symbolized their united heritage and the country's famous history of pearl cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=document.home&amp;id=75 Bahrain: Two Million Tourists Can't Be Wrong] April 17, 2007, Bahrain Embassy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/bahrain/8390773/Bahrain-authorities-destroy-Pearl-Roundabout.html |title=Bahrain authorities destroy Pearl Roundabout |publisher=The Telegraph | location=London |first=Ben |last=Farmer |date=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the base of the monument was a [[dodecagon]]al pool with [[fountain]] jets.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The Pearl Monument is featured on the face of the Bahraini half-[[Bahraini dinar|dinar]] coin, the highest value coin in Bahraini currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbb.gov.bh/page.php?p=current_coins_500fils |title=Current Coins: 500 fils |publisher=Central Bank of Bahrain}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Central Bank of Bahrain]] reportedly asked banks to exchange their half-dinar coins for half-dinar banknotes after the Pearl Monument was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/3123/news/read/534225/1.html |script-title=ar:المصرف المركزي" يسحب الـ 500 فلس المعدنية" |trans-title=Central Bank pulls 500 fils coins |language=Arabic |newspaper=[[Alwasat (Bahraini newspaper)|Alwasat]] | location=Manama |date=2011-03-26 |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The coin is no longer minted or distributed by the [[Central Bank of Bahrain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=302685 |title=Collector's item |newspaper=[[Gulf Daily News]] |first=Alicia |last=De Haldevang |date=2011-03-28 |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pearl Roundabout was the site of demonstrations during 2011, which began in February.&lt;ref name=yalibnan/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Slackman|title=Unrest Grows in Bahrain as Police Kill a 2nd Protester

On 15 February 2011, after the funeral procession of Mr [[Death of Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima|Ali Mushaima]], more people joined the demonstrators and moved towards the Pearl Roundabout, where they arrived at around 15:00. By 15:15, demonstrators began to set up tents at the roundabout, and later in the day a projector screen was installed. Among these was a tent erected by members of the SMC medical staff. There were also a number of demonstrators obstructing traffic in the roundabout overpass. By nightfall, the number of demonstrators had reached several thousand. The roundabout and its immediate vicinity were congested with protesters and private vehicles. Police in the area neither engaged the demonstrators nor did they attempt to disperse them. King Hamad had ordered that members of the procession be allowed to occupy the Pearl Roundabout to express their sadness.&lt;ref&gt;http://files.bici.org.bh/BICIreportEN.pdf (p81)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 February 2011, while demonstrators were spending the night at the Pearl Roundabout, police forces entered the location at 3:00 in an attempt to disperse protesters. The crackdown led to many injuries as well as the death of at least four civilians (See [[Bloody Thursday (2011)]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/201121714223324820.html |title=Clashes rock Bahraini capital - Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2011-02-17 |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the police crackdown on demonstrators, Bahraini police official Al-Hassan appeared on national television to explain the previous night's events. Al-Hassan argued that demonstrators were warned beforehand and that they refused to leave the area. He also added that demonstrators were actually in possession of weapons such as knives and pistols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.akhbaralarab.net/index.php/regional/33378-2011-02-17-15-17-04 |title=الداخلية البحرينية تعلن العثور على ذخيرة حية وسيوف وسكاكين واعلام لحزب الله في خيم المتجمهرين |publisher=Akhbaralarab.net |date=2011-02-17 |accessdate=2011-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723005759/http://www.akhbaralarab.net/index.php/regional/33378-2011-02-17-15-17-04 |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry]], established by [[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa|King Hamad]] of Bahrain to prepare a report on the events on February and March saw no evidence to suggest that protesters at the roundabout were armed.&lt;ref name="bici"&gt;{{cite report |title=Report of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry |publisher=[[Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry]] |url=http://files.bici.org.bh/BICIreportEN.pdf |date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=231}}

Demonstrators were shot by forces camping in Pearl Roundabout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/20112184122210251.html |title=Bahrain forces fire at protesters - Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2011-02-18 |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following these events, the [[Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa|Crown Prince of Bahrain Salman Al Khalifa]] came on Bahrain state television and demanded calm of all parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0220/breaking12.html |title=Bahrain capital calm before talks - The Irish Times - Sun, Feb 20, 2011 |publisher=The Irish Times |date=2011-02-20 |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following day, he ordered the military tanks to leave the Pearl Monument and protesters were allowed to occupy the area peacefully and were guaranteed by the Crown Prince that they would be able to demonstrate without any further attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-02-19/world/bahrain.protests_1_protesters-bahrainis-security-forces?_s=PM:WORLD | work=CNN | title=Bahrain, from pearls to protests | date=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On March 16, however, the protesters' camp in the roundabout was evacuated, bulldozed, and set on fire by the Bahraini Defense Force, riot police, and [[Peninsula Shield Force]],&lt;ref name=MSNBC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/42124501/ |title='Business-Friendly Bahrain' Disappears; Ex-Pats Exit |publisher=CNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/nphotos/Gulf-Cooperation-Council-GCC-forces-move-Pearl-Square-evacuate-anti-government/photo//110316/ids_photos_ts/r2803517732.jpg//s:/nm/20110316/wl_nm/us_bahrain_protests |title=Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) forces move in to Pearl Square |publisher=News.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; two days before the Pearl Monument was demolished.

[[File:Poifile.jpg|right|thumb|Viewing POI points on a [[Garmin]] GPS]]

A '''point of interest''', or '''POI''', is a specific point location that someone may find useful or interesting.  An example is a point on the [[Earth]] representing the location of the [[Space Needle]], or a point on [[Mars]] representing the location of the [[mountain]], [[Olympus Mons]]. Most consumers use the term when referring to hotels, campsites, fuel stations or any other categories used in modern [[Automotive navigation system|(automotive) navigation systems]]. 

Users of a [[mobile device]]s can be provided with geolocation and time aware POI service&lt;ref&gt;Yuan, Q., Cong, G., Ma, Z., Sun, A., &amp; Thalmann, N. M. (2013, July). Time-aware point-of-interest recommendation. In Proceedings of the 36th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval (pp. 363-372). ACM.&lt;/ref&gt;, that recommends geolocations nearby and with a temporal relevance (e.g. POI to special services in a ski resort are available only in winter).

In medical fields such as [[histology]]/[[pathology]]/[[histopathology]], points of interest are selected from the general background in a [[field of view]]; for example, among hundreds of normal [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s, the pathologist may find 3 or 4 [[neoplastic]] cells that stand out from the others upon [[staining]].

A [[region of interest]] (ROI) and a volume of interest (VOI) are similar in concept, denoting a region or a volume (which may contain various individual POIs).

The term is widely used in [[cartography]], especially in electronic variants including [[GIS]], and [[GPS navigation software]]. In this context the synonym [[waypoint]] is common.

A GPS point of interest specifies, at minimum, the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of the POI, assuming a certain [[map datum]].  A name or description for the POI is usually included, and other information such as altitude or a telephone number may also be attached.  GPS applications typically use [[computer icon|icons]] to represent different categories of POI on a map graphically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www8.garmin.com/products/poiloader/|title=Garmin POI Loader|publisher=[[Garmin]]|accessdate=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==POI collections==
[[File:BMWPoiMap.jpg|right|thumb|Custom [[speed camera]] POI overlaid on a [[BMW]] navigation map]]

Digital maps for modern GPS devices typically include a basic selection of POI for the map area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poi66.com/tomtom|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130616100017/http://www.poi66.com/tomtom|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-06-16|publisher=POI66|title=TomTom Points of Interest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However websites exist that specialize in the collection, verification, management and distribution of POI which [[end-user]]s can load onto their devices to replace or supplement the existing POI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waypointer.info|publisher=Waypointer|title=Waypointer - online POI manager|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219233045/http://waypointer.info/|archivedate=2014-12-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pintica.com|publisher=Pintica|title=Pintica - online POI manager}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some of these websites are generic, and will collect and categorize POI for any interest, others are more specialized in a particular category (such as speed cameras) or [[GPS]] device (e.g. [[TomTom]]/[[Garmin]]).  End-users also have the ability to create their own custom collections.

Commercial POI collections, especially those that ship with digital maps, or that are sold on a [[subscription]] basis are usually protected by [[copyright]]. However, there are also many websites from which [[royalty-free]] POI collections can be obtained, e.g. [https://web.archive.org/web/20160506072606/http://gis.zcu.cz/spoi/ SPOI - Smart Points of Interest], which is distributed under [[ODbL]] license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Čerba|first1=Otakar|title=SPOI|url=http://gis.zcu.cz/spoi/doc/SPOI.pdf|publisher=SDI4Apps|accessdate=28 March 2016|pages=4|format=PDF|date=23 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701141304/http://gis.zcu.cz/spoi/doc/SPOI.pdf|archive-date=2016-07-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The applications for POI are extensive.  As GPS-enabled devices as well as software applications that use digital maps become more available, so too the applications for POI are also expanding.  Newer [[digital camera]]s for example can automatically [[geocoded photograph|tag]] a photograph using [[Exif]] with the GPS location where a picture was taken; these pictures can then be overlaid as POI on a digital map or [[satellite imagery|satellite image]] such as [[Google Earth]].  [[Geocaching]] applications are built around POI collections.  In [[Vehicle tracking system]]s POIs are used to mark destination points and/or offices to that users of [[GPS tracking software]] would easily monitor position of vehicles according to POIs.

==File formats==
Many different [[file format]]s, including [[proprietary format]]s, are used to store point of interest data, even where the same underlying [[WGS84]] system is used.

Reasons for variations to store the same data include:
* A lack of [[Technical standard|standards]] in this area ([[GPS eXchange Format|GPX]] is a notable attempt to address this).
* Attempts by some software vendors to protect their data through [[security through obscurity|obfuscation]].
* [[Licensing]] issues that prevent companies from using competitor's file specifications.
* [[Computer storage|Memory]] saving, for example, by converting [[floating point]] latitude and longitude co-ordinates into smaller [[integer]] values.
* Speed and battery life (operations using [[integer]] latitude and longitude values are less [[Central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive than those that use [[floating point]] values).
* Requirements to add custom fields to the data.
* Use of older reference systems that predate [[GPS]] (for example [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|UTM]] or the [[British national grid reference system]])
* Readability/possibility to edit (plain text files are human-readable and may be edited)

The following are some of the file formats used by different vendors and devices to exchange POI (and in some cases, also [[track (navigation)|navigation tracks]]):

* [[ASCII]] Text (.asc .txt .csv .plt)
* Topografix [[GPS eXchange Format|GPX]] (.gpx)
* [[Garmin]] Mapsource (.gdb)
* [[Google Earth]] [[Keyhole Markup Language]] (.kml .kmz)
* Pocket Street Pushpins (.psp)
* Maptech Marks (.msf)
* Maptech Waypoint (.mxf)
* [[Microsoft MapPoint]] Pushpin (.csv)
* [[OziExplorer]] (.wpt)
* [[TomTom]] Overlay (.ov2) and TomTom plain text format (.asc)
* [[OpenStreetMap]] data (.osm)

[[Third-party developer|Third party]] and vendor-supplied utilities are available to convert point of interest data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CamperVanNZ|url=http://www.gps-data-team.com/convert.php|title=Convert POI (Online)}}&lt;/ref&gt; between different formats to allow them to be exchanged between otherwise incompatible GPS devices or systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=RJ Davies|url=http://rjdavies.users.btopenworld.com/html/poiconverter.html|title=POIConverter|accessdate=2008-01-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229233124/http://rjdavies.users.btopenworld.com/html/poiconverter.html|archivedate=2007-12-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, many applications will support the generic [[ASCII]] text file format, although this format is more prone to error due to its loose structure as well as the many ways in which GPS co-ordinates can be represented (e.g. decimal vs degree/minute/second). POI format converters are often named after the POI file format they convert and convert to, such as KML2GPX (converts KML to GPX) and KML2OV2 (converts KML to OV2).

The '''pomato''' (or '''tomtato''', '''ketchup and chips''') is a grafted plant that is produced by [[grafting]] together a [[tomato]] plant and a [[potato]] plant, both of which are members of the [[Solanaceae]] (nightshade) family. Cherry tomatoes grow on the vine, while white potatoes grow in the soil from the same plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Greene|first=David|title=TomTato Is The Latest Wonderplant|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/09/27/226716504/the-last-word-in-business|accessdate=30 September 2013|newspaper=NPR News|date=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The concept of grafting related potatoes and tomatoes so that both are produced on the same plant was originally developed in 1977 at the [[Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology]] in [[Tübingen]], Germany, and although healthy, the plant produced neither potatoes nor tomatoes.&lt;ref name="renneberg"&gt;{{cite book | title=Biotechnology for Beginners | publisher=Elsevier | author=Renneberg, Reinhard | year=2008 | page=210 | isbn=9780123735812}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research]] in [[Cologne]] produced a plant with fruit in 1994.&lt;ref name="renneberg"/&gt;

As with all grafts, this plant will not occur in nature and cannot be grown from seed, because the two parts of the plant remain genetically separate, and only rely on each other for nourishment and growth. Like most standard types of plant grafting, a small incision is made in the stem of both plants and they are strapped together. Once the cuts have healed and the plants are joined, the leafy top of the potato plant can be cut away and the roots of the tomato can be removed, leaving the leaves of the tomato plant to nourish the roots of the potato plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to create a pomato plant|url=http://www.how.com/how_2308286_grow-pomato-plant.html|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rootstock (potato) acts as a stable and healthy root system and the scions (tomato) are chosen for their fruit, flowers or leaves. The tomatoes should be ready to harvest after about 12 weeks during the summer months, the potatoes should be ready after the tomato leaves begin to die back, normally in early autumn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pomato Plants|journal=The Guru|year=2010|issue=36|url=http://www.thegardengurus.tv/pub/magazine/TheGuru_Summer_2010_37/22.html|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grafting in this way can be used to produce many different related crops from the same plant, for example the growing popularity of [[Fruit salad tree|'Fruit salad' trees]], which is a single tree that produces multiple types of [[citrus fruits]], or a tree with a variety of [[prunus|fruits with stones]] (peach, plum etc.).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/brainwaves/the-science-of-pomato-plants-and-fruit-salad-trees/|title=The Science of Pomato Plants and Fruit Salad Trees|last=Jabr|first=Ferris|date=September 10, 2012|work=Scientific American|access-date=October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Pomato plants have been seen as a new technology to make food production more efficient, as they maximize the amount of crops that can be produced on a piece of land or in a small urban environment like a balcony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.freshfruitportal.com/news/2011/06/09/kenyan-farmers-produce-pomato-plants-to-improve-land-use/|title=Kenyan farmers produce 'pomato' plants to improve land use|last=|first=|date=June 9, 2011|work=Fresh Fruit Portal|access-date=October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has significant impacts on developing countries like [[Kenya]], where farmers can save on space, time and labor without affecting the quality of their produce by growing pomato plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Corporate-News/-/539550/1175460/-/vuxi9d/-/index.html|title=Prison grows unique ‘pomato’ to fight hunger|last=|first=|date=June 6, 2011|work=Business Daily Africa|access-date=October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, grafting can improve resistance to bacteria, viruses and fungi, attract a more diverse group of pollinators and provide a sturdy trunk for delicate ornamental plants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Commercial products ==
Grafted pomato plants were launched in the [[United Kingdom]] in September 2013 by horticultural mail order company [[Thompson &amp; Morgan]], who sold pre-grafted plants branded as the "TomTato". The [[Incredible Edible]] nursery in New Zealand announced a "DoubleUP Potato Tom" in the same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jude Gillies |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/nelson-mail/features/lifestyle/9218071/Potato-Tom-opens-fresh-doors |title=Potato Tom opens fresh doors |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson &amp; Morgan claim that this is the first time the plant has been produced commercially, and director Paul Hansord describes originating the tomtato idea himself 15 years ago in the US, when visiting a garden where someone had planted a potato under a tomato as a joke.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hall|first=John|title=The TomTato: Plant which produces both potatoes and tomatoes launched in UK|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/the-tomtato-plant-which-produces-both-potatoes-and-tomatoes-launched-in-uk-8839501.html|accessdate=30 September 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grafting is a difficult process because the tomato and the potato stems have to be the same thickness, and Thompson &amp; Morgan trialed the hybrid for several years before selling it. Production and grafting of tomtatos begins in a specialist laboratory in the Netherlands, before being shipped back to the UK and grown in greenhouses until they are ready to be sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2432094/TomTato-plant-produces-potatoes-tomatoes-sale-UK.html|title=The TomTato... or how you can make ketchup AND chips from the same plant!|last=Wilkes|first=David|date=25 September 2013|newspaper=The Daily Mail|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Institute of Navigation''' (RIN) is a [[learned society]] with charitable status, aimed at furthering the development of [[navigation]] on land and sea, in the air and in space. It was founded in 1947 as a forum for mariners, pilots, engineers and academics to compare their experiences and exchange information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2016|title=The Royal Institute of Navigation - Aims and Objects|url=|journal=Journal of Navigation|volume=69|issue=66|pages= b1-b2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It holds conferences about new developments in traffic separation and satellite navigation. It has charitable status and a Royal charter.

==History==
The organisation was formed in 1947 as the Institute of Navigation and was patterned after the US [[Institute of Navigation]]. Both organizations had been influenced by the role navigation had helped in moving troops and supplies during [[World War II|Second World War]].  Emerging technology such as [[radar]] and [[LORAN]] increased in the years following the war.  The Institute sought to provide a forum where academics, engineers, mariners, and pilots could learn, exchange information, and share personal experiences.

The Institute's founding membership included several notable professionals in the field.  From the field of astronomy Sir Harold Spencer Jones, the [[Astronomer Royal|Astronomer-Royal]] was the first president.  The first two vice-presidents represented the field of aviation in Air Chief Marshal [[John Slessor|Sir John Slessor]] (Deputy Chief of the Air Staff) and the development of radar in [[Robert Watson-Watt|Sir Robert Watson-Watt]]. Marine navigation was represented by [[Michael Richey (sailor)|Michael Richey]] who became the first Executive Secretary. The following year Richey would found the Institute's official academic publication, the [[Journal of Navigation]].&lt;ref&gt;s. [http://www.rin.org.uk/general/Journal-of-Navigation Journal of Navigation].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute expanded its focus in the 1950s and 1960s to also address issues of safety and began collaborating with similar organizations in Europe.  In 1972, at its 25th anniversary, its work was recognized by [[Elizabeth II|Her Majesty the Queen]] and it became entitled to the "Royal" prefix and was renamed the Royal Institute of Navigation.

==Activities==
The Institute sponsors conferences, publications, and reports related to navigation.  In 2017 its international conference included comtemporary topics as artificial intelligence, cyber threats, and machine learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalnavigationconference.org.uk/ |title=
The International Navigation Conference 2017 - Innovations in Autonomous &amp; Resilient PNT|publisher=Royal Institute of Navigation  |access-date=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also co-sponsored a report to the UK government on the economic impact of a 5-day loss of geopositioning systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-economic-impact-on-the-uk-of-a-disruption-to-gnss |title=The economic impact on the UK of a disruption to GNSS|publisher=Innvate UK|access-date=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first '''USS ''Advance''''' was a [[brigantine]] in the [[United States Navy]] which participated in an arctic rescue expedition.  ''Advance'' was built in 1847 as ''Augusta'' in [[New Kent County, Virginia]] and loaned to the Navy on 7 May 1850 by Mr. [[Henry Grinnell]] to participate in the search for Sir [[John Franklin]]'s arctic expedition which had been stranded in the frozen north since 1847. After last-minute preparations, the ship, under the command of Lieutenant [[Edwin J. De Haven]] and in company with {{USS|Rescue|1850|2}}, put to sea from New York on 23 May 1850.

==First rescue expedition==
{{Main|First Grinnell Expedition}}

Storms battered the two ships on the initial leg of the voyage and separated them. However, both safely reached [[Disko Island]], located off the west coast of [[Greenland]] where [[Davis Strait]] gives way to [[Baffin Bay]]. ''Advance'' arrived on 24 June, and ''Rescue'' pulled into port three days later. On the 29th, the two ships headed into Baffin Bay, bound for [[Lancaster Sound]] located north of [[Baffin Island]] and south of Devon Island. Off [[Haroe Island]] on 1 July, ''Advance'' encountered pack ice. A week later, she and her consort were caught in the pack just north of Upernavik. For the next three weeks, the two ships fought their way through the ice. On the 29th, they cleared the pack and continued their voyage across [[Melville Bay]] to Lancaster Sound. The two ships entered the sound on 19 August and, that same day, encountered two British vessels engaged in the same mission as the Americans.

That evening, a storm blew up and separated ''Advance'' and ''Rescue''. The next day dawned "thick and foggy," but the wind had abated. ''Advance'' began searching for her companion. By 25 August, she was off [[Cape Riley]] on Devon Island where she put ashore a landing party to search for clues to the whereabouts of the Franklin expedition. While the searchers ashore were discovering the former campsite of some unidentified party, ''Advance'' was run aground by a strong current. The British ship ''Prince Albert'' offered assistance, but ''Rescue'' showed up at about the same time. Moreover, ''Advance'' lightened her load and succeeded in hauling off by her own efforts.

On 26 August, the two ships attempted the passage of [[Wellington Channel]] to search the area north of [[Cape Spencer (Alaska)|Cape Spencer]]. Soon, however, they found the way north blocked by a solid mass of pack ice and prudently returned south to the vicinity of [[Point Innes]]. There, the Americans again encountered the British, along with positive evidence of the Franklin party having camped nearby. Heartened by that find and by a favorable change in weather conditions, they headed back toward Wellington Channel. At [[Beechy Island]], all the search vessels gathered in a cove (later called [[Union Bay (Alaska)|Union Bay]]) to plan a coordinated search. While the leading officers were so engaged, a party sent ashore discovered three graves and "other unmistakable evidences of the missing expedition (Franklin's) having passed its first winter here." At that point, she and ''Rescue'' entered Wellington Channel to pursue the search, but the pack ice quickly closed in upon the two ships. Though they tried to escape the clutches of the pack, abysmal weather foiled their attempts; and ''Rescue'' suffered a damaged rudder. By mid-September, they were caught fast in the floating ice.

For the duration of the winter, ''Advance'' and ''Rescue'' were at the mercy of the drifting floe. For what remained of September and most of October, they drifted in Wellington Channel, discovering the northern peninsula of Devon Island which they named Grinnell in honor of the expedition's benefactor. During November, changing winds carried them back and forth past Beechy Island. In December, the floe made the transit of Lancaster Sound and, on 14 January 1851, they reentered Baffin Bay. Their imprisonment, however, did not end until early June. They had passed Davis Strait in May, and the floe began to break up near the end of the first week in June. ''Rescue'' – repaired – cleared the pack on 7 June 1851. ''Advance'' followed the next day.

The expedition replenished at Disko Bay and sought to renew the search. However, the ice proved heavier than in the previous year; and prudence dictated that the mission be abandoned for the time being. Therefore, the two ships headed back to the United States. ''Advance'' arrived in New York on 30 September 1851, and ''Rescue'' reached that port on 7 October. Both ships were returned to Mr. Grinnell, and he immediately began outfitting ''Advance'' for another Arctic expedition.

==Second expedition==
{{Main|Second Grinnell Expedition}}

Preparations for the [[Second Grinnell Expedition|second Franklin rescue expedition]] took about 20 months. ''Advance'' finally departed New York on 30 May 1853, Passed Assistant Surgeon [[Elisha Kane|Elisha Kent Kane]] in command. The expedition stopped at [[Upernavik]], Greenland, to purchase supplies and, most importantly, sled dogs for searches ashore and on the solidly frozen floes. Continuing north, ''Advance'' passed the length of Baffin Bay reaching [[Smith Sound]] — the northern terminus of Baffin Bay — by 7 August. Near the end of August, she reached her northernmost point — about 78°43' north latitude — in [[Kane Basin]], named for the ship's commanding officer, Passed Assistant Surgeon Kane.

At that point, Kane decided to pass the winter among a group of islets near the Greenland coast rather than to return south to some safer harbor. By 10 September, ''Advance'' was imprisoned in the ice. The interior of the ship underwent extensive preparations for wintering farther north than any previous expedition. When that was complete, the crew began expeditions across the frozen wastes both on the Greenland shore and the frozen pack. Kane and his officers also established a scientific station to observe climatic conditions and to make astronomical calculations.

Their expeditions on foot, however, were hampered by the loss of almost all their sled dogs to disease. In the absence of animal transport, the men themselves carried out the searches and explorations on foot, serving as beasts of burden to manhandle caches of supplies to points which would allow for more distant searches in the future.

On one such expedition in late March 1854, four of the party suffered so severely from frostbite that they had to be left behind under the care of a fifth man while the remaining members of the party — too physically exhausted to do more than drag their own persons across the frozen wastes — headed back to the brig for help. The leader of that group, upon returning to the brig, volunteered to return with the rescue party as a guide. However, his own ordeal caused him to fall victim of a temporary mental disorder and prevented him from rendering any real help. It was only good luck — first in finding the advanced party's trail and then in sighting a canvas tent at the site of the disabled men's "encampment" — and their own Herculean efforts that allowed the rescue party to complete their mission. Even that success, however, was marred by the fact that two of the rescued men later succumbed to their infirmities. 

Fatigue and illness of all associated with the rescue expedition prevented Kane from undertaking further searches until the end of April. During that interlude, [[Greenlandic Inuit]] arrived in the area, and Kane bartered with them for additional sled dogs. The four animals he thus obtained allowed him to fit out a single seven-dog team which greatly extended the range of their searches. In his own words, "The value of these animals for Arctic ice-travel (sic) can hardly be over-estimated (sic)." Through the ensuing summer, search parties ranged the far northern coasts of Greenland and the eastern coast of [[Ellesmere Island]] searching for evidence of Sir John Franklin's party and making notes on geography and climate.

===Abandonment of the ''Advance''===

''Advance's'' crewmen passed the second winter in a state of near hibernation. The difficulties of the previous year had sapped their strength, and their provisions were too scant to restore it. [[Scurvy]] — that dread disease of the sea — riddled their ranks to the point that Kane and one other man "... only remained to attend upon the sick, and carry on the daily work of the ship, if that name could still appropriately designate the burrow which we inhabited." The sun returned late in February 1855, and wild game followed it in March. Reasonably adequate food and the sunlight slowly brought the men back some semblance of full strength. At that point, Kane decided to abandon the ship — still frozen solidly in the floe — and make it across the ice to the [[Denmark|Danish]] settlements of southern Greenland. Shortages of fuel and food, as well as the weakened condition of the crew, made that decision inescapable. 

Preparations for the journey were multifaceted and complicated. Those capable of work prepared two 25-foot [[whaleboat]]s and a 13-foot dinghy by mounting them on iron-shod wooden runners and then loading them with provisions. Meanwhile, Kane took the dog sled and team out to an abandoned Inuit hut located some 35&amp;nbsp;miles from the brig. There, he established an advanced depot to store provisions for the actual journey. During April and the first half of May, he made several trips carrying supplies to his makeshift way station. On 15 May 1855, he began transporting the incapacitated members of the crew to the way station. Two days later, the main group began its torturous trek across the ice hummocks with the three boat-sleds. The main party, without the assistance of dogs, managed a snail's pace of only some three and one-half miles a day. While the main group inched its way, Kane continued his more rapid trips — facilitated by the dogs — both back to the brig and to an Inuit camp located about 75&amp;nbsp;miles south of the ship. In this manner, he moved the sick to the way station, brought additional supplies from the ship, and returned from the Inuit camp with fresh game. He last visited the ship on 8 June 1855 and, by the middle of that month, all the sick gradually joined the main party then nearing Littleton Island. The mode of travel again was Kane's dog sled During the journey south toward [[Cape Alexander, Greenland|Cape Alexander]], the party suffered numerous breaks through the ice as the spring thaw arrived. At least one man, Acting Carpenter Ohlsen, died from exposure resulting from such an incident.

By 18 June, the entire party reached open water at the edge of the floe near Cape Alexander. The journey had netted them only 81&amp;nbsp;miles in 31 days, but the numerous cutbacks and detours, necessitated by the ice hummocks, resulted in an actual trek of over 300&amp;nbsp;miles. From that point, they took to the boats. During the next phase of the journey, they alternated between runs across open water under sail and marches across frozen ice hummocks when necessary. By 21 July 1855, the men reached [[Cape York (Greenland)|Cape York]], the point at which they would begin the transit to Upernavik. There, they erected a rock monument in which they left information regarding their planned movements, a list of provisions on hand, and a brief summary of the expedition's findings. That project completed, Kane and his crew started out across Melville Bay. On 6 August, Kane led his exhausted party into Upernavik. They took passage from Upernavik in the Danish brig ''Marianne'' to Disko Island where they were met by the relief expedition made up of {{USS|Arctic|1855|2}} and {{USS|Release|1855|2}} under the command of Lt. Hartstene. The two relief ships brought the survivors into New York on 11 October 1855. Presumably, the pack ice eventually crushed and sank the abandoned ''Advance''.

The '''Xiangkhouang Plateau''' or '''Xiangkhoang Plateau''', also known in [[French language|French]] as '''Plateau du Tran-Ninh''' is a [[plateau]] in the north of [[Laos]]. The landscape is characterized by green mountains, rugged karst formations and verdant valleys with plenty of [[river]]s, caves and waterfalls.
==Geography==
The [[Luang Prabang Range]], and the [[Annamite Range]] separate the plateau from [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;''The Ancient and Classical History of Southeast Asia''&lt;/ref&gt;  The ranges of the plateau are [[sandstone]] and [[limestone]] mountains between 2000 and 2800 meters high (about 6561 and 9842 feet high). These have been heavily [[deforested]]. The highest mountain of [[Laos]], [[Phou Bia]], is located to the south of the Xiangkhoang. Altitudes within the plateau area may reach 1000 m.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clio.fr/CHRONOLOGIE/pdf/pdf_chronologie_laos.pdf Laos, Le « Pays du million d’éléphants »]&lt;/ref&gt; Several tributaries of the [[Mekong]] drain in the plateau, such as the [[Nam Ngum]], [[Ngiap River|Ngiap]] and the [[Khan River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/650799/Xiangkhoang-Plateau Encyclopædia Britannica - Xiangkhoang Plateau]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The major town in the area is the capital of [[Phonsavan]]. The plateau gives its name to present-day [[Xiangkhouang Province]] in which Phonsavan is located.

==History==
The plateau is the location of the [[Plain of Jars]], which is a collective name for several sites with funerary archeological remains nominated for UNESCO World Heritage status.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xieng-khouang.com/ Welcome to Xieng Khouang!] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220014131/http://www.xieng-khouang.com/ |date=December 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The plateau is also one of the most heavily contaminated areas in the world from unexploded [[cluster munitions]] also called [[UXO]].
