'''''10&amp;nbsp;MPH''''' is a documentary film directed by [[Hunter Weeks]] and starring Josh Caldwell with his [[Segway HT]], the two-wheeled electronic scooter. This film, which takes its name from the Segway's average speed, documents Caldwell's 100-day, coast to coast journey across the United States riding the "Human Transporter". The trip started in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] on August 8, 2004 and ended in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]] on November 18, 2004. ''10&amp;nbsp;MPH'' has had a favorable reaction at screenings and film festivals and has won several awards.&lt;ref name="Inglis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thephoenix.com/article_ektid45613.aspx |title=Slow Ride |publisher=[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Phoenix]] |last=Inglis |first=Jeff |date=August 15, 2007 |accessdate=December 26, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120004018/http://thephoenix.com/article_ektid45613.aspx |archivedate=January 20, 2008 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

''10&amp;nbsp;MPH'' follows the progress of Caldwell as he rides a Segway scooter across the United States from [[Seattle]] to [[Boston]], stopping at many places along the way to interact with people. The film focuses on showing the dynamic nature of the US countryside as well as documenting the stories of people Caldwell and Weeks encounter along the way.

''10&amp;nbsp;MPH'' shows Caldwell, Weeks, and other members of the crew but also provides footage of the people they meet, both helpful and rude. For example, Caldwell and the crew are stopped by an Illinois police officer who admonishes them for traveling at {{Convert|10|mph|km/h|0}} on a road with a {{Convert|45|mph|km/h|0}} speed limit. The filmmakers also document their struggles, from the technical challenges of maintaining the Segway's [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] to the production challenge of losing a producer part way through the filming process.

==Development==
Dissatisfied with their average corporate jobs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Filmmakers Segway out of cubicle life at ‘11 mph’ |first=Darren  |last=Garnick |url=http://www.bostonherald.com/business/media/view.bg?articleid=1079711 |newspaper=[[Boston Herald]] |date=March 12, 2008 |accessdate=January 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; filmmakers Weeks and Caldwell formed a production company, Spinning Blue, in [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]] prior to beginning production of ''10&amp;nbsp;MPH''.  They have discussed their lack of training and experience in the film industry, lack of investment capital to make the film, and lack of film industry contacts as challenges at the beginning of the process.  Rather than pursuing traditional channels of film making, Weeks and Caldwell used the Web to raise funds and promote ''10&amp;nbsp;MPH''.&lt;ref name="backstory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://10mph.com/the-film/backstory.html |title=Backstory |publisher=10MPH.com |accessdate=December 26, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105111546/http://10mph.com/the-film/backstory.html |archivedate=January 5, 2008 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; They conceived the idea of making a film before knowing what it would be about. Shortly thereafter, a friend gave them the idea of making a film involving a Segway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/16/AR2007081602867.html |title=A Major Life Segue Via...Segway |work=The Washington Post |date=August 17, 2007 |accessdate=December 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Weeks and Caldwell purchased a Segway and decided to film a documentary about traveling across the United States at {{convert|10|mph|km/h}}.&lt;ref name="orndorf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/read.php?ID=28184 |title=10 MPH: Seattle to Boston |publisher=DVDTalk |last=Orndorf |first=Brian |accessdate=December 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caldwell actually rode the scooter while Weeks directed and managed the film footage. Weeks and other members of the production crew followed Caldwell in a car with the film equipment.&lt;ref name="Tweney"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/news/2007/08/10mph |title=Filmmakers Chase Their Dream – on a Segway |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired Magazine]] |date=August 13, 2007 |last=Tweney |first=Dylan |accessdate=December 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They used a Sony PD-150 to capture 180&amp;nbsp;hours of footage.  Post-production occurred back in Denver after the Segway journey with involvement from other members of the Denver film community.&lt;ref name="backstory"/&gt;

==Distribution==
''10&amp;nbsp;MPH'' is available in several ways including on DVD, which premiered on May 29, 2007 in the United States and is available through [[Netflix]] and other outlets, and by direct download from the film Web site and from [[iTunes]].  Additionally, Weeks and Caldwell spent months in 2007 traveling back over their path to show the finished documentary in theaters along the way.&lt;ref name="Tweney"/&gt;

{{Anchor|Reception}}

==Critical response==
The documentary received generally positive reviews from critics. Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 80 percent based on reviews from five critics, with a [[weighted mean|rating average]] of 7.4 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired Magazine]]'', Dylan Tweney wrote that ''10&amp;nbsp;MPH'' “...is about more than just a couple of geeks with their high-tech toy: It's lighthearted and entertaining, with an overarching message about accomplishing your dreams and doing your ‘thing.’”&lt;ref name="Tweney"/&gt; Jeff Inglis of the ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|Boston Phoenix]]'' compared it with other accounts of American [[road trip]]s, writing; “What Caldwell and Weeks have made is a road movie, in the tradition, perhaps, of [[Charles Kuralt]]’s “On the Road” reports for CBS News, or maybe more like [[William Least Heat-Moon]]’s backroads [[wikt: peregrination|peregrinations]] in [[Blue Highways]].”&lt;ref name="Inglis"/&gt;

The documentary also received praise in the ''[[West Seattle Herald]]'', where Bruce Bulloch called Caldwell and Weeks “savvy storytellers” and applauded ''10&amp;nbsp;MPH'' for being a “witty counterpoint to the hyped-up rhythms of American life.” Bulloch further commented of ''10&amp;nbsp;MPH'', that despite its slow tempo “[it] has a seductive vitality about it – the last fit of reckless abandon of a disappearing youth.” Noting that while the popularity of documentaries has risen in recent years; “They're generally politically charged forays into the troubling issues of our times. ‘10 MPH’ heads off in another direction, taking us, regardless of age, on a sentimental journey to the cusp of adulthood when a sense of adventure was still an important virtue.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=At The Admiral – '10 MPH' across America starts in West Seattle |first= Bruce  |last= Bulloch |url=http://www.westseattleherald.com/2007/08/13/features/admiral-10-mph-across-america-starts-west-seattle |newspaper=[[West Seattle Herald]] |date=August 13, 2007 |accessdate=January 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of a more critical opinion, where ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', which commented, “The duo's hook for a movie is to document their gimmicky journey from Seattle to Boston on a Segway scooter. We never truly get inside the heads of these unlikely pioneers but scenic photography and lively side characters make for a diverting trip.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Monitor picks |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0601/p12s05-algn.html |newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=June 1, 2007 |accessdate=January 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a similar note, Lisa Kennedy of the ''[[Denver Post]]'', reflected that “The narration can be a tad earnest. The aesthetic is decidedly [[DIY]]. Still, "10 mph," with its wit, beckoning shots of splendid landscapes, and impromptu interviews, might have you humming [[Woody Guthrie]], ''[[This Land Is Your Land|This land is your land, this land is my land]]''.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Critics Choice |first= Lisa  |last= Kennedy |url=http://www.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_5982449 |newspaper=[[Denver Post]] |date=May 27, 2007 |accessdate=January 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a favorable review in the ''[[Boise Weekly]]'', Travis Estvold wrote “Though piloting a Segway seems a bit gimmicky, it does what the filmmakers probably intended: It attracts plenty of attention. But it also does something that may not have been intentional: The voyage of the battery-powered machine takes a backseat to the personalities of the filmmakers and the characters they meet along the way.” In the review Estvold complemented the documentary makers for somehow capturing “every cross section of [[Americana]] as they ever-so-slowly wound their way from the home of the Space Needle to the city of Fenway Park.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Slow and Steady Wins the Race |first= Travis  |last= Estvold |url=http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/slow-and-steady-wins-the-race/Content?oid=933235 |newspaper=[[Boise Weekly]] |date=August 1, 2007 |accessdate=January 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article on upcoming releases in 2007, the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' mentioned ''10&amp;nbsp;MPH'', calling it an “..amusingly offbeat documentary.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=DVD Report |first= Tom  |last= Russo |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2007/05/27/dvd_report/? |newspaper=[[Boston Globe]] |date=May 27, 2007 |accessdate=January 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Idaho Statesman]]'', Chad Dryden remarked; “10 MPH succeeds on many levels. For one, it’s a terrific American travelogue, taking the viewer through small-town charm, purple mountain majesty and the big city’s vibrating pulse. More importantly, it’s an inspiring story about cutting through the stagnancy of 21st-century life to follow your dreams.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='10 mph' filmmakers slate Boise appearance |first= Chad  |last= Dryden  |newspaper=[[Idaho Statesman]] |date= August 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calling the documentary “Charming and maddening”, Jordan Harper raised concerns with the main concepts of ''10&amp;nbsp;MPH'', writing in the ''[[Dallas Observer]]'', “...for good and ill: The American dream has been determined, and that dream is to become famous not for talent or beauty, but simply for doing something peculiar; if you can't be the [[American Idol]], be one of those jackasses from the auditions. The guys seem nice enough, and there are plenty of sweet slices of Americana, so you might find yourself torn. It's hard not to be drawn in by the film's good-natured vibe, but there's no getting around the urge to smack these guys and tell them to make their next movie about anything except themselves.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cannibal Corpse |first= Jordan |last= Harper |url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/2007-05-31/home-entertainment/cannibal-corpse  |newspaper=[[Dallas Observer]] |date= May 30, 2007 |accessdate=January 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artwork and soundtrack==

''10&amp;nbsp;MPH'' features artwork by the director's sister, Gannon Weeks, who also appeared in the film and performed [[public relations]], logistics, and other duties. The soundtrack features artists such as [[Brett Dennen]], [[Roman Candle (band)|Roman Candle]] and [[Daphne Loves Derby]].

'''''140''''' is a [[Platform game|platform]] game independently developed by Jeppe Carlsen, known for his gameplay direction for [[Playdead]]'s ''[[Limbo (video game)|Limbo]]''.  The game is described as a "minimalistic platformer", using electronic music to create [[synesthesia]] as the player makes his way through 4 different levels, each with their own soundtrack.&lt;ref name="gi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entry2013.php?id=666 | title = 140 - Entrant Page | publisher = [[Independent Games Festival]] | date = 2013 | accessdate = February 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gameplay has been compared to other similar games which involve music synchronization like ''[[Sound Shapes]]'' and the ''[[Bit.Trip]]'' series, though with difficult platforming elements comparable to games in the ''[[Mega Man]]'' series.&lt;ref name="gi"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/games/140/b/pc/archive/2013/02/14/limbo-designer-39-s-new-game-is-surreal.aspx | title = Limbo Designer's New Game Is Surreal | first = Adam | last = Biesenner | date = February 14, 2013 | accessdate = February 14, 2013 | work = [[Game Informer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eurogamer"/&gt; The game was released on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]], and [[Linux]] systems in October 2013, on [[Xbox One]] in August 2016, and on [[PlayStation 4]] as well as on [[Wii U]] in September 2016. A release on [[Playstation Vita]] and [[Nintendo 3DS]] was planned, but later cancelled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Carlsen |first=Jeppe |url=https://twitter.com/CarlsenGames/status/830701321862934528 |title=it has unfortunately been cancelled, 3DS as well.|publisher=Twitter.com |date=2017-02-12 |accessdate=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Gameplay==
As described by Carlsen, ''140'' is "an old school platformer", but where the challenge is "in syncing up your moves and jumps to the music-controlled elements"; as the player progresses through a level, the music will change reflecting the difficulty of the platforming elements.&lt;ref name="eurogamer"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-02-14-limbo-dev-shows-off-pet-project-140 | title = Limbo dev shows off pet project 140 | first = Jeffrey | last = Matulef | date = February 14, 2013 | accessdate = February 14, 2013 | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The player controls a geometric shape - a square when stationary, a circle when moving, and a triangle when jumping, across a two-dimensional environment made up of other simple geometric shapes, with the object to reach the end of the course. Various obstacles and enemies, also represented by geometric shapes, test the player's skills, and should the shape fall or be hit by one of these, they will need to restart at the last checkpoint they passed. Many of these obstacles and enemies have actions that are synchronized to the music, aiding the player in moving through the course; platforms that appear and disappear will do so on the beat, while enemies will fire in time to the music.&lt;ref name="edge review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edge-online.com/review/140-review/ | title = 140 review | publisher = [[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] | date = 2013-10-16 | accessdate = 2013-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

''140'' was a project developed by Carlsen in his off-hours from Playdead. The idea originally grew out of Carlsen's attempt at an old school platformer, akin to ''[[Mega Man]]'', that involved throwing a ball that would travel in straight lines and bounce off walls to trigger effects. Carlsen also used the project to learn about the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity game engine]].&lt;ref name="edge dev"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.edge-online.com/news/140-a-synthesis-of-sound-and-play-from-playdeads-puzzle-mastermind-jeppe-carlsen/ | title = 140, a synthesis of sound and play from Playdead’s puzzle mastermind Jeppe Carlsen | first = Neil | last = Long | date = 2013-10-14 | accessdate = 2013-10-16 | work = [[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; As he started to add audio samples to the game, he found an interesting juxtaposition between the normal platform elements and the music, where the level would "dance to the music", and refocused the game towards its final form.&lt;ref name="gamasutra road to idf"/&gt; Carlsen had worked on the title for about two years, and enlisted the help of Jakob Schmid, a college friend and fellow employee at Playdead,&lt;ref name="gamasutra road to idf"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/187261/Road_to_the_IGF_Jeppe_Carlsen_and_teams_140.php | title = Road to the IGF: Jeppe Carlsen and team's 140 | first = Christian | last = Nutt | date = 2013-02-25 | accessdate = 2013-03-13 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; who created all music and sound for the game, and Niels Fyrst and Andreas Peiterson for art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2013/2/14/3987754/limbo-gameplay-designer-goes-deep-into-the-world-of-sounds-and-shapes | title = Limbo gameplay designer goes deep into the world of sounds and shapes with 140 | first = Emily | last = Gera | date = February 14, 2013 | accessdate = February 14, 2013 | publisher = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlsen announced in April 2016 that Abstraction Games and Double Fine Presents were helping to port the game to the [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation Vita]], [[Xbox One]], [[Wii U]], and [[Nintendo 3DS]] with a release planned in Q4 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.us.playstation.com/2016/04/20/introducing-colorful-platformer-140-on-ps4-ps-vita/ | title = Introducing Colorful Platformer 140 on PS4, PS Vita | first = Jeppe | last = Carlsen | date = April 20, 2016 | accessdate = April 20, 2016 | work = [[PlayStation Blog]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.usgamer.net/articles/double-fine-is-publishing-a-console-release-of-the-rhythm-game-140 | title = Double Fine is Publishing a Console Release of the Rhythm Game 140 | first = Nadia | last = Oxford |date = April 21, 2016 | accessdate = April 21, 2016 | work = [[US Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Xbox One version was released on August 30, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://majornelson.com/2016/08/29/140-is-now-available-for-xbox-one/ | title = 140 Is Now Available For Xbox One | first = Larry | last= Hyrb | date = August 30, 2016 | accessdate = August 30, 2016 | work =Major Nelson's Xbox Blog }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game won the "Excellence in Audio" category for the 2013 [[Independent Games Festival]] awards,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/189152/Cart_Life_FTL_Faster_Than_Light_Little_Inferno_take_home_IGF_awards.php | title = Cart Life, FTL: Faster Than Light, Little Inferno take home IGF awards | date = 2013-03-27 | accessdate = 2013-03-27 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was an honorary mention in the "Technical Excellence" category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.igf.com/02finalists.html | title = 2013 Finalists | publisher = [[Independent Games Festival]] | date = 2013 | accessdate = February 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' considered the game to initially appear in stark contrast to Carlsen's earlier ''Limbo'', but as the player progresses in the game, the various mechanics of ''140'' show similar traits to many of the puzzles and situations that Carlsen had developed for ''Limbo''.&lt;ref name="edge review"/&gt; Ryan Cartmel of  [[Hardcore Gamer]] gave the game a 4/5, calling it "gaming minimalism done right." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cartmel |first=Ryan |url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2013/10/17/review-140/58853/ |title=Review: 140 |publisher=Hardcore Gamer |date=2013-10-17 |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derrick Sanskrit of [[The A.V. Club]]'s Gameological Society called ''140'' "a tightly paced and clever game of precise timing and jumping" and praised its minimalist structure that allows the player to focus on the rhythm and gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://gameological.com/2013/10/review-140/ | title = On the Beat | first = Derrick | last = Sanskrit | date = 2013-10-29 | accessdate = 2013-10-29 | publisher = [[The A.V.

'''Antithetic parallelism''' is a form of [[parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]] where the meaning of two or more excerpts of text are observed, although directly linked by providing the same meaning from differing perspectives. This type of [[parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]] is used in order to create repetition of meaning as a technique for cognitive reinforcement, thus more effectively communicating the meaning of the text.

== Examples ==

Examples of antithetic parallelism are found in [[Biblical poetry|Hebrew poetry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Antithetical Structure in Biblical Hebrew Poetry | last1=Krašovec | first1=Jože | isbn=9789004275584 | year=1984 | doi=10.1163/9789004275584 }}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[Psalms]] of the Bible:

The young lions lack and suffer hunger;
&lt;br /&gt;
But those who seek the LORD shall not lack any good thing. ([[Psalms]] 34:10)

More specifically, antithetical parallelism is defined as text where the meaning in the first part of the [[couplet]] contrasts with an opposite theme contained in the second part (see above). The use of opposites clarifies both extremes. In [[poetry]] the use of opposites can bring a sharper contrast to an image and provide a greater focus to the desired message. It is often marked by the use of the conjunction ‘but’, placed between two statements to juxtapose them and helps the reader or to view both the positive and negative perspectives of the text.

Antithetic parallelism is not to be confused with 'synonymous' or 'synthetic' [[parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]], which reflect repeated and expansive ideas respectively.

"'''Baby Shark'''" is a [[children's song]] about a family of sharks. It was popularized by social media and radio.

==History==
"Baby Shark" started as a [[campfire song]], where each member of a family of sharks is introduced with different hand motions. Different versions of the song have the sharks hunting fish, eating a sailor, or killing people who then go to heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Valens |first=Ana |url=https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/baby-shark-meme-youtube/ |title='Baby Shark' reminds us of the past—and that's what makes it a great meme |date=November 18, 2018 |work=The Daily Dot |accessdate=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===German version===
The dance version of "Baby Shark" was popularized online in a 2007 YouTube video named "Kleiner Hai" published by Alexandra Müller who is also known by her stage name alemuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/baby-shark-song-what-is-the-challenge-how-to-dance-where-did-it-come-from-a3927536.html |title=Where did the Baby Shark song come from? |work=Evening Standard |date=September 5, 2018 |accessdate=October 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version is set to the [[Jaws (soundtrack)|theme of ''Jaws'']] and tells the story of a baby shark who grows up and eats a swimmer.&lt;ref name=techly&gt;{{cite web |last=Pineros |first=Benjamin |url=https://www.techly.com.au/2018/09/18/behind-baby-shark-viral-sensation-sexism-german-memes-right-wing-chants/ |title=Sexism, German memes and right-wing chants: Behind the 'Baby Shark' viral sensation |date=September 18, 2018 |work=Techly |accessdate=October 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video gained popularity shortly after&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Schnappt der "kleine Hai" nach "Schnappi"? |url=https://www.bild.de/unterhaltung/musik/macht-schnappi-konkurrenz-4672826.bild.html#fromWall |publisher=Bild Zeitung online |date=May 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[:de:Alemuel|alemuel]] was offered a record deal by the label EMI Müller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alemuel Biografie |url=https://www.last.fm/de/music/Alemuel/+wiki |website=last fm |accessdate=October 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which published the song accompanied by disco beats on May 30, 2008. The single peaked at place 25 of the German charts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.offiziellecharts.de/titel-details-472294|title=Offizielle Deutsche Charts - Offizielle Deutsche Charts|website=www.offiziellecharts.de|language=de-de|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and place 21 of the Austrian charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://austriancharts.at/showitem.asp?interpret=Kleiner+Hai+feat.+Alemuel&amp;titel=Kleiner+Hai+-+dim+dim...&amp;cat=s|title=Kleiner Hai feat.

The German version of the song remains popular among German youth groups and multiple variations (also in different dialects of German &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hassendoerper |title=WRS Baby Hai |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf76OL1-92Q |website=YouTube |accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have been published since it first gained popularity in 2007.

===Pinkfong versions===
The "Baby Shark" song was popularized by a video produced by [[Pinkfong]], an education brand under [[South Korea]]n media startup [[SmartStudy]], titled "Baby Shark" ({{ko-hhrm|상어 가족||Sang-eo Gajok|lit=shark family}}) released on November 25, 2015, which has garnered over 140 million views {{as of|2018|December|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R93ce4FZGbc |title=Baby Shark {{!}} Animal Songs {{!}} PINKFONG Songs for Children|date=November 25, 2015|accessdate=October 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version of the song starts with bars from [[Antonín Dvořák]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)|Symphony No. 9]] which are reminiscent of music from the movie ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''. The song features a family of sharks which go hunt a school of fish which escape to safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sen |first=Indrani |url=https://qz.com/quartzy/1364335/the-story-behind-the-astonishingly-viral-baby-shark-youtube-video/ |title=The story behind the astonishingly viral Baby Shark YouTube video |work=Quartzy |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a viral video in [[Indonesia]] in 2017, and throughout the year it spread to many other [[Asia]]n countries, particularly those in [[Southeast Asia]]. The mobile app was among the top 10 most downloaded in the family apps category in [[South Korea]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]] and Indonesia in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PINKFONG |url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/pinkfong.official/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=1962729653947931 |website=www.facebook.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2018|December|}}, the dance version of the "Baby Shark" song, uploaded on June 17, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w |title=Baby Shark Dance {{!}} Sing and Dance! {{!}} Animal Songs {{!}} PINKFONG Songs for Children|date=June 17, 2016|accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; has received over 2.0 billion views worldwide, making it the [[List of most viewed YouTube videos|29th]] most viewed video on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rojakdaily.com/entertainment/article/3363/who-is-behind-the-viral-baby-shark-song-and-how-is-it-taking-over-our-lives |title=Who Is Behind The Viral 'Baby Shark' Song And How Is It Taking Over Our Lives? |website=Rojakdaily.com |accessdate=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its popularity, it has spurred an online dance craze (or referred to as ''Baby Shark Challenge'') around the world, while being cited as "the next big thing after the domination of [[Gangnam Style]]". [[K-pop]] groups including [[Girls' Generation]], [[Twice (band)|Twice]], [[Red Velvet (band)|Red Velvet]] and [[Black Pink]] have been credited with further spreading the viral song through their coverage of the song and dance, specifically on their featured TV shows and concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ramirez |first1=Elaine |title=How This 'Baby Shark' Video Went Insanely Viral In Indonesia |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/elaineramirez/2017/09/01/smartstudy-pinkfong-baby-shark-video-indonesia/#32aa9da073e1 |work=Forbes |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://philnews.ph/2017/09/27/baby-shark-dance-craze-south-korea-dominates-online-world/ |title="Baby Shark" Dance Craze From South Korea Dominates Online World |date=September 27, 2017 |publisher=Phil News |accessdate=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song began to go viral in the [[Western world]] in August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://qz.com/quartzy/1364335/the-story-behind-the-astonishingly-viral-baby-shark-youtube-video/ |title=The story behind the astonishingly viral Baby Shark YouTube video |last=Sen |first=Indrani |date=August 27, 2018 |work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |accessdate=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018, [[Ellen DeGeneres]] released her own version of the song on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', and [[James Corden]] performed a version on ''[[The Late Late Show with James Corden]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/james-corden-ellen-and-the-internet-why-is-everyone-dancing-to-baby-shark-nursery-jingle-1896665.html |title=James Corden, Ellen, and The Internet: Why is Everyone Dancing to 'Baby Shark' Nursery Jingle?|website=News18 |date=October 3, 2018 |accessdate=October 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was performed on ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in early December 2018 because it was requested by [[Simon Cowell]]'s four-year-old son Eric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dosani |first=Rishma |url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/12/02/simon-cowells-son-eric-makes-x-factor-debut-as-baby-shark-opens-final-show-8201067/ |title=Simon Cowell's son Eric makes X Factor debut as Baby Shark opens final show |date=2 December 2018 |work=Metro |accessdate=3 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the English version just listed members of the shark family, the Korean version says Mommy Shark is "pretty", Daddy Shark is "strong", Grandma Shark is "kind" and Grandpa Shark is "cool". In January 2018, the South Korean newspaper ''[[Kyunghyang Shinmun]]'' published a front-page editorial condemning these lyrics as sexist. In May 2018, the [[Liberty Korea Party]] started using "Baby Shark" to promote its candidates, prompting SmartStudy to threaten legal action over copyright infringement.&lt;ref name=techly/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ryall |first=Julian |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/05/baby-shark-songtoddler-viral-sensation-makes-waves-wrong-reasons/ |title=Viral children's song Baby Shark embroiled in row over sexism |date=September 5, 2018 |work=The Independent |accessdate=October 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Johnny" version===
The lyrics to another internet phenomenon song, "[[Johny Johny Yes Papa|Johnny Johnny Yes Papa]]", has been mashed up with "Baby Shark".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/krishrach/people-are-losing-it-over-this-johnny-johnny-and-baby-shark|title=People Are Freaking Out Over This "Johnny Johnny" And "Baby Shark" Video Mashup|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13838">'''The Center for Traditional Music and Dance (CTMD)''' is a leading folk/traditional arts organization based in [[New York City]]. Originally established as the Balkan Arts Center in 1968, CTMD assists the city's ethnic and immigrant communities in maintaining their traditions and cultural heritage. CTMD has developed a range of programs that emphasize research, documentation, collaboration, presentation, and education to help advance its mission of cultural equity. Over the past four decades, CTMD’s programs have led to the creation of nationally renowned ensembles, folk arts festivals, and community-based cultural organizations. CTMD provides the public with a full calendar of events designed to showcase and promote the diversity of New York City's performing arts traditions.

==History==
In 1968, towards the end of the North [[American Folk Music Revival]] and shortly after the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] was passed to replace the U.S. immigration quota system, Martin Koenig established the Balkan Arts Center in New York City to promote and foster an appreciation of Balkan dance traditions. Over the next few years Koenig, along with fellow New Yorker and folk music enthusiast Ethel Raim, also conducted fieldwork for [[Ralph Rinzler]] in an effort to scout artists and performers for the annual Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife (now known as the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]]). Raim eventually joined Koenig as co-director of the Balkan Arts Center in the mid-Seventies, around the same time as the establishment of the Folk Arts Program within the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and the enactment of the American Folklife Preservation Act. With the financial support of the NEA, Koenig and Raim proceeded to build an organization that would focus exclusively on the music and dance traditions of New York City's immigrant and ethnic populations.

Originally promoting the arts of Albanian, Macedonian, and Greek cultures, the Balkan Arts Center expanded its operations into other communities as New York's demographic makeup shifted with each new influx of immigrants. Over the course of four decades and two name changes (the Ethnic Arts Center in 1981 and the Center for Traditional Music and Dance in 1997), CTMD has worked with dozens of ethnic and immigrant communities throughout the five boroughs.

According to its current mission statement CTMD is a nonprofit organization "dedicated to preserving and presenting the performing arts traditions of New York’s immigrant and ethnic communities through research-based educational programming, public performance, and community partnerships."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ctmd.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Towards this end, CTMD has established and collaborated on a number of projects, including Community Cultural Initiatives (CCI), Sharing Traditions youth education programs, Touring Artist series, an extensive archive of audio and visual documents from over forty years of performances and events, the production of major festivals, the publication of printed materials, and the release of audio and visual recordings. These programs and projects are designed to advance the mission of cultural equity, a concept advanced by [[Alan Lomax]] in his appeal for the recognition of the right of every culture to promote and preserve its unique heritage and traditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.culturalequity.org/ace/ce_ace_appeal.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
'''Community Cultural Initiatives'''

According to the CTMD website, the Community Cultural Initiative (CCI) program is "the Center’s most effective tool for advancing its mission of cultural equity – the right of every cultural group to express and sustain its distinctive cultural heritage."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ctmd.org/CCI.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The multi-year CCI model places a strong emphasis on ethnographic fieldwork in New York City's ethnic and immigrant communities, collaboration with community members, documentation of events and artists, presentation of performing arts traditions to the wider public, and education in traditional music and dance for the youth. CCI programs are also designed to promote sustained interest in and financial support for the performing arts traditions of New York's diverse communities.

CCI programs are generally structured in three phases occurring over the course of five years. The first phase, lasting approximately one year, consists of initial contacts with musicians and teachers, investigation and documentation of local performing arts traditions, the establishment of working relationships between CTMD and community members, and an assessment of available resources and pressing needs in the community. The middle phase of the CCI model, generally lasting three years, involves program development through ongoing collaboration between CTMD and local artists, teachers, and organizations. CCI programs conclude with a transition to ongoing and self-sustaining cultural activities within immigrant and ethnic communities, sometimes with the development of new or strengthened autonomous cultural organizations.

Current CCI programs include work in the Chinese, Ukrainian, and Colombian communities, as well as the An-Sky Institute for Jewish Culture. Previous CCI programs have taken place in the Greek, Jewish, Italian, Irish, Puerto Rican, Albanian, Arab, Dominican, Asian-Indian, Indo-Caribbean, West African, Soviet Jewish, Filipino, Mexican, and Peruvian communities.

'''Sharing Traditions'''

The Sharing Traditions program began in the late 1990s as part of an effort to help foster awareness and appreciation among the youth of New York City's immigrant and ethnic communities for the traditional performing arts of their respective cultures. This program provides support for education in traditional music and dance, and has incorporated intensive classes and workshops for children in the Mountain Jewish, Bukharan Jewish, Indo-Caribbean, Mexican, Peruvian, Chinese, and Ukrainian communities. The Mariachi Academy of New York and Pachamama Peruvian Arts are two recent examples of successful organizations that evolved from Sharing Traditions programs.

'''Touring Artists'''

CTMD Touring Artists Program showcases performing arts ensembles from a variety of cultural traditions. Touring Artists works to bring these performers to stages across the United States in an effort to celebrate and cultivate awareness for the traditional performing arts.

'''Masters on Stage: Major Concerts and Festivals'''

CTMD presents both local and international artists each year through a variety of concerts, festivals, and workshops in New York City. These events include the Heritage Sunday Festival, produced in partnership with [[Lincoln Center]] Out of Doors, and the New York World Festival, produced in partnership with [[Central Park SummerStage]], World Music Institute, and Lotus Music and Dance. The fourth New York World Festival planned for Fall of 2010 will feature musical performers from countries surrounding the Black Sea.

'''Archives'''

The Center for Traditional Music and Dance has partnered with [[City Lore]] and World Music Institute to create the New York World Arts and Culture Archive (NYWACA). This consortium of archival collections is designed to provide a research network of printed materials, audio and visual recordings, and related information on New York City's immigrant and ethnic communities, as well as the history of the performance of world music in New York.

The Archive of the Center for Traditional Music and Dance houses an extensive collection of audio and visual recordings, photographs, and printed materials documenting the Center's research and programming over the past four decades. The Archive contains recordings and printed materials from over five hundred events and nearly one thousand performing artists. The bulk of the collection has been digitized and will soon be accessible online to the public. Currently, access to the archive is available by special request.

'''Recordings and Publications'''

Over the years CTMD has published numerous audio recordings, films, concert videos, liner notes, and other print publications. Major recordings include the Ethnic Heritage Recording Series and the Global Beat of the Boroughs series, produced in collaboration with Smithsonian Folkways. A full list of recordings and publications is available on CTMD's website.
	

'''Global Beat of the Boroughs'''

Global Beat of the Boroughs is an electronic newsletter that provides information about CTMD-related events, artist profiles, and news from New York City's traditional music scene. The newsletter began in May 2007 and is currently published several times per year.

'''Fiscal Sponsorship/Technical Assistance'''

CTMD provides a variety of services and training opportunities for artists, ensembles, and newly formed cultural organizations. These services include: accounting and book keeping services; artist management services; banking / financial support services; budgeting assistance; development/fund-raising; fiscal sponsorship for tax-deductible contributions; letters of support; mail and fax correspondence; tax form administration; project planning; promotion campaigns; stage production; strategic planning; website development.

'''Center for Art, Tradition, and Cultural Heritage (CATCH)'''

The Center for Art, Tradition, and Cultural Heritage is a joint project of CTMD, City Lore, World Music Institute, and Society for the Educational Arts. Still in its planning stages, CATCH is being designed as a major cultural center in New York for the presentation and preservation of the city's living cultural heritage. The facilities will include a theatre, gallery, library, music school, study center, cafe, gift shop, and an archive of historic images and recordings. CATCH will present concerts, theatrical productions, exhibitions, storytelling, and poetry presentations. In addition, the facility will also be able to host conferences and provide music classes.

The '''clown alley''' in a [[Circus (performing art)|circus]] is a [[wiktionary:backstage|backstage]] area, usually very near the animal pens, where [[clown]]s change into their [[costume]]s and apply [[makeup]].  Generally, the clowns' personal [[Theatrical property|prop]]s, costumes, and other items are stored in this area as well. Clown alley was usually very close to the Big Top tents, along the side like an alley, so the clowns could get in and out quickly. If the circus show had some problem with a performance, the [[Ringmaster (circus)|ringmaster]] could yell out "Clowns Allez" meaning “Clowns Go!”. Today most clowns do not use tents for dressing and markup, as [[travel trailer]] or [[motor homes]] are used. The term has also come to mean any professional grouping of clowns, in general, regardless of whether or not they are affiliated with a [[circus]] or [[carnival]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaboutclowns.com/clownalley.html allaboutclowns.com, clown alley]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Clowns of America International]], "clown alley" is the name given to individual chapters, which function similarly to a union. A '''Clown Alley Local''' will co-ordinate social events as well as professional development for members, as well as direct employment opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coai.org/ Clowns of America International]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CollegeHumor''' is a humor [[website]] based in [[Los Angeles]] and owned by InterActiveCorp ([[IAC (company)|IAC]]). The site features daily original humor videos and articles created by its in-house writing and production team, in addition to user-submitted videos, pictures, articles and links. It was created by [[Josh Abramson]] and [[Ricky Van Veen]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mixergy.com/interviews/collegehumor-josh-abramson/|title=How A Couple Of Freshmen Built CollegeHumor Into A Profitable Cultural Phenomenon - with Josh Abramson - Mixergy|work=Mixergy|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; CollegeHumor is operated by Electus Digital, which operates Dorkly.com and Watchloud.com in addition to CollegeHumor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electus digital |publisher= Electus digital, LLC. |url=http://www.electus.com/digital |accessdate=2017-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CHMedia''' is also a partner of the website [[BustedTees]], an online clothing website.

Many of its staff also operate the sister website ''Dorkly'', centering on [[video games]] and video game parodies in the vein of CollegeHumor.

==History==
The site was created in December 1999 by [[Josh Abramson]] and [[Ricky Van Veen]], with help from web developer [[Jakob Lodwick]]. Abramson and Van Veen were high school friends from [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. The site traffic averages approximately 10 million monthly unique visitors, according to [[Quantcast]] direct measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quantcast.com/collegehumor.com|title=Quantcast Audience Profile|publisher=[[Quantcast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abramson said in an interview, "[We wanted to start] an advertisement-based business because at the time the advertising market was pretty hot and we’d seen other people develop Web sites that were popular making a lot of money." Their aim was to create a humor site that would appeal to the advertiser-friendly college-aged demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,199656,00.html|title=Business at Collegehumor.com Is No Joke|last=Carothers|first=Carrie|date=2006-06-15|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CollegeHumor, along with its parent company, Connected Ventures, was acquired by [[Barry Diller]]'s [[IAC (company)|IAC]] in August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iac.com/media-room/press-releases/iac-acquires-controlling-interest-connected-ventures-llc-parent-leading|title=IAC Acquires Controlling Interest in Connected Ventures, LLC, Parent of Leading Comedy Site CollegeHumor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy|Brian Murphy]] (amongst others), these sketches are designed to be more [[Viral video|viral]] in nature than the site's other comedy content.

'''Hardly Working'''

'''Jake and Amir'''
{{main|Jake and Amir#Jake and Amir (web series)}}
:A series of short sketches about two former CH writers, [[Jake Hurwitz]] and [[Amir Blumenfeld]], who often act out the [[double act|odd couple act]]. The show depicts Jake as a regular guy constantly annoyed by Amir's idiotic antics, while Amir sincerely just wants to be good friends with Jake.
:Jake and Amir was one of the most popular shows on College Humor. Along with taking home a Webby Award, the show possessed a large{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=October 2015}} fanbase. The show's final episode aired in April 2015.

'''Full Benefits'''

'''TV RPG'''
:An animated parody of popular TV series using the likeness of retro-style [[role-playing games]].

'''POV'''
:Sketches shot from the point-of-view of the main character, often voiced by Vincent Peone, CollegeHumor's cinematographer. These sketches are known for realism and relatability (in a humorous manner) and are among CH's most popular videos. In most POV videos the phrase "How is that even possible?" is often used as a running gag.
:Perhaps one of the most sought-after shows from CollegeHumor, many commenters have been clamoring for more POV shows ever since it went on hiatus in November 2011. The series returned in August 2012.

'''The Six'''
:A set of videos starring Josh Ruben, each of which feature six outrageous scenarios in certain situations, such as getting out of the friend zone or having "monsters" for roommates. The videos are narrated in second-person, using Ruben as an analogy for the viewer.

'''Every 7 Seconds'''
:Making fun of the theory that men will think about sex every seven seconds, a man is put in a variety of scenarios where things become progressively awkward due to the fact he really does think about sex every seven seconds.

'''Prank War'''
:A series that documents the escalating pranks that are played between former CH staffers [[Streeter Seidell]] and [[Amir Blumenfeld]]. Prank War gained national notoriety after Amir staged a fake public marriage proposal from Streeter to his girlfriend Sharon at a [[New York Yankees]] game. The incident was known as “[http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1774718 The Yankee Prankee]" and was later featured on  [[VH1]]'s "40 Greatest Pranks Part 2".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Twenty (Intentionally) Funniest Web Videos of 2007 |publisher=[[New York Magazine]] |date=2007-11-11 |url=http://nymag.com/movies/features/videos/40663 |accessdate=2008-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seidell and Blumenfeld have appeared twice on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' to discuss their pranks.

'''Dire Consequences'''
:A Series involving Kevin Corrigan and Brian Murphy, who each bet each other to do a wacky action, such as wearing progressively smaller clothes as a day goes by, or playing paintball solo against the United States [[Delta Force]]. The person who does these things is usually chosen at the beginning of the episode.

'''IRL Files'''
:Stories about a never-seen narrator who gets involved in wacky situations.

'''[[Very Mary-Kate]]'''
:A series that revolves around the life of [[Mary-Kate Olsen]] (played by [[Elaine Carroll]]), a rich young woman who is heir to [[Woody Allen]], and her sensible [[bodyguard]].

'''Hello, My Name Is...'''
:A series starring Pat Cassels and Josh Ruben. Ruben is placed in prosthetic and make-up by their make-up artist Hannah. From the prosthetic, Ruben spontaneously creates a character which Pat then interviews.

'''Troopers'''
: A series that parodies of sci-fi movies and shows, particularly ''[[Star Wars]]''. Shorts mostly focus on a pair of stormtrooper-like soldiers, Larry and Rich, and the humorous problems that arise from working for an evil interstellar empire aboard a small, moon-sized, planet-destroying space station. Features [[Aubrey Plaza]] in a guest role.

'''Dinosaur Office'''
: A stop-motion series released via Nintendo Video on the Nintendo 3DS/2DS. The stop-motion shorts focus on Craig the [[Triceratops]] and Todd the [[Apatosaurus]] as they work at DinoSoft Limited with co-workers Sheila the [[Stegosaurus]], Richard the [[Diplodocus]], various interns, and their boss Terry the [[Tyrannosaurus]]. The dinosaurs face typical office problems such as rushing to meet deadlines and trying to decide what to have for lunch while also facing less typical problems such as asteroid warnings on the news, volcano drills, and corporate takeovers.

'''BearShark'''
: A traditionally animated series that features a bear and a shark teaming up to eat a man named Steve, and always succeeding (though Steve always comes back), only for them to slowly develop a friendship with him. This series received its own video game in 2013 on the [[Nintendo eShop]].

'''Badman'''
: A series that parodies the [[Christopher Nolan]] [[Batman]] films. The shorts involve [[Batman]] (played by [[Pete Holmes]]), who—unlike in the movies and comics—is portrayed as oblivious and incompetent, much to the annoyance of friends and foes alike.

'''Precious Plum'''
: A series starring Josh Ruben and [[Very Mary-Kate]] star [[Elaine Carroll]] and written by Carroll and CollegeHumor's president of original content, [[Sam Reich]]. It is a parody of Honey Boo Boo. It has replaced [[Very Mary-Kate]] in the Thursday release slot of Collegehumor, and [[Sam Reich]] has announced that there will be two more episodes over the next two weeks, and more will be made imminently.

'''The Adventures of Kim Jong Un'''
: A cartoon series which is a parody of the [[Kim Jong-un|Supreme Leader]] of North Korea and the propaganda of that country. Kim Jong-un is shown to possess various abilities and powers, which he uses to battle enemies of the state, plotting to harm [[North Korea|True Korea]]. His adversaries are generally depicted as weak and foolish individuals. Typically the ending of each episode features a scene in which Kim Jong-un's recently deceased [[Kim Jong-il|father]] returns from the dead in some way and violently fights with his son. His enemies are mostly shown as democratic leaders like Obama. He rides on a unicorn that flies on a flying carpet.

'''Furry Force'''
: A cartoon series featuring anthropomorphic superheroes which won the 2014 Ursa Major award for "Best Anthropomorphic Dramatic Short Work or Series."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ursamajorawards.org/UMA_2014.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''If Google was a guy'''

: Actor [[Brian Huskey]] personifies the search engine [[Google]], who deals with a variety of people who come into his office and tells him what to search. He reacts to the search depending on the person searching and the actual question. Cameos of other website personas include [[WebMD]] and [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]].
'''[[Hot Date]]'''
: Brian Murphy and Emily Axford attempt a lovely night out for a romantic meal, but sadly blow their chances by bringing themselves.

'''Past series'''
: Previously, CH Originals produced [[The Michael Showalter Showalter]], a [[Charlie Rose]]-style comedic interview series hosted by [[Michael Showalter]] and featuring guests such as [[Paul Rudd]], [[Andy Samberg]], [[David Cross]], [[Zach Galifianakis]], and [[Michael Cera]]. They also gained notoriety for "Street Fighter: The Later Years", which was nominated for "Best Series" by YouTube's Video Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=YouTube 2007 Video Awards |publisher= [[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/ytawards07 |accessdate=2008-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, they featured Bad Dads, a series of five, three-minute shorts starring [[Michael Cera]] and Will Hines. The series was written, directed, and produced by [[Derek Westerman]].
:Also previously produced by College Humor were Bleep Bloop and Nerd Alert. Bleep Bloop was a video-game-based talk show hosted by Jeff Rubin and Patrick Cassels, featuring various guests. Many comedians were featured on the show. Some of the most memorable were [[Pete Holmes]], Jamie Lee, [[Christian Finnegan]], and pro skater Billy Rohan.

'''College circuit''' is a form of [[motion picture]] [[Film distributor|distribution]] where old films as well as new ones are shown on college campuses, usually in the evening. The selections range from [[art house]] fare to [[wide release]] films and cult classics (also see [[midnight movies]] for a similar practice).

== Origins ==
Beginning in the 1950s and 60's, classes in [[Film|cinema]] theory and history began to be taught at colleges across the [[United States]]. To facilitate the growing interest in film, prints were screened for a reduced price for students. Several movies have been salvaged thanks to this practice, including most notably [[Citizen Kane]].

== Criticisms ==
Some of the movies popular on college circuits throughout the years have been either controversial or of specious [[artistic merit]]. The content of the movies often appeal to college-age sensibilities. Critics like [[Roger Ebert]] have expressed suspicion of such films when deemed "artistic", and instead charges them as misleading by presenting exploitive material (such as sex, violence, and drug use) by means that are more aesthetically pleasing to those educated in [[Film studies|cinema studies]] than say, a [[grindhouse]] film, and therefore they become more acceptable to an "intellectual audience". This is an argument sometimes leveled against [[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]] or the ouvre of [[Ken Russell]]. Often the films are of no discernible artistic merit at all, but instead appeal to the culture of college life, such as in the case of the Beatles' [[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]].

== Movies Popular on the College Circuit ==
* [[Citizen Kane]]
* [[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]
* [[The Devils (film)|The Devils]]
* [[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]
* [[Eraserhead]]
* [[Donnie Darko]]
* [[Rocky Horror Picture Show]]
* [[Pink Flamingos]]
* [[Hedwig and the Angry Inch (film)|Hedwig and the Angry Inch]]

A version for [[Nintendo DS]] was released in 2008.

The [[Nintendo DS]] version is similar to its console counterpart, but it does not feature the attributes from them. It was developed by [[Jack of All Games]]. It features only a part of the cars and tracks from the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Windows]] version (12 cars and 8 tracks, opposed to 33 cars and almost 30 tracks) and similar events appear in the game.

==Background==
In July 2017, a rumor surfaced that ''Culture II'' was on a hard drive that was lost by [[Quavo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berry|first=Peter A.|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/07/quavo-loses-hard-drive-culture-2-on-it/|title=Quavo Loses Track of Hard Drive With 'Culture 2' on It|website=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|date=July 17, 2017|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migos confirmed that a single from the album will be dropping soon and was previewed on ''[[Rap-Up]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2017/10/16/migos-previews-culture-2-single/|title=Migos Previews 'Culture II' Single|website=[[Rap-Up]]|date=October 16, 2017|accessdate=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipation regarding the upcoming album built due to the [[Atlanta]] rap group's use of social media. Posts included many names such as [[Kanye West]], [[Donald Glover]] and others who they have worked with, and revealed on January 22 that West helped produce the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coleman II|first=C.

''Culture II'' received &lt;!-- USE Metacritic's wording --&gt;generally positive reviews from critics. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an [[weighted arithmetic mean|average]] score of 69, based on 19 reviews.&lt;ref name="Metacritic"/&gt; Dave Heaton of ''[[PopMatters]]'' praised the album saying, "While not all of these 24 songs are equally impressive, nothing about ''Culture II'' feels like they're going through the motions."&lt;ref name="PopMatters"/&gt; Jordan Bassett of ''[[NME]]'' said, "Migos are firing on all cylinders here, their new record a lush, chaotic patchwork that pops with primary colours. The fab three have done it again."&lt;ref name="NME"/&gt; [[Alex Petridis]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated that "for such a gargantuan album, it's surprisingly light on its feet, skipping nimbly between musical styles", complimenting the album's production, but criticising the lyrical themes.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; Dan Weiss of ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' said, "The trio gave a double album their best, with plenty of head-turning lines, hilarious stray shouts ("dinner rolls!" on "CC" is a fave), and productions that further dilate the luxury trap spectrum, but not wildly so."&lt;ref name="COS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weiss|first=Dan|title=Migos Deliver More of the Same on the Sprawling Culture II|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/02/album-review-migos-deliver-more-of-the-same-on-the-sprawling-culture-ii/|work=Consequence of Sound|date=February 1, 2018|accessdate=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review, Neil Z. Yeung of [[AllMusic]] states, "With enough highlights to form a single digestible effort, Migos could have delivered another culture-defining classic with just a little trimming. Instead, they've taken what should have been a potent, big league statement and diluted it."&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; Meaghan Garvey of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' said, "It's still a joy to hear the Migos rap, which is why it's especially depressing that ''Culture II'' ultimately feels like a drag—a formless grab bag compiled without much care."&lt;ref name="Pitchfork"/&gt; Scott Glaysher of ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' said, "Although the creative achievements aren't revolutionary, they are thorough and consistent."&lt;ref name="XXL"/&gt;

In a mixed review, ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s Charles Aaron stated: "''Culture II'' ultimately feels less like a celebratory howl from the mountaintop than a transitional inventory dump. With its easily-trimmable 24 tracks, ''Culture II'' appears to be tailored to finesse chart rules, which count 1,500 individual song streams toward one full album sale."&lt;ref name="RollingStoneReview"/&gt; In another mixed review, ''[[Exclaim!]]''{{'}}s Calum Slingerland stated: "Having more songs available to stream results in more royalties, though it doesn't equate to a flawless full-length."&lt;ref name="exclaim.ca"/&gt; [[Kitty Empire]] of ''[[The Observer]]'' said, "''Culture II'' was never going to be a modest affair, in which three self-effacing twentysomethings quietly enumerated their blessings. Apart from some anxiety ("Tryna be like the Carters/Gotta be like the Carters" – Too Playa) and exhaustion (Work Hard), ''Culture II'' is wall-to-wall diamonds, watches, cars, chains, brands, fashion houses and exotic fauna."&lt;ref name="The Observer"/&gt; Arcade of [[Sputnikmusic]] saying "''Culture II'' sounds like a satire of every other rap album released by a major label these days, catering to the lowest common denominator of casual music listener. As a business decision, it's genius; as a piece of music, it's little more than an elaborate consumer scam."&lt;ref name="SM"/&gt;

==Commercial performance==
''Culture II'' debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 199,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s, of which 38,000 were pure album sales in its first week.&lt;ref name="Billboard"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8097981/migos-culture-ii-debuts-at-no-1-on-billboard-200-albums-chart|title=Migos' 'Culture II' Debuts at No. 1 on Billboard 200 Albums Chart|work=Billboard|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|date=February 4, 2018|accessdate=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is Migos' second US number-one album.&lt;ref name="Billboard"/&gt; On May 10, 2018, ''Culture II'' was certified [[RIAA certification|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for combined sales, streaming and track-sales equivalent of a million units.&lt;ref name="RIAA"/&gt;

'''Dai Vernon''' (pronounced alternatively as DIE or as DAY as in David&lt;ref&gt;When asked which way to pronounce his first name, Vernon would say "either, or either," (i.e, EE-ther or EYE-ther) Vernon, Dai. ''The Vernon Touch: The Writings of Dai Vernon in Genii, The Conjurors' Magazine from 1968 to 1990.'' Washington, DC: The Genii Corporation, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;) (June 11, 1894 &amp;ndash; August 21, 1992), a.k.a. '''The Professor''', was a Canadian [[Magician (illusion)|magician]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |first= Lee A.|last= Daniels|authorlink= |title= Dai Vernon, 98; An Expert Magician Who Taught Others |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DB1730F93AA1575BC0A964958260 |quote= Dai Vernon, a sleight of hand artist who was a mentor to many of the most accomplished magicians of the last half-century, died Aug. 21 at the home of a son, Edward Wingfield Verner, in Ramona, Calif., where he had lived for the last two years. He was 98 years old. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 29, 1992 |accessdate=2007-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His expert [[sleight of hand]] technique and extensive knowledge, particularly with [[card trick]]s and [[close-up magic]], garnered him respect among fellow magicians.  His influence was considerable in the magic world of the 20th Century, and he was a mentor to numerous famous magicians. He lived out his last years at the [[Magic Castle]], a nightclub in [[Hollywood, California]].

==Biography==
Vernon was born in [[Ottawa]] as David Frederick Wingfield Verner. While performing, he often mentioned that he had learned his first trick from his father at age seven, adding wryly that he had "wasted the first 6 years" of his life.  His father was a government worker and an amateur magician. Vernon studied [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]], but by [[World War I]] he had moved to [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Vernon first fell in love with magic when he was seven years old after his father took him to see a magic show. The first real magic book he ever owned was an early edition of perhaps the most famous card book of them all, ''[[The Expert at the Card Table]]'', by [[S. W. Erdnase]].&lt;ref name="erdnase"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Expert at the Card Table: The Classic Treatise on Card Manipulation]]|last=Erdnase|first=S. W|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1995|isbn=978-0-486-28597-9|edition=1st Ed. reprint|location=Mineola, NY da|page=144 pages|authorlink=S. W. Erdnase}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2008-01-04--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time he was 13 he had memorized the contents of the book.  He also had a famous encounter with another up-and-coming young magician from his town, Cliff Green, who asked Vernon, "What kind of magic do you do?" Vernon responded by asking the boy to name a card. Upon pulling a pack of cards from his pocket, Vernon turned over the top card of the deck to reveal the named card and replied to the speechless Green "That's the kind of magic I do. What kind of magic do you do?"

As a young man, Vernon moved to New York where, in the back room of Clyde Powers' magic shop, he found favor among many of the great magicians of the era, including Dr. [[James William Elliott (magician)|James William Elliott]] and [[Harry Kellar]].

He began to use the first name "Dai" after a newspaper used the name in place of "David"; the paper actually was using the Welsh nickname for David. When Verner first moved to the United States, the male member of a popular ice-skating pair had the surname Vernon; Americans continually mistook Verner's last name to be the same as the popular ice skater, and eventually the magician became fed up with correcting people and simply adopted "Vernon" as well.

Owing to his extraordinary knowledge of, and skill at, sleight of hand, Vernon has long been affectionately known as ''The Professor''. [[Harry Houdini]] (who in his early years billed himself as "The King of Kards") often boasted that if he saw a card trick performed three times in a row he would be able to figure it out.  Vernon then showed Houdini a trick where he removed the top card of the deck and placed it second from the top, then turned over the top card to again reveal the original card.  Houdini watched Vernon do the trick seven times, each time insisting that Vernon "do it again." Finally, Houdini's wife and Vernon's friends said, "Face it, Houdini, you're fooled." For years afterward, Vernon used the title ''The Man Who Fooled Houdini'' in his advertisements.

Though respected by professional magicians nationwide due in part to publicity via the magazine ''[[The Sphinx (magazine)|The Sphinx]]'', Vernon was essentially a gifted amateur until his 40s. Before the Magic Castle, Vernon never held a steady full-time job for more than a few months. He occasionally performed magic at nightclubs or on cruise ships to South America and back, and also toured the [[Philippines]] as an entertainer during WW2 with the [[United Service Organizations]]. His engineering degree was put to use as a sometime [[blueprint]] reader. However, Vernon's main source of income was cutting custom [[silhouette]] portraits, a talent that paid 25 to 50 cents per silhouette for about two minutes work during the 1920s and '30s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; A few hours a week cutting silhouettes was generally enough to support his family and finance his sleight of hand hobby (compare his silhouette fee with the first US minimum wage of 25 cents per hour in 1938). Vernon spent most of his early life traveling all over the United States of America looking for card cheats, and anyone who might know anything about sleight-of-hand with cards.  He was famously under-credited for much of the work published in Jean Hugard and Frederick Braue's ''Expert Card Technique'',&lt;ref name="hugard"&gt;{{cite book|title=Expert Card Technique: Close-Up Table Magic|last=Hugard|first=Jean|author2=Braue, Frederick|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1974|isbn=978-0-486-21755-0|edition=1st Ed. reprint|location=Mineola, NY|page=448 pages}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2008-01-04--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; though a later edition included an extra chapter which acknowledges Vernon's contributions.  In fact, a huge portion of the sleight-of-hand had been discovered by Vernon over years of searching.

Among magicians, he is credited with inventing or improving many standard close-up effects with cards, coins, and other small items.  The "standard" [[Cups and balls]] routine is his, and his 6-ring "Symphony of the Rings" remains one of the most popular [[Chinese linking rings]] routines in use to this day.

Vernon spent the last thirty years of his life as Magician-in-Residence and star attraction at [[The Magic Castle]] in [[Los Angeles]], California.  There he mentored numerous well-known magicians including [[Ricky Jay]], [[Persi Diaconis]], [[Doug Henning]], [[Larry Jennings]], [[Bruce Cervon]], [[Michael Ammar]] and [[John Carney (magician)|John Carney]].

==Family==
In 1924, Vernon married Eugenie "Jeanne" Hayes, a diminutive [[magician's assistant]]. They would have two sons, Theodore and Derek. Jeanne eventually tired of Dai's wanderlust, [[spendthrift]] money habits, and obsession with card tricks, and the couple lived separately by the 1950s. They never formally divorced.

==Death==

'''''Dracula's Daughter''''' is a 1936 American [[vampire film|vampire]] [[horror film]] produced by [[Universal Pictures]] as a [[sequel]] to the 1931 film ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]''. Directed by [[Lambert Hillyer]] from a screenplay by [[Garrett Fort]], the film stars [[Otto Kruger]], [[Gloria Holden]] in the title role, [[Marguerite Churchill]] and features, as the only cast member to return from the original, [[Edward Van Sloan]] &amp;ndash; although his character's name was altered from Van Helsing to ''Von'' Helsing.

''Dracula's Daughter'' tells the story of Countess Marya Zaleska, the daughter of [[Count Dracula]] and herself a vampire. Following Dracula's death, she believes that by destroying his body she will be free of his influence and live normally. When this fails, she turns to a psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Garth ([[Otto Kruger]]). He, in turn, has a fiance, Janet ([[Marguerite Churchill]]). The Countess kidnaps Janet and takes her to Transylvania, leading to a battle between Dr. Garth and the Countess in an attempt by him to save Janet. 

Ostensibly based on a [[short story]] titled "[[Dracula's Guest and Other Weird Stories|Dracula's Guest]]" by [[Bram Stoker]], the film bears little or no resemblance to the original source material. [[David O. Selznick]] initially purchased the rights to the story for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Selznick, likely knowing he could not legally make the film because of Universal's copyright on the original film, sold the rights to Universal. After first assigning the picture to [[James Whale]], Universal production head [[Carl Laemmle, Jr.]] finally put Hillyer in the director's chair.

While not as successful as the original upon its release, the film was generally well-reviewed. In the intervening decades, criticism has been deeply divided. Contemporary critics and scholars have noted the film's strong lesbian overtones, which Universal acknowledged from the start of production and exploited in some early advertising. Universal completed their initial ''Dracula'' trilogy in 1943 with ''[[Son of Dracula (1943 film)|Son of Dracula]]''.

==Plot==
''Dracula's Daughter'' begins a few moments after ''Dracula'' ends. [[Count Dracula]] has just been destroyed by [[Abraham Van Helsing|Professor Von Helsing]] &lt;!--in this film the character's name is spelled VON Helsing so please do not change it --&gt;([[Edward Van Sloan]]). Von Helsing is taken by police to [[Scotland Yard]], where he explains that he indeed did destroy Count Dracula, but because he had already been dead for over 500 years, it cannot be considered murder. Instead of hiring a lawyer, he enlists the aid of a psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Garth ([[Otto Kruger]]), who was once one of his star students.

Meanwhile, Dracula's daughter, Countess Marya Zaleska ([[Gloria Holden]]), with the aid of her manservant, Sandor ([[Irving Pichel]]), steals Dracula's body from Scotland Yard and ritualistically burns it, hoping to break her curse of vampirism. However, Sandor soon begins to discourage her  telling her that all that is in her eyes is "death." She soon gives into her thirst for blood. The Countess resumes her hunting, mesmerizing her victims with her exotic jeweled ring. After a chance meeting with Dr. Garth at a society party, the Countess asks him to help her overcome the influence she feels from beyond the grave. The doctor advises her to defeat her cravings by confronting them and the Countess becomes hopeful that her will, plus Dr. Garth's science, will be strong enough to overcome Dracula's malevolence.

The Countess sends Sandor to fetch her a model to paint; he returns with Lili ([[Nan Grey]]). Countess Zaleska initially resists her urges but succumbs and attacks her. Lili survives the attack and is examined by Dr. Garth through hypnosis; she reveals enough information to let Dr. Garth know that it was Countess Zaleska that attacked her, but suffers heart failure and dies. The Countess gives up fighting her urges and accepts that a cure is not possible; she lures Dr. Garth to [[Transylvania]] by kidnapping Janet ([[Marguerite Churchill]]), his secretary, whom he has a playfully antagonistic relationship with, but now realizes that he cares for her. Zaleska intends to transform Dr. Garth into a vampire to be her eternal companion. Arriving at Castle Dracula in Transylvania, Dr. Garth agrees to exchange his life for Janet's. Before he can be transformed, Countess Zaleska is destroyed when Sandor shoots her through the heart with an arrow as revenge for her breaking her promise to make him immortal. He takes aim at Dr. Garth but is shot dead by a Scotland Yard policeman who, along with Von Helsing, have followed Dr. Garth from London.

==Production==
[[File:EdwardVanSloanDraculasDaughterTrailerScreenshot1936.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Van Sloan]] as [[Van Helsing]]]]

Universal originally did not hold the rights to "[[Dracula's Guest and Other Weird Stories|Dracula's Guest]]", a chapter excised from [[Bram Stoker]]'s original novel and the purported source material for the film. The story includes an encounter between a man (presumed by some to be [[Jonathan Harker]] although the character is not identified as such) and a female vampire. The story does not establish a filial relationship between the female vampire and Dracula. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] executive [[David O. Selznick]] negotiated a contract in 1933 with Stoker's widow, [[Florence Stoker|Florence]], to buy the rights to the chapter for an advance of $500 against a purchase price of $5,000. MGM's lawyers and executives were worried about the use of the word "Dracula" in the film's title, fearing that Universal would take legal action, although Selznick's contract with Stoker explicitly listed "Dracula's Daughter" as a possible alternate title. The project was code-named "Tarantula" in correspondence.&lt;ref name="skal1968" /&gt;

Selznick hired [[John L. Balderston]], who had previously worked on the 1931 ''Dracula'' and ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', to write the screenplay. Balderston's screenplay involved tying up loose ends from the original film. In it, Von Helsing returns to Transylvania to destroy the [[Brides of Dracula|three vampire brides]] seen in ''Dracula'' but overlooks a fourth tomb concealing Dracula's daughter. She follows him back to London and operates under the name "Countess Szekelsky". She attacks a young aristocrat and Von Helsing and the aristocrat's fiancée track her back to Transylvania and destroy her. The script included scenes that implied that Dracula's daughter enjoyed torturing her male victims and that while under her control the men liked it too. Also included were shots of the Countess's chambers being stocked with whips and straps, which she would never use on-screen but whose uses the audience could imagine. Regardless of any objections that the [[Production Code Administration]] (PCA) would have raised to many aspects of the scenario, Balderston's script could never have been filmed because Selznick's contract with Stoker expressly barred him from using any Bram Stoker characters that did not appear in "[[Dracula's Guest and Other Weird Stories|Dracula's Guest]]". Selznick re-sold the rights to "Dracula's Guest" to Universal in September 1935&lt;ref name="skal1968"&gt;Skal, pp. 196–98&lt;/ref&gt; for $12,500, which included the rights to Balderston's scenario.&lt;ref name="curtis260"&gt;Curtis, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; Horror film scholar [[David J. Skal]] theorizes that this was Selznick's actual motivation in buying the rights in the first place, to profit from Universal's desire for a sequel by tying up the only obvious source material.&lt;ref&gt;Skal, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

Universal studio head Carl Laemmle, Jr. (nicknamed "Junior") wanted [[James Whale]], fresh from his great success with ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', to direct ''Dracula's Daughter''. Whale was idle, waiting for [[Irene Dunne]] to finish work on ''[[Magnificent Obsession (1935 film)|Magnificent Obsession]]'' so she could begin work on Whale's ''[[Show Boat (1936 film)|Show Boat]]''. Wary of directing two horror films in a row, Whale instead convinced Laemmle to buy the rights to a mystery novel called ''The Hangover Murders''. Laemmle agreed only after extracting a promise from Whale that he would direct ''Dracula's Daughter'' next.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, pp. 254–55&lt;/ref&gt; Whale completed work on the film, titled ''[[Remember Last Night?]]'' for release, on September 14, 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; ''Magnificent Obsession'' completed filming on October 29. With Dunne freed up, Whale went to work on ''Show Boat''. Laemmle replaced him with [[A. Edward Sutherland]], who was best known for his work on comedies. Sutherland had as little interest in ''Dracula's Daughter'' as Whale and soon left the studio,&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, pp. 260–61&lt;/ref&gt; and Hillyer came on to direct.

===Universal script===
The earliest scenario for the Universal film was written by [[R. C. Sherriff]]. It began with three scenes set in the 14th Century and centered on the Dracula legend. It then switched to the present day, focusing on two engaged couples who visit Transylvania. The men explore the ruins of Dracula's castle. One is later found, insane, and the other goes missing. Professor Von Helsing is summoned and he tracks the missing man to London, where he is in thrall to Dracula's daughter, the Countess Szelinski (sic). When she attempts to flee with her thrall to the Orient by ship, Von Helsing and three others book passage on the same ship. During a violent storm, Von Helsing destroys Dracula's daughter and, with her hold over the men broken, the scenario closes with a double wedding. This version was submitted on August 28, 1935 to the [[British Board of Film Censors]], which rejected it, saying in part "... ''Dracula's Daughter'' would require half a dozen ... languages to adequately express its beastliness." On September 10 Sherriff met with BBFC representatives and submitted a revised scenario two days later. This scenario was passed but because its details were not recorded by the BBFC it is unknown how much it differed from the original or how much if any of that scenario was retained in the final script.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson pp. 65–66&lt;/ref&gt;

Universal also submitted Sheriff's first draft to the PCA on September 5, 1935 and encountered stronger resistance from PCA enforcer [[Joseph Breen]] than it had from the British. Breen reported back that the script "contains countless offensive stuff which makes the picture utterly impossible for approval under the Production Code."&lt;ref&gt;Breen, quoted in Skal, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; A second draft was submitted on October 21, but it too was rejected, with many of Breen's objections centering on the 14th Century scenes in which Dracula himself appeared. It is unclear whether this submission was the same submission that the BBFC had previously passed. A third Sheriff draft was submitted on October 24 and Sherriff's fourth and final draft on November 10. All remained unacceptable, and Whale biographer James Curtis suggests that Whale, who had no interest in the project and feared that his commitment to it might cost him control over the filming of ''Show Boat'', encouraged Sherriff to submit ever more wildly unacceptable versions in hopes of getting himself off the film.&lt;ref name="curtis260" /&gt; On January 14, 1936, producer [[E. M. Asher]] advised Breen that the Sherriff script was not going to be used and that a new script would be put together from scratch. Screenwriting duties were assigned to Garrett Fort.&lt;ref&gt;Skal, pp. 198–99&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
[[File:GloriaHolden2DraculasDaughterTrailerScreenshot1936.jpg|thumb|right|Gloria Holden]]
[[File:OttoKrugerDraculasDaughterTrailerScreenshot1936.jpg|thumb|right]]

''Dracula's Daughter'' was Gloria Holden's first starring role and reportedly she was extremely displeased at having been assigned it. Like many actors, Holden looked down on horror films. She had also seen [[Bela Lugosi]] struggle over the years since ''Dracula'' was made to free himself from [[Typecasting (acting)|typecasting]] and feared that the role would lead to the same fate for her. Critic Mark Clark believes that ironically it may have been Holden's disgust for the role that led to the quality of her performance. "Her disdain for the part translates into a kind of self-loathing that perfectly suits her troubled character."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially Lugosi and [[Jane Wyatt]] were set to star in the film. Universal also announced that [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Colin Clive]], who had starred together in ''Frankenstein'' and ''Bride of Frankenstein'', would appear,&lt;ref name="rhodes219"&gt;Rhodes, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[Cesar Romero]] would play Dr. Garth.&lt;ref name="mank365"&gt;Mank, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Universal had sought [[Herbert Marshall]] for the role of Sandor, before casting Pichel.&lt;ref name="mank365" /&gt; None of them appeared except, after a fashion, Lugosi, in the form of a wax bust molded in his image for use in Dracula's coffin. Some sources report that Lugosi was paid as much as $4,000 for his abortive involvement, but the only confirmed record of any financial arrangement is a letter in which Lugosi consents to the use of his likeness at no cost to create the wax bust.&lt;ref name="rhodes219" /&gt;

===Shooting===
[[File:Dracula's Daughter - Poster 1936.jpg|thumb|right|Theatrical poster]]
Shooting on ''Dracula's Daughter'' began on February 4, 1936, rushed into production before Fort had completed the script,&lt;ref&gt;Mank, p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; because of a deadline clause in Universal's option of the property from Selznick.&lt;ref&gt;Skal, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; The script was not finalized until shooting had been underway for three weeks.&lt;ref name="mank357" /&gt; The film was completed on March 10, 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Mank, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; Despite studio orders that the film be shot on a seven-day-per-week schedule,&lt;ref name="mank357" /&gt; filming ran seven days over its schedule and $50,000 over budget, with the final cost of the film tallied at $278,380.&lt;ref&gt;Senn, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dracula's Daughter'' was the last in the first cycle of [[Universal Horror]] films that reached back into the 1920s. Publicly, Universal said it was because a British ban on horror films would cut too deeply into the revenue such films could generate.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In truth, the cycle was suspended because, just before filming on ''Dracula's Daughter'' had wrapped, the Laemmle family had lost control of Universal. Because of cost overruns on a number of pictures, Junior Laemmle was forced to borrow $1,000,000 on November 1, 1935. The money came from [[J. Cheever Cowdin]], head of the [[Standard Capital Corporation]], and from [[Charles R. Rogers]]. When the loan was called in March of the following year, Universal was unable to repay it. Standard assumed control of the studio on March 4, 1936 and Rogers replaced Junior as head of production. Rogers did not like horror films and he shut down production on them following the release of ''Dracula's Daughter'' to focus on fare like [[Deanna Durbin]] musicals.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Universal would not return to the horror genre for three years, when it released ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' in 1939.

===Other production aspects===
Makeup artist [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]] and special effects supervisor [[John P. Fulton]] worked together closely, especially on Holden's make-up design. They combined special lighting with a greyish-green make-up for Holden's final scenes, creating a pallor that contrasted with the more normally flesh-toned make-ups of the others in the scene.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', "Vampires, Monsters, Horrors!" March 1, 1936. Quoted in White, pp. 147–48&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinz Roemheld]] composed the score&lt;ref name="mank357"&gt;Mank, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Albert S. D'Agostino]] redressed [[Charles D. Hall]]'s set of Dracula's castle and created new sets including a London bridge, the moor where Dracula's body is burned and Countess Zaleska's apartment.&lt;ref&gt;Bansak, et al., p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and influence==
''[[The New York Times]]'' gave ''Dracula's Daughter'' a solid, albeit somewhat tongue-in-cheek, review upon its release, citing the film's "blood-curdling events" and noting that "Gloria Holden is a remarkably convincing bat-woman" in concluding that the film is both "quite terrifying" and "a cute little horror picture."&lt;ref name = nyt&gt;{{cite news

Later reviews of ''Dracula's Daughter'' are sharply split. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', reviewing the film following its video release, called it "one of the most satisfying vampire pictures ever made". Describing director Hillyer's visuals as "lush, evocative, and suffused with just the right gothic chiaroscuro" and noting that "Gloria Holden, as the reluctant vampire protagonist, absolutely drips patrician eroticism", ''EW'' concludes that this film is better than Lugosi's original ''Dracula''.&lt;ref name = ew&gt;{{cite news

Ryan Cracknell of Apollo Movie Guide, while echoing the praise for Holden's performance, nonetheless found that the film "doesn't hold up so well today". Citing what he sees as slow pacing and "long bouts of over-the-top dialogue", Cracknell compares the film to "reading a textbook – not the most exciting thing in the world, but it does provide insights into and perspectives on the foundation of early horror movies and how many similarities carry over into movies half a century and more later."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Horror author [[Anne Rice]] has named ''Dracula's Daughter'' as a direct inspiration for her own [[homoerotic]] vampire fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppenstand, et al., p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; She named a bar in her novel ''[[Queen of the Damned]]'' "Dracula's Daughter" in honor of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Lesbian implications==
[[File:NanGrayGloriaHoldenDraculasDaughterTrailerScreenshot1936.jpg|right|thumb|"Save the women of London from Dracula's Daughter!" Countess Zaleska seduces Lili.]]
[[File:NanGrayAfraidDraculasDaughterTrailerScreenshot1936.jpg|thumb|right|Nan Gray]]
The [[lesbian vampire]] has been a trend in literature dating back to [[Joseph Sheridan le Fanu]]'s 1872 novella "[[Carmilla]]". ''Dracula's Daughter'' marked the first time that the trend was incorporated into a film.&lt;ref&gt;Tudor, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The [[lesbian]] implications of ''Dracula's Daughter'' were obvious from the start and were of great concern to the Production Code Administration. PCA head Breen took special notice of the scene between the Countess and her model, Lili, writing, "This will need very careful handling to avoid any questionable flavor."&lt;ref name="worland126"&gt;Breen, quoted in Worland, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; The day before the scene was to be shot, Universal's [[Harry Zehner]] asked Breen to read a draft of the scene. In response, Breen wrote: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The present suggestion that ... Lili poses in the nude will be changed. She will be posing her neck and shoulders, and there will be no suggestion that she undresses, and there will be no exposure of her person. It was also stated that the present incomplete sequence will be followed by a scene in which Lili is taken to a hospital and there it will be definitely established that she has been attacked by a vampire. The whole sequence will be treated in such a way as to avoid any suggestion of perverse sexual desire on the part of Marya or of an attempted sexual attack by her upon Lili.&lt;ref name="worland126" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gay film historian [[Vito Russo]] noted in his book ''[[The Celluloid Closet]]'' that Universal highlighted Countess Zaleska's attraction to women in some of its original advertising for the film, using the tag line "Save the women of London from Dracula's Daughter!" He further cited Countess Zaleska as an example of the presentation of the "essence of homosexuality as a predatory weakness".&lt;ref&gt;Russo, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Some reviewers of the day picked up on and condemned the lesbian content, including the ''New York World-Telegram'' which noted the Countess's tendency to wander around "giving the eye to sweet young girls".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Russo, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Other reviews missed it entirely, including the aforementioned ''[[The New York Times]]'' which advised "Be sure to bring the kiddies."&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; ''Entertainment Weekly'' describes the encounter between the Countess and Lili as "so hot it's impossible to imagine how it ever got past '30s censors"&lt;ref name="ew" /&gt; whereas ''Time Out London'' finds only a "subtle suggestion" of lesbianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horror scholar Skal notes that the scene has come to be seen as a "classic 'lesbian' sequence, although of a decidedly negative stripe".&lt;ref&gt;Skal, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; The scene between Countess Zaleska and Lili was included in the 1995 [[documentary film]] adaptation of Russo's book.

Another lesbian-tinged scene which has received less critical attention comes when the Countess is holding Janet captive. Described as "the longest kiss never filmed", Countess Zaleska "hovers lovingly over Janet ... hovers ... and hovers ... slowly descending to kiss the recumbent Janet ..."&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 198–99&lt;/ref&gt; until interrupted by the arrival of Dr. Garth.

''[[Bright Lights Film Journal]]'', after noting that "Gloria Holden in the title role almost singlehandedly redefined the '20s movie vamp as an impressive Euro-butch dyke bloodsucker", draws an implicit comparison between Countess Zaleska's seeking to cure her vampirism through psychiatry and the former position of mainstream psychiatry of homosexuality as a mental illness (a view still held by a minority in the profession). Zaleska's cruising the streets of London is seen as parallel to [[cruising for sex]] (although that tends to be a gay male activity) and as suggesting "society's image of the lesbian as soulless predator" but the conclusion is that "Holden's striking, masklike face and haunting, luminous eyes [are] the intoxicating essence of transgressive lesbian power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''''Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix''''' is an [[action-adventure game]] developed by [[Kronos Digital Entertainment]] and published by [[Eidos Interactive]] for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. It is the prequel to ''[[Fear Effect]]''.

==Plot==
''Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix'' begins in [[Hong Kong]] in the year 2048. The player delves into the colorful histories of the original cast of three mercenaries - and newcomer Rain Qin - as well as the extraordinary circumstances that brought them together. In the wake of a degenerative global [[pandemic]] called EINDS (Environmentally Induced Nucleotides Degeneration Syndrome &amp;ndash; pronounced "ends"), theft, murder, and terrorism have become big business.

[[Hana Tsu-Vachel]] and Rain Qin are [[Mercenary|freelance operatives]], Royce Glas is a washed-up former soldier, and Jacob "Deke" Decourt is a cutthroat assassin. Much of the game's intrigue lies in how these unlikely allies even manage to come together for one cause. From the start, each of them have their own motives, but they soon all become entangled in a sinister plot extending far beyond politics, espionage, or personal survival. The adventure takes players through a futuristic Hong Kong, the formidable walled city of [[Xi'an]], the lost tomb of the [[Qin Shi Huang|first emperor]] of [[China]], and, finally, into the mountain island of the immortals, [[Penglai Shan]].

==Gameplay==
Like the original ''Fear Effect'', the sequel features [[cel-shaded]] [[3D modeling|character models]] on top of [[2.5D|pseudo-3D]] environments that use looping full-motion video to give the appearance of constantly animated background elements. Players take control of each of the four main characters (Hana, Rain, Deke and Glas) at different times throughout the game, which enables multilateral perspective on the storyline.

Retro Helix mostly relies on a third-person perspective. The controls are mapped without regard to the character's current position or direction faced. Unlike the original Fear Effect, however, Retro Helix offers players the option of a more traditional control scheme. At the player's disposal is a small arsenal of weapons, including a variety of firearms &amp;ndash; including [[Handgun|pistol]]s, [[shotgun]]s, and [[assault rifle]]s, specialty equipment such as a hand-held [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]]s and a [[taser]], and one unique [[melee weapon]] for each character.

''Fear Effect 2'' is primarily focused on solving puzzles to progress rather than combating enemies. In spite of the heavy [[Ammunition#Ordnance ammunition|ordnance]] available, enemies are few and far between, with static &amp;ndash; as opposed to dynamic &amp;ndash; placement. The gameplay is intended to evoke tension and suspense, rather than relying on the nonstop action formula of [[Shooter game|standard shooter]]s. This format has the consequence of making the gameplay arguably less difficult, although it is offset by the relative ease at which characters can die from enemy attacks and a number of instant-death scenarios. The fear gauge present in the original game returns for Retro Helix, a variation on the [[Health (game mechanic)|health meter]] common to most action games.

==Cancelled sequel==
An unreleased third game entitled ''Fear Effect Inferno'' was originally announced for the [[PlayStation 2]] as a sequel to the first game ''[[Fear Effect]]'' with [[Kronos Digital Entertainment]] developing it and [[Eidos Interactive]] publishing it at the time. The first trailer was released during [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] 2002. The trailer depicted some of the only known footage of the game.

While story details have been scarce, IGN editors promised that "the fusion [of] Asian myth and freaky modern themes" would be prominent like the previous two titles.&lt;ref name="IGN1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/360/360684p1.html |title=Fear Effect Inferno |author=IGN Staff |publisher=IGN Entertainment |date=2002-05-23 |accessdate=2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the few demonstration clips that Kronos released during the game's development, fans have pieced together a portion of the game's plot.

''Fear Effect Inferno'' is based on the best ending the player could achieve in the first game ''[[Fear Effect]]''. Therefore, the demons set forth by Jin have been killed, Glas' arm has been "reattached," and Deke's body and soul have been restored. According to the videos, ''Fear Effect Inferno''{{'}}s story chronicled Hana's capture by a group of demons disguised as human doctors and nurses.&lt;ref name="VideoGamesBlogger"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.videogamesblogger.com/2006/09/09/fear-effect-inferno-trailer-and-demonstration-videos.htm |title=Fear Effect Inferno |author=Video Game Blogger Staff |publisher=Video Game Blogger |date=2006-09-09 |accessdate=2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hana is placed in an asylum where tests are performed on her.&lt;ref name="IGN1"/&gt; During this time, she has several hallucinations, which range from Hana's completion of ancient tasks to her friends, including Hana herself, getting slaughtered by beasts. As she completed more challenges, Hana gained power from these ancient beings, allowing her to escape the grasp of the asylum's demons and experiments. Meanwhile, Deke is working from the inside, possibly as a "patient," killing any and all individuals that get in his way while searching for Hana. By the end of the journey, the four bounty hunters would once again face the fires of Hell, and fight the remaining demons&lt;ref name="VideoGamesBlogger"/&gt; Besides the demons themselves, their previously-human experiments, henchmen with sunglasses, and a woman that vaguely resembles Wee Ming, no "main enemy" was ever highlighted. However, ''Fear Effect Inferno'' promised more characterization during the course of the adventure.

Many drastic changes to the characters were expected to take place during the events of ''Fear Effect Inferno''. As the trailers and demonstration clips explained, Glas and Rain would begin a sexual relationship. At the same time, Hana and Glas would develop closer bonds, which would have created a love triangle for the three bounty hunters. The fates of the characters themselves are unknown; it was never revealed if any of the deaths witnessed by Hana or the player would be permanent.

Only a few screenshots exist that hint at the gameplay style of ''Inferno''. Based on these images, it was concluded that the gameplay would have been nearly identical to the previous two games. However, a new weapon system would have allowed players to map a firearm to the "X" (Cross) button and another to the "O" (Circle) button on the [[DualShock#DualShock 2|DualShock 2]] controller.&lt;ref name="VideoGamesBlogger"/&gt; This would have allowed numerous weapon combinations. In addition, updated diving moves could be executed to quickly evade enemy fire. The environment itself would have allowed players to hide from hazards, such as bullets, and function as a way to avoid detection. It was rumored that players could control certain actions during scripted in-game fight scenes, requiring the player to execute timed button combinations to fight certain opponents. ''Inferno'' would have introduced the separation of the "Health" and "Fear" Meters.&lt;ref name="VideoGamesBlogger"/&gt; However, it is not known how the "Fear" Meter would have affected gameplay since it functioned as both in the previous two titles.

Graphically, ''Inferno'' would have resembled the previous two titles with a "next-gen facelift." Using the PlayStation 2's graphical capabilities, pre-rendered scenes, which would have shown the characters talking and performing more animation-intensive actions, would have been rendered at a higher resolution. Like the previous two games, the background environments would have been short, pre-rendered animations, using a technique utilized by some portions of ''[[Final Fantasy X]]''. The polygonal characters would have been rendered using a cel-shaded method similar to the ones used in the previous two ''Fear Effect'' titles for the PlayStation. Other gimmicks, such as Hana frequently changing clothes, would have been prominent in the game, as well; in the existing clips alone, Hana dons no fewer than 4 different outfits.

The game's status changed rapidly towards the end of 2002 and was finally cancelled in 2003. However, between the announcement and the cancellation, information was scarce.

Reports varied as to the status of the game between 2002 and 2003. While an early report by [[GameSpot]] in May 2003 described the game as simply "on hold",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/feareffectinferno/news.html?sid=6028687&amp;mode=recent |title=GameSpot: Fear Effect Inferno on hold |author=Justin Calvert |publisher=GameSpot |date=2003-05-21 |accessdate=2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] broke the news during their "Missing in Action" series of articles that the game had been cancelled.&lt;ref name="IGN2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/490/490548p2.html |title=IGN: Fear Effect Inferno |author=IGN Staff |publisher=IGN Entertainment |date=2004-02-06 |accessdate=2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to IGN's report, the game "was the first of Eidos' victims to its more stringent quality assurance program."&lt;ref name="IGN2"/&gt; Due to the game's delayed progress, it was either given more development time or cancelled. Unfortunately, only the development staff knew of the game's status following this condemnation but according to the fans the content was big and still enough to publish. According to IGN, "at some point in late 2002 or early 2003, Kronos did indeed shop it to various publishers. Nobody, however, bit."&lt;ref name="IGN2"/&gt;

News of the cancellation did not come to fans until 2004, years after the game's initial announcement and quiet absence.&lt;ref name="IGN2"/&gt; Even Ex Sandy Abe, Ex Chief Operating Officer of Kronos current working for [[Walt Disney]], hinted that Eidos might give the series a second chance under a new developer, such as [[Crystal Dynamics]], but this was only true for the ''[[Tomb Raider]]'' franchise.&lt;ref name="StevePollack"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freewebs.com/feareffect/feareffect3.htm |title=Fear Effect Inferno |author=Steve Pollack |publisher=Steve Pollack |date=2003-08-03 |accessdate=2007-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031227104216/http://www.freewebs.com/feareffect/feareffect3.htm |archivedate=2003-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an e-mail by Sandy Abe ex Chief Operating Officer of Kronos, "Unfortunately Fear Effect probably will not get picked up."&lt;ref name="StevePollack"/&gt;

==Revival==
On February 17, 2015, [[Square Enix]] announced that it will allow developers to create games based on some of their old Eidos IPs via the Square Enix Collective project, including the ''Fear Effect'' IP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collective.square-enix.com/news/32/first-eidos-ips-made-available-via-square-enix-collective |title=First Eidos IPs made available via Square Enix Collective |publisher=Square Enix Collective |accessdate=February 17, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218002014/http://collective.square-enix.com/news/32/first-eidos-ips-made-available-via-square-enix-collective |archivedate=February 18, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 7, 2016, a new entry in the series titled ''[[Fear Effect Sedna]]'' was announced.

'''''Flower and Hawk''''' is a [[monodrama]] for [[soprano]] and [[orchestra]] with music and [[libretto]] composed by [[Carlisle Floyd]].

''Flower and Hawk'' was Floyd's seventh opera. It had its premiere on May 16, 1972, with [[Phyllis Curtin]] and the [[Jacksonville Symphony Orchestra]] under the baton of [[Willis Page]]. The production was directed by [[Frank Corsaro]].

==Synopsis==
''Flower and Hawk'' is based on the life of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], arguably the greatest woman of the Middle Ages. In her long life of eighty-two years she was born the [[Duchess of Aquitaine]] and [[Count of Poitiers|Countess of Poitou]], became [[List of French consorts|Queen of France]] through marriage to [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], and later became [[List of English consorts|Queen of England]] when she married [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]. The title is derived from her seal (on view in the Louvre) in which she stands holding a hawk in one hand and a flower in the other, suggesting a dualism in her character that is invoked in this work.

The monodrama takes place in Salisbury Tower, where Eleanor has been a prisoner for nearly sixteen years: Henry II had her confined there after she and her sons led an unsuccessful rebellion against him in France. Overcome by feelings of despair, abandonment and betrayal, she considers taking her life with poison but instead resolves to distract herself by recalling happier times. As she relives her positive memories of becoming the Queen of France, the memory of her son Richard's death resurfaces. She also recalls the many conflicts she endured with her two husbands, and again finds herself sinking into hopelessness. Time and again her feelings about Richard's death force her into the present until she finally allows herself release from the guilt and self-doubt surrounding this tragic event. Finally, she is able to re-assume her role as Queen when the tolling of the bells announces the death of Henry and her liberation from the Salisbury Tower.&lt;ref name=BH&gt;[http://www.boosey.com/pages/opera/moredetails.asp?musicid=33519 Carlisle Floyd – ''Flower and Hawk'' – Operas] at [[Boosey &amp; Hawkes]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FRIKAR dance company''' (established May 2006 by Hallgrim Hansegård) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] dance company for contemporary and traditional dance specializing in the connection between dance and nature.

==History==
'''FRIKAR dance company''' was founded by choreographer Hallgrim Hansegård in 2006, and has toured 29 countries all over the world. The company is described by National Geographic as "wildly inventive" and is composed by 32 artists from 4 continents (India, Iran, Somalia, Brazil, Cape Verde, France, Sweden, Norway.) The artists from very diverse genres meet each other in the research of gravity and human nature.

With a background in Norwegian traditional dance choreographer Hallgrim Hansegård founded FRIKAR dance company to give acrobatic dancers living in Norway a creative environment. Together with the dancers he has been developing a new choreographical style for contemporary dance called "Down2Earth" including [[Hallingdans]]  [[Capoeira]] and [[break dance]]. He works in the formats of aerial dance, site specific ecosophical stage arts, indoor dance and interdiciplinary arts.

Hansegård made his international breakthrough with an animation film at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 2003 (Tarantrance). In 2005 he won 3rd prize at Superdok. In 2007 he was awarded "Artist of the Year" at The Norwegian Folk Music Awards. In 2009 he won the "Award for best choreography" at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009]], among 43 countries in the most seen entertainment TV program in the world.

In 2010 he premiered "Jamsiis" at Bergen International Festival [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHSLBUOm9nc Youtube: Jamsiis]. This was a highly personal contribution to the Nordic contemporary dance scene, based on his roots in traditional dances. Jamsiis opened up a public discussion about the boundaries of contemporary dance in Norway. NRK (the Norwegian Broadcasting) writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;JAMSIIS, Hallgrim Hansegårds new production, is the most exciting I have seen here. It’s very exciting to see traditional dance in dialogue with contemporary dance. Hansegård is branching out and opening up new territory here. He has come down a path that I think is very important to go. That Hansegård is a dancer with strong will to do his own thing and blessedly uninhibited as far as exceeding boundaries is concerned is something the Norwegian dance community should be happy about… At the same time that he approaches contemporary dance, he opens doors. If he succeeds in making contemporary dance accessible to a wider audience than today’s, the genre of contemporary dance should learn to endure a ‘halling-roundkick’ or two.&lt;ref&gt;Dance critic Karen Frøsland Nystøyl, NRK kulturnytt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2009 Hansegård directed TidarÅ, an outdoor full night dance performance under a waterfall with 22 dancers and musicians from FRIKAR dance company. The production collected contemporary and traditional dancers in a research for a unique contemporary dance technique. "Tidarå" is part of FRIKARs ecosophical productions. Hansegård directed also Yr in 2009 together with violin virtous Ragnhild Hemsing, premiere at the [[Bergen International Festival]].

In 2008 FRIKAR was censored by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Naples]] for his non conventional interpretation of Peer Gynt, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsip8vvC7gY NRK: Bukkerittet]. In the years 2005 to 2007 Hansegård directed "Undergrunnsfargo", "Isolations", "Laus", "Kruk", "The snuff grinders" and "Bastard".

He also participated in ''[[Dansefeber]]'', the Norwegian version of ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (U.S. TV series)|So You Think You Can Dance]]'', in 2006.&lt;ref name=hvem&gt;{{cite book |title=Hvem er hvem? |last= |first= |authorlink= |year=2008 |editor=Knut Olav Åmås |publisher=Aschehoug |location=Oslo |isbn=978-82-03-23561-0 |language=Norwegian |page=211 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, his dancing was digitalized for the [[MMORPG|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG) [[Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/kul_und/spill/article2351271.ece|title=Et kast for Conan|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=6 April 2008|first=Per Kristian|last=Bjørkeng|language=Norwegian|accessdate=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dans, estetikk og samfunn"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dans, estetikk og samfunn? |last= |first= |authorlink= |year=2010 |editor=Heidi Haraldsen |publisher=Tell Forlag |location=Oslo |isbn=978-82-7522-351-5 |language=Norwegian |pages=10, 25, 26, 51, 52, 57, 58.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4078">[[Image:Flagellants.png|thumb|right|250px|Flagellants, from a fifteenth-century woodcut]]
In [[medieval music]], the '''Geisslerlieder''', or '''Flagellant songs''', were the [[song]]s of the wandering bands of [[flagellant]]s, who overspread [[medieval Europe|Europe]] during two periods of mass hysteria:  the first during the middle of the 13th century, and the second during the [[Black Death]] in 1349.  The music was simple, sung in the vernacular, often call-and-response, and closely related to [[folk song]]; indeed some of the flagellant songs survived into the 17th century as folk songs in [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] parts of central Europe.  Musically the ''Geisslerlied'' were related to the ''[[Laude|Laude spirituale]]'':  they were unaccompanied song, with instrumental accompaniment specifically forbidden.

== First outbreak, 13th century ==

The first period of ''Geisslerlied'' began in 1258 in response to the breakdown of civil order in northern [[Italy]].  Permanent warfare, famine, and an apparent demise of the moral order in contemporary life gave rise to a movement of public flagellation accompanied by singing; the penitents implored the help of God to ameliorate their sufferings, but never formed a specific sect, and neither did they attempt a social revolution.  Initially, the flagellents were members of the mercantile and noble classes, but as the movement spread outside of Italy, lower social classes took part.

Of the first period of activity, only a single song has survived, although many of the words they sang have been recorded.  Typically the texts were imploring, penitential, and apocalyptic.

== Second outbreak, 1349 ==

The Black Death was one of the most traumatic events in [[European history]], and the renewed desperation of the people, hopeful for divine intervention to end their sufferings, brought about a return of the flagellants and the ''Geisslerlieder''.  Unlike the situation with the first outbreak, much of the music was preserved.  A single priest, [[Hugo Spechtshart]] of [[Reutlingen]], who happened to be a capable musician, was impressed by the activity he witnessed, and transcribed exactly what he heard of the singing of the flagellants; indeed his work was one of the earliest examples of folk-song collection.  He produced a chronicle of what he heard in the ''Chronicon Hugonis sacerdotis de Rutelinga'' (1349), and the content corresponded closely to the description of the lost music from a hundred years before:  simple [[monophony|monophonic]] songs of verse and refrain, with a leader singing the verse and the group of flagellants singing the refrain in unison.  Particularly interesting about Hugo's transcriptions was his notation of ''variation'' between successive verses sung by the lead singer, a procedure common in folk song.

This second outbreak of flagellants, with their incessant and repetitive ''Geisslerlieder'' spread far wider than the first, reaching [[England]], [[Poland]], and [[Scandinavia]], and probably attracted a greater number of participants, although it did not last as long:  most of the records of the occurrence are from 1349.

The ''Geisslerlieder'' were suppressed, eventually, by the Church.  Parodies of the movement quickly arose, as well:  in [[Switzerland]] in 1350 a description survives of a group singing ''Geisslerlieder'' fitted with new words, as a bawdy drinking song; whether the drinkers flogged themselves is not known.  A parody of a ''Geisslerlied'' is also found in the 1975 film ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', where a group of monks chants the ''[[Pie Jesu]]'' while hitting themselves with boards.

== Plot ==
In the game's "Story Mode" the player assumes the role of Rassimus, a young [[Dacians|Dacian]] man that escaped during the [[peasant]] riots.
Rassimus was captured by Lucius, leader of the fifth Roman Legion, sent there to suppress the Dacian strike.
Rassimus later becomes under Lucius Gladius' control and begins training at the [[gladiator]] school of [[Rome]] to become the champion gladiator and acquire his freedom.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_8180000/newsid_8189400/8189409.stm|title=CBBC - Newsround - Game review: Horrible Histories Ruthless Romans|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portions of the narrative which set up and progress the story are narrated by Deary, with "accompanying stills presented in comic-book fashion".&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; The game is built up by 3D polygons "with flat features and textures in the style of the book illustrations" by [[Martin Brown (artist)|Martin Brown]].&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; The game taught players historical information in a "less academic and more engaging form".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.jeuxvideo.com/news/2009/00032614-horrible-histories-ruthless-romans-un-peu-d-histoire.htm|title=Google Translate|website=translate.google.com.au|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
The game contains a few different modes, all of which requiring the player to complete the same minigames; however, the Story Mode also has a narrative that threads the minigames together.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; The game is a piece of edutainment, deliberately designed for the player to learn as they play.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Play involves the player completing various minigames and activities. These include: searching through written content, talking to people, and completing quests, all of which provide clues or inventory that helps the player progress. In order to move up a level in difficulty, the player must first complete a quiz about the Romans. As a gladiator, the player must also fight in the [[Colosseum]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In total, the game contains over 30 minigames.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; CBBC recommended to use a nunchuck when playing the game on a Wii,&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; whereas a D-Pad was used by Nintendo Life's Sean Aaron for directional movement of the playable character.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; The multiplayer game can be played with up to three people.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

}}
The game received mixed reviews.

[[CBBC]]'s [[Newsround|''NewsRound'']] liked the minigames but disliked the boring quizzes, spartan books, and average graphics; however it added that the game would teach school-age players a lot about the history featured in their curriculum.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; NewsRound ultimately recommended the game for fans of the Horrible Histories franchise, while writing that for the average gamer it was a "hit by the skin of its teeth".&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; ''[[CinemaBlend]]'' thought the game synopsis made it sound like a "bloody good time", but noted that players should understand it's actually an educational adventure game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Horrible-Histories-Ruthless-Romans-Heading-Wii-DS-21256.html|title=Horrible Histories: Ruthless Romans Heading To Wii And DS - CINEMABLEND|date=2009-11-23|work=CINEMABLEND|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[GamesRadar|Games Radar]]'' reviewer Charlotte Martyn was sad the gladiator-based game forwent remote-waving combat for button pressing  and outline tracing mechanics instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/horrible-histories-ruthless-romans-review/|title=Horrible Histories: Ruthless Romans review|work=gamesradar|access-date=2017-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Hurst of ''[[Birmingham Mail]]'' thought the game's graphical design fit in well with the rest of the franchise, and thought it was an effective piece of edutainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2009-09-04|title=GAME REVIEWS.|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-207237589.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gloria Preston of ''BoomTown'' thought the game dumbed down its content too much, presenting what she described as condescending content that didn't give the young players enough credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ngc.boomtown.net/en_uk/articles/art.view.php?id=18390|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111163538/http://ngc.boomtown.net/en_uk/articles/art.view.php?id=18390|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-11-11|title=Boomtown - ngc - Wii/DS|website=web-beta.archive.org|access-date=2017-03-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sean Aaron of ''[[Nintendo Life]]'' thought the game, which he described as a "mini-game compilation" as disappointing and a waste of the license.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; However, he praised the "decent" Story Mode narrative, Deary's recounting-to-a-child narration, the intriguing and evolving story, and the exploration of Roman culture; ultimately wondering why Virtual Identity didn't decide to create an [[adventure game]] or [[visual novel]] instead.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; He felt the locations were "largely devoid of life" while describing the characters as "static...waxwork dummies", whose repetitive movements minded him of animatronics from Disneyland.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; ''GamePeople's'' Andy Robertson thought the title balanced education and gaming, and noted the challenges of the book-to-game adaptation in the sense that gruesome aspects of history had to be toned down because having children physical reenact them would have been to close to home.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamepeople.co.uk/family_wii_horriblehistoriesromans.htm|title=Horrible Histories Ruthless Romans Wii Review {{!}} Family Gamer|website=www.gamepeople.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson expressed excitement at the next entry in the series; a sequel that did not eventuate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The game became one of Slitherine's biggest titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/slitherine-merges-with-matrix-games/08546|title=Slitherine merges with Matrix Games|work=MCV UK|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer from Game Space thought the game could have been helped by greater historical accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://game-space.net/en/review/horrible_histories_ruthless_romans/review.html|title=Game review Horrible Histories: Ruthless Romans|website=game-space.net|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Jeuxvideo.com|Jeux Video]]'' expressed the problem of whether to review ''Ruthless Romans''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s effectiveness as a game in its own right or as a source of knowledge; ultimately doing both, the site concluded it was "a good pedagogical tool but...unfortunately not a good game".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jeuxvideo.com/articles/0001/00011125-horribles-histoires-les-redoutables-romains-test.htm|title=Test Horribles Histoires : Les Redoutables Romains sur DS|work=Jeuxvideo.com|access-date=2017-03-28|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site thought the game offered a series of "unattractive mini-games" and "crunchy anecdotes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jeuxvideo.com/gaming-live/0003/00031620/horribles-histoires-les-redoutables-romains-nintendo-ds---00002695.htm|title=Gaming Live Horribles Histoires : Les Redoutables Romains : - jeuxvideo.com|website=Jeuxvideo.com|language=fr|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{portal|Children's literature}}

'''James Arthur&lt;ref&gt;''Giant Size Fantastic Four'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; Madrox''', also called the '''Multiple Man''', is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writers [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Len Wein]] and artist [[John Buscema]],&lt;ref name="back65"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Jonathan Rikard |title=X-Factor vs. X-Factor: A Look at the Role of Identity in Peter David's X-Factor |journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=65|pages=73-78 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]| date=July 2013|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; he first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Giant-Size Fantastic Four]]'' #4 (February 1975).

A [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to create instant duplicates of himself, Madrox was mainly a minor or supporting character until his appearance in the 1987 [[miniseries]] ''[[Fallen Angels (comics)|Fallen Angels]]''. The character underwent greater development under writer [[Peter David]] through his appearance in David's run of the monthly series ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' (vol. 1) in the 1990s, and in David's second and ongoing run of the title (vol. 3) in the 2000s.

The character has appeared in multiple television, film and video game adaptations, most notably in the 2006 film ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', in which he was portrayed by [[Eric Dane]].

Jamie Madrox first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Giant-Size Fantastic Four]]'' #4. In the 1990s, he played a major role in the series ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]''. Writer [[Peter David]] later admitted that he was unhappy that he had to use Madrox in ''X-Factor'', and it was only over the course of writing the series that he became one of his favorite characters.&lt;ref name="back65"/&gt; A ''MadroX'' miniseries was published in 2004, also written by David. He and the other members of his detective agency later starred in a revamped ''X-Factor'' monthly series that is again written by Peter David.

==Fictional character biography==

===Youth===
Jamie Madrox is born to a family living near the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] research facility in [[New Mexico]]; the background [[radiation]] may have stimulated his mutation. When Jamie is born, the doctor's slap causes him to multiply into two identical babies. [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]], a friend of the Madrox family, suggests that they move to Kansas to raise the boy in privacy. Dr. Daniel Madrox, Jamie's father, creates a suit for him to wear which is designed to absorb kinetic energy, the source of the duplication.&lt;ref&gt;''Giant-Size Fantastic Four'' #4 (February 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, [[Damian Tryp]] of Singularity Investigations makes his own offer to look after Jamie, claiming that Jamie is not just a normal mutant, but actually a "[[changeling]]", a predecessor to mutants who develops its powers at birth.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' Vol 3 #11 (November 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Jamie's parents refuse to give Jamie to Tryp. When Jamie is fifteen years old, his parents are killed by a tornado alleged to have been caused by Tryp, and Jamie begins to run the farm by himself along with his duplicates, or "dupes", until his suit is damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbr.com/15-greatest-madrox-the-multiple-man-stories/|title=The 15 Greatest Madrox the Multiple Man Stories|date=2016-10-20|work=CBR|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Issue|date=December 2009}}

In his first appearance his date of birth was listed as September 7th, 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Giant Size Fantastic Four #4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muir Island===
Jamie Madrox goes to New York City for help where he meets [[Mister Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]. He contacts Professor Xavier,&lt;ref&gt;''Giant-Size Fantastic Four'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; who sends the youth to [[Muir Island]] with [[Moira McTaggert]], to work in her laboratory and help her with research.{{issue|date=September 2011}} He later helps Moira and fellow mutants [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] and [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] in searching for the escaped mutant [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]]. Proteus hijacks one of Madrox's duplicates as his own body, although this does not harm Madrox. Following the [[X-Men]]'s battle with Proteus on [[Muir Island]], Madrox is invited to join the X-Men, but he declines.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #125–126&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Jamie's renegade duplicates later searches with [[Siryn]] for the runaway [[New Mutants]] [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] and [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]]. They find Siryn and Jamie joins the [[Fallen Angels (comics)|Fallen Angels]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fallen Angels'' #2–8&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-Factor===
Jamie Madrox is then one of the residents of [[Muir Island]] who comes under the mental control of the [[Shadow King]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #278, 280.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the destruction of Muir Island and the defeat of the Shadow King, he becomes a member of the second incarnation of the [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team, which is assembled by [[Valerie Cooper|Val Cooper]] as a U.S. government response team.&lt;ref&gt;Peter David. ''X-Factor'' #71&lt;/ref&gt; Here, he develops a reputation as a prankster, forming a friendship with teammate [[Strong Guy]]. Also on the team is former New Mutant [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] who later joins his X-Factor Investigations.

In the first day of the team, one of his duplicates is shot and killed, and Madrox learns for the first time that he cannot absorb a deceased duplicate. This makes him realize for the first time how independent his duplicates actually are.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #71&lt;/ref&gt; This becomes clearer to him when a duplicate, working for [[Mister Sinister]], decides that it wants to absorb the original, which it does for a short time, until Jamie's dominant personality breaks free and reabsorbs the wayward dupe.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #72–75&lt;/ref&gt;

After he is exposed to the [[Legacy Virus]] while performing CPR on an infected [[Genosha]]n mutate,&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #91&lt;/ref&gt; Jamie is forced to kill the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolyte]] [[Seamus Mellencamp]] in self-defense by creating a dupe inside the mutant while his hand is in Mellencamp's mouth. The clone later died from the Legacy Virus.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #92&lt;/ref&gt; Madrox does not often fight in cosmic battles like most of the other X-Men, but he fought doppelgangers during [[the Infinity War]]&lt;ref&gt;''Infinity War'' #1-6&lt;/ref&gt; and, being religious, is taken by the cosmic entity [[Goddess (comics)|Goddess]] during the [[Infinity Crusade]].&lt;ref&gt;''Infinity Crusade'' Trade Paperback&lt;/ref&gt;

Jamie's health continues to deteriorate due to the Legacy Virus. An attempted cure by [[Haven (comics)|Haven]] leaves him dead,&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #100&lt;/ref&gt; until it is revealed that it was a duplicate who had been infected and died; the real Madrox was alive and suffering from amnesia.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #105, #111, or #128&lt;/ref&gt;

Jamie is the motivation for the Government-sponsored version of X-Factor to break ties with the government and go underground when the team is tricked into thinking Jamie and his duplicates are actually a squad of super-powered terrorists. Eventually, the team discovers this was a manipulation and the group goes rogue, splitting from the government.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #132&lt;/ref&gt;

He seeks out Strong Guy, ill after Jamie's alleged death. Unfortunately, this makes Strong Guy even weaker, but Jamie's mistake is fixed by the genius of new team leader [[Forge (comics)|Forge]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #135&lt;/ref&gt;

He then serves as majority staff for [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]]'s [[X-Corps]]. Banshee hires ex-criminals to police other mutants but things get bad when [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] goes on a murderous rampage and has Mastermind's daughter mind control them. The X-Men manage to defeat the renegade X-Corps members,&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #401–406&lt;/ref&gt; he transfers to one of Xavier's official "non X-Men" mutant teams in Paris's X-Corporation, fighting Weapon XII in the Channel which results in the death of teammate [[Darkstar (comics)|Darkstar]].&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #130&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mutant Town===
After the fall of the X-Corporation, Jamie Madrox begins working as a [[private detective]] in the "[[District X|Mutant Town]]" area of [[New York City|New York]], along with former X-Factor teammates Wolfsbane and Strong Guy. In the passing time, Madrox has been sending out his duplicates to lead lives of their own. Among these dupes are a [[Shaolin Temple|Shaolin]] monk and an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[Gymnast]]. By this point, his powers are developed to such an extent that any dupe who gains sufficient skills can pass its knowledge on to Jamie, giving him a wide variety of training instantly.&lt;ref&gt;A central plot point of early issues of ''X-Factor'', Vol. 3 (2006 series)&lt;/ref&gt;

The side effect of excessive withdrawal from absorbing the duplicates leads him to gain their new personalities as well, which gives him a form of [[multiple personality disorder]], in which any new dupes may spontaneously generate any individual personality aspect of Jamie Prime, making them unpredicatible, as they more often than not disobey his orders or manifest as personalities that are too volatile or meek.&lt;ref&gt;Again, a central plot point of early issues of ''X-Factor'', Vol. 3 (2006 series); particularly important for issues #1, #2 and #12.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is during this period that he encounters an assassin named Clay who has the same powers as Jamie. Although killed after telling Jamie that the Multiple Man has no idea what he truly is, Clay would come back later.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' Volume 0: Madrox Trade Paperback&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-Factor Investigations===
Following the elimination of all but a couple of hundred mutants from the face of the Earth in the "[[House of M]]" storyline,&lt;ref&gt;''House of M'' #8&lt;/ref&gt; it is revealed that Jamie Madrox has upgraded his private detective agency to a new building, under the name [[X-Factor Investigations]]. He bought the building using money from a ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]''-type show, using a room full of dupes as lifelines.&lt;ref&gt;Peter David. ''X-Factor Vol. 1: The Longest Night'' Trade Paperback; 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Still suffering from uncontrollable duplicate personalities, Jamie sends one to talk a de-powered [[Rictor]] out of jumping off a building who instead pushes him off.  The dupe calls himself "The X-Factor" and threatens Madrox that he will come out whenever dupes are made, and Madrox won't be able to tell before being reabsorbed, and Jamie's new team adds Rictor to the group, along with [[M (comics)|M]], and [[Siryn]]. Celebrating a victory after discovering he's not a mutant, but a changeling (see opening biography entry), Jamie has sex with Siryn, and an accidentally forgotten duplicate with M. When Jamie discovers and absorbs the duplicate, both females are furious with him.&lt;ref&gt;Peter David. ''X-Factor'' #10&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, [[Layla Miller]], without a home after House of M's reality is shattered, reveals to Jamie that one day they will get married, and Wolfsbane will kill them both on their wedding night.&lt;ref name=X-FactorTPB2&gt;Peter David. ''X-Factor Vol. 2: Life and Death Matters'' vol. 2 Trade Paperback; 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

During "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]", a duplicate Jamie had created a few years ago eventually becomes agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]; since he is an enforcer of the [[Superhuman Registration Act]], he registered [[M (comics)|M]] and [[Rictor]].{{issue|date=July 2016}} However, the true Jamie and X-Factor stand opposed to the legislation, going so far as to make a public statement regarding their position, leading Jamie to go in direct opposition to the neutral stance taken by X-Men leader [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] upset at for Jamie withholding the truth about M-Day.{{issue|date=July 2016}} Jamie also declares that the empty Mutant Town will be a sanctuary for superheroes being pursued by the government.{{issue|date=July 2016}}

Agent Madrox recently met "his" end when he was surprised and re-absorbed by the original Madrox during an investigation of a [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] cell. Jamie continues the task of hunting down his stray duplicates and reabsorbing them, but he leaves one, John Maddox, who has carved out a life for himself as an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] priest, husband and father, and Jamie decided not to reabsorb him.&lt;ref&gt;Peter David. ''X-Factor'' (vol. 3) #16 (April 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Siryn also discovers that she is pregnant by Jamie.&lt;ref&gt;Peter David. ''X-Factor'' 28&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Messiah Complex"====
During the 2007 - 2008 "[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]]" storyline, Cyclops sends Jamie Madrox and Layla Miller to go see [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] having built a machine that allows to monitor alternate timelines. Madrox sends two dupes to find information on two timelines that showed "spikes", after the birth of the Mutant baby, due to two different timelines: one in which the newborn becomes the planet's savior and another where it becomes its dominator. Before anyone can react, Layla jumps into the portal along with one of the dupes, and Madrox collapses into a coma.

Layla and one Madrox duplicate arrive eighty years in the negative future to discover that the mutant race has been [[Days of Future Past|severely decimated]]. Mutants are imprisoned in [[concentration camps]] overseen by humans. Layla and the dupe are captured and tattooed with an "M" for mutant over their eyes. There, they encounter a youthful [[Bishop (comics)|Lucas Bishop]] that would gladly go back in time to kill the mutant baby responsible for the way this timeline has turned out. Layla straps a stolen grenade to the duplicate, killing him and sending his memories of the event back to Jamie so he can tell of Bishop's treachery. When Jamie awakens, he develops an M tattoo because his body takes on scarring from duplicates. Jamie leaves and returns to X-Factor Investigations, disillusioned due to Layla's loss.&lt;ref&gt;Peter David. ''X-Factor'' #25- 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The other duplicate later returns as the character Cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Peter David. ''X-Factor'' #45. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sean====
Siryn goes into labor and proposes to Jamie Madrox, who accepts. Siryn gives birth to a boy, named Sean after her own father. Just hours after his birth, however, Sean, much to the horror of Jamie, Theresa and X-Factor, is absorbed into Jamie's body as Jamie holds the boy, completely against Jamie's will. Jamie realizes that the baby must have been fathered by a dupe rather than by him, and that "the offspring of a dupe isn't really anything more than a dupe". Siryn, filled with rage toward Jamie, breaks his finger and tells him to leave.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' (vol. 3) #39 (March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Jamie goes to see his preacher dupe John Maddox. Jamie realizes that if the child of a dupe is merely an "infant dupe", then John's son should have been absorbed either by John himself, or when Jamie ruffled the boys hair; therefore John's son must not be his. John admits that he already knows his wife had an affair. Jamie reveals that he plans to kill himself over the grief caused by Sean, but is prevented by a holographic projection of an adult Layla Miller who takes him into the future.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' (vol. 3) #40–41 (April–May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Summers Rebellion====
Jamie Madrox is transported to the future in the midst of the Summers Rebellion, where mutants rise up against Sentinel and human oppressors, which is led by [[Ruby Summers]], the daughter of Cyclops and [[Emma Frost]], with Cyclops's optic blasts and Emma's organic mineral body, Layla Miller, and a cyborg Cyclops whose predicament is Jamie's fault.{{issue|date=November 2010}}

After kissing Layla (now an adult) out of happiness at seeing her, Cyclops wants Jamie to find out why some mutants are winking out of existence. The group visit an aging senile Doctor Doom who says Layla told him in the past that he'd have to instruct Jamie and her on something in the future, and it is now.{{issue|date=November 2010}}

In the present, a former mutant named Lenore ask assistance to X-Factor, claiming that someone was trying to kill her. She felt she was being followed, but every time she looked, it was a different person doing it. Her best friend Candy, another former mutant, was found dead of a gunshot wound which the police ruled a suicide. Lenore didn't believe it, because Candy had a pathological fear of guns. Before Candy died, she told Lenore that she thought she was being followed. Later, Lenore's mother showed up at Lenore's apartment and attempted to shoot her, but was foiled by Longshot. Escaping, Lenore's mother took Darwin hostage. At the last minute, she turned the gun on herself, but it backfired due to Longshot's luck powers. At the hospital, Monet St. Croix attempted to read Lenore's mother's mind, but was overpowered and collapsed. When she woke up, she grabbed Longshot's throat and said "Cortex".{{issue|date=November 2010}}

While Strong Guy and Rictor were visiting John Maddox in Vermont, Shatterstar busted through the window and tried to stab Rictor, saying only "Cortex". Once freed of Cortex' control, Shatterstar and Rictor shared a passionate kiss. When Cortex tried to bring Longshot under his mental and physical control, he noted that Longshot and Shatterstar were in many ways identical.{{issue|date=November 2010}}

Once she calmed down, Monet told the group that her violent outburst was because of psychic feedback that occurred after she had broken through a psychic barrier in Lenore's mother's mind, but that whatever was controlling her had fled. She then manipulated the group into moving Lenore out of her apartment and hiding her in a penthouse suite in an expensive hotel. There she tried to seduce Darwin, but he figured out that she was acting out of character only to try to get Lenore alone, and so resisted. Monet's body turned bright purple and became covered in tint lights and circuitry. She said that she would then have to kill Darwin, even though he wasn't on Cortex's list. This suggests that whatever Monet had become, she was acting somewhat independently of Cortex himself while receiving instructions from him.{{issue|date=November 2010}}

When Cortex loses control over Monet, he is attacked and his hood falls back revealing that he is a duplicate of Madrox. Having his identity uncovered Cortex reveals himself as the second duplicate sent to one of the two "remaining" futures for mutantkind during the "Messiah Complex", to search for a cure for the depowering of 98% of the world's mutants following M-Day, then die in some fashion so that his memories would be transferred back to Madrox.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' (vol. 3) #47 (August 2009) letters column. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

How this duplicate travelled from the alternative future he was sent to Earth-1191 remains a mystery. The only thing known is that under the direction of Anthony Falcone, who in turn was under the guidance of Damian Tryp from Earth-616, this duplicate was turned into a "doomlock", a chronal variance inhibitor which stops the creation of divergent timelines, which required massive cybernetic modification of his body. He was then sent back in time from Earth-1191 to Earth-616 to kill a list of specific individuals, including Multiple Man, for fear how they might affect the future. As Cortex, Madrox's duplicate apparently has the power to mentally control several people at once.{{issue|date=November 2010}}

Meanwhile, on Earth-1191, the Multiple Man was tasked by Cyclops with discovering why certain people seemed to be blinking out and then back into existence. Multiple Man theorized that someone might be altering the past to affect the future. Cortex was attempting to kill Lenore to prevent Hecat'e (of the Summers Rebellion) from being born.{{issue|date=November 2010}}

In the 2018 miniseries ''Multiple Man'', one of Madrox's dupes is found barely alive, and brought to the X-Men. This dupe Jamie reveals that he had operated independently of Jamie Prime long enough that he was not affected by the Terrigen Mist. However, after tests reveal that he was indeed affected by the Mist, and suffers organ failure, he steals a time machine in the hopes of finding a cure for his predicament, resulting in damage to the timeline.&lt;ref&gt;''Multiple Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Jamie Madrox has the power to create perfect copies of himself, which he calls "dupes", and all items on his person (clothing, weaponry, etc.) through impact when he absorbs [[kinetic energy]] (although this sometimes has happened at will) through an unknown process. Most of the time, this is caused by him snapping his fingers, stomping his foot, being struck, or collisions. Each of the duplicates has exactly the same power as Jamie himself, and has independent thought, though Madrox "Prime" is usually telepathically and empathically linked to the dupes. His powers have, at least once, been shown to affect the actual design of the shirt he was wearing.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

Jamie "Prime" can absorb a dupe back into himself at will, which also makes him absorb the memories, knowledge, and skills of the duplicate. The dupe usually appears right beside the body it "springs" from. It has been noted that dupes have trouble creating more dupes themselves if they have not used their powers for a while,{{issue|date=March 2011}} while Madrox is able to use his ability whenever he wants without any such issue.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

Jamie was formerly unable to control the duplication process, wearing a special shock-absorbent synthetic stretch fabric costume that contained mechanisms that absorbed kinetic energy so that an army of Madroxes would not instantly appear every time he was struck. The original suit was designed by his father, Dr. Daniel Madrox, and later modified by Reed Richards. Jamie currently wears a stylized shirt with only six large green shock-absorbent pads on the front of the torso. Whether this indicates a greater degree of control over when his dupes manifest, an advance in technology or if it is simply an ordinary shirt with the same design is unclear.

During his time with X-Factor, the maximum number of dupes Madrox could create, including duplicates of the dupes themselves, was approximately 50,&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter David|David, Peter]]. ''X-Factor'' #6 (April 2006), [[Marvel Comics]].&lt;/ref&gt; but the limit has grown far beyond that, as when Hydra tried to manipulate Jamie into becoming one of them. Their plan backfired because he cannot be mind-controlled, which instead resulted in an immense number of Madroxes that drowned the organization's cohorts.{{issue|date=December 2011}} Duplicates have independent minds from the original, but are usually willing to merge back because their memories and knowledge are retained. However, there have been exceptions where duplicates have wished for independence completely, even going so far as to have malicious duplicates intending great harm to the Prime during Peter David's original and modern ''X-Factor'' runs (which featured Madrox's dupes manifesting as aspects of the Prime Madrox's personality rather than straightforward duplicates).{{fact|date=June 2018}}

As a last-ditch effort, Madrox's abilities can be used to deadly effect, which were used in self-defense against [[Seamus Mellencamp]],&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #92 (July 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; when Madrox jammed his hand into Mellencamp's mouth and activated his power, creating a duplicate inside Mellencamp and exploding him from the inside out. He has used this method to threaten people before, as well.

Madrox's duplicates can perish without long term physical harm to himself, as demonstrated when the mutant Proteus possessed a duplicate then consumed its life force — leaving only a burnt out husk, as with all victims of Proteus.{{issue|date=February 2014}} The possession caused Madrox to collapse in pain, aware of what was happening, but he later recovered.{{issue|date=February 2014}} Another Madrox dupe died of the [[Legacy Virus]], but Madrox himself was unaffected, although he would presumably have received the virus if he absorbed the infected dupe.{{issue|date=February 2014}}

Madrox also uses merging with his duplicates as a form of healing. Originally, uninjured dupes "shared" the damage when they merged. If an injured Madrox or dupe merged with an uninjured version, the "new" version had an injury half as severe as the original injury. This method may depend upon the severity of the injury, such as when the M-tattooed dupe sent his scarring to the original.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

As a consequence of splitting into multiple selves, Jamie has accumulated a vast wealth of knowledge and experience, along with some confusion over which Jamie did what. For example, although he says his duplicates have had active sex lives, he is not sure whether he himself ever has, to the point that he was once uncertain whether he or a dupe had conceived his son Sean with Siryn (with the result that his body absorbed his infant son the first time he held the boy, as his body regarded the baby as another dupe rather than an independent entity).{{issue|date=March 2011}}

Specific special skills accumulated through his vast experience include picking locks, some proficiency in [[Shaolin Kung Fu]], handgun training, multiple languages including Russian and Hawaiian, and playing-card throwing. One of his dupes was a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent, giving him all the prerequisite espionage training.{{issue|date=June 2013}} Along the way, he or his duplicates participated in an Olympic gymnastics team and apparently became a licensed attorney.

Madrox has generally been considered a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]. Unlike most mutants, whose mutant powers emerge during adolescence, Madrox exhibited his gifts from the day he was born.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter David|David, Peter]]. ''X-Factor'' #11 (November 2006), [[Marvel Comics]]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''X-Factor,'' [[Damian Tryp]] declares Madrox is not a mutant, but a "killcrop" like him, so named because they were believed to cause bad harvests in olden times.&lt;ref&gt;David, Peter. ''X-Factor'' #11 (November 2006), Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
===''Age of Apocalypse''===
In the 1995–96 ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' [[fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline, Jamie Madrox is one of the many mutants captured by [[Mister Sinister|Sinister]] and the [[Dark Beast]] for experimentation. His powers are overextended beyond their limits, leaving him nearly mindless, and his duplicates become '''the Madri''' — a fanatical cult worshipping [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and serving as his inquisitors and secret police. The original Madrox is reduced to a [[diaper]]ed, drooling lunatic who plays with children's toys such as rattles and building blocks while being kept in seclusion at the Church of the Madri in Quebec. Eventually, [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] attempt a rescue; however, in the end, Madrox shuts down all of his duplicates and dies in the resulting psychic backlash. The destruction of the Madri was one of the major blows to Apocalypse's regime that helped the X-Men overthrow the mutant overlord.

===''Earth X''===
Jamie Madrox is referenced in the appendix of issue #6 of the 1997 [[miniseries]] ''[[Earth X]]'': "Multiple Man. Jaime Madrox lives in every city of the earth. He's sort of a street informer who peddles himself on his ability to convey anything going on to anyone – should they pay high enough". Madrox would later appear in the sequel series ''Universe X'' in the ''Beasts'' special, in which Jamie's hunger for meat during a food shortage causes him to eat one of his own duplicates. This action brings the curse of [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]] upon Jamie. Interacting with his own mutation, the curse created a pack of Wendigo. This pack follows the combined forces of [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]] and the X-Men to the Savage Land. In a last stand against the Wendigo, the combined forces of Black Panther, the X-Men, the Ani-Men and the Hulk defeat the Wendigo in a circle of fire. Jaime then reverts to normal and confesses his cannibalism before dying. It is not specified if the Jamie in this book is the original Jamie or a duplicate.

===''Marvel Zombies''===
The Multiple Man is one of the zombies that [[Ash Williams#Ashley G. Williams|Ashley G. Williams]] encounters in issue #3 of the 2007 miniseries ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]''. Duplicated already, all the copies try to devour Ash who seemingly destroys them all. It is not shown how exactly Jamie Madrox turned into a zombie.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Jamie Madrox is from [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate X-Men'' #100&lt;/ref&gt;, and is a member of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants|Brotherhood of Mutants]]. He once staged an entire mutant rights protest march. A sample of his stem cells were stolen by the French military to create the [[Schizoid Man (comics)|Schizoid Man]] a "mutate" (a Marvel term for genetically modified humans as opposed to those who developed mutant powers naturally) with similar powers. Madrox appeared alongside [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]], [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], and [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] when they gate-crashed the Academy of Tomorrow's Homecoming dance, though this was later shown to be an illusion. In the "Return of The King" arc, Madrox states that he can only produce approximately 27 or 28 dupes before he gets a bad sense of déjà vu. Madrox has appeared in ''[[Ultimates]]'' Vol 3 #2, alongside the Brotherhood.

During the "[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]" storyline, Multiple Man creates tens of thousands of dupes used as "soldiers" in Magneto's plot to destroy the world, succeeding in blowing up [[Parliament]] and the Academy of Tomorrow, and killing various characters (including Emma Frost, [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]], [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], [[Captain Britain]] and [[Hank Pym]]).{{issue|date=August 2012}} [[Ultimate Wolverine|Wolverine]] travels to the [[Savage Land]], discovering that the real Multiple Man is actually a thirteen-year-old boy that had fallen under [[Lorelei (Mutate)|Lorelei]]'s hypnotic powers. Jamie believes Lorelei to be his mother and that the year he lives in is 1994, and the actions being carried out by his dupes are stories he is drawing. Wolverine tries to call the boy to reason by revealing Lorelei's true intentions, but is later forced to apparently kill him, causing all of the dupes to disappear.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ultimatum (comics)|Ultimatum]]'' #3 and ''Ultimate X-Men'' #100&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time later, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] starts using Multiple Man's duplicates to produce helmets similar to that of his father.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #7&lt;/ref&gt;

'''King Brothers Productions''' was a film production company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=The Amazing Transparent Man (1960) Two Horror Films|first=Howard|last=Thompson|date=March 30, 1961|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A05E1DD1539EE32A25753C3A9659C946091D6CF}}&lt;/ref&gt; active from 1941 to the late 1960s. It was founded by the Kozinsky brothers, Frank (1 April 1913 - 12 February 1989), Maurice (Maury) (13 September 1914 - 2 September 1977), and Herman (4 July 1916 - 20 July 1992), who later changed their surname to "King".&lt;ref name="king"&gt;HITTING THE JACKPOT: The Kozinsky Brothers Muscled Into the Movies to Get Even With De Mille By THOMAS BRADY. New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 12 Oct 1941: X4.&lt;/ref&gt; They had notable collaborations with such filmmakers as [[Philip Yordan]] and [[William Castle]] and are particularly remembered today for employing a number of blacklisted writers during the [[Red Scare]] of the late 1940s and 1950s. Some of their films include  ''[[Dillinger (1945 film)|Dillinger]]'' (1945), ''[[Suspense (1946 film)|Suspense]]'' (1946), ''[[Gun Crazy]]'' (1949), ''[[Carnival Story]]'' (1954), ''[[The Brave One (1956 film)|The Brave One]]'' (1956—which earned writer [[Dalton Trumbo]] a Best Screenplay [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]), ''[[Gorgo (film)|Gorgo]]'' (1961), ''[[Captain Sindbad]]'' (1963), and ''[[Heaven With a Gun]]'' (1968).

==Career==
Joseph Kozinsky (d 1950)&lt;ref&gt;Obituary 2 -- No Title Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 28 Jan 1950: 10.&lt;/ref&gt; was a New York fruit merchant who fathered five children, the brothers Frank, Maurice and Herman, and two sisters. The family moved to Los Angeles in the 1920s.

The brothers did various odd jobs including selling newspapers and shining shoes before getting into [[slot machines]]. They borrowed $250 and built an empire up to 19,000 machines.&lt;ref&gt;The Home Front Treanor, Tom. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 12 Nov 1941: 1A.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;He's Been Around For a Long Time
By Richard L. Coe. The Washington Post and Times Herald (1954-1959) [Washington, D.C] 24 Apr 1954: 21.&lt;/ref&gt; They also branched into race horses.

In 1940 they, along with their sister Nettie Segal, were charged with tax evasion.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Will Delve Into CAMOA: Grand Jury Summons Lawyer and Kent Parrot in Income Tax Inquiry U.S. Will Delve Into CAMOA Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 08 May 1940: A1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tax Evasion Laid to Three: Two Brothers and Sister Indicted After Inquiry Into CAMOA Member Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 09 May 1940: A1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entering the Film Industry===
The same year, Morris Kozinsky looked at getting into [[slot machine movies]]. They formed Hollywood Quality Pictures Incorporated to develop slot machine projectors and met with [[Cecil B. De Mille]] to source films. Morris later recalled:

&lt;blockquote&gt;De Mille, he has an inferior complex. It takes two weeks to get into see him. Well, we didn't like that. We're just plain businessmen. We finally told him we had to get some pictures. He said he was going to get [[Sally Rand]] to make some. Then he said he had a deal with some trapeze artists. Well, you know yourself, you're out with a gal relaxing in a bar, you don't want to see no bubble dancer or acrobat. You want to hear some good music. You want something with class. You want to see [[Bing Crosby]] maybe. That was the trouble. De Mille might make big epics but for us he didn't have no class.&lt;ref name="king"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Kozinskys decided to abandon slot machine projecting for actual film production. Morris said he told his brother Frank:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What is this racket, anyway? If De Mille can do it, why can't we? We're clever guys, we couldn't lose more than ten or twenty thousand dollars. Maybe we should make a movie. Then maybe we can forget how he made us look like mugs.&lt;ref name="king"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The brothers knew Hollywood personalities like [[Louis B. Mayer]] and [[Frank Capra]] from the racetrack and asked them for advice. "So we had to go ahead," said Morris. "Or else we would have looked cheap to Mayer and Capra because we'd told them about it."&lt;ref name="king"/&gt;

They formed KB Productions and made the film ''[[Paper Bullets]]'', releasing through [[Producers Releasing Corporation]] in exchange for $19,500 and 50% of the profits. The movie was shot at Talisman Studios over six days. It was a success and the brothers were launched as film producers.&lt;ref name="king"/&gt;

In 1942 the Kozinskys changed their name to "King".&lt;ref&gt;RAISED EYEBROWS DEPARTMENT New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 11 Jan 1942: X4.&lt;/ref&gt;

They had an enormous success with ''Dillinger'' (1945). Morris told the press at the time:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nobody discovered us - we discovered ourselves. We didn't come in to this business as paupers and we won't go out of it as paupers ... It's like this- we're honest and our door is open to everybody. We've got no overhead - our overhead begins when we start shooting and ends the day we put the film in the can. That's the way we do business and we're not going to stop until we get an Academy Award and land one of our pictures in the Radio City Music Hall.&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Dillinger'' was written by [[Philip Yordan]], who would work for the brothers on numerous occasions. He later described them:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Frank was like a 300-pound Chinaman. Always a big cigar in his mouth and a drawer full of [[Hershey bars]]. Always wondering why he was so fat because, he says, "I don't eat." Maurice had been a prize fighter and would always have black coffee, but he was heavy too. When I first met them ... they weren't gangsters but they had [investments in] slot machines and they were probably running something [illegal] in town. Nobody questioned it. They had a few bucks, not rich, but they had a few bucks ... They were very honest. And they always paid me.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft0z09n7m0&amp;chunk.id=d0e17295&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d0e17295&amp;brand=ucpress McGilligan, Patrick.

The Kings had a production assistant, [[Arthur Gardner (producer)|Arthur Gardner]], who later recalled "Frank was the smartest brother and the leader. Maurie watched the money and Hymie just kind of tagged along ... Frank had a good story mind and supervised everything ... I believe Frank King would have succeeded in any business. He was a sharp as a tack."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.filmnoirfoundation.org/PhilipYordan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945 they announced plans to make their most expensive film yet, the musical ''Golden Girl'' starring [[Belita]].&lt;ref&gt;Belita, Ice Star, Veers to Film Dramatic Roles: Skating Ballerina in New Picture Makes Impressive Shift to Serious Portrayals
Schallert, Edwin. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 11 Nov 1945: B1.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead they put her in a drama, ''Suspense''.&lt;ref&gt;BELITA, JILL OF ALL TRADES: Experiment Garlogs Girl Competition? By THOMAS M. PRYOR. New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 10 Mar 1946: X3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Company===
In September 1950 the King Brothers changed how they financed their films. They publicly floated their company, getting permission to use a million $1-par shares. They issued $300,000 worth of shares and used it to finance ''[[Drums in the Deep South]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Holt Leatherneck; Directors Pick Huston; King Bros. Celebrating
Scheuer, Philip K. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 05 Sep 1950: A11.&lt;/ref&gt; $300,000 was later raised for ''The Syndicate''. The King Brothers paid $70,000 for 70,000 of their own shares. There were over 700 shareholders and the King Brothers took 50% of the profits.&lt;ref name="finance"&gt;HOLLYWOOD AGENDA: Capra and Stevens Will Leave Paramount In Production Policy Change--Addenda Poor Starts Turning Point Stock Dealings More Color By THOMAS F.

The King Brothers later sued RKO for mismanaging the distribution and sale of three of their films, ''[[The Brave One (1956 film)|The Brave One]]'', ''[[Carnival Story]]'' and ''[[Drums in the Deep South]]'', claiming $6,030,000 in damages.&lt;ref&gt;FILM GROUP FILES SUIT OF $6,030,000: King Brothers Alleges Trust Violations in 3 Releases -- Doris Day in Musical

The '''Liberty Bell''' was the first variation of the modern mechanical [[slot machine]] we see today, originally being referred to as a ''"fruit machine"'' or ''"one-armed bandit"''. Created in 1895 by [[Charles Fey]] (1862–1944), a car mechanic from [[San Francisco]], the Liberty Bell's popularity set the standard for the modern slot machine; its three-reel model is still used today despite great advances in slot technology over the past several decades. The original Liberty Bell slot machine is currently on display at the '''Liberty Belle''' saloon in [[Reno]], [[Nevada]] as a historic artifact.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://inventors.about.com/od/sstartinventions/a/Slot_Machines.htm Inventors.about.com], The History of Slot Machines-Liberty Bell.&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it worked==
Each of Liberty Bell's three reels were imprinted with a symbol of a ''diamond, heart, spade, horseshoe, star'' and a cracked ''Liberty Bell''. Once the player deposited a nickel, he could pull the lever on the side of the machine and the reels would begin to spin, stopping on any random combination of symbols. If the same symbol appeared on all three reels a bell would ring and the player would be awarded with coins. Three Liberty Bells offered the largest payout of fifty cents (10 nickels), which was ejected by the machine.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

===Payouts===
The payouts for the Liberty Bell were as follows:

*2 ''horseshoes'' = 5 cents
*2 ''horseshoe'' + 1 ''star'' = 10 cents
*3 ''spades'' = 20 cents
*3 ''diamonds'' = 30 cents
*3 ''hearts'' = 40 cents
*3 ''Liberty Bells'' = 50 cents

==Popularity==

In 1907, with the growing popularity and demand for the Liberty Bell, the [[Mills Novelty Company]] began manufacturing the '''"Mills Liberty Bell"'''.&lt;ref name="slothistory2"/&gt;

In 1910 the company introduced a slight variation of the Liberty Bell, called the '''Operator Bell'''. Changes such as a gooseneck coin acceptor and fruit symbols to replace the traditional images became a standard for slot machines for decades to come, and over 30,000 of these machines were produced. In 1915 the company then began manufacturing a less expensive version of the Operator Bell, replacing the heavy cast iron machines with ones made out of lighter wooden cabinets.&lt;ref name="slothistory2"&gt;[http://slotmachinespayouts.com/liberty-bell-slot-machine.htm Slot Machines Payout], Slot Machine History.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s the Mills Novelty company made additional changes to their line of slot machines. First, they designed it so that their machines were much more quieter, which eventually gave the machines the name ''"silent bells"''. Secondly, they created a line of themed wooden cabinets each with its own unique design, the first being '''Lion Head''' released in 1931.&lt;ref name="slothistory"&gt;[http://www.slottipsguide.com/slot-history.html Slot Tips Guide], The History of Slot Machines.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was this time in the 1930s that slot machines saw a rise of popularity in America. In the late 1940s [[Bugsy Siegel]] added slot machines to his [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], initially as a way to entertain the wives and girlfriends of high rollers. Soon the revenue generated from these machines matched those of the table games.&lt;ref name="slothistory"/&gt;

'''Library and Archives Canada''' ('''LAC''') (in {{lang-fr|Bibliothèque et Archives Canada}}) is a [[Government of Canada|federal]] institution tasked with acquiring, preserving and making [[Canada]]'s documentary heritage accessible.&lt;ref name=JLW/&gt; It is the fourth biggest library in the world. LAC reports to [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] through [[Pablo Rodriguez (Canadian Politician)]], the [[Minister of Canadian Heritage]] since August 28, 2018.

==History and mandate==
The Dominion Archives was founded in 1872 as a division within the [[Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada|Department of Agriculture]] and was transformed into the autonomous Public Archives of Canada in 1912 and renamed the National Archives of Canada in 1987. The National Library of Canada was founded in 1953. [[Freda Farrell Waldon]] contributed to the writing of the brief which led to the founding of the National Library of Canada.&lt;ref name="brief"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpl.ca/articles/history-lha-freda-farrell-waldon |title=History of LH&amp;A: Freda Farrell Waldon &amp;#124; HPL |publisher=Hpl.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Library and Archives Canada (LAC) combined the functions of the National Archives of Canada and the National Library of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Ian E.|title='A Noble Dream': The Origins of the Public Archives of Canada|journal=[[Archivaria]]|publisher=ACA|year=1982|issue=15|pages=16–35|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/archivar/index.php/archivaria/article/view/10966/11899|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech – Posthumous Tribute to Jean-Pierre Wallot|url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/news/speeches/Pages/Speech-Posthumous-Tribute-to-Jean-Pierre-Wallot.aspx|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=May 30, 2013|quote=Following his appointment in the spring of 1985, he was given the task of reviewing the Public Archives Act of 1912, which led to the federal institution’s first name change.

In 1912, parliamentary legislation transformed this division into an autonomous organization, the Public Archives of Canada, and confirmed its responsibility to manage government documents. The mandate of the new institution focused on the acquisition of documents on all types of media, putting into practice the innovative concept of 'total archives.' Further legislation in 1987 clarified and reinforced the role and responsibilities of the Public Archives of Canada, which was then renamed the National Archives of Canada. In October 2002, in order to improve access to Canada’s documentary heritage, the government announced the creation of a new institution, Library and Archives Canada, which united the National Archives of Canada and the National Library of Canada (founded in 1953).|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225722/http://bd.archivescanadafrance.org/acf/repo-bac.html?l=en|archivedate=March 3, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established by the ''Library and Archives of Canada Act'' (Bill C-8), proclaimed on April 22, 2004.

*A new kind of knowledge institution
*A truly national institution
*Working with others to strengthen the whole of Canada’s documentary heritage
*A prime learning destination
*A lead institution in government information management.
LAC's modernization policy provides for transformation from an institution focused on the acquisition and preservation of analogue (non-digital) materials to one that excels in digital access and [[digital preservation]].&lt;ref name=Mod&gt;{{cite web|title=Modernization |url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/about-us/modernization/Pages/default.aspx |publisher=LAC |accessdate=May 26, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611165743/http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/about-us/modernization/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=June 11, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Documentary Heritage Management Framework developed in 2009 seeks the right balance between resources dedicated to analogue and digital materials and is based on:
*three main business pillars: acquisition, preservation and resource discovery (''resource discovery'' includes description, discovery, access and services to the public)
*four guiding principles for fulfilling its documentary heritage mandate, i.e. significance, sufficiency, sustainability and society (broad social context)
*four key roles, i.e. foundation building (relationship building), collaboration, program (integrated collection management processes) and transfer (formal agreements with third parties to fulfill its legislated mandate).
Eight pilot research projects were initiated to validate the framework, including projects on military documentary heritage, aboriginal documentary heritage, and stewardship of newspapers in a digital age.&lt;ref name=DHMF&gt;{{cite web|title=Library and Archives Canada |url=http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/maf-crg/assessments-evaluations/2009/bal/bal-eng.asp |publisher=Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat |accessdate=June 5, 2013 |date=2009 |quote=Under the guidance of the new Deputy Head, Library and Archives Canada (LAC) has identified new strategic directions for the organization and implemented a change management agenda.

Following Caron's resignation in May 2013, a stakeholder coalition issued a joint statement on the qualities of a successful Librarian and Archivist of Canada for official consideration in what they consider a "matter of great national significance":&lt;ref name=KarstensSmith/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint Statement on Qualities of a Successful Librarian and Archivist of Canada|url=http://www.cdncouncilarchives.ca/Joint_Statement_24May_EN.pdf|accessdate=June 6, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907123818/http://cdncouncilarchives.ca/Joint_Statement_24May_EN.pdf|archivedate=September 7, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|A broad coalition of Canadian stakeholder organizations has developed the following list of qualities we believe the Librarian and Archivist of Canada should have in order to be successful in this critical position of public trust and responsibility.

In June 2013 the Heritage Minister said speeding up the digitization of records will be a priority for the new Librarian and Archivist of Canada.

== Truth and Reconciliation Commission ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12429">Throughout the years, the Cuban nation has developed a wealth of musicological material created by numerous investigators and experts on this subject.

==Early 20th century==

Apart from the work of some authors who provided information about the music in Cuba during the 19th century, that was usually included in chronicles covering a more general subject, the first investigations and studies specifically dedicated to the musical art and practice did not appear in Cuba until the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="valdes"&gt;Valdés Cantero, Alicia, Determined women ready to succeed. The ''International Journal of Cuban Studies'', 2 December 2008. http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/library/i18088_3.pdf{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, musicological research and documentation in Cuba was not undertaken by professionals fully dedicated to that subject, but instead it was conducted by historians, ethnologists or composers such as polymath [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] (b. 1881) or composer [[Eduardo Sánchez de Fuentes]] (b. 1874). The controversy sustained by these distinguished personalities in reference to the possible African (or indigenous) roots of Cuban music spanned several decades, from the 1930s to the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, Fernando. Africanía de la Música Folklórica de Cuba. Editora Universitaria, La Habana, Cuba. 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another important personality, María Muñoz (b. 1886), a Galician pianist, professor and choir conductor that graduated at the Madrid Conservatory under the guidance of Manuel de Falla, developed an outstanding musical activity in Cuba. Together with her husband Antonio Quevedo, she co-founded the Society of Contemporary Music in 1929, promoted the cultural journal “Musicalia” and founded the Havana Choral Society.&lt;ref&gt;Orovio, Helio. Cuban music from A to Z. Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, UK. 2004. P.145&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Fernando Ortiz, she gave summer courses on musicology at the [[Havana University]] from the 1930s. Those courses nurtured and stimulated the careers of some future outstanding musicologists such as [[María Teresa Linares Savio]] (b. 1920).&lt;ref name="valdes"/&gt;

One of the earliest contribution to musicological studies in [[Cuba]] was provided by Emilio Grenet, brother of the famous Cuban composer [[Eliseo Grenet]].
 
Emilio Grenet was born in [[Havana]] in 1901 and passed away in the same city, in 1941. He studied [[Sight-reading]] and [[Music theory]] with professor Armando Laguardia and worked as a pianist in [[New York City]] in 1923. After returning to Cuba he traveled to Spain where he met composer [[Joaquín Turina]] who introduced him to his professor of [[Harmony]], [[Conrado del Campo]].

Grenet returned again to [[Cuba]] where he worked in the Education Ministry Radio Station, started his investigations about the genres of Cuban popular music and travelled to [[New York City]] to record with the orchestra of his brother [[Eliseo Grenet]]. He taught [[Musical composition]] to the renowned Cuban conductor Enrique González Mántici and [[Harmony]] to the composer and guitarist Vicente González Rubiera ([[Guyún]]).

In 1939, Grenet published his important work "Cuban popular music", which represented a serious study of the Cuban popular music genres, and a thorough insight into the most important aspects of the musical creation in [[Cuba]], from the 19th Century until that time. The book also included 80 scores of representative compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Emilio Grenet. EcuRed: https://www.ecured.cu/Emilio_Grenet. Retrieved: 07-30-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1940s and 1950s==

[[File:Alejocarpentier.jpg|thumb|right|100px|&lt;center&gt;Alejo Carpentier.]]
In 1946, the famous Cuban writer, art critic and musicologist [[Alejo Carpentier]] (b. 104) established a benchmark with his work “La música en Cuba” (1946), an attempt to put together a comprehensive history of Cuban music from the 16th century until his time. Although the work presented as facts some controversial historical issues, such as the origins of the well known “Son de la Mateodora” and the “Cuban Contradanza”, this important study (based on extensive investigations conducted by Carpentier) offered a deep insight into Cuban music history never witnessed before.
 
Coincidentally, young composers and musicologists such as [[Argeliers León]] (b. 1918) and Hilario González (b. 1920) were diligently working along with [[José Ardévol]]  at “Grupo de Renovación Musical” to improve and renovate  the Cuban musical panorama.&lt;ref&gt;EcuRed. Grupo de Renovación Musical. http://www.ecured.cu/index.php/Grupo_de_Renovaci%C3%B3n_Musical&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, [[Argeliers León]] continued offering the musicology summer courses started by María Muñoz and [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] at the Havana University and served as a professor of such prominent students as pianist and professor Ana Margarita Aguilera Ripoll (b. 1903), author of the important compilation of children songs “Cancionero Infantil de Hispanoamérica.” Other contemporary Cuban musicologists were María Antonieta Henriquez, founder of the National Museum of Music, and [[Lydia Cabrera]], an anthropologist renowned for her studies of Afro-Cuban music.&lt;ref name="valdes"/&gt;

==Post revolutionary period (1959)==

After the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Pablo Hernández Balaguer (b. 1928) was teaching musicology at the Oriente University, an educational institution that offered the first Music Degree in the history of Cuba. Balaguer conducted an important study about the work of composer Esteban Salas and published the Music Catalog from the archives of the Santiago de Cuba Cathedral. He was a professor of several distinguished musicologists such as Virtudes Feliú Herrera (b. 1941), who conducted a thorough research into Cuban historical ritual and festive traditions. Her work has been compiled in the “Ethnographic Atlas of Cuba,” which received an award from the Cuban Academy of Science.&lt;ref name="valdes"/&gt;


[[Argeliers León]] and his wife María Teresa Linares were the leading figures of Cuban musicology during the early decades after the Cuban Revolution (1959). Between 1961 and 1970, León was de director of the Institute of Ethnology and Folklore at the Academy of Sciences of Cuba and he also headed the Folklore Department at the National Theater of Cuba, the Music Department of the José Martí National Library and the Music Department at Casa de Las Américas. He served as professor at the Havana Municipal Conservatory, taught African cultures in Cuba at the Havana University and musicology at the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA). As a musicologist he published several books which included Del Canto y el Tiempo (1974), where he proposed a subdivision in “generic complexes” to study the musical styles in Cuba.&lt;ref name="orovio"&gt;Orovio, Helio. Cuban music from A to Z. Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, UK. 2004. P. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

María Teresa Linares conducted extensive investigation on several areas of Cuban music history and published numerous books and articles. She worked as a professor at the Alejandro García Caturla Conservatory, the Havana University and the Institute of Ethnology and Folklore at the Academy of Sciences. Until year 2000 she was the director of the Museum of Music, and at a later time she was affiliated to the Fernando Ortiz Foundation.&lt;ref name="orovio"/&gt;

During the first decade of the Cuban Revolution (1960 to 1970) an emerging generation of musicologists started to acquire recognition within the Cuban musical scene. We should mention, in first place, two humble and dedicated investigators that had certain common characteristics. They both had university backgrounds and worked for many years at the José Martí National Library as researchers; also their main subjects of investigation were somewhat related to the musicological work of Alejo Carpentier. Alberto Muguercia (b. 19280), a lawyer from Santiago de Cuba holds the honor of having refuted one of the greatest myths in the history of Cuban music: The “Son de la Ma Teodora” origins. In his famous book “La música en Cuba”, Alejo Carpentier categorically attributed a 16th-century origin to a popular melody called Son de la Ma Teodora without conducting a thorough investigation about the subject, thus establishing an erroneous fact as a popular tradition.  In a brilliant article about this subject: “Teodora Ginés: ¿Mito o realidad histórica? Muguercia demonstrated the inaccuracy of this theory.&lt;ref name="orovio"/&gt;

In turn, Zolia Lapique (b. 1930), a librarian and historian, refuted a theory formulated by Carpentier in reference to the French-Haitian origin of the “Contradanza Cubana”. She attributed an earlier development and other possible origins (Spanish and English) to this musical style in her outstanding article: “Aportes Franco-Haitianos a la contradanza cubana: mitos y realidades.”  &lt;ref&gt;Giro, Radamés. Panorama de la Música Popular Cubana. Editorial Letras Cubanas, 1995. P. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent members of this generation are: Cristóbal Díaz Ayala (b. 1930), author of a complete Cuban music discography, Jorge Ibarra (b. 1931), Leonardo Acosta (b. 1933), Dulcila Cañizares (b. 1936), Raul Martínez Rodríguez (b. 1937), Helio Orovio (b. 1938), Radamés Giro (b. 1940), [[Danilo Orozco]] (b. 1944) and Alberto Faya (1944).&lt;ref name="orovio"/&gt;

==The second generation (1970s) and beyond==

The members of the second generation of Cuban musicologists that appeared during the Cuban Revolution period, graduated in their great majority either from the Havana Municipal Conservatory or the [[Instituto Superior de Arte]] (ISA), which from 1976 offered the first Musicology Degree in the history of Cuba. Many of them worked at a later time at the newly created Centro para la investigación y desarrollo de la música cubana (CIDMUC), founded in 1978.&lt;ref name="valdes"/&gt;
From this group we should mention two renowned musicologists that frequently worked in collaboration with each other: Victoria Elí (b. 1945) and Zoila Gómez (b. 1948). We should also mention Tamahra Martín (b. 1945), who dedicated two books to the Cuban choral music: “La música coral en Cuba” (1987) and “Música Coral” (1990).

[[File:Rolando Antonio Pérez Fernández.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Rolando Antonio Pérez Fernández, musicólogo, violonchelista y profesor cubano.]]
Two other important musicologists from this generation are: [[Alberto Alén Pérez]]  (b. 1948) and [[Rolando Antonio Pérez Fernández]] (b. 1947). Alberto Alén applied his extensive knowledge of psychology and statistics to musical form analysis as well as music pedagogy, in publications such as: “La forma de las formas musicales” and “Diagnosticar la musicalidad”. Rolando Pérez developed extensive investigations about Afro-Cuban music and is well known for having documented and analyzed the process of transition from ternary rhythms to binary rhythms of the Cuban and Latin American popular music, during the 18th and 19th centuries, in his book: “Proceso de binarización de los ritmos ternarios africanos en América Latina (1987).”&lt;ref name="orovio"/&gt;

Olavo Alén (b. 1947) has closely followed the steps of Argeliers León in his studies of Afro-Cuban music and, most importantly, has elaborated and expanded León's theory of “generic complexes”, in works such as: “Géneros de la música cubana” from 1976.&lt;ref name="orovio"/&gt; 

Those theories have been strongly refuted by other musicologists such as Leonardo Acosta, who explains in his article “De los complejos genéricos y otras cuestiones”: 

{{Cita|“Fortunately, the theology [sic] of generic complexes has been viewed with skepticism in musicological circles of several countries, including Cuba, where quite a few musicologists have oscillated [in his opinion]&lt;ref&gt;Note by the editor.&lt;/ref&gt;between rejection, disbelief and disdain …” &lt;ref&gt;Acosta, Leonardo. De los complejos genéricos y otras cuestiones. Clave. Publicación del Instituto Cubano de la Música. Año 4, No. 3, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

Other members of this Group are renowned musicologists Martha Ezquenazi (1949), Jesús Gómez Cairo (1949) and Dora Ileana Torres (1956).

'''''Painkiller: Resurrection''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] video game developed by Homegrown Games and published by [[DreamCatcher Interactive]] (now acquired by Nordic Games). It is a stand-alone expansion to the 2004 ''[[Painkiller (video game)|Painkiller]]'' developed by  Homegrown Games, and runs on an updated version of PainEngine. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2009. An [[Xbox 360]] version was also planned, but was cancelled.

== Gameplay ==
''Painkiller: Resurrection'' is based on a story game, compared to the other ''Painkiller'' games. The game's basic gameplay is similar to that of the original ''Painkiller'': the player has to face off numerous enemies and defeat them, moving from one location to another. All the weapons, as before, have alternative fire regimes. The slight difference in gameplay is this: the levels are large, with various paths and sections, which require the player to explore the environments between battles. Sometimes, minor objectives are given to player to accomplish. The main gameplay difference from the original game, is that the player most of the time can freely access the whole map, without waiting in one particular closed place, until all of the monsters will spawn; this enables a somewhat freedom of movement feeling and confusion as well, as often it will be unclear where to proceed next. This drastic change of gameplay is a questionable feature, because certain spawn and waypoint related bugs will appear due to that. The majority of enemies and all the original weapons are presented, and there is one new type of monster included. The game features some new additional gameplay elements not seen in original or its other expansions. This includes:
* Only six levels (and 7th hidden level) 
* New protagonist with new phrases.
* 2 new weapons (one of which was not made available until a later patch).
* Voice of an ally, Elyahim, accompanies the player through his journey, giving advice and objectives.
* The cutscenes are presented as a comic book similar in style to ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]''.

== Plot ==
The story begins outside of the events depicted in other games and stars new protagonist: William "Bill" Sherman. Blown to pieces by his own [[C-4 (explosive)|C4]] payload, with which he wanted to eliminate a group of mobsters. The fact that he also accidentally blew up a bus full of innocent civilians has given rise to an all new problem - Hell doesn't exactly have any issues with claiming his soul. Now Bill's in purgatory and he's caught the eye of one of the Elyahim, the female spirits who guide the souls of men through purgatory. Guided by the Elyahim's voice, Bill, like Daniel Garner, is sent through this unholy realm to save his soul by destroying evil beings. After he defeats [[Aamon]], a monstrous dog demon, a greater demon appears, revealing himself to be [[Astaroth]], one of the generals of Lucifer. He asks Bill to join him, but Bill rejects. Surprisingly, Astaroth leaves Bill to continue his fight. After defeating a powerful spider-like demon, an angel, [[Ramiel]], appears, asking Bill to continue his fighting and clean the purgatory in exchange for a chance to return to life. Later, after more fighting through demons, Bill is greeted by Elyahim in person. She explains that Ramiel betrayed the Heaven and now he and Astaroth are planning to conquer the purgatory, so it could become their dominion. As Hell and Heaven are weakened, they would be able to claim all the new souls coming to the afterlife and soon become the most prominent force in the world. However, to do so, they needed Bill to eliminate the majority of demons, so none of them would reveal to Hell Astaroth's true motives. Now, Bill has to battle both of them at the same time. He kills Astaroth and wounds Ramiel, who begs him to spare his life. In exchange, Ramiel will return Bill back to Earth. From this points, the three endings are possible.

*Good ending: Ramiel fulfills his promises and sends Bill back to life. Bill arrives a night before the incident happened. He takes the C4 off the car and throws it to the sea. Bill smiles, being happy for the first time. He decides to never return to killing again, understanding that the sole meaning of life is the life itself.
*Bad ending: Ramiel fulfills his promises and sends Bill back to life. But it is all a trick, as Bill is sent to the exact moment he committed his greatest sin and died. Bill, again, tries to save the bus... but is killed again, this time being sent to Hell forever.
*Neutral ending: Ramiel awaits Bill to agree to be sent back to life, but Elyahim appears. She warns Bill that the angel cannot be trusted as he has become corrupted. From her, Bill receives a holy sword: the only weapon with which a mortal could kill an angel. Bill strikes Ramiel and kills him. From now on, he is awarded by the heavens to be the ruler of the realm of purgatory.

A '''pelican crossing''' (previously '''pelicon crossing''', which stood for "'''pe'''destrian '''li'''ght '''con'''trolled '''crossing'''") is a type of [[pedestrian crossing]], which features a pair of poles each with a standard set of [[traffic lights]] facing oncoming traffic, a push button and two illuminated, coloured pictograms facing the pedestrian from across the road. These are a red, stationary person to indicate that it is not safe to cross, and a green, walking person to indicate that it is safe to do so. Pelican crossings also provide non-visual indication that it is safe to cross, such as a beep, vibrating button or tactile rotating cone in order to assist [[Visual impairment|visually impaired]] pedestrians. Usage of pelican crossings is confined mainly to the UK, where they were invented, and in Ireland. A comparable system called the [[HAWK beacon]] is used in the United States.

==Details==
[[File:20030614 08 Orpington High Street.jpg|thumb|200px|Pelican crossing, [[Orpington]] (2003)]]
[[File:Green man panel.jpg|thumb|left|120px|A pelican crossing control panel]]
[[File:Green man uk.jpg|thumb|200px|The "green person" signal]]
The name is derived from ''PELICON'', a portmanteau of ''pe''destrian ''li''ght ''con''trolled. The term ''pelican crossing'' originated in the [[United Kingdom]], but similar traffic control devices are in use throughout the world. The term is also used in the [[Republic of Ireland]].

The pelican crossing was a relatively minor development of the "x–way" crossing. This earlier crossing was largely identical to the pelican crossing, but instead of a green light for motorists, featured a white diagonal cross. The intention of this was to distinguish the crossing lights from any nearby junction (standard) traffic lights). The white cross was widely criticised and users and motoring organisations alike called for the white cross to be replaced by a green light. With some changes to the light timings and road markings, the "x–way" crossing became the pelican crossing.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the pelican crossing was the first definitive light-controlled crossing for pedestrians, introduced in 1969. This was after the earlier failed experiment of the [[panda crossing]]. Previously only [[zebra crossing]]s had been used, which have warning signals ([[Belisha beacon]]s), but no control signals. The pedestrian lights are situated on the far side of the road to the pedestrian. A [[puffin crossing]] has the lights on the same side as the pedestrian; a [[toucan crossing]] is a crossing for pedestrians and [[bicycle]]s; a [[pegasus crossing]] allows horse riders to cross as well. 

Additionally, a pelican crossing, as distinct from a puffin crossing, has the special feature that while the green person flashes to indicate that pedestrians may continue crossing but may not start to cross, the red light changes to an amber flashing light permitting cars to pass if there are no further pedestrians. This reduces the delay to traffic. 

Under UK law{{citation needed|reason=|date=September 2015}}, pelican crossings that go straight across the road are defined as a single crossing, even when there is a central island. Therefore, traffic in both directions must wait until pedestrians have finished crossing and the signal is green or flashing amber. This rule is different from similar standard pedestrian crossings where each portion of the crossing is treated as a separate crossing. However, at installations where the crossings that cross each carriageway are separate crossings, the crossing is staggered.

In 1974, ''[[Dad's Army]]'' performed a [[public information film]] to explain the pelican crossing, and how it works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pelican Crossing (Dad's Army) (1974)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_AaiNL8H54|date=8 October 2009|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pelican Crossing-Motorist-Dads Army|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxRJvArUYwA|date=19 November 2009|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, [[Paul Greenwood]] sung "The Pelican Crossing Song", again explaining how a pelican crossing works. In 2000, [[Shooglenifty]] incorporated samples of a pelican crossing into their album ''[[Solar Shears]]''.

Statutory authority for pelican crossings was removed in the 2016 update of the [[Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions]]. After 22 October 2016, no new pelican crossings can be installed on public highways in the UK, except work in progress where there was a six-month saving. Puffin crossings are to be installed instead. &lt;ref name="TSGRD 2016"&gt;{{cite web

===Internationally===
* In [[Hong Kong]], where control panels are also used as in the United Kingdom, no zig-zag lines are marked. At some crossings the traffic signals still turn to red; but at much longer intervals.
* A [[HAWK beacon]], used with a standard pedestrian crossing signal, stops traffic when a pedestrian pushes a button to cross, but goes dark unless activated. It was allowed in experimental applications in the United States until 2009 and is now a standard option for transportation engineers. 
* [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], indicates pedestrian-controlled crossings using flashing green signals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icbc.com/driver-licensing/Getting-licensed/drivers3.pdf ICBC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022032056/http://www.icbc.com/driver-licensing/Getting-licensed/drivers3.pdf |date=22 October 2013 }}, Chapter 3, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; When a pedestrian activates the signal, the flashing green turns steady green, followed by yellow and red. When the crossing phase is complete, the signal returns to flashing green.

'''''Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides''''' is a 2011 American [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] [[swashbuckler film]], the fourth installment in the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|''Pirates of the Caribbean'' film series]] and the sequel to ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]'' (2007). It is the first film in the series not to be directed by [[Gore Verbinski]], being replaced by [[Rob Marshall]]. [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] again served as producer. The film is technically a [[Sequel#Standalone sequels|stand-alone sequel]] to the previous installments. In the film, which draws its plot loosely from the novel ''[[On Stranger Tides]]'' by [[Tim Powers]], [[Jack Sparrow|Captain Jack Sparrow]] ([[Johnny Depp]]) is joined by [[Angelica (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Angelica]] ([[Penélope Cruz]]) in his search for the [[Fountain of Youth]], confronting the infamous pirate [[Blackbeard (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Blackbeard]] ([[Ian McShane]]). The film was produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and released in the United States on May 20, 2011. It was the first film in the series to be released in the [[Disney Digital 3-D]] and [[IMAX 3D]] formats.

Writers [[Ted Elliott (screenwriter)|Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]] first learned of Powers' novel ''[[On Stranger Tides]]'' during the back-to-back production of ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]'' (2006) and ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]'', and considered it a good starting point for a new film in the series. Pre-production started after the end of the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]], with Depp collaborating with the writers on the story design. [[Principal photography]] lasted for 106 days between June and November 2010, with locations in Hawaii, the United Kingdom, Puerto Rico and California. Filming employed [[3D film|3D]] cameras similar to those used in the production of the 2009 film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', and ten companies were involved with the film's [[visual effects]]. Following inflated production costs which ballooned the net budget to $379 million, the film is currently regarded as the [[List of most expensive films|most expensive film ever made]].

''On Stranger Tides'' broke many box office records upon release, was the [[2011 in film#Highest-grossing films|third highest-grossing film of 2011]], and it stands as the [[List of highest-grossing films|28th-highest-grossing film of all time worldwide]] when not adjusting for inflation. Critical reviews were mixed, with the film receiving criticism over its writing, directing, excessiveness and lack of originality; positive mentions were given on the acting, action sequences, music, visuals and the running time for being much shorter than the previous two films. A fifth film, titled ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales|Dead Men Tell No Tales]]'', was released in 2017.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. --&gt;
After a failed attempt to rescue his first mate, [[Joshamee Gibbs]], in London, [[Jack Sparrow|Captain Jack Sparrow]] is brought before [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]. The king wants Jack to guide an expedition to the [[Fountain of Youth]] before [[Ferdinand VI of Spain|King Ferdinand]] and the [[Spanish Navy]] can locate it. Jack's old nemesis, Captain [[Hector Barbossa]], now a [[privateer]] in service to the [[Royal Navy|British Navy]] after losing his leg and ship, the ''[[Black Pearl]]'', which he says was sunk, is heading the expedition.

Jack refuses the offer and escapes. He meets up with his father, [[Captain Teague]], who warns Jack about the Fountain's rituals. Jack learns someone is impersonating him to recruit a crew to find the Fountain. The impostor is [[Angelica (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Angelica]], Jack's former lover, and the daughter of the ruthless pirate [[Blackbeard (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Blackbeard]], who practices [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] magic and wields the mythical "Sword of [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]" that controls his ship, the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]''. While Jack is [[Shanghaiing|shanghaied]] aboard Blackbeard's ship, Gibbs escapes execution by memorizing and destroying Jack's map showing the Fountain's location, forcing Barbossa to take him along.

Meanwhile, after a failed [[mutiny]] aboard the ''Queen Anne's Revenge'', Jack is forced to guide the crew to the Fountain. Blackbeard seeks the Fountain's power to circumvent his predestined fatal encounter with a "one-legged man", who happened to be Barbossa. Jack must find two silver chalices aboard [[Juan Ponce de León]]'s missing [[flagship]], the ''Santiago''. The Fountain's water must simultaneously be drunk by two people from the chalices. Drinking from one chalice containing a [[mermaid]]'s tear will extend life; the second person dies, their remaining years of life transferred to the other drinker. Jack also discovers that the ''Black Pearl'' was captured and shrunk before being added to Blackbeard's collection of other shrunken [[Ship in a bottle|ships in bottles]].

The ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' heads for Whitecap Bay to find and harvest mermaid tears. After managing to lure in a mermaid named Tamara, she summons other mermaids to attack the crew before Jack causes an explosion that scares them away. A mermaid named Syrena is caught, but Philip Swift, a captive missionary, falls in love with her. Reaching Ponce de León's ship on an uncharted island, Angelica and Blackbeard coerce Jack into retrieving both chalices. Jack locates the grounded, decaying vessel, only to find Barbossa there. Both guess that the Spanish have taken the chalices, after they are nowhere to be found on the vessel.

Jack and Barbossa team up to sneak into the Spanish camp and steal the chalices. Barbossa reveals he only wants revenge against Blackbeard for attacking the ''Black Pearl'', and his leg being amputated. Jack and Barbossa escape with the chalices. Meanwhile, Syrena, reciprocating Philip's love, is tricked into shedding a tear. Blackbeard collects it, leaving her to die of dehydration while Philip is forced to go with them. Jack returns with the chalices and bargains with Blackbeard for Angelica's safety, Jack's confiscated magical compass (which they took from him before sending him to get the chalices), and Gibbs' release. In return, Jack vows to give Blackbeard the chalices and lead him to the Fountain; Blackbeard agrees, and Gibbs is set free with the compass.

At the Fountain, Blackbeard's crew is confronted by Barbossa and his men and they battle while Barbossa and Blackbeard fight. The Spanish suddenly arrive, intending to destroy the Fountain, believing its power an abomination against God. They crush the chalices and throw them in the swamp. When Barbossa stabs Blackbeard with a poisoned sword, Angelica pulls it out but is cut and poisoned. Jack notices Angelica is poisoned and begins frantically searching the swamp for the chalices. Barbossa obtains Blackbeard's magic sword and gains control of the ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' and her crew. Despite resistance from Blackbeard's crew, the Spanish successfully pull down a pillar, crushing the Fountain of Youth. The Spanish army leaves once the fountain is in ruins. Philip is mortally wounded, but he returns to free Syrena. She helps Jack retrieve the missing chalices and gives them to him, telling him not to waste her tear. Syrena goes back to the dying Philip. She says she can save him if he asks her to. When he asks for her forgiveness, she kisses him and takes him underwater.&lt;!-- DO NOT ADD SPECULATION CONCERNING SYRENA'S REASONING FOR TAKING PHILIP UNDERWATER (SUCH AS TO SAVE HIM OR EAT HIM). THE REASON IS NEVER EXPLICITLY STATED IN THE FILM.--&gt;

With Blackbeard and Angelica both nearing death, Jack retrieves the last remaining drops of water from the destroyed fountain and puts the tear in one of them. Knowing that one of them must be sacrificed, he wants Angelica to drink from the chalice containing the tear. Instead, Blackbeard drinks it, asking his daughter to save him. Angelica agrees and drinks from the second chalice. Jack is upset to lose Angelica, but reveals that he made a mistake about which chalice contained the tear. Neither of the two are happy, and they both believe Jack deliberately tricked them. Angelica's wounds are healed as the Fountain fatally consumes Blackbeard's body, killing him.

Eventually, Jack and Angelica admit their love for each other, yet he distrusts her intentions (aware that she may try to avenge her father) and strands her on a [[cay]]. Now wielding Blackbeard's magical sword, Barbossa captains the ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' and returns to piracy. Jack finds Gibbs, who had used the compass to locate the ''Revenge''. He reclaims the shrunken ''Black Pearl'' and the other conquered ships in bottles, carrying them in a [[gunny sack]]. The two leave, [[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales|hoping to revert the ''Black Pearl'' to its original size and continue living the pirates' life]].

In a [[post-credits scene]], a [[voodoo doll]] of Jack crafted by Blackbeard washes ashore and is found by Angelica, who then smiles.&lt;!-- PER WP: DO NOT ADD SPECULATION CONCERNING ANGELICA'S INTENTIONS TO USE THE VOODOO DOLL, AS WE DON'T KNOW IF IT STILL WORKS OR NOT.--&gt;

===Development===
Shortly before the premiere of ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]'', [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] stated it was the end of the trilogy, but the idea of a spin-off was still possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/movies/the-pirates-treasure/story-e6frf9h6-1111113501994 |title=The pirates' treasure |first=Peter |last=Mitchell |work=[[Herald Sun]] |date=May 10, 2007 |accessdate=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the film's successful opening weekend, [[Dick Cook]], then Chairman of the [[List of assets owned by Disney#Studio Entertainment|Walt Disney Studios]], said he was interested in a fourth installment. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' also reported that rights to a book were bought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/29/business/fi-boxoffice29 |title=4th `Pirates' film already on horizon |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=May 29, 2007 |first=Josh |last=Friedman |accessdate=July 13, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106152812/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/29/business/fi-boxoffice29 |archivedate=November 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ted Elliott (screenwriter)|Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]] had started working on a script in 2007, but they were interrupted by the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]], and only resumed in mid-2008.&lt;ref name=making/&gt;

In June 2009, Bruckheimer indicated Disney would prefer the fourth installment of ''Pirates '' to be released before ''[[The Lone Ranger (2013 film)|The Lone Ranger]]'' film, which he, Johnny Depp, [[Ted Elliott (screenwriter)|Ted Elliott]], and [[Terry Rossio]] had been working on for release on May 20, 2011. He hoped [[Gore Verbinski]] would return to direct the fourth film, as his ''[[BioShock#Canceled film|BioShock]]'' film adaptation had been put on hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Douglas, Edward |title=Bruckheimer gives updates on Pirates &amp; The Lone Ranger |work=ComingSoon.net |date=June 11, 2009 |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=56211 |accessdate=June 11, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722105720/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=56211 |archivedate=July 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Verbinski was unavailable due to his commitment with ''[[Rango (2011 film)|Rango]]'' the same year, Bruckheimer suggested [[Rob Marshall]], who he considered a "premiere filmmaker", stating that "Every film [Marshall] made I thought was unique and different."&lt;ref name=Collider/&gt; On July 21, 2009, Marshall accepted the job, because of the "whole new story line and set of characters.

Cook resigned in September 2009 after working for Disney for over 38 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/19/business/fi-ct-disney19 |title=Walt Disney Studios chief Dick Cook abruptly leaves the company |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=September 19, 2009 |first1=Dawn C. |last1=Chmielewski |first2=Claudia |last2=Eller |first3=Ben |last3=Fritz |date=September 19, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020142943/http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/19/business/fi-ct-disney19 |archivedate=October 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depp's faith in ''Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides'' was somewhat shaken after the resignation, with Depp explaining that "There's a fissure, a crack in my enthusiasm at the moment. It was all born in that office".&lt;ref name="Shocked"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2009/09/johnny-depp-says-hes-shocked-and-very-sad-about-dick-cooks-departure.html |title=Johnny Depp says he's 'shocked and very sad' about Dick Cook's departure |first=Claudia |last=Eller |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 18, 2009 |accessdate=July 5, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330141138/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2009/09/johnny-depp-says-hes-shocked-and-very-sad-about-dick-cooks-departure.html |archivedate=March 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depp also explained Cook was one of the few who accepted his portrayal of Jack Sparrow: "When things went a little sideways on the [[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl|first ''Pirates'' movie]] and others at the studio were less than enthusiastic about my interpretation of the character, Dick was there from the first moment. He trusted me".&lt;ref name="Shocked"/&gt;

===Writing===
During production of ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]'' and ''At World's End'', writers [[Ted Elliott (screenwriter)|Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]] discovered [[Tim Powers]]' 1987 novel ''[[On Stranger Tides]]'', which they considered a good foundation on which to base "a new chapter" in the ''Pirates'' series.&lt;ref name=Collider&gt;{{cite news|last=Weintraub |first=Steve |title=Producer Jerry Bruckheimer On Set Interview |url=http://collider.com/jerry-bruckheimer-interview-pirates-caribbean-4-on-stranger-tides-lone-ranger/74214/ |accessdate=April 21, 2011 |newspaper=Collider |date=February 3, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411090507/http://collider.com/jerry-bruckheimer-interview-pirates-caribbean-4-on-stranger-tides-lone-ranger/74214 |archivedate=April 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Disney bought the rights to the novel in April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2009/10/surprised-author-tim-powers-finds-himself-setting-sail-with-pirates-of-the-caribbean-.html |title=Surprised author Tim Powers finds himself setting sail with 'Pirates of the Caribbean' |date=October 6, 2009 |work=Los Angeles Times |author=Boucher, Geoff |accessdate=July 5, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809015550/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2009/10/surprised-author-tim-powers-finds-himself-setting-sail-with-pirates-of-the-caribbean-.html |archivedate=August 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rossio stated that he and Elliot had considered using Blackbeard and the Fountain of Youth in the story before reading the book, "but whenever you say those words, Powers' novel comes to mind. There was no way we could work in that field without going into territory Tim had explored." However, they denied that it would be a straight version of the novel: "Blackbeard came from the book, and in the book there is a daughter character, too. But Jack Sparrow is not in the book, nor is Barbossa. So I wouldn't call this an adaptation."&lt;ref name=making/&gt; Rossio declared the script was written to be a standalone film, "kind of a ''[[James Bond in film|James Bond]]'' sort of thing", instead of the "designed to be a trilogy" structure of the previous installments.&lt;ref name=rossio/&gt; They hoped to "design a story that would support new characters," as characters such as [[Will Turner]] would not return.&lt;ref name=making2/&gt; Bruckheimer added that there was a decision to "streamline the story a little bit, make it a little simpler and not have as many characters to follow", as the number of characters and subplots in ''At World's End'' caused the film to have an unwieldy length.&lt;ref name=Collider/&gt; The duo decided to employ another sea myth alluded in the previous episodes: mermaids,&lt;ref name=rossio/&gt; which are briefly referenced in the book. The mermaids' role expanded in the script, which included a vast attack sequence.&lt;ref name=making2/&gt;

Depp was deeply involved with the story design, frequently meeting the writers to show what he was interested in doing, and in the words of Rossio, being "involved in coming up with story lines, connecting characters, creating moments that we would then fashion, shape and then go back."&lt;ref name=rossio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/terry-rossio-interview-pirates-caribbean-4-on-stranger-tides/74250/ |title=Screenwriter Terry Rossio On Set Interview: Pirates of the Caribbean 4: On Stranger Tides |first=Steve |last=Weintraub |date=February 3, 2011 |publisher=Collider |accessdate=July 29, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126170214/http://collider.com/terry-rossio-interview-pirates-caribbean-4-on-stranger-tides/74250/ |archivedate=November 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Depp's suggestions were turning Phillip into a missionary and having a Spanish contingent following the protagonists. Afterwards, Rob Marshall and executive producer John DeLuca met Rossio and Elliot, and did alterations of their own, including building the female lead.&lt;ref name=making2/&gt;

After the joint production of ''Dead Man's Chest'' and ''At World's End'' cost over $300 million, Disney decided to give a lower budget to the fourth installment.&lt;ref name="Stewart (2011)"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Stewart |first=Andrew |title=Fourth try aims to stir high 'Tides' at B.O. |date=May 19, 2011 |work=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118037362 |accessdate=May 20, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523102701/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118037362 |archivedate=May 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many costs had to be cut, including moving primary production to Hawaii and London, where tax credits are more favorable, and having a shorter shooting schedule and fewer scenes featuring special effects compared to ''At World's End''.&lt;ref name="Budget"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/03/business/la-fi-ct-bruckheimer-20100427 |title=Not even Bruckheimer movies can escape budget cuts |date=May 3, 2010 |accessdate=July 5, 2010 |author1=Eller, Claudia |author2=Chmielewski, Dawn C. |work=Los Angeles Times |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105020450/http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/03/business/la-fi-ct-bruckheimer-20100427 |archivedate=November 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tighter schedule—according to Bruckheimer, "We had a 22-week post, and for a picture like this, with almost 1,200 visual effects shots, it's usually 40 weeks"—meant that Marshall supervised editing of sequences during filming.&lt;ref name=making2/&gt; The British financial statements of the film revealed total expenditures of £240.7 million ($410.6 million) by 2013, with Disney receiving a rebate of $32.1 million from the British government, making ''Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides'' the [[List of most expensive films|most expensive film ever made]] to date.&lt;ref name="expensive"/&gt;

Bruckheimer said the decision to film in 3D was made due to its being "immersive filmmaking; I think it makes you part of the actual filming because you're part of the screen." Bruckheimer described it as the first major "exterior movie" to be shot in 3D, as ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' was mostly done in sound stages.&lt;ref name=Collider/&gt; At first Marshall was not much interested in 3D, but the director eventually considered it a film that could benefit from the format. "You are on an adventure and with the 3D experience you are inside that adventure."&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt; While the original plan was to add 3D effects during post-production, the decision was made to shoot digitally with 3D cameras. Only one sequence was shot conventionally and needed a [[2D to 3D conversion|3D conversion]].&lt;ref name=Collider/&gt; The cameras were improved versions of the ones [[James Cameron]] developed for ''Avatar'', which were made more compact for extra mobility. This meant the cameras could be brought into locations such as the Hawaiian jungle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/new-3d-technology-pirates-caribbean-191030 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60nhmJU8j?url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/new-3d-technology-pirates-caribbean-191030 |archivedate=August 9, 2011 |title=The New 3D Technology Behind 'Pirates of the Caribbean' |date=May 22, 2011 |accessdate=July 29, 2011 |author=Giardina, Carolyn |work=The Hollywood Reporter |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Queen Anne's Revenge'' was built atop ''Sunset'', the same ship used to depict ''Black Pearl'' in previous installments. In February 2010, ''Sunset'' was sailed from Long Beach to a shipyard in Hawaii for the reforms, where a big concern was to make it imposing, with three stories, without sacrificing actual [[seakeeping]]. Given Blackbeard was meant to be the meanest pirate to appear in the series, the look for ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' was ominous, with sails dyed blood red, various elements on fire, and a decoration based on skulls and bones (drawing inspiration from the [[Sedlec Ossuary]] in Czech Republic). Damage from cannon fire was also added to show that "not only Blackbeard was a dying man, but his ship is also a dying ship". The ship's [[figurehead]] also drew inspiration from Blackbeard's [[Jolly Roger|pirate flag]].&lt;ref name=voyage&gt;{{cite video|title=Last Sail/First Voyage|location=Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides Blu-ray|publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replica ship {{HMS|Surprise|replica ship|6}} was used for Barbossa's ship, HMS ''Providence'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Art of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides|first=Michael|last=Singer|publisher=Disney Editions|year=2011|ISBN=1-4231-3946-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all the scenes aboard ''Providence'' were shot on the Long Beach shore as ''Surprise'' could not be sailed to Hawaii.&lt;ref name=comm/&gt; Over 50 designs were considered for the Fountain of Youth, with the final one representing a temple built by an ancient civilization around the Fountain, which itself was located in a round rocky structure to represent "the circle of life". The locations leading up to the Fountain were shot in the Hawaiian islands of [[Kauai]] and [[Oahu]], but the Fountain itself was built at the [[007 Stage]] on Pinewood.&lt;ref name=fountain&gt;{{cite video|title=In Search of the Fountain|location=Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides Blu-ray|publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film an approval rating of 33% based on 259 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "It's shorter and leaner than the previous sequel, but this ''Pirates'' runs aground on a disjointed plot and a non-stop barrage of noisy action sequences."&lt;ref name="Rotten Tomatoes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pirates_of_the_caribbean_on_stranger_tides |title=Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides Reviews |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Flixster]] |accessdate=July 6, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170526154634/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pirates_of_the_caribbean_on_stranger_tides |archivedate=May 26, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[weighted average]] rating to reviews, gives the film an average score of 45 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/pirates-of-the-caribbean-on-stranger-tides |title=Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=May 26, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114155511/http://www.metacritic.com/movie/pirates-of-the-caribbean-on-stranger-tides |archivedate=November 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CinemaScore]] polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a "B+" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="naopening" /&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] gave ''On Stranger Tides'' two out of four stars, saying that although the removal of Knightley and Bloom as well as the addition of Cruz were positive aspects, the film in general was "too much of a muchness" for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110518/REVIEWS/110519968 |title=Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides |author=[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]] |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712000828/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20110518%2FREVIEWS%2F110519968 |archivedate=July 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Long of ''[[The Detroit News]]'' gave a D+, saying that Jack Sparrow had "worn out his welcome". Despite the more linear plot, "the movie is still ridiculous". He found ''On Stranger Tides'' to be "precisely what you'd expect of the fourth installment of a movie based on an amusement park ride: a whole lot of noise, plenty of stunts and complete silliness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://detnews.com/article/20110519/ENT02/105190330/Review--Fourth-‘Pirates’-movie-makes-little-sense-but-a-lot-of-noise#ixzz1RbNWYxiX|title=Review: Fourth 'Pirates' movie makes little sense but a lot of noise|first=Tom|last=Long|work=[[The Detroit News]]|accessdate=July 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; British film critic [[Mark Kermode]] gave the film an overwhelmingly negative review on his ''[[5 Live]]'' show, saying "it's not as staggeringly misjudged as the third part, because it is just nothing, it is just a big empty nothing, whereas part three I think was an active atrocity, it's just nothing at all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13475908 |title=Mark Kermode savages new Pirates Of The Caribbean film |work=[[BBC]] |date=May 20, 2011 |accessdate=May 24, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821022658/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13475908 |archivedate=August 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the previous films, the plot was criticized as incoherent and confusing. ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' critic Bill Goodykoontz rated the film two out of five, stating that "the movie is a series of distractions tossed together in the hopes that they will come together in a coherent story. That never really happens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/movies/articles/2011/05/18/20110518review-pirates-caribbean-stranger-tides-goodykoontz.html|title='Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,' 2 stars|first=Bill|last=Goodykoontz|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=May 18, 2011|accessdate=July 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online reviewer [[James Berardinelli]] considered the script "little more than a clothesline from which to dangle all of the obligatory set pieces",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=2311 |title=Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides |author=[[James Berardinelli|Berardinelli, James]] |date=May 19, 2011 |work=Reelviews |accessdate=August 1, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403074520/http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=2311 |archivedate=April 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[USA Today]]''{{'}}s Claudia Puig found ''On Stranger Tides'' "familiar and predictable...often incoherent and crammed with pointless details."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2011-05-27-On-Stranger-Tides-movie-review_n.htm |title='Pirates: On Stranger Tides' in precarious position |first=Claudia |last=Puig |date=May 19, 2011 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=August 1, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808033813/http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2011-05-27-On-Stranger-Tides-movie-review_n.htm |archivedate=August 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mike Scott from ''[[The Times-Picayune]]'' mentions that "while this latest chapter isn't quite sharp enough to restore the sense of discovery that made that first outing so darn exciting, it's enough to make up for most of the missteps that made the third one so darn arrgh-inducing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/movies/index.ssf/2011/05/pirates_of_the_caribbean_on_st.html |title=Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides |first=Mike |last=Scott |date=May 20, 2011 |work=The Times-Picayune |accessdate=August 1, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511213119/http://www.nola.com/movies/index.ssf/2011/05/pirates_of_the_caribbean_on_st.html |archivedate=May 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', Tasha Robinson described ''On Stranger Tides'' as "a smaller film than past installments, by design and necessity", and felt that "the series has needed this streamlining" as the film "feels lightweight, but that's still better than bloated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/pirates-of-the-caribbean-on-stranger-tides,56276/ |title=Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides |first=Tasha |last=Robinson |date=May 19, 2011 |work=[[The A.V.

''On Stranger Tides'' also had positive reviews; some critics found the film to be entertaining and well-made. [[Richard Roeper]] gave the film a B+, describing it as "the most fun installment since the first", calling the story "pure cartoon, but a lot easier to follow than the other sequels", and summing as "the franchise is getting tired, but Penelope energizes it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardroeper.com/reviews/piratesofthecaribbeanonstrangertides.aspx#share |title=Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides |publisher=[[ReelzChannel]] |author=[[Richard Roeper|Roeper, Richard]] |accessdate=August 1, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501170923/http://www.richardroeper.com/reviews/piratesofthecaribbeanonstrangertides.aspx |archivedate=May 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the same lines, Ann Hornaday of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' gave the film three out of four stars, writing that it "feels as fresh and bracingly exhilarating as the day Jack Sparrow first swashed his buckle, infusing new reckless energy into a franchise that shows no signs of furling its sails". She said that Marshall "swiftly and without fuss delivers the action set pieces and eye-popping escapism" and praised Depp, Cruz, and McShane's performances.&lt;ref name="Barker"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117945199?refcatid=31 |title=Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides |first=Andrew |last=Barker |date=May 12, 2011 |work=Variety |accessdate=August 1, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726234902/http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117945199?refcatid=31 |archivedate=July 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray Bennett from ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' considered that Marshall "shows terrific flair with all the usual chases and sword fights, and he handles the 3D well", and welcomed Penélope Cruz's character, saying she "brings her Oscar-winning vivacity" and had "lively sexual tension" with Depp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', Rick Groen found the action scenes to range from "merely competent to tritely cluttered", but he was pleased with the overall result, calling McShane a "fresh villain" whose "stentorian tones are welcome anywhere".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/movies/pirates-of-the-caribbean-4-ahoy-me-hearties-theres-treasure-amid-the-bloat/article2028649/ |title=Pirates of the Caribbean 4: Ahoy me hearties, there's treasure amid the bloat |first=Rick |last=Groen |date=May 20, 2011 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |accessdate=August 1, 2011 |location=Toronto |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822144845/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/movies/pirates-of-the-caribbean-4-ahoy-me-hearties-theres-treasure-amid-the-bloat/article2028649/ |archivedate=August 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'s'' Andrew Barker considered the film derivative, but accessible. "It has nary an original idea and still doesn't make much sense, but it's lost all pretensions that it should". He praised Geoffrey Rush, stating that he "not only gets the funniest lines and reaction shots, but also starts to siphon away much of the roguish charm that used to be Depp's stock and trade."&lt;ref name="Barker"/&gt;

'''Radio Twist''' is the first and only nationally syndicated gay-friendly radio show on the FM dial.  Debuting in January 2006, Twist was billed as a show specifically aimed at the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender ([[LGBT]]) audience and promised to be "radio with a twist."  Airing on 16 Pop and Adult Contemporary radio stations nationwide, the hosts also make it a point to include the "straight" listener every week.

==Hosts==
Twist has a novel hosting arrangement - four hosts in four cities. However, despite coming from four cities, the show broadcasts from a powerful transmitter in [[Daly City, California]]. The show's production also takes place there.

New York - [[Ben Harvey (American radio personality)|Ben Harvey]].  Harvey is best known for being the evening jock on 92.3 K-Rock [[WNYL (FM)|WXRK]] in New York City.  He has also worked for Y100 [[Y-Rock On XPN|WPLY]] in Philadelphia and was a TV correspondent for [[Here! TV]], the gay and lesbian cable network.

Atlanta - [[Melissa Carter]].  Carter is an "out" lesbian on Q100 [[WWWQ]]'s morning show.  She hails from Atlanta, adding an interesting sound to the show.

Los Angeles - [[Dennis Hensley]].  Dennis has written several books and writes for many magazines, including [[Entertainment Weekly]] and [[GQ]].  He's been described as a "Hollywood Insider" and was even featured as one of [[Kathy Griffin]]'s "main gays" in season one of her Bravo series.

==Show programming==
'''Famous Friend''' - Celebrities, both gay and "gay-friendly," stop by the studios and chat with the hosts.  So far Twist has had Famous Friends including [[Beyoncé]], [[Anthony Kiedis]], [[Hilary Duff]], [[Peyton Manning]], [[Sarah Jessica Parker]], [[Harry Connick, Jr.]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], [[Janet Jackson]], and [[Eric McCormack]].

'''Twist LDDs''' - If [[Casey Kasem]] were gay, this is what Long Distance Dedications would sound like!  It's a gay spin on a classic radio staple.

'''Big Gay 7''' - Every week Ben, Melissa, and Dennis count down the "Big Gay 5," what the show calls the "biggest hits in 'Gayville, USA'" as decided by the Twist listeners.

'''You're Talking about it So We're Talking about it''' - Melissa runs down the headlines in gay &amp; lesbian news, while Ben and Dennis pipe in with sometimes snarky and sometimes thoughtful comments.

'''Too Much Information''' - Dennis serves up the latest celebrity dish every week in his gossiplicious installment of TMI.

==Cancellation==

Radio with a Twist was canceled on Wednesday November 26, 2008 or as many affiliates are saying, put on an indefinite Hiatus due to economic reasons. The reason cited was that local affiliates could no longer afford to air it weeknights from Midnight - 2am. It was replaced on an interim basis by most stations extending their overnight DJ's shift by 2 hours. Beginning Tuesday February 17, 2009 [[The Billy Bush Show!]] will replace it permanently at an earlier time with an extra hour from 9pm - Midnight, thus shortening the PM DJ shift to 2 hours in order to cut costs, and keeping the over night DJ's shift extended to 6 hours permanently. It aired in the top sixteen markets across the United States. Its flagship station [[WPLJ]] in New York was the first to pull out.

There is a web petition as well as information sign up sheet on Radio with a Twist's home page and even a [[Facebook]] group with the hopes that at some point in 2009 it will relaunch. No word as to how, when, or where and even what format the relaunch will happen. With the premier of The Billy Bush Show! however it is not likely that Radio with a Twist will be back any time soon. To sign up for more information visit the website listed below.

The 16 stations are listed on Twist's official web site, [http://www.radiotwist.net].

'''''[[Rayman Raving Rabbids]]''''' is a [[platform game|platform]] [[video game]] published and developed by [[Ubisoft]] for the [[Game Boy Advance]] and [[Nintendo DS]] [[handheld game console|handheld]] [[video game console]]s. It was also released on the [[Wii]], [[PlayStation 2]], and [[Xbox 360]] video game consoles, as well as the [[Microsoft Windows|PC]]. Unlike these versions which focus on mini-games, the handheld versions are more similar to traditional Rayman platformers.

==Characters==
{{main|Rayman (character)}}

Rayman:
Rayman is the main character in this game and Ubisoft's mascot. He has been captured by the insane bunnies and must take part in all the Rabbids' challenges so they are entertained. Eventually he collects 100 trophies and gets to fight the Rabbids' ultimate commander: the Rabble Droid! Note that in this game, his in-game model is the same one that was used in Rayman 2: The Great Escape/Rayman DS.

Rabbids:
The Rabbids are the antagonists of the game and have captured Rayman. They have put him in a gladiator-styled arena where he must take part in all their challenges in order to face up to the Rabble Droid. They are completely insane and would do ''literally'' anything to stop Rayman.

==Game Boy Advance==
'''''[[Rayman Raving Rabbids]]''''' for the [[Game Boy Advance]] is a [[platform game|platforming]] [[video game]], unlike the console versions which are trial-based. It features characters and elements from previous Rayman games which are not present in the console versions of Raving Rabbids.

===Plot===
The game begins with Rayman taking a nap, only to be captured by insane bunnies who lock him up in a cell. When Rayman comes to his senses, he notices his hands are missing. With Murfy's help, he retrieves his hands and escapes the prison.

Soon, Rayman's fairy friend Ly appears and tells him about the bunnies. According to her, they used to live happily and acted innocently. Their kind nature led other creatures to make fun of them and always give them a hard time. The bunnies then fled underground, and have only now resurfaced to have their revenge against everyone. Rayman is the world's only hope to stop them.

===Gameplay===
The gameplay is similar to the original [[Rayman (video game)|Rayman side-scrolling game]], however Rayman loses his 'adventurous' music. The game also uses the concept of the cancelled Rayman 4 prototype. 

==Nintendo DS==
'''''[[Rayman Raving Rabbids]]''''' is a platform and party [[video game]] for the [[Nintendo DS]]. It was released on March 6, 2007.  The game is not only a platform like the Game Boy Advance version but also a party game like the console versions.

===Plot===
While taking a quiet walk in the forest one day, Rayman is captured by The Rabbids. They have decided to invade our world, and now Rayman is their toy, a prisoner [[gladiator]] to entertain them.

Rayman's only chance at freedom is to face the Rabbid Droid, but to do that, he must win enough trophies and fight other champions. The version's plot is based on the console versions.

===Gameplay===
This game has five worlds: Beach, Forest, Jungle, Factory and Ice. The Beach world is more of a tutorial, and the Ice world only has two levels, each one a boss level. Nearly all the levels are set out like this: Get through the platforming part, beat the minigame and finally the ultimate challenge test. The platforming parts are like most other Rayman games, where you have to follow the path, beating enemies and collecting items.

The final challenge of each level is usually a game where Rayman is running forward of his own accord. Using your costumes of Earth, Fire, Ice and Wind, you must interact with obstacles to help Rayman get through alive and escape from the bunnies spaceship that is chasing him. On your way, you must collect all the trophies of that level in one go. There are 100 trophies in the entire game.

Also, there are three Ray Gear challenges in which you must avoid enemies fire and destroy the giant. Fish Creature. These are timed, as if you are on the challenge for too long, a counter will start counting down to how long you have left.

In 1898 she married Alfred Bascom who was of [[French Canadian]] ancestry but born in the United States. About 1905, Rose joined the circus life and became a lion tamer. It is reported that she was clawed by a lion resulting in an infection that led to her untimely death around the year of 1915. She left behind her husband and their young daughter Agnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cmich.edu/library/clarke/ResearchResources/Michigan_Material_Statewide/Circuses_and_Carnivals/Pages/Lion-Tamers.aspx|title=Lion Tamers - Central Michigan University|work=cmich.edu|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history of Cuban television 1950–1959==
Television arrived in Cuba on October 25, 1950.{{sfn|Salwen|1994}} In the 1940s, Cuba's two largest radio stations, [[CMQ (Cuba)|CMQ]] and [[RHC-Cadena Azul]], announced they would soon start broadcasting television. Since building TV stations and broadcast networks from scratch was extremely expensive and complex, it took longer than expected.

They were both beaten to the air by the tiny radio station, Union Radio. Gaspar Pumarejo, owner of Union Radio, built the new station in the Havana home and garage of a family named [[Goar Mestre|Mestre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=El rey de la TV: Goar Mestre y la pelea entre gobiernos y medios latinoamericanos, de Fidel Castro a Juan Perón |author= Pablo Sirvén |location=Buenos Aires |publisher= {{illm|Editorial Sudamericana|es}} |year= 2013 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2SQBAgAAQBAJ |language=es |isbn=9789500745345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pumarejo set the inauguration of his TV station for October 24, 1950, which was Journalists Day in Cuba.{{sfn|Salwen|1994}} After honoring the journalist, Cuba's President [[Carlos Prío Socarrás]] was shown mugging it up for the camera and playing the role of cameraman. After this event Union Radio's slogan became "Union Radio, primera en television, primera en popularidad" ("Union Radio, first in television, first in popularity"). Union Radio was quickly followed by CMQ, which began broadcasting December 18, 1950.{{sfn|Salwen|1994}}

===Variety of shows===
One of the first shows broadcast was coverage of Cuban Winter League baseball games.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In late October, the station carried the  first of what would be regular Cuban Winter League Baseball Games.  A crew drove to the stadium in a remote-control truck. The broadcasts were beamed to the Mestre's house by microwave, where they were rebroadcast. Cameramen were positioned at first base and home plate. The station's third  camera remained in the house until newsman Alberto Gandero finished his newscast. After the newscast, the third camera was carried to the stadium by taxi and positioned near third base."{{sfn|Salwen|1994}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Soap operas ("[[telenovela]]s"), news, cooking shows, and comedy groups were shown. After Union Radio TV went on the air, Cuban demand for television sets soared. Luckily Cuban broadcasting coincided with a glut of sets in the US market.  Despite the high cost, ranging $350 for a 16" set to $2,000 for a 30" set, the Cuban government's Imports and Exports Analysis Agency estimated that Cubans had imported more than 100,000 television receivers by 1952.{{sfn|Salwen|1994}}

===Social and political aspects===
From its inception, Cuban television played a huge part in the social and political fiber of Cubans. Extensive discussions about television began to unfold in the radio and entertainment sections of Cuban newspapers and magazines in the year leading up to October 14, 1950, the day Union Radio TV became the first television station to broadcast in Havana.{{sfn|Rivero|2007}} Critics believed that US television set a level of excellence that they wanted to uphold. They believed the medium's primary purpose in Cuba would be to enhance the "high culture" education of the Cuban citizen.{{sfn|Rivero|2007}}

===Censorship under Batista===
On March 10, 1952 following [[Fulgencio Batista]]'s successful coup, he sent for representatives of the media and imposed censorship. Though it was supposed to be temporary it wasn't until Journalists' Day, October 24, 1953 that the censorship was supposedly lifted. In truth the censorship became even harsher after [[Fidel Castro]]'s July 26, 1953 attack on [[Moncada Barracks]]. Stations could be fined or shut down for various infractions. On March 14, 1953, CMCH-Radio Cadena Habana permitted a criticism of the coup. The station was immediately occupied by government soldiers.{{sfn|Salwen|1994}}

In true Cuban fashion the media learned to operate within the parameters of the censorship. In late 1957, Circuito Nacional Cubano, a station purported to be secretly owned by Batista, broadcast a fictional program called "El Dictador De Valle Azul."  It starred Rolando Leyva as the rebel leader Taguary, who, with his group of men, roamed the Blue Valley and helped the people fight the valley's evil dictator in each episode. The comparisons with the dictator Batista and the rebel leader Castro were unmistakable. The government's failure to recognize the satire only made it appear inept as well as tyrannical.{{sfn|Salwen|1994}}

Moral censorship also increased under Batista. There was a move towards more family friendly broadcasts and less sexually provocative variety shows. In particular these were the rumba and mambo-inspired dances and more specifically the female dancers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

On March 19, 1958 - Gaspar Pumarejo once more made history at the inauguration of TELECOLOR S.A., on Channel 12, transmitting up to 16 hours a day of color programming. It was a commercial television station with studios located in the brand new and central Hotel Habana Hilton - now Habana Libre, which used the US NTSC system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1848">'''Television in [[Morocco]]'''. Terrestrial television viewing was estimated at 20% of total television households in 2011. [[IPTV]] is offered by [[Maroc Telecom]]. Digital terrestrial television is gradually spreading, with 41 national and foreign channels. The national broadcaster [[SNRT]] aims to complete digital switchover by 2015.&lt;ref name=amo12&gt;{{cite web|title=Arab Media Outlook 2011-2015|url=http://www.arabmediaforum.ae/userfiles/EnglishAMO.pdf|pages=149–151|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morocco has nine domestic free-to-air channels: seven government owned, one privately owned, and one of mixed ownership. [[2M TV]] started out as the first private terrestrial channel in Morocco, in 1989, however it became a mixed ownership channel as 70% of its capital was bought by the government. It is by far the most watched channel in Morocco, cited by 84% of TV viewers. [[Medi1 TV]] (formerly Medi 1 Sat) is the privately owned channel, although 50% of its shares are owned by the public sector. The other seven channels are all government-owned.&lt;ref name="amo12"/&gt;

[[beIN SPORTS (Arabic)|beIN SPORTS]] is the most popular pay-TV bouquet in Morocco, accounting for around 65% of the local pay-TV market.&lt;ref name="amo12"/&gt;

'''''The 11th Hour''''' is a 1995 [[interactive movie]] [[puzzle adventure game]] with a [[horror fiction|horror]] setting. It is the sequel to the 1993 game ''[[The 7th Guest]]''.

==Plot==
The story opens 60 years after the events of ''The 7th Guest''. It is now 1995, and the player assumes the role of Carl Denning, an [[investigative reporter]] for the television series "Case Unsolved". Robin Morales, his producer and lover, mysteriously vanished three weeks prior in Harley-on-the-Hudson, [[New York (state)|New York]]. She was  investigating a series of grisly murders and disappearances that had plagued the otherwise sleepy upstate town over the last few months. Denning's only solid lead is a [[portable computer]] called the GameBook delivered with only a postmark from Harley. When booted, the GameBook displays Robin's plea to help her escape.

The story then flashes back to the beginning of Robin's investigation. She interviews Eileen Wiley, the only person known to have survived an encounter with Henry Stauf's mansion. Eileen confirms she lost her hand that night, claiming it had been bitten off by a dog, but offers no other meaningful details of the encounter.

Suspicious of Eileen's story, Robin interviews Dr. Thornton, who treated Eileen that night. Though the doctor appears to believe Eileen about the dog, the interview proves fruitful as Dr. Thornton reveals that Eileen was not alone that night; her friend Samantha Ford was with her in the house those 18 years ago. Samantha's family used its considerable influence to keep her involvement out of the papers. He also reveals that Samantha has been [[paralyzed]] from the waist down ever since the girls' encounter.

Robin attempts to interview Samantha, but their meeting is adversarial. Samantha's forceful denials convince Robin that the women are not telling the truth about their encounter. Samantha confirms Robin's suspicions later that evening when she visit's Robin's motel room and shares her story. Samantha claims that during their encounter with the house, something supernatural held the girls down and raped them, then let them go. Samantha had an illegal [[abortion]] that resulted in her paralysis, but Eileen had a daughter, Marie. Samantha claims there was always something sinister about the child and believes that all hell let loose around Marie's 18th birthday, that Marie is the mansion's offspring, and that Marie is responsible for the murders and disappearances. Robin confronts Eileen with the story, and Eileen denies everything. Eileen then challenges Robin to go to the house herself. After Robin leaves, it's revealed that Marie was listening to the entire conversation.

Desperate to keep her secret from getting out, Marie commands her lover Chuck to murder Robin. He initially resists, worried about the media attention a famous disappearance would bring, and Marie challenges him to say "no" to Stauf. He enters Robin's hotel and stabs someone sleeping in bed, but it's revealed that he actually stabbed the police chief who had a budding romance with Robin. Unable to remove the knife, he takes the body to Stauf's mansion, where he is pulled inside and killed for his mistake.

Robin comes to the house soon after and fatefully enters as Samantha watches remotely, somehow having hacked into Stauf's surveillance. As Robin moves through the house, it breaks her by systematically confronting her with uncomfortable truths about her past. He eventually wins her over by enticing her with her own [[television network]].

The story then picks up with Carl in the mansion. He follows Robin's cries upstairs where he meets Stauf, who is presiding over a [[game show]] called "Let’s Make a Real Deal" (a parody of [[Let's Make a Deal]]). Stauf explains that Carl must choose to open one of the doors, then offers Carl $600. Carl can keep it, or he can pay $200 and reveal what's behind one of the three doors in front of him. He pays to reveal door number two, which turns out to be a large TV. Next, he pays door number one, which is Marie. As Stauf tempts Carl with Marie's sexual prowess, Samantha hacks into the TV, warning him not to give in to temptation as Stauf mocks her paralysis. Finally, Carl pays to reveal door number three, which is Robin. She expresses her love for Carl, pleading with him to choose her. Samantha urges Carl to choose her, revealing that this will end Stauf forever and that choosing either of the others will doom him. The game turns Carl's choice over to the player, which reveals one of three endings:

* '''Carl chooses Samantha:''' reaching out his hand to touch Samantha’s on the TV. A moment later, he walks through Samantha’s front door, and they watch the house burn to the ground on her monitors. Carl expresses regret about Robin, but Samantha laments that Robin was lost the moment she said "yes" to Stauf.
* '''Carl chooses Robin:''' Carl and Robin embrace as Samantha looks on in disappointment. The story then flashes forward weeks later, where Robin is in Carl's living room watching the news of his body being found in the [[Hudson River]]. The newscaster reports that he disappeared on his honeymoon in Harley-on-the-Hudson after marrying Robin, who is the new president of the Stauf Broadcasting System.
* '''Carl chooses Marie:''' as Samantha and Robin look on, Carl gives in to Marie's temptations. Marie leads him through a door to another room, and as the two have sex, Marie morphs into Stauf. The Stauf/Marie hybrid then taunts Carl while eating cooked ribs, which they claim to be his.

==Gameplay==
Overall, the gameplay is similar to its predecessor's with the same [[Puzzle video game|puzzle]]-based gameplay structure, but with the additional element of a [[treasure hunt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Next Wave: The 11th Hour |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=78|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=January 1996|pages=144–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
Although Trilobyte stated in 1993—even before ''The 7th Guest''{{'}}s became available—that it planned to release ''The 11th Hour'' by October of that year,&lt;ref name="cgw199304"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&amp;pub=2&amp;id=105 |title=The Rumor Bag |work=Computer Gaming World |date=April 1993 |accessdate=6 July 2014 |pages=88 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702235842/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&amp;pub=2&amp;id=105 |archivedate=2 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was very late to market and failed to meet sales expectations upon its release.&lt;ref name="GP_interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/btg-tri/part3-5.html |title=Haunted Glory: The Rise and Fall of Trilobyte |last=Keighley |first=Geoff |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=22 September 1999 |accessdate=28 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212102634/http://www.gamespot.com/features/btg-tri/part3-5.html |archivedate=12 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early into its development, a port to the [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]] was planned, and a release date of May 1994 was announced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Shipping in May|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=58|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1994|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was pushed back to March 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=The 11th Hour: The Sequel to the 7th Guest|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=68 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=March 1995|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately cancelled.

Trilobyte had confirmed that the game would be released on both the [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]] platforms. The release for iOS was scheduled for Q2/Q3 2011, but in March 2012 Trilobyte postponed the release indefinitely due to "serious technical challenges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trilobytegames.com/11thHour.html |title=The 11th Hour |date=27 March 2012 |accessdate=15 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327232711/http://www.trilobytegames.com/11thHour.html |archivedate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, ''The 7th Guest: Book of Secrets'' application for iOS was renamed to just ''Book of Secrets'', and was updated to include a walkthrough and script for ''The 11th Hour'', just as it already had for ''7th Guest''.

In 2012, ''The 11th Hour'' was re-released for Windows, as a download from [[DotEmu]] and [[GOG.com]].&lt;ref name="7thdotemu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dotemu.com/en/download-game/2788/the-7th-guest |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025085206/http://www.dotemu.com/en/download-game/2788/the-7th-guest |archivedate=2012-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="11dotemu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dotemu.com/en/download-game/2790/the-11th-hour |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107015316/http://www.dotemu.com/en/download-game/2790/the-11th-hour |archivedate=2012-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gog.com/en/news/trilobyte_games_joins_list_of_gog_com_partners |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430071617/http://www.gog.com/en/news/trilobyte_games_joins_list_of_gog_com_partners |archivedate=2012-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 18, 2013, it was re-released again on [[Steam (software)|Steam]], as part of a collaboration between Trilobyte and [[Night Dive Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameranx.com/updates/id/18210/article/trilobyte-games-add-classics-the-7th-guest-and-the-11th-hour-to-steam/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925095235/http://www.gameranx.com/updates/id/18210/article/trilobyte-games-add-classics-the-7th-guest-and-the-11th-hour-to-steam/ |archivedate=2015-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The makers of the game originally intended for it to contain more adult content in its [[cut scenes]]; the script for the game (published as part of a [[walk-through]] guide) included several [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R-rated]] sex scenes. Rumors immediately surfaced that an "uncut" version of ''11th Hour'' existed, leading to the game makers announcing that the R-rated sequences, though planned, were never filmed.

Many of the videos that were filmed for the game used [[Location shooting|location shooting]]; the fifth scene utilised a [[Chroma key|blue screen]] incorporating a neutral blue drape. Macintosh Premier was used to convert the capture film into digitized images and videos. A program called 'Wavelet' was used to compress the game's videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |date=August 1994 |title=CD-ROM Today 04 |journal= |location= |author= |publisher=[[Future Publishing]] |issue=4 |page=77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was developed by [[Trilobyte (company)|Trilobyte]] and used a later version of the Groovie [[game engine|graphic engine]] than that used by ''The 7th Guest''.&lt;ref name=Manual&gt;{{cite book |date=1995 |title=Game Manual|page=35|quote=The 11th Hour: Sequel to the 7th Guest was created using the Groovie authoring system from Trilobyte Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The 11th Hour'' also features the music of [[George Sanger (musician)|George "The Fat Man" Sanger]] and Team Fat.

Reviews of the game upon initial release were mixed. After extensively praising the game's graphics, challenging puzzles, storyline, and atmosphere, as well as the lower amount of gratuitous gore when compared to ''The 7th Guest'', a reviewer for ''Maximum'' concluded "However, the bottom line is that ''11th Hour'' is basically a more advanced version of ''7th Guest''."&lt;ref name="Max3"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Maximum Reviews: 11th Hour|magazine=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=3 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=January 1996|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' also found the game much too similar to its predecessor, particularly as he considered the entire genre of puzzle adventures to be a waste of time. He also criticized that the game has long load times except when running on high-end computers.&lt;ref name="NGen16"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first= |title=About Time |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=16|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=April 1996|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arinn Dembo]] reviewed the game for [[Computer Gaming World]].&lt;ref name="CGW140"&gt;Dembo, Arinn; ''This Old House: The Sequel to 7th Guest Strikes Perilously Close to Midnight'', p. 128.

'''''The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)''''' is a 1988 book by "The Timelords" ([[Bill Drummond]] and [[Jimmy Cauty]]), better known as [[The KLF]]. It is a step by step guide to achieving a No.1 single with no money or musical skills, and a case study of the duo's UK [[Novelty song|novelty pop]] No. 1 "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]".

==How to have a number one==
The advice dispensed by The Manual includes: "Firstly, you must be [[wiktionary:skint|skint]] and on [[Jobseeker's Allowance|the dole]]. Anybody with a proper job or tied up with full time education will not have the time to devote to see it through... Being on the dole gives you a clearer perspective on how much of society is run... having no money sharpens the wits. Forces you never to make the wrong decision. There is no safety net to catch you when you fall." and "If you are already a musician stop playing your instrument. Even better, sell the junk." The book also foretells its own imminent irrelevance, The Timelords admitting that they are writing "a book that will be completely redundant within twelve months. An obsolete &lt;!-- see MOS:PMC concerning dialectical "artifact" spelling --&gt; artefact. Its only use being a bit of a social history that records the aspirations of a certain strata {{sic}} in British society in the late eighties..."

The book is prophetic when it comes to recording technology: "It's obvious that in a very short space of time the Japanese will have delivered the technology and then brought the price of it down so that you can do the whole thing at home. Then you will be able to sod off all that crap about going into studios."&lt;!-- is this too long? --&gt;

Bill Drummond explained his motivations in an interview: "It was an excuse to say a lot of things I wanted to say about how the industry worked. It was an excuse to go out and say to people all they can say to themselves: If you want to do something, go and do it! Don't wait to be asked, don't wait for a record company to come and want to sign you or a management company. Just go and do it. Also, it was saying: If you wanna have number one...you can have it. It won't make you rich, it won't make you happy, but you can have it."&lt;ref name="Bomlagadafshipoing"&gt;Transcript of a Bill Drummond interview on "Bomlagadafshipoing" (Norwegian national radio house-music show), September 1991 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=521 link]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and reach==
The English-language version of ''The Manual'' has had at least 3 print runs (see ISBNs below), being reissued in 1989 and—with a new foreword by Drummond—in 1998. The book has also been translated into German, and was released as an [[audiobook]] (read by Bela B., drummer of the punk band [[Die Ärzte]]) in Germany in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;''The KLF, Das Handbuch, Der schnelle Weg zum Nr. 1 Hit'', 2 audio CDs read by Bela B. Universal Music, 2003. {{ISBN|3-8291-1352-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with Drummond voicing the foreword, a motivational piece about reaching out for one's dreams ''today''—"tomorrow is always too late". In 2010, the book was published in [[Czech language|Czech]].&lt;ref&gt;'' KLF&amp;nbsp;– Manual (Jak se dostat na vrchol hitparady)'', published in 2010 by J. Brezina and Jakub Jandourek, Czech republic. {{ISBN|978-80-254-6529-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian Eurotrash band [[Edelweiss (band)|Edelweiss]] took the book as a primary influence: they read the book, borrowed [[ABBA]]'s "[[SOS (ABBA song)|SOS]]", and sold five million copies worldwide with "Bring Me Edelweiss".&lt;ref&gt;Longmire, E. "KLF Is Going to Rock You" ''X Magazine'', July 1991 ([http://cardhouse.com/x07/klf.html link])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reighley, K.B. "Hear No Evil", ''[[Seattle Weekly]]'', 26 May 1999 ([http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/9921/two-reighley.php link] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303211002/http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/9921/two-reighley.php |date=2016-03-03 }})&lt;/ref&gt; It also proved to be an influence on 2000s British girl group [[The Pipettes]] who formed after reading the book in order to explore "the idea of being a pop machine."&lt;ref&gt;Barton, Laura. "Leaders of the pack", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 1 November 2006 ([http://music.guardian.co.uk/pop/story/0,,1936461,00.html link])&lt;/ref&gt;

In the liner photographs of the [[Chumbawamba]] album ''[[Readymades (album)|Readymades]]'', Boff Whalley is seen to be reading a copy of The Manual. It is a reference to Chumbawamba's earlier success with their hit single, "[[Tubthumping]]".{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

[[Jamie Reynolds]] of [[Klaxons (English band)|Klaxons]] admitted in an interview to reading ''The Manual'' and stated that he "took direct instructions from it.... Get yourself a studio, get a groove going, sing some absolute nonsense over the top, put a [[breakbeat]] behind it, and you're away! That's what I did! That's genuinely it. I read that, I noted down the golden rules of pop, and applied that to what we're doing and made sure that that always applies to everything we do. That way, we always come out with a sort of catchy hit number."&lt;ref&gt;Sherburne, Philip. "ACKNOWLEDGE, AGREE AND REPEAT (sic)", , 24 January 2007 ([http://phs.abstractdynamics.org/2007/01/the_easy_way.html link]) {{Unreliable source?|date=July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7634">The word ''' Titling''', in the performing arts (opera, drama, audiovisual productions), defines the work of linguistic mediation encompassing [[subtitling]] and [[surtitling]].

==History==
Subtitling developed starting from 1917, during the silent film era, whereas surtitling has been used in the live performing arts since 1983 (at the dawning of digital systems).&lt;br /&gt;
With the appearance of new information systems, which opened the door to [[multilingual titling]] ([[DVD]] was launched on the market in 1986) terminological debate started, too.&lt;br /&gt;
In the audiovisual system, even when more than one language was used, subtitles maintained their position unchanged for many years. The newest software technologies for mobile devices, which came out as an alternative to subtitling in cinemas, or the possibilities opened up by head-mounted displays, such as subtitle glasses, have made a revision of the technical terminology necessary also in the field of those performing arts that are reproducible on electronic devices.&lt;br /&gt;
Even more so, in the live performing arts, the presence of multilingual options on custom individual devices ([[Santa Fe Opera]], 1998)&lt;ref name="(Santa Fe Opera, 1998)"&gt;[[Figaro Systems]] introduced in 1998 at Santa Fe Opera a custom multilingual display system recalling the aircraft video display units; this system has been lately adopted, through different companies, by some of the most prominent international theatres, such as Copenhagen, Milan, Moscow, Muscat, New York, Oslo.&lt;/ref&gt; or on mobile consumer devices (Teatro del [[Maggio Musicale Fiorentino]], 2011) &lt;ref name="(Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, 2011)"&gt;OperaVoice, in the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino Theatre’s season 2011-2012, developed a wireless multilingual transmission system which is to use mobile consumer devices owned by the audience (smartphones and tablets), and is also interfaceable with projected surtitles.&lt;/ref&gt; or on hybrid solutions ([[Royal Opera House Muscat]], 2012),&lt;ref name="(Royal Opera House Muscat, 2012)"&gt;[[Radio Marconi]], in 2011-2012, realized for the Royal Opera House Muscat the most advanced system of custom multilingual interactive displays integrated to surtitles on LED panel.&lt;/ref&gt; makes the spatial connotation of the term "sur-titles" inappropriate.

==Terminology==
In both cases (performing arts that are reproducible on electronic devices and live performing arts), for a scientific approach the term "titling", broader and all-embracing, is preferable to define the work of linguistic mediation, without specifying whether the visualization is to be above (sur-titles) or below (sub-titles).&lt;ref name=" not specifying if the visualization is to be above (sur-titles) or below (sub-titles)"&gt;This is also recommended in: FREDDI M. e LURAGHI S., ''Titling for the Opera House: a Test Case for Universals of Translations? '' in INCALCATERRA McLOUGHLIN L., eds., ''Audiovisual Translation'', Peter Lang, Bern-Berlin-New York 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[game design]], '''variation''' is the process whereby the [[game community|community]] of players, rather than any officiating authority, adapts the rules for informal play. If a variant becomes popular, it will often be published in a rules document like ''[[Edmund Hoyle|Hoyle]]'s [[Rules of Games]]''. It may supplant the original game. For example, [[Hearts (game)|Hearts]] is usually played with a variation whereby the [[Playing card|Jack of Diamonds]] carries a -10 (desired, since points are penalty) point value, in a variant known as "[[Omnibus hearts]]".

Villa del Cine is part of the [[Ministry of Popular Power for Culture]] and receives funding through its National Autonomous Center of Film (CNAC). According to the pro-Chávez website [[Venezuelanalysis.com]], Villa del Cine is an incentive to increase film production and to enable filmmakers access to materials, equipment and facilities, not just to provide funding.&lt;ref name=RevolutionaryCinema/&gt; In 2006, the Venezuelan government set up a sister institution, ''Distribuidora Nacional de Cine Amazonia Films'', (Amazonia Films)&lt;ref name=Entes/&gt; as an alternative to commercial networks. Amazonia Films distributes the projects created by Villa del Cine and has since acquired films from South America as well as Europe and Asia for the local market.&lt;ref name=RevolutionaryCinema/&gt;

As of 2012, the president of Villa del Cine is filmmaker José Antonio Varela&lt;ref name=Organizativa&gt;{{es icon}}  [http://www.villadelcine.gob.ve/index.php/quienes-somos/estructura-organizativa Estructura Organizativa.] Gobierno Bolivariano de Venezuela, Ministerio de Poder Popular para la Cultura.

Retrieved on 14 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; President Chávez said the aim of Villa del Cine is to counter the lack of an alternative media&lt;ref name=VenezuelanCinemaIngham/&gt; and to “stimulate, develop, and consolidate the national cinema industry to encourage the Venezuelan people to draw nearer to their values and idiosyncrasies.” &lt;ref name=EspacioParaLaCreacion/&gt; At the inauguration of Villa del Cine, Chávez said, "They [Hollywood] inoculate us with messages that have nothing to do with our traditions." Although he said some Hollywood films are "enjoyable", he criticized their portrayal of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] as "savage."&lt;ref name=RevolutionaryCinema&gt;Kozloff, Nikolas.

An adviser to the government said, "For a country like Venezuela, it's really the only way to build a cinema infrastructure," noting that several countries, such as Mexico and Brazil, had taken the same route.&lt;ref name=MovieMogel&gt;Padgett, Tim, and Kathie Klarreich.

Francisco Sesto, a former minister of culture who also made early contributions to the creation of audio-visual [[cooperatives]] in Venezuela, said the aim of Villa del Cine is "the transformation of the state and how people might become participants in the development of film through their own art".&lt;ref name=RevolutionaryCinema/&gt;

==Organization and facilities==
Villa del Cine employed 130 as of 2007, is spread over {{convert|2400|m2|sqft|sp=us}}, and includes soundproofed studios equipped with lighting, audio and video equipment, casting and wardrobe facilities, and post-production while being stocked with modern digital film equipment.&lt;ref name="Humberto"&gt;Márquez, Humberto.

The [[Motion Picture Association of America]] was critical of some of these moves.&lt;ref name=DeUnaPolitica/&gt;&lt;ref name=LaysDownLaw/&gt;

==Projects==
According to Villa del Cine's president, in the four years since its founding the organization made 26 documentary and fictional films and supported even more independent films, with 12 productions scheduled for 2011.&lt;ref name=LaVillaEU&gt;{{es icon}} [http://espectaculos.eluniversal.com/2010/08/16/til_ava_la-villa-del-cine-pr_16A4343571.shtml "La Villa del Cine promete 12 películas para 2011".] ''[[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]]''. 16 August 2010.

Así lo afirma su presidente, José Antonio Varela, en una nota de prensa del organismo colocada en el site del Ministerio de la Cultura."&lt;/ref&gt; Villa del Cine has filmed in all 24 Venezuelan states.&lt;ref name=RevolutionaryCinema/&gt; 

Notable projects funded by the new studio are the story of [[Francisco de Miranda]]—a revolutionary who played a key part in events leading to the [[Venezuelan War of Independence]] from Spain, which was released in 400 movie theatres and beat [[Superman Returns]] to the top of the box office in Venezuela;&lt;ref name="Humberto"/&gt; actor and activist [[Danny Glover|Danny Glover's]] directorial debut about [[Toussaint Louverture]]—leader of the [[Haitian Revolution]]; and a short film about [[Simon Bolivar]].&lt;ref name=VenezuelanCinemaIngham&gt;Ingham, James.

Retrieved 20 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There has been controversy over the funding Glover has received for his biopic. Opponents say that the funding for the project outweighs the state budget for domestic films from 2003 to 2008 and directors Thaelman Urgelles, and the L.A.-based [[Jonathan Jakubowicz]], said that the quantity allocated to Glover's project was "excessive". The Culture Minister, defended the move since the funding did not come from Villa del Cine's standard funds but from what he called an "additional credit". He added that the funding will not be leaving the country, but will create jobs and provide valuable experience to the relatively youthful studios.&lt;ref name=RevolutionaryCinema/&gt;

One of the most well known projects produced by Villa del Cine is the film ''[[La Clase (film)|La Clase]]'' (The [Social] Class). Directed by José Antonio Varela in 2007, it is a romantic drama which contrasts the way of life between the upper and working classes. Varela became the President of Villa del Cine in March 2010, three years after the release of ''La Clase''.&lt;ref name="Jump Cut"&gt;Vázquez, Mercedes.

==Visits by Hollywood filmmakers and actors==
Several politically [[progressivism|progressive]] Hollywood filmmakers and actors have visited Villa del Cine. They include actor and director [[Tim Robbins]] and the actors [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Danny Glover]] and [[Sean Penn]]. Robbins praised Villa del Cine for its support of film directors and is considering a film project in Venezuela.&lt;ref name=RevolutionaryCinema/&gt;

==Analysis==
The [[BBC]] describes Villa del Cine as "a state-of-the-art production house that is changing the face of Venezuelan cinema." Supporters of the project believe that it provides "many people" who could not work in film making before with "an opportunity to work in the industry ..."&lt;ref name=VenezuelanCinemaIngham/&gt; However, it has also been criticized as a "[[propaganda]] factory", according to Nichols and Morse&lt;ref&gt;Nichols and Morse (2010), p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; and independent film makers.&lt;ref name=VenezuelanCinemaIngham/&gt; Chávez said that Villa del Cine would help break the "dictatorship of [[Hollywood]]".&lt;ref name=Ingham&gt;Ingham, James. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7070799.stm "Venezuelan cinema, Chavez style."] BBC News. 1 November 2007. Retrieved 20 August 2010. &lt;/ref&gt; The studios have been controversial with some Venezuelan film makers who fear it may harm independent media. Concern about the ''new'' National Law of Cinematography (2005) governing Villa was also expressed by the Motion Picture Association of America.&lt;ref name=DeUnaPolitica&gt;{{es icon}} Villazana, Libia.

Retrieved 13 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Studio administrators say they are not politically motivated in which films they produce, with executive director Marco Mondarain saying:
"We are looking to make good films, no matter what the script. We really want writers and directors to come to us with their ideas. If they're good, we'll support them." &lt;ref name=VenezuelanCinemaIngham/&gt; 

According to an article published by Jump Cut:&lt;ref name = "Jump Cut"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Villa del Cine offers support to veteran filmmakers like [[Román Chalbaud]] and Luis Alberto Lamata while it enables young filmmakers like Efterpi Charalambidis or Hernán Jabes to make their first projects. The sharp increase in the number of features produced by Villa del Cine over the last years is unquestionable proof that this form of Government support has stimulated media production in the country in terms of the number and variety of films, and it has proven a valuable alternative to the Hollywood and neoliberal models of production.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Luis Girón, CNAC's president as of 2007: "We don't lay out guidelines for a certain kind of film to be produced, we don't push a specific bias; we just want to be shown as we are." Filmmakers unions participated in CNAC's 2007 decision making process.&lt;ref name="Humberto"/&gt; In 2007, Oscar Murat, a project co-ordinator at Villa del Cine stated that politics do not figure in what films are produced. He said that Villa del Cine "received various proposals and of the ones which won commissions, none was linked with politics".&lt;ref name=RevolutionaryCinema/&gt;

Like many [[shounen]] heroes, Goro is very brave and has an innate sense of righteousness, along with his longstanding goal of searching for his missing father.

*{{nihongo|'''Katsura Tenjoin'''|天上院 桂|''Tenjōin Katsura''}}: Kaoru's adopted daughter. She is sweet and affectionate, but she instinctively defends herself with martial arts whenever she feels she is in danger.

==Controversy==
On March 29, 1997, there was an incident involving the episode {{nihongo|"The Mysterious Father"|まぼろしのオヤジ|Maboroshi No Oyaji}} in which four children were taken to hospitals after reportedly watching a scene in the episode with rapidly flashing red and white colors.&lt;ref name="soumu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soumu.go.jp/joho_tsusin/policyreports/english/group/broadcasting/interim_rep.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023122526/http://www.soumu.go.jp/joho_tsusin/policyreports/english/group/broadcasting/interim_rep.html|archivedate=2008-10-23|title=Policy Reports/Study Group/Broadcasting Bureau|date=April 1998|publisher=Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications|accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later broadcasts of this episode were edited so that the flashes were not as fast, unlike the infamous "[[Dennō Senshi Porygon|Electric Soldier Porygon]]" episode of  the [[Pokémon (anime)|''Pokémon'' anime]], which was completely banned.&lt;ref name="yat25"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706152034/http://homepage1.nifty.com/home_aki/yat25.htm|archivedate=20 April 2012|url=http://homepage1.nifty.com/home_aki/yat25.htm|title=『YAT安心!宇宙旅行』第25話を検証する|publisher=TVアニメ資料館|language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar incidents were also reported following the "Pokémon Shock" incident.&lt;ref name="yat25"/&gt;
