'''Albert S. Humphrey''' (2 June 1926&amp;nbsp;– 31 October 2005) was an American business and [[Management consulting|management consultant]] who specialized in organizational management and [[Transformation of culture|cultural change]]. Initially earning degrees in chemical engineering in Illinois, he eventually moved to London.

Humphrey devoleped the [[SWOT analysis]] technique while working for the Stanford Research Institute, now known as [[SRI International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sri.com/sites/default/files/brochures/dec-05.pdf|title=SWOT Analysis for Management Consulting|first=Albert|last=Humphrey|work=SRI Alumni Newsletter|publisher=[[SRI International]]|date=December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; . SWOT is a strategic planning method used to evaluate the Strengths, Weaknesses/Limitations, Opportunities, and Threats involved in a project or in a business venture. The origin of the term SWOT remains obscure.

== Education ==
Albert Humphrey was educated at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], where he graduated with a B.Sc. in [[Chemical engineering|Chemical Engineering]]. After this he gained a master's degree in chemical engineering at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|M.I.T.]] and an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="father"/&gt;

== Career ==
His work at the Stanford Research Institute (now [[SRI International]]) produced a team method for planning which created SOFT analysis and this was developed into [[SWOT analysis]].

One client was [[W.H. Smith]] (1970–1987), which aligned its annual budget to long-range planning. This programme was the first to use the concept of employee involvement in business planning and can be seen as sowing the seeds for the [[Investors in People]] scheme.

While continuing work at Stanford, Humphrey was involved with the team that came up with the Stakeholder Concept, which has often been referenced by business leaders, economists and politicians. This programme became known as TAM ([[Team Action Management]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leader-values.com/content/detail.asp?ContentDetailID=872|title=Leadership Development - Results focused Leadership thinking and practice from around the Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his working life Humphrey acted as consultant to over 100 companies globally. In 2005 he was listed in:&lt;ref name="father"/&gt;

* ''[[Marquis Who's Who#General publications|Who's Who in the World]]''
* [[Debrett's#Debrett's People of Today|Debrett's ''People of Today'']]
* ''Who's Who in the City''
* ''The Directory of Directors''

In 2004 he was listed in the ''[[Marquis Who's Who#General publications|Who's Who in Science and Engineering]]'', 7th Edition (2003–2004).

== Family ==
Albert had four children with his first wife Virginia P. Humphrey. After several years they divorced, Albert moved to London and a decade passed before he met and married Myriam, with whom he had one daughter(Stephanie). They lived together until his death in 2005.

== Death ==
Albert S. Humphrey died on 31 October 2005 at the age of 79.

'''''Arbitrage''''' is a 2012 American [[thriller film|thriller]] [[drama]] film directed by [[Nicholas Jarecki]] and starring [[Richard Gere]], [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Tim Roth]] and [[Brit Marling]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/02/movies/arbitrage-and-the-rich-and-troubled-bad-guy.html "And the Rich Shall Inherit the Woes" "New York Times", 31 August 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Filming began in April 2011 in [[New York City]]. It opened in U.S. theaters in September 2012.

==Plot==
Sixty-year-old magnate Robert Miller ([[Richard Gere]]) manages a [[hedge fund]] with his daughter Brooke ([[Brit Marling]]) and is about to sell it for a handsome profit. However, unbeknownst to his daughter and most of his other employees, he has [[cooking the books|cooked his company's books]] in order to cover an investment loss and avoid being arrested for fraud. One night, while driving with his much younger mistress, Julie Cote ([[Laetitia Casta]]), he begins to doze off and crashes; Julie is killed. An injured Robert leaves the scene and decides to cover up his involvement to prevent the public, his wife Ellen ([[Susan Sarandon]]), and the prospective buyer James Mayfield ([[Graydon Carter]]) from discovering the truth.

Robert calls Jimmy Grant ([[Nate Parker]]), a twenty-three-year-old man from [[Harlem]] with a criminal record whom he helped get off the street in the past, and whose father had been Robert's driver for many years. After being driven home by Grant, Miller drags his injured body into bed at 4:30 am, arousing suspicion in his wife. The next day, he is questioned by police detective Bryer ([[Tim Roth]]). Bryer is keen on arresting Robert for manslaughter and begins to put the pieces together. Brooke discovers the financial irregularities, realizes that she could be implicated and confronts her father.

Jimmy is arrested and placed before a [[grand jury]] but still refuses to admit to helping Miller. Miller once again contemplates turning himself in. Even though Jimmy is about to go to prison, Miller tells Jimmy that investors are depending on him and that waiting for the sale to close before coming forward would serve the greater good. Eventually, the sale is closed, but Robert finds a way to avoid being charged. He proves that Bryer had fabricated evidence. The case against Jimmy is dismissed, and the detective is ordered not to go near him. Robert's wife tries to blackmail him with a separation agreement getting rid of his wealth. When Robert refuses to sign, his wife says that she will tell the police that he got into bed at 4:30 am on the night of the accident, bruised and [[bleeding]] but will tell them that he was there all night if he agrees to sign.

In the final scene, Robert addresses a banquet honoring him for his successful business, with his wife at his side and his daughter introducing him to the audience but their false embrace on the stage signifies that he has lost the respect and admiration of his daughter. As Robert approaches the podium to deliver his speech the screen cuts to black, leaving his decision ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/richard-gere-why-his-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-56736|title=Richard Gere: Why My Cheating 'Arbitrage' Financier Is Like Bill Clinton|first=Steve|last=Pond|work=The Wrap|accessdate=2012-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/arbitrage/user-reviews/Richard+Gere+movie-56UKB42KYADOBOAAAR4ZB23W3Y.html|first=Jeannie|last=M|title=Richard Gere movie|work=Yahoo Movies|date=2012-09-26|accessdate=2012-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bankruptcy remote''' [[company (law)|company]] is a company  within a [[corporate group]] whose [[bankruptcy]] has as little economic impact as possible on other entities within the group. A bankruptcy remote company is often a [[single-purpose entity]].

In practice, due to the concept of [[limited liability]], most companies in developed [[legal system]]s will be ''de facto'' bankruptcy remote from other members of the group (except in limited circumstances where [[creditor]]s are permitted to [[piercing the corporate veil|pierce the corporate veil]]).  However, in financial structuring, references to bankruptcy remoteness usually imply additional steps being taken to protect group members from attendant liability, such as by using an [[orphan structure]] to remove the legal ownership of the bankruptcy remote vehicle from the group, whilst retaining the economic benefits of it.  Such structures are used where the vehicle's activities may give liability to the group as a whole, for example, under certain [[environmental protection]] legislation, or in relation to [[tax]] liabilities in certain countries.

'''Bruno Bonnell''' (born 6 October 1958) is a [[France|French]] businessman. He is co-founder of [[Infogrames Entertainment SA]].

==Career==
He began his career on the [[Thomson SA|Thomson]] [[Thomson TO7|TO7]], one of the earliest French-produced home computers, before founding [[Infogrames]] in June 1983. He founded this company at age 25 with [[Christophe Sapet]] and [[Thomas Schmider]].

He was [[chairman]] and [[chief creative officer]] of the company from 1983 to 5 April 2007. He was also [[chief executive officer]]; a position he held from 1983 until a stockholder vote in 2003 showed a lack of confidence in his management of the company’s debts. He stepped down as CEO of [[Atari]] (while retaining his other two positions in IESA) in 2004 to be replaced by [[James Caparro]], although he took up the position again on a temporary basis when Caparro resigned in June 2005. On 5 September 2006, [[David Pierce (CEO)|David Pierce]] was appointed as new CEO of [[Atari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/730/730521p1.html |title=Games, reviews, previews, nieuws, tips, video's en trailers - IGN Benelux |publisher=Ds.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Bonnell was elected president of the [[Syndicat des Editeurs de Logiciels de Loisirs]] (SELL), a French game developer association. He worked together with French broadcaster [[Canal Plus]] to create the television channel [[Game One]], which was specifically aimed at a gaming audience. Intended as a European channel, Game One broadcast in the [[French language]].

He spearheaded takeovers of many smaller (and a few larger) development studios over the 1980s and 1990s, most notably British development house [[Ocean Software]] and Atari, as well as [[GT Interactive]], [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]], [[Gremlin Graphics]] and [[Hasbro Interactive]]. These companies were integrated into the Infogrames infrastructure. Their brand names were abandoned, with the exception of [[Atari]], which Bonnell felt had value. For this reason Infogrames began using the Atari brand on games published around Christmas 2001 and renamed itself to Atari, Inc. in the US in 2003. Beyond his involvement in Infogrames &amp; Atari, Bonnell is also a shareholder in [[Lyon]]'s soccer team; the [[Olympique Lyonnais]].

On 5 April 2007, he resigned from his positions at [[Atari]] and [[Infogrames]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pages/news/story.php?sid%3D6168631%26part%3Drss%26subj%3D6168631 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204637/http://www.gamespot.com/pages/news/story.php?sid=6168631&amp;part=rss&amp;subj=6168631 |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of the announcement of his departure IESA's shares jumped 24%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/technology-media-telco-SP/idUSL052812320070405 |title=Infogrames shares shine after chairman leaves &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Reuters&lt;! |date=2007-04-05 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, he joined [[zSlide]], a company based near Paris. As of 2013 he was working for Robopolis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.20minutes.fr/article/399897/Web-Bruno-Bonnell-Les-robots-vont-transformer-notre-quotidien-de-la-meme-maniere-que-les-telephones-portables.php |archive-url=https://archive.is/20100425063931/http://www.20minutes.fr/article/399897/Web-Bruno-Bonnell-Les-robots-vont-transformer-notre-quotidien-de-la-meme-maniere-que-les-telephones-portables.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-04-25 |title=Bruno Bonnell: «Les robots vont transformer notre quotidien, de la même manière que les téléphones portables |publisher=20minutes.fr |date=2010-05-31 |accessdate=2013-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a Lyon-based robot distributor.

On 31 May 2012, Bruno Bonnell is elected as President of the EMLyon Business School Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.em-lyon.com/fr/emlyon-enseignement-entrepreneuriat/business-school/actualites-grande-ecole-management/Manuel/Bruno-Bonnell-elu-President-du-Conseil-d-Administration-d-EMLYON-Business-School |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422223024/http://www.em-lyon.com/fr/emlyon-enseignement-entrepreneuriat/business-school/actualites-grande-ecole-management/Manuel/Bruno-Bonnell-elu-President-du-Conseil-d-Administration-d-EMLYON-Business-School |archivedate=2014-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; EMLyon is a business school in Lyon, created in 1872.

On 11 May 2017, he was invested by [[En Marche!]] to contest [[Rhône's 6th constituency]], against minister [[Najat Vallaud-Belkacem]], in the [[French legislative election, 2017|legislative elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Catherine Lagrange|title=Législatives : Bruno Bonnell en marche contre Najat Vallaud-Belkacem|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/legislatives/legislatives-bruno-bonnell-en-marche-contre-najat-vallaud-belkacem-11-05-2017-2126672_3408.php|newspaper=Le Point|date=11 May 2017|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cast Acrylic''' is a form of [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|poly(methyl methacrylate)]] (PMMA).  It is formed by casting the [[monomer]], [[methyl methacrylate]], mixed with [[Radical initiator|initiators]] and possibly other additives into a form or mold.  Sheet and rod stock are generated by casting into static forms, while tubing is done in rotational molds.


== Advantages ==

It has better thermal stability, higher resistance to crazing (when a network of very small cracks form) when exposed to solvents, wider thermoforming range than extruded acrylic. Cast acrylic has better ability to be reworked hot and it is known for its superior surface finish and optical properties. Also cast acrylic is more scratch resistant than extruded acrylic.
Cast acrylic is also preferred over extruded in applications that require machining, such as turning on Engine Lathe or milling/drilling. Extruded acrylic, with far less thermal stability, tends to melt and clog cutting tools. Even with slow speeds and lots of coolant, extruded acrylic does not produce the surface finish and tight tolerances achievable with cast acrylic.

== Usage ==

This type of acrylic is often used for aquariums, awards, financial tombstones, trophies, corporate gifts, and other products that require shaping or machining. It tends to be more clear and made to a higher quality standard, but in doing so makes it more expensive than extruded acrylic.

'''Charles Saatchi ''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɑː|tʃ|iː}}; {{lang-ar|تشارلز ساعتجي}}; born 9 June 1943) is an Iraqi-British Jewish businessman and the co-founder with his brother [[Maurice Saatchi, Baron Saatchi|Maurice]] of advertising agency [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]].  The brothers led the business – the world's largest [[advertising agency]] in the 1980s – until they were forced out in 1995. In the same year, the brothers formed a new agency called [[M&amp;C Saatchi]]. 

Saatchi is also known for his art collection and for owning [[Saatchi Gallery]], and in particular for his sponsorship of the [[Young British Artists]] (YBAs), including [[Damien Hirst]] and [[Tracey Emin]].

==Early life==
Charles Saatchi is the second of four sons born to [[Nathan Saatchi]] and Daisy Ezer, a wealthy [[Iraqi Jewish]] family in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]]. The name "[[Saatchi (disambiguation)|Saatchi]]" saatçi (''sā'ātchi''), which means "watchmaker", originates from Turkish. &lt;!--''saatçi'') ← What is this bit for? --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alkalesi |first=Yasin M. |chapter=Nouns of Occupations with Suffixes -chi and -chiyya |title=Modern Iraqi Arabic: A Textbook |publisher=Georgetown University Press |date=October 2006 |isbn=978-1-58901-130-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saatchi's brothers are David (born 1937), [[Maurice Saatchi|Maurice]] (born 1946) and Philip (born 1953).&lt;ref name="Goldman - Conflicting Accounts"&gt;Goldman – Conflicting Accounts&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1947 his father, a textile merchant, anticipated the flight that tens of thousands of Iraqi Jews would soon make to avoid persecution and relocated his family to [[Finchley]], north London.&lt;ref name=times2009&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article5817312.ece|title=The Saturday interview: Charles Saatchi|last=Thomson|first=Alice |author2=[[Rachel Sylvester]] |date=28 February 2009|publisher=Times Online|accessdate=24 November 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2002"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/newsmakers/2124645.stm|title=Charles Saatchi: Artful adman|last=Jones|first=Chris |date=12 July 2002|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathan Saatchi purchased two textile mills in north London and after a time rebuilt a thriving business. Eventually the family would settle into an eight-bedroom house in Hampstead Lane, [[Highgate]].&lt;ref name="Goldman - Conflicting Accounts"/&gt;

Saatchi attended [[Christ's College (Finchley)|Christ's College]], a grammar school in Finchley, north London.&lt;ref name=times2009/&gt; During this time, he developed an obsession with US [[popular culture|pop culture]], including the music of [[Elvis Presley]], [[Little Richard]] and [[Chuck Berry]].  He has described as "life-changing" the experience of viewing a [[Jackson Pollock]] painting at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. He then progressed to study at the [[London College of Communication]].&lt;ref name="telegraph2001"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4730049/Adventures-in-Saatchiland.html|title=Adventures in Saatchiland|last=Gleadell |first=Colin |date=31 December 2001|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=25 November 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising career==

===Early career===
In 1965, Saatchi undertook his first advertising role as a copywriter in the London office of [[Benton &amp; Bowles]], where he met Doris Lockhart (later his first wife).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Darwent |first=Charles |date=17 October 1998 |title=Pieces From a Confessional |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/pieces-from-a-confessional-1179187.html |access-date=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saatchi paired up with [[art director]] Ross Cramer and they worked as a team at [[Collett Dickenson Pearce]] and John Collins &amp; Partners before leaving in 1967 to open creative consultancy Cramer Saatchi.&lt;ref name=Adland2007&gt;{{cite book |last=Tungate |first=Mark |date=2007 |title=Adland: A Global History of Advertising |publisher=Kogan Page Publishers |page=94|isbn=0749464313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusually for a creative consultancy, they took on employees: [[Bartle Bogle Hegarty|John Hegarty]]  – previously Saatchi's art director at Benton &amp; Bowles, who would later go on to run rival agency [[Bartle Bogle Hegarty]] – and [[Jeremy Sinclair]], who as of 2016 still retains a senior role at M&amp;C Saatchi.&lt;ref name=Adland2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=VG2005&gt;{{cite book |last=Pasiuk |first=Laurie |date=2005 |title=Vault Guide to the Top Advertising &amp; PR Employers |publisher=Vault Inc |page=135 |isbn=1581313837}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to offering consulting with ad agencies they also took on some clients directly.

===Saatchi and Saatchi===
In 1970, he started the advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi with his brother Maurice, which by 1986 – following its acquisition of advertising firm [[Ted Bates (advertising firm)|Ted Bates]] – had grown to be the largest ad agency in the world, with over 600 offices.&lt;ref name=VG2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artobserved.com/2009/01/charles-saatchi-and-bbc-set-to-launch-reality-tv-show-to-discover-next-generation-of-artistic-talent/ |title= Charles Saatchi and BBC set to launch reality tv show to discover next generation of artistic talent |date=27 January 2009 | access-date=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/avidan/2012/06/21/advertising-shoots-itself-in-the-foot-again/#2db39ef281d0 |title= Advertising Shoots Itself in the Foot.

Now Saatchi &amp; Saatchi works for Labour|last1=McSmith |first1=Andy  |date=13 September 2007 |website= |publisher= |access-date=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===M&amp;C Saatchi===
At the turn of 1995, Saatchi and his brother left the agency, and together founded the rival M&amp;C Saatchi agency, taking with them many of their management and creative staff, as well as a number of clients – including [[British Airways]].&lt;ref name="bbc2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=4 January 1996 |title=British Airways head praises Maurice Saatchi |newspaper=Reuters |location= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
[[File:SaatchiGallery.jpg|thumb|The Saatchi Gallery's new premises in Chelsea, which opened in October 2008.]]
In 1969, at age 26, Saatchi purchased his first work of art by [[Sol LeWitt]], a New York minimalist. Saatchi initially patronised the [[Lisson Gallery]] in Marylebone, London, which specialised in American minimalist works. He later purchased an entire show by [[Robert Mangold]].

In the early 1980s, Saatchi purchased a {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} cement-floored and steel-girded warehouse at 98A Boundary Road in the residential London suburb of [[St. John's Wood]]. The building was transformed by architect Max Gordon into the [[Saatchi Gallery]], which was subsequently opened to the public in February 1985 to exhibit the art Saatchi had collected.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Frascina|first=Francis |date=June 2013 |title=Thatcher's Legacy |journal= Art Monthly|volume= 367|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Goldman|first= K|date=1997 |title= Conflicting Accounts: The Creation and Crash of the Saatchi and Saatchi Advertising Empire |location=New York |publisher= Touchstone|page= 149|isbn=0684815710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point the Saatchi collection contained 11 works by [[Donald Judd]], 21 by [[Sol LeWitt]], 23 by [[Anselm Kiefer]], 17 [[Andy Warhol]]s and 27 by [[Julian Schnabel]].

His taste has mutated from American abstraction and minimalism to the [[Young British Artists]] (YBAs), whose work he first saw at Goldsmith's Art School. At the YBAs' 1990 [[East Country Yard Show|''Gambler'']] exhibition, Saatchi bought [[Damian Hirst]]'s first major 'animal' installation, ''A Thousand Years''.&lt;ref name=Adland2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Jamie |date=2010 |title=The Fine Art of Success: How Learning Great Art Can Create Great Business |publisher=Wiley |page= |isbn=978-0-470-66106-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, he acquired major artworks by Hirst and [[Marc Quinn]], becoming instrumental in launching their careers. His renown as a patron peaked in 1997, when part of his collection was shown at the [[Royal Academy]] as the exhibition ''[[Sensation exhibition|Sensation]]'', which travelled to Berlin and New York causing headlines and some offence (for example, to the families of children murdered by [[Myra Hindley]], who was portrayed in one of the works), and consolidating the position of Hirst, [[Tracey Emin|Emin]] and other YBAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kino |first=Carol |date=22 October 1995 |title=Art; Not One Drop of British Reserve |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/22/arts/art-not-one-drop-of-british-reserve.html |newspaper= The New York Times|location= |access-date=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, he published the book ''My Name Is Charles Saatchi And I Am An Artoholic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-7148-5747-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subtitled "Everything You Need To Know About Art, Ads, Life, God And Other Mysteries And Weren't Afraid To Ask", it presents Saatchi's answers to a number of questions submitted by members of the public and journalists.

From November to December 2009, he had a television programme on the [[BBC]] called ''[[School of Saatchi]]'' in which he gave young aspiring artists an opportunity to showcase their work. He made no appearance in the programme, only communicating through an assistant.

In July 2010, Charles Saatchi announced he would be donating the Saatchi Gallery and over 200 works of art to the British public.&lt;ref&gt;Hewage, Tim.

The Saatchi Gallery featured in a list of the most visited art museums in the world, based on an attendance survey for 2014, compiled by ''The Art Newspaper,''  with 1,505,608 visitors. In the same survey, the gallery was shown to have hosted 15 of the 20 most visited exhibitions in London over the last 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.museus.gov.br/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TheArtNewspaper_Ranking2014.pdf|title = Instituto Brasileiro de Museus|last = |first = |date = 14 January 2016|work = Instituto Brasileiro de Museus|access-date = 14 January 2016|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has donated over 100 works to the [[Tate]] Gallery, Art for Hospitals and the Arts Council.

==Personal life==
According to the ''[[Times Online]]'', Saatchi is "reclusive", even hiding from clients when they visited his agency's offices and, as of February 2009, has only ever granted two newspaper interviews.&lt;ref name=times2009/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph2002"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/charlesqa/qa.htm|title=Readers' questions|publisher=The Sunday Telegraph|accessdate=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He does not attend his own exhibition openings; when asked why by the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'', he replied: "I don't go to other people's openings, so I extend the same courtesy to my own."&lt;ref name="telegraph2002"/&gt;

In ''[[Sunday Times Rich List 2009|The Sunday Times Rich List]]'' ranking of the wealthiest people in the UK, he was grouped with his brother Maurice, with an estimated joint fortune of £120&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/richlist-app/index.php?pageID=19|title=Rich List 2009|year=2009|publisher=Times Online|accessdate=26 November 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriages===
Saatchi first met Doris Lockhart Dibley (as she was then known) in 1965 when she was a copy group head above him at Benton &amp; Bowles.&lt;ref name="Goldman - Conflicting Accounts"/&gt; She was a native of [[Memphis, Tennessee]], USA&lt;ref name="pieces-from-a-confessional" /&gt; and Kevin Goldman describes her as "a sophisticated woman who spoke several languages, knew a great deal about art and wine and who had graduated from [[Smith College]] and the [[Sorbonne]]".&lt;ref name="Goldman - Conflicting Accounts"/&gt; She became known during their marriage as an art and design journalist, with particular knowledge of American art and [[minimalism]]. They lived together for six years&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, p.39&lt;/ref&gt; before getting married in 1973 and divorcing in 1990.&lt;ref name="pieces-from-a-confessional"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/pieces-from-a-confessional-1179187.html|title=Pieces from a confessional|last=Darwent |first=Charles |date=18 October 1998|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=24 November 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saatchi's second wife was Kay Hartenstein (to whom he was married from 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/13/style/chronicle-778490.html?pagewanted=1|title=Chronicle|date=13 August 1990|work=The New York Times|edition=New York|page=B6|publisher=The New York Times|last=Heller Anderson|first=Susan|accessdate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article4371916.ece|title=Kay Saatchi on life after Charles Saatchi|last=Dougary|first=Ginny|work=The Times|publisher=Times Newspapers|date=26 July 2008|accessdate=26 February 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;) an American [[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast]] advertising executive from [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].

Saatchi married his third wife, British journalist, author and cook [[Nigella Lawson]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2003/10_october/10/jr_nigella.shtml "Jonathan Ross cooks up a storm with Nigella Lawson"].

They lived with her two children Cosima and Bruno, as well as Phoebe.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, Beth.

In June 2013, while dining at Scott's, a London seafood restaurant, Saatchi was photographed with his hand around Lawson's throat.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Ward [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10123316/Nigella-Lawson-attacked-by-husband-at-restaurant.html "Nigella Lawson 'attacked by husband' at restaurant"], telegraph.co.uk, 16 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2347086/Nigella-Lawsons-throat-attack-ordeal-Charles-Saatchi-momentary-tiff.html|title=Nigella Lawson's throat attack ordeal Charles Saatchi momentary tiff|publisher=Daily Mail | location=London|first=Neil|last=Sears|date=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day after the pictures were published, Saatchi said they were misleading and depicted only a "playful tiff".

The '''Chrysler Building''' is an [[Art Deco]]–style [[Early skyscrapers|skyscraper]] located on the [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side]] of [[Midtown Manhattan]] in [[New York City]], at the intersection of [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] and [[Lexington Avenue (Manhattan)|Lexington Avenue]] in the [[Turtle Bay, Manhattan|Turtle Bay]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]]. At {{convert|318.9|m|ft|0|order=flip|sp=us}}, the structure was the [[List of tallest buildings and structures#History|world's tallest building]] for 11 months before it was surpassed by the [[Empire State Building]] in 1931.&lt;ref name=skyscraperCenter/&gt;&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctbuh.org/AboutCTBUH/History/MeasuringTall/tabid/1320/language/en-US/Default.aspx |title=The History of Measuring Tall Buildings |website=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat |accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the tallest brick building in the world with a steel framework. {{As of|2018}}, the Chrysler is the [[List of tallest buildings in New York City|eighth-tallest building in the city]], tied with [[The New York Times Building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.amny.com/real-estate/tallest-buildings-in-nyc-1.9216740|title=12 tallest skyscrapers in New York City|work=am New York|access-date=October 17, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally a project of real estate developer and former New York State Senator [[William H. Reynolds (senator)|William H. Reynolds]], the building was constructed by [[Walter Chrysler]], the head of the [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation]], and served as the corporation's headquarters from 1930 until the mid-1950s. The Chrysler Building's construction was characterized by a competition with [[40 Wall Street]] and the Empire State Building to become the world's tallest building. Although the Chrysler Building was built and designed specifically for the car manufacturer, the corporation did not pay for its construction and never owned it, as Walter Chrysler decided to pay for it himself, so that his children could inherit it.

When the Chrysler Building opened, there were mixed reviews of the building's design, ranging from its being inane and unoriginal to that it was modernist and iconic. Perceptions of the building have slowly evolved into its now being seen as a paragon of the Art Deco architectural style; and in 2007, it was ranked ninth on the ''[[List of America's Favorite Architecture according to the AIA|List of America's Favorite Architecture]]'' by the [[American Institute of Architects]].

[[File:Chryslerbldng42st.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A view of the Chrysler Building from 42nd Street]]
Originally, the Chrysler Building was to be the Reynolds Building, a project of real estate developer and former&amp;nbsp;New York State&amp;nbsp;Senator&amp;nbsp;[[William H. Reynolds (senator)|William H. Reynolds]].{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=1}}&lt;ref name="jayebee.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Silver Spire: How two men's dreams changed the skyline of New York |first=Claudia Roth |last=Pierpont |url=http://www.jayebee.com/discoveries/criticism/silver_spire.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040825173238/http://www.jayebee.com/discoveries/criticism/silver_spire.htm |archivedate=August 25, 2004|magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |date=November 18, 2002 |accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his involvement in planning the building, Reynolds was best known for developing [[Coney Island]]'s [[Dreamland (amusement park)|Dreamland amusement park]].&amp;nbsp;When the amusement park was destroyed by fire in 1911, Reynolds turned his attention to&amp;nbsp;Manhattan real estate, where he set out to build the tallest building in the world.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=1}}&lt;ref name="in-arch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in-arch.net/NYC/nyc2a.html|title=NEW YORK SCRAPERS - ART DECO II|last=|first=|date=June 17, 2014|website=in-Arch.net|access-date=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, Reynolds rented a large plot of land at the corner of [[Lexington Avenue]] and 42nd Street with the intention of building a tall building on the site.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=1}}&lt;ref name="jayebee.com" /&gt; In 1927, after several years of delays, Reynolds hired the architect&amp;nbsp;[[William Van Alen]] to build a forty-story building there.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Never-Again-Scaled-2005"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/26/garden/for-the-architect-a-height-never-again-to-be-scaled.html|title=For the Architect, a Height Never Again to Be Scaled|last=Bascomb|first=Neal|date=May 26, 2005|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 1, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Alen was respected in his field for his work on the Albemarle Building at Broadway and 24th Street, designing it in collaboration with his partner&amp;nbsp;[[H. Craig Severance]].&lt;ref name="Gray 1998"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/22/realestate/streetscapes-william-van-alen-an-architect-called-the-ziegfeld-of-his-profession.html|title=Streetscapes/William Van Alen; An Architect Called the 'Ziegfeld of His Profession'|last=Gray|first=Christopher|date=March 22, 1998|website=The New York Times|access-date=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=97}}&amp;nbsp;Van Alen and Severance complemented each other, with Van Alen being an original, imaginative architect and Severance being a shrewd businessperson who handled the firm's finances.{{sfn|Bascomb|2004|p=2}}&amp;nbsp;However, the relationship between them became tense over disagreements on how best to run the firm.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Never-Again-Scaled-2005" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;The breaking point came after a 1924 article, in the&amp;nbsp;''[[Architectural Review]]'', that praised the Albemarle Building's design, which the article attributed to Van Alen, while ignoring Severance's&amp;nbsp;role altogether. The architects' partnership dissolved acrimoniously several months later, with lawsuits over the firm's clients and assets lasting over a year.{{sfn|Bascomb|2004|p=4}}{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=109}}&amp;nbsp;This ended up being decisive for the design of the future Chrysler Building, since Severance's more traditional architectural style would otherwise have restrained Van Alen's more modern outlook.{{sfn|Kingston|2017|pp=108–109}}

=== Design ===
By February 2, 1928, the proposed building's height had been increased to 54 stories, which would have made it the tallest building in Midtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1928/02/02/95549248.pdf|title=54-Story Skyscraper, Tallest in Midtown, Planned at Lexington Avenue and 42d Street|last=|first=|date=February 2, 1928|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 8, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was changed again two weeks later, with official plans for a 63-story building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1928/02/16/91475150.pdf|title=SKYSCRAPER PLANS FILED.; 63-Story Offices to Rise on Lexington Av.

The 52-story [[Chanin Building]], diagonally across the intersection from Reynolds's proposed building, was also under construction. Because of the elevated spur's removal, real estate speculators believed that Lexington Avenue would become the "Broadway of the East Side", causing a [[ripple effect]] that would spur developments farther east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1928/03/04/95557551.pdf|title=BUILDING ACTIVITY ON LEXINGTON AV.; The World's Tallest Structure Planned for the Grand Central Zone.

In April 1928, Reynolds signed a 67-year lease for the plot and finalized the details of his ambitious project.{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=146}} Van Alen's original design for the skyscraper called for a base whose first-floor showroom windows would be triple-height, and above would be 12 stories with glass-wrapped corners, to create the impression that the tower was floating in mid-air.&lt;ref name="jayebee.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYEP-Reynolds-Tallest-1928&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/highlight-for-xml?altUrl=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspaper%252011%2FNew%2520York%2520Evening%2520Post%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Evening%2520Post%25201928%2520Grayscale%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Evening%2520Post%25201928%2520Grayscale%2520-%25205602.pdf|title=Reynolds Building Will Be Tallest Structure in World|work=New York Evening Post|page=12|date=July 28, 1929|accessdate=November 3, 2017|via=[[Fultonhistory.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds's main contribution to the building's design was his insistence that it have a metallic crown, despite Van Alen's initial opposition;{{sfn|Nash|McGrath|1999|p=63}} the metal-and-crystal crown would have looked like "a jeweled sphere" at night.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=189}} Originally, the skyscraper would have risen {{convert|808|ft|m|0|sp=us}}, with 67 floors.&lt;ref name="emporis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1928/07/29/121606495.pdf|title=GRAND CENTRAL ZONE TO HAVE TALLEST BUILDING IN WORLD|last=|first=|date=July 29, 1928|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 2, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYEP-Reynolds-Tallest-1928/&gt; These plans were approved in June 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1928/06/06/91523940.pdf|title=APPROVE NEW SKYSCRAPER|last=|first=|date=June 6, 1928|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 2, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Alen's drawings were unveiled in the following August and published in a magazine run by the&amp;nbsp;[[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA).{{sfn|Kingston|2017|pp=145}}

Eventually, this design would prove too advanced and expensive for Reynolds.&lt;ref name="allpar" /&gt; He instead devised an alternate design for the Reynolds Building, which was published in August 1928. The new design was much more conservative, with an [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] dome that a critic compared to Governor [[Al Smith]]'s bowler hat, and a brick arrangement on the upper floors that simulated windows in the corners, a detail that remains in the current Chrysler Building. This design almost exactly reflected the shape, setbacks, and the layout of the windows of the current building, but with a different dome.&lt;ref name="jayebee.com" /&gt;

=== Construction and finalization of plans ===
With the design complete, groundbreaking for the Reynolds Building took place on September 19, 1928,&lt;ref name="allpar" /&gt; but Reynolds did not have the means to carry on construction.{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=161}}&lt;ref name="in-arch" /&gt; Reynolds sold the plot, lease, plans, and architect's services to Walter Chrysler for $2 million on October 15, 1928.{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=161}}&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Chrysler-Plans-1928" /&gt; That same day, the Goodwin Construction Company began demolition of what had been built.{{sfn|Cobb|2010|p=109}}&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Chrysler-Plans-1928"/&gt; A contract was awarded on October 28,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Prizes for Building Workers In Novel Poster Safety Campaign |last=|first=|date=October 28, 1928|work=The New York Times|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; and demolition was completed on November 9.{{sfn|Cobb|2010|p=109}} Chrysler's initial plans for the building were similar to Reynolds's, but with the 808-foot building having 68 floors instead of 67.

From late 1928 to early 1929, modifications to the design of the dome continued.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Never-Again-Scaled-2005" /&gt; In March 1929, the press published details of an "artistic dome" that had the shape of a giant thirty-pointed star, which would be crowned by a sculpture five meters high.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1929/03/10/107095825.pdf|title=CHRYSLER BUILDING 809 FEET IN HEIGHT|last=|first=|date=March 10, 1929|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 2, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jayebee.com"/&gt;{{sfn|Bascomb|2004|p=57}} The final design of the dome included several arches and triangular windows.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Never-Again-Scaled-2005" /&gt; Lower down, the design was affected by Walter Chrysler's intention to make the building the Chrysler Corporation's headquarters, and as such, various architectural details were modeled after Chrysler automobile products, such as the hood ornaments of the [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] (see {{section link||Designs between setbacks}}).&lt;ref name="jayebee.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="emporis" /&gt; The building's gargoyles on the 31st floor and the eagles on the 61st floor, were designed to signify flight,{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=424}} and to exemplify the machine age of the 1920s.&lt;ref name="jayebee.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="emporis" /&gt; Even the topmost needle was built using a process similar to one Chrysler used to manufacture his cars, with precise "hand craftmanship".{{sfn|Curcio|2001|pp=423–424}} In his autobiography, Chrysler says he suggested that his building be taller than the [[Eiffel Tower]].&lt;ref name="Chrysler-Autobiography-1950"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Life_of_an_American_Workman.html?id=KRI-ygAACAAJ|title=Life of an American Workman|last=Chrysler|first=Walter P.|publisher=Benediction Classics|year=1950|isbn=9781849023276|location=|pages=197|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=1}}

The same year that the Chrysler Building's construction started, banker [[George L. Ohrstrom]] proposed the construction of a 47-story office building at [[40 Wall Street]] downtown. Shortly thereafter Ohrstrom modified his project to have 60 floors, but it was still below Woolworth and the 808-foot Chrysler Building project as announced in 1928.&lt;ref name="Gray 1992"/&gt; H. Craig Severance, Van Alen's former partner and the architect of 40 Wall Street, increased 40 Wall's height to {{convert|840|ft|m}} with 62 floors in April of that year. It would thus exceed the Woolworth's height by {{convert|48|ft|m}} and the Chrysler's by {{convert|32|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="Gray 1992"/&gt; 40 Wall Street and the Chrysler Building started competing for the distinction of "[[List of tallest buildings in the world|world's tallest building]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/building/the-trump-building-new-york-city-ny-usa|title=Emporis Data "...a celebrated three-way race to become the tallest building in the world."|author=Emporis GmbH|publisher=Emporis.com|accessdate=September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyscraper.org/TALLEST_TOWERS/t_manco.htm|title=The Manhattan Company – Skyscraper.org; "...'race' to erect the tallest tower in the world."|publisher=Skyscraper.org|accessdate=September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Empire State Building]], on 34th Street and Fifth Avenue, entered the competition in 1929. The "Race into the Sky", as popular media called it at the time, was representative of the country's optimism in the 1920s, which helped fuel the building boom in major cities.{{sfn|Rasenberger|2009|pp=388–389}} The 40 Wall Street tower was revised from {{convert|840|ft|m}} to 925 feet in April 1929, which would make it the world's tallest.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=130}} Severance increased the height of his project and then publicly claimed the title of the world's tallest building.&lt;ref&gt;Emporis Data – See source no.4 line 4; "Briefly held the world's tallest title until it was eclipsed by the spire of Chrysler Building."&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of 40 Wall Street began in May 1929 at a frantic pace, and it was completed twelve months later.&lt;ref name="Gray 1992"/&gt;

In response, Van Alen obtained permission for a {{convert|125|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} spire{{sfn|Stravitz|2002|p=161}}{{sfn|Binder|2006|p=102}} and had it secretly constructed inside the frame of his building.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=130}} The spire was delivered to the site in four different sections.{{sfn|Stravitz|2002|p=161}} On October 23, 1929, one week after surpassing the Woolworth Building's height and one day before the catastrophic [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] started, the spire was manufactured. According to one account, "the bottom section of the spire was hoisted to the top of the building's dome and lowered into the 66th floor of the building."&lt;ref name="Gray 1992"/&gt; Then, within 90 minutes the rest of the spire's pieces were raised and riveted in sequence,{{sfn|Stravitz|2002|p=xiii, 161}} helping raise the tower's height to 1,046 feet.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=426}}{{sfn|Cobb|2010|p=110}} Van Alen, who witnessed the process from the street along with its engineers and Walter Chrysler,{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=426}} compared the experience to watching a butterfly leaving its cocoon.{{sfn|Cobb|2010|p=110}}

In "The Structure and Metal Work of the Chrysler Building", an article published in the October 1930 edition of ''[[Architectural Forum]]'', Van Alen explained the design and construction of the crown and needle:{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=425}}&lt;ref name="Skyscraper_Museum"/&gt;

{{quote|A high spire structure with a needle-like termination was designed to surmount the dome. This is 185 feet high and 8 feet square at its base. It was made up of four corner angles, with light angle strut and diagonal members, all told weighing 27 tons. It was manifestly impossible to assemble this structure and hoist it as a unit from the ground, and equally impossible to hoist it in sections and place them as such in their final positions. Besides, it would be more spectacular, for publicity value, to have this cloud-piercing needle appear unexpectedly.}}

The steel tip brought the Chrysler Building to a height of {{convert|1046|ft|m}}, greatly exceeding 40 Wall Street's height.{{sfn|Willis|Friedman|1998|p=14}} However, contemporary news media did not write of the spire's erection, nor were there any press releases celebrating the spire's erection. Even the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', which had virtually continuous coverage of the tower's construction, did not report on the spire's installation until days after the spire had been raised.{{sfn|Miller|2015|p=258}}

Chrysler realized that his tower's height would exceed the Empire State Building's as well, having ordered Van Alen to change the Chrysler's original roof from a stubby [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] dome to the narrow steel spire.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=130}} However, the Empire State's developer [[John J. Raskob]] reviewed the plans and realized that he could add five more floors and a spire of his own to his 80-story building,{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=131}} and subsequently acquired the nearby plots needed to support that building's height extension.{{sfn|Bascomb|2004|p=230}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=ENLARGES SITE FOR 1,000-FOOT BUILDING | work=The New York Times | date=November 19, 1929 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1929/11/19/107107719.pdf | access-date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, the Empire State Building's co-developer, former Governor Al Smith, announced the updated plans for that skyscraper, with an observation deck on the 86th-floor roof at a height of {{convert|1050|ft|m}}, higher than the Chrysler's 71st-floor observation deck.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=131}}

The added height of the spire allowed the Chrysler Building to surpass [[40 Wall Street]] as the tallest building in the world and the Eiffel Tower as the tallest structure.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=131}} The Chrysler Building was thus the first man-made structure to be taller than {{convert|1000|ft|m}};{{sfn|Douglas|2004|p=95}} and as one newspaper noted, the tower was also taller than the [[List of U.S. states by elevation|highest points of five states]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/highlight-for-xml?altUrl=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspaper%252018%2FTroy%2520NY%2520Times%2FTroy%2520NY%2520Times%25201930%2FTroy%2520NY%2520Times%25201930%2520-%25201438.pdf|title=FIRST BUILDING TO RISE ABOVE 1,000 FEET HIGH|work=The Troy Times|location=[[Troy, New York]]|page=9|date=April 4, 1930|accessdate=November 3, 2017|via=[[Fultonhistory.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chrysler Building was appraised at $14 million, but was exempt from city taxes per an 1859 law that gave tax exemptions to sites owned by the Cooper Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1929/04/23/95931899.pdf|title=CHRYSLER BUILDING ESCAPES CITY TAXES|last=|first=|date=April 23, 1929|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 2, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city had attempted to repeal the tax exemption, but Cooper Union had opposed that measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=OPPOSES TAXATION OF CHRYSLER TOWER | website=The New York Times | date=June 11, 1932 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/06/11/100830264.pdf | access-date=November 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Chrysler Building retains the tax exemption, it has paid Cooper Union for the use of their land since opening.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-Stravitz-Answers1-2009/&gt;

Van Alen's satisfaction at these accomplishments was likely muted by Walter Chrysler's later refusal to pay the balance of his architectural fee.&lt;ref name="jayebee.com"/&gt; Chrysler alleged that Van Alen had received bribes from suppliers, and Van Alen had not signed any contracts with Walter Chrysler when he took over the project.&lt;ref name="in-arch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Never-Again-Scaled-2005"/&gt; Van Alen sued and the courts ruled in his favor, requiring Chrysler to pay Van Allen $840,000, or 6% of the total budget of the building.{{sfn|Cobb|2010|pp=117–118}} However, the lawsuit against Chrysler markedly diminished Van Alen's reputation as an architect, which, along with the effects of the Great Depression and negative criticism, ended up ruining his career.&lt;ref name="in-arch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Never-Again-Scaled-2005"/&gt; Van Alen ended his career as professor of sculpture at the nearby [[Beaux-Arts Institute of Design]] and died in 1954. According to author [[Neal Bascomb]], "The Chrysler Building was his greatest accomplishment, and the one that guaranteed his obscurity."&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Never-Again-Scaled-2005"/&gt;

The completed Chrysler Building garnered mixed reviews in the press. Van Alen was hailed as the "Doctor of Altitude" by ''[[American Institute of Architects#Magazine|Architect]]'' magazine, while architect [[Kenneth Murchison]] called Van Alen the "Ziegfeld of his profession", comparing him to popular [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] producer [[Florenz Ziegfeld Jr.]].&lt;ref name="Gray 1998"/&gt;{{sfn|Murchison|1930|p=24}} The building was praised for being "an expression of the intense activity and vibrant life of our day", and for "teem[ing] with the spirit of modernism, ... the epitome of modern business life, stand[ing] for progress in architecture and in modern building methods."{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=4}}{{sfn|Murchison|1930|p=78}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Eugene|last=Clute|title=The Chrysler Building|journal=Architectural Forum|volume=53|date=October 1930|page=406}}&lt;/ref&gt; An anonymous critic wrote in ''[[Architectural Forum]]''{{'s}} October 1930 issue: "The Chrysler...stands by itself, something apart and alone.

The Chrysler Building's distinction as the world's tallest building was short-lived. John Raskob realized the 1,050-foot Empire State Building would only be {{convert|4|ft|m}} taller than the Chrysler Building,{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=131}} and Raskob was afraid that Walter Chrysler might try to "pull a trick like hiding a rod in the spire and then sticking it up at the last minute."{{sfn|Bascomb|2004|p=235}} Another revision brought the Empire State Building's roof to {{convert|1250|ft|m}}, making it the tallest building in the world by far{{sfn|Bascomb|2004|p=247}}{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=185}} when it opened on May 1, 1931.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|pp=227–228}} However, the Chrysler Building is still the world's tallest steel-supported brick building.&lt;ref name="emporis"/&gt; The Chrysler Building fared better commercially than the Empire State Building did: by 1935, the Chrysler had already rented 70% of its floor area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Moore | first=L. | title=Anything Goes: A Biography of the Roaring Twenties | publisher=Atlantic Books | year=2015 | isbn=978-1-78239-868-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7JrlCQAAQBAJ | access-date=November 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Empire State had only leased 23% of its area{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=273}} and was popularly derided as the "Empty State Building".&lt;ref&gt;

Contrary to popular belief, the Chrysler Corporation was never involved in the construction or ownership of the Chrysler Building, although it was built and designed for the corporation and served as its headquarters until the mid-1950s. It was a project of Walter P.

[[File:Chrysler building- top.jpg|thumb|The building's distinctive Art Deco crown and spire]]

The Chrysler Building is considered a leading example of [[Art Deco]] architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Art Deco Design Style: Origins, History, Characteristics | website=Visual Arts Encyclopedia | url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/art-deco.htm | access-date=November 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Binder|2006|p=62}} It is constructed of a steel frame in-filled with masonry, with areas of decorative metal cladding.

The Chrysler Building uses bright "Nirosta"{{sfn|Cobb|2010|pp=105&amp;ndash;106}} [[stainless steel]] extensively in its design, an [[austenitic]] alloy developed in Germany by [[Krupp]]{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=173}}{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}} (a German [[acronym]] for '''''ni'''cht'''ro'''stender '''Sta'''hl'', meaning "non-rusting steel").&lt;ref name="jayebee.com"/&gt;{{sfn|Cobb|2010|p=106}} It was the first use of this "18-8 stainless steel" in an American project,{{sfn|Miller|2015|p=260}} composed of 18% [[chromium]] and 8% [[nickel]].{{sfn|Cobb|2010|p=106}} Nirosta was used in the exterior ornaments, the window frames, the crown, and the needle.{{sfn|Cobb|2010|pp=106–108}} The steel was an integral part of Van Alen's design, as E.E. Thum explains: "The use of permanently bright metal was of greatest aid in the carrying of rising lines and the diminishing circular forms in the roof treatment, so as to accentuate the gradual upward swing until it literally dissolves into the sky...."{{sfn|Cobb|2010|p=118}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Thum | first=E.E. | title=The book of stainless steels: corrosion resisting and heat resisting alloys | publisher=American Society for Metals | year=1935 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_BhvgAACAAJ | access-date=November 5, 2017 | page=657}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stainless steel producers used the Chrysler Building to evaluate the durability of the product in architecture. In 1929, the [[ASTM International|American Society for Testing Materials]] created an inspection committee to study its performance, which regarded the Chrysler Building as the best location to do so; a subcommittee examined the building's panels every five years until 1960, when the inspections were canceled because the panels had shown minimal deterioration.{{sfn|Cobb|2010|p=119}}

The Chrysler Building's height and legally mandated setbacks influenced Van Alen in his design.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}} The walls of the lowermost sixteen floors rise directly from the sidewalk property lines, except for a recess on one side that gives the building a "U"-shaped floor plan above the fourth floor. There are setbacks on floors 16, 18, 23, 28, and 31, making the building compliant with the Zoning Law of 1916. This gives the building the appearance of a [[ziggurat]] on one side and a U-shaped [[palazzo]] on the other.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=418}} Above the 31st floor, there are no more setbacks until the 60th floor, above which the structure is funneled into a [[Maltese cross]] shape{{sfn|Douglas|2004|p=96}} that "blends the square shaft to the [[finial]]", according to author and photographer [[Cervin Robinson]].{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=418}}

The floor plans of the first sixteen floors were made as large as possible to optimize the amount of rental space nearest ground level, which was seen as most desirable. The U-shaped cut above the fourth floor served as a shaft for air flow and illumination. The area between floors 28 and 31 added "visual interest to the middle of the building, preventing it from being dominated by the heavy detail of the lower floors and the eye-catching design of the finial. They provide a base to the column of the tower, effecting a transition between the blocky lower stories and the lofty shaft."{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=418}}

==== Designs between setbacks ====
The ground floor exterior is covered in polished [[black granite]] from Shastone, while the three floors above it are done in [[white marble]] from Georgia. There are two main entrances, on Lexington Avenue and on 42nd Street, each three floors high with Shastone granite surrounding each [[proscenium]]-shaped entryway. At some distance into each main entryway, there are revolving doors located "beneath intricately patterned metal and glass screens", designed so as to embody the Art Deco tenet of amplifying the entrance's visual impact. A smaller side entrance on 43rd Street is only one story high.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}}{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=175}} There are storefronts consisting of large Nirosta-steel-framed windows at ground level, with office windows on the second through fourth floors.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}}

The west and east elevations of the building contain the air shafts above the fourth floor, while the north and south sides contain the receding setbacks.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}} Below the 16th floor, the facade is clad with white brick interrupted by white-marble bands in a manner similar to a [[basket weaving]].{{sfn|Bascomb|2004|p=161}} The windows, arranged in grids, do not have [[window sill]]s, the frames being flush with the facade.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}} Between the 16th and 24th floors, the exterior exhibits vertical white brick columns that are separated by windows on each floor. This visual effect is made possible by the presence of aluminum [[spandrel]]s between the columns of windows on each floor. There are abstract reliefs on the 20th through 22nd-floor spandrels, while the 24th floor contains {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on}} decorative pineapples.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}}

Above the third setback, consisting of the 24th through 27th floors, the facade contains horizontal bands and zigzagged gray-and-black brick motifs. Above the fourth setback, between the 27th and 31st floors, the shaft starts to appear.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}} At each corner of the 31st floor, large car-hood ornaments made of Nirosta steel serve as visually striking objects that make the base look larger. These corner extensions help counter a common optical illusion seen in tall buildings with horizontal bands, whose taller floors would normally look larger.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=418}}{{sfn|Douglas|2004|p=96}} The 31st floor also contains a gray and white frieze of hubcaps and fenders,{{sfn|Nash|McGrath|1999|p=63}} which symbolizes both the Chrysler Corporation and serves as a visual signature of the building's Art Deco design.&lt;ref name="jayebee.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="emporis" /&gt; The bonnet embellishments take the shape of [[Mercury (god)|Mercury's]] [[Petasos|winged helmet]] and resemble hood ornaments installed on Chrysler vehicles at the time.{{sfn|Douglas|2004|p=96}}

The shaft of the tower was designed to emphasize both the horizontal and vertical: each of the tower's four sides contains three columns of windows, each framed by bricks and an unbroken marble pillar that rises along the entirety of each side. The spandrels separating the windows contain "alternating vertical stripes in gray and white brick", while each corner contains horizontal rows of black brick.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=4}}

=== Interior ===
The interior of the building contains several innovative elements. The partitions between the offices are soundproofed and divided into interchangeable sections, so that the layout of any could be changed quickly and comfortably. Pipes under the floors carry both telephone and electricity cables.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=4}}

The triangular-shaped lobby{{sfn|Miller|2015|p=259}}{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=175}} is regarded as a paragon of the Art Deco style, with clear influences of [[German Expressionism]].{{sfn|Nash|McGrath|1999|p=63}} Chrysler wanted the design to impress other architects and automobile magnates, so he imported various materials without giving consideration to the extra costs incurred.&lt;ref name="Trachtenberg Hyman 2002"/&gt; He covered the walls with huge slabs of African red [[granite]].&lt;ref name="Trachtenberg Hyman 2002"&gt;{{cite book | last=Trachtenberg | first=M. | last2=Hyman | first2=I. | title=Architecture, from Prehistory to Postmodernity | publisher=Harry N.

The lobby has dim lighting that gives it a somewhat subdued quality, although the appliqués of the lamps are striking and iconic. Both combine to create an intimate atmosphere and act to highlight the place.&lt;ref name="Trachtenberg Hyman 2002"/&gt; Vertical bars of fluorescent light are covered with Belgian blue marble and Mexican amber onyx, which soften and diffuse the light, to both illuminate and blend with the red marble walls.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=430}} The lobby also contains four elevator banks, each with a different design.{{sfn|Binder|2006|p=62}}{{sfn|Miller|2015|p=259}}

The ceiling contains a {{convert|110|by|67|ft|m|adj=on}} mural named "Transport and Human Endeavor", commissioned by [[Edward Trumbull]] in 1930. The mural's theme is "energy and man's application of it to the solution of his problems", and it pays homage to the [[Aviation between the World Wars|Golden Age of Aviation]] and the [[Machine Age]].&lt;ref name="Dunlap 1999"&gt;{{cite web| last=Dunlap | first=David W. | title=POSTINGS: 110- by 76-Foot Work on Ceiling Was Installed in 1930; Chrysler Building Mural Awakens | website=The New York Times | date=March 21, 1999 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/21/realestate/postings-110-76-foot-work-ceiling-was-installed-1930-chrysler-building-mural.html | access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Miller|2015|p=259}} The mural is painted in the shape of a "Y" with ocher and golden tones. The central image of the mural is a "muscled giant whose brain directs his boundless energy to the attainment of the triumphs of this mechanical era", according to a 1930 pamphlet that advertised the building. The mural's Art Deco style is manifested in characteristic triangles, sharp angles, slightly curved lines, chrome ornaments, and numerous patterns.&lt;ref name="Dunlap 1999"/&gt; The mural depicts several silver planes, including the ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]'', as well as furnaces of incandescent steel and the building itself.{{sfn|Miller|2015|pp=259–260}}{{sfn|Nash|McGrath|1999|p=63}} There is a wall panel dedicated to the work of clinchers, surveyors, masons, carpenters, plasterers, and builders. Fifty different figures were modeled after workers who participated in its construction.{{sfn|Miller|2015|pp=259–260}} In 1999, the mural was returned to its original state after a restoration that removed the polyurethane coating and filled-in holes added in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Dunlap 1999"/&gt;

There are 32 elevators in the skyscraper, clustered into groups of six or eight.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}} At the time of opening, 28 of these elevators were for passenger use.{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=171}} Each bank serves different floors within the building, with several "express" elevators going from the lobby to a few landings in between, while "local" elevators connect the landings with the floors above these intermediate landings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=ELEVATOR PROBLEMS IN HIGH BUILDINGS | work=The New York Times | date=May 11, 1930 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1930/05/11/97799980.pdf | access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per Walter Chrysler's wishes, the elevators were designed to run at a rate of {{convert|900|ft/min|m/min}},&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; despite the {{convert|700|ft/min|m/min|adj=on}} speed restriction enforced in all city elevators at the time.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=4}} This restriction was loosened soon after the Empire State Building opened in 1931, as that building had also been equipped with high-speed elevators.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=183}} The Chrysler Building also had three of the longest elevator shafts in the world at the time of completion.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=4}}

Over the course of a year, Van Alen painstakingly designed these elevators with the assistance of L.T.M. Ralston, who was in charge of developing the elevator cabs' mechanical parts.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}} The cabs were manufactured by the [[Otis Elevator Company]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.otis.com/_layouts/ProjectItemPopup.aspx?productItemNo=8&amp;siteURL=http://www.otis.com/site/cn-eng/Pages/GlobalProjectGallery.aspx?menuID=6|title = GLOBAL PROJECT GALLERY: Chrysler Building|access-date = February 15, 2016|publisher = [[Otis Elevator Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hevac-heritage.org/biographies/surnames_M-R/otis/O2-OTIS.pdf|title = Early 20thCentury New York, 1900-1931|access-date = February 15, 2016|publisher = CIBSE Heritage Group|last = Roberts|first = Euring Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the doors were made by the Tyler Company. The dimensions of each elevator were {{convert|5.5|ft|m}} deep by {{convert|8|ft|m}} wide.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}} The doors are made of metal and covered with eight types of exotic woods.&lt;ref name="in-arch"/&gt; When the doors are closed, they resemble "tall fans set off by metallic palm fronds rising through a series of silver parabolas, whose edges were set off by curved lilies" from the outside, as noted by Curcio. However, when a set of doors is open, the cab behind the doors resembles "an exquisite Art Deco room".{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}} These elements were influenced by Egyptian designs, which significantly impacted the Art Deco style.{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=171}} According to Vincent Curcio, "these elevator interiors were perhaps the single most beautiful and, next to the dome, the most important feature of the entire building."{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}}

Even though the woods in the elevator cabs were arranged in four basic patterns, each cab had a unique combination of woods. One writer stated that "if anything the building is based on patterned fabrics, [the elevators] certainly are. Three of the designs could be characterized as having 'geometric', 'Mexican' and vaguely 'art nouveau' motifs, which reflect the various influences on the design of the entire building."{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}}  The roof of each elevator was covered with a metal plate whose design was unique to that cab, which in turn was placed on a polished wooden pattern that was also customized to the cab. Hidden behind these plates were ceiling fans.{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=171}} Curcio wrote that these elevators "are among the most beautiful small enclosed spaces in New York, and it is fair to say that no one who has seen or been in them has forgotten them".{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}} Curcio compared the elevators to the curtains of a Ziegfeld production, noting that each lobby contains lighting that peaks in the middle and slopes down on either side.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}} The decoration of the cabs' interiors was also a nod to the Chrysler Corporation's vehicles: cars built during the building's early years had dashboards with wooden moldings.{{sfn|Nash|McGrath|1999|p=63}} Both the doors and cab interiors were considered to be works of extraordinary [[marquetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Knowles | first=Eric | title=Art Deco | publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing | series=Shire Collections | year=2014 | isbn=978-0-7478-1521-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OhjDCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115 | access-date=November 5, 2017 | page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Cloud Club}}
The private [[Cloud Club]] formerly occupied the 66th through 68th floors.&lt;ref name=enc-nyc/&gt; It opened in July 1930 with some three hundred members, all wealthy males who formed the city's elite.{{sfn|Miller|2015|p=260}}&lt;ref name="McGrath 2005"&gt;{{cite web | last=McGrath | first=Charles | title=A Lunch Club for the Higher-Ups | website=The New York Times | date=May 26, 2005 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/26/garden/a-lunch-club-for-the-higherups.html | access-date=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gray 1990"&gt;{{cite web | last=Gray | first=Christopher | title=STREETSCAPES: The Cloud Club; Still Exciting, but Still Vacant | website=The New York Times | date=January 14, 1990 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/14/realestate/streetscapes-the-cloud-club-still-exciting-but-still-vacant.html | access-date=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its creation was spurred by [[Texaco]]'s wish for a proper restaurant for its executives prior to renting fourteen floors in the building. The Cloud Club was a compromise between William van Alen's modern style and Walter Chrysler's stately and traditional tastes.&lt;ref name="McGrath 2005"/&gt; A member had to be elected, and if accepted, paid an initial fee of $200, plus a $150 to $300 annual fee.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=438}}

There was a [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]]-style [[foyer]] on the 66th floor with oak paneling, and an old English-style grill room with wooden floors, wooden beams, wrought-iron chandeliers, and glass and lead doors.{{sfn|Miller|2015|p=260}}&lt;ref name="McGrath 2005"/&gt; The main dining room, located on the 67th floor, was connected to the 66th floor by a Renaissance-style marble and bronze staircase and had a futuristic appearance, with polished granite columns and etched glass appliqués in Art Deco style.&lt;ref name="Gray 1990"/&gt; There was a mural of a cloud on the ceiling, and a mural of Manhattan on the dining room's north side.&lt;ref name="McGrath 2005"/&gt; It is believed that the dining room was an inspiration for the [[Rainbow Room]] and the Rockefeller Center Luncheon Club, both located at [[30 Rockefeller Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/2505.pdf|title=Designation List No. 461 LP-2505|website=[[Government of New York City|nyc.gov]]|publisher=[[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]]|date=October 16, 2012|accessdate=November 5, 2017|page=4|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215043348/https://www1.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/2505.pdf|archive-date=February 15, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same floor, Walter Chrysler and Texaco both had private dining rooms.&lt;ref name="Gray 1990"/&gt; The 68th floor mainly contained service spaces.&lt;ref name="Gray 1990"/&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s, members left the Cloud Club for other clubs.

==== Private offices ====
Originally, Walter Chrysler had a two-story apartment on the 69th and 70th floors with a fireplace and a private office.

The Chrysler Building is renowned for, and recognized by, its terraced crown, which is an extension of the main tower.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=418}} Composed of seven radiating terraced arches, Van Alen's design of the crown is a cruciform [[groin vault]] of seven concentric members with transitioning setbacks, mounted one behind another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecityreview.com/chryslerb.html |title=The City Review.com – Chrysler Building by AIA Carter B. Horsley |publisher=Thecityreview.com |accessdate=September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire crown is clad with Nirosta steel, ribbed and riveted in a radiating [[sunburst]] pattern with many triangular vaulted windows, transitioning into smaller segments of the seven narrow setbacks of the terraced crown.&lt;ref name="jayebee.com"/&gt;{{sfn|Cobb|2010|pp=105&amp;ndash;108}} Due to the curved shape of the dome, the Nirosta sheets had to be measured on site, so most of the work was carried out in workshops on the building's 67th and 75th floors.&lt;ref name="Skyscraper_Museum"/&gt;

According to Robinson, "Its 'dormers', each smaller and higher than the previous one, continue the wedding-cake layering of the building itself. This concept is carried forward from the 61st floor, whose eagle gargoyles echo the treatment of the 31st, to the spire, which extends the concept of 'higher and narrower' forward to infinite height and infinitesimal width. This unique treatment emphasizes the building's height, giving it an other worldly atmosphere reminiscent of the fantastic architecture of Coney Island or the Far East."{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=418}}

==== Spire ====

Above the 71st floor, the stories of the building are designed mostly for exterior appearance, functioning mainly as landings for the stairway to the spire and do not contain office space.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=400}} They are very narrow, have low and sloping roofs, and are only used to house radio transmitters and other mechanical and electrical equipment.&lt;ref name="jayebee.com"/&gt; For example, the 73rd floor houses the motors of the elevators and a {{convert|15000|gal|L|adj=on}} water tank, of which {{convert|3500|gal|L}} are reserved for extinguishing fires.&lt;ref name=mrbellers/&gt;

Chrysler Center is the name of the building complex consisting of the Chrysler Building, Chrysler Building East, and the commercial pavilion located between the two, called Chrysler Trylons. In 1998, Tishman Speyer acquired the entire complex&lt;ref name=NYTimes-New-Owner-1997/&gt; and proceeded to renovate it completely over the next two years.&lt;ref name="Dunlap 2001"/&gt;

The Chrysler Building annex at 666 Third Avenue, also known as the Kent Building at the time, was renovated and renamed Chrysler Building East.&lt;ref name="Dunlap 2001"/&gt; This [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] building, built in 1952,&lt;ref name=RealDeal-666Third/&gt; is {{convert|432|ft|m}} high and has 32 floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{ctbuh|115170|name=Kent Building}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=emporis-calyon&gt;{{emporis|114867|name=Calyon Building}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanical systems were modernized and the interior was modified. Renowned architect [[Philip Johnson]] replaced the glass facade with darker glass and added a {{convert|135000|ft2|m2}} extension.&lt;ref name=emporis-calyon/&gt;&lt;ref name="Holusha 1999"&gt;{{cite web| last=Holusha | first=John | title=Commercial Property /Lexington and Third Avenues, 42d and 43d Streets; The Making of the Chrysler Center | website=The New York Times | date=May 30, 1999 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/30/realestate/commercial-property-lexington-third-avenues-42d-43d-streets-making-chrysler.html | access-date=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the addition, the total area of this building was {{convert|770,000|ft2|m2}}.&lt;ref name=ts-center&gt;{{cite web| title=Chrysler Center | website=Tishman Speyer | url=http://www.tishmanspeyer.com/properties/chrysler-center | access-date=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, a new building, which was also designed by Philip Johnson, was built between the original skyscraper and the annex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Dunlap | first=David W. | title=Chrome Spire By Chrysler To Meet Crystal By Johnson | website=The New York Times | date=June 28, 1998 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/28/nyregion/chrome-spire-by-chrysler-to-meet-crystal-by-johnson.html | access-date=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became the Chrysler Trylons, a commercial pavilion three stories high with a retail area of {{convert|22,000|ft2|m2}}. Its design, consisting of three triangular glass pyramids that intersect each other, was inspired by the triangular windows of the Chrysler Building's crown. The building's design was so complex that a replica was built at [[Rimouski]], [[Quebec]]. Johnson designed Chrysler Trylons as "a monument for 42nd Street [...] to give you the top of the Chrysler Building at street level."&lt;ref name="Dunlap 2001"&gt;{{cite web| last=Dunlap | first=David W. | title=Commercial Real Estate; Philip Johnson's Latest Creation Is Now Stopping Traffic | website=The New York Times | date=May 9, 2001 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/09/nyregion/commercial-real-estate-philip-johnson-s-latest-creation-is-now-stopping-traffic.html | access-date=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After these modifications, the total leasable area of the complex was {{convert|2,062,772|ft2|m2}}.&lt;ref name=ts-center/&gt; The total cost of this project was about one hundred million dollars.&lt;ref name="Dunlap 2001"/&gt; This renovation has won several awards and commendations, including an [[Energy Star]] rating from the [[Environmental Protection Agency]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/science/earth/new-york-citys-effort-to-track-energy-efficiency-yields-some-surprises.html|title=New York City’s Effort to Track Energy Efficiency Yields Some Surprises|last=Navarro|first=Mireya|date=December 24, 2012|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 6, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; a LEED Gold designation;&lt;ref name=realdeal20121029&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://therealdeal.com/2012/10/29/chrysler-building-gets-a-green-makeover/|title=Chrysler Building gets a green makeover|date=October 29, 2012|work=The Real Deal New York|access-date=November 6, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Skyscraper Museum Outstanding Renovation Award of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyscraper.org/PROGRAMS/EVENTS_ARCHIVE/MAKING_NEW_YORK_HISTORY_2001/mnyh01.htm|title=THE 2001 MAKING NEW YORK HISTORY AWARDS|date=November 15, 2001|website=The Skyscraper Museum|access-date=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George H.

'''Edward John DeBartolo Sr.''' (May 17, 1909 &amp;ndash; December 19, 1994) was an  American businessman. In 1971, his Ohio-based corporation was ranked as 47th among the nation's top 400 construction contractors. In 1983, DeBartolo was included on ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine's first [[Forbes 400]] list of richest Americans.&lt;ref name="vindy-12-20-94"&gt;

== Early years ==
The second of six children, DeBartolo was born in [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], [[Ohio]], a center of steel production that was also a major destination for immigrants from [[Southern Europe|Southern]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. DeBartolo's parents, Anthony Paonessa and Rose Villani, had immigrated to the United States from [[Italy]]. DeBartolo never knew his biological father, who died suddenly before his birth.&lt;ref name="vindy-12-20-94"/&gt;

After Anthony Paonessa's death, Rose Villani Paonessa married Michael DeBartolo, and Edward took his stepfather's family name. Michael DeBartolo emigrated from [[Bari, Italy]], with his family at age 17 and became a paving contractor and builder of warehouses and other structures.&lt;ref name="vindy-12-20-94"/&gt;  While a teenager, Edward DeBartolo began working, translating paving contracts for his stepfather, who did not read or write [[English language|English]].

DeBartolo went on to earn a degree in [[civil engineering]] at the [[University of Notre Dame]].&lt;ref name="vindy-12-20-94"/&gt; Next came a decade of construction jobs with his stepfather. Capitalizing on his engineering skills, DeBartolo found himself serving in the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] during [[World War II]]. It was during the War, in 1944, that he married Marie Patricia Montani and incorporated his own company, The Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation.

== Adult life and career ==
After the war ended, DeBartolo served as president of Michael DeBartolo Construction and as [[Entrepreneur|founder]] and president of his newly formed company.  DeBartolo was able to take advantage of dramatic changes occurring across the [[United States of America|United States]] after [[World War II]]. As more Americans moved into suburbs, there was a corresponding increase in demand for convenient access to shopping. His first retail development was the construction of Gray's Drug Store and [[Sears, Roebuck and Co.]] department store in the "Uptown" area of Youngstown. DeBartolo's company was one of the first companies in the United States to build shopping centers in suburban communities. These shopping centers were initially plazas built as long strips, but soon DeBartolo began developing enclosed shopping malls as well, with brother Frank DeBartolo acting as architect.&lt;ref name="vindy-12-20-94"/&gt;

The Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation was the undisputed leader in the shopping mall industry from the birth of the industry until DeBartolo's death, owning almost one-tenth of all mall space in the United States.&lt;ref name="vindy-12-20-94"/&gt; DeBartolo also branched out into other types of urban development and construction, such as [[hotel]]s, office parks, and [[condominium]]s. He established a work ethic of fifteen-hour days and seven-day weeks.  He once told his senior executives, "My wife has never seen me lie down while the sun was up." By 1990, DeBartolo was estimated to have more than $1.4 billion in personal wealth.&lt;ref name="vindy-12-20-94"/&gt;

A powerful strategic thinker, DeBartolo began acquiring [[department store]] chains in the late 1980s. In 1986, he helped finance [[Robert Campeau]]'s purchase of [[Allied Stores Corporation]], a department store holding corporation that owned such iconic department store brands as Jordan Marsh and [[Maas Brothers]], as well as specialty stores such as [[Bonwit Teller]] and Ann Taylor.  DeBartolo lent Campeau $150 million to bridge the financing gap for the acquisition.  Campeau repaid the money, and in 1986, DeBartolo assisted in financing Allied Stores Corporation's acquisition of [[Federated Department Stores]], a department store holding company and the owner of, among other assets, Macy's and Bloomingdale's department stores.  DeBartolo provided nearly $500 million in financing. In 1990, Federated went bankrupt, defaulting on the repayment of the loans made by DeBartolo; it emerged from bankruptcy after the ouster of Campeau in 1992 as a new public company under the name "Macy's, Inc." During the course of the bankruptcy, DeBartolo's [[cash flow]] was severely impaired, due to Federated's nonpayment as well as the real estate recession of the time.  DeBartolo's Federated positions were all realigned when Federated emerged from bankruptcy.

In 1988, he partnered with [[Dillard's]] Department Stores to buy [[Higbee's]] of [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. In 1992, William Dillard, founder of Dillard's, bought DeBartolo's share, except for the property interest in Higbee's Public Square flagship store in Cleveland (sold to Tower City in 2001), and renamed it the Higbee chain. DeBartolo's idea of a retail real estate developer going forward with new projects easily and quickly, by virtue of anchor stores which he owned, would never become a reality.

As a result of several years' impaired cash flow, DeBartolo prepared to take his company public as a real estate investment trust or "REIT".  Most of DeBartolo's competitors were preparing to do the same, their operations suffering from a lack of capital in the private markets. In late 1993, the two largest shopping center companies at the time, DeBartolo and Simon{{ambiguous|text=unidentified name; is this Melvin, Herbert, or Fred Simon, or Simon Property Group?|date=September 2014}} were coming to the market simultaneously.  Their advisors informed them that the capital markets could not absorb that much equity; either one of them must back down or prices would suffer severely.  DeBartolo agreed to withdraw.  In April, 1994, most of the properties owned by The Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation were transferred to DeBartolo Realty Corporation, a public REIT, in its initial public offering.  The new company was chaired by [[Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.]]; DeBartolo Sr. was unwilling to deal personally with the constraints of running a public company.  In 1996, DeBartolo Realty Corporation was acquired by [[Simon Property Group]], the public REIT formed by DeBartolo's longtime competitors, [[Melvin Simon|Melvin]] and [[Herbert Simon (real estate)|Herbert Simon]].

DeBartolo's contributions to the campus at the [[University of Notre Dame]] include DeBartolo Hall (the main classroom building) and DeBartolo Performing Arts Center (DPAC), both located on a quad that students refer to as "DeBartolo Quad". There is also a DeBartolo Hall on the campus of [[Youngstown State University]] (YSU), in his hometown of Youngstown, where DeBartolo has made many endowments to YSU. The DeBartolo Corporation continues to be based in nearby [[Boardman, Ohio]].

DeBartolo purchased the [[San Francisco 49ers]] in 1977, giving the team to his son. DeBartolo Jr. devoted significant resources to the team, became an expert in team management and player relations, and made it the most successful [[National Football League|NFL]] franchise in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="vindy-12-20-94"/&gt;

DeBartolo founded the [[Pittsburgh Maulers]] of the [[United States Football League]] in March 1983, but folded the team after the first season (1984) when the league announced it would move to a fall schedule, the same time as the NFL's [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].

The family also owned the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] of the [[National Hockey League]] from February 1977 until selling it to an ownership group led by [[Howard Baldwin]] in November 1991. His team would win the [[Stanley Cup]] in 1991. He would be engraved onto the Stanley Cup along with his daughter [[Denise DeBartolo York]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.debartolosports.com/aboutus.htm&lt;/ref&gt; DeBartolo said at a rally after the first win that the occasion "possibly the happiest moment of my life."&lt;ref&gt;

He also owned the soccer team [[Pittsburgh Spirit]] from 1978 until 1986.

While DeBartolo was unsuccessful in his attempt to purchase the [[Chicago White Sox]] in 1980,&lt;ref name="vindy-12-20-94"/&gt; he owned and developed three thoroughbred racetracks &amp;ndash; [[Thistledown Racecourse|Thistledown]] in Cleveland, [[Remington Park]] in [[Oklahoma City]], and [[Louisiana Downs]] in [[Bossier City, Louisiana]].&lt;ref name="vindy-12-20-94"/&gt;

[[Image:EFPIA Logo LR 070416.png|thumb|200px|right|Logo]]
The '''European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations''' ('''EFPIA''') is a [[Brussels]]-based trade association founded in 1978  representing the research-based pharmaceutical industry operating in Europe.

Through its membership of 33 national associations and 40 leading pharmaceutical companies, EFPIA represents 1,900 EU companies committed to researching, developing and manufacturing new medical treatments.

Figures published in 2008 by the European Commission ([http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/eurostat/home Eurostat]) show that the pharmaceutical industry is the industrial sector which invests most in research &amp; development (R&amp;D). In 2011, it invested an estimated €27,500 million in R&amp;D in Europe. It directly employed 660,000 people and generated three to four times more employment indirectly (upstream and downstream).
[[File:Employment in the pharmaceutical industry.jpg|thumb| ]]

The key contribution of the research-based pharmaceutical industry to medical progress is to turn fundamental research into
innovative treatments that are widely available and accessible to patients, with the goal of helping people live longer and be healthier. High blood pressure and cardiovascular disease can be controlled with anti-hypertensive medicines and cholesterol-lowering medicines, knee or hip replacements prevent patients from immobility, and some cancers can be controlled or even cured thanks to newer targeted medicines. Yet there remain huge challenges in many disease areas such as Alzheimer, multiple sclerosis, many cancers and orphan diseases.

EFPIA also includes two specialised groups focusing on vaccines and biotechnology respectively:
* Vaccines Europe ([http://www.vaccineseurope.eu/ '''EV''']) produce approximately 80% of vaccines used worldwide.
* European Biopharmaceutical Enterprises ([http://www.ebe-efpia.org '''EBE''']) harness biotechnology to develop approximately one-fifth of new medicines.

==EFPIA priorities==
The industry's efforts are focused around four key areas - the AIMS - Roadmap of priorities Access, Innovation, Mobilization, Security [http://www.efpia.org/Content/Default.asp?PageID=376] programme.
* '''Access''' refers to the need to continue to work towards speeding up regulatory approval and reimbursement processes for new medicines; removing government controls on medicines that are not reimbursed; and ensuring that Health Technology Assessment (HTA) does not become a fourth hurdle to market access.
* '''Innovation''' focuses on efforts towards creating a strong science base in Europe and making Europe an attractive location for the best researchers; ensuring a fair reward for innovation, including incremental innovation and ensuring a high level of protection for Intellectual Property Rights.
* '''Mobilization''' is about joining forces with key stakeholders to address the challenges of an ageing population and deliver modern and sustainable healthcare; to fight damaging cost-containment policies; to empower patients and citizens to take an active role in managing their health through better access to information from multiple sources; to highlight industry's contribution to access to medicines and to promote new incentives for research into diseases affecting the developing world.
* '''Security''' refers to the need to strengthen the integrity and transparency of the pharmaceutical supply chain by addressing the safety concerns of parallel trade; raising public awareness on the risk of counterfeits; and increasing the traceability of pharmaceutical products.

==Research and Development (R&amp;D)==
In 2010 the pharmaceutical industry invested about €27,800 million in R&amp;D in Europe. After a decade of strong US market dominance, which led to a significant shift of economic and pharmaceutical research activity towards the US during the period 1995-2005, Europe is now also facing increasing competition from emerging economies. Today there is rapid growth in the market and research environment in emerging economies such as Brazil, China and India, resulting in further migration of economic and research activities outside of Europe to these fast-growing markets. The geographical balance of the pharmaceutical market – and ultimately the R&amp;D base – is likely to shift gradually towards emerging economies.

All new medicines introduced into the market are the result of lengthy, costly and risky research and development (R&amp;D) conducted by pharmaceutical companies:
* By the time a medicinal product reaches the market, an average of 12–13 years will have elapsed since the first synthesis of the new active substance;
* The cost of researching and developing a new chemical or biological entity was estimated at €1,059 million ($1,318 million in year 2005 dollars) in 2005 (Di Masi J., Tufts University, Centre for the Study of Drug Development, 2007);
* On average, only one or two of every 10,000 substances synthesised in laboratories, will successfully pass all the stages to become marketable medicines.

There is rapid growth in the research environment in emerging economies such as China and India. The current tendency to close R&amp;D sites in Europe and to open new sites in Asia will show dramatic effects to maintain the pharmaceutical discovery expertise in the EU. The United States still dominates the biopharmaceutical field, accounting for the three quarters of the world’s biotechnology revenues and R&amp;D spending.

In 2007 North America accounted for '''45.9%''' of world pharmaceutical sales against '''31.1%''' for Europe. According to [http://www.imshealth.com/portal/site/imshealth IMS Health] data, '''66%''' of sales of new medicines launched during the period 2004-2008 were generated on the US market, compared with '''26%''' on the European market.

==Innovative Medicines Initiative==
The [http://www.imi.europa.eu/ Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI)] is a public-private partnership designed by the European Commission and EFPIA. It is a pan-European collaboration that brings together large biopharmaceutical companies, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), patient organisations, academia, hospitals and public authorities. The initiative aims to accelerate the discovery and development of better medicines by removing bottlenecks in the drug development process. It focuses on creating better methods and tools that improve and enhance the drug development process, rather than on developing specific, new medicines.

The European Commission and EFPIA have jointly established a new-non-profit European Community body. This organisation has a legal mandate to award research grants to European public-private collaborations conducting innovative research projects that focus on implementing the recommendation of the IMI Research Agenda.

The IMI Research Agenda was established under the lead of industry following intensive consultations with a broad range of stakeholders from across Europe. It identifies the principal research bottlenecks in the biopharmaceutical R&amp;D process and sets forth recommendations to overcome these bottlenecks by focusing on four areas:
* Predicting safety: this addresses bottlenecks related to accurately evaluating the safety of a compound during the pre-clinical phase of the development process, but also impacts the later phases in clinical development.
* Predicting efficacy: this addresses bottlenecks in the ability to predict how a drug will interact in humans and how it may produce a change in function.
* Knowledge management: this addresses the more effective use of information and data for predicting safety and efficacy.
* Education &amp; training: this closes existing training gaps in the drug development process.

IMI will make Europe more attractive for biopharmaceutical R&amp;D investments and boost the competitiveness of European life science R&amp;D. By directly addressing the challenges facing the biopharmaceutical sector in Europe, IMI has the potential to:
* modernise the development of medicines
* expand European expertise and know-how in new technologies to attract biomedical R&amp;D investment to Europe
* anchor R&amp;D jobs in Europe and reverse the brain drain
* enhance Europe's economy by improving the conditions for the biomedical industry and intensifying the collaboration of all stakeholders.

'''Ford Auditorium''' was an auditorium in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] that was built in 1955 and opened in 1956. Located on the Detroit riverfront, it served as a home to the [[Detroit Symphony Orchestra]] (DSO) for more than 33 years and was an integral part of the city's Civic Center.&lt;ref name="this"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cVP055AfqNEC&amp;pg=PA165 | title=This is Detroit 1701-2001| accessdate=January 25, 2011| author=Arthur M.

== History ==

The auditorium was financed by the [[Ford Motor Company]] and contributions of the Ford affiliated dealers in the U.S. Ford gave its approval when the city planned to remove the building as part of the waterfront redesign plans. The project received such a large donation from the Ford family, it was designed as a memorial to [[Henry Ford|Henry]] and [[Edsel Bryant Ford|Edsel Ford]]. When the auditorium opened, it became home for the DSO and hosted conventions, pop concerts, theatrical productions and speeches. The building had outlived its usefulness to the city and was replaced by other facilities. The building acoustics were also not considered satisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;Helms, Matt (July 15, 2011).[http://www.freep.com/article/20110715/NEWS01/110715027/Huge-excavator-topples-site-Ford-Auditorium-demolition-Detroit?odyssey=tab|topnews|text|FRONTPAGE Huge excavator topples at site of Ford Auditorium].'' Detroit Free Press''. Retrieved July 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was designed by the firm of Odell, Hewlett and Luckenbach in the modern style.  It was situated at the base of a U-shaped drive named Auditorium Drive.  Beneath the drive and adjacent landscaped areas was a two-level parking garage containing 750-spaces.  The garage was accessed via ramps in the median of [[Jefferson Avenue (Detroit)|Jefferson Avenue]] and had a pedestrian entrance which provided direct access to the lower-level lounge of the auditorium.

[[Image:The Ford Auditorium.JPG|thumb|left|The Ford Auditorium as it appeared in March 2011, from the rear]]
The exterior shape of the building followed the form of its interior spaces with backstage and audience areas clearly visible.  The sides of the building were clad in white marble to harmonize with the other buildings in the Civic Center Complex- the [[Coleman A. Young Municipal Center|City-County Building]], [[UAW-Ford National Programs Center|Veterans Memorial Building]] and [[Cobo Center|Cobo Hall and Arena]].  The Jefferson Avenue and [[Detroit River|river]] facades were covered with a [[mica]]-flecked blue granite in a basket-weave pattern.&lt;ref name="aia"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Meyer| first1=Katherine Mattingly| last2=Martin C.P.

In the curved foyer of the main level were three sculptures by local artist [[Marshall Fredericks]].  On the curved wall above the main entrance is a 120-foot mural made of steel, copper and aluminum wire entitled ''Ford Empire'' which depicts the [[Ford River Rouge Complex|Ford Rouge Complex]].  Above the stairs to the balcony at the east end of the lobby was a piece entitled ''Harlequins, Ballerina and Orchestral Parade'' and above the west stairs was another piece entitled ''Harlequins and Circus Parade''.  The Ford Empire mural was moved to storage in 2003&lt;ref name="mfsm"&gt;{{cite web| title=Categorical Listing of works-Architectural| publisher=Saginaw Valley State University| url=http://www.svsu.edu/dnu/mfsm/pages/architecture.html| year=2011| accessdate=January 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007, the [http://www.svsu.edu/mfsm/home.html Marshall Fredericks Sculpture Museum] at [[Saginaw Valley State University]] negotiated with the City of Detroit to have the two smaller pieces moved there.&lt;ref name="svsu"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.svsu.edu.mfsm/harlequins.html| publisher=Saginaw Valley State University| title=Harlequins| date=| accessdate=January 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 1965, the auditorium served as a historical stage for [[Malcolm X]] to deliver his last speech outside of New York before his death. He delivered his "Last Message" at the First Annual Dignity Projection and Scholarship Awards ceremony despite the firebombing of his [[Queens, New York]] home by the [[Nation of Islam]] that morning.&lt;ref name="tap"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://detroitontap.blogspot.com/2008/09/ford-auditorium-and-black-history.html| author=Paul Lee| title=Ford Auditorium and Black History| date=September 28, 2008| accessdate= January 25, 2011| publisher=Detroit on Tap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demolition===
Ford Auditorium was demolished in July 2011 at a cost of $754,000 as part of the city's waterfront redesign plans.&lt;ref name="demo1"&gt;{{cite news| title=The Fat Lady finally sings for Ford Auditorium| url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2011307080001| work=Detroit Free Press| publisher=freep.com|page=| date=July 9, 2011| author=Steve Neavling| accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demolition of the Ford Auditorium began on July 9, 2011 after being delayed a month because the city found more asbestos than expected.&lt;ref name="demo2"&gt;{{cite news| work=Detroit News| publisher=detnews.com| url=http://www.freep.com/article/20110708/NEWS01/307080001/The-Fat-Lady-finally-sings-Ford-Auditorium?odyssey=tab%7Ctopnews%7Ctext%7CFRONTPAGE| date=July 9, 2011| accessdate=| title=The Fat Lady finally sings Ford Auditorium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recording System===
When first opened, the auditorium had a state-of-the-art recording system, and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra under [[Paul Paray]] made a number of recordings in the venue for [[Mercury Records]].  But it was also considered a very "dead" hall, with poor acoustics that resisted repeated attempts at improvement.  After much discussion, the DSO returned to its former home, [[Orchestra Hall (Detroit, Michigan)|Orchestra Hall]], in 1989.  Ford Auditorium saw little activity thereafter, and by 1995, had stopped accepting reservations for use of its facilities.

===Organs===
According to the [[Aeolian-Skinner]] archives, the auditorium's large Aeolian-Skinner organ was still in the building as of 2006, but had been unused for some time.  It was installed in 1957 at a cost of $100,000.  Helderop Pipe Organs, along with a team of volunteers, began to dismantle the organ in late June 2011, and finished late July 4, 2011, the day before demolition was scheduled to begin.&lt;ref name="Freep2"&gt;{{cite news| title=Pipe organ rescued just in time| url=http://www.freep.com/article/20110706/NEWS01/107060375/Pipe-organ-rescued-just-time-from-Ford-Aud-| work=Detroit Free Press| publisher=The Detroit Free Press|page=4a| date=June 28, 2011| author=Elisha Anderson| accessdate=2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city donated the organ to the congregation of nearby St. Aloysius Catholic Church, which took the 2,800-pipe instrument with the goal of operating it within two years.&lt;ref name="Freep2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freep"/&gt;

A smaller 1,200-pipe organ which operated from the same console has been given to the DSO who will use it to perform 17th and 18th-century pieces in Orchestra Hall.&lt;ref name="Freep"&gt;{{cite news| title=Team works to rescue Ford Auditorium's vintage pipe organ before the Detroit building is demolished| url=http://www.freep.com/article/20110628/NEWS01/106280355/Team-works-rescue-Ford-Auditorium-s-vintage-pipe-organ-before-Detroit-building-demolished?odyssey=mod_sectionstories| work=Detroit Free Press| publisher=freep.com|page=4a| date=June 28, 2011| author=Elisha Anderson| accessdate=2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4547">{{DISPLAYTITLE:Ifo Business Climate Index}}

The '''Ifo Business Climate Index''' is a closely followed leading indicator for economic activity in Germany prepared by the [[Ifo Institute for Economic Research]] in [[Munich]], [[Germany]].

== Elements ==

The responses to the survey questionnaire, described below, are evaluated and seasonally adjusted. An index value of 100 corresponds to the survey data as of 1 January 2005. Since January 1991 more than 200 data sets have been published.

Three data series are compiled from the raw survey data:

* business climate
* current business situation
* business outlook

These three components are published as the percentage change over the previous month and as the absolute value with regard to the index reference data, 1 January 2005 = 100. Given the growing importance of the services sector in Germany, Ifo changed the business climate indicator in 2018 to rebase the index and include responses from the services sector in its calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Joern Poltz (April 6, 2018), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-economy-ifo-exclusive/exclusive-ifo-to-change-german-business-climate-index-from-april-to-include-services-idUSKCN1HD1BL Exclusive: Ifo to change German business climate index from April to include services] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the results are depicted in the form of a "business-cycle clock".

== Procedure ==

Every month approximately 7,000 survey participants from firms in manufacturing, construction, wholesaling and retailing are requested to assess their current business situation as well as their business outlook for the coming six months. The Ifo Business Climate has been released monthly by the Ifo Institute since 1972.

=== Questionnaire ===

The firms are queried as to

* their current business situation, with the following choices
** good
** satisfactory
** poor
* their six-month business outlook, with these three choices
** more favorable
** unchanged
** less favorable

=== Evaluation method ===

The balance value of the current business situation is the difference in percentage shares of the responses "good" and "poor"; the balance value of the expectations is the difference in percentage shares of the responses "more favorable" and "less favorable". The business climate is a geometric mean of the balances of the business situation and the business expectations. To calculate the index value, the business climate the transformed balances are normalized to the average of the year 2015&lt;ref&gt;https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/konjunktur/nachrichten/ifo-geschaeftsklimaindex-die-hochstimmung-in-den-deutschen-chefetagen-verfliegt/21206778.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Interpretation ===

As an indicator of economic activity, the Business Climate Index is meant to supplement data from the official statistics, over which it has the advantage of being more frequently compiled and more rapidly accessible (GDP, for example, is only released quarterly and published with a delay of ca. two quarters, with the likelihood of subsequent revisions).

The particular importance of the Ifo Business Climate Index is forecasting turning points in economic growth. A cyclical turning point is reliably indicated following the "three-times rule", that is movement in a particular direction three months in succession.&lt;ref name="Kunkel"&gt;Kunkel, André (2003): [http://www.cesifo.de/pls/guest/download/ifo%20Diskussionsbeitraege/ifodpaper80.pdf Zur Prognosefähigkeit des ifo-Geschäftsklimas und seiner Komponenten sowie die Überprüfung der „Dreimal-Regel“], ifo-Diskussionsbeiträge, Nr.80&lt;/ref&gt;

== Highest and lowest values ==

'''Janet "Jenny" Luy Lim-Napoles'''{{refn|group=nb|Her given name was also spelled as '''Jannet''' on her birth certificate.&lt;ref name="birth certificate"&gt;[https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-1961-27014-18410-9?cc=1410394&amp;wc=9Z32-W38:25272501,48155601,25268203,25270803 Janet Lim-Napoles' Birth Certificate]&lt;/ref&gt;}} (born Janet Lim y Luy; January 15, 1964) is a businesswoman who is believed to have masterminded the [[Priority Development Assistance Fund scam|Priority Development Assistance Fund Scam]].

==Early life==
Janet Luy Lim was born in [[Malabon]], then a municipality of [[Rizal]].  She is the fourth of five children of a [[Chinese Filipino]] couple: Johnny Co Lim (born Lim King Sing) and Magdalena "Nelly" Lim Luy{{refn|group=nb|'''Mely Francisco Luy''' on Janet Lim-Napoles' birth certificate.&lt;ref name="birth certificate" /&gt;}}.

The family lived in [[Binondo, Manila|Binondo]], [[Manila]] until December 1970, when Johnny Co Lim died, and Luy returned with her children to her hometown of [[Maluso, Basilan|Maluso]], [[Basilan]]. Napoles, who was six at the time, studied at the Maluso Central Elementary School, and completed her secondary education at the local [[Claretians|Claretian]] school. The family ran the Luys' [[sari-sari store]], and delivered drinks to workers at the local port.&lt;ref name="earlylife" /&gt;  However, some residents of Maluso have claimed that the Luys were a rich family, owning a fish drying business and plots of land.&lt;ref name="oldrich" /&gt;  As the security situation in Basilan began to deteriorate, and the family received threats of extortion, the Lim family moved back to Manila.&lt;ref name="oldrich" /&gt;

Napoles reportedly met her husband, Jaime G. Napoles, on board a ferry which traversed between the southern islands of Mindanao,.&lt;ref name="earlylife" /&gt; They married in April 1982,&lt;ref name="carpetride" /&gt; when she was 18. In Manila, the couple lived in [[Fort Bonifacio]], where the young Napoles ran a ''[[carinderia]]''.&lt;ref name="earlylife" /&gt;

==Business career and government involvement==
Napoles' business interests date back to the early 1990s. In 1993, she solicited for investments in a shipyard in [[Cebu]], promising 5% interest on all investments. It was later discovered that the money was not invested in the shipyard: according to Col. [[Ariel Querubin]], who was a friend of the Napoles family, the money they had invested in the shipyard was reportedly invested elsewhere, with Napoles pocketing the interest. While the investment was eventually recovered, Querubín claims the investment led to the death of his first wife.&lt;ref name="tragicpast" /&gt;

In 2001, Napoles and her husband were implicated in the acquisition by the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] of ₱3.8 million worth of substandard [[Personnel Armor System for Ground Troops|Kevlar helmet]]s, and were charged with graft and malversation of public funds by the [[Sandiganbayan]] (people's special tribunal). While her husband was dropped from the list of defendants in 2002, Janet Napoles stood trial, and was acquitted on October 28, 2010 for lack of evidence.&lt;ref name="kevlarhelmets" /&gt;

In 2013 it was revealed that Janet Napoles's JLN Corporation had paid significantly less taxes than the average local public school teacher. Records show that from 2009 to 2011, the company paid between ₱9,036-25,164 in annual taxes, whereas a public school teacher at that time would have paid around ₱35,952 per year.&lt;ref name="teachertaxes" /&gt;

===PDAF scam===
{{main|Priority Development Assistance Fund scam}}
PDAF was a program initially implemented in 1990 which was designed to allow legislators to fund small-scale infrastructure or community projects which fell outside the scope of the national infrastructure program. It was later ruled as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/336120/supreme-court-declares-pdaf-unconstitutional/story/&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoles has been linked with an alleged misuse of the Priority Development Assistance Fund, together with Philippine Senators [[Bong Revilla]], [[Jinggoy Estrada]], [[Juan Ponce Enrile]], and other congressmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Janet Napoles and the unraveling of the pork barrel scandal|date = December 31, 2013|url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/341906/news/specialreports/janet-napoles-and-the-unraveling-of-the-pork-barrel-scandal|last = Arquiza|first = Yasmin}}  [[GMA News]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illegal detention case===
[[Janet Lim Napoles]] was accused of illegally detaining Benhur Luy, her cousin and former employee in 2014. Luy's three-month custody under Napoles ended in March 2014. Napoles alleged that Luy took a  ₱5.5-million loan under her name without her authorization. She also alleged that Luy was supposed to deposit  ₱300,000 to her account but did not do so, accusing Luy of theft. Luy insists that he was detained by Napoles due to fears that Luy will expose Napoles' alleged significant role in the PDAF scam. Lim was later found guilty beyond reasonable doubt and was sentenced to ''[[reclusión perpetua]]'' on April 14, 2015. Napoles and her lawyers have indicated that they will appeal the decision to the [[Court of Appeals of the Philippines|Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/469466/news/nation/napoles-gets-up-to-40-years-on-serious-illegal-detention-raps | title=Napoles gets up to 40 years on serious illegal detention raps | publisher=[[GMA News and Public Affairs]] | date=April 14, 2015 | accessdate=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017 Acquittal case===
The Office of the Solicitor General with the court of appeals has filed a "manifestation in lieu of rejoinder" recommending the Acquittal of Janet Lim Napoles from the Luy detention case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/investigative/161513-duterte-solicitor-general-acquit-janet-napoles-illegal-detention-benhur-luy | title=SolGen moves to acquit Napoles in Luy detention case | publisher=[[rappler]] | accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This decision by the Solicitor General [[Jose Calida]] was backed by Philippine President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] saying that he himself would move for the dismissal of the case citing selective prosecution under Aquino administration. The criminal actions must proceed against all responsible according to Duterte. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/02/27/17/duterte-backs-acquittal-of-janet-napoles-in-detention-case | title=Duterte backs acquittal of Janet Napoles in detention case | publisher=[[abs-cbn]] news | accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Janet Napoles' husband was a major in the [[Philippine Marine Corps]] who participated in the [[1989 Philippine coup attempt|God Save the Queen coup attempt]] against [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazón Aquino]].&lt;ref name="napolesstory" /&gt;  Originally a reservist, he later applied for active duty status, and eventually retired from the Marines on December 31, 2004.&lt;ref name="hubby" /&gt;  Together, they have four children, Jo Christine, James Christopher, Christian, and Jeane.&lt;ref name="carpetride" /&gt;  Jo Christine Napoles is the president of the Metro Manila chapter of the OFW Family Club [[Party-list representation in the House of Representatives of the Philippines|party list]],&lt;ref name="ofwfamilyclub" /&gt; and was the group's third nominee to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] until she withdrew her nomination on August 8, 2013.&lt;ref name="withdrawal" /&gt;  Jeane Napoles has been criticized for her ostentatious lifestyle,&lt;ref name="taberna" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rappler-lifestyle" /&gt; including owning a $2 million unit at the Ritz-Carlton in Los Angeles while she studied fashion design at the [[Fashion Institute of Design &amp; Merchandising]].&lt;ref name="unit" /&gt; The Philippines Department of Justice (DOJ) has filed a P17.88-million tax evasion case against Jeane Napoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = DOJ files P17-M tax case vs Napoles daughter|date = March 19, 2015|url = http://www.philstar.com/metro/2015/03/19/1435064/doj-files-p17-m-tax-case-vs-napoles-daughter|first = Janvic|last = Mateo}} ''[[The Philippine Star]]'' (Philstar Global Corp.)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are conflicting accounts as to the net worth of the Napoles family. While Napoles has described her family as middle class,&lt;ref name="middleclass" /&gt; acquaintances in Basilan claim that her maternal family had [[old money]],&lt;ref name="oldrich" /&gt; which she confirmed in an earlier interview as having inherited.&lt;ref name="inheritance" /&gt;  Her extended family in Basilan, however, has denied her claims of such an inheritance.&lt;ref name="inheritance-denial" /&gt; She has also claimed that most of her wealth was due to sound investments,&lt;ref name="questions" /&gt; mostly with [[coal]] trading in several countries but particularly in [[Indonesia]].
&lt;ref name="inheritance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="legitimate" /&gt;  However, the profitability of Napoles' business ventures has been questioned: according to disclosures made with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]] in 2011 and 2012, the corporations under the JLN Group of Companies reported a total net income of less than ₱1 million,&lt;ref name="businesses" /&gt; and Merlina Suñas, one of the whistleblowers in the PDAF scam, has alleged that the Napoleses are not knowledgeable about the coal industry.&lt;ref name="questions" /&gt;

In other disclosures made to the SEC, it was revealed that Napoles owned at least 28 houses in a number of cities in Luzon, with her family members also holding property in the United States.&lt;ref name="houses" /&gt;  She also maintains, according to the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]], around 415 accounts with seventeen banks.&lt;ref name="accounts" /&gt;  The Napoles family also maintains a fleet of 30 vehicles, which are all registered under the flagship company of the JLN Group of Companies, JLN Corporation.&lt;ref name="cars" /&gt;

Napoles is a member of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and has close ties with a number of Catholic clergy. She maintained a home for priests in [[Makati]] which was run by Monsignor Josefino S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2688">'''Jonathan-Raphaël Bischoffsheim''' (26 April 1808 – 5 February 1883) was a Belgian banker, businessman and philanthropist. 

==Family==
He descended from the [[Bischoffsheim family]], which was endowed with an exceptional European network. On 11 June 1832, he married Henriette [[Goldschmidt family|Goldschmidt]] (1812–1892) in Brussels, and together they had four children: [[Clara de Hirsch|Claire]] (1833–1899), Regine (1834–?), [[Ferdinand Bischoffsheim|Ferdinand Raphaël]] (1837–1909), and Hortense Henriette (1843–1901).

==Career==
In 1827, he co-founded the bank of ''Bischoffsheim &amp; Goldschmidt''. He played an important role for the finances and the institutions during the early years of Belgian independence. Bisschoffsheim was a Director of the ''Banque de Belgique'' and was one of the founders of the [[National Bank of Belgium]], the regional tramways and managed the Communal Credit (Dutch: ''Gemeentekrediet''; French: ''Credit Communal'') and the ''Caisse Generale d'Epargne et de Retraite'' (CGER or ASLK).

Together with his brother [[Louis-Raphaël Bischoffsheim]] (1800–1873), he founded the bank which eventually developed into [[Paribas]] bank. From 1862 until 1883, he was also a Liberal member of the Belgian Parliament, and as such was influential in the development of the public education network.

When Scania's former main investor [[Investor AB]] in the year of 2000 agreed that Scania AB would merge with their biggest competitor [[Volvo Trucks]], Östling opposed that merger, just as in the fall of 2006 he had opposed German [[MAN SE|MAN's]] plans to buy Scania AB.&lt;ref name="Sveriges TV" /&gt; When the [[EU Commission]], referring to the [[European Union competition law]] ([[Volvo Trucks]] / [[Scania AB]] would practically have a monopoly on the truck market in the [[Nordic countries]]), stopped the merger between [[Volvo Trucks]] and [[Scania AB]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Commission prohibits Volvo's acquisition of its main competitor Scania|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-00-257_en.htm|publisher=European Commission, EU|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Östling won that battle and was able, with support from Scania's new owner [[Volkswagen]],  to remain in Scania as [[CEO]]. Also, the [[MAN SE]] bid for takeover was rejected by the main shareholders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scania shareholders reject MAN bid|url=https://www.ft.com/content/346cd5a0-467a-11db-ac52-0000779e2340|publisher=Finacial Times|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scania board members reject VW-bid - Radio Sweden|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=5812440|publisher=Sveriges Radio|accessdate=8 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Östling could continue as CEO after the Annual general meeting in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scania Minutes of the general meeting|url=https://www.scania.com/group/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/09/Scania_AGM2007_Minutes__tcm10-164981_tcm40-50041.pdf|publisher=Scania|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In 2017 Östling participated in the [[SVT]] TV program ''[[Uppdrag granskning]]'', which showed that he had placed money abroad to avoid [[Taxation in Sweden|Swedish taxation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Svenskt Näringslivs ordförande har förmögenhet utomlands|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/granskning/ug/svenskt-naringslivs-ordforande-har-formogenhet-utomlands|publisher=SVT|accessdate=8 April 2018|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swedish business boss steps down in 'what do I get for my taxes' row|url=https://www.thelocal.se/20171122/swedish-business-boss-leif-ostling-steps-down-in-what-do-i-get-for-my-tax-money-row|publisher=The Local|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also his comment in connection with that, "Here you pay 20-30 million a year, what the hell do I get for the money?", was considered inappropriate from a chairman of the [[Confederation of Swedish Enterprise]].&lt;ref name=Reuters /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swedish Business Chairman Resigns Amid Paradise Papers Link|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/swedish-business-chairman-leif-ostling-resigns-amid-paradise-papers-link/|publisher=ICIJ|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Svenskt Näringslivs ordf: Vad fan får jag?|url=https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/kqz5k/svenskt-naringslivs-ordf-vad-fan-far-jag|publisher=Aftonbladet|accessdate=8 April 2018|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Östling commented later on the following discussion with "We have got a very narrow sense of corridor in Sweden if all political parties consider the political system to have unlimited taxation rights without the right of citizens to question how the money is used."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Industrinestorn talar ut om hoten|url=https://weekend.di.se/intervjuer/industrinestorn-talar-ut-om-hoten|publisher=Di Weekend|accessdate=8 April 2018|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Östling has said that he believes it is "genetically conditioned" that so few women enter the engineering profession. He has also expressed his belief that the threat of [[global warming]] has been exaggerated and that the phenomenon is possibly caused by natural processes, which completely opposes the consensus in the research community that the current climate change is caused by human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sju klassiska Leif Östling-citat|url=https://www.svd.se/sju-klassiska-leif-ostling-citat#sida-3|publisher=SvD|accessdate=8 April 2018|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific consensus: Earth's climate is warming|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/|publisher=Global Climate Change, Nasa|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prizes and awards==
*In 2003, he was awarded an honorary doctorate at [[KTH|KTH, Stockholm]] and at [[Luleå University of Technology|Luleå University of Technology, Luleå]].&lt;ref name=NSD /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of honorary doctors at Luleå University of Technology since 1981|url=https://www.ltu.se/research/akh/Hedersdoktorer/Forteckning-over-hedersdoktorer-vid-Lulea-tekniska-universitet-sedan-1981-1.96410?l=en|publisher=Luleå University of Technology|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honorary doctors at KTH|url=https://www.kth.se/en/om/fakta/fame/hedersdoktorer/hedersdoktorer-vid-kth-1.3974|publisher=KTH|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lingfield Point''' is a {{convert|107|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[business park]] in [[Darlington]], [[County Durham]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lingfieldpoint.co.uk Lingfield Point website]&lt;/ref&gt; created on a historic industrial site previously home to Europe's largest [[wool]] manufacturing plant developed by [[Patons and Baldwins]].

==History==
[[Patons and Baldwins]] built their new wool factory at Lingfield Point immediately after the [[Second World War]]. Construction started on the new factory in August 1945. The aim was to create a flagship manufacturing base for the knitting yarn company. The {{convert|107|acre|km2|adj=on}} site {{convert|2|mi|km}} to the east of the town centre was located next to the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] line, providing the factory with its own railway sidings. 

By 1951 this wool factory was completed at a cost of £7.5m. At over {{convert|2000000|sqft|m2}} this was one of the largest wool factories in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.thisisthenortheast.co.uk/2001/9/24/159098.html Great yarn of knitting giant's rise and fall]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
{{convert|2|mi|km}} east of [[Darlington]], Lingfield Point is located off the new Eastern Transport Corridor,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darlington.gov.uk/Living/Planning+and+Building+Control/Planning+Services/Projects+and+Schemes/EasternTransportCorridor.htm Darlington Borough Council - Eastern Transport Corridor]&lt;/ref&gt; giving immediate access to the [[A66 road (England)|A66]] (East/West) which in turn links to J57, [[A1(M)]] South, a couple of miles from the [[A167 road (Great Britain)|A167]] which links to J59, A1(M) North.

Lingfield Point is now only minutes away from the region's extensive road network; 5 minutes from [[Darlington railway station]] – operating on the [[East Coast Main Line]] with over 30 trains per day to [[London]] and [[Edinburgh]] and {{convert|4|mi|km}} from [[Durham Tees Valley Airport]].

==Modern Transformation==
60 years later property developers [[Marchday]] transformed this manufacturing base into a large [[business park]] – one of the largest employment bases in the [[Tees Valley]] employing over 2500 people.  Now owned by Clearbell, it is home to over 50 businesses and offers space from {{convert|270|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} to 150,000+ sqft. Lingfield Point has been recognised by winning a number of national and specialist awards including the British Council of Offices Recycled/Refurbished workspace award&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/4670331.Award_for_revamped_wool_works/ The Northern Echo - Student Loans Company in the Memphis building, Lingfield Point, named best refurbished/recycled workplace in UK]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009 and previous winners of the [[Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors]] (RICS) national property management award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/archive/2004/07/13/The+North+East+Archive/6984804.Marchday_group_wins_property_management_award/ The Northern Echo - Marchday group wins property management award]&lt;/ref&gt;

Creativity is set to continue around the 90-acre site thanks to ongoing investment.  Lingfield Point hopes to become a flagship for successful regeneration in the North East – continuing to position Darlington as a great base for business.

A new £100m masterplan will see the creation of a flagship, sustainable mixed community built around the existing business community providing up to 1300 homes, sports facilities, a school, healthcare facilities and public, green open space.

Over {{convert|250000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of office space has been let at Lingfield Point in the last five years and more than 2500 people currently work at the business park.

[[Thai royal and noble titles#Ladies|Thanpuying]] '''Lursakdi Sampatisiri''' (20 February 1919{{spaced ndash}}9 November 2010; {{lang-th|เลอศักดิ์ สมบัติศิริ}}; {{RTGS|Loesak Sombatsiri}}; {{IPA-th|lɤːsàk sǒmbàtsìrì}}) was the daughter of [[Nai Lert|Nai Lert Sreshthaputa]] and the only heir of the business and real estate empire, founded in 1894, known as Nai Lert Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Legacy Lives On|url=http://www.nailertpark.com/the-legacy-lives-on.html|website=www.nailertpark.com|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nailertgroup.com/ Nai Lert Group website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210221650/http://nailertgroup.com/ |date=10 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of [[Thailand|Thailand’s]] most prominent businesswomen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wives, Mistresses and Matriarchs: Asian Women Today |author=Louise Williams|url=http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Wives-Mistresses-and-Matriarchs/Louise-Williams/e/9780847691395/?itm=1|year=1999|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.]]|isbn=978-0-8476-9139-5|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sampatisiri created one of the first international hotels in Bangkok, The [[Hilton International|Hilton International Bangkok]] at Nai Lert Park. Today the hotel is known as [[Swissôtel Nai Lert Park Hotel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luxury Hotels &amp; Resorts – Swissotel|url=http://www.swissotel.com|website=www.swissotel.com|accessdate=11 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bangkok, and remains the flagship of the real estate portfolio of the group.

==Early years==
When Sampatisiri was a young woman (1930s), her father sent her to Japan, because he predicted that economic power would be centered there in her generation. She could only attend a college as Japanese universities did not accept women at that time. When she returned to Thailand, her father send her to work for the Office of [[Civil Servants]] Commission to find out how the Government worked. After three years of Government service, she returned to the family business, living, as she describes herself, a "life of privilege, rather than family duty, within Thailand's small economic elite" even though she had many responsibilities as sole heir.

Sampatisiri's father died suddenly, when she was 27 years old, and she found herself at the helm of his business empire which included the White Bus Company which dominated the Bangkok's transport routes (including its canals) and the ice factories which supplied the majority of the city's population. When Sampatisiri took over she became the first and only female in the company, but she convinced the managers to stay and keep the company going. 

In 1930, she married Khun Binich Sampatisiri, who himself came from a prestigious background of public service. His father, Srisena Sampatisiri, served as ambassador to Japan and other countries in the 1930s and 1940s and was [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Thailand)|Thailand's Foreign Minister]] from 1944 to 1945, after which he served as [[Ministry of Interior (Thailand)|Minister of Interior]] in the 14th Thai Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The secretariat of the Cabinet|url=http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/cab_11.htm|website=www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th |accessdate=11 June 2017 |archivedate=14 January 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030114191457/http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/cab_11.htm |date=14 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/cab_11.htm Thai Government 11th Cabinet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605013006/http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/cab_11.htm |date=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The secretariat of the Cabinet|url=http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/cab_14.htm|website=www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th|accessdate=11 June 2017 |archivedate=14 January 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030114192540/http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/cab_14.htm |date=14 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khun Binich, himself, served as the Chief of the Traditional Arts Division of the [[Department of Fine Arts (Thailand)|Department of Fine Arts]] at the [[Ministry of Education (Thailand)|Ministry of Education]] for The [[Royal Thai Government]] and was a frequent host to overseas visitors and celebrities, being known for his sense of hospitality and entertainment (US comic [[Joey Adams]] mentions his encounter with Khun Binich in his book ''On The Road for Uncle Sam'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Joey|title=On the road for Uncle Sam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BkBKAAAAMAAJ|year=1963|publisher=B. Geis Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First woman in government ==
Seeing the coming of refrigeration, Lursakdi shifted her focus to transport. Unfortunately and suddenly, in 1975, the carefully-planned expansion of the transport business was swept away overnight by the chaos of Thai politics. After the government nationalized the Bangkok bus companies, which included the family run White Bus Company, Lursakdi, then [[Khunying]] Lursakdi, was invited by [[Thanin Kraivichien]], appointed Prime Minister by Royal Decree of [[King Rama IX]] on 8 October 1976, to join his cabinet as Minister of Transport thus making her the first female Minister in a Thai Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Cabinet |url=http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/cab_39.htm |website=www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th |accessdate=11 June 2017 |archivedate=14 January 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030114193032/http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/cab_39.htm |date=14 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catering to the legacy==
Lursakdi was, most recently, the chairperson of the business group that bears her father's name and also of the Lerd-Sinn Foundation which was created by her mother, Khunying Sinn, after the death of her father. The Lerd-Sinn Foundation, among other charitable activities, donated the proceeds used to build the Lerdsin hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lerdsin Hospital|url=http://www.lerdsin.go.th/en/1.html|website=www.lerdsin.go.th|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lerdsin.go.th/ Lerdsin Hospital website]&lt;/ref&gt; She represented the first of three generations of women who shaped the Nai Lert Park hotel in Bangkok and provided the strategic direction of the Nai Lert Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/option/print.php?newsid=30078449 The Nation, 19 July 2008, Catering to a Legacy]{{deadlink|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her daughters, Bilhaiban Sampatisiri and Sanhapit Bodiratnangkura, as well as her granddaughter, Naphaporn Bodiratnangkura, were also engaged in the family business.

'''''Market Wizards''''' is a book written by [[Jack D. Schwager]] and published in 1989 in which he interviews a wide range of [[trader (finance)|traders]] with excellent track records of profitability.

The book contains four parts covering interviews with traders in a wide range of markets. The interviews contain a mixture of facts about the trading careers of the interviewees, their philosophy, and many trading anecdotes. After each of the interviews, Schwager summarises what he believes are the key things to be learned from that particular trader. The book also contains a fifth part on the psychology of trading and two appendices on [[program trading]] and basic options theory. ''If you want to get some insights, by way of verbatim interviews, into the thought processes and trading rules.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first= Stanley W| last= Angrist| publisher= The Wall Street Journal |title= Business Bookshelf: Secrets of the Super Traders | date=1989-07-24| url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/wsj/access/27544764.html?dids=27544764:27544764&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Jul+24%2C+1989&amp;author=By+Stanley+W.+Angrist&amp;type=1995_1984&amp;desc=Business+Bookshelf%3A+Secrets+of+the+Super+Traders }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those profiled in this book are [[Ed Seykota]], [[Bruce Kovner]], [[Paul Tudor Jones]], [[Michael Steinhardt]], [[Van K. Tharp]] and [[Jim Rogers|James B. Rogers]].

== Traders Interviews ==
Schwager kicks off the series of interviews—and hence the investigation into their thought process—by talking to a man he describes as one of the pioneers of commodity trading—[[Michael Marcus (trader)|Michael Marcus]] of ''Canmarc Trading Co''. His discussion with Marcus is typical of the book as a whole. The reader effectively eavesdrops on a conversation between the two men that starts with how Marcus got into the business and continues through subjects such as the skill necessary to become a good trader.

== Follow-up books ==
After the success of ''Market Wizards'', Schwager in 1992 released a second book, ''[[The New Market Wizards]]'', in 2001 a third book, ''Stock Market Wizards'', and in 2012 his latest book, ''Hedge Fund Market Wizards''.

'''Mary Harriman Rumsey''' (November 17, 1881 – December 18, 1934) was the founder of The Junior League for the Promotion of Settlement Movements, later known as the Junior League of the City of New York of the [[Junior League|Association of Junior Leagues International Inc]].  Mary was the daughter of railroad magnate [[E.H. Harriman]] and sister to [[W. Averell Harriman]], former New York State Governor and United States Diplomat. In 2015 she was posthumously inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=October 3, 2015 |url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2015/10/03/womens-national-hall-of-fame-seneca-falls-2015/73236506/ |title=10 women honored at Hall of Fame induction |publisher=Democratandchronicle.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Mary Harriman Rumsey was born on November 17, 1881, the oldest of six children of railroad industrialist [[E.H. Harriman]] (1848–1909) and his wife, [[Mary Averell Harriman]] (1851–1932).&lt;ref name=McHenry&gt;{{cite book|last1=McHenry|first1=Robert|title=Famous American Women: A Biographical Dictionary from Colonial Times to the Present|date=1980|publisher=Dover|location=New York|isbn=0-486-24523-3|page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her siblings were Henry Neilson Harriman (1883–1888), Cornelia Harriman (1884–1966), who married [[Robert Livingston Gerry, Sr.|Robert Livingston Gerry]] (1877–1957),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1908/03/04/archives/miss-harriman-bride-of-robert-l-gerry-grace-church-so-crowded-by.html New York Times article dated March 4, 1908]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=tNQpAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Robert+livingston+Gerry+1877+1957&amp;dq=Robert+livingston+Gerry+1877+1957&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjenp2D5cPeAhUosFQKHeD7CFIQ6AEIMDAB ''EL Harriman at Arden Farms'']&lt;/ref&gt; Carol Averell Harriman (1889–1948), who married R.

Roland Harriman|Edward Roland Noel Harriman]] (1895–1978), who married [[Gladys Fries Harriman|Gladys Fries]] (1896–1983).

Mary attended [[Barnard College]], where she specialized in sociology and was a member of [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]].

== Career ==
=== The Junior League ===
[[Image:Rumsey, Charles, Mary, children.jpg|thumb|Charles, Mary Averell, Mary, Charles Jr., c.1919]]
Inspired by a lecture on the [[settlement movement]], Mary, along with several friends, began volunteering at the College Settlement on Rivington Street in New York City's [[Lower East Side]], a large immigrant enclave.  Through her work at the College Settlement, Mary became convinced that there was more she could do to help others.  Subsequently, Mary and a group of 80 debutantes established the Junior League for the Promotion of Settlement Movements in 1901, while she was still a student at Barnard College.  The purpose of the Junior League would be to unite interested debutantes in joining the Settlement Movement in New York City.

Realizing their lack of experience in dealing with the issues that faced people seeking help at the settlement house, Mary and League leaders brought together experts on the Settlement Movement to provide lectures and instruction to Junior League members.  With better preparation came greater engagement leading to increased interest in membership by women notable in New York society; members would come to include [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Dorothy Payne Whitney|Dorothy Whitney Straight]] and [[Ruth Draper]].

As word of the work of the young Junior League women in New York spread, women throughout the country and beyond formed Junior Leagues in their communities.  In time, Leagues would expand their efforts beyond settlement house work to respond to the social, health and educational issues of their respective communities. In 1921, approximately 30 Leagues banded together to form the Association of Junior Leagues of America to provide support to one another. With the creation of the Association, it was Mary that insisted that although it was important for all Leagues to learn from one another and share best practices, each League was ultimately beholden to its respective community and should thus function to serve that community’s needs.

As the 20th century progressed, more Junior Leagues were formed throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom.  Now known as the [[Association of Junior Leagues International Inc.]] (AJLI), the organization encompasses 292 member Leagues, with over 160,000 members committed to continuing the legacy established by its founder.

===Consumer Advisory Board===
In 1933, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] appointed Mary to chair the Consumer Advisory Board (CAB) of the [[National Recovery Administration]] (NRA), the first government consumer rights group.&lt;ref name="McHenry" /&gt;

Despite her inexperience, Mary's work with farming cooperatives and belief in the power of cooperation would come to be her greatest assets.  Mary would promote the formation of consumer groups across the nation and encourage these groups to report their grievances to her office.

Mary Rumsey's legacy to New Deal reforms would be continued by her younger brother, [[W. Averell Harriman]].  Averell was encouraged by his older sister to leave his finance job and join her and their friends, the Roosevelts, to advance the goals of the New Deal.  Averell joined the NRA, marking the beginning of his political career.

== Personal life ==
In 1910, Mary married sculptor and polo player [[Charles Cary Rumsey]] (1879–1922), shortly after the death of her father on September 9, 1909. Rumsey had been working at Arden House, creating one of the principal fireplace surrounds, as well as other decorative sculpture. By all accounts, the two had a happy marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://portwashington-news.com/mary-harriman-rumsey-a-woman-ahead-of-her-time/|title=Mary Harriman Rumsey: A woman ahead of her time|date=2015-09-07|work=Port Washington News|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they had a daughter and two sons.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

==== San Francisco Gas ====
In the 1850s, [[manufactured gas]] was introduced in the United States as a means of lighting. [[Gasworks]] were built in the larger eastern American cities, but there was no gas industry in the West, however. In San Francisco, street lighting was available only on Merchant Street, in the form of oil lamps.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|11}}&lt;ref name="PGE_1909"&gt;{{citation |title=The History of Gas Lighting in San Francisco |work=Pacific Gas and Electric Magazine |volume=1 |number=3 |date=August 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three brothers—Peter, James, and Michael Donahue—became interested in gas manufacturing while running the foundry that later became [[Union Iron Works]], the largest shipbuilding operation on the West Coast.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|11}}&lt;ref name=Wiley&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rbAFNxPiVmcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=National+Trust+Guide/San+Francisco:+America's+Guide+for+Architecture+and+History+Travelers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wFnOT-mjHoTs2QXlvKnODA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=National%20Trust%20Guide%2FSan%20Francisco%3A%20America's%20Guide%20for%20Architecture%20and%20History%20Travelers&amp;f=false |title=National Trust Guide/San Francisco: America's Guide for Architecture and History Travelers |last=Wiley |first=Peter Booth |year=2000 |publisher=Wiley|isbn=0471191205 |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph G. Eastland, an engineer and clerk at the foundry, joined them in gathering as much information on gas making as they could find. In July 1852, James applied for and received from the [[San Francisco Common Council|Common Council of the City of San Francisco]] a franchise to erect a gasworks, lay pipes in the streets and install street lamps to light the city with "brilliant gas". The council specified that gas should be supplied to households "at such rates as will make it to their interest to use it in preference to any other material".&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|11–12}} The Donahue brothers and Eastland incorporated the San Francisco Gas Company on August 31, 1852, with $150,000 of [[authorized capital]]. The company became the first gas [[utility]] in the West. Its official seal bore the inscription "[[Fiat Lux]]"—let there be light—the same slogan later adopted by the University of California. There were 11 original stockholders, and the three Donahue brothers subscribed for 610 of the 1,500 shares.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|12}}

The original location for the gas works was bounded by First, Fremont, Howard and Natoma streets south of Market, on the then shore of the [[San Francisco Bay]]. Work on the plant started in November, 1852, and it was ready for operation only a few months later. On the night of February 11, 1854, the streets of San Francisco were for the first time lighted by gas. To celebrate the event, the company held a gala banquet at the Oriental Hotel.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|13}} Gas lighting quickly gained public favor. In the first year of operation, there were 237 customers. That number more than doubled the next year, to 563. By the end of 1855, the company had laid more than 6 ½ miles of pipe and 154 street lamps were in operation.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|15}}

The growing popularity of gas light led to the establishment of competing gas companies, including Aubin Patent Gas Company and Citizens Gas Company. These smaller companies were quickly acquired by the San Francisco Gas Company. However, one rival provided serious competition.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|26–30}} The City Gas Company was founded in April 1870 by the [[Bank of California]] to compete with the gas monopoly held by the Donahue brothers' operation.&lt;ref name=Shoup&gt;{{cite book |title=Rulers and Rebels: A People's History of Early California, 1769–1901 |last=Shoup |first=Laurence H. |year=2010 |publisher=iUniverse.com |isbn=1450255906 |page=217 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-wAOHIF1y_IC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=%22one+of+the+largest+and+most+lucrative+monopolies%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yHHQT6ezAYf66gHlz-B7&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22one%20of%20the%20largest%20and%20most%20lucrative%20monopolies%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; City Gas began operation in 1872 and initiated a price war with the San Francisco Gas Company.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|26–30}} In 1873, the companies negotiated their consolidation as a compromise and the Bank of California gained part ownership of "the most lucrative gas monopoly in the West".&lt;ref name=Shoup/&gt; On April 1, 1873, the San Francisco Gas Light Company was formed, representing a merger of the San Francisco Gas Company, the City Gas Company, and the Metropolitan Gas Company.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|26–30}}&lt;ref name=Linenthal&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xt1BeeB_u7cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=San+Francisco's+Potrero+Hill&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8VnOT9SBG6ad2QW8ptnhDA&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=San%20Francisco's%20Potrero%20Hill&amp;f=false |title=San Francisco's Potrero Hill |author= Peter Linenthal and Abigail Johnston |year=2005 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing|ISBN=0-7385-2937-0 |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== San Francisco Gas and Electric ====
Gas utilities, including San Francisco Gas Light, faced new competition with the introduction of electric lighting to California.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|80–82}} According to a 2012 PG&amp;E publication and their 1952 commissioned history, in 1879, San Francisco was the first city in the U.S. to have a central generating station for electric customers.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|59}}&lt;ref name=Timeline /&gt; To stay competitive, the San Francisco Gas Light Company introduced the [[Argand lamp]] that same year. The lamp increased the light capacity of gas street lamps, but proved to be an expensive improvement and was not generally adopted.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|80–82}} Meanwhile, the demand for electric light in the stores and factories of [[downtown San Francisco]] continued to grow. The first electric street light was erected in 1888 in front of [[San Francisco City Hall|City Hall]], and the [[electrical grid]] supporting it was gradually extended. A second generating station was constructed in 1888 by the California Electric Light Company to increase production capacity.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|57–63}}

New competition also emerged in the 1880s in the form of [[water gas]], an improved illuminant patented by [[Thaddeus Lowe]]. The United Gas Improvement Company, a water gas manufacturer organized after purchasing the Lowe gas patents, acquired a lease and then an interest in San Francisco's Central Gas Light Company on November 1, 1883.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|46–48}}&lt;ref name=Cleveland155156&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JPjqRIIWHcoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Concise+Encyclopedia+of+the+History+of+Energy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FVrOT_7BCePq2QXyo8y9DA&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=San%20Francisco's%20Central%20Gas%20Light%20Company&amp;f=false |title=Concise Encyclopedia of the History of Energy |last=Cleveland |first=Cutler J. |year=2009 |publisher=Academic Press |ISBN=0123751179 |pages=155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; United was acquired by the Pacific Gas Improvement Company in 1884. Under the management of president Albert Miller, Pacific Gas Improvement developed into a formidable competitor to San Francisco Gas Light.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|46–48}} Horace A. Miller, Secretary and C. O. G. Miller (Christian Otto Gerberding Miller), President, owned and controlled not only the Pacific Gas Improvement Company but also the Pacific Gas Lighting Company (Pacific Lighting Company). C.O.G. Miller is buried in a Pyramid mausoleum at Mountain View Cemetery, Oakland CA. Horace Miller built an enormous mansion in Piedmont, CA at 445 Mountain Avenue in 1913, designed by Arthur Brown, famous San Francisco architect.

In 1888, San Francisco Gas Light built its own water gas plant at the [[Potrero Point|Potrero gas works]]. The manufacturing of water gas proved successful due to the increased availability of inexpensive petroleum. The company decided to construct a modern gas works with both updated water gas manufacturing technology and a modern coal-gas plant as a hedge against shortages in the supply of oil.&lt;ref name=ECJones&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-tRMAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA542#v=onepage&amp;q=water-gas&amp;f=false |title=The History of Gas-Lighting in San Francisco |last=Jones |first=E.C. |year=1910 |publisher=The Technical Publishing Company |volume=24 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, the North Beach Gas Works was completed under the direction of San Francisco Gas Light president and engineer Joseph B. Crockett. The facility was the largest [[gas holder]] in the U.S. west of Chicago.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|84}}&lt;ref name=ECJones/&gt;

In 1896, the Edison Light and Power Company merged with the San Francisco Gas Light Company to form the new San Francisco Gas and Electric Company.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|71}}Consolidation of gas and electric companies solved problems for both utilities by eliminating competition and producing economic savings through joint operation.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|80–82}} Other companies that began operation as active competitors but eventually merged into the San Francisco Gas and Electric Company included the Equitable Gas Light Company, the Independent Electric Light and Power Company, and the Independent Gas and Power Company.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|90}} In 1903, the company purchased its main competitor for gas lighting, the Pacific Gas Improvement Company.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|46–48}}

=== Pacific Gas and Electric Company ===
[[File:Pacific Gas and Electric Company plant in Sacramento, California (1912).jpg|thumb|right|Pacific Gas and Electric Company plant in Sacramento, 1912]]
According to PG&amp;E's 2012 history timeline on their webpage, the San Francisco Gas and Electric Company and the California Gas and Electric Corporation merged to form the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) on October 10, 1905.&lt;ref name=Timeline&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pgecorp.com/150_non_flash/index.html |title=150 Years of Energy: The History of PG&amp;E Corporation |work=PG&amp;E Website |accessdate=20 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The consolidation provided the California Gas and Electric Corporation with access to the large San Francisco market and a base for further financing. The San Francisco Gas and Electric Company, in turn, was able to reinforce its electric system, which until then had been powered entirely by [[thermal power station|steam-operated generating plants]], and could not compete with lower cost [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]].&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|227–233}} After the merger was formally completed, engineers and management from both organizations formulated plans for coordinating and unifying the two gas and electric systems.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|227–233}} However, the two firms maintained separate corporate identities until 1911.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|227–233}}

PG&amp;E began delivering natural gas to San Francisco and northern California in 1930 through the longest pipeline in the world, connecting the Texas gas fields to northern California with compressor stations that included cooling towers every {{convert|300|mi|km}}, at [[Topock, Arizona]], on the state line, and near the town of [[Hinkley, California]]. With the introduction of natural gas, the company began retiring its polluting gas manufacturing facilities, though it kept some plants on standby. Today there is a network of eight compressor stations linked by "40,000 miles of distribution pipelines and over 6,000 miles of transportation pipelines" serving "4.2 million customers from Bakersfield to the Oregon border."&lt;ref name="PGE_environment_2015"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pge.com/en/about/environment/taking-responsibility/compressor/index.page | title=Compressor Stations Environmental Restoration Activities at Compressor Station Properties | publisher=Pacific Gas and Electricity | date=2015 | accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s, at both Topock and Hinkley compressor stations, [[hexavalent chromium]] in the form of an additive was used in rust-prevention in "the cooling towers that prepared the gas for transportation through PG&amp;E’s pipeline to northern and central California."&lt;ref name="PGE_environment_2015" /&gt; These cooling waters were then disposed of "adjacent to the compressor stations."&lt;ref name="PGE_environment_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="azdeq"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.azdeq.gov/environ/waste/cleanup/topock.html | title=Waste Programs Division: Cleanups: Topock Compressor Station Groundwater VRP Site | publisher=Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (AZDEQ) | date=2015 | accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PG&amp;E was significantly affected by the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]].&lt;ref name="Timeline"/&gt; The company's assorted central offices were damaged by the quake and destroyed by the subsequent fire. Its San Francisco Gas and Electric Company subsidiary in particular suffered significant infrastructure loss, as its distribution systems—miles of gas mains and electric wires—were dissevered.

===Sacramento Electric, Gas and Railway Company===
In 1906, PG&amp;E purchased the Sacramento Electric, Gas and Railway Company and took control of its railway operations in and around [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]].&lt;ref name=Burg&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cEbgbhxPVXYC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=Pacific+Gas+%26+Electric+Company+streetcar+company+sacramento&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JkJL5OLRnG&amp;sig=KCqJ94SA9EskWJPK2aPw6LWOJIA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hI0qUKvEFobciQLPrYEI&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Pacific%20Gas%20%26%20Electric%20Company%20streetcar%20company%20sacramento&amp;f=false |title=Sacramento's Streetcars |last=Burg |first=William |year=2006 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |pages=8, 101 |isbn=0738531472}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sacramento City Street Railway began operating under the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric name in 1915, and its track and services subsequently expanded.&lt;ref name=Burg/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fickewirth&gt;{{cite book |author=Fickewirth, Alvin A. |title=California Railroads |location=[[San Marino, California]] |publisher=[[Golden West Books]] |year=1992 |pages=100, 117 |isbn=0-87095-106-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1931 the Sacramento Street Railway Division operated 75 [[streetcar]]s on {{convert|47|mi|km}} of track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Demoro, Harre W.| title=California's Electric Railways| publisher=[[Interurban Press]]|location=[[Glendale, California]]| year=1986| page=201| isbn=0-916374-74-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; PG&amp;E's streetcars were powered by the company's hydroelectric plant in [[Folsom, California|Folsom]].&lt;ref name=Foster&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midtownmonthly.net/life/sacramento-1910/ |title=Sacramento: 1910: The End of An Era |last=Foster |first=Tim |date=April 1, 2010 |work=Midtown Monthly}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, PG&amp;E sold the rail service to Pacific City Lines, which was later acquired by [[National City Lines]]. Several streetcar lines were soon converted to bus service, and the track was abandoned entirely in 1947.&lt;ref name=Burg/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fickewirth/&gt;

During this same period, Pacific City Lines and its successor, National City Lines, with funding from General Motors, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California (through a subsidiary, Federal Engineering), Phillips Petroleum, and Mack Trucks were buying streetcar lines and rapidly converting most of them to bus service. This consortium was convicted in 1949 of Federal charges involving conspiracy to monopolize interstate commerce in the sale of buses and supplies to National City Lines and its subsidiaries. The actions became known as the [[General Motors streetcar conspiracy|Great American Streetcar Scandal or the General Motors Streetcar Conspiracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intransitionmag.org/archive_stories/streetcar_scandal.aspx|title=Revisiting the Great American Streetcar Scandal|website=www.intransitionmag.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further consolidation and expansion===
[[File:Pacific Gas and Electric Company General Office Building.jpg|upright|thumb|PG&amp;E General Office Building in [[San Francisco]]]]
Within a few years of its incorporation, PG&amp;E made significant inroads into [[Northern California|Northern California's]] hydroelectric industry through purchase of existing water storage and conveyance facilities. These included many reservoirs, dams, ditches and flumes built by mining interests in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierras]] that were no longer commercially viable.&lt;ref name=Larson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceres.ca.gov/snep/pubs/web/PDF/VII_C08.PDF |title=Historical Water-Use Priorities and Public Policies |last=Larson |first=David J.|year=1996 |publisher= Sierra Nevada Ecosystem Project |page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1914, PG&amp;E was the largest integrated utility system on the Pacific Coast. The company handled 26 percent of the electric and gas business in California. Its operations spanned 37,000 square miles across 30 counties.&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g07Q9M4agp4C&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq=Sacramento+Electric+Gas+and+Railway+Company+PG%26E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oDf3T-PsAsbvqwHh6q2LCQ&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Sacramento%20Electric%20Gas%20and%20Railway%20Company%20PG%26E&amp;f=false|title=Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society, 1880–1930 |last=Hughes|first=Thomas Parke |year=2003 |publisher= The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0801846145
|pages=278–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company expanded in the 1920s through strategic consolidation. Important acquisitions during this period included the California Telephone and Light Company, the Western States Gas and Electric Company and the Sierra and San Francisco Power Company, which provided hydropower to San Francisco's streetcars.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|277–283}}&lt;ref name=Arcate&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gOIP7_Qj_XMC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=%22Western+States+Gas+and+Electric+Company%22+PG%26E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_hz3T5fbEojWqgHVhpmLCQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Western%20States%20Gas%20and%20Electric%20Company%22%20PG%26E&amp;f=false|title=On This Day in Arcata |author=Arcata Union, Arcata Eye |year=2008 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |isbn=0738556823 |pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three companies added valuable properties and power and water sources. By the end of 1927, PG&amp;E had nearly one million customers and provided electricity to 300 Northern Californian communities.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|277–283}}

In 1930, PG&amp;E purchased majority stock holdings in two major Californian utility systems—Great Western Power and [[San Joaquin Light and Power Corporation|San Joaquin Light and Power]]—from [[The North American Company]], a New York investment firm. In return, North American received shares of PG&amp;E's common stock worth $114 million. PG&amp;E also gained control of two smaller utilities, Midland Counties Public Service and the Fresno Water Company, which was later sold.&lt;ref name=Brewer&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QowwEAPqiToC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=PG%26E+The+North+American+Company&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bfXtT6arK9TU6QHm-q2bCg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=PG%26E%20The%20North%20American%20Company&amp;f=false|title=Historic Kern County: An Illustrated History of Bakersfield and Kern County |last=Brewer |first=Chris |year=2002|publisher=Historical Pub Network |isbn=1893619141 |pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition of these utilities did not result in an immediate merger of property and personnel. The Great Western Power Company and the San Joaquin Company remained separate corporate entities for several more years. But through this final major consolidation, PG&amp;E soon served nearly all of Northern and [[Central California]] through one integrated system.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|291–298}}

The gas industry market structure was dramatically altered by the discovery of massive natural gas fields throughout the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]] beginning in 1918.&lt;ref name=Cutler&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JPjqRIIWHcoC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=history+of+natural+gas+in+california&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_ei5nzYZ8J&amp;sig=_37MCGIirF7XOHb3DSFJvC-dKIc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vHoAUP60EsTgqgGBzMSkBw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=natural%20gas%20PG%26E%20pipeline&amp;f=false|title=Concise Encyclopedia of the History of Energy |last=Cleveland |first=Cutler J.|year=2009 |publisher= Academic Press |isbn=0123751179|pages=167–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fuel was cleaner than manufactured gas and less expensive to produce.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|299}} While natural gas sources were abundant in Southern California, no economical sources were available in Northern California. In 1929, PG&amp;E constructed a 300-mile pipeline from the [[Kettleman North Dome Oil Field|Kettleman oil field]] to bring natural gas to San Francisco.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|300}}&lt;ref name=OilandGas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftp://ftp.consrv.ca.gov/pub/oil/history/History_of_Calif.pdf |title=Oil and Gas Production: History in California |publisher=State of California Department of Conservation |format=PDF |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city became the first major urban area to switch from manufactured gas to natural gas.&lt;ref name=Cutler/&gt; The transition required the adjustment of burners and airflow valves on 1.75 million appliances.&lt;ref name=Cutler/&gt; In 1936, PG&amp;E expanded distribution with an additional 45-mile pipeline from [[Milpitas]].&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|306}} PG&amp;E gradually retired its gas manufacturing facilities, although some plants were kept on standby.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|304}}

Defense activities boosted natural gas sales in California during [[World War II]], but cut deeply into the state's natural reserves.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|306–307}}&lt;ref name="Brewer"/&gt; In 1947, PG&amp;E entered into a contract with the [[Southern California Gas Company]] and the Southern Counties Gas Company to purchase natural gas through a new 1,000-mile pipeline running from Texas and New Mexico to Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|306–307}} Another agreement was reached with the [[El Paso Corporation|El Paso Natural Gas Company]] of Texas for gas delivery to the California-Arizona border. In 1951, PG&amp;E completed a 502-mile main that connected with the [[El Paso Natural Gas|El Paso network]] at the state line.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|306–307}}

During this period of expansion PG&amp;E was involved in legal proceedings with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] regarding the company's status as a subsidiary of the [[North American Company]]. As outlined by the [[Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935]], a utility subsidiary was defined as a utility company with more than 10% of their stock held by a public utility holding company. Though 17% of PG&amp;E stock was held by the North American Company at this time, PG&amp;E filed with the SEC to be exempted from subsidiary status on the grounds that 17% ownership did not give the North American Company control and because the North American Company occupied only two board member spots.&lt;ref name="Coleman_PGE_1952" /&gt;{{rp|314–316}}&lt;ref name=Phleger&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/sixtyyrsinlawpub00phlerich/sixtyyrsinlawpub00phlerich_djvu.txt |title=Sixty Years in Law, Public Service and International Affairs |last=Phleger |first=Herman |year=1953 |publisher=University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North American Company backed PG&amp;E's request by stating that they were involved in business operations in a limited capacity.&lt;ref name=Bittker&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ntBTyhZydQC&amp;pg=SA5-PA10&amp;lpg=SA5-PA10&amp;dq=North+American+Co.+v.+Securities+and+Exchange+Commission&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5AoWfliN0S&amp;sig=PYKT-1aDz0f3jLsBSQC-UZLGNYY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XwUTUPLiEuiWjALD6ICQDA&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=North%20American%20Co.%20v.%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission&amp;f=false |title=Bittker on the Regulation of Interstate and Foreign Commerce |author=Boris I.

===Nuclear plants and gas pipelines===
In 1957, the company brought online [[Vallecitos Nuclear Center]], the first privately owned and operated [[nuclear reactor]] in the United States, in [[Pleasanton, California]]. The reactor initially produced 5,000 [[kilowatt]]s of power, enough to power a town of 12,000.&lt;ref name=ReadingBee57&gt;{{cite news |title=Atomic Plant Starts Making Electricity |newspaper=The Reading Bee |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cRErAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=m5oFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5174,4827835&amp;dq=pacific+gas+and+electric+company&amp;hl=en |date=October 25, 1957 |accessdate=August 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Price57&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S Lags in Atoms for Peace Race |newspaper=The Milwaukee Sentinel |author=Bem Price |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hnBIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bRAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7257,833085&amp;dq=pacific-gas-and-electric+nuclear&amp;hl=en |date=December 22, 1957 |accessdate=August 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to nuclear power, PG&amp;E continued to develop natural gas supplies as well. In 1959, the company began working to obtain approval for the import of a large quantity of natural gas from [[Alberta]], Canada to California, via a pipeline constructed by [[Westcoast Transmission Co.]] and the Alberta and Southern Gas Company on the Canadian side, and by Pacific Gas Transmission Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E, on the U.S.&amp;nbsp;side.&lt;ref name=Sun59&gt;{{cite news |title=Gas Export Okayed by Alberta Board |newspaper=The Sun |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RIllAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_4kNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=904,4723667&amp;dq=pacific+gas+and+electric+company&amp;hl=en |date=March 24, 1959 |accessdate=August 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spokesman59&gt;{{cite news |title=New Western Gas Pipeline Hearing Set |newspaper=The Spokesman Review |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=w5wzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=y-cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3610,1716849&amp;dq=pacific+gas+and+electric+company&amp;hl=en |date=August 18, 1959 |accessdate=August 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the pipeline lasted 14 months.&lt;ref name=Edmonton62&gt;{{cite news |title=Premier Leads in Dedication of Alberta-California Pipeline |newspaper=The Edmonton Journal |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TP9kAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NoINAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2263,1531058&amp;dq=pacific+gas+and+electric+company&amp;hl=en |date=February 10, 1962 |accessdate=August 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testing began in 1961,&lt;ref name=LeaderPost61&gt;{{cite news |title=Testing gas line |newspaper=The Leader-Post |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XNdlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DTwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5229,888385&amp;dq=pacific+gas+and+electric+company&amp;hl=en |date=December 5, 1961 |accessdate=August 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the completed 1,400-mile pipeline was dedicated in early 1962.&lt;ref name=Edmonton62/&gt;&lt;ref name=LeaderPost62&gt;{{cite news |title=Historic pipeline dedication |newspaper=The Leader-Post |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jtVUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NTwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4462,3180204&amp;dq=pacific+gas+and+electric+company&amp;hl=en |date=February 17, 1962 |accessdate=August 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the construction of the Diablo Canyon plant, PG&amp;E continued its efforts to bring natural gas supplies from the North to their service area in California. In 1972, the company began exploring possibilities for a 3,000-mile pipeline from Alaska, which would travel through the [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie River Valley]] and on to join with the previously constructed pipeline originating in Alberta.&lt;ref name=Ludington72&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. looking northward to meet energy needs |author=Peter Hayes |newspaper=Ludington Daily News |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wNJOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=G0oDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5754,5171427&amp;dq=pacific+gas+and+electric+company&amp;hl=en |date=December 1, 1972 |accessdate=August 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 the great-grandson of PG&amp;E's founder George H. Roe—David Roe published his book entitled ''Dynamos and Virgins'' during the time when there was a growing antinuclear-power movement.&lt;ref name="Roe_1984_Dynamos_and_Virgins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_review_dynamos_1984" /&gt; David Roe, who was an environmentalist and the [[Environmental Defense Fund]]'s West Coast general counsel, "mounted an assault on the longstanding assumption that steady growth in coal- and nuclear-generating capacity was the only solution to the nation's energy needs." He based his arguments on an economic analysis "aimed at showing that a shift to energy conservation and alternative energy sources alone could slake the thirst for electricity."&lt;ref name="Roe_1984_Dynamos_and_Virgins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_review_dynamos_1984" /&gt;

=== Postwar era ===
As of December 1992, PG&amp;E operated 173 electric generating units and 85 generating stations, {{convert|18450|mi|km}} of transmission lines and {{convert|101400|mi|km}} of distribution system.

In 1997, PG&amp;E reorganized as a holding company, PG&amp;E Corporation. It consisted of two subsidiaries—PG&amp;E, the regulated utility, and a non-regulated energy business.

In the later 1990s, under [[electricity market]] [[deregulation]] this utility sold off most of its [[natural gas]] [[power plant]]s. The utility retained all of its [[hydroelectric]] plants, the [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant]] and a few natural gas plants, but the large natural gas plants it sold made up a large portion of its generating capacity. This had the effect of requiring the utility to buy power from the energy generators at fluctuating prices, while being forced to sell the power to consumers at a fixed cost. However, the market for electricity was dominated by the [[Enron Corporation]], which, with help from other corporations, artificially pushed prices for electricity ever higher. This led to the [[California electricity crisis]] that began in 2000 on [[Path 15]], a transmission corridor PG&amp;E built.

With a critical power shortage, rolling blackouts began on January 17, 2001.

=== Bankruptcy ===
{{Main|California electricity crisis}}
In 1998, a change in the regulation of California's public utilities, including PG&amp;E, began. The California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) set the rates that PG&amp;E could charge customers and required them to provide as much power as the customers wanted at rates set by the CPUC.

In the summer of 2001 a drought in the northwest states and in California reduced the amount of hydroelectric power available. Usually PG&amp;E could buy "cheap" hydroelectric power under long term contracts with the [[Bonneville Dam]], etc. Drought and delays in approval of new power plants and [[market manipulation]] decreased available electric power generation capacity that could be generated in state or bought under long term contracts out of state. Hot weather brought on higher usage, [[rolling blackout]]s. etc.

With little excess generating capacity of its own PG&amp;E was forced to buy electricity out of state from suppliers without long term contracts. Because PG&amp;E had to buy additional electricity to meet demand some suppliers took advantage of this requirement and manipulated the market by creating artificial shortages and charged very high electrical rates. The CPUC refused to adjust the allowable electric rates. Unable to change rates and sell electricity to consumers for what it cost them on the open market PG&amp;E started hemorrhaging cash.

PG&amp;E Company (the utility, not the holding company) entered bankruptcy under [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] on April 6, 2001. The state of California tried to bail out the utility and provide power to PG&amp;E's 5.1 million customers under the same rules that required the state to buy electricity at market rate high cost to meet demand and sell it at lower fixed price, and as a result, the state also lost significant amounts of money.

The crisis cost PG&amp;E and the state somewhere between $40 and $45 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Weare, Christopher (2003); ''The California Electricity Crisis: Causes and Policy Options''; p. 3–4; San Francisco: Public Policy Institute of California; {{ISBN|1-58213-064-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence that this crisis played an important part in the eventual [[2003 California recall|recall]] of [[Governor of California|California Governor]] [[Gray Davis]].

PG&amp;E Company, the utility, emerged from bankruptcy in April 2004, after paying $10.2 billion to its hundreds of creditors. As part of the reorganization, PG&amp;E's 5.1 million electricity customers will have to pay above-market prices for several years to cancel the debt.

== Generation portfolio ==
PG&amp;E's utility-owned generation portfolio consists of an extensive hydroelectric system, one operating nuclear power plant, one operating natural gas-fired power plant, and another gas-fired plant under construction. Two other plants owned by the company have been permanently removed from commercial operation: Humboldt Bay Unit 3 (nuclear) and Hunters Point (natural gas).

=== Hydroelectric ===
PG&amp;E is the largest private owner of hydroelectric facilities in the United States including 174 dams. According to the company's [[Form 10-K]] filing for 2011, "The Utility’s hydroelectric system consists of 110 generating units at 68 powerhouses, including the Helms pumped storage facility, with a total generating capacity of 3,896 MW&amp;nbsp;... The system includes 99 reservoirs, 56 diversions, 174 dams, 172 miles of canals, 43 miles of flumes, 130 miles of tunnels, 54 miles of pipe (penstocks, siphons and low head pipes), and 5 miles of natural waterways."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=PG&amp;E Corporation |title=10-K Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2011 |date=February 16, 2012 |page=22 |accessdate=July 14, 2012 |url=http://services.corporate-ir.net/SEC/Document.Service?id=P3VybD1odHRwOi8vaXIuaW50Lndlc3RsYXdidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vZG9jdW1lbnQvdjEvMDAwMTE5MzEyNS0xMi0wNjU1MzcvZG9jL1BHRUNvcnBvcmF0aW9uXzEwS18yMDEyMDIxNi5wZGYmdHlwZT0yJmZuPVBHRUNvcnBvcmF0aW9uXzEwS18yMDEyMDIxNi5wZGY=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The single largest component is the [[Helms Pumped Storage Plant]], located at {{Coord|37|02|13.78|N|118|57|53.63|W|name=Helms Pumped Storage Plant}} near [[Sawmill Flat, California|Sawmill Flat]] in [[Fresno County, California]]. Helms consists of three units, each rated at 404&amp;nbsp;MW, for a total output of 1,212&amp;nbsp;MW. The facility operates between Courtright and [[Wishon Dam|Wishon reservoir]]s, alternately draining water from Courtright to produce electricity when demand is high, and pumping it back into Courtright from Wishon when demand is low. The Haas [[Power station|Powerhouse]] is situated more than {{convert|1000|ft|m}} inside a solid granite mountain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vtsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=popular+mechanics+atomic+submarine&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PC7aTMvrN8Wt8Ab6z6jTCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Powerhouse Inside Mountain has Six Mile Waterfall", March 1959, ''Popular Mechanics''] the Haas Powerhouse at the Wishon Reservoir&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nuclear ===
The [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant]], located in Avila Beach, California, is the only operating nuclear asset owned by PG&amp;E. The maximum output of this power plant is 2,240&amp;nbsp;MWe, provided by two equally sized units. As designed and licensed, it could be expanded to four units, at least doubling its generating capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Statement made repeatedly by [[Bill Wattenburg|Dr. Bill Wattenburg]] during his weekly radio show in 2007 and 2008, broadcast on radio station [[KGO (AM)|KGO]] out of San Francisco, California.&lt;/ref&gt; Over a two-week period in 1981, 1,900 activists were arrested at Diablo Canyon Power Plant. It was the largest arrest in the history of the U.S. [[Anti-nuclear movement in California|anti-nuclear movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-168285572.html|title=Conservation Fallout: Nuclear Protest at Diablo Canyon|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, PG&amp;E announced that it plans to close Diablo Canyon in 2025. This will make California free of operating commercial nuclear power plants, but will mean the loss of 2256 MW of generation that produced over 18,000 GWh of electricity per year.

The company operated the [[Humboldt Bay Nuclear Power Plant|Humboldt Bay Power Plant, Unit 3]] in [[Eureka, California]]. It is the oldest commercial nuclear plant in California and its maximum output was 65&amp;nbsp;MWe. The plant operated for 13 years, until 1976 when it was shut down for seismic retrofitting. New regulations enacted after the [[Three Mile Island accident]], however, rendered the plant unprofitable and it was never restarted. Unit 3 is currently in decommissioning phase. Based on PG&amp;E’s schedule of planned decommissioning activities, which incorporates various assumptions, including approval of its proposed new scope, decommissioning of the Unit 3 site is expected to conclude in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M088/K640/88640387.PDF|title= Decision D1402024 - Adopts Phase 1 of the Triennial Review of Nuclear Decommissioning Costs and Activities as related to Huboldt Bay Power Plant Unit 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spent nuclear fuel is currently stored at the [[Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation]] (ISFSI) on the plant site because of the [[United States Department of Energy]]'s failure to find a suitable alternative to storing or disposing of the spent fuel.

[[Pacific Gas &amp; Electric]] planned to build the first commercially viable [[nuclear power plant]] in the United States at Bodega Bay, a fishing village fifty miles north of [[San Francisco]]. The proposal was controversial and conflict with local citizens began in 1958.&lt;ref name=well&gt;Paula Garb.[http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_6/wellockvol6.htm Critical Masses: Opposition to Nuclear Power in California, 1958–1978 (book review)] ''Journal of Political Ecology'', Vol 6, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, there was a large demonstration at the site of the proposed [[Bodega Bay Nuclear Power Plant]].&lt;ref name=ota&gt;Office of Technology Assessment.

=== Combustion  ===

Built in 1956, there are two natural gas/fuel oil units at [[Humboldt Bay Power Plant]] that produce 105&amp;nbsp;MWe of combined output. These units, along with two 15&amp;nbsp;MWe Mobile Emergency Power Plants (MEPPs), will be retired in the summer of 2010. The [[Humboldt Bay Generating Station]], built on the same site, is set to take the older power plant's place in the summer of 2010.{{update inline|date=April 2013}} It will be producing 163&amp;nbsp;MWe using natural gas for fuel and fuel oil for backup on [[Wärtsilä]] Diesel engines. It will employ technology to produce 80 percent fewer ozone precursors and 30 percent less CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than the previous facility. The new design will also reduce water use by eliminating the need for "once-through" cooling.

As part of a settlement with [[Mirant|Mirant Services LLC]] for alleged market manipulations during the 2001 [[California electricity crisis|California energy crisis]], PG&amp;E took ownership of a partially constructed natural gas unit in [[Antioch, California]]. The 530&amp;nbsp;MW unit, known as the Gateway Generating Station, was completed by PG&amp;E and placed into operation in 2009.

On May 15, 2006, after a long and bitter political battle, PG&amp;E shut down its 48-year-old [[Hunters Point Power Plant]] in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208221052/http://www.baaqmd.gov/~/media/Files/Communications+and+Outreach/Publications/News+Releases/2006/pge_060515.ashx?la=en|title=Wayback Machine|date=8 December 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of closure, the maximum output of the plant was 170&amp;nbsp;MW. Residents of the impoverished neighborhood had been pushing for more than a decade to close the plant, claiming it contributed to above average rates of asthma and other ailments.

PG&amp;E broke ground in 2008 on a 660&amp;nbsp;MW natural gas power plant located in Colusa County. It began operation in December 2010, and serves nearly half a million residences using the latest technology and environmental design.{{update inline|date=April 2013}} The plant will use dry cooling technology to dramatically reduce water usage, and cleaner-burning turbines to reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 35 percent relative to older plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colusa-sun-herald.com/news/-2039--.html|title=PG&amp;E charges ahead|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar ===
On April 1, 2008, PG&amp;E announced contracts to buy three new [[solar power plants in the Mojave Desert]]. With an output of 500&amp;nbsp;MW and options for another 400&amp;nbsp;MW, the three installations will initially generate enough electricity to power more than 375,000 residences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/04/01/BUA1VTCJT.DTL PG&amp;E backs 3 solar plants in the Mojave] by David R. Baker, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', April 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, PG&amp;E's ''Next100'' blog reported that PG&amp;E was asking the California Public Utilities Commission to approve a project by the company [[Solaren]] to deliver 200 megawatts of power to California from space. This method of obtaining electricity from the sun eliminates (mostly) the darkness of night experienced from solar sites on the surface of the earth. According to PG&amp;E spokesman Jonathan Marshall, energy purchase costs are expected to be similar to other renewable energy contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415122120/http://www.next100.com/2009/04/space-solar-power-the-next-fro.php |url=http://www.next100.com/2009/04/space-solar-power-the-next-fro.php |archivedate=April 15, 2009 |accessdate=July 22, 2013 |title=Space Solar Power: The Next Frontier? |work=Next100 |publisher=Pacific Gas &amp; Electric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== PG&amp;E and the environment ==
Beginning in the mid-1970s, regulatory and political developments began to push utilities in California away from a traditional business model. In 1976, the California State Legislature amended the Warren-Alquist Act,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-140-2005-001/CEC-140-2005-001-ED2.PDF Full text of the Warren-Alquist Act, see section 25524.2]&lt;/ref&gt; which created and gives legal authority to the [[California Energy Commission]], to effectively prohibit the construction of new nuclear power plants. The [[Environmental Defense Fund]] (EDF) filed as an intervenor in PG&amp;E's 1978 General Rate Case (GRC), claiming that the company's requests for rate increases were based on unrealistically high projections of load growth. Furthermore, EDF claimed that PG&amp;E could more cost-effectively encourage industrial co-generation and energy efficiency than build more power plants. As a result of EDF's involvement in PG&amp;E's rate cases, the company was eventually fined $50 million by the California Public Utilities Commission for failing to adequately implement energy efficiency programs.

Since Darbee took control of the PG&amp;E Company in 2004, PG&amp;E has aggressively promoted its environmental image through a variety of programs and campaigns.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In the early first decade of the 21st century, the CEO of PG&amp;E Corporation, [[Peter Darbee]], and then-CEO of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company, Tom King, publicly announced their support for [[Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006|California Assembly Bill 32]], a measure to cap statewide greenhouse gas emissions and a 25% reduction of emissions by 2020. The bill was signed into law by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on September 27, 2006.

In 2014 PG&amp;E had a [[Renewable portfolio standard#California|renewables mix]] of 28%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=8323|title=Biennial RPS Program Update Section 913.6 Report - January 2016 - Page 5.|publisher=[[California Public Utilities Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, 32.9% of PG&amp;E's power sources were renewable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tarantola|first1=Andrew|title=California is set to hit its green-energy goals a decade early|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/20/california-green-energy-goal-2020/|accessdate=27 December 2017|publisher=Engadget|date=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PG&amp;E's Community Pipeline Safety Initiative (CPSI) essentially cut down hundreds of thousands of trees in California from Eureka to Bakersfield along their nearly 7,000 miles of gas transmission pipeline. PG&amp;E did not conduct a CEQA review in any of these cities, and the total number of trees removed is known only to PG&amp;E.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

During 2017, PG&amp;E announced that 80% of the company's delivered electricity comes from GHG-free sources, including renewables, nuclear, and hydropower. Around 33% comes from renewable sources, thus meeting California's goal of 33% of electricity coming from renewables by 2020, nearly three years in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lillian|first1=Betsy|title=PG&amp;E Hits California’s Renewables Goal Years Ahead Of Schedule|url=https://nawindpower.com/pge-hits-californias-renewables-goal-years-ahead-schedule|website=North American Wind Power|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2013 PG&amp;E had cleaned up 54 acres, but it is estimated the remediation process will take another 40 years. PG&amp;E built a concrete wall barrier that is about a half-mile-long to contain the plume, pump ethanol into the ground to convert chromium-6 into chromium-3, and have planted acres of alfalfa.&lt;ref name="scienceforsale_PBS_2013" /&gt; They created a chicken farm to use the alfalfa. PG&amp;E uses irrigation to maintain these large circles of green in the otherwise desert area, and was asked to stop because of the ongoing danger of residents inhaling chromium 6.&lt;ref name="scienceforsale_PBS_2013" /&gt;

In 2015 the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Lahontan Region served PG&amp;E with a new order "to cleanup &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; and abate the effects of the discharge of chromium waste or threatened pollution or nuisance."&lt;ref name="CWQCB_2015"/&gt; By the time of the report the plume had expanded to "8 miles in length and approximately 2 miles in width, throughout the Hinkley Valley and into Harper Dry Lake Valley", polluting new areas.&lt;ref name="scienceforsale_PBS_2013"&gt;{{citation |series=Science for Sale |title=Protecting Americans From Danger in the Drinking Water |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/science-jan-june13-taintedwater_03-13/ |work=PBS |date=March 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CWQCB_2015"&gt;{{citation |title=Clean-up and abatement order |work=The California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Lahontan Region (Water Board) |date=2015 |number= R6V-2015-0068 |location=San Bernardino County |url=http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/lahontan/board_decisions/adopted_orders/2015/docs/r6v_2015_0068.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} In early 2016, the ''New York Times'' described Hinkley as having been slowly turned into a [[ghost town]] due to the contamination of the area with owners unable to see their properties.&lt;ref name="NYT_2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lovett|first1=Ian|title=Gas Leak in Los Angeles Has Residents Looking Warily Toward Flint|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/us/gas-leak-in-los-angeles-has-residents-looking-warily-toward-flint.html?_r=0|accessdate=24 January 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection]] and state utility regulators are investigating PG&amp;E to determine if they complied with state laws in the areas burned in the fire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apnews.com/d35f16e96afc4482bf10909d2e52fbfa Utility emailed woman about problems 1 day before fire], by Martha Mendoza and Garance Burke, [[AP News]], November 13, 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/us/utility-contacted-woman-about-power-line-problems-day-before-deadly-wildfire|title=Utility contacted woman about power line problems day before deadly wildfire, report says|last=Chamberlain|first=Samuel|publisher=Fox News|date=November 12, 2018|access-date=November 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Community Pipeline Safety Initiative (CPSI)===
In 2014, PG&amp;E rolled out the "Pipeline Pathways" project which was later rebranded to the "Community Pipeline Safety Initiative". These projects were PG&amp;E's $500 Million four-year effort to clear many of the trees that lie along the almost 7,000 miles of the high pressure gas distribution pipeline in California. PG&amp;E's claims that removing trees were necessary to 1) provide emergency access should an incident occur under a tree and 2) protect pipelines from rupturing due to tree roots. Many communities have protested the removal of private and public trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Gas_and_Electric_Company/ |title=Update: PG&amp;E crews start cutting trees near Oroville Cemetery despite protests |publisher=Chico ER News |date=January 1, 2015}} {{cite web |url=http://www.modbee.com/news/article26829364.html |title=PG&amp;E tree-cutting in gas easements upsets Riverbank residents |publisher=Modesto Bee |date=July 8, 2015}} {{cite web |url=http://abc7news.com/news/walnut-creek-says-no-to-pg-e-tree-removal-program/21545/ |title=Update: Walnut Creek says no to PG&amp;E tree removal program |publisher=ABC 7 News |date=January 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to local opposition groups, PG&amp;E's safety claims for tree removal are incorrect and that tree removal makes aerial monitoring of pipeline faster and cheaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savelafayettetrees.org|title=Save Lafayette Trees|website=Save Lafayette Trees}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, several lawsuits have been filed in Contra Costa County Court by the non-profit organization Save Lafayette Trees stating that PG&amp;E did not conduct the proper CEQA reviews or provide ample public notice before signing agreements for tree removal.

===Metcalf sniper attack===
{{Main|Metcalf sniper attack}}
On the morning of April 16, 2013 a team of gunmen opened fire with rifles on the Metcalf Transmission Substation in San Jose, California, severely damaging 17 transformers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/04/10/pge-offers-250000-reward-in-san-jose-substation-attack/ |title=PG&amp;E Offers $250,000 Reward In San Jose Substation Attack |publisher=CBS San Francisco |date=April 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smart meters===
In the middle of 2010, PG&amp;E rolled out new electronic meters that replaced traditional mechanical electric meters. Customers whose meters were replaced with [[smart meter]]s reported seeing their energy bills increase and accused the company of deliberately inflating their bills and questioned the accuracy of the meters. Subsequently, the [[California Public Utilities Commission]] conducted an investigation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/NR/rdonlyres/2B0BA24E-E601-4739-AC8D-DA9216591913/0/StructureExecutiveSummary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and found that of the 613 Smart Meter field tests, 611 meters were successfully tested and 100% passed Average Registration Accuracy. One meter was found to have serious errors and was malfunctioning on arrival, while another was found to have serious event errors upon installation. These meters were, therefore, excluded from testing.

There were also complaints that the company did not honor customers' request not to have their mechanical meters replaced. Although the contractor that installed the meters would honor these requests, PG&amp;E would eventually replace them anyway.

===Proposition 16===
In 2010, PG&amp;E was accused of attempting to stifle competition with Proposition 16, which mandated approval from two-thirds of voters to start or expand a local utility. Critics argued that this would make it harder for local governments to create their own power utilities, thus effectively giving PG&amp;E a monopoly. The company was also rebuked for supplying $46 million to support the ballot measure when opponents raised $100,000 in the campaign. The proposition was voted down with 52.5% in opposition and 47.5% in favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/10/local/la-me-california-prop16-20100610 | work=Los Angeles Times | first1=Marc | last1=Lifsher | first2=Dianne | last2=Klein | title=PG&amp;E's customers vote down Prop. 16 | date=June 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax dodging and lobbying===
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization [[Public Campaign#Reports|Public Campaign]] criticized PG&amp;E for spending $79 million on [[lobbying]] and [[tax avoidance|not paying any taxes]] during 2008–2010, instead getting $1 billion in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $4.8 billion and increasing executive pay by 94% to $8.5 million in 2010 for its top 5 executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Portero|first=Ashley|title=30 Major U.S. Corporations Paid More to Lobby Congress Than Income Taxes, 2008–2010|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/264481/20111209/30-major-u-s-corporations-paid-lobby.htm|publisher=[[International Business Times]]|accessdate=26 December 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64D9GyQG0|archivedate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restatements===
On February 28, 2002, after the collapse of Enron, which used dubious accounting and partnerships to hide its debt, PG&amp;E announced to restate results dating back to 1999, to show leases related to power plant construction that had been previously kept off its balance sheet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijonline.com/Articles/10020/Preview| title=PG&amp;E to restate results, show off-balance sheet leases}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 2003, PG&amp;E National Energy Group, a unit of PG&amp;E Corporation revised its 2002 Form 10-K/A to reclassify certain offsetting revenues and expenses, which net to zero. PG&amp;E revised its 2002 Form 10-K/A accordingly to reflect the change.

===Rates===
The PG&amp;E and other investor owned utilities that are essentially granted monopoly status in California are guaranteed a negotiated fair rate of return on equity (ROE). PG&amp;E's ROE rate was set at 10.4% and a return on rate base (ROR) was set at 8.06% by the CPUC in December 2012.&lt;ref name="ucdavis_2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eec.ucdavis.edu/files/02-06-2014-The-Future-of-Electricity-Prices-in-California-Final-Draft-1.pdf | title=The Future of Electricity Prices in California Final Draft | work=UC Davis | accessdate=17 April 2016 | author=Jonathan Cook}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.pge.com/nots/rates/tariffs/tm2/pdf/GAS_3362-G.pdf |format=PDF |title=Extended Tax Relief Act |date=December 20, 2012 |work=PG&amp;E}}&lt;/ref&gt; PG&amp;E electricity rates are among the highest in the United States. In his 2013 paper Jonathan Cook of the UC Davis Energy Efficiency Center, described the 'unique factors' that explain why PG&amp;E's rates are higher than other utilities in California.&lt;ref name="ucdavis_2014" /&gt;{{rp|27–8}} According to Cook, PG&amp;E procures 60% of its electricity supply from 3rd party generators and 40% from nuclear, fossil fuel and hydroelectric power plants.&lt;ref name="ucdavis_2014" /&gt;{{rp|27–8}} Many of the dams that produce PG&amp;E's hydroelectric power were built in the early 1900s and require high maintenance. The cost of hydroelectric power maintenance is estimated to rise from $28 million in 2012 to $48 million.&lt;ref name="ucdavis_2014" /&gt;{{rp|28}} PG&amp;E "current and near-term capital expenditures are dominated by Diablo Canyon and its hydroelectric system."&lt;ref name="ucdavis_2014" /&gt;{{rp|28}} Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) expenses are expected to rise especially with new regulations in place after the Fukushima accident.&lt;ref name="ucdavis_2014" /&gt;{{rp|28}} PG&amp;E uses less natural gas than its competitors and is expected "to experience slower price growth rates" particularly if there are high emission allowance prices.&lt;ref name="ucdavis_2014" /&gt;{{rp|29}}

==Future projects==
PG&amp;E are also engaged a Clean Air Transportation Program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pge.com/cleanair|title=Using Clean Vehicles|website=pge.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a A Dialogue on the Next Century of Energy,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.next100.com Next100&lt;/ref&gt; a We Can Do This.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wecandothis.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==South San Joaquin Irrigation District (SSJID)==
In 2009 the [[California Public Utilities Commission]] (CPUC) unanimously approved a resolution that would allow the [[South San Joaquin Irrigation District]] to purchase PG&amp;E’s electric facilities in [[Manteca, California|Manteca]], [[Ripon, California|Ripon]] and [[Escalon, California|Escalon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dennis Wyatt |url=http://www.mantecabulletin.com/archives/72342/ |title=LAFCo treating SSJID differently than Lathrop power provider |publisher=Mantecabulletin.com |date=2013-04-24 |accessdate=2014-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savewithssjid.com |title=Facts not Fear: Save 15 Percent on Your Electric Rates with SSJID |publisher=Savewithssjid.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=SSJID Board Unanimously Approves Filing Application With San Joaquin Local Agency Formation Commission: Board Support is First Step Toward 15% Savings on Retail Electric Rates in SSJID’s Service Territory |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20090903006171/en/SSJID-Board-Unanimously-Approves-Filing-Application-San |date=2009 |work=Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016 a "San Joaquin County Superior Court Judge Carter Holly has rejected PG&amp;E claims that South San Joaquin Irrigation District lacks sufficient revenues to provide electrical retail service to the cities of Manteca, Ripon, and Escalon and surrounding farms."&lt;ref name="SSJID_2016"&gt;{{citation |title=SSJID wins power play |first=Dennis |last=Wyatt |date=March 14, 2016 |accessdate=April 17, 2016 |url=http://www.mantecabulletin.com/m/section/38/article/133121/ |work=Manteca Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Municipal Service Review (MSR) found that SSJID's customer rates would be 15 percent lower than PG&amp;E rates.&lt;ref name="SSJID_2016" /&gt;

'''Paper engineering''' is a branch of engineering that deals with the usage of [[physical science]] (e.g. chemistry and physics) and life sciences (e.g. [[biology]] and [[biochemistry]]) in conjunction with [[mathematics]] as applied to the converting of raw materials into useful [[paper]] products and co-products.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.industrysolutions.siemens.com/paper/en/index.htm |title=Siemens AG. Pulp and Paper Technologies. |date= |work= |publisher=[[Siemens AG]] |accessdate=November 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field applies various principles in [[process engineering]] and [[unit operations]] to the manufacture of [[paper]], [[paper chemicals|chemicals]], [[energy]] and related materials. The following timeline shows some of the key steps in the development of the science of chemical and bioprocess engineering:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pafko.com/history/h_intro.html  History of Chemical Engineering] – at North Carolina State University (and in general).&lt;/ref&gt;

From a heritage perspective, the field encompasses the design and analysis of a wide variety of thermal, chemical and biochemical [[unit operations]] employed in the manufacture of pulp and paper, and addresses the preparation of its raw materials from trees or other natural resources via a [[Wood pulp|pulp]]ing process, chemical and mechanical pretreatment of these recovered [[biopolymer]] (e.g. principally, although not solely, [[cellulose]]-based) fibers in a fluid suspension, the high-speed forming and initial dewatering of a non-woven web, the development of bulk sheet properties via control of energy and mass transfer operations, as well as post-treatment of the sheet with coating, calendering, and other chemical and mechanical processes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Applications==
Today, the field of paper and chemical engineering is applied to the manufacture of a wide variety of products. The (bio)[[chemical industry]] scope manufactures organic and [[agrochemicals]] (fertilizers, insecticides, herbicides), [[oleochemicals]], fragrances and flavors, food, [[Fodder|feed]], [[pharmaceuticals]], [[nutraceuticals]], [[chemicals]], [[polymers]] and power from biological materials.

The resulting products of paper engineering including paper, cardboard, and various paper derivatives are widely used in everyday life. In addition to being a subset of chemical engineering, the field of paper engineering is closely linked to [[forest management]], product [[recycling]], and the mass production of paper – based media.

==Methods==

===Mechanical pulping===
In the process of mechanical pulping, "grinding" and "refining" are the two main methods used to create the pulp. Grinding is the method of pressing logs and chips against a turning stone to produce fibers. Refiner pulping is treating wood chips with chemicals or heat and then crushing the objects between two disks, one or both of which are rotating. There are four main types of refiner pulping, which includes refiner mechanical pulping, thermo-mechanical pulping, chemi-mechanical pulping, and chemithermomechanical pulping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.washington.edu/classes.pse.476/Powerpoint/Powerpoint-Renata/pse%20476-2%20mechanical%20pulping.ppt  |title=Pulping and Bleaching |author= R. Gustafson |date=n.d. |work= |publisher= University of Washington |accessdate=November 23, 2010 | first= | last= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further descriptions of each process are contained in this link:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfr.washington.edu/classes.pse.476/Powerpoint/Powerpoint-Renata/pse%20476-2%20mechanical%20pulping.ppt&lt;/ref&gt;
Mechanical pulping, when compared to chemical pulping, is relatively inexpensive and has a high pulp yield (85–95%). However, the paper created is generally weak since it retains the lignin.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Chemical pulping===
The process of [[chemical pulping]] is used to chemically disband the [[lignin]] found in the cell walls of the material undergoing the process. After the [[cellulose]] fibers are separated from the lignin, a pulp is created which can then be treated to create durable paper, boxes, and corrugated cardboard. Chemical pulping can be characterized by two main methods: sulfate ([[Kraft process]]) pulping and sulfite pulping, and these two methods have different benefits. Sulfate pulping can be performed on a wide range of tree varieties and results in the creation of a strong type of paper. Conversely, sulfite pulping results in a higher volume of pulp which is easier to bleach and process. However, sulfate pulping is more widely used since the product is more durable and the chemicals used in the process can be recovered, thus resulting in minimal environmental pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/air/pdfs/pulpmil3.pdf  |title=Chemical Pulp Mills |author= Washington State Department of Ecology |date=n.d. |work= |publisher= |accessdate=November 23, 2010 | first= | last= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further pulp processing===
{{Main|Paper machine}}

The pulp is then processed through an apparatus which renders the pulp as a mesh of fibers. This fiber network is then pressed to remove all water contents, and the paper is subsequently dried to remove all traces of moisture.

===Finishing===
{{Main|Paper}}

After the above processes have been completed, the resulting paper is coated with a minuscule amount of [[china clay]] or [[calcium carbonate]] to modify the surface, and the paper is then re-sized depending on its intended purpose.

===Product recycling ===
{{Main|Paper recycling}}

Generally, the material to be recycled first undergoes mechanical or chemical pulping to render it in pulp form. The resulting pulp is then processed in the same way normal pulp is processed; however, original fiber is sometimes added to enhance the quality and appearance of the product.

'''Peter Hood Ballantine Frelinghuysen II''' (January 17, 1916&amp;nbsp;– May 23, 2011) was an American politician. He represented [[New Jersey]]'s [[New Jersey's 5th congressional district|fifth congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]] as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from 1953 to 1975.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=F000371 |title=Peter Hood Ballantine Frelinghuysen |accessdate=2011-05-24 |quote= |publisher=[[Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Peter Frelinghuysen came from a long line of New Jersey politicians dating back to the early years of the United States, including four United States senators and two House members.

==Career==
After practicing law in New York City, he served in the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] from September 1942 to December 1945 obtaining the rank of lieutenant. He then studied at [[Columbia University]], 1946&amp;ndash;1947. He served as staff of the Foreign Affairs Task Force of the [[Hoover Commission]] in 1948 before returning to the private sector.

In 1952, he was elected to the House of Representatives from [[New Jersey's 5th congressional district]] and served there until his retirement from politics in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Walter H.

In December 1959, when the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|Port of New York Authority]]'s plans to develop a tract of woodlands and marsh near his estate in Morris County as an international airport serving the New York City region were exposed, Frelinghuysen participated in the opposition by the Jersey Jetport Site Association that was composed of local residents and conservationists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dean|first=Clarence|title=Plan for Airport Argued in New Jersey |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1960/01/14/99471228.pdf |accessdate=June 5, 2013 |newspaper=New York Times|date=January 14, 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Honig|first=Milton|title=Jetport Enemies Say They've Won|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1961/12/17/97630846.pdf|accessdate=June 5, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 17, 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doig|first=Jameson W.|title=Empire on the Hudson: Entrepreneurial Vision and Political Power at the Port of New York Authority|year=2001|publisher=Columbia University Press|pages=385–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ets_wW6cnRYC&amp;pg=PA385&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; which raised funds to purchase almost 3,000 acres of the targeted site and donated it to the federal government, to be preserved forever as park lands. With the defeat of the airport development initiative, that parcel became the initial portion of the [[Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge]], established by federal statute on November 3, 1960, in the middle of the development controversy.&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt;

In the 1960s, extortionists targeted Frelinghuysen for blackmail, arranging for him to have a sexual encounter with an underage male and then, posing as police officers, threatening him with public exposure. Frelinghuysen paid them $50,000. He later cooperated with the FBI's investigation of the [[The Chickens and the Bulls|extortionist ring]], but the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] notified the leadership of the House of Representatives and Frelinghuysen was forced off the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McGowan |first=William |title=The Chickens and the Bulls|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/history/2012/07/the_chickens_and_the_bulls_the_rise_and_incredible_fall_of_a_vicious_extortion_ring_that_preyed_on_prominent_gay_men_in_the_1960s_.html |accessdate=June 4, 2013|newspaper=Slate.com|date=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving Congress, Frelinghuysen served on the boards of several nonprofit institutions, including the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and the [[New York Botanical Garden]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="865">'''Power push-over''' (Buntover) is the action of an aircraft, typically a [[gyroplane]], whose propeller thrust line is above the [[center of gravity]] and lacks an adequate horizontal stabilizer to pitch forward.

Power push-over is caused by the creation of a [[torque]] around the center of mass of the gyroplane by the force of the propeller and unloading of the rotor. Unloading of the rotor and subsequent power push-over can be caused by excessive pilot-induced oscillations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rotorcraft Flying Handbook|date=July 1, 2007|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uoJtGSmQYEC&amp;pg=PT417&amp;dq=Power+Push+over&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rwflVKuNIsL2yQTxu4CwAQ&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Power%20Push%20over&amp;f=false|accessdate=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For several years he owned an [[Adidas]] franchise in [[Damascus]].&lt;ref name="Wright-p.218"&gt;Wright, ''Dreams and Shadows,'' 2008, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
According to Seif, his career in business started with "a workshop for manufacturing shirts in 1963." In 1993, he began "building the New Adidas Company in 1993 ... the first of its kind in Syria", after acquiring a franchise for Syria from the [[Adidas]] Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://syriamonitor.typepad.com/news/2007/04/former_mp_riad_.html Former MP Riad Seif's Experience in Parliament], April 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of Syrian leader [[Hafez al Assad]] in June 2000, Seif assembled "leading [Syrian] intellectuals and independent voices" to discuss "how to open up Syria's ... political system."  The group - which met every Wednesday evening, in Seif's living room and was later dubbed the [[Riad Seif Forum|Forum for National Dialogue]] - "debated human rights, pluralism, press and academic freedoms, and how to build a civil society," and was the first of several forums that "marked the onset" of the [[Damascus Spring]].&lt;ref name="Wright-p.224"&gt;Wright, ''Dreams and Shadows,'' 2008, p.224&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2001, Seif announced his intention to create a new political party to compete with the ruling [[Ba'th Party]]. Around this time he also questioned the monopoly on the new [[cellular telephone]] system granted to the family of [[Hafez al Assad]]'s wife [[Anisa Makhlouf]]. Calling the deal "a big scandal that would cost Syria, an underdeveloped country, millions and millions of dollars", Seif "spoke against it loudly in parliament and forced them to investigate it."&lt;ref name="Wright-p.227"&gt;Wright, ''Dreams and Shadows,'' 2008, p.227&lt;/ref&gt; After a major meeting of the Forum for National Dialogue on 5 September 2001 which several hundred people attended, Seif was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE24/029/2001|title=Syria: Prisoner of conscience, Riad Seif - Amnesty International|publisher=|accessdate=4 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218002718/http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE24/029/2001|archivedate=18 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charged with "defying the state and trying to change the constitution by illegal means," he was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison and released in January 2006.&lt;ref name="Wright-p.228-30"&gt;Wright, ''Dreams and Shadows,'' 2008, p.228-30&lt;/ref&gt; Since then Seif has told journalists that he and his family have been threatened by Syrian ''[[Idarat al-Mukhabarat al-Amma|Mukhabarat]]'' demanding that he not talk to diplomats or any other foreigners, and that his businesses have been forced into bankruptcy; according to Seif, "It started when they cut off supplies for my factories".

[[Amnesty International]] reports that since his release from prison he "has been subjected to various forms of harassment and ill-treatment," including the refusal to allow him to leave the country in late August 2007 for treatment of his [[prostate cancer]], "which has advanced to a stage where it is liable to start spreading to other parts of his body without specialist treatment, which is only available outside Syria."&lt;ref&gt;[http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE240422007?open&amp;of=ENG-360 Urgent action.

He was again arrested in early 2008 and imprisoned for trying to "overthrow the government", in reference to his work as a leader in the [[Damascus Declaration]]. He was then incarcerated in [[Adra Prison]] together with other leaders of the Damascus Declarations.

He was arrested on 6 May 2011 in Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i0yz6uVtpsgQkUvybdelUc2KeR_A?docId=00883bb152884e2894f38892afd7b2d2 Activists: 6 killed in Syria by security forces]&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 November 2012, he was elected co-vice-president of the new [[National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces|opposition government]].

==Early life==
Born in New Zealand, Chandler is the son of [[beekeeper]]s Robert and Marija Chandler, who launched and operated Chandler House, a department store in [[Hamilton, New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="LegatumAbout"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legatum.com/about-us/our-story/ |title=Our story |publisher=Legatum |access-date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career==
Chandler was formerly CEO of the Sovereign group of companies, in partnership with his brother, [[Christopher Chandler (businessman)|Christopher Chandler]]. Between 1986 and 2006, Sovereign invested in companies and governments in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and in industries including telecommunications, electric utilities, steel, oil and gas, banking and oil refining.&lt;ref name="Secrets-of-Sovereign" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes-2009-Billionaires"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/10/billionaires-2009-richest-people_Richard-Chandler_UX5G.html "The World's Billionaires (2009)"], ''[[Forbes]]'', November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The brothers split their assets in 2007 with Richard Chandler creating Orient Global and Christopher Chandler starting [[Legatum|Legatum Capital]].&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10405311"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10405311 |title=Chandler Brothers split up interests |author=McSheehy, Will |date=11 October 2006 |agency=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard's investment style has been described as deep [[value investing]], primarily in global emerging markets and especially in distress situations.&lt;ref name="Secrets-of-Sovereign" /&gt;

Orient Global changed its name to Richard Chandler Corporation in April 2010 before becoming the Chandler Corporation in 2013, and the Clermont Group in 2016. The company "is a long-term value investor that believes well-governed companies play a fundamental role in creating national prosperity," according to its website.&lt;ref name="Chandler-Corporation" /&gt;

Richard Chandler's business ventures have been tinged with themes of contrarian investment, corporate governance and social responsibility, especially by investing in and managing companies with national socio-economic implications.&lt;ref name="Santangels-Review"&gt;[http://www.santangelsreview.com/2011/07/24/richard-chandler-sino-forest-and-how-to-turn-10-million-into-5-billion "Richard Chandler, Sino-Forest, and how $10 million turned into $5 billion"],''[http://www.santangelsreview.com "Santangels Review"]'', July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He once told [[Institutional Investor (magazine)|Institutional Investor]], "We do have altruistic motives that some investors who are looking for a path of least resistance find hard to understand, but we don’t want to be defined by our corporate governance battles. We are value investors with a sense of responsibility, not activists."&lt;ref name="Secrets-of-Sovereign" /&gt;

The Chandler brothers were involved in a highly publicized incident in 2005. Sovereign sold its investment in South Korea's SK Corp., at the time South Korea's third-largest oil conglomerate, after the board refused to oust chairman and CEO Chey Tae Won. Chey had been convicted of accounting fraud for illegally trading stocks. Sovereign had invested in the company just after Chey's arrest, hoping to turn it around. Richard Chandler and his brother tried twice unsuccessfully to remove Chey and ultimately pulled out for ethical reasons. By that point they had improved the company and profited US$728 million.&lt;ref name="Secrets-of-Sovereign" /&gt;

In 2007 Richard Chandler launched a US$100 million education initiative in the developing world with the focus to build low-cost private education opportunities in India.&lt;ref name="Forbes-2009-Billionaires" /&gt; Furthermore, he invested in a global chain of international [[K-12]] schools called [[Nobel Education Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Corporate|url=https://opencorporates.com/companies/gb/04887133|website=opencorporates.com|publisher=Chrinon Ltd|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple media outlets reported in 2012 that Chandler considered investing in the Tasmanian logging company, [[Gunns]], but ultimately decided not to.&lt;ref name="SMH-Gunns-Article"&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/business/gunns-blames-greens-for-billionaire-blow-20120309-1uo9m.html Gunns blames Greens for billionaire blow], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yahoo finance|Yahoo Finance]] reported in June 2013 that Chandler's company acquired an 80% stake in Hoan My Medical Corporation, Vietnam's largest private hospital group. According to the article's author, the transaction "complements the healthcare businesses the Chandler Corporation owns and operates in Indonesia and the Philippines, positioning it to become a leading private healthcare provider in Asia."&lt;ref name="Yahoo-Article"&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chandler-corporation-acquires-80-shareholding-140200879.html Chandler Corporation Acquires an 80% Shareholding in Vietnam's Hoan My Medical Corporation], ''[[Yahoo finance|Yahoo Finance]]'', June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other core partners include [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Bill and Melinda Gates]], [[Jeffrey Skoll|Jeff Skol]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l, [[Romesh Wadhwani|Romesh]] and Kathy Wadhwani, and [[Rockefeller Foundation|The Rockefeller Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.co-impact.io/2017/11/15/leading-philanthropists-announce-co-impact-global-collaborative-systems-change-500-million-planned-initial-funding/|title=Leading Philanthropists Announce Co-Impact, A Global Collaborative for Systems Change, with US $500 Million in Planned Initial Funding - Co-Impact|date=2017-11-15|work=Co-Impact|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard John Pelwana Maponya''', [[Order of the Baobab|GCOB]],&lt;ref name="gcob"&gt;[http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/orders_list.asp?show=343 The Presidency - Republic of South Africa - Grand Counsellor of The Order of the Baobab in Gold]&lt;/ref&gt; (born in [[Tzaneen]],[[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] on 24 December 1926&lt;ref name="gcob" /&gt;) is a [[South Africa]]n entrepreneur and [[property developer]] best known for building a business empire despite the restrictions of [[apartheid]] and his determination to see the [[Soweto]] township develop [[economics|economically]].

==Early career==
Born  in Thlabine, near Lenyenye- about 20km west of Tzaneen, Maponya, at the age of 24,&lt;ref name="age"&gt;zwtetete [https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081004/ap_on_re_af/af_south_africa_soweto_entrepreneur Up from apartheid, Soweto millionaire a role model - AP]&lt;/ref&gt;  then a teacher, took a job as a stock taker at a clothing maker and subsequently won a promotion for both himself and his white manager. In gratitude, the manager sold Maponya soiled clothing and offcuts, which he resold in Soweto. With the capital acquired he attempted to open a clothing retailer in Soweto, but was blocked by the government's refusal to grant him a licence – despite the intervention by the law firm created by [[Oliver Tambo]] and [[Nelson Mandela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1657164,00.html|title=Retail Renegade: Richard Maponya|publisher=Time magazine|accessdate=7 July 2008 | date=29 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, in the early 1950s, Maponya and his wife Marina (a cousin of Nelson Mandela) established the [[Dube Hygienic Dairy]], which employed a fleet of boys on bicycles to deliver milk to customers in Soweto who had no access to electricity or refrigeration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Soweto Rising, [[Maverick (magazine)|Maverick magazine]], volume 2, issue 2&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s the retail empire had grown to include several general stores, car dealerships and filling stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1657164-2,00.html|title=Retail Renegade: Richard Maponya|publisher=Time magazine|accessdate=7 July 2008 | date=29 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activity==
During the 1960s and 1970s Maponya was a member of the [[South Africa under apartheid|Urban Bantu Council]]. He resigned in 1977, shortly after youth affiliated with the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) requested that he do so, and shortly before the council offices were burnt to the ground.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In the 1960s he was a founding member and the first president of the [[National African Federated Chamber of Commerce]] (Nafcoc) and likewise the founder and chairman of the [[African Chamber of Commerce]].

But some consider his boldest political move to have been his choice of horse-racing colors. As the first black person to be granted such colors in South Africa, Maponya chose green, gold and black, the colors of the ANC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2005-08-17-i-will-die-with-my-boots-on|title='I will die with my boots on'|publisher=Mail &amp; Guardian|accessdate=7 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maponya Mall==
On 27 September 2007 Richard Maponya opened the [[Maponya Mall]] in Soweto. it holds more than 200 stores and a cinema complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabcnews.com/south_africa/general/0,2172,156535,00.html|title=Mandela officially opens new Soweto mall|publisher=SABC|accessdate=7 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maponya acquired the land where the mall is situated in 1979, at first as a 100-year lease. In 1994, after several attempts, he acquired it outright. Various attempts to finance construction failed until Maponya's holding company entered into a joint venture with [[Zenprop Property Holdings]].

==Awards==

'''Scott Gilmore''' is a Canadian [[social entrepreneur]], former diplomat, and writer who is known for founding the charity [[Peace Dividend Trust|Building Markets]] and as an advocate for reform in the international development and charity sectors.&lt;ref name="Transformational Cdn" /&gt;

==Early life and education==
Gilmore was born in northern [[Manitoba]], the son of hockey player [[Tom Gilmore (ice hockey)|Tom Gilmore]] and Collette Gilmore. He is the brother of actor [[Patrick Gilmore (actor)|Patrick Gilmore]]. Gilmore grew up in [[Edmonton, Alberta]] where he obtained a Bachelor of Commerce degree at the [[University of Alberta]].&lt;ref name=Pilger&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pilger|first1=Rick|title=Putting Money Where It Matters Most|url=http://newtrail.ualberta.ca/featurestories/scottgilmore|website=http://ualberta.ca|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later graduated with a master's degree from the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref name="Transformational Cdn" /&gt;

==Career==

Gilmore was a Canadian diplomat who began his career in Jakarta. From that post he covered the East Timor conflict and later joined the [[United Nations]] peacekeeping mission [[UNTAET]] under [[Sergio de Mello]]. In that role he became disillusioned with ineffective donor efforts to fight poverty. Based on this experience he quit his job as a diplomat in 2004 to launch the charity [[Peace Dividend Trust|Building Markets]].&lt;ref name="This Mag"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Graham F.|title=Interview with Peace Dividend Trust's Scott Gilmore|url=http://this.org/blog/2010/01/19/interview-scott-gilmore/|accessdate=26 October 2014|agency=This Magazine|date=January 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focus on entrepreneurship instead of aid as a sustainable poverty solution.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carlyle|first1=Erin|title=Building Markets: Meet The Start-Up Bringing Investors To The Fastest-Growing Economies in the World|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erincarlyle/2013/11/17/building-markets-meet-the-start-up-bringing-investors-to-the-fastest-growing-economies-in-the-world/|accessdate=26 October 2014|publisher=Forbes Magazine|date=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Gilmore led a [[World Bank]] study to trace spending in peacekeeping missions that revealed only 5% of donor money entered the local economies. Based on those findings Gilmore launched a project in Afghanistan to channel international spending through local small businesses. This approach was successful and expanded to other countries.&lt;ref name="Transformational Cdn" /&gt; Building Market's "buy local" policy was officially adopted by [[NATO]], the United States government, and the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name=Pilger /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NATO Afghan First Policy|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_62851.htm|website=NATO|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Gilmore was appointed to by the External Advisory Group overseeing the merger of the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (Canada)|Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade]] with the [[Canadian International Development Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blanchfield|first1=Mike|title=Paradis defends mining exec on advisory panel on international aid|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/935875/paradis-defends-mining-exec-on-advisory-panel-on-international-aid/|accessdate=27 October 2014|publisher=Global News|date=October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously been supportive of the merger.&lt;ref name="CIDA Merger"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berthiaume|first1=Lee|title=CIDA merger meets with controversy|url=http://www2.canada.com/vancouversun/news/archives/story.html?id=debacf11-51f7-45c8-be14-44eddda98579|accessdate=27 October 2014|publisher=Vancouver Sun|date=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bündner Schwabenkinder 1907.JPG|thumb|Swabian children from Graubünden at Arnach (1907)]]

The '''[[Swabia]]n children''' (German: ''Schwabenkinder'') were peasant children from poor families in the [[Alps]] of Austria and Switzerland who went to find work on farms in [[Upper Swabia]] and the [[Swabian Jura]]. Usually they were sent by their parents to become seasonal workers. They were taken in spring and brought to the child markets in Germany, mainly in [[Upper Swabia]], where they would be purchased or "rented" by farmers for the season. This use of children as workers was most widespread in the 19th century.

The march [[Principal passes of the Alps|over the Alps]] to Germany proved often difficult and exhausting. Usually their guide was a priest, who was also responsible for ensuring the children had a warm stable to sleep in.

The marches were large, organised groups of several thousand children, taken over the snow-covered mountains often still dressed in rags. It was not uncommon for five and six-year-old children to be taken.

The American press began a campaign in 1908 exposing the Swabian children, describing the child market in [[Friedrichshafen]] as a "barely concealed slave market".

The child markets were abolished in 1915, yet the trade of children did not end completely until compulsory schooling for foreign children was introduced in [[Württemberg]] in 1921.

Many immigration certificates from Swabia show surnames typical of [[county of Tyrol|Tyrol]] and other regions the children were taken from (e.g. ''Braxmeier'' from ''Braxmarer'').

==Film==

* ''Schwabenkinder'', TV film (first aired 2003), director: [[Jo Baier]], actors: [[Tobias Moretti]], [[Vadim Glowna]]

The movie is based on the novel "Die Schwabenkinder - Die Geschichte des Kaspanaze" (''"The Swabian Children - The Story of Kaspanaze"'') by [[Elmar Bereuter]] ({{ISBN|3-7766-2304-7}}).

'''Film synopsis:''' After his mother is killed in an avalanche, the farmer boy Kaspar is sent by his struggling father to work in Swabia. Together with other children from the village, their guide ([[Tobias Moretti]]) brings the group to the child market at [[Ravensburg]]. There the miraculous story begins: The brutal treatment of the boy by the farmer, his escape, emigration to the United States, and final home coming to his village many years later to visit his dying father.

'''''The Hard Copy Observer''''' is a regular publication of [[Lyra Research]] based in [[Newtonville, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of Lyra Research, Inc.|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=22563242|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a business (as opposed to consumer) publication targeted at the [[Printing]] and [[Document imaging|Imaging]] business, and is widely considered the premier authoritative factual source for that industry. [[Tekrati]], a firm in the [[Analyst relations|Analyst Relations]] business, summarizes The Hard Copy Observer as "a leading publication serving the industry and, in fact, the printer industry bible."&lt;ref&gt;[http://analystfirms.tekrati.com/detail.asp?id=88 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061124134328/http://analystfirms.tekrati.com/detail.asp?id=88 |date=November 24, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
Volume 1, Number 1 of "the Observer" was published in October 1991. Its founder as well as original editor and publisher is Charles LeCompte, who remains as publisher (2010). The success of the publication spawned what grew to be a much larger marketing research organization, Lyra Research, headquartered in [[Newton, Massachusetts]]. A companion monthly newsletter, ''The Hard Copy Supplies Journal'', was also developed to focus on the consumables portion of the business.

The first edition was 28 pages in length, and featured front-page stories about [[Xerox]], [[Apple Computer]], and [[Dataproducts]]. Its "look" was the no-nonsense black-and-white format that for the most part has remained unchanged. Today's subscription rate is $650 a year, compared to 1991's $495 a year, though the average edition's length, in its print form, grew to over 50 pages. Then as now, the publication is subscriber-supported with virtually no advertising.

The print version of the publication ended with the August 2009 issue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hard Copy Observer -- now online!|url=http://jimlyonsobservations.blogspot.com.tr/2009/09/hard-copy-observer-now-online.html|publisher=Jim Lyons Observations|accessdate=1 January 2016|date=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and beginning in September 2009, the newsletter content was continuously updated and available via web access.

In April 2012, the Photizo Group acquired Lyra Research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Photizo Group Acquires Lyra Research|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/photizo-group-acquires-lyra-research/|accessdate=1 January 2016|work=ZDNet|date=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the online ''Observer'' was phased out as it was merged with Photizo's industry news resources.

'''Tiger Conference''' is an annual [[conference]], founded in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://labs.kyivpost.com/tiger2017/6th_TIGER_Conference.pdf|title=Tiger Conference Chronology|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Kyiv Post]]. The conference brings together more than 400 [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] and world leaders, top managers, top executives of leading companies, media, parliamentarians, diplomats and opinion leaders to exchange ideas about the future of [[Ukraine]] in a changing world.

Since 2016, Kyiv Post has launched a "Top 30 Under 30" [[List of awards|award ceremony]], selected by jury on the basis of nominations from readers and business community. This ceremony completes the conference.

As of 2018, the Tiger Conference has become an independent discussion platform for discussing the strongest challenges of Ukraine.

== Format ==
The event holds 4 panel discussions, speeches delivered by key speakers, 2 sectional meetings and the award ceremony of the 30 most successful young Ukrainians "TOP30UNDER30".

== Top 30 Under 30 ==
[[File:Logo 30UNDER30 Ukraine.png|thumb|Official logo of the nomination]]
The Top 30 Under 30 [[nomination]] is a popular practice among international editions, research organizations such as [[Forbes]]. In Ukraine, the award was launched in 2016 by [[Kyiv Post|KyivPost]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tiger.kyivpost.com/page1414128.html|title=6th Tiger Conference|website=tiger.kyivpost.com|accessdate=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in partnership with the [[Victor Pinchuk Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pinchukfund.org/ua/news/17090/|title=Фонд Віктора Пінчука - Новини|website=pinchukfund.org|accessdate=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year  special jury creates a list of the top 30 most successful young Ukrainians, who inspires and proves that Ukraine has a bright future.

The winners of the nomination must be a [[Citizenship|citizen]] of Ukraine who has not yet reached the age of 30 years and have outstanding achievements in the fields of [[education]], [[health care]], [[business]], [[science]], [[medicine]], social activities, [[art]] and other fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prostir.ua/?grants=nominatsiya-top-30-under-30-vid-kyiv-post-tryvaje-pryjom-zayavok|title=Номінація TOP 30 UNDER 30 від Kyiv Post – триває прийом заявок {{!}} Громадський простір|website=www.prostir.ua|language=uk|accessdate=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award is realized in a crystal engraving [[Figurine|statuette]].

The following is a partial '''timeline of [[Crayola]]'s history'''.  It covers the Crayola brand of marking utensils, as well as the history of [[Binney &amp; Smith]], the company that created the brand and is currently a subsidiary of [[Hallmark Cards]] known as [[Crayola LLC]].

{{TOC right}}

==List of Events==

===1864–1900===
*'''1864:''' Joseph Binney founds Peekskill Chemical Works in [[Upstate New York]] for producing [[carbon black]].
*'''1880:''' Joseph Binney sets up headquarters in [[New York City]], joined by son [[Edwin Binney]] and nephew [[C. Harold Smith]].
*'''1885:''' Joseph Binney retires; Edwin and C. Harold Smith, form a partnership and call their company [[Binney &amp; Smith]]. Early products include red [[oxide]] [[pigment]] used in [[barn (building)|barn]] paint and carbon black used for [[automobile|car]] [[tire]]s. During this time, Binney &amp; Smith took an active role in the development and production of carbon black from [[natural gas]], after natural gas deposits were found throughout [[Pennsylvania]].
*'''1889:''' [[Binney &amp; Smith]] made yellow [[oxide]] [[pigment]]. Now there are three colors: [[Carbon black]], yellow, and red.

===1900–1950===
*'''1900:''' The company begins producing [[slate (writing)|slate]] [[school]] [[pencil]]s in its newly opened [[Easton, Pennsylvania]] [[mill (factory)|mill]]. Their carbon black wins the Gold Medal at the Paris Exposition.
*'''1902:''' "Binney &amp; Smith Company" is formed September 30, in Easton, Pennsylvania, and serves as general distributor for several carbon black producers, introducing Carbon black to other countries.  This also marks their first crayon product, the industry crayon "Staonal" in black. This crayon precedes the Crayola brand by a full year and still exists to this year.

*'''1904:''' Binney &amp; Smith wins the Gold Medal during the April 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. Their entry was actually for their An-Du-Septic dustless chalk, but it was the foundation of their "Gold Medal" packaging in which they featured the gold medal on the front of their crayon boxes for the next 50 or so years. Given that this award wasn't given out until April 1904 and Crayola had been selling since August 1903, it is a misconception that the famous box shown on the postage stamp and in numerous other historical articles and web pages is "the" actual first design of their Crayola boxes because the box shown in all of those pictures has that Gold Medal on the front.
*'''1905:''' Binney redesigns their 8-color assortment to use the famous "Gold Medal" label and design.

This first and only Gold Medal box used the Eagle side of the Gold Medal and was the only assortment size to use this side of the medal as it was changed to the other side before they expanded the line to other assortment sizes in 1910.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1042">'''Tools of trade''' is a term generally used in [[bankruptcy law]] to determine what property a person would commonly use for the purpose of making a living, as items that are tools of trade are separately exempt from attachment with an additional amount above that normally given for a person's property.

Under bankruptcy law, the applicable exemption for tools of the trade is determined by state law and by the amount of time a person spent living in a particular state prior to filing.  An attorney can help determine which assets are exempt and which exemptions are applicable.

For example, a person might be allowed an exemption for household goods, and could use an additional exemption for tools of trade. Anything the person can show is used by them for earning a living is carried under this separate exemption.  Thus, a candlemaker would have to list a personal computer under household goods, but a computer programmer could be able to claim a computer as part of the tools of trade.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6029">'''Trinity Court Building''' refers to a succession of structures located at 70, 74, and 76 [[Church Street (Manhattan)|Trinity Place]] in [[Lower Manhattan]], [[New York City]], between Rector and Albany Streets.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nyc-architecture.com/GON/GON095.htm|title=New York Architecture Images- Trinity Court Building (formerly known as American Bank Note Building)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nyc-architecture.com|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Original building ==
The earliest building to carry the name was built in 1879 for the [[Western Union|Western Union Telegraph Company]]. It had six stories, 5,000 square feet of space, stores on the ground floor, and commercial lofts in the rest. The structure was not squared, having elevation widths of 104.4 (frontage), 42.4, 108.9, and 52 feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18302617/alliance_realty_company_buys_trinity/|title=Alliance Realty Company Buys Trinity Court Building - Newspapers.com|last=|first=|date=1914-12-21|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en|via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{OpenAccess}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western Union sold it in 1888. The building was the focus of a complex tort in the 1890s over property value loss due to the operation of the Manhattan Elevated Railroad in front of it. The builder (Western Union) and the defendant (railway) were both controlled by the same group of investors, who were asserted to be in collusion against buyer Augustus D. Shepard to nullify any damages collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18302343/news_summary/|title=News summary|last=|first=|date=1899-05-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en|via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{OpenAccess}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18302202/manhattan_loses_old_suit/|title=Manhattan Loses Old Suit|last=|first=|date=1899-05-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en|quote=Judgement in Favor of A.

== Second building ==
The old building was torn down in 1926 to make way for a 24 story skyscraper of 125,000 square feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18304205/trinity_court_new_skyscraper_in_wall/|title=Trinity Court, New Skyscraper in Wall Street Area|last=|first=|date=1926-03-07|work=The Brooklyn Daily Eagle|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en|via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{OpenAccess}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was completed in 1927.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One of the earliest tenants of the new building was a company managing [[miniature golf]] courses and a golf school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18302406/lease_to_golf_school/|title=Lease to Golf School|last=|first=|date=1927-09-11|work=The Brooklyn Daily Eagle|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long after its completion, the [[Irving Trust|Irving Trust Company]] began started construction on a new [[Irving Trust Company Building|building]] at the corner of Wall Street and Broadway, visible from the Trinity Court Building. The builder commissioned a time study of the construction process. Eight images from that study have been preserved at the [[Canadian Centre for Architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cca.qc.ca/en/collection/525-irving-trust-building-new-york|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914231838/http://www.cca.qc.ca/en/collection/525-irving-trust-building-new-york|title=Irving Trust Building, New York {{!}} Canadian Centre for Architecture (CCA)|archive-date=2010-09-14|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was demolished in 2015.

== Building under construction ==
[[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]] owns the site, and had its offices and pre-school in the 1927 building. In 2015, the church faced of choice of a $33 million renovation to bring it up to code, or to replace it with a new building at a cost of about $35 million. The vestry decided on the latter course, and tore it down. A new building will have an address of 68-74 Trinity Place. Originally, 310,000 square feet of primarily luxury condominiums with a modern glass facade was planned. Due to community opposition the plans were changed, with a smaller commercial building incorporating community-friendly uses. The new design also uses bronzed aluminum to better fit in with the church and the preserved footbridge form the previous building, and incorporates stained glass and terra cotta embellishments salvaged form the 1927 edifice. Completion is estimated in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newyorkyimby.com/2016/10/new-mixed-use-tower-revealed-at-74-trinity-place-financial-district.html|title=New Mixed-Use Tower Revealed at 74 Trinity Place, Financial District - New York YIMBY|date=2016-10-24|work=New York YIMBY|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.6sqft.com/construction-kicks-off-on-trinity-churchs-pelli-clarke-pelli-designed-community-center-and-office-tower/|title=Construction kicks off on Trinity Church's Pelli Clarke Pelli-designed community center and office tower {{!}} 6sqft|website=6sqft|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Unpaid labor''' is defined as labor that does not receive any direct remuneration. This is a form of 'non-market work' which can fall into one of two categories: (1) '''unpaid work''' that is placed within the production boundary of the [[System of National Accounts]] (SNA), such as [[gross domestic product]] (GDP),  and (2) unpaid work that falls outside of the production boundary (non-SNA work), such as domestic labor that occurs inside households for their consumption.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hirway|first=Indira|date=March 2015|title=Unpaid Work and the Economy: Linkages and Their Implications|url=|journal=Indian Journal of Labour Economics|volume=58|issue=1|page=|pages=1–21|doi=10.1007/s41027-015-0010-3|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unpaid labor is visible in many forms and isn't limited to activities within a household. Other types of unpaid labor activities include volunteering as a form of charity work and interning as a form of unpaid employment.

According to time-use surveys collected by the [[United Nations Statistics Division]] (UNSD), women are the main undertakers of unpaid labor globally. This uneven division of unpaid labor within households has implications for women's involvement in both public and private spheres. One common form of unpaid work is unpaid domestic work. The burden of this type of unpaid work generally falls on the women in a household. Contributing so much time to unpaid domestic work has major effects on women and their participation in the labor market, which consequently affects children, society, and the state.

==Unpaid domestic labor==

===Types===

==== Unpaid care work ====
"Unpaid care work" typically specifically contains everyday activities, such as cooking, washing, cleaning, shopping for own household, as well as care of children, the elderly, the sick, and the disabled. The term "unpaid care work" is primarily defined as care work for family members, but it is important to note that other types of unpaid SNA work exist that address 'productive activities', which include types of labor such as "growing food for own consumption, and collecting water and fuel".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Folbre|first=Nancy|date=July 2006|title=Measuring Care: Gender, Empowerment, and the Care Economy|url=|journal=Journal of Human Development|volume=7|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reproductive labor ====
While unpaid care work is not completely biological, reproductive labor (partially) is. Debra Satz believes that reproductive labor is "a special kind of labor that should not be treated according to market norms"; it includes childbearing and raising/taking care of children and other family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Satz|first=Debra|year=1992|title=Markets in Women's Reproductive Labor|url=|journal=Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs|volume=21|pages=107–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Childbearing is an act that only those who possess female reproductive organs can perform, making it irreversibly a biological-female's job. Married women, single mothers, or other female family members (such as elder siblings, aunts, etc.) are expected to be the primary actors of this unpaid reproductive labor in their personal lives, on top of the economic necessity of entering the productive, paid labor force.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Olmsted, Jennifer C. "Development and Reproductive Rights: Placing Social Sustainability at the Center of the Agenda." 2016, pp. 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Child-rearing falls under both reproductive and care labor, so, after breastfeeding, any member of the household can take on the job.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heilman|first=Madeline E.|last2=Chen|first2=Julie J.|year=2005|title=Same Behavior, Different Consequences: Reactions to Men's and Women's Altruistic Citizenship Behavior|url=|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=90|issue=3|pages=431–441|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.90.3.431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
The role of women and men within their households is deeply rooted in [[gender norm]]s and cultural values that have been reinforced over time by [[colonization]] and [[imperialism]]. For example, as seen in Patricia Grimshaw's research in Hawaii: New England missionaries assumed the roles of imperialists and colonialists by preaching their Christian values to the native Hawaiian population, who, before the missionary women arrived, practiced polygamy (high class-status allowing) and did not trouble themselves with domestic tasks like ironing. The Christian women, in particular, saw it as their responsibility to teach the native women notions of femininity that consisted of remaining inside the home to care for the family and to remain submissive to their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New England missionary wives, Hawaiian women, and "The Cult of True Womanhood"|last=Grimshaw|first=Patricia|work=Family and gender in the Pacific: domestic contradictions and the colonial impact|publisher=|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=19–44|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, a woman's position in the home was seen as a  prerequisite to being a "good" wife and mother.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sayer|first=Liana C.|year=2005|title=Gender, time and inequality: Trends in women's and men's paid work, unpaid work and free time|url=|journal=Social Forces|volume=84|issue=1|pages=285–303|via=|doi=10.1353/sof.2005.0126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s, however, the spread of globalization has given rise to new opportunities for women to participate in market work that has challenged the assumption their primary adult role as that of caretaker for the family and home.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The spread of globalization has created more opportunities for women to enter paid employment, but has not relieved them of their time spent on unpaid labor.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pearson|first=Ruth|year=2000|title=All change? Men, women and reproductive work in the global economy|url=|journal=The European Journal of Development Research|volume=12|issue=2|pages=219–237|via=|doi=10.1080/09578810008426773}}&lt;/ref&gt; While participating in the labor market, women who secure paid employment undertake what is known as the "double burden" of labor. Finding the optimal balance of balance of paid and unpaid labor, or [[work life balance]], is a constant struggle for women trying to create careers for themselves while raising children or caring for elderly family members. Women have to constantly decide where to allocate time and financial resources, which impacts their ability to develop their own capabilities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In turn, this decision impacts their family's relative standard of living as measured by [[national income accounting]] statistics.

Because of [[social norm]]s and expectations, the burden of unpaid work primarily falls on the female member(s) of the household. Even if the male member(s) of the household are available to perform the care labor after they return home from their paid job, it is more often seen that the women are taking on the bulk of the care labor after they return home.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The traditional view of a family involves a woman in unpaid domestic labor supporting the household; however, under trends of dual earner couples and a gradually aging population, the commercialization of housework and domestic care has become inevitable. Arguments have been made that the value of unpaid domestic labor must always be considered to prevent the exploitation of unpaid workers, and thus should be seen as legitimate employment. There are also arguments that a "[[caregiver]] allowance" should be provided to unpaid domestic workers to protect the labor value of their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=UNIFEM: Progress for the World's Women 2005|url=http://www.un-ngls.org/orf/women-2005.pdf|year=2005|pages=58–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the methodology used, a variety of studies have shown that the division of household labor results in a disproportionate burden falling on the wives in married couples' households. While this is the case, it has also been shown that the disparity between men and women in married households has been shrinking to some degree.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/135457000337679|title=Working Time as Gendered Time|last2=Negrey|first2=Cynthia|website=Feminist Economics|pages=59–76|doi=10.1080/135457000337679|last1=Sirianni|first1=Carmen|volume=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, during the Great Recession of the 2000s, low income men increased their contributions to their households by completing more hours of unpaid domestic work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khitarishvili|first=Tamar|last2=Kim|first2=Kijong|date=2015|title=The Great Recession and Unpaid Work Time in the United States - Does Poverty Matter?|url=|journal=International Journal of Time Use Research|volume=12|issue=1|pages=19–48|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "feminine quality" of unpaid care work ===

Globally, the expectation of women being the main providers of 'unpaid care' labor has been socially constructed and enforced by gender norms. Even when women are employed full-time outside the house, they may perform a greater share of household chores and childcare activities.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; As a result of globalization, women have increasingly been expected to take on jobs in both the paid and unpaid sectors, contributing to family income while still being the main providers of unpaid labor.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1995 | title = WHO special programme for research, development and research training in human reproduction, World Bank: IUD Research Group. The TCu380A IUD and the frameless "FlexiGard", interim three-year data from an international multicenter trial | url = | journal = Contraception | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 77–83 | doi=10.1016/s0010-7824(95)00140-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This inequality emphasizes the gender division of labor and how it has changed with globalization's shifts in employment patterns. Furthermore, it illuminates how socially constructed gender norms have created a system that encourages women to continue to carry the '[[double burden]]' of care services. The 'double burden' structure has contributed tremendously to the economic vulnerability of women, as women in financial crises are more likely to be poor, unemployed, ill in health, and uneducated. Women often suffer more during financial crises because they tend to be more generally disadvantaged than men.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aslanbeigui|first=Nahid|last2=Summerfield|first2=Gale|year=2001|title=Risk, gender, and development in the 21st century|url=|journal=International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society|volume=15|issue=1|pages=7–26|via=|doi=10.1023/a:1011184220863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Double burden ===

==== Definition ====
A [[double burden]], otherwise known as a double day, is the phenomenon that a woman holds a paying job in the labor market and then must come home and work a full day's worth of unpaid domestic work within the home.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacDonald|first=Martha|last2=Phipps|first2=Shelley|last3=Lethbridge|first3=Lynn|date=March 2005|title=Takings Its Toll: The Influence of Paid and Unpaid Work on Women's Well-Being|url=|journal=Feminist Economics|volume=11|issue=1|pages=63–94|doi=10.1080/1354570042000332597|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to societal norms and expectations, the burden of unpaid work primarily falls on the female in the household even if she and her husband work the same hours in the labor market.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Effect on women ====
Balancing paid and unpaid work obligations is taxing on women. Reports of increased stress levels are not uncommon.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In fact, women report higher levels of symptoms related to depression and anxiety, including low [[life satisfaction]] and subjective well-being.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; As women increase their paid work time, they do not achieve a corresponding reduction in their unpaid work hours. Nor have men increased their share of unpaid work at the same rate that women have increased their share of paid work.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The Human Development Report of 2015 reports that, in 63 countries, 31 percent of women's time is spent doing unpaid work, as compared to men who dedicate only 10 percent of their time to unpaid work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/2015_human_development_report.pdf|title=Human Development Report 2015|last=|first=|date=2015|website=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The double-burden is intensified when women are subjected to poverty and live in communities that lack basic infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In areas that lack easy access to food and water, household duties are even more time consuming.

=== Data ===
The most commonly used method for measuring unpaid domestic labor is through the collection of [[time-use survey]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These surveys attempt to evaluate how much time is spent providing different services, such as time spent in the workforce versus time spent on unpaid domestic work, such as cooking.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sarah Gammage conducted time use surveys in Guatemala to measure time spent doing unpaid domestic work within households and between family members.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gammage|first=Sarah|date=September 9, 2010|title=Time Pressed and Time Poor: Unpaid Household Work in Guatemala|url=|journal=Feminist Economics|volume=16|issue=3|doi=10.1080/13545701.2010.498571|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, Gammage found women completed approximately 70% of all unpaid domestic work within a household.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Similarly, Debbie Budlenger conducted time use surveys across six different countries and found women in each country conducted the majority of the unpaid domestic work each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Budlender|first=Debbie|date=December 2008|title=The Statistical Evidence on Care and Non-Care Work across Six Countries|url=http://www.unrisd.org/80256B3C005BCCF9/(httpAuxPages)/F9FEC4EA774573E7C1257560003A96B2/$file/BudlenderREV.pdf|journal=United Nations Research Institute for Social Development|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of her findings are summarized in the chart below:

In a different time use survey, Liangshu Qi and Xiao-yuan Dong found that, in China men complete an average of 58 minutes of unpaid work a day compared to the 139 minutes of unpaid work a day that women complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liangshu|first=Qi|last2=Dong|first2=Xiao-yuan|date=May 8, 2015|title=Unpaid Care Work's Interference with Paid Work and the Gender Earnings Gap in China|url=|journal=Feminist Economics|volume=22|issue=2|doi=10.1080/13545701.2015.1025803|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Time-series data collected by the United Nations Statistics Division from 2000 to 2015 directly support the claim that women undertake more than half of household domestic labor all over the world. The largest discrepancy between female and male time-use is in developing countries. The data was collected through a 24-hour diary and then averaged over seven days across 80 countries. In the top ten are three Scandinavian countries (in order from lowest discrepancy in time-use to highest): Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Netherlands and Finland. Out of all the countries included in the data set, Sweden had the smallest discrepancy between female and male time use with a difference of 3.33 hours out of a full day.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Statistics, Commodity Trade, and Statistics Branch. "United Nations Statistics Division." ''New York'' (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, Algeria, Tunisia, Mexico, Iraq and Guatemala each had female-to-male time-use discrepancies that exceeded 18+ hours of work per day. For both Mexico and Guatemala, the proportion of domestic work that women do exceeded the number of hours in a day by about three hours. Women possibly had some days when they performed more housework than usual, which may have skewed the average. Mathematically, the average of spending four hours per day seven days a week on domestic household labor equates to 672 hours per week or 28 hours per day as an approximation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Examining only male participation in domestic household labor, the latest data available for Malawi shows that the amount of housework that men do per day is approximately 1.25 hours, and that is the same length of time that Cambodian men spent on household labor in 2004. Other nations with poor male participation in the division of household labor include Pakistan (males:1.81; 18.06 hours discrepancy), Mali (males: 2.50; 17.92 hours discrepancy), Japan (males: 2.92; 12.01 discrepancy) and Palestine (males: 3.06; 16.11 hours discrepancy).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

On the other hand, the minimum number of hours that women spend on average occupied by domestic tasks 8.68 hours per week in Malawi. In the United States, the latest available data from 2014 shows that women undertake 14.58 hours per week on household labor. The trend in the division of household domestic labor in countries that have more than one year's worth of data show that, for 14 out of the 35 countries and between a range of 0.99 to 12.99 hours, women's proportion of unpaid labor on average diminished.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Gender and unpaid work: the gender division ===
Socially constructed gender roles are prescribed as ideal or proper behaviors for specific categories of male and female. Societies have socially constructed women's roles because women are primarily financially dependent on men as is defined through a 'sexual contract', thus deeming them a "private responsibility of individual men".&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olmsted|first=Jennifer C.|year=2005|title=Is paid work the (only) answer? Neoliberalism, Arab women's well-being, and the social contract|url=|journal=Journal of Middle East Women's Studies|volume=1|issue=2|pages=112–139|via=|doi=10.1215/15525864-2005-2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This construction has resulted in women being domesticated because their primary access to economic support was through marriage to a man. This gender division has made women's needs and rights invisible, which allows men to "continue to dominate women and define them as dependent" and conceals the needed dependency between men and women.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This ignored 'dual dependency' highlights the fact that men are dependent on women's "domestic and reproductive labor" just as women are dependent on the income of men.

In many societies the socially constructed role of women includes "giving birth, caring for children, the elderly, and disabled, preparing food and clothing and collecting water, and firework, among others".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Furthermore, women's gender roles are socially constructed within the economy as well, because their economic contributions can be easily replaced for men through remarriage or by paying for care services; care work can be bought and sold, but the vast majority of care work is unpaid and is not formally accounted for. The socially constructed gender roles of men being the breadwinners who women depend on and women as members of the domestic sphere have thus been reinforced through economic motives that pose gender relations between men and women as an exchange of support for service. This configuration is based on 'patriarchal control', which is proclaimed to be linked to the "socialization processes where women are raised to be relational" care takers and family structure supports, while men are more 'individualistic' since their role is only tied to providing money.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In other words, men provide the money and women are to provide 'unpaid labor'. Consequently, in the field of "unpaid care work" men typically take on far less responsibility than women due to the socially constructed 'gender division of labor' which assigns the obligation of 'caring labor' to women.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

===Effects===

The disproportionate division of household unpaid labor that falls on women negatively impacts their ability to navigate life outside their homes. Their undertaking of unpaid labor is a barrier to entry into the paid employment sector or in the case of those women who enter paid labor they still are left with a "double-burden" of labor.&lt;ref&gt;"Human development report 1999". New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. Online. Internet. 13 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNDP Women and Development Report of 1995 conducted a time-use study that analyzed the amount of time women and men spend on paid and unpaid household and community work in thirty-one countries across the world, including countries classified as 'industrial, 'developing' and 'transition economies.'&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; They found that in almost every country studied women worked longer hours than men but received fewer economic rewards. The study found that in both the 'developing' and 'industrialized world', men received the "lion's share of income and recognition" for their economic inputs, while women's work remained "unpaid, unrecognized, and undervalued."&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Moreover, in the case of paid and unpaid work hours, the study concluded that within 'industrial countries' women spent "two-thirds" of their total work burden on unpaid activities and "one-third on paid activities" (shares were reversed for men), while in 'developing' countries women spent "two-thirds" of their total work on unpaid labor but "less than one-quarter of the men's" total work was spent on unpaid labor.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Additionally, scholar Ruth Pearson argues that women in developing countries tend to shoulder a majority of the unpaid work due to the fact that men refuse to undertake "women's work" because "women as a gender have obligations of others that men as a gender do not bear."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The uneven distribution of unpaid care labor amongst the sexes is thus demonstrated globally, although particularly in developing countries such as Nigeria and Ecuador, where women redistribute increased unpaid care labor to females from extended family instead of procuring male participation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==== Effects of unpaid domestic work on women ====
[[Time-use survey|Time use surveys]] show that women spend far more time doing unpaid work than men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With women spending more time providing unpaid domestic work than men, women are also spending less time in the workforce and, therefore, bringing in lower incomes to the household.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because women are traditionally believed to bring in less income than men, women are discouraged from investing in education and skills.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This further entrenches women into domestic unpaid work, creating a cycle of social norms that is difficult to break and exacerbates gender inequality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This form of gender inequality feeds into the dynamic of 'gender risks', which explains why it is women and girls that are most disadvantaged, as well as why it is more likely for increased poverty to affect women more than men.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Even if women do enter the workforce, they are usually still held accountable for the majority of the domestic unpaid work at home.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This phenomenon of having to work a full day in the workforce and then come home and complete a full day of unpaid domestic work is known as the [[double burden]]. The double burden negatively affects women because it gives them less time to spend in the workforce, resulting in men dedicating more time to the workforce, and, therefore, likely getting promoted over women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The double burden also negatively affects women's personal wellbeing because it means women have less time for taking care of themselves and sleeping.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This can also negatively affect their job performance in the workforce, encouraging male promotion over female.[[File:Two children share a book.jpg|thumb|left|Older child caring for younger child as a form of unpaid care work]]

==== Effects of unpaid domestic work on children ====
Statistics show that many children, particularly in poorer countries and households, are forced to contribute to the unpaid domestic work of a household.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because unpaid domestic work is traditionally the role of women in many societies, the burden of unpaid domestic work falls particularly on young girls who are forced to drop out of school to assist with the unpaid work within their households.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marphatia|first=Akanksha|last2=Moussie´|first2=Rachel|date=2013|title=A question of gender justice: Exploring the linkages between women'sunpaid care work, education, and gender equality|url=|journal=International Journal of Educational Development|volume=33|pages=585–594|doi=10.1016/j.ijedudev.2013.05.005|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Effects of unpaid domestic work on the economy ====
Some economists argue that unpaid domestic work should be included as economic contributions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The economic value of women's unpaid labor is not included in gross domestic product (GDP) or national income accounting indicators. For this reason, the invisibility of women's work makes analyzing the relationship between households and labor markets difficult. In addition, measures of economic output are largely inaccurate. if unpaid work were incorporated when measuring GDP, it would have raised the GDP by 26 percent in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Accounting for Household Production in the National Accounts|url=https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/05%20May/0512_household.pdf|year=2012|author1=Benjamin Bridgman|author2=Andrew Dugan|author3=Mikhael Lal|author4=Matthew Osborne|author5=Shaunda Villones|page=23|last-author-amp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unpaid work contributes to the economy by producing important goods and services such as meals and cleanliness of the home.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This allows other household members, as well as the women who deal with the double burden (considering the fact that they need care labor to survive, too), to enter the workforce and contribute to the overall economy via paying jobs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For this reason, Indira Hirway argues that unpaid domestic work should be considered [[Production (economics)|economic production]] rather than [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hirway also notes that unpaid domestic work has the attributes of a standard [[Good (economics)|economic good]] because it is neither free nor unlimited.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Unpaid work also affects the [[Labour supply|labor supply]] of the economy because fewer women are entering into the workforce due to their domestic unpaid work duties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Effects of unpaid domestic work on the state ====
Unpaid domestic work has a positive effect on a [[State budget|state's budget]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Unpaid domestic work is typically the type of work that a state would provide for its citizens if family members were not already providing for their family.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This includes things like [[child care]], [[Elderly care|elder care]], [[Health care|medical care]], and [[nutrition]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because these things are being provided by an unpaid domestic worker, the state does not need to expend resources to provide its citizens with these services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, unpaid domestic work can decrease the amount of money a state must spend to otherwise provide these services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Note, however, that when a state cuts care services for the young, elderly, sick and disabled, the burden of this care is generally placed on female family members, meaning decreases in a state's spending on care can have a negative effect on female participation in the workforce.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As noted by Aslanbeigui and Summerfield, when cuts to social expenditures are experienced women and children suffer the most, particularly during financial crises. They argue that cuts to healthcare, education and income disadvantage women in the long-term and push them further into poverty and therefore more reliant on the state.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Relationship to the economy and the paid labor market ===
Unpaid care labor is necessary to maintain order in our global market economy. According to Henderson's Cake Model (known by most as [[Cake theory|Cake Theory]]), reproductive labor and care labor are "key to the functioning of all economies."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Care labor maintains the well-being, and thereby fosters the productivity, of those who are performing paid work. Productivity—along with its ability to be used for personal gain by individuals within the system—is used to produce capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The origin of capitalism: a longer view|last=Wood|first=Ellen Meiksins|publisher=Verso|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of capital: [[financial capital]], which maintains the world's Capitalist practices by placing monetary value on everything that can be deemed "valuable," and [[human capital]], which is "the skills, knowledge, and experience possessed by an individual or population, viewed in terms of their value or cost to an organization or country;" economists consider "expenditures on education, training, medical care, and so on as investments in human capital" because they foster health and well-being in those who work towards producing financial capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human Capital|last=Becker|first=Gary S.|work=The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics|publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human capital, however, is typically valued less than financial capital because the labor done to contribute to human capital is heavily feminized.&lt;ref&gt;Folbre, Nancy. "Caring Labor." Transcription by Oliver Ressler. 2003, UMass Amherst. Video.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since it has become increasingly necessary for more than one individual in a household to join the paid labor force, care labor (especially cooking, cleaning, and child-rearing in the forms of chefs, maids/cleaning staffs, and day-care workers) has become marketized.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; "Workers in [care] sectors are often among the most exploited, receiving low pay and working under precarious conditions."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Valuation  ===
There are three different ways to measure the value of unpaid domestic work: the opportunity cost method, the replacement cost method, and the input/out cost method.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Opportunity cost method ====
The opportunity cost method measures the value of unpaid domestic work by calculating the amount of money unpaid domestic workers could be making if instead of doing unpaid work they were working in the labor market.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luxton|first=Meg|date=June 1997|title=The UN, women, and household labour: Measuring and valuing unpaid work|url=|journal=Women's Studies International Forum|volume=20|issue=3|pages=431–439|doi=10.1016/s0277-5395(97)00026-5|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a former female attorney is now a stay-at-home mother conducting unpaid domestic work, the value of an hour of unpaid domestic work is the hourly rate she could make if she were working as an attorney.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The major flaw with this method is that two unpaid domestic workers can do the same job at the same proficiency level, but the value of the work will fluctuate based on the workers' prior education and skill level.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It is also a problem for women who never held a job, because it is unclear how much money they would be making if they were participating in the work force, rather than working unpaid at home.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Market replacement cost method ====
The replacement cost method measures the value of unpaid domestic work by calculating the monetary cost of purchasing that service instead.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, to value unpaid child care, look at the cost of hiring a nanny, or to value the cost of cooking a meal, look at the cost of eating a similar meal at a restaurant.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The flaw with this method is that it cannot account for the added sentimental value of having a mother stay at home with her children rather than a stranger.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Input/output cost method ====
The input/output cost method measures the value of unpaid domestic work by calculating the monetary value of the economic goods and services produced by unpaid domestic work and how much these goods and services would sell for in the open market.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Policy solutions ==
Dynamic policy solutions that emphasize the value of unpaid labor contributions at the macro level and redistribute unpaid labor within households are essential for gender equality. The following section outlines potential policy solutions that have been put forth by other academics.

'''''Requiring data collection at the national and state level''''' The quality and availability of data at the micro and macro levels is an area in need of improvement for the purpose of studying how policies impact the division of labor within households and for calculating the value unpaid labor. Organizations, such as the United Nations Statistics Division, capture quantitative data on the number of hours women and men spend on paid, unpaid and total work hours. Collecting more qualitative data would be additionally useful for determining how to calculate the value unpaid labor, particularly for the market replacement cost method.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''Investment into public infrastructure'''''  Policies aimed at channeling public funds towards investment projects that create more efficient accessibility to resources are essential for lessening the burden of unpaid labor, particularly in developing countries. As noted by Koolwal and van de Walle (2013), women in rural and developing countries spend a considerable amount of time collecting water. In their study which look at countries in the Middle East, North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia they found that when access to water increased as a result of infrastructure investment women didn't enter into more paid employment, but their overall time spent on unpaid labor did diminish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koolwal, van de Walle|first=Gayatri and Dominique|year=2013|title=Access to Water, Women's Work, and Child Outcomes|url=|journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change|volume=61.2|pages=369–405|via=|doi=10.1086/668280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Subsidized child, elder and care services''''' The state's role in providing quality affordable care services should not be overlooked. Since free childcare would be ineffective at generating income for workers, the services need to be subsidized to ensure that workers are compensated for their labor and that families can afford to use their services&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olmsted|first=Jennifer|year=In Review (2016)|title=Development and Reproductive Rights: Placing Social Sustainability at the Center of the UN's Agenda|url=|journal=In Review (Feminist Economics)|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Subsidized energy (non-reliant on fossil fuels)''''' To reduce the amount of time spent collecting fuel for household energy demands, central governments and states should sponsor renewable energy sources for the purpose of reducing the amount of time women spend of fetching fuelwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sidh, Basu|first=Shiv, Sharmistha|year=2011|title=Women's Contribution to Household Food and Economic Security: A Study in the Garhwal Himalayas, India|url=|journal=Mountain Research and Development|volume=31|pages=102–111|via=|doi=10.1659/mrd-journal-d-10-00010.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, an alternative is investing in biogas production which is a better alternative to standard forms of household fuel given that it is pollution-free[[Undefined?action=edit&amp;section=22|[30]]] leading to a reduction in indoor air pollution that will benefit all members of a household.

'''''Family-friendly workplace policies''''' Shortened work weeks, flexible paid leave and the ability to work from home are possible solutions that would facilitate the redistribution of unpaid labor within households.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; In Nancy Fraser's article, "After the Family Wage: Gender Equity and the Welfare State" from 1994, she suggests that in two partner households a reduced work week is the most efficient vehicle for assuring gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Nancy|year=1994|title=After the Family Wage: Gender Equity and the Welfare State|url=|journal=Political Theory|volume=22|pages=591–618|via=|doi=10.1177/0090591794022004003}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it's essential that policy makers are aware of household dynamics that aren't limited to dual income earning households to ensure that single parents aren't left more vulnerable economically.

'''Zi Corporation''' was a [[software]] company based in [[Calgary]], Canada. The company was founded on 4 December 1987 as Cancom Ventures Inc, owning an [[Edmonton]] secretarial college and an industrial equipment rental business. On 30 August 1989 the name was changed to Multi-Corp Inc. In 1993, board member Michael Lobsinger took control of the company, became CEO, and turned the company towards the [[telecommunications]] industry, purchasing several privately held companies involved in the telecommunications businesses,&lt;ref name=China&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-strategy/china-calling/|title=China calling|publisher=[[Canadian Business]]|date=22 November 2004|last1=Wahl|first1=Andrew|accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in November 1993, Multi-Corp entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Eric Chappell for a stroke-based [[Chinese language|Chinese]] text entry system which they referred to as the ''Jiejing Licenses''.&lt;ref name=Geist&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geist|first1=Richard|title=Investor Therapy: A Psychologist and Investing Guru Tells You How to Out-Psych Wall Street|date=23 Sep 2003|publisher=Crown Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-60960-916-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wholly owned subsidiary, Ziran Developments Inc, was formed to handle the Chinese text entry business. 
The company was listed on the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] on 9 June 1995 (symbol MCU).&lt;ref name=Klein /&gt; Under Lobsinger, the strategic importance of the Chinese text entry grew, and Ziran was renamed Zi Corporation in 1996; ''Zi'' meaning ''character'' in Chinese. 
The telecommunications businesses were disposed of by 1997&lt;ref&gt;[http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/DisplayFiling.aspx?TabIndex=2&amp;FilingID=5832654&amp;companyid=97501&amp;ppu=%252fdefault.aspx%253fcompanyid%253d97501%2526amp%253bformtypeId%253d53 Zi Corp entry], Edgar Online.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1997, the parent company was renamed Zi Corporation to reflect the importance of the new business. In 1999, co-founder [[Gary Kovacs]] joined as COO.&lt;!-- left in 2003 for Macromedia --&gt;

Having started with Chinese on [[personal computer]]s, toward the end of the 1990s Zi's focus moved to text entry for all languages for [[mobile phone]]s and other handheld devices, where efficient entry of text traditionally has been challenging due to limitations of a physically small device.&lt;ref name=China /&gt; This new business area was quickly quite successful, especially in the Chinese market, and in 1998 Zi entered into licensing agreements with Ericsson (later [[Sony Ericsson]]), who at that time was a very significant player in the Chinese market.&lt;ref name=China /&gt;&lt;ref name="1998 Annual Report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zi Corporation 1998 Annual Report|url=http://globaldocuments.morningstar.com/documentlibrary/document/3405d5ef283dbaf1.msdoc/original|website=[[Morningstar, Inc.|Morningstar]]|publisher=Zi Corporation|accessdate=27 December 2015|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further license agreements with Ericsson and other companies were to follow, for a total of more than 1000 different device models being shipped with Zi text entry software,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Au|first1=Maggie|title=Sony Ericsson signs expansion deal with Zi Corp.|journal=[[Telecom Asia]]|date=16 September 2008|url=http://www.telecomasia.net/content/sony-ericsson-signs-expansion-deal-zi-corp-0|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of [[touch screen]] technology for mobile devices made the company follow up with software for handwriting recognition, with focus on languages such as Chinese and [[Japanese language|Japanese]].
In 2003, Mike Donnell took over as CEO from Lobsinger.&lt;ref name=China /&gt;
Zi Corporation was listed on [[NASDAQ]] from September 2007 .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/zi-corporation-application-to-trade-on-the-nasdaq-capital-market-approved-nasdaq-zica-766930.htm Zi Corporation Application to Trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market Approved]&lt;/ref&gt;

Text entry on devices with limited number of keys was early subject to a number of [[software patent]]s, and Zi was engaged in several costly patent disputes with [[Tegic Corporation]], later [[Nuance Communications]].
In August 2008, Nuance made a takeover bid to acquire the company for {{USD|40.4}} million, which the company declined. Shortly thereafter, Nuance filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Zi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kapko|first1=Matt|title=Nuance Sues Zi Corp.

==Products==
Zi's main product was ''EZiText'' [[predictive text entry]] software, in competition with solutions such as the original [[T9 (predictive text)|T9]] product from Tegic, later Nuance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/06/16/zi-announces-advanced-chinese-text-messaging-input-system/ |title=Zi announces advanced Chinese text messaging input system]|publisher=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other products include ''eZiType'', a predictive text entry product for mobile email users, for keyboard-based mobile devices, ''Qix'', a service discovery engine that provides a quick and easy method for accessing a phone's features, applications, and services, and ''Decuma'' which delivers an input method for pen-based devices by fusing handwriting recognition with predictive text technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zi Corporation Completes Acquisition of Assets of Decuma AB of Sweden|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20050126005704/en/Zi-Corporation-Completes-Acquisition-Assets-Decuma-AB|accessdate=29 December 2015|date=26 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patent war==
There was a series of [[patent infringement]] lawsuits between Tegic, the holder of the T9 patents, and Zi:

* In March 2002, the Federal District Court for the Western District of Washington granted Zi partial summary judgment stating that eZiText for alphabetic languages does not infringe Tegic's text input patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Zi+Claims+Second+Patent+Victory+Against+Tegic+Communications,+a+Unit...-a083757620|title=Zi Claims Second Patent Victory Against Tegic Communications, a Unit of AOL Time Warner.|date=14 March 2002|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In September 2002,  the U.S. District Court for Northern California awarded Tegic, owned by [[AOL]] [[Time Warner]], {{USD|9}} million in damages for Zi's infringement of two Tegic patents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6134">'''Živorad "Žika" Petrović''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Живорад Жика Петровић}}; born 1939 in [[Požarevac]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] - died 25 April 2000 in [[Belgrade]], [[Republic of Serbia (1990–2006)|Serbia]], [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|FR Yugoslavia]]) was a Serbian engineer and business executive. He was assassinated during spring 2000. At the time of his death, Petrović was the CEO of Serbian flag carrier [[Jat Airways]]. The crime remains unsolved to this day.

Petrović graduated from the [[University of Belgrade]]'s Faculty of Transport in 1968. He became Jat's CEO in 1992.

He was a member of [[Socialist Party of Serbia]] (SPS), political party headed at the time by [[Slobodan Milošević]].

==Murder==
On Tuesday night, 25 April 2000, around 21:30 [[Central European Time|CET]], Petrović was killed by unknown assassin(s) in front of his parents' home at 20 Jaša Prodanović Street in Belgrade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2000&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=26&amp;nav_category=1&amp;nav_id=6416 Ubijen generalni direktor JAT-a Zika Petrovic, B92, 26 April 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Petrović was reportedly parking his JAT-issued metallic gray Audi in front of the house when two assailants killed him from behind with four bullets to the head and back.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurir-info.rs/cetiri-metka-u-direktora-jata-clanak-268048 Četiri metka u direktora Jata];''Kurir'', 10 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[B92]] reporter on the scene counted five bullet shells, while ''[[Blic (newspaper)|Blic]]'' reported that more than ten bullets were fired at Petrović. The killers likely used a [[suppressor|silencer]] as nobody in the area reported hearing any gun noise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/stara_arhiva/hronika/129906/Ubijen-direktor-JAT-Zika-Petrovic Ubijen direktor JAT Žika Petrović];''Blic'', 26 April 2000&lt;/ref&gt; According to neighbours, the police showed up very quickly after the murder and blocked off the street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2000&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=26&amp;nav_category=1&amp;nav_id=6416 Ubijen generalni direktor JAT-a Zika Petrovic, B92, 26 April 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radomir Marković]], the head of the [[State Security Service (FR Yugoslavia)|State Security Service]], came to the crime scene as well.

The case remains unsolved.

==Reaction==
Due to Petrović's position, longtime [[CEO]] of a large state-owned enterprise, as well as his political connections through SPS party, the murder sparked a lot of domestic and international reaction and press coverage.

===State===
Serbian Ministry of the Interior put out a press release saying: "This is undeniably a terrorist act committed against a high-ranking official of FR Yugoslavia's state-economy. The police is undertaking intense investigative measures to apprehend those that carried out this crime". 

Serbian minister of justice Dragoljub Janković called Petrović's murder a "foreign-imported state terrorism of the very specific kind". He continued: "This is a perfidious attempt at destabilizing the current authorities. One of many similar attempts at tearing down the state institutions that we're seeing around us these days, including the street protests, media interference, and now even executions of state officials. The idea on the part of those who order these acts is clearly to create suspicion, panic, and lack of confidence in the system and authority among the people. The implicit message is probably that some other individuals could come in and bring some order in this area. The fact that these events are thought up and imported from abroad is further making it difficult for our institutions. As is the fact that local unofficial institutions and certain media outlets are taking this side. What's left is the old adage - the justice is slow, but reachable".

===Opposition===
Opposition figures also chimed in. [[Nebojša Čović]], the president of [[Democratic Alternative (Serbia)|Democratic Alternative]] (DA), said: "Because of this murder, the minister of the interior [[Vlajko Stojiljković]] should immediately resign. It's absurd that in Serbia we've never had more policemen, and yet our citizens have never been less safe and secure".

[[Momčilo Perišić]], the president of the Movement for Democratic Serbia (PDS), said that he "knew Petrović personally, though not well enough to speculate on the motives behind his murder", adding: "If the police called this a terrorist act, it means that they're admitting there's terror in Serbia. And if there is terror in Serbia, they're not doing their job properly. I'm afraid our institutions aren't up to the task and that there are certain parallel institutions of sorts created for one-off purposes, such as media intimidation among other things. These parallel institutions have broken free and are now endangering those that created them in the first place".

===Foreign===
Western publications speculated about the reasons for Petrović's murder, especially in light of the fact that it came amidst a 2000 crime wave during which many prominent figures in the country got assassinated&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/anarchy-assassinations-gangland-rule--another-day-in-belgrade-719284.html Anarchy, assassinations, gangland rule - another day in Belgrade, ''The Independent'', 30 April 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; including mobsters [[Željko Ražnatović|Željko "Arkan" Ražnatović]] (15 January), [[Radoslav Trlajić|Radoslav "Bata Trlaja" Trlajić]] (25 February), [[Branislav Lainović|Branislav "Dugi" Lainović]] (20 March), [[Zoran Davidović|Zoran "Ćanda" Davidović]] (23 March), and [[Zoran Uskoković|Zoran "Skole" Uskoković]] (27 April), politicians [[Pavle Bulatović]] (7 February 2000) and [[Ivan Stambolić]] (25 August 2000), even two unsuccessful attempts on the life of opposition politician [[Vuk Drašković]].
