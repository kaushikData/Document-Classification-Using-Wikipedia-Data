'''Alice Garnett''' or '''Alice Crow''' (15 May 1903 â 5 March 1989) was a [[United Kingdom|British]]  geographer at [[Sheffield University]]. She was the second British woman to become a professor of geography and she was vice-president of the [[Royal Geographical Society]]. She was the first woman president of the [[Institute of British Geographers]]&lt;ref name=bits/&gt; and a winner of the [[Murchison Award]].

==Life==
Garnett was born in [[Wandsworth]]. She obtained a degree in Geography at [[University College, London]] and joined the staff of [[Sheffield University]] in 1924 as assistant to the academic and explorer [[Robert Rudmose Brown]]. It was her task to teach and this enabled the university to add Geography to its range of subjects.&lt;ref name=madd/&gt; In 1927 the university began an honours course.&lt;ref name="sheffhist"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/geography/alumni-old/history|title=Our History - Alumni - Geography -  The University of Sheffield|last=Sheffield|first=University of|website=www.sheffield.ac.uk|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 she gained a doctorate.&lt;ref name=madd/&gt; In 1942 she became involved in naval intelligence work preparing two volumes on the geography of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=madd/&gt; In 1945 [[David Leslie Linton|David Linton]] took over as the head of the Geography department. In 1948 she became the second wife of a steelworks manager named Colin Arthur Crow, but she continued to be known as Alice Garnett.&lt;ref name=madd/&gt;

Garnett was the first woman president of the [[Institute of British Geographers]] in 1966&lt;ref name=bits&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gfgrg.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Maddrell.pdf|title=www.gfgrg.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Maddrell.pdf|last=Maddrell|first=Avril|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a winner of the [[Murchison Award]].

Garnett's contribution was eventually recognised with a DSc and a chair at Sheffield University. Her 1958 appointment made her only the second woman to be a British professor of geography.&lt;ref name=sheffhist/&gt; In 1969 she became the vice-president of the [[Royal Geographical Society]].

There are 77 [[Rock cut architecture|rock-cut]] caves at the site. Most have rectangular spaces with rounded [[arch]] [[ceiling]]s often divided into four sections, each with a [[mural]] of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The effect is of entire ceiling covers with hundreds of Buddha murals. Some murals show a large Buddha surrounded by other figures, including Turks, Indians and Europeans. The quality of the murals vary with some being artistically naive while others are masterpieces of religious art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Professor James A.

Golden (2011), ''Central Asia in World History'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 47, {{ISBN|978-0-19-515947-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Sogdians wearing [[silk]] robes are seen in the ''praá¹idhi'' scenes of Bezeklik murals, particularly Scene 6 from Temple 9 showing [[:File:BezeklikSogdianMerchants.jpg|Sogdian donors to the Buddha]].&lt;ref name="gasparini 2014 pp134-163"/&gt; The paintings of Bezeklik, while having a [[Indian art|small amount of Indian influence]], is primarily influenced by [[Chinese art|Chinese]] and [[Persian art|Iranian styles]], particularly [[Sasanian art|Sasanian Persian]] landscape painting.&lt;ref&gt;Sims, Eleanor, Boris I.

The Buddhist Uyghurs of the [[Kingdom of Qocho]] and Turfan were [[Islamicisation and Turkicisation of Xinjiang|converted to Islam by conquest during a ghazat (holy war)]] at the hands of the Muslim [[Chagatai Khanate]] ruler [[Khizr Khoja]] (r. 1389-1399).&lt;ref name="Millward2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=James A.

After being converted to Islam, the descendants of the previously [[Kingdom of Qocho|Buddhist Uyghurs in Turfan]] failed to retain memory of their ancestral legacy and falsely believed that the "infidel Kalmuks" ([[Dzungar people|Dzungars]]) were the ones who built Buddhist monuments in their area.&lt;ref name="GibbLewis1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|author2=Bernard Lewis|author3=Johannes Hendrik Kramers |author4=Charles Pellat |author5=Joseph Schacht|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PJPrAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=...+and+forgetting+all+the+other+highlights+of+their+past,+they+attributed+the+Buddhist+and+other+monuments+to+the+%22infidel+Kalmuks%22.+Both+the+Djungars+and+their+successors+the+Chinese+of+the+Ching+%28Manchu%29+dynasty+who+destroyed+the+Djungars+in+...&amp;dq=...+and+forgetting+all+the+other+highlights+of+their+past,+they+attributed+the+Buddhist+and+other+monuments+to+the+%22infidel+Kalmuks%22.+Both+the+Djungars+and+their+successors+the+Chinese+of+the+Ching+%28Manchu%29+dynasty+who+destroyed+the+Djungars+in+...&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zwSOVaCIDYWp-QHG0InwCg&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA|year=1998|publisher=Brill|page=677}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PJPrAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=...+and+forgetting+all+the+other+highlights+of+their+past,+they+attributed+the+Buddhist+and+other+monuments+to+the+%22infidel+Kalmuks%22.+...+Archaeologie+und+Kunstgeschichte+Chinesisch-^entralasiens+%28Xinjiang%29,+Leiden+1987,+118-42;+Emel+Esin,+IA+art.&amp;dq=...+and+forgetting+all+the+other+highlights+of+their+past,+they+attributed+the+Buddhist+and+other+monuments+to+the+%22infidel+Kalmuks%22.+...+Archaeologie+und+Kunstgeschichte+Chinesisch-^entralasiens+%28Xinjiang%29,+Leiden+1987,+118-42;+Emel+Esin,+IA+art.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vgSOVaCeBYXv-QHWnIKIAg&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA][https://books.google.com/books?id=PJPrAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=infidels+art+buddhist+xinjiang&amp;dq=infidels+art+buddhist+xinjiang&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8saNVeuNJo6cyASqoJXoAw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ][https://books.google.com/books?ei=8saNVeuNJo6cyASqoJXoAw&amp;id=PJPrAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=infidels+art+buddhist+xinjiang&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=infidel+Kalmuks]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti portrait Muslims had Buddhist portraits obliterated during the wars over hundreds of years in which Buddhism was replaced by Islam. Cherrypicking of history of Xinjiang with the intention of projecting an image of irreligiousity or piousness of Islam in Uyghur culture has been done by people with agendas.&lt;ref name="Dillon2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Dillon|title=Xinjiang and the Expansion of Chinese Communist Power: Kashgar in the Early Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J2MtBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=1 August 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-64721-8|pages=4â}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Dillon wrote that the 1000s-1100s Islam-Buddhist war are still recalled in the forms of the [[Khotan]] Imam Asim Sufi shrine celebration and other Sufi holy site celebrations.

The murals at Bezeklik have suffered considerable damage.  Many of the murals were damaged by local Muslim population whose religion [[Aniconism in Islam|proscribed figurative images]] of sentient beings, the eyes and mouths in particular were often gouged out.  Pieces of murals were also broken off for use as fertilizer by the locals.&lt;ref name="whitfield"&gt;{{cite book | title=Conservation of ancient sites on the Silk Road: proceedings of the second International Conference on the Conservation of Grotto Sites, Mogao Grottoes, Dunhuang, People's Republic of China | editor-first=Neville | editor-last=Agnew | publisher=Getty Publications | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-60606-013-1 | chapter=A place of safekeeping?

Some of the best preserved murals were removed by German explorer [[Albert von Le Coq]] and sent to Germany.  Large pieces such as those showing PraÅidhi scene were permanently fixed to walls in Museum of Ethnology in Berlin. During the [[Second World War]] they could not be removed for safekeeping, and were thus destroyed when the museum was caught in the [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|bombing of Berlin]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].&lt;ref name="whitfield"/&gt; Other pieces may now be found in various museums around the world, such as the [[Hermitage Museum]] in St. Petersburg, [[Tokyo National Museum]] in Japan, the [[British Museum]] in London, and the national museums of [[National Museum of Korea|Korea]] and [[National Museum, New Delhi|India]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7177">'''Biological integrity''' is associated with how "pristine" an [[natural environment|environment]] is and its function relative to the potential or original state of an [[ecosystem]] before human alterations were imposed. Biological integrity is built on the assumption that a decline in the values of an ecosystem's [[Aquatic ecosystem#Functions|functions]] are primarily caused by human activity or alterations. The more an environment and its original processes are altered, the less biological integrity it holds for the [[community (ecology)|community]] as a whole. If these processes were to change over time naturally, without human influence, the integrity of the ecosystem would remain intact. The integrity of the ecosystem relies heavily on the processes that occur within it because those determine what [[organism]]s can inhabit an area and the complexities of their interactions.

==History==
The concept of biological integrity first appeared in the 1972 amendments to the U.S. Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the [[Clean Water Act]].&lt;ref&gt;"The objective of this chapter is to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters." Clean Water Act, section 101(a), {{USC|33|1251(a)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) had used the term as a way to gauge the standards to which [[water]] should be maintained, but the vocabulary instigated years of debate about the implications of not only the meaning of biological integrity, but also how it can be [[Water quality#Measurement|measured]]. The first conference about the term occurred in March 1975 called "The Integrity of Water"&lt;ref&gt;Ballentine, R.K. and L.J. Guarraia (editors)(1977). [http://yosemite.epa.gov/water/owrccatalog.nsf/e673c95b11602f2385256ae1007279fe/0fdf60b25f9fc7b585256b0600723dc0!OpenDocument ''The Integrity of Water.''] Proceedings of a Symposium, March 10â12, 1975, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C. EPA Publication No. 832-R-75-103.&lt;/ref&gt;  and provided the first accepted definition of biological integrity (see below). In 1981, EPA assembled a field of experts from the U.S. [[Fish and Wildlife Service]], academia, and its own staff to further refine the definition and identify key [[bioindicator|indicators]] to quantitatively measure biological integrity. The conference not only identified a definition, but also methods to evaluate the community, and they established that multiple sites should be used to determine the condition of the environment&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, R.M., J.H. Gakstatter, M.A. Shirazi.and J.M. Omernik (1982). [http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/AnApproachforDeterminingBiologicalIntegrityinFlowingWaters_hughes_etal_1982.pdf "An approach for determining biological integrity in flowing waters."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612221954/http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/AnApproachforDeterminingBiologicalIntegrityinFlowingWaters_hughes_etal_1982.pdf |date=June 12, 2010 }} Pages 877-888 in T.B. Brown (editor), ''In Place Resource Inventories: Principles and Practices, A National Workshop.'' Paper presented at the workshop August 9â14, 1981. [http://www.safnet.org Society of American Foresters], Bethesda, MD.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Today, the accepted definition is "the capability of supporting and maintaining a balanced, integrated, adaptive community of organisms having a [[species]] composition, [[species diversity|diversity]], and functional organization comparable to that of the natural [[habitat]] of the region."&lt;ref&gt;Karr, J.R. and D.R. Dudley (1981). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/x96t510nu2418348/fulltext.pdf "Ecological perspectives on water quality goals."] [https://www.springer.com/environment/environmental+management/journal/267 ''Environmental Management''] 5:55-68.&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition was adapted from Frey (1977).&lt;ref&gt;Frey, D. 1977. [http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/frey_1977.pdf "Biological integrity of water: an historical approach."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217084900/http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/frey_1977.pdf |date=December 17, 2008 }} Pages 127-140 in Ballentine and Guarraia, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of this definition are that [[living systems]] have a variety of scales relative to which they exist, that one can quantify the parts that sustain or contribute to a system's functioning and that all systems must be seen in the context of their environments and [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary]] history. This term primarily refers to [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic environments]] because the vocabulary is derived from the Clean Water Act, but the concepts can be applied to other ecosystems.

==Evaluation methods==
In order to quantify and evaluate the biological integrity of a system, the '''[[Index of biological integrity|Index of Biological Integrity]] (IBI)''' was created.&lt;ref&gt;Karr, James R. (1981). [http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/AssessmentofBioticIntegrityUsingFishCommunities.pdf "Assessment of biotic integrity using fish communities."]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613002834/http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/AssessmentofBioticIntegrityUsingFishCommunities.pdf |date=June 13, 2010 }} [http://afs.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-moreinfo&amp;issn=1548-8446 ''Fisheries'']{{dead link|date=February 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} 6:21â27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karr, James R. 1991. [https://archive.is/20120730211209/http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.2307/1941848 "Biological integrity: A long-neglected aspect of water resource management."] [http://esapubs.org/esapubs/journals/applications.htm Ecological Applications] 1:66â84.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this index the baseline biological integrity (its function before human influence) and the current functions of an ecosystem are measured against one another to evaluate how much of ecosystem's function has been preserved. The IBI evaluates the ecosystem by utilizing [[biosurvey]]s and comparing [[species richness]], indicator [[taxon|taxa]], [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], and [[invasive species]]. IBIs are used primarily to evaluate [[aquatic ecosystem]]s even though one could technically apply any measurement of biological integrity to any natural ecosystem.

"In an attempt to coin a term that avoided the 'British Isles' â a term often offensive to Irish sensibilities â Pocock suggested a neutral geographical term for the collection of islands located off the northwest coast of continental Europe which included Britain and Ireland: the Atlantic archipelago..."

"..the term is increasingly unacceptable to Irish historians in particular, for whom the Irish Sea is or ought to be a separating rather than a linking element. Sensitive to such susceptibilities, proponents of the idea of a genuine British history, a theme which has come to the fore during the last couple of decades, are plumping for a more neutral term to label the scattered islands peripheral to the two major ones of Great Britain and Ireland."

"In the period between 1600 and 1800, politics meant what we might now term 'high politics', excluding the cultural and social elements that modern analyses of ideology seek to uncover. Politics referred to discussions of dynastic legitimacy, of representation, and of the Constitution. ...

Geography books spanning the period from the Reformation to the Reform Act ... demonstrated their authors' specific political identities by the languages and arguments they deployed.

==Perspectives in Great Britain==
In general, the use of the term [[British Isles]] to refer to the archipelago is common and uncontroversial within [[Great Britain]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, its use can be seen at [http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~brugge/diary.html A Reading University Meteorological Study], and regularly in ''[[The Guardian]]'': [https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1942946,00.html 9 November 2006], [http://environment.guardian.co.uk/conservation/story/0,,1949793,00.html 16 November 2006], [https://www.theguardian.com/tv_and_radio/story/0,,1954927,00.html 23 November 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; at least since the concept of "[[Britishness]]" was gradually accepted in Britain after the 1707 Act of Union. In Britain it is commonly understood as being a politically neutral geographical term, although it is sometimes used to refer to the UK or Great Britain alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithics.com/ Website on Megalithic Monuments in the British Isles and Ireland]. Ireland in this site includes [[County Fermanagh]], which is politically in Northern Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://genuki.cs.ncl.ac.uk/FHMpaper/ GENUKI â The UK and Ireland Genealogical Information Service on the Internet]: The website uses the term "British Isles" in various ways, including ways that use Ireland as all of Ireland, while simultaneously using the term "The British Isles and Ireland", e.g. "Anyone using GENUKI should remember that its name is somewhat misleading â the website actually covers the British Isles and Ireland, rather than just the United Kingdom, and therefore includes information about the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, as well as England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngrs.demon.co.uk.guide.pdf/ Guide to Narrow Gauge rail in the British Isles and Ireland which includes Belfast lines under the section on Ireland.]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/britain_01.shtml |title=British Weather (Part One) |accessdate=2007-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128223800/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/britain_01.shtml |archivedate=28 January 2007 |df=dmy }}. This BBC article referred to "a small country such as the British Isles" between at least April 2004 and January 2007. It was changed in February 2007 and now reads "a small area such as the British Isles".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Google searches of

In 2003, Irish newspapers reported a British Government internal briefing that advised against the use of "British Isles".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tribune.ie/archive/article/2007/sep/23/herr-ambassador-pauls-with-these-comments-you-are-/]{{dead link|date=June 2013}} Herr ambassador Pauls, with these comments, you are really spoiling us..., ''[[Sunday Tribune]]'', 23 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2003/12/13/story496138962.asp Revealed: What the British really think of us], ''[[Irish Examiner]]'', 13 December 2003 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305223723/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2003/12/13/story496138962.asp |date=5 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that its use has been increasingly avoided in recent years in fields like cartography and in some academic work, such as [[Norman Davies]]{{'}}s history of Britain and Ireland ''[[The Isles: A History]]''. As a purely geographical term in technical contexts (such as geology and natural history), there is less evidence of alternative terms being chosen.  Recent histories of Great Britain and Ireland (published by major British academic publishers such as the Oxford and Cambridge University presses) have discussed the acceptability of the term "British Isles" in Ireland, although one study continues to use the term "for convenience".&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Jane E. A. (2002). ''The Politics of Religion in the Age of Mary, Queen of Scots: The Earl of Argyll and the Struggle for Britain and Ireland''. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], p. 2: "Whilst accurate, the term 'Atlantic archipelago' is rather cumbersome so, for convenience, I have used the following as virtual synonyms: the islands of Britain; these islands; the British Isles, and the adjective, British. Without intending to imply any hidden imperial or other agenda, they describe the kingdoms of Ireland, Scotland, and England and Wales as they existed in the sixteenth century, following the definition of the British Isles in the Oxford English Dictionary: 'a geographical term for the islands comprising Great Britain and Ireland with all their offshore islands including the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands'."&lt;/ref&gt; 

Recognition of issues with the term (as well as problems over definitions and terminology) was also discussed by the columnist [[Marcel Berlins]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2006. Beginning with "At last, someone has had the sense to abolish the British Isles", he opines that "although purely a geographical definition, it is frequently mixed up with the political entities Great Britain, or the United Kingdom. Even when used geographically, its exact scope is widely misunderstood". He also acknowledges that some view the term as representing Britain's imperial past, when it ruled the whole of Ireland.&lt;ref name="Berlins"&gt;Marcel Berlins, [https://www.theguardian.com/Columnists/Column/0,,1887065,00.html "Is it really so morally objectionable for the father of a murder victim to accept Â£450,000 'blood money'?"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 4 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Another historian of British and Irish history has described the term as "politically loaded".&lt;ref&gt;"When I refer to the composite Monarchy ruled over by James VI and I and by King Charles I, it is always described as Britain and Ireland, and I deliberately avoid the politically loaded phrase 'the British Isles' not least because this was not a normal usage in the political discourse of the time". Canny, Nicholas (2001). ''Making Ireland British 1580â1650''. New York: [[Oxford University Press]], p. viii. {{ISBN|978-0-19-925905-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspectives in Ireland==

===Republic of Ireland===
From the Irish perspective, some consider "The British Isles" as a political term rather than a geographical name for the archipelago. The term "British" had also never applied to Ireland until at least the late 16th century&lt;ref&gt;"Geographers may have formed the habit of referring to the archipelago consisting of Britain and Ireland as the Britannic isles, but there never had been a historical myth linking the islands. Medieval historians, such as the twelfth-century [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], had developed the idea that Britain (i.e. England, Scotland, and Wales) had first been settled by [[Troy|Trojan]] refugees fleeing after the capture and destruction of their city by the Greeks. The founding monarch â [[Brutus of Troy|Brutus]] â had then divided up the island between his three sons, the eldest (Albion) inheriting England and the younger sons Scotland and Wales. This permitted English antiquarians to claim a superiority for the English nation and the English Crown. In the fourteenth century the Scots developed their own counter-myth which acknowledged that Trojans had first occupied England and Wales, but asserted that Scotland had been occupied by colonists from Greece â the conquerors of Troy. Faced by such Scottish counter-myths and by the scepticism bred of humanist scholarship, few people took any of these historical claims seriously by 1600. English claims that kings of Scotland had regularly recognised the [[feudalism|feudal]] [[suzerainty]] of the English Crown had to be abandoned in 1603 when the Scottish royal house inherited the English Crown. But the fact is that many of the inhabitants of Britain â especially intellectuals around the royal Courts â had for centuries conceptualised a relationship which bound them together into a common history. There was no historical myths binding Ireland into the story. The term 'Britain' was widely understood and it excluded Ireland; there was no geopolitical term binding together the archipelago." [[John Morrill (historian)|John Morrill]], 1996, ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Tudor and Stuart Britain'', Oxford University Press: Oxford. &lt;br /&gt; "When I refer to the composite monachy ruled over by James VI and I and by King Charles I, it is always described as Britain and Ireland, and I deliberately avoid the politically loaded phrase 'the British Isles' not least because this was not a normal usage in the political discourse of the time." Canny, Nicholas (2001). ''op. cit.'', p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; and onwards. This period coincided with the Tudor conquest of Ireland, the subsequent Cromwellian activities in Ireland, the Williamite accession in Britain and the [[Williamite War in Ireland]]âall of which resulted in severe impact on the Irish people, landowners and native aristocracy. From that perspective, the term "British Isles" is not a neutral geographical term but an unavoidably political one. Use of the name "British Isles" is often rejected in the Republic of Ireland,  because some claim its use implies a primacy of British identity over all the islands outside the United Kingdom, including the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish state]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/donald-clarke-saoirse-ronan-being-claimed-by-the-uk-not-a-compliment-1.2490426.|title=Donald Clarke: Saoirse Ronan being claimed by the UK not âa complimentâ|website=Irishtimes.com|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Crown dependencies]] of the [[Isle of Man]] and [[Channel Islands]] that was historically dominating and is currently inaccurate, since Ireland is neither Britain nor British.&lt;ref&gt;The readers' editor of ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Ian Mayes]], noted indirect reports of concerns.

Many political bodies, including the Irish government, avoid describing Ireland as being part of the British Isles; [[Ãamon de Valera]] corrected [[John Gunther]] when the journalist used the term during a private meeting in the mid-1930s.&lt;ref name="gunther1940"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n395/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers | author=Gunther, John | year=1940 | pages=373-374}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term "British Isles" has been used by individual ministers, as did cabinet minister [[SÃ­le de Valera]] when delivering a speech including the term at the opening of a drama festival in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arts-sport-tourism.gov.ie/publications/release.asp?ID=256 |title=Speech by SÃ­le de Valera, T.D., Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands at the opening of the Clare Drama Festival in Scarriff Community College |accessdate=25 August 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614100456/http://www.arts-sport-tourism.gov.ie/publications/release.asp?ID=256 |archivedate=14 June 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used by government departments in relation to geographic topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ie/search/?q=%22british+isles%22|title=Gov.ie|website=Gov.ie|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was formally disavowed in September 2005 by the Irish Government when Foreign Minister [[Dermot Ahern]] stated: "The British Isles is not an officially recognised term in any legal or inter-governmental sense.

===Northern Ireland===
Different views on terminology are probably most clearly seen in [[Northern Ireland]] (which covers six of the thirty-two counties in Ireland), where the political situation is difficult and national identity contested.  A survey in [[Northern Ireland]] found that [[Unionism (Ireland)|Unionists]] generally considered the British Isles to be a natural geographical entity, considering themselves British and are mainly descendants of British settlers in Ireland. Another survey highlighted the British and Irish identity of the Protestant community, showing that 51% of Protestants felt "not at all Irish" and 41% only "weakly Irish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/1999/Community_Relations/IRISH.html |title=Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey, 1999.

Module: Community Relations. Variable: British]: Summary: 78% of Protestants replied "Strongly British."&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Irish nationalism|Nationalists]] considered their community to be that of the Irish nationâa distinct cultural and political community extending across the whole of Ireland. Identities were diverse and multi-layered, and Irishness was a highly contested identity; Nationalists expressed difficulty in understanding Unionist descriptions of Britishness.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Hennessey and Robin Wilson, [http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/dd/report7/report7c.htm With all due respect â pluralism and parity of esteem], ''Democratic Dialogue'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall opinion of the Northern Irish people about the term (like the opinion of those in the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain) has never been formally gauged. Politicians from the [[Irish Unionist]] tradition readily use the term "British Isles";&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/peace/docs/dt17498.htm Speech by the Rt Hon David Trimble to the Northern Ireland Forum]. Retrieved 16 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/peace/docs/dt20399.htm Speech by Mr David Trimble to the AGM of the Ulster Unionist Council, 20 March 1999]. Retrieved 16 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; the contrast between Unionist and Nationalist approaches to the term was shown in December 1999 at a meeting of the [[Government of Ireland|Irish Cabinet]] and [[Northern Ireland Executive]] in [[Armagh]]. The [[First Minister of Northern Ireland]], David Trimble, told the meeting:
{{quote|This represents the Irish government coming back into a relationship with the rest of the British Isles. We are ending the cold war that has divided not just Ireland but the British Isles. That division is now going to be transformed into a situation where all parts work together again in a way that respects each other.&lt;ref name="Irish Independent 1999-12-14"&gt;[http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=9&amp;si=526352&amp;issue_id=5391 Partnership plan for peace and prosperity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040122184841/http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=9&amp;si=526352&amp;issue_id=5391 |date=22 January 2004 }}, ''[[Irish Independent]]'', 14 December 1999. Retrieved 16 July 2006. &lt;/ref&gt;}}

In contrast, the [[Taoiseach]], [[Bertie Ahern]], did not use the term in his address to the meeting.&lt;ref name="Irish Independent 1999-12-14"/&gt;

At a gathering of the [[BritishâIrish Inter-Parliamentary Body]] in 1998, sensitivity about the term became an issue. Referring to plans for the proposed [[BritishâIrish Council]] (supported by both Nationalists and Unionists), British MP for Falkirk West [[Dennis Canavan]] was paraphrased by official note-takers as having said in a caveat:

{{quote|He understood that the concept of a Council of the Isles had been put forward by the [[Ulster Unionist]]s and was referred to as a "Council for the British Isles" by [[David Trimble]]. This would cause offence to Irish colleagues; he suggested as an acronym IONA-Islands of the North Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biipb.org/biipb/summary/sum/doc/8033001/8033012.htm British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body. 15th Plenary Session. 30 March 1998] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706125114/http://www.biipb.org/biipb/summary/sum/doc/8033001/8033012.htm |date=6 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a series of documents issued by the United Kingdom and Ireland, from the [[Downing Street Declaration]] to the [[Good Friday Agreement]] (Belfast Agreement), relations in the British Isles were referred to as the "EastâWest strand" of the tripartite relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Three sets of relationships were defined. (i) Within Northern Ireland. (ii) ''NorthâSouth'' for the relationship between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and (iii) ''EastâWest'' for relationships on the islands.&lt;/ref&gt;

==More alternative terms==
{{rquote|right|And [de Valera] set out to explain the difference between Ireland and the "British Isles."

There are several terms used as alternatives for the term "British Isles" other than those cited above:

===British Isles and Ireland===
A term sometimes used is "British Isles and Ireland".  Similar to "Great Britain and Ireland", this has been used in a variety of contextsâamong others religious,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prayer-alert.net/prayer_association_BII.htm |title=Prayer Association of British Isles and Ireland |website=Prayer-alert.net |date= |accessdate=3 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009083703/http://www.prayer-alert.net/prayer_association_BII.htm |archivedate=9 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; medical,&lt;ref&gt;Macey &amp; Morgan, ''Learning on the road: nursing in the British Isles and Ireland'' (Vanderbilt University School of Nursing, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; zoologic,&lt;ref&gt;Badham, M., and Richards, V.

This form is also used in some book titles&lt;ref&gt;For example, P. North, ''The Private International Law of Matrimonial Causes in the British Isles and the Republic of Ireland'' (1977).&lt;/ref&gt; and legal publications.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Law Society Gazette'', [[Law Society of Ireland]], July 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islands of the North Atlantic (or IONA)===
In the context of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], the term "[[Islands of the North Atlantic]]" (and its acronym, IONA) was a term created by then-[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] MP [[John Biggs-Davison|Sir John Biggs-Davison]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openrepublic.org/open_republic/20050701_vol1_no1/articles/20050619_ru.htm Open Republic]. Retrieved 5 July 2006.  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130415123914/http://www.openrepublic.org/open_republic/20050701_vol1_no1/articles/20050619_ru.htm |date=15 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used as a term to denote either all the islands, or the two main islands, without referring to the two states.

IONA has been used by (among others) the former Irish [[Taoiseach]] (Prime Minister), [[Bertie Ahern]]:

{{quote|The Government are, of course, conscious of the emphasis that is laid on the East-West dimension by Unionists, and we are, ourselves, very mindful of the unique relationships that exist within these islands â islands of the North Atlantic or IONA as some have termed them.&lt;ref&gt;Statement by the Taoiseach and Leader of Fianna FÃ¡il, Mr Bertie Ahern, TD on "[http://foreignaffairs.gov.ie/Press_Releases/19971205/273.htm Northern Ireland: Political Situation and Developments] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827161442/http://foreignaffairs.gov.ie/Press_Releases/19971205/273.htm |date=27 August 2006 }}" at the Forty-Second Plenary Session of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, [[Dublin Castle]], 5 December 1997 &lt;/ref&gt;}}

Others have interpreted the term more narrowly to mean the "Council of the Isles" or "[[British-Irish Council]]".  [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Peter Luff]] told the [[British House of Commons]] in 1998 that

{{quote|In the same context, there will be a council of the isles. I think that some people are calling it IONA â the islands of the north Atlantic, from which England, by definition, will be excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons, Westminister |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo980116/debtext/80116-14.htm |title=House of Commons. Vol.304. Col.663. 16 January 1998 |website=Publications.parliament.uk |date=16 January 1998 |accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His interpretation is not widely shared, particularly in Ireland.  In 1997 the leader of the Irish [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] [[Trevor Sargent]], discussing the ''Strand Three'' (or ''EastâWest'') talks between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, commented in [[DÃ¡il Ãireann]] (the Irish House of Representatives):

{{quote|I noted with interest the naming of the islands of the north Atlantic under the acronym IONA which the Green Party felt was extremely appropriate.&lt;ref name="DÃ¡ilDebates"&gt;[http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0484/D.0484.199712090003.html DÃ¡il Debates.

His comments were echoed by [[Proinsias De Rossa]], then leader of the [[Democratic Left (Ireland)|Democratic Left]] and later President of the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Irish Labour Party]], who told the DÃ¡il, "The acronym IONA is a useful way of addressing the coming together of these two islands."&lt;ref name="DÃ¡ilDebates" /&gt;

This name is ambiguous, because of the other islands in the North Atlantic which have never been considered part of the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northatlantic-islands.com/ |title=Introduction to the three Northatlantic Islands |website=Northatlantic-islands.com |date= |accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northwest European Archipelago===
Some academics in the 1990s and early 2000s also used the term "Northwest European archipelago";&lt;ref&gt;David Armitage, "Greater Britain: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis?" in ''[[American Historical Review]]'', Vol. 104, No. 2 (Apr. 1999) p.427.&lt;/ref&gt; however, its use appears sporadically in historiography and rare outside it.

===West European Isles===
The name "West European Isles" is one translation of the islands' name in the [[Goidelic|Gaelic]] languages of Irish&lt;ref&gt;''OileÃ¡in Iarthair Eorpa'' seems rather appropriate, in Patrick Dinneen. 1927.

A somewhat similar usage exists in [[Iceland]]. "Westman" is the Icelandic name for a person from the Gaelic areas of Britain and Ireland (Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man), and "the Western Lands" is the translation of the name for the islands in Icelandic.&lt;ref&gt;"Vest-madr", "Vestr-lond" R Cleasby &amp; [[G. Vigfusson]] IcelandicâEnglish Dictionary Oxford 1874&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pretanic Isles===
A return to the Greek term "Pretan(n)ic Isles" has been suggested and has seen some use in academic contexts, particularly in reference to the islands in the pre-Roman era.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Insular===
[[Insular art]] and [[Insular script]] are uncontroversial terms in art history and [[palaeography]] for the early medieval art and writing of all the islands.  [[Insular Celtic]] is a similar term in linguistics. However, this adjective is used only in relation to artefacts originating over a thousand years ago.

==Names of the islands through the ages==
{{Main article|Terminology of the British Isles}}
In classical times, several [[Greco-Roman]] geographers used derivatives of the [[Celtic languages]]' term ''Pretani'' (such as "Brit-" or "Prit-" with various endings) to refer to the islands northwest of the European mainland; several included islands not currently viewed as part of the "British Isles"â[[Thule]], for example. During the Roman era, the word "[[Britannia]]" came to mean the [[Roman province of Britain]] in particular.

Other early classical geographers (and native sources in the post-Roman period) used the general term {{lang|la|oceani insulae}}, which meant "islands of the ocean". Great Britain was called "Britannia"; Ireland was known as "Hibernia" and, between about the 5th and 11th centuries, "[[Scotia]]". The [[Orkney Islands]] ("Orcades") and the [[Isle of Man]] were typically also included in descriptions of the islands. No collective term for the islands was used other than "islands of the Ocean".

The Latin version of "British Isles" came to be used again in Europe with the rediscovery of Ptolemy's Geographica in the 14th Century.  By the middle of the 16th Century the term appears on maps made by geographers including George Lily&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/unvbrit/b/001ktop00000005u00002000.html|title=BRITANNIAE INSULAE QUAE NUNC ANGLIAE ET SCOTIAE REGNA CONTINENT CUM HIBERNIA ADIACENTE NOVA DESCRIPTIO|first=Colin|last=Wright|website=Bl.uk|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sebastien Munster&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~genmaps/genfiles/COU_files/ENG/aaEng/munster_england_1550.htm|title=munster_england_1550|first=David|last=Baxendell|website=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The term "British Isles" entered the English language in the late 16th century to refer to Great Britain, Ireland and the surrounding islands.  In general, the modern notion of "Britishness" evolved after the 1707 Act of Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Snyder| 2003|p=281}} quoting Linda Colley.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is probably the most common term for the islands, this use is not universally accepted and is generally rejected in Ireland.&lt;ref name=Pocock01&gt;"...(which) I have called the Atlantic archipelago â since the term 'British Isles' is one which Irishmen reject and Englishmen decline to take quite seriously." Pocock, J.G.A. (2006). ''The Discovery of Islands''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p29. {{ISBN|978-0-521-85095-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pretanic Islands and Britanniae===
The earliest known names for the islands come from [[Greco-Roman]] writings. Sources included the [[Massaliote Periplus]] (a merchants' handbook from around 500 BC describing sea routes)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Snyder| 2003|p=12}},{{Harvnb | Ã CorrÃ¡in| 1989|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Cunliffe| 2002|pp=38â45, 94}} The [[Massaliote Periplus]] describes a sea route south round the west coast of Spain from the promontory of [[Oestriminis]] ([[Cape Finisterre]]) back to the Mediterranean. The poem by [[Avienus]] makes used of it in describing the voyage of [[Himilco the Navigator]], also incorporating fragments from 11 ancient writers including [[Pytheas]]. When Avienus says it's two days sailing from Oestriminis to the Holy Isle, inhabited by the Hierni, near Albion, this differs from the sailing directions of the Periplus and implies that Oestriminis is [[Brittany]], a conflict explained if it had been taken by Avienus from one of his other sources.&lt;/ref&gt; and the travel writings of the Greek, [[Pytheas]], from around 320 BC. Although the earliest texts have been lost, excerpts were quoted or paraphrased by later authors. The main islands were called "Ierne", equal to the term ''[[Ãriu]]'' for Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Ã CorrÃ¡in| 1989|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Albion]]" for present-day Great Britain. These later writers referred to the inhabitants as the {{lang|grc|Î ÏÎµÏÏÎ±Î½Î¿Î¹}}, "Priteni" or "Pretani", probably from a [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] term meaning "people of the forms";&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Snyder| 2003|pp=12, 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Pretannia" as a place-name was [[Diodorus]]' rendering (in Greek) of this self-description. It is often taken as a reference to the practice by the inhabitants of painting (or [[tattoo]]ing) their skin; since it is unusual for an [[autological word|autonym]] (a self-description) to describe appearance, this name may have been used by [[Armorica]]ns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Cunliffe| 2002|p=95}},&lt;/ref&gt; There is considerable confusion about early use of these terms and the extent to which similar terms were used as self-description by the inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Cunliffe| 2002|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this name a collective term for the islands was used, appearing as {{lang|grc|Î±á¼± Î ÏÎµÏÎ±Î½Î¹ÎºÎ±Î¹ Î½Î·ÏÎ¿Î¹}} ("Pretanic Islands")&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | O'Rahilly| 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|grc|Î±á¼± ÎÏÎµÏÏÎ±Î½Î¹Î±Î¹}} ("Brittanic Isles").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Snyder| 2003|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognates of these terms are still in use.&lt;ref&gt;Cognates of ''Albion'' (normally referring only to Scotland) â ''Albion'' (archÃ¦ic); {{lang-kw|Alban}}; {{lang-ga|Alba}}; {{lang-gv|Albey}}; {{lang-sco|Albiane}}; {{lang-gd|Alba}}; {{lang-cy|Yr Alban}}. Cognates of ''Ierne'' â ''Ireland''; {{lang-kw|Iwerdhon}}; {{lang-ga|Ãire}}; {{lang-gv|Nerin}}; {{lang-sco|Irland}}; {{lang-gd|Ãirinn}}; {{lang-cy|Iwerddon}} though in English ''Albion'' is deliberately archÃ¦ic or poetical. Cognates of ''Priteni'' â {{lang-cy|Prydain}}; ''Briton'' and ''''British''''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The island group had long been known collectively as the Pretanic or Britanic isles. As explained by Pliny the Elder, this included the Orcades (Orkney), the HÃ¦budes (Hebrides), Mona (Anglesey), Monopia (Isle of Man), and a number of other islands less certainly identifiable from his names. The deduced Celtic name for Ireland - Iverio - from which its present name was derived, was known to the Greeks by the 4th century BC at least, possibly as early as the 6th century BC. The name meant "the fertile land". It was Latinised to Hiernia or Hibernia. Its people were the Iverni.{{fact|date=March 2017}}

In 55 and 54 BC, [[Caesar's invasions of Britain]] brought firsthand knowledge; in his ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', he introduced the term [[Britannia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 4#20|4.20]] provides a translation describing Caesar's first invasion, using terms which from [[wikisource:Commentarii de bello Gallico - Liber IV#20|IV.XX]] appear in [[Latin]] as arriving "{{lang|la|tamen in Britanniam}}", the inhabitants being "Britannos", and on p30 "{{lang|la|principes Britanniae}}" is translated as "chiefs of Britain".&lt;/ref&gt;

Around AD 70, [[Pliny the Elder]], in Book 4 of his ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Naturalis Historia]]'', describes the islands he considers to be "Britanniae" as including Great Britain, Ireland, Orkney, smaller islands such as the Hebrides, the Isle of Man, Anglesey, possibly one of the Frisian Islands, and islands which have been identified as [[Ushant]] and Sian. He refers to Great Britain as the island called "Britannia", noting that its former name was "Albion". The list also includes the island of Thule, most often identified as Icelandâalthough some express the view that it may have been the [[Faroe Islands]]âthe coast of [[Norway]] or [[Denmark]], or possibly [[Shetland]].&lt;ref name = "Bostock"&gt;"The opinions as to the identity of ancient Thule have been numerous in the extreme. We may here mention six:
# The common, and apparently the best founded opinion, that Thule is the island of [[Iceland]].
# That it is either the [[Faroe Islands|Ferroe group]], or one of those islands.
# The notion of [[Abraham Ortelius|Ortelius]], [[Thomas Farnaby|Farnaby]], and [[Gerhard SchÃ¸ning|SchÅnning]], that it is identical with [[Telemark|Thylemark]] in Norway.
# The opinion of [[Conrad Malte-Brun|Malte Brun]], that the continental portion of [[Denmark]] is meant thereby, a part of which is to the present day called [[Thy (district)|Thy]] or Thyland.
# The opinion of Rudbeck&lt;!-- [[Olaus Rudbeck]] or [[Olof Rudbeck the Younger]] ? --&gt; and of Calstron, borrowed originally from [[Procopius]], that this is a general name for the whole of [[Scandinavia]].
# That of Gosselin, who thinks that under this name [[Mainland, Shetland|Mainland]], the principal of the [[Shetland Islands]], is meant.

It is by no means impossible that under the name of Thule two or more of these localities may have been meant, by different authors writing at distant periods and under different states of geographical knowledge. It is also pretty generally acknowledged, as Parisot remarks, that the Thule mentioned by Ptolemy is identical with Thylemark in Norway."{{Cite book|editor=[[John Bostock (physician)|John Bostock]] and [[Henry Thomas Riley]]|year=1855 |title=The Natural History of Pliny |chapter=Britannia |chapterurl=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137&amp;query=head%3D%23179 |pages=footnote No. 16 |oclc=615995 |nopp=true }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical writer [[Claudius Ptolemy]], referred to the larger island as ''great Britain'' (''megale Bretannia'') and to Ireland as ''little Britain'' (''mikra Brettania'') in his work, ''[[Almagest]]'' (147â148 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Claudii Ptolemaei Opera quae exstant omnia|author=Claudius Ptolemy|authorlink=Ptolemy|editor1-last=Heiberg|editor1-first=J.L.|publisher=in aedibus B.

Ptolemy included essentially the same main islands in the Britannias. He wrote around AD 150, although he used the now-lost work of [[Marinus of Tyre]] from about fifty years earlier.&lt;ref name=ohi&gt;{{Harvnb | Ã CorrÃ¡in| 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first description is of Ireland, which he called "Hibernia". Second was the island of Great Britain, which he called "Albion". Book II, Chapters 1 and 2 of his ''Geography'' are respectively titled as ''Hibernia, Island of Britannia'' and ''Albion, Island of Britannia''. Ptolemy included Thule in the chapter on Albion, although the coordinates he gives have been mapped to the area around modern Kristiansund in western Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Since meridian 30Â° P corresponds to our meridian 8Â°24'E, Thule must be identified with the maze of islands and fjords around the three main islands that form the city of Kristiansund â [http://www.metrum.org/mapping/thule.htm Thule], ''The Mapping of the Earth''&lt;/ref&gt; The famous ''Geography'' of Claudius Ptolemy, written in Greek c. 150 AD, included the British Isles. Ptolemy relied on the work of an earlier geographer, Marinos of Tyre. So the ''Geography'' generally reflects the situation c. 100 AD and he retained the names used for the islands by Pliny the Elder: Albion for Britain, and Ierne (Latinised as Hibernia) for Ireland.

Following the [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest of AD 43]] the [[Roman Britain|Roman province]] of [[Britannia]] was established,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Snyder| 2003|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roman Britain]] expanded to cover much of the island of Great Britain. An invasion of Ireland was considered but never undertaken, and Ireland remained outside the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Ã CorrÃ¡in| 1989|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans failed to consolidate their hold on the [[Scottish Highlands]]; the northern extent of the area under their control (defined by the [[Antonine Wall]] across central Scotland) stabilised at [[Hadrian's Wall]] across the north of England by about AD 210.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Snyder| 2003|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inhabitants of the province continued to refer to themselves as "Brittannus" or "Britto", and gave their ''patria'' (homeland) as "Britannia" or as their tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Snyder| 2003|p=54}} refers to epigraphic evidence from those Britons at home and abroad who left Latin inscriptions.&lt;/ref&gt; The vernacular term "Priteni" came to be used for the barbarians north of the Antonine Wall, with the Romans using the tribal name "[[Caledonians|Caledonii]]" more generally for these peoples who (after AD 300) they called [[Picts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Snyder| 2003|p=68}}, {{Harvnb | Cunliffe| 2002|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-conquest Romans used Britannia or Britannia Magna (Large Britain) for Britain and Hibernia or Britannia Parva (Small Britain) for Ireland. The post-Roman era saw [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] kingdoms established in all areas of Britain except the [[Scottish Highlands]], but coming under increasing attacks from [[Picts]], [[Scoti|Scotti]] and [[Anglo-Saxons]]. At this time Ireland was dominated by the Gaels or Scotti, who subsequently gave their names to Ireland and Scotland.

===Oceani insulae===
In classical geography, the Mediterranean world was thought to be surrounded by a fast-flowing river, personified as the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Oceanus]]. As a result, islands off the north and west shores of continental Europe were termed (in Latin) the ''Oceani Insulae'' or "islands of the Ocean." In AD 43, various islands (including Britain, Ireland, and Thule) were referred to as ''Septemtrionalis Oceani Insulae'' ("islands of the Northern Ocean") by [[Pomponius Mela]], one of the earliest Roman geographers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ourworld.cs.com/latintexts/m306.htm Pomponii melÃ¦] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012193907/http://ourworld.cs.com/latintexts/m306.htm |date=12 October 2008 }} de situ orbis.&lt;/ref&gt;

This term was also used by indigenous sources during the post-Roman period, who also used the term ''Oceani Insulae'' as a term for the islands in the Atlantic and elsewhere. One such example is the ''Life of Saint Columba'', a [[hagiography]] recording the [[missionary]] activities of the 6th century Irish monk [[Saint Columba]] among the peoples of modern-day Scotland. It was written in the late 7th century by [[AdomnÃ¡n of Iona]], an Irish monk living on the [[Inner Hebridean]] island.&lt;ref&gt;Book 2, 46 in the Sharpe edition = Book 2, 47 in Reeves edition.&lt;/ref&gt; No ''Priteni''-derived collective reference is made.  [[Jordanes]], writing in his AD 551 ''[[Getica (Jordanes)|Getica]]'', describes the islands (particularly in the Western Ocean) as "islands of the Ocean"; he named various islands in the North Atlantic, and believed Scandinavia to be one of them.&lt;ref&gt;Jordanes, [http://www.hieronymus.us/Goths/Goths1.htm Getica â De Origine Actibusque Gothorum], Chapter 1, section 7â9.&lt;/ref&gt; He described Britain, but does not mention Ireland.

Another native source to use the term is the ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' of [[Bede]], written in the early 8th century. Bede's work does not have a collective term for the archipelago, referring to "Brittania" solely as the island "formerly called Albion" and treating Ireland separately. As with Jordanes and Columba, he refers to Britain as being ''Oceani insula'' or "island of the Ocean".&lt;ref&gt;Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation'', Book I â In [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bede.html Latin] and [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/bede-book1.html English]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isidore of Seville]]'s ''Etymology'', written in the early 7th century and one of the most popular textbooks in Europe during the Middle Ages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08186a.htm Isidore], ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt; similarly lists Britain ("Britannia"), Ireland ("Scotia" or "Hibernia"), Thule, and many other islands simply as "islands" or "islands of the Ocean" and uses no collective term.

In the 17th century, [[Peter Heylin]], in his ''Microcosmus'', described the classical conception of the Ocean and included in the "Iles of the Ocean" all the classically known offshore islandsâ[[Zealand]], the British Isles, and those in the "Northerne Sea".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Heylin, ''Microcosmus'' (1621), pp. 453â454.&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Isles===
[[File:British Empire 1897.jpg|thumb|right|The term ''British Isles'' came into use in English at the same time as the term ''British Empire.''  This map shows the British Isles (red) at the centre of the empire (pink) in 1897 where England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales are referred to as the [[Home Nations]].]]

In his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' of around 1136, [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] responded to the slights of English historians with his theme of the [[sovereignty]] of [[Great Britain|Britain]]âexalting Welsh national history, portraying a once-unified [[Britannia]] (founded by [[Brutus of Troy]]) defended by [[King Arthur]]'s [[British people|Britons]] against [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] invasion. Arthur (who was now sleeping) would one day return to the rescue. By the end of the twelfth century this adaptation of myths common to [[Wales]], Cornwall and [[Brittany]] had been adapted in the service of Englandâwith [[Henry II of England]] enthusiastically taking up [[Arthurian legend]], and [[Edward I of England]] putting on pageantry to show the Welsh that he was Arthur's heir. The Welsh (and the Scots' [[Edward Bruce]]) used the legends to find common cause as one "kin and nation" in driving the English out of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Snyder| 2003|pp=231â6, 243â6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Welsh rebels and English monarchs (particularly [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]]) continued such claims; Henry had Welsh ancestry, and claimed descent from Arthur. His son [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] incorporated Wales into England; he also claimed to be an heir of Arthur, as did his successor [[Elizabeth I of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Snyder| 2003|pp=274â276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rediscovery of [[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Ptolemy's ''Geographia'']] by [[Maximus Planudes]] in 1300 brought new insight, and circulation of copies widened when it was translated into Latin in 1409.&lt;ref&gt;Jeppe Strandsbjerg, 2006, {{cite web|url=http://www.bisa.ac.uk/2006/pps/strandsbjerg.pdf |title=The Cartographic Production of Territory: mapping and Danish state formation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224221229/http://www.bisa.ac.uk/2006/pps/strandsbjerg.pdf |archivedate=24 February 2009 |df= }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(1.39&amp;nbsp;MB)}}, BISA Conference, University College Cork writes: "The translation of Ptolemyâs Geography into Latin in 1409 is frequently named as the symbolic beginning of this process because it (re-)introduced the principles that inform scientific cartography to Western Europe."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Utpal Mukhopadhyay, {{cite web|url= http://www.ias.ac.in/resonance/Mar2005/pdf/Mar2005p08-18.pdf |title=Mercator and his Map }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(945&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, Renonance, March 2005: "The Geographia of Ptolemy contained a world map and twenty six other maps.

In the sixteenth century, publication of maps became a lucrative business. However, as regards distortion in shape and distance, these maps were of the same standard as that of Ptolemy's map. The person who liberated mapmaking from the influence of Ptolemy was Gerhard Mercator.")&lt;/ref&gt; This spread Ptolemy's naming of Hibernia and Albion as "Island[s] of Britannia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gwu.edu/gelman/spec/researchguides/bibliographies/holy_land_maps.pdf |title=Maps of the Holy Land in Special Collections }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(345&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, The George Washington University ("With the expansion of Western power came Europe's rediscovery of Claudius Ptolemy's Geographia (150 AD), the earliest known atlas of the world.

The geographer and occultist [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] (of Welsh ancestry)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johndee.org/charlotte/Chapter1/1p3.html Chapter 1, p. 3] from {{Cite book|author=Fell Smith, Charlotte|year=1909|title=John Dee: 1527â1608|location=London|publisher=Constable and Company|url=http://www.johndee.org/charlotte/}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an adviser to Queen Elizabeth I of England and prepared maps for several explorers. He helped to develop legal justifications for colonisation by [[English Reformation|Protestant England]], breaking the [[duopoly]] the Pope [[Inter caetera|had granted]] to the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Empire]]s. Dee coined the term "[[British Empire]]" and built his case, in part, on the claim of a "British Ocean"; including Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Greenland and (possibly) North America, he used alleged Saxon precedent to claim territorial and trading rights.&lt;ref name=kenm&gt;Ken MacMillan, 2001, "[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3686/is_200104/ai_n8932217/pg_1 Discourse on history, geography, and law: John Dee and the limits of the British empire]", in ''Canadian Journal of History'', April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Current scholarly opinion is generally that "his imperial vision was simply propaganda and antiquarianism, without much practical value and of limited interest to the English crown and state."&lt;ref name=kenm/&gt; The [[Lordship of Ireland]] had come under tighter English control as the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], and diplomatic efforts ([[Rough Wooing|interspersed with warfare]]) tried to bring Scotland under the English monarch as well. Dee used the term "Brytish Iles" in his writings of 1577, which developed his arguments claiming these territories.&lt;ref&gt;John Dee, ''General and rare memorials pertayning to the Perfect Arte of Navigation'', London (1577), p. 63; see Frances A. Yates, "Queen Elizabeth as Astraea", ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', Vol. 10 (1947), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; This appears to be the first use of a recognisable version of the modern term.

Elizabeth was succeeded by her cousin, King [[James VI of Scotland]], who brought the English throne under his personal rule as King James I of Englandâproclaiming himself as "King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Francois Velde |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/britstyles.htm#1604 |title=Proclamation styling James I King of Great Britain on 20 October 1604 |website=Heraldica.org |date= |accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the states remained separate until the monarchy was overthrown in the [[the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|civil wars of the Three Kingdoms]]; the [[Commonwealth of England]] briefly ruled all, before the [[English Restoration|restoration of the monarchy]] restored separate states.

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' asserts that the first published use in English of "British Isles" was in 1621 (before the civil wars) by [[Peter Heylin]] (or Heylyn) in his ''Microcosmus: a little description of the great world''&lt;ref&gt;Peter Heylyn, ''Oxford English Dictionary'', second edn. Online Version (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; (a collection of his lectures on historical geography). Writing from his English political perspective, he grouped Ireland with Great Britain and the minor islands with these three arguments:&lt;ref&gt;Peter Heylyn, ''Microcosmus'', p. 502 (1621).&lt;/ref&gt;
*The inhabitants of Ireland must have come from Britain as it was the nearest land
*He notes that ancient writers (such as Ptolemy) called Ireland a ''BrttiÊh Iland''
*He cites the observation of the first-century Roman writer [[Tacitus]] that the habits and disposition of the people in Ireland were not much unlike the ''Brittaines''&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus himself had treated Ireland and Britain separately and had also seen similarities between the Britons and the Gauls of the continent. Tacitus: ''Germania and Agricola''; Chpt 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholarly opinion&lt;ref name=MayhewGRev /&gt;&lt;ref name=MayhewBJHS /&gt; is that Heylyn "politicised his geographical books Microcosmus ... and, still more, Cosmographie" in the context of what geography meant at that time. Heylyn's geographical work must be seen as political expressions concerned with proving (or disproving) constitutional matters, and "demonstrated their authors' specific political identities by the languages and arguments they deployed." In an era when "politics referred to discussions of dynastic legitimacy, of representation, and of the Constitution ... [Heylyn's] geography was not to be conceived separately from politics."

&lt;!--this assertion isn't supported by the "British Isles Old Maps" lists of links ... Although other mapmakers (for example the Schagen Map&lt;ref&gt; Schagen Map, late seventeenth century from the University of Amsterdam&lt;ref&gt;http://dpc2.uba.uva.nl/cgi/i/image/image-idx?sid=e55c1998f2bd0e1775d344dab7b7c2ce;med=1;q1=carto;rgn1=carto_all;size=20;c=carto;lasttype=boolean;view=entry;lastview=thumbnail;subview=detail;cc=carto;entryid=x-411329928;viewid=1806A19-11.TIF;start=61;resnum=73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) continued to use terms like "{{lang|la|Angliae, Scotiae et Hiberniae}}", the precedent set by Mercator and Ortelius (who were probably the most influential mapmakers of the period), and the ongoing changes in the political situation in Great Britain and Ireland during the seventeenth century, meant that the term was very commonly used in maps by the late seventeenth century{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and quickly became near universal.--&gt;
Following the [[Act of Union (1707)|Acts of Union of 1707]] the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and conflict with France brought a new popular enthusiasm for Britishness (mostly in Britain itself),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Snyder| 2003|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term ''British Isles'' came into common use despite the persistent stirrings of [[Irish nationalism]]. A desire for some form of Irish independence had been active throughout the centuries, with [[Poynings' Law]] a common focus of resentment. After the hugely turbulent 16th and 17th centuries, nationalism surfaced among the Irish Protestant population and eventually led to the legislative independence of the Irish Parliament under [[Henry Grattan]]âfollowed after the Act of Union (1800) by the renewed assertiveness of Irish Catholics, who first agitated for [[Catholic Emancipation]] and later for Repeal of the Union under [[Daniel O'Connell]].

The [[Great Irish Famine]], the [[Land War]] and the failure of [[William Ewart Gladstone]] and [[Charles Stuart Parnell]] to get partial independence (a [[Irish Home Rule Bill|Bill for Home Rule]]) through the [[British House of Commons|Westminister Parliament]] led to the secession of most of Ireland from the United Kingdom. This meant the end of British rule in most of Ireland.

'''Cape Dezhnyov''' or '''Cape Dezhnev''' ({{Lang-ru|Ð¼ÑÑ ÐÐµÐ¶Ð½ÑÐ²Ð°}}; formerly East Cape or Cape Vostochny) is a [[Cape (geography)|cape]] that forms the eastmost mainland point of [[Asia]]. It is located on the [[Chukchi Peninsula]] in the very sparsely populated [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]] of [[Russia]]. This cape is located between the [[Chukchi Sea]] and the [[Bering Strait]], {{convert|82|km}} across from [[Cape Prince of Wales]] in [[Alaska]]; the [[Bering Strait]] is delimited by the two capes. The [[Diomede Islands]] and [[Fairway Rock]] are located in the midst of the strait.

==Geography==
In 1898, the cape was officially renamed as Cape Dezhnev, replacing Captain [[James Cook]]'s name, the "East Cape". It was named in honor of [[Semyon Dezhnev]], the first recorded European to round its tip (in 1648). There is a large monument to Dezhnev on the [[seacoast]].

The cape is the eastern tip of a high, rocky headland, about {{convert|20|km|mi}} from [[Uelen]] in the north to Cape Pe'ek in the south, connected to the mainland by a neck of lower-lying land peppered with swamps and shallow lakes. That low-lying land is so low in elevation that the cape appears as an island from a distance far to the south of it. The US Hydrographic Office publication ''Asiatic Pilot'' from 1909 gives the height of the headland as {{convert|2521|ft|m}}, and the US Office of Coast Survey chart of 2000 shows the highest peak at {{convert|2638|ft|m}}. The [[headland]] and the neck of low-lying land together form a [[peninsula]].  A well-established trail crossed the neck of land behind the headland in pre-historic and historic times, traversed by sleds in the winter and used as a portage in the summer to avoid traversing the strait.  This route was important enough that, according to an analysis by linguist [[Michael E. Krauss|Michael Krauss]], the [[Central Siberian Yupik language]] continued up the coast, un-interrupted by the [[Naukan Yupik language|Naukansky]] dialect spoken in [[Naukan (village)|Naukan]] village on the headland.

The [[Great Circle]] distance from Cape Dezhnev to the shore of the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] strait in [[Yemen]] is about 10,855&amp;nbsp;km, which is the longest land distance of  [[Asia]].

==History==
[[File:Cape Dezhnev USCGS 1937.PNG|left|thumb|275px|Detail of a USCGS chart from 1937 showing Cape Dezhnev (East Cape) with the historical villages Tunkan, Uelen (Ugelen), Naukan (Nuokan), Enmitahin, and Dezhnevo (Port Dezhnev) marked. The shape of the cape is somewhat distorted in this map.
]]
The Cape Dezhnev peninsula, (or East Cape, as it was then generally called) was a center for trade between American (and other) whalers and the fur traders and the native Yupik and Chukchi people of the coast in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the early years, ships would call at Uelen to trade for furs produced along the arctic coast. Subsequently, there were established trading stations at Uelen and Deshnevo (Chukchi name Keniskun; Yupik Kaniskak). When a source of that period speaks of stopping or trading at East Cape, either of these locations may be meant, or occasionally the Yupik village Naukan on the southeast shore of the cape, which had less trade because it lacked a good anchorage.  Sources from that period sometimes speak of a village Emma-Town. Although this name may be derived from the nearby Yupik village Enmitahin (Chukchi for "end of the cliff") the name appears to refer to Keniskun (where the traders were) or perhaps to both villages together. Of the four historical villages on the cape itself, only Uelen is still inhabited. Naukan was evacuated in 1958 with most of the occupants relocated to Nunyamo near [[Saint Lawrence Bay, Chukotka]], and Keniskun was merged with Uelen a little earlier.

In Josef Bauer's ''[[As Far as My Feet Will Carry Me]]'' (1955), Cape Deshnev is given as the site of a Gulag lead-mine camp from which a German POW Clemens Forell (actual name: [[Cornelius Rost]]) escaped in 1949. Later research cast serious doubt on the book's accuracy. For example,  at the time of the escape described, no Cape Dezhnev Gulag camp lead mine existed.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.br-online.de/bayern2/zeit-fuer-bayern/zeit-fuer-bayern-weltkrieg-arthur-dittlmann-ID1265799135833.xml |title=As far as your feet will cary you - A global hit - Fiction and Truth (A four-tape-interview as the basis for the novel) |author= |date=2010-03-23 |work= |publisher=[[Bayerischer Rundfunk]] (Bavarian Broadcasting Company) |accessdate=23 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020072411/http://www.br-online.de/bayern2/zeit-fuer-bayern/zeit-fuer-bayern-weltkrieg-arthur-dittlmann-ID1265799135833.xml |archivedate=October 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ElChotaValley.jpg|290px|thumb|left|Descent into the Chota Valley by bus, coming from Carchi Province]]

The upper valley of the [[Mira River (Ecuador and Colombia)|Mira River]], called the Chota River in its upstream portion, in northern [[Ecuador]], and the small villages in it are usually referred to as 'El Chota', and it runs east-west between the two ranges of the Andes. It lies in the provinces of [[Imbabura Province|Imbabura]], [[Carchi Province|Carchi]] and (to the west) [[Esmeraldas Province|Esmeraldas]]. The river and its upper valley are situated about halfway between the [[equator]] and the [[Colombia]]n border. Accessed off Route 35, the nearest major city is [[Quito]], but Ibarra is the major market centre just south of the valley. It is reputed to be where the best soccer players in the country tend to be from.

In the only village actually named Chota, Spanish-speaking black [[Creole peoples|Creole]] villagers live here but there are eleven other Afro-Ecuadorean villages with more than 100 inhabitants in the upper Chota; the Quechua-speaking farmers live higher up in the [[Andes]] mountains. Located beside the Chota River, the Chotans live from growing sugar cane, making aguardiente (brandy) and a range of other crops and raise pigs and goats. The valley bottom lies at around 1700 metres but the highway to the north and south rises quickly to over 3000 metres high.

The Chota valley people are of African descent. Most were brought here as slaves during the colonial period, particularly when many of the great sugar estates were owned and organised by the Jesuits. Esmeraldas, to the west, is the main African descendant area in the country. These people are supposedly descendants of slaves escaping from wrecked slave ships, just as is the African descendant population of the Choco in Colombia. Similar African descendant populations,  occur in the hot valley south of Cuenca in southern Ecuador and, to the north in Colombia, in the PatÃ­a valley.

The climate in the upper Chota valley can be hot or cool, but is consistently dusty. The valley bottom is dry (around 1000 mm.annually) and temperatures range between 16 and 29 degrees Celsius. As the valley descends towards the coast is passes through cloud forest and is more humid. Annual flooding and landslides are a dangerous problem in the rainy season.  Homes are simple and most are one room only. They are made of [[cinder block]]s or grass and reeds.

The '''cottage garden''' is a distinct style that uses informal design, traditional materials, dense plantings, and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants. English in origin, it depends on grace and charm rather than grandeur and formal structure. Homely and functional [[garden]]s connected to working-class cottages go back centuries, but their stylized reinvention occurred  in 1870s England, as a reaction to the more structured, rigorously maintained estate gardens with their formal designs and mass plantings of greenhouse annuals.

The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than today's, with emphasis on vegetables and herbs, fruit trees, perhaps a beehive, and even livestock. Flowers, used to fill spaces, gradually became more dominant. The traditional cottage garden was usually enclosed, perhaps with a rose-bowered gateway. Flowers common to early cottage gardens included traditional florists' flowers such as [[Primula vulgaris|primroses]] and [[violet (plant)|violet]]s, along with flowers with household use such as [[calendula]] and various [[herb]]s. Others were the richly scented old-fashioned [[rose]]s that bloomed once a year, and simple flowers like [[Bellis perennis|daisies]]. In time, cottage-garden sections were added to some large estate gardens as well.

Modern cottage gardens include countless regional and personal variations and embrace plant materials, such as ornamental grasses or [[native plant]]s not seen in the rural gardens of cottagers. Traditional roses, with their full fragrance and lush foliage, continue to be a cottage-garden mainstayâalong with modern disease-resistant varieties that retain traditional attributes. Informal climbing plants, whether traditional or modern hybrids, are also common, as are the self-sowing annuals and freely spreading perennials favoured in traditional cottagers' gardens.

==History==
===Origins===
[[File:Ampthill thatched cottages.jpg|thumb|left|Vernacular thatched cottages (built in 1812â1816) in Woburn Street, [[Ampthill]], Bedfordshire, surrounded by garden.]]
Cottage gardens, which emerged in Elizabethan times, appear to have originated as a local source for herbs and fruits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryrie|first=Charlie|title=The Cottage Garden: How to Plan and Plant a Garden That Grows Itself|publisher=[[Collins &amp; Brown]]|year=2004|page=7|isbn=1-84340-216-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VfO_WIAx0wC&amp;pg=PA7}}&lt;/ref&gt; One theory is that they arose out of the [[Black Death]] of the 1340s, when the death of so many laborers made land available for small cottages with personal gardens.&lt;ref name="Scott-James80"/&gt; According to the late 19th-century legend of origin,&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Scott-James]], ''The Cottage Garden'' (London: Lane) 1981, de-mythologised the origins of the English cottage garden, and its treasured [[topiary]] among the vegetables and flowers, popularly supposed to represent heirlooms from the seventeenth century.&lt;/ref&gt; these gardens were originally created by the workers that lived in the cottages of the villages, to provide them with food and herbs, with flowers planted in for decoration. [[Helen Leach]] analysed the historical origins of the romanticised cottage garden, subjecting the garden style to rigorous historical analysis, along with the ornamental [[potager]] and the [[herb garden]]. She concluded that their origins were less in workingmen's gardens in the 19th century and more in the leisured classes' discovery of simple hardy plants, in part through the writings of [[John Claudius Loudon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=Helen|title=Cultivating Myths: Fiction, Fact and Fashion in Garden History|publisher=Auckland: [[Godwit (publisher)|Godwit]]|year=2000|isbn=1-86962-049-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loudon helped to design the estate at [[Great Tew]], [[Oxfordshire]], where farm workers were provided with cottages that had architectural quality set in a smallholding or large gardenâabout an acreâwhere they could grow food and keep pigs and chickens.&lt;ref&gt;''A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600â1840'', Howard Colvin, [[Yale University Press]], 2008
{{ISBN|0-300-12508-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CSyaO-MqYoAC&amp;pg=PA659&amp;dq=Loudon+Great+Tew&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=KCqUSencMIfCzgSt_pT0CQ&amp;client=firefox-a p 659]&lt;/ref&gt;

Authentic gardens of the [[Yeoman|yeoman cottager]] would have included a beehive and livestock, and frequently a pig and sty, along with a well. The peasant cottager of medieval times was more interested in meat than flowers, with herbs grown for medicinal use and cooking, rather than for their beauty.&lt;ref name="Scott-James80"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott-James|first=Anne|author2=Osbert Lancaster|title=The Pleasure Garden: An Illustrated History of British Gardening|publisher=[[Frances Lincoln Publishers]]|year=2004|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IbhwIo3m3mQC&amp;pg=PA80|isbn=978-0-7112-2360-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; By Elizabethan times there was more prosperity, and thus more room to grow flowers. Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical useâviolets were spread on the floor (for their pleasant scent and keeping out vermin); [[calendula]]s and [[primula vulgaris|primroses]] were both attractive and used in cooking. Others, such as [[sweet william]] and [[hollyhock]]s were grown entirely for their beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lloyd|first=Christopher|author2=Richard Bird|others=Jacqui Hurst|title=The Cottage Garden|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=1999|pages=6â9|isbn=978-0-7513-0702-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
The "naturalness" of informal design began to be noticed and developed by the British leisured class. [[Alexander Pope]] was an early proponent of less formal gardens, calling in a 1713 article for gardens with the "amiable simplicity of unadorned nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Myra|title=The Treatment of Nature in English Poetry Between Pope and Wordsworth|publisher=[[The University of Chicago Press]]|year=1896|page=253|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JAE7uOjMdDYC&amp;pg=PA253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers in the 18th century who encouraged less formal, and more natural, gardens included [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Lord Shaftesbury]]. The evolution of cottage gardens can be followed in the issues of ''The Cottage Gardener'' (1848â61), edited by [[George William Johnson (writer)|George William Johnson]], where the emphasis is squarely on the "florist's flowers", [[Dianthus caryophyllus|carnation]]s and [[Primula auricula|auricula]]s in fancy varieties that were originally cultivated as a highly competitive blue-collar hobby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gould|first=Jim|date=Spring 1988|title=The Lichfield Florists|journal=Garden History|volume=16|issue=1|pages=17â23|doi=10.2307/1586902|jstor=1586902|publisher=Garden History, Vol. 16, No. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jekyll Manor House Border.jpg|thumb|Restored [[Gertrude Jekyll]] border at Manor House, Upton Grey, Hampshire]]
[[William Robinson (gardener)|William Robinson]] and [[Gertrude Jekyll]] helped to popularise less formal gardens in their many books and magazine articles. Robinson's ''The Wild Garden'', published in 1870, contained in the first edition an essay on "The Garden of British Wild Flowers", which was eliminated from later editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Massingham|first=Betty|title=William Robinson: A Portrait|journal=Garden History|publisher=The Garden History Society|volume= 6 | issue = 1|pages=61â85|doi=10.2307/1586557|jstor=1586557|year=1978}} p. 63f.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''The English Flower Garden'', illustrated with cottage gardens from Somerset, Kent and Surrey, he remarked, "One lesson of these little gardens, that are so pretty, is that one can get good effects from simple materials."&lt;ref&gt;Massingham, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1890s his lifelong friend Jekyll applied cottage garden principles to more structured designs in even quite large country houses. Her ''Colour in the Flower Garden'' (1908) is still in print today.

Robinson and Jekyll were part of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], a broader movement in art, architecture, and crafts during the late 19th century which advocated a return to the informal planting style derived as much from the Romantic tradition as from the actual English cottage garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kendle|first=Tony|author2=Stephen Forbes|title=Urban Nature Conservation: Landscape Management in the Urban Countryside|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|year=1997|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KskkCkr6t2MC&amp;pg=PA79|isbn=978-0-419-19300-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arts and Crafts Exhibition of 1888 began a movement toward an idealised natural country garden style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Horwood|first=Catherine|title=Potted History: The Story of Plants in the Home|publisher=Frances Lincoln Publishers|year=2008|page=151|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6ceoBeBo2AC&amp;pg=PA151|isbn=978-0-7112-2800-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The garden designs of Robinson and Jekyll were often associated with Arts and Crafts style houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kammen|first=Carol|author2=Norma Prendergast|title=Encyclopedia of Local History|publisher=Rowman Altamira|year=2000|page=205|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nf_M9vqUMLYC&amp;pg=PA205|isbn=978-0-7425-0399-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both were influenced by [[William Morris]], one of the leaders of the Arts and Crafts MovementâRobinson quoted Morris's views condemning [[carpet bedding]]; Jekyll shared Morris's mystical view of nature and drew on the floral designs in his textiles for her gardening style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Jill |author2=Penny Hart |author3=John Simmons |title=The Gardens of William Morris|publisher=Frances Lincoln Publishers|year=1998|page=87|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GlpJYel38hkC&amp;pg=PA87|isbn=978-0-7112-1370-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Morris built his Red House in Kent, it influenced new ideas in architecture and gardeningâthe "old-fashioned" garden suddenly became a fashion accessory among the British artistic middle class, and the cottage garden esthetic began to emigrate to America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clayton|first=Virginia Tuttle|title=The Once and Future Gardener: Garden Writing from the Golden Age of Magazines, 1900â1940|publisher=David R.

[[File:The Clothes Basket.jpg|thumb|left|[[Helen Allingham]] [[watercolor]] showing elite [[peony|peonies]] and modern [[delphinium]]s in an idealised cottage garden, 1909]]
In the early 20th century the term "cottage garden" might be applied even to as large and sophisticated a garden as [[Hidcote Manor]], which [[Vita Sackville-West]] described as "a cottage garden on the most glorified scale"&lt;ref name="Vita"&gt;Vita Sackville-West, "Hidcote Manor", ''Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society'' '''74''' (1949:476-81), as noted by Brent Elliott in "Historical Revivalism in the Twentieth Century: A Brief Introduction" ''Garden History'' '''28'''.1, Reviewing the Twentieth-Century Landscape (Summer 2000:17â31)&lt;/ref&gt; but where the colour harmonies were carefully contrived and controlled, as in the famous "Red Borders". Sackville-West had taken similar models for her own "cottage garden", one of many "garden rooms" at [[Sissinghurst Castle Garden|Sissinghurst Castle]]âher idea of a cottage garden was a place where "the plants grow in a jumble, flowering shrubs mingled with Roses,&lt;!--Roses in original--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The "old roses" Vita Sackville-West was rediscovering were introduced from French growers in the 1830s and 1840s. See [[Graham Stuart Thomas]], ''The Old Shrub Roses''.&lt;/ref&gt; herbaceous plants with bulbous subjects, climbers scrambling over hedges, seedlings coming up wherever they have chosen to sow themselves".&lt;ref name="Vita"/&gt; The cottage garden ideal was also spread by artists such as water-colourist [[Helen Allingham]] (1848â1926).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=John Dixon|author2=Joachim Wolschke-Bulmahn|title=The Vernacular Garden: Dumbarton Oaks Colloquium on the History of Landscape Architecture XIV|publisher=[[Dumbarton Oaks]]|year=1993|isbn=978-0-88402-201-5|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YVLU-_6KcSoC&amp;pg=PA9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another influence was [[Margery Fish]] (1892â1969), whose garden survives at [[East Lambrook Manor]].&lt;ref name="ODNB_entry"&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/48830 ODNB entry for Margery Fish by Catherine Horwood] Retrieved 1 December 2012. (Pay-walled)&lt;/ref&gt;

The cottage garden in France is a development of the early 20th century. [[Monet]]'s garden at [[Giverny]] is a prominent example, a sprawling garden full of varied plantings, rich colors, and water gardens. In modern times, the term 'cottage garden' is used to describe any number of informal garden styles, using design and plants very different from their traditional English cottage garden origins. Examples include regional variations using a grass prairie scheme (in the American midwest) and California chaparral cottage gardens.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Lee Anne|title=Exploring Garden Style: Creative Ideas from America's Best Gardeners|publisher=Taunton Press|year=2001|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qSBJIpzex5kC&amp;pg=PA95|isbn=978-1-56158-474-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
While the classic cottage garden is built around a [[cottage]], many cottage-style gardens are created around houses and even estates such as [[Hidcote Manor]], with its more intimate "garden rooms".&lt;ref&gt;

In spite of their appearances, cottage gardens have a design and formality that help give them their grace and charm. Due to space limitations, they are often in small rectangular plots, with practical functioning paths and hedges or fences. The plants, layout, and materials are chosen to give the impression of casualness and a country feel.&lt;ref name="RHS"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Robin|title=The Garden Designer|editor=Royal Horticultural Society|publisher=Frances Lincoln Publishers|year=1995|page=190|isbn=978-0-7112-0812-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkNrAeE5p7sC&amp;pg=PA190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern cottage gardens frequently use local flowers and materials, rather than those of the traditional cottage garden. What they share with the tradition is the unstudied look, the use of every square inch, and a rich variety of flowers, herbs, and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Lee Anne|title=Exploring Garden Style: Creative Ideas from America's Best Gardeners|publisher=Taunton Press|year=2001|pages=89â93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qSBJIpzex5kC&amp;pg=PA89|isbn=978-1-56158-474-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cottage garden is designed to appear artless, rather than contrived or pretentious. Instead of artistic curves, or grand geometry, there is an artfully designed irregularity. Borders can go right up to the house, lawns are replaced with tufts of grass or flowers, and beds can be as wide as needed. Instead of the discipline of large scale color schemes, there is the simplicity of harmonious color combinations between neighbouring plants. The overall appearance can be of "a vegetable garden that has been taken over by flowers."&lt;ref name="Turner"/&gt; The method of planting closely packed plants was supposed to reduce the amount of weeding and watering required, but planted stone pathways or turf paths, and clipped hedges overgrown with wayward vines, are cottage garden features requiring well-timed maintenance.

===Materials===
Paths, arbors, and fences use traditional or antique looking materials. Wooden fences and gates, paths covered with locally made bricks or stone, and arbors using natural materials all give a more casualâand less formalâlook and feel to a cottage garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lloyd|first=Christopher|author2=Richard Bird|others=Jacqui Hurst|title=The Cottage Garden|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|year=1999|page=6|isbn=978-0-7513-0702-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pots, ornaments, and furniture also use natural looking materials with traditional finishesâeverything is chosen to give the impression of an old-fashioned country garden.&lt;ref name="RHS"/&gt;

==Plants==
===Overview===
Until the late 19th century, cottage gardens mainly grew vegetables for household consumption. Typically half the garden would be used for cultivating [[potato]]es and half for a mix of other vegetables. [[John Claudius Loudon]] wrote extensively on cottage gardens in his book ''An EncyclopÃ¦dia of Gardening'' (1822) and in ''Gardener's Magazine'' from 1826. In 1838 he wrote "I seldom observe any thing in a cottage garden but potatoes, cabbages, beans, and French beans; in a few instances onions and [[parsneps]], and very seldom a few peas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Directive Hints for the effective Cultivation of Cottage Gardens|journal=Gardener's Magazine|page=648|year=1832|issue=December|publisher=J.C. LOUDON}}&lt;/ref&gt; An 1865 issue of ''The Farmer's Magazine'' noted that in "[[Ireland]] and much of the [[Highlands of Scotland]], potatoes are the only thing grown in the cottage-garden".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cottage Cookery|journal=The Farmer's Magazine|year=1865|volume=27|page=145|publisher=Rogerson and Tuxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern cottage garden plants are typically flowers chosen for their old-fashioned and informal appeal. Many modern day gardeners use [[heirloom gardening|heirloom]] or 'old-fashioned' plants and varietiesâeven though these may not have been authentic or traditional cottage garden plants.&lt;ref name="Scott-James37"/&gt; In addition, there are modern varieties of flowers that fit into the cottage garden look. For example, modern roses developed by [[David C.H. Austin|David Austin]] have been chosen for cottage gardens because of their old-fashioned look (multi-petaled form and rosette-shaped flowers) and fragranceâcombined with modern virtues of hardiness, repeat blooming, and disease-resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee Anne White|first=Lee Anne White|title=Exploring Garden Style|publisher=Taunton Press|year=2001|page=106|isbn=978-1-56158-474-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qSBJIpzex5kC&amp;pg=PA106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern cottage gardens often use native plants and those adapted to the local climate, rather than trying to force traditional English plants to grow in an incompatible environmentâthough many of the old favorites thrive in cottage gardens throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Lee Anne|title=Exploring Garden Style: Creative Ideas from America's Best Gardeners|publisher=Taunton Press|year=2001|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qSBJIpzex5kC&amp;pg=PA92|isbn=978-1-56158-474-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roses===
[[File:Rosa 'Climbing Souvenir de la Malmaison'.JPG|thumb|left|A climbing sport of the elite [[Rosa 'Souvenir de la Malmaison'|'Souvenir de la Malmaison']], introduced before 1893, typical of a modern cottage garden.]]

Cottage gardens are always associated with roses: shrub roses, climbing roses, and old garden roses with lush foliage, in contrast to the gangly modern hybrid tea roses. Old cottage garden roses include cultivated forms of ''[[Rosa gallica]]'', which form dense mounded shrubs 3â4&amp;nbsp;ft high and wide, with pale pink to purple flowersâwith single form to full double form blooms. They are also very fragrant, and include the ancient Apothecary's rose (''R. gallica'' 'Officinalis'), whose magenta flowers were preserved solely for their fragrance. Another old fragrant cottage garden rose is the [[Damask rose]], which is still grown in Europe for use in perfumes. Cultivated forms of this grow 4 to 6&amp;nbsp;ft or higher, with gently arching canes that help give an informal look to a garden. Even taller generally are the Alba roses, which are not always white, and which bloom well even in partial shade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schulman|first=Andrew|author2=Jacqueline Koch|title=The Northwest Cottage Garden|publisher=Sasquatch Books|year=2004|pages=131â132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KCFdx1bzf_YC&amp;pg=PA131|isbn=978-1-57061-363-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Provence rose]] or ''Rosa centifolia'' is the full and fat "cabbage rose" made famous by Dutch masters in their 17th-century paintings. These very fragrant shrub roses grow 5&amp;nbsp;ft tall and wide, with a floppy habit that is aided by training on an arch or pillar. The centifolia roses have produced many descendants that are also cottage garden favorites, including varieties of moss rose (roses with attractive 'mossy' growth on their flower stalks and flower buds). Unlike most modern hybrids, the older roses bloom on the previous year's wood, so they aren't pruned back severely each year. Also as they don't bloom continuously, they can share their branches with later-flowering climbers such as [[Clematis]] vines, which use the rose branches for support. A rose in the cottage garden is not segregated with other roses, with bare earth or mulch underneath', but is casually blended with other flowers, vines, and groundcover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schulman|first=Andrew|author2=Jacqueline Koch|title=The Northwest Cottage Garden|publisher=Sasquatch Books|year=2004|pages=132â133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KCFdx1bzf_YC&amp;pg=PA132|isbn=978-1-57061-363-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the introduction of China roses (derived from ''[[Rosa chinensis]]'') late in the 18th century, many hybrids were introduced that had the [[Remontancy|remontant]] (repeat-blooming) nature of the China roses, but maintained the informal old rose shape and flower. These included the [[Rose#Bourbon|Bourbon rose]] and the [[Rose#Noisette|Noisette rose]], which were added to the rose repertoire of the cottage garden, and, more recently, hybrid "English" roses introduced by [[David C.H. Austin|David Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schulman|first=Andrew|author2=Jacqueline Koch|title=The Northwest Cottage Garden|publisher=Sasquatch Books|year=2004|pages=134â138|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KCFdx1bzf_YC&amp;pg=PA134|isbn=978-1-57061-363-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climbing plants===
[[File:Clematis vitalba.JPG|thumb|''[[Clematis vitalba]]'']]
Many of the old roses had cultivars that grew very long canes, which could be tied to trellises or against walls. These older varieties are called "ramblers", rather than "climbers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beutler|first=Linda|title=Gardening with Clematis|publisher=Timber Press|year=2004|page=88|isbn=978-0-88192-644-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZutMXEKLhoC&amp;pg=PA88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climbing plants in the traditional cottage garden included [[European honeysuckle]] (''Lonicera periclymenum'') and [[Clematis vitalba|Traveller's Joy]] (''Clematis vitalba''). The modern cottage garden includes many [[Clematis]] hybrids that have the old appeal, with sparse foliage that allows them to grow through roses and trees, and along fences and arbors.&lt;ref name="Philips18"&gt;{{cite book|last=Philips|first=Sue|title=Cottage Garden Flowers|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company|year=2003|page=18|isbn=978-1-84403-065-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3yjmCVlPyJQC&amp;pg=PA18}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many Clematis species used in the modern cottage garden, including ''Clematis armandii'', ''Clematis chrysocoma'', and ''[[Clematis flammula]]''. Popular honeysuckles for cottage gardens include [[Japanese honeysuckle]] and ''Lonicera tragophylla''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Squire|first=David|author2=Alan Bridgewater|others=Gill Bridgewater|title=The Climbing Plants Specialist|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company|year=2006|page=55|isbn=978-1-84537-105-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HK4zaP32tlgC&amp;pg=PA55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hedging plants===
In the traditional cottage garden, hedges served as fences on the perimeter to keep out marauding livestock and for privacy, along with other practical uses. [[Crataegus monogyna|Hawthorn]] leaves made a tasty snack or tea, while the flowers were used for making wine. The fast-growing [[Elderberry]], in addition to creating a hedge, provided berries for food and wine, with the flowers being fried in batter or made into lotions and ointments. The wood had many uses, including toys, pegs, skewers, and fishing poles. [[Holly]] was another hedge plant, useful because it quickly spread and self-seeded. [[Privet]] was also a convenient and fast-growing hedge. Over time, more ornamental and less utilitarian plants became popular cottage garden hedges, including [[Laurel family|laurel]], [[lilac]], [[snowberry]], [[Chaenomeles|japonica]], and others.&lt;ref name="Porter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Porter|first=Valerie|title=Yesterday's Countryside|publisher=David &amp; Charles|year=2006|pages=47â48|isbn=978-0-7153-2196-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5IF-VCcxGY0C&amp;pg=PA48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flowers and herbs===
[[File:Single lavendar flower02.jpg|thumb|left|Lavender]]
Popular flowers in the traditional cottage garden included florist's flowers which were grown by enthusiastsâsuch as violets, pinks, and primroses&lt;ref name="Philips18"/&gt;âand those grown with a more practical purpose. For example, the [[Calendula officinalis|calendula]], grown today almost entirely for its bright orange flowers, was primarily valued for eating, for adding color to butter and cheese, for adding smoothness to soups and stews, and for all kinds of healing salves and preparations. Like many old cottage garden [[Annual plant|annual]]s and herbs, it freely self-sowed, making it easier to grow and share.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Jo Ann|author2=Holly S. Dougherty|title=Herbs in Bloom|publisher=Timber Press|page=109|year=2005|isbn=978-0-88192-698-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idS5JjtHCKAC&amp;pg=PA109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular cottage garden annuals included [[Viola (plant)|violets]], [[pansy|pansies]], [[Matthiola|stocks]], and [[Mignonette (Reseda)|mignonette]].&lt;ref name="Scott-James37"&gt;Scott-James, ''The Pleasure Garden'', p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Perennial plant|Perennial]]s were the largest group of traditional cottage garden flowers&lt;ref name="Philips18"/&gt;âthose with a long cottage garden history include [[hollyhocks]], [[carnations]], [[sweet william]]s, [[Leucanthemum vulgare|marguerites]], [[Calendula|marigolds]], [[Lilium|lilies]], [[peony|peonies]], [[tulip]]s, [[crocus]], [[Bellis perennis|daisies]], [[foxglove]], [[monkshood]], [[lavender]], [[campanulas]], [[Polygonatum|Solomon's seal]], [[Oenothera|evening primrose]], [[lily-of-the-valley]], [[Primulaceae|primrose]], [[Primula veris|cowslips]], and many varieties of [[rose]]s.&lt;ref name="Scott-James37"/&gt; 

Today herbs are typically thought of as culinary plants, but in the traditional cottage garden they were considered to be any plant with household uses. Herbs were used for medicine, toiletries, and cleaning products. Scented herbs would be spread on the floor along with rushes to cover odors. Some herbs were used for dyeing fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Philips|first=Sue|title=Cottage Garden Flowers|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company|year=2003|page=17|isbn=978-1-84403-065-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3yjmCVlPyJQC&amp;pg=PA17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional cottage garden herbs included [[Salvia officinalis|sage]], [[thyme]], [[southernwood]], [[Artemisia (genus)|wormwood]], [[catmint]], [[feverfew]], [[lungwort]], [[soapwort]], [[hyssop]], [[sweet woodruff]], and lavender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garland|first=Sarah|title=The Herb Garden|publisher=Frances Lincoln Publishers|year=2003|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ky-WVGIqkWAC&amp;pg=PA52|isbn=978-0-7112-2057-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Jo Ann|author2=Holly S.

===Fruits===
Fruit in the traditional cottage garden would have included an [[apple]] and a [[pear]], for [[cider]] and [[perry]],&lt;ref&gt;The raw fruits, considered indigestible, were not much eaten before the twentieth century.&lt;/ref&gt; gooseberries and raspberries. The modern cottage garden includes many varieties of ornamental fruit and nut trees, such as [[crabapple]] and [[Corylus avellana|hazel]], along with non-traditional trees like [[dogwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Philips|first=Sue|title=Cottage Garden Flowers|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company|year=2003|pages=18â19|isbn=978-1-84403-065-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3yjmCVlPyJQC&amp;pg=PA18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniel Gottlieb Messerschmidt''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|ÐÐ°ÌÐ½Ð¸ÑÐ»Ñ ÐÐ¾ÌÑÐ»Ð¸Ð± ÐÐµÌÑÑÐµÑÑÐ¼Ð¸Ð´Ñ}}) (September 16, 1685 â March 25, 1735) was a German physician, [[natural history|naturalist]] and [[geographer]]. He was born in [[Danzig]] and studied medicine in [[Jena]] and [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], obtained his [[doctorate degree]] in the latter in 1713 and settled as a medical doctor in [[Danzig]]. In 1716, he came into contact with [[Russia]]n emperor [[Peter the Great]]. By decree of November 5, 1718, Peter gave Messerschmidt the task to âcollect rarities and medicinal plantsâ from [[Siberia]]. 

Messerschmidt set out in 1720 on his exploration â the first by a [[natural history|naturalist]] in this ''[[terra incognita]]'', which came to last for seven years. He made numerous observations related to [[ethnology]], [[zoology]] and [[botany]] and also excavated the first known [[fossil]] [[mammoth]] remains. Messerschmidt used two simple utensils for collecting data and artefacts, written diary notes and boxes, establishing a tradition for [[natural history|naturalist]] exploration to last for a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = te Heesen | first = Anke | title = Boxes in Nature | journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 381â403 | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1016/S0039-3681(00)00017-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tobolsk]], Messerschmidt met the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[lieutenant colonel]] [[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]], who had been taken prisoner at the [[Battle of Poltava]] and [[exile]]d to [[Siberia]]. 

Strahlenberg accompanied Messerschmidt during several expeditions and later published some of Messerschmidtâs observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = von Strahlenberg | first = Ph.J. | title = Das Nord- und Ãstliche Theil von Europa und Asia | year = 1730 | location = Stockholm | url = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Messerschmidt explored lands all the way to [[Argun River (Asia)|Argun]] east of [[Lake Baikal]].&lt;ref name="Egerton (2008)"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Egerton | first = Frank N. | title = A History of the Ecological Sciences, Part 27: Naturalists Explore Russia and the North Pacific During the 1700s | journal=Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America | volume = 89 | issue = 1 | pages = 39â60 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1890/0012-9623(2008)89[39:AHOTES]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journey, however, exhausted him, and he returned to [[Saint Petersburg]] in February 1728. He never became a member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]]. He died in [[poverty]] in 1735. 

[[File:Messer0002.jpg|thumb|''Cypripedium macranthon'', described by Messerschmidt]]
Messerschmidtâs notes and collections were, to the degree they were preserved, kept at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. [[Peter Simon Pallas|Pallas]] cited extracts of his journey log in his ''Neue nordischen BeytrÃ¤ge''. Only much later, his full journal and excellent maps were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Messerschmidt | first = D.G. | title = Forschungsreise durch Sibirien 1720â1727, vol. 1â5, edited by E.

'''Environmental economics''' is a sub-field of [[economics]] that is concerned with environmental issues. It has become a widely studied topic due to growing concerns in regards to the environment in the twentyfirst century. Quoting from the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] Environmental Economics program:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... Environmental Economics ... undertakes theoretical or empirical studies of the economic effects of national or local environmental policies around the world ... . Particular issues include the costs and benefits of alternative environmental policies to deal with air pollution, water quality, toxic substances, solid waste, and global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Environmental economics is distinguished from [[ecological economics]] in that ecological economics emphasizes the economy as a subsystem of the ecosystem with its focus upon preserving [[natural capital]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eoearth.org/article/Environmental_and_ecological_economics Lead Author: Robert Nadeau Article Topics: Ecological economics and Environmental economics Last Updated: August 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeroen C.J.M. van den Bergh (2001).

==Topics and concepts==
{{Economics sidebar}}

===Market failure===
Central to environmental economics is the concept of [[market failure]].  Market failure means that markets fail to allocate resources efficiently. As stated by Hanley, Shogren, and White (2007) in their textbook ''Environmental Economics'':&lt;ref&gt;Hanley, N., J. Shogren, and B. White (2007). Environmental Economics in Theory and Practice, Palgrave, London.&lt;/ref&gt; "A market failure occurs when the market does not allocate scarce resources to generate the greatest social welfare. A wedge exists between what a private person does given market prices and what society might want him or her to do to protect the environment.  Such a wedge implies wastefulness or economic inefficiency; resources can be reallocated to make at least one person better off without making anyone else worse off." Common forms of market failure include externalities, non-excludability and [[Rivalry (economics)|non-rivalry]].

===Externality===
An [[externality]] exists when a person makes a choice that affects other people in a way that is not accounted for in the market price. An externality can be positive or negative, but is usually associated with negative externalities in environmental economics. For instance, water seepage in residential buildings happen in upper floor affect the lower floor.&lt;ref&gt;Rita Yi Man Li (2012), The Internalisation Of Environmental Externalities Affecting Dwellings: A Review Of Court Cases In Hong Kong, Economic Affairs, Volume 32, Issue 2, pages 81â87&lt;/ref&gt; Another example concerns how the sale of Amazon timber disregards the amount of carbon dioxide released in the cutting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Environmental degradation replaces classic imperialism|last=Chapman|first=Same|date=May 3, 2012|work=The Whitman College Pioneer: Whitman College|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=July 2018}} Or a firm emitting [[pollution]] will typically not take into account the costs that its pollution imposes on others.  As a result, pollution may occur in excess of the 'socially efficient' level, which is the level that would exist if the market was required to account for the pollution. A classic definition influenced by [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[James Meade]] is provided by Heller and Starrett (1976), who define an externality as "a situation in which the private economy lacks sufficient incentives to create a potential market in some good and the nonexistence of this market results in losses of [[Pareto efficiency]]".&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Walter P. and David A. Starrett (1976), On the Nature of Externalities, in: Lin, Stephen A.Y. (ed.), Theory and Measurement of Economic Externalities, Academic Press, New York, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;  In economic terminology, externalities are examples of [[market failure]]s, in which the unfettered market does not lead to an efficient outcome.

===Common goods and public goods===
When it is too costly to exclude some people from access to an environmental resource, the resource is either called a [[common-pool resource|common property resource]] (when there is rivalry for the resource, such that one person's use of the resource reduces others' opportunity to use the resource) or a [[public good]] (when use of the resource is [[rivalry (economics)|non-rivalrous]]). In either case of non-exclusion, market allocation is likely to be inefficient.

These challenges have long been recognized. [[Garrett Hardin|Hardin]]'s (1968) concept of the [[tragedy of the commons]] popularized the challenges involved in non-exclusion and common property. "Commons" refers to the environmental asset itself, "common property resource" or "common pool resource" refers to a property right regime that allows for some collective body to devise schemes to exclude others, thereby allowing the capture of future benefit streams; and "open-access" implies no ownership in the sense that property everyone owns nobody owns.&lt;ref name="Ostrom, E 1990"&gt;Ostrom, E. 1990. Governing the Commons. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic problem is that if people ignore the scarcity value of the commons, they can end up expending too much effort, [[over harvesting]] a resource (e.g., a fishery). Hardin theorizes that in the absence of restrictions, users of an open-access resource will use it more than if they had to pay for it and had exclusive rights, leading to [[environmental degradation]].  See, however, [[Elinor Ostrom|Ostrom]]'s (1990) work on how people using real common property resources have worked to establish self-governing rules to reduce the risk of the tragedy of the commons.&lt;ref name="Ostrom, E 1990"/&gt;

The [[mitigation of climate change]] effects is an example of a public good, where the social benefits are not reflected completely in the market price. This is a public good since the risks of climate change are both non-rival and non-excludable.  Such efforts are non-rival since climate mitigation provided to one does not reduce the level of mitigation that anyone else enjoys.  They are non-excludable actions as they will have global consequences from which no one can be excluded. A country's incentive to invest in carbon abatement is reduced because it can "[[Free rider problem|free ride]]" off the efforts of other countries. Over a century ago, Swedish economist [[Knut Wicksell]] (1896) first discussed how public goods can be under-provided by the market because people might conceal their preferences for the good, but still enjoy the benefits without paying for them.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Valuation ===
Assessing the economic value of the environment is a major topic within the field. Use and indirect use are tangible benefits accruing from [[natural resource]]s or [[ecosystem services]] (see the [[Ecological economics#Nature|nature section]] of ecological economics). Non-use values include existence, option, and bequest values. For example, some people may value the existence of a diverse set of species, regardless of the effect of the loss of a species on ecosystem services. The existence of these species may have an option value, as there may be the possibility of using it for some human purpose. For example, certain plants may be researched for drugs. Individuals may value the ability to leave a pristine environment to their children.

Use and indirect use values can often be inferred from revealed behavior, such as the cost of taking [[travel cost analysis|recreational trips]] or using [[hedonic model|hedonic methods]] in which values are estimated based on observed prices.  Non-use values are usually estimated using stated preference methods such as [[contingent valuation]] or [[choice modelling]]. Contingent valuation typically takes the form of surveys in which people are asked how much they would pay to observe and recreate in the environment ([[willingness to pay]]) or their willingness to accept (WTA) compensation for the destruction of the environmental good. [[Hedonic pricing]] examines the effect the environment has on economic decisions through housing prices, traveling expenses, and payments to visit parks.&lt;ref&gt;Harris J. (2006). ''Environmental and Natural Resource Economics: A Contemporary Approach''. Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solutions==
Solutions advocated to correct such externalities include:

* '' [[United States Environmental Protection Agency#Related legislation|Environmental regulations]]''. Under this plan, the economic impact has to be estimated by the regulator. Usually this is done using [[cost-benefit analysis]].  There is a growing realization that regulations (also known as "command and control" instruments) are not so distinct from economic instruments as is commonly asserted by proponents of environmental economics.  E.g.1 regulations are enforced by fines, which operate as a form of tax if pollution rises above the threshold prescribed.  E.g.2 pollution must be monitored and laws enforced, whether under a pollution tax regime or a regulatory regime.  The main difference an environmental economist would argue exists between the two methods, however, is the total cost of the regulation.  "Command and control" regulation often applies uniform emissions limits on polluters, even though each firm has different costs for emissions reductions.  Some firms, in this system, can abate inexpensively, while others can only abate at high cost.  Because of this, the total abatement has some expensive and some inexpensive efforts to abate.  Consequently, modern "Command and control" regulations are oftentimes designed in a way, which addresses these issues by incorporating utility parameters. For instance, CO2 emission standards for specific manufacturers in the automotive industry are either linked to the average vehicle footprint (US system) or average vehicle weight (EU system) of their entire vehicle fleet. Environmental economic regulations find the cheapest emission abatement efforts first, then the more expensive methods second.  E.g. as said earlier, trading, in the quota system, means a firm only abates if doing so would cost less than paying someone else to make the same reduction.  This leads to a lower cost for the total abatement effort as a whole.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
* ''[[quota on pollution|Quotas on pollution]]''. Often it is advocated that pollution reductions should be achieved by way of [[tradeable emissions permits]], which if freely traded may ensure that reductions in pollution are achieved at least cost. In theory, if such tradeable quotas are allowed, then a firm would reduce its own pollution load only if doing so would cost less than paying someone else to make the same reduction.  In practice, tradeable permits approaches have had some success, such as the U.S.'s sulphur dioxide trading program or the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, and interest in its application is spreading to other environmental problems.
* ''[[Tax, tariff and trade|Taxes and tariffs on pollution]]''. Increasing the costs of polluting will discourage polluting, and will provide a "dynamic incentive," that is, the disincentive continues to operate even as pollution levels fall.  A pollution tax that reduces pollution to the socially "optimal" level would be set at such a level that pollution occurs only if the benefits to society (for example, in form of greater production) exceeds the costs. Some advocate a major shift from taxation from income and sales taxes to tax on pollution - the so-called "[[green tax shift]]."
* ''Better defined [[property rights]]''. The [[Coase Theorem]] states that assigning property rights will lead to an optimal solution, regardless of who receives them, if [[transaction costs]] are trivial and the number of parties negotiating is limited. For example, if people living near a factory had a right to clean air and water, or the factory had the right to pollute, then either the factory could pay those affected by the pollution or the people could pay the factory not to pollute. Or, citizens could take action themselves as they would if other property rights were violated. The US River Keepers Law of the 1880s was an early example, giving citizens downstream the right to end pollution upstream themselves if government itself did not act (an early example of [[bioregional democracy]]).  Many markets for "pollution rights" have been created in the late twentieth centuryâsee [[emissions trading]]. According to the Coase Theorem, the involved parties will bargain with each other, which results in an efficient solution. However, modern economic theory has shown that the presence of asymmetric information may lead to inefficient bargaining outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Myerson|first=Roger B|last2=Satterthwaite|first2=Mark A|date=1983|title=Efficient mechanisms for bilateral trading|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-0531(83)90048-0|journal=Journal of Economic Theory|volume=29|issue=2|pages=265â281|doi=10.1016/0022-0531(83)90048-0|issn=0022-0531|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Rob (1989) has shown that pollution claim settlements will not lead to the socially optimal outcome when the individuals that will be affected by pollution have learned private information about their disutility already before the negotiations take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rob|first=Rafael|date=1989|title=Pollution claim settlements under private information|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-0531(89)90022-7|journal=Journal of Economic Theory|volume=47|issue=2|pages=307â333|doi=10.1016/0022-0531(89)90022-7|issn=0022-0531|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; GoldlÃ¼cke and Schmitz (2018) have shown that inefficiencies may also result if the parties learn their private information only after the negotiations, provided that the feasible transfer payments are bounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=GoldlÃ¼cke|first=Susanne|last2=Schmitz|first2=Patrick W.|date=2018|title=Pollution claim settlements reconsidered: Hidden information and bounded payments|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2018.08.005|journal=European Economic Review|volume=110|pages=211â222|doi=10.1016/j.euroecorev.2018.08.005|issn=0014-2921|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to other fields ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
Environmental economics is related to [[ecological economics]] but there are differences. Most environmental economists have been trained as economists. They apply the tools of economics to address environmental problems, many of which are related to so-called market failuresâcircumstances wherein the "[[invisible hand]]" of economics is unreliable.  Most ecological economists have been trained as ecologists, but have expanded the scope of their work to consider the impacts of humans and their economic activity on ecological systems and services, and vice versa. This field takes as its premise that economics is a strict subfield of [[ecology]].  Ecological economics is sometimes described as taking a more pluralistic approach to [[natural environment|environmental]] problems and focuses more explicitly on long-term environmental sustainability and issues of scale.

Environmental economics is viewed as more pragmatic in a [[price system]]; ecological economics as more idealistic in its attempts not to use [[money]] as a primary arbiter of decisions. These two groups of specialists sometimes have conflicting views which may be traced to the different philosophical underpinnings.

Another context in which [[Externality|externalities]] apply is when [[globalization]] permits one player in a market who is unconcerned with [[biodiversity]] to undercut prices of another who is - creating a [[race to the bottom]] in regulations and conservation. This, in turn, may cause loss of [[natural capital]] with consequent erosion, water purity problems, diseases, desertification, and other outcomes which are not [[Pareto efficiency|efficient]] in an economic sense. This concern is related to the subfield of [[sustainable development]] and its political relation, the [[anti-globalization movement]].

Environmental economics was once distinct from [[resource economics]]. Natural resource economics as a subfield began when the main concern of researchers was the optimal commercial exploitation of natural resource stocks. But resource managers and policy-makers eventually began to pay attention to the broader importance of natural resources (e.g. values of fish and trees beyond just their commercial exploitation). It is now difficult to distinguish "environmental" and "natural resource" economics as separate fields as the two became associated with [[sustainability]].  Many of the more radical [[green economists]] split off to work on an alternate [[political economy]].

Environmental economics was a major influence on the theories of [[natural capitalism]] and [[environmental finance]], which could be said to be two sub-branches of environmental economics concerned with resource conservation in production, and the [[value of biodiversity]] to humans, respectively.  The theory of [[natural capitalism]] (Hawken, Lovins, Lovins) goes further than traditional environmental economics by envisioning a world where natural services are considered on par with [[Capital (economics)|physical capital]].

The more radical [[Green economists]] reject neoclassical economics in favour of a new [[political economy]] beyond [[capitalism]] or [[communism]] that gives a greater emphasis to the interaction of the human economy and the natural environment, acknowledging that "economy is three-fifths of ecology" - Mike Nickerson.

These more radical approaches would imply changes to [[money supply]] and likely also a [[bioregional democracy]] so that political, economic, and ecological "environmental limits" were all aligned, and not subject to the [[arbitrage]] normally possible under [[capitalism]].

An emerging sub-field of environmental economics studies its intersection with [[development economics]]. Dubbed "envirodevonomics" by [[Michael Greenstone]] and B. Kelsey Jack in their paper "Envirodevonomics: A Research Agenda for a Young Field," the sub-field is primarily interested in studying "why environmental quality [is] so poor in developing countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Greenstone |first1=Michael |last2=Jack |first2=B. Kelsey |title=Envirodevonomics: A Research Agenda for an Emerging Field |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=5â42 |doi=10.1257/jel.53.1.5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A strategy for better understanding this correlation between a country's GDP and its environmental quality involves analyzing how many of the central concepts of environmental economics, including market failures, externalities, and willingness to pay, may be complicated by the particular problems facing developing countries, such as political issues, lack of infrastructure, or inadequate financing tools, among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inclusive green growth the pathway to sustainable development.|date=May 2012|publisher=World Bank|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-9552-3|pages=12â13|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTSDNET/Resources/Inclusive_Green_Growth_May_2012.pdf|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59815">The '''[[flags]] of the [[provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] of the [[Philippines]]''' are the [[vexillology|vexillological]] devices used by the various provincial-level [[local government unit]]s (LGUs) in the country.

==Designs==
The most common provincial flag design is a plain field of a single color with the provincial seal placed in the center; of this design the most prevalent field color used is white, followed by shades of yellow, of green and of blue.&lt;ref name=pva&gt;{{cite web |website=Philippine Vexillological Association |accessdate=11 November 2017 |date=25 May 2017 |last=Villapando |first=J.A. |title=Current Provincial Flags of the Philippines - Summary Sheet |url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/716959441781312/permalink/1091081901035729/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these plain flags have additional text above and/or below the seal, usually involving the province name.

Several provincial flags deviate from the default design: some are horizontal or vertical [[triband (flag)|tribands]], usually employing three different colors (i.e., a [[tricolour (flag)|tricolor]]); some also use [[charge (heraldry)|charges]] derived from elements within provincial seals, instead of using the entire provincial seal.&lt;ref name=pva/&gt;

==Usage==
Most of the provincial flags, by virtue of bearing the corporate seal of the [[local government unit|LGU]], are solely intended to represent the provincial government wherever they are displayed, and not meant to be adopted by the public for general use. Such government flags only find usage within provincial government premises (e.g., provincial capitol grounds;  provincial government office spaces such as that of the governor; [[Sangguniang Panlalawigan]] chambers; or provincially-owned sports or recreational facilities) and are most visible to the public during events involving the provincial government. The designs of many of these government flags can be easily changed between administrations, especially when the provincial seal itself is altered (e.g., Ilocos Norte;&lt;ref name=iln/&gt; Marinduque&lt;ref name=mar/&gt;); at times they reflect the personal preferences of the provincial governor in power (e.g., use of the blue flag for Laguna during the term of Emilio Ejercito from 2010 to 2014;&lt;ref name=lag/&gt; use of "[[Oriental Negros]]" in the provincial flag and seal during the term of George Arnaiz from 2004 to 2007&lt;ref name=ner/&gt;). 

The flags of some provinces have provincial board (PB) or [[Sangguniang Panlalawigan]] (SP) resolutions or ordinances specifying their designs and specifications; therefore the modification of these flags will require amending or repealing previous legal enactments made by the provincial legislative body. Some flags with legally specified designs, such as those of [[Flag of Bohol|Bohol]], [[Flag of Bukidnon|Bukidnon]] and [[Flag of Southern Leyte|Southern Leyte]], are allowed to be adopted by the general public as a symbol of civic pride for the province, and thus serve dual purpose as both a government and a civic flag. 

At least two provinces â [[Camarines Norte]]&lt;ref name=can/&gt; and [[South Cotabato]]&lt;ref name=sco/&gt; â maintain two vastly different official flag designs: one for exclusive government use (i.e., a plain white flag with the provincial seal in the center) and another for civic use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3231">'''Fred Kurt Schaefer''' (July 7, 1904 â June 6, 1953) was a [[geography|geographer]]. He is considered as one of the pioneers of [[quantitative revolution]].

{{quote|Kurt Schaefer was a whole man, a conscious member of the human race, a scientist, and an intellectual who remembered his humanist commitment.|[[William Bunge]] 1968&lt;ref&gt;Bunge, William, (1968): Fred K. Schaefer and the Science of Geography; Harvard Papers in Theoretical Geography, Special Papers Series, Paper A&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Life==
Fred K. Schaefer was born in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] in the family of metal worker.&lt;ref&gt;Bunge, William, (1979): Fred K. Schaefer and the Science of Geography; Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Vol. 69, No. 1, Special Issue: Seventy-Five Years of American Geography (Mar., 1979), pp. 128-132&lt;/ref&gt; He was involved in politics as a member of Social Democratic party and after the rise of [[fascism]] he fled from Nazi Germany. He attended the [[University of Berlin]] pursuing both undergraduate and postgraduate studies from 1928 through 1932. As an undergraduate he studied economics, economic geography, and political geography. As a graduate student he studied mathematics and population statistics.&lt;ref&gt;Bunge (1979), page 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the [[United States]] he became an inaugural member of the Department of Geography at [[State University of Iowa|Iowa]].

In 1947 he married Mary Strub, a native of [[Iowa City]]. He died of a heart attack on June 6, 1953.

==Works==
He is well known for his article in flagship American periodical, Annals, Association of American Geographers called ''Exceptionalism in geography: A Methodological Examination''&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, F.K. (1953): Exceptionalism in Geography: A Methodological Examination, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, vol. 43, pp. 226-245.&lt;/ref&gt; It was both a repudiation of [[Richard Hartshorne]]'s position in United States, and a call for a scientific approach to geography based upon the search for geographical laws (the ultimate form of a scientific generalization). Schaefer died before his article even appeared in print, and so he was never able to elaborate his argument, nor defend himself from Hartshorne's subsequent critique. But the article became a rallying point for the younger generation of [[Economic geography|economic geographers]] who were intent on reinventing the discipline as a science, or ''spatial science'' as it was later dubbed. The subject has now been revived by [[Economics|economists]] under the umbrella of the ''new economic geography''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4044">'''Friedrich Simony''' (30 November 1813, [[HrochÅ¯v TÃ½nec|Hrochowteinitz]] &amp;ndash; 20 July 1896, [[Sankt Gallen, Styria|Sankt Gallen]]) was an Austrian [[geographer]] and [[Alpinist|Alpine researcher]].

Initially trained as a [[pharmacist]], from 1836 he studied natural sciences at the [[University of Vienna]] by way of influence from [[botanist]] [[Joseph Franz von Jacquin]]. In 1848 he became a curator at the natural history museum in [[Klagenfurt]], and during the following year, served as chief [[geologist]] at the [[Geological Survey of Austria|Imperial Geological Institute]] in [[Vienna]]. In 1851, at the University of Vienna, he attained the first professorship for geography in Austria. In this role, he conducted research in the fields of [[glaciology]], [[climatology]], [[speleology]], [[ecology]], [[hydrology]], [[phytogeography]], etc.&lt;ref name=DB&gt;[http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/pnd119457415.html Simony, Friedrich] Deutsche Biographie&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1840 he performed [[geomorphology|geomorphological]] and glaciological research of the [[Dachstein Mountains]]. In September 1843 he was the first to spend the night at the summit of [[Hoher Dachstein]] (2995 m); in January 1847 he was first to achieve a winter ascent of the peak.&lt;ref name=HR&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h7HJNbI3bDEC&amp;pg=PA200&amp;lpg=PA200&amp;dq=Simonyspitzen+Friedrich&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AwYm5cv-v5&amp;sig=He6tjWcnRt8sUWG_aKjfGNx-LW8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjVt-z54f_JAhUH8z4KHThwCZUQ6AEIMjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Simonyspitzen%20Friedrich&amp;f=false Heights of Reflection: Mountains in the German Imagination] by Sean Moore Ireton, Caroline Schaumann&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeiou.at/aeiou.encyclop.s/s592398.htm AEIOU] Biographical sketch&lt;/ref&gt;

He is credited as being the first to undertake systematic [[meteorological]] studies of the eastern [[Alps]], similar to the research [[Horace-BÃ©nÃ©dict de Saussure]] performed in the western Alps years earlier.&lt;ref name=LI&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=N9aRAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA353&amp;lpg=PA353&amp;dq=Simony+limnology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PBqJz0gH-R&amp;sig=f_So4y63HYC3qvC47QLLDGhjsJ8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2i-D51v_JAhWKaT4KHZchB5YQ6AEIPzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Simony%20limnology&amp;f=false The Geographical Journal, Volume 1] Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; He was a pioneer in the field of [[limnology]]; in 1844 he conducted [[depth sounding]]s of the [[HallstÃ¤tter See]], results of which, were published decades later in ''Atlas der Ã¶sterreichischen Alpenseen'' ("Atlas of the Austrian Alpine lakes", edited by [[Albrecht Penck]] and [[Eduard Richter]], 2 volumes, 1895â96).&lt;ref name=DB/&gt; Throughout his career, he conducted extensive investigations on the depths and temperatures of all the lakes in [[Salzkammergut]].&lt;ref name=LI/&gt;
[[File:SimonyhÃ¼tte (1877).jpg|right|thumb|1877 photograph of the first Simony-HÃ¼tte.]]
In 1862 he was co-founder of the [[Austrian Alpine Club]]. Today, the organization owns a building known as the "Simony-HÃ¼tte" ([[Simony Hut]], 2205 m). It is located near [[HallstÃ¤tter Glacier]] and is named after him. His name is also associated with several Alpine landmarks, such as: ''Simonykees'' (Simony Glacier), ''Simony-Scharte'' (Simony Notch), ''Simonyschneide'' (Simony Ridge) and ''Simonyspitzen'' (Simony Peaks).&lt;ref name=HR/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7588">'''GarÃºa''' is a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word meaning '''drizzle''' or '''mist'''.  Although used in other contexts in the Spanish-speaking world, garÃºa most importantly refers to the moist cold [[fog]] that blankets the coasts of [[Peru]] and northern [[Chile]], especially during the southern hemisphere winter.  GarÃºa is called [[Camanchaca]] in Chile. GarÃºa brings mild temperatures and high humidity to a tropical coastal desert.  It also provides moisture from fog and mist to a nearly-rainless region and permits the existence of vegetated fog oases, called [[lomas]].

{{weather}}
[[File:Desert of Paracas, Peru - Paracas National Reserve.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Most of the coastal desert is devoid of vegetation, except where garÃºa has an impact.]]
[[File:Camanchaca.jpg|thumb|right|250px|In Chile garÃºa is called camanchaca.]]
While fog and drizzle are common in many coastal areas around the world, the prevalence and persistence of garÃºa and its impact on climate and the environment make it unique.

==Formation==
The cold waters of the [[Humboldt Current]] are responsible for both the coastal deserts and the garÃºa along the coasts of Peru and Chile from latitudes 5Â° to 30Â° South, a north-south distance of {{convert|2800|km|mile}}. Between those latitudes, the Humboldt Current hugs the coastline bringing mild temperatures and high humidity to a hyper-arid region. The cold waters of the Humboldt create an [[inversion (meteorology)|inversion]], the air near the ocean surface being cooler than the air above, contrary to most climatic situations. The [[trade winds]] blow the cool air and fog eastward over coastal areas, where the fog coalesces into drizzle and mist, the garÃºa.&lt;ref&gt;Beresford-Jones, David et al (2015), "Re-evaluating the resource potential of lomas fog oasis environments for Preceramic hunter-gatherers under past-ENSO modeson the south coast of Peru," ''Quaternary Science Reviews'', Vol. 129, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

GarÃºa is a dense [[fog]] that does not produce [[rain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0308/feature3/ | title=The Driest Place on Earth | publisher=National Geographic | date=2003 | accessdate=12 September 2013 | author=Vesilind, Priit J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water droplets in the fog measure between 1 and 40 [[microns]] across, too fine to form rain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Chile's fogcatchers are bringing water to the driest desert on Earth|url = http://www.gizmag.com/how-the-fogcatchers-of-the-atacama-are-bringing-water-to-the-driest-desert-on-earth/39040|website = www.gizmag.com|accessdate = 2015-08-25|date = August 25, 2015|last = Lavars|first = Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on climate==
The impact of the Humboldt Current and the garÃºa it produces is substantial.  [[Lima, Peru]] near sea level and located at 12Â° south latitude is in the tropics and would in most climatic situations have average temperatures of {{convert|26|C|F}} or higher in every month of the year.  By contrast, Lima has monthly average temperatures that range from {{convert|23|C|F}} (January through March) in the warmest months and {{convert|17|C|F}} in the coolest months of July through September, the months in which the garÃºa is most frequent.&lt;ref&gt;"Lima, Peru" http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3s=82648, accessed 10 Aug 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact on sunshine is even more substantial.  Annually, only 34 percent of daylight hours in Lima have sunshine.  On average, July and August receive less than one hour a day of sunshine.&lt;ref&gt;"Sunshine and daylight hours in Lima, Peru,"   http://www.lima.climatemps.com/sunlight.php&lt;/ref&gt; Lima receives only 1,230 hours of sunshine annually.  By contrast, [[London]], notoriously cloudy and foggy, gets 1,573 hours of sunshine annually and [[New York City]] receives 2,535 hours of sunshine annually.&lt;ref&gt;"London", http://www.climatedata.eu/climate.php?loc=ukxx0085&amp;lang=enhttps; "New York", https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/US/average-annual-sunshine-by-city.php, accessed 10  Aug 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  The climate of Lima is typical of the coasts of Peru and northern Chile.

The omnipresent garÃºa clouds and mist in winter in Lima led the nineteenth-century American author, [[Herman Melville]] to call Lima âthe strangest, saddest city thou cansât see.â (Twenty-first century Lima, however, has a flourishing tourist trade and has been described as having a "hidden loveliness.") &lt;ref&gt;"The hidden loveliness of Lima", ''The Times'', https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-hidden-loveliness-of-lima-mgxkblm0vgw, accessed 11 Aug 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
The average annual precipitation for most of the 1700-mile north-south desert coast is less than {{convert|10|mm|inch}} and some areas may go without rain for many years.  Only the moisture condensed from the garÃ¹a clouds -- plus occasional [[El NiÃ±o]] events -- enables islands of vegetation to be present in the lomas dotted up and down the Peruvian and Chilean coasts.  Except for the lomas and river valleys draining the higher and more humid [[Andes]] the coastal desert is almost completely barren of vegetation.&lt;ref name=Wondermondo&gt;{{cite web|title=Yungay â the driest place in the world |url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/SA/Chile/Antofagasta/Yungay.htm|work=Wondermondo |accessdate=3 April 2013 |date=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The garÃºa extends only a few kilometers inland, dissipating over land especially where it coalesces against mountain slopes at elevations of {{convert|300|m|ft}} to {{convert|1000|m|ft}}, the altitudes at which the vegetated lomas are found.&lt;ref&gt;Beresford-Jones et al, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fog collection ==
[[File:A fog oasis at the Atiquipa Lomas, Peru.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Atiquipa, Peru. The moisture from the garÃºa is sufficient to permit trees to flourish.]] 
In a water-scarce desert land, water is being captured from the moisture-laden garÃºa. In Chile, in 1985, scientists devised a [[fog collection]] system of [[polyolefin]] netting to capture the water droplets in the fog to produce running water for villages in these otherwise [[desert]] areas. The Camanchacas Project installed 50 large fog-collecting nets on a mountain ridge, which captured some 2% of the water in the fog. 

In 2005, another installation of panels of {{Convert|3|sqm|}} produced {{Convert|5|l}} per square meter per day.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Chile's fogcatchers are bringing water to the driest desert on Earth|url = http://www.gizmag.com/how-the-fogcatchers-of-the-atacama-are-bringing-water-to-the-driest-desert-on-earth/39040|website = www.gizmag.com|accessdate = 2015-08-25|date = August 25, 2015|last = Lavars|first = Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Peru, as part of an effort to preserve the fragile ecosystem of the garÃºa-watered lomas, conservation groups have installed fog-catching nets in the [[Atiquipa District]] to capture water and help the 80 families who live within the area to expand agriculture, primarily of [[olive]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Peru: The Blessing of Water in Peru's Coastal Desert," ''The Nature Conservancy,'' http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/southamerica/peru/explore/lomas-de-atiquipa.xml, accessed 17 Jul 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Honduras]]''' is a country in [[Central America]]. Honduras borders the [[Caribbean Sea]] and the North [[Pacific Ocean]]. [[Guatemala]] lies to the west, [[Nicaragua]] south east and [[El Salvador]] to the south west. Honduras is the second largest Central American republic, with a total area of {{convert|112,890|km2}}.

Honduras has a {{convert|700|km|adj=on|abbr=off|sp=us}} Caribbean coastline extending from the mouth of the [[RÃ­o Motagua]] in the west to the mouth of the [[RÃ­o Coco]] in the east, at [[Cape Gracias a Dios]]. The {{cvt|922|km}} southeastern side of the triangle is a land border with Nicaragua. It follows the RÃ­o Coco near the Caribbean Sea and then extends southwestward through mountainous terrain to the [[Gulf of Fonseca]] on the Pacific Ocean. The southern apex of the triangle is a {{cvt|153|km}} coastline on the Gulf Fonseca, which opens onto the Pacific Ocean. In the west there are two land borders: with [[El Salvador]] as {{cvt|342|km|mi|adj=mid|long}} and with Guatemala as {{cvt|256|km|mi|adj=mid|long}}.

==Topography==
[[Image:Honduras Topography.png|thumb|550px|Honduras' topography.]]
Honduras has three distinct topographical regions: an extensive interior highland area and two narrow coastal lowlands. The interior, which constitutes approximately 80 percent of the country's terrain, is mountainous. The larger Caribbean lowlands in the north and the Pacific lowlands bordering the Gulf of Fonseca are characterized by [[alluvial plains]].

===Interior highlands===
The interior highlands are the most prominent feature of Honduran topography. This mountain area makes up about 80% of the country's area, and is home to the majority of the population. Because the rugged terrain has made the land difficult to traverse and equally difficult to cultivate, this area has not been highly developed. The soil here is poor: Honduras lacks the rich volcanic ash found in other Central American countries. Until the early 20th century, the highland economy consisted primarily of mining and livestock.

In the west, Honduras' mountains blend into the mountain ranges of Guatemala. The western mountains have the highest peaks, with the Pico CongolÃ³n at an elevation of {{convert|2,500|m|ft|0}} and the [[Cerro Las Minas]] at {{cvt|2,850|m|ft|0}}. The Honduran border with El Salvador crosses the peak of [[Cerro El Pital]], the highest point in El Salvador at over {{cvt|2700|m|ft|0}}. These mountains are woodland covered with mainly pine forests.

In the east, the mountains merge with those in Nicaragua. Although generally not as high as the mountains near the Guatemalan border, the eastern ranges possess some high peaks, such as the MontaÃ±a de la Flor at {{cvt|2,300|m|ft|0}}, El BoquerÃ³n (Monte El BoquerÃ³n) at {{cvt|2,485|m|ft|0}}, and Pepe Bonito at {{cvt|2,435|m|ft|0}}.

One of the most prominent features of the interior highlands is a depression that runs from the Caribbean Sea to the Gulf of Fonseca. This depression splits the country's [[cordillera]]s into eastern and western parts and provides a relatively easy transportation route across the isthmus. Widest at its northern end near San Pedro Sula, the depression narrows as it follows the upper course of the RÃ­o Humuya. Passing first through Comayagua and then through narrow passes south of the city, the depression widens again as it runs along the border of El Salvador into the Gulf of Fonseca.

[[Image:Honduras econ 1983.jpg|thumb|550px|A economic activity map of Honduras, 1983.]]
[[Image:Honduras land 1983.jpg|thumb|550px|A land use map of Honduras, 1983.]]
Scattered throughout the interior highlands are numerous flat-floored valleys, at {{convert|300|to|900 |meters}} in elevation, which vary in size. The floors of the large valleys provide sufficient grass, shrubs, and dry woodland to support livestock and, in some cases, commercial agriculture. [[Subsistence agriculture]] has been relegated to the slopes of the valleys, with the limitations of small-sized holdings, primitive technology, and low productivity that traditionally accompany hillside cultivation. Villages and towns, including the capital, Tegucigalpa, are tucked in the larger valleys.

Vegetation in the interior highlands is varied. Much of the western, southern, and central mountains are open woodland; supporting pine forest interspersed with some oak, scrub, and grassy clearings. The ranges toward the east are primarily continuous areas of dense, broad-leaf evergreen forest. Around the highest peaks, remnants of dense rainforest that formerly covered much of the area are still found.

===Caribbean lowlands===

This area of river valleys and coastal plains, which most Honduras call "the north coast," or simply "the coast," has traditionally been Honduras's most exploited region. The central part of the Caribbean lowlands, east of La Ceiba, is a narrow coastal plain only a few kilometers wide.

To the east and west of this section the Caribbean lowlands widen and in places extend inland a considerable distance along broad river valleys. The broadest river valley, along the [[RÃ­o UlÃºa]] near the Guatemalan border, is Honduras's most developed area. Both [[Puerto CortÃ©s]], the country's largest port, and [[San Pedro Sula]], Honduras's industrial capital, are located here, as is [[La Ceiba]], the third largest city in the country.

To the east, near the Nicaraguan border, the Caribbean lowlands broaden to an extensive area known as [[La Mosquitia]]. Unlike the western part of the Caribbean lowlands, the Mosquitia is Honduras's least-developed area. Underpopulated and culturally distinct from the rest of the country, the area consists of inland savannah with swamps and [[mangrove]] near the coast. During times of heavy rainfall, much of the savannah area is covered by shallow water, making transportation by means other than a shallow-draft boat almost impossible.

More than 46 ''campesinos'' from the AguÃ¡n Valley, in the far north-east of Honduras, have either been killed or have disappeared since the 2009 coup.&lt;ref name=nation&gt;

===Pacific lowlands===
The smallest geographic region of Honduras, the Pacific lowlands, is a strip of land averaging {{cvt|25|km|mi|spell=in|disp=x| wide (|)}} on the north shore of the Gulf of Fonseca. The land is flat, becoming swampy near the shores of the gulf, and is composed mostly of alluvial soils washed down from the mountains. The gulf is shallow and the water rich in fish and [[mollusk]]s. Mangroves along the shore make [[shrimp]] and [[shellfish]] particularly abundant by providing safe and abundant breeding areas amid their extensive networks of underwater roots.

Several islands in the gulf fall under Honduras's jurisdiction. The two largest, Zacate Grande and El Tigre, are eroded volcanoes, part of the chain of volcanoes that extends along the Pacific coast of Central America. Both islands have volcanic cones more than {{cvt|700|meters}} in elevation that serve as landmarks for vessels entering Honduras's Pacific.

===Islands===
{{See also|List of islands of Honduras}}

Honduras controls a number of islands as part of its offshore territories. In the Caribbean Sea, the islands of RoatÃ¡n (Isla de RoatÃ¡n), Utila, and Guanaja together form the ''[[Islas de la BahÃ­a]]'' (Bay Islands), one of the eighteen departments into which Honduras is divided. [[RoatÃ¡n]], the largest of the three islands, is {{convert|50|by|5|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on}}. The Islas de la BahÃ­a archipelago also has a number of smaller islands, among them the islets of Barbareta (Isla Barbareta), Santa Elena (Isla Santa Elena), and Morat (Isla Morat).

Farther out in the Caribbean are the Islas Santanillas, formerly known as Swan Islands. A number of small islands and keys can be found nearby, among them Cayos Zapotillos and Cayos Cochinos. In the Gulf of Fonseca, the main islands under Honduran control are El Tigre, Zacate Grande (Isla Zacate Grande), and ExposiciÃ³n (Isla ExposiciÃ³n).

==Climate==
[[File:Honduras KÃ¶ppen.svg|250px|thumb|[[KÃ¶ppen climate classification system|KÃ¶ppen climate types]] of Honduras]]

The climatic types of each of the three physiographic regions differ. The Caribbean lowlands have a tropical wet climate with consistently high temperatures and humidity, and rainfall fairly evenly distributed throughout the year. The Pacific lowlands have a tropical wet and dry climate with high temperatures but a distinct dry season from November through April. The interior highlands also have a distinct dry season, but, as is characteristic of a tropical highland climate, temperatures in this region decrease as elevation increases.

Unlike in more northerly latitudes, temperatures in the tropics vary primarily with elevation instead of with the season. Land below {{convert|1,000|m|ft|0|sp=us}} is commonly known as ''tierra caliente'' (hot land), between {{cvt|1000|and|2000|m|ft|0}} as ''tierra templada'' (temperate land), and above {{cvt|2,000|m|ft|0}} as ''tierra frÃ­a'' (cold land). Both the Caribbean and Pacific lowlands are ''tierra caliente'', with daytime highs averaging between {{convert|28|and|32|Â°C|Â°F|1}} throughout the year.

In the Pacific lowlands, April, the last month of the dry season, brings the warmest temperatures; the rainy season is slightly cooler, although higher humidity during the rainy season makes these months feel more uncomfortable. In the Caribbean lowlands, the only relief from the year-round heat and humidity comes during December or January when an occasional strong cold front from the north (a ''norte'') brings several days of strong northwest winds and slightly cooler temperatures.

The interior highlands range from tierra templada to tierra frÃ­a. [[Tegucigalpa]], in a sheltered valley and at an elevation of {{cvt|1,000|m|ft|0}}, has a pleasant climate, with an average high temperature ranging from {{convert|30|Â°C}} in April, the warmest month, to {{convert|25|Â°C}} in January, the coolest. Above {{convert|2,000|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, temperatures can fall to near freezing at night, and frost sometimes occurs.

Rain falls year round in the Caribbean lowlands but is seasonal throughout the rest of the country. Amounts are copious along the north coast, especially in the Mosquitia, where the average rainfall is {{convert|2,400|mm|in|1|sp=us}}. Nearer San Pedro Sula, amounts are slightly less from November to April, but each month still has considerable precipitation. The interior highlands and Pacific lowlands have a dry season, known locally as "summer," from November to April. Almost all the rain in these regions falls during the "winter," from May to September. Total yearly amounts depend on surrounding topography; Tegucigalpa, in a sheltered valley, averages only {{cvt|1,000|mm|in|1}} of precipitation.

=== Hurricanes ===
Honduras lies within the hurricane belt, and the Caribbean coast is particularly vulnerable to hurricanes or tropical storms that travel inland from the Caribbean. Hurricane Francelia in 1969 and Tropical Storm Alleta in 1982 affected thousands of people and caused extensive damage to crops. [[Hurricane Fifi]] in 1974 killed more than 8,000 and destroyed nearly the entire banana crop.

In 1998 [[Hurricane Mitch]] became the most deadly hurricane to strike the Western Hemisphere in the last two centuries. This massive hurricane not only battered the Honduran coastline, but engulfed nearly the entire country with its powerful winds and torrential downpours. Throughout Central America, Mitch claimed in excess of 11,000 lives, with thousands of others missing. More than three million people were either homeless or severely affected. Most Hurricanes occasionally form over the Pacific and move north to affect southern Honduras, but Pacific storms are generally less severe and their landfall rarer.

On September 4, 2007, [[Hurricane Felix]] made landfall at Honduras and Nicaragua, as a Category 5 hurricane. In November 2008, [[Hurricane Paloma]], along with the [[October 2008 Central America floods]], left at least 60 people dead and more than 300,000 in need of assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |agency= United Nations News Service |publisher=ReliefWeb |date= November 18, 2008 |accessdate= May 21, 2015 |title= Hondurans face many months of struggle after deadly floods, UN aid wing says |url= http://reliefweb.int/report/honduras/hondurans-face-many-months-struggle-after-deadly-floods-un-aid-wing-says }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrography==
{{Main article|Rivers of Honduras}}

[[File:Barra-de-los-rios-ulua y chamelecon.jpg|thumb|400px|The [[UlÃºa River]] as seen from the air. The Ulua is perhaps the most economically important river in Honduras.]]
Honduras is a water-rich country. The most important river in Honduras is the [[UlÃºa River|UlÃºa]], which flows {{cvt|400|km}} to the Caribbean through the economically important Valle de Sula. Numerous other rivers drain the interior highlands and empty north into the Caribbean. These other rivers are important, not as transportation routes, but because of the broad fertile valleys they have produced.  The [[Choluteca River]] runs south from [[Tegucigalpa]] through [[Choluteca, Choluteca|Choluteca]] and out at the [[Gulf of Fonseca]].

Rivers also define about half of Honduras's international borders. The [[RÃ­o GoascorÃ¡n]], flowing to the [[Gulf of Fonseca]], and the [[RÃ­o Lempa]] define part of the border between El Salvador and Honduras. The [[RÃ­o Coco|Coco River]] marks about half of the border between Nicaragua and Honduras.

Despite an abundance of rivers, large bodies of water are rare. Lago de Yojoa, located in the west-central part of the country, is the sole natural lake in Honduras. This lake is twenty-two kilometers long and at its widest point measures fourteen kilometers. Several large, brackish lagoons open onto the Caribbean in northeast Honduras. These shallow bodies of water allow limited transportation to points along the coast.

==Natural resources==
The natural resources include: [[timbers]], [[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[iron ore]], [[antimony]], [[coal]], [[fish]], and [[hydropower]] from the mountain rivers.

==Natural hazards==
Frequent mild [[earthquake]]s, damaging [[hurricanes]], and floods along the [[Caribbean]] coast are examples of Honduran natural hazards.

==Environmental issues==
Deforestation poses a particular problem for Honduras; the goals of conserving endangered natural resources and promoting economic development has often been quite difficult to combine, which has resulted in conflicting policies that fail to protect forests. Honduras has suffered the greatest percentage loss of forest cover of any country in [[Latin America]]. The forests in Honduras are an important source of economic resources to finance government programs. The tropical forests in Honduras are diminishing rapidly due to poverty in the country. The majority of the population of Honduras see the forests as an obstacle to the expansion of ranching and agricultural activities, ignoring the significance that forests have for the society through protection of fauna, soils, recreation, purification of air, and the regulation of water sources. The urban population is also increasing rapidly over the years, which means that it has led to the clearing of land for farming and the farming of marginal soils in rural areas, as well as to uncontrolled development in the fringes of urban areas. Illegal logging is also a major problem in Honduras. The majority of the production of timber in the country is illegal. According to the [[Center for International Policy]] and the [[Environmental Investigation Agency]], the timber trade corruption involves politicians, timber companies, bureaucrats, mayors, and even the police.  All of these factors contribute to deforestation and consequently to soil erosion. According to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], Honduras lost 59,000 hectares of forest per year between 1990 and 2000. Deforestation in regions dominated by tropical dry forests has advanced faster than regions dominated by other types of forests. Tropical dry forests have lower species richness compared to moist forests. However, tropical dry forests possess higher levels of endemic species, greater utility for humans, and also have a higher human population density. The effects of deforestation are more noticeable during tropical storms and hurricanes. In 1998, [[Hurricane Mitch]] killed thousands and also caused damage to the country. According to aerial surveys following the storm, mudslides were worst in deforested areas than forested areas. Many endangered species live in the forests of Honduras, 
and they may soon be extinct if deforestation continues. The climate has also changed because of the lack of trees in Honduras. This has caused the growing season for farmers to be shortened. The ground in deforested areas is absorbing all the water as well. The largest source of freshwater in Honduras, [[Lake Yojoa]], is on the verge of turning into a swamp. This is due to the high rate of pollution and logging as well. Lake Yojoa is also being polluted by heavy metals from local mining activities. Lake Yojoa is home to more than 400 species of birds, but the area surrounding the Lake is suffering from deforestation and water pollution. However, not only Lake Yojoa is being polluted with heavy metals, nearby rivers and streams are also being polluted.

[[File:St Lucia map.png|thumb|300px |Map of Saint Lucia.]]

'''[[Saint Lucia]]''' is one of many small land masses composing the insular group known as the [[Windward Islands]]. Unlike large limestone areas such as [[Florida]], [[Cuba]], and the [[Yucatan Peninsula]], or the [[Bahamas]], which is a small island group composed of coral and sand, St. Lucia is a typical Windward Island formation of [[volcanic]] rock that came into existence long after much of the region had already been formed.

St. Lucia's physical features are notable. Dominated by high peaks and rain forests in the interior, the {{convert|616|km2|sqmi|abbr=off|sp=us|adj=on}} island is known for the twin peaks of [[Gros Piton]] and [[Petit Piton]] on the southwestern coast, its soft sandy beaches, and its magnificent natural harbors. [[Mount Gimie]], the highest peak, is located in the central mountain range and rises to {{convert|958|m|ft|0|sp=us}} above sea level, a contrast that is also evident in the abrupt climatic transition from coastal to inland areas. The steep terrain also accentuates the many rivers that flow from central St. Lucia to the Caribbean. Fertile land holdings, which support banana farming, are scattered throughout the island.

St. Lucia has a tropical, humid climate moderated by northeast trade winds that allow for pleasant year-round conditions. Mean annual temperatures range from {{convert|26|Â°C|1}} to {{convert|32|Â°C|1}} at sea level and drop to an average of {{convert|13|Â°C|1}} in the mountain peaks. The abundant annual rainfall accumulates to approximately {{convert|2000|mm|in|1|sp=us}}, with most precipitation occurring during the June to December wet season. Hurricanes are the most severe climatic disturbance in this area and have been known to cause extensive damage. Although St. Lucia has historically been spared from serious hurricane destruction, [[Hurricane Allen]] decimated the agricultural sector and claimed nine lives in 1980. More recently, in 2010, Hurricane Tomas claimed seven lives and also caused extensive agricultural damage, particularly to the island's burgeoning cocoa crop.

==General==

===Location===
Co-ordinates: {{coord|13.9|N|61.0|W|type:isle|display=inline, title}}

Saint Lucia is in the [[Caribbean]], an island between the [[Caribbean Sea]] and [North Atlantic Ocean], north of [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Saint Vincent]] and north-west of [[Barbados]]. The capital city of Saint Lucia is [[Castries]], where about one third of the population lives. Major towns include [[Gros Islet]], [[SoufriÃ¨re, Saint Lucia|SoufriÃ¨re]] and [[Vieux Fort]].

===Measurements===
* ''total area:'' 616&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²
* ''length:'' 43.5&amp;nbsp;km
* ''width:'' 22.5&amp;nbsp;km
* ''comparative area:'' The same as [[Toronto]] or 3.5 times the size of [[Washington, DC]]
* ''Land boundaries:'' 0&amp;nbsp;km
* ''Coastline:'' 158&amp;nbsp;km

===Maritime claims===
* {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|lk=in}}

* ''exclusive economic zone:'' {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1}}
* ''territorial sea:'' {{convert|12|nmi|km mi|1}}

==Climate==
Saint Lucia is in the tropical zone, although its climate is moderated by northeast trade winds. Since it is fairly close to the equator, the temperature does not fluctuate much between winter and summer. The dry season is from December to June, and the rainy season is from June to November. Average daytime temperatures are around &lt;br&gt;{{convert|29|C|F|1|abbr=on}}, and average nighttime temperatures are around {{convert|18|C|F|1|abbr=on}}. Average annual rainfall ranges from {{convert|1300|mm|1|abbr=on}} on the coast to {{convert|3810|mm|0|abbr=on}} in the mountain rainforests.

==Terrain==
Volcanic and mountainous with some broad, fertile valleys.

===Elevation extremes===
* ''lowest point:'' Caribbean Sea 0&amp;nbsp;m
* ''highest point:'' Mt. Gimie 950&amp;nbsp;m
[[File:sulfur spring st lucia.JPG|thumb|Sulfur spring.]]

===Natural resources===
[[Forests]], sandy beaches [[mineral]]s ([[pumice]]), [[mineral spring]]s, [[Geothermal (geology)|geothermal]] potential.

===Land use===
* ''Arable land:'' 8%
* ''permanent crops:'' 21%
* ''permanent pastures:'' 5%
* ''forests and woodland:'' 13%
* ''other:'' 53% (1993 est.)
* ''Irrigated land:'' {{convert|10|kmÂ²|0|abbr=on}} (1993 est.)

== Political map ==

=== Quarters ===
{{main|Quarters of Saint Lucia}}
[[File:Sainte-Lucie - districts numÃ©rotÃ©s.png|thumb|Quarters of Saint Lucia]]

The island of Saint Lucia is divided into 11 quarters:

# [[Anse la Raye Quarter|Anse la Raye]]
# [[Canaries Quarter|Canaries]]
# [[Castries Quarter|Castries]]
# [[Choiseul Quarter|Choiseul]]
# [[Dennery Quarter|Dennery]]
# [[Central Forest Reserve (Saint Lucia)|Forest Reserve]]
# [[Gros Islet Quarter|Gros Islet]]
# [[Laborie Quarter|Laborie]]
# [[Micoud Quarter|Micoud]]
# [[SoufriÃ¨re Quarter|SoufriÃ¨re]]
# [[Vieux Fort Quarter|Vieux Fort]]

==Natural hazards==
[[Hurricane]]s and volcanic activity.

The island was severely affected by [[Hurricane Allen]] in 1980 and [[Hurricane Tomas]] in 2010, causing agricultural damage and a drop in visitor arrivals, but Saint Lucia has generally had fewer hurricanes than many other Caribbean islands, due to its southerly location. Hurricanes and volcanoes would both damage the coral.

==Environment==

===Current issues===
Deforestation; soil erosion, particularly in the northern region.

===International agreements===
''party to:''
[[Biodiversity]], [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Climate Change]], [[Desertification]], [[Endangered Species]], [[Environmental Modification]], [[Hazardous Wastes]], [[Law of the Sea]], [[Marine Dumping]], [[Ozone Layer Protection]], [[Whaling]], [[Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2128">'''Industrial Nature''' is the regeneration of natural vegetation on industrial sites; the invasion of abandoned or disused industrial sites by colonising species; or new plantings on abandoned, disused or remediated industrial sites. The underlying principal is that the historical industrial use of landscapes or sites creates a new environment which species can use either by design as in the case of a park or revegetated area, or by colonisation.

The concept has its origins in Germany, specifically at the [[Emscher Landscape Park]] in the Ruhr, (of which the [[Landschaftspark Duisburg-Nord]] is the best known example) and has been applied at the Sudgelande Park in Berlin.

Another example can be found at the Deutsches Technikmuseum [[German Museum of Technology (Berlin)]], at the former locomotive workshops and goods yard (Anhalter GÃ¼terbahnhof) of Berlin-Anhalt Railway Company. Here much of the goods yards and part of the roundhouse complex has been left as a ruin, colonised by a variety of non-native plants.

The '''Jardin Exotique de Monaco''' ([[French language|French]] for "exotic garden of Monaco") is a [[botanical garden]] located on a cliffside in [[Monaco]].

==History==
The [[succulent plant]]s were brought back from [[Mexico]] in the late 1860s.&lt;ref name=jardinexot&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Paul|first2=Cohen|last2=Brenda|title=Le Jardin Exotique, Les Grottes de L'Observatoire, and Le MusÃ©e D'Anthropolgie PrÃ©historique in Monaco |journal=Journal of College Science Teaching |date=December 1998 |volume=28|issue=3|pages=208â209|jstor=42990109|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1895, [[Augustin Gastaud]], who served as the Chief Gardener of the State Gardens of Monaco, grew the succulents in the Jardin St Martin.&lt;ref name=jardinexot/&gt;&lt;ref name=nice75ans&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arama|first1=GaÃ«lle|title=Monaco Jardin exotique : 75 ans et toujours autant de piquant ?|url=http://archives.nicematin.com/article/environnement/monaco-jardin-exotique-75-ans-et-toujours-autant-de-piquant.51072.html|accessdate=December 24, 2015|work=Nice Matin|date=June 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert I, Prince of Monaco]] acquired a piece of land in [[Les Moneghetti]] in 1912.&lt;ref name=jardinexot/&gt; He commissioned [[Louis Notari]], the Chief Engineer of Monaco, to build a new garden with [[footbridge]]s.&lt;ref name=jardinexot/&gt; During the construction, Notari found a [[grotto]] underneath in 1916.&lt;ref name=jardinexot/&gt; Meanwhile, the garden was dedicated in 1933.&lt;ref name=jardinexot/&gt; Monegasque agronomist [[Louis Vatrican]] served as its first director from 1933 to 1969.&lt;ref name=nice75ans/&gt; He added African succulents to the existing South African plants.&lt;ref name=nice75ans/&gt; After he retired in 1969, he was succeeded by [[Marcel Kroenlein]].&lt;ref name=nice75ans/&gt;

The grotto was opened to the public in 1950, but it may only be visited with specialized guides. Evidence of prehistoric human inhabitants has been found in the cave.&lt;ref name=jardinexot/&gt; There is a [[museum of Prehistoric Anthropology]] within the Exotic Garden displaying many of those prehistoric remains.&lt;ref name=jardinexot/&gt; It was founded by Prince Albert I in 1902.

'''Lake Vostok''' ({{lang-ru|ÐÐ·ÐµÑÐ¾ ÐÐ¾ÑÑÐ¾Ðº}}, ''Ozero Vostok'', lit. "Lake East") is the largest of [[Antarctica]]'s almost 400 known [[subglacial lake]]s.
Lake Vostok is located at the southern [[Pole of Cold]], beneath Russia's [[Vostok Station]] under the surface of the central [[East Antarctic Ice Sheet]], which is at {{Convert|3488|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[sea level|above mean sea level]]. The surface of this [[fresh water]] lake is approximately {{Convert|4000|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} under the surface of the ice, which places it at approximately {{Convert|500|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} below sea level.

Measuring {{Convert|250|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} long by {{Convert|50|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} wide at its widest point&lt;ref name="ASOC" /&gt;, it covers an area of {{Convert|12500|km2|sqmi|-1|abbr=on}} making it the [[List of lakes by area|16th largest lake by surface area]]. With an average depth of {{Convert|432|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, it has an estimated volume of {{Convert|5400|km3|mi3|-2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="facts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~mstuding/facts_about_lakes.html |title=Subglacial Lake Facts |publisher=Ldeo.columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=7 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102111109/http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~mstuding/facts_about_lakes.html |archivedate=2 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the [[List of lakes by volume|6th largest lake by volume]].

The lake is divided into two deep [[Endorheic basin|basins]] by a ridge. The liquid water depth over the ridge is about {{Convert|200|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}, compared to roughly {{Convert|400|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} deep in the northern basin and {{Convert|800|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} deep in the southern.

The lake is named after Vostok Station, which in turn is named after the ''[[Vostok (sloop-of-war)|Vostok]]'' (ÐÐ¾ÑÑÐ¾Ðº), a [[sloop-of-war]] ship, which means "East" in Russian.&lt;ref name="vostokcoin"&gt;{{cite book |title=Watercraft on World Coins: Europe, 1800-2005 |publisher=The Alpha Press |last=Dotan |first=Yossi |date=2007 |pages=220 |isbn=978-1-898595-49-6 |quote=The 900-ton Vostok was built in 1818 at the Okhta Shipyard of Stoke and Kolodnin in St. Petersburg. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of a subglacial lake in the Vostok region was first suggested by Russian geographer [[Andrey Kapitsa]] based on seismic soundings made during the [[Soviet Antarctic Expedition]]s in 1959 and 1964 to measure the thickness of the ice sheet.&lt;ref name=appeal/&gt;&lt;ref name=lenta-kapitsa/&gt; The continued research by Russian and British scientists&lt;ref name=lenta-kapitsa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsru.com/russia/03aug2011/kapica.html |title=Ð£Ð¼ÐµÑ ÑÑÐµÐ½ÑÐ¹ ÐÐ½Ð´ÑÐµÐ¹ ÐÐ°Ð¿Ð¸ÑÐ°, ÑÐ´ÐµÐ»Ð°Ð²ÑÐ¸Ð¹ Ð² ÐÐ½ÑÐ°ÑÐºÑÐ¸Ð´Ðµ Ð¾Ð´Ð½Ð¾ Ð¸Ð· ÐºÑÑÐ¿Ð½ÐµÐ¹ÑÐ¸Ñ Ð¾ÑÐºÑÑÑÐ¸Ð¹ XX Ð²ÐµÐºÐ° |language=Russian |trans-title=The author of one of the greatest discoveries, Andrey Kapitsa, died |publisher=NEWSru.com |date=3 August 2011 |accessdate=25 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; led by 1993 to the final confirmation of the existence of the lake by J.

Russian scientist [[Peter Kropotkin]] first proposed the idea of fresh water under Antarctic [[ice sheet]]s at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Research on the [[Ice age]]", ''Notices of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society'', 1876.&lt;/ref&gt; He theorized that the tremendous pressure exerted by the cumulative mass of thousands of vertical meters of ice could increase the temperature at the lowest portions of the ice sheet to the [[Pressure melting point|point where the ice would melt]]. Kropotkin's theory was further developed by Russian [[glaciology|glaciologist]] I. A. Zotikov, who wrote his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] thesis on this subject in 1967.&lt;ref name=appeal/&gt;

Russian geographer [[Andrey Kapitsa]] used seismic soundings in the region of [[Vostok Station]] made during the [[Soviet Antarctic Expedition]] in 1959 and 1964 to measure the thickness of the ice sheet.&lt;ref name=appeal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asoc.org/storage/documents/Other_publications/asoc_vostok_statement041408.pdf |format=PDF |title=Appeal to the Duma on Lake Vostok, Antarctica |date=14 April 2008 |work=Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition |accessdate=10 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kapitsa was the first to suggest the existence of a subglacial lake in the region,&lt;ref name=lenta-kapitsa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lenta.ru/news/2011/08/03/kapitsa/ |script-title=ru:Ð¡ÐºÐ¾Ð½ÑÐ°Ð»ÑÑ Ð¿ÐµÑÐ²Ð¾Ð¾ÑÐºÑÑÐ²Ð°ÑÐµÐ»Ñ Ð¾Ð·ÐµÑÐ° ÐÐ¾ÑÑÐ¾Ðº Ð² ÐÐ½ÑÐ°ÑÐºÑÐ¸Ð´Ðµ |trans-title=Discoverer of the Lake Vostok in the Antarctica died |publisher=[[Lenta.ru]] |language=Russian |date=3 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the subsequent research confirmed his hypothesis.&lt;ref name=rgs&gt;{{cite news |title=Andrey Kapitsa dies in Moscow |url=http://int.rgo.ru/news/andrey-kapitsa-dies-in-moscow/ |work=[[Russian Geographical Society]] |quote=In cooperation with other scientists, Andrey Kapitsa made one of the most remarkable geographical discoveries of the 20th century â a vast lake beneath the Antarctic ice, near the polar research station Vostok. |date=3 August 2011 |accessdate=4 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When British scientists in Antarctica performed airborne ice-penetrating [[radar]] surveys in the early 1970s, they detected unusual radar readings at the site which suggested the presence of a liquid freshwater lake below the ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oswald |first=GKA |last2=Robin |first2=G. de Q. |date=1973 |title=Lakes beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet |journal=Nature |volume=245 |issue=5423 |pages=251â4 |doi=10.1038/245251a0 |url= |bibcode=1973Natur.245..251O }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Jeff Ridley, a [[remote sensing]] specialist with the [[Mullard Space Science Laboratory]] at [[University College London]], directed the [[European Remote-Sensing Satellite|ERS-1]] satellite to turn its high-frequency array toward the center of the Antarctic [[ice cap]]. The data from ERS-1 confirmed the findings from the 1973 British surveys,&lt;ref name=Morton&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/vostok_pr.html |title=Ice Station Vostok |first=O |last=Morton |publisher=Wired |accessdate=31 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but these new data were not published in the ''[[Journal of Glaciology]]'' until 1993. [[Space-based radar]] revealed that this subglacial body of fresh water is one of the largest lakes in the world, and one of some 140 subglacial lakes in Antarctica. Russian and British scientists delineated the lake in 1996 by integrating a variety of data, including airborne ice-penetrating [[radar imaging]] observations and space-based radar altimetry. It has been confirmed that the lake contains large amounts of liquid water under the more than {{convert|3|km|mi|sp=us|adj=mid|-thick}} ice cap. The lake has at least 22 [[Glacier cave|cavities of liquid water]], averaging {{convert|10|km|mi|sp=us|0}} each.&lt;ref name="FÃ¼ttererKleinschmidt2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=Dieter |last=FÃ¼tterer |first2=Georg |last2=Kleinschmidt |title=Antarctica: contributions to global Earth sciences: proceedings of the IX International Symposium of Antarctic Earth Sciences Potsdam, 2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PcJcEvPFpT4C&amp;pg=PA138 |date=2006 |publisher=BirkhÃ¤user |isbn=978-3-540-30673-3 |page=138 |accessdate=15 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station after which the lake is named commemorates the ''[[Vostok (sloop-of-war)|Vostok]]'' (ÐÐ¾ÑÑÐ¾Ðº), the 900-ton [[sloop-of-war]] ship sailed by one of the discoverers of Antarctica, [[Russian explorers|Russian explorer]] Admiral [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen|Fabian von Bellingshausen]].&lt;ref name="vostokcoin" /&gt; Because the word ''Vostok'' means "East" in Russian, the names of the station and lake also reflect the fact that they are located in East Antarctica.

In 2005 an island was found in the central part of the lake.&lt;ref name=island&gt;{{cite news |first=D |last=Whitehouse |title=Russia to resume Vostok drilling |date=25 May 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4577627.stm |work=BBC News |accessdate=28 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in January 2006, the discovery of two nearby smaller lakes under the ice cap was published; they are named [[90 Degrees East]] and [[Sovetskaya (lake)|Sovetskaya]].&lt;ref&gt;Robin Bell and Michael Studinger, [[Geophysical]] researchers from [[Columbia University]], published in ''[[Geophysical Research Letters]]''&lt;/ref&gt; It is suspected that these Antarctic subglacial lakes may be connected by a network of subglacial rivers. [[Centre for Polar Observation &amp; Modelling]] glaciologists propose that many of the subglacial lakes of Antarctica are at least temporarily interconnected.&lt;ref name="Siegert"/&gt; Because of varying water pressure in individual lakes, large subsurface rivers may suddenly form and then force large amounts of water through the solid ice.&lt;ref name="Siegert"/&gt;

==Geological history==

Africa separated from Antarctica around 160&amp;nbsp;million years ago, followed by the [[Indian subcontinent]], in the early [[Cretaceous]] (about 125 million years ago). About 66 million years ago, Antarctica (then connected to Australia) still had a [[tropics|tropical]] to [[subtropics|subtropical]] climate, complete with [[marsupial]] [[fauna]] and an extensive [[temperate rainforest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=L |last=O'Hanl |title=Antarctic Forests Reveal Ancient Trees |date=5 November 2004 |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20041101/leaves.html?ct=6817.32046957226 |work=Discovery News |accessdate=31 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628230903/http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20041101/leaves.html?ct=6817.32046957226 |archivedate=28 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Frozen in time: Fossils from the Antarctic |date=2012 |url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_antarctica/geography/rock/fossil-collection.php |work=[[British Antarctic Survey]] |accessdate=20 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lake water is estimated to have been sealed off under the thick ice sheet about 15 million years ago.&lt;ref name="January 2011" /&gt; Initially, it was thought that the same water had made up the lake since the time of its formation, giving a [[Residence time (fluid dynamics)|residence time]] in the order of one million years.&lt;ref name="Siegert"/&gt; Later research by [[Robin Bell (scientist)|Robin Bell]] and Michael Studinger from the [[LamontâDoherty Earth Observatory]] of [[Columbia University]] suggested that the water of the lake is continually freezing and being carried away by the motion of the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], while being replaced by water melting from other parts of the ice sheet in these high pressure conditions.

[[File:GISP2 team photo core37.jpeg|thumb |[[Ice core]]s drilled at Vostok Station, which is seen in the background]]
Researchers working at Vostok Station produced one of the world's longest [[ice core]]s in 1998. A joint Russian, French, and United States team drilled and analyzed the core, which is {{convert|3623|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. Ice samples from cores drilled close to the top of the lake have been assessed to be as old as 420,000&amp;nbsp;years. The assumption is that the lake has been sealed from the surface since the ice sheet formed, 15 million years ago. Drilling of the core was deliberately halted roughly {{convert |100|m|ft|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="Jouzel"&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=4 |last=Jouzel |first=J |last2=Petit |first2=JR |last3=Souchez |first3=R |last4=Barkov |first4=NI |last5=Lipenkov |first5=VY |last6=Raynaud |first6=D |last7=Stievenard |first7=M |last8=Vassiliev |first8=NI |last9=Verbeke |first9=V |last10=Vimeux |first10=F |title=More than 200&amp;nbsp;meters of lake ice above subglacial Lake Vostok, Antarctica |journal=Science |volume=286 |issue=5447 |pages=2138â41 |date=1999 |pmid=10591641 |doi=10.1126/science.286.5447.2138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; above the suspected boundary between the ice sheet and the liquid waters of the lake. This was to prevent contamination of the lake with the 60-ton column of [[Chlorofluorocarbon|Freon]] and [[kerosene]] used to prevent the borehole from collapsing and freezing over.&lt;ref name=Morton/&gt;

From this core, specifically from ice that is thought to have formed from lake water freezing onto the base of the ice sheet, [[extremophile|extremophile microbes]] were found, suggesting that the lake water supports life.

Sequences from [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]], [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]], [[Psychrophile|psychrophilic]], [[Thermophile|thermophilic]], [[Halophile|halophilic]], [[Alkaliphile|alkaliphilic]], [[acidophile|acidophilic]], desiccation-resistant, [[autotroph]]ic, and [[heterotroph]]ic organisms were present, including a number from multicellular eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="Shtarkman and KoÃ§er" /&gt;

However, microbiologist David Pearce of the University of Northumbria in Newcastle, UK, stated that the DNA could simply be contamination from the drilling process, and not representative of Lake Vostok itself. The old ice cores were drilled in the 1990s to look for evidence of past climates buried in the ice, rather than for life, so the drilling equipment was not [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]].&lt;ref name="DNA analyses"&gt;{{cite news |author=Michael Marshall |title=Lake Vostok may boast a thriving ecosystem |date=8 July 2013 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23832-lake-vostok-may-boast-a-thriving-ecosystem.html |work=New Scientist |accessdate=10 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also Sergey Bulat, a Lake Vostok expert at the Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute in Gatchina, Russia, doubts that any of the cells or DNA fragments in the samples would belong to organisms that might actually exist in the lake. He says that it is very probable that the samples are heavily contaminated with tissue and microbes from the outside world.&lt;ref name="Nature 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Claims of Lake Vostok fish get frosty response |journal=Nature |date=9 July 2013 |first=Quirin Schiermeier |doi=10.1038/nature.2013.13364 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/claims-of-lake-vostok-fish-get-frosty-response-1.13364 |accessdate=10 July 2013 |last1=Schiermeier }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russia and France====
Russian and French scientists have been carrying out molecular DNA studies of the water from Lake Vostok that was frozen in the borehole, by constructing numerous [[Library (biology)|DNA libraries]],&lt;ref name="Lagnado"&gt;{{cite news |first=Alice |last=Lagnado |title=Whatâs really inside Lake Vostok |date=2 January 2014 |url=http://voiceofrussia.com/uk/news/2014_01_02/What-s-really-inside-Lake-Vostok-8507/ |work=Voice of Russia |accessdate=16 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which are collections of fragments of DNA that allow scientists to identify which species of bacteria may belong to. Samples taken from the lake so far contain about one part of kerosene per 1000 of water, and they are contaminated with bacteria previously present in the drill bit and the kerosene drilling fluid.&lt;ref name="Lagnado" /&gt; So far, the scientists have been able to identify 255 contaminant species, but also have found an unknown bacterium when they initially drilled down to the lake's surface in 2012, with no matches in any international databases, and they hope it may be a unique inhabitant of Lake Vostok.&lt;ref name="Lagnado" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TDT-20130307"&gt;{{cite news |title=New life form found in Lake Vostok |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/antarctica/9915788/New-life-form-found-in-Lake-Vostok.html |date=7 March 2013 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=8 March 2013 |author=Staff }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LS-20130307"&gt;{{cite web |last=Howell |first=Elizabeth |title=New Type of Bacteria Reportedly Found in Buried Antarctic Lake |url=http://www.livescience.com/27737-new-bacteria-found-antarctic-lake.html |date=7 March 2013 |work=[[LiveScience]] |accessdate=8 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Vladimar Korolev, the laboratory head of the study at the same institution, said that the bacteria could in principle be a contaminant that uses keroseneâthe antifreeze used during drillingâas an energy source.&lt;ref name="RT-20130308"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff |title=Russian scientists discover unidentified bacteria in sub-glacial Lake Vostok |url=http://rt.com/news/lake-vostok-russia-bacteria-944/ |date=8 March 2013 |work=[[RT (TV network)]] |accessdate=8 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RBTH-20130309"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff |title=No unfamiliar microorganisms found in Lake Vostok water - researcher |date=9 March 2013 |publisher=[[Russia Beyond the Headlines]] |url=http://rbth.ru/news/2013/03/09/no_unfamiliar_microorganisms_found_in_lake_vostok_water_-researcher_23670.html |work=[[Interfax]] |accessdate=10 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics from the scientific community state that no valuable information can be obtained until they can test clean samples of lake water, uncontaminated by drilling fluid.&lt;ref name="Lagnado" /&gt; Regardless of the contamination issues, in May 2013 the drilling facility at the Russian Vostok Antarctic station was declared a historic monument as "the result of the recognition of the achievements of the Russian research of Antarctica by the international scientific community, and of the unique operations on opening the subglacial Lake Vostok performed by Russian scientists on February 5, 2012."&lt;ref name="monument"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff |title=Drilling facilities that pried open Antarctic Lake Vostok becomes monument |date=15 January 2014 |url=http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2014_01_15/Drilling-facilities-that-pried-open-Antarctic-Lake-Vostok-becomes-monument-1233/ |work=The Voice of Russia, TASS |accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, the Russian press stated that Russian scientists have made a new "clean" borehole into Lake Vostok using a special 50-kilogram probe that collected about 1 liter of water not adulterated by the antifreezing fluid.&lt;ref name="New bore 2015"/&gt; It was predicted that the water would rise 30â40 m in the bottom part of the borehole, but in fact the water rose from the lake to a height of more than 500&amp;nbsp;m. In October of that same year, the work was suspended for that southern summer because of insufficient funding by the federal Russian government.&lt;ref name="MoscowTimes2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Staff |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russian-antarctic-expedition-halts-research-due-to-lack-of-funds/539033.html |title=Russian Antarctic Expedition Halts Research Due to Lack of Funds |work=The Moscow Times |location=Moscow |date=14 October 2015 |accessdate=2015-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/350/6260/494.summary Mysterious Antarctic lake will remain out of reach].

===Contamination due to drilling fluids===
The drilling project has been opposed by some [[Environmental movement|environmental groups]] and scientists who have argued that [[Ice drilling#Hot water and steam drills|hot-water drilling]] would have a more limited [[Environmental degradation|environmental impact]].&lt;ref name="Discovery News"&gt;{{cite news |first=E |last=Niiler |title=Antarctic Drilling Plan Raises Concerns |date=9 February 2011 |url=http://news.discovery.com/earth/lake-vostok-antarctica-environment-110209.html |work=Discovery News |accessdate=10 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main concern is that the lake could become contaminated with the antifreeze that the Russians used to keep the bore hole from refreezing. Scientists of the [[United States National Research Council]] have taken the position that it should be assumed that microbial life exists in Lake Vostok and that after such a long isolation, any life forms in the lake require strict protection from contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/materials-based-on-reports/reports-in-brief/subglacial_lakes_final.pdf |format=PDF |title=Exploration of Antarctic Subglacial |date=2007 |work=National Academy of Sciences |publisher=National Research Council |accessdate=9 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original drilling technique employed by the Russians involved the use of Freon and kerosene to lubricate the borehole and prevent it from collapsing and freezing over; {{convert|60|ST|MT|lk=on}} of these chemicals have been used thus far on the ice above Lake Vostok.&lt;ref name="Morton" /&gt; Other countries, particularly the United States and Britain, have failed to persuade the Russians not to pierce to the lake until cleaner technologies such as hot-water drilling are available.&lt;ref name="sydney"&gt;{{cite news |first=A |last=Darby |title=Antarctic Treaty no match for national pride |date=8 February 2011 |url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/conservation/antarctic-treaty-no-match-for-national-pride-20110209-1ameh.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=9 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Russians claim to have improved their operations, they continue to use the same borehole, which has already been contaminated with kerosene.&lt;ref name="ASOC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asoc.org/issues-and-advocacy/antarctic-environmental-protection/lake-vostok |title=Antarctica's Lake Vostok Controversy |date=2010 |publisher=[[Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition]] |accessdate=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the head of Russian Antarctic Expeditions, Valery Lukin, new equipment was developed by researchers at the [[Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute]] that would ensure the lake remains uncontaminated upon intrusion.&lt;ref name="January 2011" /&gt; Lukin has repeatedly reassured other signatory nations to the Antarctic Treaty System that the drilling will not affect the lake, arguing that on breakthrough, water will rush up the borehole, freeze, and seal the other fluids out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/102/10/1355.pdf |format=PDF |title=Drilling at Lake Vostok by the Russians |first=Jaimini |last=Sarkar |publisher= |date= |accessdate=28 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some environmentalist groups remain unconvinced by these arguments. The [[Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition]] has argued that this manner of drilling is a profoundly misguided step which endangers Lake Vostok and other subglacial lakes in Antarctica (which some scientists are convinced are inter-linked with Lake Vostok).&lt;ref name="appeal" /&gt; The coalition has asserted that "it would be far preferable to join with other countries to penetrate a smaller and more isolated lake before re-examining whether penetration of Lake Vostok is environmentally defensible. If we are wise, the Lake will be allowed to reveal its secrets in due course."&lt;ref name="appeal" /&gt;

Lukin claims that hot-water drilling is much more dangerous for the microbiotic fauna, as it would boil the living species, plus disturb the entire structure of water layers of the lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aif.ru/society/article/52592 |script-title=ru:ÐÐ·ÐµÑÐ¾ ÐÐ¾ÑÑÐ¾Ðº - "ÐºÑÑÐ¾ÑÐµÐº" ÐÐ°ÑÑÐ° Ð½Ð° ÐÐµÐ¼Ð»Ðµ? |language=Russian |trans-title= |last=ÐÐ°Ð½Ð¸Ð»ÐµÐ²Ð¸Ñ |first=ÐÐ»ÐµÐ½Ð° |publisher=[[Argumenty i Fakty]] |date=6 June 2012 |accessdate=25 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, hot-water drilling would have required more power than the Russian expedition could have generated at their remote camp.&lt;ref name="Discovery News" /&gt; However, the water samples obtained by the Russian team were heavily contaminated with drilling fluid, so they reported in May 2017 that it was impossible at this time to obtain reliable data on the real chemical and biological composition of the lake water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/early/2017/05/23/SP461.3 Chemical characteristics of the ice cores obtained after the first unsealing of subglacial Lake Vostok].

{{Refimprove|date = November 2014}}A '''line laser''' is a [[laser]] modified to project a line rather than a point (e.g. [[laser pointer]]).  This may be achieved by passing the beam through a [[cylindrical lens]] or a Powell lens.

Using multiple lasers, it is possible to project multiple lines for use with [[image processing]].  

Depending on the application, line lasers can generate lines, crosses or other patterns.  Civil engineering and interior design projects can use line lasers to measure the [[levelling]] of a small building site.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9092">The following '''list of countries by age structure''' sorts the countries of the world according to the age distribution of their [[population]]. The population is divided into three levels:

* Ages 0 to 14 years: [[children]] and [[Adolescence|adolescents]]

* Ages 15 to 64 years: [[Workforce|working population]] or population in education

* Over the age of 65: [[retirees]]

The age structure of a country has a strong impact on society and the economy. If the proportion of 0-14-year-olds is very high, there may be a so-called [[Youth Bulge]]. If, on the other hand, the proportion of over 65 is very high, the social systems of a country can be heavily burdened.

All numbers are for the year 2017. Source is the [[World Bank]].

{{Paleontology}}

This '''list of fossil sites''' is a worldwide list of localities known well for the presence of fossils. Some entries in this list are notable for a single, unique find, while others are notable for the large number of fossils found there. Many of the entries in this list are considered [[LagerstÃ¤tte]]n (sedimentary deposits that exhibits extraordinary fossils with exceptional preservationâsometimes including preserved soft tissues). LagerstÃ¤tten are indicated by a note (&lt;ref group=Note name=Lagerstaette/&gt;) in the noteworthiness column.

[[Fossil]]s may be found either associated with a [[geological formation]] or at a single geographic site. Geological formations consist of [[rock (geology)|rock]] that was deposited during a specific period of time. They usually extend for large areas, and sometimes there are different important sites in which the same formation is exposed. Such sites may have separate entries if they are considered to be more notable than the formation as a whole. In contrast, extensive formations associated with large areas may be equivalently represented at many locations. Such formations may be listed either without a site, with a site or sites that represents the type locality, or with multiple sites of note. When a type locality is listed as the site for a formation with many good outcrops, the site is flagged with a note (&lt;ref group=Note name=typelocality/&gt;). When a particular site of note is listed for an extensive fossil-bearing formation, but that site is somehow atypical, it is also flagged with a note (&lt;ref group=Note name=atypical/&gt;).

Many formations are for all practical purposes only studied at a single site, and may not even be named. For example, sites associated with [[hominin]], particularly caves, are frequently not identified with a named geologic formation. Therefore, some sites are listed without an associated formation.

==Exclaves and enclaves==

The municipalities of Liechtenstein, the ''{{lang|de|Gemeinden}}'', exhibit complex shapes, despite their small size.

Seven of the ''{{lang|de|Gemeinden}}'' have one or more [[exclave]]s, in addition to the main territory:

* Balzers: 2 exclaves
* Eschen: 1 exclave
* Gamprin: 1 exclave
* Planken: 4 exclaves, of which 1 is a true enclave
* Schaan: 4 exclaves, of which 1 is a true enclave
* Triesenberg: 1 exclave
* Vaduz: 6 exclaves, of which 2 are true enclaves

==Data codes==
In [[ISO 3166-2]], the [[ISO 3166-2:LI|codes of the municipalities]] start with LI-, followed by two digits (01â11, assigned in alphabetical order).

In [[FIPS 10-4]] (standard withdrawn in 2008), the [[List of FIPS region codes (J-L)#LS: Liechtenstein|codes of the municipalities]] started with LS-, followed by the same two digits as the ISO codes.

As a member of the [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]], Liechtenstein is included in the [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics]] (NUTS). The three NUTS levels all correspond to the country itself (NUTS-1: LI0; NUTS-2: LI00; NUTS-3: LI000). Below the NUTS levels, there are two [[local administrative unit|LAU]] levels (LAU-1: electoral districts; LAU-2: municipalities).

In the broad sense, the term may refer to the name of any inhabited place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icosweb.net/index.php/terminology.html International Council of Onomastic Sciences]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gornostay"&gt;Gornostay, Tatiana, &amp; Inguna SkadiÅa. 2009.

==Other terminology==
Sometimes the term ''ecodomonym'' is used to refer specifically to a building as an inhabited place.&lt;ref&gt;Zgusta, Ladislav. 1998. The Terminology of Name Studies. ''Names: A Journal of Onomastics'', 46(3) (September):189â203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Room"&gt;Room, Adrian. 1996. ''An Alphabetical Guide to the Language of Name Studies.'' Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|35}} Compare also the term ''mansionym'' to designate a historical residence (e.g., the [[Daniel Boone Homestead]]).&lt;ref name="Room"/&gt;{{rp|58}} Lay terms referring to the proper name of a house or other building include ''house name'' (either traditional or modern),&lt;ref&gt;Cromley, Elizabeth C. 1990. ''Alone Together: A History of New York's Early Apartments.'' Ithaca: Cornell University Press, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; ''farm name'' (referring to an entire farm), or ''property name'' (referring to a non-agricultural property).

Individuals may traditionally be referred to by their oeconyms rather than their surnames in Basque,&lt;ref&gt;Ott, Sandra. 1981. ''The Circle of Mountains: A Basque Shepherding Community.'' Reno: University of Nevada Press, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Finnish, Norwegian,&lt;ref&gt;Helleland, Botolv, &amp; Kjell Bondevik . 1975. ''Norske stedsnavn/stadnamn''.

In these cultures the name of the property is more or less fixed and may be used to refer to the people living there at any particular time, regardless of their actual surname or whether they recently purchased or moved to the property.&lt;ref name="Bas"/&gt;

==Examples of oeconyms==

{{expand section|date=April 2016}}

===German===
German oeconyms ({{lang-de|Hofname}}) were often adopted as surnames. Surnames with such origins are most common in [[Lower Saxony]] and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].&lt;ref&gt;Beidler, James M. 2014. ''The Family Tree German Genealogy Guide: How to Trace Your Germanic Ancestry.'' Cincinnati, OH: Family Tree Books, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Icelandic===
[[File:Lysuholl Iceland - road sign.jpg|thumb|150px|A road sign with oeconyms (''LÃ½suhÃ³ll, LÃ½sudalur'') in Iceland]]
Explicit reference is made to oeconyms (and their lack of correspondence with residents' names) in ''[[NjÃ¡ls saga]]'', a 13th-century Icelandic work describing events between 960 and 1020. For example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ãar eru Ã¾rÃ­r bÃ¦ir er Ã­ MÃ¶rk heita allir. Ã miÃ°bÃ¦num bjÃ³ sÃ¡ maÃ°ur er BjÃ¶rn hÃ©t og var kallaÃ°ur BjÃ¶rn hvÃ­ti.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sagadb.org/brennu-njals_saga#141 Icelandic Saga Database: Brennu-NjÃ¡ls saga.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;'There are three farms in that district, all called MÃ¶rk. At the middle farm lived a man named BjÃ¶rn [KaÃ°alsson], known as BjÃ¶rn the White.' (chapter 148)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In comparison to oeconyms in Norwegian and Faroese, in which the share of such names based on persons' names may be as low as 4 to 5%, in Icelandic approximately 32% of oeconyms are based on a personal name.&lt;ref&gt;Jesch, Judith. 2015. ''The Viking Diaspora''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1953, oeconyms have been enshrined in law, and Icelandic farms are required to have registered names approved by a special committee.&lt;ref&gt;Kvarad, GuÃ°rÃºn. 2005. Social Stratification in the Present-Day Nordic Languages IV: Icelandic. In: Oscar Bandle (ed.), ''The Nordic Languages'', pp. 1788â1793. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, p. 1793.&lt;/ref&gt; As travel by ship became more common in Iceland, the number of farms that had to be distinguished grew in number, and more complex compound names were created.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Jonathan, &amp; Katherine Holman. 2004. ''Scandinavia and Europe 800â1350: Contact, Conflict, and Coexistence''. Turnhout: Brepols, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; In compound Icelandic oeconyms, the single most common second element is ''-staÃ°ir'' 'place', although topographical suffixes (''-dalr'' 'valley', ''-nes'' 'headland', ''-fell'' 'hill', ''-eyrr'' 'bank') form the largest group of such elements.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmundsson, Svavar. 1998. Icelandic and Scottish Place-Names. In: W. F. H. Nicolaisen (ed.), ''Proceedings of the XIXth International Congress of Onomastic Sciences, Aberdeen, August 4â11, 1996: Scope, Perspectives and Methods of Onomastics'', vol. 1. pp. 330â342. Aberdeen: University of Aberdeen, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norwegian===
[[File:Gertrud Oldsdatter Nergaard.jpg|thumb|A Norwegian first name (''Gjertrud'') followed by a [[patronym]] (''Olsdatter'') and oeconym (''Nergaard'')]]
Norwegian oeconyms ({{lang-no|gÃ¥rdsnavn}}) are based on various factors associated with a property: local geography (hills, etc.), land use, vegetation, animals, characteristic activity, folk religion, and owners' nicknames. Such names in Norway were collected in the 19-volume collection ''[[Norske Gaardnavne]]'', published between 1897 and 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[https://snl.no/Norske_Gaardnavne  ''Store Norske Leksikon'': Norske Gaardnavne.]&lt;/ref&gt; Typical suffixes on such names include ''-bÃ¸'', ''-gaard/-gÃ¥rd'', ''-heim/-um'', ''-land'', ''-rud/-rÃ¸d'', and ''-set''. After the 1923 naming law ({{lang-no|Lov om personnavn}} or ''Navneloven'') was passed in Norway, many rural people adopted the names of the farms where they lived as surnames. These oeconyms were retained as surnames even after they moved away to towns or emigrated. It is estimated that 70% of surnames in Norway are based on oeconyms.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Nancy L., &amp; Olav Veka. 2010. ''A Handbook of Scandinavian Names''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional oeconym system was not retained among Norwegian emigrants to the United States, even in communities where Norwegian continued to be spoken. It has been suggested that this was because of cultural differences, whereby American farms were perceived as income sources rather than traditional family seats.&lt;ref&gt;Kruse, Arne. 1996. Scandinavian-American Place-Names as Viewed from the Old World. In: P. Sture Ureland et al. (eds.), ''Language Contact across the North Atlantic'', pp. 255â268. TÃ¼bingen: Max Niemeyer, pp. 262â263.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slovene oeconyms ({{lang-sl|hiÅ¡no ime}}) are generally based on microtoponyms (e.g., ''pri VrtaÄu'' 'sinkhole'); on names of animals (''pri Ovnu'' 'ram'), trees (''pri Gabru'' 'hornbeam'), and other plants (''pri ÄemaÅ¾arju'' 'ramsons') associated with a property; on activities traditionally associated with a property (''pri Sadjarju'' 'planting'); or on the name or nickname of the original property owner (''pri AnÄki'' 'Annie'). They may also refer to roles (formerly) played in the community (e.g., ''pri Å panu'' 'mayor'), the property's physical position (''pri Zgornjih'' 'upper') or age (''Stara Å¡ola'' 'old school'), professions (''pri Å½nidarju'' 'tailor'), personal qualities (''pri Bogatu'' 'rich'), or other noteworthy characteristics (e.g., ''pri Amerikanu'' 'immigrant returned from the United States').&lt;ref name="Bas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klinar, Klemen et al. 2012. ''Metode za zbiranje hiÅ¡nih in ledinskih imen''. Jesenice: Gornjesavski muzej Jesenice, pp. 52â53.&lt;/ref&gt; The properties are generally referred to with a locative phrase (e.g., ''pri Gabru'' 'at the Gaber farm'), and the residents are referred to with the base noun (e.g., ''Gaber'' 'the man from the Gaber farm'), a derived noun (''Gabrovka'' 'the woman from the Gaber farm'), or a preceding denominal adjective (''Gabrov JoÅ¾e'' 'JoÅ¾e from the Gaber farm', ''Gabrova Marija'' 'Marija from the Gaber farm'). A well-known Slovene example is the writer [[Lovro Kuhar]], better known by the pen name ''PreÅ¾ihov Voranc'' (literally, 'Voranc from the PreÅ¾ih farm').&lt;ref&gt;DruÅ¡koviÄ, Drago. 1993. Karantanski rod.  ''Srce in oko: obzornik PreÅ¡ernove druÅ¾be'' 45: 27â35, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mgl.si/assets/Uploads/GL-Samorastniki-low.pdf Hamer, Simona. 2015. Lovro Kuhar â PreÅ¾ihov Voranc. In: ''Samorastniki'' (program notes). Ljubljana: MGL, pp. 16â19.]&lt;/ref&gt; Slovene oeconyms often appear on gravestones as plural denominal adjectives (e.g., ''Gabrovi'' 'the ones from the Gaber farm'), sometimes without the surname being given at all.

'''Orography''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''ÏÏÎ¿Ï'', hill, ''Î³ÏÎ±ÏÎ¯Î±'', to write) is the study of the [[topographic relief]] of [[mountains]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Orography|short=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can more broadly include hills, and any part of a region's elevated terrain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=Orography&amp;submit=Search Orography] (from the [[American Meteorological Society]] website)&lt;/ref&gt; Orography (also known as ''oreography'', ''orology'' or ''oreology'') falls within the broader discipline of [[geomorphology]].&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Map of the Southern Half of Eastern Siberia and Parts of Mongolia, Manchuria, and Sakhalin: For a General Sketch of the Orography of Eastern Siberia|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/125/|publisher=World Digital Library|accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Mountain ranges and elevated land masses have a major impact on global climate. For instance, the elevated areas of East Africa substantially determines the strength of the [[Monsoons#Northern Indian Ocean Monsoon|Indian monsoon]].&lt;ref&gt;Srinivasan, J., Nanjundiah, Ravi S. and Chakraborty, Arindam (2005) [http://hdl.handle.net/2005/76 Impact of Orography on the Simulation of Monsoon Climate in a General Circulation Model] ''Indian Institute of Science''&lt;/ref&gt; In scientific models, such as [[general circulation model]]s, orography defines the lower boundary of the model over land.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

When a river's [[tributaries]] or settlements by the river are listed in 'orographic sequence', they are in order from the highest (nearest the source of the river) to the lowest or [[mainstem (hydrology)|mainstem]] (nearest the mouth).{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} This method of listing tributaries is similar to the [[Strahler Stream Order]], where the headwater tributaries are listed as category&amp;nbsp;1.

==Orographic precipitation==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2009}}
{{see also|Orographic lift}}
Orographic [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], also known as [[relief precipitation]], is precipitation generated by a forced upward movement of air upon encountering a physiographic upland (see [[anabatic wind]]). This lifting can be caused by two mechanisms:

# The upward deflection of large scale horizontal flow by the orography.
# The anabatic or upward vertical propagation of moist air up an orographic slope caused by daytime heating of the mountain barrier surface.

Upon ascent, the air that is being lifted will expand and cool. This [[adiabatic]] cooling of a rising moist air parcel may lower its temperature to its [[dew point]], thus allowing for condensation of the water vapor contained within it, and hence the formation of a [[cloud]]. If enough water vapor condenses into cloud droplets, these droplets may become large enough to fall to the ground as precipitation. In parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent [[wind]]s (for example the [[trade winds]]), a wetter climate prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward (downwind) side as moisture is removed by orographic precipitation. Drier air (see [[katabatic wind]]) is left on the descending, generally warming, leeward side where a [[rain shadow]] is formed.

[[Terrain|Terrain-induced]] precipitation is a major factor for [[meteorologists]] as they forecast the local weather. Orography can play a major role in the type, amount, intensity and duration of precipitation events. Researchers have discovered that barrier width, slope steepness and [[updraft]] speed are major contributors for the optimal amount and intensity of orographic precipitation. [[Computer model]] simulations for these factors showed that narrow barriers and steeper slopes produced stronger updraft speeds which, in turn, enhanced orographic precipitation.

Orographic precipitation is well known on oceanic [[island]]s, such as the [[Hawaiian Islands]] or [[New Zealand]], where much of the rainfall received on an island is on the windward side, and the [[leeward]] side tends to be quite dry, almost [[desert]]-like, by comparison. This phenomenon results in substantial local gradients of average rainfall, with coastal areas receiving on the order of {{convert|20|to|30|in|mm}} per year, and interior uplands receiving over {{convert|100|in|mm}} per year. Leeward coastal areas are especially dry&amp;mdash;less than {{convert|20|in|mm|abbr=on}} per year at [[Waikiki]]&amp;mdash;and the tops of moderately high uplands are especially wet&amp;mdash;about {{convert|475|in|mm|abbr=on}} per year at [[Wai'ale'ale]] on [[Kaua'i]].

Another well known area for orographic precipitation is the [[Pennines]] in the north of England where the west side of the Pennines receives more rain than the east because the clouds (generally arriving from the west) are forced up and over the hills and cause the rain to fall preferentially on the western slopes. This is particularly noticeable between [[Manchester]] (West) and [[Leeds]] (East) where Leeds receives less rain due to a rain shadow of 12 miles from the Pennines.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Sri Lanka:

'''[[Sri Lanka]]''' &amp;ndash; island country in the northern Indian Ocean off the southeast coast of the Indian subcontinent in South Asia. Known until 1972 as Ceylon (/sÉ¨ËlÉnË seÉª-Ë siË-/), Sri Lanka has maritime borders with India to the northwest and the Maldives to the southwest. Sri Lanka has a documented history that spans over 3,000 years, but there are theories to suggest that Sri Lanka had pre-historic human settlements dating back to at least 125,000 years. Its geographic location and deep harbours made it of great strategic importance from the time of the ancient Silk Road through to World War II. Sri Lanka is a republic and a unitary state governed by a presidential system. The capital, Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, is a suburb of the largest city, Colombo. It is also an important producer of tea, coffee, gemstones, coconuts, rubber, and the native cinnamon, the island contains tropical forests and diverse landscapes with a high amount of biodiversity.

'''Palliser's Triangle''', or the '''Palliser Triangle''', is a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] [[steppe]] occupying a substantial portion of the Western Canadian [[Prairie Provinces]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Alberta]] and [[Manitoba]], within the [[Great Plains]] region. While initially determined to be unsuitable for crops outside of the fertile belt due to arid conditions and dry climate, [[Expansionism|expansionists]] questioned this assessment, leading to [[homesteading]] in the Triangle. Agriculture in the region has since suffered from frequent [[drought]]s and other such hindrances.

== History ==
Before [[Colonialism|European interests and settlement]] expanded to the region, Palliser's Triangle was inhabited by a variety of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal peoples]], such as the [[Cree]], [[Sioux]], and the [[Blackfoot Confederacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://firstpeoplesofcanada.com/fp_groups/fp_plains1.html|title=The Plains People - Groups in this Region|website=firstpeoplesofcanada.com|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their lifestyle was centred around the [[American bison|buffalo]] hunt, as the bountiful herds of buffalo made this a sustainable and effective means of feeding themselves, the meat of which was used to make [[pemmican]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://firstpeoplesofcanada.com/fp_groups/fp_plains3.html|title=The Plains People - Food / Hunting / Tools|website=firstpeoplesofcanada.com|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1850s, however, the hunt had become an economic venture, their hides and meat sold by [[MÃ©tis in Canada|MÃ©tis]] and [[First Nations]] hunters to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC), and the increased demand led to a decline in herds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Clearing the Plains: Disease, Politics of Starvation and the Loss of Aboriginal Life|last=Daschuk|first=James|publisher=University of Regina Press|year=2013|isbn=9780889773400|location=|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 18th century, a large variety of factors contributed to an increase in Canadian expansionism, and eyes fell upon what would become western Canada for this purpose given that the cold and uncultivatable [[Canadian Shield]] was found in the north whereas the expanding [[United States]] controlled the south. This [[Manifest destiny|American expansionism]] also drove Canadian expansionist due to the fear that the United States would look north and lay claim to the land before they could. With this said, it became apparent that no sources existed that had a full and reliable assessment of the land. While the HBC had a working knowledge of the land inasmuch as it was useful to their end and business interests, it was insufficient to the needs of the Canadian government. In addition, the HBC was hesitant to share information about the land they controlled for the sake of protecting their [[monopoly]] in the region. Even the [[Royal Geographical Society]] was uninformed about the North West. All the above drove the United Kingdom and the Dominion of Canada to organize the [[Palliser expedition|Palliser]] and [[Henry Youle Hind|Hind]] expeditions, respectively,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; especially since the discovery in the 1840s that [[latitude]] alone did not determine [[climate]], which in turn suggested that good farmland may exist in the region.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://marcialalonde.weebly.com/uploads/9/3/8/2/9382401/hp_expeditions_reading.pdf|title=Hind and Palliser expeditions: 1857-1860|last=|first=|date=|website=Ms. Lalonde's Website|publisher=The Critical Thinking Cooperative|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area was named after [[John Palliser]], the leader of the aforementioned British Palliser expedition into Western Canada from 1857 to 1859.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/palliser_and_hind_expeditions.html The Encyclopedia Saskatchewan - The Palliser and Hind Expeditions]&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition had the objective of spending two or three seasons:

''1. In examining "the region along the Southern frontier of our territories, between the parallels of 49Â° and 53Â° north latitude, and from 100Â° to 115Â° west longitude" with a view to surveying "the watershed between the basins of the Missouri and the Saskachewan [sic]; also the course of the south branch of the Saskachewan and its tributaries; and... the actual line of the frontier, on the parallel of 49Â°";''

''2. In exploring "the Rocky Mountains, for the purpose of ascertaining the most southerly pass across to the Pacific, within the British Territory" since the well-known Athabasca Portage was too far north and "totally useless" for horses;''

''3. In reporting on "the natural features and general capabilities of the country" and mapping it. The R.G.S. also advised that scientific assistants should accompany Palliser.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;''

The expeditions came to the conclusion that what would become western Canada was divided into three regions: a northern [[Taiga|cold zone]] that was inhospitable to agriculture, Palliser's Triangle towards the south&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; which Palliser characterized as an extension of the American Great Plains which he described as being "a more or less arid" desert and thus unsuitable for crops&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; albeit acceptable for livestock given the âdry climate, sandy soil, and extensive grass cover,"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdm.ca/skteacherguide/WDMResearch/SkWeather_Climate_Soils.pdf|title=The story of Palliser's Triangle, the structure of Saskatchewan soils, the reality of Saskatchewan weather|last=McInnise|first=Amy|date=May 2004|website=Western Development Museum|pages=3, 6|access-date=March 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aspen parkland|a rich fertile belt]] in the middle that was ideally suited to agriculture and settlement,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the existence of which was confirmed by both Palliser, and Henry Youle Hind, of Hind Expedition fame. They both argued against settling within the arid body of the Triangle. This changed perceptions of the region: previously seen as untamed wilderness, the British Canadian public began to see potential farmland in the Triangle.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Prairie West as Promised Land|last=Owram|first=Doug|publisher=University of Calgary Press|year=2007|isbn=1552382303|location=Calgary, Alberta|pages=7â16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spry|first=Irene M.|date=June 1959|title=Captain John Palliser and the Exploration of Western Canada|jstor=1790499|journal=The Geographical Journal|volume=125|pages=151â156, 167}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prospect of an ample supply of fertile land lit a fire under Canadian expansionists, and the Canadian government started to buy up HBC land in the region as they were under pressure to ensure that it would be Canadians who settled the North West, not Americans. This began with the purchase of [[Rupert's Land]] for Â£300,000. This wellspring of expansionism came with the idea of a "Canadian Empire" of which the North West was a part of, in defiance of the idea that these lands were those of the [[First Nations]] and [[MÃ©tis in Canada|MÃ©tis]] who inhabited them at the time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In this period of expansionism, one prominent figure advocating homesteading in the North West was botanist [[John Macoun]]. He undertook expeditions alongside Sir [[Sanford Fleming]] in the 1880s during which he had the chance to look at the ostensibly uncultivatable Palliser's Triangle. It turns out that Palliser saw the region in a state of drought during which ample buffalo herds were grazing the grass shorter. He also bore witness to a number of grass fires, all of which gave the impression of an inhospitable desert. Macoun, on the other hand, found the region in a major wet period after a severe decline in animal life in no small part due to the overhunting of bison. This skewed his perspective to the exact opposite of Palliser's assessment: where Palliser could be said to have underestimated the agricultural capacity of the Triangle, Macoun could be said to have overestimated it, as evidenced by both the region's production and its frequent and sometimes devastating droughts.

With Macoun's assessment in hand, the Canadian government undertook an advertising campaign to encourage European immigration to western Canada,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://manitobamuseum.ca/main/john-macoun-the-botanist-who-changed-the-map-of-western-canada/|title=John Macoun: The Botanist Who Changed the Map of Western Canada {{!}} The Manitoba Museum|website=manitobamuseum.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was joined by the distribution of 160-acre tracts of farmland for a token fee of ten dollars under the [[Dominion Lands Act]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Canadian Prairies: A History|last=Friesen|first=Gerald|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1987|isbn=978-0-8020-6648-0|location=Toronto, Ontario|pages=179â183, 302, 314â320}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the planned Canadian Pacific Railway was moved southwards from its original route through the Parklands to instead pass through Palliser's Triangle for the sake of facilitating homesteading and grain shipment, thus further encouraging settlement in the region. Were it not for this fact, it is very likely that cities such as [[Calgary]], [[Brandon, Manitoba|Brandon]] and [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] would not exist as they do today.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Many farmers who did settle in the semi-arid portion of the Triangle between the period of the expedition and 1914 saw success, especially as the demand for wheat was driven up by the outbreak of the [[First World War]], though many others were forced to partake in wage labour as hired farmhands, members of itinerant [[threshing]] crews, or manual labour for road and rail construction companies, logging camps and mining towns, to continue sustaining their farms. Furthermore, the influx of agricultural technology on larger farms that came with the wartime boon such as [[tractor]]s, [[Combine harvester|combines]] and [[truck]]s all cut labour requirements on larger farms and increased the capital needed to establish oneself as a farmer, further hampering smaller farms. The loss of employment opportunities was further compounded in the 1930s as the government completed rail and road projects, in addition to the cutting of government work budgets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the [[Great Depression in Canada|Great Depression]] the Triangle, like much of the Canadian and American Prairies, was struck by the [[Dust Bowl]] in the 1930s. This was caused, in large part, by a decrease in precipitation as well as longstanding flawed farming practices that exacerbated [[Aeolian processes#Wind erosion|aeolian soil erosion]] and dust storm activity. This includes the practice of leaving fields fallow, seen as necessary at the time to support agriculture in the given climate, as it was believed that exposed soil would better absorb and retain moisture. Measures undertaken in Alberta and Saskatchewan have since alleviated many of these issues. The Alberta government had the [[Special Areas Board]] buy up as much drought-afflicted farmland as possible to convert to grazing land, 2.1 million hectares of which it still administers. Both provincial governments subsidized the relocation of farmers willing to leave their farms in the drought-stricken regions, and the federal government established the [[Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration]] in 1935, an organization that expanded on government research into soil erosion, carried out soil surveys, encouraged farmers to adopt soil conservation measures and new farming practices, and established [[shelterbelts]] and community pastures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McLeman RA, Dupre J, Berrang Ford L, Ford J, Gajewski K, Marchildon G | title = What we learned from the Dust Bowl: lessons in science, policy, and adaptation | journal = Population and Environment | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 417â440 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24829518 | pmc = 4015056 | doi = 10.1007/s11111-013-0190-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern agriculture==
This area was and is still very productive in terms of both [[produce]] and [[livestock]]. Alberta and Saskatchewan are currently the provinces with the second and third most farms, respectively, only being surpassed in this respect by Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/agriculture/|title=CBC News Indepth: Agriculture|date=2009-01-24|access-date=2018-03-08|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124055640/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/agriculture/|archivedate=2009-01-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is despite the fact that Palliser's Triangle, which occupies much of the southern portions of both of these provinces, has had consistent issues with droughts, almost every decade being marked by at least one dry year,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nkemdirim|first=Lawrence|last2=Weber|first2=Lena|date=August 1999|title=Comparison between the Droughts of the 1930s and the 1980s in the Southern Prairies of Canada|url=https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0442%281999%29012%3C2434%3ACBTDOT%3E2.0.CO%3B2|journal=Journal of Climate|volume=1999|issue=8|pages=2434|via=American Meteorological Society|doi=10.1175/1520-0442(1999)012&lt;2434:CBTDOT&gt;2.0.CO;2|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; in no small part due to the [[orographic lift]] caused by the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]], the [[Coast Mountains]], the [[Cascade Range]] and the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada Range]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pfra.ca/doc/Drought/Drought%20in%20the%20Palliser%20Triangle_1998.pdf|title=Drought in the Palliser Triangle (A Provisional Primer)|last=Nemanishen|first=Walter|date=January 1998|website=Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration|page=1|access-date=March 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has much to do with efforts to maintain sustained agricultural practices such as [[Agricultural diversification|crop diversification]] and [[conservation tillage]] which have softened the blow of complications that could have otherwise had far more severe effects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Saskatchewan is currently the province with the largest amount of farmland, and the leading crops are [[canola]], [[spring wheat]] and [[lentil]]s. Cattle are also a major player in the farming economy, given that Saskatchewan has the second highest number of cattle of all the Canadian provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/95-640-x/2016001/article/14807-eng.htm|title=Saskatchewan remains the breadbasket of Canada|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|website=www.statcan.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reverse is true in Alberta, which has the second largest total farmland and the highest number of cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/95-640-x/2016001/article/14808-eng.htm|title=Alberta has the most beef cattle in Canada and the second largest total farm area|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|website=www.statcan.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Western Canadian agriculture is noticeably focused in the Palliser's Triangle region, demonstrating that agriculture in the area has persisted in spite of the dry climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/95-634-x/2017001/article/54904/catm-ctra-039-eng.htm|title=Crops - Hay and field crops|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|website=www.statcan.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/95-634-x/2017001/article/54903/catm-ctra-231-eng.htm|title=Land use, land tenure and management practices|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|website=www.statcan.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this in mind, it could be said that Macoun was, to some extent, right. Despite the frequent and sometimes disastrous droughts, the Triangle did become and still is the metaphorical breadbasket of the nation as he expected. However, the region has also suffered a major loss in terms of biodiversity over the course of settlement. Canada as a whole has found itself with under 20% of its mixed grass prairies, under 5% of its fescue prairies, and less than a half-percent of its tall grass prairies. In addition, the prairies have a very high rate of endangered species.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5758">'''Peveril Meigs, III,''' (May 5, 1903 â September 16, 1979) was an American geographer, notable for his studies of arid lands on several continents and in particular for his work on the native peoples and early missions of northern [[Baja California]], Mexico.

Meigs was born in [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]] in New York City. He studied at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], receiving his B.A. degree in 1925 and a Ph.D. in 1932. He held academic positions at [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State Teachers College]] (1929), [[California State University, Chico|Chico State College]] (1929-1942), [[Louisiana State University]] (1938-1939), [[American University]] (1948), and [[George Washington University]] (1948).

Beginning during World War II, Meigs was employed primarily by the U.S. government, working for the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) (1942-1944), Joint Intelligence Study Publishing Board (1944-1947), Earth Sciences Division of the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps (1949-1953), and Quartermaster Research and Engineering Center (1953-1965). In the red scare of the early 1950s, Meigs was prominent among those listed as security risks by Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]].&lt;ref&gt;Perrin Selcer, 2011, ''Patterns of Science: Developing Knowledge for a World Community at Unesco,'' Ph.D dissertation, University of Pennsylvania&lt;/ref&gt;

Meigs published dozens of articles and books. Particularly notable was his early work on Baja California, which was influenced by his Berkeley mentors, [[Carl O. Sauer]] in historical geography and [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] in ethnography.&lt;ref&gt;Don Laylander, 2016, "The Berkeley Geographers and Baja Californiaâs Prehistory," ''Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology'' 36(1):126-137&lt;/ref&gt;

He co-authored with Sauer a study of [[MisiÃ³n San Fernando Rey de EspaÃ±a de VelicatÃ¡|Mission San Fernando VelicatÃ¡]], the only mission founded by the Franciscans during their brief tenure (1768-1773) on the peninsula. Meigs' doctoral dissertation (1932) was a groundbreaking study of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] missions of northwestern Baja California. It was subsequently published and remains the key source on the subject.

During his field trips to northern Baja California, particularly in 1928, 1929, and 1936, Meigs became familiar with the region's surviving Indian groups. He published a monograph on the [[Kiliwa]] (1939) that continues to be the most reliable source concerning the aboriginal lifeways of that people. Also included were important notes on the neighboring [[Paipai]] and [[Kumeyaay]]. After his retirement in 1965, Meigs published several additional articles on the ethnography and archaeology of these groups, based on his notes from his earlier field studies.  He also mapped [[tide mill]]s along the Atlantic coast of the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Peveril Meigs, "Historical geography of tide mills on the Atlantic coast," ''American Philosophical Society Yearbook 1970'' (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: American Philosophical Society, 1971) pages 462-464.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peveril Meigs, "Tide mills on the Atlantic," ''Old Mill News'', issue 7 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roadworks''' (called '''road work''' or '''road construction''' in the United States) occur when part of the [[road]], or in rare cases, the entire road, has to be occupied for work relating to the road, most often in the case of road surface repairs. In the United States road work could also mean any work conducted in close proximity of travel way ([[thoroughfare]]) such as utility work or work on power lines (i.e. telephone poles). The general term of road work is known as work zone.

Roadworks can, however, also happen when a major [[Traffic collision|accident]] occurs and [[road debris]] from the crash needs to be cleared.
[[File:Zeichen 123 - Baustelle, StVO 1992.svg|thumb|left|German roadworks sign. In other European countries, the signs are similar.
]]
[[File:Road work.png|thumb|left|A typical MUTCD sign]]
Roadworks are often signposted, although it is possible that the signage comes too late or too sudden or is missing.
Typical road work traffic controls are temporary signs, [[traffic cone]]s, [[barrier board]]s and t-top [[bollard]]s as well as other forms of warning devices. There are standards of temporary traffic control ([[maintenance of traffic]]) established in each country for various type of road work.

In some countries, where lanes must be altered so as to accommodate roadworks, the new lanes (or interim lanes) are marked with a different colour and take precedence over the previous lanes. In Germany, Poland and many other European countries, it is yellow; in Switzerland and in Ireland, it is orange.

Roadworks are frequently carried out throughout the night so as to minimize traffic disruption.

Currently there are very few sources of accurate roadworks information sites available that report on the status of current works and future works.  In the UK the [http://roadworks.org Roadworks.org] website, an initiative run by [https://web.archive.org/web/20120223152111/http://www.elgin.gov.uk/ ELGIN], aims to provide a national and live dataset of roadworks for the purpose of coordination and reporting. It includes roadworks information supplied by [[Local government in the United Kingdom|Local Authorities]] and national agencies like the [[Highways Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roadworks.org|url=http://www.roadworks.org/|accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sierra Madre Occidental''' is a major [[mountain range]] system of the [[North American Cordillera]], that runs northwestâsoutheast through Northwestern and Western Mexico, and along the [[Gulf of California]].  The Sierra Madre is part of the [[American Cordillera]], a chain of mountain ranges (cordillera) that consists of an almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges that form the western "backbone" of [[North America]], [[Central America]], [[South America]] and [[Antarctica]].

==Etymology==
The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] name ''sierra madre'' means "mother mountains" and ''occidental'' means "western" in English, with these being the "Western Mother Mountains".&lt;ref name = "Phillips2010"&gt;{{cite web|title = Archaeology and prehistory of Northwest Mexico|last = Phillips|first = David|year = 2010|url = http://www.unm.edu/~dap/nwm/setting.html|accessdate = 21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the east, from the Spanish ''oriental'' meaning "eastern" in English, the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] range or "Eastern Mother Mountains" run generally parallel to the Sierra Madre Occidental along eastern Mexico and the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

The range extends from northern [[Sonora]] state near the [[Mexico-U.S. border]] at [[Arizona]], southeastwards to the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]] and [[Sierra Madre del Sur]] ranges. The high [[plateau]] that is formed by the range is cut by deep river valleys. This plateau is formed from volcanic rock overlying a basement of metamorphic rock.

This uplift has caused changes in weather patterns; increased rainfall occurring in the mountains has provided areas where ecosystems can form in wetter areas than surrounding land. This water source forms watersheds that provide the arid surroundings with water that makes it possible to irrigate and farm crops. The wet ecosystems are islands of biodiversity, differing significantly from what would otherwise be a desert landscape. Oak forests are the predominant plant life and extend into the lowland deserts.

This forest and canyon land provided a place for a variety of [[indigenous people]] to live, until [[New Spain|Spanish settlers]] with associated [[Mestizo]]s came into the area to found towns for the [[Silver mining|silver mines]] in the area. The major industries in the area now are [[agriculture]] and forestry, which have become contentious because of [[land degradation]] and the native population's opposition to these practices.

==Geography==

The range trends from the north to southeast. [[Canyon]]s cut by the rivers of the wet western slopes exist in addition to those of the northeast slopes, notably the [[Copper Canyon]].

===Location===
The range runs parallel to the Pacific coast of Mexico, from just south of the Arizona-Sonora border southeast through eastern [[Sonora]], western [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Sinaloa]], [[Durango]], [[Zacatecas]], [[Nayarit]], [[Jalisco]], [[Aguascalientes]] to [[Guanajuato]], where it joins with the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]] and the [[Eje VolcÃ¡nico Transversal]] (Transverse Volcanic Axis) of central Mexico after crossing {{convert|1250|km|mi|abbr = on}}.&lt;ref name="Centres of Plant Diversity"&gt;{{cite web | title = Mexico Regional Overview | last = Toledo | first = Victor | url = http://botany.si.edu/projects/cpd/ma/mamexico.htm | accessdate = 16 March 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120415101003/http://botany.si.edu/projects/cpd/ma/mamexico.htm | archivedate = 15 April 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mountains range from {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr = on}} from the [[Gulf of California]] in the north, but begin to approach within {{cvt|50|km|mi|round=5}} of the [[Pacific]] in the south.&lt;ref name = "Topography and Drainage"&gt;{{cite web | title = Topography and Drainage | url = http://countrystudies.us/mexico/48.htm  | accessdate =16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mountains are generally considered to be part of the much larger [[American cordillera]], the mountains extending from [[Alaska]] down to these across Western North America.&lt;ref name="Ferrari"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Ferrari |first1=Luca |last2=Valencia-Moreno |first2=MartÃ­n |last3=Bryan |first3=Scott |year=2007 |chapter=Magmatism and tectonics of the Sierra Madre Occidental and its relation with the evolution of the western margin of North America |series=Special Paper 422 |title=Geology of MÃ©xico: Celebrating the Centenary of the Geological Society of MÃ©xico |location=Boulder, Colorado |publisher=The Geological Society of America |pages=1â39 |isbn=978-0-8137-2422-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQdlV8dal1UC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HildebrandKTOro"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hildebrand | first = Robert |year=2009 | title = Did westward subduction cause Cretaceous â Tertiary orogeny in the North American Cordillera |series=Special Paper 457 |location=Boulder, Colorado |publisher=The Geological Society of America |page=54 |isbn=978-0-8137-2457-7 | url = http://dandelion-patch.mit.edu/afs/athena.mit.edu/course/12/12.115/OldFiles/www/12.114%20Papers/HILDEBRAND_GSA_SP_FINAL_WHOLE.pdf }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regions===
The Sierra Tarahumara or Tarahumara range is the name for the region of the Sierra Madre beginning at the Durango border and extending north. This name comes from the Tarahumara natives.&lt;ref name = "Gajdusek1953"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Sierra Tarahumara|last = Gajdusek|journal = Geographical Review|volume = 43|issue = 1|date = January 1953|jstor = 211536}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a dramatic landscape of steep mountains formed by a high plateau that has been cut through with canyons including [[Copper Canyon]], larger and, in places, deeper than the [[Grand Canyon]].&lt;ref name = "WildInqCopCan"&gt;{{cite web | title = Mexico's Copper Canyon | year = 2012 | url = http://www.wildernessinquiry.org/destinations/index.php?dest=coppercanyon  | accessdate =15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plateau has an average elevation of {{convert|2250|m|ft|abbr = on}} with most of the more eroded canyons on the western slope, due to the higher moisture content.&lt;ref name = "Centres of Plant Diversity"/&gt;

The mountains act as a [[Water supply|source of water]], in an otherwise [[arid]] environment from the increased precipitation from the mountain range. As such, rivers that have headwaters in the mountains provide water for [[irrigation]] in the surrounding lands. The need for water to irrigate prompted the construction of dams, which has been the source of several environmental concerns in  the area.

As the northern end of the mountains are more arid, the [[Yaqui River]], which drains that area is an important source of irrigation in the state of Sonora.&lt;ref name = "Adams2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Evaluating Increased Groundwater Use in the Yaqui Valley, Mexico | last = Addams | first = Lee | journal = Southwest Hydrology| year = 2005 | url = http://yaquivalley.stanford.edu/pdf/Evaluating%20GW%20Use%20in%20Yaqui%20(Addams%202005).pdf | accessdate =17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yaqui drains into the [[Gulf of California]] as do the [[Humaya River]] in Sinaloa and the [[Fuerte River]] further south.&lt;ref name = "Benke2005"&gt;{{cite book | title = Rivers of North America | last = Benke | first = Arthur | last2 = Cushing | first2 = Colbert | year = 2005 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=faOU1wkiYFIC&amp;pg=PA1036|isbn=978-0-08-045418-4|publisher=Academic Press|page=1036}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[RÃ­o Grande de Santiago]] drains {{cvt|100000|km2||}} from the southern slopes of the Sierra Madre.&lt;ref name="Cisneros2011"&gt;{{cite web | title = Provenance and Origin of Holocene Beach Ridge and Modern Beach Sands from the Costa de Nayarit, Western Mexico | last1 = Cisneros | first1 = Ruben | year = 2011 | url = http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04262011-150353/unrestricted/Ruben_Cisneros_THESIS_FINAL_DRAFT_GRAD_SCHOOL.pdf | accessdate = 15 March 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150920151737/http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04262011-150353/unrestricted/Ruben_Cisneros_THESIS_FINAL_DRAFT_GRAD_SCHOOL.pdf | archivedate = 20 September 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the more arid eastern slopes of the mountains, the [[Nazas River]] and [[Aguanaval River]] drain the mountains into a closed basin.&lt;ref name = "Gutierrez2005"&gt;{{cite book | title = Hydroclimatic variability of the upper Nazas basin: Water management implications for the irrigated area of the Comarca Lagunera, Mexico | last = Gutierrez-Garcia | last2 = Villanueve-Diaz | last3 = Stahle | last4 = Therrell | last5 = Cleaveland | last6 = Estrada-Avalos | last7 = Jasso-Ibarra | year = 2005 | url = https://unam.academia.edu/GenaroGutierrez/Papers/1066647/Hydroclimatic_variability_of_the_upper_Nazas_basin_Water_management_implications_for_the_irrigated_area_of_the_Comarca_Lagunera_Mexico | accessdate =19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mountains supply 90% of the water used for irrigation within the watershed.&lt;ref name = "Gonzales-Barrios2002" /&gt; North of this system is the [[Conchos River]] which drains into the [[Rio Grande]].&lt;ref name = "Benke2005"/&gt;

The Sierra Madre Occidental is a high plateau of volcanic rock that is eroded in areas to reveal a basement composed of [[plutonic]] and [[sedimentary]] rocks underlying the two groups of [[extrusive]] volcanics.&lt;ref name="BroncoGold"&gt;{{cite web | title = Geology | publisher = Bronco Gold and Silver | url = http://broncogold.com/geology.html | accessdate = 15 March 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120714155337/http://broncogold.com/geology.html | archivedate = 14 July 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower of these groups is a series of volcanic rocks formed by [[Lava|lava flows]]. The surface of the plateau is made up of a second series of volcanic [[ignimbrite]]s, covered mostly by clay rich organic [[soil]]s. Some [[intrusion]]s in the area have deposited [[ore]] veins that are commercially viable.

The landscape was shaped after rock placement. Rivers [[Erosion#Rivers and streams|cut]] valleys into the plateau, following [[Fold (geology)|folds]] in the rocks. Rock have been broken off of the slopes, forming rocky sides. The bedrock is covered by the clay rich soils, except in eroded areas, where water carries away deposits leaving a stony surface.

During the [[Miocene]], three periods of volcanism marked separate events in the Sierras. Each period is marked by different volcanic processes.&lt;ref name = NietoSam1999&gt;{{cite journal|title = Variation of Cenozoic Extension and Volcanism across the Southern Sierra Madre Occidental Volcanic Province, Mexico|last=Nieto-Samaniego|first=Ãngel|last2=Ferrari|first2=Luca|last3=Alaniz-Alvarez|first3=Susana|last4=Labarthe-HenÃ¡ndez|first4=Guillermo|last5=Rosas-Elguera|first5=JosÃ©|journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin|year=1999|volume=111|issue=3|pages=347â363|url=http://gsabulletin.gsapubs.org/content/111/3/347.full.pdf|accessdate=17 February 2013|doi = 10.1130/0016-7606(1999)111&lt;0347:VOCEAV&gt;2.3.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first was a continuation of the Oligocene flare-up, which lasted through the early Miocene.

===Structures===
The Sierras are believed to be a thick core covered by volcanics and eroded by numerous rivers. Some have suggested that the basement of the mountains have numerous intrusions made by mafic magma.&lt;ref name = "Ferrari2007"/&gt;  The mountains are made up at the surface of large-scale ignimbrite sheet which have been incised by rivers flowing from rainfall in the mountains.&lt;ref name = "Montgomery2001"&gt;{{ Cite journal | title = Post-Oligocene river incision, Southern Sierra Madre Occidental | last = Montgomery | first = David | last2 = Lopez-Blanco | first2 = Jorge | year = 2003 | url = http://gis.ess.washington.edu/grg/publications/pdfs/Mexico_paper.pdf | accessdate =20 March 2012|journal=Geomorphology |volume=55 |issue=1â4|pages= 235â247 | doi = 10.1016/S0169-555X(03)00142-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hawley1969"&gt;{{Cite conference |conference= 20th Field Conference, New Mexico Geological Society |title= Notes on the Geomorphology and Late Cenozoic Geology of Northwestern Chihuahua | last = Hawley | first = John | year = 1969 | url = http://nmgs.nmt.edu/publications/guidebooks/downloads/20/20_p0131_p0142.pdf | accessdate =20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surface of the plateau is almost exclusively from the second series of flows causing the rock that is most visible to be ignimbrites with lava flow layers.&lt;ref name = "McDowell1981"/&gt; The region has a general [[Strike and dip|strike]] from just west of north to just south of east.&lt;ref name = "Hawley1969"/&gt;

[[Fault (geology)|Faults]] in the area tend to be younger than the upper volcanics, excluding those associated with calderas,&lt;ref name = "McDowell1981"/&gt; but do occur in distinct periods.&lt;ref name = "Swanson2006"/&gt; The large faults along the eastern slope&lt;ref name = "McDowell1981"/&gt; have caused the slope to be made up of large [[escarpment]]s that face into the interior [[Structural basin|basins]].&lt;ref name = "Hawley1969"/&gt; These faults are commonly covered by [[alluvium]] and [[basalt]], making them difficult to discern, but can be found in certain [[fault block]]s.&lt;ref name = "McDowell1981"/&gt;

[[Graben]]s have formed in the north, and some of these are filled with volcanic and sedimentary floors,&lt;ref name = "Ferrari1999"/&gt; and long [[Depression (geology)|depressions]] have formed in the southern Sierra Madre.&lt;ref name = "Aguirre2003"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Fissure ignimbrites: Fissure-source origin for voluminous ignimbrites of the Sierra Madre Occidental and its relationship with Basin and Range faulting | last = Aguirre-Diaz | first = Gerardo | last2 = Labarthe-Hernandez | first2 = Guillermo | journal = Geology | volume = 31 | issue = 9 | pages = 773â776 | doi=10.1130/G19665.1|year = 2003 | bibcode = 2003Geo....31..773A }}&lt;/ref&gt; The faulting decreases in the center of the range where the faults are mostly small [[Dip-slip faults|normal faults]], but increases once again on the western slope.&lt;ref name = "McDowell1981"/&gt; In fact, the major normal faults tend to diverge around the center of the core and join at either end.&lt;ref name = "Swanson2006"/&gt; Some of these faults may have allowed ignimbrites to [[Fissure vent|erupt]] from the surface, and so there may be some association between the ignimbrite occurrence and faults;&lt;ref name = "Aguirre2003"/&gt; this can be used to find out [[Structural geology|information]] about different kinds of basement rock present.&lt;ref name = "Ferrari2007"/&gt;

There are two faults dividing the Sierra Madre from the central [[Mexican Plateau]]. The more southern one is the northâsouth Aguascalientes fault extending {{convert|150|km|mi}} from Altos de Jalisco to near Zacatecas, where it joins the more northern northwestâsoutheast trending San LuisâTepehuanes fault extending from Guanajuato to Durango.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Mesa Central of MÃ©xico: Stratigraphy, structure, and Cenozoic tectonic evolution|last = Nieto-Samaniego|first = Angel|last2 = Alaniz-Ãlvarez|first2 = Susana|last3 = Camprubi|first3 = Antoni|year = 2007|url = http://www.geociencias.unam.mx/~afns/index_files/Nieto-SamaniegoEtAl_MesaCentral_SPE422_02.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The southern boundary of the Sierra Madre Occidental with the Jalisco block is a series of folds, [[Thrust fault|thrust]], and left [[Strike-slip fault|lateral]] faults date from the middle Miocene.

At the west end of these grabens and half-grabens are the Pochotitan and the more northerly San Pedro fault systems, which form the western boundary of the faults in the southern mountains.&lt;ref name = "Ferrari2002"/&gt; In the north there is an unknown boundary between the Cortes Terrane and the Guerrero Composite Terrane. Some theorize that this is a section of the MojaveâSonora Megashear, but this theory is not universally accepted; however, the Megashear is important, and, in fact, is necessary for [[Historical Geology|reconstructions]] of the opening of the Gulf of California, as of 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Structure and kinematics along a segment of the Mojave-Sonora megashear: A strike-slip fault that truncates the Jurassic continental magmatic arc of southwestern North America|last = Campbell|first = Patricia|last2 = Anderson|first2 = Thomas|journal = Tectonics|volume = 22|issue = 7|year = 2003|url = http://www.agu.org/journals/tc/tc0306/2002TC001367/|doi = 10.1029/2002TC001367|pages = n/a|bibcode=2003Tecto..22.1077C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mineral deposits===
On a smaller scale, mineral deposits are distributed in formations of the Sierra Madre, although the [[Ore genesis|events]] that placed these deposits vary throughout the mountains. The Guerrero composite terrane contains many of the economic deposits, often found in ore bodies younger than the Cretaceous.&lt;ref name="Potra2011" /&gt;

Gold and silver deposits most commonly occur in the altered andesites of the early volcanics,&lt;ref name = "McDowell1981"/&gt; typically these deposits are between 30 and 50 million years old.&lt;ref name = "Clark1982"&gt;{{cite journal| title = Cenozoic mineral deposits and subduction-related magmatic arcs in Mexico| last = Damon|first = Paul|journal = GSA Bulletin| volume = 93|pages = 533â544|date = June 1982|url = http://bulletin.geoscienceworld.org/content/93/6/533.full.pdf| doi = 10.1130/0016-7606(1982)93&lt;533:CMDASM&gt;2.0.CO;2| last2 = Foster| first2 = C.

Fissure-vein deposits have been divided into two groups of [[Fracture (geology)|fissure]] [[Vein (geology)|vein]] deposits, which are divided geographically into an eastern and western series.&lt;ref name = "Clark1982"/&gt; In the east, the gold and silver are accompanied by [[lead]] and [[zinc]].  In the south, the [[BolaÃ±os Municipality|BolaÃ±os]] mine district is contained with the BolaÃ±os Graben.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Geology, Tectonic Environment, and Structural Controls in the San Martin de Bolafios District, Jalisco, Mexico|last = Scheubel|first = Frank|last2 = Clark|first2 = Kenneth|last3 = Porter|first3 = Elise|journal = Economic Geology|volume = 83|issue = 8|pages = 1703â1720|year = 1988|url = http://econgeol.geoscienceworld.org/content/83/8/1703.short|accessdate = 23 October 2012|doi = 10.2113/gsecongeo.83.8.1703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some also occur as epithermal deposits. Also, some gold occurs along with [[copper]] in Cenozoic iron-oxide [[Skarn#Ore deposits|skarn]] and replacement deposits along the Pacific.&lt;ref name="Potra2011"/&gt;

In addition to gold and silver and their related deposits, [[tin]], [[iron]], and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] occur, sometimes in later units,&lt;ref name = "Clark1982"/&gt; mostly in later volcanics, and [[Molybdenum]] occurs in the mountains, often along with older copper deposits&lt;ref name = "McDowell1981"/&gt; or in oligocene deposits in the east.&lt;ref name = "Clark1982"/&gt; The belt of tin deposits resides mostly within the eastern slopes from Durango to Guanajuato.&lt;ref name = "Clark1982"/&gt; In these areas, tin occurs in rhyolitic ignimbrites in many, possibly over 1000,&lt;ref name = "Huspeni1984"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Petrology and geochemistry of rhyolites associated with tin mineralization in northern Mexico|last = Huspeni|first = Jeffrey|last2 = Kesler|first2 = Stephen|last3 = Ruiz|first3 = Joaquin|last4 = Tuta|first4 = Zane|last5 = Sutter|first5 = John|last6 = Jones|first6 = Lois|journal = Economic Geology|volume = 79|issue = 1|year = 1984|pages = 87â105|url = http://econgeol.geoscienceworld.org/content/79/1/87.short|doi = 10.2113/gsecongeo.79.1.87}}&lt;/ref&gt; small deposits&lt;ref name = "McDowell1981"/&gt; of [[cassiterite]].

Along the Pacific there the numerous skarn and replacement deposits mentioned above with relation to gold.&lt;ref name = "Clark1982"/&gt; Iron occurs in Durango in the form of [[magnetite]] lava flows, which are often surrounded by smaller [[hematite]] deposits, thought to be ash flows.&lt;ref name = "McDowell1981"/&gt; There is also a belt of iron deposits further east.&lt;ref name = "Clark1982"/&gt;

===Soil===
Most soil in the mountains is covered by an [[Organic matter|organic]] rich layer over layers rich in [[clay]].&lt;ref name = "Descroix2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Influence of soil surface features and vegetation on runoff and erosion in the Western Sierra Madre (Durango, Northwest Mexico) | last = Descroix | last2 = Viramontes | last3 = Vauclin | last4 = Gonzalez Barrios | last5 = Esteves | year = 2000 | doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(00)00124-7 | first1 = L | first2 = D | first3 = M | first4 = J.L | first5 = M | journal = CATENA | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 115â135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soils are commonly [[phaeozems]] that are up to {{convert|100|cm|in}}.&lt;ref name = "Descroix2000"/&gt; Some soils are [[cambisols]] that are less than {{convert|2|m|ft}} deep and well [[Drainage|drained]].&lt;ref name = "Gonzales-Barrios2002"&gt;{{cite conference|title = Soil degradation and desertification in the Western Sierra Madre of Mexico|last = Gonzales-Barrios|last2 = Descroix|last3 = Viramontes|last4 = Anaya |conference= 17th WCSS 14â21 August|year=2002 |location = Thailand}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high clay contents, which block water from being absorbed into the soil, larger rock particles in the soil help reduce runoff and soil losses from erosion. Areas that are covered in stone are known as [[lithosols]] and make up most of the remaining surface in the mountains,&lt;ref name = "Descroix2000"/&gt; especially on upper slopes.&lt;ref name = "Gonzales-Barrios2002" /&gt; The last major soil type are [[vertisols]] which are thin mineral poor soils.

Soils along the eastern slopes have increased organic content and a clay heavy layer that is developed more than those of the more arid eastern lands.&lt;ref name = "Hawley1969"/&gt; The thickness of soil layers also increases.

Problems with soil degradation have been aggravated by the cultivation of drug crops, leading to [[deforestation]] of many areas.&lt;ref name = "Pajares2011"&gt;{{cite web | title = Highlands and Drylands: Mountains a source of resilience in arid regions | last = Pajares | first = Pedro | year = 2011 | url = http://www.fao.org/docrep/014/i2248e/i2248e00.pdf| accessdate = 18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other problems include [[overgrazing]], which has led to terracing from cattle paths and the formation of a [[soil crust]], and [[soil acidification]], which poses a risk to some grasslands as of 2002.&lt;ref name = "Gonzales-Barrios2002" /&gt;

==Climate==
The climate varies considerably between the northern and southern extents of this long mountain range. Seasonal variations also occur due to the presence of large bodies of warm water delivering warm damp air from each side of the range. This region undergoes a seasonal variety with two wet seasons, including a summer [[monsoon]], and two dry seasons each year.

===Temperature, Pressure, and Wind===
Air pressure changes in Northwestern Mexico and the [[Southwest United States]] are the main causes of seasonal variation in the Sierra Madre. A [[high pressure area]] that rests over the mountains in the winter begins to move north of the mountains into [[New Mexico]] during the month of June.&lt;ref name = "NOAANAM"&gt;{{cite web | title = The North American Monsoon | publisher = National Weather Service | url = http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/outreach/Report-to-the-Nation-Monsoon_aug04.pdf | accessdate =7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high pressure begins to breakdown and move south during September or October; however, the breakdown is usually at a slower pace than the movement north. This high pressure belt is associated with the mechanics that form the [[Bermuda High]].&lt;ref name="Garatuza2001"&gt;{{cite web | title = Solar radiation and Ã©vapotranspiration in northern Mexico estimated from remotely sensed measurements of cloudiness | last = Garatuza-Payan | first = Jaime | last2 = Pinker | first2 = Rachel | last3 = Watts | first3 = Christopher | date = December 2001 | url = http://iahs.info/hsj/460/hysj_46_03_0465.pdf | accessdate = 15 March 2012 }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate in the mountains is mild. Summer temperatures maintain a constant level. Maximum temperatures are typically in July at around 31&amp;nbsp;C&lt;ref name = "Garatuza2001"/&gt; with average temperatures on the order of 16&amp;nbsp;C during this same period.&lt;ref name = "Heyerdahl2003"/&gt; Mean annual temperatures are between {{convert|55|-|65|F|C}} above {{convert|6000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name = USPO1992&gt;{{cite web|title = Integrated Environmental Plan for the Mexican-U.S. Border Area|year = 1992|url = http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABM228.pdf|accessdate = 21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below freezing temperatures can occur in the higher mountains, with [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] occurring as snowfall certain times of year.&lt;ref name = "eoearth"&gt;{{cite web | title = Sierra Madre Occidental pine-oak forests | date = 1 December 2006 | url = http://www.eoearth.org/article/Sierra_Madre_Occidental_p | accessdate =15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer monsoon, [[wind]] patterns undergo large-scale changes.&lt;ref name = "NOAANAM"/&gt; In May there is very little large-scale wind current through the mountains, most circulates around the mountains,&lt;ref name = "NOAANAM"/&gt; although [[Sea breeze|onshore flow]] is present.&lt;ref name = "Douglas1992"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The Mexican Monsoon | last = Douglas | first = Michael | last2 = Maddox | first2 = Robert | last3 = Howard | first3 = Kenneth | last4 = Reyes | first4 = Sergio | year = 1992 | url = http://climateknowledge.org/NA_precipitation/Douglas_Mexican_Monsoon_JClim_1993.pdf | accessdate =19 March 2012 |doi=10.1175/1520-0442(1993)006&lt;1665:TMM&gt;2.0.CO;2 | volume = 6 | pages = 1665â1677 | journal = Journal of Climate | issue = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the high pressure moves north, air is pulled off the Gulf of Mexico, bringing easterly winds aloft to the mountains.&lt;ref name = "NOAANAM"/&gt; On the east slope of the mountain daytime upslope winds flow to the crest, where the flow joins westerly winds.&lt;ref name = "Fawcett2002"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Multistage moisture transport into the interior of northern Mexico during the North American summer monsoon | last = Fawcett | first = Peter | last2 = Stalker | first2 = James | last3 = Gutzler | first3 = David | year = 2002 | doi=10.1029/2002GL015693| journal = Geophysical Research Letters| volume = 29| issue = 23 | pages = 9â1 | bibcode=2002GeoRL..29.2094F}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mountains cause convection during the following monsoon season,&lt;ref name = "Douglas1992"/&gt; during which nocturnal winds at low levels in the atmosphere move moisture overnight.&lt;ref name = "Fawcett2002"/&gt; After the high pressure breaks down, wind patterns return to those prior to the monsoon season.

=== Precipitation and Humidity===
Precipitation varies on both annual and seasonal scales in the Sierra Madre. Annual differences in regional climate are associated with the [[El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation]] with El NiÃ±o years leading to a wetter climate.&lt;ref name = "Heyerdahl2003"&gt;{{cite web | title =  Influence of Climate and Land Use on Historical Surface Fires in Pine-Oak Forests, Sierra Madre Occidental, Mexico | last = Heyerdahl | first = Emily | last2 = Alvarado | first2 = Ernesto | url = http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2003_heyerdahl_e001.pdf | year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsoon rains come to the Sierra Madre in June, as the high pressure area moves north, leading to wet summer seasons. This causes east winds bringing [[moisture]] from the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. On the western side of the mountains, which are affected by the largest change in precipitation between the [[dry season]] and monsoon season,&lt;ref name = "Douglas1992"/&gt; in the monsoon season rainfall can exceed {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} in a single month.&lt;ref name = "NOAANAM"/&gt; The southern region receives more of the rainfall than the northern.&lt;ref name = "Douglas1992"/&gt; Much of this precipitation occurs as [[tropical storms]]. As the high pressure over New Mexico breaks down, rainfall in the Sierra Madre ends. Because of the monsoon, the summer accounts for the majority of rainfall in the area.&lt;ref name = "Heyerdahl2003"/&gt; The spring and fall dry season separate out a weaker wet season in the winter. In addition to increasing in the southern ranges of the mountains, rainfall increases in the higher elevations of the Sierra Madre Occidental.&lt;ref name = "Heyerdahl2003"/&gt;

[[Humidity]] in the mountains varies at wide levels as does rainfall. In the early morning before dawn, the air is almost saturated (often over 90% [[relative humidity]]) near the mountain tops with low clouds over the range. Lower in the range, air is not as near saturated in the morning.&lt;ref name = "Nesbitt2007"&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Diurnal Cycle of Clouds and Precipitation along the Sierra Madre Occidental Observed during NAME-2004: Implications for Warm Season Precipitation Estimation in Complex Terrain | last = Nesbitt | first = Stephen | last2 = Gochis | first2 = David | last3 = Lang | first3 = Timothy | year = 2007 | url = http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2008JHM939.1 | accessdate =19 March 2012 | doi=10.1175/2008JHM939.1 | journal = Journal of Hydrometeorology | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 728â743| bibcode = 2008JHyMe...9..728N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seasonal variation in humidity is also present with average May and June relative humidity around 50%, with 25% possible during the day.&lt;ref name = "Garatuza2001"/&gt; Also during the day, relative humidity drops and cloud levels rise as temperatures rise.&lt;ref name="Nesbitt2007"/&gt; The humidity of the range is also influenced by the same seasonal changes as rainfall. In the dry season [[dew point]]s are low at high elevations (500 hPa), around {{convert|-22|Â°C|Â°F|abbr=on}} in the south of the range, and {{convert|-24|and|-26|Â°C|Â°F|abbr=on}} in the north in May. In June, dew points begin to increase from the May levels up to {{convert|-20|Â°C|Â°F|abbr=on}} in the north and {{convert|-16|Â°C|Â°F|abbr=on}} in the south. By July these dew points are at {{convert|-14|Â°C|Â°F|abbr=on}} throughout the range. The range allows higher dew points throughout these periods than the surrounding low lands. This rise in humidity accompanies the monsoon.&lt;ref name = "Douglas1992"/&gt;

==Ecology==
[[File:Sierra Madre Occidental....jpg|thumb|left|[[Sierra Madre Occidental pine-oak forests]]]]
The mountains create a diverse setting for plants and animals by creating a different set of conditions from the surroundings.

===Flora===
The [[Dominance (ecology)|dominant]] plants vary across the range, and the habitat that they present varies from scattered [[woodland]] to both [[deciduous]] and [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] forest.

Birds frequent the mountains, some as a [[Bird migration|migratory path]] and others as [[Indigenous (ecology)|native species]].

[[File:Signalen 2.JPG|thumb|Folkungagatan street, forming the northern edge of SoFo.]]

The area '''SoFo''', or "South of [[Folkungagatan, Stockholm|Folkungagatan]]" is located in [[SÃ¶dermalm]], a district of [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="visitstockholm"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.visitstockholm.com/en/See--do/Guides/Guide-to-SoFo/ | title=Guide to SoFo | website=VisitStockholm.com | accessdate=28 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is bounded by Folkungagatan street to the north, RingvÃ¤gen to the south and in the east and west by Erstagatan and GÃ¶tgatan, respectively.

The name SoFo is a pun on [[SoHo]], the districts in [[London]] and [[Manhattan]],&lt;ref name="sdut"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2015/aug/11/neighborhoods-stockholms-sofo-a-ny-inspired/ | title=Neighborhoods: Stockholm's SoFo, a NY-inspired hipsterland | first=Karl | last=Ritter | newspaper=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]] | location=USA | date=11 August 2015 | accessdate=28 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is an invention of local entrepreneurs who since 2003 have attempted to rebrand the area as a centre of creative and innovative [[Swedish fashion]] and retailing.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} In particular, many [[Swedish fashion]] designers are located in SoFo.

SoFo is home to many other creative industries in Stockholm, including advertising agencies, media companies and publishers.&lt;ref name="visitstockholm" /&gt;

The name "Sofo" is primarily used by so-called [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]]&lt;ref name="sdut" /&gt; and people in the creative industry. The name has been debated as a creation of the wishes of a group of people, although the area is essentially unchanged.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Other local places of interest include [[Nytorget]], a city square with a playground and small park and [[Vita Bergen]], a larger park with good views over Stockholm.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Vita Bergen also has an open-air theatre which has music and dance performances during summer, and offers steep tobogganing in winter.

SoFo is accessible via [[Medborgarplatsen]] and [[Skanstull]] [[Stockholm Metro|metro]] stations.

==SoFo events==
The last Thursday of every month is called SoFo night, where retailers are open until 9pm and offer free entertainment and refreshments to shoppers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sofo-stockholm.se/category/sofo-night/ | language=Swedish | title=SoFo-Night | website=SoFo-Stockholm.se | location=Sweden | accessdate=28 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many stores provide live music and a vibrant atmosphere.

==Phone numbers formats==
Telephone numbers in [[Peru]] are made of:

===Mobile telephony===
* Nine digits for mobile numbers across the country. The first digit is always the number nine: '''9xx xxx xxx'''

===Fixed (land) lines===
* Seven digits in the Metropolitan Area of [[Lima]] and [[Callao]]
* Six digits in the rest of the country

==Area codes==
Peruvian area codes for each [[Political division of Peru#Current division|region]] (national subdivision) are 2 digits long except for Lima and Callao. On 1 March 2003 new codes were established.

The following is a list of the area codes in Peru:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtc.gob.pe/portal/avm2/codigos.pdf Peru Area Codes chart: Ministry of Transports and Communications] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104160930/http://www.mtc.gob.pe/portal/avm2/codigos.pdf |date=2011-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobile phone calls within Peru (Mobile Virtual Area)==
From September 4, 2010, a national Mobile Virtual Area&lt;ref&gt;Peru Mobile Virtual Area, Ministry of Transports and Communications {{es icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.mtc.gob.pe/portal/avm2/avm.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104161116/http://www.mtc.gob.pe/portal/avm2/avm.pdf |archivedate=2011-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  was created meaning that all mobile numbers in Peru are ''non-geographical'' (not attached to any geographical region but instead to the new MVA). In addition to that all mobile numbers across the country turned to nine digits long: '''9xx xxx xxx'''.&lt;ref&gt;ITU: [http://www.itu.int/oth/T02020000A6/en national numbering plans - Peru] visited September 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

The following instructions are valid '''across the country''':&lt;ref&gt;International dialing instructions: Ministry of Transports and Communications {{cite web |url=http://www.mtc.gob.pe/portal/avm2/ejemplosdellamadas.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214101247/http://www.mtc.gob.pe/portal/avm2/ejemplosdellamadas.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calls from mobile to mobile===
     9xx xxx xxx (just dial the 9-digit number)

===Calls from mobile to landline===
     0 + area code + phone number
     Example on how to call to Piura: 0 + 73 + 388351

===Calls from fixed line to mobile===
     9xx xxx xxx (just dial the 9-digit number)

==Domestic calls within Peru==

===Calls from fixed line to landline===
     Call to a number in the same area: just dial the phone number

     Call to a number in another area ('''domestic long distance'''):  0 + area code + phone number.

==International long distance==

===Calling Peru from abroad===

====Calling a fixed line====
     +51 + area code + phone number
Where the plus sign (+) represents the international access code of the country you are calling from.

From North America: 011 + 51 + area code + phone number

Example: 
* Calling a fixed line in Lima:  '''011 51'''  '''1'''  1234567
* Calling a fixed line in Cusco: '''011 51'''  '''84'''  123456

From Europe or most APAC countries: 00 + 51 + area code + phone number

====Calling a mobile number====
     +51 + 9-digit mobile number
The mobile virtual area eliminates the use of area code for mobile numbers.

===Calling abroad from Peru===
In Peru, when making an international call you may choose a carrier for international calls '''different from your usual carrier/provider''' according to the rates carriers offer to attract callers. This system is known as "call by call" (in Spanish "Llamada por llamada") as each call can be made with a different carrier and is available to both fixed lines and mobile phones. Each carrier uses a 4-digit prefix (format 19XX).

====International dialing format====
This is the standard format in Peru for making calls abroad from fixed lines and mobile phones:
     19XX + 00 + country code + area code + phone number

Carriers:
* Americatel: 1977&lt;ref&gt;Americatel website {{es icon}} [http://www.americatel.com.pe/contenidos.php?ic=12]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Claro: 1912&lt;ref&gt;Claro website {{es icon}} [http://www2.claro.com.pe/PortalClaroWeb/portal/PortalClaro.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_windowLabel=InstitucionalController_1&amp;_pageLabel=INS&amp;menuItem=0.4.9&amp;esPromocion=false&amp;idAbuelo=04#wlp_InstitucionalController_1]&lt;/ref&gt;
* IDT: 1914&lt;ref&gt;IDT website {{es icon}} [http://www.1914.com.pe/]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Convergia: 1960
* Movistar: 1911&lt;ref&gt;Movistar website {{es icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.movistar.com.pe/Archivos/Atencion%20al%20Cliente/1673/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208043413/http://www.movistar.com.pe/Archivos/Atencion%20al%20Cliente/1673/index.html |archivedate=2010-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nextel: 1990 (valid only for Nextel customers)
* Viettel : 2014


It is '''mandatory''' to choose a 19XX carrier when calling internationally from a fixed line.

If you are calling internationally from a mobile phone you have the option not to use the 19XX prefix. You may dial starting with the "+" symbol
     +country code + area code + phone number
and the international call will go through your provider's network.

===Example calls===
From Peru to USA/Canada:
* From fixed line or mobile phone: 19XX + 00 + 1 + area code + phone number
* From mobile phone (2Â° alternative): +1 + area code + phone number (your call will go through your usual provider's network)

==Special numbers==
*103 is the telephone information number
*105 is the Police Emergency Number
*117 is the Ambulance number
*116 is the Fire number
