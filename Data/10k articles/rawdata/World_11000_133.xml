The '''A1 motorway''', locally referred to as the '''Nicosia{{ndash}}Limassol highway''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''δρόμος Λευκωσίας{{ndash}}Λεμεσού''; [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Lefkoşa{{ndash}}Limasol yolu''), is the first and longest motorway built in [[Cyprus]]. It marked the beginning of an ambitious government project to link all the main cities on the island with modern 4 lane highways.  It is 73&amp;nbsp;km long and is free of any [[at-grade intersection]]s.  It links the capital [[Nicosia]] (which is the administrative and financial hub), with [[Limassol]], the largest port (and second largest city) on the island.

== History ==
[[Image:A1 Motorway Cyprus.JPG|thumb|left|220px|Night view between [[Agios Athanasios junction]] and [[Linopetra junction]] in [[Limassol]]]]

In the late 1970s, the Cypriot Government introduced a series of schemes to improve the infrastructure of transport on the Island. The first planned motorway was to be built between [[Nicosia]] and [[Nicosia International Airport]], roughly on the route of the current Griva Digeni Avenue. The road was widened in preparation but following the Turkish Invasion of Cyprus in July 1974 and the closure of the airport as a result, this scheme was abandoned, Construction started on the A1 to connect Nicosia with the new main port of Cyprus at [[Limassol]] in 1978.

The construction started at both ends concurrently. In the initial construction, the junctions were at grade separation. Although reconstruction at the Nicosia end has obliterated any evidence of this, drivers can still see the filter lanes at junction 17. The motorway was opened in stages, with the final stage (Kornos to Kophinou) completed in October 1984, while upgrades within the city of Limassol were completed in summer 2008. These upgrades included the [[Polemidia and Troödos junction]], [[Agia Filaxis Junction]], [[Agios Athanasios junction]], [[Linopetra junction]], and [[Germasogeia junction]], and involved the replacement of a series of roundabouts with flyovers or underpasses.

== Today ==
Since 2012, the section of the motorway between the entrance of Nicosia and the intersection with the A2 motorway is upgraded to a 6 lane road due to heavy traffic observed.

'''Arved Fuchs''' (born 26 April 1953 in [[Bad Bramstedt]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]]) is a [[Germany|German]] explorer. On 30 December 1989, he and [[Reinhold Messner]] were the first to reach the [[South Pole]] with neither animal nor motorised help, on skis, and with wind-assistance (parasail). Many of his [[expeditions]] have taken place on water, such as his failed attempt to sail around [[North Pole]] on a traditional sailing boat (1991-1994). This boat, named ''[[Dagmar Aaen]]'', is still used by Fuchs on his current expeditions.

In October 2017, Fuchs was awarded the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]] for his merits to the protection of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.abendblatt.de/hamburg/article212130167/Karin-Beier-traegt-jetzt-das-Bundesverdienstkreuz.html |title=Karin Beier trägt jetzt das Bundesverdienstkreuz |language=German |agency=[[Deutsche Presse-Agentur|DPA]] |date=4 October 2017 |work=[[Hamburger Abendblatt]] |accessdate=4 October 2017 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Basaa languages''' are a clade of [[Bantu language]]s coded Zone A.40 in [[Guthrie classification of Bantu languages|Guthrie's classification]]. According to Nurse &amp; Philippson (2003), the languages remaining from the formation of the [[Mbam languages|Mbam]] group form a valid node. They are:
:[[Basaa language|Basaa]]–[[Kogo language|Kogo]] (Bakoko), [[Rombi language|Rombi]]–[[Bankon language|Bankon]].
[[Hijuk language|Hijuk]] was listed as unclassified A.50 in Guthrie, but according to ''Ethnologue'' it is quite similar to Basaa.

The '''Archeparchy of Amida''' (or Diyarbakır) is the [[Chaldaean rite]] Catholic diocese of Turkey, with its archiepiscopal see in [[Diyarbakır]], [[Turkey]].

== History ==
It was first established in 1531 as the [[Chaldean Diocese of Amid]](a), but was left vacant after the [[Assyrian Genocide]] and lapsed after the death of its archbishop in 1923. Its episcopal see was historically located in [[Diyarbekir]], and it still is in modern day, but the archeparch (or archbishop) now resides in [[Beyoğlu]], [[Istanbul]].

In June 1915 it gained territory from the suppressed [[Chaldean Catholic Diocese of Seert]] (now a titular see), and again on 3 July 1957 from the suppressed [[Chaldean Catholic Diocese of Gazireh]] (which isn't even a titular see anymore). It was promoted to an [[Archeparchy]] (Eastern Catholic archdiocese) on 3 January 1966 and a new archbishop was ordained to fill the role. Since that point, it has been the sole Chaldean Diocese in Turkey, and in effect resides over all of Turkeys Chaldeans.

The Archeparch (archbishop) is immediately subject to the [[Patriarch of Babylon]], who heads the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]].

==Demographics==
The most recent data indicates that the Chaldean population is 7,640, up from 6,000 in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/ddiar.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cinta Senese''' ({{IPA-it|ˈtʃinta  seˈneːze; -eːse}}) is a [[breed]] of domestic [[pig]] from the [[province of Siena]], in [[Tuscany]], central Italy.{{r|dad}} Since 2006 animals raised in Tuscany have had [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union#Protected designation of origin (PDO)|DOP]] status, and are officially named '''Suino Cinto Toscano DOP'''.{{r|dop}} The Cinta Senese is one of the six [[wikt:autochthonous|autochthonous]] pig breeds recognised by the [[Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari e Forestali]], the Italian ministry of agriculture and forestry.{{r|anas}}
[[File:Cinta Senese.jpg|thumbnail|Cinta Senese piglets]]
The Cinta Senese is particularly associated with the [[Montagnola Senese]] and the [[comuni]] of [[Casole d'Elsa]], [[Castelnuovo Berardenga]], [[Gaiole in Chianti]], [[Monteriggioni]], [[Siena]] and [[Sovicille]], in the area between the upper [[Merse (river)|Merse]] and the upper [[Elsa (river)|Elsa]] rivers. It was in the past widely distributed throughout Tuscany.

A genealogical herdbook was established in the early 1930s. The population fell drastically after the [[Second World War]], almost to the point of extinction, and the herdbook was discontinued in the 1960s. Following a recent recovery in numbers, the herdbook was re-opened in 1997,{{r|bigi|dm}} and is kept by the Associazione Nazionale Allevatori Suini, the Italian national association of pig breeders. The population remains low: at the end of 2007 it was 2867;{{r|bigi}} the conservation status of the breed was listed as "endangered" by the [[FAO]] in the same year.{{r|barb}} At the end of 2012 there were 2543 pigs registered, distributed over 111 farms.{{r|anas2}}

{{Politics of Poland}}

The '''Constitutional Tribunal''' ({{lang-pl|Trybunał Konstytucyjny}}) is the [[constitutional court]] of the [[Poland|Republic of Poland]], a judicial body established to resolve disputes on the constitutionality of the activities of state institutions; its main task is to supervise the compliance of statutory law with the [[Constitution of the Republic of Poland]]. It was established on the 26 March 1982 by the communist government of the [[People's Republic of Poland]] after the introduction of [[martial law]], an attempt to crush political opposition. 

The Constitutional Tribunal adjudicates on the compliance with the Constitution of legislation and international agreements (also their ratification), on disputes over the powers of central constitutional bodies, and on compliance with the Constitution of the aims and activities of political parties. It also rules on constitutional complaints.

The Constitutional Tribunal is made up of 15 judges chosen by the Sejm RP (the lower house of parliament) for single nine-year terms. The Constitutional Tribunal constitutes one of the formal guarantees of a state grounded on the rule of law.

Three judges, appointed by the President of the Tribunal, serve as members of the [[National Electoral Commission (Poland)|National Electoral Commission]] (''Act of  5 January 2011 Electoral Code'').

In 2016 Julia Przyłębska, an ally of Law and Justice, was appointed as President of the Constitutional Tribunal. Her appointment has been argued to be unconstitutional because she was appointed directly by the President of the Republic rather than being elected by judges on the Tribunal, as required by Poland's Constitution.

The three judges with term of office 'since 7 November 2015' are disputed : the Sejm appointed them (with two others) before the parliamentary elections of 2015; after these elections, the Sejm invalidated their appointment and elected five new judges in their place. The president denied the serment to the five appointed before the election and swore the five new judges in.

Of the appointments made before the election, the Constitutional Tribunal itself invalidated two (Bronisław Sitek and Andrzej Sokala) and accepted three (Roman Hauser, Krzysztof Ślebzak and Andrzej Jakubecki). As a consequence, of the appointments made after the election, the Tribunal accepted two (Piotr Pszczółkowski and Julia Przyłębska) and invalidated three (Henryk Cioch, Lech Morawski and Mariusz Muszyński). See [[Polish Constitutional Court crisis, 2015]].

'''''Desert Blues''''' is a 2006 documentary film directed by {{ill|Michel Jaffrennou|fr}} produced under an international collaboration between Belgium, France and [[Mali]].

== Synopsis ==
Although they come from different ethnic groups, two musicians and one band from [[Mali]] come together to make people listen to the desert: [[Habib Koité]], a [[Bambara people|Bambara]] whose roots are in the [[Khassonké people|Khassonké]] culture of western Mali; [[Afel Bocoum]], a [[Songhai people|Songhai]], considered the heir to [[Ali Farka Touré]]; and [[Tartit]], an all-female [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] group from [[Timbuktu]], ethnically related to the [[Berbers|Berber]] people, that lends its voice to the cause of a subsisting culture. The coming together of these three is an event with true political significance considering the tragic events that shook Mali between 1995 and 1996. when the Mouvement Populaire de l’Azaouad/Azawad People's Movement (MPA) declared war for independence of the northern part of the country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2248">'''Digital Satellite System''' is the initialism expansion of the '''DSS''' digital [[satellite television]] transmission system used by [[DirecTV]]. Only when digital transmission was introduced did [[direct broadcast satellite]] (DBS) television become popular in [[North America]], which has led to both DBS and DSS being used interchangeably to refer to all three commonplace digital transmission formats - DSS, DVB-S and [[4DTV]]. Analog DBS services, however, existed prior to DirecTV and were still operational in continental Europe until April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AnalogueSat |url=http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/intro.html |accessdate=2013-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228075422/http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/intro.html |archivedate=2012-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of DirecTV's launch in 1994, the [[DVB-S]] digital satellite system in use in the majority of the world had not yet been standardised, the [[Thomson SA|Thomson]] developed DSS system was used instead. 

While functionally similar in DVB-S - [[MPEG 2]] video, [[MPEG-1 Layer II]] or [[Dolby AC-3|AC3]] audio, [[QPSK]] modulation, and identical error correction ([[Reed-Solomon error correction|Reed-Solomon coding]] and [[Viterbi decoder|Viterbi]] [[forward error correction]]), the transport stream and information tables are entirely different from those of DVB. Also unlike DVB, all DSS receivers are proprietary DirecTV reception units.

DirecTV is now using a modified version of [[DVB-S2]], the latest version of the DVB-S protocol, for [[HDTV]] services off the [[SPACEWAY-1]], [[SPACEWAY-2]], [[DirecTV-10]] and [[DirecTV-11]]&lt;ref&gt;http://dtv.client.shareholder.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=324646&lt;/ref&gt; satellites; however, huge numbers of DSS encoded channels still remain. The ACM  modulation scheme used by DirecTV prevents regular DVB-S2 demodulators from receiving the signal although the data carried are regular MPEG-4 transport streams.

'''Dubey &amp; Schaldenbrand''' is a luxury [[watch]] company dating back to 1946 and named after founders Georges Dubey and René Schaldenbrand. In 1995, the revival of Dubey &amp; Schaldenbrand started as a homage to the past with Cinette Robert deciding to open her vault containing her fabulous old movement collection. (During the 1970s and early 1980s, Cinette Robert was one of the few visionaries that toured all manufacturers in order to purchase watch movements and components. Recasing each movement according to the era when it was created, the Dubey &amp; Schaldenbrand designs rapidly found a niche with collectors. Dubey &amp; Schaldenbrand continues to produce small quantities of automatic and mechanical movement watches. The company is located in La Chaux-de-Fonds in [[Switzerland]].

Galicia's two major economic poles are [[A Coruña]] and [[Vigo]], with A Coruña in the lead, producing an estimated 33.2% of [[VAT]] receipts against 24.3% from Vigo.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} 
A third economic center is [[Santiago de Compostela]], capital of Galicia. Other important cities are [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]] and [[Pontevedra]]. In recent years the distance has grown between the interior provinces, [[Province of Lugo|Lugo]] and [[Province of Ourense|Ourense]], which are more rural and less developed, and the coastal provinces, [[Province of Pontevedra|Pontevedra]] and [[Province of A Coruña|A Coruña]], particularly the areas situated along the axis of the A-9 Highway.

There is also a growing economic sector in [[Fair Trade]] and alternative economy.

== Background ==
Galicia is the fifth largest autonomous region in Spain by area, with its own language, and cultural traditions which, like [[Catalonia]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], set it apart from the rest of Spain.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== Spanish Civil War ==
''[[Caudillo]]'' [[Francisco Franco]] was originally from Galicia, although during the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] and the [[Spanish State]] from 1939-1975 he banned [[Galician language|Galician]] from being spoken. During the Spanish State years the region was neglected by the central government and lagged other regions during the [[Spanish miracle]] of the 1960s and 1970s.

== Contemporary Economy  ==
Today, Galicia is a producer and manufacturer of several goods, including automobiles, ships, fashion garments and timber. Vigo produces 17% of all the automobiles manufactured in Spain. The port of Vigo is also important for shipping and seafood exports. Galician productivity of timber stands at 207.95 m3/k2.

'''Ekspress A3''' ({{lang-ru|Экспре́сс А3}} meaning Express A3), also designated '''Ekspress 3A''', is a [[Russia]]n [[communications satellite]] which is operated by [[Kosmicheskiya Svyaz]] and [[Eutelsat]]. It was constructed by [[NPO Prikladnoi Mekhaniki]] and [[Alcatel Space]] and is based on the [[MSS-2500-GSO]] [[satellite bus]]. The satellite was launched at [[Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 200]] on 24 June 2000, 00:28 UTC. The launch was made by [[Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center]], and a [[Proton-K]]/[[Block D|DM-2M]] carrier rocket was used.

It is part of the [[Express (satellite)|Ekspress satellite network]].

Following its launch and on-orbit testing, it was placed in [[geosynchronous orbit]] at 11° West, from where it provides communications services to [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]. It is equipped with seventeen transponders.

'''European Route E&amp;nbsp;117''' is part of the [[International E-road network]], which is a series of main roads in [[Europe]].

== Description ==
The E&amp;nbsp;117 starts from [[Mineralnye Vody]], [[Russia]], via the [[Georgian Military Road]] to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia's]] capital [[Tbilisi]], via the [[Armenia]]n capital [[Yerevan]] and on to [[Meghri|Megri]] on the border of [[Iran]]. It runs for a total distance of {{convert|1050|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

Between [[Mineralnye Vody]] and [[Beslan]], it is concurrent with [[European route E50|E&amp;nbsp;50]] and Russian highway [[M29 highway (Russia)|M29]].

Tauris &amp; Co. Ltd, Publishers|location=London|isbn=978-0472113361}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FLS included [[Angola]], [[Botswana]], [[Mozambique]], [[Tanzania]], [[Zambia]], and [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref name="Arnold"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=Guy|title=The A to Z of the Non-Aligned Movement and Third World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4b4aAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126|accessdate=6 November 2016|date=6 April 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9781461672319|pages=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Black nations seek summit with Reagan |date=25 August 1986 |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |page=A6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FLS disbanded after [[Nelson Mandela]] became [[President of South Africa]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="Arnold"/&gt;

==Background==
In April 1975, the Frontline States - then consisting of Botswana, Tanzania and Zambia - were formally recognised as an entity as a committee of the Assembly of the Heads of State of the [[Organisation of African Unity]]. They were joined by Angola (1975), Mozambique (1975) and Zimbabwe (1980) when those countries gained their independence. Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]] was the chairman until he retired in 1985. His successor was Zambian President [[Kenneth Kaunda]]. The countries met regularly to coordinate their policies.&lt;ref name="Arnold"/&gt;

==Mission==
Their mission was complicated by the fact that the economies of nearly all the FLS countries were dependent on South Africa, and many of their citizens worked there.&lt;ref name=SAHO&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/frontline-states |title=Frontline States |publisher=South Africa History Online |website=sahistory.org.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the FLS supported and sheltered groups opposed to [[white rule]], not only in South Africa (the [[African National Congress]]), but also in [[Namibia]] ([[SWAPO]]), which was controlled by South Africa. The FLS, plus [[Lesotho]], [[Malawi]] and [[Swaziland]], formed the [[Southern African Development Coordination Conference]] in 1980 to try to reduce their economic dependence on South Africa.&lt;ref name="Arnold"/&gt;

South Africa launched military incursions in Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique and supported rebel groups seeking to topple the regimes in Angola ([[UNITA]]) and Mozambique ([[RENAMO]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aamarchives.org/history/front-line-states.html |title=The Frontline States |publisher=[[Anti-Apartheid Movement]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

American relations with the Frontline States reached their peak during the [[human rights]] push of the [[Carter administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Castro Versus Carter: Bad news for Zimbabwe |date=23 October 1979 |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |page=P7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Reagan administration]]'s [[Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs]] [[Chester Crocker]], the Frontline States were engaged diplomatically to reach landmark peace accords between South Africa, Mozambique, Angola ([[Lusaka Protocol]]), and [[Namibia]] ([[New York Accords]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Namibia: Will it look like Austria, Finland? |date=20 April 1981 |newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/06/weekinreview/washington-s-no-apologies-approach-to-the-third-world.html |title=Washington's No-Apologies Approach to the Third World |date=6 September 1981 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caucasus central asia political map 2000.jpg|thumb|275px|A political map of Central Asia and the Caucasus countries (click to enlarge).]]
Central Asia has long been a [[geostrategy|geostrategic]] location because of its proximity to the interests of several [[great power]]s and [[regional power]]s.

== Strategic geography ==
[[Central Asia]] had both the advantage and disadvantage of a central location between four historical seats of power. From its central location, it has access to trade routes, or lines of attack, to all the regional powers. On the other hand, it has been continuously vulnerable to attack from all sides throughout its history, resulting in political fragmentation or outright power vacuum, as it is successively dominated.
*To the north, the [[steppe]] allowed for rapid mobility, first for nomadic horseback warriors like the [[Huns]] and [[Mongols]], and later for Russian traders, eventually supported by railroads. As the [[Russian Empire]] expanded to the east, it would also push down into Central Asia towards the sea, in a search for [[warm water port]]s. The [[USSR]] would reinforce dominance from the north, and attempt to project power as far south as [[Afghanistan]].
*To the east, the demographic and cultural weight of [[History of China|Chinese empires]] continually pushed outward into Central Asia. The [[Han dynasty|Han]], [[Tang dynasty|Tang]], and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasties would conquer parts of [[Fergana Valley]] and [[Tarim Basin]], and the later [[Qing dynasty]] of China consolidated Chinese control over this area. China would project power into Central Asia, most notably in the case of Afghanistan, to counter Russian dominance of the region.
*To the southeast, the demographic and cultural influence of South Asia is felt in Central Asia, notably in Tibet, the [[Hindu Kush]], and slightly beyond. Several historical dynasties and powers of South Asia, especially those seated along the [[Indus River]], would expand towards Central Asia. The post-Soviet era was characterized by India and Pakistan in South Asia expanding their interests in the region. India's ability to project power into Central Asia has been limited due to being geographically being separated by Pakistan from Central Asia, and the cultural differences between secular India, and what would become a mostly Muslim Central Asia.
*To the southwest, Middle Eastern powers have expanded into the southern areas of Central Asia. Several [[Persian Empire|Persian]] empires would conquer and reconquer parts of Central Asia; [[Alexander the Great]]'s [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] empire would extend into Central Asia; two [[Arab]] Islamic empires would exert substantial influence throughout the region; and the modern state of [[Iran]] has projected influence throughout the region as well. [[Turkey]], through a common [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] nation identity, has gradually increased its ties and influence as well in the region. Furthermore, all Central Asian Turkic-speaking states are together with Turkey part of the [[Turkic Council]].

=== Strategic locations ===
In terms of [[strategic geography]], Central Asia has several important routes through Eurasia, which conquerors would seek to dominate and utilize.

Passes:

:*[[Wakhan Corridor]]: In [[Afghanistan]], with [[Tajikistan]] to the north, Pakistan to the south and China to the east
:*[[Khyber Pass]]: between Afghanistan and Pakistan
:*[[Torugart Pass]]: between [[Kyrgyzstan]] and China
:*[[Nathu La]], [[Jelep La]]: passes between India and China
:*[[Khunjerab Pass]]: between Pakistan and China
:*[[Dzungarian Gate]]: between Kazakhstan and China

Areas:
:*The [[Eurasian Steppe]]
:*The [[Hindu Kush]]

==The Great Game==
{{main|The Great Game}}
From 1813 to 1907 [[Great Britain]] and the [[Russian Empire]] were engaged in a strategic competition for domination of Central Asia, known in Britain as "[[The Great Game]]", and in Russia as the "Tournament of Shadows." The British sea power and base in the Indian subcontinent served as the platform for a push Northwest into Central Asia, while the Russian empire pushed into the region from the North. The powers eventually met, and the competition played out, in Afghanistan, although the two never went to war with one another (see [[Durand Line]]).

The British feared that Russian control of Central Asia would create an ideal springboard for an invasion of Britain's territories in the subcontinent ([[British India]]), and were especially concerned about Russia gaining a warm water port. They would fight the [[First Anglo-Afghan War|First]] and [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]]s in an attempt to establish control over the region, and to counter the slowly creeping expansion of Russia. Losing badly both times, the British signed the 1907 [[Anglo-Russian Convention]] which divided Afghanistan between the two powers and outlined the framework for all future diplomatic relations.

==Debated and Debatable zone==
[[Alfred Thayer Mahan]], the father of U.S. geostrategy, outlined the geostrategic divisions of Eurasia in his 1900 piece ''The Problem of Asia and Its Effect Upon International Policies''. He divided Asia into three parts:
*Russian dominated land to the north of the 40th parallel;
*British dominated lands to the south of the 30th parallel; and
*the Debated and Debatable zone located between the 30th and 40th parallels on the Asian continent.

Within this vast zone lie significant parts of Central Asia, including sections of what are now Tibet, Xinjiang, [[Kashmir]], Pakistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, [[Turkmenistan]], [[Tajikistan]], Iran, and the [[Caucasus]].

Mahan believed that the clash between the Russian land power from the North, pushing down toward warm water port, and the opposing coalition of sea powers from pushing upward from the South (including Britain, the U.S., Japan, and Germany), would play out their conflict in the Debated and Debatable zone. This zone featured areas of political vacuum, underdevelopment, and internecine conflicts which made it both unstable and ripe for conquest.

Even today, Central Asia is politically weak or unstable, and riven by separatism, ethnic, or religious conflict.

==The Heartland==
[[Halford J. Mackinder]], a British geographer and geopolitician, would describe this region of the world as the [[Heartland Theory|Heartland]] in a 1904 speech [[The Geographical Pivot of History]] to the Royal Geographical Society. This idea would become the foundation of his contribution to geostrategy. Geographically, the Pivot encompasses all of Central Asia, with the addition of large parts of Iran, and Russia as well.

The Geographic Pivot is an area on the continent of Eurasia which is either landlocked, or whose rivers and littoral fed into inland seas or the ice-locked Arctic Ocean. The Volga, Oxus, and Jaxartes drain into lakes, and the Ob Yenisei and Lena drain into the Arctic. The Tarim and Helmund rivers also fail to drain into the ocean. Most of the region Mackinder defines is steppe land, mottled with patches of desert or mountains. Because of the rapid mobility that the steppe lands allow, Mackinder points to the historical tendency of nomadic horseback or camel-riding invaders coming from the east into the west.

The Pivot's projection into Central Asia is defined on one side by the [[Caspian Sea]] and Caucasus, and on the other side by a mountain range running from Pakistan northeast up to Mongolia and southern Russia. This triangular projection south into Central Asia was part of an area inaccessible to the sea powers (Britain, the U.S., Japan, and France primarily). As such, it was a strategically important area from which land power could be projected into the rest of the Eurasian landmass, virtually unimpeded by the sea powers.

==Soviet collapse==
The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 once again created a situation of political vacuum in Central Asia. The resultant authoritarian but weak former Soviet satellite republics were still considered part of Russia's sphere of influence, but now Russia was only one among many competitors for influence in the new Central Asian states. By 1996, Mongolia would also assert its independence from Russia's influence. Further, the North Caucasus Russian republic [[Chechnya]] would claim independence, leading to the [[First Chechen War|First]] and [[Second Chechen War|Second]] Chechen Wars with Russia winning the latter.

Geostrategist and former United States National Security Advisor, [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] analyzed Central Asia in his 1997 book ''[[The Grand Chessboard]],'' terming the post-Soviet region the "Black Hole" and post-Soviet Central Asia (the Caucasus, former SSRs, and Afghanistan) in particular the "Eurasian Balkans." The area is an ethnic cauldron, prone to instability and conflicts, without a sense of national identity, but rather a mess of historical cultural influences, tribal and clan loyalties, and religious fervor. Projecting influence into the area is no longer just Russia, but also [[Turkey]], Iran, China, Pakistan, India and the [[United States]]:
*Russia continues to influence political decision-making throughout the Caucasus, Central Asia, and former SSRs in general. As some of these countries shed their post-Soviet authoritarian systems and integrate with Western organizations such as the [[European Union|EU]] and [[NATO]], Russia's influence has decreased in those nations. Yet, Russia continues to be the primary power in both the Caucasus and Central Asia, especially in light of the [[2008 South Ossetia war|Russian victory over Georgia]] - and by proxy Western powers - in August 2008, and the many hydrocarbon deals signed between Moscow and the Central Asian states.
*Turkey has some influence because of the ethnic and linguistic ties with the Turkic peoples of Central Asia, as well as serving as the [[Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan oil pipeline]] route to the Mediterranean and a route for natural gas pipelines ([[South Caucasus Pipeline]]; [[Nabucco Pipeline]]).
*Iran, the seat of historical empires which controlled parts of Central Asia, has historical and cultural links to the region, as is vying to construct an oil pipeline from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf.
*China, projects significant power in the region through [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]], energy/oil investment, and trading.
*Pakistan, armed with nuclear weapons, and employing its security forces, among the largest in the world, has massive influence in and around Kashmir and Afghanistan. [[Kashmir conflict|Kashmir is hotly contested]] for with India, while Afghanistan has been used by the Pakistan army as part of its 'strategic depth' in case of war and is now a new proxy war between India and Pakistan.
*India, as a nuclear-armed and strong rising power, exercises much influence in the region, especially in Tibet with which it has cultural affinities. India is also perceived as challenging a potential counterweight to China's regional power. The [[Farkhor Air Base]] in [[Tajikistan]] gives the Indian military the required depth and range in seeking a larger role in South Asia and is a tangible manifestation of India’s move to project its power in Central Asia, a policy goal formally enunciated in 2003–2004.
*The United States with its military involvement in the region is also significantly involved in the region's politics but on a lower level than either China or Russia whose relations with the Central Asian states are more comprehensive, and lack the [[democratization]] factor which Washington espouses.

==War on Terror==
In the context of the United States' [[War on Terror]], Central Asia has once again become the center of geostrategic calculations. Pakistan's status has been upgraded to a "[[major non-NATO ally]]" because of its central role in serving as a staging point for the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]] and for providing intelligence on [[Al-Qaeda]] operations in the region. Afghanistan, which had served as a haven and source of support for Al-Qaeda, under the protection of [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]] and the [[Taliban]], was the target of a [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|U.S. invasion]] in 2001, and ongoing reconstruction and drug-eradication efforts. U.S. military bases were also established in Uzbekistan and [[Kyrgyzstan]] (the Uzbek presence was later withdrawn), causing both Russia and China to voice their concern over a permanent U.S. military presence in the region.

Western observers and governments have claimed that Russia, China and the former Soviet republics have used the language of the War on Terror to quash minority separatist movements as well as some religious groups. The ethnically diverse former SSRs such as Uzbekistan have sometimes reclassified ethnic separatist attacks as terrorist attacks and prosecuted them as such.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Drug Trafficking ==
The [[Silk Road]] which once brought prosperity to Central Asia in the silk trade is now a highway for drugs from Afghanistan to Russia that has contributed to economic, political and social problems in the region. The drug trade is proliferating in Central Asia because of its weak states and geo-strategic location. The low volume of drug seizures (about 4 percent of the estimated total opiate flows) indicates the lack of state power to regulate Central Asian borders as well as the corruption of its officials.&lt;ref name="UNODC"&gt;{{cite book |title=Illicit Drug Trends in Central Asia |publisher=[[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] Regional Office for Central Asia |location=Tashkent, Uzbekistan |year=2008 |url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/regional/central-asia/Illicit%20Drug%20Trends_Central%20Asia-final.pdf |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The propagation of the drug trade perpetuates the weakness of Central Asian states by destabilizing the region through financing militant Islamic groups’ campaigns, increasing drug abuse, and the spread of AIDS/HIV.
 
A large factor in the development of the drug trade in Central Asia is due to the region’s geography. Three of Central Asia’s southern states, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, share a collective border of about 3,000&amp;nbsp;km &lt;ref name="Mohapatra_159"&gt;{{harvp|Mohapatra|2007|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Afghanistan, which produces about 70 percent of the world’s heroin.&lt;ref name="Struck"&gt;{{cite news |author=Doug Struck |title=Central Asia's other fight: armed groups also tied to lucrative drug |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |date=7 November 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 99 percent of Central Asia’s opiates originate from Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="UNODC"/&gt; Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan share a border with the Chinese province, Xinjiang, through which drug traffickers access major opiate producers such as Laos, Thailand and Myanmar. Central Asia’s proximity to these states makes the region a hub for the drug trade throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Mohapatra_159"/&gt;

During the Soviet era, Central Asia’s border to Afghanistan was mostly blocked off with little cross-border trade or travel. When Soviet troops [[Soviet–Afghan War|invaded Afghanistan]] in 1979, the border began to open up. Veterans from the war started to bring back heroin in small quantities, but as soon as its potential large profits were realized, criminal groups took over the trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|2010|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet Union created Central Asian states, often without ethnic or topographical considerations, causing them to be notoriously weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cornell|Swanström|2006|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the downfall of the Soviet Union’s, poor border delimitations, [[Economic transition|transition]] to a capitalist economy and absence of historical statehood, led the Central Asian economies to collapse and political situation to become chaotic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mohapatra|2007|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disadvantaged people in the region turned to the drug trade for profit and took advantage of the lack of border controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|2010|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drugs became and continue to be a major source of funding for Islamic militant groups and warlords trying to gain control in the region.&lt;ref name="Cornell_17"&gt;{{harvp|Cornell|Swanström|2006|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These militant groups, which the international community often deem as terrorist groups, use drugs to finance their campaigns. As Abdurahim Kakharov, a deputy interior minister of Tajikistan said in 2000 "terrorism, organized crime and the illegal drug trade are one interrelated problem.”&lt;ref name="Struck"/&gt; The [[Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan]] (IMU), classified as a terrorist organization by the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]] in 2000, is deeply involved with drug trafficking.&lt;ref name="Struck" /&gt; Although the IMU, whose power was at its peak in the late 1990s, claimed to fight against the region’s civil government in the name of the caliphate, it also appeared to be highly motivated by the drug trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mohapatra|2007|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMU had alliances with the [[Taliban]] government and al-Qaeda in Afghanistan along with members of Tajik government from fighting together in the [[Tajikistani Civil War|Tajik civil war]]. This allowed the IMU to easily transport drugs from Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Before the U.S military dismantled it in 2001, the IMU frequently made small incursions in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan around August, after the harvest of heroin. Arguably, the IMU used incursions to create instability in the states and distract law enforcement to more easily transport the new heroin harvests.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cornell|Swanström|2006|pp=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UNODC]] estimates that the IMU brought in 60 percent of the heroin traffic in the region. The IMU’s deep involvement in the drug trade indicates that it may have focused more on criminal activities than political and religious aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mohapatra|2007|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from militant groups, government officials at all levels are involved in the illicit drug trade in Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mohapatra|2007|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse of economies post-Soviet Union leads many low-paid government authorities to corruption. They are often given bribes to look the other way as smugglers transport drugs through the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cornell|Swanström|2006|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of retaliating violence from drug lords also factors in the corruption of low-level officials.&lt;ref name="Engvall_846"&gt;{{harvp|Engvall|2006|p=846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption in the region, however, has evolved from passive low-level bribing to the direct involvement of state institutions and senior government officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|2010|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the secretary of Tajikistan’s Security Council admitted that many of its government’s representatives are involved in the drug trade.&lt;ref name="Engvall_846"/&gt; Also pointing to high-level government corruption in the drug trade, Turkmenistan’s president, [[Saparmurat Niyazov]], publicly declared that smoking opium was healthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cornell|Swanström|2006|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central Asian state governments tend to have low drug confiscation levels, as officials only use the arrests to provide an appearance of fighting drugs and to ensure a state monopoly on the trade. For instance, although trafficking has increased since 2001, the number of opiate seizures in Uzbekistan fell from 3,617&amp;nbsp;kg in 2001 to 1,298&amp;nbsp;kg in 2008, while heroin confiscations remain constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|2010|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The illicit drug trade has created adverse social effects in Central Asia. The number of registered drug users in the region has increased dramatically since 1990 as the drug trafficking has made drugs more widely available, which in turn lowers the cost, promoting abuse.&lt;ref name="UNODC"/&gt; In 1996 there were about 40,000 registered drug users, while in 2006 there were over 100,000 registered users.&lt;ref name="Cornell_17"/&gt; This rapid increase in drug users is fueling the spread of HIV/AIDS in the region as users share needles and perform unprotected sex. It is estimated that 60-70 percent of newly registered HIV/AIDS cases are a result of using shared needles. The UNODC maintains that there has been a six-fold increase in HIV/AIDS cases since 2000 in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mohapatra|2007|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agreements and law ==
Luxembourg is a member of the [[European Union|EU]] and thus the EU directives are binding.

== Responsibility ==
According to the [[polluter pays principle]] the polluter has ecological and financial responsibility of the [[climate change]] consequences. The climate change is caused cumulatively and today's emissions will affect decades forward. There are statistics available that show both total values and per individual.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1386">'''Matija Ahacel''', also known in [[German language|German]] as ''Matthias Achazel'' (24 February 1779 – 23 September 1845), born '''Matija Kobentar''', was a [[Carinthian Slovene]] [[philologist]], [[publicist]], and collector of [[folk song]]s.

Ahacel was born in a peasant family in the village of [[Gorentschach]] ({{lang-sl|Gorenče}}) near the market town of [[Sankt Jakob im Rosental]] ({{lang-sl|Št. Jakob v Rožu}}) in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]]. He worked as professor of mathematics in the [[lyceum]] in [[Klagenfurt]]. He collaborated with [[Urban Jarnik]], [[Anton Janežič]] and [[Anton Martin Slomšek]] in preserving the folk traditions of Slovenes in Carinthia and in [[Lower Styria]]. In 1833 and 1838, he published a collection of folk songs under the title ''Pesme po Koroškim ino Štajarskem znane'' (Songs Known in Carinthia and in [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]]"). The third volume was published in 1858 by Slomšek.

Ahacel died in Klagenfurt.

{{History of Burma}}
The '''Pyu city states''' ({{lang-my|ပျူ မြို့ပြ နိုင်ငံများ}}) were a group of [[city-state]]s that existed from c. 2nd century [[Common Era|BCE]] to c. mid-11th century in present-day [[Upper Burma]] (Myanmar). The city-states were founded as part of the southward migration by the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]]-speaking Pyu people, the earliest inhabitants of Burma of whom records are extant.&lt;ref name=dgeh-8-10&gt;Hall 1960: 8–10&lt;/ref&gt; The thousand-year period, often referred to as the ''Pyu millennium'', linked the [[Bronze Age]] to the beginning of the ''classical states'' period when the [[Pagan Kingdom]] emerged in the late 9th century.

The city-states—five major walled cities and several smaller towns have been excavated—were all located in the three main irrigated regions of Upper Burma: the [[Mu River|Mu River Valley]], the [[Kyaukse District|Kyaukse plains]] and [[Minbu District|Minbu region]], around the confluence of the [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy]] and [[Chindwin River]]s. Part of an overland trade route between [[China]] and [[India]], the Pyu realm gradually expanded south. [[Hanlin, Burma|Halin]], founded in the 1st century AD at the northern edge of Upper Burma, was the largest and most important city until around the 7th or 8th century when it was superseded by Sri Ksetra (near modern [[Pyay]]) at the southern edge. Twice as large as Halin, Sri Ksetra was the largest and most influential Pyu centre.&lt;ref name=dgeh-8-10/&gt;

The Pyu culture was heavily influenced by trade with India, importing [[Buddhism]] as well as other cultural, architectural and political concepts, which would have an enduring influence on the [[Culture of Burma]] and political organisation.&lt;ref name=tmu-51-52&gt;Myint-U 2006: 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; The Pyu calendar, based on the [[Buddhist calendar]], later became the [[Burmese calendar]]. Recent scholarship, though yet not settled, suggests that the [[Pyu script]], based on the Indian [[Brahmi script]], may have been the source of the [[Burmese script]] used to write the [[Burmese language]].

The millennium-old civilisation came crashing down in the 9th century when the city-states were destroyed by repeated invasions from the [[Kingdom of Nanzhao]]. The [[Bamar people]], who came from Nanzhao, set up a garrison town at [[Bagan]] at the confluence of the Irrawaddy and Chindwin Rivers. Pyu settlements remained in Upper Burma for the next three centuries but the Pyu gradually were absorbed into the expanding [[Pagan Kingdom]]. The [[Pyu language (Burma)|Pyu language]] still existed until the late 12th century. By the 13th century, the Pyu had assumed the Burman ethnicity. The histories and legends of the Pyu were also incorporated to those of the Bamar.&lt;ref name=tmu-51-52/&gt;

Only the city-states of Halin, Beikthano and Sri Ksetra are designated as [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]], where the other sites can be added in the future for an extension nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1444|title=Pyu Ancient Cities|website=Ahc.unesco.org|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Based on limited archaeological evidence, it is inferred that the earliest cultures existed in Burma as early as 11,000 BCE, mainly in the central dry zone close to the Irrawaddy. The ''Anyathian'', Burma's Stone Age, existed around the same time as the lower and middle Paleolithic eras in Europe. Three caves located near [[Taunggyi]] at the foothills of the Shan Hills have yielded [[Neolithic]] artefacts dated 10-6000 BCE.&lt;ref name=rmc-1&gt;Cooler 2002: Chapter I: Prehistoric and Animist Periods&lt;/ref&gt;

About 1500 BCE, people in the region were turning copper into bronze, growing rice, and domesticating chickens and pigs; they were among the first people in the world to do so. By 500 BCE, iron-working settlements emerged in an area south of present-day [[Mandalay]]. Bronze-decorated coffins and burial sites filled with earthenware remains have been excavated.&lt;ref name=tmu-45&gt;Myint-U 2006: 45&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence at Samon River Valley south of Mandalay suggests rice-growing settlements that traded with [[China]] between 500 BCE and 200 CE.&lt;ref name=bh-1&gt;Hudson 2005: 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Circa 2nd century BCE, the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]]-speaking Pyu people began to enter the [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy River Valley]] from present-day [[Yunnan]] using the Tapain and [[Shweli River]]s. The original home of the Pyu is reconstructed to be [[Qinghai Lake]], which is located in the present-day provinces of [[Qinghai]] and [[Gansu]].&lt;ref name=ehm-236&gt;Moore 2007: 236&lt;/ref&gt; The Pyu, the earliest inhabitants of Burma of whom records are extant, went on to found settlements throughout the plains region centred on the confluence of the Irrawaddy and [[Chindwin River]]s that has been inhabited since the [[Paleolithic]].&lt;ref name=dgeh-8-10/&gt;&lt;ref name=mat-16&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 16&lt;/ref&gt; The Pyu realm was longer than wide, stretching from Sri Ksetra in the south to Halin in the north, Binnaka and Maingmaw to the east and probably Ayadawkye to the west. The [[Tang dynasty]]'s records report 18 Pyu states, nine of which were walled cities, covering 298 districts.&lt;ref name=mat-327&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 327&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological surveys have actually so far unearthed 12 walled cities, including five large walled cities, and several smaller non-fortified settlements, located at or near the three most important irrigated regions of precolonial Burma: the [[Mu River|Mu River Valley]] in the north, the [[Kyaukse District|Kyaukse plains]] in centre, and the [[Minbu District|Minbu region]] in the south and west of the former two.&lt;ref name=mat-18-19&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; The city-states were contemporaries of the [[Kingdom of Funan]] (Cambodia) and (perhaps) [[Champa]] (southern Vietnam), [[Dvaravati]] (Thailand), [[Tambralinga]] and [[Takua Pa District|Takuapa]] near the [[Kra Isthmus]], and [[Srivijaya]] (southeast [[Sumatra]]). All these statelets foreshadowed the rise of the "classical kingdoms" of Southeast Asia in the second millennium CE.&lt;ref name=mat-25-26&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;

==City-states==
[[File:East-Hem 800ad.jpg|thumb|left|Pyu realm circa 800 CE, before the advent of the Mranma]]

Of the 12 walled cities excavated thus far, five are the remains of largest Pyu states: Beikthano, Maingmaw, Binnaka, Halin and Sri Ksetra.

===Beikthano===
{{main|Beikthano}}
'''Beikthano''' ({{lang-my|ဗိဿနိုး}} {{IPA-my|beɪʔθənó|}}) situated in the irrigated Minbu region (near present-day [[Taungdwingyi]]) with direct land access to the well-watered Kyaukse plains to its northeast, is the oldest urban site so far discovered and scientifically excavated site. Its remains—the structures, pottery, artefacts, and human skeletons—date from 200 BCE to 100 CE. Named after the Hindu god [[Vishnu]], the city may be the first capital of a culturally and perhaps even politically uniform state in the history of Burma. It was a large fortified settlement, measuring approximately 300 hectares inside the rectangular (3&amp;nbsp;km by 1&amp;nbsp;km) walls. The walls and fortifications along it measured six meters thick, and are radiocarbon dated to a period between 180 BCE and 610 CE. Like most subsequent cities, the main entrance of the walls led to the palace, which faced east. Stupas and monastic buildings have also been excavated within the city walls.&lt;ref name=mat-18-19/&gt;&lt;ref name=mat-b-77&gt;Aung-Thwin 1996: 77&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maingmaw===
'''Maingmaw''' ({{my|မိုင်းမော}} {{IPA-my|máɪɴ mɔ́|}}; also '''Mong Mao'''), located in the Kyaukse region, was circular in shape, and has tentatively been dated to the first millennium BCE. At 2.5&amp;nbsp;km in diameter and 222 hectares, Maingmaw is one of the largest ancient cities on the entire Kyaukse plains. It has two inner enclosure walls, the outer of which is square while the inner one is circular. The plan of a circle within a square suggest a zodiac sign which represents a view of the heavens from the perspective of the sun, the manner in which 19th century Mandalay was also conceptualised. At almost dead centre, a 19th-century temple called Nandawya Paya, which was probably built upon the ruins of an ancient one. The city is bisected by a canal, thought to be contemporary to the city, though no scientific dating has confirmed it. Excavations—the first of which was carried out in 1979—have unearthed many artefacts, including jewellery, silver coins, and funerary urns. Many of the artefacts such as the coins and funerary urns are virtually identical to those found Beikthano and Binnaka.&lt;ref name=mat-18-19/&gt;

[[File:Pyu Realm.png|thumb|Pyu city-states circa 8th century; Pagan shown for comparison only, not contemporary to the Pyu cities.]]

===Binnaka===
'''Binnaka''' ({{my|ဘိန္နက}} {{IPA-my|bèɪɴnəka̰|}}) too was located in the Kyaukse region, and virtually identical to its neighbour Maingmaw in numerous ways. Its brick structures shared the same floor plan as those found at Beikthano and other Pyu sites. Excavations have recovered pre-Buddhist artefacts, gold necklaces, precious stone images of elephants, turtles and lions, distinctive Pyu pottery, terracotta tablets with writing that strongly resembled the [[Pyu script]], and various kinds of acid-etched onyx beads along with others made of amber and jade. Also excavated are distinctive silver coins identical to those found at Beikthano and Binnaka, stone moulds for casting silver and gold ornamental flowers, a gold armlet in association with a silver bowl that has Pyu writing on it, and funerary urns virtually identical to those found Beikthano and Binnaka.&lt;ref name=mat-18-19/&gt;

Both Maingmaw and Binnaka may have been contemporary of Beikthano. The chronicles, which do not mention Beikthano at all, do mention the two, though not specifically as Pyu cities. The chronicles state that the ruler of Binnaka was responsible for the fall of Tagaung, the city identified by the chronicles as the original home of Burmese speakers.&lt;ref name=mat-328&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 328&lt;/ref&gt; Binnaka was inhabited until about the 19th century, according to a Konbaung era palm-leaf ''sittan'' (record) discovered there.&lt;ref name=mat-18-19/&gt;

===Halin===
{{main|Hanlin, Burma}}
'''Halin''' or '''Halingyi''' ({{my|ဟန်လင်းကြီး}} {{IPA-my|həlɪ́ɴdʑí|}}), located in the Mu valley, one of the largest irrigated regions of precolonial Burma, is the northernmost Pyu city so far discovered. The earliest artefacts of Halin—city's wooden gates—are radiocarbon dated to 70 CE. The city was rectangular but with curved corners, and brick-walled. Excavated walls are approximately 3.2&amp;nbsp;km long on the north-south axis and 1.6&amp;nbsp;km on the east-west. At 664 hectares, the city was nearly twice the size of Beikthano. It has four main gates at the cardinal points, and a total of 12 gates, based on the zodiac. A river or canal ran through the city. Traces of a moat exist on all sides except the south, where it was probably not needed, as land was dammed there to create reservoirs.

This design of the city influenced the city planning of later Burmese cities and the Siamese city of [[Sukhothai (city)|Sukhothai]]. For example, the number of gates and configuration was also found in subsequent major Burmese capitals such as the 11th century Pagan and 19th century Mandalay. The city's configuration was also found at other contemporary cities such as Maingmaw and Beikthano in the Pyu realm and Danyawaddy and Wethali in Arakan as well as later cities such as Sukhothai, which emerged over a millennium later. Structural remains of temples at Halin show that the design of city's temples influenced the 11th to 13th century temples at Pagan. Excavated artefacts point to Halin's Pyu script to be the earliest writing in the Pyu realm (and in Burma). It was based on an earlier version of the Brahmi script (Mauryan and Guptan). Inscriptions at Sri Ksetra show a later version of the same script.&lt;ref name=mat-21-23&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 21–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Known for the production of [[salt]], a highly prized commodity in the first millennium, Halin was superseded by Sri Ksetra as the premier Pyu city-state circa 7th century. By the Chinese accounts, Halin remained an important Pyu centre until the 9th century when the Pyu realm came under repeated attacks from the [[Nanzhao Kingdom]]. The Chinese records state that the city was destroyed by the [[Nanzhao Kingdom|Nanzhao]] warriors in 832 CE, with 3000 of its inhabitants taken away. However, radiocarbon dating reveals human activity to about 870 CE, nearly four decades after the reported sack of the city.&lt;ref name=mat-21-23/&gt;

===Sri Ksetra===
{{main|Sri Ksetra Kingdom}}
[[File:20160810 Bawbawgyi Pogoda Sri Ksetra Pyay Myanmar 9252.jpg|thumb|Bawbawgyi Pagoda at Sri Ksetra, prototype of Pagan-era pagodas]]

'''Sri Ksetra''' or '''Thaye Khittaya''' ({{my|သရေခေတ္တရာ}} {{IPA-my|θəjè kʰɪʔtəjà|}}; lit., "Field of Fortune"&lt;ref name=mha-8&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 8&lt;/ref&gt; or "Field of Glory"&lt;ref name=mat-b-77/&gt;), located 8&amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[Pyay|Prome]] (Pyay) at present-day Hmawza village,&lt;ref name=mt-601&gt;Thein, Myanmar Times&lt;/ref&gt; was the last and southernmost Pyu capital. The city was founded between the 5th and 7th centuries,&lt;ref name=Coedes&gt;{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F. Vella|others= trans.Susan Brown Cowing|title= The Indianized States of Southeast Asia|year= 1968|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|isbn= 978-0-8248-0368-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|62–63,77}}although during two of the recent excavations, January to February 2015 and December 2015 to February 2016, led by Janice Stargardt in Yahanda mound at Sri Ksetra, sherds stamped with Buddhist motifs were found, dated from c. 340 +/- 30 CE.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/sri_ksetra/sri_ksetra|title=Sri Ksetra, Ancient Pyu City - Director Janice Stargardt — Department of Archaeology|website=Arch.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pyu culture cremation burials around 270 +/- 30 CE.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;. Sri Ksetra likely overtook Halin as the premier Pyu city by the 7th or 8th century, and retained that status until the Mranma arrived in the 9th century. The city was home to at least two dynasties, and maybe three. The first dynasty, called the Vikrama Dynasty, is believed to have launched the Pyu calendar, which later became the Burmese calendar, on 22 March 638.&lt;ref name=dgeh-8-10/&gt; The second dynasty was founded by King Duttabaung on 25 March 739 (11th waxing of Tagu 101 ME).&lt;ref name=mat-24-26&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 24–26&lt;/ref&gt;

Sri Ksetra is the largest Pyu site discovered thus far. (Only Beikthano and Sri Ksetra have been extensively excavated. Other important Pyu cities as Maingmaw and Binnaka could yield more artefacts with more extensive excavations.) It occupied a larger area than that of the 11th century Pagan or 19th century Mandalay. Circular in design, Sri Ksetra was more than 13&amp;nbsp;km in circumference and three to four km across, or about 1400 hectares of occupied area. The city's brick walls were 4.5 meters high, and had 12 gates with huge ''devas'' (deities) guarding the entrances and a pagoda at each of the four corners.&lt;ref name=mat-24-26/&gt;

It also has curving gateways, such as those found at Halin and Beikthano. In the centre of the city was what most scholars think represented the rectangular palace site, 518 meters by 343 meters, symbolising both a mandala and a ''zata'' (horoscope), like in Maingmaw.&lt;ref name=mat-24-26/&gt; Only the southern half of the city was taken up by the palace, monasteries and houses; the entire northern half consisted of rice fields. Together with the moats and walls, this arrangement ensured that the city could withstand a long siege by enemies.&lt;ref name=mha-10-11&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

Sri Ksetra was an important [[entrepôt]] between China and India. It was located on the Irrawaddy, not far from the sea as the Irrawaddy delta had not yet been formed. Ships from the Indian Ocean could come up to Prome to trade with the Pyu realm and China.&lt;ref name=mha-8/&gt; Trade with India brought deep cultural contacts. Sri Ksetra has yielded the most extensive remains of [[Theravada Buddhism]]. Religious art suggests several distinct occupations with earlier influences stemming from Southeast India and later influences from Southwest India while 9th century influences include those from the Nanzhao Kingdom.&lt;ref name=mat-24-26/&gt; Much of the Chinese account of the Pyu states was through Sri Ksetra. Chinese pilgrims [[Xuanzang]] in 648 and [[I Ching (monk)|Yijing]] in 675 mentioned Sri Ksetra in their accounts of Buddhist kingdoms of Southeast Asia. The Tang histories mention the arrival at the court of an embassy from the Pyu capital in 801.&lt;ref name=mha-20-21&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smaller settlements===
{{see also|Tagaung Kingdom}}

Many Pyu settlements have been found across Upper Burma. They include Wati (an urban area west of Maingmaw), Ayadawkye Ywa in the Mu valley, west of Halin and south of a recently discovered Bronze Age site called Nyaunggan, and several others in Myinmu township, which controls the mouth of the Mu river.&lt;ref name=mat-24-26/&gt; A small but politically significant Pyu site is [[Tagaung, Mandalay|Tagaung]] ({{my|တကောင်း}} {{IPA-my|dəɡáʊɴ|}}) in northern Burma (about 200-km north of [[Mandalay]]) where Pyu artefacts including funerary urns have been excavated. The significance is due to the fact that the Burmese chronicles identify Tagaung as the home of the first Burmese kingdom.&lt;ref name=mha-7&amp;16&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 7, 16&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from Beikthano and Sri Ksetra, most Pyu sites have not seen extensive or any excavation.&lt;ref name=mat-24-26/&gt;

The [[New History of the Tang]] states the kingdom of Mi-ch'en sent an embassy to China in 805, and was attacked by Nanchao in 835.&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|106}}

==Economy==

===Agriculture===
The economy of the Pyu city states was based on agriculture and trade. All important Pyu settlements were located in the three main irrigated regions of Upper Burma, centred on the confluence of the Irrawaddy and Chindwin rivers: Halin in the Mu valley, Maingmaw and Binnaka in the Kyaukse plains, finally Beikthano and Sri Ksetra at or near the Minbu district.&lt;ref name=mat-21-23/&gt; (The irrigation projects of the Pyu were later picked up by the Burmans. King [[Anawrahta]] of Pagan would build irrigation projects in these three regions in the 1050s to turn them into the main rice granaries of Upper Burma. They would give Upper Burma an enduring economic base from which to dominate the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery in the following centuries.&lt;ref name=geh-24-25&gt;Harvey 1925: 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;) The Pyu grew [[rice]], perhaps of the [[Japonica rice|Japonica]] variety.&lt;ref name=mat-26-27&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade===
The Pyu realm was an important trading centre between China and India in the first millennium CE. Two main trading routes passed through the Pyu states. As early as 128 BCE, an overland trade route between China and India existed across the northern Burma. An embassy from the Roman Empire to China passed through this route in 97 CE and again in 120 CE.&lt;ref name=mha-7&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 7&lt;/ref&gt; But the majority of the trade was conducted by sea through the southern Pyu states, which at the time were located not far from the sea as much of the Irrawaddy delta had not yet been formed, and as far south as upper [[Tenasserim coast]] towns such as Winga, Hsindat-Myindat, Sanpannagon and Mudon where Pyu artefacts have been found. (It is insufficient to conclude however that the Pyu had administrative and military control over these upper Tenasserim coastal towns.)&lt;ref name=mat-29-30&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; The ports connected the overland trade route to China via present-day [[Yunnan]].

The trading area of the Pyu states spanned across the present-day Southeast Asia, South Asia and China. Artifacts from the 2nd century northwest India to [[Java]] and the Philippines have been found at Beikthano.&lt;ref name=mat-29-30/&gt; Likewise, Pyu artefacts have been found along the coasts of [[Rakhine State|Arakan]], Lower Burma, and as far east as [[Óc Eo]] (in present-day southern [[Vietnam]]).&lt;ref name=mat-18&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 18&lt;/ref&gt; The Pyu also conducted trade and diplomatic relations with China. In 800 and 801–802, Sri Ksetra sent a formal embassy, along with 35 musicians to the Tang court. According to the Chinese, the Pyu used gold and silver coinage. But only silver coins have survived.&lt;ref name=mha-13&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Currency===
A notable feature of the Pyu states is the minting and use of silver coinage. Originated in the Pegu area, these coins date from the 5th century and were the model for most first millennium coinage in mainland Southeast Asia. The earliest type of these coins is not inscribed and depicts a conch on one side and a [[Srivatsa]] on the other. Many of the coins had a small hole along the perimeter, and may have also been used as amulets. Remarkably, after the use of coins ceased at the end of Pyu period in the late 9th century, coins did not reappear in the Burmese kingdoms until the 19th century.&lt;ref name=rmc-2&gt;Cooler 2002: Chapter II The Pre-Pagan Period: The Urban Age of the Mon and the Pyu&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==

===Religion===
[[File:Khasarpana Lokesvara.jpg|thumb|Avalokiteśvara holding a lotus flower. [[Bihar]], 9th century, CE. The Pyu followed a mix of religious traditions.]]

The culture of Pyu city states was heavily influenced by India. Indian culture was most visible in the southern Pyu realm through which most trade with India was conducted by sea. The names of southernmost cities were in [[Pali language|Pali]] or [[Sanskrit]] derived like Sri Ksetra (Thaye Khittaya) and Vishnu (Beikthano). The kings at Sri Ksetra titled themselves as Varmans and Varma. It was not just a southern phenomenon. To varying degrees, northern Pyu cities and towns also became under the sway of Indian culture. The Burmese chronicles claim that the founding kings of Tagaung were descended from no less than the [[Shakya|Sakya clan]] of the [[Buddha]] himself.&lt;ref name=mat-31-34&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 31–34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mha-15-17&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 15–17&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 4th century, most of the Pyu had become predominantly Buddhist, though archaeological finds prove that their pre-Buddhist practices remained firmly entrenched in the following centuries. According to the excavated texts, as well as the Chinese records, the predominant religion of the Pyu was [[Theravada Buddhism]]. The Theravada school prevalent in the Pyu realm was probably derived from the [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]] region in southeast India, associated with the famous Theravada Buddhist scholar, [[Buddhagosa]].&lt;ref name=mat-31-34/&gt;&lt;ref name=mha-15-17/&gt; It was the predominant Theravada school in Burma until the late 12th century when [[Shin Uttarajiva]] led the realignment with Ceylon's [[Mahavihara]] school.&lt;ref name=geh-55-56&gt;Harvey 1925: 55–56&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeological finds also indicate a widespread presence of [[Tantric Buddhism]], [[Mahayana Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. [[Avalokiteśvara]] (Lokanatha) (called ''Lawkanat'' in Burmese; {{my|လောကနတ်}} {{IPA-my|lɔ́ka̰ naʔ|}}), [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]], Manusi Buddhas, [[Vaiśravaṇa]], and [[Hayagriva]], all prominent in Mahayana Buddhism, were very much part of Pyu (and later the Pagan) iconography scene. Various Hindu Brahman iconography ranging from the Hindu trinity, [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]], to [[Garuda]] and [[Lakshmi]] have been found, especially in Lower Burma.&lt;ref name=mat-31-34/&gt;

Non-Theravada practices such as ceremonial cattle sacrifice and alcohol consumption were main stays of the Pyu life. Likewise, the greater prominence of nuns and female students than in the later eras may point to pre-Buddhist notions of female autonomy.&lt;ref name=vbl-116-117&gt;Lieberman 2003: 116–117&lt;/ref&gt; In melding of their pre-Buddhist practices to Buddhist ones, they placed the remains of their cremated dead in pottery and stone urns and buried them in or near isolated [[stupa]]s, a practice consistent with early Buddhist practices of interring the remains of holy personages in stupas.&lt;ref name=js-200&gt;Stargardt 1990: 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Though their religious beliefs was a syncretic mix of many backgrounds, probably like in the early Pagan period, the outlook of the Pyu reportedly was largely peaceful. Tang Chinese records{{which|date=September 2016}}{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} describe the Pyu as a humane and peaceful people to whom war was virtually unknown and who wore silk cotton instead of actually silk so that they would not have to kill silk worms, and that many Pyu boys entered the monastic life at seven to the age of 20.&lt;ref name=dgeh-8-10/&gt;&lt;ref name=mha-12&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 12&lt;/ref&gt; To be sure, this peaceful description by the Chinese was a snapshot of the Pyu realm, and may not represent the life in the city-states in general.

===Language and script===
{{Main|Pyu language (Burma)|Pyu script}}
[[File:Myazedi-Inscription-Pyu.JPG|thumb|The [[Myazedi inscription]] c. 1112–1113 in Pyu]]

The Pyu language was a [[Tibeto-Burman language|Tibeto-Burman]] language, related to [[Burmese language|Old Burmese]]. But it apparently co-existed with [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] as the court language. The Chinese records state that the 35 musicians that accompanied the Pyu embassy to the Tang court in 800–802 played music and sang in the ''Fan'' (Sanskrit) language. Many of the important inscriptions were written in Sanskrit and/or Pali, alongside the [[Pyu script]]. The Pyu sites have yielded a wide variety of Indian scripts from King [[Ashoka]]'s edicts written in north Indian Brahmi and [[Tamil Brahmi]], both dated to the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE, to the [[Gupta script]] and [[Kannada script]] dated to the 4th to 6th centuries CE.&lt;ref name=mat-35-36&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=geh-4&gt;Harvey 1925: 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calendar===
In addition to religion, the Pyu also imported science and astronomical expertise from India. The Chinese records also report that the Pyu knew how to make astronomical calculations.&lt;ref name=dgeh-8-10/&gt; The Pyu calendar was based on the [[Buddhist calendar]]. There were two eras in use. The first was the Sakra Era, which was adopted in the Pyu realm in 80 CE, just two years after the new era had come into use in India. A second calendar was adopted at Sri Ksetra in 638, superseding the Sakra Era. The calendar, the first day of which was 22 March 638, later became the [[Burmese calendar]], and is still in use in present-day Myanmar. (The existence of two Pyu calendars has been cause for dispute among scholars trying interpret the dates on the finds.)&lt;ref name=mha-18-19&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

===Irrigation structures===
The Pyu-era architectural practices greatly influenced later Pagan and Burmese architecture. The techniques of building dams, canals and weirs found in pre-colonial Upper Burma trace their origins to the Pyu era and the Pagan era. (Burmans likely introduced new water management methods, especially the canal building techniques which became the prevailing method of irrigation in the Pagan era.)&lt;ref name=mat-26-27/&gt;

===City planning===
The Pyu city plans, consisted of square/rectangles and circles, were a mix of indigenous and Indian designs. It is believed that circular patterns inside the cities were Pyu while the rectangle or square shape of the outer walls and the use of 12 gates were Indian in origin. According to historian Cooler, "the adoption of Indian concepts of city planning incorporated a belief in the efficacy of the world axis that connects the centermost point in a properly constructed Mandala city with the city of the Gods above ([[Tavatimsa]] heaven) in order to assure prosperity throughout the kingdom below".&lt;ref name=rmc-2/&gt; Pyu-era city practices were the forefathers of the latter-day Burmese city and palace designs down to the 19th century Mandalay.&lt;ref name=mat-30-31/&gt;

===Temple design===
[[File:Shwezigon.jpg|thumb|Shwezigon Pagoda (built in the 11th century) at Pagan, based on earlier Pyu design]]

From the 4th century onward, the Pyu built many Buddhist [[stupa]]s and other religious buildings. The styles, ground plans, even the brick size and construction techniques of these buildings point to the Andhra region, particularly [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] and [[Nagarjunakonda]] in present-day southeastern India. Some evidence of Ceylonese contact is seen by the presence of Anuradhapura style "moonstones" discovered at Beikthano and Halin. By perhaps the 7th century, tall cylindrical stupas such as the Bawbawgyi, Payagyi and Payama had emerged at Sri Ksetra.&lt;ref name=mat-30-31&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pyu architecture greatly influenced later Burmese Buddhist temple designs. For example, temples at Sri Ksetra such as the Bebe and Lemyethna were prototypes for the later hollow (''gu'') temples of Pagan. The floor plan of the 13th century Somingyi Monastery at Pagan was largely identical to that of a 4th-century monastery at Beikthano. The solid stupas of Sri Ksetra were in turn prototypes for Pagan's such as the [[Shwezigon Pagoda|Shwezigon]], [[Shwesandaw Pagoda (Bagan)|Shwehsandaw]], and [[Mingalazedi Pagoda|Mingalazedi]], and ultimately, the [[Shwedagon Pagoda|Shwedagon]] in modern Yangon.&lt;ref name=mat-30-31/&gt;

==Demography==
The city-states were mainly populated by the Tibeto-Burman-speaking [[Pyu people]], who like their cousins Burmans are believed to have migrated from the present [[Qinghai province|Qinghai]] and [[Gansu province]]s in north-central China, via [[Yunnan]].&lt;ref name=ehm-236/&gt;&lt;ref name=geh-3&gt;Harvey 1925: 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=degh-11&gt;Hall 1960: 11&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive external trade attracted sizeable communities of Indians and the [[Mon people|Mon]], especially in the south. In the north, trickles of Burmans may have entered the Pyu realm from Yunnan as early as the 7th century. (Modern scholarship however holds that Burmans did not arrive in large numbers until the mid-to-late 9th century, and perhaps as late as the 10th century, according to radiocarbon dating of Pagan's walls.)

The size of population of the Pyu realm was probably a few hundred thousand, given that the 17th and 18th century Burma (about the size of present-day Myanmar) only had about 2 million people.

==Administration==
The Pyu settlements were ruled by independent chiefs. The chiefs at larger city-states later styled themselves as kings, and established courts largely modelled after the Indian (Hindu) concepts of monarchy. Not all Hindu concepts such as [[divine kingship]] were fully adopted due to the presence of Theravada Buddhism. It is not clear if a vassalage-overlord relationship existed between the larger city-states and smaller towns. The Burmese chronicles mention alliances between the states such as one between Beikthano and Sri Ksetra. By and large, each Pyu city-state appeared to have controlled just the city itself.&lt;ref name=mha-15-16&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

The large size of the Pyu cities (660 to 1400 hectares) vis-a-vis Pagan (only 140 hectares) suggests that much of the population resided within the walls, as corroborated by the Chinese records.&lt;ref name=mat-40&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 40&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeology in Pagan produced Pyu artefacts across a number of the settlements in the enclosed complex dating to the first millennium, until approximately 1100 C.E. when a shift to a monument-rich state and diffusion beyond walled boundaries is evident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hudson|first=B.|author2=Nyein, L. |author3=Maung, W. |title=The origins of Bagan: new dates and old inhabitants|journal=Asian Perspectives|date=2001|volume=40|issue=1|pages=48–74|doi=10.1353/asi.2001.0009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline of Pyu city-states==
It was a long-lasting civilisation that lasted nearly a millennium to the early 9th century until a new group of "swift horsemen" from the north, the ([[Bamar|Mranma]]) (Burmans) of the [[Nanzhao Kingdom]] entered the upper  Irrawaddy valley through a series of raids. According to the Tang Dynasty chronicles, the Nanzhao began their raids of Upper Burma starting as early as 754&lt;ref name=geh-13-15&gt;Harvey 1925: 13–15&lt;/ref&gt; or 760.&lt;ref name=dgeh-8-10/&gt; By 763, the Nanzhao king Ko-lo-feng had conquered the upper Irrawaddy Valley.&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|95}}  Nanzhao raids intensified in the 9th century, with the Nanzhao raiding in 800-802, and again in 808-809. Finally, according to the Chinese, in 832, the Nanzhao warriors overran the Pyu country, and took away 3000 Pyu prisoners from Halin.&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|105}} (In 835, the Chinese records say the Nanzhao also raided a state, generally identified by some but not universally accepted to be a Pyu state.)

To be sure, the Pyu and their culture did not disappear just because 3000 of them were taken away. The size of the Pyu realm and its many walled cities throughout the land indicates a population many times over. Indeed, no firm indications at Sri Ksetra or at any other Pyu site exist to suggest a violent overthrow. It is more likely that these raids significantly weakened the Pyu states, enabling the Burmans to move into Pyu territories.&lt;ref name=rmc-2/&gt; At any rate, evidence shows that the actual pace of Burman migration into the Pyu realm was gradual. Radiocarbon dating shows that human activity existed until c. 870 at Halin, the subject of the 832 Nanzhao raid.&lt;ref name=mat-36-37&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; The Burmese chronicles claim the Burmans founded the fortified city of [[Bagan|Pagan]] (Bagan) in 849 but the oldest radiocarbon dated evidence at Pagan (old walls) points to 980 CE while the main walls point to circa 1020 CE, just 24 years earlier than the beginning of the reign of [[Anawrahta]], the founder of Pagan Empire.&lt;ref name=mat-38&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 38&lt;/ref&gt;

At any rate, the Burmans had overtaken the leadership of the Pyu realm by the late 10th century, and went on to found the [[Pagan Empire]] in the middle of the 11th century, unifying the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery for the first time. Nonetheless, the Pyu had left an indelible mark on Pagan whose Burman rulers would incorporate the histories and legends of the Pyu as their own. The Burman kings of Pagan claimed descent from the kings of Sri Ksetra and Tagaung as far back as 850 BCE—a claim dismissed by most modern scholars.&lt;ref name=rmc-2/&gt;&lt;ref name=degh-7&gt;Hall 1960: 7&lt;/ref&gt; Pyu settlements remained in Upper Burma for the next three centuries but the Pyu gradually were absorbed and assimilated into the expanding Pagan Empire. The Pyu language still existed until the late 12th century but by the 13th century, the Pyu had assumed the Burman ethnicity and disappeared into history.&lt;ref name=tmu-51-52/&gt;

==Current status of the finds==
Aside from Sri Ksetra and Beikthano, the rest of the Pyu sites have not been extensively excavated. The care of the sites falls under the purview of the [[Ministry of Culture (Burma)|Ministry of Culture]]'s Department of Archaeology. In November 2011, the Department reportedly was planning a museum at Sri Ksetra, and working with the [[UNESCO]] to gain recognition for Sri Ksetra, Beikthano and Halin as [[World Heritage sites]] and the three old cities were recognised as World Heritage sites in 2014.&lt;ref name=mt-601/&gt;

'''Radio Azadi''' (formerly Radio Free Afghanistan) is the Afghan branch of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government's]] [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty's (RFE/RL)]] external broadcast services. It broadcasts 12 hours daily as part of a 24-hour stream of programming in conjunction with [[Voice of America]] (VOA). Radio Free Afghanistan first aired in [[Afghanistan]] from 1985 to 1993 and was re-launched in January 2002. Radio Azadi produces a variety of cultural, political, and informational programs that are transmitted to listeners via [[shortwave radio]], satellite and [[AM broadcasting|AM]] and [[FM broadcasting|FM]] signals provided by the [[International Broadcasting Bureau]]. According to Radio Azadi, their mission is "to promote and sustain democratic values and institutions in Afghanistan by disseminating news, factual information and ideas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/section/Afghanistan/149.html/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423235132/http://www.rferl.org/section/Afghanistan/149.html |archivedate=2012-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present==
The [[U.S. Congress]] appropriated funding for broadcasting to [[Afghanistan]] in December 2001 as part of an effort to build a peaceful and [[democracy|democratic]] country, following the U.S.-led ouster of the [[Taliban regime]]. Radio Free Afghanistan has since built a substantial audience in Afghanistan, with surveys showing it as the most popular radio station in the country. Radio Azadi produces a variety of programming—from special programs for youth and women to political satires and music and literary programs.

Recently Radio Azadi conducted a joint seminar with [[Kabul University]]'s School of Journalism on “Media and Democracy."&lt;ref&gt;Noticias De La Radio Website http://yimber-gaviria.blogspot.com/2009/12/czech-republic-radio-azadi-trains-next.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radio Azadi Fact Sheet. http://www.rferl.org/info/Afghanistan/181.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media environment in Afghanistan==
[[Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty]] journalists in Afghanistan are under constant threat of intimidation from warlords, the Taliban, and other extremists. Attempts have also been made to tighten media control in the name of "respect for Islamic values." Concurrently, the number of private television and radio stations has grown in Afghanistan, leading to increased competition among media operating in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index, 2009: 149th/175. {{cite web |url=http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/classement_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122122758/http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/classement_en.pdf |archivedate=2009-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty first launched this service on October 1, 1985 during the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (1979–1989)]]. Its purpose was "to bring objective and uncensored news and information to the population and resistance forces of Soviet-occupied Afghanistan." &lt;ref&gt;James Clarity and Warren Weaver, "Briefing; Come In, Afghanistan," ''The New York Times''. October 1, 1985 https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E1DA1239F932A35753C1A963948260&lt;/ref&gt; The service initially consisted of twice-weekly thirty-minute broadcasts in Dari and later expanded to hour-long broadcasts five days a week in [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and [[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Dari]]. Radio Free Afghanistan was the first expansion of RFE/RL's broadcast area in thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;Sosin, Gene, ''Sparks of Liberty: An Insider's Memoir of Radio Liberty'' (University Park: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999):196.&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcasts stopped in 1993 for budgetary purposes and began again in 2001 following the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. Invasion of Afghanistan]]. Congress authorized the appropriation of eight million dollars in operating costs for [[Fiscal Year|FY]] 2002 and nine million dollars in capital costs that would fund the construction of a new [[shortwave|shortwave transmitter]] in [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref&gt;Senate Report 107-125- Authorization of Radio Free Afghanistan.

In the run-up to Afghanistan’s presidential elections in 2009, Radio Azadi hosted a historic presidential debate featuring President [[Hamid Karzai]] and two of his leading contenders. It was Afghanistan’s first-ever debate to feature an incumbent president and was televised on Afghan national TV.&lt;ref&gt;Afghan Press Online {{cite web |url=http://www.aopnews.com/lotw/elections2009.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424014727/http://www.aopnews.com/lotw/elections2009.shtml |archivedate=2010-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Congress appropriated six million dollars of additional funding to allow Radio Azadi to begin broadcasting to the [[Pashto language|Pashto]]-speaking border regions on the [[Afghanistan–Pakistan border]].&lt;ref&gt;Washington Watch http://www.washingtonwatch.com/bills/show/ED_7116.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, U.S. [[Secretary of State Hillary Clinton]] responded to questions submitted by listeners in Afghanistan during an interview in Radio Azadi's studios in Prague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/classement_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122122758/http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/classement_en.pdf |archivedate=2009-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rice pudding''' is a dish made from [[rice]] mixed with water or [[milk]] and other ingredients such as [[cinnamon]] and [[raisin]]s. Variants are used for either desserts or dinners. When used as a [[dessert]], it is commonly combined with a sweetener such as [[sugar]]. Such desserts are found on many continents, especially Asia where rice is a staple. Some variants are thickened only with the rice starch, others include eggs, making them a kind of [[custard]].

==Rice pudding around the world==
[[File:Arros amb llet.jpg|thumb|''Arroz con leche'' (rice with milk) is the Spanish and Hispanic American type of rice pudding. Leftover rice is often used, especially in restaurants.]]

Rice puddings are found in nearly every area of the world.  Recipes can greatly vary even within a single country. The dessert can be boiled or baked. Different types of pudding vary depending on preparation methods and the selected ingredients. The following ingredients are usually found in rice puddings:
*[[rice]]; white rice (usually short grain, but can also be long grain, [[broken rice]], [[basmati]], or [[jasmine rice]]), [[brown rice]], [[black rice]]
*[[milk]] ([[whole milk]], [[coconut milk]], [[cream]] or [[evaporated milk|evaporated]])
*[[spice]]s ([[cardamom]], [[nutmeg]], [[cinnamon]], [[ginger]], etc.)
*[[flavor]]ings and toppings ([[vanilla]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]], [[lemon]], [[rose water]]; [[pistachio]], [[almond]], [[cashew]], [[raisin]], [[walnut]], etc.)
*[[sweetness|sweetener]] ([[sugar]], [[brown sugar]], [[honey]], [[condensed milk|sweetened condensed milk]], [[date (fruit)|dates]], [[fruit]] or syrups)
*[[egg (food)|eggs]] (sometimes)

The following is a list of various rice puddings grouped by place of origin.

===Middle East and North Africa===
*''[[Meghli|Moghli]]'' (Lebanese) with [[anise]], [[caraway]], and cinnamon
*''Muhalibiyya'' (Arabic) with milk, rice flour, sugar, and rosewater
*''Riz bi haleeb'' ([[Levantine Arabic|Levantine]]) or ''ruz bil-laban'' ([[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]]), (lit. "rice-with-milk") with [[rosewater]] and occasionally [[mastic (plant resin)|mastic]]
*''Zarda wa haleeb'' (Iraqi) rice prepared with [[Rub (syrup)|date syrup]] served in the same dish as with rice prepared with milk

Many dishes resembling rice pudding can be found in [[Southeast Asia]], many of which have Chinese influences. Owing to Chinese usage, they are almost never referred to as rice pudding by the local populations (whether ethnic Chinese origin or not) but instead called sweet rice porridge. The term "pudding" in various modern [[East Asia]]n languages denotes a cornstarch or gelatin-based jelly-like set dessert, such as [[mango pudding]]. The rice pudding dishes that follow are explicitly referred to as such by the originating cultures.

===Canada and the United States===
In Canada and the United States, most recipes come from European immigrants. In the latter half of the twentieth century, Asian, Middle Eastern, and Latin American recipes have also become more common. In [[New England]], a popular pudding is made with long grain rice, milk, sugar, or in [[Vermont]], [[maple syrup]]. This may be combined with nutmeg, cinnamon, and/or raisins. The pudding is usually partially cooked on top of the stove in a double boiler, and then "finished" in an oven.

====Nordic countries====
[[File:Risifrutti på Konsum 2015.jpg|thumb|Store bought rice pudding]]
In the [[Nordic countries]], rice porridge is a common dinner, and sometimes breakfast. It is made as a warm dish from rice cooked in milk. When served, it is commonly sprinkled with cinnamon, sugar and a small knob of butter, and served with milk or fruit juice. In Iceland, it is sometimes served with cold ''slátur'', a type of liver sausage. In different languages it is called ''risengrød'' (Danish), ''risengrynsgrøt'' (Norwegian), ''risgrynsgröt'' (Swedish), ''riisipuuro'' (Finnish),  ''grjónagrautur'', ''hrísgrautur'' or ''hrísgrjónagrautur'' (Icelandic), and ''rísgreytur'' (Faroese).

The rice porridge dinner is used as a basis for rice cream dessert. There are many different variants of this dessert but the basis is the same: cold rice porridge (the dinner variant) is mixed with [[whipped cream]] and sweetened. In Sweden, it is sometimes mixed with [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]] and is then called ''apelsinris''. ''[[Risalamande]]'' (Danish, after French ''riz à l'amande'', rice with almonds) is cold risengrød with [[whipped cream]], [[vanilla]], and chopped [[almond]], often served with hot or chilled cherry (or strawberry) sauce. In [[Norway]], the dessert is called ''riskrem'' and sometimes served with red sauce (usually made from strawberries or raspberries). Rice cream dessert is called ''ris à la Malta'' in Sweden, while what is referred to as ''risgrynspudding'' is made with eggs instead of cream.

In [[Scandinavia]], rice pudding has long been a part of [[Christmas]] tradition, in some countries referred to as ''julegröt/julegrøt/julegrød/joulupuuro'' (Yule porridge) or ''tomtegröt/nissegrød''. The latter name is due to the old tradition of sharing the meal with the guardian of the homestead, called ''tomte'' or [[Tomte|nisse]] (see also [[blót]]). In [[Finland]] it is common to eat the Christmas rice porridge with a sauce made of dried [[prune]]s.

A particular Christmas tradition that is often associated with eating rice pudding or porridge is hiding a whole almond in the porridge. In Sweden and Finland, popular belief has it that the one who eats the almond will be in luck the following year. In Norway, Denmark, Iceland and the Faroe Islands, the one who finds it will get the [[almond present]] as a prize. In Denmark and the Faroe Islands, the almond tradition is usually done with risalamande served as dessert at Julefrokost (Christmas lunch) or on Christmas Eve. In Norway, it is commonly served as lunch or early dinner on Christmas Eve or the day before, ''lillejulaften'' ("Little Eve"). In Sweden and Finland, it is more commonly done with a rice porridge dinner, sometimes a few days before Christmas Eve.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, rice pudding is a traditional dessert and is very popular, though not universally so:
{{poemquote|What is the matter with Mary Jane?
She's perfectly well and she hasn't a pain,
And it's lovely rice pudding for dinner again!&lt;ref&gt;[[A. A. Milne]], "What is the matter with Mary Jane?"&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
The earliest rice pudding recipes were called ''whitepot'' and date from the Tudor period; one of the earliest recipes was written down by [[Gervase Markham]] in 1615.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historicalfoods.com/whitepot-rice-pudding-recipe Historical Foods Whitepot Recipe 1615] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624013033/http://historicalfoods.com/whitepot-rice-pudding-recipe |date=2011-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rice pudding is traditionally made with pudding rice, milk, cream, and sugar and is sometimes flavoured with vanilla, nutmeg, jam and/or cinnamon. It can be made in two ways: in a saucepan or by baking in the oven.

In a saucepan, it is made by gently simmering the milk and rice until tender, and then the sugar is carefully mixed in.  Finally, the cream is mixed in, and it can either be left to cool and be served at room temperature, or it can be heated and served hot. It should have a very creamy consistency.

[[File:Baked Rice Pudding.jpg|thumbnail|right|Rice pudding baked in the oven]]
When made in the oven, the pudding rice is placed into a baking dish, and the milk, cream and sugar are mixed in. The dish is then placed in the oven and baked at a low temperature for a few hours, until the rice is tender and the pudding has a creamy consistency. While cooking, the pudding may develop a thick crust, which adds an interesting [[Mouthfeel|texture]] to the pudding. It is traditional to sprinkle the top with finely grated nutmeg before baking. Using evaporated milk (9% milk fat), instead of whole milk, enriches the result and intensifies the caramelised flavour.

An alternative recipe frequently used in the north of England{{according to whom|date=October 2012}} uses butter instead of cream, adds a small pinch of salt, and requires the pudding mixture to stand for an hour or so prior to being cooked. Such puddings tend to set firmly when cooled, enabling slices to be cut and eaten like cake. If eaten hot, the pudding is traditionally served with cream poured on top in wealthy households, and with full fat milk where cream was not available. A spoonful of sweet jam or conserve is also a very popular topping for the pudding.

A specific type of rice is available and widely used for rice pudding called "pudding rice". Similar to [[Arborio rice]], its grain is round and short, and when cooked produces a creamier consistency than savoury rice. However, other short grained rice can be used as a substitute.

Ready-made, pre-cooked rice pudding sold in [[tin can]]s or pots is very widely available in most [[supermarket]]s and [[Retailing|shops]]. Because it is canned, it has a very long [[shelf life]]. A popular brand is [[Ambrosia (food)|Ambrosia]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2012}}. Some brands are made with skimmed (fat free) milk.

===Latin America and the Caribbean===
[[File:Arroz con leche argentino.jpg|thumb|Argentine ''arroz con leche'', a typical dessert.]]
*'''Arroz con dulce''' ([[Puerto Rican cuisine|Puerto Rican]]) Puerto Rican rice pudding is made with pearl rice. The rice is first rinsed until the water is clear and most of the starch has been removed, then it is left over night in water (this process makes it easier to cook and gives the rice better texture). Coconut milk, [[cream of coconut]], evaporated milk, cloves, ginger, raisins (soaked in rum), vanilla, cinnamon, sugar, nutmeg and the option of [[lemon]] zest is simmered until the coconut milk is infused with all spices. The rice is then drained and placed in a hot pot that has been coated in butter. The infused coconut milk is then poured on the rice and cooked until rice is tender and sticky. Coconut milk and cream can be replaced with more milk and cream cheese; pistachios can be substituted for raisins. Puerto Rican rice pudding is also popular in Colombia and Venezuela.
*'''Arroz con leche''' ([[Dominican Republic]]) made with milk, cinnamon, raisins, sugar, and lemon zest.

==In popular culture==
{{sources|section|date=March 2018}}
Buddhist Sutras state that [[Gautama Buddha]]'s final meal before his [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] was a large bowl of rice pudding, prepared for him by a girl named Sujata.

Rice pudding is mentioned frequently in literature of the Victorian and Edwardian eras, typically in the context of a cheap, plain, familiar food, often served to children or invalids, and often rendered boring by too-frequent inclusion in menus.

In [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]]'s ''Kenelm Chillingly'', a would-be host reassures a prospective guest: "Don't fear that you shall have only mutton-chops and a rice-pudding".  In [[Henry James]]' ''[[A Passionate Pilgrim]]'', the narrator laments: "having dreamed of lamb and [[spinach]] and a salade de saison, I sat down in penitence to a mutton-chop and a rice pudding".

[[Charles Dickens]] relates an incident of shabby treatment in ''A Schoolboy's Story:'' "it was imposing on Old Cheeseman to give him nothing but boiled mutton through a whole Vacation, but that was just like the system. When they didn't give him boiled mutton, they gave him rice pudding, pretending it was a treat. And saved the butcher."

In [[Ethel Turner]]'s ''[[Seven Little Australians]]'', the children express dissatisfaction with their food. "My father and Esther&amp;nbsp;... are having roast fowl, three vegetables, and four kinds of pudding", Pip says angrily. "It isn't fair!" His sister notes that "we had dinner at one o'clock". "Boiled mutton and carrots and rice pudding!" her brother replies, witheringly.

In [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'', reference to the combination of mutton and rice pudding is once again made - "his two eldest boys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for".

''Rice Pudding'' is the title and subject of a poem by [[A. A. Milne]], in which the narrator professes puzzlement as to what is the matter with Mary Jane, who is "crying with all her might and main/And she won't eat her dinner—rice pudding again—/What is the matter with Mary Jane?"

[[T.S. Eliot]], in the poem "[[Bustopher Jones]]: The Cat About Town", writes: "If he looks full of gloom/Then he's lunched at The Tomb/On cabbage, rice pudding, and mutton."

Rice pudding is mentioned with much more affection in an incident related by [[Walt Whitman]] in ''[[Specimen Days]]''.  Whitman visited an invalid soldier who "was very sick, with no appetite&amp;nbsp;... he confess'd that he had a hankering for a good home-made rice pudding—thought he could relish it better than anything&amp;nbsp;... I soon procured B. his rice pudding.  A Washington lady, (Mrs. O'C.), hearing his wish, made the pudding herself, and I took it up to him the next day. He subsequently told me he lived upon it for three or four days."

In the play ''[[Arcadia (play)|Arcadia]]'' by [[Tom Stoppard]], Thomasina Coverly uses the example of stirring jam into rice pudding as an illustration of [[Chaos theory|chaos]]. She wonders why it is not possible to separate the jam from the pudding by stirring backwards. Her tutor Septimus Hodge asserts that it is because our universe is deterministic, according to the theories of [[Isaac Newton]].

In ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' by [[Douglas Adams]] the [[supercomputer]] [[Deep Thought (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)|Deep Thought]] derives the existence of rice pudding from [[first principles]]. This is to counterpoint between the complexity of Deep Thought and its task of exploring the eternal verities, with simplicity of the pudding.

On August 5, 2015, [[Adidas]] bought Runtastic for $239 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/08/05/adidas-buys-runtastic//?ncid=rss_semi|author=Jon Fingas|title=Adidas buys Runtastic to boost its fitness tech|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Adidas Just Bought A Little-known Running App|url=http://fortune.com/2015/08/05/adidas-buys-fitness-app-runtastic/|author=Daniel Roberts|magazine=Fortune|date=August 5, 2015|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first owner in history was Sovar. The initial idea was born during a project at the [[University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria]] for tracking sailboat races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Runtastic team in 2013|url=https://research2guidance.com/in-2013-we-already-have-more-than-14-million-downloads-thats-an-average-of-100000-downloads-per-day-interview-with-florian-gschwandtner-runtastic/|website=research2guidance|accessdate=May 26, 2018|author=Ralf-Gordon Jahns}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the target group was too small, the founders decided to focus on more popular sports, such as: running, biking, or walking. Subsequently, Florian Gschwandtner, Christian Kaar, René Giretzlehner, and Alfred Luger founded the company, Runtastic, in October 2009 in [[Pasching]], [[Austria]].

In August 2015, it was announced that [[Adidas]] had acquired Runtastic for €220 million ($240 million), this included the 50.1% stake Axel Springer bought in the company back in 2013, making Runtastic entirely owned by Adidas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Natasha Lomas|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/05/runtastic-acquired-by-adidas-for-240m/|title=Runtastic Acquired By Adidas For $240M|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|date=August 5, 2015|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
People can use Runtastic apps in combination with original Runtastic hardware to collect activity data directly within the app. Users can then synchronize the data to Runtastic.com for additional analysis, tracking and sharing.

===Apps===
Runtastic offers a range of apps that track outdoor, indoor, and fitness activities, primarily known for its namesake GPS fitness-tracking app. On November 12, 2015, Runtastic announced Runtastic Results, a bodyweight training app consisting of a 12-week customized bodyweight training plan, but also has standalone workouts that can be completed outside of the training plan. As of November 2015, Runtastic had surpassed 150 million downloads across its apps. With Runtastic mobile apps ([[iPhone]], [[iPad]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[Windows Phone]]), users can track their progress and set goals. The Runtastic app, the core product, tracks a variety of metrics, such as distance, time, pace, calorie consumption, and it is available in 18 languages.

===Social Fitness Platform===
Runtastic offers Runtastic.com as part of a comprehensive fitness platform, together with their mobiles apps and proprietary hardware. Here, users can find an even more complete and detailed analysis of their fitness activities. The information can be shared with friends and used to generate social interaction and encouragement. The fitness site is available in 12 languages. As of January 2014, over 25 million registered users access and make use of Runtastic.com on a regular basis.

===Hardware===
In the first quarter of 2012, Runtastic launched hardware products in order to broaden their reach in the health and fitness industry, rather than simply remaining a software development company.

This was a strategic move planned and carried out in accordance with Runtastic's vision and strategic planning. Providing users with hardware has contributed to Runtastic's growth and has offered the mobile-first company new streams of revenue. European users can purchase Runtastic hardware products in Runtastic's online shop and via select retailers. In the spring of 2013, Runtastic's hardware products became available for purchase in the United States via [[Amazon.com]].

In July 2014, Runtastic launched a 24-hour fitness tracker device, Orbit. The fitness band consists of a removable module and silicone band, and monitors activity and sleep quality. The device was also introduced with a new app to analyze physical activity and sleep cycles, Runtastic Me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.androidpolice.com/2014/08/11/hands-on-with-runtastics-first-fitness-tracking-band-the-orbit/|author=Cameron Summerson|title=Hands-On With Runtastic's First Fitness Tracking Band, The Orbit|date=August 11, 2014|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 4, 2015, Runtastic announced their second wearable device, Moment. A 24-hour wearable that looks like an analog watch but has their Orbit technology inside, tracking users steps, active minutes, calories burned, distance and sleep cycles. It also contains vibration alerts and an LED for notifications, Moment is also compatible with the same app as their Orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adario Strange|website=[[Mashable]]|url=https://mashable.com/2015/09/05/runtastic-moment/#i2GMsYvb6Pqi|title=Runtastic hides its new fitness tracker in a smartwatch|date=September 5, 2015|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The broad acceptance of multi-functional mobile devices generally helped reviews of products that make good use of all the extra functionality (e.g. GPS-tracking, audio and video recording and playback, web-syncing, social sharing). This can be seen in reviews of runtastic products, for example from ''[[The Verge]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Bryan Bishop |date= July 28, 2012 |title= Runtastic Pro for Android turns your running routines into movies courtesy of Google Earth |work= [[The Verge]] |url= https://www.theverge.com/2012/7/28/3197577/runtastic-pro-android-runs-into-movies-google-earth |accessdate= May 26, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; TechCrunch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Rip Empson |date= October 30, 2012 |title= Aiming To Be A Full-Service Fitness Platform, Runtastic Launches New Indoor App Suite; Hits 14M Downloads |publisher= [[TechCrunch]] |accessdate= May 26, 2018 |url= https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/30/aiming-to-be-a-full-service-fitness-platform-runtastic-launches-new-indoor-app-suite-hits-14m-downloads/}}&lt;/ref&gt; VentureBeat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Rebecca Grant |date= August 1, 2012 |title= Runtastic Pro lets you see and feel the burn with 3D video footage of workouts |website= [[VentureBeat]] |url= https://venturebeat.com/2012/08/01/runtastic-pro-lets-you-see-and-feel-the-burn-with-3d-video-footage-of-workouts/ |accessdate= May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or The Next Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2012/10/30/runtastic-sprints-past-14m-downloads-and-launches-four-new-fitness-apps-for-homebodies |author= Paul Sawer |date= October 30, 2012 |title= Runtastic sprints past 14m downloads, and launches four new fitness apps for homebodies |website= The Next Web |accessdate= May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York Times, in an article on mobile fitness apps, especially acknowledged the innovative character of the gamification elements of the runtastic-app: ''Runtastic’s interface has some qualities the others don’t (...) Athletes who allow themselves to be tracked can receive "applause" or a "Go, go, go!" over their headphones from viewers. A little creepy, but cool.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Tom Sims |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/11/sports/11iht-athlete11.html?_r=0 |date= August 10, 2012 |title= Global Athlete: Don't just map your run, Earn Points for It |work= [[The New York Times]] |publisher= [[The New York Times Company]] |accessdate= May 26, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
