'''BBC Redux''' is a [[BBC Research &amp; Development]] system that digitally records&lt;ref name="solon"/&gt; [[digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom|television and radio output in the United Kingdom]] produced by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]].&lt;ref name="bird"/&gt;{{rp|2}}  It has been operating since 2007&lt;ref name="solon"/&gt; and contains several [[petabyte]]s of recordings&lt;ref name="solon"/&gt; and subtitle data.&lt;ref name="solon"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-06/16/bbc-research-and-development?page=all|title=The people and projects inside the BBC's vast R&amp;D lab|first=Olivia|last=Solon|work=Wired|date=16 June 2011|accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is notable for being the [[proof of concept]] for the [[Flash video]] streaming version of the [[BBC iPlayer]].&lt;ref name="bird"/&gt;{{rp|15}}

==Technical details==
The system records over 100&amp;nbsp;megabits per second, continuously.&lt;ref name="bird"/&gt;{{rp|3}}  {{As of|2011|08}}, BBC Redux contained 300,000 hours of recorded audio and video.&lt;ref name="davies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staff.science.uva.nl/~kamps/entertainme/presentations/04-Sam.pdf|title=BBC R&amp;D – Archives Research|first1=Sam|last1=Davies|first2=Denise|last2=Bland|date=1 August 2011|accessdate=13 May 2012|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all regional variations are recorded; for [[BBC One]], only London and Northern Ireland variants are recorded.&lt;ref name="northwood"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/cnorthwood/status/203178939525509120|first=Chris|last=Northwood|date=17 May 2012|accessdate=20 May 2012|title=Gah, Redux only records BBC One London;|work=@cnorthwood|publisher=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of standard Digital Video Broadcasting terrestrial antennas and satellite dishes, coupled to [[DVB-T]] and [[DVB-S]] [[TV tuner card]]s are used to capture the incoming [[multiplex (TV)|DVB multiplexes]]&lt;ref name="tinworth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2012/04/the_uks_cultural_heritage_as_digital_pub.html|title=The UK's cultural heritage as digital public space|work=One Man and His Blog|first=Adam|last=Tinworth|date=20 April 2012|accessdate=13 May 2012|quote=BBC Redux is iPlayer on steroids – with an API.

As part of the European Union (EU) "NoTube" project running between 2009–12. a recommendation research system using [[Lonclass]] categorisation and [[Jaccard index#Tanimoto Similarity and Distance|Tanimoto coefficient]] matching was tested by the BBC R&amp;D Audience Experience team and integrated with 23,000 recordings delivered from Redux.&lt;ref name="notube"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://labs.notu.be/1/bbc/about.html|title=NoTube Archive Browser Experiment 1|work=NoTube Archive Browser|date=19 December 2011|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The matching dataset was gathered over a period of five months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://notube.tv/2011/10/14/algorithms-for-recommendations-in-various-n-screen-implementations/|title=Algorithms for recommendations in various N-Screen implementations|first=Libby|last=Miller|work=NoTube|date=14 October 2011|accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a BBC Digital Media Initiative (DMI) demonstration entitled "Million Minutes", files from the BBC's [[D-3 (video)|D-3 video tape]] archive were imported into the Redux system during 2009–2010.&lt;ref name="annual-2009-2010"/&gt;   This also used commercial software from [[Artesia Digital Media Group]] and involved creating a [[representational state transfer]] (REST) interface onto the content stored within Redux.&lt;ref name="james-archak"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://custard-cat.blogspot.co.uk/2009/11/archak-bbc-research-and-development.html|title=ArcHak|work=CustardCat|first=Bruce|last=James|date=5 November 2009|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jagiellonian Ms.Germ.Quart.16 (Gladiatoria) 01r.jpg|thumb|300px|''Gladiatoria'' fencing manual, 15th century, front cover with stamp ''Ex Biblioth. Regia Berolinensi.'']]
The '''''Berlinka''''' ('Berliner'), also '''Pruski skarb''' ('Prussian Treasure'), is the [[Polish language|Polish]] name for a collection of [[Germany|German]] original [[manuscript]]s originally kept at the [[Berlin State Library|Prussian State Library]] in [[Berlin]], which since the end of [[World War II]] are held by the [[Jagiellonian Library]] in [[Kraków]]. The legal status of the documents is subject of an ongoing debate.

==History==
During the Second World War from September 1942 onwards, German authorities moved the material from Berlin to the seized abbey of [[Krzeszów Abbey|Grüssau]] (present-day Krzeszów) in Prussian [[Province of Lower Silesia|Lower Silesia]], in order to protect it from [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[bombing of Berlin in World War II|strategic bombing]]. When the Lower Silesian territory east of the [[Oder–Neisse line]] fell under the administrative sovereignty of the [[People's Republic of Poland|Republic of Poland]] after the war, the Polish government secretly claimed the collection as [[war reparations]].&lt;ref name="GW2007"/&gt; In the winter of 1945/1946, the inventories were removed by Polish ''[[Milicja Obywatelska|milicja]]'' and thereafter transferred to Kraków.

In 1965, the Polish and the [[East Germany|East German]] government signed an agreement on the return of large collections of the Prussian State Library; however, the Polish authorities kept the ''Berlinka''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s existence at the Jagiellonian Library a secret until 1977, when Polish First Secretary [[Edward Gierek]] presenting his East German counterpart [[Erich Honecker]] with seven pieces of [[sheet music]], including Mozart's original score of ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' and Beethoven's notes for his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]],&lt;ref name="SPON-070808"&gt;{{de icon}}[[Der Spiegel]]: BEUTEKUNST-RÜCKGABE Polen stellt sich stur, 8 August 2007 [http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/0,1518,498915,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt; as a gift.

==Debate==
Since the jurisdiction of the [[former eastern territories of Germany]] was withdrawn by the 1945 [[Potsdam Agreement]],  Poland claims that it should retain ownership of the ''Berlinka'' as compensation for Polish cultural assets destroyed or [[World War II looting of Poland|looted by Germans during the Second World War]]; the total worth of Polish cultural heritage destroyed by [[Nazi Germany]], especially after the failed [[Warsaw Uprising]] in 1944, is estimated at 20 billion dollars.&lt;ref name="GW2007"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://serwisy.gazeta.pl/swiat/1,34239,4554829.html Rosjanie oddają skradzione dzieła sztuki], Gazeta Wyborcza, 2007-10-14&lt;/ref&gt; Some German media have referred to the ''Berlinka'' as the "last German [[prisoner of war]]". The German government claims that Poland is in violation of Article 56 of the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention of 1907]],&lt;ref name="FAZ-060726"&gt;{{de icon}}[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]: ''Rückgabe von Beutekunst - Die letzten deutschen Kriegsgefangenen'', 26 July 2007, [http://www.faz.net/s/RubEBED639C476B407798B1CE808F1F6632/Doc~E73D9568D79A14F7CB8686D42EC8ACD04~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html]&lt;/ref&gt; while the Polish side emphasizes the fact that the collections were not [[looted art|looted]], but were situated on Polish territory after the war.

After the [[Revolutions of 1989]], the Polish–German [[Treaty of Good Neighbourship]] was signed in 1991 and several negotiations have taken place in order to clarify and confirm the whereabouts of the ''Berlinka''. Poland has undertaken several initiatives, such as in 2000 when Foreign Minister [[Władysław Bartoszewski]] proposed establishing a Polish–German foundation that would take possession of such disputed collections. However, the German government refused – according to Bartoszewski, resulting from the fact that Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] did not realise the offer. While Germany each time is demanding that Poland return the ''Berlinka'' unconditionally, Poland refuses, claiming that Germany still has much Polish material looted during World War II, and that this should be returned to Poland in exchange.&lt;ref name="GW2007"/&gt;

In summer 2007, ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' magazine quoted German [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Foreign Office]] representative Julia Gross as saying that proceedings over the disposition had reached a low point. Earlier, Poland had stated that return is out of the question.&lt;ref name="SPON-070808"/&gt; In 2014 Germany returned to Poland the looted painting ''Palace Stairs'' by [[Francesco Guardi]]. With this gesture, Germany hopes to restart negotiations for the return of ''Berlinka''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26829148 | title=Germany returns art stolen by Nazis in 1939 to Poland | publisher=BBC News | date=31 March 2014 | accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
[[File:100 3493.JPG|thumb|Jagiellonian Library, Kraków]]
The ''Berlinka'' comprises some of the most valuable holdings of the former Prussian State Library. It includes over 500,000 medieval manuscripts, early modern printings and [[autograph]]s, including by [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and [[Johannes Calvin|Calvin]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]]. Among the holdings are notable letters from the large estate of [[Ludmilla Assing]] and her uncle [[Karl August Varnhagen von Ense]], personal copies of the ''[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]'' with hand-written notes by the [[Brothers Grimm]]&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} German TV HR: ''Handexemplare des Grimmschen Wörterbuchs in Krakau gefunden'' [https://archive.is/20090620212702/http://www.hr-online.de/website/rubriken/kultur/index.jsp?rubrik=5982&amp;key=standard_document_16755474 ]&lt;/ref&gt; and original musical scores by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and his sons, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] (''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]''), [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy|Mendelssohn-Bartholdy]], [[Niccolò Paganini|Paganini]], [[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]], [[Luigi Cherubini|Cherubini]], and [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]]. On the other hand, the collections also comprise many manuscripts and [[incunable]]s from Polish monasteries in [[Gniezno]], [[Lubiń, Kościan County|Lubiń]], [[Mogilno]], [[Pakość]], [[Gościkowo|Paradyż]], [[Pelplin]] and [[Poznań]], removed between 1820 and 1840 by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] authorities from the territories gained in the [[Partitions of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;''(...) do słynnej Pruskiej Biblioteki Państwowej w Berlinie włączono starodruki pochodzące z klasztorów w Gnieźnie, Lubiniu, Mogilnie, Pakości, Paradyżu, Pelplinie i Poznaniu.''&lt;br&gt; {{cite web  |author =Jan Pruszyński |url =http://www.wprost.pl/ar/70605/Kulturkampf/|title = Kulturkampf |work =www.wprost.pl |publisher =  |pages =  |page =  |date = |accessdate = 2009-11-21|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Listed under separate [[provenance]], the collections today are accessible for researchers and post-graduate students only. After a number of incunables from the Jagiellonian Library were found at auctions, user conditions were tightened again in 1999.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1433">The '''Blue sky memo''' was a document authored by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). The premise of the memo was to describe actions the CIA should undertake if it did not have to operate under legal, financial, and political restrictions (that is to say, if the "sky were blue").

The memorandum was inspired by the [[USS Cole bombing]], and written in the final weeks of the [[Clinton administration]]. It was delivered to [[Richard A. Clarke]] on December 29, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Byron York. [http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ODljNTQxMTU4NzAwMzgzYzEzNDdmMzQ5ZDQ2ZjFjNzA= Clinton and that "Comprehensive" Plan]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. September 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[9/11 Commission Report]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;No action was taken on these ideas in the few remaining weeks of the Clinton administration. [National Security Adviser Sandy] Berger did not recall seeing or being briefed on the Blue Sky memo. Nor was the memo discussed during the transition with incoming top Bush administration officials. [CIA Director George] Tenet and his deputy told us they pressed these ideas as options after the new administration took office.&lt;ref&gt;[[9/11 Commission Report]], Chapter 6. ([[s:9/11 Commission Report/Chapter 6|Wikisource text]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Boy Scout Handbook''''' is the official handbook of the [[Boy Scouts of America]]. It is a descendant of [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]]'s original handbook, ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'', which has been the basis for [[Scouting|Scout]] handbooks in many countries, with some variations to the text of the book depending on each country's codes and customs.

The original edition of the handbook was based on Baden-Powell's work. [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] combined his Woodcraft manual, the ''Birch Bark Rolls'', with Baden-Powell's ''Scouting for Boys''. Subsequent works were done by other authors. [[William Hillcourt|William "Green Bar Bill" Hillcourt]] wrote the 6th, 7th, and 9th editions. Frederick L. Hines wrote the 8th, and [[Robert Birkby]] the 10th, 11th and 12th editions.&lt;ref name="LibraryThing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Editions: Boy Scout Handbook by Boy Scouts of America|url=http://www.librarything.com/work/203231/editions/|website=LibraryThing|publisher=LibraryThing|accessdate=31 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407002523/http://www.librarything.com/work/203231/editions|archivedate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1910 original edition Handbook==
The first ''Official Handbook'', subtitled ''A Handbook of Woodcraft, Scouting, and Life-craft'' was published from July 1910 until March 1911 and appeared in eight distinct variations. It was written by [[Ernest Thompson Seton|Ernest Seton]] and drew greatly on [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]]'s ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'', it included information on the organization of Scouting, signs and signaling, and camping, as well as Scouting games and a description of several Scouting honours. Notably, this book did not place emphasis on first aid, knife and axe use, or map and compass work, as later editions would.  Because this edition was intended solely as a temporary guide until an authoritative handbook could be made, it is now known as the ''1910 Original Edition Handbook''.  The cover art was an illustration by Baden-Powell. There were about 28,000 copies printed, not 68,900 as previously thought.&lt;ref name=LibraryThing/&gt;&lt;ref name="v6n4"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott| first=David C.| year=2006| title=The Origins of BSA's 1910 Handbook| journal=International Scouting Collectors Association Journal (ISCA Journal) | volume=6| issue=4| pages=6–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First edition==
''The Official Handbook for Boys'' was [[publish]]ed in June 1911.&lt;ref name=LibraryThing/&gt; In this edition, the American Scouting program was standardized, albeit with many omissions and mistakes (cf. external links). As with the ''Original Edition'', many now-standard Scouting skills were passed over, including knife and axe use and map and compass work.

The book describes many Scout-like virtues and qualifications. After a lengthy section on what a Scout should know, including chivalry, history, and national issues, it is noted that "in short, to be a good Scout is to be a well-developed, well-informed boy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boy Scout Handbook Covers|url=http://scouting.org/media/anniversary/handbooks.html|website=Boy Scouts of America: 95 Years of Service|publisher=Boy Scouts of America|accessdate=9 June 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051001030958/http://scouting.org/media/anniversary/handbooks.html|archivedate=1 October 2005|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Ciyuan''''' or '''''Tz'u-yüan''''' is the earliest modern [[Chinese encyclopedia|encyclopedic]] Chinese [[Chinese dictionary|phrase dictionary]]. The [[Commercial Press]] published the first edition ''Ciyuan'' in 1915, and reissued it in various formats, including a 1931 supplement, and a fully revised 1979-1984 edition. The latest (3rd) edition was issued in 2015 to commemorate the centenary anniversary of its first publication.

==Contents and significance==
In [[Chinese dictionary#Terminology|terms]] of Chinese lexicography, the ''Ciyuan'' is a ''cidian'' ({{linktext|辭典}} "word/phrase dictionary") for spoken expressions, as opposed to a ''zidian'' ({{linktext|字典}}, lit. "character/logograph dictionary") for written [[Chinese character]]s.

The title word ''ciyuan'' 辭源 – which combines ''ci'' 辭 "take leave; decline; diction; phrase; word" and ''yuan'' 源 "source; cause; origin" – is an old variant for ''ciyuan'' 詞源 "word origin; etymology", usually written with ''ci'' 詞 "word; term; speech".

The ''Ciyuan'' has been popular with Chinese intellectuals. For example, (Reed 2011:3), during the [[Chinese Civil War]], [[Mao Zedong]] carried two modern dictionaries, the ''Ciyuan'' and the ''Cihai''.

The lexicographer [[Reinhard Hartmann]] (2003:16) predicts that the revised ''Ciyuan'' "should remain a basic research tool for all students of China's pre-modern literature and history for many years to come."

==History==
The ''Ciyuan'', which is the first major Chinese dictionary of the 20th century, has been republished and revised repeatedly.

===First edition===
Chinese lexicographers began compiling the first edition ''Ciyuan'' in 1908, with Lu Erkui (陸爾奎, 1862-1935) as [[editor-in-chief]]. They chiefly derived material from the 1710 ''[[Kangxi Dictionary]]'' and 1798 ''Jingji cuangu'' (經籍簒詁) dictionary of characters used in the [[Chinese classics]]. In 1915, Commercial Press, a major Chinese publishing house, issued the original ''Ciyuan'' in two volumes totaling 3,087 pages, available in large, medium, and small sizes (Teng &amp; Biggerstaff 1971:132).

It contained approximately 100,000 entries (Hartmann 2003:165), with [[Collation|dictionary order]] by individual character [[headword|head entries]] arranged by [[Collation#Radical-and-stroke sorting|radical and stroke]], using the traditional [[List of Kangxi radicals|214 Kangxi radicals]]. Phrase and compound entries are grouped under their first character, arranged firstly according to their number of characters, and secondly according to their radicals.

The ''Ciyuan'' included not only Chinese characters and phrases, but also ''[[chengyu]]'' idioms, classical references, and encyclopedic terms, such as Chinese and foreign personal and place names, book titles, and modern scientific terms. 
Its preface explained the lexicographical need for the ''Ciyuan''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In recent years new terms and new affairs have flooded into China. People from less-informed backgrounds find it hard to understand what "new learning" is about because of terms that are incomprehensible. Those who had classical knowledge often ended up giving up on new learning. On the other hand, those who went to study abroad did not understand what had already existed in their homeland when they returned. We therefore published this dictionary to indicate the history of and changes in the meanings of words, in the hopes of bridging that gap. (tr. Yue 2006:52) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Each entry was followed by its pronunciation (with ''[[fanqie]]'' spelling, a common [[homophone]], and modern [[Rhyme#Chinese|Chinese rhyme]]), meanings, and often with illustrative quotations from the Chinese classics. However, as [[Têng Ssu-yü]] and [[Knight Biggerstaff]] (1971:132) say, the first edition ''Ciyuan'' "is far from exhaustive, and most of its illustrative quotations were taken from secondary sources without being checked."

===Supplement===
In 1931 Commercial Press published the ''Ciyuan xubian'' (辭源續編 "Source of words continuation/sequel"), compiled by Fang Yi (方毅, 1916-1997) and others, in two volumes totaling 1,702 pages (Teng &amp; Biggerstaff 1971:132). This supplementary dictionary comprises terms accidentally omitted from the 1915 edition, and new terms coined after it. Fang Yi's preface explained the reason for publishing an extended edition of the ''Ciyuan'' in 1931: "Within more than a decade and following progressive developments in the world and changes within the political scene, it is natural that in science many new words have emerged" (tr. Tsou 1990:357). The ''Xubian'' also cites sources of quotations in more detail than the core ''Ciyuan'' dictionary.

The 1939 ''Ciyuan Zhengxu heding ben'' (辭源正續合訂本) was a new extended edition, combined into one volume (Yang 1985:275). The 1931 ''Ciyuan'' had 65,555 entries and the 1939 edition has 88,074, nearly a 35% net increase in words (Tsou 1990:358).

In 1969, Commercial Press in Taiwan published a one volume edition, with a [[Four-Corner Method]] index (Yang 1985:277).

===Revised edition===
Plans for a second edition ''Ciyuan'' began after a 1958 conference about revising the ''Ciyuan'' and ''[[Cihai]]'' dictionaries. Hartmann (2003:16) says, "It was decided to maintain ''Ciyuan'' 's emphasis on literary, historical and classical terms and to revise and augment it as a reference work for researchers and students of pre-modern Chinese."

In 1964, a ''weidinggao'' (未定稿 "draft manuscript") ''Ciyuan'' was completed, but the [[anti-intellectualism]] of the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966-1976) halted compilation. Work resumed in 1976 as a cooperative effort between the Commercial Press and language scholars in the provinces of [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], [[Hunan]], and [[Henan]]. The revised Volumes 1 through 4 were published in 1979, 1980, 1981, and 1984, respectively. The revised edition ''Ciyuan'' contains 12,980 head characters, under which are 84,134 definitions of phrases, totaling 11.3 million characters (Huang 1993:241). Volume 4 has a pinyin index attached.

Content of the new ''Ciyuan'' focuses on classical terms and encyclopedic items relating to [[Chinese literature]] and [[History of China|history]] up to 1840, the time of the [[First Opium War]] (Wilkinson 2000:78). The editors deleted technical terms from natural  and social sciences, and international words that had been appended into the original edition ''Ciyuan'' during 60 years of revisions and updates. They also added a number of important terms; for example (Hartmann 2003:16), "under the character "wei" ([委] "entrust; committee"), the original edition had 49 compounds, while the revised edition deletes 12 of these but adds 29 more." Since citations in the first edition ''Ciyuan'' were sometimes unclear as to sources, the editors of the revised edition rechecked every citation, corrected errors, and added references for authors and chapter numbers.

In 1988, Commercial Press published a reduced-size, single volume edition ''Ciyuan''.

===Third edition===
The third edition (辞源(第三版)) was published in 2015 following 8 years of editing.({{cite web|url=http://book.people.com.cn/n1/2015/1224/c69360-27972591.html|title=《辞源》出版百年 第三版全球同步首发|date=2015-12-24}})({{cite web|url=http://www.cp.com.cn/Content/2015/12-24/1244011737.html|title=快讯︱《辞源》第三版问世——九大修订、纸电同步|date=2015-12-24}})

However, the vocabulary range is not the same as in the Additionally revised Ciyuan (for example, [[baseball]] (棒球) is found in the Additionally revised Ciyuan, but not in the Continental edition Ciyuan revised edition), because the editors of the Ciyuan revised edition had switched the emphasis of Ciyuan to be a reference of old Chinese history and literature.

[[File:Encyclopaediaofscotland.jpg|right|thumb|175px|The cover of the 2nd edition of the ''Encyclopaedia'']]
'''''Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland''''' is a reference work published by [[Harper Collins]], edited by the husband and wife team, [[John Keay|John]] and [[Julia Keay]].

==History==
[[Scottish people|Scots]] had provided the impetus for a number of well-known references works, ''[[Chambers Dictionary]]'' and ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516205919/site=http://heritage.scotsman.com/ingenuity.cfm?id=634942005&amp;20050610140559 |date=May 16, 2007 |title=Scotland and the ultimate reference book }}, history of the ''Britannica'' on ''[[The Scotsman]]'s'' Heritage and Culture pages.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Herman | first = Arthur | year = 2002 | title = [[How the Scots Invented the Modern World]] | publisher = Three Rivers Press | isbn = 978-0-609-80999-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; amongst them (the latter still uses a Scottish [[thistle]] as a logo), but hitherto there had been no general purpose Scottish encyclopaedia.

==Statistics==
The encyclopaedia took seven years to compile and has appeared in two editions. The first edition, published in 1994, contained about a million words, nearly five hundred illustrations, and had 126 contributors, ranging from [[Derick Thomson]] to [[David Steel]], from [[Alan Bold]] to [[Neil MacCormick]] and from [[Joy Hendry]] to Sir [[William Macpherson]] of [[Cluny]]. It has four thousand individual entries, and an index indicating further references in other articles.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Jack (26 September 1994) [http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/couple-with-the-last-word-on-scotland-s-story-1.483557 "Couple with the last word on Scotland's story"]. Glasgow. ''The Herald''. Retrieved 17 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Articles==
{{references|section|date=February 2016}}
In the original edition, the first entry is [[Aaron Scotus]], and the last on the marquisate of [[Shetland|Zetland]] (the only Z entry).

The aim seems to have been to have reasonably brief entries on most topics, but subjects that get lengthier ones, include Scotland's major cities (including the traditional city of [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]]), [[football in Scotland|association football]] and [[Rugby union in Scotland|rugby in Scotland]], the [[Scottish Gaelic language]], [[Scots law]] etc. A wide variety of topics are dealt with, including figures from [[science]], [[literature]], [[philosophy]], [[sport]] and [[history]].

Less "obvious" topics which have entries include the Roman general [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]] (who tried to [[Roman invasion of Caledonia|invade Scotland]]), the [[hooded crow]], [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] (which  has a stormy past, lying right on the [[Anglo-Scottish Border]]) and [[medicinal plants]].

Several appendices cover the schisms (and mergers) of [[Church of Scotland|Scottish Presbyterian]] factions from 1700 to the date of publication, and also the [[Scottish royal line]].

==Second edition==
The second edition in 2000 contained over a hundred new articles,&lt;ref&gt;[[Neal Ascherson|Ascherson, Neal]] (10 December 2000) [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/dec/10/historybooks.nealascherson "Picts and stones"]. London. ''The Observer''. Retrieved 17 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; amongst them, ones on [[Billy Bremner]] the footballer, [[Dolly the Sheep]], the [[Scottish Parliament]] and the politician [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1347">The '''comparative case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''comp'''}}) is a [[grammatical case]] used in languages such as [[Mari language|Mari]] and [[Chechen language|Chechen]] to mark a likeness to something. 

It is not to be confused with the [[comparison (grammar)|comparative degree]], a much more widely used paradigm used to signify heightening of [[adjectives]] and [[adverbs]].

In Mari, the comparative case is marked with the suffix -ла ('-la')  For example, if something were to taste like fish (кол - 'kol'), the form used would be колла - 'kolla'). It is also used in regard to languages, when denoting the language a person is speaking, writing, or hearing. Then, however, the accentuation varies slightly from the standard case. Usually, the suffix is not stressed. When it is used with languages, however, it is stressed.

In Chechen, it is marked with the suffix ''-l''. For example, ''sha'' is 'ice', ''shiila'' is 'cold', and ''shal shiila'' is 'cold as ice'.

==Asian space powers==
{{See also|Timeline of first orbital launches by country}}

Of the ten countries that have independently [[Timeline of first orbital launches by country|successfully launched a satellite into orbit]], six are Asian: China, India, [[Iran]], Israel, Japan and [[North Korea]].

China's first manned spacecraft entered orbit in October 2003, making China the first Asian nation to [[human spaceflight|send a human]] into space.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news

India is expected  to demonstrate independent human spaceflight by 2020 and human landing on the moon by 2030,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.indianexpress.com/news/plan-panel-okays-isro-manned-space-flight/426945/= | title = Planning Commission Okays ISRO Manned Space Flight Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Iran and Japan have plans for independent manned spaceflights around 2020. China is also still predicting manned mission to the Earth moon by 2025 and to Mars by 2050.

While the achievements of space programs run by the main Asian space players (China, India, and Japan) pale in comparison to the milestones set by the former [[Soviet Union]] and the United States, some experts believe Asia may soon lead the world in space exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = Asia could win next 'Space Race', US scientists fear

At the same time, the existence of a space race in Asia is still debated due to the non-concurrence of space milestone events like there was for the United States and the Soviet Union. Japan for example was the first power on Earth to get a sample return mission from an asteroid. There was however some concurrence between China and India to see which of those two could be the first to launch a probe to the Earth's moon back in the late 2000s decade. China, for example, denies that there is an Asian space race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,307440,00.html | work=Fox News | date=2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2007 China became the first Asian military-space power to send an [[anti-satellite]] missile into orbit, to destroy an aging Chinese Feng Yun 1C [[weather satellite]] in polar orbit. The resulting explosion sent a wave of debris hurtling through space at more than 6&amp;nbsp;miles per second.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite news

After successful achievement of [[geostationary]] technology, India's [[ISRO]] launched its first Moon mission, [[Chandrayaan-1]] in October 2008, which discovered [[Lunar water|ice water on the Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Heated Space Race Under Way in Asia| url = http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=3041588}} ABC News&lt;/ref&gt; India then launched on 5 November 2013 its maiden interplanetary mission, the [[Mars Orbiter Mission]]. The primary objective is to determine Mars' atmospheric composition and attempt to detect methane. The spacecraft completed its journey on 24 September 2014 when it  entered its intended orbit around Mars, making India the first Asian country to successfully place a Mars orbiter and the only country in history to do so in the first attempt. ISRO became the fourth space agency in the world to send a spacecraft to Mars, only behind NASA, ROSMOS, and ESA.

In addition to increasing national pride, countries are commercially motivated to operate in space. Commercial satellites are launched for communications, weather forecasting, and atmospheric research. According to a report by the [[Space Frontier Foundation]] released in 2006, the "space economy" is estimated to be worth about $180&amp;nbsp;billion, with more than 60% of space-related economic activity coming from commercial goods and services.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news

===China===
{{Main article|Chinese space program}} 
China has a space program with an independent [[human spaceflight]] capability. It has developed a sizable family of successful [[Long March rockets]]. It has launched two lunar orbiters, [[Chang'e 1]] and [[Chang'e 2]]. On 2 December 2013, China launched a modified Long March 3B rocket, with [[Chang'e 3]] Moon lander and its rover Yutu on-board toward the Moon and successfully performed soft landing and rover operations, becoming the third country to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard David Space.com&lt;/ref&gt; It also has plans to retrieve samples by late 2017. In 2011, China embarked on a program to establish a manned [[space station]], starting with the launch of [[Tiangong 1]] and followed by [[Tiangong 2]] in 2016. China attempted to send a Mars orbiter ([[Yinghuo-1]]) in 2011 on a joint mission with Russia, which failed to leave Earth orbit. Nevertheless, the [[Mars Global Remote Sensing Orbiter and Small Rover|2020 Chinese Mars Mission]] with an orbiter, a lander and a rover has been approved by the government and is aiming a launch date in the year 2020.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; China has collaborative projects with Russia, [[ESA]], and [[Brazil]], and has launched commercial satellites for other countries. Some analysts suggest that the Chinese space program is linked to the nation's efforts at developing advanced military technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = China's man in space gets mixed reaction
 | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4276-chinas-man-in-space-gets-mixed-reaction.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China's advanced technology is the result of the integration of various related technological experiences. Early Chinese satellites, such as the [[Fanhui Shi Weixing|FSW]] series, have undergone many [[atmospheric reentry]] tests. In the 1990s China had commercial launches, resulting in more launch experiences and a high success rate after the 1990s. China has aimed to undertake scientific development in fields like Solar System exploration. China's Shenzhou 7 spacecraft successfully performed an [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] in September 2008. China's Shenzhou 9 spacecraft successfully performed a manned docking in June 2012. Furthermore, China's Chang'e 2 explorer became the first object to reach Sun-Earth Lagrangian point in August 2011 and also the first probe to explore both Moon and asteroid by making a flyby of the asteroid [[4179 Toutatis]]. China has launched [[Dark Matter Particle Explorer|DAMPE]], the most capable dark matter explorer to date in 2015, and world's first quantum communication satellite [[QUESS]] in 2016.

===India===

{{Main article|Indian Space Research Organisation}}

India's interest in space travel began in the early 1960s, when scientists launched a [[Nike-Apache]] rocket from [[Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station|TERLS]], [[Kerala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = The dawn of a new space race?| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4208176.stm | work=BBC News | date=2005-10-14 | accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thebetterindia.com/74283/first-rocket-india-thumba-vikram-sarabhai-abdul-kalam/|title=Transported on a Bicycle, Launched from a Church: The Amazing Story of India's First Rocket Launch|date=2016-11-08|work=The Better India|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Vikram Sarabhai]], the program focused on the practical uses of space in increasing the standard of living. Remote sensing and communications satellites were placed into orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = India Limbers Up for Space Race As Prime Minister Asks for the Moon| url = http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/1-29-2003-34579.asp| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030202055414/http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/1-29-2003-34579.asp| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2003-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just a few days after China said that it would send a human into orbit in the second half of 2003, Indian Prime Minister [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] publicly urged his country's scientists to work towards sending a man to the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = India 'on course' for the Moon| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2917271.stm | work=BBC News | date=2003-04-04 | accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It successfully sent its probe to the Moon in October 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = India and US to explore the Moon| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4753951.stm | work=BBC News | date=2006-05-09 | accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is planning its second Moon mission, [[Chandrayaan-2]] for 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = What is Chandrayaan-2?| url = http://www.chandrayaan-i.com/chandrayaan2/index2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = ISRO Completes "Scaled-Down" Test For Safe Landing Of Chandrayaan-2| URL = https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/isro-completes-scaled-down-test-for-safe-landing-of-chandrayaan-2-1938288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ISRO]] launched its [[Mars Orbiter Mission]] on November 5, 2013 (informally called "Mangalyaan") which successfully entered into the orbit around Mars on 24 September 2014. India is the first in Asia and fourth in the world to perform a successful Mars mission. It is also the only one to do so on the first attempt and at a record low cost of $74 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.btvin.com/videos/watch/8916/india%E2%80%99s-maiden-mars-mission-makes-history&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ISRO]] has demonstrated its re-entry technology and till date has launched as many as 175 foreign satellites belonging to global customers from 20 countries including US, Germany, France, Japan, Canada, U.K. All of these have been launched successfully by [[PSLV]]s so far, gaining significant expertise in space technologies. In June 2016, India set a record by launching 20 satellites simultaneously.&lt;ref name="20 Satellite launch"&gt;{{cite news|title=PSLV puts 20 satellites in orbit|url=http://m.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/isros-20in1-mission-top-10-facts/article8758848.ece|publisher=The Hindu|date=22 June 2016|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[PSLV]]s are also one of world's most reliable launch vehicles which clocked its 35th successful mission (39 total) in a row as of February 2017, thus having success rate of nearly 90%.

India broke the world record by successfully placing 104 satellites (almost tripling the Russian record of 37) in Earth Orbit on 15 February 2017 on a single rocket launch ([[PSLV-C37]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/world/asia/india-satellites-rocket.html|title=India Launches 104 Satellites From a Single Rocket, Ramping Up a Space Race|last=Barry|first=Ellen|date=2017-02-15|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-15|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4671532/india-space-launch-satellites-modi/|title=India Launches More Than 100 Satellites into Orbit|website=Time|access-date=2017-02-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215095824/http://time.com/4671532/india-space-launch-satellites-modi/|archive-date=2017-02-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese space shuttle [[HOPE-X]], to be launched by the conventional space launcher [[H-II]], was developed but the program was postponed and eventually cancelled. Then the simpler manned capsule [[Fuji (Spacecraft)|Fuji]] was proposed but not adopted. Pioneer projects of [[Single stage to orbit|single-stage to orbit]], [[reusable launch vehicle]] horizontal takeoff and landing ASSTS and [[VTOL|vertical takeoff and landing]] [[Kankoh-maru]] were developed but have not been adopted. A more conservative new ([[JAXA|JAXA manned spacecraft]]) project is proposed to launch by 2025 as part of the Japanese plan to send manned missions to the Moon.

Iran has developed its own satellite launch vehicle, named the [[Safir (rocket)|Safir]] SLV, based on the [[Shahab-1|Shahab]] series of [[IRBM]]s. On 2 February 2009, Iranian state television reported that Iran's first domestically made satellite [[Omid]] (from the Persian امید, meaning "Hope") had been successfully launched into [[low Earth orbit]] by a version of Iran's Safir rocket, the Safir-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE5120NN20090203 | work=Reuters | title=Iran launches satellite; U.S. expresses concern | date=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch coincided with the 30th anniversary of the [[Iranian Revolution]]. Iran is also developing a new launch vehicle [[Simorgh (rocket)]].

===Israel===
{{Main article|Israel Space Agency}}
Israel became the tenth country in the world to build its own satellite and launch it with its own launcher on 19 September 1988. Israel launched its first satellite, [[Ofeq]]-1, using an Israeli-built [[Shavit]] three-stage launch vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aerospaceguide.net/worldspace/israel.html |title=Israel in Space Program |publisher=Aerospaceguide.net |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528005045/http://www.aerospaceguide.net/worldspace/israel.html |archivedate=2013-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The launching was the high point of a process that began in 1983 with the establishment of the [[Israel Space Agency]] under the aegis of the Ministry of Science. Space research by university-based scientists began in the 1960s, providing a ready-made pool of experts for Israel's foray into space. Since then, local universities, research institutes, and private industry, backed by the Israel Space Agency, have made progress in space technology. The agency's role is to support "private and academic space projects, coordinate their efforts, initiate and develop international relations and projects, head integrative projects involving different bodies, and create public awareness for the importance of space development."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2003/6/Israel-s%20Space%20Program&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Korea===
{{Main article|National Aerospace Development Administration}}

[[DPRK|North Korea]] has many years of experience with rocket technology, which it has passed along to Pakistan and other countries. On December 12, 2012, North Korea placed its first satellite in orbit with the launch of [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 Unit 2]]. On 12 March 2009 North Korea signed the [[Outer Space Treaty]] and the [[Registration Convention]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2009/200903/news12/20090312-11ee.html |title=KCNA Report on DPRK's Accession to International Space Treaty and Convention |publisher=[[Korean Central News Agency|KCNA]] |date=2009-03-12 |accessdate=2009-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402023049/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2009/200903/news12/20090312-11ee.html |archivedate=2009-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; after a previous declaration of preparations for the launch of [[Kwangmyongsong-2]]. North Korea twice announced satellite launches: [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-1]] on 31 August 1998 and Kwangmyŏngsŏng-2 on 5 April 2009. Neither of these claims were confirmed by the rest of the world, but the United States and South Korea believe there were tests of military ballistic missiles. The North Korean space agency is the [[Korean Committee of Space Technology]], which operates the [[Musudan-ri]] and [[Tongch'ang-dong Space Launch Center]] rocket launching sites and has developed the [[Paektusan (rocket)|Baekdusan-1]] and [[Unha|Unha (Baekdusan-2)]] space launchers and [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng programme|Kwangmyŏngsŏng]] satellites. In 2009 North Korea announced several future space projects, including manned space flights and the development of a manned partially reusable launch vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minzuwang.com/inc/news_view.asp?newsid=12503 |title=朝鲜宣布发展太空计划抗衡"西方强权" |publisher=[[Rodong Sinmun]] |date=2009-02-08 |accessdate=February 26, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The successor to the [[Korean Committee of Space Technology]], [[National Aerospace Development Administration]] (NADA) successfully launched an [[Unha-3]] [[launch vehicle]] in February of 2016,  placing the [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-4]] satellite in orbit.

===Pakistan===
{{Main article|Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission}}

[[Pakistan]] started pursuing space technology on 16 September 1961, when Pakistan's space agency, [[SUPARCO]] was created, with renowned physicist [[Abdus Salam]] as its first administrator. In its early days, SUPARCO researched on the development of solid-fuel [[sounding rockets]] with assistance provided by the United States. On 7 June 1962, with the launch of the ''[[Rehbar-I]]'' (''lit. Teller of the Way'') rocket, Pakistan became the tenth country in the world to successfully conduct the launch of an unmanned spacecraft. This rocket had been developed by a team of scientists and engineers of the [[Pakistan Air Force]], led by [[Air Commodore]] ([[Brigadier-General]]) [[Władysław Józef Marian Turowicz]] in collaboration with [[NASA]] and was launched from [[Sonmiani]], Pakistan's first space launch facility. SUPARCO's unmanned space program continued till 1972, with nearly 20 successful launches. SUPARCO's unmanned space program suffered setbacks during the 1970s and the 1980s, delaying the development and launch of Pakistan's first satellite, [[Badr-I]] till 1990 when it was launched from China. SUPARCO launched Pakistan's second satellite, [[Badr-B]]  in 2001 from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] using a Ukrainian [[Zenit-2]] rocket, followed by [[Paksat-1R]] in 2011 which was contracted and actually built and launched by China, was Pakistan's first communication satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission of Pakistan |url=http://suparco.gov.pk/downloadables/01-STAND-with-SUPARCO.pdf |website=Suparco.gov.pk |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 July, 2018, [[Pakistan]] launched two satellites from [[China]]'s [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre]] with [[Long March 2C|Long March 2C Rocket]]. The [[Pakistan Remote Sensing Satellite|Pakistan Remote Sensing Satellite (PRSS-1)]] was a dual-purpose Earth observational and optical satellite. It was designed and developed by SUPARCO’s engineers. It was {{convert|1200|kg}} weight satellite which will operate at an altitude of {{convert|640|km}}.

==Solar System exploration==
[[Timeline of Solar System exploration|Solar System exploration]] and manned spaceflights are major space technologies in the public eye. Since [[Sakigake]], the first interplanetary probe in Asia, was launched in 1985, Japan has completed the most planetary exploration, but other nations are catching up.

===Moon race===
The Moon is thought to be rich in [[Helium-3]], which could one day be used in [[Fusion power|nuclear fusion power plants]] to fuel future [[World energy resources and consumption|energy demands]] in Asia. All three main Asian space powers plan to send men to the Moon in the distant future and have already sent [[Robotic spacecraft#Lunar probes|lunar probes]].

====Probing the Moon====
Japan was the first Asian country to launch a lunar probe. The [[Hiten]] (Japanese: "flying angel") spacecraft (known before the launch as MUSES-A), built by the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science of Japan, was launched on 24 January 1990. In many ways, the mission did not go as was planned. [[SELENE|Kaguya]], the second Japanese lunar orbiter spacecraft, was launched on 14 September 2007.

China launched its first lunar probe, [[Chang'e-1]], on 24 October 2007 and successfully entered lunar orbit on 5 November 2007.

India launched its first lunar probe, [[Chandrayaan-1]], on 22 October 2008 and successfully entered its final lunar orbit on 2 November 2008. The mission was considered a major success and the probe detected water on the lunar surface.

====Moon landings====
{{Main article|Moon landing}}
The first confirmed Moon landing from Asia was Hiten's mission in 1993. An intentional hard landing at the end of the mission, some pictures of the lunar surface were taken before impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isas.ac.jp/j/isasnews/backnumber/1994/ISASnews154.pdf|title=ISAS news No.154|language=Japanese|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hiten was not designed as a Moon lander and had few scientific instruments for lunar exploration. The next Japanese Moon landing program was the [[LUNAR-A]], developed from 1992. Although the LUNAR-A orbiter was cancelled, its penetrators are integrated into the Russian [[Luna-Glob]] program, which was scheduled to launch in 2011. The penetrators are "relatively" hard landers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/lunar_a/index_e.html|title=Lunar exploration satellite "LUNAR-A"}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are not expected to be destroyed at impact.

The first Asian probe that was part of a lunar landing program was the Indian [[Moon Impact Probe]] (MIP) released from [[Chandrayaan-1]] in 2008. MIP was a hard lander and was designed to move the ground under for research purposes. MIP was designed to be destroyed at impact. Its instruments performed lunar observations to within 25 minutes before impact. The landing test will be applied to future soft landings such as [[Chandrayaan-2]], planned for 2016.

The Chinese Chang'e-1 spacecraft also achieved a systematic hard landing at the end of its mission in 2009, when China became the sixth country to reach the lunar surface. One purpose of the lander was to pre-test for future soft landings. A Chinese lunar soft lander is achieved with the Chang'e-3 mission.

===Exploration of the major planets===
Japanese interplanetary probes have been mostly limited to [[Small Solar System bodies]] such as [[comets]] and [[asteroids]]. JAXA's [[Nozomi (probe)|Nozomi probe]] was launched in 1998, but contact was lost with the probe due to electrical failures before visiting the planet Mars. The second Japanese probe for the planet Venus, [[Akatsuki (probe)|Akatsuki]], was launched in 2010. Akatsuki entered orbit around Venus on December 7, 2015.

Chinese scientists expect that China will take 20&amp;nbsp;years to launch independent planetary probes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zjdaily.zjol.com.cn/html/2009-06/08/content_4869055.htm|script-title=zh:中国自主探测火星还需20年|publisher=浙江日报|language=Chinese|date=2009-06-08|accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese manned Mars exploration program is planned for around 2050 by the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recordchina.co.jp/group/g32328.html|script-title=ja:2050年頃に有人火星探査を実施＝中国科学院が計画を発表―中国|publisher=Recoed China|language=Japanese|date=2009-06-10|accessdate=2009-06-12}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

India has successfully launched [[Mars Orbiter Mission]] on November 5, 2013. It reached Mars on September 2014. India has become the only country to successfully insert a satellite into Martian orbit in its maiden attempt; it also became the first Asian country to achieve this feat.

A '''comparison of [[Canadian football]] and [[rugby union]]''' is possible because of the games' shared origins, despite their dissimilarities.

The most significant difference in play is the allowance of blocking for the ball carrier, which is to say preventing a defender from tackling the player with the ball. This rule in Canadian football allows top-flight teams to include hundreds of different plays in each and every match. It also slows the game down, causing frequent stoppages and less spontaneity in play. The laws against this in rugby union allow for each team to contest possession at all stages of a game. This determines the fluid and rapid nature of rugby where possession of the ball may change back and forth between teams without a break in play for long periods. This means that although rugby teams practice and execute a large number of pre-rehearsed plays the players at the top level especially must be quick thinking and tactically adept to cope with an unpredictable, fast moving game.

===Composition of teams===
Professional and most scholastic Canadian football team play has evolved from a single team with all players except limited substitutions playing the entire game, to a specialized "[[platoon]]" system consisting of three separate units (offensive, defensive, and "special teams" used for kicking and punting) with only one of the three being on the field at a time. That is to say that in Professional Canadian football, the majority of players only play in one specialization (or "one side of the ball") -- however, every player is eligible to play in any specialization. In rugby the teams are divided into eight forwards and seven backs. Both groups of players partake on attacking and defensive plays and are on the pitch at the same time. The eight forwards however only take part in the "set pieces" which are ways to contest ball possession when there is a minor rule infringement or the ball passes out of bounds. These are the scrums, a test of strength, and the line outs. A persons build and skill level determines which group they can play in. All forwards must be heavy and strong to scrummage well but not so heavy that they are too slow to partake in attacking plays. The backs are lighter and faster and include the expert kickers. The forwards numbered 6 through 8 are the players that need to have good all round rugby skills as well as speed and strength. In professional rugby there are very few players who can play equally well in a variety of positions and most will play in the same position from youth. Every position in rugby has its own unique name (except for number 8) and associated skill base.

In the majority of club and schoolhouse Canadian Football the majority of players play both offence and defence only being substituted for injury. Substitutes in Canadian football can return to the game at any stoppage in play. In rugby union, any player substituted off for any reason except for minor bleeding is not allowed to return to the game (with the possible exception of front-row forwards). Rugby teams may make up to eight substitutions. There are fifteen players on the pitch at all times. Players who are verified as bleeding by an independent medical official are sent to the "blood bin," where they can receive medical treatment, and replaced until they have stopped bleeding. Ejected players in Canadian football can be replaced with a substitute, while in rugby union ejection means the team must play a man down the remainder of the game. This is known as being "red carded" and is punishment for especially dangerous play. Players who are red carded typically are banned for a number of games or even permanently.

===Duration of game===
A rugby union game is divided into two halves of 40 minutes (or shorter for lower grade games) separated by a 10-minute half time period. Most notably, a rugby union game will continue after the scheduled end of a half (half-time or full-time) until the ball is kicked into touch, a team scores, or the losing side commits a penalty. Time may also be added onto each half at the referee's discretion to make up for time lost due to treatment of injuries, etc. (this usually amounts to less than 5 minutes). Most commonly, however, the clock will be stopped by the referee to allow for treatment of injured players during the game, removing the need for added injury time. In contrast Canadian football matches are made up of four quarters of 15 minutes each, but the clock stops and starts according to specific rules, so that the 15 minutes quarter lasts slightly longer. In the professional (televised) version of this sport the game is often paused for the airing of commercials and advertisements; this does not occur outside of the televised environment where breaks in play are comparable to those in rugby union. In addition to this, the half time break is typically 12- to 15-minutes; this intermission allows for resetting of strategy in both rugby and Canadian football and adjusting to the opponents schemes. During the period entertainment is played for the crowd, ranging from [[marching band]] performances in high school and college games to big-name entertainment (e.g. [[Black Eyed Peas]] and [[The Tragically Hip]]) for the [[Grey Cup]]. The entertainment in rugby varies from club to club but traditionally would involve a band performance. The typical game in a non-televised environment lasts for around 120 minutes.

===Game play===
Rugby union matches are timed for 80 minutes, in two 40-minute halves.  Canadian football games are timed for two 30-minute halves, each of which is further divided into 15-minute quarters.

In both sports, the primary objective of the game is to carry the ball over the opponents goal line. In both sports the ball may be passed backwards an unlimited number of times, but in Canadian football the ball may be passed forward and sideways as long as the passer is behind the line of scrimmage, as opposed to rugby union where the ball cannot be passed but only kicked forward.  The secondary scoring objective is to kick the ball through the opponents goalposts and over its crossbar.

In Canadian football, "play" is stopped when a player is ruled down or out of bounds, whereas the play in rugby union continues until a player or the ball goes out of bounds, a player/team commits a foul or a player scores.

The forward pass and the stoppage when a player is grounded results in short plays and a generally staccato game play in Canadian football, as opposed to the longer and more fluid passages of play found in rugby union. If a player in rugby is tackled then the ball must be released and any player arriving at the scene may pick up the ball and run with it. If two or more opposing players arrive at the same time then a ruck is formed and the players push each other to get at the ball before play continues. Rugby therefore involves far more running and less scrimmaging than Canadian football.

In rugby, kicking during the flow of the game is done for tactical reasons (both offensive and defensive) or to score a goal. If the ball is recovered by the kicking team, it can lead to significant improvement in field position. It is also legal in rugby to kick a goal at any point in the game. This is called a drop goal. In Canadian football, a team that kicks the ball during play automatically gives up possession and cannot recover the ball unless an error in catching the ball (known as a "fumble") is made by the receiving team; because of this, punting is typically done only when teams do not expect to be able to retain possession (i.e. on third down).  Additionally, rule changes made in the early 20th century mandated that field goals cannot be made in front of the line of scrimmage; this has led to the near demise of the drop-kick field goal in Canadian football (unless the drop-kick is executed behind the line of scrimmage, which is rarely done). Catching and blocking kicked balls is an integral part of rugby skills.

In Canadian football, each team is allowed to stop the game clock one time per half (referred to as "timeouts"), and the officials will also stop the clock when there are three minutes to play in each half (referred to as the "Three minute warning").  There are no such stoppages in rugby.  The game clock in Canadian football is also stopped at various times depending on how the previous play ended; for example if the ball carrier runs out of bounds, or if a forward pass is incomplete.

==Origins==
{{see also|Rugby union in Canada#History}}

Various forms of football have been played in Britain for centuries with different villages and schools having their own traditional rules. Rugby-like games were first introduced into Canada by [[United Kingdom|British]] soldiers and colonists in the mid-1800s. However at that time a standard set of rules did not exist and teams would negotiate the rules before playing a game.

[[The Football Association]] was formed in England in October 1863. Differences of opinion about the proposed laws led to the formation of the first governing body for rugby in 1871 the [[Rugby Football Union]]. Laws were drawn up for [[rugby football]] which was now distinct from [[football (soccer)|Association football]] (soccer).

Rugby football proper in Canada dates back to the 1860s. Introduction of the game and its early growth is usually credited to settlers from Britain and the British army and navy in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] and [[Esquimalt, British Columbia]].

In 1864 the first recorded game of rugby in Canada took place in [[Montreal]] amongst artillery men. It is most likely that rugby got its start in British Columbia in the late 1860s or early 1870s when brief mentions of "football" appeared in print.

F. Barlow Cumberland and Fred A. Bethune first codified rules for rugby football in Canada, in 1865 at Trinity College, Toronto, and the first proper Canadian game of rugby took place in 1865 when officers of an English regiment played local civilians, mainly from [[McGill University]].&lt;ref name=CanEnc&gt;''The Canadian Encyclopedia'' (1999, {{ISBN|0-7710-2099-6}}), p2050&lt;/ref&gt;

Rugby is also an ancestor of [[Canadian football]], currently its main competitor. A "running game", resembling rugby, was taken up by the [[Montreal Football Club]] in Canada in 1868.&lt;ref name=histfoot&gt;{{cite web| title = The History of Football | work = The History of Sports | publisher = Saperecom | year = 2007 | url = http://www.historyoffootball.net/ | accessdate = 2007-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in England, a schism developed between those who favoured strict amateurism and those who felt that players should be compensated for time taken off work to play rugby. In 1895, this resulted in the formation of a break-away governing body, the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]].

The Northern Union began to make changes to the laws of rugby in 1906, which resulted in the sport of [[rugby league]]. The Rugby Football Union's version of rugby became as known as [[rugby union]] after its governing body.

==The field==
[[File:Canadian football field.png|thumb|300px|Diagram of a [[Canadian football]] field]]
[[File:RugbyPitch.svg|thumb|right|200px|A rugby union field]]

===Dimensions===
Although both codes are played on similar sized rectangular fields, the dimensions of rugby union fields can vary up to maximum size that is larger than the fixed size of Canadian football fields. Rugby union fields are limited to a maximum length of 144 m long (and 100 m between goal lines) and width of 70 m, while Canadian football fields have a fixed length of 150 [[yard|yd]] (137 m) long and width of 160&amp;nbsp;ft (48.8 m). Both sets of measurements include scoring zones at each end. These are fixed to 20 yd and called the [[end zone]] in Canadian football, but of unspecified length in rugby union.

The Canadian football field is {{convert|110|yd}} long and {{convert|65|yd}} wide with [[end zone]]s {{convert|20|yd}} deep. At each goal line is a set of {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} [[goalposts]], which consist of two ''uprights'' joined by a {{convert|18+1/2|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} crossbar which is {{convert|10|ft|m}} above the goal line. The goalposts may be H-shaped (both posts fixed in the ground) although in the higher-calibre competitions the tuning-fork design (supported by a single curved post behind the goal line, so that each post starts {{convert|10|ft|m}} above the ground) is preferred.

===Lines===
The border between the regular field of play and a scoring zone is called the ''goal line'' in Canadian football and the ''try line'' in rugby union. The outer perimeters of both fields are demarcated with sidelines (ends of rugby union field border the scoring zone being called ''dead ball lines'' and longitudinal sides ''touch lines''). The central playing field of rugby is divided into halves by a ''halfway line''; however, when the Canadian football field was marked, the centre line was marked as 55yards or C which stands for centre.

Additional lines differ markedly with Canadian football fields marked at every 5 yard interval, whereas rugby union fields only have two further solid lines called the ''22 metre lines'' and four broken lines each halving a half (resulting in four quarters and being translated as "quarter lines" in some languages). The dotted lines are made of two ''10 metre lines'' on each side of the halfway line and two ''5 metre lines'' before each goal line. Rugby union fields also have another set of dotted ''5 metre lines''.

The yard lines in Canadian football are vitally important during game play, because a team's advance is measured against these lines, which in turn determines ball possession, whereas the halfway, ''22'' and ''10 yards lines'' only determine the position of players during various rugby union kick-offs (which could be from the halfway line or ''22s'') or [[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]] in the case of the broken line 5 yd from the side lines.

===Goalposts===
Both codes also have goalposts at each end of the field: on the goal line in the case of rugby union, same as in Canadian football. Canadian football goalposts consist of two vertical posts 18.5 feet apart (24 feet in high school football) rising from a horizontal crossbar mounted on single (usually) post raising it 10&amp;nbsp;ft off the ground (resulting in a combined Y-shape of sorts). Rugby union goalposts are 5.6&amp;nbsp;m (18.3&amp;nbsp;ft) apart and extend vertically from the ground being connected by a crossbar at 3&amp;nbsp;m (9.8&amp;nbsp;ft), creating an H-shape. In both cases, only kicks passing between the uprights and above the crossbar score points. The scoring areas of both types of goalposts are therefore similar.

==Advancing the ball==
In Canadian football, the team that is in possession of the ball, the offence, has three [[Down (football)|downs]] to advance the ball 10 yards towards the opponent's end zone. If the offence gains 10 yards, it gets another set of three downs. If the offence fails to gain 10 yards after 3 downs, it loses possession of the ball.

The ball is put into play by a [[Snap (American football)|snap]]. All players line up facing each other at the [[line of scrimmage]]. One offensive player, the [[Center (football)|centre]], then passes (or "snaps") the ball between his legs to a teammate, usually the [[quarterback]].

Players can then advance the ball in two ways:
* By running with the ball, also known as [[Rush (football)|rushing]]. One ball-carrier can hand the ball to another; this is known as a '''handoff'''. A ball-carrier can also perform a '''lateral''' or backward pass as in Rugby.
* By [[forward pass|passing the ball forwards]] to a teammate as long as the passer is behind the line of scrimmage.

A down ends, and the ball becomes dead, after any of the following:
* The player with the ball is tackled.
* A forward pass goes out of bounds or touches the ground before it is caught. This is known as an [[incomplete pass]]. The ball is returned to the original line of scrimmage for the next down.
* The ball or the player with the ball goes out of bounds.
* A team scores.

Rugby union is based on the 'right to contest possession'.  A team is not required to surrender possession when the ball carrier is tackled, in contrast to Canadian football, where a team must surrender their possession when a player is tackled and no downs remain.  Rugby union players must win possession in open play, unless the team in possession makes an infringement, scores, or the ball leaves the field of play.

A team in rugby union can advance the ball in two ways:

* By running forward with the ball.  The ball carrier typically passes to a teammate just before he is tackled, to permit another player to continue the run towards the try line, thus quickly gaining ground.  The ball carrier cannot pass to any teammate that is closer to the try line.  This would be a forward pass, which is illegal.
* By kicking the ball forwards and attempting to recover it (illegal in Canadian Football, unless the ball is first touched by another player).

In rugby the method of attack is typically decided by the person in the number ten jersey (the flyhalf). Once the forwards gain possession of the ball after a scrum, line out or ruck the ball is usually passed to this player who is the midpoint between the forwards and the backs. He/she must read the oppositions defensive strategy and calls a play accordingly either running, passing or kicking to other players. After the set piece or ruck the no.10 is the first player who has time to control the play and must therefore be an expert at a wide variety of kicks and an expert passer. The rule differences mean that there are a wider variety of kicks and kicking strategies in rugby compared to Canadian football.

Possession may change in different ways in both games:

# When the ball is kicked to the opposing team; this can be done at any time but it is normal to [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] on the last down in Canadian football when out of field goal range.
# Following an unsuccessful kick at goal.
# When an opposing player [[Interception|intercepts]] a pass.
# When the player in possession drops the ball and it is recovered by an opposition player. This is called a [[fumble]] in Canadian football.
# In rugby union the opposition are awarded a [[scrum (rugby union)|scrum]] if the player in possession drops the ball forwards or makes the ball go forwards with any part of his body other than his feet and the opposition are unable to gain an advantage from the lost possession. This is called a ''knock-on''.
# In rugby union if the ball goes out of play, the opposition are awarded a [[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]], this is called [[ball back]]. However, if the ball was kicked out of play as the result of the awarding of a penalty the team that kicked the ball out throws the ball in. Both teams can contest in a line-out.
# In Canadian football possession changes hands following a successful score with the scoring team ''kicking off'' to the opposition. In rugby union the team who conceded the score must kick off to the team who scored.
# In Canadian football, an automatic handover takes place when the team in possession runs out of downs.

In both codes, tactical kicking is an important aspect of play. In Canadian football, it is normal to [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] on the last down, but, as in rugby union, a kick can take place at any phase of play.

==Passing==

In Canadian football, the offence can throw the ball forward once on a play from behind the line of scrimmage. The [[forward pass]] is a distinguishing feature of Canadian football as it is strictly forbidden in rugby.

The ball can be thrown sideways or backwards without restriction in both games. In Canadian football this is known as a [[Lateral pass|lateral]] and is much less common than in rugby union.

In both codes, if the ball is caught by an opposition player this results in an [[interception]] and possession changes hands.

==Tackles and blocks==
:See also [[tackle (football move)]]

In both games it is permitted to bring down the player in possession of the ball and prevent them making forward progress. In rugby, unlike in Canadian football, the ball is still in play. Players from either team can take possession of the ball. The tackled player must present the ball (release the ball) so that open play can continue.

Rugby union rules do not allow tackles above the plane of the shoulders. Only the player who has possession of the ball can be tackled. The arms of the attacker must also wrap around the player being tackled. If a maul or ruck is formed, a player may not "ram" into the formation without first binding to the players.

In Canadian football, tacklers are not required to wrap their arms around the ball carrier before bringing him to the ground; in fact, the ball carrier is often "tackled" by the defender taking a running start and hitting the ball carrier to knock them to the ground.  Tackles can also be made by grabbing the ball carrier's jersey and pulling him to the ground (though pulling down a ball carrier by the pads behind his neck is known as a "horse collar", a move now illegal at all levels of the Canadian game).  If a ball carrier is stopped for more than a few seconds, the referee can blow the whistle, declare the player's forward progress stopped, and end the play even though the ball carrier is not actually tackled to the ground.

In Canadian football, players are allowed to 'block' players without the ball, this is not permitted in rugby union and would be considered 'obstruction', resulting in a penalty.

==Scoring==

A [[touchdown]] is the Canadian equivalent of a [[try]]. Unlike Canadian football, both codes of rugby require the ball to be grounded, whereas in Canadian football it is sufficient for the ball to enter the [[end zone]] (in-goal area) when in the possession of a player (making the term "touchdown" a [[misnomer]]).  In Canadian football a touchdown scores 6 points; in rugby union a try is worth 5 points.

In both games, following a try / touchdown, there is the opportunity to score additional points by kicking the ball between the posts and over the bar. In Canadian football this is called an [[extra point]] (worth 1 point); in rugby union it is known as a [[Try#Conversion|conversion]] (worth 2 points). (The result is that both the touchdown/extra point combination and the try/conversion combination, when successful, total to 7 points.) One key difference between an extra point and a conversion is that a conversion kick must be taken from a position in line with where the try was scored, although the distance from the try line from which the conversion kick is taken is not fixed. Hence, it is advantageous to ground the ball under the posts rather than in the corner which makes for a more difficult kick. Also, Canadian football features the option of the going for a 2-point convert, where the attacking team gets one chance from 5 yards out to get the ball in the endzone again. This would be worth 2 points on top of the 6 already awarded for the touchdown.

In Canadian football teams often opt to go for a [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] (worth 3 points) rather than attempt a touchdown. The rugby equivalent is a [[drop goal]] (worth 3 points in union and only one in league). The key difference between a field goal and a drop goal is that a field goal attempt is normally kicked with a teammate holding the ball, whereas in rugby the ball must hit the ground and be kicked from a half-volley.

A similar concept in rugby is the [[Penalty (rugby)|penalty goal]]. Following the award of the penalty, the attacking team may opt to kick for goal rather than advance the ball by hand or punting. This scores 3 points. The penalty goal is similar to a field goal in Canadian football in that the ball is kicked from the ground, but it cannot be charged. There is no direct equivalent to a penalty goal in Canadian football. A rare play called a "[[fair catch kick]]" is analogous to a [[goal from mark]] which existed in rugby union at one time.

Canadian football has one further method of scoring which does not exist in rugby. If the team with possession causes the ball to enter their own endzone, and the ball carrier is then tackled while within the endzone, then this results in a [[Safety (football score)|safety]] which scores 2 points for the attacking team and results in the defending team having to kick the ball to the team who recorded it. In rugby union this does not score any points but results in a scrum 5 meters from the try zone with the tackling team in possession.

In Rugby, If the ball is kicked past the try line and the receiving team grounds it without returning to the field of play, a drop kick from the 22-metre line ensues. In Canadian football, if a kick-off or punt goes into the endzone and the receiving team downs it without leaving the endzone, the result is a "rouge" and the receiving team gains possession of the ball but give up a point to the punting team for failing to advance the ball out of the endzone.

An important difference between the two sports involves the aftermath of a score. In Canadian football, the scoring team kicks off, except after a safety. In rugby union, the team scored upon kicks off (in [[rugby sevens]], a variant of rugby union featuring seven players per side, the scoring team kicks off).

==Players==

:See also [[Canadian football#Players]], [[Rugby union positions]]

Canadian teams have twelve players on the field per side. Different players may be interchanged at will for offence and defence as well as special teams for specific activities.

A Canadian football team consists of an offensive unit, a defensive unit and a "special teams" unit (involved in kicking and kick returns). Twelve players can be on the field at any time.  Players are allowed to play on more than one of the units, this is the norm for all but the highest levels of play (professional and large schools). The kicking unit, with the exception of a few specialists, is usually made up of reserve players from the offence and defence.

In both kinds of rugby the same players have to both defend and attack. There are fifteen players in a rugby union team (except in [[rugby sevens|sevens]] and tens).

Many of the positions in each code have similar names, but, in practice, the roles of those positions can be different. A [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] in Canadian football is very different from a [[Fullback (rugby union)|fullback]] in rugby. Some of the positions are fairly similar; a Rugby [[fly-half]] carries out a similar role to a [[quarterback]] in Canadian football; however, quarterbacks touch the ball on almost every offensive play.

Broadly speaking [[Lineman (American football)|linemen]] and [[linebacker]]s in Canadian football correspond to [[Forwards (rugby union)|forwards]] in rugby, and [[running back]]s, receivers, and quarterbacks have roles similar to [[Rugby union positions#Backs|backs]] in rugby.

Because of the playing time, number of pauses, number of players and the nature of the game in general, rugby players will typically need higher physical endurance than Canadian football players while more short-term bursts of physical strength, power, and speed are required in Canadian football (amongst equivalent positions and weights). Collisions between players in rugby union tend to last significantly longer than Canadian football, in which collisions are more often "hits" in which the momentum of the player is enough to bring the other player to ground or at least forcing an error or fumble. In rugby union tackles must at least show an attempt to bind the opposing player. These hits are not usually at the speed of Canadian football both because of the nature of the game and the lack of protective equipment. Additionally, rugby offsides rules and the lack of a forward pass significantly reduce the chance of a player receiving a "blind-side" hit (i.e. being hit and/or tackled from behind).  In Canadian football, players receiving a forward pass are often vulnerable because they must concentrate on catching the ball, often jumping very high or stretching out and thereby exposing their body to punishing hits; in rugby a player is not allowed to be tackled in the air, leaving the receiver of the kick with more time to assess his surroundings.  Ball carriers in rugby can usually anticipate a hit and can brace themselves accordingly.

In rugby, the contact times between players are usually longer, as a more wrestling approach is required to bring players down, as momentum cannot always be relied upon particularly when the lines between the teams are consistently close, not allowing for significant momentum to be developed before meeting a defender. In rugby, [[Playing rugby union#Ruck|rucks]] and [[Playing rugby union#Maul|mauls]] may develop following a tackle when multiple players from each team bind together to move the ball in play (on the ground or in-hand respectively). In Canadian football, equivalents to rucks and mauls are virtually non existent, as play stops when the ball carrier is stopped. This difference can be summed up in the idea that in Canadian football the objective is to bring the player to ground or to disrupt a pass to end the play, whereas in rugby the main objective is to stop the player from breaking the try line.

Canadian football quarterbacks - and increasingly, their coaches - have several seconds to decide what the next play they will run in many occasions during the game, thus allowing for both complex tactics displayed within individual plays and overall game-wide strategy in play calling and play selection. In rugby union, the continuous nature of the game implies that there is no time to discuss team strategy, therefore offensive actions may seem to lack a definite direction for some periods of time. Rugby is more movement based than Canadian football in which short bursts are needed.

Rugby players often continue to participate in the game long after they have left school.  In Canada, amateurs who have left school rarely play full tackle football, but often play [[touch rugby|touch football]] or [[flag football]].

==Attire==

[[Rugby union]] players are allowed to wear modest padding on the head, shoulders and collarbone, but it must be sufficiently light, thin and compressible to meet IRB standards. The headguard, also called a "scrum cap", is now commonly worn throughout all levels of the game. Protective headgear which is becoming essential because of the quantity of cuts and head injuries that can occur, particularly by the boots of players involved in rucking. Hard plastic or metal are prohibited in rugby kit. This includes hard plastic shin guards. No form of metal is allowed in any rugby kit, except for IRB-approved soft aluminum studs on boots. An essential part of the safety equipment needed for rugby is the gumshield or mouthguard. Players also have the option to use fingerless gloves which have been introduced recently to the game allowing players to better grip the ball.

[[Canadian football]] players wear much bulkier protective equipment, such as a padded plastic [[football helmet|helmet]], [[shoulder pads]], hip pads and knee pads. These protective pads were introduced decades ago and have improved ever since to help minimize lasting injury to players. A Canadian football helmet consists of a hard plastic top with thick padding on the inside, a facemask made of one or more metal bars, and a chinstrap used to secure the helmet. An [[unintended consequence]] of all the safety equipment has resulted in increasing levels of violence in the game which unprotected would be extremely dangerous. In previous years with less padding, tackling more closely resembled tackles in [[rugby union]], with less severe impacts and less severe structural injuries.

These tables provide a '''comparison of [[netbook]]s'''.

Aspects of netbooks that should be considered:
* Mouse layout that is used. [[Touchpad]] with 2-buttons below, or touchpad with buttons on each side. The latter may make it hard with some operations needing simultaneous presses&lt;!--formulation?--&gt;.
* Battery capacity and operating time.
* Weight and size. The original concept was below {{nowrap|1 kg}} but some manufacturers tend toward 2&amp;nbsp;kg (4.4&amp;nbsp;lb).
* Noise from CPU fan.
* Driver availability for the built-in hardware.
* [[Operating system]] choice.
* Presence of built-in [[High-Speed Downlink Packet Access|HSDPA]], etc., may help to avoid USB dongles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="126816">This is a '''comparison of orbital launch systems'''. The following exposes the full list of conventional orbital launch systems. For the short simple list of conventional launcher families, see: [[Comparison of orbital launchers families]]. For the list of predominantly solid-fuelled orbital launch systems, see: [[Comparison of solid-fuelled orbital launch systems]].

[[Spacecraft propulsion]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;There are many different methods. Each method has drawbacks and advantages, and spacecraft propulsion is an active area of research. However, most spacecraft today are propelled by forcing a gas from the back/rear of the vehicle at very high speed through a [[rocket engine nozzle|supersonic de Laval nozzle]]. This sort of [[engine]] is called a [[rocket engine]].&lt;/ref&gt; is any [[propulsion|method used to accelerate]] [[spacecraft]] and artificial [[satellite]]s. A conventional [[solid rocket]] or a conventional [[solid-fuel rocket]] is a rocket with a motor that uses [[solid propellant]]s ([[fuel]]/[[oxidizer]]).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The first medieval rockets were solid-fuel rockets powered by gunpowder; they were used by the Chinese, Indians, Mongols and Arabs, in warfare as early as the 13th century.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orbit]]al [[launch vehicle|launch systems]] are rockets and [[non-rocket spacelaunch|other systems]] capable of placing [[payload]]s into or [[escape trajectory|beyond]] [[Earth orbit]]. All current spacecraft use conventional chemical rockets ([[bipropellant rocket|bipropellant]] or [[solid rocket|solid-fuel]]) for launch, though some&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Such as the [[Pegasus rocket]] and [[SpaceShipOne]].&lt;/ref&gt; have used [[air-breathing engine]]s on their [[Multistage rocket|first stage]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Most satellites have simple reliable chemical thrusters (often [[monopropellant rocket]]s) or [[resistojet rocket]]s for [[orbital station-keeping]] and some use [[momentum wheel]]s for [[attitude control]]. Soviet bloc satellites have used [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]] for decades, and newer Western geo-orbiting spacecraft are starting to use them for north-south stationkeeping and orbit raising. Interplanetary vehicles mostly use chemical rockets as well, although a few have used [[ion thruster]]s and [[Hall effect thruster]]s (two different types of electric propulsion) to great success.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
&lt;references group="note"&gt;
&lt;ref name="N3"&gt;The Saturn V made 13 launches, 12 of which reached the correct orbits, and the other ([[Apollo 6]]) reached a different orbit than the one which had been planned; however, some mission objectives could still be completed; [http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/saturn_apollo/documents/Flight_History.pdf NASA, Saturn V News Reference, Appendix: Saturn V Flight History (1968)]. For more information, see the [[Saturn V]] article.  The Saturn V launch record is usually quoted as having never failed, e.g. ''"The rocket was masterminded by Wernher Von Braun and did not fail in any of its flights"'', Alan Lawrie and Robert Godwin; [http://www.apogeespacebooks.com/Books/Saturn.html Saturn], but the Apollo 6 launch should be considered a partial mission failure. The 13th launch of Saturn V was in special configuration (SA-513) with the [[Skylab]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="N4"&gt;The N1 rocket was initially designed for 75mt LEO capacity and launch attempts were made with this version, but there were studies to increase the payload capacity to 90—95 mt, if a liquid-hydrogen upper stage engine could be developed.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/references&gt;

The '''''Dictionary of the Scots Language''''' (DSL) ({{lang-sco|Dictionar o the Scots Leid}}) is an online [[Scots language|Scots]]-[[English language|English]] dictionary, now run by [[Scottish Language Dictionaries]], a charity and limited company. Freely available via the Internet, the work comprises the two major dictionaries of the [[Scots language]]:{{r|AboutDSL}}
*''[[Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue]]'' (DOST), 12 volumes
*''[[Scottish National Dictionary]]'' (SND), 10 volumes
The DOST contains information about [[Older Scots]] words in use from the 12th to the end of the 17th centuries ([[Early Scots|Early]] and [[Middle Scots]]); SND contains information about Scots words in use from 1700 to the 1970s ([[Modern Scots]]). Together these 22 volumes provide a comprehensive [[History of the Scots language|history of Scots]]. The SND Bibliography and the DOST Register of Titles have also been digitised and can be searched in the same way as the main data files. A new supplement compiled by Scottish Language Dictionaries was added in 2005.

The digitisation project, which ran from February 2001 to January 2004, was based at the [[University of Dundee]] and primarily funded by a grant from the [[Arts and Humanities Research Board]]. Additional financial support was provided by Scottish Language Dictionaries and the [[Russell Trust]].{{r|AboutDSL}}

Dr Victor Skretkowicz was a key figure in the project. Born in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], in 1942; joined the [[University of Dundee]]'s English Department in 1978 and in 1989, became the Dundee University’s representative on the Joint Council for the ''[[Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue]]'' being elected as its convenor three years later.

The '''''Encyclopedia Bulgaria''''' ({{lang-bg|Енциклопедия "България"}}) is an encyclopedia in seven volumes, published by the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]] and dedicated to the [[1300th Anniversary of the Bulgarian State|1300th anniversary]] of the founding of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian state]]. The encyclopedia contains articles on historical, geographical and cultural themes, biographical articles about important [[Bulgaria]]n statesmen and revolutionaries, political, social, scientific, cultural, economic and sports figures as well as articles on current and historical settlements and [[administrative divisions of Bulgaria]]. The work was based on the ''[[Great Bulgarian Encyclopedia]]'' that was published between 1963 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Предговор към том 5 на Кратка българска енциклопедия, Издателство на БАН, София, 1969, стр. 6 – 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The original plan of editor [[Vladimir I. Georgiev|Vladimir Georgiev]] was to publish 6 volumes containing about 20,000 articles with more than 10,000 black and white and color illustrations and maps.&lt;ref&gt;"Encyclopedias," an article in the Encyclopedia "Bulgaria", Volume 2, Publishing House of BAS, 1981 , p. 562&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the last volume was divided into two parts by the editor of the seventh volume, [[Angel Balevski]].

Among the members of the editorial board were [[Dimitar Angelov (historian)|Dimitar Angelov]], [[Georgi Bokov]], [[Kiril Bratanov]], Prof. [[Zhivko Gylybov]], [[Pantelei Zarev]], Prof. [[Dimitar Kossev]], and [[Atanas Stoykov]], among others.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

[[File:Fath Ali Shah Qajar Firman in Shikasta Nastaliq script January 1831.jpg|thumb|A [[Fat'h Ali Shah Qajar]] ''firman'' in [[Shikasta Nastaʿlīq]] script, January 1831]]
A '''firman''' ({{lang-fa|{{nq|فرمان}}}} ''farmân''), or '''ferman''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=firman | url=http://www.seslisozluk.com/?word=firman | publisher=Seslisozluk | date=1999–2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the constitutional level, was a royal mandate or decree issued by a sovereign in an [[Islamic state]], namely the [[Ottoman Empire]]. During various periods they were collected and applied as traditional bodies of law. The word firman comes from  Persian {{lang|fa|{{nq|فرمان}}}} meaning "decree" or "order".

On a more practical level, a firman was, and may still be, any written permission granted by the appropriate Islamic official at any level of government. Westerners are perhaps most familiar with the permission to travel in a country, which typically could be purchased beforehand, or the permission to conduct scholarly investigation in the country, such as archaeological excavation. Firmans may or may not be combined with various sorts of passports.

== Origins of firmans in the Ottoman Empire ==
In the Ottoman Empire, the Sultan derived his authority from his role as upholder of the Shar'ia, but the Shar'ia did not cover all aspects of Ottoman social and political life. Therefore, in order to regulate relations and status, duties and dress of aristocracy and subjects, the Sultan created firmans.&lt;ref name=Lapidus&gt;Ira M. Lapidus, ''A History of Islamic Societies'', 2nd ed. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2002, pp. 260-261&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
[[Image:StMaryOfTheMongols20071010 02.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Firmans of [[Mehmed II]] and [[Bayazid II]] – kept at the [[Church of Saint Mary of the Mongols (Istanbul)|Church of Saint Mary of the Mongols]] in [[Istanbul]] – which granted the ownership of the building to the Greek community]]
Firmans were gathered in codes called "''[[Qanun (law)|kanun]]''" (from the [[Greek language|Hellenic]] word ''kanon'' (κανών) meaning ''rule'' or ''rules'', as well as the [[Arabic]] word ''qanun'' ({{lang|ar|قانون}}) also meaning ''rule'' or ''law''). The ''kanun'' were "a form of secular and administrative law considered to be a valid extension of religious law as a result of the ruler's right to exercise legal judgement on behalf of the community."&lt;ref name=Lapidus/&gt;

When issued by the sultan in the Ottoman Empire, firmans' importance was often displayed by the layout of the document; the more blank space at the top of the document, the more important the firman was.

== Examples of Ottoman firmans ==

=== Firman of Sultan Murad (26 October – 23 November 1386) ===
In this firman, Sultan Murad I recognises a decree created by his father Sultan Orhan (ca. 1324-60).  He gives the monks all they owned during his father's reign, ordering that no one can oppress them or claim their land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gr/2/21/218/218dn/e218dn00.html "Firman of Sultan Murad I," Ottoman Documents, Hellenic Ministry of Culture, 11 Mar 2007]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212014219/http://www.culture.gr/2/21/218/218dn/e218dn00.html |date=12 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Firman of Sultan Mehmed IV (1648–1687) ===
In this firman, the monks of [[Mount Athos]] report that the administrative officials charged with the collection of taxes come at a later date than they are supposed to and demand more money than the value assessed. They also make illegal demands for additional food supplies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gr/2/21/218/218dn/e218dn00.html "Firman of Sultan Mehmed IV," Ottoman Documents, Hellenic Ministry of Culture, 11 Mar. 2007]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212014219/http://www.culture.gr/2/21/218/218dn/e218dn00.html |date=12 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other firmans ==

One of the most important firmans governing relations between Muslims and Christians is a document kept at the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] on the [[Sinai Peninsula]] in Egypt. This monastery is [[Greek Orthodox]] and constitutes the autonomous Sinai Orthodox Church. The firman bears the hand print of [[Muhammad]], and requests the Muslims do not destroy the monastery for God-fearing men live there. To this day there is a protected zone around the monastery administered by the Egyptian government, and there are very good relations between the 20 or so monks, mainly from Greece, and the local community there.

Firmans were issued in some Islamic empires and kingdoms in [[India]] such as the [[Mughal Empire]] and the [[State of Hyderabad]].

== Other uses ==
The term "firman" was used by the [[archeologist]]/[[novelist]] [[Barbara Mertz|Elizabeth Peters]] for official permission from the Egyptian Department of Antiquities to carry on an excavation. A similar authority was cited by [[Austen Henry Layard]] for excavations at [[Nimrud]] which he mistakenly believed was [[Nineveh]].&lt;ref&gt;Layard A. H.'' [https://books.google.com/books?as_brr=1&amp;id=llVFb6qLmsgC&amp;dq=greek+pottery&amp;q=Cimmerian#v=onepage&amp;q=firman&amp;f=false Nineveh and Its Remains]'' Vol. II p.3 at Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Grand Trianon''' ({{IPA-fr|ɡʁɑ̃ tʁijanɔ̃}}) is a ''[[château]]'' (palace) situated in the northwestern part of the [[Palace of Versailles|Domain of Versailles]]. It was built at the request of King [[Louis XIV of France]] (r. 1643–1715), as a retreat for himself and his [[maîtresse en titre]] of the time, the [[Françoise-Athénaïs, marquise de Montespan|Marquise de Montespan]] (1640–1707), and as a place where he and invited guests could take light meals (''collations'') away from the strict [[etiquette|''étiquette'']] of the Court. 

The Grand Trianon is set within its own park, which includes the [[Petit Trianon]] (the much smaller château built between 1762 and 1768 during the reign of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]).

==History==
===Trianon de porcelaine===
In 1663 and 1665, Louis XIV purchased Trianon, a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] on the outskirts of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], and commissioned the architect [[Louis Le Vau]] to design a porcelain pavilion (''Trianon de porcelaine'') to be built there.  
[[File:The Grand Trianon Castle in Summer.JPG|260px|thumb|The Grand Trianon château in Summer]]

The [[façade]] was made of white and blue [[Delft]]-style "porcelain" (ceramic) tiles from the French manufactures of [[Rouen]], [[Lisieux]], [[Nevers]] and [[Saint-Cloud]].  Construction began in 1670 and was finished in 1672. Because it was made in porcelain, the building suffers from deterioration. Louis XIV orders its demolition in 1686 and replaced it by a larger residence.

===Trianon de marbre===
[[File:André-Charles Boulle, Commode Mazarin (Mazarin Cabinet), 1708, Grand Trianon.jpg|260px|thumb|[[André-Charles Boulle]], Commode Mazarin (Mazarin Cabinet), 1708, made for the Grand Trianon]]
By 1687, the fragile ceramic tiles had deteriorated to such a point that Louis XIV ordered the demolition of the pavilion and its replacement with one made of stronger material. Commission of the work was entrusted to the architect [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]].  Hardouin-Mansart's new structure was twice the size of the porcelain pavilion and the material used was red marble of [[Languedoc]].&lt;ref&gt;''ASMOSIA 4'', 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=51vdxp7FUdwC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=marbre+du+languedoc&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iOKMLnSlio&amp;sig=rImUcXrO1uq2qhZiOGB-cYiHkd4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UzomS7e-B5LLlAeEr8jzCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=marbre%20du%20languedoc%20Grand%20Trianon&amp;f=false p. 66].&lt;/ref&gt;  

Begun in June 1687, the new construction (as we see it today) was finished in January 1688 and inaugurated by Louis XIV and his secret wife, the [[Françoise d'Aubigné, marquise de Maintenon|marquise de Maintenon]], during the summer of 1688.  

The ''Grand Trianon'' would often play host to the King and his wife. The first set of ''Grands apartments'' lasted from 1688 to 1691. The next was from 1691 till 1701; then 1701 till his death at Versailles in 1715.

From 1703 to 1711, the building was the residence of [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1661–1711)|''le Grand Dauphin'']]. 
[[File:Grand Trianon Péristyle.JPG|260px|thumb| [[Peristyle]] of the Grand Trianon.]]
In 1708, the prototypes for the [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]] Commode, then called bureaux, were delivered to the Grand Trianon by [[André-Charles Boulle]]. The 1st [[Duke of Antin]], [[Louis Antoine de Pardaillan de Gondrin]] Director of the King's buildings, wrote to Louis XIV: "''I was at the Trianon inspecting the second writing desk by Boulle; it is as beautiful as the other and suits the room perfectly."
[[File:The Grand Trianon Castle Interios.JPG|260px|thumb|The Grand Trianon château interior]]

The domain was a favourite of the [[Princess Marie-Adélaïde of Savoy|Duchess of Burgundy]], the wife of his grandson [[Louis of France, Duke of Burgundy|Louis de France]], the parents of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]].

 [[File:Louis XIV of France.jpg|260px|thumb|Louis XIV of France]]
In the later years of Louis XIV's reign, the Trianon was the residence of the King's sister-in-law [[Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate]], Dowager Duchess of Orléans and known at court as [[Fils de France|''Madame'']]. Her son, [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe d'Orléans]], future son-in-law of Louis XIV and [[Régence|Regent]] of France, lived there with his mother. Louis XIV even ordered the construction of a larger wing to the ''Grand Trianon'' which had begun in 1708 by Mansart; this wing, called ''Trianon-sous-Bois'', housed the Orléans family, including Louis XIV's legitimised daughter [[Françoise-Marie de Bourbon]]. 

The King's youngest grandson [[Charles, Duke of Berry (1686–1714)|Charles de France]] and his wife [[Marie Louise Élisabeth d'Orléans]] also resided there. The Orléans family, who had apartments at the Palace of Versailles, were later replaced by Françoise-Marie's sister; the [[Louise-Françoise de Bourbon|Duchess of Bourbon, ''Madame la Duchesse'']] lived at the Trianon and later built the [[Palais Bourbon]] in [[Paris]], the design of the palace being copied on that of the Trianon. 

In 1717, [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great of Russia]], who was studying the palace and gardens of Versailles, resided at the ''Grand Trianon''; the [[Peterhof Palace|Grand Palace at Peterhof]] was inspired by Versailles.

Louis XV did not bring any changes to the Grand Trianon. In 1740 and 1743, his father-in-law, Stanislas Leszczynski, former king of Poland stayed there during his visits to Versailles.   Later, it was during a stay at Trianon that Louis XV fell ill before being transported to the Palace of Versailles, where he died on 10 May 1774.

No more than his predecessor had, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] brought no structural modifications to the ''Grand Trianon''.  His wife, Queen [[Marie Antoinette]], who preferred the [[Petit Trianon]], gave a few theatrical  representations in the ''galerie des Cotelle'', a gallery with paintings by [[Jean l'Aîné Cotelle]] representing the bosquets of Versailles and Trianon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insecula.com/salle/MS01833.html insecula.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204013506/http://www.insecula.com/salle/MS01833.html |date=2009-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

During the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, the ''Grand Trianon'' was left to neglect. At the time of the [[First French Empire]], [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] made it one of his residences, and furnished it in the [[Empire Style]]. 

Napoleon lived at Trianon with his second wife [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie Louise of Austria]]. 

The next royals to live at Trianon were the King and Queen of the French, [[Louis-Philippe I, King of the French|Louis Philippe I]] and his Italian wife [[Maria Amalia of the Two Sicilies]]; he was a descendant of the Regent Philippe d'Orléans and she was a niece of Marie Antoinette. 

In October 1837 [[Princess Marie of Orléans (1813–1839)|Marie d'Orléans]] (daughter of Louis Philippe I) married [[Duke Alexander of Württemberg (1804–1881)|Alexander of Württemberg]] at Trianon

In 1920, the ''Grand Trianon'' hosted the negotiations and signing of the [[Treaty of Trianon]], which left [[Hungary]] with less than one-third of its pre-[[World War I]] land size.  To Hungarians, the word "Trianon" remains to this day the symbol of one of their worst national disasters.

In 1963 [[Charles de Gaulle]] ordered a renovation of the building.  

A popular site for tourists visiting Versailles, it is one of the [[French Republic]] Presidential residences used to host foreign officials.

'''''Gukjeong chumyo''''' is an 18th-century [[Korean painting]] depicting a crouching cat under wild chrysanthemum on an autumn day. It was drawn by [[Byeon Sang-byeok]], a representative animal painter during the late period of the [[Korea]]n [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392–1910). ''Gukjeong chumyo'' literally means "An autumn cat in a garden with chrysanthemum" and is of the ''yeongmohwa'', or  [[animal painting]], genre. It is painted on paper with light coloring over the [[ink and wash painting]] (''sumukhwa''). The size of the painting is {{convert|29.5|cm|abbr=on}} in height and {{convert|23.4|cm|abbr=on}} in width. It is currently stored at [[Gansong Art Museum]] in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name="Daum"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://culturedic.daum.net/dictionary_content.asp?Dictionary_Id=10021596&amp;mode=content&amp;query=%B1%B9%C1%A4%C3%DF%B9%A6&amp;dircode=0 |script-title=ko:국정추묘 菊庭秋猫 |trans-title=Gukjeong chumyo |publisher=[[Daum Communications|Daum]]/ National Culture Archetype |language=Korean |accessdate=2009-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byeon Sang-byeok is renowned for his skillful depictions of cats and chickens, so he was referred to by the nicknames "Byeon goyangi" (literally "Byeon cat") and "Byeon dak" (Byeon rooster) during his lifetime. His representative paintings include ''[[Myojakdo]]'' (Painting of Cats and Sparrows), and ''[[Hwajomyogudo]]'' (Painting of Flowers, Birds, and Puppies). The cat in the picture is crouching and gazing at something, and seems ready to swiftly run off.&lt;ref name="Daum" /&gt;

'''Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission''' ('''IPC''') is an autonomous institution of the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (India)|Ministry of Health and Family Welfare]] which sets standards for all drugs that are manufactured, sold and consumed in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipc.nic.in/index2.asp?slid=484&amp;sublinkid=227 Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission, Official Website. About IPC, Introduction.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The set of standards are published under the title '''Indian Pharmacopoeia''' ('''IP''') which has been modelled over and historically follows from the [[British Pharmacopoeia]]. The standards that are in effect since December 1, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipc.nic.in/index2.asp?slid=494&amp;sublinkid=234 Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission, Effective Date.]&lt;/ref&gt; is the ''Indian Pharmacopoeia 2010 (IP 2010)''. The Pharmacopoeia 2014 was released by Health Minister [[Ghulam Nabi Azad]] on November 4, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Drug Standards Book Pharmacopoeia 2014 launched today|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2013/11/indian-drug-standards-book-pharmacopoeia-2014-launched-today/|work=Biharprabha News|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''I.P.''', the abbreviation of 'Indian Pharmacopoeia' is familiar to the consumers in the Indian sub-continent as a mandatory drug name suffix. Drugs manufactured in India have to be labelled with the mandatory non-proprietary drug name with the suffix ''I.P''. This is similar to the ''B.P.'' suffix for [[British Pharmacopoeia]] and the ''U.S.P.'' suffix for the [[United States Pharmacopeia]].

The IPC was formed according to the Indian ''Drugs and Cosmetics Act'' of 1940 and established by executive orders of the Government of India in 1945.

== Pharmacopoeia - History of publication==
The actual process of publishing the first Pharmacopoeia started in the year 1944 under the chairmanship of [[Ram Nath Chopra|Col. R. N. Chopra]]. The I. P. list was first published in the year 1946 and was put forth for approval. The titles are suffixed with the respective years of publication, e.g. IP 1996. The following table describes the publication history of the Indian Pharmacopoeia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipapharma.org/events/speakerpresentation/8-%20Dr%20S%20C%20Mathur.pdf|title=Presentation on IP|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The whistleblower has offered to help prosecutors build their cases, on condition of legal protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=Panama Papers Source Offers to Aid Inquiries if Exempt From Punishment|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/07/world/panama-papers-source.html|accessdate=May 8, 2016|work=NYT|date=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial contact with ''Süddeutsche Zeitung''==
In 2014, Doe contacted [[Bastian Obermayer]], a reporter working for German newspaper ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]],'' with the message "Hello. This is John Doe. Interested in data?" When Obermayer answered in the affirmative, Doe continued, saying, "There are a couple of conditions. My life is in danger. We will only chat over encrypted files. No meeting, ever." When Obermayer asked Doe why he was leaking the data, Doe responded that he sought to "make these crimes public." He then proceeded to transfer roughly 11.5 million documents from the records of Panamanian law firm [[Mossack Fonseca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farhi|first1=Paul|title=‘Hello.

== ''The Revolution Will Be Digitized'' ==
Doe issued a statement through ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'' on May 5, 2016 explaining what motivated him to release the massive trove of files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Franco|first1=Arnulfo|title=John Doe, mysterious whistleblower behind Panama Papers, finally speaks|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/article76059762.html|accessdate=May 7, 2016|work=The Miami Herald|agency=Associated Press|date=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this text, titled ''The Revolution Will Be Digitized'', Doe said growing global income inequality and corruption allegedly enabled by Mossack Fonseca motivated his actions. Doe also said the papers demonstrated the injustices perpetrated by the industry that creates offshore companies and blamed governments for allowing offshore havens to proliferate, saying he leaked the documents "simply because I understood enough about their contents to realise the scale of the injustices they described." He added that he had never worked for any government or intelligence agency and expressed willingness to help prosecutors. After ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'' verified that it was from the Panama Papers source, the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] (ICIJ) posted the full written statement on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Panama Papers: Source breaks silence on Mossack Fonseca leaks |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36232142|date=6 May 2016|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://panamapapers.icij.org/20160506-john-doe-statement.html#_ga=1.164154486.836406132.1459807380 |title=Panama Papers Source Offers Documents To Governments, Hints At More To Come |date= May 6, 2016 |accessdate=May 8, 2016 |publisher=ICIJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Leiden Glossary''''' is a [[glossary]] contained in a manuscript in [[Leiden University Library]],  Voss. Lat. Q. 69. The [[Lemma (morphology)|lemmata]] ([[headword|headwords]]) come from "a range of biblical, grammatical, and patristic texts".&lt;ref name=library87&gt;Lapidge, ''Anglo-Saxon Library'' 87.&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[exemplar (manuscript)|exemplar]], and was prepared c. 800 in the [[Abbey of Saint Gall]] in modern-day Switzerland.&lt;ref name=gretsch27/&gt;

The glossary contains 48 chapters or ''glossae collectae'', which explain terms from texts used in the classroom by [[Theodore of Tarsus]] and [[Adrian of Canterbury]], who both taught at [[St Augustine's Abbey]] in [[Canterbury]], and thus "contain the record of their classroom teaching".&lt;ref name=library33&gt;Lapidge, ''Anglo-Saxon Library'' 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] are in Latin, though 250 of them are in [[Old English]]. They give evidence of the impressive holdings of the Canterbury library (none of which remains&lt;ref name=library33/&gt;) and the reading interests of Anglo-Saxon churchmen.

==Contents==
Of the 48 ''glossae collectae'', 19 are on lemmata from Bible books, the 23 others from [[late antique]] and [[patristic]] texts.&lt;ref name=library33/&gt; The importance of a glossary lies partly in that they indicate what was held in the library where the glossary is prepared, partly in what they suggest the glossator's interests were. For instance, Theodore's interest in the works of [[Pope Gregory I]] is clear from the distribution of the glosses: there are eight glosses on Gregory's ''[[Pastoral Care]]'' and no fewer than 46 (or 49) from his ''Dialogi''. In turn, the numerous glosses from the ''Dialogi'', much of which is concerned with [[Hagiography|hagiographical accounts]], prove the importance attached by the Canterbury school to hagiography.&lt;ref name=gretsch27&gt;Gretsch 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

A particular group concerns glosses on [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]]'s translation of [[Eusebius]]'s ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'', where the glossary preserves three groups of lemmata glossed by three different people, "as if they represented the individual responses of three students, of somewhat differing abilities, to the teacher's explanation of the text."&lt;ref name=library88&gt;Lapidge, ''Anglo-Saxon Library'' 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
That the St Gall copy derives from an exemplar brought to the continent from England is proven by the Anglo-Saxon glosses as well as by other content: the glosses are consistent with other biblical commentary produced by the Canterbury school.&lt;ref name=library87/&gt; In addition, the Rufinus glosses agree with those found in the so-called P manuscript of Eusebius ([[Vatican Library|BAV]], Pal. lat. 822), written in [[Lorsch Abbey]] (in modern-day Germany) c. 800. The third Rufinus glossator evidently had an interest in Greek not shared by the other two, and [[Michael Lapidge]] finds that one lemma and its gloss are echoed in Aldhelm's ''De virginitate''; Lapidge proposed that the third Rufinus glossator may well have been [[Aldhelm]].&lt;ref name=library8990&gt;Lapidge, ''Anglo-Saxon Library'' 89-91.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lorsch manuscript, Lapidge argues, is most likely a copy of the manuscript used and annotated in the Canterbury school, the exemplar also for Leiden Voss. Lat. Q. 69.&lt;ref name="library8990"/&gt;

==Scholarship and editions==
An edition of the glosses was published in 1901 by Plazidus Glogger,&lt;ref&gt;Schlutter 466.&lt;/ref&gt; with commentary published in 1903, and in 1906 Jan Hendrik Hessels published another. In the small world of philology, such an almost simultaneous publication is rare. In a note to his own edition, Hessels explains that he became aware of Glogger's edition as he was finishing up his own work, and then only by chance (he saw a note in the MS listing which scholars had worked on it); Glogger had sent Hessels a copy of his book in 1902 but it was delivered at the wrong college and never forwarded. In his note, Hessels says that Glogger had offered to destroy his own publication, which Hessels argued against, and in turn explains that he cannot, given the circumstances, criticize Glogger's work which at any rate was helpful to him and of the highest quality.&lt;ref&gt;Hessels xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A==

The DST column shows the months in which Daylight Saving Time, a.k.a. Summer Time, begins and ends. A blank DST box usually indicates that the location stays on Standard Time all year, although in some cases the location stays on Summer Time all year. If a location is currently on DST, add one hour to the time in the Time column.

S. |title=Al-Qaeda's Purpose in Yemen Described in Works of Jihad Strategists |journal=Terrorism Monitor |date=28 January 2010 |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=[[Jamestown Foundation]] |url=https://jamestown.org/program/al-qaedas-purpose-in-yemen-described-in-works-of-jihad-strategists/ |accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a book by the [[Islamist]] strategist [[Abu Bakr Naji]], published on the [[Internet]] in 2004. It aimed to provide a strategy for [[al-Qaeda]] and other [[extremists]] whereby they could create a new Islamic [[caliphate]].&lt;ref name= "nyJune14"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wright |first=Lawrence |title=ISIS's Savage Strategy in Iraq |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/isiss-savage-strategy-in-iraq |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=16 June 2014 |accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The real identity of Abu Bakr Naji is claimed by the Al Arabiya Institute for Studies to be [[Mohammad Hasan Khalil al-Hakim|Muhammad Khalil al-Hakaymah]].&lt;ref name=alarabiya&gt;{{cite web |first=Hani |last=Nesira |work=[[Al Arabiya]] Institute for Studies |url=http://studies.alarabiya.net/hot-issues/%D8%A5%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%AD%D8%B4%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A2%D9%85%D9%86%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%AF-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A5%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%B4 |script-title=ar:إدارة التوحش..والملاذات الآمنة للإرهاب من نظام الأسد إلى إمارة داعش! |language=ar |date=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alarabiya-en&gt;{{cite web |first=Hani |last=Nesira |title=From Agassi to Al Nusra..Assad experience in jihadi investment! |date=6 July 2013 |url=http://estudies.alarabiya.net/content/agassi-al-nusraassad-experience-jihadi-investment |publisher=[[Al Arabiya]] Institute for Studies |accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His known works are this piece and some contributions to the al-Qaeda online magazine ''[[Voice of Jihad|Sawt al-Jihad]]''. [[National Public Radio]] has described Naji as a "top al-Qaida insider" and characterized the work as "al-Qaida's playbook".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sullivan |first=Laura |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5516640 |title=Al-Qaida's Playbook |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=27 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
''Management of Savagery'' discusses the need to create and manage nationalist and religious resentment and violence in order to create long-term propaganda opportunities for jihadist groups. Notably, Naji discusses the value of provoking military responses from superpowers in order to recruit and train guerilla fighters and to create martyrs. Naji suggests that a long-lasting strategy of [[Attrition warfare|attrition]] will reveal fundamental weaknesses in the ability of superpowers to defeat committed jihadists.&lt;ref name=newyorker&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/09/11/the-master-plan |title=The Master Plan |last=Wright |first=Lawrence |work=The New Yorker |date=11 September 2006 |accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Management of Savagery'' argues that carrying out a campaign of constant violent attacks (vexation operations) in Muslim states will eventually exhaust their ability and will to enforce their authority, and that as the writ of the state withers away, chaos—or "savagery"—will ensue.&lt;ref name="nyJune14"/&gt;&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; Extreme violence is emphasized.
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;One who previously engaged in jihad knows that it is naught but violence, crudeness, terrorism, frightening [others] and massacring -- I am talking about jihad and fighting, not about Islam and one should not confuse them.&lt;ref name=worth-174&gt;{{cite book|last=Worth|first=Robert F.|title=A Rage for Order: The Middle East in Turmoil, from Tahrir Square to ISIS|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNOLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA174|year=2016|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-71071-2|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jihadists can take advantage of this savagery to win popular support, or at least acquiescence, by implementing security, providing social services, and imposing [[Sharia]]. As these territories increase, they can become the nucleus of a new [[caliphate]].&lt;ref name="nyJune14"/&gt;&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; Naji nominated [[Jordan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Yemen]], [[North Africa]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Pakistan]] as potential targets, due to their geography, weak military presence in remote areas, existing jihadist presence, and easy accessibility of weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=al-Ibrahim |first=Fouad |url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/21234 |title=Why ISIS is a threat to Saudi Arabia: Wahhabism's deferred promise |work=[[Al Akhbar (Lebanon)|Al Akhbar]] |location=Lebanon |date=22 August 2014 |accessdate=1 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824121659/http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/21234 |archivedate=24 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Naji professes to have been inspired by [[Ibn Taymiyya]], the influential 14th-century Islamic scholar and theologian.&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word in the title توحش  ''tawaḥḥuš'' has been translated as "savagery" or "barbarism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://jamestown.org/program/new-online-book-lays-out-al-qaedas-military-strategy/ |first=Stephen |last=Ulph |title=New Online Book Lays Out Al-Qaeda's Military Strategy |work=Terrorism Focus |volume=2 |issue=6 |publisher=Jamestown Foundation |date=17 March 2005 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it is a form V verbal noun derived from the root وحش ''waḥš'' "wild animal", it has also accordingly been translated "beastliness".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/trumps_islamic_state_gray_zones_radicals_terrorism_sign_syria_iraq_20160328 |title=Trump's and Islamic State's Gray Zones: Radicals' Terrorism Is Sign of Their Battlefield Losses |first=Juan |last=Cole |date=28 March 2016 |work=Truthdig |access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In practice==
A number of media outlets have compared the attempts by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] to establish territorial control in Iraq and Syria with the strategy outlined in ''Management of Savagery''.&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McCoy |first=Terrence McCoy |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/12/the-calculated-madness-of-the-islamic-states-horrifying-brutality/ |title=The calculated madness of the Islamic State's horrifying brutality |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=12 August 2014 |accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Alastair |first=Crooke |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alastair-crooke/iraq-isis-alqaeda_b_5542575.html |title=The ISIS' 'Management of Savagery' in Iraq |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=30 June 2014 |accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ignatius |first1=David |title=The 'Mein Kampf' of Jihad |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/david-ignatius-the-mein-kampf-of-jihad/2014/09/25/4adbfc1a-44e8-11e4-9a15-137aa0153527_story.html |work=The Washington Post |date=25 September 2014 |accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue of the Islamic State's online magazine, ''[[Dabiq (magazine)|Dabiq]]'', contained discussion of guerrilla warfare and tactics that closely resembled the writings and terminology used in ''Management of Savagery'', although the book was not mentioned directly.&lt;ref name="JamestownDabiq"&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael W.S. |last=Ryan |title=Dabiq: What Islamic State's New Magazine Tells Us about Their Strategic Direction, Recruitment Patterns and Guerrilla Doctrine |work=Hot Issues |url=https://jamestown.org/program/hot-issue-dabiq-what-islamic-states-new-magazine-tells-us-about-their-strategic-direction-recruitment-patterns-and-guerrilla-doctrine/ |publisher=Jamestown Foundation |date=1 August 2014 |accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Hassan Hassan]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', reported an ISIL-affiliated cleric as saying that ''Management of Savagery'' is widely read among the group's commanders and some of its rank-and-file fighters.

The '''Medici-Laurentian Atlas''', also known simply as the '''Medici Atlas''' (and other variants, e.g. "Laurenziano Gaddiano", "Laurentian Portolano", "Atlante Mediceo" or "Laurentian Atlas"), is an anonymous 14th-century set of maps, probably composed by an [[Genoa|Genoese]] cartographer and explicitly dated 1351, although most historians believe it was composed, or at least retouched,  later.  The atlas is currently held by the [[Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana]] in [[Florence]], Italy.

== Background ==

The author of the Medici-Laurentian atlas is unknown, save that he comes from the [[Liguria]] region of Italy (probably [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]]), and might have composed it for a [[Florence|Florentine]] owner. The atlas is explicitly dated 1351 (as per its astronomical calendar), but scholars believed it was more likely composed around 1370, possibly from earlier material, and probably amended further later, with emendations as late as 1425-50.&lt;ref&gt;The existence of the Medici Atlas was announced and described in Theobald Fischer (1886: [https://books.google.com/books?id=hWQuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.127-147]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Davis&gt;[http://www.henry-davis.com/MAPS/LMwebpages/233mono.htm Portolano Laurenziano Gaddiano] by Henry Davis. Consulted 10 June 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1370 date would place it in between the [[Pizzigani brothers]] map of 1367 and the [[Catalan Atlas]] of 1375, both of which share elements of the Medici-Laurentian map, although it is impossible to tell exactly if it preceded or followed them.&lt;ref&gt;Armando Cortesão (1954 (1975):[https://books.google.com/books?id=2PbNS0LHn60C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=RA1-PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.78])&lt;/ref&gt; It is also contemporaneous with the ''[[Libro del Conoscimiento]]'', a fantastical travelogue by an unknown [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] author, believed to have been written sometime between 1350 and 1399, with which it shares many significant geographic features.  The book's author may have inspired, or have been inspired by, the Medici-Laurentian atlas.&lt;ref&gt;Beazley&lt;/ref&gt;

The Atlas is currently held by the [[Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana]] in [[Florence]], Italy (Gaddi. Rel. 9).

== Features ==

The Medici-Laurentian atlas is composed of eight sheets.  The first sheet is an astronomical calendar, the second sheet contains an unusual ''[[early world maps|world map]]'', the third, fourth and fifth sheets compose a typical 14th-century [[portolan chart]] (covering Europe, North Africa, the Mediterranean and Black Seas), the sixth, seventh and eighth sheets are specialized charts of the [[Aegean Sea]], [[Adriatic Sea]] and [[Caspian Sea]].&lt;ref name = Davis/&gt;

=== World map ===

The second sheet, the world map, is the one that has attracted most attention.  If the original date 1351 is true, that would make it the first (extant) map to incorporate the travel reports of [[Marco Polo]] and [[Ibn Batuta]].  It shows Asia up to India, marking places like the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and others with reasonable accuracy.  The atlas also shows the Caspian as a closed sea (unusual for maps of that time).

Among the most startling features is its depiction of the recognizable shape of the continent of [[Africa]] with remarkable prescience. Nearly a century before the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[age of discovery]], the Medici atlas draws the bend of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] and shows that Africa has a southern end, i.e. that the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean]]s are connected to each other below the African continent.

While the remarkable shape of Africa has given rise to speculative theories about ancient sailing and secret voyages, the explanation is probably more mundane.&lt;ref name = Davis/&gt;  The probable source of the "Guinea bend" is the legend of the ''Sinus Aethiopicus'', the rumor of a [[Gulf (geography)|gulf]] that lay somewhere south of [[Cape Bojador]] that was said to penetrate deeply into the African continent.  This gulf is  described in the fantastical travelogue of the ''[[Libro del Conoscimiento]]'' (possibly as early as 1350)&lt;ref&gt;''Libro del Conoscimiento'' (1877: [https://books.google.com/books?id=0lMEEgk1U-kC&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.60])&lt;/ref&gt; and finds itself again in the [[Fra Mauro]] map (1459), well before it was discovered by Portuguese explorers.  The notion that the [[West Africa]]n coast did not extend straight south but took a sharp eastward bend, could be a hazy reference to the actual Gulf of Guinea, but more probably it was just a lucky guess and a bit of wishful thinking.  (Historian Russell&lt;ref&gt;Russell (2000: p.122)&lt;/ref&gt; notes that the Portuguese Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] was entranced by the legend of the ''Sinus Aethiopicus'', as it held out the prospect of a direct sea route around West Africa to the Christian kingdom of [[Prester John]] ([[Ethiopian Empire]]), avoiding the complications of travelling through the Muslim lands of Egypt to reach it.  In the Medici Atlas, the depth of the penetration of the ''Sinus'' indeed almost reaches Ethiopia.)

As for the southward extension of the [[East Africa]]n coast, uncommon for European maps, this was probably drawn from Arab sources, who would have known of the commercial traffic down the Muslim [[Kilwa Sultanate|Swahili coast]] to [[Sofala]]. Finally, the connection between the two oceans under South Africa just ratifies the old assumption (from Biblical and Classical authority) that all the world's great water bodies were connected to each other. An Africa surrounded by water is already found on other maps (e.g. [[Pietro Vesconte]]'s c. 1320 mappa mundi). Long before the Medici map, the [[Vivaldi brothers]] of Genoa, in 1291, had tried to sail down the west African coast, with the explicit objective of trying to find a sea route to Asia.

The imaginary nature of Africa's shape in the Medici map is almost proven by noticing there are no names or details given below [[Cape Bojador]].&lt;ref name = Davis/&gt;  The great exception is the legendary "River of Gold", the "western Nile" of Arab sources (i.e. the [[Senegal River]], assumed connected to the [[Niger River]], flowing through the heart of the gold-producing [[Mali Empire]]).  This is the same ''Palolus'' river as in the [[Pizzigani brothers]] map of 1367.&lt;ref&gt;Beazley (1899: [https://books.google.com/books?id=1RpzAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3ALCCN64001141&amp;pg=PR125#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false cxxv])&lt;/ref&gt;  If one elects to date the Medici Atlas before the Pizzigani, then this is the first European map depicting that all-important river.

=== Atlantic islands ===

The Medici Atlas is also important for the history of the north [[Atlantic islands]].  It is probably the first map to benefit from the 1341 mapping expedition to the [[Canary Islands]], sponsored by King [[Afonso IV of Portugal]] and commanded by the Florentine [[Angiolino del Tegghia de Corbizzi]] and the Genoese [[Nicoloso da Recco]]. The expedition is said to have visited thirteen Canary islands (seven major and six minor).&lt;ref&gt;The 1341 expedition is related by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] "De Canaria et insula reliquis, ultra Ispaniam, in occeano noviter repertis" (repr. in ''Monumenta Henricina'', vol. I, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JL_IU1hpmsIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA389#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.202-06.])&lt;/ref&gt;  The Medici Atlas shows most of the main Canary islands, excellently delineated (if not yet fully named), greatly improving upon the couple in the 1339 [[Angelino Dulcert]] map.

The Medici Atlas shows also for the first time, and almost correctly placed, the [[Madeira]] archipelago, with their modern names: ''Porto sto'' ([[Porto Santo]]), ''I. de lo Legname'' ([[Madeira]], ''legname'' is [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]] for "wood") and ''I dexerta'' ([[Desertas]]).  The [[Madeira]] archipelago will not be officially discovered by the Portuguese until c. 1420.  These names could have been in the original, or retouched later - although  these same names were already given in the ''[[Libro del Conoscimiento]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Libro de Conoscimiento'' (1877 ed.: [https://books.google.com/books?id=0lMEEgk1U-kC&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.50])&lt;/ref&gt;

The Medici Atlas also seems to show the location of [[the Azores]], being the first to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Amat di S. Filippo (1892). However, Marcel (1887: [https://books.google.com/books?id=xXk9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.31]) suggest it may have already been hinted at in the Dulcert (1339) map, under the names St. Brendan, Primaria sive puellarum, Capraria and Canaria.&lt;/ref&gt;  They are depicted northwest of the Madeira group, aligned on a north to south axis, rather than trailing diagonally from northwest to southeast.  The islands are not all individually named, but rather named by cluster. Most southerly are the ''insule de Cabrera'' ("Goat islands", encompassing two islands, what seem like [[Santa Maria Island (Azores)|Santa Maria]] and [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]]), further north is the individually named ''Insula Brasi'' ("island of embers/fire" (volcanic?) or "[[brazilwood|dyewood]]", either of which point to [[Terceira Island|Terceira]], but could also be the legendary Irish ''[[Brasil (mythical island)|Brazil]]''), then, just west of it, a group called ''insule de Ventura Sive de Columbis'' ("islands of venture/winds or the pigeons", three islands, probably [[São Jorge Island|São Jorge]], [[Faial Island|Faial]] and [[Pico Island|Pico]]), and then, furthest north, are a cluster of two islands labelled ''insule de Corvis Marinis'' ('islands of the sea crows', [[Corvo Island|Corvo]] and [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]]).  Only [[Graciosa Island|Graciosa]] seems to be missing.

These Azores islands appear with these names in two subsequent [[Majorcan]] maps - the 1375 [[Catalan Atlas]] and the 1385 map of [[Guillem Soler]], with some more detailed sorting of the groups, e.g. Medici's "Ventura Sive de Columbis" label is broken into three distinct names: "San Zorzo" ("[[St. George]]", S. Jorge), ''Ventura'' (Faial) and ''Li Columbis'' (Pico); and the pair of "Corvis Marinis" are distinguished between ''Corvis Marinis'' (Corvo) and ''Li Conigi'' ("rabbits", Flores).   The anonymous Castilian author of the ''[[Libro del Conoscimiento]]'' also supplies these names, breaking up the southerly Cabrera group (which the Catalan forgot) into the islands of ''las cabras'' ("goats", S. Miguel) and ''lobo'' ("seals"? S. Maria).&lt;ref&gt;''Libro de Conoscimiento'' (1877 ed.: [https://books.google.com/books?id=0lMEEgk1U-kC&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.50]). The rest of the names are as given in the Catalan Atlas:  S. Jorge as ''sant jorge'' (S. Jorge), ''ventura'' (Faial),  ''colunbaria'' (Pico), ''brasil'' (Terceira), ''Cueruos marines'' (Corve) and ''los conjeos'' (Flores).&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the Azores islands will be officially discovered until nearly a century later, in the 1430s and 1440s.  They could simply be purely legendary, possibly of [[al-Andalus|Andalusian]] Arab origin (e.g. [[al-Idrisi]] speaks of an Atlantic island of wild goats (the Cabras) and another of "cormorants", a scavenger bird, possibly the "sea crows" of Corvis Marinis?). But outside their erroneous axis tilt, the Azores do seem clustered with reasonable accuracy on the Medici atlas. One (unproven) possibility is that the Azores were indeed discovered, or at least seen from a distance, quite by accident, by the aforementioned 1341 mapping expedition on their return via a long sailing arc (''[[volta do mar]]'') from the Canary islands.

'''Nathaniel Ames'''&lt;ref&gt;The three Nathaniel Ameses are often called I, II, and III. Nathaniel Ames II is sometimes “the elder” and his son, “the younger”.&lt;/ref&gt; (July 22, 1708 – July 11, 1764), [[United States|American]] [[almanac]]-maker and physician, published the first annual American [[almanac]]. He was the son of Nathaniel Ames first (1677–1736) and the father of Nathaniel third. The family was descended from William Ames of [[Bruton]], [[Somerset]], [[England]], whose son William emigrated to [[Massachusetts]] and settled at [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]] as early as 1640.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Captain Nathaniel Ames, father of this entry’s subject, lived at [[Bridgewater, Massachusetts|Bridgewater]] and there married Susannah Howard on December 2, 1702.&lt;ref&gt;''New England Historical and Genealogical Register'', XXI, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Six children were born to them,&lt;ref&gt;Others were Susannah (b. 1711), Seth (1713-1738), Sarah (b. 1716), Ann, and Mary.&lt;/ref&gt; of whom Nathaniel second was the eldest son.&lt;ref&gt;Ames, Fisher. ''A Bit of Ames Genealogy'', 1898, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; His father is said to have been learned in astronomy and mathematics, as well as practicing medicine. Nothing is known of his son's education, but he became a physician, probably without other medical training than instruction from his father, apprenticeship to some country doctor, and reading medical volumes.

===The first American almanac===
In 1725 he published the first annual number of his almanac, which was to become famous and remain the standard New England almanac for a half-century. At this time, he was still living at home in Bridgewater, and although the almanac bears on the title-page "by Nathaniel Ames, Jr.," it may well be that the boy, then only seventeen years old, received some help from his mathematical parent.&lt;ref&gt;''DAB''.&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to have moved to [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]] in 1732&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, S. ''The Essays, Humor, and Poems of Nathaniel Ames'', 1891, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and his name is entered from that place on the list of subscribers to Prince's ''Chronology'', to which most of the subscriptions were made in 1728.&lt;ref&gt;''New England Historical and Genealogical Register'', VI, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 14, 1735, he married Mary, daughter of Capt. Joshua Fisher of Dedham,&lt;ref&gt;A tavern keeper from as early as 1658, Captain Fisher died in 1730.&lt;/ref&gt; by whom, on October 24, 1737, he had a son, Fisher Ames, who died less than a year later, on September 17, 1738, surviving his mother, however, who had died on November 11, 1737.

===''Ames v. Gay''===
[[File:Tavern-sign-redrawn.jpg|thumb|right|Ames' offending sign, as redrawn in 1888.]]
Ames’ wife had owned a tavern and the situation gave rise to ''Ames v. Gay'', one of the famous lawsuits of New England. Ames (a compulsively litigious man) claimed inheritance to her estate according to the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Province]] law through their son Fisher against his mother-in-law Hannah, who claimed the rights to it under the [[Common law]], a struggle continued by her family after she died in December 1744. In August 1749 Ames won the case, and thus established an exception to the rule of inheritance in Massachusetts. However, two of the eleven [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court|Superior Court of Judicature]] justices were against him, leading the normally amiable Ames to an especially vituperative stance against lawyers for the rest of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Compared with other almanac makers of the day, for an anti-lawyer attitude was standard.&lt;/ref&gt; He took down his tavern sign and replaced it with a cartoon of the judges, all easily identifiable. Each was shown studying the Province laws, except the two dissenters, who had their backs turned to the law books. Chief Justice [[Paul Dudley (jurist)|Paul Dudley]], one of the dissenters, sent the sheriff to arrest Ames and confiscate the libelous portrait. Ames was warned and quickly substituted [[Gospel of Matthew|Matt.]] 16:4: “A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it.”&lt;ref&gt;Stowell, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

===A second wife===
On October 30, 1740, he married his second wife Deborah, daughter of Jeremiah Fisher, by whom he had six children, the eldest being Nathaniel third (1741–1822), and the third son being [[Fisher Ames]].&lt;ref&gt;The others were John (1760-1844, immigrated to Plymouth New York), Seth (d. 1778), Deborah, and William.&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, 1740, he was also one of the subscribers to the celebrated Land Bank.&lt;ref&gt;''New England Historical and Genealogical Register'', L, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his duties as local doctor, as publisher of the almanacs, and as amateur astronomer, Ames for many years ran the well-known "Sun" tavern, which brought him an economically and politically strategic position; as taverns often doubled as courthouses, Ames was also a common lawyer, a business that aroused the anger of trained legal practitioners. The contemporary entry in John Whiting's Diary reads "Jan. 25, 1750, Dr. Ames began to keep tavern”, although Briggs and [[George Lyman Kittredge|Kittredge]] provide different dates for the commencement of this venture.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kittredge, George Lyman. ''The Old Farmer and His Almanac'', 1904, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to live at Dedham until his death of fever in 1764. After Ames died, his widow continued to keep the tavern until she married Richard Woodward, when it became the Woodward Tavern,&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; under which name it was known as the site where the [[Suffolk Resolves]] were drawn up in 1774. It was demolished in 1817 and is now the site of the [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]] Registry of Deeds.

==Legacy==
His chief importance is as founder and editor of his almanacs, the publishing of which his son, Nathaniel third (a [[Harvard College|Harvard]] graduate and physician), continued for ten years after his father's death. The father issued the first number in 1725, three years before [[James Franklin (printer)|James Franklin]] started his in Rhode Island and eight years before [[Benjamin Franklin]] inaugurated ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]''. Ames must have been a household word throughout New England, for it is said that the circulation of his almanac, with its sharp-tongued commentary on Massachusetts politics, religion, and social life ran to 60,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Moses Coit Tyler considered it as superior to Franklin's, which it resembled in many ways. Besides the astronomical observations, Ames published short articles, extracts from the English poets, such as [[John Milton|Milton]] and [[Alexander Pope|Pope]], and used the same pithy and witty maxims as made the reputation of Franklin, such as: "All men are created equal, but differ greatly in the sequel."

He had taste for good literature and considerable wit, though some of it seems a trifle forced today, and the quality rather improved when the almanac was continued by his somewhat abler son, who nevertheless was not the genial gentleman his father was, genuinely liking only farmers and despising printers.&lt;ref&gt;Stowell, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Ames, however, undoubtedly did much to bring, if only in brief allusions and extracts, some knowledge of the better English authors to innumerable New England farmhouses.&lt;ref&gt;''DAB''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ames gave rise to an entire industry, and he had many imitators. Among those who followed in his footsteps was [[Dudley Leavitt (publisher)|Dudley Leavitt]] of [[Meredith, New Hampshire]], a teacher, newspaper publisher and [[polymath]] who published his first Leavitt's Farmers Almanack in 1797.

In 1775, during the [[Siege of Boston]], Jabez Fitch, a young officer in the Colonial Army, visited Ames' tomb in the Old Village Cemetery in Dedham.&lt;ref name=tomb/&gt;  Finding the tomb open, he entered, opened the casket, and examined the decomposing body.&lt;ref name=tomb/&gt;

[[File:Alcatraz aerial.jpg|thumb|right|The New Industries Building is the long building on the bottom right, beyond the irregularly shaped [[Model Industries Building]]]]
The '''New Industries Building''' is a building on the western end of [[Alcatraz Island]] off the coast of [[San Francisco]], USA. It was constructed in 1939 for $186,000 as part of a $1.1 million modernization scheme which also included the [[Alcatraz Water Tower|water tower]], power house, officers quarters and remodeling of the D-block.&lt;ref name="AH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alcatrazhistory.com/rock/rock-031.htm|title=The History of Alcatraz|publisher=Alcatrazhistory.com|accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground floor of the two-story 306&amp;nbsp;ft long building contained a clothing factory, dry cleaning plant, furniture plant, brush factory, and an office, where prisoners of the federal penitentiary could work for money.&lt;ref name="AH"/&gt; They made items such as gloves, furniture mats, and army uniforms.&lt;ref name="Dunbar1999"/&gt; The laundry room occupied the entire upper floor, the largest in San Francisco at the time.&lt;ref name="AH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunbar1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunbar|first=Richard|title=Alcatraz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OoXM5O9glN8C&amp;pg=PA77|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Casa Editrice Bonechi|isbn=978-88-8029-940-0|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each window has 9 panes and there are 17 bays on each floor on either side.

In recent years the building has been updated to address the erosion of the concrete and rust had caused, strengthen the walls and floors, repairing the roof and adding weatherproofed windows and door openings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/goga/parkmgmt/alcatraz-fee-program-projects.htm|title=Your Dollars At Work - Alcatraz Island|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guard Tower on the top of the building was also renovated and remounted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2733">The '''Palace School''' (''Enderun-i Hümayun Mektebi'') was a special school inside of the innermost court of [[Topkapı Palace]] that provided the education for the servants of the [[Ottoman dynasty]], who went on to staff the administrative elite of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. These were converts to Islam, young males between 8 and 20 years old, who were mostly recruited from among the rural Christian communities settled in [[Rumelia]] in a process known as ''[[Devshirme in the Ottoman Palace School|devşirme]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kemal H Karpat "Social Change and Politics in Turkey: A Structural-Historical Analysis" page 204&lt;/ref&gt;

The most promising of the latter were sent to the school located in the grounds of the imperial [[Topkapı Palace]], where they studied law, linguistics, religion, music, art, and fighting, as well as performing functions as palace staff.

In parallel with the male segment of the school, the women of the [[Imperial Harem|imperial harem]] were also given an education. The girls of the palace school were taught the principles of Islam, as well as practical skills such as sewing, embroidering, dancing, singing, music, story-telling, and basic literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Necipoğlu |first=Gülru |authorlink=Gülru Necipoğlu|title=Architecture, Ceremonial, and Power: The Topkapı Palace in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries |date=1991 |place=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-14050-0 |pages=111–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing their respective educations, male and female graduates were frequently married off to one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Necipoğlu |first=Gülru|authorlink=Gülru Necipoğlu|title=Architecture, Ceremonial, and Power: The Topkapı Palace in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries |date=1991 |place=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-14050-0 |pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Qayyūm al-asmā''' (Arabic: قيوم الأسماء) - is the first long work of  Siyyid `Alí Muhammad Shírází (Arabic: سيد علي محمد شيرازي) - the [[Báb]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bab-ali-mohammad-sirazi BĀB, ʿAli Moḥammad Širāzi. Encyclopedia Iranical online]&lt;/ref&gt;. Also known as the Tafsir Surat Yusuf, This is an essay that was written as a commentary to Surah 12 in the Qur'an: [[Surat Yusuf]] (سورة يوسف). This composition is similar in its structure to the Qur'an itself: it contains 111 chapters ([[Surahs]]), each of which contains 42 sentences.

==The name of the essay==
In the standard English translation, the name of the essay is "Qayyūm al-asmā'". Its meaning in Arabic is "the maintainer of the names". The names here refer to the 99 names of God in Islam. "Existence" (qayyum) is the name numbered 63. The book is sometimes called the Surat Yusuf (Surah interpretation of Joseph), or Ahsan al-Qisas (Arabic: best story of all stories), meaning the best story. Ahsan al-Qisas  is a well-known name for Surat Yusuf in general and not necessarily related to the interpretation of the Báb in particular.

==History==
Qayyūm al-asmā is considered to be the first long book written by the Báb after 22 May 1844. On May 22, 1844, the Báb proclaimed himself as a revelation and divine missionary, and as the Báb, or the [[Imam]] or the messiah whom the Shiites are waiting to return at the end of days, to fill the earth with justice after being filled with oppression, and he who signifies the eschatological age and the end of human history&lt;ref&gt;Denis MacEOIN, The Sources of Early Babi Doctrine and History: A Survey. Pages 42-43., Leiden: Brill, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;. In Kitab-e Ikan (Farsi: The Book of Iqan), [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the [[Bahá'í]] religion, which developed from  the [[Bábism| Bábi]] doctrines, writes about Qayyūm al-asmā: "[This is] the first of the books&lt;ref&gt;کتاب ایقان، حضرت بهاءالله. صفحة 80، فقرة 2., لجنه ملّي نشر آثار بهائى زبان فارسى وعربى - آلمان, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;. According to evidence, the first surah of the book, called Surat al-Muluk (Arabic: Surah al-Maluk) (Surah of the Kings) was written in the presence of Mullah Hussein Bushru'i on the evening of May 22, 1844&lt;ref&gt; Denis MacEOIN, The Sources of Early Babi Doctrine and History: A Survey. Page 55., Brill: Leiden, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;.

According to the claims of Bábi believers, the writing the book - hundreds of pages long - was relatively short. It is described in the writings of the believers that the Báb wrote the entire book in 40 days, with a kind of ecstasy of divine inspiration. It should be noted, however, that academic sources disagree with the length of the period in which the book was written. Some believe that the number forty is typological only and does not necessarily indicate a period of exactly forty days&lt;ref&gt;Tod Lawson and Omid Ghaemmaghami. A Most Noble Pattern: Collected Essays on the Writings of the Báb,`Alí Muhammad Shirazi (1819-1850). p. 7, George Ronald Bahai Studies Series&lt;/ref&gt;. It is assumed that his writing took several months. Qayyūm al-asmā was the central book of the Bábi sect in its first year. Preachers of the Bábi faith, like Mullah Hussein Bushru'i, took copies of the essay and distributed it outside of Shiraz&lt;ref&gt; Denis MacEOIN, The Sources of Early Babi Doctrine and History: A Survey. Page 56, Leiden: Brill, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Structure and content of the essay==
The composition consists of 111 Surahs, similar to the number of verses in the Quranic Surat Yusuf. At the top of each sura appears the basmalah (in Arabic: البسملة), meaning the Muslim saying, "Bassem al-lah (al-rahim)," which appears at the top of every sura in the Quran, with the exception of the ninth surah. The appearance of this formula, which is unique to the structure of the Koran, adds to the imagination that the author sought to create between the existence of al-Asma and the holy book of Islam. In addition to this formula, one can discern another Quranic characteristic in the existence of al-Asma - at the beginning of the Surahs there appear mysterious 'separate letters', similar to those in the Quran.

This composition is different from any regular interpretation of Surat Yusuf: Much of the book interprets the religious and messianic doctrines of the Báb, with a slight connection to the Quranic Surah. There are almost no elements in the composition that mention the interpretation of a typical Quran, but it is a kind of new composition that stands by itself. In the few times that the Báb writes an interpretation of any verse, this interpretation is in the form of an allegorical and esoteric interpretation - Tawil (Arabic: تأويل) and not a Tafsir (Arabic: تفسير)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/exegesis-iv Exegesis In Aḵbārī and Post-Safavid Esoteric Shiʿism. Encyclopedia Iranica online]&lt;/ref&gt;.

As stated, this method of interpretation in the essay is allegorical-esoteric and mystical one (Arabic: تأويل) . It is a commentary which is actually a revelation. In this work, the interpretation of the Qur'an becomes a divine revelation, and revelation is used as a tool for interpretation. The entire composition is inspired by the model of the Quranic style, with a considerable amount of Quranic terminology. For example, in Sura 4 verse 13 in the Qayyūm al-asmā, the Báb writes: "We [the Hidden Imam] have brought down this book about our servant and our servant [the ba'b] [by virtue of] a divine permit [in a form that] resembles [the Quran]&lt;ref&gt;حضرة الباب، قيوم الاسماء: تفسير سورة يوسف. 4:13, تحقيق وطبع: سيفي النعيمي, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the first Surah of the Book, the Hidden Imam says: "We have revealed to you [to the Báb] all that God has revealed to us [the imams]&lt;ref&gt; حضرة الباب، قيوم الاسماء: تفسير سورة يوسف. 1:28, تحقيق وطبع: سيفي النعيمي, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;." Here the Báb is depicted as a mediator between the Hidden Imam and humanity. 

Along with these 'moderate' statements, one can find in the book 'bold' statements that describe this book as a new revelation from God, that is, as the new Quran. These statements bring the status of the Báb closer to that of a prophet. Elsewhere in the book one can find verses that proclaim the Báb as a divine manifestation of himself, i.e., as the Manifestation of God on earth: "Indeed I am God, and there is no god but me" (Al-Asmaa, Sura 22, 21).

[[File:IUPAC Green Book 3 ed cover.jpg|right|thumb|Front cover of the ''Green Book'']]
'''''Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry''''', also known as the '''''Green Book''''', is a compilation of terms and symbols widely used in the field of [[physical chemistry]].  It also includes a table of [[physical constant]]s, tables listing the properties of [[elementary particle]]s, [[chemical element]]s, and [[nuclide]]s, and information about conversion factors that are commonly used in physical chemistry.  The ''Green Book'' is published by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) and is based on published, citeable sources.  Information in the ''Green Book'' is synthesized from recommendations made by IUPAC, the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]] (IUPAP) and the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), including recommendations listed in the IUPAP Red Book ''Symbols, Units, Nomenclature and Fundamental Constants in Physics'' and in the [[ISO 31]] standards.

==History, list of editions, and translations to non-English languages==

The third edition of the ''Green Book'' ({{ISBN|978-0-85404-433-7}}) was first published by IUPAC in 2007.  A second printing of the third edition was released in 2008; this printing made several minor revisions to the 2007 text.  A third printing of the third edition was released in 2011.  The text of the third printing is identical to that of the second printing.

A Japanese translation of the third edition of the ''Green Book'' ({{ISBN|978-4-06-154359-1}}) was published in 2009.  A French translation of the third edition of the ''Green Book'' ({{ISBN|978-2-8041-7207-7}}) was published in 2012.

A concise four-page summary of the most important material in the ''Green Book'' was published in the July–August 2011 issue of ''Chemistry International'', the IUPAC news magazine.

The second edition of the ''Green Book'' ({{ISBN|0-632-03583-8}}) was first published in 1993.  It was reprinted in 1995, 1996, and 1998.

The ''Green Book'' is a direct successor of the ''Manual of Symbols and Terminology for Physicochemical Quantities and Units'', originally prepared for publication on behalf of IUPAC's Physical Chemistry Division by M. L. McGlashen in 1969.  A full history of the Green Book's various editions is provided in the historical introduction to the third edition.

The second edition and the third edition (second printing) of the ''Green Book'' have both been made available online as PDF files; the PDF version of the third edition is fully searchable. The four-page concise summary is also available online as a PDF file. [[Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry#External links|External Links (below)]].

==Handy content==
In addition to the obvious data on quantities, units and symbols, the compilation contains some less obvious but very useful information on related topics.

===Quantity calculus===
Unit conversion is a notorious source of errors. Many people apply individual rules, e.g. "to obtain length in centimeters multiply the length in inches by 2.54", but combining several such conversions is laborious and prone to mistakes. A better way is to use the [[Dimensional_analysis#The_factor-label_method_for_converting_units|factor-label method]], which is closely related to [[dimensional analysis]], and [[quantity calculus]] explained in sections 1.1 and 7.1 of this compilation.

===Scientific typography===
Section 1.3 explains the rules for writing scientific symbols and names, for example, where to use capital letters or italics, and where their use is incorrect. No typographical rule seems to be missing, even such detail as whether "20°C" or "20 °C" is the correct form.

===Atomic units===
Section 3.8 introduces [[atomic units]] and gives a table of atomic units of various physical quantities and the conversion factor to the [[International System of Units|SI units]]. Section 7.3(v) gives a concise but clear tutorial on practical use of atomic units, in particular how to understand equations "written in atomic units".

'''''Shultz v. Wheaton Glass Co.''''', [[Case citation|421 F.2d 259]] (3rd Cir. 1970) was a case heard before the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] in 1970. It is an important case in studying the impact of the [[Bennett Amendment]] on Chapter VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], helping to define the limitations of [[Equal pay for equal work|equal pay]] for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gaye | first = Luna | title = Understanding gender-based wage discrimination: legal interpretation and trends of pay equity in higher education | journal = Journal of Law &amp; Education | year = 1990 | issue = 19 | page = 371 | url = https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=info:jXGXxUEPvUYJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;output=viewport&amp;pg=1 | quote = ...first cases to discuss the Bennett Amendment, and consequently to consider the relationship between the EPA and Title VII, was Shultz v.

[[Image:Poucet11.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Hop-o'-My-Thumb]] stealing the Seven-league boots from the [[Ogre]], by [[Gustave Doré]]]]

'''Seven-league boots''' are an element in [[European folklore]]. The [[boot]] allows the person wearing them to take strides of seven [[league (unit)|leagues]] per step, resulting in great speed. The boots are often presented by a magical character to the [[protagonist]] to aid in the completion of a significant task.

Mention of the legendary boots are found in:
* [[Germany]] – [[Sweetheart Roland]], [[Adelbert von Chamisso]]'s ''[[Peter Schlemiel]]'', [[Goethe's Faust]] ([[Mephistopheles]] uses them at the start of Part Two, Act Four&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goethe|title=Faust, Part Two|year=1959|publisher=Penguin|location=Middlesex|isbn=0 14044093 3|pages=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; ), [[Wilhelm Hauff]]'s "[[Die Geschichte vom kleinen Muck|Der Kleine Muck]]"

[[Germany]] mentioned by Karl Marx in The Holy Family (1844) at the end of section (c) of Chapter VI and used in a metaphor in which weighted seven-league boots create a barrier to overcoming an obstacle. 
* [[France]] – [[Charles Perrault|Charles Perrault's]] - ''[[Hop o' My Thumb]]'', [[Madame d'Aulnoy|Madame d'Aulnoy's]] ''[[The Bee and the Orange Tree]]''
* [[Norway]] – [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]] - ''[[Soria Moria Castle]]'' 
* [[Great Britain|Britain]] – [[Jack the Giant Killer]], [[John Masefield]]'s ''[[The Midnight Folk]]'', [[C.S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Regress]]'', [[Terry Pratchett]]'s [[The Light Fantastic]], [[The Bartimaeus Trilogy]], [[Jenny Nimmo]]'s ''[[Midnight for Charlie Bone]]'', [[Diana Wynne Jones]]' ''[[Howl's Moving Castle]]'', [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s "[[The Loved One]]," [[E. Nesbit]]'s "[[The Enchanted Castle]],"
* [[United States]] – [[Zane Grey]]'s ''The Last of the Plainsmen'', [[Ruth Chew]]'s "What the Witch Left," [[Gail Carson Levine]]'s "[[The Two Princesses of Bamarre]]," [[Mark Twain]]'s "The Innocents Abroad," [[Roger Zelazny]]'s "Bring Me the Head of Prince Charming," [[Beverly Gray#Clair_Blank|Clair Blank]]'s "[[Beverly Gray#Beverly_Gray_at_the_World's_Fair|Beverly Gray at the World's Fair]]"

== Etymology ==
From the context of English language, 'Seven-league boots' originally arose as a translation from the French 'bottes de sept lieues',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/seven-league%20boots|title=the definition of seven-league boots|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; popularised by [[Charles Perrault|Charles Perrault's]] fairy tales. A league (roughly {{convert|3|mi|km}}) was considered to represent the distance walked in an hour by an average man. If a man were to walk 7 hours per day, he would then walk 7 leagues, or about {{convert|21|mi|km}}. In the 17th century, post-boys' boots were called 'seven-league boots'. While some suggest that the '7 leagues' references the distance between post houses (post-boys would only have their boots touch the ground at every coach inn, when changing the horses), this is inaccurate: the distance between coach inns was fixed at no more than 5 leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Jobé |title=Au temps des cochers : histoire illustrée du voyage en voiture attelée du XVe au XXe siècle |location=Lausanne |publisher=Édita-Lazarus |year=1976 |page=54 |isbn=2-88001-019-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Folklore ====

* [[Russian folklore]] has a similar magic item called сапоги-скороходы (fast-walker boots), which allows the person wearing them to walk and run at an amazing pace.

* Seven League Boots are a library artifact used several times in ''The Grimm Legacy'', written by [[Polly Shulman]].
* Seven-league-boots are used in [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' books by the wizards of Unseen University. It is noted that, as their mode of operation places the user's feet twenty-one miles apart, skipping the required preparations leads to spectacular but tragic incidents.
*The character Jack is reported to have attempted to use the boots to win the Boston Marathon in [[Fables (comic)|''Fables'' (comic)]].
*Seven League Boots are used by Princess Addie in ''[[The Two Princesses of Bamarre]]'' by [[Gail Carson Levine]].

In ''The Amulet of Samarkand'', Bartimaeus remarks that the boots were created in Medieval Europe by imprisoning a [[Genie|djinni]] in each boot who could operate on a theoretical ''eighth'' plane.  Because of this, normal rules of time and space do not apply to them.
*Seven League Boots are used by [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Savant]] in the Wildstorm comic ''[[WildCATS]]''.
*Seven League Boots were used in an episode of ''[[Fox's Peter Pan and the Pirates]]'' in which [[Captain Hook]] steals magical boots from a fairy that allow him to leap great distances and fly in order to make it easier for him to hunt down [[Peter Pan]].

==== Games ====

*Boots of speed are a frequent item in [[role-playing game]]s and [[roguelike]]s. In the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' role-playing game, boots of speed are a variation of the famous magical boots. They enable the person wearing them to run very fast. In most cases, as fast as a galloping horse, or bit slower if the person wearing them is slow to move around. The person wearing them must usually rest for long periods after use. They are sometimes referred to as 7 League Boots.
*7 League Boots (or simply "boots", if the item isn't detailed) are a usable item in the game ''[[Ogre Battle: March of the Black Queen]]''. If used, they transport a player's unit to any freed town in the current map.
*Seven-League Step are a unique pair of boots from the game ''[[Path of Exile]]'' which greatly increase the movement speed of the wearer.

'''Share transmission''' is a mechanism by which the title to [[Share (finance)|share]]s is devolved other than by transfer. This is typically applicable for:
* devolution by death
* succession
* inheritance
* bankruptcy
* marriage

When a previous owner of shares dies and his shares are inherited by his personal representatives or heirs, this is called transmission of shares.Shares may be inherited only by production of probate of a will of the deceased owner or letters of administration of his estate granted by the High Court.(section 148 of COMPANIES AND ALLIED MATTERS ACT (CAMA)under NIGERIAN LAW ).  The beneficiaries of the shares by transmission must have their names entered in the register of members of the company or elect a nominee to hold the shares on their behalf.  In this case the nominee’s name shall be entered in the Register of members of the company to become a member of the company.(section 155 (3) of CAMA).

== Transfers on Transmission of shares ==

Transmission of shares occurs when the shares of a deceased share holder are inherited or bequeathed to an heir or personal representative of the deceased shareholder. Where shares are held by two or more persons jointly then upon death of one or more of them, the surviving person shall be entitled to all the shares and they may be transferred to his name. Where the shareholder held the shares as a sole owner, then his shares may be transferred only to the person named in his will or if he died without a will, then to the person who obtains letters of administration from the High Court in respect of the shares or the deceased’s property. Section 148 of CAMA.  The above are in Law recognized as the personal representatives of the deceased share holder and are entitled to have his shares transferred to them or their nominee. (Section 155 of CAMA).

=== Protection of Beneficiaries under a will ===  
Sometimes a deceased member may name some persons as the administrators of his estate who are to ensure the deceased’s properties are distributed and/or managed as stated in the will.  These persons therefore inherit the deceased persons shares on behalf and for the benefit of those who are named in the will as the beneficiaries inherit. The administrators therefore only have an equitable right in the shares but not the beneficial rights.This right becomes a legal right only when the shares are transferred to those entitled under the will.  It is the duty of the executors of the will who in this case are the personal representatives of the deceased to ensure that they nominate those entitled to the shares under the will as those to whom the shares should be transferred to. (section 155 (3) of CAMA).

Any person claiming to have an interest in any shares or the dividends or interest on those shares may protect his interest by swearing to an affidavit indicating the nature of his interest and serving the company with the affidavit.  The company shall then enter on the register of members the fact that such notice has been served on the company.  The company shall therefore not register any transfer of shares of the deceased in respect of which it had received the affidavit of interest. 
Any company which receives this notice of interest and in default proceeds to register any transfer in favor of any other person shall be personally liable to the person who lodged the notice of interest for any loss he suffers thereby.  (Section 156 of CAMA) 
The Company shall give notice of at least 42 days to any other person seeking a transfer to him, of the shares complained of, for the matter to be resolved otherwise, the proposed transfer will not be effected. section 156 (2)CAMA.
 
''Ownership'': on registration of the transmission of shares, the person entitled to transmission of shares becomes the shareholder of the company and is entitled to all rights and subject to all liabilities as such shareholder.

''Method'': while transfer of shares is brought about by delivery of a proper instrument of transfer (viz, [[transfer deed]]) duly stamped and executed, transmission of shares is done by forwarding the necessary documents (such as a notarised copy of death certificate) to the company.

==Legal process==
In the case of death, the surviving shareholders have to submit a request letter supported by an attested copy of the death certificate of the deceased shareholder and the relevant share certificates. The company’s registrar and share transfer agent on receipt of the said documents will delete the name of deceased shareholder from its records and return the share certificates to the applicant/registered holder with necessary endorsement.

The '''Smithsonian Institution Building''', located near the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] behind the [[National Museum of African Art]] and the [[Sackler Gallery]], houses the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s administrative offices and information center. The building is constructed of [[Seneca Quarry|Seneca red]] [[sandstone]] in the faux [[Norman architecture|Norman]] style (a 12th-century combination of late [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and early [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] motifs; built in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] and [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque]] [[Revivalism (architecture)|revival]] styles) and is nicknamed '''The Castle'''. It was completed in 1855 and designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;

==History==
The Castle was the first Smithsonian building, designed by architect [[James Renwick, Jr.]], whose other works include [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] in [[New York City]] and the Smithsonian's [[Renwick Gallery]], also in Washington D.C. The building committee held a nationwide design competition in 1846 and selected Renwick's design by a unanimous vote. A cardboard model of Renwick's winning design survives and is on display in the Castle. Renwick was assisted by [[Robert Mills (architect)|Robert Mills]],&lt;ref name="nrhpinv1"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|id=66000867}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination: Smithsonian Institution Building|last=Morton|first=W. Brown III|date=February 8, 1971|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in the internal arrangement of the building.&lt;ref name="bldgsdc"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Pamela|author2=Lee, Antoinette J. |title=Buildings of the District of Columbia|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=1993|pages=94–96|chapter=The Mall|isbn=0-19-509389-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:JosephHenry-SmithsonianCastle-20050517.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A [[Professor Joseph Henry|statue]] of [[Joseph Henry]] is displayed in front of the building.]]
Initially intended to be built in white marble, then in yellow sandstone,&lt;ref name="bldgsdc"/&gt; the architect and building committee finally settled on Seneca red sandstone from the [[Seneca Quarry]] in [[Montgomery County, Maryland]]. The redstone was substantially less expensive than granite or marble, and while initially easy to work, was found to harden to a satisfactory degree on exposure to the elements.&lt;ref name="castleandquarry"&gt;{{cite book|last=Peck|first=Garrett|title=The Smithsonian Castle and the Seneca Quarry|year=2013|publisher=The History Press|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=978-1609499297|pages=42–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly evidence indicates it is likely that slaves were employed at Seneca in quarrying stone for the Castle, though no evidence has surfaced that slaves were involved in the actual Castle construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Auslander|first=Mark|title=Enslaved Labor and Building the Smithsonian: Reading the Stones |work=Southern Spaces |date=December 12, 2012 |url=http://www.southernspaces.org/2012/enslaved-labor-and-building-smithsonian-reading-stones }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building committee selected Gilbert Cameron as the general contractor, and construction began in 1847. The East Wing was completed in 1849 and occupied by Secretary [[Joseph Henry]] and his family. The West Wing was completed later the same year. A structural collapse in 1850 of partly completed work raised questions of workmanship and resulted in a change to fireproof construction. The Castle's exterior was completed in 1852; Renwick's work was completed and he withdrew from further participation. Cameron continued the interior work, which he completed in 1855.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv1"/&gt; Construction funds came from "accrued interest on the [[Smithsonian Institution#Founding|Smithson bequest]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = PROCEEDINGS OF THE MEETING OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS | date = May 13, 1977 | publisher = Smithsonian Institution | page = 49 | chapter = SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION POLICIES GOVERNING THE USE OF FEDERALLY APPROPRIATED FUNDS; FEDERALLY AND PRIVATELY FINANCED CONTRACTS AND GRANTS; AND TRUST FUNDS | quote = The construction of the original Smithsonian Building in 1847-1855 was funded from the accrued interest on the Smithson bequest.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the upgraded fireproof construction, a fire in 1865 caused extensive damage to the upper floor of the building, destroying the correspondence of [[James Smithson]], Henry's papers, two hundred oil paintings of American Indians by [[John Mix Stanley]], the Regent's Room and the lecture hall, and the contents of the public libraries of [[Alexandria, Virginia]] and [[Beaufort, South Carolina]], confiscated by Union forces during the [[American Civil War]]. The ensuing renovation was undertaken by local Washington architect [[Adolph Cluss|Adolf Cluss]] in 1865-67. Further fireproofing work ensued in 1883, also by Cluss, who by this time had designed the neighboring [[Arts and Industries Building]]. A third and fourth floor were added to the East Wing, and a third floor to the West Wing. Electric lighting was installed in 1895.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv1"/&gt;

Around 1900 the wooden floor of the Great Hall was replaced with [[terrazzo]] and a Children's Museum was installed near the south entrance. A tunnel connected to the Arts and Industries Building. A general renovation took place in 1968-70 to install modern electrical systems, elevators and heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv1"/&gt; The [[Enid A. Haupt Garden]] was dedicated in 1987, along with the Renwick Gate facing Independence Avenue, built from Seneca redstone retrieved from the demolished D.C. Jail.

==Description==
[[File:East entrance - Smithsonian Institution Building.JPG|thumb|East entrance to the Smithsonian Institution Building]]
James Renwick designed the Castle as the focal point of a picturesque landscape on the Mall, using elements from [[Georg Moller]]'s ''Denkmäler der deutschen Baukunst''.  Renwick originally intended to detail the building with entirely American sculptural flora in the manner of [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]]'s work at the [[United States Capitol]], but the final work used conventional pattern-book designs.&lt;ref name="bldgsdc"/&gt;

The building is completed in the [[Gothic Revival]] style with [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] motifs. This style was chosen to evoke the [[Collegiate Gothic]] in England and the ideas of knowledge and wisdom. The façade is built with red sandstone from the [[Seneca Quarry|Seneca quarry]] in [[Seneca, Maryland]] in contrast to the granite, marble and yellow sandstone from the other major buildings in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="castleandquarry"/&gt;

[[File:Smithsonian Institution Castle.jpg|thumb|left|The Castle c. 1870]]The building comprises a central section, two extensions or ranges, and two wings. Four towers contain occupiable space, while five smaller towers are primarily decorative, although some contain stairs. As constructed, the central section contained the main entry and museum space (now the Great Hall), with a basement beneath and a large lecture room above. Two galleries on the second floor were used to display artifacts and art. This area is now the Visitor's Information and Associates' Reception area. The East Range contained laboratory space on the first floor and research space on the second. The East Wing contained storage space on the first floor and a suite of rooms on the second as an apartment for the Secretary of the Smithsonian. This space is currently used as administrative offices and archives. The West Range was one story and used as a reading room. The West Wing, known as the chapel, was used as a library.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv1"/&gt; The West Wing and Range are now used as a quiet room for visitors to go.

On the exterior, the principal tower on the south side is {{convert|91|ft|m}} high and {{convert|37|ft|m}} square. On the north side there are two towers, the taller on {{convert|145|ft|m}} tall. A [[campanile]] at the northeast corner is {{convert|17|ft|m}} square and {{convert|117|ft|m}} tall.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv1"/&gt;

The plan allowed for expansion at either end, a major reason for the informal medievally-inspired design, which would not suffer if asymmetrically developed.&lt;ref name="bldgsdc"/&gt;

==Current use==
The Smithsonian Castle houses the administrative offices of the Smithsonian. The main Smithsonian visitor center is also located here, with interactive displays and maps. Computers electronically answer most common questions. A crypt just inside the north entrance houses the tomb of [[James Smithson]].&lt;ref name="smithson1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/historic/history.htm#sib|title=Smithsonian Institution Building|work=Histories of the Smithsonian Institution's Museums and Research Centers|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=May 11, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213204530/http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/historic/history.htm#sib|archivedate=February 13, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Stadtarchiv Hannover''' is the city archive for the German city of [[Hannover]] and the largest municipal archive in [[Lower Saxony]]. Originating before 1300 and still with strong medieval holdings, its collects documents produced by the mayor, city council and bureaucracy. Its earliest surviving document dates to 1241 and the only pre-modern gap in its records results from the Knochenhauer-Amtshaus fire of 1428. The catalogue was stored offsite during [[World War Two]] and survived, though building registry documents were destroyed by [[Bombing of Hanover in World War II|firebombing in 1943]]. A flash flood in 1946 also destroyed 19th century documents.

'''Swordfish''' (''Xiphias gladius''), also known as '''broadbills''' in some countries, are large, [[highly migratory]], [[predatory fish]] characterized by a long, flat bill. They are a popular sport fish of the [[billfish]] category, though elusive. Swordfish are elongated, round-bodied, and lose all teeth and scales by adulthood. These fish are found widely in tropical and temperate parts of the [[Atlantic]], [[Pacific]], and [[Indian Ocean]]s, and can typically be found from near the surface to a depth of {{convert|550|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; They commonly reach {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} in length, and the maximum reported is {{convert|4.55|m|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|650|kg|abbr=on}} in weight.&lt;ref name=FishBase/&gt;&lt;ref name=Florida&gt;Gardieff, S. ''[http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/Gallery/Descript/Swordfish/Swordfish.html Swordfish.]'' Florida Museum of Natural History. Accessed 26 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

They are the sole member of their [[Family (biology)|family]], '''Xiphiidae'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase family | family = Xiphiidae | month = December | year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taxonomy and etymology==
The swordfish is named after its pointed, flat bill, which resembles a [[sword]].  The species name, ''Xiphias gladius'', derives from [[Greek Language|Greek]] {{wiktgrc|ξιφίας}} (''xiphias'', "swordfish"), itself from {{wiktgrc|ξίφος}} (''xiphos'', "sword") and from [[Latin language|Latin]] {{wiktlat|gladius}} ("sword").&lt;ref name=Florida/&gt; This makes it superficially similar to other [[billfish]] such as [[marlin]], but upon examination, their physiology is quite different and they are members of different families.&lt;ref&gt;Pepperell, J. 2010. ''Fishes of the Open Ocean: A Natural History and Illustrated Guide.'' {{ISBN|978-0-226-65539-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
They commonly reach {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} in length, and the maximum reported is {{convert|4.55|m|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|650|kg|abbr=on}} in weight.&lt;ref name=FishBase/&gt;&lt;ref name=Florida/&gt; The [[International Game Fish Association]]'s all-tackle angling record for a swordfish was a {{convert|1182|lb|abbr=on|order=flip}} specimen taken off [[Chile]] in 1953.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; Females are larger than males, and Pacific swordfish reach a greater size than northwest Atlantic and [[Mediterranean]] swordfish.&lt;ref name=Florida/&gt; They reach maturity at 4–5 years of age and the maximum age is believed to be at least 9 years.&lt;ref name=Florida/&gt; The oldest swordfish found in a recent study were a 16-year-old female and 12-year-old male. Swordfish ages are derived, with difficulty, from annual rings on fin rays rather than [[otolith]]s, since their otoliths are small in size.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Marsh, Margot Stiles, 2007. "Seafood Watch, Seafood Report, Monterey Bay Aquarium, [http://safinacenter.org/documents/2014/06/swordfish-seafood-watch-species-report.pdf]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Swordfish are [[ectotherm]]ic animals; however, along with some species of [[shark]]s, they have special organs next to their [[eye]]s to heat their eyes and brains. Temperatures of {{convert|10|to|15|C-change|abbr=on}} above the surrounding water temperature have been measured.  The heating of the eyes greatly improves their [[Visual perception|vision]], and consequently improves their ability to catch prey.&lt;ref name=warmeye1&gt;Fritsches, K.A., Brill, R.W., and Warrant, E.J. 2005. ''[http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(04)00996-0 Warm Eyes Provide Superior Vision in Swordfishes.]'' Current Biology 15: 55–58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=warmeye2&gt;Hopkin, M. (2005). ''[http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050110/full/050110-2.html Swordfish heat their eyes for better vision.]'' Nature, 10 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 25 000+ fish species, only 22 are known to have a mechanism to conserve heat. These include the swordfish, [[marlin]], [[tuna]], and some sharks.&lt;ref name=warmeye1/&gt;&lt;ref name=warmeye2/&gt;

== Behavior and ecology ==
[[File:Swordfish skeleton.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Swordfish skeleton at the [[National Museum of Natural History]], [[Washington, DC]]]]

Contrary to popular belief, the "sword" is not used to spear, but instead may be used to slash at its prey to injure the prey animal, to make for an easier catch.&lt;ref name=Florida/&gt;  Mainly, the swordfish relies on its great speed and agility in the water to catch its prey. It is undoubtedly among the fastest fish, but the basis for the frequently quoted speed of {{convert|60|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}} is unreliable.&lt;ref name=speed&gt;ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research. ''[http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/topics/r_haulin'_bass.htm Haulin' Bass.]'' Quote: ''"The 60 mph figure listed for the swordfish is based on a corrupted version of calculations made by Sir James Gray to estimate the impact speed necessary for a hypothetical 600-lb swordfish to embed its sword 3 feet in the timbers of ships, as has been known to occur; the figure seems to have entered the literature without question."'' Accessed 26 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swordfish prefer water temperatures between {{convert|18|and|22|C|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; but have the widest tolerance among billfish, and can be found from {{convert|5|to|27|C|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Florida/&gt; This highly migratory species typically moves towards colder regions to feed during the summer.&lt;ref name=Florida/&gt; Swordfish feed daily, most often at night, when they rise to surface and near-surface waters in search of smaller fish. During the day, they commonly occur to depths of {{convert|550|m|abbr=on}} and have exceptionally been recorded as deep as {{convert|2878|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; Adults feed on a wide range of [[pelagic fish]], such as [[mackerel]], [[barracudina]]s, [[silver hake]], [[Sebastes|rockfish]], [[herring]], and [[lanternfish]]es, but they also take [[demersal fish]], [[squid]], and [[crustacean]]s.&lt;ref name=FishBase/&gt;&lt;ref name=Florida/&gt; In the northwestern Atlantic, a survey based on the stomach content of 168 individuals found 82% had eaten squid and 53% had eaten fish, including [[Gadidae|gadids]], [[scombrid]]s, [[butterfish]], [[bluefish]], and [[sand lance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stillwell | first1 =  | last2 = Kohler | year = 1985 | title = Food and feeding ecology of the swordfish Xiphias gladius in the western North Atlantic Ocean with estimates of daily ration | url = http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/22/m022p239.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 239–241 | doi=10.3354/meps022239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large prey are typically slashed with the sword, while small are swallowed whole.&lt;ref name=Florida/&gt;

[[File:Swordfish-0046.jpg|thumb|350px|Stuffed broadbill swordfish]]
Swordfish are not [[Shoaling and schooling|schooling]] fish. They swim alone or in very loose aggregations, separated by as much as {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} from a neighboring swordfish. They are frequently found basking at the surface, airing their first dorsal fin. Boaters report this to be a beautiful sight, as is the powerful jumping for which the species is known. This jumping, also called breaching, may be an effort to dislodge pests, such as [[remora]]s or [[lampreys]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}
 
Almost 50 species of [[Parasitism|parasites]] have been documented in swordfish. In addition to remoras, lampreys, and [[cookiecutter shark]]s, this includes a wide range of invertebrates, such as [[tapeworm]]s, [[roundworm]]s, and [[copepod]]s.&lt;ref name=Florida/&gt; A comparison of the parasites of swordfish in the [[Atlantic]] and in the [[Mediterranean]] indicated that some parasites, particularly [[Anisakis]] spp. larvae identified by genetic markers, could be used as biological tags and support the existence of a Mediterranean swordfish [[Fish stock|stock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mattiucci | first1 = S. | last2 = Garcia | first2 = A. | last3 = Cipriani | first3 = P. | last4 = Santos | first4 = M.

Fully adult swordfish have few natural predators. Among marine mammals, [[killer whale]]s sometimes prey on adult swordfish.&lt;ref name=Florida/&gt; The [[shortfin mako]], an exceptionally fast species of shark, sometimes take on swordfish; dead or dying shortfin makos have been found with broken-off swords in their heads, revealing the danger of this type of prey.&lt;ref name=mako&gt;The Shark Trust. {{cite web |url=http://sharks-med.netfirms.com/med/mako.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714165639/http://sharks-med.netfirms.com/med/mako.htm |archivedate=2011-07-14 |title=Shortfin mako|accessdate=2011-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Juvenile swordfish are far more vulnerable to predation,  and are eaten by a wide range of predatory fish.&lt;ref name=Florida/&gt;

=== Breeding ===
In the North Pacific, batch spawning mainly occurs in water warmer than {{convert|24|C|abbr=on}} during the spring and summer, and year-round in the equatorial Pacific.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; In the North Atlantic, spawning is known from the [[Sargasso Sea]],&lt;ref name=fishbase&gt;{{FishBase species | genus = Xiphias | species = gladius | month = December | year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in water warmer than {{convert|23|C|abbr=on}} and less than {{convert|75|m|abbr=on}} deep.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; Spawning occurs from November to February in the South Atlantic off southern [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; Spawning is year-round in the [[Caribbean Sea]] and other warm regions of the west Atlantic.&lt;ref name=Florida/&gt;

Large females can carry more eggs than small females, and between 1 million to 29 million eggs have been recorded.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; The pelagic eggs measure {{convert|1.6|-|1.8|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter and 2.5 days after fertilization, the embryonic development occurs.&lt;ref name=fishbase/&gt;&lt;ref name=Florida/&gt; The surface-living and unique-looking larvae are {{convert|4|mm|abbr=on}} long at hatching.&lt;ref name=FishBase/&gt;&lt;ref name=Florida/&gt; The bill is evident when the larvae reach {{convert|1|cm|abbr=on|1}} in length.&lt;ref name=FishBase/&gt;

==Fisheries==
[[File:Barca pescespada 3.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Felucca]] used in the [[Strait of Messina]] to hunt swordfish]]
[[File:Fisheries capture of Xiphias gladius.png|thumb|400px|right|&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;Global capture of swordfish in tonnes reported by the [[FAO]], 1950–2009&lt;ref name=FAOdata&gt;Based on data sourced from the relevant [http://www.fao.org/fishery/species/search/en FAO Species Fact Sheets]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;]]

Swordfish were harvested by a variety of methods at small scale (notably [[harpoon]] fishing) until the global expansion of [[long-line fishing]]. They have been fished widely since ancient times in places such as the [[Strait of Messina]], where they are still fished with traditional wooden boats called [[felucca]]s and are part of the cuisine in that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuke.prolocobagnara.it/BagnaraCalabra/Storia/LaPesca/LaPescadelPescespada/tabid/495/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426081914/http://nuke.prolocobagnara.it/BagnaraCalabra/Storia/LaPesca/LaPescadelPescespada/tabid/495/Default.aspx |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biologiamarina.eu/PesceSpada.html|title=La pesca del pesce spada|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ganzirri.it/spip.php?article9|title=La tecnica per la pesca del pescespada e la "Feluca" – [Ganzirri, il Peloro e lo Stretto di Messina]|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swordfish are vigorous, powerful fighters. When hooked or harpooned, they have been known to dive so quickly, they have impaled their swords into the ocean bottom up to their eyes. Although no unprovoked attacks on humans have been reported, swordfish can be very dangerous when harpooned. They have run their swords through the planking of small boats when hurt. In 2015, a Hawaiian fisherman was killed by a swordfish after attempting to spear the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swordfish kills fisherman in Hawaii|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/30/us/hawaii-swordfish-kills-fisherman|publisher=CNN.com|last2=Marco|first2=Tony|last1=Preuss|first1=Andreas|date=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recreational fishing ==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2010}}
Recreational fishing has developed a subspecialty called swordfishing. Because of a ban on long-lining along many parts of seashore, swordfish populations are showing signs of recovery from the [[overfishing]] caused by long-lining along the coast.

Various ways are used to fish for swordfish, but the most common method is deep-drop fishing, since swordfish spend most daylight hours very deep. The boat is allowed to drift to present a more natural bait. Swordfishing requires strong fishing rods and reels, as swordfish can become quite large, and it is not uncommon to use five pounds or more of weight to get the baits deep enough during the day, up to 2,000&amp;nbsp;feet is common. Night fishing baits are usually fished much shallower, often less than {{convert|90|m}}. Standard baits are whole mackerel, herring, mullet, bonito, or squid; one can also use live bait. Imitation squids and other imitation fish lures can also be used, and specialized lures made specifically for swordfishing often have battery-powered or glow lights. Even baits are typically presented using glow sticks or specialized deepwater-proof battery operated lights.

Swordfish are classified as [[oily fish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/news/newsarchive/2004/jun/oilyfishdefinition|title=What's an oily fish?|date=24 June 2004|publisher=[[Food Standards Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many sources, including the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]], warn about potential toxicity from high levels of [[methylmercury]] in swordfish.&lt;ref name="Mercury Levels in Commercial Fish and Shellfish"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA recommends that young children, pregnant women, and women of child-bearing age not eat swordfish. (See [[mercury in fish]] for more details.)

The flesh of some swordfish can acquire an orange tint, reportedly from their diet of shrimp or other prey. Such fish are sold as "pumpkin swordfish", and command a premium over their whitish counterparts.&lt;!-- (Information from U.S. vendor [[Whole Foods Market|Whole Foods]].)--&gt;

Swordfish is a particularly popular fish for cooking. Since swordfish are large animals, meat is usually sold as steaks, which are often [[grilled]]. Swordfish meat is relatively firm, and can be cooked in ways more fragile types of fish cannot (such as over a grill on skewers). The color of the flesh varies by diet, with fish caught on the East Coast of [[North America]] often being rosier.

[[File:Xiphias gladius.jpg|thumb|Swordfish on deck during long-lining operations]]
In 1998, the US [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] and [[SeaWeb]] hired [[Fenton Communications]] to conduct an advertising campaign to promote their assertion that the swordfish population was in danger due to its popularity as a restaurant entree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fenton.com/pages/3_ourwork/4_casestudies/environment/swordfish.htm Swordfish] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231113316/http://www.fenton.com/pages/3_ourwork/4_casestudies/environment/swordfish.htm |date=2007-12-31 }} Fenton Communications&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting "Give Swordfish a Break" promotion was wildly successful, with 750 prominent US chefs agreeing to remove North Atlantic swordfish from their menus, and also persuaded many supermarkets and consumers across the country.

The advertising campaign was repeated by the national media in hundreds of print and broadcast stories, as well as extensive regional coverage. It earned the [[Silver Anvil award]] from the Public Relations Society of America, as well as'' Time'' magazine's award for the top five environmental stories of 1998.

Subsequently, the US [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] proposed a swordfish protection plan that incorporated the campaign's policy suggestions. [[President of the United States of America|Then-US President]] [[Bill Clinton]] called for a ban on the sale and import of swordfish and in a landmark decision by the federal government, {{convert|132670|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} of the Atlantic Ocean were placed off-limits to fishing as recommended by the sponsors.

In the North Atlantic, the swordfish stock is fully rebuilt, with biomass estimates currently 5% above the target level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/fishwatch/species/n_atl_swordfish.htm|title=FishWatch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; No robust stock assessments for swordfish in the northwestern Pacific or South Atlantic have been made, and data concerning stock status in these regions are lacking. These stocks are considered unknown and a moderate conservation concern. The southwestern Pacific stock is a moderate concern due to model uncertainty, increasing catches, and declining [[catch per unit effort]]. Overfishing is likely occurring in the Indian Ocean, and fishing mortality exceeds the maximum recommended level in the Mediterranean, thus these stocks are considered of high conservation concern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbayaq.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/content/media/MBA_SeafoodWatch_SwordfishReport.pdf Seafood Watch – Seafood Report – Swordfish] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714231946/http://www.mbayaq.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/content/media/MBA_SeafoodWatch_SwordfishReport.pdf |date=2007-07-14 }} Monterey Bay Aquarium, 16 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Greenpeace International]] added the swordfish to its seafood red list.&lt;!-- "The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries."--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greenpeace International Seafood Red List|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/oceans/seafood/red-list-of-species/|accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In culture==
The swordfish (''Xiphias'') has been used by astronomers as another name for the constellation of [[Dorado]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17766">'''The Amtrak Wars''' is a series of novels written by British author [[Patrick Tilley]]. The series is a [[post-apocalyptic]] [[science fiction]] with some [[fantasy]] elements such as the existence of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Six novels and an illustrated companion guidebook were published between 1983 and 1990, with additional books planned but never completed. The books have been optioned by an Australian production company with the intent of turning them into a series of feature films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetalismanprophecy.com/ Talisman Prophecy website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Backstory==
In AD 2015, the old world was destroyed in a nuclear war, known in the books variously as 'The Holocaust' and 'The War of a Thousand Suns'. The United States and [[Russia]] were involved in this nuclear war but who fired the first shot is not known. The resulting war lasted only a few hours, but between the nuclear exchange and the years of [[nuclear winter]] that followed, the overwhelming majority of the human race was annihilated.

The most organised band of survivors were the Amtrak Federation. Four hundred American citizens survived the nuclear war in a vast underground bunker beneath [[Houston, Texas]]. They established additional underground bunker-cities (known as divisional bases) linked by a [[subway (rail)|high-speed subterranean rail network]]. Ruled by a self-perpetuating dynasty known as the First Family, the Federation expanded slowly in numbers and territory. By AD 2989, when the novels begin, the Federation sprawls across much of the south of the United States, from [[Colorado]] and [[Arizona]] to [[Mississippi (state)|Mississippi]]. It is technologically advanced, employing [[microlight]] [[aircraft]] and '[[Overland train|wagon-trains]]', massive, 600-foot-long vehicles that act as land-based [[aircraft carriers]] and mobile HQs for heavily armed [[infantry]] personnel. The Federation's personnel are heavily susceptible to above-ground [[radiation]] and rarely live past their fortieth birthdays as a result.

Ordinary citizens of the United States who managed to survive the nuclear war and adapt to the radiation mutated into a clan-based warrior society known as the Mutes. Adopting a warrior ethos and tribal society similar to [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], the Mutes are primitive, employing spears and knives in combat. They are affected by a variety of radiation-induced infirmities, such as somewhat short-term memories and deformities varying in severity by individual. There are exceptions, Mutes with excellent recall who keep the tribe's traditions alive through an oral tradition of story-telling. These Mutes are known as wordsmiths. The Mutes would not present a significant threat to the Federation's vastly superior technology and weapons except for the existence of Mutes known as 'seers', who can foresee their moves, and 'summoners', who can use magical forces that the Federation has no defence against. The Federation leadership does not publicly acknowledge the existence of Mute magic and outlaws all discussion of its existence, to the anger of front-line combat veterans, who have seen it in action.

The third major surviving faction is known as the Iron Masters, though they refer to themselves as the Sons of [[Nissan|Ne-Issan]]. According to their legends, the Iron Masters fled the destruction of their homeland of [[Names of Japan|Nippon]] in vast floating cities that drifted into Antarctic waters and then up into the [[Atlantic]], eventually landing on the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]] of the former United States. They founded a country known as the Shogunate of Ne-Issan, stretching from [[Nova Scotia]] to [[South Carolina]] and inland as far as the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Appalachian Mountains]]. The Iron Masters have developed [[gunpowder]] and great steam-powered ships, but custom, religion and political decree forbids them from developing technology based on the 'Dark Light' ([[electricity]]). Due to the growing threat of the Amtrak Federation, some Iron Masters believe that without embracing the Dark Light, their nation stands little chance against the Federation's superior technology and will be destroyed, but official policy is to maintain the edict.

==Plot summary==
In AD 2989, a 17-year-old, newly qualified Amtrak pilot named Steve Brickman joins the ''Lady from Louisiana'', a wagon-train in its first major assault on the Plainfolk Mutes. Thanks to the Mutes' deployment of sorcery, the wagon-train is defeated and forced to retreat. Brickman is taken prisoner by the Mutes but not killed, due to a prophetic vision of the clan's seer, Mr. Snow, which suggests Steve will be instrumental in the fulfilment of the Talisman Prophecy. This suggests a 'chosen one' called "Talisman" will arise to destroy the Federation and lead the Mutes to victorious domination of the world. Steve comes to admire and respect the Mutes; he falls in love with a "straight" (mutation-free) Mute woman named Clearwater and forges a bond of mutual respect with Mr. Snow's apprentice, Cadillac.

Steve eventually escapes from the Mutes and returns to the Federation, but his account of his imprisonment and escape is deemed fantastical. Labelled a deserter, he is stripped of all rank and is publicly disgraced. Privately, Steve is recruited by the Federation's top-secret intelligence organisation, AMEXICO, and is sent on a new assignment to capture Cadillac, Clearwater, and Mr. Snow, who are deemed of interest to the Federation. Upon learning that Cadillac has used information from Steve to build a primitive glider and fly it to Ne-Issan as part of a weapons and intelligence exchange between the Mutes and Iron Masters, Steve decides to pursue the capture mission into Ne-Issan. During this mission, Steve's loyalties become further conflicted between his affinity with the Mutes and his birth allegiance to the Federation, and he begins a risky attempt to play both sides against the middle whilst he looks for a way to escape his enemies on both sides.

==Main characters==
*'''Steven Roosevelt Brickman''' - A wingman of The Amtrak Federation who is captured by the M'Call clan of Mutes. He gradually begins to regard them as equals, even though this goes against everything he has been taught. He falls in love with a mute, Clearwater, and befriends Mr Snow and Cadillac. However Steve and Cadillac are constantly at odds with each other because of Clearwater, whom Steve stole from Cadillac, and their inherent distrust of each other. Steve possesses latent telepathic abilities that allow him to connect with his kin-sister, Roz, on occasion. At first this is completely unconscious, but over time he is able to contact her deliberately. It is theorised in the books that if he opened himself up he would have access to abilities similar to those displayed by Roz, though he does sometimes instinctively know what people are thinking. He also has a sixth sense for what is immediately about to happen, and is capable of matching the speed and running stamina of Mutes. He is also incredibly lucky, something which may be due to his latent telepathic abilities, his intuitive sixth sense or the fact that he was 'born in the shadow of Talisman' as the Mutes believe.
*'''Roz''' - Steve's kin-sister. She is several years younger, but the two share a deep telepathic bond. Whenever Steve is injured or under a great amount of stress her body becomes similarly affected. If Steve is shot, Roz will receive a similar wound. However this 'psychosomatic wounding' vanishes within hours, leaving no trace that it was ever there. Roz is telepathic and eventually develops the ability to create extremely realistic illusions in the minds of others, indistinguishable from reality. She was studying to be a doctor, but when her telepathic link with Steve is discovered, the First Family involve her in their schemes.
*'''Mr Snow''' - The wordsmith of the Clan M'Call. He is a wise old man and a summoner of the seventh ring of power (there are nine rings of power in total). He is very wise, but also has a sharp sense of humour. He has a great affection for Steve Brickman.
*'''Clearwater''' - A superstraight with bright blue eyes. She is an excellent hand-to-hand fighter and also a summoner of the third ring. Upon seeing her Steve falls deeply in love with her, and she with him. Despite their vast cultural differences they form a relationship.
*'''Cadillac Deville''' - Also a super straight. He is Mr Snow's apprentice and a wordsmith and seer. Though brave, his lust for power and 'standing' often lead him to do stupid or selfish things. While in Ne-Issan, land of the Iron Masters, he develops a love for sake, which only increases his less attractive personality traits and robs him of his ability to see the future in the stones until quite some time after he has stopped consuming alcohol.

==Earth Magic==

There are three types of gifted mutes, two of which possesses magical abilities. They are:

*'''Word-smiths''' - Intelligent mutes with eidetic memories. They remember the oral histories of their entire clan and are also the custodians of the Talisman prophecy. Word-smiths are highly valued, and play a leading role in their clans affairs. Even more so than the clan leader.
*'''Seers''' - Able to see into the future and the past by reading 'special' stones. The events they are able to view are usually connected to the place the stone has been taken from. To a seer, these stones appear to glow when they come across them. When viewing the past or future they enter a trance like state.
*'''Summoners''' - Summoners possess many magical abilities. They are able to control the weather and the earth, producing intense storms, calling down lightning and even generating earthquakes. They are also able to move objects telekinetically and influence the minds of others, either controlling them directly, or implanting hypnotic urges that the subject is compelled to follow. The summoner Clearwater also demonstrated the ability to shield herself from projectile attacks with a wall of light, identify the site and degree of any injuries a person was suffering and communicate with animals.

==Books==
#''Cloud Warrior'' (1983)&lt;br&gt;This book opens with an examination of the character of a Mute named Cadillac, and his world-view. We learn of the Talisman Prophecy, Cadillac's status as a wordsmith and a freak, and his love of Clearwater. The story, however, is about Steven Roosevelt Brickman, an 18-year-old wingman (pilot) in the war against the Plainfolk Mutes. He is shot down, but is spared by the Mutes. He meets Cadillac, Cadillac's mentor Mr. Snow, and Motor-Head, the tribe's paramount warrior. He meets Clearwater, falls in love with her, and woos her away from Cadillac. He sees the gaps in his indoctrinated world-view, but still decides to escape back to the Federation, killing the jealous Motor-Head in the process. The book ends with Mr. Snow telling Cadillac and Clearwater that they will have a role to play in the Talisman Prophecy.
#''First Family'' (1985)&lt;br&gt;This book opens with an examination of the character of a Tracker named Deke Haywood, and his world-view. He is a 'techie' in the Tracker base on the ruins of [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. He then notes that a glider is approaching the base on his monitors; it is Steven Roosevelt Brickman. He is captured, and treated as a suspected traitor, but is not questioned. Through a series of undercover agents, the First Family manoeuvers Steve into a position of weakness and desperation, then sends him back into the field as a member of AMEXICO, the AMtrak EXecutive Intelligence COmmandoes (agents are known as 'Mexicans') with orders to kill Cadillac and Clearwater. He is promptly attacked by a group of deserters, who steal all of his equipment and throw him out. He then finds his way back to Mr. Snow, whose tribe takes him in. After hearing that Cadillac and Clearwater have gone north to the land of the mysterious 'Iron Masters', Steve stows away on an Iron Master vessel.
#''Iron Master'' (1987)&lt;br&gt;This book opens with an examination of the character of an Iron Master named Toshiro Hase-Gawa and his world-view. He is a Herald of the Inner Court, a secret agent of his Shogun. Steve discovers that Cadillac copied Steve's technical knowledge using wordsmith magic, and is making recon gliders for the Iron Masters, masquerading as Steve (since Mutes are supposed to be illiterate). The arrival of Steve, Cadillac and Clearwater throws the internal political groups into some turmoil, and Steve receives some offers. Steve agrees to help Cadillac with the gliders, in exchange for Toshiro's help in getting them all out of the country at the end. Toshiro then gets Steve to kill one of the seventeen ''daiyamo'' (domain-lords). They then escape to a secret First Family recon station with two other federation runaways, where they steal transportation and fly back to Wyoming. But this is according to the Family's plan, and one of the runaways is a spy.
#''Blood River'' (1988)&lt;br&gt;Steve, Cadillac and Clearwater meet with triumph and disaster as they try to evade the clutches of both the Iron Masters and the disguised hunter/killer squads sent out by the Federation to purge the overground of renegade Trackers and deserters. Clearwater is seriously injured and only Federation medicine can save her; Steve uses his identity as a Federation agent to get her treatment.
#''Death-Bringer'' (1989)&lt;br&gt;With Clearwater now safely in their hands the First Family hatches a plan to use her as bait to capture Cadillac and Mr Snow and annihilate the Clan M'Call; a plan in which Steve is forced to continue his double-role as loyal agent of the Federation and blood-brother to the Plainfolk. In an apocalyptic battle, Mr. Snow and the Clan M'Call are destroyed, save Cadillac. Steve returns to the Federation to take care of Clearwater, while Roz escapes the Federation and joins with Cadillac.
#''Earth-Thunder'' (1990)&lt;br&gt;The "Great Mountain in the West speaks to the Sky with a Tongue of Flame", signifying the Talisman Prophecy is on the verge of fulfillment. At that moment Clearwater goes in to labour with Steve's child in a Federation hospital, and Roz conceives a child with Cadillac on the overground. The First Family celebrates their believed capture of the Talisman, but which child is the real one, or are both part of the prophecy?

==Other Material==
There is also a rare guide to the Amtrak Wars world titled ''[[Dark Visions: an illustrated guide to the Amtrak Wars]]'', {{ISBN|0-7474-0270-1}} ([[Sphere Books]], 1988).

==Revised edition==
In 1998 [[Orbit Books]] reissued the ''Amtrak Wars'' series with new covers and in a revised form that saw the Amtrak Federation renamed as the 'Lone Star Confederation'. The final volume was also mildly re-edited to remove the definitive afterword/conclusion of the original series, leaving the book on more of a cliffhanger.

==Continuation==
''The Amtrak Wars'' is notable for having a cliffhanger ending to the final volume, in which two of the main characters are killed, one of the three main civilisations is plunged into civil war and two children are born with pre-ordained destinies. However, since 1990 there have been no further additions to the series.

In a letter dated 26 August 1991 Patrick Tilley confirmed that both the fans and publishers wanted additional novels to be published in the series and he was pursuing the matter, but only if he could "make it good enough.".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.johnbreslin.com/blog/1998/10/08/review-the-amtrak-wars/&lt;/ref&gt; Rumours circulated for several years that additional novels in the sequence were being written, reaching a height in 1999 when a seventh volume was listed for publication by several websites. Unsubstantiated rumours surfaced in 2001 that Book 7 would be called ''Ghost Rider'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sffworld.com/forums/showthread.php?t=430&amp;highlight=Tilley&lt;/ref&gt; and that one of the characters killed at the end of book 6 wasn't actually dead.

In 2007 Patrick Tilley once again hinted that the series would continue, although possibly only as a trilogy rather than six more books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnbreslin.com/blog/2007/06/19/latest-news-from-patrick-tilley-author-of-the-amtrak-wars/ Patrick Tilley news]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film adaptation==
In 2007 the books were optioned by an Australian production company with the intention of turning them into a series of feature films. In 2008-09 Patrick Tilley wrote a draft of the first script, entitled like the book, ''Cloud Warrior'', and the production company continued pursuing the project in 2010, showing the script and tentative production artwork to several companies at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. The proposed movie series is entitled ''The Talisman Prophecy'' rather than ''The Amtrak Wars'' and continues the practice from the revised edition of naming the Amtrak Federation as 'The Lone Star Confederation'. Other changes include proposed variations to the design of Federation vehicles and technology from the books, and the removal of Ne-Issan to the [[Pacific North-West]] rather than the Eastern Seaboard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetalismanprophecy.com/ Talisman Prophecy Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Great Muppet Caper''''' is a 1981 [[Mystery film|mystery]] [[Musical film|musical]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Jim Henson]], marking his feature directorial debut. The film is about [[the Muppets]] who must travel to London to stop a jewel heist. It is the second of a series of live-action [[Musical film|musical]] feature films, starring Jim Henson's [[The Muppets|Muppets]]. The film was a British-American venture produced by [[The Jim Henson Company|Henson Associates]] and [[ITC Entertainment]], and originally released by [[Universal Pictures]]{{ref|1|1}} on 26 June 1981. It is also the only Muppet feature film directed by Henson. Shot in [[Great Britain]] and [[London]] in 1980, the film was released shortly after the final season of ''[[The Muppet Show]]''.

==Plot==
[[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]], [[Fozzie Bear|Fozzie]], and [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]] are investigative reporters for the ''Daily Chronicle'' newspaper. Kermit and Fozzie, specifically, play identical twin reporters, which becomes the source of a [[running gag]]—supposedly, nobody can tell they are twins when Fozzie removes his hat. One day, after the trio fail to report on a major jewel robbery, they ask their editor to allow them to travel to London to investigate the robbery and interview the victim, prominent [[Fashion design|fashion designer]] Lady Holiday. [[Statler and Waldorf]] make appearances throughout the film to heckle them and the audience.

With only $12 for the trip, they're forced to travel in an aeroplane's baggage hold and are thrown out of the plane as it passes over Britain. They stay at the [[Dilapidation|dilapidated]] (but free) Happiness Hotel, which is populated by other Muppet characters such as [[Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem]], [[Scooter (Muppet)|Scooter]], the [[Swedish Chef]], [[Bunsen Honeydew|Dr. Bunsen Honeydew]], [[Beaker (Muppet)|Beaker]], [[List of Muppets#Lew Zealand|Lew Zealand]], [[Rowlf the Dog]], [[Sam Eagle|Sam the Eagle]], [[List of Muppets#Pops|Pops]], [[List of Muppets#Beauregard|Beauregard]], [[List of Muppets#Crazy Harry|Crazy Harry]], [[List of Muppets#Camilla the Chicken|Camilla the Chicken]], and newcomer [[Rizzo the Rat]]. The next morning, when Kermit seeks out Lady Holiday in her office, however, he instead finds her newly-hired receptionist, the alluring [[Miss Piggy]], and mistakes her for the fashion designer. Piggy poses as Lady Holiday, and asks Kermit out for dinner; to keep up the pose, she allows Kermit to assume she lives at a "highbrow" address. She sneaks into a townhouse at 17 Highbrow Street to wait for him, much to the surprise of the actual upper-class British residents, and they go to dinner at a nightclub.

At the nightclub, the real Lady Holiday's necklace is stolen by her jealous brother Nicky and his accomplices Carla, Marla, and Darla, three of her put-upon fashion models (the very same thieves who robbed her before). After the robbery, Miss Piggy's charade is revealed and she flees, leaving Kermit behind, though they later reconcile in a park. Despite Nicky's instant attraction to Miss Piggy, he and his accomplices frame her for the necklace theft and plan to steal an even more valuable prize: Lady Holiday's largest and most valuable jewel, the Fabulous Baseball Diamond, now on display at the local Mallory Gallery. Gonzo overhears their plot. He, Kermit, Fozzie, and the other residents of the Happiness Hotel decide to intercept the thieves and catch them red-handed to exonerate Miss Piggy.

The Muppets sneak into the Mallory Gallery, and get to the Baseball Diamond at the same time as the thieves. They try to keep the diamond out of the thieves' hands via a game of [[keep away]], which turns into baseball, but Nicky eventually catches the diamond and takes Kermit hostage. However, in the meantime, Piggy escapes from prison, and she races to the Mallory Gallery, crashing through the window on a motorcycle that serendipitously fell off a truck in front of her. She knocks Nicky out and dispatches Carla, Marla and Darla with a flurry of furious karate chops. As the police arrive, all charges against Piggy are dropped, Nicky and his accomplices are arrested, and the Muppets get their deserved credit for foiling the heist.

The Muppets then return to the United States the same way they departed, being thrown out of the cargo hold and parachuting back to the United States, over the end credits.

==Release==

===Box office===
The film made $20 million in the US and was considered a box office disappointment. Some thought the use of the word "caper" in the title was a mistake.&lt;ref name="summer"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harmetz|first1=Aljean|authorlink1=Aljean Harmetz|title=HOLLYWOOD IS JOYOUS OVER ITS RECORD GROSSING SUMMER|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/09/movies/hollywood-is-joyous-over-its-record-grossing-summer.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=10 October 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=9 September 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Great Muppet Caper'' has received generally positive reviews. The film holds a 79% approval rating based on 20 reviews on aggregate review site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with an average score of 6.5/10. The site's consensus says "''The Great Muppet Caper'' is overplotted and uneven, but the appealing presence of Kermit, [[Miss Piggy]] and the gang ensure that this heist flick is always breezily watchable."&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/great_muppet_caper/|title=The Great Muppet Caper (1981)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film a two star rating (out of four) and concluded his review by saying that "the lack of a cutting edge hurts this movie. It's too nice, too routine, too predictable, and too safe."&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Roger Ebert]]|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19810101/REVIEWS/101010334|title=The Great Muppet Caper|work=Chicago Sun-Times|publisher=rogerebert.com|date=1 January 1981|accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Discworld Unseen University.jpg|right]]
'''''The Unseen University Challenge''''' is a book of [[trivia]] questions related to [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' novels. It was written by [[David Langford]] (with [[Terry Pratchett]]'s permission) and was published in 1996. Its name is a reference to the television quiz ''[[University Challenge]]''. [[Unseen University]] is the Wizard's university in [[Ankh-Morpork]].

The quiz consists of 841 questions in several categories, named after various faculties of the University, such as Thaumatology, Arcane History, Dwarf Studies, and Oook. Each section contains a bonus question, and several ways exist to score more points for a question, many of them ludicrous.

David Langford has intentionally not based his questions on the Annotated Pratchett File, a long list of ''Discworld'' trivia available on the internet. Nevertheless, several items are in both the APF and the quizbook.

==Sequel==
'''''The Wyrdest Link''''' is the [[sequel]], featuring what might be [[Josh Kirby]]'s last cover illustration for a ''Discworld''-related book. The title is a reference to the 6th book of the series, ''[[Wyrd Sisters]]'', and to the TV show ''[[The Weakest Link]]''.

This book divides the questions into guilds. For example, if it is a question about a joke it may be categorised as in the Fools' Guild.

"'''War'''" is a song recorded and made popular by [[Bob Marley]]. It first appeared on Bob Marley and the Wailers' 1976 Island Records album, ''[[Rastaman Vibration]]'', Marley's only top 10 album in the USA. (In UK it reached position 15  May 15, 1976.) The lyrics are almost entirely derived from a speech made by [[Ethiopia]]n Emperor [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie I]] before the United Nations General Assembly on 4 October 1963.

==Songwriting Controversy==
"War" is credited to Allen "Skill" Cole (idea) and Carlton Barrett (music); the music was an extension of the one-drop drumming style, which Carlton Barrett had developed and refined, if not invented. The lyrics are a near-exact repetition of a speech in the UN by the Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie. However, the two simple guitar chords and the semi-improvised, spirited melody put to Selassie's words is unmistakably Marley's.

According to [[Stephen Davis (music journalist)|Stephen Davis]]' biography "Bob Marley," it also appears that Marley had credited several of his multi-million selling 1974-1976 songs to close friends and relatives because he was under an unfavorable publishing contract, signed in April 1968 with Cayman Publishing, that would have otherwise deprived him of much of his songwriting royalties. Crediting close friends, such as football player [[Allan Cole (footballer)|Allen "Skill" Cole]] or  Wailers drummer [[Carlton Barrett|Carlton "Carly" Barrett]] therefore enabled Bob Marley to circumvent the law until new, more favorable agreements were made. This practice, along with the practice of rewarding friends who contributed to compositions by crediting them — even if they only contributed with ideas — and Marley's sudden death without leaving a will all combined to create confusion about the copyright status of several songs, including "War".

Barrett's brother, Wailer musician [[Aston "Family Man" Barrett]] (who created the bass line, key to the song's efficiency) has since brought lawsuits against the Marley estate (in practice, the widow Rita Marley) for unpaid royalties and credit for songs such as "War" that were claimed to have been either written by others and not by Bob Marley, or in collaboration with Marley.&lt;ref name="Miller page 97"&gt;Miller, Mark and Blum, Bruno, ''Sur la route avec Bob Marley'', page 97. Scali, France, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; One such suit reached a settlement in 1994 in which Barrett was paid $500,000.&lt;ref name=AP2006&gt;{{cite news|title=Bandmate of Marley loses suit|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/16/entertainment/et-quick16.4|accessdate=10 August 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|agency=Associated Press|date=May 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barrett later continued to pursue legal action, seeking £60 million ($113.6 million at the time) in a suit against the Island-Universal record label and the Marley family, but the case was dismissed on the grounds that the earlier settlement proscribed any further claim on the estate&lt;ref name="Miller page 97"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP2006 /&gt;

Bob Marley was a talented song writer, but during the ska-, rocksteady- and the primitive reggae era, only Peter Tosh could play the guitar in The [[Wailers]]. Carlton Barrett was considered the most promising young reggae drummer in Jamaica when he belonged to [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]]'s studio band [[The Upsetters]], and when Marley, [[Peter Tosh]] and [[Bunny Wailer]] broke with Perry in 1972, they took the Barrett brothers with them. The Barrett Brothers have a very large part in the development of Bob Marley's special sound, that does not sound like other reggae music. When Tosh and Wailer left 1973, it was Aston Barrett's idea to rearrange the band's music room, to create a rehearsal room, and set it up like a little demo studio to tape the new concept of lyrics, melodies, and music. Bob Marley and the Wailers started to prepare themselves much better musically before they were ready to go into the studio. The first work was the album called ''[[Natty Dread]]'' 1974 (where "No Woman No Cry" and "Rebel Music" can be found, and the second album was ''[[Rastaman Vibration]]'' with the songs "War" and "Want More" (Aston Barrett).&lt;ref&gt;Obrecht, Jas (2011) [http://jasobrecht.com/aston-family-man-barrett-interview-bob-marley-peter-tosh-wailers/ "Aston "Family Man" Barrett: A New Interview About Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, and The Wailers"] i ''Jas Obrecht Muic Archive'', 14 feb 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; After Marley's death, it was not easy to determine who did what in creating music. The songs grew naturally through rehearsals, etc., but when it came to Bob Marley and the Wailers, the band members were convinced that they were led by a prophet who inspired them all. Bob Marley was extremely charismatic, and after his death in 1981 many of the band members had difficulties making a living, sometimes due to depression and personal crises. The royalty battles are really deeply tragic, but the situation has improved in many ways since Marley's sons David (Ziggy) and Stephen took over the heritage, the copyrights and the responsibility.

==Background==
{{Wikisource|Selassie's Address to the United Nations}}
As taught by the Original Gong, Leonard P Howell, Marley, along with fellow [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]], worship [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia]] as the incarnation of God, and refer to him as "Ras Tafari," "Jah" or "The Lion of Judah" which Marley does in many of his songs. To him, Selassie was not only one of the most prominent African leaders of his time, he was also identified as God returning to earth as "King of Kings, Lord of Lords" (Revelation 19, 16), imperial titles born both by Selassie I and Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II before him. It was Menelik II, however, who created this self-styled imperial title in the late 19th Century after he succeeded in uniting his country, later known as [[Ethiopia]]. Marley did however accept Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity 8 months before his passing.
Haile Selassie I gave the "War" speech on October 4, 1963, calling for world peace at the 1963 [[United Nations|U.N.]] Conference in [[New York City]]. This historical speech was spoken a few weeks after the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU) was founded in Ethiopian capital city Addis Ababa where Selassie chaired a summit meeting gathering almost every African head of state (The King of Morocco had declined the invitation).

This U.N. speech resounded even louder as  [[Haile Selassie I]] had made a name for himself on the international scene in 1936, when he spoke at The [[League of Nations]] in Geneva. It was there that Selassie warned the world that if member state Ethiopia was not militarily supported by other member states to fight the fascist Italian invasion of his country then taking place, as the League of Nations statute guaranteed, the League  would then cease to exist as a matter of fact and the rest of the member states were to suffer the same fate as his country. Three years later [[World War II]] broke out. This visionary speech granted Selassie much respect around the world, eventually leading to British military support, which helped freeing his country in 1941. Addressing the world again in 1963, Selassie's words bore full weight. In picking this utterance for lyrics, Bob Marley thus projected two dimensions of the Ethiopian Emperor: the head of state as well as the Living God Rastafarian see with him.

==Lyrics==
Although credited to Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]], whose Christian name is Tafari Makonen, the real author of the text remains uncertain. It is sometimes believed that it was written by Lorenzo Tazaz, a close contributor who wrote many of the Ethiopian leader's most important speeches, including a historic one given in 1935 to the [[League of Nations]]. But Tazaz died in 1947, over fifteen years before the 1963 U.N. utterance. Spoken in Ethiopia's official Amharic language at the [[U.N.]], the 1963 speech was published in English in ''Important Utterances of H.I.M. Emperor Haile Selassie I 1963-1972''.&lt;ref&gt;''Important Utterances of H.I.M. Emperor Haile Selassie I 1963-1972'', The Imperial Ethiopian Ministry of Information, Addis Ababa, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; The book gave permission to freely use its contents: "Any portion of this book could be reproduced by any process without permission." The song uses part of Selassie's speech that calls for equality among all without regard to race, class, or nationality in his hymnal cry for peace. It also asserts, quoting Selassie directly, that until the day of an equal society, there will be war. In the original speech, Selassie urged [[U.N.]] officials and country representatives to disarm [[nuclear weapons]], and to end international exploitation (specifically with Africa). The song honors Haile Selassie I while calling for action against racial inequality and international injustice. The part of the speech used by Bob Marley was preceded by the following words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Last May, in Addis Ababa, I convened a meeting of Heads of African States and Governments. In three days, the thirty-two nations represented at that Conference demonstrated to the world that when the will and the determination exist, nations and peoples of diverse backgrounds can and will work together. In unity, to the achievement of common goals and the assurance of that equality and brotherhood which we desire. On the question of racial discrimination, the [[Addis Ababa]] Conference taught, to those who will learn, this further lesson:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here is the part of Haile Selassie's speech put to music by Marley in his original song "War" (Bob Marley slightly modified the original words, changing each "that until" to "until" and added the word "war" several times):

&lt;blockquote&gt;That until the philosophy which holds one race superior and another inferior is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned; That until there are no longer first-class and second-class citizens of any nation; That until the color of a man's skin is of no more significance than the color of his eyes; That until the basic human rights are equally guaranteed to all without regard to race; That until that day, the dream of lasting peace and world citizenship and the rule of international morality will remain but a fleeting illusion, to be pursued but never attained; And until the ignoble and unhappy regimes that hold our brothers in [[Angola]], in [[Mozambique]] and in [[South Africa]] in subhuman bondage have been toppled and destroyed; Until bigotry and prejudice and malicious and inhuman self-interest have been replaced by understanding and tolerance and good-will; Until all Africans stand and speak as free beings, equal in the eyes of all men, as they are in the eyes of Heaven; Until that day, the African continent will not know peace. We Africans will fight, if necessary, and we know that we shall win, as we are confident in the victory of good over evil.'' &amp;ndash; Haile Selassie I&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here are the lyrics from the Bob Marley and the Wailers at the album Rastaman Vibration:

{{quote|Until the philosophy which hold one race superior / And another / Inferior / Is finally / And permanently / Discredited / And abandoned / -Everywhere is war - / Me say war.

That until there no longer / First class and second class citizens of any nation / Until the colour of a man's skin / Is of no more significance / than the colour of his eyes / - Me say war.

That until the basic human rights / Are equally guaranteed to all, / Without regard to race / - Dis a war.

That until that day / The dream of lasting peace, / World citizenship / Rule of international morality / Will remain in but a fleeting illusion to be pursued, / But never attained / - Now everywhere is war - / War.

And until the ignoble and unhappy regimes / that hold our brothers in Angola, / In Mozambique, / South Africa / Sub-human bondage / Have been toppled, / Utterly destroyed / - Well, everywhere is war - / Me say war.

'War in the east, / War in the west, / War up north, / War down south - / War - war - / Rumours of war. / And until that day, / The African continent / Will not know peace, / We Africans will fight - we find it necessary / - And we know we shall win / As we are confident / In the victory

Of good over evil -/ Good over evil, yeah! / Good over evil - / Good over evil, yeah! / Good over evil - / Good over evil, yeah!}}

A different mix, which includes a different horn arrangement, released as a bonus track in the Deluxe Edition (2002) of the [[Rastaman Vibration]] album, revealed that Marley had recorded an extra verse also adapted from the original speech:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Until bigotry and prejudice, malicious and inhuman self-interest have been replaced by understanding and tolerance and good will, yeah, war. Until all Africans stand and speak as free beings equal in the eyes of the almighty, war. Everywhere is war.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his speech to the U.N., Selassie reminded his listeners that "these are only words; their value depends wholly on our will to observe and honor them and give them content and meaning."

==The Song==
{{Listen|pos = right

 |title        = "War"
 |description  = War audio sample
}}
The original version of "War" was recorded at Harry J's studio in Kingston, Jamaica, by engineer Sylvan Morris. It includes [[Aston "Family Man" Barrett]] on Fender Jazz bass, his brother Carlton 'Carly' Barrett on drums, Earl "Chinna" Smith on guitar, Alvin "Seeco" Patterson on percussion and Tyrone Downie on keyboards. Marcia Griffiths, Judy Mowatt and Rita Marley sing harmony vocals as the I Three. It was produced by Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers and mixed at Miami's Criteria studio by Aston "Family Man" Barrett and Chris Blackwell with engineer Alex Sadkin.

With such potent and meaningful lyrics, the song soon became one of [[Bob Marley]]'s greatest classics, carrying the Rastafari message to the world in [[Haile Selassie I]]'s own words. As from 1977, when Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers embarked for their first major world tour in June, "War" was sung at most concerts until Marley's last show on September 23, 1980 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Two live recordings of the song have since been released officially by Tuff Gong/Island Records. The first one was issued on the 1978 "[[Babylon by Bus]]" album recorded live at the Pavillon de Paris in Paris, France on June 26, 1978. The second was recorded at the Rainbow Theatre in London, England on June 4, 1977, and was issued on the 2001 Deluxe Edition of the [[Exodus (Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers album)|Exodus]] album. Predating these two is another version, recorded on May 26, 1976 and released in 2003 on [[Live at the Roxy (Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers album)|Live at the Roxy]].

==Haile Selassie version==
Two other hit versions of the song featuring [[Bob Marley]] &amp; the Wailers can also be heard. A vinyl single released in Jamaica on [[Bruno Blum]]'s Human Race label in December 1997 includes samples of [[Bob Marley]]'s voice saying "Rastafari is the prince of Peace." But most importantly, the song features the original recording&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A sample of the hit version of ''War'' featuring Haile Selassie I's voice|url=http://www.docreggae.com/musique/mp3/haileselassiei_war.mp3|format=MP3|website=Docreggae.com|accessdate=2017-07-20}}
&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Haile Selassie I]]'s Amharic speech done in 1963, overdubbed on a new rhythm track played by Wailers original members. The B-side offers a welcome English translation of the speech by [[Bruno Blum]], whose spoken rendition of ''War''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=English rendition of "War" by Bruno Blum|url=http://www.docreggae.com/musique/mp3/brunoblum_war.mp3|format=MP3|website=Docreggae.com|accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes the second part of the speech not used by [[Bob Marley]]:

{{quote|1=The basis of racial discrimination and colonialism has been economic, and it is with economic weapons that these evils have been and can be overcome. In pursuance of resolutions adopted at the Addis Ababa summit conference, African states have undertaken certain measures in the economic field which, if adopted by all member states of the United Nations, would soon reduce intransigeance to reason. I ask, today, for adherence to these measures by every nation represented ''[here]'' which is truly devoted to the principles enunciated in the charter.

We must act while we can, while the occasion exists to exert those legitimate pressures available to us lest time run out and resort be had to less happy means.

The great nations of the world would do well to remember that in the modern age even their own fates are not wholly in their hands. Peace demands the united efforts of us all. Who can foresee what spark might ignite the fuse?

The stake of each one of us is identical-life or death. We all wish to live. We all seek a world in which men are freed of the burdens of ignorance, poverty, hunger and disease. And we shall all be hard-pressed to escape the deadly rain of nuclear fall-out should catastrophe overtake us.

The problems which confront us today are, equally, unprecedented. They have no counterparts in human experience. Men search the pages of history for solutions, for precedents, but there are none. This then, is the ultimate challenge. Where are we to look for our survival, for the answers to the questions which have never before been posed ? We must look, first, to the Almighty God, Who has raised man above the animals and endowed him with intelligence and reason. We must put our faith in Him, that He will not desert us or permit us to destroy humanity which He created in His image.

And we must look into ourselves, into the depth of our souls. We must become something  we have never been and for which our education and experience and environment have ill-prepared us. We must become bigger than we have been : more courageous, greater in spirit, larger in outlook. We must become members of a new race, overcoming petty prejudice, owing our ultimate allegiance not to nations but to our fellow men within the human community.}}

A second mix of this new recording was also released, charting at the #1 spot in the U.K. Echoes magazine in April 1998. This time it featured samples of [[Bob Marley]] &amp; the Wailers' song ''Selassie Is the Chapel'' (adapted from ''[[Crying in the Chapel]]''), where Bob and Rita Marley's voices can be heard on a sizeable part of the record, as well as Selassie's original "foundation lead vocal," creating a virtual duet between [[Haile Selassie I]] and his apostle Bob Marley. Both new versions were recorded at Kingston Musick Studio in Kingston, Jamaica, engineered by Rudy Thomas. They include Wailers survivors [[Aston "Family Man" Barrett]] on bass guitar and piano, Mikey "Boo" Richards" on drums and Earl "Wire" Lindo on keyboards, along with guitar and backing vocals by Bruno Blum. Percussionist Norbert "Nono" Nobour and backing singer Tatiana Prus were later added. The sessions were produced by Bruno Blum and mixed by Thierry Bertomeu at AB Studio in St. Denis, France.

Released in Europe on Blum's Rastafari label in early 1998, both "War" and "War/Selassie Is the Chapel" were successful singles contributing to the "new roots" reggae scene where Rastafari themes sung by the likes of [[Garnett Silk]], [[Luciano]] and [[Dennis Brown]] were popular again after more than a decade of decline. Several singles derived from this new recording were subsequently issued on the label, including Buffalo Bill's ''War''/''Warmongers'', [[Big Youth]]'s ''We No Want No War'' and Joseph Cotton's ''Conflicts'' backed by Doc Reggae's spoken French version ''Guerre''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=French rendition of ''Guerre'' by Bruno Blum|url=http://www.docreggae.com/musique/mp3/brunoblum_guerre.mp3|format=MP3|website=Docreggae.com|accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full length CD album entitled ''The War Album'', including all versions, was issued in Europe on the Rastafari label in 2001. A vinyl album was released in Jamaica on the Human Race label in 2004, and the full ''War Album'' was reissued in 2010 as part of the Human Race label double CD anthology.

Originally published in 1984, the book consistently tops [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] in the paperback advice category,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inside the List |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/27/books/review/27tbr.html?ex=1184558400&amp;en=fcf63c4e393d1ed2&amp;ei=5070 |work=[[The New York Times]] |last=Donadio |first=Rachel |date=2006-08-27 |accessdate=2007-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of ''[[USA Today]]''{{-'}}s "25 Most Influential Books" of the past 25 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/top25-books.htm |title=USA Today's 25 Books that leave a legacy |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=2009-11-22 |date=2007-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been described as "the bible of American pregnancy".&lt;ref name="Trouble"&gt;{{cite news |title=Expecting Trouble: The Book They Love to Hate |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/15/fashion/thursdaystyles/15EXPECT.html |last=Kantor |first=Jodi |date=2005-09-17 |accessdate=2007-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2008}}, over 14.5 million copies were in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/What-Expect-When-Youre-Expecting/dp/0761148574 |title=Amazon.com Review |accessdate=2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''USA Today'', 93 percent of all expectant mothers who read a pregnancy guide read ''What to Expect When You're Expecting''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whattoexpect.com/home/about-the-author.aspx |title=What to Expect Website |accessdate=2009-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, ''What to Expect When You're Expecting'' was adapted into a film released by [[Lionsgate]].&lt;ref name="ExpectFilm" /&gt;

==Format==
The book presents advice in a question-and-answer format. It proceeds chronologically from the time a woman first begins to suspect pregnancy, through each of the nine months (with one chapter devoted to each), and into the [[postpartum period]]. The beginning of each chapter succinctly lists common physical and emotional changes and [[symptom]]s a woman may be experiencing, and gives information on what a woman can expect when visiting her [[obstetrics|doctor]] or [[nurse midwife]] during checkups. Also included early in each chapter is a section entitled "A Look Inside" which displays pictures of the changing female [[anatomy]] and the growing [[embryo]]  then [[fetus]]. Additional information in sections titled "What You May Be Concerned About" and "What It's Important to Know" is designed to address a wide range of concerns, problems and life trends.

Each edition includes substantial nutrition information discussing caloric intake, maintaining balanced meals and provides sample recipes. Recent editions include a complete nutrition plan.

The book's appendix lists additional sources of information and resources including government organizations, associations and foundations.

==Origin of the book==
Author Heidi Murkoff cites her own quest for reassuring information during her first pregnancy as being the motivation for developing ''What to Expect When You're Expecting''. Murkoff collaborated with her mother [[Arlene Eisenberg]], a freelance journalist and her sister Sandee Hathway, a nurse when developing the pregnancy guide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whattoexpect.com/home/about-the-author.aspx "About the Author Heidi Murkoff"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/05/garden/home-with-arlene-eisenberg-heidi-e-murkoff-sandee-e-hathaway-baby-makers.html |title=The New York Times At Home With Arlene Eisenberg, Heidi E. Murkoff and Sandee E. Hathaway |accessdate=2009-11-25 |first=Janny |last=Scott |date=1995-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
''What to Expect When You're Expecting'' has been criticized for promoting paranoia and fear among pregnant women for focusing on complications and for its extremely strict dietary guidelines. [[Heidi Murkoff|Murkoff]] also has no medical training and has been further criticized for stating she asks [[obstetricians]] to comment on manuscripts only late in the writing and editing processes.&lt;ref name="Trouble" /&gt; With the first publishing of the book being in 1984, one reason it is considered problematic is due to the many old and unrevised printings in public circulation. Although wording is revised with each new edition to respond to critiques, older copies are passed down by women to their pregnant peers.&lt;ref name="Trouble" /&gt;

==Additional education efforts==

The Foundation reports that millions of impoverished women do not have access to free comprehensive pregnancy guides which led to the development of "Baby Basics" a book and education program delivering prenatal health literacy.&lt;ref name="Foundation" /&gt;

'''Xingtian''' ({{CJKV|t=刑天|s=刑天|p=Xíngtiān|l=Opposing Heaven}}) is a Chinese deity&lt;ref name="y217"/&gt; who fights against the [[Primordial Divinity (Tai Di)|Supreme Divinity]], not giving up even after the event of his decapitation. Losing the fight for supremacy, he was beheaded and his head buried in Changyang Mountain. Nevertheless, headless, with a shield in one hand and a battle axe in the other, he continues the fight, using his nipples as eyes and his bellybutton as a mouth.&lt;ref name="y217"&gt;Yang, 217&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

Xingtian was an official under [[Yan Emperor|Yandi]].&lt;ref name=str171/&gt; Yandi fought against [[Yellow Emperor|Huangdi]] for the position of supreme god, but he lost the conflict.&lt;ref name=str171/&gt; Xingtian still continued the fight after Yandi's defeat, but was defeated and decapitated by Huangdi.&lt;ref name=str171/&gt; Eventually, he regenerated himself and continued his defiance, which was expressed by a martial dance.&lt;ref name=str171&gt;Strassberg, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
[[File:Jiang Yinghao - Xingtian.jpg|thumb|Xingtian as drawn by Jiang Yinghao, 17th century]]
Xingtian appears in chapter 7 of the ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' (''Classic of Mountains and Seas''), which states that he fought and lost against the supreme god to become the supreme divinity.&lt;ref name="y217"/&gt; The god decapitated Xingtian and buried his head on Changyang Mountain.&lt;ref name="y217"/&gt; However, Xingtian persevered, using his nipples as his eyes, using his navel as his mouth, and brandishing his shield and ax.&lt;ref name="y217"/&gt; The ''Shanhaijing'' states the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Xingtian and the Supreme God Di came to this place and struggled against each other for ultimate power. The Supreme God cut off Xingtian's head
and buried him at Eternally Auspicious Mountain. Xiangtian's nipples then transformed into eyes, and his navel became a mouth. He performs a dance with an ax and shield."&lt;ref name=str171/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the Luo Mi's ''[[Lushi (book)|Lushi]]'' (from the [[Southern Song]] period), Xingtian{{refn|group=lower-alpha|This Xingtian is written with a different character for ''Xing'', but many scholars argue that it represent the same figure.&lt;ref name="y218"&gt;Yang, 218&lt;/ref&gt;}} is described as a minister of [[Yan Emperor|Yandi]], who composed music for farmers for plowing and harvesting.&lt;ref name="y218"/&gt;

In the ''[[Huainanzi]]'', Xingtian is called the corpse of Xingcan (形殘之尸).&lt;ref&gt;Strassberg, 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholar [[Guo Pu]] celebrated Xingtian's defiant spirit in an encomium.&lt;ref name=str171/&gt; He mentions the similarity between Xingtian and the corpse of Geng of the Xia, since they were both characters who regenerated and continued their resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Strassberg, 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet [[Tao Yuanming|Tao Qian]] also celebrated Xingtian's spirit in his ''Thirteen Poems upon Reading the Guideways through Mountains and Seas'', where he made an association between [[Jingwei]] and Xingtian in their persistence to overcome tragedies but also mentions their inability to be free from it:&lt;ref name=str18,171&gt;Strassberg, 18 &amp; 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Jingwei]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; bites hold of twigs, determined to fill up the deep-blue sea. Xingtian dances wildly with spear and shield, his old ambitions still burn fiercely.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Also translated as: "Xingtian brandished his shield and battle-ax, his fierce spirit will live forever."&lt;ref name="y218"/&gt;}} After blending with things, no anxieties should remain. After metamorphosing, all one's regrets should flee. In vain do they cling to their hearts from the past. How can they, a better day, foresee?"&lt;ref name=str18,171/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Symbolism==
Xingtian symbolizes the indomitable spirit which maintains the will to resist no matter what tribulations one may undergo or what troubles one may encounter.&lt;ref name=yang127-8&gt;Yang, 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Xingtian has been lauded in poetry and prose.&lt;ref name=yang127-8/&gt;
