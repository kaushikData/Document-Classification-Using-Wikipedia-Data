      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4332">The '''Albany Medical Center Prize in Medicine and Biomedical Research''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amc.edu/Academic/AlbanyPrize/ Albany Medical Center Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[United States]]' second highest value prize in [[medicine]] and [[biomedical research]], awarded by the [[Albany Medical Center]]. Among prizes for medicine worldwide, the Albany Medical Center Prize is the fourth most lucrative (after the $3 million [[Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences]], the $1.2 million [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine]] and the $1 million [[Shaw Prize|Shaw Prize in life science and medicine]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shawprize.org/en/shaw.php?tmp=2&amp;twoid=76 Shaw Prize in Life Science and Medicine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Awarded annually, the $500,000 prize is bestowed to any physician or scientist, or group, whose work has led to significant advances in the fields of health care and scientific research with demonstrated translational benefits applied to improved patient care.

The prize is a legacy to its founder, the late [[Morris Silverman (philanthropist)|Morris "Marty" Silverman]]. At the inaugural awards ceremony in Albany, NY in March 2001, Silverman started a tradition that will be carried on for one hundred years, the duration of the Prize. Silverman's promise was to light one candle each year to honor that year's recipient.

The '''Aro people''' or '''Aros''' are an [[Igbo people|Igbo]] subgroup&lt;ref name="Staurt96"&gt;{{cite book|first=James Stuart |last=Olson |title=The Peoples of Africa: An Ethnohistorical Dictionary |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |page=234 |year=1996 |isbn=0313279187 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MdaAdBC-_S4C&amp;pg=PA234}}&lt;/ref&gt; mixed with [[Akpa]] and [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]] ancestry that originated from the [[Arochukwu]] kingdom in present-day [[Abia state]], [[Nigeria]]. The Aros can also be found in about 250 other settlements mostly in the Southeastern Nigeria and adjacent areas. The Aros today are classified as Eastern or Cross River Igbos because of their location, mixed origins, culture, and dialect. Their god, [[Ibini Ukpabi]], was a key factor in establishing the [[Aro Confederacy]] as a regional power in the Niger Delta and Southeastern Nigeria during the 18th and 19th centuries.

== Origins and history ==
{{main|Aro history}}

The history of the Aros predates Igbo migration and founding of the kingdom of Arochukwu. Before Igbos started arriving to the Aro region in the 17th century, Ibibios arrived from the Benue and plateau area and founded states such as [[Obong Okon Ita]] and [[Ibom]] west of the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]]. Igbo migrations led by [[Eze Agwu]] and [[Nnachi]]  into the Aro region started in the mid-17th century. These Igbo migrants were resisted by the indigenous Ibibio. The [[Aro-Ibibio wars]] and the migration of the Akpa from east of the Cross River, formed the [[nation]] during the turning point of the 17th century to the 18th century. The Igbo and Akpa alliance, defeated and assimilated the original Ibibio inhabitants after long years of warfare. By this time, the palm oil and slave trade was popular in the hinterland. By the mid-18th century, there were mass migrations of Aro businessmen to the Igbo hinterland and adjacent areas. This migration, influence of their god Ibini Ukpabi through priests, and their military power supported by alliances with several related neighboring Igbo and eastern [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]] militarized states (particularly [[Ohafia]], [[Abam]], [[Abiriba]], [[Nkporo]], [[Afikpo]], [[Ekoi people|Ekoi]], etc.) quickly established the [[Aro Confederacy]] as a regional economic power. However, Aro economic hegemony was threatened by the penetration of [[European ethnic groups|European]]s, mainly [[United Kingdom|British]] [[colonists]] towards the end of the 19th century. Tensions finally led to bloodshed, and the [[Anglo-Aro war]] took place from 1901 to 1902. The Aro Confederacy stoutly resisted but eventually suffered defeat. This helped the British to occupy the rest of what became Eastern Nigeria.

== Tradition ==
The Aros have a rich tradition. One factor is the [[Ekpe|Ekpe society]] which is a sacred cult originally from east of the Cross River. The highly religious and judicial cult took a major part in Aro cultism. The use of the writing system, [[Nsibidi]], was based on secret societies like Ekpe. [[Uli (design)|Uli]], another writing system, occurred mostly in the form of  body art.

Another factor is the Ibini Ukpabi shrine, who was a mediating [[Alusi|god]] among the Aros. They influenced neighbors and allies before the British invasion. The shrine was later corrupted, commercialized, and used for selling slaves during the slave trade. The Ekeleke masquerade activity was important in Aro settlements rather than Ekpe. Brought from the Aros in the western Niger Delta, it eventually spread to the [[Oguta]] area. They also were known for wearing the popular "George" cloth. The Ikperikpe warrior dance was very famous among warriors in the old days and continues to in use.

The '''Atlantic slave trade to Brazil''' refers to the period of history in which there was a forced migration of Africans to Brazil for the purpose of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = USI Home Page|url = http://www.understandingslavery.com/|website = www.understandingslavery.com|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lasted from the mid-sixteenth century until the mid-nineteenth century. African, Portuguese, Dutch, British, and Brazilians dominated a trade that involved the movement of more than 3 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Atlantic slave trade|url = http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/atlantic-slave-trade|website = www.sahistory.org.za|accessdate = 2015-11-30|last = tinashe}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was divided into four phases: The Cycle of [[Guinea-Bissau|Guinea]] (16th century); the Cycle of [[Angola]] (17th century) which trafficked people from [[Bakongo]], [[Mbundu people|Mbundu]], [[Benguela Province|Benguela]] and [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]]; Cycle of Costa da Mina, now renamed Cycle of [[Benin]] and [[Dahomey]] (18th century - 1815), which trafficked people from [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], Ewe, Minas, [[Hausa people|Hausa]], [[Nupe people|Nupe]] and [[Borno State|Borno]]; and the Illegal trafficking period, suppressed by [[England]] (1815-1851).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Brasil: uma história|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sjYsAAAAYAAJ|publisher = Ática|date = 2003-01-01|isbn = 9788508082131|language = pt|first = Eduardo|last = Bueno}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, to escape the supervision of the British ships, the slave traders began to seek alternative routes to the routes of the West African coast, turning to [[Mozambique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = MultiRio — Educação sobre o consumo|url = http://www.multirio.rj.gov.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1405&amp;Itemid=118|website = MultiRio|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early  History ==

The [[slave trade]] had already a strong presence in Africa for thousands of years, at the time of the European [[Age of Discovery|Age of Discoveries]]. The Portuguese began contact with the African slave markets to rescue civilians and military captives since the time of the Reconquista. At this time, the Alfaqueque was the one who had the mission to negotiate captives rescue. When [[Catherine of Austria, Queen of Portugal|Catherine of Austria]] authorized the slave trade to Brazil, the slave trade from Africa, which was previously dominated by Africans, started also to be dominated by Europeans.[[File:Francisco_Félix_de_Souza.jpg|thumb|Francisco Félix de Souza (1754-1849), the most famous Brazilian slave trader]]

The lists of enslaved captives for ransom and freed during the reign of [[John V of Portugal]] reveal that even Brazilians were captured and sold in African markets.

The slave trade to Brazil was not exclusive to European and Brazilian white traders, but it was an activity in which pumbeiros, who were mestizos, free blacks and also former slaves, not only dedicated to the slave trade as controlled trade coastal - in the case of Angola, also part of domestic trade - also played the role of cultural mediators in the [[Atlantic]] slave trade of Africa. See [[Francisco Félix de Sousa]], freed at age 17, the largest Brazilian slaves trader.

== The motive of trafficking - the sugar economy ==
From 1530, with the knowledge gained in the manufacture of sugar in the islands of [[Madeira]] and [[São Tomé]], and then with the creation in 1549 of the [[State of Brazil|General Government to Brazil]], the [[Portuguese Crown]] sought to encourage the construction of sugar mills in Brazil. But the settlers found great difficulties in recruitment of manpower and lack of capital to finance the installation of sugar mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A dinâmica da escravidão no Brasil: resistência, tráfico negreiro e alforrias, séculos XVII a XIX|url = http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0101-33002006000100007&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=pt|journal = Novos Estudos - CEBRAP|issn = 0101-3300|pages = 107–123|issue = 74|doi = 10.1590/S0101-33002006000100007|first = Rafael de Bivar|last = Marquese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The various epidemics that, from 1560, decimated the Indian slaves at an alarming rate, caused that the Portuguese Crown to create laws that prohibit, partially, the slavery of Indians, that is, "forbade the enslavement of converted Indians and only allowed the capture of slaves only through war against the Indians that they fight or devour the Portuguese, or Allied Indians or slaves; this war should be enacted by the sovereign or the Governor General." Other adaptations of this law came later.

The subsequent lack of manpower meant that he needed to introduce labor from other sources.[[File:Navio negreiro - Rugendas 1830.jpg|thumb|Rugendas - Nègres a fond de cale]]As for the Dutch, from 1630, they began to occupy the sugar producing regions in Brazil, and to address the lack of slave labor, in 1638 embarked on the conquest of Portuguese warehouse of [[São Jorge da Mina]] , and 1641, organized the take over of [[Luanda]] and [[Benguela]] in Angola.

It is argued that the survival of the first gadgets, the planting of sugarcane, cotton, coffee and tobacco were the decisive elements in the metropolis sent to the Brazil the first African slaves, coming from different parts of Africa, bringing their habits, customs, music, dance, cuisine, language, myths, rites and religion, which has infiltrated the people, forming, next to the Catholic religion, the two largest religions in Brazil.

== The first slaves and the legalization of slavery ==
The Portuguese crown authorized the slavery with papal blessing, documented in the inserts of Nicolau V Dum diversos e Divino Amorecommuniti, both of 1452, which authorized the Portuguese to reduce Africans to the condition of slaves with the intention of Christianizing. The regulation of slavery was legislated in Manueline ordinances:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gptec.cfch.ufrj.br/leis/default.asp |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107191137/http://www.gptec.cfch.ufrj.br/leis/default.asp |archive-date=2012-01-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the adoption of slavery had been thus try to overcome the serious lack of manpower, that there was also all over Europe due to the recurrence of epidemics, many of them from Africa and the East.

The earliest record of sending African slaves to Brazil dates from 1533 when Pero de Gois, Captain-Mor da Costa of Brazil, requested the King, the shipment of 17 black for his captaincy of São Tomé (Paraíba do Sul / Macaé).[[File:The_Slave_market_at_Rio.jpg|thumb|The Slave market at Rio]]Table 1824 of the English painter Edward Francis Finden portraying a slave market in Rio de Janeiro

Then, by Charter of March 29, 1559, Mrs. Catherine of Austria, regent of Portugal, authorized each plantation owner of Brazil, with a statement by the Governor General, to import up to 120 slaves.

When the Portuguese arrived in Africa, they found an African market widely implemented and quite extensive slaves.

Africans were enslaved for various reasons before being acquired: &lt;sup&gt;[citation needed]&lt;/sup&gt;

* attachment: people were pledged as collateral for the payment of debts;
* abduction individual or a small group of people in attacking small villages;

The '''Baghdad School''' was a relatively short-lived yet influential school of [[Islamic art]] developed during the late 12th century in the capital [[Baghdad]] of the ruling [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. The movement had largely died out by the early 14th century, five decades following the invasion of the [[Mongols]] in 1258 and the downfall of the Abbasids' rule, and would eventually be replaced by stylistic movements from the [[Mongol]] tradition.  The Baghdad School is particularly noted for its distinctive approach to manuscript illustration.  The faces depicted in illustrations were individualized and expressive, with the scenes often highlighting realistic features of everyday life from the period.  This stylistic movement used strong, bright colors, and employed a balanced sense of design and a decorative quality, with illustrations often lacking traditional frames and appearing between lines of text on manuscript pages.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Online, s. v. "Baghdad school," accessed May 04, 2013, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/48804/Baghdad-school.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Baghdad School of art is noted for its manuscript artwork. The school consisted of calligraphers, illustrators, transcribers and translators, who collaborated to produce illuminated manuscripts derived from non-Arabic sources. The characteristic Baghdad School artistic style, which features sprightly characters bearing highly expressive faces and hand gestures (rather than stereotypical people), reached its peak in the first half of the 13th-century, although some examples can be identified at earlier periods.&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad School," in: Miriam Drake (ed), ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science,'' Volume 2, 2nd ed., CRC Press, 2003, p. 1259&lt;/ref&gt;  Illustrations in this style represent a skilful blend of Byzantine, Persian and Arab features.&lt;ref&gt;Ekhtiar, M., ''Masterpieces from the Department of Islamic Art in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,'' New York, N.Y., [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 2011, p. 94; Ipşiroğlu, M.S., ''Painting and Culture of the Mongols,'' Abrams, 1966, p. 37; Rahimova, Z., "Miniature Painting of the Middle Eastern Arabic School of Miniature," ''Journal of the Academy of Arts'' (Uzbekistan), No. 2, 2015, [http://sanat.orexca.com/2015/2012-2-2015/miniature-painting-of-the-middle-eastern-arabic-school-of-miniature/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Very few illuminated copies of the [[Quaran|Q'ran]] from this period have survived, but a number of secular manuscripts are still extant.&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad school," in: Miriam Drake (ed), ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science,'' Volume 2, 2nd ed., [[CRC Press]], 2003, p. 1259.&lt;/ref&gt; These manuscripts are primarily scientific treatises or social commentaries. 

The descriptor, "Baghdad School", was coined by the French [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]], Eustache De Lorey, in 1938, when he curated an exhibition of illustrations from ''[[Maqamat Badi' az-Zaman al-Hamadhani]]'' for the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].&lt;ref&gt;Esanu, O., ''Art, Awakening, and Modernity in the Middle East: The Arab Nude,'' Routledge, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; Some art historians and curators used the term, ''Mesopotamian School,''&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Day, G.E., "Mesopotamian Manuscripts of Dioscorides," ''Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin,'' n.d.,  p,. 277, [https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257424.pdf.bannered.pdf Online:]; Dimand, M.S., ''A Handbook of Mohammedan Decorative Arts,'' New York, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 1930, pp 18-20 or Rahimova, Z., "Miniature Painting of the Middle Eastern Arabic School of Miniature," ''Journal of the Academy of Arts'' (Uzbekistan), No. 2, 2015, [http://sanat.orexca.com/2015/2012-2-2015/miniature-painting-of-the-middle-eastern-arabic-school-of-miniature/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; while other scholars have suggested that the term should be replaced with something broader, such as the Arab School of Miniatures, because its exponents were not just confined to Baghdad and Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Osier, P., ''Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations and illustrations of ''[[De Materia Medica]]''==

The [[Greeks|Greek]] [[materia medica]], in particular herbals and [[bestiaries]], which described the characteristics and medicinal uses of various plants and animals found in the Mediterranean world, were among the books transcribed.&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;“Preparation of Medicine from Honey: Leaf from an Arabic Translation of the Materia Medica of Dioscorides [Iraq, Baghdad School] (13.152.6)”. In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000--. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/13.152.6 (December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  Several Arabic translations of [[Dioscorides]]' work, ''[[De Materia Medica]]'' have been discovered. [[Dioscorides]]' treatise was considered especially important, and remains one of the best examples of manuscript translation and illustration produced by the Baghdad School.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt; [[Dioscorides]] was a renowned [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] physician, herbalist, and pharmacist serving the [[Roman Empire]] and its armies during the first century CE, whose work gained influence throughout the medieval Islamic world.&lt;ref name="metmuseum" /&gt;

Of these, a manuscript known as the ''Mashhad Manuscript'', originally believed to be 13th-century  work, has been reassessed and now dated to between 1152 and 1176, providing one of the earliest examples of illustrations in the style of the Baghdad School.&lt;ref&gt;Day, G.E., "Mesopotamian Manuscripts of Dioscorides," Metropolitan Museum of Art, n.d. [https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257424.pdf.bannered.pdf Online:] The manuscript has no colophon with date, but it has a 4-page introduction written by Mihran ibn Mansur ibn Miihran, who translated it for Najm ad-din Alpi, the Urtuqid prince, ruler from 1152 to 1176.&lt;/ref&gt; Another early example of these translations is the translation and work probably by Abdallah ibn al-Fadl.&lt;ref&gt;Dimand, M., ''New Accessions of Islamic Art,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, n.d. [https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257747.pdf.bannered.pdf Online:]; Day, G.E., "Mesopotamian Manuscripts of Dioscorides," Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, n.d., p,. 277, [https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257424.pdf.bannered.pdf Online:] The manuscript has a colophon which establishes the date as the month of Rajab 620 A.H./ July-August 1224&lt;/ref&gt; The illustrations were considered especially important, and it remains one of the best examples of manuscript translation and illustration produced by the Baghdad School.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;  [[Dioscorides]] was a renowned Greek physician, herbalist, and pharmacist serving the [[Roman Empire]] and its armies during the first century CE, whose work gained influence throughout the medieval Islamic world.&lt;ref name="metmuseum" /&gt; 

Among the illustrated manuscript leaves of the 13th-century [[Dioscorides]]' ''Materia Medica'' is the page entitled, “Physician Preparing an Elixir," also referred to by The Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History as “Preparation of Medicine from Honey.”  It is dated 1224 CE and was found in [[Iraq]] or Northern Jazira, possibly [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name="metmuseum" /&gt;  The page depicts an illustration of a bearded physician with a colorful blue headscarf and red clothing seated on an ornamental stool.  He is mixing a yellow pot with a ladle while overlooking a yellow cauldron hanging from a red tripod above a wide blue container.  His other hand is raised up towards his mouth.  A large blue jug lies to the left of the tripod.  Two overhanging trees on either side of the scene bear leaves and two different types of what appear to be colorful fruit or flowers—red on the left and yellow on the right.  The ground below the scene is covered with green grass, however there is no background depicted in the illustration thus reducing the sense of depth. The style of illustration depicted on this manuscript leaf is thus an excellent example of the Baghdad School: the colors are bright and distinctive, the objects depicted in the scene have a balanced, symmetrical design with the trees framing the illustration, and finally, the man’s face appears to be in a state of deep, expressive contemplation.  The scene itself has a realistic and personalized quality to it, depicting a physician in a natural setting as he prepares a medicinal mixture containing honey for his patients, and yet also has ornamental characteristics with its design and choice of colors—another distinctive feature of the Baghdad School.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;

==Transcription and illustration of ''Maqamat''==
The Abbasid artist, [[Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti|Yahya Al-Wasiti]], who lived in [[Baghdad]] in the late Abassid era (12th to 13th-centuries), was one of the pre-eminent exponents of the Baghdad school. In 1236-37, he is known to have transcribed and illustrated the book, ''[[Maqamat Badi' az-Zaman al-Hamadhani|Maqamat]]'' (also known as the ''Assemblies'' or the ''Sessions''), a series of anecdotes of social satire written by [[Al-Hariri of Basra]].&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad school," in: ''Encyclopedia Britannica,'' [https://www.britannica.com/art/Baghdad-school Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative concerns the travels of a middle-aged man as he uses his charm and eloquence to swindle his way across the Arabic world.&lt;ref&gt;Esanu, O., ''Art, Awakening, and Modernity in the Middle East: The Arab Nude,'' Routledge, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In the 20th-century, al-Waiti's illustrations and the Baghdad School served as an inspiration for [[Iraqi art#Jama’et Baghdad lil Fenal-Hadith (The Baghdad Modern Art Group)|The Baghdad Modern Art Group]].&lt;ref&gt;Wijdan, A. (ed.), ''Contemporary Art From The Islamic World,'' p.166&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in the 1950s by artists, [[Jawad Saleem]] and [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]], members of the group believed that the Mongol invasion of the 13th-century represented a "break in the chain of pictorial Iraqi art"&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Jewad Selim: On Abstraction and Symbolism," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' [http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/essays/Pages/Jewad-Selim,-On-Abstraction-and-Symbolism.aspx Online]&lt;/ref&gt; and wanted to reassert a national identity and build a distinctive Iraqi identity which referenced heritage and tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrike al-Khamis, “An Historical Overview 1900s-1990s,” in: Maysaloun, F.

The Bhatiara (shekh Masoodi)are a  community, found in [[North India]]. They are also known as Farooqi and Shaikh Farooqi. (Converted )(&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII  Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pages 278 to 284&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==
The Bhatiara are the traditional innkeepers of [[North India]]. They enjoyed royal patronage in running inns all along the trade routes in [[India]]. The community trace their descent from Salim Shah, a brother the [[Sher Shah Suri]], the last ruler of [[North India]]. After the overthrow of the [[Suri dynasty|Suri]] dynasty, members of the royal family were forced into the occupation of inn-keeping by the vengeful [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]s. Although claiming to be [[Pashtun people|Pathan]], their clans reveal a heterogeneous origin. Their main clans are the Bahlim, Bhil, Chauhan, Chriyamar, Jalkhatri, Madariya, Muderi, Sidiqui, Nanbai, Shirazi and Sulaimani.&lt;ref name="A Hasan page 278"&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII  Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 278&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==
The Bhatiara are no longer involved in their traditional occupation of inn-keeping. This decline in their occupation has also led the disappearance of their caste council. The community were historically [[Sunni]] of the [[Barelvi]] disposition, but many now belong to the [[Deobandi]] or [[Ahle Hadith]] sects.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII  Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 283&lt;/ref&gt;

The community is dispersed all along the [[Grand Trunk Road]], but are concentrated in [[Allahabad]] and [[Fatehpur, Uttar Pradesh|Fatehpur]]. The community speaks [[Awadhi]], but many are shifting to [[Urdu]]. They perceive themselves to be of [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh]] status, but this claim is not accepted by other recognized Shaikh groups, such as the [[Muslim Kayasths]] and [[Milki (caste)|Milkis]]. A significant minority of Bhatiaras have also emigrated to [[Pakistan]], where they form an important element in the [[Muhajir (Pakistan)|Muhajir]] community.&lt;ref name="A Hasan page 278"/&gt;

In [[Bihar]], the Bhatiara are also known as Farooqi though are not descended from Umar Bin Khattab. According to their traditions, the ruler Salim Shah Suri settled them along the Grand Trunk Road as inn-keepers. They speak the [[Magadhi]] dialect, and are found mainly in central [[Bihar]]. The community are strictly endogamous, with virtually no cases of inter-marriage with other communities. They are essentially an urban community. They are some of the more successful [[Bihari Muslim]] communities, and many have now taken to education. The community have a statewide caste association, the Farooqi Jamat, which deals with community welfare.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Bihar Volume XVI  Part One edited by S Gopal &amp; Hetukar Jha pages 158 to 1622 Seagull Books&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bhatiara of Rajasthan ==

In [[Rajasthan]], the Bhatiara claim descent, and according to their traditions, they arrived with the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] armies that invaded Rajasthan in the 16th Century. The Bhattiara were assigned duties to maintain inns by the Mughal authorities in the conquered towns. They are still distributed in these towns such as [[Alwar]], [[Bharatpur, Rajasthan|Bharatpur]], [[Sikar]], [[Jhunjhunu]], [[Bikaner]], [[Churu]] and [[Nagaur]]. The community either speak [[Marwari language|Marwari]] or Shaikhawati, depending on where they live. Most also understand [[Urdu]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated138"&gt;People of India Rajasthan Volume XXXVIII Part One edited by B.K Lavania, D. K Samanta, S K Mandal  &amp; N.N Vyas pages 138 to 44 Popular Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other [[Muslim]] groups in [[Rajasthan]], the Bhatiara are strictly [[endogamy|endogamous]], preferring to marry close kin. They maintain a distance from neighbouring Musllim communities such as the [[Meo]], [[Kunjra]], [[Qassab|Kasia]] and [[Hajjam]]. The Bhattiara occupy distinct quarters within the towns they are found in.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

The Bhatiara are still involved in their traditional occupation of inn keeping The Bhattiara have a permanent economic relations with the [[Meo]] and [[Qaimkhani]]s.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

The '''Campaign for Social Science''' was launched in 2011 to advocate social science to the UK Government and to the public, at a time of significant change in the higher education system. It campaigns for the restoration of the post of Government Chief Social Science Advisor, promotes social science in the media and on the web, and organises roadshows and other events to emphasise the value of social science.

==History==
The Campaign was established by the [[Academy of Social Sciences]] and was formally launched at the House of Lords in January 2011, at an event that featured speakers including [[Trevor Phillips]], Chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, [[Polly Toynbee]], the Guardian columnist, and [[David Willetts]], the then Universities and Science Minister in the Coalition Government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialsciencespace.com/2011/01/launch-of-campaign-for-social-science-in-the-uk Launch of Campaign for Social Science in the UK&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and funding==
The Campaign’s Board is chaired by James Wilsdon, Professor of Research Policy, Department of Politics, Director of Impact and Engagement, Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Sheffield and founding director of the Science Policy Centre at the Royal Society. Other members are:

Dr Milly Zimeta, freelance journalist, writer and lecturer at the University of Roehampton. 

The Campaign receives no state funding, and relies on donations and sponsorship; among its sponsors are 50 universities, 23 learned societies, six publishers and two charities. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uk.sagepub.com/aboutus/press/2012/apr/11_apr.htm | SAGE]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lobbying==
The Campaign has urged the restoration of the post of Government Chief Social Science Advisor, which was removed in 2010 when the role was downgraded and split between two people who also have other responsibilities. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/mar/19/the-case-for-a-chief-social-scientist The case for a chief social scientist | Higher Education Network | Guardian Professional&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Campaign made its case to the House of Lords Science Select Committee on Science and Technology, which issued a report in February 2012 calling for the post to be reinstated.  

==Events== 
As of December 2013, the Campaign had held 19 roadshows at universities around the UK to emphasise the value and importance of social science and to encourage support and donations. 

With the Academy of Social Sciences, the Campaign organised a conference on the [[2011 England riots]] at [[Gresham College]], London, in October 2011, and a public discussion on the future of universities, at the University of East London in October 2011. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/joepublic/2011/oct/12/what-caused-england-riots?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487| The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt; The Campaign held a launch for the latest booklet in its Making the Case for the Social Sciences, in November 2013, on mental wellbeing; speakers including Professor Lord Richard Layard and Andy Burnham, Shadow Secretary of State for Health. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgHwKFSVnTs&amp;feature=youtu.be| YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publicity==
The Campaign promotes social science in the media, with letters and articles published in the [[Times Higher Education]] magazine and [[The Guardian]] newspaper on issues such as the Chief Social Science Advisor and the need for closer relations between social scientists and government.

'''Cape Verdean Argentines''' are Argentine residents whose ancestry originated in [[Cape Verde]]. According to the 1980 census, there were about 8,000; but today's population was estimated by some sources to be around 2,000 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umassd.edu/SpecialPrograms/CaboVerde/wwpopest.html  University of Massachusetts - Dartmouth.  "1995 Cape Verdean Diaspora Population Estimates." Retrieved on October 18, 2007.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829094133/http://www.umassd.edu/specialprograms/caboverde/wwpopest.html |date=August 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources estimate that in 2006 there were 12,000-15,000 descendants of immigrants from Cape Verde living in Argentina, of whom about 300 are native to the African continent.&lt;ref name = CABOVERDIANOS&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=862751 ''Caboverdianos: vientos de cambio'', Revista del diario La Nación, 03/12/2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most [[Afro-Argentine]]s, who are descended from slaves, the Cape Verdean community arrived in the country voluntarily.

The first Cape Verdeans immigrated to [[Argentina]] in small numbers in the late 19th century.  The numbers increased dramatically from the 1920s to [[World War II]]. The busiest periods were between 1927 and 1933 and the third, after 1946. They were driven from [[Cape Verde]] by lack of jobs, resources, and opportunities.

Most Cape Verdeans and their descendants are centered in [[Buenos Aires Province]]. They were expert sailors and fishermen; which is why most of them settled close to the shore or in ports, and obtained sea-related occupations. They settled in ports such as [[Rosario]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[San Nicolás de los Arroyos]], [[Bahía Blanca]], [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]] and [[Dock Sud]]. 95% of them got jobs in the [[Argentine Navy]]'s Sea Fleet, in the Merchant Navy, or in the Fluvial Fleet in YPF, dockyards or ELMA.&lt;ref name = CABOVERDIANOS /&gt;

Many used to face discrimination in the predominantly European-Argentine society.  Two organizations for mutual support and cultural exchange have existed for over 60 years.  The Society Of Mutual Aid "The Cape Verdean Union" of Dock-Sud (South Dock) was founded in 1932 and the Cape Verdean Sport And Culture Club of Ensenada was founded around the same period.

'''Charis Elizabeth Kubrin''' is an American criminologist and Professor of Criminology, Law and Society at the [[University of California, Irvine]] (UCI).
==Education and career==
After receiving her Ph.D. from the [[University of Washington]] in 2000, Kubrin taught at [[George Washington University]] for 11 years; she left George Washington University for UCI in the summer of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://research.universityofcalifornia.edu/profiles/2012/01/charis-kubrin.html | title=Charis Kubrin | publisher=University of California | work=Research Profiles | date=January 2012 | accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, she and her UCI colleague [[Carroll Seron]] served as editors of a special issue of the ''[[Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]]'' about prison realignment in [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://psmag.com/california-s-criminal-justice-experiment-15b07de95fed#.nk2a9bre9 | title=California’s Criminal Justice Experiment | work=Pacific Standard | date=24 February 2016 | accessdate=24 August 2016 | author=Wheeling, Kate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Kubrin's research focuses on, among other topics, the relationship between race, violence, and [[social disorganization theory]]. She has also researched the perception of [[rap music]] as violent and dangerous, as well as whether a rapper's music can be used as evidence against him in a court of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/rap-697430-kubrin-says.html | title=UC Irvine hip-hop professor seeks poetic justice | work=Orange County Register | date=28 December 2015 | accessdate=24 August 2016 | author=Puente, Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rap-in-the-courtroom-advocates-question-lyrics-as-evidence/ | title=Should rap lyrics be allowed as evidence in the courtroom? | work=CBS News | date=12 March 2014 | accessdate=24 August 2016 | author=Donaghue, Erin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/06/19/infamous-street-gang-boasted-videos-violence-and-some-knew-hip-hop-star-benzino/wOUzFCEvks3jGypdTjRGpK/story.html | title=Boston gang used online videos for threats, FBI says | work=Boston Globe | date=19 June 2015 | accessdate=24 August 2016 | author=Ellement, John R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/amicus/2014/12/dahlia_lithwick_speaks_with_uc_irvine_criminology_professor_charis_kubrin.html |title=Amicus: Rapper’s Intent |last=Lithwick |first=Dahlia |authorlink=Dahlia Lithwick |website=Slate |publication-date=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Graham Ousey]], she has also studied the relationship between [[immigration and crime]] in the United States, finding that immigration is related to lower rates of crime and violence in U.S. neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Kubrin |first=Charis |date=2017-02-07 |title=Immigrants Do Not Increase Crime, Research Shows |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/immigrants-do-not-increase-crime-research-shows/ |magazine=Scientific American |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Chad-demography.png|thumb|right|Demographics of Chad, Data of [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]
The people of [[Chad]] speak more than 100 different languages and divide themselves into many ethnic groups. However, language and ethnicity are not the same. Moreover, neither element can be tied to a particular physical type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/chad/demographics_profile.html|title=Chad Demographics Profile 2016|work=indexmundi.com|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the possession of a common language shows that its speakers have lived together and have a common history, peoples also change languages. This is particularly so in Chad, where the openness of the terrain, marginal rainfall, frequent drought and famine, and low population densities have encouraged physical and linguistic mobility. Slave raids among{{specify}} non-Muslim peoples, internal slave trade, and exports of captives northward from the ninth to the twentieth centuries also have resulted in language changes.

Anthropologists view ethnicity as being more than genetics. Like language, ethnicity implies a shared heritage, partly economic, where people of the same ethnic group may share a livelihood, and partly social, taking the form of shared ways of doing things and organizing relations among individuals and groups. Ethnicity also involves a cultural component made up of shared values and a common worldview. Like language, ethnicity is not immutable. Shared ways of doing things change over time and alter a group's perception of its own identity.

Not only do the social aspects of ethnic identity change but the biological composition (or gene pool) also may change over time. Although most ethnic groups emphasize intermarriage, people are often proscribed from seeking partners among close relatives—a prohibition that promotes biological variation. In all groups, the departure of some individuals or groups and the integration of others also changes the biological component.

The Chadian government has avoided official recognition of ethnicity. With the exception of a few surveys conducted shortly after independence, little data were available on this important aspect of Chadian society. Nonetheless, ethnic identity was a significant component of life in Chad.

The peoples of Chad carry significant ancestry from [[East Africa|Eastern]], [[Central Africa|Central]], [[West Africa|Western]], and [[North Africa|Northern Africa]].&lt;ref name=''Sc1'' /&gt;

Chad's languages fall into ten major groups, each of which belongs to either the
[[Nilo-Saharan]], [[Afro-Asiatic]], or [[Niger–Congo]] language family. These represent three of the four major language families in Africa; only the [[Khoisan]] languages of southern Africa are not represented. The presence of such different languages suggests that the [[Lake Chad Basin]] may have been an important point of dispersal in ancient times.

==Population==
According to {{UN_Population|source}} the total population was {{UN_Population|Chad}} in {{UN_Population|Year}}, compared to only 2 429 000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 45.4%, 51.7% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 2.9% was 65 years or older

==Religions==
{{main article|Religion in Chad}}
The separation of religion from social structure in Chad represents a false dichotomy, for they are perceived as two sides of the same coin. Three religious traditions coexist in Chad- [[Traditional African religion|classical African religions]], [[Islam in Chad|Islam]], and [[Christianity in Chad|Christianity]]. None is monolithic. The first tradition includes a variety of ancestor and/or place-oriented religions whose expression is highly specific. Islam, although characterized by an orthodox set of beliefs and observances, also is expressed in diverse ways. Christianity arrived in Chad much more recently with the arrival of Europeans. Its followers are divided into [[Roman Catholicism in Chad|Roman Catholics]] and Protestants (including several denominations); as with Chadian Islam, Chadian Christianity retains aspects of pre-Christian religious belief.

The number of followers of each tradition in Chad is unknown. Estimates made in 1962 suggested that 35 percent of Chadians practiced classical African religions, 55 percent were [[Islam|Muslims]], and 10 percent were [[Christianity|Christians]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, this distribution undoubtedly changed. Observers report that Islam has spread among the [[Hajerai]] and among other non-Muslim populations of the Saharan and sahelian zones. However, the proportion of Muslims may have fallen because the birthrate among the followers of traditional religions and Christians in southern Chad is thought to be higher than that among Muslims. In addition, the upheavals since the mid-1970s have resulted in the departure of some missionaries; whether or not Chadian Christians have been numerous enough and organized enough to have attracted more converts since that time is unknown.

== Ethnic groups ==

Ethnic [[Melanesians]] known as [[Kanak people|Kanak]] constituted 39% of the population in 2014, followed by [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] with 27%. The [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]]  are the largest ethnic group in the province Sud (South), while Kanak are the majority in the two other provinces. There is also a large minority from other Polynesian islands, mainly from [[Wallis and Futana]] (8%), but also from [[Tahiti]] (2%) and [[Vanuatu]] (1%). The remainder of the population (23%) is mainly from Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/1560282 Recensement de la population en Nouvelle-Calédonie en 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isee.nc/tec/popsociete/telechargements/4-population.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Don't Mess with Texas''''' is a slogan for a campaign aimed at reducing [[litter]]ing on [[Texas]] roadways by the [[Texas Department of Transportation]]. The phrase "Don't Mess with Texas" is prominently shown on road signs on major highways, television, radio and in print advertisements. The campaign is credited with reducing litter on Texas highways roughly 72% between 1986 and 1990.&lt;ref name="success"&gt;Tim McClure and Roy Spence, ''Don't Mess with Texas: The Story Behind the Legend'', Idea City Press, 2006, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign's target market was 18- to 35-year-old males, which was statistically shown to be the most likely to litter.  While the slogan was not originally intended to become a statewide cultural phenomenon, it did.&lt;!--Cited below--&gt;

Beyond its immediate role in reducing litter, the slogan has been popularly appropriated by Texans. The phrase has become "an identity statement, a declaration of Texas swagger".&lt;ref name=2013NYTimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Fernandez|first=Manny|title=Not to Be, Um, Trifled With, Texas Guards Its Slogans|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/us/not-to-be-um-trifled-with-texas-guards-its-slogans.html?_r=0|accessdate=29 December 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the origin of the slogan is not well known outside of Texas, it appears on countless items of tourist [[souvenir]]s. Since the phrase is a federally [[registered trademark]], the department has tried at times to enforce its trademark rights with cease and desist letters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jul/06/nation/na-texas6 |title=No Messing Around With Texas' Slogan |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2004-07-06 |accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has had very limited success. The slogan is the title of the book, ''Don’t Mess With Texas: The Story Behind the Legend''.

"Don't Mess with Texas" has been awarded a plaque on the Madison Avenue Walk of Fame and a place in the [[Advertising Hall of Fame]], a distinction given to only two slogans annually.&lt;ref name="winner"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.statesman.com/business/content/business/stories/other/09/30/30dontmess.html?imw=Y | title='Don't Mess with Texas' named top ad slogan | publisher=Austin American-Statesman | author=Rockwell, Lilly | date=29 September 2006 | accessdate=2006-09-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061010075121/http://www.statesman.com/business/content/business/stories/other/09/30/30dontmess.html?imw=Y &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Don't Mess with Texas" is also the official motto of the [[Virginia class submarine|''Virginia''-class]] [[submarine]] [[USS Texas (SSN-775)|USS ''Texas'']].

In 2011 the result of a public vote for the best "Don't Mess with Texas" ad over the last 25 was revealed, the winner was one created by the [[Commemorative Air Force]] (then called the Confederate Air Force).&lt;ref name="Winner of FAVORITE DON’T MESS WITH TEXAS AD OF PAST 25 YEARS"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dontmesswithtexas.org/about/press/article/?year=2011&amp;month=02&amp;day=21 |title=Confederate Air Force wins best ad in 25 years |work=[[Texas Department of Transportation]] |date=2011-02-21 |accessdate=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ad involved the CAF's Boeing [[B-17]] "[[Sentimental Journey (aircraft)|Sentimental Journey]]" pursuing and retaliating against a truck that threw trash out the window.

[[File:SSN775Logo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The crest for the submarine USS ''Texas''. The phrase "Don't Mess with Texas!" can be seen on the lower half of the crest.]]

In 1985 the [[Texas Department of Transportation]] (TXDOT) asked Mike Blair and [[Tim McClure]] of [[GSD&amp;M Idea City|GSD&amp;M]] to create a slogan for an anti-littering campaign. At the time the state of Texas spent about $20 million annually to clean litter from highways. McClure said that "bubbas in pickup trucks" who regularly littered beer cans and other items out of vehicle windows and ordinary Texans who believed that littering was a "God-given right" were targets of the advertising campaign. McClure said that he created the slogan when he saw the garbage while walking near his house. Emanuella Grinberg of ''[[CNN]]'' said that McClure had "an eleventh hour "aha" moment" when, after looking at the trash, he recalled his mother telling him that his room was messy. "McClure said It occurred to me that the only time I'd heard the word litter was in reference to dogs. Mess seemed like it would resonate better."&lt;ref name="Grinberg1"&gt;Grinberg, Emanuella. "Why there's no messing with Texas." [[CNN]]. July 1, 2011. [http://articles.cnn.com/2011-07-01/us/texas.pride_1_texans-bumper-stickers-texas-department?_s=PM:US 1]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714005926/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-07-01/us/texas.pride_1_texans-bumper-stickers-texas-department?_s=PM%3AUS |date=July 14, 2011 }}. Retrieved on July 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The creators initially had difficulty convincing TXDOT to adopt the slogan. The creators said that the administrators were "buzz-cutted, conservative kind of characters." The creators joked that the board members' average age was 107. McClure recalled that "The crowd was sprinkled with 'Keep America Beautiful' and 'Keep Texas Beautiful' folks, and our audience is 18-to-24 young males." McClure added that "The 'Keep Texas Beautiful' lady said, 'Can we at least say please?' I said, 'No ma'am, you cannot use the line if you put please in front of it.'  If not for the vision of Don Clark, the then Director of Travel and Information Division of the Texas Highway Department, the slogan would have never been used.  Clark went ahead with the slogan without the support of the TXDOT administrators.  After the first televised ad with Stevie Ray Vaughn aired, Clark jokes that he went to work the next day and was unsure if he would be fired.  TXDOT decided to ask the public for comment and there was a resounding positive result.  "&lt;ref name="Grinberg2"&gt;Grinberg, Emanuella. "Why there's no messing with Texas." ''[[CNN]]''.

The campaign began in 1985 with a series of bumper stickers. In 1986 the slogan premiered its first television advertisement, featuring [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], at the 50th Annual [[Cotton Bowl Classic]] on January 1, 1986, singing the "[[The Eyes of Texas|Eyes of Texas]]" with the line "Don't Mess with Texas" added at the end of the song.&lt;ref name="Grinberg1"/&gt; Since then, numerous musicians, athletes, celebrities and other famous Texans have appeared in "Don't Mess with Texas" radio and television [[public service announcement]]s, including:

Due to the budget cuts of the [[Great Recession]], TxDOT has expanded the use of the licence to sell "Don't Mess With Texas" related souvenirs in "state run rest areas, and travel information centers" in order to fill in its budget gaps. Until recently, the organization was forbidden to do so due to federal regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Batheja|first=Aman|title=TxDOT Hoping ‘Don’t Mess With Texas’ Provides More Cash|url=http://smmercury.com/2013/09/23/txdot-hoping-dont-mess-with-texas-provides-more-cash/|accessdate=29 December 2013|newspaper=San Marcos Mercury|date=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unauthorized use of the trademark==

Since 2000, TXDOT has contacted over 100 companies and organizations with [[cease and desist]] letters regarding the unauthorized use of the trademark phrase.

''''A [[management system]] is the framework of processes and procedures used to ensure that an organization can fulfill all tasks required to achieve its objectives.

After World War II, the reigning paradigm of product-oriented mass production had reached its peak. Examples of management systems at that time are [[Assembly lines|linear assembly lines]], organizational hierarchies of command, [[Quality control|product quality control]] and mass consumption.

Soon afterwards, the [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]]-[[Joseph M. Juran|Juran]] process-quality teachings spearheaded a new quality orientation (later referred to as [[Total quality management]]) and propelled Japan directly to the post-war process focus (process quality control, [[Just in time (business)|just-in-time]], continuous improvement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2004-08-29/deming-and-juran-the-kings-of-quality | title=Deming And Juran: The Kings Of Quality | publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek | date=August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The US responded by a painful and prolonged product-to-process transformation, ultimately leveling the playing field again by the mid 1980s.

At the end of the 1980s, [[business process reengineering]] focused on the radical redesign of the production process through the reintegration of task, labor and knowledge. As a result, lean, flexible and streamlined production processes were created, capable of fast response and internet-based integration necessary for the upcoming phase of supply chains - [[business-to-business]] (B2B) – as well as demand chains – [[Consumer-to-business|business-to-customer]] (B2C).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/in-business/advice/18436/the-evolution-of-management/ | title=The Evolution of Management | publisher=Business Matters | year=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.strategicleadershipinstitute.net/news/the-historical-evolution-of-management-theory-from-1900-to-present-the-changing-role-of-leaders-in-organizations-/ | title=The Historical Evolution of Management Theory from 1900 to Present: The Changing role of Leaders in Organizations | publisher=Strategic Leadership Institute | last=Bosman | first=Manie | year=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
	
In the above three stages of '''Evolution of Management Systems''', the competitive advantage was derived almost exclusively from the internal resources of the firm. At the end of the 1980s, a radical fourth shift has occurred: the competitive advantage became increasingly derived from the external resources of the firm – through the extended networks of suppliers and customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&amp;sid=f425a546-b334-4aff-a38e-a48ccc251d39%40sessionmgr4005&amp;hid=4108 | title=THE EVOLUTION OF MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS | date=March 1970 | last=Ackoff | first=Russell L. | journal=CORS Journal | volume=8 | issue=1 | page=P 1–13 | issn=0574-9638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Figure 1 Basic scheme product, process, external networks.PNG|thumb|'''Figure 1 Basic scheme: product, process, external networks'''|533x533px]]
Figure 1 refers to the basic scheme of production and service delivery process. It represents the traditional linear input-process-output management system. This system has been fixed and unchanging for centuries. The only change has been in terms of changing focus on individual components of the system, emphasizing different parts of this basic scheme.

Although the scheme itself (inputs → process → outputs) remains mostly unchallenged, there are some indications that this business model will undergo major restructurings in the future (in the emerging stages of Evolution of Management Systems). It will become disaggregated and distributed, subjected to non-linear modularity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slotine|first=Jean-Jacques|title=Modular Stability Tools for Distributed Computation and Control|journal=International Journal of Adaptive Control and Signal Processing|volume=17|url=http://web.mit.edu/nsl/www/preprints/modular.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and bringing forth new ways of making things and delivering services. Then it will become reintegrated again, tying together globally distributed components into a unified recycling whole.

== Early stages ==
All early stages are characterized by changing focus of attention within the unchanging, invariant scheme of Figure 1. The management system has typically focused on:

=== Final product ===

The final product is a primary focus, the production process is considered secondary. Its operations and their sequences are technologically fixed or ‘given’. Product quality is ‘inspected in’, mostly at the end of the process. [[Statistical quality control]], [[inventory control]], cost minimization, mass production, [[assembly line]], work specialization, hierarchies of command, mass consumption, statistical mass markets and forecasting are among the defining characteristics of this stage.

=== Partitioned process ===
It is the high-quality process that assures the high-quality product. The main focus was on improving of process operations. Quality of the process was understood as the quality of its operations. Powerful new concepts of [[Total Quality Management]] (TQM), [[Continuous Improvement Process]] ([[Kaizen]]) and Just-In-Time (JIT) systems have characterized this stage. Although the operations were being improved, the process architecture and structural sequencing were kept intact and remained technologically ‘given’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.springer.com/978-3-642-36683-3 | title=The Evolution of the Concept of‘Management Control’ | publisher=Springer | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Integrated process ===
The focus of attention shifted from operations (circles) to linkages (arrows) – thus changing the process architecture itself. The reengineering of the process, re-integrating individual components into effective, more autonomous and even self-manageable wholes, has characterized this stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ansoff|first=H. Igor|title=Conceptual underpinnings of systematic strategic management|journal=European Journal of Operational Research|date=January 1985|volume=19|issue=1|page=P 2–19|issn=0377-2217|doi=10.1016/0377-2217(85)90303-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The production process became a business process and therefore subject to qualitative redesign and reengineering ([[Business process reengineering|BPR]]). Discontinuous improvement and process innovation replaced the piecemeal continuous improvement. Traditional vertical hierarchies of command have flattened out into more horizontal, process-oriented networks. [[Mass customization]], disintermediation, [[knowledge management]] and autonomous teams have started emerging.

== Extended process ==
[[File:Extended process and Customer Intervention Point.PNG|thumb|'''Figure 2 Extended process and Customer Intervention Point'''|463x463px]]
Figure 2 refers to the paradigmatic shift from internal processes expanded into the extended process – including supplier networks and alliances as well as customer self-service, [[mass customization]] and disintermediation – as the increasingly external sources of competitive advantage.

In this recently peaked stage, networks of suppliers and communities of customers have extended the internal process into a functional and competitive whole. Both internal and external sources of knowledge and competitiveness have formed new core competencies. Supply and demand chains management have emerged, in dependence on shifting CIP (Customer Intervention Point). [[Intranets]] and [[extranets]] have provided a communication medium for B2B and B2C exchanges. Quality has become bundled together with cost, speed and reliability..

Today, powerful processes of [[global sourcing]] bring forth and foster a new set of relationships with customers and suppliers. The firm starts disaggregating its production processes, transferring, leasing or selling selected pieces off to a higher-added value operator or coordinator. Any firm can be only as good as is the network of which it is a part. Consequently, the firm has disaggregated and became a network.

== Distributed process ==
This emerging stage represents the most radical business refocusing so far. Through the [[global sourcing]], sections and components of the internal process are being outsourced to external providers and contractors in search of the highest added value contribution. Long-term alliances are formed and companies are transforming themselves into networks. Network cooperation is replacing corporate competition: ''[[coopetition]]'' emerges. The majority of companies (also the educational and training institutions) could still be the leading global players in this incessant and accelerating paradigm shifting. Globally distributed process ushers in new forms of organization, coordination and modular integration.

[[File:Distributed process and Outsourcing.PNG|thumb|'''Figure 3 Distributed process and Outsourcing'''|466x466px]]
Different parts of the extended process are geographically distributed and often spatially remote. In Figure 3, this distribution is represented by sections OS of the process which have been outsourced to higher added-value providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Connor|first=Gina Colarelli|title=Organizing for Radical Innovation: An Exploratory Study of the Structural Aspects of RI Management Systems in Large Established Firms|journal=Journal of Product Innovation Management|date=November 2006|volume=23|issue=6|page=P 475–497|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=f425a546-b334-4aff-a38e-a48ccc251d39%40sessionmgr4005&amp;vid=5&amp;hid=4108|issn=0737-6782|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5885.2006.00219.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Stage 5 (Figure 3) represents the most radical business refocusing emerging so far, still rapidly emerging kernels of the next stage (Figure 4) is taking shape. The evolutionary process, driven by relentless global search for maximum added value, is clearly accelerating. Management systems paradigm or business model, after a century of relative invariance, is becoming a new dynamic source of competitive advantage. Radically distributed supply and demand chains of Stage 5 will clearly have to be coordinated and reintegrated on a global scale. Reintegration processes are proceeding under increasing environmental pressures. The search for added value, after exploring traditional global resources, is now turning towards reuse, recycling, recovery and remanufacturing as new sources of maximizing added value. Innovation in business models will become a norm.

== Recycled process ==
[[File:Recycled Process and Global Sourcing.PNG|thumb|'''Figure 4 Recycled Process and Global Sourcing'''|465x465px]]
During the process of utilizing added value, the asset-recovery practices expand quickly to a majority of products and services (Dell, IBM, Xerox). New products are being designed for extended life spans and multiple profit cycles. Reverse logistics and [[Reverse logistics|reverse logistics management]] (RLM) are adding new loops to the traditionally unidirectional processes of supply chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Steps Forward, One Step Back...|url=http://www.infosys.com/industries/retail/white-papers/Documents/reverse-logistics-management.pdf|publisher=Infosys|author=Saty Chawla}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Old supply chains have become demand chains and now reverse value chains, demonstrating that value can be added in both directions: through the forward pass of production as well as through the backward pass of recovery and remanufacture. Concepts of easy disassembly, durability, reuse and recycling are built in into equipment design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glassey|first=Olivier|title=Exploring the weak signals of starts-ups as a folksonomic system|journal=Technology Analysis &amp; Strategic Management|date=April 2009|volume=21|issue=3|page=P 321–332|doi=10.1080/09537320902750632|issn=0953-7325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Figure 4 refers to closed-loop management system and it represents the Stage 6 of the '''Evolution of Management Systems'''. The new loops in the figure are not just traditional information feedback loops, but real business processes of collection, disassembly, reprocessing and reassembly activities (operations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://hbr.org/product/double-loop-management-making-strategy-a-continuous-process/an/B0007A-PDF-ENG | title=Double-Loop Management: Making Strategy a Continuous Process | last=Kaplan | first=Robert | journal=Harvard Business Review | year=July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The conventional open-ended linear processes are being redesigned towards closure.

New loops of recycled products and materials, [[energy recovery]] and knowledge renewal are being created within [[Global Sourcing and Supply (GSS)|global-sourcing]] (GS) networks. Product reuse/remanufacture relies on a high residual value which gives a good head start for added value maximization. The system becomes organizationally closed and potentially long-term sustainable or even trans-generations self-sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/the_great_transformer | title=The great transformer: The impact of the Internet on economic growth and prosperity | publisher=McKinsey Global Institute | last=Roxburgh | first=Charles | year=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "openness" and customization of the product design, upgradeable products, flexible product platforms, mutability and waste-free strategies are being implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sas.com/content/dam/SAS/en_us/doc/whitepaper2/emerging-green-intelligence-104141.pdf | title=Business Analytics and Corporate Sustainability | publisher=BusinessWeek Research Services | year=2009 | page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in this latest stage, new employee skills and managerial knowledge, as well as essential mass customization mindset are yet to be produced, maintained and renewed. Eliminating non-value added resources is still necessary. Integrating production system elements and work functions still needs time to evolve.

It is appropriate to notice that six-management-system evolution is progressing in an accelerated fashion, the periods of stasis are getting shorter and revolutions are occurring faster. Individual management systems are beginning to overlap and their boundaries are getting blurred. An era of continuous change in business models and management systems emerges: the search for competitive advantage (one over the other) becomes relentless, strenuous and resources depleting. Cooperation networks have to merge into larger entities, reducing competition and expanding collaboration. The search for collaborative advantage (for both jointly) will become the new mode of economic behavior.

In [[Sudan]], a '''ghost marriage''' is a [[marriage]] where a deceased [[bridegroom|groom]] is replaced by his brother. The brother serves as a stand in to the [[bride]], and any resulting children are considered children of the deceased spouse. This unusual type of marriage is nearly exclusive to the [[Dinka people|Dinka]] (Jieng), [[Nuer people|Nuer]], and [[Atuot people]] of Southern Sudan although instances of such marriages have also occurred in [[France]]. These tribes overlap in cultural practices, potentially due to the fact that all of these tribes are cattle-herding [[Pastoralism|pastoralists]].

== Nuer People ==
Nuer women do not marry deceased men only to continue the man's [[bloodline]].  In accordance to Nuer tradition, any wealth owned by the woman becomes property of the man after the marriage.  This wealth that is transferred is in the form of cattle, being exchanged from the father's lineage to the mother's lineage. Once this exchange is completed, the male children of that woman who received the cattle can now marry.

Thus, a wealthy woman may marry a deceased man to retain her wealth, instead of giving it up after marrying. Among the Nuer, a ghost marriage is nearly as common as a marriage to a live man.

== Atuot People ==
There was a decline in ghost marriage among the Atuot people in the 1970s, and some sources attributed it to a connection with the cattle trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burton|first=John W.|date=October 1978|title=Ghost Marriage and the Cattle Trade among the Atuot of the Southern Sudan|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/africa/article/ghost-marriage-and-the-cattle-trade-among-the-atuot-of-the-southern-sudan/5459F7F8C57B1AD1DE2A9B26DFB45E4C|journal=Africa|language=en|volume=48|issue=4|pages=398–405|doi=10.2307/1158804|issn=1750-0184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2423">'''Slavery has been forbidden''' in the state of [[Minnesota]] since that state's [[admission to the Union]] in 1858. The second section of the first Article of [[Constitution of Minnesota|the state's constitution]], drafted in 1857, provides that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the State otherwise there is the punishment of crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/library/constitution/pdf/republicanversion.pdf|format=PDF|title=Constitution of the State of Minnesota|website=Mnhs.org|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Colonial period==
{{main|Slavery in New France}}
During early [[History of Wisconsin|European exploration]], the area of present-day Minnesota was part of [[New France]] and, as such, was governed by [[Slavery in New France|its slavery laws]].

==United States territory==
The first legislation against slavery was the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787, which  forbade slavery in the [[Northwest Territory]], which included those parts of Minnesota that are east of the Mississippi. However, territorial laws and practices allowed human bondage to continue in various forms. Territorial governors [[Arthur St. Clair]] and [[Charles Willing Byrd]] supported slavery and did not enforce the ordinance.&lt;ref name="lehman"&gt;{{cite book|title=Slavery in the Upper Mississippi Valley, 1787–1865: A History of Human Bondage in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin|last=Lehman|first=Christopher P.|year=2011|isbn=978-0786458721|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dred Scott===
[[Dred Scott]] and his wife Harriet Scott were purchased as slaves in Missouri by an army officer. In 1837 their master took them with him to [[Fort Snelling]] in what later became Minnesota but was then a part of the [[Wisconsin Territory]] . In 1857, the year before Minnesota became a state, the United States Supreme Court ruled in [[Scott v. Sanford]] that the Scotts' residence in Minnesota did not make them free, and they still had the status of slaves after they returned to Missouri.

'''Hootsuite''' is a social media management platform, created by [[Ryan Holmes]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2009/05/14/hootsuite-for-president-obama-that-is/ "Hootsuite for President, Obama that is"], ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The system’s user interface takes the form of a [[dashboard (web administration)|dashboard]], and supports social network integrations for [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[Instagram]], [[LinkedIn]], [[Google+]] and [[YouTube]].

Additional integrations are available via Hootsuite’s App Directory, including [[Reddit]], [[Storify]], [[Tumblr]], and [[Marketo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://appdirectory.hootsuite.com/ | title=Hootsuite - App Directory | publisher=Hootsuite | accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based in [[Vancouver]], Hootsuite has close to 1,000 staff members located in 13 locations, including [[Toronto]], [[Bucharest]] and [[Mexico City]]. The company has more than 15 million users in over 175 countries.&lt;ref name=Hootsuite /&gt;

==History==
In 2008, Holmes needed a tool to manage multiple social media networks at his digital services agency, Invoke Media.&lt;ref name="webpronews.com"&gt;[http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2009/07/31/twitter-client-hootsuite-20-is-now-available "Ivan Fernandes, MediaCom Global Director, Social Media Technology, interviews Ryan Holmes, CEO of Hootsuite"]. MediaCom.

Mashable. Retrieved March 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The first iteration of this social media management system launched on November 28, 2008 in the form of a Twitter dashboard called BrightKit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.straight.com/article-175315/brightkit-makes-using-multiple-twitter-accounts-easy/ "BrightKit makes using multiple Twitter accounts easy"].

Recognizing that many other individuals and organizations across the world were facing similar problems with managing multiple social accounts, Holmes decided that BrightKit could be the solution for other businesses also looking to organize their own social networks.&lt;ref name="webpronews.com"/&gt; The launch of BrightKit had a very positive reception, thanks to its clean interface and publishing capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mashable.com/2008/12/03/brightkit/ "BrightKit: The Shiniest Twitter Scheduler and Tracker Yet"]. Mashable. Retrieved March 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, Holmes offered a $500 prize for renaming the platform, and used crowdsourced suggestions from the dashboard’s 100,000+ users as contest submissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eesipeo.com/newsletters/43 "What You Should Outsource to Amp Up Efficiency"]. eESI PeopleTalk.

TechVibes. Retrieved March 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and based upon "Owly", the dashboard’s owl logo, as a [[word play]] on the French expression "tout de suite", meaning "right now".

In November 2009, the Hootsuite dashboard expanded its offering to support Facebook and LinkedIn, and the capability to use Twitter Lists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mashable.com/2009/11/24/hootsuite-adds-support-for-facebook-linkedin-and-twitter-lists/ "Hootsuite Adds Support for Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter Lists"]. Mashable. Retrieved March 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, Hootsuite spun off from Invoke Media and launched officially as an independent company, Hootsuite Media, Inc. That same month, Hootsuite received $1.9 million in funding from Hearst Interactive Media, Blumberg Capital, and prominent angel investors Leo Group LLC and Geoff Entress.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/08/hootsuite-raises-1-9-million-for-social-media-dashboard/ "Hootsuite Raises $1.9 Million for Social Media Dashboard"].

In July 2012, an employee informed ''Forbes'' magazine that the company's team consisted of 200 employees at that time.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Forbes]]|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johngreathouse/2012/07/10/hiring-tools-used-by-hyper-growth-companies-pinterest-tumblr-hootsuite-klout-posterous-bitly-and-mashable/|title=Social Hiring Tools Used By Hyper Growth Companies: Pinterest, Tumblr, Hootsuite, Klout, Posterous, Bitly And Mashable|accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Hootsuite acquired Seesmic, a customer relationship management system and competitor.

On August 1, 2013, the company announced that it had raised US$165 million in Series B funding from [[Insight Venture Partners]], followed by [[Accel Partners]] and OMERS—all three will now have a seat on Hootsuite's board. Holmes also said the company was looking to make at least two unnamed acquisitions, in addition to employing 100 overseas employees.&lt;ref name="Inc" /&gt;

In February 2017, Hootsuite announced its acquisition of AdEspresso, a digital advertisement manager, and LiftMetrix, a leading social media analytics company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.straight.com/life/872011/hootsuite-buys-new-york-based-liftmetrix|title=Hootsuite Buys New York-Based LiftMetrix|publisher=The Georgia Straight|first=Charlie|last=Smith|date=February 22, 2017|access-date=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition==
Hootsuite is competing in a marketplace for social media dashboard tools or platforms, where marketers are focused on social media management for their clients' [[Social media marketing#Engagement|web engagement]] activities. Hootsuite's best known competitors include [[Spredfast]] and [[Sprout Social]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hootsuite/competitors |title=Hootsuite Competitors |website=CrunchBase}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the big three dashboards pursues innovation strategies that emulate the most recent feature enhancements of the other two; for example, [[TweetDeck]] launched with a desktop application based on the [[Adobe AIR]] platform, and eventually [[Seesmic]] rolled out its own Desktop version.

Additional competition includes the [[social media]] and [[media monitoring]] niche, such as Mention or Metricool, which offers real-time web and social media monitoring&lt;ref&gt;Patel, Neil.

HubSpot.&lt;/ref&gt; in multiple languages,&lt;ref&gt;[https://hazima.wordpress.com/2015/06/03/six-tools-to-use-to-monitor-mentions-on-blogs-and-social-media/ Six tools to use to monitor mentions on blogs and social media. | Ananza NOTs عنانزه&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and is designed to provide alerts on a desktop and smart devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marketingshared.com/resources/ Resources | Marketing Shared&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Within financial services, companies like [[Gremln]] provide social media publishing tools that help companies meet strict compliance rules.

Other competition in this space includes platforms that appeal to niche segments, such as [[Octopusocial]], which provides a social media marketing platform designed for [[Business-to-business|B2B]] social media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miles|first=Stephanie|title=Oktopost Review – Sophisticated Social Media Marketing|url=http://www.getapp.com/blog/oktopost-review/|publisher=GetApp|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[content marketing]]. In 2015, companies like Tiempy and Everypost arose in Latin America to compete in the same market, bringing easy to understand tools that non-expert users can utilize. CoSchedule is another online marketing calendar that allows users to easily schedule through social media in one simple step, keeping all social and content in one place, providing a "unified workflow."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.twentyoverten.com/whats-the-best-social-media-app-for-your-business/|title=What’s the Best Social Media Scheduling App For Your Business?|website=Twenty Over Ten|language=en|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indians in Kenya''' (also referred to as '''Kenyan Asians''') are citizens and residents of [[Kenya]] with ancestral roots in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Most are found in the major urban areas of [[Nairobi]] and [[Mombasa]], with others living in rural areas.

Significant Indian migration to modern-day Kenya began following the creation of the British [[East Africa Protectorate]] in 1895, which had strong infrastructure links with [[Bombay]] in [[British Raj|British-ruled India]].

==Terminology==
In Kenya, the word ''Asian'' usually refers specifically to people of [[South Asian]] ancestry ([[Pakistan]]is, [[India]]ns, [[Bangladesh]]is and [[Sri Lanka]]ns).&lt;ref&gt;Vandenberg, Paul, ''The African-Asian Divide: Analyzing Institutions and Accumulation in Kenya'', Routledge, 2013, page 227&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[partition of India]], those of South Asian ancestry were referred to as Indians; however after 1947 the term ''Asian'' also started being used.&lt;ref&gt;Sahoo, Ajaya Kumar and Sheffer, Gabriel, ''Diaspora and Identity: Perspectives on South Asian Diaspora'', Routledge, 2006, page 95&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early history===
[[Vasco da Gama]] recorded encountering Indian merchants along the coast of east Africa in the late 15th century. In [[Malindi]] he obtained the service of a [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] speaking sailor to navigate ships across the [[Indian ocean]] to [[Calicut]].&lt;ref&gt;Herzig, Pascale, South Asians in Kenya: Gender, Generation and Changing Identities in Diaspora, LIT Verlag Münster, 2006, page 10&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] soon came to monopolise trade across the Indian ocean and displace the existing [[Arabs|Arab]] commercial dominance in the region. Although this affected India's commerce with East Africa, some Indians succeeded in becoming accountants and bankers for the Portuguese as they had been for the Arabs.&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"&gt;Herzig, Pascale, South Asians in Kenya: Gender, Generation and Changing Identities in Diaspora, LIT Verlag Münster, 2006, page 11&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early part of the 19th century, small numbers of Indian merchants could be found settled across the trading posts of East Africa. Their interests were enhanced when [[Said bin Sultan]] the [[Muscat and Oman|Sultan of Muscat and Oman]], subjected to the emergence of British naval supremacy in the Indian ocean and direct British political support for Indian merchants along the East African coast, adopted a series of favourable policies towards Indians in the region.&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"/&gt;

In 1887 the [[Imperial British East Africa Company|British East Africa Association]] was founded with its base in [[Bombay]]. The following year the Association was given a royal charter, becoming the Imperial British East Africa Company and moving its base to [[Mombasa]]. Although now based in Africa, the company had a strong Indian orientation, employing guards, police officers, clerks and accountants from Bombay.&lt;ref name="autogenerated13"&gt;Herzig, Pascale, South Asians in Kenya: Gender, Generation and Changing Identities in Diaspora, LIT Verlag Münster, 2006, page 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Africa Protectorate===
Significant Indian migration to modern day Kenya began following the creation of the [[East Africa Protectorate]] in 1895. The Protectorate took over the assets and personnel of the Imperial British East Africa Company and hence its Indian orientation. The rupee was instituted as the currency of the Protectorate and the legal system became an extension of Indian law. Among the local Indian ethnic populace, the vast majority of administrative roles were filled by [[Konkani people|Konkani]] [[Goans]], [[Parsis]] and [[Gujaratis]], whilst the ranks of the British officered police and army mainly consisted of [[Punjabis]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated13"/&gt;

Between 1896 and 1901, some 32,000 indentured labourers were recruited from India to construct the [[Uganda railway]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/762515.stm |title=Kenya's Asian heritage on display |publisher=BBC News |date=2000-05-24 |accessdate=2017-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the railway was a remarkable engineering feat; however, approximately 2,500 labourers died during construction (about four deaths for each mile of track laid) and the project was notorious for the [[Tsavo maneaters]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; Once the railway was completed, some of these labourers voluntarily settled in the Protectorate and brought family from India. The railway had opened the interior to trade, and many soon began migrating away from the coastal cities. Over the following years large numbers of Gujaratis and Punjabis migrated freely seeking to utilise new economic possibilities in the Protectorate . These migrants often came with family members or members of the same village or caste.&lt;ref&gt;Herzig, Pascale, South Asians in Kenya: Gender, Generation and Changing Identities in Diaspora, LIT Verlag Münster, 2006, page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Asians settled in the new town of [[Nairobi]], which had been the capital of the British protectorate since 1905. Unlike black Africans, Asians were permitted to reside legally in Nairobi in what was then a burgeoning white settler town.&lt;ref&gt;Hake, Andrew. 1977. African Metropolis: Nairobi’s Self-Help City. London: Sussex University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most significant early pioneers was [[Alibhai Mulla Jeevanjee|A. M. Jeevanjee]]. In 1890 his company A.M. Jeevanjee of [[Karachi]] was awarded the contract to supply labour for the building of the Uganda railway, and he subsequently went on to establish himself as the pre-eminent Asian businessman in the new colony. He established Kenya's first newspaper now known as [[The Standard (Kenya)|The Standard]] in 1901 and was the first non-white to be elected to the Legislative Council in 1910. Such was his success that in 1904 it was estimated that he owned half of Mombassa and the greater part of Nairobi.&lt;ref&gt;Patel, Zarina, Alibhai Mulla Jeevanjee, East African Publishers, 2002, Page 13&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900 the Mombasa Indian Association was established on the initiative of L.M Savle, and with the backing of wealthy businessmen [[Allidina Visram]] and the Jevanjee brothers, and became the first political organisation in the protectorate to represent the interests of Asians.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Howard Schwartz, The Rise and Fall of Philanthropy in East Africa: The Asian Contribution, Routledge, 5 Jul 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Regional branches later emerged, including in Nairobi in 1906 which soon became more influential than the Mombasa association. To co-ordinate the aims of the different branches, the British East Africa Indian Association was formed in 1907, however it soon became representative of only local interests and remained relatively unimportant.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In 1914 the [[Kenya Indian Congress|East African Indian National Congress]] was established in Mombasa and was modelled on the [[Indian National Congress]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; During the [[First World War]] the militant anti-imperialist [[Ghadar Party]] established a branch in East Africa, and attracted support from a number of the Asian community.&lt;ref name="Durrani, Shiraz 1963"&gt;Durrani, Shiraz, Never Be Silent: Publishing and Imperialism 1884-1963, Vita Books, 25 Nov 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The British authorities took a serious view of what they regarded as the Ghadar party's political terrorism, and sentenced a number of members to death for either belonging to the party or possessing seditious material.&lt;ref name="Durrani, Shiraz 1963"/&gt;

===Kenya Colony===
By the early 1920s, there was a sizeable Asian population who demanded a greater role in the developing political life of what became [[Kenya Colony]]. Racial hostilities gradually intensified in the 1920s; however, Indians, who enjoyed significantly greater economic strength than black Africans, had greater bargaining power with the colonial government. As early as 1920, they turned down the offer of two seats on the legislative council as this was not representative of the size of their community. Tensions with Europeans remained high until 1927 when Indians won the right to five seats on the council, compared to eleven reserved for the Europeans. Both parties prevented any African representation.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=September 2018}}

After the [[Second World War]], Asians were found in all occupations in Nairobi and the townships: in business, the police force, bureaucracy, and the professions.&lt;ref&gt;J. Murray-Brown, Kenyatta (London, 1972),  p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Their commercial skills contributed to the economic development and prosperity of Kenya and the rest of East Africa.&lt;ref&gt;A history of the Asians in East Africa (Oxford, 1969), ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1950s saw increased sentiment against the inequalities of colonial rule, and many Asians were at the forefront of the push for increased rights. These included: [[Pio Gama Pinto]] founder of the [[Kenya African National Union]] newspaper, [[Makhan Singh (Kenyan trade unionist)|Makhan Singh]] who is regarded as laying the foundations of Kenyan trade unionism, and [[Achhroo Ram Kapila|A.R. Kapila]] and [[Fitz Remedios Santana de Souza|Fitz de Souza]] renowned in the legal profession for their representation of those accused of [[Mau Mau uprising|Mau Mau]] links.

By 1962, the Asian community had firmly established their dominance within the urban economy.  Despite accounting for only 2 percent of the overall population, they constituted one-third of the population of Nairobi, where their businesses dominated the main street.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Thomas (1996) Migrations and Cultures: A World View, BasicBooks, pp323-328 {{ISBN|0465045898}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to independence Asians owned nearly three quarters of the private non-agricultural assets in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Leys, Colin, Underdevelopment in Kenya: The Political Economy of Neo-Colonialism, 1964-71, London, Heinemann, 1975, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independence==

Kenya achieved independence from Britain in 1963, and thereafter followed a period of volatility in African and Asian relations. Asians, along with Europeans, were given two years to acquire Kenyan citizenship and surrender their [[British subject|British passports]]. Out of approximately 180,000 Asians and 42,000 Europeans in Kenya at the time, fewer than 20,000 had submitted their applications by the deadline.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Rothchild, Racial bargaining in independent Kenya (London, 1973), p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn led to growing animosity and distrust from Africans.They considered  those who failed to take up Kenyan citizenship as being disloyal.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Rothchild, `Citizenship and national integration: the non-African crisis in Kenya', in Studies in race and nations (Center on International Race Relations, University of Denver working papers), 1}3 (1969±70), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Those without Kenyan citizenship soon became subject to increasing discrimination by the ruling government [[Jomo Kenyatta]]. Despite the entrepreneurial success of the community, in 1970, 70% of the economically active Asian population consisted of wage and salary earners, and 30% worked for the civil service. A policy of Africanisation meant many were sacked in favour of black Africans.&lt;ref&gt;Dharam P. Ghai, 'An Economic Survey' in Dharam P. Ghai, ed, Portrait of a Minority: Asians in East Africa, Nairobi, 1965, p.94&lt;/ref&gt; The Kenyan Immigration Act 1967 required Asians to acquire work permits, whilst a Trade Licensing Act passed in the same year limited the areas of the country in which non-Kenyans could engage in trade.&lt;ref&gt;Quest for equality (New Delhi, 1993), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s and early 1970s, faced with a dim future in Africa, many Asians choose to utilise their British passport and settle in the United Kingdom. Consequently, the Asian population in Kenya declined from 179,000 in 1962 to 139,000 in 1969 and to 78,000 in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=edited by Robin|title=The Cambridge survey of world migration|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521444057|page=71|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=YbzsBPuhyggC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA356&amp;dq=1947+%22partition+of+india%22+%22united+provinces%22++muhajir&amp;ots=LjIm19rKU3&amp;sig=nKoDKMWTLUpG4Rka1uYVUyRIPk4#v=onepage&amp;q=muslim&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asian migrants to the United Kingdom settled mainly in [[London]] and [[Leicester]].

==Present day==
Visiting Kenya in the 1970s, the Indo-Trinidadian writer [[V.S. Naipaul]] referring to the inward focus of the Asian community, commented that "the Indian in East Africa brought India with him and kept it inviolate".&lt;ref&gt;Naipaul, S. (1990).India: A million mutinies now London: William Heinemann Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; Those who remained saw a gradual improvement in their legal status, however the Asian community continued to be cautiously inward and self-reliant. Despite varying degrees of acculturation, most have retained their strong Indian ties and traditions, and are a close-knit, [[Endogamy|endogamous]] community.&lt;ref name=Mwakikagile&gt;{{cite book|last=Mwakikagile|first=Godfrey|title=Kenya: identity of a nation|year=2007|publisher=Godfrey Mwakikagile|isbn=0-9802587-9-0|pages=100–102|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=lsqjN-t6mP4C&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[1982 Kenyan coup d'état attempt]] to remove [[Daniel arap Moi|President Moi]], many Asian shops and businesses in Nairobi were attacked and pillaged whilst a number of Asian women were said to have been raped by the rioters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/01/world/a-fearful-reminder-lingers-for-asians-in-kenya.html|title=A fearful reminder lingers for Asians in Kenya|website=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite fears at the time within the community, it did not result in another exodus of Asians from the country.&lt;ref&gt;Herzig, Pascale, South Asians in Kenya: Gender, Generation and Changing Identities in Diaspora, LIT Verlag Münster, 2006, page 26&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 July 2017, the [[Uhuru Kenyatta]] government announced that the Asian community would be officially recognised as the 44th tribe in Kenya recognising the community's contribution to Kenya from the dawn of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nation.co.ke/news/Hindu-officially-becomes-Kenya-s-44th-tribe/1056-4027242-12m5ygj/index.html|title=Kenya's-44th-tribe|website=The Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demography and religion==
The 2009 Kenyan Census recorded 46,782 Kenyan citizens of Asian origin, while Asians without Kenyan citizenship numbered 35,009 individuals.&lt;ref name="Pahcea"&gt;{{cite web|title=Population and Housing Census – Ethnic Affiliation |url=http://www.knbs.or.ke/censusethnic.php |publisher=Kenya National Bureau of Statistics |accessdate=16 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131121153548/http://www.knbs.or.ke/censusethnic.php |archivedate=21 November 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian ethnic groups mostly originate from a few select places in South Asia. The vast majority of Asians trace their ancestry to the regions of [[Gujarat]] and the [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]].&lt;ref&gt;Herzig, Pascale, South Asians in Kenya: Gender, Generation and Changing Identities in Diaspora, LIT Verlag Münster, 2006, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; There are also large numbers who originate from [[Bombay]], [[Odisha]], [[Goa]] and [[Tamil Nadu]].{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=September 2018}}

'''Khalid Muhammad Ishaq ''' (16 August 1926 – 7 February 2004), [[Senior Advocate Supreme Court]], was a [[Pakistan]]i [[jurist]] and scholar of [[law]], [[Islamic studies]] and [[literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/140238|title=KARACHI: Khalid Ishaq remembered|date=22 May 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Muhammad graduated with a degree in [[Arabic]] from [[D. J. Science College]] in 1945. He received the first position in [[Master of Arts|MA]] examinations given by the [[Bombay University]]. Later, he did his [[LLB]] at the SC [[Shahani Law College]].

==Life and career==
Muhammad was born on August 16, 1926 in [[Shikarpur, Pakistan|Shikarpur]], [[Sindh]] to Mohammed Ishaq and Begum Talat Farrukh Ahmed Ishaq. His maternal grandfather was Maulvi Ziauddin Ahmed who was the first Indian to serve as DIG{{Clarify|reason=What is DIG?|date=January 2018}} of Bombay Sind Presidency.

Ishaq's first marriage was to an Italian lady. His second marriage was with Begum Khursheed Ishaq. He has two daughters and two sons. Ishaq started legal practice in 1948. In 1958, when he was only 32 years of age, he was appointed Additional [[Advocate General]] of [[West Pakistan]]. Five years later, he was promoted to [[Advocate General]]. In 1964, Ishaq stepped down from that position and established his own practice. He practiced [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] in the [[High Court of Sindh]] and the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]]. He became president of the High Court Bar Association in 1965. Ishaq died in [[Karachi]] in 2004.

==Scholarship==
Since [[Islam]] was his inspiration, Ishaq's chief interest lay in [[Persian language|Persian]] and Arabic. In 1965, he became the project director of the [[Islamic Research Institute]]. He was a member of the [[Council of Islamic Ideology]] [[Pakistan]] from 1969 to 1972, and again from 1977 to 1980. Ishaq taught at the [[Sindh University]] from 1976 to 1977 as a [[Professor]] of [[Seerut-un-Nabi]]. He also appeared in scores of television programmes which dealt with [[legal]] and [[religious]] problems.

Ishaq had a large collection of commentaries on the [[Quran]]. His private library, until 1999, contained 175,000 volumes, making him the owner of one of the biggest collection of books in [[Pakistan]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Many institutions requested that he donate his collection but he refused to part with his books. The books were donated to [[Lahore University of Management Sciences]] (LUMS) in 2005. [[Lahore University of Management Sciences]] (LUMS) has dedicated the first floor of its library as the "Khalid Ishaq Wing" in recognition of the massive donation of books.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.lums.edu.pk/atl_collections.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Students and associates==
Men and women from Ishap's chambers have become leading jurists in their own right. Among his associates who were elevated to the superior judiciary were Justice Abdul Qadir Sheikh, Justice Amir Raza, Justice [[Nasir Aslam Zahid]], Justice [[Majida Rizvi]], the late Justice [[Nizam Ahmed]], Justice [[Sabihuddin Ahmed]], Justice [[Ghulam Nabi Soomro]], Justice [[Mujeebullah Siddiqui]], Justice [[Amir Hani Muslim]] and Justice [[Mushtaq Memon]].

Many students cite Khalid Ishaq as their mentor, teacher and colleague, including Abdul Hafeez Lakho, Muneer Malik, Shehenshah Hussain, Ahsan Zaheer Rizvi, Khalid Ibrahim, Abdul G. Soomro, Abid Zuberi, Faisal Kamal Alam, Arshad Hussain Khan, Ghulam Sarwar Jenjer, Muhammad Ehsan, Sohail Jabbar Malik and Khalid Ishaq's son, Sohaib Khalid Ishaq. [[Khalida Ghous]] did her [[Ph.D.]] thesis under his supervision.

An important feature of his life was the weekly meeting of 20 to 30 people at his home every Sunday from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM. These meetings, which were held for almost 40 years and terminated only a few weeks before his death, were a kind of intellectual forum where the current issues were discussed freely. Among the regular participants were the journalists, Salahuddin, the editor of weekly ''Takbir'', Major Ibn ul-Hasan, a columnist of that time and Nusrat Mirza, educators Abd ul-Qadeer Saleem, Molana Amir Usmani and Molan Tasin and businessmen Riaz Shafi, and Saeed Ahmad of Anchor Shipping. Iqbal Shah DSP (r), a renowned Sind police officer unfairly{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} retired in Ayub Khan's martial law who was considered by Ishaq to be an expert in Allama Iqbal' s writings, attended these meetings as well.

'''Kiran Maqsood Baluch''' (born 23 February 1978) is a [[Pakistan national women's cricket team|Pakistani]] [[Women's cricket|woman cricketer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/54989.html | title = Kiran Baluch| publisher = Cricinfo| accessdate = 2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making her debut in January 1997, she went on to play 40 [[Women's One Day International cricket|One Day Internationals]]  (ODIs) and 3 [[Women's Test cricket|Test matches]] for Pakistan. Her 242 against the West Indies in 2004 is the highest individual score in [[Women's Test cricket]].

==Early life and introduction to cricket==
Born as the eldest child of her family, Baluch started playing cricket at a young age. As a child, she also played [[basketball]] and [[badminton]] since her school did not have facilities for women to play cricket.&lt;ref name=Samiuddin&gt;{{cite web|last1=Samiuddin|first1=Osman|title=Pakistan's record-breaking lady|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/140747.html|publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]]|date=8 May 2004|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was a professional cricketer who played in tournaments like the [[Quaid-e-Azam Trophy]] and for teams like [[Pakistan Television cricket team|Pakistan Television]] and [[Pakistan International Airlines cricket team|Pakistan International Airlines]]. He used to teach her bowling, and Baluch played regularly with her father and her youngest brother.&lt;ref name=Samiuddin /&gt;

==Entry into the national team==
In October 1996, the [[Pakistan Women's Cricket Control Association]] headed by [[Shaiza Khan]] was on look out for players on a trial basis to build a team that was set to tour Australia and New Zealand. Baluch was approached by Khan to be a part of the team.&lt;ref name=Samiuddin /&gt; Until 1997, Baluch did not play any competitive cricket. Her first major tournament was the Fatima Jinnah Trophy, an annual domestic tournament in Pakistan. Following that, she was selected in the national side that toured Australia and New Zealand in 1997 to play three ODIs and a few domestic games.&lt;ref name=Samiuddin /&gt; Baluch represented Pakistan women's cricket team in their first ever ODI match, played against New Zealand in January 1997. Pakistan was bowled out for 56 runs, with Baluch being the top-scorer with 19 runs. Pakistan lost the match by 10 wickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pakistan Women in New Zealand Women's ODI Series – 1st Women's ODI|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/67094.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next game she was out for a duck. Her poor performance continued in the subsequent series' in Australia and India. During the season, in one of the matches played against [[Denmark women's cricket team|Denmark]] in India, she picked up 2 wickets for 13 runs, which remain her [[Bowling analysis|best ODI bowling figures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistics / Statsguru / Kiran Baluch / Women's One-Day Internationals|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/54989.html?class=9;template=results;type=bowling;view=series|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baluch was then picked for the Test squad that toured Sri Lanka in 1998. The Pakistan women's cricket team played its first ever Test match in the series. Playing in her first Test match, Baluch made top-scored for her team with 76 in the first innings. However, the hosts won the match by 309 runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pakistan Women in Sri Lanka Women's Test Match|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/67505.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her next match against [[Ireland women's cricket team|Ireland]] in 2000 she was out for a duck. The team then played against the West Indies in a home series in 2004. In the only Test match of the series, she made 242 runs in the first innings. The total is highest individual score by a player in [[Women's Test cricket]] as of 2014.{{efn|Baluch surpassed the previous record of 214 made by India's [[Mithali Raj]].&lt;ref name=Cricinfo1&gt;{{cite web|author1=Wisden Cricinfo staff|title=Pakistan draw despite heroics from Baluch and Shaiza|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/women/content/story/134251.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Records / Women's Test matches / Batting records / Most runs in an innings|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/women/content/records/284261.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her knock of 242 is the highest ever test innings by an opening batswoman in a test innings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/284240.html|title=Records {{!}} Women's Test matches {{!}} Batting records {{!}} Most runs in an innings (by batting position) {{!}} ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also achieved her career-best Test bowling performance in the third innings of the match when she took 2 wickets for 41 runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistics / Statsguru / Kiran Baluch / Women's Test matches /  all-round analysis|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/54989.html?class=8;template=results;type=allround;view=match|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of languages spoken in [[Maldives]].{{Weasel inline|date=December 2017}}

==Dhivehi==
The official and common language is [[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]]. The first known script used to write Dhivehi is [[Eveyla akuru]] script which is found in historical recording of kings (Raadhavalhi). Later a script called [[Dhives akuru]] was used for a long period. The present-day script is called [[Thaana]] and is written from right to left. Thaana is said to have been introduced by the reign of [[Muhammad Thakurufaanu Al Auzam|Mohamed Thakurufaanu]]. Dhivehi, an Indo-Aryan language having some similarities with [[Elu]], the ancient [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]] language, and is written in a specialized Arabic script ([[Tāna]]). The Dhivehi language is spoken by virtually the whole population.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Arabic==
[[Arabic]] (عربي) is the religious language of Muslims as well as the language of the [[Quran]] and [[Sunnah]]. Arabic is taught as a religious language in [[mosque]]s and [[school]]s. Most of the population has some formal or informal education in the reading, writing and pronunciation of the Arabic language, as part of their religious education.

==English==
[[English language|English]] is widely spoken&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; by the locals of Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maldives.tourism-srilanka.com/travel-tips/language.html|title=Maldives Languages - Languages of Maldives - Language Spoken In Maldives|website=maldives.tourism-srilanka.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose, IBBETSON, Maclagan&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Mohils are believed to have been, like the Qiyam Kjanis, converts from the Mohil branch of the Chauhan Rajputs; this is mentioned in inscriptions and [[Rajasthani people|Rajasthani]] kyat literature. Mohils were called by the name of their ancestor, Mohil, to distinguish them from others. Reference to this can be found in an inscription of his son, [[Rana (title)|Rana]] Hathad or Hardatt, dated v.s 1162 (A.D.1105) According to bardic sources such as the khyat of Muhnot Nainsi, Hathad was fifth in the line of the ruling family of [[Eastern Ganga Dynasty|Ganga]] or Dhandha through the latter's son [[Indra]], while another bardic account make the Mohils descendants of Vachhra or Kanha, both sons of Ganga.
&lt;ref&gt;Director (Muslim Epigraphy), Archaeological Survey of India, Nagpur.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==

The Mohil Chauhans possibly ruled over the Chhapar-Dronapur, Ladnun parganas, which are near modern Gopalpur in the [[Churu]] District of [[Rajasthan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=YjGxTYebM5CYvAOdtdSRBw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=AZIMAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=mohil+rajputs&amp;q=mohil Mediaeval history of Rajasthan – Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mediaeval history of Rajasthan, Volume 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion to Islam==

According to local tradition, the ruler of Ladaun region, [[Raja|Rao]] Jai Singh, was once watching a group of women passing through the town gate to fetch water. A menacing bull blocked the road. One of the women, who was a [[Muslim]], took the bull in hand and pushed it out of the way. The Rao was greatly impressed by the woman's show of courage and valour. Thinking that the offspring of such a brave woman would be as brave, the Raja formally proposed marriage with her to her father. The girl gave her consent on the condition that the Raja became a Muslim. The Raja converted, whereupon the marriage was solemnised. Later, the girl discovered the Raja had not given up his faith, but merely pretended to have become a Muslim and was regularly visiting [[temple]]s. She sent a message to the [[Delhi]] Sultan, who invaded Ladnun, defeated the [[Raja]], and forced him to convert to [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nKJiBUFrmfoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA122&amp;dq=mohil+rajputs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ESqxTZaKDoPEvgOO-JWJBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=mohil%20rajputs&amp;f=false Cultural contours of India: Dr ... – Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cultural contours of India: Dr. Satya Prakash felicitation volume By Satya Prakash, Vijai Shankar Śrivastava&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mongolian Sign Language''' ({{lang-mn|Монгол дохионы хэл, Mongol dokhiony khel}}) is a [[sign language]] used in [[Mongolia]]. ''[[Ethnologue]]'' estimates that there were between 10,000 and 147,000 deaf people in Mongolia {{asof|1998|lc=on}}; however, it is not known how many of those are users of MSL.&lt;ref&gt;{{e18|msr}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mongolian Sign Language is widely spoken in areas where Mongolian diaspora have immigrated.  Such locations involve California, Houston, and Charleston.  

Linda Ball, a [[Peace Corps]] volunteer in Mongolia, is believed to have created the first dictionary of MSL in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peace Corps Times|1995|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, another MSL dictionary with 3,000 entries was published by Mongolia's Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science with assistance from [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Torigoe|2008|p=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moscow Cathedral Mosque''' ({{lang-ru| Московская соборная мечеть}}, ''Moskovskaya sobornaya mechet'') is the [[Jama Masjid|main mosque]] of [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. It is located on [[Olimpiysky Avenue (Moscow)|Olimpiysky Avenue]], close to the [[Olympic Stadium (Moscow)|Olympic Stadium]] in the centre of the city.

== History ==
The original structure was built in 1904 according to the design of the architect [[Nikolay Zhukov]] and has undergone some reconstructions since then. It was also sometimes called "Tatar Mosque" because its congregation consisted mainly of ethnic [[Tatars]]. Socially, the Moscow Congregational Mosque was often viewed as the central mosque in Russia. It was one of the four mosques in Moscow.

The old mosque was demolished on 11 September 2011.  The decision to demolish it was controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Krainova |first=Natalya|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/historic-mosque-demolished-on-911-anniversary/443617.html|title=Historic Mosque Demolished on 9/11 Anniversary|work=The Moscow Times|date=13 September 2011|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, the mosque was recognized as an object of cultural heritage, however, in the end of 2008 it was removed from  the list of historical and architectural monuments. Thus, at the time of demolition, it was not protected.&lt;ref name="echo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://echo.msk.ru/programs/kulshok/812423-echo/|script-title=ru:Зачем снесли Соборную мечеть?|date=17 September 2011|publisher=Echo of Moscow|language=ru|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were plans to reconstruct the mosque, and the reconstruction project was designed by architect [[Ilyas Tazhiyev]]. One of the reasons for reconstruction was that the building deviated by several degrees from the direction to [[Mecca]]. The project included disassembling the mosque, collecting all the stones, and re-assembling it again with corrected orientation. In 2009, however, the [[Russian Council of Muftis|Council of Muftis]] dismissed Tazhiyev, first claiming they will make another reconstruction project, and then demolishing the building claiming it was close to collapse.&lt;ref name="echo"/&gt; Tazhiyev stated after the demolition that the reconstruction was still possible, and the building was not close to collapse.&lt;ref name="echo"/&gt;

The Moscow Cathedral Mosque became the first demolished religious building in Moscow since 1978.&lt;ref name="echo"/&gt;

==New mosque==
A new mosque has been built at the site of the former one. It was officially inaugurated on 23 September 2015. The new mosque has the capacity of ten thousand worshippers. Presidents [[Vladimir Putin]] of Russia, [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] of Turkey and [[Mahmoud Abbas]] of the Palestinian Territories together with local Muslim leaders participated in the inauguration ceremony of this mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.shabestan.ir/detail/News/35834|title=Central mosque of Moscow will be inaugurated in 23rd September|publisher= Shabestan News Agency|date=19 September 2015|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Marriage Law''' (also '''First Marriage Law''', {{zh|c=新婚姻法|p=Xīn Hūnyīn Fă}}) was a [[civil marriage]] law passed in the [[People's Republic of China]] on May 1, 1950. It was a radical change from existing patriarchal [[Chinese marriage]] traditions, and needed constant support from [[propaganda]] campaigns. It has since been superseded by the Second Marriage Law of 1980.

==Origins==
Marriage reform was one of the first priorities of the [[People's Republic of China]] when it was established in 1949.&lt;ref name="prog"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/English/e2001/e200103/hunyin.htm|title=Marriage Law Revisions Reflect Social Progress in China|publisher=[[China Today]]|first=Xinxin|last=Chen|date=March 2001|accessdate=2010-08-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629155714/http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/English/e2001/e200103/hunyin.htm|archivedate=2010-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Women's rights]] were a personal interest of [[Mao Zedong]] (as indicated by his statement: "Women hold up half the sky"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=ftv7ks-Ehq0C&amp;pg=PA558&amp;lpg=PA558&amp;dq=Mao+Zedong+Woman+hold+up+half+the+sky&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-1yWJWMidt&amp;sig=V9WSXhk-1KGDIY-qoKff9qwYgrg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBDgKahUKEwinobXigprJAhVIi5QKHW54AWE#v=onepage&amp;q=Mao+Zedong+Woman+hold+up+half+the+sky&amp;f=false|title=The Writings of Mao Zedong, 1949-1976: January 1956-December 1957|first=Zedong|last=Mao|date=1 January 1992|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had been a concern of [[Chinese intellectualism|Chinese intellectuals]] since the [[New Culture Movement]] in the 1910s and 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women in World History: Readings from 1500 to the present|first=Sarah|last=Hughes|first2=Brady|last2=Hughes|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=1997|isbn=978-1-56324-313-4|page=236|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X_gx6DcbHx4C&amp;pg=PA236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, [[Chinese marriage]] had often been [[arranged marriage|arranged]] or [[forced marriage|forced]], [[concubinage]] was commonplace, and women could not seek a [[divorce]].&lt;ref name="prog"/&gt;

==Implementation==
The new marriage law was enacted in May 1950, delivered by Mao Zedong himself.&lt;ref name="prog"/&gt; It provided a [[civil registry]] for legal marriages, raised the marriageable age to 20 for males and 18 for females, and banned marriage by proxy; both parties had to consent to a marriage. It immediately became an essential part of [[land reform]] as women in rural communities stopped being sold to [[landlord]]s. The official slogan was "Men and women are equal; everyone is worth his (or her) salt".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=The Developing Economies|volume=48|number=2|date=June 2010|page=B5|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|first=Noboro|last=Niida|title=Land Reform and New Marriage Law in China|url=http://www.ide.go.jp/English/Publish/Periodicals/De/pdf/64_01_01.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403010912/http://www.ide.go.jp/English/Publish/Periodicals/De/pdf/64_01_01.pdf|archivedate=2012-04-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of yearly [[Propaganda in the People's Republic of China|propaganda campaigns]] from 1950 to 1955 to popularize the law, more than 90% of marriages in China were registered, and thereby were considered to be compliant with the New Marriage Law. Nonetheless, Women's Federation reports indicated instances of violence when women attempted to exercise the rights to divorce granted to them by the law: the Shaanxi Women's Federation, for example, counted 195 instances of death related to marriage cases by the end of 1950 in that province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Gender of Memory: Rural Women in China's Collective Past|last=Hershatter|first=Gail|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a method of implementation, the Women's Federation promoted and organized "Marriage Law Month" in 1953, as an attempt to dampen the conflict which followed the law's passing. Songs and operas were performed to show the downfall of the "old ways".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Gender of Memory: Rural Women in China's Collective Past|last=Hershatter|first=Gail|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=110-113}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Effect on marriage registration ==
The New Marriage Law that was established also had a new effect on the registration system that existed in China. The law provided equality not only for women, but also warranted partners to have free choice in terms of marriage.{{citationneeded|date=June 2017}} Under the new law, the system allowed officials to reject marriages that were found to be forced; such as [[human trafficking]], children and infants, and those forced by patriarchs. The couple who married would be the only authorized party to register. The system would help build a new expectation for marriages by allowing citizens to play a role in setting healthy standards and helping to build a new society that would be very different from the past.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;NIIDA, N. (1964), LAND REFORM AND NEW MARRIAGE LAW IN CHINA. The Developing Economies, p.6-10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
China's divorce rate, though lower than in the [[Western world|Western countries]], is increasing. Chinese women also have increased financial importance in the household.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V118/N57/wan.57c.html|publisher=[[The Tech (newspaper)|The Tech]]|title=China's Divorce Problem|author=Wan, Elaine Y.|issue=57|volume=118|date=1998-09-10|accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is historical debate over the effectiveness of the New Marriage Law in terms of the state's commitment to the policy and therefore its success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Gender of Memory: Rural Women in China's Collective Past|last=Hershatter|first=Gail|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=96-129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some contemporary critics argue that the New Marriage Law has made the nature of marriage in China more [[Economic materialism|materialistic]].&lt;ref name="money"/&gt;{{vc|date=April 2018}}

==Second Marriage Law==
The New Marriage Law was updated in 1980 by the [[Second Marriage Law]], which liberalized divorce,&lt;ref name="money"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2010-08/04/content_11091992.htm|title=For love or money|first=Chihua|last=Wen|publisher=[[China Daily]]|date=2010-08-04|accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the [[one-child policy]] and instructed the courts to favor the interests of women and children in property distribution in [[divorce]]. Further updates in 1983 legalized marriage with foreigners and [[interracial marriage]].&lt;ref name="prog"/&gt; It was amended in 2003 to outlaw married persons' [[cohabitation]] with a third party, aimed at curbing a resurgence of concubinage in big cities.&lt;ref name="money"/&gt;

A '''protest''' (also called a '''remonstrance''', '''remonstration''' or '''demonstration''') is an expression of bearing witness on behalf of an express cause by words or actions with regard to particular events, policies or situations. Protests can take many different forms, from individual statements to mass [[Demonstration (protest)|demonstrations]]. Protesters may organize a protest as a way of publicly making their opinions heard in an attempt to influence [[public opinion]] or government policy, or they may undertake [[direct action]] in an attempt to directly enact desired changes themselves.&lt;ref&gt;St. John Barned-Smith, "How We Rage: This Is Not Your Parents' Protest," ''Current'' (Winter 2007): 17–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Where protests are part of a systematic and peaceful [[nonviolent]] campaign to achieve a particular objective, and involve the use of pressure as well as persuasion, they go beyond mere protest and may be better described as cases of [[civil resistance]] or [[nonviolent resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]], Introduction, in Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present''], Oxford University Press, 2009, pp. 2–3, where a more comprehensive definition of "civil resistance" may be found.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various forms of self-expression and protest are sometimes restricted by governmental policy (such as the requirement of [[protest permit]]s),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Controlling+public+protest%3a+First+Amendment+implications.-a016473804 | title = Controlling Public Protest: First Amendment Implications | accessdate = 16 December 2009 | author = Daniel L. Schofield, S.J.D. | date=November 1994 | publisher= in the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]'s ''[[FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin|Law Enforcement Bulletin]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; economic circumstances, religious orthodoxy, social structures, or media monopoly. One state reaction to protests is the use of [[riot police]]. Observers have noted an increased [[Militarization of police|militarization of protest policing]], with police deploying armored vehicles and snipers against the protesters. When such restrictions occur, protests may assume the form of open [[civil disobedience]], more subtle forms of resistance against the restrictions, or may spill over into other areas such as culture and emigration.

A protest itself may at times be the subject of a [[counter-protest]]. In such a case, counter-protesters demonstrate their support for the person, policy, action, etc. that is the subject of the original protest. In some cases, these protesters can violently clash.

==Forms==
{{see also|Repertoire of contention}}
A protest can take many forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kruszewski|first1=Brent Baldwin, Jackie|title=Why They Keep Fighting: Richmond Protesters Explain Their Resistance to Trump's America|url=http://www.styleweekly.com/richmond/why-they-keep-fighting-richmond-protesters-explain-their-resistance-to-trumps-america/Content?oid=2846422|website=Style Weekly|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dynamics of Collective Action project and the Global Nonviolent Action Database&lt;ref&gt;[http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/ Global Nonviolent Action Database]&lt;/ref&gt; are two of the leading data collection efforts attempting to capture protest events. The&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/group/collectiveaction/cgi-bin/drupal/node/3 Dynamics of Collective Action Project]&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamics of Collective Action project considers the repertoire of protest tactics (and their definitions) to include:

* '''Rally''' or '''demonstration''': Demonstration, rally, etc. without reference to marching or walking in a picket line or standing in a vigil.  Reference to speeches, speakers, singing, preaching, often verified by indication of sound equipment of PA and sometimes by a platform or stage.  Ordinarily will include worship services, speeches, briefings.
* '''March''': Reference to moving from one location to another; to be distinguished from rotating or walking in a circle with picket signs which by definition, constitutes a picket.  
* '''Vigil''': These are almost always designated as such, although sometimes "silent witness," and "meditation" are code words; also see candlelight vigil; hunger/fasting vigil; If you find no designations re: vigils, meditations, silent witness, etc., but also no reference to sound systems or to marches, it may well be a vigil.  Most vigils have banners, placards, or leaflets so that people passing by, despite silence from participants, can ascertain for what the vigil stands.
* '''Picket''': The modal activity is picketing; there may be references to picket line, to informational picketing; holding signs; "carrying signs and walking around in a circle". Holding signs or placards or banners is not the defining criteria; rather, it is holding or carrying those items and walking  a circular route, a phrase sometimes surprisingly found in the permit application.
* '''Civil disobedience''': Explicit protest that involves crossing barricade, sit-in of blacks where prohibited, use of "colored" bathrooms, voter registration drives, crossing barricades, tying up phone lines.
* '''Ceremony''': These celebrate or protest status transitions ranging from birth, death dates of individuals, organizations or nations, seasons, to re-enlistment or commissioning of military personnel, to the anniversaries of same. These are sometimes referenced by presenting flowers or wreaths commemorating or dedicating or celebrating status transitions or its anniversary; e.g., annual Merchant Marine memorial service; celebrate Chanukah, Easter, birthday of Martin Luther King Jr.);
* '''Dramaturgical demonstration'''
* '''Motorcade''': (Electoral campaign and other issues)
* '''Information distribution''': tabling/ petition gathering, lobbying, letter-writing campaign, teach-ins.
* '''Symbolic display''': e.g. Menorah, Creche Scene, graffiti, cross burnings, signs, standing displays
* '''Attack''' by instigators Ethnic group victim of physical attack, by collective group (not-one-on-one assault, crime, rape). Boundary motivating attack is "other group's identity," as in gay-bashing, lynching. Can also include verbal attack and/or threats, too.
* '''Riot, melee, mob violence''': Large-scale (50+), use of violence by instigators against persons, property, police, or buildings separately or in combination, lasting several hours.
* '''Strike, slow down and sick-ins employee work protest of any kind''': Regular air strike through failure of negotiations, or wildcat air strike. (Make note if a wildcat strike.)
* '''Boycott''': Organized refusal to buy or use a product or service, rent strikes.
* '''Press conference''': If specifically named as such in report, and must be the predominant activity form. Could involve disclosure of information to "educate the public" or influence various decision-makers.
* '''Organization formation announcement''' or '''meeting announcement''': meeting or press conference to announce the formation of a new organization.
* '''Conflict, attack or clash, no instigator''': This includes any boundary conflict in which no instigator can be identified, i.e. black/white conflicts, abortion/anti-abortion conflicts.
* '''Lawsuit''': legal maneuver by social movement organization or group

The Global Nonviolent Action database uses Gene Sharp's classification of 198 methods of nonviolent action. There is considerable overlap with the Dynamics of Collective Action repertoire, although the GNA repertoire includes more specific tactics. Together, the two projects help define tactics available to protesters and document instances of their use.

==Typology==
[[File:Manifestació 27 d'agost.jpg|thumb|right|200px|March next to the [[Benito Juárez Hemicycle]]; 27 August 1968. Mexico City.]]
Abhishek Tiwari (8-B) and Lori Hall&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Practicing the Art of Dissent: Toward a Typology of Protest Activity in the United States|last = Ratliff|first = Thomas|year = 2014|journal = Humanity &amp; Science |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=268–294}}&lt;/ref&gt; have devised a typology of six broad activity categories of the protest activities described in the Dynamics of Collective Action project.
* '''Literal, symbolic, aesthetic and sensory''' - Artistic, dramaturgical, and symbolic displays (street theater, dancing, etc.). Use of images, objects, graphic arts, musical performances, or vocal/auditory exhibitions (speechmaking, chanting, etc.). Tactile exchanges of information (petitions, leaflets, etc.) and the destruction of objects of symbolic and/or political value. Highly visible and most diverse category of activity; impacts on society (police response, media focus, impact on potential allies, etc.) often are underestimated.
* '''Solemnity and the sacred''' – Vigils, prayer, rallies in format of religious service, candlelighting, cross carrying, etc., all directly related to Durkheimian ''sacred'' or some form of religious or spiritual practice, belief, or ideology. Events where sacred activity is the primary focus are rarely responded to by police with force or presence. Solemnity usually provides a distinct quietness or stillness, changing the energy, description, and interpretation of such events
* '''Institutional and conventional''' – Institutionalized activity or activity highly dependent on formal political processes and social institutions (press conferences, lawsuits, lobbying, etc.). Often conflated with non-confrontational and nonviolent activities in research as the ''other'' or reference category. More ''acceptable'' because it operates, to some degree, within the system. Historically contentious issue in regard to the practice of protest due to this integration within the system.
* '''Movement in space''' – Marches or parades (processional activities) from one spatio-temporal location to another, with beginning or ending places sometimes chosen for symbolic reasons. Picket lines often used in labor strikes but can be used by nonlabor actors but the key differences between picket and processionals are the distance of movement. Events that take the form of a procession are logistically much more difficult to police (even if it is for the safety of protesters). Marches are some of the largest events in this period.
* '''Civil disobedience''' – Withholding obligations, sit-ins, blockades, occupations, bannering, ''camping,'' etc., are all specific activities which constitute the tactical form of civil disobedience. In some way, these activities directly or technically break the law. Usually given most attention by researchers, media, and authorities. Often conflated with violence and threats because of direct action and confrontational nature but should serve as a distinct category of action (both in the context of tactical/ strategic planning and in the control of activity).
* '''Collective violence and threats''' – Collective violence such as pushing, shoving, hitting, punching, damaging property, throwing objects, verbal threats, etc., is usually committed by a relative few out of many protesters (even tens of thousands). Rare in occurrence, rarely condoned by the public or onlookers (particularly the media). Usually met with equivalent or overwhelming force in response to authorities. At times in U.S. history lauded as the only way to get results, but little empirical evidence violence succeeds in goal attainment.

Some forms of [[direct action]] listed in this article are also [[Demonstration (people)|public demonstrations]] or rallies.
* [[Demonstration (people)|Protest march]], a historically and geographically common form of [[nonviolent]] action by groups of people.
* [[Picketing (protest)|Picketing]], a form of protest in which people congregate outside a place of work or location where an event is taking place. Often, this is done in an attempt to dissuade others from going in ("crossing the picket line"), but it can also be done to draw public attention to a cause.
* [[Street protester]]s demonstrate in areas with high visibility, often employing handmade [[wikt:placard|placards]] such as [[sandwich board]]s or picket signs in order to maximize exposure and interaction with the public.
* [[Lockdown]]s and [[Lock-on (protest tactic)|lock-on]]s are a way to stop movement of an object, like a structure or tree and to thwart movement of actual protesters from the location. Users employ various chains, locks and even the [[sleeping dragon (manoeuver)|sleeping dragon]] for impairment of those trying to remove them with a matrix of composted materials.
* [[Die-in]]s are a form of protest where participants simulate being dead (with varying degrees of realism). In the simplest form of a die-in, protesters simply lie down on the ground and pretend to be dead, sometimes covering themselves with signs or banners. Much of the effectiveness depends on the posture of the protesters, for when not properly executed, the protest might look more like a "sleep-in". For added realism, simulated wounds are sometimes painted on the bodies, or (usually "bloody") bandages are used.
* [[Protest song]] is a song which protests perceived problems in society. Every major movement in Western history has been accompanied by its own collection of protest songs, from slave [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]] to women's [[suffrage]], the [[labor movement]], [[civil rights]], the anti-war movement, the [[feminist]] movement, the environmental movement. Over time, the songs have come to protest more abstract, moral issues, such as [[injustice]], [[racial discrimination]], the morality of war in general (as opposed to purely protesting individual wars), [[globalization]], inflation, [[social inequalities]], and [[incarceration]].
* [[Radical cheerleading]]. The idea is to ironically reappropriate the aesthetics of cheerleading, for example by changing the [[chant]]s to promote [[feminism]] and left-wing causes. Many radical cheerleaders (some of whom are male, [[transgender]] or non-gender identified) are in appearance far from the stereotypical image of a cheerleader.
* &lt;!-- -Copied from Critical Mass wikipedia page April 2009- --&gt; [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] bike rides have been perceived as protest activities. A 2006 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' magazine article described Critical Mass' activity in New York City as "monthly political-protest rides", and characterized Critical Mass as a part of a [[social movement]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Holy Rollers | first=Ben | last=Mcgrath | date=13 November 2006 | url=http://www.newyorker.com/printables/fact/061113fa_fact}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the UK [[e-zine]] [[Urban75]], which advertises as well as publishes photographs of the Critical Mass event in London, describes this as "the monthly protest by cyclists reclaiming the streets of London."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Critical Mass London | publisher=[[Urban75]] | year=2006 | url=http://www.urban75.org/photos/critical}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Critical Mass participants have insisted that these events should be viewed as "celebrations" and spontaneous gatherings, and not as protests or organized demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Pittsburgh Critical Mass | url=http://pghcriticalmass.org/ | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928023011/http://www.pghcriticalmass.org/ | archivedate=28 September 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Critical Mass: Over 260 Arrested in First Major Protest of RNC | date=30 August 2004 | publisher=Democracy Now! | url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04/08/30/1453256 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114174744/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04%2F08%2F30%2F1453256 | archivedate=14 November 2007 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This stance allows Critical Mass to argue a legal position that its events can occur without advance notification of local police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Critical crackdown | first=Matt | last=Seaton | work =The Guardian| url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,1600570,00.html | location=London | date=26 October 2005 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=[*BCM*] Hong Kong Critical Mass News | first=Adam | last=Rosi-Kessel | date=24 August 2004 | url=http://www.bostoncriticalmass.org/pipermail/bostoncriticalmass/2004-August/000146.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protests can express views, news and use viral networking to reach out to thousands of people. With protests on the rise from the election season of 2016 going into 2017, protestors became aware that using their social media during protest could make them an easier target for government surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/01/use-social-media-protest-without-big-brother-snooping/|title=How to Use Social Media at a Protest Without Big Brother Snooping|last=Newman|first=Lily Hay|newspaper=WIRED|access-date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of 342 US protests covered by ''[[The New York Times]]'' newspaper from 1962 to 1990 showed that such public activities usually affected the company's publicly traded [[stock]] price. The most intriguing aspect of the study's findings revealed that the amount of media coverage the event received was of the most importance to this study. Stock prices fell an average of one-tenth of a percent for every paragraph printed about the event.&lt;ref&gt;[[Deseret Morning News]], 13 November 2007 issue, p. E3, ''Coverage of protests hurts firms, Cornell-Y. study says'', Angie Welling&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Romano-tv''''' (previously '''''Manne-tv''''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-5793811 |title=Manne-tv on nyt Romano-tv |date=July 6, 2007 |website=yle.fi |publisher=[[Yleisradio]] |language=Finnish |access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a twelve-episode sketch-show based on common [[stereotype]]s and misconceptions the Finns have of the domestic [[Romani people|Gypsy]] minority. It ran from June 2 to August 18, 2007 on [[Yle]].

The show was propelled by the excitable performances of Santeri Ahlgren and [[Eeki Mantere]] (who died in April 2007, just before the shooting of the show) as well as through the support of the Finnish celebrity and musician [[Remu Aaltonen]] of [[Hurriganes]] (who himself is a member of the [[Finnish Kale|Finnish Gypsy]] community). The show's builds on the tradition of such extreme low-budget sketch-shows as ''[[Pulttibois]]'' and ''[[Kummeli]]'' by adding a comical effect through a more intentional approach. This is manifested by blooper-shots being shown within the episode rather than at the end of each program.

The show attracted wide criticism when it first aired and up until the 14&lt;small&gt;th&lt;/small&gt; of July the show ran under the title ''Manne-tv'' after which Yleisradio had the name changed to the more neutral ''Romano-tv''. Some groups found the use of the term ''manne'' (a Finnish racial slur referring to gypsies) offensive or inappropriate despite the usage of the term in the show in a tongue-in-cheek connotation. Despite the change in name the fake ''commercial bumpers'' and characters in the show still referred to the show as ''Manne-tv'' even after the official switch.

Despite the controversy the show also enjoyed a slew of popular guest stars.

[[Sexuality]] in [[music video]]s has been evident since the 1980s.  The extent in which stereotypes align with gender portrayal varies each decade.  Music video content has remained culturally relevant and subliminally influential on adolescent character development.  In addition, the intersectionality between race and gender is evident throughout music video history.  By analyzing the correlation between music video material and gender representation, conclusions can be drawn pertaining to how music television impacts young adults' perception of their appropriate societal behavior.

==1980s==
On August 1, 1981, the first 24-hour music video channel aired.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seidman | first1 = S. A. | year = 1992 | title = Profile: An investigation of sex‐role stereotyping in music videos | url = | journal = Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 209–216 | doi=10.1080/08838159209364168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directed towards adolescents, [[MTV]] promoted societal trends through video content and advertisements. The material displayed helped the audience identify appropriate male and female roles, behaviors, and careers.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In the 1980s, typical feminine stereotypes included: submissive, performed household duties, emotional.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Vincent, R. C., Davis, D. K., &amp; Boruszkowski, L. A. (1987). Sexism on MTV: The portrayal of women in rock videos. Journalism Quarterly, 64(4), 750-941.&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrastingly, common male clichés were as follows: dominant, professional occupations, aggressive.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Young adults mainly watched MTV because it was different from other programs, they were intrigued by the unification of visuals and music, and used it as "leisure time entertainment".&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sun | first1 = S. W. | last2 = Lull | first2 = J. | year = 1986 | title = The adolescent audience for music videos and why they watch | url = | journal = Journal of Communication | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 115–125 | doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1986.tb03043.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rolling Stones]], [[AC/DC]], [[Michael Jackson]], and [[Guns N' Roses]] were leading significant figures, displayed on MTV.  Music Television had a commanding influence on its audience and heavily effected the ways adolescents viewed their societal role.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Music videos, released in the 1980s, typically depicted women as alluring objects.  Aligning with typical stereotypes, women were portrayed as attractive, yet submissive.  Although women's talents may be acknowledged, their skill never surpassed the male's—this concept is evident in AC/DC's video for "[[Sink the Pink]]".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  In the Rock n' Roll video, one of the main characters is a self-assured woman, who is a skillful pool player; the woman utilizes her talent and sexuality as an attention getter, but is not shown as more talented than the male characters.

In a study, conducted in 1987, thirty hours of MTV content was analyzed.  The research performed helped draw further conclusions, regarding sexuality in 1980s music videos.  The results suggested: 57% of music videos displayed women being objectified, 17% showed women's talents being accounted for, yet her sexual role was highlighted, 14% did not align with typical stereotypes, 12% acknowledged women's independence.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; In addition to these results, touching was displayed in over 50% of music videos and females were frequently seen in seductive clothing.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

==1990s==
Music remained an essential part of the cultural evolution of the 1990s. The music scene transitioned into the darker and more provocative sounds of the genres of [[alternative rock|alternative]], [[hip-hop]], and [[R&amp;B]]. Popular music videos of the time came from artists such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Aaliyah]], [[Weezer]], and [[RadioHead]]. While the acclaimed artists and genres of the times differed form the previous decade, the visual depictions of this music and how they were delivered to the public remained the same. MTV remained socially relevant in constructing images to correlate to music, helping propel youth culture into the atmosphere of visual experiences. As music videos grew in popularity and cultural prominence, researchers became continually fascinated by the link between gender identities and mass media platforms. Several studies have been conducted regarding gender portrayals in music videos of the 1990s.

In early 1990, MTV created a Program Standards Department which aimed to reject music videos featuring extremely graphic and explicit content. The program sought to prohibit any signs of female nudity and violence directed toward female figures. For example, MTV rejected [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna's]] "[[Justify My Love#Music video|Justify my Love]]" video due to its explicit content. After this program was implemented, a study was conducted to analyze the centrality and depiction of women in the most 100 popular videos of the decade. The study first sorted men and women in the categories of either leading or supporting figures in the videos, discovering that men outnumbered women in lead roles by an astronomical 5 to 1 margin.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Gow, J. (1996). Reconsidering gender roles on MTV: Depictions in the most popular music videos of the early 1990s. Communication reports, 9(2), 151-161.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, the study categorized the lead roles into seven main portrayals (artist, poser, comic, actress, superhuman, dancer, or crowd pleaser). The analysis found that a majority of women in lead roles were portrayed as either posers (35%) or dancers (29%) while men in lead roles were more equally disbursed amongst the seven categories.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Portraying women predominately as dancers or posers implied that, in the 90s, women needed not to display musical talent, but instead physical talent that emphasized a sexual attitude. Meanwhile, the equal disbursement of men amongst the categories suggested that men could better exhibit skills of musical and performing prowess.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

Other studies analyzed 123 music videos from varying genres that aired in the summer of 1995. 44.7% of the videos failed to feature a female in a central role, while 31.7% of the videos portrayed women as conventional, meaning that they served as either objects or sensory props to romantic male desire.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, S. (1999). The gender role paradox in youth culture: An analysis of women in music videos. Michigan Sociological Review, 46-64.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the overt sexual nature of women in these videos was not the only thing analyzed. Gender displays in the form of nonverbal sexual cues were also considered, proving that women could also be depicted more subliminally sexual than men. For example, in the videos only 1.24% of men touched their hair compared to 38.35% of females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wallis | first1 = C | year = 2011 | title = Performing gender: A content analysis of gender display in music videos | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 64 | issue = 3–4| pages = 160–172 | doi=10.1007/s11199-010-9814-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, only .74% of males danced suggestively in their videos compared to 26.80% of females. The study examines the distinction between the prominence and depiction of male and female gender portrayals within the music videos of the 1990s.

==2000s==
[[File:Womanizer Miami.jpg|thumb|Singer [[Britney Spears]] performs in [[The Circus Starring Britney Spears|The Circus tour]] in Miami, 2009]]

Music remained integral to cultural life in the 2000s, while not many new genres were created during this time other than a few indie-related and electronic genres. Teen Pop carried a heavy influence over from the 90s into the first part of the decade. Artists such as Britney spears Christina Aguilera, NSYNC and Backstreet Boys. By the mid 2000s Contemporary R&amp;B had become the most popular genre with artists such as Usher at the forefront.

A study conducted by Jacob Turner in 2008, hypothesized that African American genres of music (hip-hop, rhythm, and blues) would feature the most sexual content in their music videos while White genres (Country and Rock) would feature less. The study found that 73% of all music videos had some sort of sexual content. Further, the study found that 90.09% of mixed Hip-Hop and R&amp;B music videos contained sexual content. Followed by Hip-Hop with 79.7%, R&amp;B with 76.9%. The genres that contained the least amount of sexual content on their music videos were rock with 40.0% and Country with 37.0%. The study also looked into how African American and White wallpaper characters were dressed in music videos. It found that African American wallpaper characters were three times more likely to dress provocatively than White wallpaper characters.The study also found that while African Americans were not underrepresented in music videos. However, the study proposes that this is because videos featuring African Americans featured significantly more sexual content than videos that featured Whites.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Jacob. "Hegemony, Hedonism, and Hip-Hop: An Examination of the Portrayal of Race and Sexuality in Music Videos." Conference Papers -- International Communication Association, 2008 Annual Meeting, pp. 1-26. EBSCOhost, electra.lmu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ufh&amp;AN=36957073&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010s==
Into the 2010s, artists have continued to garner headlines for provocative content in music videos. For example, [[Rihanna|Rihanna's]] music video for the song "[[S&amp;M (song)|S&amp;M]]", in which she simulates sex with a life-sized doll and wears [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] gear, generated much media attention and was banned in 11 countries. [[YouTube]] required its users to verify they were 18 years of age before being able to view the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1657144/rihanna-s-m-video-banned/|title=Rihanna's 'S&amp;M' Video Restricted By YouTube, Banned In 11 Countries|work=MTV News|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director of the video, [[Melina Matsoukas]], responded to the controversy by saying she felt the video was a success because the provocative imagery creating a dialogue around the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1657250/rihannas-sm-video-director-responds-to-controversy/|title=Rihanna's 'S&amp;M' Video Director Responds To Controversy|work=MTV News|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Ariana Grande's "[[Everyday (Ariana Grande song)|Everyday]]" video depicts several couples beginning to have sex in various public places, such as on the bus, was praised for its [[sex positivity]] and inclusion of different races and sexual orientations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.etonline.com/news/211571_ariana_grande_super_racy_everyday_video_will_totally_make_you_blush|title=Ariana Grande's Super Racy 'Everyday' Video Will Totally Make You Blush|work=Entertainment Tonight|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research has looked into the effects that music videos that sexually objectify women have on women's body image perceptions. A study of college students found that young women were more likely to view their body in a negative light after exposure to a sexually-objectifying music video, particularly in women with low self-esteem. The same study found that exposure to sexually objectifying music videos lessened the extremity of young women's conception of an [[ideal body weight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mischner|first=Isabelle|date=January 2013|title=Thinking Big: The Effect of Sexually Objectifying Music Videos  on Bodily Self-Perception in Young Women|url=|journal=Body Image|volume=10|pages=26–34|via=|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2012.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study found a relationship between sexual content in dance music videos and negative attitudes toward sex and sexuality among young adults in the United States and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright , Rubin |first=Chrysalis , Mark |date=2017|title="Get lucky! Sexual content in music lyrics, videos, and social media and sexual cognitions and risk among emerging adults in the USA and Australia"|url=|journal=Sex Education|volume=17|pages=41–56|via=|doi=10.1080/14681811.2016.1242402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have noted that sexualized content in music videos rarely depicts non-heterosexuality. Frederik Dhaenens has pointed out that when music videos to feature gay content, it is oftentimes involves a "heteronormative shaping of gay and lesbian identities", citing [[Macklemore]] and [[Ryan Lewis]]' "[[Same Love]]" as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dhaenens|first=Frederik|date=2016|title=Reading Gay Music Videos: An Inquiry Into the Representation of Sexual Diversity in Contemporary Popular Music Videos|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03007766.2015.1068530|journal=Popular Music and Society|volume=39|pages=532–546|via=|doi=10.1080/03007766.2015.1068530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depictions of race==
Studies have shown that music videos featuring African American characters tend to feature significantly more depictions of sexual acts than videos featuring white characters.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robillard|first=Alyssa|date=2012|title=Music Videos and Sexual Risk in African American Adolescent Girls|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19325037.2012.10599224|journal=American Journal of Health Education|volume=43|pages=93–103|via=|doi=10.1080/19325037.2012.10599224}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, African American women are the most likely group of people to be depicted as engaging in sexual behaviors and wearing provocative clothing. A study in the American Journal of Health Education attributed music videos' "frank sexual messages, objectification, and overtly sexual images" to an apathy toward these behaviors in African American girls, which the journal considered dangerous in light of the heightened HIV risk for African Americans.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; It has been suggested by scholar Jacob Turner that white-run corporations like [[Viacom]] (which owns MTV) are more willingly to pay for music videos from African American artists that perpetuate racial and sexual stereotypes as an explanation for why African Americans videos are disproportionately sexualized compared to white videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turner|first=Jacob|date=2011|title=Sex and the Spectacle of Music Videos: An Examination of the Portrayal of Race and Sexuality in Music Videos|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=ef2d260b-1308-4780-8e09-2b5d3a5a7abd%40sessionmgr4008|journal=Sex Roles|volume=64|pages=173–191|via=|doi=10.1007/s11199-010-9766-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian artists, such as [[BoA]], have been accused of presenting Western stereotypes of Asian female sexuality in their music videos as an attempt to gain popularity in the United States. [[Japan]]'s [[Koda Kumi]] and [[AKB48]] also presents sexuality in their music videos. Male [[K-pop]] star [[Rain (entertainer)|Rain's]] music video for his song "[[Rainism]]" has been credited with helping to refute [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States#Emasculation and asexuality|stereotypes of Asian men as effeminate and weak]] depicting an Asian man in various sexual situations, primarily with white women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jung|first=Eun-Young|date=2010|title=Playing the Race and Sexuality Cards in the Transnational Pop Game: Korean Music Videos for the USA Market|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=6&amp;sid=75ed386c-7ceb-4035-884c-0b80240c7d53%40sessionmgr4007|journal=Journal of Popular Music Studies|volume=22|pages=219–236|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1533-1598.2010.01237.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7045">'''Poverty reduction in Guatemala''' remains as one of the key challenges to be dealt with before a more balanced and socially inclusive [[economic growth]] could be achieved.

==Poverty==

According to figures in 2006, 6.6 million people are still living under [[poverty]] and a third of this figure, or 2 million people, are struggling with [[extreme poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/execbrd/pdf/ADR-Guatemala.pdf. ''Assessment of developmental results.''. UNDP, 2008, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, despite a fall in extreme poverty during the 1990s, [[Guatemala]]’s dependency on [[export]]s and susceptibility to global [[price shock]]s such as the world coffee crisis and [[natural disaster]]s such as the [[Tropical Storm Stan]] in 2005 has led to a subsequent increase of the poverty rate in 2004 and falling again in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/execbrd/pdf/ADR-Guatemala.pdf. ''Assessment of developmental results.''. UNDP, 2008, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding a recent fall in the [[poverty rate]], both external and natural events continue to exert great influence on poverty levels in Guatemala. Consequently, [[poverty alleviation]] work in tandem with [[risk management]] policies in Guatemala.

==Poverty and income inequality==
Ranked with the second highest inequality rate in [[Latin America]], ([[Gini coefficient]] of 0.55),&lt;ref&gt;http://earthtrends.wri.org,''Earth trend country profile''. ., 2008&lt;/ref&gt; many disparities exist between different economic sectors and income groups, reflecting a large rich-poor divide in Guatemala. Further data has shown that only 3.8 percent of the country’s total [[income]] is earned by the poorest 20 percent of the population, compared with the 60.6 percent earned by the richest 20 percent of the population &lt;ref&gt;http://earthtrends.wri.org,''Earth trend country profile''. P.2., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, [[income inequality]] in Guatemala is accentuated by regional differences, namely, 1) a large rural agrarian sector and 2) [[social exclusion]].

===Inequality and Agriculture===

[[Agriculture]] is one of the primary sectors in Guatemala (22.2 percent of GDP), producing principal [[cash crop]]s such as [[coffee]], [[sugar]]s and [[banana]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/execbrd/pdf/ADR-Guatemala.pdf. ''Assessment of developmental results.''. UNDP, 2008, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with other non-agricultural products, they contribute towards 75 percent of export earnings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/execbrd/pdf/ADR-Guatemala.pdf. ''Assessment of developmental results.''. UNDP, 2008, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The agricultural sector employs about 39 percent of the national workforce, resulting in suppressed wages and low productivity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/execbrd/pdf/ADR-Guatemala.pdf. ''Assessment of developmental results.''. UNDP, 2008, P. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; This provides some explanation for the rural-urban dichotomy in living standards. 

This problem is made worse by [[subsistence agriculture]], resulting in low productivity and value-addedness. As a result, meagre incomes push subsistence farmers into poverty. Moreover, a denial of [[access to credit]] for vital agricultural [[investment]] has often led to farmers sinking into a vicious [[poverty cycle]] which continues through generations.&lt;ref&gt;'' Local development through microfinance tools in Central America'', Woodworth and Hiatt, P.99, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Sudden and unexpected events such as natural calamities and adverse climate conditions can also threaten agricultural [[harvest]]s. It is not a matter of coincidence that the [[Rural poverty|rural poor]] often comprised a large portion of populations living within these danger zones. Understandably, the rural poor are not able to gather sufficient resources to mitigate such emergencies, such as insurance against risk. Hence, the occurrence of such events would have recurring effects on rural dwellers, pushing them into greater poverty.

===Inequality and social exclusion===

Poverty appears to be largely concentrated within the regional groupings in Guatemala. To illustrate, comparisons between urban, rural and indigenous, non-indigenous people have shown that the non-indigenous groups fare considerably better than their indigenous contemporaries, inrable on a similar level to the national average of [[Cameroon]],  which ranks 144th on global HDI rankings with a score of 0.0506(HDI).&lt;ref&gt;2006 Human Development report&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of social exclusion, the  Q’eqchi ethnic group’s HDI is relatively lower than the national average of 0.560.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics, http://fita.org/countries/guatemala.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the 38 percent poverty rate experienced by the rural [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] population is almost twice the national average of 21.9 percent and at least 20 percent greater than their urban contemporaries, highlighting a rural-urban divide in terms of development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/execbrd/pdf/ADR-Guatemala.pdf. ''Assessment of developmental results.''. UNDP, 2008, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In sum, the deprivation of the rural poor from opportunities of personal growth and development is a reflection of their disadvantaged economic circumstances. While the urban sector has been reaping relatively higher economic growth, the rural poor have been marginalized, bypassed and socially excluded from full economic participation in the [[Guatemalan economy]].

==Foreign debt==

Lastly, coupled with a high [[foreign debt]] totaling $5,496 millions according to 2006 figures,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/execbrd/pdf/ADR-Guatemala.pdf. ''Assessment of developmental results.''. UNDP, 2008, P. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; the Guatemalan economy became even more depressed with this large sum of foreign debt obligation. This has been supported by various studies that pointed out how a large foreign debt could potentially deplete a country’s [[capital stock]], thereby reducing much-needed investment opportunities vital for economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;International Research Journal of Finance and Economics ISSN 1450-2887 Issue 20, ''External Debt and its Impact on Economic and Business Growth in Pakistan'' Hameed, Ashraf, Chaudhary,2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Research Journal of Finance and Economics ISSN 1450-2887 Issue 20, External Debt and its Impact on Economic and Business Growth in Pakistan Hameed, Ashraf, Chaudhary,2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, the positive impact of economic growth on [[poverty reduction]] should be taken with a word of caution. While there is a positive [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth of 4.5 percent in that same fiscal year in Guatemala,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/execbrd/pdf/ADR-Guatemala.pdf. ''Assessment of developmental results.''. UNDP, 2008, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; it has done little to reduce poverty. With economic growth bearing no absolute causality on poverty reduction, there is a need for the social determinants of poverty to be looked into.

'''The Tanster''' is an American artist in the [[Hamptons]] on the East End of [[Long Island]] in [[New York State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Street Art|url=http://paintingthehamptons.blogspot.com/2015/01/street-art.html|website=Painting the Hamptons|publisher=Gail Gallagher|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began installing public art works in the community in the late Summer of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Reilly|first1=Brendan|title=Another Guerilla Artist Posts Art Across The Hamptons|url=http://www.danspapers.com/2014/10/another-guerilla-artist-posts-art-across-the-hamptons/|issue=10.2.14|publisher=Dan's Papers|date=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her project was named as one the top 10 artistic events in 2014 by the cultural magazine ''[[Dan's Papers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peterson|first1=Oliver|title=Top 10 Hamptons Art Moments of 2014|url=http://www.danspapers.com/2014/12/top-10-hamptons-art-moments-of-2014/|publisher=Dan's Papers|accessdate=December 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tanster has partnered with a local charity, the Coalition For Women's Cancers at [[Southampton Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Segal|first1=Mark|title="Tanster" Pays It Forward For Women's Cancers|url=http://easthamptonstar.com/Arts/2015305/Tanster-Pays-It-Forward-Womens-Cancers|accessdate=March 5, 2015|publisher=The East Hampton Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each piece of pop up art that The Tanster installs includes donation information for the Coalition. People are encouraged to take the art when they find it. On the back of it is a request for donations and a guide on how people can help.&lt;ref name="east1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Melillo|first1=Alyssa|title=They Call Her 'The Tanster,' And She's on a Rainbow-Filled Mission|url=http://www.27east.com/news/article.cfm/East-End/102797/They-Call-Her-The-Tanster-And-Shes-On-A-Rainbow-Filled-Mission|accessdate=April 14, 2015|publisher=Southampton Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tanster has received corporate sponsorships for her project, including contributions from Home Depot, Rust-Oleum and Meineke.&lt;ref name="east1"/&gt;

==Biography==
The Tanster was born in Southampton Hospital in [[Southampton, New York]], United States and attended Southampton High School. She graduated [[Magna Cum Laude]] from [[Stony Brook University]] and has a master's degree in video production from the [[New York Institute of Technology]]. For a year she lived in Paris, France, studying art history at the [[Sorbonne]]. Her photographs have been published in magazines all over the world and her celebrity photography is currently managed by [[Getty Images]]. She began installing pop up public art in the Hamptons in August 2014.&lt;ref name="east1"/&gt;

==Technique==
The primary style of The Tanster public art installations involves repurposed yard signs spray painted in rainbow palettes. Oftentimes the pieces include original stencils. The yard signs which serve as her canvases are typically plastic rectangles. The Tanster creates her works in a studio in Water Mill, New York and then places them out in the public, either mounted on metal frames or stapled with wire to posts. She also paints, tie dyes, sews and makes videos.

==Podcast media==
In February 2016, The Tanster was interviewed on [[iHeart Radio]]'s Savvy Central channel by Christina Nitschmann. During the interview, The Tanster discussed a variety of topics, including both the origins of her charity rainbow street art project and how she became interested in [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBOCpxkHMKk |title=Artist 'The Tanster' &amp; Steve Lubetkin The Power of Podcasting |publisher=YouTube |date=February 21, 2016 |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July of 2018, The Tanster did a wide ranging, two part interview on The Scott Johnson Radio Show on the Building Fortunes Radio Network. The topics covered included her ongoing, multi-media art project which she characterized as a [[Hero's Journey]] partially inspired by [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]]. During the interview, Tanster also discussed her efforts to highlight the statements of Ben Szemkus, an eyewitness whose story links the allegedly sadistic [[NXIVM]] sex cult and certain political elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Scott Johnson Radio Show|url=http://www.buildingfortunesradio.com/scott-johnson-peter-mingils/scott-johnson-bring-the-tanster-on-building-fortunes-radio-to-talk-about-ben-szemkus-and-nxivms-keith-raniere-allison-mack-meeting-with-cohost-peter-mingils-2053|website=Building Fortunes Radio Network|publisher=PM Marketing LLC|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
Tanster is currently using her artistic talents and her industry to promote public awareness of the elicit behaviors of corrupt institutions and private groups. Her blog is a center of information regarding various topics of public concern. Tanster was featured on Neon Nettle as a source about the persecution that NXIVM whistleblower Ben Szemkus was facing for coming forward with his story. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neon Nettle|url=https://neonnettle.com/news/4626-whistleblower-who-exposed-hillary-clinton-s-child-trafficking-ties-feared-dead|website=Neon Nettle|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:UNDP logo.svg|150px|thumb|right|Logo of the United Nations Development Programme]]

The '''United Nations Development Programme''' ('''UNDP''') is the [[United Nations]]' global development network.

Headquartered in [[New York City]], UNDP advocates for change and connects countries to knowledge, experience and resources to help people build a better life. It provides expert advice, training and grants support to developing countries, with increasing emphasis on assistance to the [[Least developed country|least developed countries]]. It promotes technical and investment cooperation among nations. The status of UNDP is that of an executive board within the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. The UNDP Administrator is the third highest-ranking official of the United Nations after the [[United Nations Secretary-General]] and Deputy Secretary-General.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=9 un.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924113646/http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=9 |date=24 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To accomplish the [[Sustainable Development Goals|SDGs]] and encourage global development, UNDP focuses on poverty reduction, HIV/AIDS, democratic governance, energy and environment, social development, and crisis prevention and recovery. UNDP also encourages the protection of human rights and the empowerment of women in all of its programmes. The UNDP Human Development Report Office also publishes an annual [[Human Development Report]] (since 1990) to measure and analyse developmental progress. In addition to a global Report, UNDP publishes regional, national, and local Human Development Reports.&lt;ref name="hdr.undp.org"&gt;[http://hdr.undp.org/en/ un.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

UNDP is funded entirely by voluntary contributions from member nations. The organization operates in 177 countries, where it works with local governments to meet development challenges and [[Capacity building|develop local capacity]]. Additionally, the UNDP works internationally to help countries achieve the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs). UNDP was one of the main UN agencies involved in the development of the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]].

UNDP works with nations on their own solutions to global and national development challenges. As they develop local capacity, they draw on the people of UNDP and its wide range of partners. However UNDP offers to help only if the different nations request it to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org.my/0912010343%C2%BBUnited_Nations_Development_Programme_(UNDP).aspx|title=United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.un.org.my|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Founding ==

The UNDP was founded on 22 November 1965 with the merging of the Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance (EPTA) and the Special Fund.&lt;ref&gt;''Consolidation of the Special Fund and the Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance in a United Nations Development Programme'' GA Res 2029, XX (1965)&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale was to "avoid duplication of [their] activities". The EPTA was set up in 1949 to help the economic and political aspects of underdeveloped countries while the Special Fund was to enlarge the scope of UN technical assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Stokke, O., 2009, The UN and Development: From Aid to Cooperation, Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, especially Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; The Special Fund arose from the idea of a Special United Nations Fund for Economic Development (SUNFED) (which was initially called UNFED).

Countries such as the Nordic countries were proponents of such a [[United Nations]] (UN) controlled fund. However, the fund was opposed by developed countries, especially by the United States who was wary of the Third World dominating such a funding and preferred it to be under the auspices of the [[World Bank]]. The concept of SUNFED was dropped to form the "Special Fund". This Special Fund was some compromise over the SUNFED concept, it did not provide investment capital, but only helped to bring pre-conditions for private investment.

With the US proposing and creating the [[International Development Association]] within the World Bank's umbrella, the EPTA and the Special Fund appeared to be conducting similar work. In 1962, the United Nations Economic and Social Council asked the Secretary General to consider the merits and disadvantages of merging UN technical assistance programs and in 1966, the EPTA and the Special Fund merged to form the UNDP.&lt;ref&gt;Stokke, O., 2009, The UN and Development: From Aid to Cooperation, Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, p.82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, C.N. 2006, The United Nations Development Programme: A Better Way? Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp.51–66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, R., Emmerij. L. And Ghai, D., 2004, UN Contributions to Development Thinking and Practice, Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press pp.73-84&lt;/ref&gt;

==Budget==
In 2013, UNDP’s entire budget was approximately US$5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us.undp.org/WashingtonOffice/UNDPFactSheet2012.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=26 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202155037/http://www.us.undp.org/WashingtonOffice/UNDPFactSheet2012.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2012 }} UNDP Fact Sheet 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functions ==
UNDP’s offices and staff are on the ground in 177 countries, working with governments and local communities to help them find solutions to global and national development challenges.

UNDP links and coordinates global and national efforts to achieve the goals and national development priorities laid out by host countries. UNDP focuses primarily on five developmental challenges:

===Democratic governance===
UNDP supports national democratic transitions by providing policy advice and technical support, improving [[civil service reform in developing countries|institutional]] and individual capacity within countries, educating populations about and advocating for democratic reforms, promoting negotiation and dialogue, and sharing successful experiences from other countries and locations. UNDP also supports existing democratic institutions by increasing dialogue, enhancing national debate, and facilitating consensus on national governance programmes.

===Poverty reduction===
{{primary sources|section|date=December 2013}}
UNDP helps countries develop strategies to [[Poverty reduction|combat poverty]] by expanding access to economic opportunities and resources, linking poverty programmes with countries’ larger goals and policies, and ensuring a greater voice for the poor. It also works at the macro level to reform trade, encourage debt relief and foreign investment, and ensure the poorest of the poor benefit from globalisation. On the ground, UNDP sponsors developmental pilot projects, promotes the role of [[women in development]], and coordinates efforts between governments, NGOs, and outside donors. In this way, UNDP works with local leaders and governments to provide opportunities for impoverished people to create businesses and improve their economic condition.

The UNDP [[International Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth]] ([[International Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth|IPC-IG]]) in Brasília, Brazil expands the capacities of developing countries to design, implement and evaluate socially inclusive development projects. IPC-IG is a global forum for South-South policy dialogue and learning, having worked with more than 7,000 officials from more than 50 countries.

A 2013 evaluation of the UNDP’s poverty reduction efforts states that the UNDP has effectively supported national efforts to reduce poverty, by helping governments make policy changes that benefit the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evaluation of UNDP Contribution to Poverty Reduction|url=http://issuu.com/undp-evaluation/docs/evaluation_poverty_2013/90.|publisher=UNDP|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the same evaluation also states there is a strong need for better measurement and monitoring of the impacts of the UNDP's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evaluation of UNDP Contribution to Poverty Reduction|url=http://issuu.com/undp-evaluation/docs/evaluation_poverty_2013/94.|publisher=UNDP|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UNDP’s Strategic Plan 2014-2017 incorporates the recommendations of this poverty evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNDP Strategic Plan: 2014-2017|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/corporate/Changing_with_the_World_UNDP_Strategic_Plan_2014_17.html.|publisher=UNDP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crisis prevention and recovery===
UNDP works to reduce the risk of [[armed conflict]]s or [[disaster]]s, and promote early recovery after crisis have occurred. UNDP works through its country offices to support local government in yousef is
 assessment, capacity development, coordinated planning, and policy and standard setting.

Examples of UNDP risk reduction programmes include efforts to control [[small arms proliferation]], strategies to reduce the impact of natural disasters, and programmes to encourage use of diplomacy and prevent violence. Recovery programmes include disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants, demining efforts, programmes to reintegrate displaced persons, restoration of basic services, and transitional justice systems for countries recovering from warfare.

===Environment and energy===
As the poor are disproportionately affected by environmental degradation and lack of access to clean, affordable water, sanitation and energy services, UNDP seeks to address environmental issues in order to improve developing countries’ abilities to develop sustainably, increase [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] and [[Poverty reduction|reduce poverty]]. UNDP works with countries to strengthen their capacity to address global environmental issues by providing innovative policy advice and linking partners through environmentally sensitive development projects that help poor people build sustainable livelihoods.

UNDP’s environmental strategy focuses on effective [[water governance]] including access to [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]], access to [[sustainable energy]] services, Sustainable land management to combat [[desertification]] and [[land degradation]], conservation and sustainable use of [[biodiversity]], and policies to control emissions of harmful pollutants and ozone-depleting substances. UNDP's Equator Initiative office biennially offers the [[Equator Prize]] to recognize outstanding indigenous community efforts to reduce poverty through the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, and thus making local contributions to achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs).

In 2012 the Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN) was established. BIOFIN brings 30 countries together to develop and implement evidence-based finance plans to safeguards biodiversity. BIOFIN has developed an innovative and adaptable methodology to guide countries to analyse the policy and institutional context for biodiversity finance; measure the current biodiversity expenditures; assess future financial needs; and identify the most suitable finance solutions to achieve national biodiversity targets.&lt;ref&gt;Factsheet: The Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN). {{cite web|url=http://107.170.39.247/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/biofin_factsheet_6may14.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=3 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606234239/http://107.170.39.247/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/biofin_factsheet_6may14.pdf |archivedate=6 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV/AIDS===
HIV/AIDS is a big issue in today's society and UNDP works to help countries prevent further spreading and reduce its impact, convening The Global Commission on HIV and the Law which reported in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hivlawcommission.org/ Global Commission on HIV and the Law ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hub for Innovative Partnerships===
Major programmes underway are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.undp.org/geneva/hub.html |title=The Hub for Innovative Partnerships |date=November 2011 |publisher=undp.org |accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[ART Global Initiative]]
* [[World Alliance of Cities Against Poverty]]
* [[Territorial Approach to Climate Change]]
* [[Africa–Kazakhstan Partnership for the SDGs]]

===Human Development Report===
Since 1990, the UNDP has annually published the [[Human Development Report]], which includes topics on [[Human development (humanity)|Human Development]] and the annual [[Human Development Index]].&lt;ref name="hdr.undp.org"/&gt;

=== Evaluation ===
The UNDP spends about 0.2% of its budget on internal evaluation of the effectiveness of its programmes.&lt;ref name=svd_30sep2013&gt;{{cite news|title=Biståndets svarta hål (in Swedish)|url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/bistandet-slukas-i-fns-svarta-hal_8564732.svd|accessdate=30 September 2013|newspaper=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|date=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UNDP’s Evaluation Office is a member of the UN Evaluation Group (UNEG) which brings together all the units responsible for evaluation in the UN system. Currently the UNEG has 43 members and 3 observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="About the United Nations Evaluation Group".|url=http://uneval.org|publisher=UN|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global Policy Centers ==
The UNDP runs six GPCs, including the Seoul GPC on partnerships, and the Global Center for Public Service Excellence that issues the 'Raffles Review' email newsletter on developments in public administration research.

== UN co-ordination role ==
UNDP plays a significant co-ordination role for the UN’s activities in the field of development. This is mainly executed through its leadership of the UN Development Group and through the Resident Co-ordinator System.

=== United Nations Development Group ===
{{Main|United Nations Development Group}}

The United Nations Development Group (UNDG) was created by the Secretary General in 1997, to improve the effectiveness of UN development at the country level. The UNDG brings together the operational agencies working on development. The Group is chaired by the Administrator of UNDP. UNDP also provides the Secretariat to the Group.

The UNDG develops policies and procedures that allow member agencies to work together and analyse country issues, plan support strategies, implement support programmes, monitor results and advocate for change. These initiatives increase UN impact in helping countries achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), including poverty reduction.

32 UN agencies are members of the UNDG. The Executive Committee consists of the four "founding members": [[UNICEF]], [[UNFPA]], [[WFP]] and UNDP. The Office of the [[High Commissioner for Human Rights]] is an ex-officio member of the Executive Committee.

===Resident coordinator system===
The [[Resident Coordinator]] (RC) system co-ordinates all organizations of the United Nations system dealing with operational activities for development in the field. The RC system aims to bring together the different UN agencies to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operational activities at the country level. Resident Coordinators, who are funded, appointed and managed by UNDP, lead UN country teams in more than 130 countries and are the designated representatives of the Secretary-General for development operations. Working closely with national governments, Resident Coordinators and country teams advocate the interests and mandates of the UN drawing on the support and guidance of the entire UN family.It is now coordinated by the [[UNDG]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=5 undg.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220175536/http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=5 |date=20 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===NSA surveillance ===
{{Further|Global surveillance disclosure}}

Documents of [[Edward Snowden]] showed in December 2013 that British and American intelligence agencies surveillance targets with America's [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) included organisations such as the United Nations Development Programme, the UN's children's charity [[Unicef]] and [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] and the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/20/gchq-targeted-aid-agencies-german-government-eu-commissioner GCHQ and NSA targeted charities, Germans, Israeli PM and EU chief] The Guardian 20 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of UNDP resources used by Hamas ===

In August 2016, Israel's [[Shin Bet]] security agency went public with the arrest of Wahid Abdallah al Bursh, a Palestinian engineer with the United Nations Development Programme. In its statement, [[Shin Bet]] said that Wahid had confessed to being recruited in 2014 to help [[Hamas]].

Among "various assignments" he performed on behalf of Gaza's dominant Islamist group was assistance in building a maritime jetty for its fighters "using UNDP resources," the Shin Bet statement said without providing further details on that charge.

It said Bursh also persuaded his UNDP superiors to prioritize the neighborhoods of [[Hamas]] operatives when earmarking money for reconstruction in Gaza, which was devastated by a 2014 war with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-un-hamas-idUSKCN10K1SI Israel says U.N. aid used by Hamas] Reuters 9 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
The UNDP has been criticised by members of its staff and the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] of the United States for irregularities in its finances in North Korea. Artjon Shkurtaj claimed that he had found counterfeit US dollars in the Programmes safe while the staff were paid in Euros. The UNDP denied any wrongdoing, and keeping improper accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In mid-2006, as first reported by Inner City Press&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.innercitypress.com/unhq062806.html|title=In Uganda, UNDP's Belated Announcement of Program Halt Leaves Questions Unanswered|last=Lee|first=Matthew Russell|date=2006-06-28|website=www.innercitypress.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then by The New Vision,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/13/506557 newvision.co.ug] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214024159/http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/13/506557 |date=14 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UNDP halted its disarmament programmes in the [[Karamoja]] region of Uganda in response to human rights abuses in the parallel forcible disarmament programmes carried out by the [[Uganda People's Defence Force]].

== Administrator ==
The UNDP Administrator has the rank of an Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations. While the Administrator is often referred to as the third highest-ranking official in the UN (after the [[UN Secretary General]] and the UN Deputy Secretary General), this has never been formally codified.

In addition to his or her responsibilities as head of UNDP, the Administrator is also the Vice-Chair of the [[UN Development Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/about-us.html|title=About us {{!}} UNDP|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|language=en|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://undg.org/about/undg-global/|title=UNDG at the Global Level|last=|first=|date=|website=undg.org|language=en|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of Administrator is appointed by the Secretary-General of the UN and confirmed by the General Assembly for a term of four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Achim Steiner is the current Administrator.&lt;ref name="undp.org administrator 2"&gt;{{Cite web |title=UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner|last=|first=|date=3 Jul 2017 |url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/operations/leadership/administrator.html|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five countries on the UNDP board have some influence over selection of the administrator.{{Citation needed |date=March 2011}}

The first administrator of the UNDP was [[Paul G. Hoffman]], former head of the [[Economic Cooperation Administration]] which administered the [[Marshall Plan]].

Other holders of the position have included: [[Bradford Morse]], former Republican congressman from Massachusetts; [[William Henry Draper III|William Draper]], venture capitalist and friend of [[George H.W. Bush]] who saw one of the UN system's major achievements, the [[Human Development Report]], introduced during his tenure; [[Mark Malloch Brown]], who was previously Vice President of External Affairs at the [[World Bank]] and subsequently became UN Deputy Secretary General. [[Kemal Derviş]], a former finance minister of Turkey and senior [[World Bank]] official, was the previous UNDP Administrator. Derviş started his four-year term on 15 August 2005.

{{History of Latvia}}

The '''Vends''' ({{lang-lat|wendi}}, {{lang-lv|vendi}}) were a small tribe that lived in the 12th to 16th centuries in the area around the town of Wenden (now [[Cēsis]]) in present-day north-central [[Latvia]]. 

According to [[Livonian Chronicle of Henry]] prior to their arrival in the area of Wenden in the 12th century, the Vends were settled in [[Ventava]] county ({{lang-la|Wynda}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmgh.de/de/fs2/object/display/bsb00000734_00109.html?sortIndex=010%3A070%3A0031%3A010%3A00%3A00&amp;zoom=1.50&amp;html=true Heinrici Chronicon Livoniae, X.14.]: ''Wendi autem humiles erant eo tempore et pauperes utpote a Winda repulsi, qui est fluvius Curonie, et habitantes in Monte Antiquo, iuxta quem 1206.&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Venta River]] near the present city of [[Ventspils]] in western Latvia. Their proximity to more numerous Finnic and [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] tribes inclined the Vends to ally with the German [[Northern Crusades|crusaders]], who began building a stone castle near the older Vendian wooden fortress in 1207. The castle of Wenden later became the residence of the Master of the [[Livonian Order]]. The last known record of the Vends' existence as a distinct entity dates from the sixteenth century.

== Origin ==
[[Henry of Latvia]] made the first surviving mention of the Vends as they were chased away from [[Courland]] and Christianized by Germans during [[Livonian Crusade]] of 1198-1290.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=Foreword to the Past |last=Bojtár |first=Endre |authorlink= |year=1999 |publisher=Central European University Press |isbn= 9789639116429 |page=87 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5aoId7nA4bsC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Traditionally researchers believe that Vends spoke a [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] language and were related to the neighboring [[Livonian people|Livonians]] and the [[Votes]]. Sometimes they are associated with the Western Slavic [[Wends]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://drevnosti.rod1.org/the-slavic-antiquities/48-books/76-slavs-in-antiquity-by-valentin-v-sedov-summary-of-the-book В.В. Седов. Славяне в древности. Москва, 1994 (Summary in English)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flag of Latvia ==
Vends may have a connection with the national [[flag of Latvia]]. The [[Rhyme Chronicle of Livonia]] (''Livländische Reimchronik'') states that in 1290 when the local militia was recruited to defend [[Riga]], they came from Wenden with "a Latvian red banner crossed by white, in the manner of the Vends/of the Wenden" (''nâch wendischen siten'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.old.historia.lv/alfabets/A/AT/atskanu_hronika/hronikas_teksts/09038_10040.vacu.htm Livlädische Reimchronik] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215035451/http://www.old.historia.lv/alfabets/A/AT/atskanu_hronika/hronikas_teksts/09038_10040.vacu.htm |date=2014-12-15 }}: ''die quâmen hovelîchen dar / mit einer banier rôtgevar,/ daß was mit wîße durch gesniten/ hûte nâch wendischen siten./ Wenden ist ein burc genant,/ von den die banier wart bekant,/ und ist in Letten lant gelegen,/ dâ die vrowen rîtens pflegen/ nâch den siten, als die man./ vor wâr ich ûch daß sagen kan,/ die banier der Letten ist.''

'''William K. Sessions III''' (born 1947 in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Connecticut]]) is serving as a [[United States federal judge|Senior United States District Judge]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Vermont]] and has served as the Vice Chair and eventually as Chair of the [[United States Sentencing Commission]]. He was confirmed on October 21, 2009 as Chair of the United States Sentencing Commission, and served until December 22, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Commissioner Information|url=http://www.ussc.gov/about/commissioners/former-commissioner-information|publisher=United States Sentencing Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==

Sessions was educated at [[Middlebury College]] where he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1969. He earned a [[Juris Doctor]] in 1972 from the [[George Washington University Law School]]. Sessions served as a [[United States Army]] First Lieutenant. He was a [[law clerk]] for Judge Hilton Dier in Addison County District Court in 1973. He later worked for the [[Addison County, Vermont|Addison County]] Public Defender before entering private practice in 1978. He also worked as an adjunct professor at [[Vermont Law School]] from 1978 until 1995. In 1992 he managed the successful reelection campaign of Senator [[Patrick Leahy]], who defeated [[Jim Douglas]].

==Federal judicial service==

Sessions was nominated by [[Bill Clinton]] on June 30, 1995, to a seat vacated by [[Fred I. Parker]].  He was confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on August 11, 1995, and received his commission on August 14, 1995. Sessions served as chief judge from 2002 to 2010. He assumed [[senior status]] on June 15, 2014.

==Notable case==

On September 12, 2007, Judge Sessions ruled in favor of the [[Sierra Club]], the states of [[Vermont]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], and other environmental groups in rejecting the auto industry’s attempt to block states from regulating emissions from cars.  Session’s ruling opens the doors for New York and Vermont to proceed with enacting the California Clean Car (Pavley) Standards, pending [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] approval.  These standards, adopted by California and at least 11 other states, aim to reduce emissions from cars by 30 percent when fully implemented in 2016. This precedent will likely have an important impact on similar cases pending in California and Rhode Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/environmentallaw/lawsuits/0303.asp|title=Sierra Club website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sentencing commission==

On April 20, 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] nominated Sessions to be Chair of the [[United States Sentencing Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:llXlrqE1p2wJ:www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/DCPD-2009NOMINATIONS/pdf/DCPD-2009NOMINATIONS.pdf+%22nominations+submitted+to+the+Senate%22+Sessions+%22Sentencing+Commission%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESildbiUqlKKBCUrF-_w4xxFs-IeoZShpcoKqYKYgdn-rddc_lyLfrKwlVCZ9KZZ6LPnPLYtGRTp51EqTEOPZShtrMrzJZXaS-MsCyXo-laxnQHpe4kJVO8XKaqphXcjotQ-ht9L&amp;sig=AFQjCNE6NvPmV-4dYR6coF7sjMA9G3h8JA|United States Sentencing Commission Nomination]&lt;/ref&gt; Sessions' nomination languished with no full Senate vote for more than six months, with Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] contending that Senate Republicans had stalled Sessions' nomination in retaliation for the speed of Supreme Court Associate Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]]'s confirmation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legaltimes.typepad.com/blt/2009/07/obama-taps-another-morrison-foerster-lawyer.html|title=Obama Taps Another MoFo Lawyer|website=The BLT: The Blog of Legal Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reid filed cloture on Sessions' nomination on October 20, 2009, and the Senate confirmed Sessions in a voice vote on October 21, 2009.

      <comment>The last paragraph and section on the wali of swat is highly defamatory and libellous. It is well known in the region that such events did not occur and were mainly used by his opponents to defame the wali's reputation in the valley where he was incredibly popular and well liked.</comment>

The '''Wāli of Swat''' ([[Urdu language|Urdu]]: '''والی سوات''') was the official title of the leader ([[wāli]]) of the erstwhile [[Swat (princely state)|princely state of Swat]] and also the nomenclature of the dynasty that ruled there from 1926 to 1969. The earlier titles of rulers in this area were 'Akhund', 'Khan', and so on. The title "amir-e shariyat" remained in brief usage, when the title badshah came into usage for the ruler. This title was officially changed to "wali" in 1926 when Swat became a princely state in the [[British Raj]]. Following Pakistan's independence post-1947, Swat remained an autonomous princely state of [[West Pakistan]] and the Wali continued to function as a political entity. The post became defunct in 1969, after the princely state of Swat became [[Former administrative units of Pakistan|dissolved]] and was incorporated into the North-West Frontier Province of [[Pakistan]] (now [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]). The region comprising the former princely state today covers parts of the [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat]], [[Buner District|Buner]] and [[Shangla District|Shangla]] districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Today, the title is used unofficially as a courtesy title by heirs of the Miangul family of the former Wali of Swat. The whole dynasty founded by the Abdul Wadud Badshah, also called itself by this title.

== Miangul Jahanzeb ==

[[Miangul Jahanzeb]] (1908–1987) was the last Wali of Swat who was popular for promoting education in the region. He served as the Wāli of Swat between 1949 and 1969, taking over from his father, Miangul Abdul Wadud. He is remembered for the hard work he put into building schools, hospitals and roads for his people, but also for his absolute rule over the region, which ended when Pakistan took control after local unrest.

Miangul Jahanzeb was born at Saidu-Sharif, on 5 June 1908. He was the eldest son of H.H. Miangul Abdul Wadud, who preceded him as the Wali of Swat. Jahanzeb was educated in Islamia Collegiate school and the Islamia College University of Peshawar, 1923. He has four sons 

H.H Miangul Jahanzeb was appointed as successor (Wali Ahad) in 1933. His father, Miangul Abdul Wadud (Wali of Swat) abdicated in favour of his eldest son ([[Miangul Jahanzeb]]), whom he had carefully educated along modern lines, and gradually trained up to assume the full burdens of government. He was enthroned as Wali of Swat on 12 June 1949 and granted the title of Ghazi-e-Millat (1951) and a hereditary salute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buyers|first=Christopher|title=Swat|url=http://royalark.net|publisher=royal.net|accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Wali headed each department of his administration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valleyswat.net/literature/papers/Administrative_System_of_Swat.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; His role was that of king and religious leader, chief minister and commander-in-chief, chief exchequer and head qazi. He inspected every construction project personally and did not compromise on quality, which is partly why the [[buildings of the Swat (princely state)|buildings of the Swat]] are still in excellent condition and admired by the people. He ensured that his government provided good administration and productive revenue collection and a judicial system that provided quick and free justice to all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jilani|first=Zebu|title=The Wali of Swat|url=http://swatreliefinitiative.org|publisher=swatreliefinitiative.org|accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a unique system of administration.

He surpassed the other contemporary rulers in the field of education. Schools and colleges were built across the State.

Jahan Zeb was also a conscientious protector of the landmarks of previous cultures. In the era of the last Wali of Swat State Miangul Abdul Haq Jahanzeb, the ruins were protected and preserved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khpalswat.com/site/history/page.aspx?id=4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign Heads of State and VIPs became regular visitors to the valley, and the Wali became a frequent player on the national stage. In 1961 the Queen of England, as a guest of the Wali, loved Swat and called it “The Switzerland of the East”. The first Prime Minister of Pakistan [[Liaqat Ali Khan]] also visited Swat to attend the coronation ceremony of the Wali.

The last Wali of Swat died on September 14, 1987 at Saidu Sharif. Swat is now part of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]].
