      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3744">The '''2016 PDP National Convention''' was held on Saturday, 21 May 2016 at the [[Sharks Stadium]] in [[Port Harcourt]], [[Rivers State]]. It marked the first time the National Convention took place outside [[Abuja]], Nigeria's federal capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PDP in make-or-break convention|url=http://newtelegraphonline.com/pdp-make-break-convention/|accessdate=4 April 2016|work=[[New Telegraph]]|date=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention drew delegates from the 36 states, as well as the 12 [[PDP Governors Forum|governors of the PDP]], national and state assembly members, former governors, [[PDP Board of Trustees|Board of Trustees]] members and former [[National Working Committee]] members. Among those who graced the convention were the Deputy Senate President [[Ike Ekweremadu]], Senator [[Godswill Akpabio]] and former Senate President [[David Mark]]. 

Although well attended, incumbent acting chair of the National Working Committee [[Ali Modu Sheriff]] withdrew from the event earlier that day. Sheriff had announced a postponement of the convention over legal issues. This however didn't go down
well with some members who declared that the convention must go on as scheduled. After Sheriff's departure, the convention simply continued. [[Ahmed Makarfi]], a former governor, was appointed alongside 6 others to replace Sheriff and the NWC in a caretaker capacity. They will run the affairs of the party until a National Working Committee is elected within 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ernest Chinwo|title=PDP Throws Out Sheriff, Markarfi Heads Caretaker Committee |url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2016/05/21/pdp-throws-out-sheriff-markarfi-heads-caretaker-committee/|accessdate=22 May 2016|work=[[Thisday]]|date=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention Committee was set up on 5 April 2016 to help plan, organize and coordinate the event. Members of the executive include [[Ezenwo Nyesom Wike]] (Chairman), [[Darius Ishaku]] (Deputy Chairman) and [[Dave Umahi]] (Secretary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wike to head PDP Convention Committee|url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2016/04/04/wike-to-head-pdp-convention-committee/|accessdate=4 April 2016|work=[[Thisday]]|date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The committee's inaugural meeting was held at [[Government House, Port Harcourt]] on 9 April 2016. The meeting had 17 of its prominent members in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PDP National Convention will serve as avenue to grab power in 2019 – Wike|url=http://authenticnewsdaily.com/2016/04/10/pdp-national-convention-will-serve-as-avenue-to-grab-power-in-2019-wike/|accessdate=10 April 2016|work=Authentic News Daily |date=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chairperson of the Committee is former governor, [[Ahmed Makarfi]] while the Secretary is [[Ben Obi]]. Other members of the Committee include: [[Odion Ugbesia]] (Financial, Treasury and Audit), [[Adedayo Clement Adeyeye|Prince Dayo Adeyeye]] (Publicity), [[Abdul Ningi]] (Organization and Mobilization), Aisha Aliyu (Women and Youth) and Barrister Kabiru Usman (Legal).

The '''2016–present purges in Turkey''' are an ongoing [[purge]]s by the government of [[Turkey]] enabled by a [[Martial law and state of emergency in Turkey|state of emergency]] in reaction to the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt|15 July failed ''coup d'état'']].&lt;ref name="NPRpurges"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DWpurges"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eupurges"/&gt; After the immediate arrest of military personnel accused of making the coup attempt, arrests were expanded to include further elements of the [[Turkish Armed Forces|Turkish military service]], as well as various [[Ministries of Turkey|civil servants]] and private businesses. These later actions, reflecting a power struggle between secularist and [[Islamism|Islamist]] political elites in Turkey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/10/turkey-power-struggle-between-islamists-and-secularits.html|title=Power struggle erupts in Turkey’s security structure|date=12 October 2016|author=Metin Gurcan|publisher=[[Al-Monitor]]|accessdate=29 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030000137/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/10/turkey-power-struggle-between-islamists-and-secularits.html|archive-date=30 October 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which began to be known as a purge, affected people who were not active in nor aware of the coup as it happened, but who were alleged to be connected with the [[Gülen movement]], a group which the government blames for the coup. Even the mere possession of books authored by Gülen may be considered evidence of such a connection and cause for arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Babasının evinde Gülen'in kitapları çıktı |trans-title=Gülen's books turned up at his father's house |url=http://www.haber10.com/guncel/babasinin_evinde_gulen_in_kitaplari_cikti-648124 |publisher=Haber10 |date=13 August 2016 |accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tens of thousands of public servants and soldiers were purged in the first week following the coup.&lt;ref name="NYT-tr-purge"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/02/world/europe/turkey-purge-erdogan-scale.html|title=The Scale of Turkey’s Purge Is Nearly Unprecedented|date=2 August 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, on 16 July 2016, just one day after the coup was foiled, 2,745 judges were dismissed and detained.&lt;ref name="judiciary_purge_AP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dailysabah_purge"/&gt; This was followed by the dismissal, detention or suspension of over 100,000 officials,&lt;ref name="NYT2-tr-purge"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/world/europe/turkey-erdogan-gulen-purge.html |title=Turks See Purge as Witch Hunt of ‘Medieval’ Darkness |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-18/turkey-launches-mass-raids-against-27gulen-linked27-businesses/7764694 |title=Turkey launches mass raids against 'Gulen-linked' businesses |work=ABC News|date=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN2154"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/07/20/europe/turkey-failed-coup-attempt/index.html | title=Turkey declares three-month state of emergency | work=[[CNN]].com | date=20 July 2016 | accessdate=21 July 2016 | last1=Sariyuce | first1=Isil | last2=Dewan | first2=Angela}}&lt;/ref&gt; a figure that had increased to over 110,000 by early November 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkey draws Western condemnation over arrest of Kurdish lawmakers|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-security-kurds-idUSKBN12Y2XA|work=Reuters|accessdate=4 November 2016|date=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 125,000 after the 22 November decree,&lt;ref name="nyt161122" /&gt; reaching at least 135,000 with the 7 January's decrees, about 160,000 after 29 April 2017's suspensions and arrests decree&lt;ref name="Reuters0430" /&gt; and 180,000 after July 8th 2018's massive dismissal decree.

== Background ==
In January 2014, during a [[2013 corruption scandal in Turkey|major corruption inquiry]] in Turkey, 96 judges and prosecutors, including the chief prosecutor of [[İzmir]], [[Huseyin Bas]], were transferred to new locations, ending the investigations.  Bas was transferred to [[Samsun]]. Altogether 120 judges and prosecutors were reassigned.&lt;ref name="ThReut_halt_investigation"/&gt; At the time, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' described the events as "the biggest purge of the judiciary in [Turkey's] history".&lt;ref name="Telegraph_biggest_purge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ThReut_purge_intensifies"/&gt; From 2014 to mid-2016, repeated purges of civilian, military and judicial officials took place in Turkey, mainly aimed at followers of [[Fethullah Gülen]], a former colleague of the Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]].&lt;ref name="HRW_background"/&gt;

== Sectors affected ==

During the first post-coup speech Erdoğan could address to the nation upon landing at [[Atatürk airport]], he said, "This uprising is a gift from God to us because this will be a reason to cleanse our army".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-17/coup-was-a-gift-from-god-says-erdogan-who-plans-a-new-turkey|title=Coup Was ‘Gift From God’ for Erdogan Planning a New Turkey|last=Champion|first=Marc|website=Bloomberg.com|access-date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/17/us-turkey-coup-attempt-fethullah-gulen|title=Turkey detains 6,000 over coup attempt as Erdoğan vows to 'clean state of virus'|last=Kingsley|first=Patrick|date=17 July 2016|website=the Guardian|access-date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-security-primeminister-idUSKCN0ZV2HK|title=Turkey rounds up plot suspects after thwarting coup against Erdogan|date=17 July 2016|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extensive purge of the Turkish civil service began with Erdoğan warning his opponents that "they will pay a heavy price for this."&lt;ref name="NYT_countercoup" /&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the purges as a "counter-coup" and expected Erdoğan to "become more vengeful and obsessed with control than ever, exploiting the crisis not just to punish mutinous soldiers but to further quash whatever dissent is left in Turkey".&lt;ref name="NYT_countercoup" /&gt;

On 18 July, U.S. Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] urged Turkish authorities to halt the increasing crackdown on its citizens, indicating that the crackdown was meant to "suppress dissent".  French Foreign Minister and former Prime Minister [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]] voiced concern, warning against a "political system which turns away from democracy".&lt;ref name="FT-purges"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Robinson |first1=Duncan |last2=Srivastava |first2=Mehul |date=18 July 2016 |title=US and EU leaders warn Turkey’s Erdogan over post-coup crackdown |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b82ef35a-4cc3-11e6-88c5-db83e98a590a.html#axzz4ElTMjZBX |publisher=[[Financial Times]] |language=English |access-date=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 2018, Turkey passed new [[Anti-terrorism legislation|anti-terrorism bill]] to replace emergency rule.&lt;ref name="aljazeerapurges"&gt;{{cite news |title=Turkey parliament approves new anti-terror law |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/07/turkey-parliament-approves-anti-terror-law-180725152308059.html |work=Al-Jazeera |date=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Human Rights Watch]], the new law "will allow authorities under the presidency, for the next three years, to dismiss judges and all other public officials arbitrarily. It also would allow the authorities to restrict movement within Turkey, ban public assemblies, and allow police to hold some suspects for up to 12 days without charge and repeatedly detain them in the same investigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Turkey: Normalizing the State of Emergency |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/07/20/turkey-normalizing-state-emergency |work=Human Rights Watch |date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|CHP]] parliamentary group leader [[Özgür Özel]] said that "With this bill, with the measures in this text, the state of emergency will not be extended for three months but for three years.

==Human rights==
[[Human rights in Turkey]] are governed by [[international law]] treaties, including the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] that Turkey signed in 2000, that take precedence over [[Legal system of the Republic of Turkey|Turkish legislation]] according to Article 90 of the 1982 [[Constitution of Turkey|Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubjCDGcZ1Z4C|title=Human Rights in Turkey|first=Zehra F.

On 24 July 2016, [[Amnesty International]] called for the European [[Committee for the Prevention of Torture]] to make an emergency visit to Turkey to observe the conditions in which the detainees were held.&lt;ref name="Amnesty_massive_torture" /&gt;

=== Identification methods ===
[[Johannes Hahn]], the [[European Commissioner]] dealing with Turkey's bid to become a [[member state of the European Union]] (EU), said that it appears Turkey's government had prepared arrest lists of political opponents before the coup attempt and had been waiting for the right time to act.&lt;ref name=Hahn&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/turkey-coup-attempt-erdogan-government-arrests-military-uprising-eu-commissioner-a7142426.html |title=Turkey coup attempt: Government had list of arrests prepared before rebellion, EU commissioner says|date=19 July 2016|newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usage of social medias monitoring is suspected.

Anonymous-and-paid denunciations are officially declared as the main source for identifying suspects. Most of the over 140 thousands people affected by the purges were affected following denunciations by coworkers and other citizens.&lt;ref name="lemonde17.10.23"&gt;Dénoncer les « terroristes » peut rapporter gros en Turquie http://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2017/10/23/denoncer-les-terroristes-peut-rapporter-gros-en-turquie_5204825_3210.html&lt;/ref&gt; The system have been legalized via a 31 August 2015's decree by the Ministry of interior.&lt;ref name="lemonde17.10.23" /&gt; The rewarded anonymous denunciation's grid is public and online, divided in 5 category according to the threat, and pointing to major suspects, mainly Kurds, then Gulenist, then Islamists (ISIS).&lt;ref name="lemonde17.10.23" /&gt;

=== Detainees' conditions ===
[[File:Selahattin Demirtaş 2018 campaign launch.jpg|thumb|Selahattin Demirtaş's [[Selahattin Demirtaş presidential campaign, 2018|presidential campaign]] being launched outside [[Edirne]] prison where he is incarcerated, 25 May 2018]]
According to [[Amnesty International]], during the July 2016 purges, detainees were denied food for up to three days and water for up to two days, were denied medical treatment, were reportedly raped with police [[Baton (law enforcement)|truncheons]] or fingers, and were subjected to other forms of torture.&lt;ref name="Amnesty_massive_torture" /&gt;  Amnesty said that three hundred male soldiers held in the [[Ankara]] police headquarters were beaten during their detention, with injuries including bruises, cuts and broken bones.  Forty soldiers were unable to walk because of their injuries, and two were unable to stand.&lt;ref name="Amnesty_massive_torture" /&gt;  Amnesty also said that detainees' shirts were covered in blood during their interrogations by prosecutors and that detainees during the purges were mostly prevented from contacting their families and lawyers.&lt;ref name="Amnesty_massive_torture" /&gt;

Given overcrowded conditions, the Turkish government published a decree on 16 August announcing that 38,000 inmates whose criminal offense pre-dated 1 July were now eligible for sentence reduction.&lt;ref name="38k_freed"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/17/turkey-free-prisoners-make-space-coup-plotters|title=Turkey to free 38,000 people from prisons to make space for alleged coup plotters|first=Associated|last=Press|date=17 August 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inmates with two years or less to serve are eligible, while inmates who have served half of their sentence can ask for parole. The decree applies to crimes committed before 1 July 2016, excluding convictions for murder, domestic violence, sexual abuse, terrorism or crimes against the state.&lt;ref name="38k_freed" /&gt;

===Arrest of human rights activists ===
Turkish human rights lawyer [[Orhan Kemal Cengiz]] was detained for three days in July 2016. He was "provisionally released" and remains subject to a travel ban.&lt;ref name="hrw_cengiz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omct.org/human-rights-defenders/urgent-interventions/turkey/2016/07/d23879/ Turkey: Provisional release of Mr. Orhan Kemal Cengiz and travel ban against him], [[World Organisation Against Torture]] (26 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Serdar Kuni, a doctor from [[Cizre]], who assisted the respected [[Human Rights Foundation]] in documenting violations in the town, and arrested on poorly defined charges of "being a member of a terrorist organization" for treating injured locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A Doctor’s Trial in a Turkish Border Town|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/29/opinion/a-doctors-trial-in-a-turkish-border-town.html|first=Christine|last=Mehta|date=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 June 2017, [[Taner Kılıç]], the Chair of Amnesty International Turkey, and another 22 lawyers were detained in [[İzmir]] by the Turkish police on the suspicion of having links with the Fethullah Gülen movement and later charged with "membership of a terrorist organisation". The detention and prosecution was condemned by Amnesty International and [[Human Rights Watch]] who asked for his immediate release. Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, stated that "detaining Kılıç on suspicion of terrorist offenses looks like a tactic aimed at discrediting his legitimate human rights work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Turkey: Imprisonment of Amnesty Chair is a devastating injustice|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/06/turkey-imprisonment-of-amnesty-chair-is-a-devastating-injustice/|accessdate=16 June 2017|work=Amnesty International|date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Turkey: Release Amnesty International Official|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/08/turkey-release-amnesty-international-official|accessdate=16 June 2017|work=Human Rights Watch|date=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chair of Amnesty International Turkey swept up in post-coup purge|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/06/chair-of-amnesty-international-turkey-swept-up-in-post-coup-purge/|accessdate=16 June 2017|work=Amnesty International|date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 1,000 [[Gülen movement schools]] exist worldwide, with 300 of them in Turkey.

== Reactions ==

The purges were criticized by Western governments and human rights groups. [[Human Rights Watch]] warned the Turkish government against "[using] the coup attempt to justify a witch-hunt against those it regards as opponents".&lt;ref name="HRW_background" /&gt; Andrew Gardner, [[Amnesty International]]'s researcher for Turkey, said: "We are witnessing a crackdown of exceptional proportions in Turkey at the moment. While it is understandable, and legitimate, that the government wishes to investigate and punish those responsible for this bloody coup attempt, they must abide by the rule of law and respect freedom of expression."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/07/turkey-media-purge-threatens-freedom-of-expression/ Turkey: Media purge threatens freedom of expression]". Amnesty International. 20 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, the purges were praised by [[Judicial Commission of Indonesia]] chairman [[Aidul Fitriciada Azhari]]. Azhari pointed to the purges as a positive example of external oversight of a judicial system and the exercise of executive power by a judicial commission, referring to the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/07/23/supreme-court-urged-accept-oversight-ensure-reform.html Supreme Court urged to accept oversight to ensure reform].

===Effect on Turkey's EU accession bid===
{{Main|Accession of Turkey to the European Union}}
[[Johannes Hahn]], the [[European Commissioner]] dealing with Turkey's bid to become a [[member state of the European Union]] (EU), said that it appeared Turkey's government had prepared arrest lists of political opponents before the coup attempt and had been waiting for the right time to act.&lt;ref name="Hahn"/&gt; EU [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]] [[Federica Mogherini]] condemned the purges, saying: "What we're seeing especially in the fields of universities, media, the judiciary, is unacceptable."&lt;ref name= Mogherini&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-security-idUSKCN0ZX07S?il=0 |title= Erdogan announces army overhaul in latest post-coup shakeup| website= Reuters.com| date= 22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Horst Seehofer]], the [[List of Ministers-President of Bavaria|minister-president]] of [[Bavaria]], urged the EU to suspend Turkey's accession negotiations: "If one sees how Turkey is dismantling the rule of law... then these (EU membership) negotiations must be stopped immediately. No democratic constitutional state acts like this."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-security-germany-idUSKCN1021CL Merkel ally urges EU to suspend Turkey accession talks over purge]". Reuters. 22 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 November 2016 the European Parliament voted 497 to 37 in favour of a non binding freeze on membership talks with Turkey in response to "disproportionate repressive measures taken in Turkey since the failed military coup attempt."&lt;ref name= EUFreeze&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.dw.com/en/majority-of-european-parliament-votes-to-freeze-eu-membership-talks-with-turkey/a-36503988 |title= Majority of European Parliament votes to freeze EU membership talks with Turkey| website= dw.com| date= 24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University associations===
The Czech University Council compared the purges of educational institutions in Turkey to events which took place under Communist dictatorship in former [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948–89)|Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/deputy-pm-seeks-government-motion-over-purge-of-education-sector-in-turkey Deputy PM seeks government motion over purge of education sector in Turkey]".

The [[European University Association]] (EUA) joined by the [[European University Foundations]] (EUF) “strongly and unconditionally” condemned the forced resignation of hundreds of deans from higher education institutions in Turkey in the wake of the failed coup attempt in the country, and called on all European governments, universities and scholars to speak out against these developments and to support democracy in Turkey, including institutional autonomy and academic freedom for scholars and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EUA Statement condemning the forced resignation of 1577 university deans|url=http://www.eua.be/activities-services/news/newsitem/2016/07/19/eua-statement-condemning-the-forced-resignation-of-1577-university-deans|accessdate=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Turkey purge: EUA condemns move on university deans Hundreds of deans have been ordered to resign while academics have been told not to travel abroad for work in the wake of the failed coup|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/turkey-purge-eua-condemns-move-university-deans| website= timeshighereducation.com| accessdate=25 July 2016|date=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement condemning the forced resignation of university deans in Turkey|url=http://uni-foundation.eu/european-university-foundation/news/statement-condemning-forced-resignation-university-deans-turkey|accessdate=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belgian Foreign Minister [[Didier Reynders]] said Turkish authorities' reaction to the failed coup needed to be "proportionate," and that he was alarmed by the arrests of judges and calls for reinstatement of the death penalty against coup participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Osborne|first1=Samuel|last2=Mortimer|first2=Caroline|title=Turkey coup: World leaders call for 'restraint and moderation' as Erdoğan continues purge|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/turkey-coup-8000-police-officers-removed-across-the-country-as-president-erdogan-continues-purge-a7142111.html|accessdate=25 July 2016|agency=Independent|date=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French Foreign Minister [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]] voiced concern, warning against a "political system which turns away from democracy" in response to the purges.&lt;ref name="FT-purges"/&gt;

===United States===
[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]] said he was concerned by pictures showing the rough treatment of some of the arrested coup plotters, some of whom appeared stripped to their underwear and handcuffed behind their backs.&lt;ref name="Obama"&gt;{{cite news| title= Turkey coup attempt: World leaders warn Erdoğan not to use uprising as excuse for crackdown as more than 6,000 arrested|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/17/turkey-coup-plot-president-erdogan-rounds-up-thousands-of-soldie/|accessdate=25 July 2016|work= [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]| date= 18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] urged Turkish authorities to halt the crackdown on its citizens, expressing concern that the aim of the crackdown was to "suppress dissent."&lt;ref name="FT-purges"/&gt;

===United Nations===
In July 2016, the U.S., with the support of Britain, drafted language for the [[United Nations Security Council]] that would have expressed grave concern over the situation, called upon on all parties to "respect the democratically elected government of Turkey" and the [[rule of law]], and urged the parties to show restraint and avoid violence. However, [[Egypt]] blocked the proposed statement.&lt;ref name="EgyptReject"&gt;Michelle Nichols, [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-security-un-idUSKCN0ZW0ZN?il=0 Egypt blocks U.N. call to respect 'democratically elected' government in Turkey], Reuters (16 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian diplomats argued that the Council is "in no position to qualify, or label [the Turkish] government&amp;nbsp;– or any other government for that matter&amp;nbsp;– as democratically elected or not". Objection by the United States and the UK&amp;nbsp;– permanent members of the Security Council&amp;nbsp;– led to Egypt proposing a new statement calling for all sides to "respect the democratic and constitutional principles and the rule of law", which was rejected, preventing the condemnation of the coup attempt by the Security Council.&lt;ref name="EgyptReject"/&gt;

In August 2016, [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein]] decried the purge.

In March 2018 [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] issued a report on the impact of the state of emergency on human rights in Turkey. The report indicates interference of the executive with the work of the judiciary and curtailment of  parliamentary oversight over the executive branch of government; arbitrary mass dismissals of civil servants and private sector employees; arbitrary closure of civil society organizations, including prominent human    rights NGOs and media; arbitrary detention of people arrested under state  of  emergency  measures; the use of torture and ill-treatment during pre-trial detention; restrictions  of the rights to freedoms of expression  and  of movement; arbitrary expropriation of private property; and  methods  of collective  punishment targeting family members of individuals suspected of offences under the state of emergency. OHCHR noted  with concern that the routine extensions of the state of emergency may lead to an enduring system of governing characterized by  a  large  number  of  arbitrary  decisions  that  profoundly affect the lives of many individuals and families. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/TR/2018-03-19_Second_OHCHR_Turkey_Report.pdf Report on the impact of the state of emergency on human rights in Turkey, including an update on the South-East]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis ==
[[Can Dündar]], Editor-in-chief of the Turkish daily ''[[Cumhuriyet]]'', described the purges as part of a historical pattern of political power in Turkey shifting back and forth between the secular military versus religious institutions, with democrats in the middle having little power to prevent the repeated oscillations, but worse than previous cycles. He described the 2016 purges as "the biggest witch-hunt in Turkey's history".&lt;ref name="HurriyetChief_biggest_witchhunt" /&gt; Historians and analysts including [[Henri J. Barkey]], Director of the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars#Middle East Program|Middle East Program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]], compared the 2016 Turkish purges to [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[Cultural Revolution]] that started in 1966 and the [[Iranian Cultural Revolution]] in which Iranian academia was purged during 1980–1987.&lt;ref name="NYT_Barkey" /&gt; The government of Turkey has been analysed to blame Western forces and raise anti-Americanism in order to distract the public from real intranational tensions, as well as to take an upper ground for negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/04/opinion/turkeys-new-anti-americanism.html|title=Turkey’s New Anti-Americanism|date=4 August 2016|work=The New York Times|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/europe/100000004564697/erdogan-says-west-supports-terrorism.html|title=Erdogan Says West Supports Terrorism|date=2 August 2016|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=7 August 2016|via=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/03/world/europe/turkey-coup-erdogan-fethullah-gulen-united-states.html|title=Turks Can Agree on One Thing: U.S. Was Behind Failed Coup|date=3 August 2016|work=The New York Times|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''New York Times'', "Searching for historical parallels, analysts have made comparisons with [[McCarthyism|Joseph McCarthy]]’s anti-Communist witch hunt in 1950s America, the [[Great Purge|Stalinist purges]] of the 1930s and the Cultural Revolution in China in the 1960s and ’70s."&lt;ref name="NYT2-tr-purge"/&gt; Other comparisons have been made with Hitler's use of the [[Reichstag fire]] to consolidate his power, and with [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk's]] use of the 1926 assassination plot on his life to purge Turkey of his political opponents and rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Ihrig, ''Measured Terror'', History Today, Volume 67 Issue 2 February 2017 [http://www.historytoday.com/stefan-ihrig/measured-terror]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''AUSTUDY''' scheme was an Australian educational assistance scheme that provided financial assistance to eligible students between 16 and 64 years of age. The program commenced on 1 January 1987 and ceased on 30 June 1998.

==History==
===Commencement===
Upon commencement on 1 January 1987, AUSTUDY replaced the [[Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme]] (TEAS) which was introduced by the [[Whitlam Government]] in 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4102.0 - Australian Social Trends, 1994|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/2f762f95845417aeca25706c00834efa/b2ee3279988d6988ca2570ec00787041!OpenDocument|website=Australian Bureau of Statistics, Australian Government|publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]|accessdate=26 March 2016|date=27 May 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; for students enrolled at university or other tertiary education institutions, and [[Adult Secondary Education Assistance Scheme]] (ASEAS) and [[Secondary Allowances Scheme]] (SAS) for those who needed financial assistance while enrolled at high school.

AUSTUDY was administered through the provisions of the [http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A00058 ''Student Assistance Act 1973'']&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/saa1973217/ ''Student Assistance Act 1973''' on AustLII]&lt;/ref&gt; and [http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004L00145 AUSTUDY Regulations].

The AUSTUDY scheme had 3 categories:
*General secondary: for students aged 16 to 19 years undertaking full-time secondary education;
*Adult secondary: for students aged 19 years and over undertaking full-time secondary education; and,
*Tertiary: for students aged 16 years to 64 years undertaking approved full-time post-secondary courses.

In general, it provided financial assistance in the form of:
*Living allowance, which include various components for a student who is independent or lives away from home, for a dependent spouse or for a dependent child;
*Fares allowance, which assisted students living away from home with the costs of travel at vacation times between home and the educational institution; or,
*Pensioner education supplement, which assisted receivers of certain Australian Government pensions with the additional costs relating to full-time or part-time study.

===Cessation===
On 1 July 1998, the [[Australian Government]] introduced new provisions for this payment to be paid under the ''[[Social Security Act 1991]]''. At the same time, the AUSTUDY scheme was renamed to [[Youth Allowance]] for 16- to 24-year-old students and [[Austudy Payment]] for students between 25 and 64 years of age. The pensioner education supplement program was retained, but its provisions were also moved to the ''Social Security Act 1991''. The payment was administered through various Australian Government Departments including the Department of Education, the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (DEETYA), the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs (DETYA) and [[Centrelink]].

The '''All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets''' ({{lang-uk|Всеукраїнський з'їзд Рад}}, {{lang-ru|Всеукраинский съезд Советов}}) was the supreme governing body of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] from 1917–22. From 1922 to 1938 the [[Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR]] designated after the [[1918 Russian Constitution]] mandated that Congress to be convened at least twice a year. The 1926 Constitution (in correspondence to all Soviet constitutions) lowered the minimum to once a year.

In total there were 14 Congresses of Soviets that for the most of the time took place in Kharkiv. Importance in conducting the congress of Soviets advised the People's Commissar in Affairs of Nationalities of the Russian [[Sovnarkom]] [[Joseph Stalin]] in his recommendations to a representative of Central Committee of [[Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party]] [[Mykola Porsh]] and a member of the Kiev regional committee of [[RSDLP(b)]] [[Sergei Bakinsky]] on November 30, 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.org.ua/?termin=Kordoni_Derzhavn%D1%96_Ukraini State borders of Ukraine]&lt;/ref&gt; The congress was intended to replace the [[Central Council of Ukraine]].

==History ==

===Cancelled First Congress (Kiev)===
[[File:Troicki public house.jpg|thumb|left|[[:uk:Троїцький народний будинок|Trinity Public House]] (also known at that time as Sadovsky Theater)]]
The very first Congress of Soviet initially took place in Kiev on December 17 (December 4, old style), 1917 in the hall of the M.Sadovsky Theater (also known as Trinity Public House). Over 2500 delegates participated at the congress. The Congress was called by the Kiev regional soviet of workers' and soldiers' deputies on the request of the Bolshevik organizations of Ukraine. Concurrently on December 16–18, 1917 in Kiev was taken place a regional congress of Bolsheviks of Ukraine. The Bolshevik Congress created a united political party of Ukraine the "RSDLP(b) - Social-Democracy of Ukraine" headed by the Chief Committee.

The first addressed issue was the election of the Congress presidium which was headed by the honorary chairman of congress [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]]. The central question on the congress agenda was the "Ultimatum of the Sovnarkom of Russia to the Central Council of Ukraine". On December 18, 1917 the congress condemned the ultimatum. The Bolshevik faction leader and member of organizational committee [[Vladimir Zatonsky]] announced that there has been a misunderstanding as too many delegates that were present at the congress without a right of vote. Zatonsky proposed to announce a break and check credentials of all delegates. As an answer to the proposal, the leader of the Peasant Association [[Mykola Stasyuk]] declared that the regional committee of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies wished to falsify the will of Ukrainian people by giving preference to workers and soldier who in addition were not even Ukrainians over peasants. Therefore, the central committee of the Peasant Association took care on its part to increase the peasant representation at the congress. After that Bolsheviks proposed to recognize the congress as a consultative meeting. When the proposal was rejected, the 127 supporters of Bolsheviks left the congress in protest. The rest participating delegates recognized the assembly as a competent congress. On December 18, 1917 the 124 delegates from 49 Soviets who left the Kiev Congress gathered at a separate meeting in the Kiev Central Bureau of Trade Unions.

On December 21, 1917 the [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guards]] of the [[Soviet Russia]] led by [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko]] occupied [[Kharkiv]]. At night on December 22, 1917 the Russian Red Guards with local Bolsheviks disarmed Ukrainian military units and arrested leaders of the Kharkiv City Council and garrison. On December 23, 1917 Bolsheviks established a [[revkom]] (revolutionary committee). The headquarters of a local Red Guard was established on December 14, 1917 and was located in the Stock Exchange building at Market Square (today Ploshcha Konstytutsii - Constitution Square).

On December 24–25, 1917 in the [[:ru:Дворянское собрание (Харьков)|building of Noble Assembly]] (Market Square) in Kharkiv took place another First Congress of Soviets. The congress gathered initially 964 participants, amount of which later grew to 1250. The congress reviewed several issues: attitudes towards the Central Council of Ukraine, war and peace as well as about organization of military force, about Ukraine and Soviet Russia, estate and financial issues and others.

The congress approved the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] between [[Russian SFSR]] and [[Central Powers]], declared the independence of the Soviet Ukrainian People's Republic as a federative republic of Soviet Russia, Law about socialization of land adopted by the 3rd All-Russian Congress of Soviets, "About state system", decrees on 8-hour work day and labor control, organization of the Workers-Peasant Red Army of Ukraine. The policy of the [[Central Council of Ukraine]] in the resolution "About political moment" was condemned requesting withdrawal of the Austrian and German Armed Forces from Ukraine. Participants elected the new composition of the [[Central Executive Committee of Ukraine]] of 102 members headed by [[Vladimir Zatonsky]].

===Second Congress (Katerynoslav)===
The Second All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets took place in Katerynoslav.

===Transformation===
The Congress ceased to exist at the end of the constitutional reform of 1936-1937, when the first on the [[Soviet Union|union]] and then at the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|republican]] levels [[indirect election]] to Soviets were replaced by [[direct election]]s at all levels with the [[Supreme Soviet]] as the highest body.

The '''Army Plots''' of 1641 were two real or alleged attempts by Royalist supporters of [[Charles I of England]] to use the army to crush dissent among members of the English parliament in the run-up to the [[English Civil War]]. The plan was to move the army stationed in York down to London and to use it to reassert royal authority. It was also claimed that the plotters were seeking French military aid and that they planned to seize and fortify towns to become Royalist strongholds.

The exposure of the plots by leading Parliamentarians such as [[John Pym]] allowed the Parliament faction to gain the upper hand by imprisoning or forcing into exile many of the king's supporters, including his wife [[Henrietta Maria]]. According to Conrad Russell, it remains unclear "who plotted with whom to do what" and that "Charles I's plots, like his grandmother's lovers, are capable of growing in the telling".{{sfn|Russell|1988|pp=85–106}} Nevertheless, there were clearly real attempts to negotiate the movement of troops to London.

==First Army Plot==
[[File:Mountjoy Blount, 1st Earl of Newport; George Goring, Baron Goring by Sir Anthony Van Dyck.jpg|thumb|George Goring (right) with Mountjoy Blount, to whom he revealed details of the First Army Plot]]
The so-called "first army plot" unfolded between March and May 1641. It emerged after discontent in the English army with parliament grew following the grant of funds for the Scottish army which had earlier been intended for the English. [[George Goring, Lord Goring|George Goring]] proposed that the army at York should march south to threaten Parliament. The poet-soldiers [[William Davenant]] and [[John Suckling (poet)|John Suckling]], along with [[Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans|Henry Jermyn]], supported the move and hoped to occupy the Tower of London.{{sfn|Russell|1988|pp=85–106}} This was linked to a plan to free the king's supporter, [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]], who had been imprisoned in the Tower by Parliament. Meanwhile, [[Henry Percy, Baron Percy of Alnwick|Henry Percy]] was also independently planning to petition Parliament for financial support for the army.

At a meeting with the king and queen, Percy and Goring discussed the proposal to bring the main army south.{{sfn|Russell|1988|pp=85–106}} Rumours began to circulate that the king would take command of the army and that French troops would be sent in support. However, the main body of the soldiery refused to accept the proposals and so it was abandoned. Goring told [[Mountjoy Blount, 1st Earl of Newport]], of the plans. Blount passed on the information indirectly to leading Parliamentarian [[John Pym]] in April. Davenant and Suckling, however, still planned to seize the Tower. Soldiers loyal to the king were placed in position, but the situation soon became known to Parliament, and a stand-off developed. Soldiers loyal to Parliament quickly took control of the Tower.

In the ensuing investigation, much was made of claims that the king and queen were plotting to obtain French military support. It was claimed that the queen had diverted her personal funds to the port of Portsmouth, of which Goring was in command, in order to turn it into a Royalist fortress.{{sfn|Ashley|1976}} Evidence was also produced that the king was gathering funds to win military men over to his side.{{sfn|Russell|1988|pp=85–106}}

As soon as the plot was discovered Percy sought to flee to France, but was assaulted and wounded by country people in Sussex. He was forced to go into hiding. He wrote a letter to his brother, giving an account of events, which the Parliamentarians later used as proof of the reality of the plot. After his capture, he tried to blame others. Royalists condemned him for betraying the King.{{sfn|Firth|1895|p=413}} Goring too distanced himself from the plans of Davenant and Suckling. His submission to Parliament allowed him to retain control of Portsmouth. Davenant, Jermyn and Suckling all fled to France, where Suckling died shortly afterwards, probably by suicide.{{sfn|Davidson|1998|p=607}} The failure of the plot contributed to the condemnation and execution of Strafford as a traitor, and alienated many moderate Royalists from the king.{{sfn|Russell|1988|pp=85–106}}

==Second Army Plot==
[[File:LongParliament.jpg|thumb|The [[Long Parliament]] in session]]
A few months after the first plot, there were claims that a second plot to bring the army south in support of royal power was in motion. In May, the king had sent [[Daniel O'Neill (Royalist)|Daniel O'Neill]] to negotiate with army leaders, suggesting that they might move their forces south to "protect" both the king and moderate parliamentarians.{{sfn|Carpenter|2004|p=34}} O'Neill also sought to ensure that Scottish leaders would remain neutral (Scotland was still a separate kingdom, but Charles was king in both England and Scotland). Pym sought to rally support to put local militias on alert against the proposed move, which again failed to find sufficient support among army commanders.{{sfn|Fritze|Robison|1996|p=28}}

[[William Legge (MP)|William Legge]], who had been questioned after the first plot, was directly involved with the second. Along with two other M.P.s, [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester]] was expelled from the [[Long Parliament]] in December 1641 for alleged complicity in the Second Army Plot and was placed under arrest. O'Neill escaped to France, but soon returned and was arrested and imprisoned. This time Percy was also expelled from the House of Commons in December, after which he too left for France.{{sfn|Firth|1895|p=413}}

==Consequences==
The two army plots had the effect of hardening the differences between the two sides, and ultimately of strengthening the Parliamentary cause by allowing Parliament to gauge the extent of support for the king among army commanders. Pym was also able to establish the conditions for militias and pro-Parliamentary factions to defend towns potentially threatened by the Royalists. Leading Royalists were either forced into exile or deprived of power, further strengthening Parliament's hand.

The events made it increasingly clear that the king would not be able to impose his will with a threat of force. His attempt to arrest his leading opponents in Parliament without army backing in January 1642, was an abject failure.{{sfn|Sherwood|1997|p={{page needed|date=May 2016}} }} He fled from London to his strongholds in the Midlands a few days later.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1970|pp=57, 107}} The queen left the country. When Charles made clear his intention to fight, Goring, still in control of Portsmouth, immediately declared in favour of the king.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1970|pp=57, 107}} Jermyn and Davenant both returned to England to join the king. O'Neill escaped from prison in 1642 dressed as a woman, and also joined the Royalists. Percy and Wilmot joined the Royalists, but eventually fell out of Charles' favour for advocating negotiations with Parliament.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1819">The '''Asia Region Funds Passport''' is an economic initiative to provide regional management of funds throughout member states in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. http://fundspassport.apec.org/about/ accessed on 17 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It is led by Australia, Singapore, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea, all of whom signed a Statement of Intent on 20 September 2013 at the APEC Finance Ministers’ meeting in Nusa Dua, Bali.

The ministers from these economies signed with a view that their economies can potentially become members of the passport once it is launched in 2016, and that they agree with the principles set out in the framework document. This document forms the basis of the future passport arrangements.

The possibility exists for the passport to grow beyond Asia to Europe, if a mutual recognition agreement is signed.

==History==
The passport was first mentioned in the 2010 Johnson report by the [[Australian Financial Centre Forum]].

PWC released a report commissioned by the Australian Financial Services Council in November 2010, that provided a qualitative analysis of reception to the ARFP idea and potential upside.

In partnership with Volguard,&lt;ref&gt;Asia Region Funds Passport- A Study of Potential Economic Benefits and Costs, http://www.volguard.com/General/Pages/PricesMarketDetail.aspx?id=2325&amp;t=2037 accessed on 18 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; APEC published a [http://publications.apec.org/publication-detail.php?pub_id=1535 quantitative study] in July 2014, of the economic benefits and costs of the ARFP to the individual economies and the Asia region. Through the extensive assessment conducted by Volguard Analytics, the potential gains from the ARFP were measured against their potential risks.

{{Politics of Venezuela}}
{{Revolution sidebar}}
The '''Bolivarian Revolution''' is a political process in [[Venezuela]] led by late [[President of Venezuela|Venezuelan President]] [[Hugo Chávez]], the founder of the [[Fifth Republic Movement]] and later the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela|United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV)]]. The Bolivarian Revolution is named after [[Simón Bolívar]], an early 19th-century Venezuelan and [[Latin America]]n revolutionary leader, prominent in the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] in achieving the independence of most of northern South America from Spanish rule. According to Chávez and other supporters, the Bolivarian Revolution seeks to build an inter-American coalition to implement [[Bolivarianism]], nationalism and a state-led economy.

On his 57th birthday, while announcing that he was being treated for cancer, Chávez announced that he had changed the slogan of the Bolivarian Revolution from "Motherland, socialism, or death" to "Socialist motherland and victory. We will live, and we will come out victorious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aponte-Moreno|first=Marco|author2=Lance Lattig|title=Chavez: Rhetoric Made in Havana|journal=World Policy Journal|issue=Spring 2012|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/spring2012/ch%C3%A1vez-rhetoric-made-havana|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, the vast majority mayoral and gubernatorial offices are held by PSUV candidates, while the opposition Democratic Unity (MUD) coalition won two thirds of parliamentary seats in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-19652436|title=Venezuela profile – Timeline|date=2017-04-26|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-05-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political hostility between the PSUV and MUD have lead to several incidents where both pro-government and opposition demonstrations have turned violent, with an estimated 150 dead as a result in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-idUSKBN17U2TY|title=Venezuelan opposition activists march to Leopoldo Lopez' jail|date=2017-04-28|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there are claims and counterclaims relating to the imprisonment of opposition figures, with the government claiming that their political status neither impedes nor motivates prosecution for the crimes that they have been convicted of, while the opposition claims that these arrests and charges are politically motivated.

== Background ==
{{further information|Bolivarianism}}
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}
Simón Bolívar has left a long lasting imprint on [[History of Venezuela|Venezuela's history]] in particular and South America in general. 

As a military cadet, Hugo Chávez was "a celebrant of the Bolivarian passion story".&lt;ref&gt;Enrique Krauze, [http://www.tnr.com/booksarts/story.html?id=38435d75-d7c7-45dc-9dbe-4625056d42b6 "The Shah of Venezuela"], ''[[The New Republic]]'', 1 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Chávez relied upon the ideas of Bolívar and on Bolívar as a popular symbol later in his military career as he put together his [[Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200|MBR-200]] movement which would become a vehicle for his [[1992 Venezuelan coup d'état attempts|1992 coup-attempt]].

South America in the late 1980s and early 1990s was just recovering from the [[Latin American debt crisis]] of the mid-1980s and many governments had adopted [[austerity]] and [[privatization]] policies to finance [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) loans. Following the end of the [[Cold War]] and the fall of the [[military dictatorships]] in Brazil, Argentina, [[Chilean transition to democracy|Chile]] and Uruguay, social movements including [[trade unionism|labor]] and [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] currents&lt;ref&gt;[[Marta Harnecker]], A World to Build. New York: [[Monthly Review]] Press, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; opposed the austerity and called for debt forgiveness, sometimes resulting in clashes with the state (see [[Caracazo]] and [[2000 Ecuadorian coup d'état]]). It was in this context that Chávez and MBR-200 (as the [[Fifth Republic Movement]]) won the [[Venezuelan presidential election, 1998|1998 elections]] and initiated the constituent process that resulted in the [[Constitution of Venezuela|Venezuelan Constitution of 1999]].

== Policies ==
{{details|Economic policy of the Hugo Chávez government}}

=== Domestic ===
''[[Chavismo]]'' policies include [[nationalization]], [[Welfare|social welfare programs]] ([[Bolivarian missions]]) and opposition to [[neoliberalism]] (particularly the policies of the IMF and the [[World Bank]]). According to Hugo Chávez, Venezuelan socialism accepts [[private property]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sivaramakrishnan|first=Arvind|title=Hugo Chávez: Death of a socialist|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/hugo-chvez-death-of-a-socialist/article4481169.ece|accessdate=3 February 2014|newspaper=The Hindu|date=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this [[socialism]] seeks to promote [[common ownership|social property]] too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Salmerón|first=Víctor|title=Plan Chávez prevé crear 30 mil empresas de propiedad social|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/economia/120613/plan-chavez-preve-crear-30-mil-empresas-de-propiedad-social|accessdate=3 February 2014|newspaper=El Universal|date=13 June 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chavismo'' also support [[participatory democracy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La democracia participativa es un concepto chavista|url=http://www.correodelorinoco.gob.ve/nacionales/democracia-participativa-es-un-concepto-chavista/|accessdate=3 February 2014|newspaper=Correo del Orinoco|date=16 November 2013|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[workplace democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Albrecht|first=Hermann|title=Chavez Calls on Workers to Push for Workplace Democracy in Venezuela|url=http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/4478|accessdate=3 February 2014|newspaper=Venezuelanalysis.com|date=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, Chávez proposed to build the communal state, whose main idea is to build self-government institutions like [[Venezuelan Communal Councils|communal councils]], [[Commune (socialism)|communes]] and communal cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Azzellini|first=Dario|title=The Communal State: Communal Councils, Communes, and Workplace Democracy|url=https://nacla.org/article/communal-state-communal-councils-communes-and-workplace-democracy|publisher=North American Congress on Latin America|accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International ===
According to the [[United States Army Combined Arms Center]]:&lt;ref name="MILreviewVEN"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Colmenares|first1=Leopoldo E.

Chávez's plan was characterized by a hostile and confrontational posture toward the United States, actions designed to export Chávez's autocratic, socialist model to other countries of the region, and a foreign policy that embroiled Venezuela in international-level conflicts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chávez was seen as a leader of the "[[pink tide]]", a turn towards left-wing governments in Latin American democracies.&lt;ref name="NOVA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PROMISING"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reid|first1=Michael|title=Obama and Latin America: A Promising Day in the Neighborhood|journal=''[[Foreign Affairs]]''|date=Sep–Oct 2015|volume=94|issue=5|pages=45–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts have pointed out additional [[anti-Americanism|anti-American]],&lt;ref name="NOVA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=da Cruz|first1=Jose de Arimateia|title=Strategic Insights: From Ideology to Geopolitics: Russian Interests in Latin America|journal=Current Politics and Economics of Russia, Eastern and Central Europe|publisher=[[Nova Science Publishers]]|date=2015|volume=30|issue=1/2|pages=175–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Left-wing populism|populist]]&lt;ref name="ISBESTER"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Isbester|first1=Katherine|title=The Paradox of Democracy in Latin America: Ten Country Studies of Division and Resilience|date=2011|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=978-1442601802|page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boston"&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/01/14/the_many_stripes_of_anti_americanism/] Boston Globe: The many stripes of anti-Americanism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4311957.stm] BBC News: South America's leftward sweep&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pitts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_310062.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516065906/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_310062.html |archivedate=16 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }} Pittsburg Tribune-Herald: Latin America's 'pragmatic' pink tide&lt;/ref&gt; and [[authoritarian]]-leaning traits in those governments.&lt;ref name="ISBESTER"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TRIB"&gt;{{cite news|title=Once Saudi Venezuela, now a 'pink tide' casualty|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-venezuela-economy-pink-tide-chavez-maduro-edit-0701-md-20160630-story.html|accessdate=30 June 2016|agency=''[[The Chicago Tribune]]''|date=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bolivarian missions ==
{{main article|Bolivarian missions}}
{{Bolivarian Missions}}
The social programs (called "missions" in Venezuela) that came into being during the term of Hugo Chávez sought to reduce social disparities and were funded in large part by oil revenues. The sustainability and design of the welfare programs have been both praised and criticized. Specific examples of social programs are listed below.&lt;ref name=BBC2009&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/specials/2009/chavez_10/newsid_7837000/7837964.stm|title=Entre los números y la realidad |last=Justo|first=Marcelo|publisher=''[[BBC]]''|date=27 January 2009|accessdate=31 January 2009|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plan Bolívar 2000 ===
{{main article|Plan Bolívar 2000}}
Plan Bolívar 2000 was the first of the Bolivarian Missions enacted under of administration of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. According to the [[United States Department of State]], Chávez wanted to "send the message that the military was not a force of popular repression, but rather a force for development and security". The United States State Department also commented that this happened "only 23 days after his inauguration" and that he wanted to show his closest supporters "that he had not forgotten them".&lt;ref name=USb2000&gt;{{cite web|title=Venezuelan Soldiers Leave Their Barracks ... To Implement Chavez's Civil-Military Public Works Program |url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/143547.pdf|publisher=United States Department of State|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan involved around 40,000 [[Venezuelan Army|Venezuelan soldiers]] engaged in door-to-door anti-poverty activities, including mass vaccinations, food distribution in [[slum]] areas and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilpert|first=Gregory|title=Venezuela's Mission to Fight Poverty|url=http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/213|publisher=venezuelanalysis.com|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[scandal]]s affected the program as allegations of corruption were formulated against Generals involved in the plan, arguing that significant amounts of money had been diverted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.analitica.com/va/politica/opinion/6999189.asp Opinión y análisis – ¿Sabe el Ejército de Corrupción?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306040647/http://www.analitica.com/va/politica/opinion/6999189.asp |date=6 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mission Barrio Adentro ===
{{main article|Mission Barrio Adentro}}
The mission was to provide comprehensive [[publicly funded health care]], [[Dentistry|dental care]] and [[Sports medicine|sports training]] to [[Poverty|poor]] and marginalized communities in [[Venezuela]]. ''Barrio Adentro'' featured the construction of thousands of iconic two-story medical clinics—''consultorios'' or doctor’s offices—as well as staffing with resident certified medical professionals. ''Barrio Adentro'' constitutes an attempt to deliver a ''[[de facto]]'' form of [[universal health care]], seeking to guarantee access to quality and cradle-to-grave medical attention for all Venezuelan [[Citizenship|citizens]]. As of 2006, the staff included 31,439 professionals, technical personnel, and health technicians, of which 15,356 were Cuban doctors and 1,234 Venezuelan doctors. The Latin American branch of the [[World Health Organization]] and [[UNICEF]] both praised the program.&lt;ref name="WHO_2005"&gt;{{Harv|World Health Organization|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNICEF_2005"&gt;{{Harv|UNICEF|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Though positive outcomes have come from the mission, there have been some struggles as well. In July 2007, Douglas León Natera, chairman of the Venezuelan Medical Federation, reported that up to 70% of the modules of Barrio Adentro were either abandoned or were left unfinished. In 2014, residents in Caracas also complained of the service despite large funding from the Venezuelan government.&lt;ref&gt;Matheus, Ricardo.

=== Mission Habitat ===
{{main article|Mission Habitat}}
Mission Habitat's goal is the construction of thousands of new housing units for the poor. The program also seeks to develop agreeable and integrated housing zones that make available a full range of social services—from education to healthcare—which likens its vision to that of [[New Urbanism]]. According to Venezuela's ''[[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]]'', one of the Chávez administration's outstanding weaknesses is the failure to meet its goals of construction of housing. Chávez promised to build 150,000 houses in 2006, but in the first half of the year completed only 24 percent of that target, with 35,000 houses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.eluniversal.com/2006/07/31/en_eco_art_31A756381.shtml Chávez' Government has built 24 percent of scheduled houses.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411130530/http://english.eluniversal.com/2006/07/31/en_eco_art_31A756381.shtml |date=11 April 2008 }} ''El Universal'' (July 31, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mission involves a state-run company called Mercados de Alimentos, C.A. (MERCAL), which provides subsidised food and basic goods through a nationwide chain of stores. In 2010 Mercal was reported as having 16,600 outlets, "ranging from street-corner shops to huge warehouse stores", in addition to 6,000 soup kitchens. Mercal employs 85,000 workers.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Business Week]]'', March 11, 2010, [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_12/b4171046603604.htm A Food Fight for Hugo Chavez]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, some 11.36 million Venezuelans benefited from Mercal food programs on a regular basis.

=== Mission Robinson ===
{{main article|Mission Robinson}}
The program uses volunteers to teach reading, writing and arithmetic to the more than 1.5 million Venezuelan adults who were illiterate prior to Chávez's election to the presidency in 1999. The program is military-civilian in nature and sends soldiers to—among other places—remote and dangerous locales in order to reach the most undereducated, neglected and marginalized adult citizens to give them regular schooling and lessons. On 28 October 2005, Venezuela declared itself a "Territory Free of Illiteracy", having raised in its initial estimates the literacy rate to around 99%, although the statistic was changed to 96%.&lt;ref name=ECONread/&gt; According to [[UNESCO]] standards, a country can be declared "illiteracy-free" if 96% of its population over age 15 can read and write.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7794293.stm|title=Bolivia declares literacy success|date=|accessdate=27 August 2015|website=|publisher=BBC News|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Francisco Rodríguez (economist)|Francisco Rodríguez]] and Daniel Ortega of IESA, there has been "little evidence" of "statistically distinguishable effect on Venezuelan illiteracy".&lt;ref name=ECONread&gt;{{cite news|title=Propaganda, not policy|url=http://www.economist.com/node/10766504|accessdate=3 May 2014|newspaper=The Economist|date=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Venezuelan government claimed that it had taught 1.5 million Venezuelans to read,&lt;ref name="Márquez"&gt;{{cite web|last=Márquez|first=Humberto|title=Venezuela se declara libre de analfabetismo|publisher=[[Inter Press Service]]|url=http://ipsnoticias.net/nota.asp?idnews=35621|date=28 October 2005|accessdate=29 December 2006|language=es|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SKR8WGpN?url=http://www.ipsnoticias.net/2005/10/educacion-venezuela-se-declara-libre-de-analfabetismo/|archivedate=4 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the study found that "only 1.1m were illiterate to begin with" and that the illiteracy reduction of less than 100,000 can be attributed to adults that were elderly and died.&lt;ref name=ECONread/&gt; David Rosnick and [[Mark Weisbrot]] of the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research|Center for Economic and Pplicy Research]] responded to these doubts, finding that the data used by Rodríguez and Ortega was too crude a measure since the Household Survey from which it derived was never designed to measure literacy or reading skills and their methods were inappropriate to provide statistical evidence regarding the size of Venezuela's national literacy program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/literacy_2008_05.pdf|title="Illiteracy" Revisited: What Ortega and Rodríguez Read in the Household Survey|date=May 2008|accessdate=27 August 2015|website=Center|publisher=Center for Economic and Policy Research|last=Rosnick|first=David|last2=Weisbrot|first2=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodríguez responded to Weisbrot's rebuttal by showing that Weisbrot used biased, distorted data and that the illiteracy argument Weisbrot used showed the exact opposite of what Weisbrot was attempting to convey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Francisco|title=How Not to Defend the Revolution: Mark Weisbrot and the Misinterpretation of Venezuelan Evidence|url=http://frrodriguez.web.wesleyan.edu/docs/working_papers/How_Not_to_Defend.pdf|website=[[Wesleyan University]]|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But with the price of oil as low as $35 a barrel recently, it's long been on its way to total collapse.

According to [[Human Rights Watch]] &lt;blockquote&gt;To silence critics, the government has conducted widespread arrests and other repression.

Following the Bolivarian Revolution, many wealthy Venezuelans have sought residence in other countries. According to ''[[Newsweek]]'', the "Bolivarian [[diaspora]] is a reversal of fortune on a massive scale" where the reversal is a comparison to when in the 20th century "Venezuela was a haven for immigrants fleeing Old World repression and intolerance".&lt;ref name=NEWSWEEKdiaspora&gt;{{cite news|title=Hugo Chavez is Scaring Away Talent|url=http://www.newsweek.com/hugo-chavez-scaring-away-talent-80337|accessdate=24 September 2014|agency=Newsweek|date=30 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]]'' explains how the "Bolivarian diaspora" in Venezuela has been caused by the "deterioration of both the economy and the social fabric, rampant crime, uncertainty and lack of hope for a change in leadership in the near future".&lt;ref name=EUdiaspora&gt;{{cite news|last1=Olivares|first1=Francisco|title=Best and brightest for export|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/140913/best-and-brightest-for-export|accessdate=24 September 2014|agency=El Universal|date=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the year Chavez was first elected, only 14 Venezuelans were granted asylum in the United States.

The '''Breton Liberation Front''' ({{lang-br|Talbenn Dieubiñ Breizh}}, {{lang-fr|Front de Libération de la Bretagne}} or '''FLB''') is a militant group founded in 1963 to promote the "liberation of [[Brittany]] from [[France]]". Brittany is a province in northwest France, and formed an independent [[Duchy of Brittany]] until the treaty of union in 1532.

==History==
Breton Nationalism had been a significant force in the early 20th century through the [[Breton National Party]], but it has been discredited by its association with collaborationism in [[World War II]]. The FLB represented a new wave of nationalist politics associated with anti-colonialist ideology. The group claimed that Brittany was oppressed by France acting as a colonial power.&lt;ref&gt;Jack E. Reece, ''The Bretons against France: ethnic minority nationalism in twentieth-century Brittany'', [[University of North Carolina Press]], 1977, p.204.&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizens of Brittany, or, Bretons, retain their own national identity including an independent language from that of France, music and other cultural details. Bretons&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-04-15|title=Bretons|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bretons&amp;oldid=775470081|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; are considered an ethnic Celtic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-05-06|title=Celtic nations|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Celtic_nations&amp;oldid=779087100|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; group with English, German and French roots.

The group was linked to surviving members of earlier nationalist groups, notably [[Yann Goulet]], who was operating from Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Michael John Christopher O'Callaghan, Separatism in Brittany, Dyllansow Truran, 1983, p.77-83&lt;/ref&gt; The first known FLB attack occurred in June 1966 when a municipal tax office in [[Saint-Brieuc]] was bombed, and a note signed by the FLB claimed that they would continue to carry out a campaign of violence against these "occupying symbols of Brittany."

In the following years, the FLB carried out attacks against administrative structures, such as electrical installations, police barracks and statues—mainly by bombing them. The number of attacks peaked in 1968. However, the FLB ensured that no physical injuries or deaths would result from their attacks, which they wished to remain purely symbolic. In this they followed the model of the earlier group [[Gwenn ha du (terrorism)|Gwenn ha du]]. They thus gained a reputation in the international community as the "smiling terrorists." There are even reports that the only two known FLB victims during this period were two FLB members themselves, who were killed while trying to defuse a bomb they were afraid may hurt civilians.

Factions in the FLB emerged in the early 1970s, leading to the creation of the militant [[Breton Revolutionary Army]] (''Armée révolutionnaire bretonne'', or ARB). This group acted separately from the FLB and proved to be the durable faction that still exists today. There were several Breton liberation groups that were distinct from the FLB.

The first known FLB attack occurred in June 1966 when a municipal tax office in Saint-Brieuc was bombed, and a note signed by the FLB claimed that they would continue to carry out a campaign of violence against these "occupying symbols of Brittany." In the following years, the FLB carried out attacks against administrative structures, such as electrical installations, police barracks and statues—mainly by bombing them. Though the group peaked in 1968 there have been attacks reported as recently as 2014 using incineration tactics. .

The FLB ensured that no physical injuries or deaths would result from their attacks, which they wished to remain purely symbolic; in this they followed the model of the earlier group Gwenn ha du,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Gwenn ha du (Breton paramilitary group|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwenn_ha_du_(Breton_paramilitary_group|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded 1930. There are reports that the only two known FLB victims during this period were two FLB members themselves, who were killed while trying to defuse a bomb they were afraid may hurt civilians. They thus gained a reputation in the international community as the "smiling terrorists."

One of their most notorious acts was the [[1978 Palace of Versailles bombing|1978 bombing of the Palace of Versailles]].

=== Trials and Police intervention ===
It was in 1969 that the police intervened, confiscating propaganda and weaponry. More than 60 people were arrested, those directly involved in previous attacks were given brief sentences, however within a few months many had been granted amnesty, or pardons, and released. Although created by young Bretons in the early 1960s, the FLB enjoyed popular support, evident during these arrests which revealed that members came from very diverse backgrounds: businessmen, housewives, students, farmers, and even clergy.

Though most had favorable outcomes for the organization, trials bolstered the Breton "liberation" movement as the trials were perceived to be further suppressive action by the government. This period was also marked with a rise in the number of students enrolling in Breton language courses, as being able to speak Breton was seen as legitimizing one's position as a Breton militant.

== Notable Leaders ==
'''''Yann Fouere'''''

Main article: [[Yann Fouéré]]

Yann was a prominent force in the Breton Liberation Front, so much so that he fled to Ireland 1948, seeking political asylum. He was an author, businessman and, in some ways politician. In 1999 he formed the "Party for the Organization of Free Brittany" which he led until 2004.

Yann was involved in a "Pro-German witch Hunt" in 1944, where he was held in custody for a year. Upon escape, he was sheltered by fellow Nationalists in Wales. While hidden he was sentenced to life in prison and was forced out of Brittany and into the Republic of Ireland, where he secured citizenship. In 1955 He was given a retrial in France and came back, innocent, to form the "Movement for the Organization of Brittany."

In 1973 Yann ran for political office, lost, then was arrested two years later for involvement with the Breton Liberation Front's bombings. He was released conditionally until 1979 when he and 22 others were charged with security-related offences .

He died in Ireland at 101 years old in 2011, where he spent his last days advocating for Breton Nationalism and avoiding being tried as a "wartime collaborator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-08-27|title=Party for the Organization of a Free Brittany|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Party_for_the_Organization_of_a_Free_Brittany&amp;oldid=678063560|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

The '''Centre for European Democracy Studies''' was established in [[Brussels]] in 2008 by a group of researchers studying [[Europe]]'s political history and the current state of [[democracy]] in the continent. The research establishment serves as a place of regular events covering studies of the European democracy institution, key threats existing today, as well as countries on the way to democracy establishment and development in Europe. 

The Centre holds conferences, workshops and other events resulting in formulation of recommendations to the European governmental authorities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/ www.europarl.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; and public [[organization]]s aiming to strengthen the democracy and political stability fundamentals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6276">The '''Child and Adult Care Food Program''' ('''CACFP''') is a type of [[United States]] [[federal assistance]] provided by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) to [[U.S. state|states]] in order to provide a daily subsidized food service for an estimated 3.3 million children and 120,000 elderly or mentally or physically impaired adults&lt;ref name="USDA"&gt;[http://www.fns.usda.gov/cacfp/child-and-adult-care-food-program Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP)], Child and Adult Care Food Program Homepage, [[Food and Nutrition Service]], [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]&lt;/ref&gt; in non-residential, day-care settings. It is a branch within the Policy and Program Development Division of the [[Child nutrition programs]], along with the School Programs Branch, which runs the [[National School Lunch Act|National School Lunch Program]].&lt;ref name="OMB_CACFP"&gt;''Child and Adult Care Food Program'' (CFDA 10.558); [http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a133_compliance/06/06toc.html OMB Circular A-133 Compliance Supplement]; Part 4: Agency Program Requirements: Department of Housing and Urban Development, pg. 4-10.558-1&lt;/ref&gt; The program is commonly referred to as the '''Child Care''', '''Child Care Food''', '''Adult Care''', or '''Adult Care Food''' Program, and is often operating in conjunction with other child and adult day-care programs, such as the [[Head Start Program|Head Start]]. Its federal identification number, or [[Federal assistance in the United States#Catalog_of_Federal_Domestic_Assistance#CFDA_number|CFDA number]], is 10.558.&lt;ref name="OMB_CACFP"/&gt; Section 17 of the [[National School Lunch Act]], and USDA issues the program regulations under 7 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] part 226.&lt;ref name="FNS"&gt;[http://www.fns.usda.gov/cacfp/why-cacfp-important], Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP): Why CACFP Is Important &lt;/ref&gt;

==Program benefits==
The program’s benefits consist of nutritious meals and snacks served to eligible children and adults who are enrolled for care at participating child care centers, adult day care centers, outside-school-hours care centers, after-school at-risk programs, family and group day care homes, and homeless and emergency shelters. These centers and shelters can be public and private non-profit centers, proprietary organizations, schools, private homes, and elderly centers, among others, on condition that they all comply with federal, state and local licensing and approval requirements.&lt;ref name="OMB_CACFP"/&gt; Through CACFP, children and older adults gain access to "nutritious foods that contribute to the wellness, healthy growth, and development of young children, and the health and wellness of older adults and chronically impaired disabled persons."&lt;ref name="USDA"/&gt;

==Administration==
The USDA's [[Food and Nutrition Service]] (FNS) administers the program through [[Federal grant|grants-in-aid]] to states. The program is administered within most states by its designated educational agency, such as New York’s Education Department. In certain states, the program is administered by an alternate agency, such as the state department of health, family and/or social services.  At the discretion of the state’s governor, different agencies may administer the program’s child-care and adult day-care components, such as Wildwood C.A.C.F.P in Colorado. In the [[state of Virginia]], the program is directly administered by the Food and Nutrition Service Mid-Atlantic Regional Office (MARO).&lt;ref name="OMB_CACFP"/&gt;

Actual federal assistance provided to states and their designated agencies are in the form of cash reimbursement for meals served, and any other donation by the USDA to provide such meals. Program funds are provided to states through letters of credit issued under the FNS Agency Financial Management System.  The states, in turn, use the funds to reimburse institutions for costs of actual operations (e.g., providing meals), as well as to support state administrative expenses. Generally, a state’s claim to cash reimbursement from the USDA is computed by first determining the number of meals served (by category and type), and multiplying the amount of service by a per-unit payment rate, also known as the “reimbursement rate.” The “type” of meal refers to the kind of meal service for which the institution seeks reimbursement, such as breakfasts, lunches, snacks, supplements, and dinners served. The “category” refers to the type of economic need of the child or adult to whom a meal is served, which can be categorized as “paid,” “reduced price,” or “free” meals.&lt;ref name="OMB_CACFP"/&gt;

Child-care, adult day-care, and outside-school-hours centers may charge a single fee to cover tuition, meals, and all other day care services to recoup certain costs; however, the vast majority of these centers operate non-pricing (free) programs. Nevertheless, all institutions must determine the eligibility of children and adults enrolled at these centers (e.g. ,low-income, mentally or physically disabled, etc.) for free or [[reduced price meal]]s because such eligibility determinations affect the reimbursement rates for meals served to the participants. Homeless children residing at a participating homeless shelter are considered categorically eligible for meals served by that shelter. After-school at-risk programs, emergency shelters, and family day care homes are prohibited from charging separately for meals.&lt;ref name="OMB_CACFP"/&gt;

'''Christopher Ofili''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE}} known as '''Chris Ofili''' (born 10 October 1968), is a [[Nigerian British]] [[Turner Prize]]-winning painter who is best known for his paintings incorporating elephant dung. He was one of the [[Young British Artists]]. Since 2005, Ofili has been living and working in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], where he currently resides in [[Port of Spain]]. He also lives and works in [[London]] and [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;[[Calvin Tomkins]] (6 October 2014), [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/06/unknown-6 "Into the Unknown: Chris Ofili returns to New York with a major retrospective"], ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Ofili was born in [[Manchester]] to May and Michael Ofili. When he was eleven, his father left the family and moved back to [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; Ofili was for some years educated at St. Pius X High School for Boys, and then at [[Xaverian College]] in [[Victoria Park, Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/artist/12782/chris-ofili.html Chris Ofili Brief biography] on ham. Retrieval Date: 26 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Ofili completed a foundation course in art at [[Tameside College]] in [[Ashton-under-Lyne]] in Greater Manchester&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; and then studied in [[London]], at the [[Chelsea School of Art]] from 1988 to 1991 and at the [[Royal College of Art]] from 1991 to 1993. In the fall of 1992, he got a one-year exchange scholarship to [[Berlin University of the Arts|Universität der Künste Berlin]].&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt;

Ofili visited [[Trinidad]] for the first time in 2000, when he was invited by an international art trust to attend a painting workshop in Port of Spain.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; He permanently moved to Trinidad in 2005. He lives with his wife Roba, former singer with [[trip-hop]] band [[Attica Blues (band)|Attica Blues]],&lt;ref name="Attica"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mowaxplease.com/exclusive-an-interview-with-charlie-dark-of-attica-blues/ | title=AN INTERVIEW WITH CHARLIE DARK OF ATTICA BLUES | publisher=Mo Wax Please | accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom he married in 2002.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; He maintains a studio on Lady Chancellor Road, about ten minutes from downtown Port of Spain, in Trinidad.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt;

==Career==
Ofili's early work was heavily influenced by [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Georg Baselitz]], [[Philip Guston]], and [[George Condo]].&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; [[Peter Doig]] was doing graduate work at the [[Chelsea College of Arts]] when Ofili was an undergraduate, and they soon became friends.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; In 2014, art critic [[Roberta Smith]] held that Ofili has much in common with painters like [[Mickalene Thomas]], [[Kerry James Marshall]], [[Robert Colescott]] and [[Ellen Gallagher]], and with more distant precedents such as [[Bob Thompson (painter)|Bob Thompson]], [[Beauford Delaney]] and [[William Johnson (artist)|William H. Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberta Smith]] (October 30, 2014), [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/arts/design/chris-ofili-night-and-day-a-survey-at-the-new-museum.html "Medium and Message, Both Unsettling: ‘Chris Ofili: Night and Day,’ a Survey at the New Museum"], ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ofili was established through exhibitions by [[Charles Saatchi]] at his gallery in north London and the travelling exhibition ''[[Sensation exhibition|Sensation]]'' (1997), becoming recognised as one of the few British artists of African / Caribbean descent to break through as a member of the [[Young British Artists]] group. Ofili has also had numerous solo shows since the early 1990s, including at the [[Serpentine Gallery]]. In 1998, Ofili won the [[Turner Prize]], and in 2003 he was selected to represent Britain at the [[Venice Biennale]] of that year, where his work for the British Pavilion was done in collaboration with the architect [[David Adjaye]].

In 1992 he won a scholarship that allowed him to travel to [[Zimbabwe]]. Ofili studied [[cave painting]]s there, which had some effect on his style.

Between 1995 and 2005, Ofili focused on a series of watercolors, each about 9½ by 6½ inches and produced in a single sitting.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kimmelman]] (May 8, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/08/arts/design/08kimm.html "Wake Up. Wash Face. Do Routine. Now Paint"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; They predominantly feature heads of men and women, as well as some studies of flowers and birds.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Carol Vogel (5 May 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/05/arts/05ofil.html "An Artist's Gallery of Ideas: Chris Ofili's Watercolors"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ofili's paintings also make reference to [[blaxploitation]] films and [[gangsta rap]], seeking to question racial and sexual stereotypes in a humorous way. In a series of faces that Ofili called ''Harems'', each arrangement consists of one man with as many as four women on each side of him.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Ofili's work is often built up in layers of paint, resin, glitter, dung (mainly elephant) and other materials to create a [[collage]]. Though Ofili's detractors often state that he "splatters"&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20000227/ai_n14292995 ''The Independent'', February 27, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; elephant [[Feces|dung]] on his pictures, this is inaccurate: he sometimes applies it directly to the canvas in the form of dried spherical lumps, and sometimes, in the same form, uses it as varnished foot-like supports on which the paintings stand.

Ofili has been founder and prime mover behind the short-lived ''Freeness Project''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A5861432 ''Free stuff''] by James Cowdery, 22 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This project involved the coming together of artists, producers and musicians of minority ethnic groups (Asian and African) in an attempt to expose the music that may be unheard in other spaces. Freeness allowed the creativity of unsigned contemporary British ethnic minority artists to be heard. The result of months of tours to 10 cities in the UK resulted in ''Freeness Volume 1'' - a compilation of works that were shown during the tour.

After relocating to Trinidad in 2005, Ofili began a series of blue paintings inspired by the ''Jab Jab'' or "blue devils" who participate in the [[Trinidad and Tobago Carnival]], and the [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] group of German and Russian artists, ''[[Der Blaue Reiter]].'' These paintings often employed the use of a silver, acrylic background with layers of dark oil pigment on top.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://db-artmag.de/archiv/2006/e/4/2/448.html|title=db artmag - all the news on Deutsche Bank Art / db artmag - alle Infos zur Kunst der Deutschen Bank|last=www.absoluto.de|first=martin weise //|website=db-artmag.de|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/28/chris-ofilis-blue-devils-black-men-police|title=Chris Ofili's Blue Devils: between black men and the police|last=Ryder|first=Matthew|date=2014-10-28|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later iterations of these works were shown at Ofili's solo show ''Chris Ofili: Day and Night'' at [[New Museum|The New Museum of New York]] which were installed in a very dimly lit room, causing viewers to adjust their eyes to the darkness in order to see the paintings.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/chris-ofili|title=Chris Ofili: Night and Day|website=www.newmuseum.org|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ofili was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the [[2017 New Year Honours]] for services to art.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=61803 |supp=y|page=N9|date=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Ofili's work was featured in a museum in the 1995 exhibition ''Brilliant! New Art from London'' at the [[Walker Art Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.walkerart.org/item/object/8782 Chris Ofili, Third Eye Vision (1999)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506003109/http://collections.walkerart.org/item/object/8782 |date=6 May 2011 }} [[Walker Art Center]], Minneapolis.&lt;/ref&gt; Significant solo exhibitions include the [[Arts Club of Chicago]] (2010), [[Kestnergesellschaft]], [[Hanover]] (2006), the [[Studio Museum in Harlem]], New York (2005), and Southampton City Art Gallery (1998). In 2010, [[Tate Britain]] presented the most extensive exhibition of his work to date.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Glover, [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/shock-and-awe-the-art-of-chris-ofili-1874739.html "Shock and awe: The art of Chris Ofili"], ''[[The Independent]]'', 22 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrian Searle]] (25 January 2010), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jan/25/chris-ofili-tate?intcmp=239 "Chris Ofili heads into the shadows"], ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, [[New Museum|The New Museum in New York]] presented the first, major solo show of Ofili's work in the U.S. titled ''Chris Ofili: Night and Day''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Controversy==

===''The Holy Virgin Mary''===
One of his paintings, ''[[The Holy Virgin Mary]]'', a depiction of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], was at issue in a lawsuit between the mayor of [[New York City]], [[Rudy Giuliani]], and the [[Brooklyn Museum of Art]] when it was exhibited there in 1999 as a part of the [[Sensation exhibition|"Sensation"]] exhibit. The painting depicted a [[Black Madonna]] surrounded by images from [[blaxploitation]] movies and close-ups of female genitalia cut from pornographic magazines, and elephant dung.&lt;ref&gt;Will Bennett, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1385616/Elephant-dung-artist-gives-a-little-back.html "Elephant dung artist gives a little back"], ''The Telegraph'', 22 February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; These were formed into shapes reminiscent of the [[cherubim]] and [[seraphim]] commonly depicted in images of the [[Immaculate Conception]] and the [[Assumption of Mary]]. Following the scandal surrounding this painting, [[Bernard Goldberg]] ranked Ofili No. 86 in ''[[100 People Who Are Screwing Up America]]''. [[Red Grooms]] showed his support of the artist by purchasing one of Ofili's paintings in 1999, even after Giuliani famously exclaimed, "There’s nothing in the First Amendment that supports horrible and disgusting projects!”&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= Red Grooms’s Chris Ofili Drawing | author=Robert Ayers | publisher=ARTINFO | date= 20 November 2007| url= http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/26119/red-groomss-chris-ofili-drawing/| accessdate=17 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was owned by [[David Walsh (art collector)|David Walsh]] and was on display at the [[Museum of Old and New Art]] in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Collector |author=Gabriella Coslovich |publisher=[[The Age]] |date=14 April 2007 |url=http://moorilla.com.au/files/pdf/thecollector.pdf/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710060657/http://moorilla.com.au/files/pdf/thecollector.pdf/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 July 2012 |accessdate=24 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven A. Cohen then owned it for three years and donated the painting to the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/28/giuliani-vs-the-virgin|title=Giuliani vs. the Virgin|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Upper Room'' and the Tate Gallery===
{{main|Tate's purchase of The Upper Room}}
''The Upper Room'' is an installation of 13 paintings of [[rhesus macaque]] monkeys by Ofili in a specially designed room. It was bought by the [[Tate Gallery]] in 2005 and caused controversy as Ofili was on the board of the Tate Trustees at the time of the purchase.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Higgins, [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1823781,00.html "How the Tate broke the law"], ''The Guardian'', 19 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the [[Charity Commission]] censured the Tate for this purchase.

==Art market==
His ''Orgena'', a glittery portrait of a black woman created by the artist for his Turner Prize-winning exhibit at the Tate in 1998 was sold to an American collector for a record GBP 1.8 million, over its GBP 1 million high estimate, at [[Christie's]] London in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Crow (1 July 2010), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703426004575339413012478790 "Christie's Sells Warhol 'Silver Liz' for GBP 6.8 Million"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, art collector [[David Walsh (art collector)|David Walsh]] sold Ofili’s 8-foot-tall ''The Holy Virgin Mary'' for 2.9 million pounds at [[Christie’s]].&lt;ref&gt;Katya Kazakina (June 30, 2015), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-30/giuliani-blasted-madonna-with-dung-art-sells-for-4-6-million Ofili’s Madonna Sets Record at Christie’s $150.3 Million Sale], ''[[Bloomberg Business]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Common Community Commission''' ({{lang-fr|Commission communautaire commune}}, {{lang-nl|Gemeenschappelijke Gemeenschapscommissie}}) is responsible for Brussels community matters that are common to both the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] and the [[Flemish Community]] and for institutions that fall within the competencies of the [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|Communities]] but do not belong exclusively to either Community in the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] of [[Belgium]]. Examples of this include the bilingual hospitals in the [[Brussels-Capital Region|Brussels Region]].

The primary responsibilities of the Common Community Commission are health policy (curative and preventive medicine) and assistance to individuals (protection of youth, social welfare, aid to families, immigrant assistance services, etc...).

The Common Community Commission is composed of a council, the United Assembly, and an executive, the United College. The United Assembly consists of the members of both the Council of the [[Flemish Community Commission]] and the Assembly of the [[French Community Commission]], and is equal to the membership of the [[Brussels Parliament]] (which is a regional, rather than a community parliament). The United College comprises all members of the Government of the [[Brussels-Capital Region]], except the [[Secretary of State|Secretaries of State]]. The United College is presided over by the [[Minister-President of the Brussels-Capital Region|Minister-President of the Brussels Region]], who only has an advisory vote. As a result, there are two French-speaking and two Flemish members with the right to vote.

The United Assembly can legislate by [[Ordinance (Belgium)|ordinance]]. In order to adopt an ordinance, a majority of its members must be present and an absolute majority of the votes cast must be in favour. However, there must be also be a majority in each of the two language groups.

Petty corruption remains a problem in [[Sri Lanka]], and weak whistleblower protections have negative impacts on citizen's willingness to stand up against corruption. Despite some recent institutional reforms by the government in order to fight corruption, whistleblower protections need to be improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka Corruption Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/south-asia/sri-lanka/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate= 14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act''', or simply '''Compensated Emancipation Act''', was a law that ended slavery in [[Washington, D.C.]] by [[compensated emancipation|paying slave owners for releasing their slaves]]. Although not written by him,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guelzo|2009|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; the act was signed by [[U.S. President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] on April 16, 1862. April 16 is now celebrated in the city as [[Emancipation Day#Washington, D.C.|Emancipation Day]].

==History==

Proposals to emancipate all slaves in the [[District of Columbia]] date back to at least 1839.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= From our Correspondent |work= The Baltimore Sun |date= February 9, 1839 |page= 4 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/532847890/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, [[New York (state)|New York]] Representative [[Daniel Gott]] gave an impassioned speech to the [[US House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] against the proposed emancipation of slaves in the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name= gottspeech&gt;{{cite news |title= The District of Columbia and Slavery |work= The Baltimore Sun |date= December 28, 1848 |page= 1 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/533234454/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gott described the actions of [[abolitionism|abolitionists]] of the northern states as "impertinent interference with the slaves" and "impertinently intruding themselves into the domestic and delicate concerns of the South, understanding neither the malady to be corrected nor the remedy to be applied."&lt;ref name= gottspeech/&gt;

In 1849, when he was a Representative, Lincoln introduced a plan to eliminate slavery in Washington, D.C., by compensated emancipation; the bill failed.&lt;ref name="Reiner 57"&gt;{{harvnb|Reiner|2006|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1861, a bill was introduced in [[US Congress|Congress]] for the abolition of slavery in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burgess|1901|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written by [[Thomas Marshall Key]],&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, Linda.  [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/house-divided/wp/2014/04/14/the-true-author-of-d-c-s-emancipation-act-is-uncovered/ "The true author of D.C.’s Emancipation Act is uncovered"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'' (April 14, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; and sponsored by [[U.S. Senate|Senator]] [[Henry Wilson]] of [[Massachusetts]], the bill passed the Senate on April 3 by a vote of 29 in favor and 14 against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Emancipation in the District |work= The New York Times |date= April 4, 1862 |page= 4 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/91632460/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; It passed the House of Representatives on April 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Abolition in the District of Columbia |work= The New York Times |date= April 12, 1862 |page= 4 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/91712846/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McQuirter|2009|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln had wanted the bill to include a provision to make emancipation effective only after a favorable vote from the citizens of the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name= opinions&gt;{{cite news |title= Emancipation in the District—Mr. Lincoln's Opinions |work= The New York Times |date= April 15, 1862 |page= 4 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/91653233/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= views&gt;{{cite news |title= Mr. Lincoln's Views on Slavery—His Course Towards the South |work= The New York Times |date= November 5, 1860 |page= 4 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/91544848/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wanted the bill to delay implementation until after a certain amount of time after the bill was signed.&lt;ref name= opinions/&gt; Neither provision was included in the bill.&lt;ref name= opinions/&gt;&lt;ref name= views/&gt; Lincoln signed the bill on April 16, 1862,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Thirty-Seventh Congress—First Session |work= The Baltimore Sun |date= April 17, 1862 |page= 4 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/533678237/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; amid ongoing Congressional debate over an emancipation plan for the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]]. Following the bill's passage, Lincoln proposed several changes to the act, which were approved by the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burgess|1901|pp=79–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage of the Compensated Emancipation Act came nearly nine months before the signing of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. The act, which set aside $1 million,&lt;ref name="Reiner 57" /&gt; immediately emancipated slaves in Washington, D.C., giving Union slaveholders up to $300 per freed slave.&lt;ref name="NARA FD" /&gt; An additional $100,000&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rodriguez|2007|p=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; allocated by the law was used to pay each newly freed slave $100 if he or she chose to leave the United States and colonize in places such as [[Haiti]] or [[Liberia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burgess|1901|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Washington, D.C., April 16 has been celebrated as Emancipation Day since 1866. An annual parade was held to commemorate the signing of the act until 1901, when a lack of financial and organizational support forced the tradition to stop;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gay|2007|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; it restarted in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.georgetowner.com/articles/2011/apr/05/dc-statehood-emancipation-day-linked/|title=D.C. Statehood &amp; Emancipation Day Linked|last=Gillespie|first=Lisa|date=April 5, 2011|work=[[The Georgetowner]]|publisher=Georgetown Media Group|accessdate=July 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, the [[Council of the District of Columbia]] made April 16 a private holiday—or one on which city employees are not given a free day off—and on July 9, 2004, council member [[Vincent Orange]] proposed making the day a public holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A39778-2004Jul9.html|title=Emancipation Day May Go Public|last=Aarons|first=Dakarai I.|date=July 10, 2004|page=B02|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]|accessdate=July 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2005 marked the first year that Emancipation Day was celebrated as an official city holiday in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gay|2007|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcome==
The emancipation plan relied on a three-person [[Emancipation Commission]] to distribute the allotted funding. In order to receive compensation, former slaveholders were required to provide written evidence of their ownership, as well as state their loyalty to the Union. Most of the petitioners were white, but some blacks also filed for compensation, having once bought their family members away from other owners. In the end, almost all of the $1 million appropriated in the act had been spent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McQuirter|2009|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the act's passage, 3,185 slaves were freed.&lt;ref name="Zavodnyik 15" /&gt; However, the older [[fugitive slave laws]] were still applied to slaves who had run from [[Maryland]] to Washington, D.C. The slaves were still subject to the laws, which supposedly applied only to states, until their 1864 repeal.&lt;ref name="Zavodnyik 15"&gt;{{harvnb|Zavodnyik|2011|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the compensated emancipation model was not later adapted by the U.S. government, the act signified the forthcoming demise of slavery in the United States.&lt;ref name="NARA FD"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/dc_emancipation_act/|title=The District of Columbia Emancipation Act|work=Featured Documents|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|accessdate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act was the only compensated emancipation plan enacted in the United States.&lt;ref name="Reiner 57" /&gt;

The act has one characteristic that remains to this day. When the limit to file income tax returns in the United States, April 15, falls on a Sunday, the due date would normally be advanced to Monday, April 16. However, since April 16 is a holiday in the District of Columbia, it applies to IRS offices there as well, thus the due date is advanced for the entire country to Tuesday, April 17.

==Supplemental legislation==
Following Lincoln's concerns over the version of the bill that he signed, the U.S. Senate approved a supplement to the original Compensated Emancipation Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Basler|1953|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment passed on July 12, 1862, allowing former slaves to petition for compensation if their masters had not done so. Under the supplemental act, claims made by blacks and whites were weighted equally, whereas previously, the testimonies of blacks—enslaved or free—were discarded if challenged by a white person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/dc_emancipation_act/supplemental_act.html|title=Supplemental Act of July 12, 1862|work=Featured Documents|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=July 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McQuirter|2009|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethel Lilian Voynich''', ''née'' '''Boole''' (11 May 1864 – 27 July 1960) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] novelist and musician, and a supporter of several revolutionary causes. She was born in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], but grew up in England. Voynich was a significant figure, not only on the late [[Victorian literature|Victorian literary]] scene, but also in Russian émigré circles. She is best known for her novel ''[[The Gadfly]]'', which became hugely popular in her lifetime, especially in Russia.

==Biography==
Ethel Lilian Boole was born on 11 May 1864, at Lichfield Cottage, Blackrock, [[Ballintemple, Cork]],&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, P. (2015), "Voynich [née Boole], Ethel Lilian [Lily; E. L. V.] (1864–1960), novelist, translator, and musician", [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]&lt;/ref&gt; the youngest daughter to the mathematician [[George Boole]] (father of [[Boolean logic]]), and the [[feminist]] philosopher&lt;ref&gt;Showalter 1977, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Everest Boole|Mary Everest]],&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes given as ''Everett''. Showalter 1977, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; who was the niece of [[George Everest]] and a writer for ''Crank'', an early-20th-century [[periodical]].&lt;ref&gt;Showalter 1977, pp.251–252.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father died six months after she was born. Her mother returned to her native England with her daughters, and was able to live off a small government pension until she was appointed librarian at Queen's College, London.&lt;ref name = word/&gt; When she was eight, Ethel contracted [[erysipelas]], a disease associated with poor sanitation. Her mother decided to send her to live in Lancashire with her brother, believing that it would be good for her health. Described as "a religious fanatic and sadist",&lt;ref name = word/&gt; who regularly beat his children, he apparently forced Ethel to play the piano for hours on end. Ethel returned to London at the age of ten. She became withdrawn, dressing in black and calling herself "Lily".&lt;ref name = word/&gt;

At the age of eighteen, she gained access to a legacy. This allowed her to study piano and musical composition at the [[Hochschule für Musik]] in Berlin, which she attended between 1882 and 85. During this period she became increasingly attracted to revolutionary politics. Back in London she learned Russian from [[Sergei Kravchinski]], known as Stepniak who encouraged her to go to Russia.&lt;ref name = word/&gt; From 1887 to 1889 she worked as a governess in St. Petersburg, where she stayed with Kravchinski's sister-in-law, Preskovia Karauloff. Through her, she became associated with the revolutionary [[Narodniks]].&lt;ref name = "vic"/&gt; After her return to the UK, she settled in London, where she became involved in pro-Revolutionary activity. With Kravchinski she founded the [[Society of Friends of Russian Freedom]], and helped to edit ''Free Russia'', the Narodniks's English-language journal.&lt;ref name = "vic"&gt;Sally Mitchell, ''Victorian Britain: An Encyclopedia'', Routledge, 2012, p.837.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890 she met Michał Habdank-Wojnicz, a [[Poland|Polish]] revolutionary who had escaped from Siberia. Soon he also became Ethel Boole's life-partner. By 1895, they were living together and she was calling herself Mrs. Voynich. They married in 1902.&lt;ref name = word/&gt; In 1904 he anglicised his name to [[Wilfrid Michael Voynich]] and became an antiquarian book dealer, giving his name eventually to the [[Voynich manuscript]].

In 1897 she published ''The Gadfly'', which was an immediate international success. She published three more novels ''Jack Raymond'' (1901), ''Olive Latham'' (1904) and ''An Interrupted Friendship'' (1910), but none matched the popularity of her first book.&lt;ref name = "vic"/&gt;

The Voyniches emigrated to the United States in 1920, after Wilfred had moved the main base of his book business to New York. She concentrated more on music from this point on, working in a music school, but she continued her writing career as a translator, translating from Russian, Polish and French. A final novel, ''Put off thy Shoes'', was published in 1945.&lt;ref name = "vic"/&gt;

Voynich was unaware of the vast sales of ''The Gadfly'' in the Soviet Union until she was visited in New York by a Russian diplomat in 1955, who told her how highly regarded she was in the country. The following year [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] secured an agreement for the payment of $15,000 royalties to her.&lt;ref name = word&gt;Gray, Anne, ''The World of Women in Classical Music'', Seven LOCKS, 2007, P.886-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged affair with Reilly===
According to the British journalist [[Robin Bruce Lockhart]], [[Sidney Reilly]] – a Russian-born [[secret agent|operative]] employed by the [[émigré]] [[intelligence]] network of [[Scotland Yard]]'s [[Special Branch]] – met Ethel Voynich in London in 1895. Lockhart, whose father, [[R.H. Bruce Lockhart]] knew Reilly, claims that Reilly and Voynich had a sexual liaison and voyaged to Italy together. During their romance Reilly is said to have bared his soul and revealed to her the story of his espionage activities. After their brief affair, Voynich published ''The Gadfly'', whose central character Arthur Burton was based on Reilly.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Bruce Lockhart, ''Reilly: Ace of Spies''; 1986, Hippocrene Books, {{ISBN|0-88029-072-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, writer Andrew Cook suggested that Reilly may have been reporting on Voynich and her political activities to [[William Melville]] of the [[Special Branch|Metropolitan Police Special Branch]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Cook, ''Ace of Spies: The True Story of Sidney Reilly'', 2004, Tempus Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7524-2959-0}}. Page 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, new evidence surfaced from archived communication between Anne Fremantle, who attempted a biography of Ethel Voynich, and a relative of Ethel's on the Hinton side. The evidence demonstrates that a liaison of some sort took place between Reilly and her in Florence, 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Gerry Kennedy, The Booles and the Hintons, Atrium Press, July 2016 pp 274-276 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===''The Gadfly''===
She is most famous for her first novel ''[[The Gadfly]]'', first published in 1897 in the United States (June) and Britain (September), about the struggles of an international revolutionary in Italy. This novel was very popular in the [[Soviet Union]] and was the top bestseller and compulsory reading there, where it was seen as ideologically useful; for similar reasons, the novel has been popular in the People's Republic of China as well. By the time of Voynich's death ''The Gadfly'' had sold an estimated 2,500,000 copies in the Soviet Union and had been made into two Russian movies, first in 1928 in Soviet Georgia (''[[Krazana]]'') and then again in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corklibrary.ie/aboutus/librarypublications/ Cork City Libraries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118191004/http://www.corklibrary.ie/aboutus/librarypublications/ |date=18 November 2007 }} provides a [http://www.corkcitylibraries.ie/media/SOCoiglighwebversion171.pdf downloadable PDF] of Evgeniya Taratuta's 1957 biographical pamphlet ''Our Friend Ethel Lilian Boole/Voynich'', translated from the Russian by [[Séamus Ó Coigligh]]. The pamphlet gives some idea of the Soviet attitude toward Voynich.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[The Gadfly (1955 film)|1955 film]] of the novel, by the Soviet director [[Aleksandr Fajntsimmer]] is noted for the fact that composer [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] wrote the score (see ''[[The Gadfly Suite]]''). Along with some other excerpts, the ''Romance'' movement has since become very popular. Shostakovich's ''Gadfly'' theme was also used in the 1980s, in the [[BBC]] TV series  ''[[Reilly, Ace of Spies]]''. In 1980 the novel was adapted again as a TV&amp;nbsp;miniseries ''[[The Gadfly (1980 film)|The Gadfly]]'', featuring [[Sergei Bondarchuk]] as Father Montanelli. Various other adaptations exist, including at least three operas and two ballets.

===Other Novels===
Voynich's other four novels never achieved the same success as ''[[The Gadfly]]'', but two of them extended its narrative. ''An Interrupted Friendship'' (1910) elaborates on ''[[The Gadfly]]'''s protagonist's backstory,&lt;ref name="vic" /&gt; and ''Put Off Thy Shoes'' (1945), Voynich's last novel, further focuses on the life of the protagonist's family and ancestors; a "lengthy, multi-generational chronicle" set in the 18th century.&lt;ref name = word/&gt;

Her second novel, ''Jack Raymond'' (1901), was quickly followed by her third, ''Olive Latham'' (1904)''.'' Nearly a decade later, Voynich took a hiatus from writing and focused on music.&lt;ref&gt;MacHale, Desmond. ''The Life and Work of George Boole: A Prelude to the Digital Age''. Cork: Cork University Press, 2014, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Voynich began composing music around 1910. She joined the [[Society of Women Musicians]] during World War I. After she and her husband moved to New York, she devoted herself much more to music, creating many adaptations and transcriptions of existing works. In 1931 she published an edited volume of Chopin's letters.&lt;ref&gt; Gerry Kennedy, The Booles and the Hintons, Atrium Press, July 2016 &lt;/ref&gt; From 1933 to 1943 she worked at the Pius X School of Liturgical Music in Manhattan. While there she composed a number of cantatas and other works that were performed at the college, including ''Babylon'', ''Jerusalem'', ''Epitaph in Ballad Form'' and ''The Submerged City''. She also researched the history of music, compiling detailed commentaries on music of various eras. Most of her music remains unpublished and is held at the Library of Congress.&lt;ref name = word/&gt; Recent evaluation in 2005 of the cantata ''Babylon'' by an eminent English composer was not very favourable. 'The general impression is of amateurism and gaucheness'.&lt;ref&gt; Gerry Kennedy, The Booles and the Hintons, Atrium Press, July 2016 &lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Ethiopia}}
[[Ethiopia]] held [[Elections in Ethiopia|general elections]] on May 15, 2005, for seats in both its national [[House of Peoples' Representatives]] and in four regional government councils. Under pressure from the international community, [[Prime Minister of Ethiopia|Prime Minister]] [[Meles Zenawi]] promised that this election would be proof that more democracy would come in this multi-ethnic nation; international elections observers from the [[European Union]] (EU) and the [[United States|U.S.]]-based [[Carter Center]] were present to observe the results. This election succeeded in attracting about 90% of the registered voters to the polls. A government ban on protests was imposed throughout the election period.

== Campaigning ==
EU observers remarked on the "significantly enlarged freedoms for political campaigning in comparison to previous elections". Political parties campaigned actively, and opposition parties appeared to be increasingly active in the rural areas. The observer mission described the atmosphere "during the campaign was calm, culminating in two massive, peaceful rallies in [[Addis Ababa]], one by the EPRDF and one by the opposition."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/human_rights/election_observation/ethiopia/final_report_en.pdf "Ethiopia Legislative Elections 2005 Final Report"] (European Union Election Observer Mission, Brussels, 2005), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, opposition parties alleged numerous cases of intimidation, and arrests of its supporters. While the EU observers could not investigate all of the alleged cases, it did confirm those it investigated. International human rights groups likewise cataloged a number of cases of human rights violations. However, the EU observers wrote in their final report, they "recorded no arrests of EPRDF supporters for campaign offences."&lt;ref&gt;EU-COM, "Final Report", p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the close of the campaigning, the language became more vicious, with each side accusing the other of numerous violations of the campaigning rules. "Campaign rhetoric became insulting," the EU observer's report noted, then continued:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The most extreme example of this came from the Deputy Prime Minister, [[Addisu Legesse]], who, in a public debate on 15 April, compared the opposition parties with the ''[[Interhamwe]]'' militia, which perpetrated the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]]. The Prime Minister made the same comparison on 5 May in relation to the CUD. The EPRDF made the same associations during its free slots on radio and TV. The opposition coalition UEDF then used the comparison against the government in a TV spot showing footage of the movie "[[Hotel Rwanda]]". Such rhetoric is unacceptable in a democratic election.&lt;ref&gt;EU-COM, "Final Report", p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Early results ==
Early results showed the opposition with a big lead, sweeping all of the contested seats in the capital Addis both in the race for parliamentary as well as local government.  By the afternoon of 16 May, the opposition claimed it was halfway towards winning a majority in the national parliament with only about a third of the constituencies reporting complete results. Later that day, trailing badly in the preliminary report covering just under 200 seats released by the National Election Board, the ruling [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF) announced that it had won more than 317 seats out of 547, while conceding that opposition parties won all 23 seats in the capital city [[Addis Ababa]]. The two major opposition parties, the [[Coalition for Unity and Democracy]] (CUD) and the [[United Ethiopian Democratic Forces]] (UEDF) claimed on that same day that they had won 185 of the approximately 200 seats for which the [[National Election Board of Ethiopia]] (NEBE) had released preliminary results. That was a significant improvement over the 12 seats the opposition had in the previous parliament.

By law, the NEBE was required to announce the official results on 8 June.  However, the vote tallying process was jeopardized when the opposition claimed that the Addis Ababa vote was rigged and during the evening of 16 May, the Prime Minister declared a state of emergency, outlawed any public gathering, assumed direct command of the security forces, and replaced the capital city police with federal police and special forces drawn from elite army units.  The NEBE, simultaneously, ordered the vote tallying process to stop, an order which was not rescinded for nearly a week, yet another action against which the opposition and the independent election monitors strongly objected.

The next official report from the NEBE, released on 27 May, showed that the EPRDF had won 209 seats, and affiliated parties 12 more. The report indicated the opposition parties had won 142 seats. "These results are provisional, and these results could change because we are looking into complaints by some of the parties," said NEBE spokesman [[Getahun Amogne]].

== Alleged voting irregularities ==
Observers from the European Union afterwards "assessed the closing and counting processes negatively in almost half of urban polling stations observed, a very high figure for international observers to record, and even worse in rural polling stations observed." Counting was slow, a remarkably high number of ballots were ruled invalid, and there was a lack of transparency in the results. "Result sheets were only displayed at 29 per cent of rural polling stations observed and 36 per cent of urban polling stations observed at the completion of counting. In 25 per cent of polling stations observed, political party representatives were not provided with a copy of the results."&lt;ref name=EU-2&gt;EU-EOM, "Final Report", p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation only deteriorated with the following day, according to the observers, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;starting with a blanket ban, issued immediately after the end of voting, on freedom of assembly in the capital. Media coverage also worsened. State media published statements by government/EPRDF personnel claiming victory in the elections, despite the fact that counting was still underway, but refused to publish opposition statements. Incidents involving students started on the night of 5 June and extended on 6 and 7 June with hundreds being arrested. During a demonstration in [[Addis Ababa]] on 8 June, security forces killed at least 36 citizens and in the aftermath arrested thousands of persons, mostly linked to the opposition, who were accused of spreading "political unrest".&lt;ref name=EU-2/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The CUD lodged complaints in 139 constituencies, the UEDF lodged 89 complaints, while the EPRDF has raised concerns over irregularities in more than 50 seats. Including the complaints lodged by small parties, complaints concerning the results in 299 parliamentary seats were lodged.  According to an official of the NEBE, political parties had until June 3 to provide evidence of fraud, or their complaints would be dismissed. However investigations led to elections being re-run at a minimum of 16 voting stations, and affecting elections for at least six seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudantribune.com/article.php3?id_article=9809 Ethiopia electoral body orders poll rerun in six constituencies] (Sudan Tribune)&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in November of that year, scholar Christopher Clapham noted that "the official results of the elections are both complex in themselves, and deeply affected by fraud". On one hand, he pointed out that the EPRDF lost heavily in those cities of Ethiopia which were bellwethers of public opinion; on the other, 
: some of the constituencies declared for the EPRDF defy any plausible assessment of public opinion in the areas concerned: that it should have won about half of the seats both in [[Sidama Zone|Sidama]] and in [[Mirab Welega Zone|western Welega]], for instance, is entirely incredible. In Sidama, as a result of the May 2002 massacre, and in western Welega, as the heartland of [[Oromo Liberation Front|OLF]] support, hostility to the regime runs very deep, and the declared results can only be the result either of heavy-handed government pressure before and during the vote, or else of fraud after it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethiomedia.com/fastpress/clapham_on_ethiopian_crisis.html "Comments on the political crisis in Ethiopia"], ''Ethiopia Review'', originally published 14 November 2005 (accessed 16 November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Provisional results were scheduled to be released on May 23, but the need to investigate claims of voting irregularities and disruptions in two southern [[Regions of Ethiopia|regions]] &amp;mdash; [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region]] and [[Oromia]] &amp;mdash; delayed the release of these results until June 8, the date originally scheduled for releasing the official results.  When the ruling party was unofficially reported the winner of the election, demonstrations protesting alleged election fraud broke out, and continued into June. Hundreds of students were arrested in at least nine cities, including [[Gondar]], Bure, [[Bahir Dar]], [[Debre Marqos]], [[Dessie]] and [[Awassa]] for demonstrating despite a month-old ban on protests imposed on the government. At the same time, security forces arrested dozens of locally prominent CUD members in Gondar, Dessie, [[Wondo Genet]], [[Kombolcha]] and [[Jinka]]; unconfirmed reports of arrests following a similar pattern came from several other towns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2005/06/14/ethiopia-crackdown-spreads-beyond-capital "Ethiopia: Crackdown Spreads Beyond Capital"], HRW website 14 June 2005 (accessed 17 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; On June 8, police shot 42 people gathering at the Piazza and Merkato markets of Addis Ababa.&lt;ref&gt;The organization [[Human Rights Watch]] reported that at least 36 people were killed, and 400 arrested. [http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/ethiop12308.htm Essential background: Human rights in Ethiopia] (HRW website)&lt;/ref&gt; The government afterwards stated that an appropriate level of force was used and accused the CUD of fomenting dissent; the CUD denied these accusations, and claimed that the government was attempting to distract attention from election fraud.  This led to the leaders of the CUD, including head [[Hailu Shawul]], being put under house arrest while hundreds of security forces patrolled the streets of the capital.

==Official results==

On July 8, the NEBE released the first official results for 307 of the 547 national parliamentary seats. Of the 307 seats, the EPRDF had won 139, while CUD and UEDF won 93 and 42, respectively. Smaller parties and independent candidates won the remaining 33 seats. However, [[Berhanu Nega]], vice-chairman of the CUD, had criticized the process on July 20, claiming that "The investigation process was a complete failure. Our representatives and witnesses have been harassed, threatened, barred and killed upon their return from the hearings."

Meanwhile, the NEBE investigated voting fraud and other irregularities, while also arranging new polls to resolve some disputes. On August 9, official results were released, acknowledging that the ruling EPRDF had won 296 of the total 524 seats &amp;mdash; about 56% &amp;mdash; enabling it to form a government, while its allied parties won 22 seats. The UEDF won 52 seats. Berhanu said his party, which had officially won 109 seats, was debating whether they would challenge the results in court. Repeat elections were scheduled for August 21 in 31 areas where either irregularities were reported or results were challenged.

Opposition parties had decided to boycott the related August 21 elections in the [[Somali Region]]. The CUD withdrew 10 of the 17 candidates it was fielding in Somali region, while the [[Western Somali Democratic Party]], the [[Somali Democratic Alliance Forces]] and [[Del Wabe People's Democratic Movement]] who had planned to field 43 candidates for the [[Federal Parliamentary Assembly]] and 273 candidates for the regional parliament in the regional capital of [[Jijiga]], also announced that they would boycott this election.

On September 5, the NEBE released its final results, in which the EPRDF retained its control of the government with 327 seats, or 59% of the vote. Opposition parties won 174 seats, or 32% of the vote. The CUD alone won 20% of the vote.

==Protest==
{{main|2005 Ethiopian police massacres}}
Protests of the results, led by Coalition for Democracy and Unity, began on November 1, 2005, and have prompted more than 60,000 arrests. Live gunfire from government forces has been directed at protesters and bystanders, killing at least 42. A number of policemen were also killed suggesting that violence was not all on the side of the state.

===Massacre claims and public inquiry===
On October 18, 2006, the draft report of a 10-member public inquiry into election-related unrests was released to [[Associated Press]] (AP). It concludes that a total of 199 people (193 civilians and six policemen) were killed and 763 were injured, a significantly higher figure than the Ethiopian government's claim that 61 civilians and seven policemen were killed. The vice chairman of the inquiry, judge Wolde-Michael Meshesha, who fled Ethiopia a month prior after he had received anonymous death threats, told AP that "this was a massacre ... these demonstrators were unarmed yet the majority died from shots to the head." He added that the government attempted to pressure and intimidate members of the inquiry after learning about its controversial finding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/africa/10/18/ethiopia.massacre.ap "Judge: Ethiopian forces killed 193 unarmed protesters"], ''[[CNN]]'', October 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethiopian government did not  immediately comment on the leaked report, but the next day, it told [[BBC]] that its contents were "hearsay." The [[European Union]]'s chief observer during the elections, [[Ana Maria Gomes]], stated that the draft report "only confirms what we have said in our report on the elections,"  and "that indeed there were massive human rights violations." &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6067386.stm "Ethiopia row over 'massacre' leak"], ''[[BBC]]'', October 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flávio Pimenta Alves'''  (born 30 November 1969) is a Brazilian writer, screenwriter, and film director resident in America since 1998. His movies consistently feature elderly characters as protagonists.&lt;ref name="The Daily Rotation"&gt;{{citation |title=The Secret Friend - Film Review|periodical=[[The Daily Rotation]] |date=September 4, 2011  |url=http://thedailyrotation.com/the-secret-friend-review/|first=Sean |last=Canfield |accessdate=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for the film ''[[Tom in America]]'', starring [[Burt Young]] and [[Sally Kirkland]].&lt;ref name="Palm Springs Life"&gt;{{citation |title='Tom in America' Touches on Gay Feelings of Married Men |periodical=[[Palm Springs Life]] |date=June 13, 2014 |url=http://www.palmspringslife.com/tom-in-america-touches-on-gay-feelings-of-married-men/|first=Jim |last=Desroches |accessdate=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Alves was born in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]] and served the Brazilian navy for several years before coming to America in 1997. He was granted [[political asylum]] in the [[United States]] in 1998 based on [[political opinion]] and [[sexual orientation]] after he wrote the book, ''Toque de Silêncio'' ("Call to Silence", 1997), describing his life as a [[gay]] man in the Brazilian navy.&lt;ref name="advocate"&gt;{{citation |title=The long road to safety |periodical=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |date=June 25, 2002  |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+long+road+to+safety:+gays+fleeing+violence+abroad+appeal+to+the...-a088583367|first=Steve |last=Desroches |accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; His request was granted because, according to Alves, he received death threats upon publishing his book. Although various human rights organizations, LGBT activists, and former [[São Paulo]] mayor [[Marta Suplicy]] supported his claim, it has also divided the Brazilian gay community.&lt;ref name="Veja"&gt;{{citation |title=País com parada gay não é homofóbico |publisher=[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]] |date=May 5, 2004  |url= http://veja.abril.com.br/050504/p_070.html |first=Sandra |last=Brasil |accessdate=2008-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Columbia University]] in New York City, where he earned an undergraduate degree in [[Political Science]]. In the early 2000s he worked as an assistant for then-Congressman [[Anthony Weiner]] (D-NY) and then-New York Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] (D-NY).&lt;ref name="Scallywag &amp; Vagabond"&gt;{{citation |title=Flavio Alves: Provocative Film maker and ex political asylum detainee|periodical=[[Scallywag &amp; Vagabond]] |date=March 21, 2009  |url=http://scallywagandvagabond.com/2009/03/flavio-alves-provocative-film-maker-and-ex-political-asylum-detainee/2/|first=Fixx |last=Invictus |accessdate=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 2007, Alves left politics and enrolled at [[New York University]] to study film production. While there he wrote and directed, ''[[Even in My Dreams]]'', which received the Technisphere Award from [[NYU]] for best student film, and was screened at a variety of film festivals around the world. The film was also the winner of the Golden Palm Award at the 2009 Mexico International Film Festival, and the Golden Ace Award at the 2009 Las Vegas International Film Festival.&lt;ref name="Out in Jersey"&gt;{{citation |title=Movie Review - Even in My Dreams |publisher=[[Out in Jersey]] |date=September 24, 2008  |url=http://www.outinjersey.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=210:movie-review-even-in-my-dreams&amp;catid=25:filmreviews&amp;Itemid=60 |first=Toby |last=Grace |accessdate=2008-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New York University Online Interview with Flavio Alves, [http://www.scps.nyu.edu/about-scps/newsroom/news/2008/12/filmmaking-intensive-alum-scores-success-at-film-festivals.html NYU-SCPS Filmmaking Intensive Alum Scores Success at Film Festivals], December 18, 2008, via New York University.com&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, Flavio released his short film ''[[The Secret Friend]]'', starring [[Viola Harris]] and [[Siobhan Fallon Hogan|Siobhan Fallon]] in the major roles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1512245/ IMDB List of Cast and Crew]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/29297// |title=The Secret Friend |first=Phil |last=Hall |date=January 12, 2011 |publisher=Film Threat |accessdate=January 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The film received multiple awards and nominations after its premiere at the [[Palm Springs International Film Festival]] in 2010, where it was chosen as ''Best of the Fest''.&lt;ref name="The Daily Rotation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Independent Critic"&gt;{{citation |title=The Secret Friend - Film Review|periodical=[[The Independent Critic]] |date=June 2011  |url=http://theindependentcritic.com/secret_friend|first=Richard |last=Propes |accessdate=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Official site, [http://www.thesecretfriendmovie.com/screenings.html Screenings &amp; Awards page], January 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alves’ most recent film, ''[[Tom in America]]'', starring  [[Academy Award]] nominees, [[Burt Young]] and [[Sally Kirkland]], has been screened at over 140 film festivals worldwide, and was also featured on the cable network HereTV.&lt;ref&gt;Official site, [http://www.tominamerica.com/screenings.html Screenings &amp; Awards page], August 15, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Flavio is currently in post-production for his upcoming film, ''[[The Garden Left Behind]]'', starring [[Michael Madsen]] and [[Ed Asner]]. ''[[The Garden Left Behind]]'' is Alves’s first [[feature length]] film as a director and it is scheduled to be released Spring 2019. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://current.nyfa.org/post/143228443398/crafting-stories-with-filmmaker-flavio-alves|title=Crafting Stories with Filmmaker Flavio Alves - interview by Madeleine Cutrona — NYFA Current|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3453008/ IMDB List of Cast and Crew]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Alves was selected by the [[Film Society of Lincoln Center]] to the Artist Academy. The program is designed to support the next generation of filmmakers from a variety of backgrounds as they develop their careers and build audiences within the film community. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2018/daily/nyff56-artist-and-critics-academies-announced/|title=NYFF56 Artist and Critics Academies Announced|work=filmlinc.org|date=21 September 2018|accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ebay Campaign==
While in pre-production for his upcoming film, ''[[The Garden Left Behind]]'', Alves and his team pioneered the use of [[eBay]] as a [[crowdfunding]] platform, where they raised more than $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/08/how-indie-filmmakers-engage-audience-eliza-hittman-yance-ford-1201993939/|title=Solange Saves the Day: Indie Filmmakers Break Down Their Approaches to Engaging Audiences in Unexpected Places|work=indiewire.com|date=14 August 2018|first=Chris|last=O'Falt|accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unprecedented success experienced during this campaign revamped typical crowdfunding methods. The film became the first [[independent film]] to be funded substantially through donations and sales via [[eBay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/08/how-indie-filmmakers-engage-audience-eliza-hittman-yance-ford-1201993939/|title=Solange Saves the Day: Indie Filmmakers Break Down Their Approaches to Engaging Audiences in Unexpected Places|work=indiewire.com|date=14 August 2018|first=Chris|last=O'Falt|accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2016/08/88802-brief-independent-feature-film-garden-left-behind-turns-ebay-funding/|title=Brief: Independent Feature Film “The Garden Left Behind” Uses ebay to Crowdfund Production by Samantha Hurst — Crowdfund Insider|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rightthisminute.com/video/rtmtv-garden-left-behind-movie-ebay-donations#ooid=E5a3YzNTE6lIfV3KHb4njrAlofoMXl67/|title=Brief: One Man's Junk is Another's Movie crowdfunding Campaign — Right This Minute - The Viral Videos Show=03 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Flavio lives in [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. In April 2010, Alves became a [[US citizen]]. As of 2013, he has been a member of the [[National Board of Review]]. In 2012, [[Grupo Gay da Bahia]], the oldest [[LGBTQ]] advocacy association in [[Brazil]], awarded Alves, among 21 other militants, an honorary title recognizing his sacrifices and contributions to the [[LGBTQ community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doistercos.com.br/grupo-gay-da-bahia-celebra-33-anos-de-luta-e-concede-titulos-honorarios-a-militantes-brasileiros-e-estrangeiros/|title=Grupo Gay da Bahia celebra 33 anos de luta e concede títulos honorários a militantes brasileiros e estrangeiros|work=doistercos.com.br|date=28 February 2013|first=Genilson|last=Coutinho|accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Humming Heads Inc.''' is an [[Information security|EIP]] (Enterprise Information Protection) software developer based in Japan.

==History==
Humming Heads Inc. was founded in 1999 to focus on the computer security. It shipped its first product, Security Platform (SeP) in 2001, as an anti-virus software. Taking [[Sarbanes Oxley Act|SOX]] seriously, Humming Heads introduced functionality preventing unauthorized access and confidential information theft from the electronic systems. Further Humming Heads came with its own implementation of the desktop file manager. In 2017 the firm entered the US market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.esecurityplanet.com/network-security/shinobi-defense-system-arrives-in-the-u.s..html|title=Shinobi Defense System Arrives in the U.S.|author=Pedro Hernandez|date=May 10, 2017|website=esecurityplanet.com|accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security Platform==
SeP prevents unauthorized information access from the PC as well as from the external devices. SeP client is controlling all the storage devices, and automatically performs operations like encryption. It also keeps log of the user operations, which is stored at the server side and can be analyzed if needed. One of important features of SeP is that it has marginal effect in client's PC performance.
Originally SeP is available in Japanese language. Chinese and English versions of the SeP software are under development.

== Biography ==
Golden was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].  In college he played lacrosse both for Arizona State University and for Cambridge University and was a member of Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity.  Golden is married with two daughters.  Prior to his academic career Golden served seven years as a police office, hazardous materials specialist and environmental crimes detective.  He received a life saving medal, two meritorious medals, two distinguished service medals the International Association of Chiefs of Police J. Stannard Baker award and the Sons of the American Revolution Law Enforcement Commendation Medal.  

Golden received his doctorate in engineering from the [[University of Cambridge]] ([[Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge|Division of Geotechnical, Petroleum and Sustainable Engineering]]) under the supervision of Professor Peter Guthrie, Royal Academy of Engineering and Order of the British Empire.  Golden is an alumnus of [[Wolfson College, Cambridge|Wolfson College]] at the University of Cambridge. 

Prior to his PhD, he earned his master’s degree in environmental engineering and sustainable development as part of the first cohort of an international  joint program between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Cambridge ([[Cambridge–MIT Institute|CMI Institute]]). Golden also holds an Organizational Master of Project Management from Stanford University and an MLE from Harvard University, as well as a bachelor’s degree in management.

[[Duke University]]:  Dr. Golden was an Associate Professor of the Practice for Sustainable Systems Analysis at the [[Nicholas School of the Environment]] and [[Pratt School of Engineering]] at Duke University.&lt;ref name="bren"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tarantula.bren.ucsb.edu/jay_golden.htm|title=Emerging Trends in Sustainability: Government, Industry &amp; Higher Education|publisher=Donald Bren School of Environmental Science and Management – Community Colloquium|accessdate=6/7/11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Golden was the faculty director of the Business &amp; Environment graduate program and served as the Director of the [[Duke University|Duke]] Center for Sustainability &amp; Commerce at Duke University Golden’s teaching and research focus on "examining organizational and technology intervention strategies in regards to regional and global social and environmental impacts from population and consumptive patterns".&lt;ref name="bren" /&gt;

== Honors ==
In 2017 Dr. Golden was appointed to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] Board of Scientific Counselors.  He was inducted into Phi Kappa Phi Honors Society in 2017.

In 2012, [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/world-changing-ideas-2012-innovations-radical-enough-alter-lives/ Scientific American] listed the Sustainability Index developed by Dr. Golden and the Sustainability Consortium which he co-founded and co-directed as one of the '''Top 10 World Changing Ideas.'''  In September 2009, Golden received the '''Faculty Pioneer Award''' from the Center for Business Education at the [[Aspen Institute]].&lt;ref name="aspen"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Aspen Institute Names 2009 Faculty Pioneers, September 16, 2009|url=http://www.aspeninstitute.org/news/2009/09/16/aspen-institute-names-2009-faculty-pioneers|publisher=The Aspen Institute|accessdate=6/7/11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Aspen Institute’s Faculty Pioneer Award is the "Oscars of the business school world" according to The Financial Times.&lt;ref name="aspen" /&gt;   Award recipients are recognized for demonstrating "leadership and risk-taking in integrating ethical, environmental and social issues into the business curriculum."&lt;ref name="asu1"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Aspen Institute Announces Arizona State University’s Jay Golden as Winner of 2009 Faculty Pioneer Award|url=http://schoolofsustainability.asu.edu/news/gios-news/the-aspen-institute-announces-arizona-state-university%E2%80%99s-jay-golden-as-winner-of-2009-faculty-pioneer-award|publisher=ASU School of Sustainability – Current News|accessdate=6/7/11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Golden was recognized as a "Rising Star" for his commitment to "developing curriculum that fosters multidisciplinary approaches to solving pressing sustainability imperatives for business and society" and his roles as director of ASU’s Certificate of Sustainable Technologies and Management program and founder and co-director of the summer Sustainable Energy Fellowship program with colleagues from [[MIT]], [[Cornell]], Duke and the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref name=aspen /&gt;  Also highlighted by the Aspen Institute was the research published by Golden and his Sustainability Consortium, the results of which have "provided a platform for the development of a more holistic approach to quantifying the sustainability of consumer products that accounts for all phases of a product’s life cycle."&lt;ref name=aspen /&gt;

In December 2009, '''Golden was designated Number 23 of the 100 Most Influential People in Business Ethics''' by [[Ethisphere Magazine]] for his work (as Co-Director of the Sustainability Consortium) with Wal-Mart on their sustainability index initiative.&lt;ref name=ethi&gt;{{cite web|title=2009’s 100 Most Influential People in Business Ethics, December 16, 2009|url=http://ethisphere.com/2009s-100-most-influential-people-in-business-ethics/#list|publisher=Ethisphere|accessdate=6/7/11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This recognition was given to individuals that had a "significant impact in the realm of business ethics over the course of the year [2009]".&lt;ref name=ethi /&gt;

Golden was also awarded an Industrial Ecology Fellowship by [[AT&amp;T]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=asu4 /&gt;

== Scholarly contributions ==

=== Sustainable Systems: Theory to Application ===
Golden is best known for his translational work on Sustainable Systems exploring the theoretical underpinnings and drivers on the science of sustainability and applying those theories and models to intervention strategies.  Golden's research worked to build on the late [[Jay Wright Forrester|Jay Forrester]] of MIT and members of his lineage at MIT including [[Donella Meadows|Donela Meadows]], one of the lead authors of [[The Limits to Growth|Limits to Growth]].  His early work was focused on exploring the dynamics of radiative forces on urban infrastructure and the resultant impacts to energy, climate and environmental systems.  His later and current work has been focused on Production-Consumption Systems and the role that institutions play using control theory and process life cycle assessment modeling.  Golden in partnership with Dr. Robert Handfield, the Bank of American Distinguished Professor of Supply Chain Management at North Carolina State University have co-authored multiple reports to Congress on the environmental and economic impacts of the emergent biobased economy. 

Golden who has published over 150 articles has been a Guest Editor and author for the Sustainable Sciences section of the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proceedings of the National Academies of Science]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (PNAS). He has been published in [[Nature Ecology and Evolution|Nature]] on the Blue Economy, COES, Journal of Industrial Ecology, International Journal of Sustainable Energy and has served as a co-editor for multiple peer-reviewed journals.  He has testified before Congress and chaired Sustainable Engineering workshops and conferences for the National Academy of Engineering.

Golden has worked at informal settlements in Africa as part of a Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Grant on Supercritical Oxidation to transform human wastes into potable water and energy.  He has been funded by NSF, NIH/CDC, TRB, NASA, USDA, GSA, US EPA, NIST and numerous foundations and industry.  Golden has also authored publications and guidebooks on Life Cycle Assessment Modeling for the United Nations Environment Programme.  

Dr. Golden has given over 100 invited presentations including to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering in Korea, Royal Academy of Engineering, AAAS symposium on Sustainability Science, American Meteorological Society, Pew Center, NSF and to numerous companies and board of directors throughout the globe.


=== Founding and Directing the Sustainability Consortium ===
The Sustainability Consortium was founded in 2009 by Jay Golden (ASU) and Jon Johnson ([[University of Arkansas]]) and continues to be jointly administered by the two universities today.&lt;ref name=uofark&gt;{{cite web|title=Walton College Professor in 100 Most Influential People in Business Ethics, January 21, 2010|url=http://newswire.uark.edu/article.aspx?id=13427|publisher=University of Arkansas Newswire|accessdate=7 June 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sustcon9&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sustainability Consortium Home Page|url=http://www.sustainabilityconsortium.org/|publisher=The Sustainability Consortium|accessdate=7 June 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Walmart]] Stores Inc. provided the initial financial investment that allowed the creation of the Sustainability Consortium and since then several other large corporations have joined (including companies like [[McDonald's]], [[Disney]] and [[Coca-Cola]]).&lt;ref name=sustcon9 /&gt;&lt;ref name=sustcon10&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Members|url=http://www.sustainabilityconsortium.org/members/|website=The Sustainability Consortium|publisher=The Sustainability Consortium|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the history of the Sustainability Consortium, Golden said "It became very clear to us that no one researcher, no one institution, could do that[quantify the sustainability of products] because you're dealing with geographies around the world and with various sciences – physical, life, and engineering – and that required a multidisciplinary approach. So we outlined a proposal to Walmart to develop a consortium of academic researchers from institutions to think through the process and try to bring it to life based on the best available sound science and engineering principles available."&lt;ref name=GreenBiz&gt;{{cite web|last1=Makower|first1=Joel|title=Inside Walmart's Sustainability Consortium|url=http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2009/08/17/inside-walmarts-sustainability-consortium|publisher=GreenBiz|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walmart’s goal in creating the Consortium was to "develop a global database of information on the lifecycle of products – from raw materials to disposal" in order to develop a "worldwide sustainable product index" which would aid in the creation of a "simple rating for consumers about the sustainability of products".&lt;ref name=walmart&gt;{{cite web|title=Walmart Announces Sustainable Product Index|url=http://news.walmart.com/news-archive/2009/07/16/walmart-announces-sustainable-product-index|publisher=Walmart|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=asu13&gt;{{cite web|title=ASU and the U of AR Work with Walmart on Developing Sustainable Product Index|url=http://schoolofsustainability.asu.edu/news/gios-news/arizona-state-university-and-the-university-of-arkansas-to-work-with-walmart-on-developing-sustainable-product-index-for-consumer-products-world-wide|publisher=ASU School of Sustainability – Current News|accessdate=7 June 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked in July 2009 about the creation of the Sustainability Consortium Golden said "Today an idea has come to reality, and it is even more exciting to envision the outcomes of the next part of this effort, as we create the science, technologies and strategies that vastly transform how businesses operate and how sustainability is infused into our everyday life."&lt;ref name=uofark2&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Arkansas and Arizona State University Work with Walmart on Developing Sustainable Product Index for Consumer Products, July 16, 2009|url=http://sustainability.uark.edu/15347.php|publisher=University of Arkansas – Sustainability}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Golden emphasized the "transparency" of the research being done by the Consortium, with information on product lifecycle and consumer research available to all companies regardless of their membership status.&lt;ref name=greenbiz&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside Walmart's Sustainability Consortium, Joel Makower, August 17, 2009|url=http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2009/08/17/inside-walmarts-sustainability-consortium|publisher=Greenbiz.com|accessdate=7 June 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other scholarly contributions ===
In 2004, during his time at Arizona State University, Golden created ASU’s Certificate of Sustainable Technologies and Management program.&lt;ref name=asu1 /&gt;  He also founded and co-directed the Sustainable Energy Fellowship, a summer program in partnership with MIT, Cornell, Univ. of Michigan, ASU and Duke that exposed undergraduate students from around the country to "research and education in energy production, conversion, storage and sources that are environmentally friendly and renewable" educating them on "critical sustainability, energy, and climate change challenges faced by business."&lt;ref name=asu1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=sustfellow&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Program|url=http://www.teachenergy.org/about|publisher=Sustainable Energy Fellowship|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also during his time at ASU, Golden served as a Special Advisor to the Mayor of Phoenix on Sustainable Technologies, a Special Advisor for Sustainability to the management team at the [[Dial Corporation]] and helped found the ASU chapter of [[Engineers Without Borders]].&lt;ref name=asu18&gt;{{cite web|title=Jay Golden|url=http://sustainability.asu.edu/research/bio/3817/jay-golden|publisher=ASU Global Institute of Sustainability|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Golden was the founder and director of the EPA-designated National Center of Excellence on SMART (Sustainable Materials &amp; Renewable Technologies) Innovations at ASU.&lt;ref name=asu4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=asu18 /&gt;  The Center "partners with industries and governments worldwide to develop a new generation of strategies and technologies to address climate-energy system impacts" with a focus on "engineering innovations for sustainable materials and renewable technologies".&lt;ref name=bren /&gt;&lt;ref name=asu4 /&gt;

The '''La Amistad International Park''', or in Spanish {{lang|es|'''Parque Internacional La Amistad'''}}, formerly the '''La Amistad National Park''', is a [[Transboundary Protected Area]] in [[Latin America]], management of which is shared between [[Costa Rica]] ([[Caribbean La Amistad Conservation Area|Caribbean La Amistad]] and [[Pacific La Amistad Conservation Area|Pacific La Amistad]] Conservation Areas) and [[Panama]], following a recommendation by [[UNESCO]] after the park's inclusion in the [[World Heritage Site]] list.

==Geography==
The park area is equally split between Costa Rica and Panama, as part of the former ''La Amistad Reserves'' of the [[Cordillera de Talamanca|Talamanca]] mountain range. It covers 401,000 ha of tropical forest and is the largest nature reserve in Central America; together with a 15&amp;nbsp;km buffer zone, it represents a major biodiversity resource at a regional (ca 20% of the region's species diversity) and global level.

[[File:La Amistad International Park.JPG|thumb|none|upright=1.5|Forest in the Park]]

This is recognized in its strategic position in the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor and its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its cross-frontier position gives it unique potential to improve bioregional planning. The park’s buffer zone includes coffee and beef producers and indigenous subsistence farmers. As a consequence of the difficulty of the terrain, the park is relatively unexplored and the only substantial scientific explorations deep into the park have been led by the Natural History Museum London, INBio and the University of Panama in the last 6&amp;nbsp;years (2003–2008).

In 2006 the UK's [[Darwin Initiative]] funded a three-year collaborative project led by the Natural History Museum, London, INBio (Costa Rica) and ANAM (Panama). The aim of the Initiative was to generate baseline biodiversity information for the park and a map of the biodiversity. This involved a series of seven multi-disciplinary and international expeditions to remote parts of La Amistad during which over 7,500 plant, 17,000 beetle and 380 herpetological collections were made and deposited in the national collections of Costa Rica and Panama. These expeditions also led to the discovery of 12 plant species, one dung beetle species, 15 amphibian and three reptile species new to science.

Five species of big cats roam the park: [[Puma (animal)|pumas]], [[ocelots]], [[margay]], [[jaguars]], and [[jaguarundis]]. It has 600 species of birds, including the [[three-wattled bellbird]], [[resplendent quetzal]], [[yellow-green finch]], and [[bare-necked umbrellabird]]. Three indigenous tribes – the [[Naso_people|Naso]], [[Bribri]], and [[Ngöbe-Buglé]] – also live within the park. These indigenous groups live in small, traditional villages.

==Areas of responsibility==

The Ministry of Health Duane Sands &lt;ref&gt;  [http://www.tribune242.com/news/2017/may/17/nhi-will-not-be-cancelled-will-change/?news/ "Nhi Will Not Be Cancelled - But Will Change" ] ''Tribune 242'', May 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  seeks to provide the leadership necessary to ensure and guard the protection and promotion of the health of all residents. It provides all residents with access to comprehensive, preventive, quality healthcare services and care.

The Ministry of Health seeks to protect the health of Bahamian residents against both current and emerging health threats. This is achieved, in part, by: helping individuals acquire the skills to live responsible, healthy and independent lives; providing a range of accessible, affordable services that assist individuals, families and communities to reach their full health potential; and monitoring both current and emerging disease threats.

The Ministry operates from a social model of health, whereby improvements in health and well-being are achieved by directing efforts towards addressing the social and environmental determinants of health, among others. The delivery of healthcare in The Bahamas is integrated and co-ordinated around the needs of residents, rather than service types, professional boundaries or organisational structure.

==Departments and agencies==

===Technical Directorate===

The Technical Directorate of the Ministry is composed of the Chief Medical Officer, Director of Public Health, and Director of Nursing.

The Chief Medical Officer advises both the Minister and the Permanent Secretary on technical, health matters.

The Director of Public Health has oversight for the Department of Public Health and advises the Permanent Secretary on all Public Health Matters.

The Director of Nursing  directs and advises the Permanent Secretary on all Nursing Matters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhibahamas.gov.bs/health-system-strengthening/ Public Health]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids''' ('''[[E number|E]]471''') refers to a [[food additive]] composed of [[diglycerides]] and [[monoglycerides]] which is used as an [[emulsifier]]. This mixture is also sometimes referred to as '''partial glycerides'''.

==Synthesis==
[[Monoglycerides]] and [[diglycerides]] are both naturally present in various [[seed oil]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flickinger|first1=Brent D.|last2=Matsuo|first2=Noboru|title=Nutritional characteristics of DAG oil|journal=Lipids|date=February 2003|volume=38|issue=2|pages=129–132|doi=10.1007/s11745-003-1042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; however their concentration is usually low and industrial production is primarily achieved by a [[glycerolysis]] reaction between [[triglycerides]] (fats/oils) and [[glycerol]].&lt;ref name="Sonntag1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sonntag|first1=Norman O.

==Concerns for vegetarian and religious diets==
E471 is mainly produced from vegetable oils, although animal fats are sometimes used and cannot be completely excluded as being present in the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarke|first1=Chris|title=The Science of Ice Cream|date=2012|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|isbn=9781849731270|page=55|quote=Mono-/diglycerides are made by partially hydrolysing vegetable fats, such as soybean oil, and palm oil. (Animal-fat-based emulsifiers are not commonly used because they are not suitable for vegetarian and certain religious diets).}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fatty acids from each source are chemically identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Which E-numbers and additives are from animal origin ?|url=http://www.food-info.net/uk/qa/qa-fi45.htm|website=Food-Info.net|publisher=Wageningen University|accessdate=4 September 2015|location=Netherlands|quote=Chemically the fatty acids from animal or plant origin are identical. Therefore the origin is of no importance for the function in the food. Producers thus normally choose the cheapest oils to make these fats. This is generally some vegetable oil. However, animal fats can not be excluded.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Vegan Society]], which discourages eating animal-based foods, flags E471 as a "thing to look out for" that "can be animal OR non-animal based".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vegan Catering For All |url=https://www.vegansociety.com/sites/default/files/VeganCateringForAll.pdf|website=The Vegan Society|accessdate=4 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904134302/https://www.vegansociety.com/sites/default/files/VeganCateringForAll.pdf|archivedate=4 September 2015|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apollo 11 Crew During Training Exercise - GPN-2002-000032.jpg|thumb|[[Astronaut]]s [[Buzz Aldrin]] and [[Neil Armstrong]] in NASA's training [[mockup]] of the Moon and lander module. Conspiracy theorists say that the films of the missions were made using sets similar to this training mockup.]]

'''Moon landing conspiracy theories''' claim that some or all elements of the [[Apollo program]] and the associated [[Moon landing]]s were [[hoax]]es staged by [[NASA]], possibly with the aid of other organizations. The most notable claim is that the [[List of Apollo missions#Manned Apollo missions|six manned landings (1969–72)]] were faked and that [[List of Apollo astronauts#Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon|12 Apollo astronauts]] did not actually walk on the [[Moon]]. Various groups and individuals have made claims since the mid-1970s that NASA and others knowingly misled the public into believing the landings happened, by manufacturing, tampering with, or destroying evidence including photos, [[telemetry]] tapes, radio and TV transmissions, [[Moon rock]] samples, and even killing some key witnesses.

Much [[third-party evidence for Apollo Moon landings|third-party evidence for the landings]] exists, and detailed rebuttals to the hoax claims have been made.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], pp. 154–173&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 2000s, high-definition photos taken by the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] (LRO) of the Apollo landing sites have captured the lander modules and the tracks left by the astronauts.&lt;ref name="NASA LRO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/news/apollo-sites.html |title=NASA Spacecraft Images Offer Sharper Views of Apollo Landing Sites |last1=Neal-Jones |first1=Nancy |last2=Zubritsky |first2=Elizabeth |last3=Cole |first3=Steve |editor-last=Garner |editor-first=Robert |date=September 6, 2011 |publisher=NASA |id=Goddard Release No. 11-058 (co-issued as NASA HQ Release No. 11-289) |accessdate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/index.php?/archives/620-Question-Answered!.html |title=LRO slewed 19° down-Sun allowing the illuminated side of the still standing American flag to be captured at the Apollo 17 landing site.

[[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracists]] have managed to sustain public interest in their theories for more than 40 years, despite the rebuttals and third-party evidence. Opinion polls taken in various locations have shown that between 6% and 20% of Americans, 25% of Britons, and 28% of Russians surveyed believe that the manned landings were faked. Even as late as 2001, the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox television network]] documentary ''Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?'' claimed NASA faked the first landing in 1969 to win the [[Space Race]].&lt;ref name="greatmoonhoax"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast23feb_2/ |title=The Great Moon Hoax |last=Phillips |first=Tony |date=February 23, 2001 |work=Science@NASA |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=July 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
An early and influential book about the subject of a moon-landing conspiracy, ''We Never Went to the Moon: America's Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle'', was [[Self-publishing|self-published]] in 1976 by [[Bill Kaysing]], a former [[U.S. Navy|US Navy]] officer with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in English.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having no knowledge of rockets or technical writing,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Kaysing was hired as a senior [[technical writer]] in 1956 by [[Rocketdyne]], the company that built the [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1]] engines used on the [[Saturn V]] rocket.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002]], p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://billkaysing.com/biography.php |title=A brief biography of Bill Kaysing |last=Kaysing |first=Wendy L. |publisher=BillKaysing.com |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as head of the technical publications unit at the company's Propulsion Field Laboratory until 1963. Kaysing's book made many allegations, and effectively began discussion of the Moon landings being faked.&lt;ref name=k-pg7 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The book claims that the chance of a successful manned landing on the Moon was calculated to be 0.0017%, and that despite close monitoring by the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], it would have been easier for NASA to fake the Moon landings than to really go there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://braeunig.us/space/hoax.htm |title=Did we land on the Moon? |last=Braeunig |first=Robert A. |date=November 2006 |website=Rocket and Space Technology |publisher=Robert Braeunig |accessdate=May 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522183404/http://www.braeunig.us/space/hoax.htm |archivedate=May 22, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billkaysing.com/hoaxtheory.php |last=Galuppini |first=Albino |title=Hoax Theory |publisher=BillKaysing.com |accessdate=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the [[Flat Earth Society]] accused NASA of faking the landings, arguing that they were staged by Hollywood with [[Walt Disney]] sponsorship, based on a script by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] and directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]].&lt;ref group=Note&gt;In 1968, Clarke and Kubrick had collaborated on the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', which realistically portrayed a Moon mission.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schadewald |first=Robert J. |authorlink=Robert Schadewald |date=July 1980 |title=The Flat-out Truth: Earth Orbits?

She notes that this happened during the post-[[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] era, when American citizens were [[Credibility gap|inclined to distrust official accounts]]. Dégh writes: "The mass media catapult these half-truths into a kind of twilight zone where people can make their guesses sound as truths. Mass media have a terrible impact on people who lack guidance."&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.09/moon.land.html?pg=5 |title=The Wrong Stuff |last=van Bakel |first=Rogier |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]] |location=New York |issue=2.09 |date=September 1994 |page=5 |accessdate=August 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[A Man on the Moon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#Chaikin|Chaikin 2007]] (page needed)&lt;/ref&gt; first published in 1994, [[Andrew Chaikin]] mentions that at the time of [[Apollo 8]]'s [[Lunar orbit|lunar-orbit]] mission in December 1968,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Attivissimo|Attivissimo 2013]], p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; similar conspiracy ideas were already in circulation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dick &amp; Launius|Dick &amp; Launius 2007]], pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Marcus Allen (publisher)|Marcus Allen]] – British publisher of ''[[Nexus (magazine)|Nexus]]'', who said photographs of the lander would not prove that the United States put men on the Moon, and "Getting to the Moon really isn't much of a problem – [[Luna 2|the Russians did that in 1959]]. The big problem is getting people there." He suggests that NASA sent robot missions because [[radiation]] levels in [[outer space]] would be deadly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World's biggest telescope to prove Americans really walked on Moon |first=Robert |last=Matthews |authorlink=Robert Matthews (scientist) |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1414144/Worlds-biggest-telescope-to-prove-Americans-really-walked-on-Moon.html |date=November 24, 2002 |newspaper=[[The Sunday Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |location=London |accessdate=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variant of this idea has it that NASA and its contractors did not recover quickly enough from the [[Apollo 1]] fire, and so all the early Apollo missions were faked, with [[Apollo 14|Apollos 14]] or [[Apollo 15|15]] being the first real mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cosmoquest.org/forum/archive/index.php/t-1180.html |title=Irrefutable proof [Archive&amp;#93; – Bad Astronomy and Universe Today Forum |date=May 3, 2002 |publisher=[[Bad Astronomy]] |type=Forum |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Claimed motives of the United States and NASA ==
Those who believe the Moon landings were faked give several theories about the motives of NASA and the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]]. The three main theories are below.

=== The Space Race ===
Motivation for the United States to engage the [[Soviet Union]] in a [[Space Race]] can be traced to the then on-going [[Cold War]]. Landing on the Moon was viewed as a national and technological accomplishment that would generate world-wide acclaim. But going to the Moon would be risky and expensive, as exemplified by [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy#Space program|John F. Kennedy]] famously stating in [[We choose to go to the Moon|a 1962 speech]] that the [[United States]] chose to go ''because'' it was hard.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Chaikin|Chaikin 2007]], p. 2, "We choose to go to the Moon! We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things – not because they are easy, but because they are ''hard.''" – Kennedy speaking at [[Rice University]], September 12, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoax theory-debunker [[Philip Plait]] says in his book ''[[Bad Astronomy]]'', that the Soviets – with [[Soviet manned lunar programs|their own competing Moon program]], an [[nuclear espionage|extensive intelligence network]] and a formidable scientific community able to analyze NASA data – would have cried foul if the United States tried to fake a Moon landing,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; especially since their own program had failed. Proving a hoax would have been a huge propaganda win for the Soviets. Conspiracist [[Bart Sibrel]] responded, "the Soviets did not have the capability to track deep space craft until late in 1972, immediately after which, the last three Apollo missions were abruptly canceled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moonmovie.com/faq.htm |title=Moon Hoax MOONMOVIE.COM Frequently Asked Questions |work=Moonmovie.com |publisher=AFTH, LLC |location=Nashville, TN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212134517/http://www.moonmovie.com/faq.htm |archivedate=February 12, 2008 |accessdate=August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, the Soviets had been sending [[unmanned spacecraft]] to the Moon since 1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/gal114/SpaceRace/sec300/sec361.htm |title=Soviet Lunar Programs |website=Space Race |publisher=[[National Air and Space Museum]] |location=Washington, D.C. |type=Online version of exhibition on view in Gallery 114 |accessdate=November 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "during 1962, deep space tracking facilities were introduced at IP-15 in [[Ussuriysk|Ussuriisk]] and IP-16 in [[Yevpatoria|Evpatoria]] (Crimean Peninsula), while Saturn communication stations were added to IP-3, 4 and 14,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/kik.html |title=Russia's space command and control infrastructure |last=Zak |first=Anatoly |website=RussianSpaceWeb.com |publisher=Anatoly Zak |accessdate=November 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708063431/http://www.russianspaceweb.com/kik.html |archivedate=July 8, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter having a 100 million km range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/articles/sovstems.htm |title=Soviet Space Tracking Systems |work=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]] |publisher=Mark Wade |accessdate=November 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101224934/http://www.astronautix.com/articles/sovstems.htm |archivedate=November 1, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union tracked the Apollo missions at the Space Transmissions Corps, which was "fully equipped with the latest intelligence-gathering and surveillance equipment."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scheaffer|Scheaffer 2004]], p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vasily Mishin]], in an interview for the article "The Moon Programme That Faltered," describes how the Soviet Moon program dwindled after the Apollo landings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=March 1991 |title=The Moon Programme That Faltered |journal=[[Spaceflight (magazine)|Spaceflight]] |volume=33 |pages=2–3 |location=London |publisher=[[British Interplanetary Society]]|bibcode=1991SpFl...33....2. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, there was nothing "abrupt" about the [[Canceled Apollo missions|Apollo cancelations]], which were announced in January and September 1970 for cost-cutting reasons.&lt;ref name="Cancelled Apollos"&gt;"[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo_18_20.html Apollo 18 through 20 – The Canceled Missions]", Dr. David R. Williams, NASA, accessed July 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; (See '''Vietnam War''' below.)

=== NASA funding and prestige ===
Conspiracy theorists claim that NASA faked the landings to avoid humiliation and to ensure that it continued to get funding. NASA raised "about US$30 billion" to go to the Moon, and [[Bill Kaysing|Kaysing]] claimed in his book that this could have been used to "pay off" many people.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002]], p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Since most conspiracists believe that sending men to the Moon was impossible at the time,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Attivissimo|Attivissimo 2013]], p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; they argue that landings had to be faked to fulfill Kennedy's 1961 goal, "before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth."&lt;ref name="Special Message"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Kennedy, John F. |date=May 25, 1961 |title=Special Message to Congress on Urgent National Needs |medium=Motion picture (excerpt) |url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/xzw1gaeeTES6khED14P1Iw.aspx |accessdate=August 1, 2013 |publisher=John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum |location=Boston, MA |id=Accession Number: TNC:200; Digital Identifier: TNC-200-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, NASA accounted for the cost of Apollo to the US Congress in 1973, totaling US$25.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Congress, House of Representatives, Committee on Science and Astronautics |title=1974 NASA Authorization Hearings |type=Hearing on H.R. 4567 |year=1973 |publisher=[[93rd United States Congress|93rd Congress]], first session |location=Washington, D.C. |oclc=23229007 |ref=93rd Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Bennett and David Percy have claimed in ''Dark Moon: Apollo and the Whistle-Blowers'', that, with all the known and unknown hazards,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bennett &amp; Percy|Bennett &amp; Percy 2001]], p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; NASA would not risk broadcasting an astronaut getting sick or dying on live television.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bennett &amp; Percy|Bennett &amp; Percy 2001]], pp. 330–31&lt;/ref&gt; The counter-argument generally given is that NASA in fact ''did'' incur a great deal of public humiliation and potential political opposition to the program by losing an entire crew in the [[Apollo 1]] fire during a ground test, leading to its upper management team being questioned by Senate and House of Representatives space oversight committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== Vietnam War ===
The American Patriot Friends Network claimed in 2009 that the landings helped the United States government distract public attention from the unpopular [[Role of the United States in the Vietnam War#Americanization|Vietnam War]], and so manned landings suddenly ended about the same time that the United States ended its involvement in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apfn.org/apfn/moon.htm |title=Was The Apollo Moon Landing Fake? |date=July 21, 2009 |website=American Patriot Friends Network (APFN) |publisher=APFN.org |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the ending of the landings was not "sudden" (see '''The Space Race''' above). The war was one of several federal budget items with which NASA had to compete; NASA's budget peaked in 1966, and fell by 42.3% by 1972.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Office of Management and Budget&lt;/ref&gt; This was the reason the final flights were cut, along with plans for even more ambitious follow-on programs such as a permanent [[space station]] and manned flight to Mars.&lt;ref&gt;Hepplewhite, T.A. [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4221/sp4221.htm ''The Space Shuttle Decision: NASA's Search for a Reusable Space Vehicle''], chapter 4. Washington, DC: National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hoax claims and rebuttals==
Many Moon-landing conspiracy theories have been put forward, claiming either that the landings did not happen and that NASA employees have lied, or that the landings did happen but not in the way that has been told. Conspiracists have focused on perceived gaps or inconsistencies in the historical record of the missions. The foremost idea is that the whole manned landing program was a hoax from start to end. Some claim that the technology to send men to the Moon was lacking or that the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s, [[solar flare]]s, [[solar wind]], [[coronal mass ejection]]s and [[cosmic ray]]s made such a trip impossible.&lt;ref name=k-pg7&gt;[[#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002]], p. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Vince Calder and Andrew Johnson, scientists from [[Argonne National Laboratory]], have given detailed answers to  conspiracists' claims on the laboratory's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/gen01/gen01278.htm |last1=Calder |first1=Vince |last2=Johnson |first2=Andrew, P.E.|last3=ProfHoff 503 |title=Ask A Scientist|date=October 12, 2002|work=Newton |publisher=[[Argonne National Laboratory]] |accessdate=August 14, 2009 |display-authors=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They show that NASA's portrayal of the Moon landing is fundamentally accurate, allowing for such common mistakes as mislabeled photos and imperfect personal recollections. Using the [[scientific process]], any hypothesis that is contradicted by the observable facts may be rejected. The 'real landing' hypothesis is a single story since it comes from a single source, but there is no unity in the hoax hypothesis because hoax accounts vary between conspiracists.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ramsay|Ramsay 2006]] (page needed)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Number of conspirators involved ===
According to [[James Longuski]] (Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics Engineering at [[Purdue University]]), the conspiracy theories are impossible because of their size and complexity. The conspiracy would have to involve more than 400,000 people who worked on the Apollo project for nearly ten years, the 12 men who walked on the Moon, the six others who flew with them as [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module]] pilots, and another six astronauts who orbited the Moon.&lt;ref group=Note&gt; This number includes the crews of Apollos 8, [[Apollo 10|10]], and [[Apollo 13|13]], though the latter technically only performed a fly-by. These three missions account for only six additional astronauts because James Lovell orbited the Moon twice (Apollos 8 and 13) and John Young and Gene Cernan orbited on Apollo 10 both later landed on the Moon.&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of thousands of people – including astronauts, scientists, engineers, technicians, and skilled laborers – would have had to keep the secret. Longuski argues that it would have been much easier to really land on the Moon than to generate such a huge conspiracy to fake the landings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Longuski|Longuski 2006]], p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aaronovitch|Aaronovitch 2010]], pp. 1–2, 6&lt;/ref&gt; To date, nobody from the United States government or NASA linked to the Apollo program has said the Moon landings were hoaxes. [[Penn Jillette]] made note of this in the "Conspiracy Theories" episode of his television show ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!]]'' in 2005.&lt;ref name="bullshit"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Conspiracy Theories |series=[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!]] |network=[[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] |airdate=May 9, 2005 |season=3 |number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the number of people involved, and noting the [[Watergate scandal]], Jillette noted that ''someone'' would have outed the hoax by now.

=== Photographic and film oddities ===
{{Main|Examination of Apollo Moon photographs}}

Moon-landing conspiracists focus heavily on NASA photos. They point to oddities in photos and films taken on the Moon. Photography experts (including those unrelated to NASA) have replied that the oddities are consistent with what should be expected from a real Moon landing, and are not consistent with tweaked or studio imagery. Some main arguments and counter-arguments are listed below.

1. In some photos, the [[Reticle|crosshairs]] appear to be behind objects. The cameras were fitted with a [[Réseau plate]] (a clear glass plate with a [[reticle]] etched on), making it impossible for any photographed object to appear "in front" of the grid. Conspiracists often use this evidence to suggest that objects were "pasted" over the photographs, and hence obscure the reticle.

:* ''This effect only appears in copied and scanned photos, not any originals. It is caused by overexposure: the bright white areas of the emulsion "bleed" over the thin black crosshairs. The crosshairs are only about 0.004 inches thick (0.1 mm) and emulsion would only have to bleed about half that much to fully obscure it. Furthermore, there are many photos where the middle of the crosshair is "washed-out" but the rest is intact. In some photos of the American flag, parts of one crosshair appear on the red stripes, but parts of the same crosshair are faded or invisible on the white stripes. There would have been no reason to "paste" white stripes onto the flag.&lt;ref name="clavius-crosshairs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clavius.org/photoret.html |title=Clavius: Photography – Crosshairs |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Crosshairs are sometimes rotated or in the wrong place.

:* ''This is a result of popular photos being cropped and/or rotated for aesthetic impact.''&lt;ref name="clavius-crosshairs" /&gt;

3. The quality of the photographs is implausibly high.

NASA chose to publish only the best examples.''&lt;ref name="clavius-crosshairs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clavius.org/photoqual.html | title=Clavius: Photography – image quality |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4. There are no [[star]]s in any of the photos; the [[Apollo 11]] astronauts also stated in post-mission press conferences that they did not remember seeing any stars during [[Extravehicular activity|EVA]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002]], pp. 20, 21, 22, 23&lt;/ref&gt; Conspiracists contend that [[NASA]] chose not to put the stars into the [[photograph|photo]]s because [[astronomer]]s would have been able to use them to determine whether the photos were taken from the Earth or the [[Moon]], by means of identifying them and comparing their celestial position and [[parallax]] to what would be expected for either observation site.

:* ''The astronauts were talking about naked-eye sightings of stars during the lunar daytime. They regularly sighted stars through the spacecraft navigation optics while aligning their inertial reference platforms, the [[Apollo PGNCS]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-AOTNavStarsDetents.html |title=Navigation Stars used in the AOT |last1=Jones |first1=Eric M. |date=January 21, 2012 |website=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=September 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* ''Stars are rarely seen in [[Space Shuttle]], [[Mir]], Earth observation photos, or even photos taken at sporting events held at night. The light from the [[Sun]] in outer space in the Earth-Moon system is at least as bright as the [[sunlight]] that reaches the Earth's surface on a clear day at noon, so [[camera]]s used for imaging subjects illuminated by sunlight are set for a [[Sunny 16 rule|daylight exposure]]. The dim light of the stars simply does not provide enough [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]] to record visible images. All manned landings happened during the lunar daytime. Thus, the stars were outshone by the sun and by sunlight reflected off the Moon's surface. The astronauts' eyes were adapted to the sunlit landscape around them so that they could not see the relatively faint stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/earthmatters/2011/09/28/where-are-the-stars/?src=twitter-em |title=Where are the stars? |last=Carlowicz |first=Mike |date=September 28, 2011 |work=[[NASA Earth Observatory]] |publisher=NASA |type=Blog |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], pp. 158–60&lt;/ref&gt; The astronauts could see stars with the naked eye only when they were in the shadow of the Moon.''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Woods|Woods 2008]], pp. 206–07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harrison|Harrison 2012]], pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt;

:* ''Camera settings can turn a well-lit background to black when the foreground object is brightly lit, forcing the camera to increase shutter speed so that the foreground light does not wash out the image. A demonstration of this effect is here.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Lamp-and-moon-example-2.JPG]]&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is similar to not being able to see stars from a brightly lit car park at night – the stars only become visible when the lights are turned off. 

:* ''A special far [[ultraviolet]] camera, the [[Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph]], was taken to the lunar surface on [[Apollo 16]] and operated in the shadow of the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] (LM). It took photos of Earth and of many stars, some of which are dim in visible light but bright in the ultraviolet. These observations were later matched with observations taken by orbiting ultraviolet telescopes. Furthermore, the positions of those stars with respect to Earth are correct for the time and location of the Apollo 16 photos.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Keel |first=William C. |date=July 2007 |title=The Earth and Stars in the Lunar Sky |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=47–50 |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/space/Apollo16EarthID.gif |title=Apollo16EarthID.gif |last=Keel |first=William C. |website=UA Astronomy Home Page  |format=[[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] |accessdate=May 8, 2013}} Base image: AS16-123-19657; Earth image start: 1233 CDT 21 April 1972; Field shown: 18.9 degrees.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

5. The angle and color of shadows are inconsistent. This suggests that artificial lights were used.

:* ''Shadows on the Moon are complicated by reflected light, uneven ground, [[wide-angle lens]] distortion, and [[lunar dust]]. There are several light sources: the Sun, sunlight reflected from the Earth, sunlight reflected from the Moon's surface, and sunlight reflected from the astronauts and the Lunar Module. Light from these sources is scattered by lunar dust in many directions, including into shadows. Shadows falling into craters and hills may appear longer, shorter and distorted.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], pp. 167–72&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, shadows display the properties of [[vanishing point]] perspective, leading them to converge to a point on the horizon.''
:* This theory was further debunked on the ''[[MythBusters]]'' episode "[[MythBusters (2008 season)#Episode 104 – "NASA Moon Landing"|NASA Moon Landing]]".

6. There are identical backgrounds in photos which, according to their captions, were taken miles apart. This suggests that a painted background was used.

:* ''Backgrounds were not identical, just similar. What appear as nearby hills in some photos are actually mountains many miles away. On Earth, objects that are further away will appear fainter and less detailed. On the Moon, there is no [[atmosphere]] or [[haze]] to obscure faraway objects, thus they appear clearer and nearer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iangoddard.com/moon01.htm |title=Goddard's Journal: Are Apollo Moon Photos Fake? |last=Goddard |first=Ian Williams |date=February 26, 2001 |website=Iangoddard.com |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there are very few objects (such as trees) to help judge distance. One such case is debunked in "Who Mourns For Apollo?" by Mike Bara.&lt;ref name="whomourns"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studyphysics.ca/apollo2.pdf |title=Who Mourns For Apollo?

7. The number of photos taken is implausibly high. Up to one photo per 50 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aulis.com/skeleton.htm |title=The skeleton in NASA's spacesuit |last=White |first=Jack |year=2005 |website=AULIS Online |publisher=AULIS Publishing |location=London |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* ''Simplified gear with fixed settings allowed two photos a second. Many were taken immediately after each other as stereo pairs or panorama sequences. The calculation (one per 50 seconds) was based on a lone astronaut on the surface, and does not take into account that there were two astronauts sharing the workload and simultaneously taking photographs during an [[Extra-vehicular activity]] (EVA).''

8. The photos contain artifacts like the two seemingly matching 'C's on a rock and on the ground. These may be labeled studio props.

:* ''The "C"-shaped objects are most likely printing imperfections and do not appear in the original film from the camera. It has been suggested that the "C" is a coiled hair.&lt;ref name="whomourns" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clavius.org/rover1.html |title=Clavius: Photo Analysis – lunar rover |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

9. A resident of [[Perth|Perth, Western Australia]], a woman named Una Ronald (a pseudonym created by the authors of the source&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bennett &amp; Percy|Bennett &amp; Percy 2001]], p. 321&lt;/ref&gt;), said that for two or three seconds she saw a [[Coca-Cola]] bottle roll across the lower right quadrant of her television screen that was displaying the live broadcast of the Apollo 11 EVA. She also said that several letters appeared in ''[[The West Australian]]'' discussing the Coca-Cola bottle incident within ten days of the lunar landing.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bennett &amp; Percy|Bennett &amp; Percy 2001]], pp. 319–20&lt;/ref&gt;

:* '' It was used instead of the only existing real images, from the TV monitor, which the editors seemingly felt were too grainy for their book. The book publishers did not work for NASA.''

11. There appear to be "hot spots" in some photos that look like a large spotlight was used in place of the sun.

:* '' Pits on the Moon's surface focus and reflect light like the tiny glass spheres used in the coating of street signs, or dewdrops on wet grass. This creates a glow around the photographer's own shadow when it appears in a photograph (see [[Heiligenschein]]).''
:* ''If the astronaut is standing in sunlight while photographing into shade, light reflected off his white spacesuit yields a similar effect to a spotlight.&lt;ref name="bootspot" /&gt;''

12. Who filmed Neil Armstrong stepping onto the Moon?

:* ''The Lunar Module did. While still on the Module's ladder steps, Armstrong deployed the Modularized Equipment Stowage Assembly from the side of the Lunar Module, unpacking, amongst other things, the TV camera. The TV camera was then powered on and a signal transmitted to the command module, which beamed the live signal back to Earth. This meant that upwards of 600 million people on Earth could watch the live feed with only a very slight delay. Similar technology was also used on subsequent Apollo missions.''

=== Environment ===
1. The astronauts could not have survived the trip because of exposure to radiation from the [[Van Allen radiation belt]] and galactic ambient radiation (see [[Acute radiation syndrome|radiation poisoning]] and [[health threat from cosmic rays]]). Some conspiracists have suggested that [[Starfish Prime]] (a [[High-altitude nuclear explosion|high-altitude nuclear test]] in 1962) was a failed attempt to disrupt the Van Allen belts.

:* ''There are two main Van Allen belts – the inner belt and the outer belt – and a transient third belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2013/28feb_thirdbelt/ |title=Van Allen Probes Discover a New Radiation Belt |work=Science@NASA |publisher=NASA |date=February 28, 2013 |editor-last=Phillips |editor-first=Tony |accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inner belt is the more dangerous one, containing energetic protons.

2. Film in the cameras would have been fogged by this radiation.

:* ''The film was kept in metal containers that stopped radiation from fogging the film's emulsion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], pp. 162–63&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, film carried by unmanned lunar probes such as the [[Lunar Orbiter program|Lunar Orbiter]] and [[Luna 3]] (which used on-board film development processes) was not fogged.''

3. The Moon's surface during the daytime is so hot that camera film would have melted.

:* ''There is no atmosphere to efficiently bind lunar surface heat to devices (such as cameras) that are not in direct contact with it. In a [[vacuum]], only radiation remains as a heat transfer mechanism. The physics of radiative heat transfer are thoroughly understood, and the proper use of passive optical coatings and paints was enough to control the temperature of the film within the cameras; Lunar Module temperatures were controlled with similar coatings that gave them a gold color. Also, while the Moon's surface does get very hot at lunar noon, every Apollo landing was made shortly after lunar sunrise at the landing site; the [[Lunar day|Moon's day]] is about 29½ Earth days long, meaning that one Moon day (dawn to dusk) lasts nearly fifteen Earth days. During the longer stays, the astronauts did notice increased cooling loads on their spacesuits as the sun and surface temperature continued to rise, but the effect was easily countered by the passive and active cooling systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], pp. 165–67&lt;/ref&gt; The film was not in direct sunlight, so it was not overheated.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clavius.org/envheat.html |title=Clavius: Environment – heat |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

4. The Apollo 16 crew could not have survived a big [[solar flare]] firing out when they were on their way to the Moon.

:* ''No large solar flare occurred during the flight of Apollo 16. There were large solar flares in August 1972, after Apollo 16 returned to Earth and before the flight of [[Apollo 17]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science1.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/27jan_solarflares/ |title=Sickening Solar Flares |last=Phillips |first=Tony |date=January 27, 2005 |work=Science@NASA |publisher=NASA |accessdate=November 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615021549/http://science1.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/27jan_solarflares/ |archivedate=June 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Predicting Solar Eruptions |first=Selby |last=Cull |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/3422566.html?page=1&amp;c=y |work=News from Sky &amp; Telescope |publisher=Sky Publishing |date=July 12, 2006 |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

5. The [[Lunar Flag Assembly|flag]] placed on the surface by the astronauts fluttered despite there being no wind on the Moon. This suggests that it was filmed on Earth and a breeze caused the flag to flutter. Sibrel said that it may have been caused by indoor fans used to cool the astronauts since their spacesuit cooling systems would have been too heavy on Earth.

:* ''The flag was fastened to a'' Г-''shaped rod (see [[Lunar Flag Assembly]]) so that it did not hang down. The flag only seemed to flutter when the astronauts were moving it into position. Without air drag, these movements caused the free corner of the flag to swing like a [[pendulum]] for some time. The flag was rippled because it had been folded during storage – the ripples could be mistaken for movement in a still photo. Videos show that when the astronauts let go of the flagpole it vibrates briefly but then remains still''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clavius.org/envflutter.html |title=Clavius: Environment: fluttering flags |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harrison|Harrison 2012]], p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#McAdams|McAdams 2011]], p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

6. Footprints in the [[Moondust]] are unexpectedly well preserved, despite the lack of moisture.

:* ''Moondust has not been weathered like Earth sand and has sharp edges. This allows the dust particles to stick together and hold their shape in the vacuum. The astronauts likened it to "talcum powder or wet sand".''&lt;ref name="whomourns" /&gt;
:* This theory was further debunked on the ''MythBusters'' episode "[[MythBusters (2008 season)#Episode 104 – "NASA Moon Landing"|NASA Moon Landing]]".

7. The alleged Moon landings used either a sound stage or were filmed outside in a remote desert with the astronauts either using harnesses or slow-motion photography to make it look like they were on the Moon.

:* ''While the [[HBO]] [[miniseries]] "[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]", and a scene from the movie "[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]" used the sound-stage and harness setup, it is clearly seen from those films that when dust rose it did not quickly settle; some dust briefly formed clouds. In the film footage from the Apollo missions, dust kicked up by the astronauts' boots and the wheels of the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]]s rose quite high due to the lower lunar gravity, and settled quickly to the ground in an uninterrupted parabolic arc since there was no air to suspend the dust. Even if there had been a sound stage for hoax Moon landings that had the air pumped out, the dust would have reached nowhere near the height and trajectory as in the Apollo film footage because of Earth's greater gravity.

:* ''During the Apollo 15 mission, [[David Scott]] did an experiment by dropping a hammer and a falcon feather at the same time. Both fell at the same rate and hit the ground at the same time. This proved that he was in a vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD |title=Hammer Versus Feather on the Moon |date=November 1, 2011 |access-date=April 20, 2013}} Source for video: {{YouTube|id=4mTsrRZEMwA|title="The Hammer and the Feather"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* ''If the landings were filmed outside in a desert, heat waves would be present on the surface in mission videos, but no such heat waves exist in the footage. If the landings were filmed in a sound stage, several anomalies would occur, including a lack of parallax, and an increase or decrease in the size of the backdrop if the camera moved (footage was filmed while the rover was in motion, and yet no evidence of any change in the size of the background is present).

:* This theory was further debunked on the ''MythBusters'' episode "[[MythBusters (2008 season)#Episode 104 – "NASA Moon Landing"|NASA Moon Landing]]".

=== Mechanical issues ===
[[File:Apollo11 under LM.jpg|right|thumb|Under the Apollo 11 Lunar Module]]

1. The Lunar Modules made no blast [[Explosion crater|craters]] or any sign of dust scatter.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002]], p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

:* ''No crater should be expected. The 10,000-pound thrust [[Descent Propulsion System]] was throttled very far down during the final landing.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harrison|Harrison 2012]], p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; The Lunar Module was no longer quickly decelerating, so the descent engine only had to support the lander's own weight, which was lessened by the Moon's gravity and by the near exhaustion of the descent propellants. At landing, the engine thrust divided by the nozzle exit area is only about 10 [[Pascal (unit)|kilopascals]] (1.5 [[Pounds per square inch|PSI]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the engine nozzle, the plume spreads, and the pressure drops very quickly. Rocket exhaust gasses expand much more quickly after leaving the engine nozzle in a vacuum than in an atmosphere. The effect of an atmosphere on rocket plumes can be easily seen in launches from Earth; as the rocket rises through the thinning atmosphere, the exhaust plumes broaden very noticeably. To lessen this, rocket engines made for vacuums have longer bells than those made for use on Earth, but they still cannot stop this spreading. The lander's exhaust gasses, therefore, expanded quickly well beyond the landing site. The descent engines &lt;u&gt;did&lt;/u&gt; scatter a lot of very fine surface dust as seen in [[16 mm film|16mm movies]] of each landing, and many mission commanders spoke of its effect on visibility. The landers were generally moving horizontally as well as vertically, and photos do show scouring of the surface along the final descent path. Finally, the lunar [[regolith]] is very compact below its surface dust layer, making it impossible for the descent engine to blast out a "crater".&lt;ref name=ba-pg163-165&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], pp. 163–65&lt;/ref&gt; A blast crater was measured under the Apollo 11 lander using shadow lengths of the descent engine bell and estimates of the amount that the landing gear had compressed and how deep the lander footpads had pressed into the lunar surface and it was found that the engine had eroded between 4 and 6 inches of regolith out from underneath the engine bell during the final descent and landing.''&lt;ref name="as11psr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/as11psr.pdf |title=Apollo 11 Preliminary Science Report |year=1969 |publisher=NASA |format=PDF |id=NASA SP-214 |accessdate=May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. The second stage of the launch rocket and/or the Lunar Module [[Apollo Lunar Module#Ascent stage|ascent stage]] made no visible flame.

:* ''The Lunar Modules used [[Aerozine 50]] (fuel) and [[dinitrogen tetroxide]] (oxidizer) propellants, chosen for simplicity and reliability; they ignite [[hypergolic propellant|hypergolically]] – upon contact – without the need for a spark. These propellants produce a nearly [[transparent materials|transparent]] exhaust.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Woods|Woods 2008]], p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; The same fuel was used by the core of the American [[Titan II GLV|Titan II]] rocket. The transparency of their plumes is apparent in many launch photos. The plumes of rocket engines fired in a vacuum spread out very quickly as they leave the engine nozzle (see above), further lessening their visibility. Finally, rocket engines often run "rich" to slow internal corrosion. On Earth, the excess fuel burns in contact with atmospheric oxygen, enhancing the visible flame. This cannot happen in a vacuum.''

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

3. The Lunar Modules weighed 17 tons and made no mark on the Moondust, yet footprints can be seen beside them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#René|René 1994]] pp. n, 11&lt;/ref&gt;

:* ''On the surface of the Earth, Apollo 11's fueled and crewed Lunar Module, Eagle, would have weighed approximately 17 [[short ton]]s (15,300&amp;nbsp;kg). On the surface of the Moon, however, after expending fuel and oxidizer on her descent from lunar orbit, the lander weighed about {{convert|2698|lb|kg|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/SP-4029.htm |title=Apollo by the Numbers: A Statistical Reference |last=Orloff |first=Richard W. |origyear=First published 2000 |date=September 2004 |website=NASA History Program Office |publisher=NASA |isbn=0-16-050631-X |id=NASA SP-2000-4029 |accessdate=May 31, 2013}} See Statistical Tables: [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_18-37_Selected_Mission_Weights.htm "Selected Mission Weights (lbs)"] and [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_18-28a_LM_Descent_Stage_Propellant_Status.htm "LM Descent Stage Propellant Status"].&lt;/ref&gt; The astronauts were much lighter than the lander, but their boots were much smaller than the lander's approximately {{convert|3|ft|cm|adj=on}} diameter footpads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/LM_Landing%20Gear1973010151.pdf |title=Apollo Lunar Module Landing Gear |last=Rogers |first=William F. |work=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |format=PDF |accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure (or force per unit area) rather than mass determines the amount of regolith compression. In some photos, the footpads &lt;u&gt;did&lt;/u&gt; press into the regolith, especially when they moved sideways at touchdown. (The bearing pressure under Apollo 11's footpads, with the lander being about 44 times the weight of an EVA-configured astronaut, would have been of similar magnitude to the bearing pressure exerted by the astronauts' boots.)''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heiken|Heiken 1991]], pp. 475–476&lt;/ref&gt;

4. The air conditioning units that were part of the astronauts' spacesuits could not have worked in an environment of no atmosphere.&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt;

:* ''The cooling units could &lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt; work in a vacuum. Water from a tank in the backpack flowed out through tiny pores in a metal [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimator]] plate where it quickly vaporized into space. The loss of the heat of vaporization froze the remaining water, forming a layer of ice on the outside of the plate that also sublimated into space (turning from a solid directly into a gas). A separate water loop flowed through the LCG ([[Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment|Liquid Cooling Garment]]) worn by the astronaut, carrying his metabolic waste heat through the sublimator plate where it was cooled and returned to the LCG. {{convert|12|lb|kg|spell=In}} of feedwater gave about eight hours of cooling; because of its bulk, it was often the limiting consumable on the length of an EVA.

[[File:Surveyor 3-Apollo 12.jpg|thumb|right|[[Surveyor 3]] with [[Apollo 12]] lander in background]]

=== Transmissions ===
1. There should have been more than a two-second delay in communications between Earth and the Moon, at a distance of {{convert|400000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

:* ''The round trip light travel time of more than two seconds is apparent in all the real-time recordings of the lunar audio, but this does not always appear as expected. There may also be some documentary films where the delay has been edited out. Reasons for editing the audio may be time constraints or in the interest of clarity.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redzero.demon.co.uk/moonhoax/Radio.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080729183941/http://www.redzero.demon.co.uk/moonhoax/Radio.htm |archivedate=July 29, 2008 |title=Radio Lag |publisher=Redzero.demon.co.uk |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Typical delays in communication were about 0.5 seconds.

:* ''Claims that the delays were only half a second are untrue, as examination of the original recordings shows. Also, there should not be a consistent time delay between every response, as the conversation is being recorded at one end – [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]]. Responses from Mission Control could be heard without any delay, as the recording is being made at the same time that Houston receives the transmission from the Moon.''

3. The [[Parkes Observatory]] in Australia was billed to the world for weeks as the site that would be relaying communications from the first moonwalk. However, five hours before transmission they were told to stand down.

:* ''The timing of the first moonwalk was changed after the landing. In fact, delays in getting the moonwalk started meant that Parkes did cover almost the entire Apollo 11 moonwalk.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/imagery/apollo/AS11/a11sum.htm |title=Apollo 11 Mission Summary |website=The Apollo Program |publisher=National Air and Space Museum |date=July 16, 1969 |accessdate=November 13, 2010 |quote=From NASA SP-214, Preliminary Science Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4. Parkes supposedly had the clearest video feed from the Moon, but Australian media and all other known sources ran a live feed from the United States.

:* ''While that was the original plan, and, according to some sources, the official policy, the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) did take the transmission direct from the Parkes and [[Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station|Honeysuckle Creek]] [[radio telescope]]s. These were converted to [[NTSC]] television at [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]], in Sydney. This meant that Australian viewers saw the moonwalk several seconds before the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honeysucklecreek.net/Apollo_11/Australian_TV.html |title=Apollo 11 TV – as seen in Australia |publisher=Honeysucklecreek.net |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also Parkes radio astronomer John Sarkissian's article, [http://www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au/news_events/apollo11/ "On Eagle's Wings: The Parkes Observatory's Support of the Apollo 11 Mission"]&lt;ref name="eagleswings2" /&gt; The events surrounding the Parkes Observatory's role in relaying the live television of the moonwalk were portrayed in a slightly fictionalized Australian film comedy "[[The Dish]]" (2000).''

5. Better signal was supposedly received at Parkes Observatory when the Moon was on the opposite side of the planet.

[[File:Apollo11C.jpg|thumb|right|Photo of the high-quality SSTV image before the scan conversion]]
[[File:Apollo11D.jpg|thumb|right|Photo of the degraded image after the SSTV scan conversion]]
Dr. David R. Williams (NASA archivist at [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]) and Apollo 11 flight director [[Gene Kranz|Eugene F. Kranz]] both acknowledged that the original high-quality Apollo 11 telemetry data tapes are missing. Conspiracists see this as evidence that they never existed.&lt;ref name="didwego" /&gt; The Apollo 11 telemetry tapes were different from the telemetry tapes of the other Moon landings because they contained the raw television broadcast. For technical reasons, the Apollo 11 lander carried a [[slow-scan television]] (SSTV) camera (see [[Apollo TV camera]]). To broadcast the pictures to regular television, a [[scan conversion]] had to be done. The [[radio telescope]] at Parkes Observatory in Australia was able to receive the telemetry from the Moon at the time of the Apollo 11 moonwalk.&lt;ref name="eagleswings2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sarkissian |first=John M. |title=On Eagle's Wings: The Parkes Observatory's Support of the Apollo 11 Mission |year=2001 |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=287–310 |location=Collingwood, Victoria |publisher=[[CSIRO Publishing]] for the [[Astronomical Society of Australia]] |doi=10.1071/AS01038 |accessdate=November 25, 2008 |url=http://www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au/news_events/apollo11/|bibcode = 2001PASA...18..287S }} October 2000 website version, part 1 of 12: "Introduction."

It also received a better picture than NASA's antenna at [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex]]. This direct TV signal, along with telemetry data, was recorded onto one-inch fourteen-track analog tape at Parkes. The original SSTV transmission had better detail and contrast than the scan-converted pictures, and it is this original tape that is missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au/news_events/apollo11/Parkes_Apollo11_TV_quality.html |title=The Parkes Apollo 11 TV Quality |last=Sarkissian |first=John M. |publisher=[[Parkes Observatory|CSIRO Parkes Observatory]] |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A crude, real-time scan conversion of the SSTV signal was done in Australia before it was broadcast worldwide. However, still photos of the original SSTV image are available (see photos). About fifteen minutes of it were filmed by an amateur [[8 mm film]] camera and these are also available. Later Apollo missions did not use SSTV. At least some of the telemetry tapes from the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package|ALSEP]] scientific experiments left on the Moon (which ran until 1977) still exist, according to Dr. Williams. Copies of those tapes have been found.&lt;ref name="Amalfi"&gt;{{cite news |title=Lost Moon landing tapes discovered |last=Amalfi |first=Carmelo |url=http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/features/lost-moon-landing-tapes-discovered/ |work=COSMOS Online |publisher=Cosmos Media Pty Ltd |location=Australia |date=November 1, 2006 |accessdate=November 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214030100/http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/features/lost-moon-landing-tapes-discovered/ |archivedate=February 14, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others are looking for the missing telemetry tapes for different reasons. The tapes contain the original and highest quality video feed from the Apollo 11 landing. Some former Apollo personnel want to find the tapes for posterity while NASA engineers looking towards future Moon missions believe the tapes may be useful for their design studies. They have found that the Apollo 11 tapes were sent for storage at the U.S. National Archives in 1970, but by 1984, all the Apollo 11 tapes had been returned to the Goddard Space Flight Center at their request. The tapes are believed to have been stored rather than re-used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.honeysucklecreek.net/Apollo_11/tapes/Search_for_SSTV_Tapes.pdf |title=The Search for the Apollo 11 SSTV Tapes |last=Sarkissian |first=John M. |date=May 21, 2006 |website=Honeysucklecreek.net |publisher=CSIRO Parkes Observatory |format=PDF |accessdate=April 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goddard was storing 35,000 new tapes per year in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19670010532_1967010532.pdf| accessdate=September 5, 2009| format=PDF| title=The GSFC Scientific Data Storage Problem| publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; even before the Moon landings.

In November 2006, [[Cosmos (magazine)|COSMOS Online]] reported that about 100 data tapes recorded in Australia during the Apollo 11 mission had been found in a small marine science laboratory in the main physics building at the [[Curtin University of Technology]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth, Australia]]. One of the old tapes has been sent to NASA for analysis. The slow-scan television images were not on the tape.&lt;ref name="Amalfi" /&gt;

In July 2009, NASA indicated that it must have erased the original Apollo 11 Moon footage years ago so that it could re-use the tape. In December 2009 NASA issued a final report on the Apollo 11 telemetry tapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/Apollo_11_TV_Tapes_Report.pdf |title=The Apollo 11 Telemetry Data Recordings: A Final Report |date=December 2009 |publisher=NASA |format=PDF |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior engineer Dick Nafzger, who was in charge of the live TV recordings during the Apollo missions, was put in charge of the restoration project. After a three-year search, the "inescapable conclusion" was that about 45 tapes (estimated 15 tapes recorded at each of the three tracking stations) of Apollo 11 video were erased and re-used, said Nafzger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usnews.com/science/articles/2009/07/17/nasa-lost-moon-footage-but-hollywood-restores-it |title=NASA lost moon footage, but Hollywood restores it |date=July 17, 2009 |first=Seth |last=Borenstein |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=[[US News &amp; World Report]] |accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In time for the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing, [[Lowry Digital]] had been tasked with restoring the surviving footage. Lowry Digital president Mike Inchalik said that, "this is by far and away the lowest quality" video the company has dealt with. Nafzger praised Lowry for restoring "crispness" to the Apollo video, which will remain in black and white and contains conservative digital enhancements. The US$230,000 restoration project took months to complete and did not include sound quality improvements. Some selections of restored footage in high-definition have been made available on the NASA website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/hd/apollo11.html |title=Apollo 11 Partial Restoration HD Video Streams |date=August 7, 2009 |editor-last=Garner |editor-first=Robert |publisher=NASA |accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology ===
{{See also|Space Race|List of space exploration milestones, 1957–1969}}

Bart Sibrel cites the relative level of the United States and USSR space technology as evidence that the Moon landings could not have happened. For much of the early stages of the Space Race, the USSR was ahead of the United States, yet in the end, the USSR was never able to fly a manned craft to the Moon, let alone land one on the surface. It is argued that, because the USSR was unable to do this, the United States should have also been unable to develop the technology to do so.

For example, he claims that, during the Apollo program, the USSR had five times more manned hours in space than the United States, and notes that the USSR was the first to achieve many of the early milestones in space: the first man-made [[satellite]] in [[orbit]] (October 1957, [[Sputnik 1]]);&lt;ref group=Note&gt;According to the 2007 ''[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]]'' episode "[[List of Nova episodes#Season 35: 2007–2008|Sputnik Declassified]]," the United States could have launched the ''[[Explorer 1]]'' probe before Sputnik, but the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration hesitated, first because they were not sure if international law meant that national borders kept going all the way into orbit (and, thus, their orbiting satellite could cause an international uproar by violating the borders of dozens of nations), and second because there was a desire to see the not yet ready [[Project Vanguard|Vanguard satellite program]], designed by American citizens, become America's first satellite rather than the Explorer program, that was mostly designed by former rocket designers from [[Nazi Germany]]. A transcript of the appropriate section from the show is available at "[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/space/sputnik-impact-on-america.html Sputnik's Impact on America]."&lt;/ref&gt; the first living creature in orbit (a [[dog]] named [[Laika]], November 1957, [[Sputnik 2]]); the first man in space and in orbit ([[Yuri Gagarin]], April 1961, [[Vostok 1]]); the first woman in space ([[Valentina Tereshkova]], June 1963, [[Vostok 6]]); and the first spacewalk (EVA) ([[Alexei Leonov]] in March 1965, [[Voskhod 2]]).

However, most of the Soviet gains listed above were matched by the United States within a year, and sometimes within weeks. In 1965, the United States started to achieve many firsts (such as the first successful [[space rendezvous]]), which were important steps in a mission to the Moon. Furthermore, NASA and others say that these gains by the Soviets are not as impressive as they seem; that a number of these firsts were mere stunts that did not advance the technology greatly, or at all, ''e.g.'', the first woman in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clavius.org/techsoviet.html |title=Clavius: Technology – beating the soviets |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/2013/06/17/women-in-space-part-one-female-firsts-in-flight-for-space-exploration-and-research/ |title=Women in Space Part One, Female Firsts in Flight for Space Exploration and Research |last=Warren |first=Liz |date=June 17, 2013 |work=A Lab Aloft |publisher=NASA Blogs |type=Blog |accessdate=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, by the time of the launch of the first manned Earth-orbiting Apollo flight ([[Apollo 7]]), the USSR had made only nine [[spaceflight]]s (seven with one cosmonaut, one with two, one with three) compared to 16 by the United States. In terms of spacecraft hours, the USSR had 460 hours of spaceflight; the United States had 1,024 hours. In terms of astronaut/cosmonaut time, the USSR had 534 hours of manned spaceflight whereas the United States had 1,992 hours. By the time of Apollo 11, the United States had a lead much wider than that. (See [[List of human spaceflights, 1961–1970]], and refer to individual flights for the length of time.)

Moreover, the USSR did not develop a successful rocket capable of a manned lunar mission until the 1980s – their [[N1 (rocket)|N1 rocket]] failed on all four launch attempts between 1969 and 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/sovnding.htm |title=Soviet Lunar Landing |work=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]] |publisher=Mark Wade |accessdate=November 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224200322/http://www.astronautix.com/flights/sovnding.htm |archivedate=February 24, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet [[LK (spacecraft)|LK]] lunar lander was tested in unmanned low-Earth-orbit flights three times in 1970 and 1971.

=== Deaths of NASA personnel ===
In a televised program about the moon-landing hoax allegations, [[Fox Entertainment Group]] listed the deaths of ten astronauts and two civilians related to the manned spaceflight program as part of an alleged cover-up.
* [[Theodore Freeman]] (killed ejecting from a [[T-38 Talon|T-38]] which had suffered a [[bird strike]], October 1964)
* [[Elliot See]] and [[Charles Bassett|Charlie Bassett]] ([[1966 NASA T-38 crash|T-38 crash in bad weather]], February 1966)
* [[Gus Grissom|Virgil "Gus" Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and [[Roger B. Chaffee]] (killed in a fire during the "plugs-out test" preceding [[Apollo 1]], January 1967)
* [[Edward Givens|Edward "Ed" Givens]] (killed in a car accident, June 1967)
* [[Clifton Williams|Clifton "C. C." Williams]] (killed ejecting from a T-38, October 1967)
* [[Michael James Adams|Michael J. "Mike" Adams]] (died in an [[North American X-15|X-15]] crash, November 1967. Adams was the only pilot killed during the X-15 flight test program. He was a test pilot, not a NASA astronaut, but had flown the X-15 above 50 miles.)
* [[Robert Henry Lawrence, Jr.]] (killed in an [[F-104 Starfighter|F-104]] crash, December 1967, shortly after being selected as a pilot with the [[United States Air Force]]'s (later cancelled) [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] (MOL) program.)
* [[Thomas Baron|Thomas Ronald Baron]] ([[North American Aviation]] employee. Baron died in an automobile collision with a train, April 27, 1967, six days after testifying before [[United States House of Representatives|Rep.]] [[Olin E. Teague]]'s House Subcommittee on NASA Oversight hearings held following the Apollo 1 fire, after which he was fired). Baron was a quality control inspector who wrote a report critical of the Apollo program and was an outspoken critic of NASA's safety record after the Apollo 1 fire. Baron and his family were killed as their car was struck by a train at a train crossing. The deaths were an accident.&lt;ref name="not_faked"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pirlwww.lpl.arizona.edu/~jscotti/NOT_faked/FOX.html |title=Comments on the FOX special on the Hoax |first=Jim | last=Scotti |website=Lunar and Planetary Laboratory |publisher=University of Arizona |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/Apollo204/barron.html |title=NASA Apollo Mission Apollo-1 – Baron Report |website=NASA History Program Office |publisher=NASA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921155820/https://history.nasa.gov/Apollo204/barron.html |archivedate=September 21, 2008 |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Brian D. Welch, a leading official in NASA's Public Affairs Office and Director of Media Services (Welch died a few months after appearing in the media to debunk the pro-hoax television show cited above.&lt;ref name="Fake Moon Flight' Myth 2003, pp. 23, 30"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oberg |first=James |authorlink=James Oberg |date=March–April 2003 |title=Lessons of the 'Fake Moon Flight' Myth |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] |pages=23, 30 |accessdate=April 27, 2013 |url=http://www.jamesoberg.com/042003lessonsfake_his.html}} Reprinted in [[Kendrick Frazier|Frazier, Kendrick]] (ed.)

Two of the above, X-15 pilot Mike Adams and MOL pilot Robert Lawrence, had no connection with the civilian manned space program that oversaw the Apollo missions. All of the deaths listed besides Welch occurred at least 20 months ''before'' Apollo 11 and subsequent flights.

As of November 2018, four of the twelve [[List of Apollo Astronauts#Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon|Apollo astronauts who landed on the Moon]] between 1969 and 1972 are still alive, including Buzz Aldrin. Also, nine of the twelve [[List of Apollo Astronauts#Apollo astronauts who flew to the Moon without landing|Apollo astronauts who flew to the Moon without landing]] between 1968 and 1972 are still alive, including [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]].

The number of deaths within the American astronaut corps during the run-up to Apollo and during the Apollo missions is similar to the number of deaths incurred by the Russians. During the period 1961 to 1972, at least eight Russian serving and former cosmonauts died:
* [[Valentin Bondarenko]] (ground training accident, March 1961)
* [[Grigori Nelyubov]] (suicide, February 1966)
* [[Vladimir Komarov]] (''[[Soyuz 1]]'' accident, April 1967)
* [[Yuri Gagarin]] ([[MiG-15]] crash, March 1968)
* [[Pavel Belyayev]] (complications following surgery, January 1970)
* [[Georgi Dobrovolski]], [[Vladislav Volkov]], and [[Viktor Patsayev]] (''[[Soyuz 11]]'' accident, June 1971)

Additionally, the overall chief of their manned-spaceflight program, [[Sergei Korolev]], died while undergoing surgery in January 1966.

=== NASA response ===
In June 1977, NASA issued a fact sheet responding to recent claims that the Apollo Moon landings had been hoaxed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/pao/media/2001/lunar_landing.pdf |title=Did U.S. Astronauts Really Land on the Moon |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=February 14, 2001 |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |type=Reissue (June 1977) |format=PDF |accessdate=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact sheet is particularly blunt and regards the idea of faking the Moon landings to be preposterous and outlandish. NASA refers to the rocks and particles collected from the Moon as being evidence of the program's legitimacy, as they claim that these rocks could not have been formed under conditions on earth. NASA also notes that all of the operations and phases of the Apollo program were closely followed and under the scrutiny of the news media, from liftoff to splashdown. NASA responds to Bill Kaysing's book, ''We Never Went to the Moon'', by identifying one of his claims of fraud regarding the lack of a crater left on the Moon's surface by the landing of the lunar module, and refuting it with facts about the soil and cohesive nature of the surface of the Moon.

The fact sheet was reissued on February 14, 2001, the day before Fox television's broadcast of ''Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?'' The documentary reinvigorated the public's interest in conspiracy theories and the possibility that the Moon landings were faked, which has provoked NASA to once again defend its name.

=== Alleged Stanley Kubrick involvement ===

Filmmaker [[Stanley Kubrick]] is accused of having produced much of the footage for Apollos 11 and 12, presumably because he had just directed ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', which is partly set on the Moon and featured advanced special effects.&lt;ref name="clydelewis" /&gt; It has been claimed that when ''2001'' was in [[post-production]] in early 1968, NASA secretly approached Kubrick to direct the first three Moon landings. The launch and splashdown would be real but the spacecraft would stay in Earth orbit and fake footage broadcast as "live from the Moon." No evidence was offered for this theory, which overlooks many facts. For example, ''2001'' was released before the first Apollo landing and Kubrick's depiction of the Moon's surface differs greatly from its appearance in Apollo video, film, and photography. Movements of astronauts in ''2001'' differs from that of the Apollo astronauts, and does not resemble an environment with 1/6 the gravity of Earth. Several scenes of ''2001'' show billowing of dust as spacecraft landed, something that would not happen in the vacuum environment of the Moon. Kubrick did hire [[Frederick I. Ordway III|Frederick Ordway]] and [[Harry Lange (film designer)|Harry Lange]], both of whom had worked for NASA and major aerospace contractors, to work with him on ''2001''. Kubrick also used some 50&amp;nbsp;mm f/0.7 lenses that were left over from a batch made by [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] for NASA. However, Kubrick only got this lens for ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' (1975). The lens was originally a still photo lens and needed changes to be used for motion filming.

The [[mockumentary]] based on this idea, ''[[Dark Side of the Moon (documentary)|Dark Side of the Moon]]'', could have fueled the conspiracy theory. This French mockumentary, directed by William Karel, was originally aired on Arte channel in 2002 with the title ''Opération Lune''. It parodies conspiracy theories with faked interviews, stories of assassinations of Stanley Kubrick's assistants by the CIA, and a variety of conspicuous mistakes, puns, and references to old movie characters, inserted through the film as clues for the viewer. Nevertheless, ''Opération Lune'' is still taken at face value by some conspiracy believers.

An article entitled "Stanley Kubrick and the Moon Hoax" appeared on Usenet in 1995, in the newsgroup "alt.humor.best-of-usenet". One passage – on how Kubrick was supposedly coerced into the conspiracy – reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;NASA further leveraged their position by threatening to publicly reveal the heavy involvement of Mr. Kubrick's younger brother, Raul, with the [[American Communist Party]]. This would have been an intolerable embarrassment to Mr. Kubrick, especially since the release of ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kubrick had no such brother – the article was a spoof, complete with a giveaway sentence describing Kubrick shooting the moonwalk "on location" on the Moon. Nevertheless, the claim was taken up in earnest;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clavius.org/bibkubrick.html |title=Clavius: Bibliography – the kubrick article |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clyde Lewis used it almost word-for-word,&lt;ref name="clydelewis" /&gt; whereas [[Room 237|Jay Weidner]] gave the brother a more senior status within the party:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No one knows how the powers-that-be convinced Kubrick to direct the Apollo landings. Maybe they had compromised Kubrick in some way. The fact that his brother, Raul Kubrick, was the head of the American Communist Party may have been one of the avenues pursued by the government to get Stanley to cooperate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Weidner |first=Jay |url=http://jayweidner.com/AlchemicalKubrickIIa.html |title=How Stanley Kubrick Faked the Apollo Moon Landings |work=jayweidner.com |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=June 24, 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123205838/http://jayweidner.com/AlchemicalKubrickIIa.html |archivedate=November 23, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In July 2009, Weidner posted on his webpage "Secrets of the Shining", where he states that Kubrick's ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980) is a veiled confession of his role in the scam project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/luna/luna_apollomissions10.htm |title=Secrets of the Shining |last=Weidner |first=Jay |website=Bibliotecapleyades.net |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=June 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|7hRgQ-Qk7u8|Faked Moon Landing Hidden Subliminal Messages in Stanley Kubrick's Movie 'The Shining'}}. Retrieved June 24, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This thesis was subject of refutation in an article published on [[Seeker (media company)|Seeker]] nearly half a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.seeker.com/faked-moon-landings-and-kubricks-the-shining-1765004443.html |title=Faked Moon Landings and Kubrick's 'The Shining' |last=Lamb |first=Robert |publisher=[[Seeker (media company)|Seeker]] |date=January 21, 2010 |accessdate=June 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 movie ''[[Moonwalkers (film)|Moonwalkers]]'' is a fictional account of a CIA agent's claim of Kubrick's involvement.

In December 2015, a video surfaced which allegedly shows Kubrick being interviewed shortly before his 1999 death; the video purportedly shows the director confessing to T. Patrick Murray that the Apollo Moon landings had been faked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/science/626119/MOON-LANDINGS-FAKE-Shock-video-Stanley-Kubrick-admit-historic-event-HOAX-NASA |title=Moon Landings 'Fake': Shock video shows 'Stanley Kubrick' admit historic event was 'HOAX' |last=Austin |first=Jon |publisher=''[[Daily Express]]'' |date=December 11, 2015 |accessdate=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research quickly found, however, that the video was a [[hoax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/false-stanley-kubrick-faked-moon-landings/ |title=Lie Me to the Moon |last=Evon |first=Dan |publisher=[[Snopes.com]] |date=December 11, 2015 |accessdate=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, NASA granted US$15,000 to James Oberg for a commission to write a point-by-point rebuttal of the hoax claims. However, NASA canceled the commission later that year, after complaints that the book would dignify the accusations.&lt;ref name="Fake Moon Flight' Myth 2003, pp. 23, 30" /&gt; Oberg said that he meant to finish the book.&lt;ref name="Fake Moon Flight' Myth 2003, pp. 23, 30" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2424927.stm| accessdate=August 26, 2009| title=Nasa pulls Moon hoax book| date=November 8, 2002| first=David| last=Whitehouse|work=BBC News | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2002, [[Peter Jennings]] said "NASA is going to spend a few thousand dollars trying to prove to some people that the United States did indeed land men on the Moon," and "NASA had been so rattled, [they] hired [somebody] to write a book refuting the conspiracy theorists." Oberg says that belief in the hoax theories is not the fault of the conspiracists, but rather that of teachers and people (including NASA) who should provide information to the public.&lt;ref name="Fake Moon Flight' Myth 2003, pp. 23, 30" /&gt;

=== ''MythBusters'' special ===
{{Main|MythBusters (2008 season)#Episode 104 – "NASA Moon Landing"|l1=Mythbusters "NASA Moon Landing" episode}}

An episode of ''[[MythBusters]]'' in August 2008 was dedicated to the Moon landings. The ''MythBusters'' crew tested many of the conspiracists' claims. Some of the testings were done in a NASA training facility. All of the conspiracists' claims examined on the show were labeled as having been "Busted", meaning that the conspiracists' claims were not true.

Moon-landing conspiracists claim that observatories and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] should be able to photograph the landing sites. This implies that the world's major observatories (as well as the Hubble Program) are complicit in the hoax by refusing to take photos of the landing sites. Photos of the Moon have been taken by Hubble, including at least two Apollo landing sites, but the Hubble resolution limits viewing of lunar objects to sizes no smaller than {{convert|60|–|75|yds|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}, which is insufficient resolution to see any landing site features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/hubble_moon.html |title=Hubble Shoots The Moon |editor-last=Stoyanova |editor-first=Silvia |date=September 10, 2007 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=October 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Space Agency]]'s [[SMART-1]] unmanned probe sent back photos of the landing sites, according to [[Bernard Foing]], Chief Scientist of the ESA Science Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/847-conspiracy-theories-spacecraft-snoops-apollo-moon-sites.html |title=End of Conspiracy Theories?

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' published a story in 2002 saying that European astronomers at the [[Very Large Telescope]] (VLT) would use it to view the landing sites. According to the article, Dr. [[Richard Martin West|Richard West]] said that his team would take "a high-resolution image of one of the Apollo landing sites." Marcus Allen, a conspiracist, answered that no photos of hardware on the Moon would convince him that manned landings had happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1414144/Worlds-biggest-telescope-to-prove-Americans-really-walked-on-Moon.html |accessdate=August 26, 2009| title=World's biggest telescope to prove Americans really walked on Moon| date=November 24, 2002| first=Robert| last=Matthews| newspaper=The Daily Telegraph | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the VLT is capable of resolving equivalent to the distance between the headlights of a car as seen from the Moon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Stee |first=Philippe |title=To Be or Not to Be: Is It All About Spinning? |date=September 20, 2006 |publisher=[[European Southern Observatory]] |location=Garching, Germany |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0635/ |accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; it may be able to photograph some features of the landing sites.

{{Main|Moon rocks}}
[[File:Apollo 15 Genesis Rock.jpg|right|thumb|[[Genesis Rock]] brought back by Apollo 15 – older than any rocks on Earth]]
The Apollo program collected {{convert|838|lb|kg|order=flip}} of [[Moon rock]]s during the six manned missions. Analyses by scientists worldwide all agree that these rocks came from the Moon – no published accounts in [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]]s exist that dispute this claim. The Apollo samples are easily distinguishable from both [[meteorite]]s and Earth rocks&lt;ref name="greatmoonhoax" /&gt; in that they show a lack of [[mineral hydration|hydrous alteration]] products, they show evidence of having undergone impact events on an airless body, and they have unique geochemical traits. Furthermore, most are more than 200 million years older than the oldest Earth rocks. The Moon rocks also share the same traits as Soviet samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Papike |first1=James J. |last2=Ryder |first2=Graham |last3=Shearer |first3=Charles K. |date=January 1998 |title=Lunar Samples |journal=[[Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry]] |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=5.1–5.234 |publisher=[[Mineralogical Society of America]]|location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-0-939950-46-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conspiracists argue that [[Marshall Space Flight Center#Directors|Marshall Space Flight Center Director]] [[Wernher von Braun]]'s trip to [[Antarctica]] in 1967 (about two years before the Apollo 11 launch) was to gather [[lunar meteorite]]s to be used as fake Moon rocks. Because von Braun was a former [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officer (though one who had been detained by the [[Gestapo]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.reformation.org/wernher-von-braun.html | title = Wernher von Braun in SS uniform |work=The Reformation Online |publisher=Bible Believers Press}} Source cited: [[Walter Dornberger|Dornberger, Walter]] ''V-2'' (1958) New York: Viking Press [OCLC 255209058].&lt;/ref&gt; the documentary film ''Did We Go?''&lt;ref name="didwego" /&gt; suggests that he could have been pressured to agree to the conspiracy to protect himself from recriminations over his past. NASA said that von Braun's mission was "to look into environmental and logistic factors that might relate to the planning of future space missions, and hardware."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/yy/y1967.html | title = Marshall Highlights for 1967 | publisher =[[Marshall Space Flight Center]] History Office}} Originally "published in a news release issued in late 1967 by the Marshall Center Public Affairs Office."&lt;/ref&gt; NASA continues to send teams to work in Antarctica to mimic the conditions on other planets.

It is now accepted by the scientific community that rocks have been blasted from both the [[Mars|Martian]] and lunar surface during [[impact crater|impact events]], and that some of these have landed on the Earth as meteorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Head |first1=James N. |last2=Melosh |first2=H.

On the makeup of the Moon rocks, Kaysing asked: "Why was there never a mention of gold, silver, diamonds or other precious metals on the moon? Wasn't this a viable consideration? Why was this fact never dicussed [''sic''] in the press or by the astronauts?"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002]], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Geologists realize that gold and silver deposits on Earth are the result of the action of hydrothermal fluids concentrating the precious metals into veins of ore. Since in 1969 water was believed to be absent on the Moon, no geologist would bother discussing the possibility of finding these on the Moon in any great amount.

{{Main|Third-party evidence for Apollo Moon landings#Apollo missions tracked by independent parties|l1=Apollo missions tracked by independent parties}}
Aside from NASA, a number of groups and individuals tracked the Apollo missions as they happened. On later missions, NASA released information to the public explaining where and when the spacecraft could be sighted. Their flight paths were tracked using radar and they were sighted and photographed using telescopes. Also, radio transmissions between the astronauts on the surface and in orbit were independently recorded.

There are subcultures worldwide which advocate the belief that the Moon landings were faked. By 1977 the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] magazine ''[[Back to Godhead]]'' called the landings a hoax, claiming that, since the [[Sun]] is 93,000,000 miles away, and "according to [[Hindu mythology]] the Moon is 800,000 miles farther away than that", the Moon would be nearly 94,000,000 miles away; to travel that span in 91 hours would require a speed of more than a million miles per hour, "a patently impossible feat even by the scientists' calculations."&lt;ref name="Goswami"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Satsvarūpa dāsa Goswami |authorlink=Satsvarupa dasa Goswami |date=May 1977 |title=Man on the Moon: A Case of Mass Brainwashing |url=http://back2godhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/123_1977_12-05.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[Back to Godhead]] |location=Los Angeles |publisher=[[Bhaktivedanta Book Trust]] |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=10–11, 13–14 |issn=0005-3643 |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scheaffer|Scheaffer 2011]], p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NL-Alert''' is a [[Cell Broadcast]] [[Alarm device|alarm system]] in use by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government to quickly alert and inform citizens of hazardous or crisis situations. Using this system, authorities can send messages to users of [[Mobile phone|mobile phones]] in specific areas by using specific [[cell towers]] to alert phones within their reach.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.government.nl/documents/leaflets/2017/06/23/nl-alert-factsheet&lt;/ref&gt;

The system was introduced nationally on 8 November 2012&lt;ref&gt;https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2012/11/08/nationwide-launch-of-emergency-alert-system-nl-alert Retrieved 8 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightreading.com/kpn-does-cell-broadcast-with-acision/d/d-id/689928|title=KPN selects one2many for NL-Alert|work=Light Reading|accessdate=2011-09-15}} &lt;/ref&gt;, and was first used in a large fire in [[Leek, Netherlands|Tolbert]] on 14 December 2012. The second use was in another fire in [[Meppel]] in 2013. NL-Alert has been used more than 200 times until December 2017 for public warning purposes (e.g. large forest &amp; industrial fires, severe weather conditions and gas leakages).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.k-lmo.nl/nieuws/2017/december/nl-alert-sinds-introductie-200-keer-ingezet.html&lt;/ref&gt;

NL-Alert is an addition to the existing [[emergency population warning]] system, which works using a large amount of sirens on masts throughout the country. A key difference between these systems is that users of NL-Alert are not only warned, but also immediately informed about the situation. NL-Alert messages include the location of an incident and advice on bringing oneself to safety. NL-Alert messages have a distinct alarm sound - which only stops when the message is seen by the user. The national network of 4,200 civil sirens, with a yearly maintenace costs of 4 M€, will be switched off and dismantled as from 1 January 2020. As from 2020 the government wants to inform citizens of disasters or emergencies only via their mobile phones, using Cell broadcast message based NL-Alert and internet based social media and the crisis.nl website. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2016/11/monthly-monday-air-raid-tests-to-fall-silent-from-2020/&lt;/ref&gt;

Receiving NL-Alert is free. A user does not have to register to receive alerts, but may need to configure a device to receive cell broadcasts. Increasingly, mobile phones are pre-configured by their manufacturers to receive cell broadcasts, including NL-Alert, via [[2G]], [[3G]] and [[4G]] systems. [[File:Cell Broadcast on Android 7.1.png|thumb|NL-Alert Cell Broadcast configuration menu on Android 7.1]]

== Adoption Rate ==
NL-Alert has been used in the Netherlands for several years, and every six months a test message is sent which is broadcast throughout the Netherlands. The reach of the Control Cell Broadcast message has increased over the years resulting that in June 2018 10M citizens received the test warning Cell Broadcast message on their mobile phone and reaching with this message 11.3M people - 76% of the Dutch population of 12 years and older.

[[Image:Exercise Desert Rock I (Buster-Jangle Dog) 002.jpg|right|thumb|250px|November 1951 nuclear test at Nevada Test Site]]
'''The Nevada Desert Experience''' is a name for the movement to stop U.S. [[nuclear weapons testing]] that came into use in the middle 1980s. It is also the name of an [[anti-nuclear]] organization which continues to create public events to question the morality and intelligence of the U.S. [[nuclear weapon]]s program, with a main focus on the [[United States Department of Energy]]'s (DOE) [[Nevada Test Site]] (now renamed the Nevada National Security Site).

==History==
In the spring of 1982 activists working for social justice, environmental preservation, and international peace organized a six-week peace vigil at the entrance to the Nevada Test Site, about 60 miles (100&amp;nbsp;km) from [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. In 1983 they repeated the vigil, calling it the 'Lenten Desert Experience'.&lt;ref name=nde-hist&gt;http://www.nevadadesertexperience.org/history/history.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This anarchist group of Christian organizers decided that the program had been successful enough to start an organization, which led to a faith-based aspect to the nuclear abolition movement. They named it 'Nevada Desert Experience' or NDE because of the work within the prayer-actions for peace that included learning to appreciate the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]] and the [[Great Basin]] Deserts of North America. Organizers believed that appreciation of the beauty and power of the natural environment, coupled with a universal code of ethics (the [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]]) organically leads humans to make a stand for peace and environmental justice.

==Aims==
The movement's immediate goal of ending nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site was met in 1992, when President [[George H. W. Bush]] signed a moratorium on underground nuclear weapons tests.&lt;ref name=armscontrol-ctbt&gt;{{cite web |author= |title=The Status of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty: Signatories and Ratifiers |url=https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/ctbtsig |date=March 2014 |publisher=Arms Control Association |accessdate=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abolition movement, led by NDE and the [[Western Shoshone]]-based [[Anti-nuclear movement in the United States#Shundahai Network|Shundahai Network]] were sparked back into action with the renewal of non-nuclear explosions at the Nevada Test Site in 1997. These "[[Subcritical testing#Alternatives to full-scale testing|subcritical]]" bombs use fissile materials which do not reach the self-sustaining [[nuclear chain reaction|chain reaction]] of a typical nuclear bomb. The bombs are designed by [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] and [[Lawrence Livermore Laboratory]], whereby the data collected can be fed to computers to simulate full-scale nuclear explosions for the US [[National Security Agency]] (NSA){{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} and DOE. Their explosive yield is low, and small amounts of radiation may be released. Because each sub-critical experiment costs roughly {{usd|20 million}} and much time from the humans working within the nuclear weapons management industry, the tests indicate to nuclear abolition activists a strong continued interest (within the U.S. Government) in favor of nuclear weapons. Therefore, the NDE continues to work for deep ecological sensitivities and social peacemaking, with one goal being to clean up and contain the contamination created by 55 years of nuclear testing in Nevada and Western Shoshone country.

==Protests==
From 1986 through 1994, two years after the United States put a hold on full-scale [[nuclear weapons testing]], 536 demonstrations were held at the [[Nevada Test Site]] involving 37,488 participants and 15,740 arrests, according to government records.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elynews.com/articles/2007/07/18/news/news04.txt Western Shoshone spiritual leader dies]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} July 18, 2007. Elynews.com&lt;/ref&gt;   In the fall of 1986, the Peace Caucus of the American Public Health Association (APHA) organized a protest at the site with over 500 APHA members participating.  Over 100 APHA members, along with [[Carl Sagan]], [[Victor R. Sidel]] and [[H. Jack Geiger]], were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sfbaypsr.org/war-and-public-health-centralizing-the-issue-at-apha/|title=War and Public Health: Centralizing the Issue at APHA {{!}} SF Bay PSR|website=sfbaypsr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January, 1987, the actor [[Martin Sheen]] and 71 other anti-nuclear protesters were arrested at the Nevada Test Site in a demonstration marking the 36th anniversary of the first nuclear test there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DF1E3AF93BA15752C0A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon= Actor and Other Protesters Arrested at Nuclear Test Site]&lt;/ref&gt;
On February 5, 1987, more than 400 people were arrested, when they tried to enter the nation's nuclear proving grounds after nearly 2,000 demonstrators held a rally to protest nuclear weapons testing. Those arrested included the astronomer [[Carl Sagan]], privacy advocate [[Phil Zimmermann]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.techrepublic.com/article/defending-the-last-missing-pixels-phil-zimmermann/|title = Defending the last missing pixels: Phil Zimmermann speaks out on encryption, privacy, and avoiding a surveillance state|last = Ranger|first = Steve|date = June 23, 2015|work = TechRepublic|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the actors [[Kris Kristofferson]], Martin Sheen, and [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]]. Five Democratic members of Congress attended the rally: [[Thomas J. Downey]], [[Mike Lowry]], [[Jim Bates (politician)|Jim Bates]], [[Leon E.

'''Oscar Soria''' (born 1974) is an Argentinian political activist, social journalist, and environmental and human rights campaigner, currently serving as senior campaigner in the international activist group [[Avaaz]]. Previously he was the global brand director of [[Greenpeace]] and afterwards the media director of [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]].

Soria was also part of the directorate of the British section of [[Oxfam]] and confidant and close adviser of progressive politicians, social advocates and [[NGO]] leaders in Latin America and Asia.

==Early and personal life==
Born in [[Santiago del Estero]] in a traditional political family and raised in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], he went back to his province in 1984 with his family, during the beginning of the democratic transition in the aftermath of the [[National Reorganization Process]]. He led many efforts to promote transitional justice, in particular over forced disappearances and the stolen children during the dictatorship in the country.

Soria started his journalism career in the newspaper [[El Liberal (Argentine newspaper)|El Liberal]] when he was 14, becoming the youngest journalist in the Argentine media, leading high-profile investigative reports on social, environmental and human rights issues. He was known for shifting the rules of covering [[political campaigns]], by refusing visibility to rallies or [[negative campaigning]] and organising instead local debates, community forums, off-line civic and open-source journalism formats, focusing the discussions in party platforms rather than candidates.

==Activism==

===Grassroots organizing===
Since the age of 16, he was involved in neighborhood organizing, youth work in his community, and mass mobilizations against [[land grabbing]].

In 1993 he founded the human rights and environmental justice movement [[Salus Terrae]], which brought youth activists from rural areas and poor neighborhoods with university students and youth groups of the Catholic church. With this group, they campaigned for lands rights and water access, and successfully stopped deforestation and agribusiness plans, nuclear repositories and mass [[river engineering]] projects. The group were known by their high-profile exposes, denouncing illegal toxic waste&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.funam.org.ar/santiago.htm Confirmado: al mes de julio de 1999 Santiago del Estero sigue teniendo el depósito de residuos más peligroso de Argentina | FUNAM]. http://www.funam.org.ar (1999-07-01).

Retrieved on 2012-01-05.&lt;/ref&gt; During his campaign against the channelization project called "Canal Federal", there were notorious public clashes between Soria and then the governor of Santiago del Estero, [[Carlos Juárez]], the national environmental secretary [[María Julia Alsogaray]] and the president of Argentina, [[Carlos Menem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/113887-una-obra-amenaza-a-mar-chiquita Una obra amenaza a Mar Chiquita | La Nacion]. http://www.lanacion.com.ar (1998-10-12). Retrieved on 2012-01-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental causes===
In 1999 Soria was appointed in [[Greenpeace]], where his early adoption of mobile phones led into landmark victories in forest protection and indigenous rights in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://160characters.org/news/greenpeace-uses-sms-to-monitors-forest-destruction/ Greenpeace uses SMS to monitors forest destruction | 160Characters]. http://160characters.org (2005-11-7).

Retrieved on 2012-01-05.&lt;/ref&gt; He also designed a successful campaign towards the reduction of [[waste]] by encouraging individuals to participate in mobile campaigning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techpresident.com/content/sms-creates-zero-waste-buenos-aires SMS Creates Zero Waste in Buenos Aires | TechPresident]. https://techpresident.com (2005-12-12). Retrieved on 2012-06-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soria later designed high-profile campaigns on [[GMOs]], [[deforestation]], [[pollution]] and [[climate change]], leading mass global pressure against companies such as [[Nestlé]], [[Tata Group]], [[Volkswagen]], [[Mattel]] or [[McDonald's]], using [[subvertising]], [[internet activism]], [[mobile campaign]]s and other creative confrontational tactics in United States, United Kingdom, Japan, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Turkey and in the Netherlands. A political TV show called him "the man who shakes companies" &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GeEm_ecLkg El hombre de Greenpeace que hace temblar a las empresas | La Hora de Maquiavelo]. https://www.youtube.com/user/lahorademaquiavelo (2010-12-20). Retrieved on 2012-01-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also advised indigenous movements and communities opposed to mining, paper mills and agribusiness in Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.

In February 2012 Soria left Greenpeace International to join the global group [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] in its world's headquarters in [[Switzerland]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://wwf.panda.org/who_we_are/organization/directors/ WWF International Directors | WWF]. http://www.panda.org (2012-03-01). Retrieved on 2013-01-05.&lt;/ref&gt; where he led social media campaigns against illegal wildlife trade and climate change.

===Human rights and humanitarian issues===
After two years in WWF International, Soria left the organisation and joined the advocacy operations of [[Avaaz]] in the United States to work on a broader agenda.

Representing Avaaz, Soria has pushed for reaching an agreement on a [[Global Compact on Migration]] and in a [[UNESCO]] conference he made a plea to religious and civil society leaders to keep political pressure on world leaders: "There’s a painful exodus happening, where millions of the poorest of the poor are displaced by wars and environmental crises. They lost everything. An immense diaspora is seeking hope and a better future, and in that ordeal they often meet stigmatization, rejection, humiliation, slavery and even the very death they sought to escape. During my adult life, I have met many refugees and displaced people. In spite of their grief and desolation, behind their loss of hope, there’s a spirit of determination and overcoming. Despite their despair, many haven’t given up and they have dreams. And if they haven’t given up, how on Earth do we have the right to give up?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-joussour.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Seminario-Int-PRE-COP22-CIPDH.pdf|title=El clamor de los pobres y de la tierra: nuestra peregrinación|trans-title=The Cry of the Poor and the Earth: Our pilgrimage|language=Spanish|first=Oscar|last=Soria|date=7 September 2016|accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soria has also advocated for a stronger Catholic leadership on refugees, praising the decision of [[Pope Francis]] to wash the feet of the refugees during Easter in 2016, while calling for a political solution to the migrant crisis in Europe. He said Pope's gesture was "a very important message to world leaders."&lt;ref name=VR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2016/03/24/popes_gesture_to_refugees_seen_as_vital_sign_of_welcome/1217931|title=Pope's gesture to refugees seen as vital sign of welcome|work=[[Vatican Radio]]|first=Philippa|last= Hitchen|date=24 March 2016|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few days later, in an opinion piece in [[La Nación]], Soria called on Argentina's president [[Mauricio Macri]] to take more leadership on refugee policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1884221-refugiados-momento-de-liderazgo-argentino|title=Refugiados: momento de liderazgo argentino|trans-title=Refugees: time for an Argentine leadership|language=Spanish|first=Oscar|last=Soria|date=30 March 2016|accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, in an interview with [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]], Soria criticized the tactics of the right wing group [[Identitarian movement|Defend Europe]] against refugees in the Mediterranean Sea.  The C-Star, a vessel of rented by the identitarian group, originally planned to land at Catania's harbor and prevent NGO ships from assisting migrants in danger, but the operation was aborted after citizens, unions, migrant workers, faith groups and Avaaz activists blocked the port. Soria later said, "Our lawyers, who had examined the legal position, wanted authorities to know that they not only had the power to close the port, but should do so in order to prevent the C-Star from frustrating efforts to rescue refugees at risk at sea."&lt;ref name=Vice&gt;{{cite web|url=https://impact.vice.com/en_us/article/vbbvdx/locals-face-off-against-extremist-anti-refugee-ship-in-the-mediterranean|title=Locals Face Off Against Extremist Anti-Refugee Ship in the Mediterranean|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|first=Alice|last=Rowsome|date=16 August 2017|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Soria has written dozens of articles about activism and progressive causes, mainly in Spanish. He appears regularly or contributes to [[CNN En Español]], [[New York Times]], [[Vatican Radio]], [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]], [[La Nación]], [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]] and [[Página/12]].

==Awards and recognition==
Soria was mostly awarded for his investigative work on human rights and environmental issues.

&lt;!-- Since it's a temptation to edit war and there's no such thing as a 'generic' passport, current consensus reached on this article's discussion page is not to have any pictures of passports at all in the first (lead/lede) section. 31 January 2016 --&gt;
A '''passport''' is a [[travel document]], usually issued by a [[country]]'s [[government]], that certifies the identity and [[nationality]] of its holder primarily for the purpose of international travel.&lt;ref name=lawcompanion&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199290543.001.0001/acref-9780199290543-e-1616 | title=The New Oxford Companion to Law | publisher=Oxford University Press |author1=Cane, P  |author2=Conaghan, J  |lastauthoramp=yes | authorlink=Passport | year=2008 | location=London | isbn=9780199290543}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standard passports may contain information such as the holder's name, place and date of birth, photograph, signature, and other identifying information. Many countries are moving towards including biometric information in a [[microchip]] embedded in the passport, making them [[Machine-readable medium|machine-readable]] and difficult to [[counterfeit]].&lt;ref name=lawcompanion/&gt; {{As of|2017}}, there are over 120 jurisdictions issuing these [[Biometric passport|e-Passport]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gemalto.com/govt/travel/electronic-passport-trends The electronic passport in 2017 and beyond]&lt;/ref&gt; Previously issued passports usually remain valid until each expires.

A passport holder is normally entitled to enter the country that issued the passport, though some people entitled to a passport may not be full citizens with [[right of abode]]. A passport does not of itself create any rights in the country being visited or obligate the issue country in any way, such as providing [[consular assistance]]. Some passports attest to status as a [[diplomat]] or other official, entitled to rights and privileges such as [[Diplomatic immunity|immunity from arrest or prosecution]].&lt;ref name="lawcompanion" /&gt;

Many countries normally allow entry to holders of passports of other countries, sometimes requiring a [[Visa (document)|visa]] also to be obtained, but this is not an automatic right. Many other additional conditions, such as not being likely to become a public charge for financial or other reasons, and the holder not having been [[Criminal conviction|convicted of a crime]], may apply.&lt;ref name=usdhs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/iframe/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-2006.html|title=ilink – USCIS|work=uscis.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where a country does not [[Diplomatic recognition|recognise]] another, or is in dispute with it, it may prohibit the use of their passport for travel to that other country, or may [[#Limitations on use|prohibit entry]] to holders of that other country's passports, and sometimes to others who have, for example, visited the other country.

Some countries and international organisations issue [[travel document]]s which are not standard passports, but enable the holder to travel internationally to countries that recognise the documents. For example, [[Statelessness|stateless]] persons are not normally issued a national passport, but may be able to obtain a [[refugee travel document]] or the earlier "[[Nansen passport]]" which enables them to travel to countries which recognise the document, and sometimes to return to the issuing country.

Passports are often requested in other circumstances to confirm identification such as checking in to a hotel or when changing money to a local currency.

==History==
[[File:First Japanese passport 1866.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|First [[Japanese passport]], issued in 1866.]]
[[File:QingPassport.jpg|thumb|Chinese passport from the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Dynasty]], 24th Year of the Guangxu Reign - 1898.]]
[[File:Ottoman-russian-empire-passport.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|An [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] passport (passavant) issued to [[Russian Empire|Russian]] subject dated July 24, 1900.]]

One of the earliest known references to paperwork that served in a role similar to that of a passport is found in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. {{bibleverse||Nehemiah|2:7–9|NIV}}, dating from approximately 450&amp;nbsp;BC, states that Nehemiah, an official serving King [[Artaxerxes I of Persia]], asked permission to travel to [[Judea]]; the king granted leave and gave him a letter "to the governors beyond the river" requesting safe passage for him as he traveled through their lands.

Passports were an important part of the Chinese bureaucracy as early as the [[Western Han]], if not in the [[Qin dynasty|Qin Dynasty]]. They required such details as age, height, and bodily features.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/428776512|title=China's early empires : a re-appraisal|last=|first=|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Nylan, Michael., Loewe, Michael.|year=|isbn=9780521852975|location=Cambridge|pages=297, 317–318|oclc=428776512}}&lt;/ref&gt; These passports (''zhuan'') determined a person's ability to move throughout imperial counties and through points of control. Even children needed passports, but those of one year or less who were in their mother's care might not have needed them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the medieval [[Caliphate|Islamic Caliphate]], a form of passport was the ''bara'a'', a [[receipt]] for taxes paid. Only people who paid their ''[[zakat|zakah]]'' (for [[Muslim]]s) or ''[[jizya]]'' (for [[dhimmi]]s) taxes were permitted to travel to different regions of the Caliphate; thus, the ''bara'a'' receipt was a "traveler's basic passport."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jews of Medieval Islam: Community, Society, and Identity|first=Daniel|last= Frank| publisher =[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1995|isbn=90-04-10404-6|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Etymology|Etymological]] sources show that the term "passport" is from a medieval document that was required in order to pass through the gate (or "porte") of a city wall or to pass through a territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = George William Lemon | title =English etymology; or, A derivative dictionary of the English language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RHwCAAAAQAAJ|year=1783|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RHwCAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PT397 397]}} said that ''passport'' may signify either a permission to pass through a ''portus'' or gate, but noted that an earlier work had contained information that a traveling warrant, a permission or license to pass through the whole dominions of any prince, was originally called a ''pass par teut''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Donald|title= Chamber's etymological dictionary of the English language|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=agA_AAAAcAAJ|year= 1867|publisher= W. and R. Chambers | pages =[https://books.google.com/books?id=agA_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA366 366]|quote= passport, pass&amp;acute;pōrt, ''n.'' orig. permission ''to pass'' out of ''port'' or through the gates; a written warrant granting permission to travel.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], such documents were issued to foreign travelers by local authorities (as opposed to local citizens, as is the modern practice) and generally contained a list of towns and cities the document holder was permitted to enter or pass through. On the whole, documents were not required for travel to sea ports, which were considered [[Free trade zone|open trading points]], but documents were required to travel inland from sea ports.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

King [[Henry V of England]] is credited with having invented what some consider the first passport in the modern sense, as a means of helping his subjects prove who they were in foreign lands. The earliest reference to these documents is found in a [[Safe Conducts Act 1414|1414 Act of Parliament]].&lt;ref name="brief history"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/nov/17/travelnews A brief history of the passport] - The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7634744.stm |title=Analysis: The first ID cards |accessdate=2008-09-27 |work= | publisher =BBC |date= 2008-09-25 | first=Dominic | last=Casciani}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1540, granting travel documents in England became a role of the [[Privy Council of England]], and it was around this time that the term "passport" was used. In 1794, issuing British passports became the job of the Office of the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]].&lt;ref name="brief history"/&gt; The 1548 Imperial Diet of Augsburg required the public to hold imperial documents for travel, at the risk of permanent exile.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Torpey]], Le contrôle des passeports et la liberté de circulation. Le cas de l'Allemagne au XIXe siècle, Genèses, 1998, n° 1, pp. 53–76&lt;/ref&gt;

A rapid expansion of [[Rail transport|railway infrastructure]] and wealth in Europe beginning in the mid-nineteenth century led to large increases in the volume of international travel and a consequent unique dilution of the passport system for approximately thirty years prior to [[World War I]]. The speed of trains, as well as the number of passengers that crossed multiple borders, made enforcement of passport laws difficult. The general reaction was the relaxation of passport requirements.&lt;ref name="PASSCanada"&gt;{{cite web | title= History of Passports |work= Government of Canada|url= https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadians/celebrate-being-canadian/teachers-corner/history-passports.html | accessdate=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the later part of the nineteenth century and up to World War I, passports were not required, on the whole, for travel within Europe, and crossing a border was a relatively straightforward procedure.  Consequently, comparatively few people held passports.

During World War I, European governments introduced border passport requirements for security reasons, and to control the emigration of people with useful skills. These controls remained in place after the war, becoming a standard, though controversial, procedure. British tourists of the 1920s complained, especially about attached photographs and physical descriptions, which they considered led to a "nasty dehumanization".&lt;ref&gt;Marrus, Michael, ''The Unwanted: European Refugees in the Twentieth Century''.  New York: Oxford University Press (1985), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, the [[League of Nations]] held a conference on passports, the [[Paris Conference on Passports &amp; Customs Formalities and Through Tickets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.indiana.edu/~league/1920.htm |title= League of Nations Photo Archive – Timeline – 1920| date=  | publisher= Indiana University | location=  | accessdate=  July 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Passport guidelines and a general booklet design resulted from the conference,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | publisher = IU | url = https://bl-libg-doghill.ads.iu.edu/league-web/book/p63.html | title = League of Nations 'International' or 'Standard' passport design}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was followed up by conferences in 1926 and 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~league/conferencedata.htm|title=International Conferences – League of Nations Archives|year=2002|publisher=Center for the Study of Global Change|accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the United Nations held a travel conference in 1963, no passport guidelines resulted from it. Passport standardization came about in 1980, under the auspices of the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO). ICAO standards include those for [[machine-readable passport]]s.&lt;ref name="ICAO MRTD"&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to the ICAO Machine Readable Travel Documents Programme |url=http://www.icao.int/Security/mrtd/Pages/default.aspx |publisher=ICAO |accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such passports have an area where some of the information otherwise written in textual form is written as strings of alphanumeric characters, printed in a manner suitable for [[optical character recognition]]. This enables border controllers and other law enforcement agents to process these passports more quickly, without having to input the information manually into a computer. ICAO publishes Doc 9303 ''Machine Readable Travel Documents'', the technical standard for machine-readable passports.&lt;ref name="ICAO 2006"&gt;{{cite book |publisher=ICAO |title=Machine Readable Travel Documents, Doc 9303 |year=2006 |edition=Sixth |url=http://www.icao.int/Security/mrtd/Pages/Document9303.aspx |accessdate=2013-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent standard is for [[biometric passport]]s. These contain [[biometrics]] to authenticate the identity of travellers. The passport's critical information is stored on a tiny [[RFID]] computer chip, much like information stored on [[smartcard]]s. Like some smartcards, the passport booklet design calls for an embedded contactless chip that is able to hold [[digital signature]] data to ensure the integrity of the passport and the biometric data.

==Issuance==
Historically, legal authority to issue passports is founded on the exercise of each country's executive discretion (or Crown prerogative). Certain legal tenets follow, namely: first, passports are issued in the name of the state; second, no person has a legal right to be issued a passport; third, each country's government, in exercising its executive discretion, has complete and unfettered discretion to refuse to issue or to revoke a passport; and fourth, that the latter discretion is not subject to judicial review.  However, legal scholars including A.J. Arkelian have argued that evolutions in both the constitutional law of democratic countries and the international law applicable to all countries now render those historical tenets both obsolete and unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;Arkelian, A.J.  ''"The Right to a Passport in Canadian Law."''  ''“The Canadian Yearbook of International Law,"'' Volume XXI, 1983.  Republished in November 2012 in Artsforum Magazine at http://artsforum.ca/ideas/in-depth&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arkelian, A.J.  ''“Freedom of Movement of Persons Between States and Entitlement to Passports.”''  ''Saskatchewan Law Review'', Volume 49, No. 1, 1984–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under some circumstances some countries allow people to hold more than one passport document.&lt;!--Technically this may be considered to be a single "passport" with two "documents"--&gt; This may apply, for example, to people who travel a lot on business, and may need to have, say, a passport to travel on while another is awaiting a visa for another country. The UK for example may issue a second passport if the applicant can show a need and supporting documentation, such as a letter from an employer.

===National conditions===
Many countries issue only one passport to each national (an exception is the '''Family Passport''', see below under "Types"). When passport holders apply for a new passport (commonly, due to expiration of an old passport or lack of blank pages), they may be required to surrender the old passport for invalidation. In some circumstances an expired passport is not required to be surrendered or invalidated (for example, if it contains an unexpired visa).

Under the law of most countries, passports are government property, and may be limited or revoked at any time, usually on specified grounds, and possibly subject to judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://passportinfo.com/passport-seizure/ |title=What Is a Passport Seizure?}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many countries, surrender of the passport is a condition of granting [[bail]] in lieu of imprisonment for a pending criminal trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Devine|first=F. E|title=Commercial bail bonding: a comparison of common law alternatives|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=1991|pages=84, 91, 116, 178|isbn= 978-0-275-93732-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TChu-tGy3ycC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=bail+surrender+passport+%22bail+act%22&amp;q=surrender%20%20passport%20|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each country sets its own conditions for the issue of passports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hannum|first=Hurst|title=The Right to Leave and Return in International Law and Practice|year=1987|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=9789024734450|page=73|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xyrBdidiyf8C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=some+form+of+documentation+is+required+in+every+country+for+issuance+of+a+passport&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sPaUUO2oNcWEhQfP9YDgBg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22some%20form%20of%20documentation%20is%20required%20in%20every%20country%20for%20issuance%20of%20a%20passport%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[Pakistan]] requires applicants to be interviewed before a [[Pakistani passport]] will be granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dgip.gov.pk/Files/Process.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806232542/http://www.dgip.gov.pk/Files/Process.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-08-06 |title=Government of Pakistan, Directorate General of Immigration &amp; Passports |publisher=Dgip.gov.pk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; When applying for a passport or a national ID card, all Pakistanis are required to sign an oath declaring [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] to be an impostor prophet and all [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadis]] to be non-Muslims.&lt;ref name="hanif"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/8744092.stm|title= Why Pakistan's Ahmadi community is officially detested |date= 16 June 2010|work=BBC News|first=Mohammed|last=Hanif|authorlink=Mohammed Hanif}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries limit the issuance of passports, where incoming and outgoing international travels are highly regulated, such as [[North Korea]], where general use passports are the privilege of a very small number of people trusted by the government.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}  Other countries put requirements on some citizens in order to be granted passports, such as [[Finland]], where male citizens aged 18–30 years must prove that they have completed, or are exempt from, [[Conscription in Finland|their obligatory military service]] to be granted an unrestricted passport; otherwise a passport is issued valid only until the end of their 28th year, to ensure that they return to carry out military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poliisi.fi/poliisi/home.nsf/Pages/27D36CBC704FEB01C22571CE0054A6C0|title=Passports for persons liable for military service|year=2009|publisher=Finnish Police |accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries with obligatory military service, such as Syria, have similar requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.gov.sy/cweb/MOEX_NEW/Cons_serv/con_serv_out_3_1.htm|title=Passports for Syrian Citizens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National status===
Passports contain a statement of the nationality of the holder. In most countries, only one class of nationality exists, and only one type of ordinary passport is issued. However, several types of exceptions exist:

====Multiple classes of nationality in a single country====
The [[United Kingdom]] has a number of [[British nationality law|classes of United Kingdom nationality]] due to its colonial history. As a result, the UK issues various passports which are similar in appearance but representative of different nationality statuses which, in turn, has caused foreign governments to subject holders of different [[UK passport]]s to different entry requirements.

====Multiple types of passports, one nationality====
The [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) authorizes its [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] to issue passports to their permanent residents with [[Chinese nationality law|Chinese nationality]] under the "[[one country, two systems]]" arrangement. Visa policies imposed by foreign authorities on Hong Kong and Macau permanent residents holding such passports are different from those holding ordinary passports of the People's Republic of China. A [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport]] (HKSAR passport) permits visa-free access to many more countries than ordinary [[Chinese passport|PRC passports]].

The three constituent countries of the [[Danish Realm]] have a common nationality. [[Denmark|Denmark proper]] is a member of the [[European Union]], but [[Greenland]] and [[Faroe Islands]] are not. Danish citizens residing in Greenland or Faroe Islands can choose between holding a [[Danish passport|Danish EU passport]] and a Greenlandic or Faroese non-EU Danish passport.

====Special nationality class through investment====
In rare instances a nationality is available through investment. Some investors have been described in Tongan passports as 'a Tongan protected person', a status which does not necessarily carry with it the right of abode in Tonga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crocombe|first=R. G.|title=Asia in the Pacific Islands: replacing the West |publisher=University of South Pacific Press|year=2007|page=165|isbn=978-982-02-0388-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iDg9oAkwsXAC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=%22Tongan+protected+person+passports%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Tongan%20protected%20person%20passports%22|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Passports without sovereign territory====
Several entities without a sovereign territory issue documents described as passports, most notably [[Iroquois|Iroquois League]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Question 1|url=http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=1065675600|work=Dear Uncle Ezra...|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=15 October 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/12/sports/putting-tradition-to-the-test.html | work=The New York Times | title=Putting Tradition to the Test | first=William N. | last=Wallace | date=1990-06-12 | accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Aboriginal Provisional Government]] in Australia and the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New e-Passport|url=http://www.bmlv.gv.at/truppendienst/ausgaben/artikel.php?id=433|work=Osterreichs Bundesheer|publisher=Eigentümer und Herausgeber: Bundesministerium für Landesverteidigung und Sport|accessdate=15 October 2012|language=German, English|date=February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such documents are not necessarily accepted for entry into a country.

===Validity===
{{main article|Passport validity}}
Passports have a limited validity, usually between 5 and 10 years.[[File:Adult Passport Validity Map.png|upright=3|thumb|center|Maximum adult passport validity across the world]]Many countries require a remaining [[passport validity]] of no less than six months on arrival, as well as having at least two to four blank pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/FAQs.html|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Value===
One method to measure the 'value' of a passport is to calculate its 'visa-free score' (VFS), which is the number of countries that allow the holder of that passport entry for general tourism without requiring a visa. The strongest and weakest passports are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.passportindex.org/byRank.php|title=Global Passport Power Rank {{!}} Passport Index 2018|work=Passport Index – All the world's passports in one place.|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2014}}

A rough standardization exists in types of passports throughout the world, although passport types, number of pages and definitions can vary by country.

===Full passports===
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
| [[File:Passports Front.jpg|300x150px]] [[File:Indian Passport.jpg|150x150px]]&lt;br /&gt;Left to right: diplomatic, official, and regular passport from [[India]].&lt;br /&gt;Each passport type has a different cover colour.
|}
* Passport (also called tourist passport or regular passport) – The most common form of passport, issued to citizens and other nationals. Occasionally, children are registered within the parents' passport, making it equivalent to a family passport.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}
* Official passport (also called service passport) – Issued to government employees for work-related travel, and their accompanying dependants.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}
* {{vanchor|Diplomatic passport}} – Issued to diplomats of a country and their accompanying dependents for official international travel and residence. [[Diplomatic accreditation|Accredited diplomats]] of certain grades may be granted [[diplomatic immunity]] by a host country, but this is not automatically conferred by holding a diplomatic passport. Any diplomatic privileges apply in the country to which the diplomat is accredited; elsewhere diplomatic passport holders must adhere to the same regulations and travel procedures as are required of other nationals of their country.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Holding a diplomatic passport in itself does not accord any specific privileges. At some airports, there are separate passport checkpoints for diplomatic passport holders.
* Emergency passport (also called temporary passport) – Issued to persons whose passports were lost or stolen, without time to obtain a replacement. [[Travel document|Laissez-passer]] are also used for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidance ECB08: What are acceptable travel documents for entry clearance|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/what-are-acceptable-travel-documents-for-entry-clearance-ecb08/ecb08-what-are-acceptable-travel-documents-for-entry-clearance|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:British Emergency Passport.jpg|thumb|British Emergency Passport]]
* Collective passport – Issued to defined groups for travel together to particular destinations, such as a group of school children on a school trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collective (group) passports|url=https://www.gov.uk/collective-group-passports/overview|website=GOV.UK|publisher=[[Government Digital Service]]|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Family passport – Issued to an entire family. There is one passport holder, who may travel alone or with other family members included in the passport. A family member who is not the passport holder cannot use the passport for travel without the passport holder.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Few countries now issue family passports; for example, all the [[European Union|EU]] countries and Canada require each child to have their own passport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Passports for children|url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/passport/child/index.asp|website=Canada.CA|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-citizen passports===

====Latvia and Estonia====
{{Further|Non-citizen (Latvia)|Estonian nationality law}}
Non-citizens in [[Latvia]] and Estonia are individuals, primarily of Russian or Ukrainian ethnicity, who are not citizens of Latvia or Estonia but whose families have resided in the area since the Soviet era, and thus have the right to a non-citizen passport issued by the Latvian government as well as other specific rights. Approximately two thirds of them are [[Russians in Latvia|ethnic Russians]], followed by ethnic Belarusians, ethnic Ukrainians, ethnic Poles and ethnic Lithuanians.&lt;ref name="pmlp.gov.lv"&gt;[http://www.pmlp.gov.lv/lv/assets/documents/statistika/01.01.2015/ISVN_Latvija_pec_TTB_VPD.pdf Population of Latvia by ethnicity and nationality; Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs] 2015{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vvc.gov.lv/export/sites/default/docs/LRTA/Likumi/On_the_Status_of_those_Former_U.S.S.R._Citizens.doc Section 1 and Section 8, Law "On the Status of those Former U.S.S.R. Citizens who do not have the Citizenship of Latvia or that of any Other State"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303174813/http://vvc.gov.lv/export/sites/default/docs/LRTA/Likumi/On_the_Status_of_those_Former_U.S.S.R._Citizens.doc |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-citizens in the two countries are issued special non-citizen passports&lt;ref name=AmnInt&gt;[http://report2009.amnesty.org/en/regions/europe-central-asia/latvia Amnesty International 2009 Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610075623/http://report2009.amnesty.org/en/regions/europe-central-asia/latvia |date=2009-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hammarberg|first1=Thomas|title=No one should have to be stateless in today's Europe|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/48abd54e5.html|publisher=Council of Europe: Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to regular passports issued by the Estonian and Latvian authorities to citizens.

====American Samoa====
{{Main article|United States nationality law#Nationals}}

Although all U.S. citizens are also U.S. nationals, the reverse is not true.  As specified in {{usc|8|1408}}, a person whose only connection to the U.S. is through birth in an outlying possession (which is defined in {{usc|8|1101}} as [[American Samoa]] and [[Swains Island]], the latter of which is administered as part of American Samoa), or through descent from a person so born, acquires U.S. nationality but not U.S. citizenship. This was formerly the case in only four other current or former [[U.S. overseas possessions]].&lt;ref&gt;In the [[Panama Canal Zone]] only those persons born there prior to January 1, 2000 with at least one parent as a U.S. citizen were recognized as U.S. citizens and were both nationals and citizens. Also in the former [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] the residents were considered nationals and citizens of the Trust Territory and not U.S. nationals.&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. passport issued to non-citizen nationals contains the endorsement code 9 which states: "THE BEARER IS A UNITED STATES NATIONAL AND NOT A UNITED STATES CITIZEN." on the annotations page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
|url=https://fam.state.gov/fam/08fam/08fam050502.html#M505_2_2
|title=8 FAM 505.2 Passport Endorsements
|publisher=U.S. Department of State
|accessdate=2018-07-18
|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-citizen U.S. nationals may reside and work in the United States without restrictions, and may apply for citizenship under the same rules as resident aliens. Like resident aliens, they are [[Right of foreigners to vote in the United States|not presently allowed by any U.S. state to vote in federal or state elections]], although, as with resident aliens, there is no constitutional prohibition against their doing so.

====United Kingdom====
{{Main article|British nationality law#Classes of British nationality}}

Due to the complexity of [[British nationality law]], the United Kingdom has six variants of British nationality. Out of these variants, however, only the status known as [[British citizen]] grants the right of abode in a particular country or territory (the United Kingdom) while others do not. Hence, the UK issues [[British passport]]s to those who are British nationals but not [[British citizen]]s, which include [[British Overseas Territories citizen]]s, [[British Overseas citizen]]s, [[British subject]]s, [[British Nationals (Overseas)]] and [[British Protected Person]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/british-passport-eligibility British passport eligibility]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Andorra ====
Children born in Andorra to foreign residents who have not yet resided in the country for a minimum of 10 years are provided a provisional passport. Once the child reaches 18 years old he or she must confirm their nationality to the Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://andorraguides.com/citizenship/by-investment/|title=Andorra Citizenship by Investment {{!}} Andorra Guides|date=2018-06-28|work=Andorra Guides|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other types of travel documents===
[[File:Nansenpassport.jpg|thumb|[[Nansen passport]] for [[refugee]]s (now defunct)]]
* [[Travel document#Laissez-passer and emergency passports|Laissez-passer]] – Issued by national governments or international organizations (such as the [[United Nations Laissez-Passer|U.N.]]) as emergency passports, travel on humanitarian grounds, or for official travel.
* [[Interpol Travel Document]] – Issued by [[Interpol]] to police officers for official travel, allowing them to bypass certain visa restrictions in certain member states when investigating transnational crime.
* [[Certificate of identity]] (also called alien's passport, or informally, a Travel Document) – Issued under certain circumstances, such as [[statelessness]], to non-citizen residents. An example is the "[[Nansen passport]]" (pictured). Sometimes issued as an internal passport to non-residents.
* [[Refugee travel document]] – Issued to a refugee by the state in which she or he currently resides allowing them to travel outside that state and to return. Made necessary because refugees are unlikely to be able to obtain passports from their state of nationality.
* Permits. Many types of travel permit exist around the world. Some, like the [[U.S. Re-entry Permit]] and [[Japan Re-entry Permit]], allow residents of those countries who are unable to obtain a permit to travel outside the country and return.  Others, like the [[Bangladesh]] Special Passport,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangladesh.gov.bd/index.php?Itemid=27&amp;id=141&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=category |title=National Web Portal Of Bangladesh – Citizen Services |publisher=Bangladesh.gov.bd |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[People's Republic of China Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macau|Two-way permit]], and the Taibaozheng ([[Taiwan Compatriot Entry Permit]]), are used for travel to and from specific countries or locations, for example to travel between [[mainland China]] and [[Macau]], or between [[Taiwan]] and [[China]].
* [[Chinese Travel Document]] – Issued by the [[China|People's Republic of China]] to Chinese citizens in lieu of a passport.
* [[Hajj passport]] – a special passport used only for [[Hajj]] and [[Umrah]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]].

===Intra-sovereign territory travel that requires passports===
For some countries, passports are required for some types of travel between their sovereign territories.  Two examples of this are:

*Hong Kong and Macau, both Chinese special administrative regions (SARs), have their own immigration control systems different from each other and mainland China. Travelling between the three is technically not international, so residents of the three locations do not use passports to travel between the three places, instead using other documents, such as the [[Home Return Permit|Mainland Travel Permit]] (for the people of Hong Kong and Macau). Foreigners are required to present their passports with applicable visas at the immigration control points.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}
*Malaysia, where an arrangement was agreed upon during the formation of the country, the [[East Malaysia]]n states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] were allowed to retain their respective immigration control systems. Therefore, a passport is required for foreigners when travelling from [[Peninsular Malaysia]] to East Malaysia, as well as traveling between Sabah and Sarawak. For social/business visits not more than 3 months, Peninsular Malaysians are required to produce a [[MyKad|Malaysian identity card]] or, for children below 12 years a [[birth certificate]], and obtain a special immigration printout form to be kept until departure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imi.gov.my/index.php/en/main-services/travel-document/document-in-lieu-of-internal-travel-document Document In Lieu of Internal Travel Document IMM.114], Immigration Department of Malaysia; retrieved 26 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; However, one may present a [[Malaysian passport]] or a Restricted Travel Document and get an entry stamp on the travel document to avoid the hassle of keeping an extra sheet of paper. For other purposes, Peninsular Malaysians are required to have a long-term residence permit along with a passport or a Restricted Travel Document.
*[[Norfolk Island]], one of [[States and territories of Australia|Australia's external, self-governing territories]], has its own immigration controls. Until 2018, Australian and New Zealand citizens travelling to the territory were required to carry a passport, or an [[Australian Document of Identity]], while people of other nationalities must also have a valid Australian visa and/or [[Permanent Resident of Norfolk Island visa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.norfolkisland.com.au/general-info/customs-a-immigration |title=NorfolkIsland.com |access-date=2016-01-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204063337/https://www.norfolkisland.com.au/general-info/customs-a-immigration |archive-date=2016-02-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal passports===
[[Internal passport]]s are issued by some countries as an [[identity document]]. An example is the [[internal passport of Russia]] or certain other post-Soviet countries dating back to imperial times. Some countries use internal passports for controlling migration within a country. In some countries, the ''international passport'' or ''passport for travel abroad'' is a second passport, in addition to the internal passport, required for a citizen to travel abroad within the country of residence.
Separate passports for travel abroad existed or exist in the following countries:
*[[Russia]]: see [[Russian passport]]
*[[Ukraine]]: see [[Ukrainian passport]]
*In the [[Soviet Union]], there were several types of international passport: an ordinary one, a civil service passport, a diplomatic passport, and a sailor's passport. See [[Passport system in the Soviet Union]].
*Countries of the [[Eastern Bloc]] had a system of internal/international passports similar to that of the Soviet Union.

==Designs and format==

===International Civil Aviation Organization standards===
[[File:Passport design world map.png|upright=3|thumb|Colors across the world for modern passport booklet covers]]
[[File:Indian Passport Information page Censored New.jpg|thumb|200px|Information page of a machine readable passport]]

The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) issues passport standards which are treated as recommendations to national governments. The size of passport booklets normally complies with the [[ISO/IEC 7810]] ID-3 standard, which specifies a size of 125 × 88&amp;nbsp;mm (4.921 × 3.465 in). This size is the [[ISO 216|B7]] format. Passport cards are issued to the ID-1 (credit card sized) standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | quote = ICAO’s work on machine readable travel documents began in 1968 with the establishment, by the Air Transport Committee of the Council, of a Panel on Passport Cards. This Panel was charged with developing recommendations for a standardized passport book or card that would be machine readable, in the interest of accelerating the clearance of passengers through passport controls.&amp;nbsp;... In 1998, the New Technologies Working Group of the TAG/MRTD began work to establish the most effective biometric identification system and associated means of data storage for use in MRTD applications, particularly in relation to document issuance and immigration considerations. The bulk of the work had been completed by the time the events of 11 September 2001 caused States to attach greater importance to the security of a travel document and the identification of its holder. The work was quickly finalized and endorsed by the TAG/MRTD and the Air Transport Committee.&amp;nbsp;...

Passport booklets from almost all countries around the world display the [[national coat of arms]] of the issuing country on the front cover. The United Nations keeps a record of national coats of arms.

There are several groups of countries, who through mutual agreement, have adopted common designs for the passports of their respective countries:

* The European Union. The design and layout of passports of the member states of the European Union are a result of consensus and recommendation, rather than of directive.&lt;ref&gt;Resolutions of 23 June 1981, 30 June 1982, 14 July 1986 and 10 July 1995 concerning the introduction of a passport of uniform pattern, OJEC, 19 September 1981, C 241, p. 1; 16 July 1982, C 179, p. 1; 14 July 1986, C 185, p. 1; 4 August 1995, C 200, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Passports are issued by member states and may consist of either the usual passport booklet or the newer passport card format. The covers of ordinary passport booklets are burgundy-red (except for Croatia which has a blue cover), with "European Union" written in the national language or languages. Below that are the name of the country, the national coat of arms, the word or words for "passport", and, at the bottom, the symbol for a biometric passport. The data page can be at the front or at the back of a passport booklet and there are significant design differences throughout to indicate which member state is the issuer.&lt;ref group=note&gt;All nations issuing EU passports make an effort to ensure that their passports feature nationally distinctive designs. Finnish passports make [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym4v2TBJwuI a flip-book of a moose walking]. The [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/473495/HMPO_magazine.pdf UK passport launched on 3 November 2015] features Shakespeare's Globe Theater on pages 26–27, with architectural plans as well as performers on stage. Each UK passport page is completely different from all the other pages and from all the other pages of other EU passports.&lt;/ref&gt; Member states that participate in the [[Schengen Agreement]] have agreed that their e-Passports should contain fingerprint information in the chip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:02004R2252-20090626&amp;qid=1518713474119&amp;from=EN |title= Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 of 13 December 2004 on standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents issued by Member States| date=29 December 2004 |publisher=Official Journal of the European Union |accessdate=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2006, the members of the [[Central America-4 Border Control Agreement|CA-4]] Treaty ([[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], and [[Nicaragua]]) adopted a common-design passport, called the [[Central America-4 passport|Central American passport]], following a design already in use by Nicaragua and El Salvador since the mid-1990s. It features a navy-blue cover with the words "América Central" and a map of Central America, and with the territory of the issuing country highlighted in gold (in place of the individual nations' coats of arms). At the bottom of the cover are the name of the issuing country and the passport type.
* The members of the [[Andean Community of Nations]] ([[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Peru]]) began to issue commonly designed passports in 2005. Specifications for the common passport format were outlined in an Andean Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sice.oas.org/trade/junac/decisiones/dec525e.asp Andean Community / Decision 525: Minimum specific technical characteristics of Andean Passport].&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously-issued national passports will be valid until their expiry dates. Andean passports are bordeaux (burgundy-red), with words in gold. Centered above the national seal of the issuing country is the name of the regional body in Spanish (''Comunidad Andina''). Below the seal is the official name of the member country. At the bottom of the cover is the Spanish word "pasaporte" along with the English "passport". Venezuela had issued Andean passports, but has subsequently left the Andean Community, so they will no longer issue Andean passports.
* The [[Union of South American Nations]] signaled an intention to establish a common passport design, but it appears that implementation will take many years.

[[File:Trinidad&amp;TobagoPassportCover.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Trinidad and Tobago passport]] with the [[CARICOM]] logo at the top]]
* The member states of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) recently{{when|date=January 2018}} began issuing passports with a [[CARICOM passport|common design]]. It features the CARICOM symbol along with the national coat of arms and name of the member state, rendered in a CARICOM official language (English, [[French language|French]], Dutch). The member states which use the common design are [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Barbados]], [[Belize]], [[Dominica]], [[Grenada]], [[Guyana]], [[Jamaica]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Suriname]], and [[Trinidad and Tobago]].  There was a movement by the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS) to issue a common designed passport, but the implementation of the CARICOM passport made that redundant, and it was abandoned.

Passports sometimes&lt;!-- make sure you provide an appropriate reference if you change "sometimes" to anything else (e.g. "often") that implies some higher-level commonality than a case-by-case examples of a few countries like the US --&gt; contain a message, usually near the front, requesting that the passport's bearer be allowed to pass freely, and further requesting that, in the event of need, the bearer be granted assistance. The message is sometimes made in the name of the government or the head of state, and may be written in more than one language, depending on the language policies of the issuing authority.

===Languages===

{{Refimprove section|date= January 2014}}

In 1920, an international conference on passports and through tickets held by the [[League of Nations]] recommended that passports be issued in [[French language|French]], historically the language of diplomacy, and one other language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baenninger|first=Martin|title=In the eye of the wind: a travel memoir of prewar Japan |publisher=McGill-Queen's Press – MQUP|location=Cheltenham, England|year=2009|series=Footprints|volume=Footprints|page=12|isbn=978-0-7735-3497-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HOtze2tfb_IC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=conference+on+passports+and+through+tickets+1920+French+diplomacy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bhzFTtmdL8TKhAe79s3pDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=lingua%20franca&amp;f=false|accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the [[ICAO]] recommends that passports be issued in English and French, or in the national language of the issuing country and in either English or French. Many European countries use their national language, along with English and French.

Some unusual language combinations are:
* Passports of European Union states bear all of the official languages of the EU. Two or three languages are printed at the relevant points, followed by reference numbers which point to the passport page where translations into the remaining languages appear. In addition to the official EU languages, British passports bear [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]].
* The [[Barbadian passport]] and the [[United States passport]] are tri-lingual: English, French and Spanish. United States passports were traditionally English and French, but began being printed with a Spanish message and labels during the late 1990s, in recognition of [[Puerto Rico]]'s Spanish-speaking status. Only the message and labels are in multiple languages, the cover and instructions pages are printed solely in English.
* In Belgium, all three official languages (Dutch, French, German) appear on the cover, in addition to English on the main page. The order of the official languages depends on the official residence of the holder.
* Passports of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] are in the three official languages (Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian), in addition to English.
* [[Brazilian passport]]s contain four languages: Portuguese, the official country language, Spanish, in accordance with neighboring nations, English and French.
* [[Cypriot passport]]s are in Greek, Turkish and English.
* The first page of a [[Libyan passport]] is in Arabic only. The last page (first page from western viewpoint) has an English equivalent of the information on the Arabic first page (western last page). Similar arrangements are found in passports of some other Arab countries.
* [[Iraqi passport]]s are in Arabic, Kurdish and English.
* [[Macau SAR passport]]s are in three languages: Chinese, Portuguese and English.
* [[New Zealand passport]]s are in English and [[Māori language|Māori]].
* [[Norwegian passport]]s are in the two forms of the Norwegian language, [[Bokmål]] and [[Nynorsk]], and in English.
* [[Sri Lankan passport]]s are in [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and English.
* [[Swiss passport]]s are in five languages: German, French, Italian, [[Romansh language|Romansh]] and English.
* [[Syrian passport]]s are in Arabic, English, and French.

===Immigration stamps===
{{Refimprove section|date= January 2014}}
{{Main article|Passport stamp}}

For immigration control, officials of many countries use entry and exit stamps. Depending on the country, a stamp can serve different purposes. For example, in the United Kingdom, an immigration stamp in a passport includes the formal [[leave to enter]] granted to a person subject to entry control. In other countries, a stamp activates or acknowledges the continuing leave conferred in the passport bearer's [[Entry Clearance|entry clearance]].

Under the Schengen system, a foreign passport is stamped with a date stamp which does not indicate any duration of stay. This means that the person is deemed to have permission to remain either for three months or for the period shown on his visa if specified otherwise.

Visas often take the form of an inked stamp, although some countries use adhesive stickers that incorporate security features to discourage forgery.

Member states of the European Union are not permitted to place a stamp in the passport of a person who is not subject to immigration control. Stamping is prohibited because it is an imposition of a control that the person is not subject to.

Countries usually have different styles of stamps for entries and exits, to make it easier to identify the movements of people. Ink color might be used to designate mode of transportation (air, land or sea), such as in Hong Kong prior to 1997; while border styles did the same thing in Macau. Other variations include changing the size of the stamp to indicate length of stay, as in Singapore.

Immigration stamps are a useful reminder of travels. Some travellers "collect" immigration stamps in passports, and will choose to enter or exit countries via different means (for example, land, sea or air) in order to have different stamps in their passports.  Some countries, such as Liechtenstein,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.about-liechtenstein.co.uk/tourism/|title=About Liechtenstein - Tourism Overview|work=about-liechtenstein.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; that do not stamp passports may provide a passport stamp on request for such "memory" purposes.  Monaco (at its tourist office) and Andorra (at its border) do this as well. These are official stamps issued by government offices. However, some private enterprises may for a price stamp passports at historic sites and these have no legal standing.  It is possible that such memorial stamps can preclude the passport bearer from travelling to certain countries. For example, Finland consistently rejects what they call 'falsified passports', where travelers have been refused visas or entry due to memorial stamps and are required to renew their passports.

==Limitations on use==
{{Refimprove section|date= January 2014}}
{{main article|Visa (document)}}
A passport is merely an identity document that is widely recognised for international travel purposes, and the possession of a passport does not in itself entitle a traveller to enter any country other than the country that issued it, and sometimes not even then. Many countries normally require visitors to obtain a visa. Each country has different requirements or conditions for the grant of visas, such as for the visitor not being likely to become a public charge for financial, health, family, or other reasons, and the holder not having been convicted of a crime or considered likely to commit one.&lt;ref name=usdhs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/chris-brown-wont-be-able-to-come-to-australia-unless-he-challenges-visa-refusal-20150926-gjvqfq.html Chris Brown won't be able to come to Australia unless he challenges visa refusal and wins]&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a country does not recognise another, or is in dispute with it, entry may be prohibited to holders of passports of the other party to the dispute, and sometimes to others who have, for example, visited the other country; examples are listed below. A country that issues a passport may also restrict its validity or use in specified circumstances, such as use for travel to certain countries for political, security or health reasons.

{{Main article|Bangladeshi passport|Chinese passport|Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport|Israeli passport|Macau Special Administrative Region passport|Philippine passport|Republic of Korea passport|Taiwan passport}}

* Bangladesh – a [[Bangladeshi passport]] is valid for travel to all countries except Israel.
* [[Mainland China]] and Taiwan – Nationals of Taiwan (ROC) use a special travel permit ([[Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents]]) issued by China's (PRC) [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Security]] to enter mainland China. Nationals of Mainland China entering Taiwan must also use a special travel permit ([[Exit &amp; Entry Permit (Republic of China)|Exit &amp; Entry Permit]]) issued by the ROC's immigration department. Depending on where they're traveling from, they also need either a Chinese passport when departing from outside Mainland China, or a passport-like travel document, known as Taiwan Travel Permit for Mainland Residents, when departing from Mainland China (along with a special visa-like exit endorsement issued by PRC immigration authorities affixed to the permit). Chinese nationals who are Hong Kong and Macau permanent residents can apply for the ROC Exit and Entry Permit online or on arrival and must travel with their [[HKSAR passport]], [[MSAR passport]] or [[BN(O) passport]].
* Hong Kong and Macau – A '[[Home Return Permit]]' is required for Chinese citizens domiciled in Hong Kong and Macau to enter and exit mainland China. The [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport]] and the [[Macau Special Administrative Region passport]] cannot be used for travel to mainland China. Also, [[British National (Overseas) passport]]s cannot be used by Chinese citizens who reside in Hong Kong as the PRC does not recognize dual nationality.  Mainland China residents visiting Hong Kong or Macau are required to hold an [[Two-way Permit|Exit-entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macau]] (往来港澳通行证 or 双程证) issued by Mainland authorities, along with an endorsement (签注), on the Exit-entry Permit which needs to be applied each time (similar to a [[visa (document)|visa]]) when visiting the SARs (except residents with [[hukou system|hukou]] in [[Shenzhen]] can apply for a multi-entry endorsement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arrangement for entry to Hong Kong from Mainland China|url=http://www.immd.gov.hk/ehtml/hkvisas_9.htm|work=Immigration Department, The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|publisher=www.immd.gov.hk|accessdate=2008-05-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601055247/http://www.immd.gov.hk/ehtml/hkvisas_9.htm|archivedate=2008-06-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-permanent residents of Macau who are not eligible for a passport may travel to Hong Kong on the Visit Permit to Hong Kong (澳門居民往來香港特別行政區旅行證) valid for 7 years, which allows holders to travel only to Hong Kong SAR during its validity.

{{Main article|Visa policy of Azerbaijan|Visa policy of Armenia|Cypriot passport|Spanish passport|British passport (Gibraltar)}}

* As a result of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] between [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Armenia]], Azerbaijan refuses entry to holders of [[Armenian passport]]s, as well as passport-holders of any other country if they are of Armenian descent. It also strictly refuses entry to foreigners in general whose passport shows evidence of entry into the self-proclaimed [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]], immediately declaring them permanent [[Persona non grata|personae non gratae]].  Conversely, Armenia does allow visa-free entry for holders of [[Azerbaijani passport]]s.
* The [[Northern Cyprus|Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] (TRNC) issues passports, but only Turkey recognises its statehood. [[TRNC passport]]s are not accepted for entry into the [[Republic of Cyprus]] via airports or sea ports, but are accepted at the designated green line crossing points. However, all [[Turkish Cypriots]] are entitled by law to the issue of a [[Cypriot passport|Republic of Cyprus EU passport]], and since the opening of the border between the two sides, Cypriot and EU citizens can travel freely between them.  The United Kingdom, United States, France, Australia, Pakistan and Syria currently officially accept TRNC passports with the relevant visas.
* Spain does not accept United Kingdom [[Gibraltar passport|passports issued in Gibraltar]], alleging that the [[Politics of Gibraltar|Government of Gibraltar]] is not a competent authority for issuing [[British passport|UK passports]].  The word "Gibraltar" now appears beneath the words "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" on the covers of British passports issued in Gibraltar.
*[[British passport]]s may be issued to people holding any of the various forms of [[British nationality law|British nationality]], with holders identified {{As of|2014|lc=y}} as: [[British citizen]]s (GBR), [[British Overseas Territories Citizen]]s (GBD), [[British Overseas citizen]]s (GBO), [[British subject]]s (GBS), [[British protected person]]s (GBP), and [[British National (Overseas)|British Nationals (Overseas)]] (GBN). Holders other than British citizens may not have the [[Right of Abode (United Kingdom)|right to enter or reside in the United Kingdom]], and other countries may apply restrictions that do not apply to GBR holders.

* For countries that do not maintain diplomatic relations with [[Brazil]], such as [[Kosovo]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic|Western Sahara]], diplomatic, official and work passports are not accepted, and visas are only granted to tourist or business visitors. In addition, except for Kosovo and Taiwan, these visas must be issued on a Brazilian “laissez-passer”, not on the country's passport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portalconsular.mre.gov.br/estrangeiros/1qgrv-simples-ing-25.06.2015.pdf Entrance Visas in Brazil] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924075954/http://www.portalconsular.mre.gov.br/estrangeiros/1qgrv-simples-ing-25.06.2015.pdf |date=2015-09-24 }}, Ministry of Foreign Relations of Brazil, August 12, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International travel without passports==
International travel is possible without passports in some circumstances.&lt;ref name=Timatic_olympicair&gt;[https://www.olympicair.com/en/Info/Timatic PASSPORT &amp; VISA REQUIREMENTS] (Timatic, through olympicair.com)&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, a document stating citizenship, such as a [[national identity card]] or an [[Enhanced Drivers License]], is usually required.&lt;ref name=Timatic_olympicair/&gt;

===Africa===
* Members of the East African Community (composed of [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]) may issue an [[East African Community#East African passport|East African passport]]. East African passports are recognised by only the five members, and are only used for travel between or among those countries. The requirements for eligibility are less rigorous than are the requirements for national passports used for other international travel.
* The member states of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) do not require passports for their citizens traveling within the community. National ID cards are sufficient. The member states are [[Benin]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Guinea-Bissau|Guinea Bissau]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Liberia]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]], [[Sierra Leone]], and [[Togo]].

===Asia===
* Passports are not needed by citizens of [[India]] and [[Nepal]] to travel to each other's country, but some identification is required for border crossings. Additionally, Indians can travel in [[Bhutan]] without a passport, while Bhutanese must travel with their citizenship identity cards.
* Lebanon and Syria citizens do not require passports when traveling in either country if they are carrying ID cards.
* Travel between [[Russia]] and some former Soviet republics, designated by membership in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], may be accomplished with a national identity document (e.g. an [[internal passport]]) or passport.  However, according to a statement made by President Putin in December 2012, Russia has plans to restrict travel without a passport only to citizens of the member states of the [[Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia]] by 2015. After that date, citizens of other CIS states will need passports (although not visas) to visit Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ria.ru/society/20121212/914456159.html Путин: въезд в РФ должен быть разрешен только по загранпаспортам] (Putin: passports will be required for entering Russia), 2012-12-12 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Citizens of the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf]] countries need only national ID cards (also referred to as civil ID cards) to cross the borders of council countries. This also applies to anyone that has a residence permit in any of the GCC countries.
* The 20 countries of the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] issue the [[APEC Business Travel Card]], which allows visa-free entry into all participating countries.

===Europe===
* Travel with minimal travel documents is possible between the United Kingdom, the [[Isle of Man]], the [[Channel Islands]], and the Republic of Ireland, which together form the [[Common Travel Area]].
* The countries that apply the [[Schengen Agreement]] ([[Schengen Area]], a subset of the [[European Economic Area|EEA]]) do not implement passport controls between each other, unless exceptional circumstances occur. It is, however, mandatory to carry a passport, compliant national identity card or alien's resident permit.
* A citizen of one of the 28 member states of the European Union or of Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, Norway, San Marino, Iceland and Switzerland may travel in and between these countries using a standard compliant [[National identity cards in the European Economic Area|National Identity Card]] rather than a passport. Not all EU/EEA member states issue standard compliant national identity cards, notably Denmark, Norway, Iceland, the Republic of Ireland (though the [[Irish passport card]] is accepted), and the United Kingdom.
* The [[Nordic Passport Union]] allows Nordic citizens—citizens from Denmark (including the Faroe Islands), Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden to visit any of these countries without being in possession of identity documents (Greenland and Svalbard are excluded). This is an extension of the principle that Nordic citizens need no identity document in their own country. A means to prove identity when requested is recommended (e.g. using a driver's license, which does not state citizenship), even in one's own country. Joining the Schengen Area in 1997 has not changed these rules.
* [[Albania]] accepts national ID cards or passports for entry from nationals of the EU, EFTA, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Monaco, Montenegro, the Republic of Macedonia, San Marino and Singapore.
* [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] accepts national ID cards or passports for entry from citizens of the EU, EFTA, Montenegro, Monaco, San Marino and Serbia.
* The [[Republic of Macedonia]] accepts national ID cards or passports for entry from nationals of the EU, EFTA, Albania, Montenegro and Serbia.
* [[Montenegro]] accepts national ID cards or passports for entry from nationals of the EU, EFTA, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Monaco, the Republic of Macedonia, San Marino and Serbia.
* [[Serbia]] accepts national ID cards or passports for entry from nationals of the EU, EFTA (except Liechtenstein), Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and the Republic of Macedonia.
* Citizens of Belgium, France, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], Germany, Greece, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxemburg, Malta, the Netherlands, the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]], Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and Ukraine are allowed to enter [[Turkey]] with a valid national ID card.
* EU and Turkish citizens are allowed to enter the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus with a valid ID card.
* EU and Turkish citizens are allowed to enter Georgia with a valid ID card.

===North America===
[[Image:Passport card.jpg|thumb|The United States Passport Card]]
[[File:NEXUSCard.png|thumb|A [[NEXUS (frequent traveler program)|NEXUS]] Card]]

*[[CARICOM]] countries issue a [[CARICOM passport]] to their citizens, and as of June 2009, eligible nationals in participating countries will be permitted to use the CARICOM travel card which provides for intra-community travel without a passport.
*There are several cards available to certain North American residents which allow passport free travel; generally only for land and sea border crossings:

::#  The U.S. Passport card is an alternative to an ordinary U.S. passport booklet for ''land and sea travel'' within North America (Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Bermuda). Like the passport book, the passport card is issued only to U.S. citizens and non-citizen nationals.&lt;ref name="cbpvacation" /&gt;
::# The [[NEXUS (frequent traveler program)|NEXUS card]] allows border crossing between the U.S. and Canada for U.S. nationals and Canadian citizens. It can also be used for air travel as the only means of identification for U.S. nationals and Canadian citizens. The card can also be used for entering the U.S. from Mexico but not vice versa.&lt;ref name="cbpvacation" /&gt;
::# The [[Secure Electronic Network for Travelers Rapid Inspection|SENTRI card]] allows passport-free entry into the U.S. from Mexico and Canada (but not vice versa) for U.S. citizens and nationals as well as Canadian citizens.&lt;ref name="cbpvacation" /&gt;
::# The [[Free and Secure Trade|FAST card]] can be used for crossing between U.S. and Canada, as well as entering U.S. from Mexico for U.S. and Canadian citizens.&lt;ref name="cbpvacation" /&gt;
::# U.S. nationals may further enter the U.S. and Canada using an [[Enhanced Drivers License|enhanced driver license]] issued by the States of [[Vermont]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Michigan]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] (which qualify as [[Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative|WHTI]] compliant). Other documents that can be used to enter the U.S. include: enhanced tribal cards; U.S. military ID cards plus military travel orders; U.S. [[Merchant Mariner's Document|merchant mariner ID card]]s, when traveling on maritime business; [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribal ID cards; Form I-872 American Indian card.&lt;ref name="cbpvacation"&gt;[https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/western-hemisphere-travel-initiative Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt;
::# Canadian citizens may enter the U.S. and Canada via land or sea using an enhanced WHTI-compliant driver's license. These are currently issued by [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], and [[Ontario]]. If Canadians wish to enter the U.S. via air, they must use a passport book or a NEXUS card.&lt;ref name="cbpvacation" /&gt;
::# Canadian citizens may return to Canada using any proof of citizenship and identity, however those without an acceptable document will be questioned by a Border Services officer until their identity is established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsa.gc.ca/travel-voyage/td-dv-eng.html Travel Documents]&lt;/ref&gt;
::#For travel to the French islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] directly from Canada, Canadians and foreign nationals holding Canadian identification documents are exempted from passport and visa requirements for stays of maximum duration of 3 months within a period of 6 months. Accepted documents include a driver's licence, citizenship card, permanent resident card and others. Those without Canadian identifications are not exempt and must carry a passport.

===Oceania===
[[File:TorresStraitIslandsMap.png|thumb|The [[Torres Strait]] separating [[Australia]] and [[Papua New Guinea|Papua]]]]

* Residents of nine coastal villages in [[Papua New Guinea]] are permitted to enter the 'Protected Zone' of the [[Torres Strait]]  (part of [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]) for traditional purposes. This exemption from passport control is part of a treaty between Australia and Papua New Guinea negotiated when PNG became independent from Australia in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/torres_strait/index.html|title=Torres Strait Treaty and You - What is free movement for traditional activities?|publisher=Australian Government = Dept. of Foreign Affairs and Trade|accessdate=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vessels from other parts of Papua New Guinea and other countries attempting to cross into Australia or Australian waters are stopped by [[Australian Customs and Border Protection Service|Australian Customs]] or the [[Royal Australian Navy]].

===South America===
*Many Central American and South American nationals can travel within their respective regional economic zones, such as [[Mercosur]] and the [[Andean Community of Nations]], or on a bilateral basis (e.g., between Chile and Peru, between Brazil and Chile), without passports, presenting instead their national ID cards, or, for short stays, their voter-registration cards. In some cases this travel must be done overland rather than by air. There are plans to extend these rights to all of South America under a [[Union of South American Nations]], and it already extends them (since 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2008/06/28/elmundo/i-01703744.htm |title=Ya no se requerirá pasaporte para viajar por Sudamérica |publisher=Edant.clarin.com |date=2008-06-28 |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to every South American country except Guyana and Suriname.

'''Paul Hunt''', a New Zealand and British national, is a human rights scholar-activist who specialises in economic, social and cultural rights. A Professor of Law at the Human Rights Centre, [[University of Essex]] (UK), he has held senior UN appointments, including Rapporteur of the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1999–2002), UN Special Rapporteur on the right to the highest attainable standard of health (2002–2008) and Senior Human Rights Advisor to the Assistant Director-General, [[World Health Organization]], Flavia Bustreo (2011–2013). He is a Visiting Professor at the [[University of Waikato]], [[New Zealand]]/[[Aotearoa]].

==Background==
Hunt is a [[New Zealand]] and British national. For most of his formative years, he lived in [[Essex]], Suffolk and [[Norfolk]] (UK). In 1979, he graduated from [[Cambridge University]] (UK) with a law degree. In 1995, he was awarded a Masters of Jurisprudence (1st Class Hons) by the [[University of Waikato]] (New Zealand). In 2008, he was given an Honorary Doctorate by the Nordic School of Public Health. Since 2000, he has lived in [[Wivenhoe]], Essex.
In 1982, Hunt qualified as a solicitor in England and Wales. Between 1982 and 1985, he worked for Kingsley Napley (London) as a civil and criminal litigation solicitor, and assistant to the Senior Partner, Sir [[David Napley]], formerly President of the Law Society. During this period, Hunt was elected to the National Council of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]].

==Human rights in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, UK and Gambia==
In 1985, Hunt left private practice and became a human rights lawyer in [[Israel]]/[[Palestinian territories|Palestine]] working for Quaker Peace and Service (now [[Quaker Peace and Social Witness]]). Between 1985 and 1987, he lived in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]] and researched the Israeli Military Courts. Published in 1987, ''Justice? The Military Court System in the Israeli-Occupied Territories'', examined the Military Courts through the 'lens' of Israel's international human rights obligations.&lt;ref&gt; Paul Hunt, Justice? The Military Court System in the Israeli-Occupied Territories, al-Haq/Gaza Centre for Rights and Law, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to the UK, Hunt worked with Sydney Bailey on an inter-denominational project about human rights in Britain and Ireland. The project included [[Mary Robinson]], shortly to become the President of Ireland, and [[David Trimble]], shortly to become leader of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] and First Minister of Northern Ireland. The project led to ''Human Rights and Responsibilities in Britain and Ireland'', edited by Bailey,&lt;ref&gt; Sydney Bailey (ed.), ''Human rights and responsibilities in Britain and Ireland'', Macmillan, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; and a shorter version, ''A Christian Perspective on Human Rights and Responsibilities: with Special Reference to Northern Ireland'', edited by Hunt.&lt;ref&gt; Paul Hunt (ed.), ''A Christian perspective on human rights and responsibilities: with special reference to Northern Ireland'', Christian Action, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1987–1990, Hunt worked for the National Council for Civil Liberties/[[Liberty]] (UK) as Legal Officer, Head of the Legal and Campaign Team and Acting general secretary. He conducted national and international human rights cases, including litigation in Strasbourg under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt; For example, ''Thynne, Wilson and Gunnel v UK'', 13 EHRR 666&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to prisoners' rights, he worked on the lawfulness of Northern Ireland's emergency laws.&lt;ref&gt; Brice Dickson and Paul Hunt, "Northern Ireland's emergency laws and international human rights", NQHR, 1993, 173,&lt;/ref&gt; and was responsible for one of the earliest publications in favour of incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law.&lt;ref&gt; ''A Bill of Rights: why the European Convention on Human Rights should be incorporated into UK law'', Briefing No.13, Liberty, 1989. &lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1990–1992, Hunt was appointed Associate Director of the African Centre for Democracy and Human Rights Studies (Gambia), working under Raymond Sock (formerly Solicitor-General) and [[Hassan Jallow]] (then Minister of Justice). The Centre paralleled and monitored the new Gambian-based [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] established under the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. With Jallow, Hunt co-authored one of the first publications on [[HIV/AIDS]] and human rights in Africa,&lt;ref&gt; Paul Hunt and Hassan Jallow, ''AIDS and the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights'', ACDHRS, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; as well as research on African national human rights institutions,&lt;ref&gt; Richard Carver and Paul Hunt, ''National human rights institutions in Africa'', ACDHRS, 1991,&lt;/ref&gt; and children's rights in the Gambia.&lt;ref&gt; Paul Hunt, "Children's rights in West Africa: the case of the Gambia’s Almudos”, HRQ, 1993, 499 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==

Between 1992–2000, Hunt was senior lecturer at the [[University of Waikato]], New Zealand. The focus of his teaching and research was national and international public law, especially human rights. He began to specialise in economic, social and cultural rights and his study, ''Reclaiming Social Rights: International and Comparative Perspectives'', was published in 1996. &lt;ref&gt; Paul Hunt, Reclaiming social rights: international and comparative perspectives, Dartmouth, 1996. &lt;/ref&gt;This was one of the first books published on social rights. Reviewing it in the ''Human Rights Quarterly'', Barbara Stark remarked upon the book’s ambition and concluded, “Hunt succeeds brilliantly” and that the study "dazzles".&lt;ref&gt; Barbara Stark, Book review of ''Reclaiming social rights: international and comparative perspectives'', ''HRQ'', 1999, 547, at 548.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the University of Waikato, Hunt looked at human rights in New Zealand and the South Pacific, including the relationship between culture and rights, as well as the rights of [[indigenous peoples]], which led to scholarship such as ''Culture, Rights and Cultural Rights: Perspectives from the South Pacific'', co-edited with Margaret Wilson. &lt;ref&gt; Paul Hunt and Margaret Wilson (eds.), ''Culture, rights and cultural rights: perspectives from the South Pacific'', Huia, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1996–97, he was a Visiting Fellow at the [[Harvard Law School]] Human Rights Program. In 2000, Hunt, Janet McLean, Bill Mansfield and Peter Cooper were commissioned by New Zealand's Attorney-General to prepare an independent report on the country's national human rights institutions.&lt;ref&gt; Peter Cooper, Paul Hunt, Bill Mansfield and Janet McLean, ''Re-Evaluation of the Human Rights Protections in New Zealand'', Report for the Associate Minister of Justice and Attorney-General, Ministry of Justice, Wellington, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of their recommendations have been implemented by legislative and other reforms.

In 2000, Hunt was appointed Professor of Law at the Human Rights Centre, [[University of Essex]] (UK), a position he still holds. At Essex, his teaching and research focus is national and international human rights, with a particular emphasis on economic, social and cultural rights, as well as human rights and development. He has served as Director of the Human Rights Centre and Chair of the Democratic Audit. Presently, he leads the health-rights work stream of the University's Human Rights, ''Big Data and Technology Project'', funded by the UK's [[Economic and Social Research Council]].

==UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1999–2002)==

In 1998, the New Zealand Government nominated Hunt to serve as an independent expert on the United Nations [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] in Geneva, and he was duly elected by States. He served as the Committee's Rapporteur from 1999 to 2002. During this period, the Committee adopted several influential commentaries, known as General Comments, on economic, social and cultural rights, including on the right to adequate food,&lt;ref&gt; E/C.12/1999/5, 12 May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;right to education,&lt;ref&gt; E/C.12/1999/10, 8 December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; right to the highest attainable standard of health,&lt;ref&gt; E/C.12/2000/4, 11 August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;and right to water.&lt;ref&gt; E/C.12.2002/11, 20 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;It also adopted some statements, including one on poverty and human rights, which broke new ground.&lt;ref&gt;E/C.12/2001/10, 10 May 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; These General Comments and statements have contributed to the growth of literature, and national and international initiatives, on economic, social and cultural rights since the turn of the century.

In light of the Committee's statement on poverty, [[Mary Robinson]], UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, asked Hunt, [[Manfred Nowak]] and Siddiq Osmani to draft detailed and operational guidance on a human rights-based approach to poverty reduction. They responded by writing ''Human Rights and Poverty Reduction: A Conceptual Framework'', &lt;ref&gt; ''Human rights and poverty reduction: a conceptual framework'', OHCHR, 2004. &lt;/ref&gt; followed by ''Draft Guidelines: A Human Rights Approach to Poverty Reduction Strategies'', &lt;ref&gt;''Draft guidelines: a human rights approach to poverty reduction strategies'', OHCHR, 2002. &lt;/ref&gt; both of which were published by the UN [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR). After a period of consultation, OHCHR revised the ''Draft Guidelines'' and they were published as ''Principles and Guidelines for a Human Rights Approach to Poverty Reduction Strategies''.&lt;ref&gt; Principles and guidelines for a human rights approach to poverty reduction strategies, OHCHR, HR/PUB/06/12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==UN Special Rapporteur on the right to the highest attainable standard of health (2002–2008)==

In 2002, Hunt stepped down from the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and was appointed the first UN Special Rapporteur on the right to the highest attainable standard of health ('right to health'). In this independent capacity, he reported, orally and in writing, to the UN [[General Assembly]], UN [[Commission on Human Rights]] and UN [[Human Rights Council]].&lt;ref&gt; UN reports available at https://www1.essex.ac.uk/hrc/practice/health-and-human-rights.aspx and http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Health/Pages/SRRightHealthIndex.aspx For introductions to, and critiques of, Hunt’s work as UN Special Rapporteur, see Paul Hunt and Sheldon Leader, “Developing and applying the right to the highest attainable standard of health: the role of the UN Special Rapporteur (2002–2008), in John Harrington and Maria Stuttaford (eds.), ''Global health and human rights: legal and philosophical perspectives'', Routledge, 2010, 28; Paul Hunt, “Interpreting the international right to health in a human rights-based approach to health,” ''Health and Human Rights'', 18/2, December 2016, 109; Michael Freeman, “The right to health”, in Rhiannon Morgan and Bryan Turner, ''Interpreting human rights: social science perspectives'', Routledge, 2009, 44; and John Tobin, ''The right to health in international law'', OUP, 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;  He submitted thematic reports on a wide range of right to health issues, such as sexual and reproductive health,&lt;ref&gt; E/CN.4/2004/49, 16 February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; neglected diseases,&lt;ref&gt; E/CN.4/2004/49, 16 February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; mental disability,&lt;ref&gt;E/CN.4/2005/51, 11 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; maternal mortality,&lt;ref&gt;A/61/338, 13 September 2006. &lt;/ref&gt;  and the health-rights responsibilities of pharmaceutical companies.&lt;ref&gt;A/63/263, 11 August 2008. &lt;/ref&gt; He also visited, and wrote right to health reports on, countries, including [[India]],&lt;ref&gt;A/HRC/14/20/Add.2, 15 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peru]],&lt;ref&gt;E/CN.4/2005/51/Add.3, 4 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sweden]],&lt;ref&gt; A/HRC/4/28/Add.2, 28 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Uganda]].&lt;ref&gt; E/CN.4/2006/48/Add.2, 19 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt took the unorthodox step of undertaking visits to, and preparing right to health reports on, non-state actors,&lt;ref&gt; Paul Hunt, "The challenge of non-state actors: the experience of the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to the highest attainable standard of health (2002–2008)”, in Aoife Nolan, Rosa Freedman and Therese Murphy (eds.), ''The United Nations Special Procedures System'', Brill Nijhoff, 2017. &lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[World Trade Organization]],&lt;ref&gt; E/CN.4/2004/49/Add.1, 1 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]],&lt;ref&gt;A/HRC/7/11/Add.2, 5 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[GlaxoSmithKline]].&lt;ref&gt;A/HRC/11/12/Add.2, 5 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, he prepared reports with other Rapporteurs on Guantanamo Bay,&lt;ref&gt; E/CN.4/2006/120, 27 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Lebanon/Israel conflict of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;A/HRC/2/7, 2 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Many people wrote to Hunt with alleged violations of their right to health and he took up some of these complaints and subsequently reported to the UN about them.&lt;ref&gt;For example, A/HRC/4/28/Add.1, 23 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
His reports have elicited a wide response, for example, in 2005, Cynthia Rothschild discussed the report on sexual and reproductive health, "Hunt's 2004 report is certainly one of the UN system's most far-reaching documents to incorporate a focus on sexual orientation and gender identity and health".&lt;ref&gt; Cynthia Rothschild, ''Written out: how sexuality is used to attack women’s organizing'', IGLHRC and CWGL, 2005, 117. &lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators called the report “shocking” and Hunt was branded “unprofessional” in the UN Commission on Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;Ibif., 118.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On [[maternal death]] and morbidity, Sandeep Prasad wrote, it "was [Hunt] who first started bringing the human rights dimensions of the issue of maternal mortality to the attention of the [UN Human Rights] Council as a global health and human rights crisis."&lt;ref&gt; Sandeep Prasad, "Enhancing international accountability for maternal mortality and morbidity: the work of civil society at the United Nations Human Rights Council”, in Paul Hunt and Tony Gray (eds.), ''Maternal mortality, human rights and accountability'', Routledge, 2013, 85 at 96. In her Foreword to the same book, Navanethem Pillay, the UN ''High Commissioner for Human Rights'', took the same view: “The work of Paul Hunt … was significant in bringing attention to the human rights implications of maternal mortality and morbidity and placing the issue on the human rights agenda”, xv. &lt;/ref&gt;  Following a press conference in Delhi at the end of his visit to India, during which he focussed on maternal mortality in Rajasthan and Maharashtra, the ''Indian Express'' devoted an editorial to the issue, reflected on Hunt’s findings, and agreed with his conclusion that “the situation does not befit a country of India’s stature and level of development.”&lt;ref&gt; “The janani betrayal: maternal care should prick us far more”, ''Indian Times'', 7 December 2007. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Following Hunt’s report on Peru, Ariel Frisancho Arroyo remarked upon “[t]he key role" played by Hunt in "supporting the health authorities' interest on how to increase the realization of health-rights".&lt;ref&gt; Ariel Frisancho Arroyo, "Looking for more inclusive and sustainable health policies: the role of participation”, in Patricia Cholewka and Mitra Motlagh (eds.), ''Health capital and sustainable socioeconomic development'', CRC Press, 2008, 323 at 338.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his report on Sweden, scholars wrote, “Since Hunt’s report and the resulting [Right to Health Care Initiative], most county councils have issued more generous guiding principles for the health care of local undocumented patients."&lt;ref&gt; Dan Biswas, Brigit Toebes, Anders Hjern and others, "Access to health care for undocumented migrants from a human rights perspective: a comparative study of Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands”, ''Health and Human Rights Journal'', 14/2, August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial, [[''The Lancet'']] commended Hunt's thematic report on the health-rights responsibilities of pharmaceutical companies, as well as his twin report on GlaxoSmithKline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61090-4 |pmid=19524762 |title=Right-to-health responsibilities of pharmaceutical companies |journal=The Lancet |volume=373 |issue=9680 |pages=1998 |year=2009 |last1=The Lancet }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt devoted three UN thematic reports to the methodological problem of how to measure the progressive realisation of the right to health&lt;ref&gt; Discussed in Paul Hunt and Gillian MacNaughton, "A Human Rights-Based Approach to Health Indicators" in Mashood Baderin and Robert McCorquodale, (eds.), Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Action, OUP, 2007, 303.&lt;/ref&gt; and their influence is manifest in the key OHCHR publication ''Human Rights Indicators: A Guide to Measurement and Implementation''.&lt;ref&gt;''Human rights indicators: a guide to measurement and implementation'', OHCHR, 2012, HR/PUB/12/5.&lt;/ref&gt; He drew on several of his UN reports to co-author a major study on health systems and the right to health&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61781-X |pmid=19097280 |title=Health systems and the right to health: An assessment of 194 countries |journal=The Lancet |volume=372 |issue=9655 |pages=2047–2085 |year=2008 |last1=Backman |first1=Gunilla |last2=Hunt |first2=Paul |last3=Khosla |first3=Rajat |last4=Jaramillo-Strouss |first4=Camila |last5=Fikre |first5=Belachew Mekuria |last6=Rumble |first6=Caroline |last7=Pevalin |first7=David |last8=Páez |first8=David Acurio |last9=Pineda |first9=Mónica Armijos |last10=Frisancho |first10=Ariel |last11=Tarco |first11=Duniska |last12=Motlagh |first12=Mitra |last13=Farcasanu |first13=Dana |last14=Vladescu |first14=Cristian |citeseerx=10.1.1.590.2950 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  which was described by ''The Lancet''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61814-0 |pmid=19097274 |title=The right to health: From rhetoric to reality |journal=The Lancet |volume=372 |issue=9655 |pages=2001 |year=2008 |last1=The Lancet }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a “landmark” report.

==Human rights and the World Health Organization==

Hunt’s reports, such as his studies on [[Peru]]&lt;ref&gt;E/CN.4/2005/51/Add.3, 4 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Uganda]],&lt;ref&gt;E/CN.4/2006/48/Add.2, 19 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrate constructive engagement with the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO). In 2008, during his last oral report to the UN [[Human Rights Council]] as Special Rapporteur, Hunt acknowledged this co-operation but also emphasised its limits: “Over the last six years, I have enjoyed excellent cooperation with a number of WHO members of staff on a range of policy and operational issues. For this, I am extremely grateful. However, to the best of my knowledge, neither the World Health Assembly, nor the WHO Executive Board, have ever considered one of my reports. Despite requests, I have never met a WHO Director General since my appointment in 2002.” &lt;ref&gt; UN Human Rights Council, Oral remarks of the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to the highest attainable standard of health, 11 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, between 2011–2013, Hunt was appointed as a part-time Senior Human Rights Advisor to the Assistant Director-General, WHO, Flavia Bustreo, and he directed a project which researched whether there was evidence of impact of a human rights approach to health. This interdisciplinary and multi-author research concluded that applying human rights to women’s and children’s health policies and other interventions “not only helps governments comply with their binding national and international obligations, but also contributes to improving the health of women and children.” &lt;ref&gt;Flavia Bustreo, Paul Hunt, Sofia Gruskin and others, ''Women’s and children’s health: evidence of impact of human rights'', WHO, 2013, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Hunt co-edited a Special Issue of Harvard’s ''Health and Human Rights Journal'' which deepened analysis of this topic.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hunt, Ali Yamin and Flavia Bustreo (guest eds.), ''Evidence of the impact of human rights-based approaches to health'', ''Health and Human Rights Journal'', 17/2, December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In September 2010, Hunt co-organised an international roundtable in [[Geneva]] on maternal mortality, human rights and accountability, and the proceedings were subsequently published.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hunt and Tony Gray (eds.), ''Maternal mortality, human rights and accountability'', Routledge, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In this roundtable, and in a paper he presented at an international conference in Delhi during November 2010, Hunt began to analyse accountability as having three components: monitoring, review and remedy.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hunt, “A three-step accountability process for the UN Secretary-General’s Global Strategy on Women’s and Children’s Health”, presented at, ''From pledges to action, A partners’ forum on women’s and children’s health, organised by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, and The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health, New Delhi, India, 12–14 November 2010, Plenary IV: Holding Ourselves Accountable''.&lt;/ref&gt;  This analysis was novel because, in the context of global health, accountability was usually understood as monitoring and evaluation, without the components of either independent review or remedy.

In 2010–11, Hunt sat on a Working Group of the UN Commission on Information and Accountability on Women’s and Children’s Health (COIA). The Working Group refined Hunt’s conception of accountability in its submission to COIA.&lt;ref&gt;''Working Group on Accountability for Results, Final Report,'' Commission on Information and Accountability for Women’s and Children’s Health, WHO, 2011. http://www.who.int/topics/millennium_development_goals/accountability_commission/Working_Group_on_Results_Final_Paper.pdf?ua=1&lt;/ref&gt; In its final report, ''Keeping Promises, Measuring Results'', COIA adopted this understanding of accountability.&lt;ref&gt;''Keeping promises, measuring results'', Commission on Information and Accountability for Women’s and Children’s Health, WHO, 2011. http://www.who.int/topics/millennium_development_goals/accountability_commission/Commission_Report_advance_copy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This conception of accountability shaped COIA’s recommendations to the UN Secretary-General, [[Ban Ki-moon]], and led to the Secretary-General establishing the independent Expert Review Group on Information and Accountability for Women's and Children's Health (iERG). The iERG sat from 2011 to 2015 and was succeeded by the Independent Accountability Panel which largely shares COIA's understanding of accountability.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''Every Woman Every Child, The Global Strategy for Women's Children's and Adolescents' Health (2016–2030) Survive Thrive Transform'', UN, 2015. http://www.everywomaneverychild.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/EWEC_globalstrategyreport_200915_FINAL_WEB.pdf and Independent Accountability Panel, Old Challenges, New Hopes: Accountability for the Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health, UN, 2016. http://iapreport.org/&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, Julian Schweitzer wrote on the ''British Medical Journal ([[BMJ]])'' that the COIA's "definition of accountability – a cyclical process of monitoring, review, and action … – is now widely accepted in global health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.h4248 |pmid=26371221 |title=Accountability in the 2015 Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health |journal=BMJ |volume=351 |pages=h4248 |year=2015 |last1=Schweitzer |first1=Julian |author2=Expert Consultative Group for Every Women Every Child on Accountability }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hunt was the main architect of this conception of accountability in global health.

==After WHO==
Hunt has recently turned his attention to social rights in the UK. In 2014–15, he sat on the statutory human rights inquiry into emergency health care established by the [[Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;''Human rights inquiry: emergency health care'', Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, 2015. http://www.nihrc.org/uploads/publications/NIHRC_Emergency_Healthcare_Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  He has joined the Board of the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) England initiative, ''Sexual and Reproductive Health Rights, Inclusion and Empowerment'' (SHRINE). He has been appointed a Patron of ''Just Fair'', a London-based think-tank on economic and social rights. With [[Ruth Lister, Baroness Lister of Burtersett]] he has written for the think-tank, ''Compass'', on social rights in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Lister and Paul Hunt, ''To combat right-wing populism, we need to reclaim human rights'', 12 December 2016. https://www.compassonline.org.uk/to-combat-right-wing-populism-we-need-to-reclaim-human-rights-2/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the Centre for Welfare Reform published Hunt's ''Social Rights are Human Rights - but the UK System is Rigged''.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.centreforwelfarereform.org/uploads/attachment/584/social-rights-are-human-rights.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Hunt was appointed by [[Nicola Sturgeon]], First Minister of Scotland, to her Advisory Group on Human Rights Leadership. The Advisory Group is due to report in December 2018. On 2 October 2018, the New Zealand Minister of Justice [[Andrew Little (New Zealand politician)]] announced Hunt's appointment as the Chief Human Rights Commissioner for New Zealand. &lt;ref&gt; https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/new-appointments-human-rights-commission &lt;/ref&gt; He will take up the role of Chief Human Rights Commissioner in January 2019. &lt;ref&gt; https://www.hrc.co.nz/news/appointment-two-new-commissioners-human-rights-commission/ &lt;/ref&gt;

==Other==
Hunt has provided expert testimony to the [[European Court of Human Rights]], via the Centre for Reproductive Rights, and Inter-American Court of Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;''Tysiac v Poland'', ECHR 2007-I, 20 March 2007; ''Artavia Murillo et al ("In Vitro Fertlization") v. Costa Rica'', Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Judgment 28 November 2012; and TGGL and Family v. Ecuador, Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Judgment 1 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999–2000, he sat on the Advisory Panel of the UNDP Human Development Report, Human Rights and Human Development.&lt;ref&gt;http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/reports/261/hdr_2000_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  He was one of the drafters of, and signatories to, the ''Yokyakarta Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity'' in 2006. In 2008, he co-founded the International Initiative on Maternal Mortality and Human Rights. Between 2009–2011, he sat on UNFPA’s External Advisory Panel. Hunt sits on the Editorial Boards of the ''Health and Human Rights Journal'' and ''International Journal on Human Rights and Drug Policy''.

In 2008 Hunt was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Nordic School of Public Health.&lt;ref name="Essex"&gt;{{cite news | title =Professor Paul Hunt  | work =The School of Law | publisher =University of Essex | url = http://www.essex.ac.uk/law/staff/profile.aspx?ID=827 | accessdate = 1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, he gave a TEDx talk, ''Equality – the Road Less Travelled''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TEDx 'Equality – the Road Less Travelled'|url=http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/Equality-the-road-less-travelle;search%3Atag%3A%22english%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this he argues that the realisation of social rights, such as those in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1948), has a major contribution to make towards the enjoyment of substantive equality for all.

'''Pharmacovigilance''' ('''PV''' or '''PhV'''), also known as '''drug safety''', is the [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] [[science]] relating to the ''collection, detection, assessment, monitoring, and prevention'' of [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]] with [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical products]].&lt;ref&gt;Source: The Importance of Pharmacovigilance, WHO 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[etymological]] roots for the word "pharmacovigilance" are: ''pharmakon'' (Greek for drug) and ''vigilare'' (Latin for to keep watch).  As such, pharmacovigilance heavily focuses on [[adverse drug reaction]]s, or ADRs, which are defined as any response to a drug which is noxious and unintended, including lack of efficacy (the condition that this definition only applies with the doses normally used for the [[prophylaxis]], diagnosis or therapy of disease, or for the modification of physiological disorder function was excluded with the latest amendment of the applicable legislation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/files/eudralex/vol-1/dir_2010_84/dir_2010_84_en.pdf |format=PDF |title=DIRECTIVE 2010/84/EU, Article 101 |publisher=ec.europa.eu |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Medication error]]s such as overdose, and misuse and abuse of a drug as well as drug exposure during pregnancy and breastfeeding, are also of interest, even without an adverse event, because they may result in an adverse drug reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.who-umc.org/media/2680/who-technical-report-498.pdf |format=PDF |title=International Drug Monitoring : The Role of National Centers |publisher=Who-umc.org |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information received from patients and healthcare providers via pharmacovigilance agreements (PVAs), as well as other sources such as the [[medical literature]], plays a critical role in providing the data necessary for pharmacovigilance to take place.  In fact, in order to market or to test a pharmaceutical product in most countries, adverse event data received by the license holder (usually a pharmaceutical company) must be submitted to the local drug regulatory authority.  ''(See [[#Adverse event reporting|Adverse event reporting]] below.)''

Ultimately, pharmacovigilance is concerned with identifying the hazards associated with pharmaceutical products and with minimizing the risk of any harm that may come to patients. Companies must conduct a comprehensive drug safety and pharmacovigilance audit to assess their compliance with worldwide laws, regulations, and guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sjpharmaco.com/Preparing%20for%20a%20Pharmacovigilance%20Safety%20Inspection.pdf|title = Preparing for a Safety Inspection|date = 2011|accessdate = 2016-01-04|website = |publisher = Steve Jolley|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms commonly used in drug safety==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
Pharmacovigilance has its own unique terminology that is important to understand.  Most of the following terms are used within this article and are peculiar to drug safety, although some are used by other disciplines within the pharmaceutical sciences as well.

* ''[[Adverse drug reaction]] '' is a side effect (non intended reaction to the drug) occurring with a drug where a positive (direct) causal relationship between the event and the drug is thought, or has been proven, to exist.
* ''[[Adverse event]] (AE)'' is a side effect occurring with a drug.  By definition, the causal relationship between the AE and the drug is unknown.
* ''[[Health benefit (medicine)|Benefits]]'' are commonly expressed as the proven [[therapeutic]] good of a product but should also include the patient's subjective assessment of its effects.
* ''[[Causal relationship]]'' is said to exist when a drug is thought to have caused or contributed to the occurrence of an adverse drug reaction.
* ''[[Clinical trial]]'' (or study) refers to an organised program to determine the safety and/or [[efficacy]] of a drug (or drugs) in patients.  The design of a clinical trial will depend on the drug and the phase of its development.
* ''Control group'' is a group (or cohort) of individual patients that is used as a standard of comparison within a clinical trial.  The control group may be taking a placebo (where no active drug is given) or where a different active drug is given as a comparator.
* ''Dechallenge'' and ''[[rechallenge]]'' refer to a drug being stopped and restarted in a patient, respectively.  A positive dechallenge has occurred, for example, when an adverse event abates or resolves completely following the drug's discontinuation.  A positive rechallenge has occurred when the adverse event re-occurs after the drug is restarted.  Dechallenge and rechallenge play an important role in determining whether a causal relationship between an event and a drug exists.
* ''[[Effectiveness]]'' is the extent to which a drug works under real world circumstances, i.e., clinical practice.
* ''[[Efficacy]]'' is the extent to which a drug works under ideal circumstances, i.e., in clinical trials.
* ''Event'' refers to an adverse event (AE).
* ''[[Harm]]'' is the nature and extent of the actual damage that could be or has been caused.
* ''Implied causality'' refers to spontaneously reported AE cases where the causality is always presumed to be positive unless the reporter states otherwise.  
* ''Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR)'' is an adverse event report for an individual patient.
* ''Life-threatening'' refers to an adverse event that places a patient at the ''immediate'' risk of death.
* ''Phase'' refers to the four [[phases of clinical research]] and development: I – small safety trials early on in a drug's development; II – medium-sized trials for both safety and efficacy; III – large trials, which includes key (or so-called "pivotal") trials; IV – large, post-marketing trials, typically for safety reasons.  There are also intermediate phases designated by an "a" or "b", e.g. Phase IIb.
* ''[[Risk]]'' is the probability of harm being caused, usually expressed as a percent or ratio of the treated population.
* ''[[Risk factor]]'' is an attribute of a patient that may predispose, or increase the risk, of that patient developing an event that may or may not be drug-related.  For instance, obesity is considered a risk factor for a number of different diseases and, potentially, ADRs. Others would be high blood pressure, diabetes, possessing a specific mutated gene, for example, mutations in the [[BRCA1]] and BRCA2 genes increase propensity to develop breast cancer.
* ''Signal'' is a new safety finding within safety data that requires further investigation.  There are three categories of signals: ''confirmed signals'' where the data indicate that there is a causal relationship between the drug and the AE; ''refuted'' (or false) signals where after investigation the data indicate that no causal relationship exists; and ''unconfirmed'' signals which require further investigation (more data) such as the conducting of a post-marketing trial to study the issue.
* ''Temporal relationship'' is said to exist when an adverse event occurs when a patient is taking a given drug.  Although a temporal relationship is absolutely necessary in order to establish a causal relationship between the drug and the AE, a temporal relationship does not necessarily in and of itself prove that the event was caused by the drug.
* ''[[Triage]]'' refers to the process of placing a potential adverse event report into one of three categories: 1) non-serious case; 2) serious case; or 3) no case (minimum criteria for an AE case are not fulfilled).

==Adverse event reporting==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2014}}
The activity that is most commonly associated with pharmacovigilance (PV), and which consumes a significant amount of resources for drug regulatory authorities (or similar government agencies) and drug safety departments in pharmaceutical companies, is that of adverse event reporting.  Adverse event (AE) reporting involves the receipt, triage, data entering, assessment, distribution, reporting (if appropriate), and archiving of AE data and documentation.  The source of AE reports may include: spontaneous reports from healthcare professionals or patients (or other intermediaries); solicited reports from patient support programs; reports from clinical or post-marketing studies; reports from literature sources; reports from the media (including social media and websites); and reports reported to drug regulatory authorities themselves.  For pharmaceutical companies, AE reporting is a regulatory requirement in most countries.  AE reporting also provides data to these companies and drug regulatory authorities that play a key role in assessing the risk-benefit profile of a given drug.  The following are several facets of AE reporting:

===Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR)===
One of the fundamental principles of adverse event reporting is the determination of what constitutes an Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR).  During the triage phase of a potential adverse event report, it is important to determine if the "four elements" of a valid ICSR are present: (1) an identifiable patient, (2) an identifiable reporter, (3) a suspect drug, and (4) an adverse event.

If one or more of these four elements is missing, the case is not a valid ICSR.  Although there are no exceptions to this rule there may be circumstances that may require a judgment call.  For example, the term "identifiable" may not always be clear-cut.  If a physician reports that he/she has a patient X taking drug Y who experienced Z (an AE), but refuses to provide any specifics about patient X, the report is still a valid case even though the patient is not specifically identified.  This is because the reporter has first-hand information about the patient and is ''identifiable'' (i.e. a real person) to the physician.  Identifiability is important so as not only to prevent duplicate reporting of the same case, but also to permit follow-up for additional information.

The concept of identifiability also applies to the other three elements.  Although uncommon, it is not unheard of for fictitious adverse event "cases" to be reported to a company by an anonymous individual (or on behalf of an anonymous patient, disgruntled employee, or former employee) trying to damage the company's reputation or a company's product.  In these and all other situations, the source of the report should be ascertained (if possible).  But anonymous reporting is also important, as whistle blower protection is not granted in all countries. In general, the drug must also be specifically named. Note that in different countries and regions of the world, drugs are sold under various tradenames. In addition, there are a large number of generics which may be mistaken for the trade product. Finally, there is the problem of counterfeit drugs producing adverse events. If at all possible, it is best to try to obtain the sample which induced the adverse event, and send it to either the [[European Medicines Agency|EMA]], FDA or other government agency responsible for investigating AE reports.

If a reporter can't recall the name of the drug they were taking when they experienced an adverse event, this would not be a valid case.  This concept also applies to adverse events.  If a patient states that they experienced "symptoms", but cannot be more specific, such a report might technically be considered valid, but will be of very limited value to the pharmacovigilance department of the company or to drug regulatory authorities.&lt;ref name="Pharmacovigilance p V"&gt;''Current Challenges in Pharmacovigilance: Pragmatic Approaches'' (Report of CIOMS Working Group V), 2001 Geneva.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coding of adverse events===
Adverse event coding is the process by which information from an AE reporter, called the "verbatim", is coded using standardized terminology from a medical coding dictionary, such as [[MedDRA]] (the most commonly used medical coding dictionary).  The purpose of medical coding is to convert adverse event information into terminology that can be readily identified and analyzed.  For instance, Patient 1 may report that they had experienced "a very bad headache that felt like their head was being hit by a hammer" [Verbatim 1] when taking Drug X.  Or, Patient 2 may report that they had experienced a "slight, throbbing headache that occurred daily at about two in the afternoon" [Verbatim 2] while taking Drug Y.  Neither Verbatim 1 nor Verbatim 2 will exactly match a code in the MedDRA coding dictionary.  However, both quotes describe different manifestations of a headache.  As a result, in this example both quotes would be coded as PT Headache (PT = Preferred Term in MedDRA).

===Seriousness determination===
Although somewhat intuitive, there are a set of criteria within pharmacovigilance that are used to distinguish a serious adverse event from a non-serious one.  An adverse event is considered serious if it meets one or more of the following criteria:
#results in death, or is life-threatening; 
#requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
#results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; 
#results in a congenital anomaly (birth defect); or 
#is otherwise "medically significant" (i.e., that it does not meet preceding criteria, but is considered serious because treatment/intervention would be required to prevent one of the preceding criteria.)&lt;ref name="Pharmacovigilance p V"/&gt;

Aside from death, each of these categories is subject to some interpretation.  Life-threatening, as it used in the drug safety world, specifically refers to an adverse event that places the patient at an ''immediate risk of death'', such as cardiac or respiratory arrest.  By this definition, events such as [[myocardial infarction]], which would be hypothetically life-threatening, would not be considered life-threatening unless the patient went into cardiac arrest following the MI.  Defining what constitutes hospitalization can be problematic as well.  Although typically straightforward, it's possible for a hospitalization to occur even if the events being treated are not serious.  By the same token, serious events may be treated without hospitalization, such as the treatment of anaphylaxis may be successfully performed with epinephrine.  Significant disability and incapacity, as a concept, is also subject to debate.  While permanent disability following a stroke would no doubt be serious, would "complete blindness for 30 seconds" be considered "significant disability"?  For birth defects, the seriousness of the event is usually not in dispute so much as the attribution of the event to the drug. Finally, "medically significant events" is a category that includes events that may be always serious, or sometimes serious, but will not fulfill any of the other criteria.  Events such as cancer might always be considered serious, whereas liver disease, depending on its CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) grade—Grades 1 or 2 are generally considered non-serious and Grades 3-5 serious—may be considered non-serious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acrin.org/Portals/0/Administration/Regulatory/CTCAE_4.02_2009-09-15_QuickReference_5x7.pdf |format=PDF |title=Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) : Version 4.0 |publisher=Acrin.org |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expedited reporting===
This refers to ICSRs (individual case safety reports) that involve a serious and unlisted event (an event not described in the drug's labeling) that is considered related to the use of the drug.  (Spontaneous reports are typically considered to have a positive causality, whereas a clinical trial case will typically be assessed for causality by the clinical trial investigator and/or the license holder.) In most countries, the timeframe for reporting expedited cases is 7/15 calendar days from the time a drug company receives notification (referred to as "Day 0") of such a case.  Within clinical trials such a case is referred to as a SUSAR (a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction).  If the SUSAR involves an event that is life-threatening or fatal, it may be subject to a 7-day "clock".  Cases that do not involve a serious, unlisted event may be subject to non-expedited or periodic reporting.

===Clinical trial reporting===
Also known as SAE (serious adverse event) reporting from clinical trials, safety information from clinical studies is used to establish a drug's safety profile in humans and is a key component that drug regulatory authorities consider in the decision-making as to whether to grant or deny market authorization (market approval) for a drug.  SAE reporting occurs as a result of study patients (subjects) who experience serious adverse events during the conducting of clinical trials.  (Non-serious adverse events are also captured separately.)  SAE information, which may also include relevant information from the patient's medical background, are reviewed and assessed for causality by the study investigator.  This information is forwarded to a sponsoring entity (typically a pharmaceutical company) that is responsible for the reporting of this information, as appropriate, to drug regulatory authorities.

===Spontaneous reporting===
Spontaneous reports are termed spontaneous as they take place during the clinician's normal diagnostic appraisal of a patient, when the clinician is drawing the conclusion that the drug may be implicated in the causality of the event.
Spontaneous reporting system relies on vigilant physicians and other healthcare professionals who not only generate a suspicion of an ADR, but also report it. It is an important source of regulatory actions such as taking a drug off the market or a label change due to safety problems.
Spontaneous reporting is the core data-generating system of international pharmacovigilance, relying on healthcare professionals (and in some countries consumers) to identify and report any adverse events to their national pharmacovigilance center, health authority (such as [[European Medicines Agency|EMA]] or FDA), or to the drug manufacturer itself.&lt;ref&gt;Lindquist M. Vigibase, the WHO Global ICSR Database System: Basic Facts. ''Drug Information Journal'', 2008, 42:409-419.&lt;/ref&gt; Spontaneous reports are, by definition, submitted voluntarily although under certain circumstances these reports may be encouraged, or "stimulated", by media reports or articles published in medical or scientific publications, or by product lawsuits. In many parts of the world adverse event reports are submitted electronically using a defined message standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ich.org/cache/compo/475-272-1.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110015452/http://www.ich.org/cache/compo/475-272-1.html |date=November 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://estri.ich.org/new-icsr/index.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823124028/http://estri.ich.org/new-icsr/index.htm |date=August 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major weaknesses of spontaneous reporting is that of under-reporting, where, unlike in clinical trials, less than 100% of those adverse events occurring are reported.  Further complicating the assessment of adverse events, AE reporting behavior varies greatly between countries and in relation to the seriousness of the events, but in general probably less than 10% (some studies suggest less than 5%) of all adverse events that occur are actually reported.  The rule-of-thumb is that on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being least likely to be reported and 10 being the most likely to be reported, an uncomplicated non-serious event such as a mild headache will be closer to a "0" on this scale, whereas a life-threatening or fatal event will be closer to a "10" in terms of its likelihood of being reported.  In view of this, medical personnel may not always see AE reporting as a priority, especially if the symptoms are not serious. And even if the symptoms are serious, the symptoms may not be recognized as a possible side effect of a particular drug or combination thereof. In addition, medical personnel may not feel compelled to report events that are viewed as expected.  This is why reports from patients themselves are of high value. The confirmation of these events by a healthcare professional is typically considered to increase the value of these reports. Hence it is important not only for the patient to report the AE to his health care provider (who may neglect to report the AE), but also report the AE to both the biopharmaceutical company and the FDA, EMA, ... This is especially important when one has obtained one's pharmaceutical from a compounding pharmacy.

As such, spontaneous reports are a crucial element in the worldwide enterprise of pharmacovigilance and form the core of the [[World Health Organization]] Database, which includes around 4.6&amp;nbsp;million reports (January 2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who-umc.org/DynPage.aspx?id=13140&amp;mn=1514 |title=Uppsala Monitoring Centre |publisher=who-umc.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; growing annually by about 250,000.&lt;ref&gt;''Pharmacovigilance''. Mann RD, Andrews EB, eds. John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd, Chichester, 2002.
spontaneous reports are very useful.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aggregate reporting===
Aggregate reporting, also known as periodic reporting, plays a key role in the safety assessment of drugs.  Aggregate reporting involves the compilation of safety data for a drug over a prolonged period of time (months or years), as opposed to single-case reporting which, by definition, involves only individual AE reports.  The advantage of aggregate reporting is that it provides a broader view of the safety profile of a drug.  Worldwide, the most important aggregate report is the Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) and Development Safety Update Report (DSUR).  This is a document that is submitted to drug regulatory agencies in Europe, the US and Japan (ICH countries), as well as other countries around the world.  The PSUR was updated in 2012 and is now referred to in many countries as the Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation report (PBRER).  As the title suggests, the PBRER's focus is on the benefit-risk profile of the drug, which includes a review of relevant safety data compiled for a drug product since its development.

===Other reporting methods===
Some countries legally oblige spontaneous reporting by physicians. In most countries, manufacturers are required to submit, through its [[Qualified Person for Pharmacovigilance]] (QPPV), all of the reports they receive from healthcare providers to the national authority. Others have intensive, focused programmes concentrating on new drugs, or on controversial drugs, or on the prescribing habits of groups of doctors, or involving pharmacists in reporting. All of these generate potentially useful information. Such intensive schemes, however, tend to be the exception.

==Risk management==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2014}}
[[Risk management]] is the discipline within pharmacovigilance that is responsible for signal detection and the monitoring of the risk-benefit profile of drugs.  Other key activities within the area of risk management are that of the compilation of [[risk management plan]]s (RMPs) and aggregate reports such as the Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR), Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER), and the Development Safety Update Report (DSUR).

===Causality assessment===
One of the most important, and challenging, problems in pharmacovigilance is that of the determination of causality.  Causality refers to the relationship of a given adverse event to a specific drug.  Causality determination (or assessment) is often difficult because of the lack of clear-cut or reliable data.  While one may assume that a positive temporal relationship might "prove" a positive causal relationship, this is not always the case.  Indeed, a "bee sting" AE—where the AE can clearly be attributed to a specific cause—is by far the exception rather than the rule.  This is due to the complexity of human physiology as well as that of disease and illnesses.  By this reckoning, in order to determine causality between an adverse event and a drug, one must first exclude the possibility that there were other possible causes or contributing factors. If the patient is on a number of medications, it may be the combination of these drugs which causes the AE, and not any one individually. There have been a number of recent high-profile cases where the AE led to the death of an individual. The individual(s) were not overdosed with any one of the many medications they were taking, but the combination there appeared to cause the AE. Hence it is important to include in your/one's AE report, not only the drug being reported, but also all other drugs the patient was also taking.

For instance, if a patient were to start Drug X and then three days later were to develop an AE, one might be tempted to attribute blame Drug X.  However, before that can be done, the patient's medical history would need to be reviewed to look for possible risk factors for the AE.  In other words, did the AE occur with the drug or ''because'' of the drug?  This is because a patient on any drug may develop or be diagnosed with a condition that could not have possibly been caused by the drug.  This is especially true for diseases, such as cancer, which develop over an extended period of time, being diagnosed in a patient who has been taken a drug for a relatively short period of time.  On the other hand, certain adverse events, such as blood clots (thrombosis), can occur with certain drugs with only short-term exposure.  Nevertheless, the determination of risk factors is an important step of confirming or ruling-out a causal relationship between an event and a drug.

Often the only way to confirm the existence of a causal relationship of an event to a drug is to conduct an observational study where the incidence of the event in a patient population taking the drug is compared to a control group.  This may be necessary to determine if the background incidence of an event is less than that found in a group taking a drug.  If the incidence of an event is statistically significantly higher in the "active" group versus the placebo group (or other control group), it is possible that a causal relationship may exist to a drug, unless other confounding factors may exist.

===Signal detection===
[[Signal detection]] (SD) involves a range of techniques (CIOMS VIII). The WHO defines a safety signal as: "Reported information on a possible causal relationship between an adverse event and a drug, the relationship being unknown or incompletely documented previously". Usually more than a single report is required to generate a signal, depending upon the event and quality of the information available.

Data mining pharmacovigilance databases is one approach that has become increasingly popular with the availability of extensive data sources and inexpensive computing resources. The data sources (databases) may be owned by a pharmaceutical company, a drug regulatory authority, or a large healthcare provider. Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) in these databases are retrieved and converted into structured format, and statistical methods (usually a mathematical algorithm) are applied to calculate statistical measures of association. If the statistical measure crosses an arbitrarily set threshold, a signal is declared for a given drug associated with a given adverse event. All signals deemed worthy of investigation, require further analysis using all available data in an attempt to confirm or refute the signal.  If the analysis is inconclusive, additional data may be needed such as a post-marketing observational trial.

SD is an essential part of drug use and  safety surveillance. Ideally, the goal of SD is to identify ADRs that were previously considered unexpected and to be able to provide guidance in the product's labeling as to how to minimize the risk of using the drug in a given patient population.

===Risk management plans===
A risk management plan (RMP) is a documented plan that describes the risks (adverse drug reactions and potential adverse reactions) associated with the use of a drug and how they are being handled (warning on drug label or on packet inserts of possible side effects which if observed should cause the patient to inform/see his physician and/or pharmacist and/or the manufacturer of the drug and/or the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]], [[European Medicines Agency|EMA)]]).  The overall goal of an RMP is to assure a positive risk-benefit profile once the drug is (has been) marketed.  The document is required to be submitted, in a specified format, with all new market authorization requests within the [[European Union]] (EU).  Although not necessarily required, RMPs may also be submitted in countries outside the EU.  The risks described in an RMP fall into one of three categories: identified risks, potential risks, and unknown risks.  Also described within an RMP are the measures that the Market Authorization Holder, usually a pharmaceutical company, will undertake to minimize the risks associated with the use of the drug.  These measures are usually focused on the product's labeling and healthcare professionals.  Indeed, the risks that are documented in a pre-authorization RMP will inevitably become part of the product's post-marketing labeling.  Since a drug, once authorized, may be used in ways not originally studied in clinical trials, this potential "[[off-label use]]", and its associated risks, is also described within the RMP.  RMPs can be very lengthy documents, running in some cases hundreds of pages and, in rare instances, up to a thousand pages long.

In the US, under certain circumstances, the FDA may require a company to submit a document called a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) for a drug that has a specific risk that FDA believes requires mitigation.  While not as comprehensive as an RMP, a REMS can require a sponsor to perform certain activities or to follow a protocol, referred to as Elements to Assure Safe Use (ETASU),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ireminder.com/products/medtrigger |title=(REMS)Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategies and ETASU programs |publisher=Ireminder.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; to assure that a positive risk-benefit profile for the drug is maintained for the circumstances under which the product is marketed.

===Risk/benefit profile of drugs===
Pharmaceutical companies are required by law in most countries to perform [[clinical trials]], testing new drugs on people before they are made generally available.  This occurs after a drug has been pre-screened for toxicity, sometimes using animals for testing.  The manufacturers or their agents usually select a representative sample of patients for whom the drug is designed – at most a few thousand – along with a comparable control group. The control group may receive a placebo and/or another drug, often a so-called "gold standard" that is "best" drug marketed for the disease.

The purpose of clinical trials is to determine:
* if a drug works and how well it works
* if it has any harmful effects, and
* if it does more good than harm, and how much more? If it has a potential for harm, how probable and how serious is the harm?

Clinical trials do, in general, tell a good deal about how well a drug works. They provide information that should be reliable for larger populations with the same characteristics as the trial group – age, gender, state of health, ethnic origin, and so on though target clinical populations are typically very different from trial populations with respect to such characteristics{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}.

The variables in a clinical trial are specified and controlled, but a clinical trial can never tell you the whole story of the effects of a drug in all situations. In fact, nothing could tell you the whole story, but a clinical trial must tell you enough; "enough" being determined by legislation and by contemporary judgements about the acceptable balance of benefit and harm.  Ultimately, when a drug is marketed it may be used in patient populations that were not studied during clinical trials (children, the elderly, pregnant women, patients with co-morbidities not found in the clinical trial population, etc.) and a different set of warnings, precautions or contraindications (where the drug should not be used at all) for the product's labeling may be necessary in order to maintain a positive risk/benefit profile in all known populations using the drug.

===Pharmacoepidemiology===
{{expand section|date=March 2014}}
[[Pharmacoepidemiology]] is the study of the incidence of adverse drug reactions in patient populations using drug agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strom|first=Brian|title=Textbook of Pharmacoepidemiology|year=2006|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=West Sussex, England|isbn=978-0-470-02925-1|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics===
Although often used interchangeably, there are subtle differences between the two disciplines.  [[Pharmacogenetics]] is generally regarded as the study or clinical testing of genetic variation that gives rise to differing responses to drugs, including adverse drug reactions.  It is hoped that pharmacogenetics will eventually provide information as to which genetic profiles in patients will place those patients at greatest risk, or provide the greatest benefit, for using a particular drug or drugs.  [[Pharmacogenomics]], on the other hand, is the broader application of genomic technologies to new drug discovery and further characterization of older drugs.

==International collaboration==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2014}}
The following organizations play a key collaborative role in the global oversight of pharmacovigilance.

===The World Health Organization (WHO)===
The principle of international collaboration in the field of pharmacovigilance is the basis for the WHO Programme for International Drug Monitoring, through which over 150 member nations have systems in place that encourage healthcare personnel to record and report adverse effects of drugs in their patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.who-umc.org/global-pharmacovigilance/who-programme|title=UMC - WHO Programme|website=www.who-umc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reports are assessed locally and may lead to action within the country. Since 1978, the programme has been managed by the [[Uppsala Monitoring Centre]] to which member countries send their reports to be processed, evaluated and entered into an international database called [[VigiBase]].

===The International Council for Harmonisation (ICH)===
The ICH is a global organization with members from the European Union, the United States and Japan; its goal is to recommend global standards for drug companies and drug regulatory authorities around the world, with the ICH Steering Committee (SC) overseeing harmonization activities. Established in 1990, each of its six co-sponsors—the EU, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW), the Japanese Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (JPMA), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA)—have two seats on the SC. Other parties have a significant interest in ICH and have been invited to nominate Observers to the SC; three current observers{{when|date=March 2014}} are the WHO, [[Health Canada]], and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA), with the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (IFPMA) participating as a non-voting member of the SC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ich.org/about/organisation-of-ich.html |title=Organisation |publisher=ICH |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ich.org/about/organisation-of-ich/steering.html |title=Steering Committee |publisher=ICH |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227142309/http://www.ich.org/about/organisation-of-ich/steering.html |archivedate=2015-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Council for International Organizations of Medical Science (CIOMS)===
The CIOMS, a part of the WHO, is a globally oriented [[think tank]] that provides guidance on drug safety related topics through its Working Groups.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The CIOMS prepares reports that are used as a reference for developing future drug regulatory policy and procedures, and over the years, many of CIOMS' proposed policies have been adopted.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}  Examples of topics these reports have covered include: Current Challenges in Pharmacovigilance: Pragmatic Approaches (CIOMS V); Management of Safety Information from Clinical Trials (CIOMS VI); the Development Safety Update Report (DSUR): Harmonizing the Format and Content for Periodic Safety Reporting During Clinical Trials (CIOMS VII); and Practical Aspects of Signal Detection in Pharmacovigilance: Report of CIOMS Working Group (CIOMS VIII).{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===The International Society of Pharmacovigilance (ISoP)===
The ISoP is an international non-profit scientific organization, which aims to foster pharmacovigilance both scientifically and educationally, and enhance all aspects of the safe and proper use of medicines, in all countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isoponline.org/ |title=ISoP : International Society of Pharmacovigilance - Home |publisher=Isoponline.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 1992 as the European Society of Pharmacovigilance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js4893e/3.html |title=The Importance of Pharmacovigilance - Safety Monitoring of Medicinal Products: Chapter 2 - A Short History of Involvement in Drug Safety Monitoring by WHO |publisher=Apps.who.int |date=2015-02-10 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory authorities==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2014}}
Drug regulatory authorities play a key role in national or regional oversight of pharmacovigilance. Some of the agencies involved are listed below (in order of 2011 spending on pharmaceuticals, from the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics).&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2012/07/12/the-global-drug-market-will-swell-to-1-2-trillion-while-big-pharma-treads-water/ |title=Why Big Pharma Won't Get Its Piece Of The $1.2 Trillion Global Drug Market |publisher=Forbes |date=2012-12-07 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{See also|Regulation of therapeutic goods in the United States}}
In the U.S., with about a third of all global 2011 pharmaceutical expenditures,&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt; the drug industry is regulated by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]], the largest national drug regulatory authority in the world.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} FDA authority is exercised through enforcement of regulations derived from legislation, as published in the U.S. [[Code of Federal Regulations]] (CFR); the principal drug safety regulations are found in 21 CFR Part 312 (IND regulations) and 21 CFR Part 314 (NDA regulations).{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}  While those regulatory efforts address pre-marketing concerns,  pharmaceutical manufacturers and academic/non-profit organizations such as [[Research on Adverse Drug events And Reports|RADAR]] and [[Public Citizen]] do play a role in pharmacovigilance in the US.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The post-legislative rule-making process of the U.S. federal government provides for significant input from both the legislative and executive branches, which also play specific, distinct roles in determining FDA policy.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Emerging economies (including Latin America)===
The "pharmerging", or emerging pharmaceutical market economies, which include Brazil, India, Russia, Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia, Mexico, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and Vietnam, accrued one fifth of global 2011 pharmaceutical expenditures; in future, aggregated data for this set will include China as well.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;

China's economy is anticipated to pass Japan to become second in the ranking of individual countries' in pharmaceutical purchases by 2015, and so its PV regulation will become increasing important; China's regulation of PV is through its National Center for Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) Monitoring, under China's Ministry of Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clinicalleader.com/doc/chinas-pharmacovigilance-system-the-hunger-0001 |title=China's Pharmacovigilance System: The Hunger For Safety Insights |publisher=Clinicalleader.com |date=2011-12-07 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As JE Sackman notes, as of April 2013 "there is no Latin American equivalent of the European Medicines Agency—no common body with the power to facilitate greater consistency across countries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biopharminternational.com/biopharm/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=810540&amp;sk=&amp;date=&amp;pageID=3 |title=Navigating Emerging Markets — Latin America |publisher=Biopharminternational.com |date=2013-04-01 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; For simplicity, and per sources, 17 smaller economies are discussed alongside the 4 pharmemerging large economies of Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Venzuala—Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, and Uruguay.&lt;ref name="vigilance2012"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hoffmann E, Fouretier A, Vergne C, etal |title=Pharmacovigilance Regulatory Requirements in Latin America |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03262389|journal=Pharm Med |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=153–164 |year=2012 |doi=10.1007/bf03262389}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2012, 16 of this total of 21 countries have systems for immediate reporting and 9 have systems for periodic reporting of adverse events for on-market agents, while 10 and 8, respectively, have systems for immediate and periodic reporting of adverse events during clinical trials; most of these have PV requirements that rank as "high or medium...in line with international standards" (''ibid.''). The WHO's Pan American Network for Drug Regulatory Harmonization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=1156&amp;Itemid=513 |title=Pan American Network for Drug Regulatory Harmonization |publisher=Paho.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeks to assist Latin American countries in develop harmonized PV regulations.&lt;ref name="vigilance2012"/&gt;

Some further PV regulatory examples from the pharmerging nations are as follows. In India, the PV regulatory authority is the Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission, with a National Coordination Centre under the Pharmacovigilance Program of India, in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipc.gov.in |title=Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission, Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare, Government of India |publisher=Ipc.gov.in |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdsco.nic.in |title=Central Drugs Standard Control Organization |publisher=Cdsco.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists working on pharmacovigilance share their experiences, findings, innovative ideas and researches during the annual meeting of [[Society of Pharmacovigilance, India]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} In Egypt, PV is regulated by the Egyptian Pharmacovigilance Center of the Egyptian Ministry of Health.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===European Union===
The EU5 (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom) accrued ~17% of global 2011 pharmaceutical expenditures.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt; PV efforts in the EU are coordinated by the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) and are conducted by the national competent authorities (NCAs).{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The main responsibility of the EMA is to maintain and develop the pharmacovigilance database consisting of all suspected serious adverse reactions to medicines observed in the [[European Community]]; the  data processing network and management system is called [[EudraVigilance]] and contains separate but similar databases of human and veterinary reactions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/special_topics/general/general_content_000456.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac05801ae8fb "Safety monitoring of medicines"] European Medicines Agency&lt;/ref&gt; The EMA requires the individual marketing authorization holders to submit all received adverse reactions in electronic form, except in exceptional circumstances; the reporting obligations of the various stakeholders are defined by EEC legislation, namely [[Regulation]] (EC) No 726/2004, and for human medicines, [[European Union]] [[Directive 2001/83/EC]] as amended and [[Directive 2001/20/EC]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}  In 2002, Heads of Medicines Agencies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heads.medagencies.org/ |title=Heads of Medicines Agencies: Home |publisher=Heads.medagencies.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; agreed on a mandate for an ad hoc Working Group on establishing a European risk management strategy; the Working Group considered the conduct of a high level survey of EU pharmacovigilance resources to promote the utilization of expertise and encourage collaborative working.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In conjunction with this oversight, individual countries maintain their distinct regulatory agencies with PV responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bnds.fr/revue/rgdm/panorama-de-droit-pharmaceutique-2015/pharmacovigilance-europeenne-un-systeme-aux-multiples-visages-6101.html|title=Pharmacovigilance européenne, un système aux multiples visages|last=GUERRIAUD|first=Mathieu|date=2016-02-01|website=BNDS|language=fr-FR|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, in Spain, PV is regulated by the Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios (AEMPS), a legal entity that retains the right to suspend or withdraw the authorization of pharmaceuticals already on-market if the evidence shows that safety (or quality or efficacy) of an agent are unsatisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://se-fc.org/gestor/farmacovigilancia/generalidades.html |title=Generalidades |publisher=Se-fc.org |accessdate=2015-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227141047/http://se-fc.org/gestor/farmacovigilancia/generalidades.html |archivedate=2015-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rest of Europe, including non-EU===
{{expand section|date=March 2014}}
The remaining EU and non-EU countries outside the EU5 accrued ~7% of global 2011 pharmaceutical expenditures.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt; Regulation of those outside the EU being managed by specific governmental agencies.  For instance, in Switzerland, PV "inspections" for clinical trials of medicinal products are conducted by the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.swissmedic.ch/bewilligungen/00155/00242/00327/00345/index.html?lang=en |title=GCP and Pharmacovigilance Inspections - Swissmedic |publisher=Swissmedic.ch |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, with ~12% of all global 2011 pharmaceutical expenditures,&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt; PV matters are regulated by the [[Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency]] (PMDA) and the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare [[MHLW]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Canada===
{{expand section|date=March 2014}}
In Canada, with ~2% of all global 2006 and 2011 pharmaceutical expenditures,&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt; PV is regulated by the Marketed Health Products Directorate of the Health Products and Food Branch(MHPD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/corporate/about-health-canada/branches-agencies/health-products-food-branch.html |title=Health Products and Food Branch|publisher= Government of Canada |date= 2018-06-25 |accessdate= 2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Canada was second, following the United States, in holding the highest total prescription drug expenditures per capita in 2011 at around 750 US dollars per person. Canada also pays such a large amount for pharmaceuticals that it was second, next to Switzerland, for the amount of money spent for a certain amount of prescription drugs (around 130 US dollars). It was also accessed that Canada was one of the top countries that increased its yearly average per capita growth on pharmaceutical expenditures the most from 2000-2010 with 4 percent a year (with taking inflation into account) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gagnon |first1= Marc-André |date= 2014-6|title= A Roadmap to a Rational Pharmacare Policy |url= https://nursesunions.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Pharmacare_FINAL.pdf|journal= The Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions|volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date= }} &lt;/ref&gt; The MHPD mainly collects adverse drug reaction reports through a network of reporting centers to analyze and issue possible warnings to the public, and currently utilizes newsletters, advisories, adverse reaction centers, as well as electronic mailing lists. However, it does not currently maintain a database or list of drugs removed from Canada as a result of safety concerns. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lexchin |first1= Joel |date= 2005|title= Drug withdrawls from the Canadian Market for safety reasons. |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC552890/|journal= Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume= 172|issue= |pages= 765-767
|doi= |access-date= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

In August of 2017, there was a government controversy in which a bill, known as “Vanessa’s Law”, to protect patients from potentially dangerous prescription drugs was not being fully realized by hospitals; Health Canada only required hospitals to report “unexpected” negative reactions to prescription drugs, rather than any and all adverse reactions, with the justification of managing “administrative overload”.[25]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/3680977/vanessas-law-health-canada-gutting-drug-safety/ |title=Opposition stands behind former MP accusing Health Canada of gutting drug safety law. |last= Minsky |first= Amy |publisher= Global News |date= 2017-08-18 |accessdate= 2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacoenvironmentology; (Ecopharmacovigilance [EPV])==
Despite attention from the FDA and regulatory agencies of the European Union, procedures for monitoring drug concentrations and adverse effects in the environment are lacking.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Pharmaceuticals, their metabolites, and related substances may enter the environment after patient excretion, after direct release to waste streams during manufacturing or administration, or via terrestrial deposits (e.g., from waste sludges or leachates).&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Implementing Ecopharmacovigilance in Practice: Challenges and Potential Opportunities |date= |pmc=3691479 |pmid=23620169 |doi=10.1007/s40264-013-0049-3 |volume=36 |year=2013 |journal=Drug Saf |pages=533–46 | last1 = Holm | first1 = G | last2 = Snape | first2 = JR | last3 = Murray-Smith | first3 = R | last4 = Talbot | first4 = J | last5 = Taylor | first5 = D | last6 = Sörme | first6 = P}}&lt;/ref&gt; A concept combining pharmacovigilance and environmental pharmacology, intended to focus attention on this area, was introduced first as ''pharmacoenvironmentology'' in 2006 by [[Syed Ziaur Rahman]] and later as ''ecopharmacology'' with further concurrent and later terms for the same concept (ecopharmacovigilance [EPV], environmental pharmacology, ecopharmacostewardship).&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url= http://www.ijp-online.com/text.asp?2006/38/4/229/27017 | doi=10.4103/0253-7613.27017 | last=Rahman| first=SZ| last2=Khan| first2=RA| title= Environmental pharmacology: A new discipline | journal= Indian J.

The first of these routes to the environment, elimination through living organisms subsequent to pharmacotherapy, is suggested as the principal source of environmental contamination (apart from cases where norms for treatment of manufacturing and other wastes are violated), and EPV is intended to deal specifically with this impact of pharmacological agents on the environment.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.ehjournal.net/content/6/1/20 | doi= 10.1186/1476-069X-6-20| last=Rahman| first=SZ| last2= Khan | first2=RA| last3=Gupta| first3=V| last4= Uddin | first4=Misbah| title= Pharmacoenvironmentology – A Component of Pharmacovigilance | journal= Environmental Health |date=July 2007| volume=6| issue=20 | pages= | pmid= 17650313  | pmc=1947975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activities of EPV have been suggested to include:
*Increasing, generally, the availability of environmental data on medicinal products;
*Tracking emerging data on environmental exposure, effects and risks after product launch;
*Using Environmental Risk Management Plans (ERMPs) to manage risk throughout a drug's life cycle;
*Following risk identification, promoting further research and environmental monitoring, and
*In general, promoting a global perspective on EPV issues.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

==Related to medical devices==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2014}}
A [[medical device]] is an instrument, apparatus, implant, ''in vitro'' reagent, or similar or related article that is used to diagnose, prevent, or treat disease or other conditions, and does not achieve its purposes through chemical action within or on the body (which would make it a [[drug]]).  Whereas medicinal products (also called pharmaceuticals) achieve their principal action by pharmacological, metabolic or immunological means, medical devices act by physical, mechanical, or thermal means.  Medical devices vary greatly in complexity and application.  Examples range from simple devices such as [[tongue depressors]], medical [[thermometers]], and disposable gloves to advanced devices such as [[medical robots]], [[cardiac pacemakers]], and [[neuroprosthetics]].

Given the inherent difference between medicinal products and medical products, the vigilance of medical devices is also different from that of medicinal products.  To reflect this difference, a classification system has been adopted in some countries to stratify the risk of failure with the different classes of devices.  The classes of devices typically run on a 1-3 or 1-4 scale, with Class 1 being the least likely to cause significant harm with device failure versus Classes 3 or 4 being the most likely to cause significant harm with device failure.  An example of a device in the "low risk" category would be contact lenses.  An example of a device in the "high risk" category would be cardiac pacemakers.

Medical device reporting (MDR), which is the reporting of adverse events with medical devices, is similar to that with medicinal products, although there are differences.  For instance, in the US user-facilities such as hospitals and nursing homes are legally required to report suspected medical device-related deaths to both FDA and the manufacturer, if known, and serious injuries to the manufacturer or to FDA, if the manufacturer is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/ucm085568.htm |title=Reporting By Health Professionals |publisher=Fda.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is in contrast to the voluntary reporting of AEs with medicinal products.

'''Pitchcapping''' was a form of [[torture]] used by the British military against suspected Irish rebels during the period of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 rebellion]], most famously on [[Anthony Perry]], one of the leaders of the Wexford Rebels.

== Process ==
The process involved pouring hot [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]], or [[tar]] (mainly used at the time for lighting purposes), into a conical shaped paper "cap", which was forced onto a bound suspect's head, allowed to cool, then rapidly removed, taking with it a portion of the suspect's skin and tissue. Less elaborate versions included smearing a cloth or piece of paper with pitch and pressing onto the head of the intended victim such as described by [[Myles Byrne]]* [https://archive.org/stream/memoirsofmilesby01byrniala/memoirsofmilesby01byrniala_djvu.txt] in his memoirs.

"''Flogging, half hanging, picketing, were mild tortures in comparison of the pitch caps that were applied to the heads of those who happened to wear their hair short, called croppies; the head being completely singed, a cap made of strong linen well imbued with boiling pitch was so closely put on that it could not be taken off without bringing off a part of the skin and flesh from the head : in many instances the tortured victim had one of his ears cut off to satisfy the executioner that if he escaped he could readily be discovered, being so well marked.'' "&lt;ref&gt;Memoirs of Miles Byrne&lt;/ref&gt;

The torture was usually preceded by the crude shearing of the victim's hair/scalp. The effect on the skull of this controlled form of local boiling somewhat resembles [[scalping]], earlier known as a practice used by the colonists in [[North America]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] on each other.
Pitch has long, even in antiquity, been used (like other hot liquids, even melted metal) to pour into a victim's orifices. However, both those techniques were usually faster and often lethal, so less suitable as torture proper, rather as [[capital punishment]].

The '''seven collegiate churches of Liège''' ({{lang-fr|sept collégiales de Liège}}) were a group of 10th- and early-11th-century foundations in the city of [[Liège]]. Each of these [[collegiate church]]es was a privileged corporation within the city, with its own precincts and rights, while until the [[Liège Revolution]] of 1789 the [[canon (priest)|canons]] collectively had a key corporate status in the [[First Estate]] of the [[prince-bishopric of Liège]] as the "secondary clergy", alongside the "primary clergy" belonging to the [[chapter (religion)|chapter]] of [[Saint Lambert's Cathedral, Liège|Saint Lambert's Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Saucier, ''A Paradise of Priests: Singing the Civic and Episcopal Hagiography of Medieval Liège'' (University of Rochester Press, 2014), pp. 137, 147-153.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 18th century, each of the collegiate chapters had 30 canons, all of whom were required to be graduates in Theology or Canon Law. Each chapter had its own [[provost (religion)|provost]], [[dean (Christianity)|dean]], [[Cantor (Christianity)#Roman Catholicism|cantor]], [[scholaster]] and [[Church treasure|treasurer]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Louis and Giraud Richard, ''Dictionnaire universel'', vol. 3 (Paris, 1760), p. 624.&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven churches were:

The '''Slovak National Party''' ({{lang-sk|Slovenská národná strana}}, SNS) is a [[Nationalism|nationalist]]&lt;ref name="Nordsieck"/&gt; [[List of political parties in Slovakia|political party]] in [[Slovakia]]. The party characterizes itself as a nationalist party based on both social and the European [[Christian values]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sns.sk/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=177 Stručne o SNS].  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120911174947/http://www.sns.sk/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=177 |date=11 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1990 SNS has won seats in every [[National Council of the Slovak Republic|Slovak parliament]] but two (in [[Slovak parliamentary election, 2002|2002]] and 2012) and has been part of the government from 2006 to 2010. In that year it formed a coalition with [[Robert Fico]]'s [[Direction – Social Democracy]] (Smer-SD), which resulted in suspension of Smer-SD from the [[Party of European Socialists]] (PES). The PES considered SNS a "political party which incites or attempts to stir up racial or ethnic prejudices and racial hatred."&lt;ref name="pes.org"&gt;[http://www.pes.org/content/view/721/90 SMER suspended from PES political family] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20061014155725/http://www.pes.org/content/view/721/90 |date=14 October 2006 }}, [[Party of European Socialists]], 12 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2008 Smer's membership suspension ended with no further PES's demands regarding SNS.&lt;ref name="higbeam"&gt;{{cite web|title=PES REHABILITATES FICO'S SMER PARTY. (Party of European Socialists meeting) |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-175158004.html |date=22 February 2008 |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Slovak parliamentary election, 2012|2012 parliamentary election]], SNS failed to meet the 5% electoral threshold and thus lost parliamentary representation. At the following party congress in October 2012, the delegates chose lawyer Andrej Danko as the new chairman of the party.&lt;ref name="hn.hnonline.sk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hn.hnonline.sk/slovensko-119/z-politiky-neodchadzam-tvrdi-slota-521417|title=Z politiky neodchádzam, tvrdí Slota|work=HNonline.sk|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The party was founded in December 1989 and perceives itself as an ideological heir to the historical [[Slovak National Party (historical)|Slovak National Party]]. The party declares its three pillars: Christian, national and social. One of the biggest events the SNS has participated in since then was the establishment of an independent [[Slovakia]] on 1 January 1993. The SNS has had deputies in the Slovak parliament in the years 1990–2002 and 2006-2012. The party also had deputies in the Slovak government. [[Marián Andel]], [[Jozef Prokeš]], [[Jaroslav Paška]] and [[Ľudovít Černák]] were in the second [[Vladimír Mečiar|Mečiar]] government (1992–1994), [[Ján Sitek]] and [[Eva Slavkovská]] in the third Mečiar government (1994–1998) and other deputies were in the government of [[Robert Fico]] from 2006–2010 (see below).

Between 2001 and 2005 there was a [[Real Slovak National Party]] (''Pravá slovenská národná strana'', PSNS), a party of SNS splinters, which remerged with SNS later. Since 2005, there is also a '''United Slovak National Party''' (''Zjednotená slovenská národná strana'', ZSNS), also formed of former SNS members. In February 2006, PSNS changed its name into the '''Slovak National Coalition – Slovak Mutuality''' (''Slovenská národná koalícia – Slovenská vzájomnosť''). However, only the Slovak National Party is currently relevant.

In 2008 a €120&amp;nbsp;million tender for establishing the rules and guidelines and logos for distribution of funds from the European Union, was won by a consortium of firms with close ties to SNS leader [[Ján Slota]]. The tender notice had been posted for only five days on a bulletin board in the ministry run by the SNS party behind a locked door, which resulted in a single bid. Following the scandal, the SNS minister in charge of the contract was fired, and the European Commission has launched an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://businessneweurope.eu/story1652/By_hook_or_crook_Slovakian_EU_funds_find_their_way_to_govt_supporters |title=By hook or crook, Slovak EU funds find their way to govt supporters |publisher=Businessneweurope.eu |date=18 June 2009 |accessdate=10 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120707102927/http://businessneweurope.eu/story1652/By_hook_or_crook_Slovakian_EU_funds_find_their_way_to_govt_supporters |archivedate=7 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 SNS proposed law to create barriers for women seeking abortion in Slovakia.&lt;ref name="ips"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=47387 |title=HUMAN RIGHTS-SLOVAKIA: Barriers Go Up For Abortion |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date=26 June 2009 |accessdate=10 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104192424/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=47387 |archivedate=4 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006–2010: In Slovak government===
SNS entered the current Slovak government after Chairman [[Ján Slota]] and [[Robert Fico]] agreed to create a coalition government. This created an unusual situation of an alleged far-right party, SNS being accepted and taken as a partner by [[SMER]], a party describing itself as leftist. Three SNS ministers were sworn in on 4 July 2006:
{{Politics of Slovakia}}

*[[Jaroslav Izák]] as the minister of the environment. Jaroslav Izák was fired from the Environment Ministry top job in the wake of accusations of cronyism, He was succeeded by [[Ján Chrbet]].&lt;ref name="spectator1" /&gt;
*[[Ján Mikolaj]] as deputy prime minister; minister of education.
*[[Marián Janušek]] as the minister of construction and regional development. Janušek was sacked from the Ministry's top job for "granting lucrative contracts worth €98&amp;nbsp;million to two firms, Avocat and Zamedia, which are believed to have links to SNS chairman Ján Slota."&lt;ref name="spectator1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Beata Balogová |url=http://www.spectator.sk/articles/view/36352/11/people_often_get_what_they_want_not_what_they_need.html |title=People often get what they want, not what they need – The Slovak Spectator |publisher=Spectator.sk |accessdate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further ministers, delegated by SNS:
*[[Ján Chrbet]] as Minister of Environment, after Izák. His firing was over his responsibility in a mega-scandal involving the sale of the country's excess emission quotas at an extremely low price, below their market value.&lt;ref name="spectator1" /&gt;
*[[Viliam Turský]] as Minister of Environment following Chrbet. Also fired by Fico over a dubious contract he signed with a company. After three SNS Ministers were fired from the same ministry, Fico took away control of the ministry from SNS.&lt;ref name="spectator1" /&gt;

=== 2016 election ===
In the [[Slovak parliamentary election, 2016|2016 Slovak parliamentary election]], the Slovak National Party won 8.64% of the vote, and joined [[Fico's Third Cabinet]] on March 22.

===Allegations of fascism===
In the past, the SNS party was accused of being a fascist party.

From the members of the [[Moscow Helsinki Group]], 1978 saw its members [[Yuri Orlov]], [[Vladimir Slepak]] and [[Anatoly Shcharansky]] sentenced to lengthy labor camp terms and internal exile for "[[Anti-Soviet agitation|anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda]]" and treason.

== Currents of dissidence ==

=== Civil and human rights movement ===
{{Main|Human rights movement in the Soviet Union}}Starting in the 1960s, the early years of the [[Era of Stagnation|Brezhnev stagnation]], dissidents in the Soviet Union increasingly turned their attention towards civil and eventually human rights concerns. The fight for civil and human rights focused on issues of [[Censorship in the Soviet Union|freedom of expression]], [[Persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union|freedom of conscience]], [[Refusenik|freedom to emigrate]], [[Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union|punitive psychiatry]], and the plight of [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|political prisoners]]. It was characterized by a new openness of dissent, a concern for legality, the rejection of any 'underground' and violent struggle.&lt;ref name="daniel-istoki2"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Daniel, Alexander|title=Истоки и корни диссидентской активности в СССР|trans-title=Sources and roots of dissident activity in the USSR|journal=Неприкосновенный запас [Emergency Ration]|date=2002|volume=1|issue=21|url=http://magazines.russ.ru/nz/2002/21/dan.html|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1960s-1980s, those active in the civil and human rights movement engaged in a variety of activities: The documentation of political repression and rights violations in [[samizdat]] (unsanctioned press); individual and collective protest letters and petitions; unsanctioned demonstrations; mutual aid for prisoners of conscience; and, most prominently, civic watch groups appealing to the international community. Repercussions for these activities ranged from dismissal from work and studies to many years of imprisonment in [[labor camp]]s and being subjected to [[Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union|punitive psychiatry]].

Dissidents active in the movement in the 1960s introduced a "legalist" approach of avoiding moral and political commentary in favor of close attention to legal and procedural issues. Following several landmark political trials, coverage of arrests and trials in samizdat became more common. This activity eventually led to the founding of the ''[[Chronicle of Current Events]]'' in April 1968. The unofficial newsletter reported violations of civil rights and judicial procedure by the Soviet government and responses to those violations by citizens across the USSR.&lt;ref name="horvath-legacy"&gt;{{cite book|author=Horvath, Robert|title=The legacy of Soviet dissent: dissidents, democratisation and radical nationalism in Russia|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=London &amp; New York|isbn=978-0415333207|pages=70–129|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HONoAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, the rights-based strategy of dissent incorporated human rights ideas and rhetoric. The movement included figures such as [[Valery Chalidze]], [[Yuri Orlov]], and [[Lyudmila Alexeyeva]]. Special groups were founded such as the [[Initiative Group for the Defense of Human Rights in the USSR]] (1969) and the [[Committee on Human Rights in the USSR]] (1970). The signing of the [[Helsinki Accords]] (1975) containing human rights clauses provided rights campaigners with a new hope to use international instruments. This led to the creation of dedicated [[Helsinki Watch Group]]s in Moscow ([[Moscow Helsinki Group]]), Kiev ([[Ukrainian Helsinki Group]]), Vilnius ([[Lithuanian Helsinki Group]]), Tbilisi, and Erevan (1976–77).&lt;ref name="thomas-helsinki"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas, Daniel|title=The Helsinki effect: international norms, human rights, and the demise of communism|publisher=Princeton University Press|date=2001|isbn=978-0691048581|location=Princeton, N.J}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|159–194}}

The civil and human rights initiatives played a significant role in providing a common language for Soviet dissidents with varying concerns, and became a common cause for social groups in the dissident milieu ranging from activists in the youth subculture to academics such as [[Andrei Sakharov]]. Due to the contacts with Western journalists as well as the political focus during détente ([[Helsinki Accords]]), those active in the human rights movement were among those most visible in the West (next to [[refusenik]]s).

[...] [O]n 5 September 1967, there appeared a Decree of the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet which cleared us of the charge of treason but described us not as Crimean Tatars but as "citizens of Tatar nationality formerly resident in the Crimea", thus legitimizing our banishment from our home country and liquidating us as a nation.{{hidden begin}} We did not grasp the significance of the decree immediately. After it was published, several thousand people traveled to the Crimea but were once again forcibly expelled. The protest which our people sent to the party Central Committee was left unanswered, as were also the protests of representatives of the Soviet public who supported us.

The authorities replied to us only with persecution and court cases. {{hidden end}}Since 1959 more than two hundred of the most active and courageous representatives have been sentenced to terms of up to seven years although they had always acted within the limits of the Soviet Constitution.

In particular, the [[Crimean Tatars]] aimed to return to [[Crimea]], the [[Meskhetian Turks]] to South [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and ethnic [[Volga Germans|Germans]] aimed to resettle along the [[Volga River]] near [[Saratov]].

The Crimean Tatar movement takes a prominent place among the movement of deported nations. The Tatars had been refused the right to return to the Crimea, even though the laws justifying their deportation had been overturned. Their first collective letter calling for the restoration dates to 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=

Led by [[Mustafa Dzhemilev]], they founded their own democratic and decentralized organization, considered unique in the history of independent movements in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=gerlant-law&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerlant, Uta|chapter="The law is our only language": Soviet dissidents and human rights|title=Human rights and history: a challenge for education|date=2010|publisher=Stiftung "Erinnerung, Verantwortung und Zukunft"|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-9810631-9-6|pages=130–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|131}}&lt;ref name=alexeyeva-dissent /&gt;{{rp|7}}

=== Emigration movements ===
{{Details|Refusenik}}The emigration movements in the Soviet Union included the movement of [[Soviet Jews]] to emigrate to Israel and of the [[Volga Germans]] to emigrate to West Germany.

[[Soviet Jews]] were routinely [[Exit visa|denied permission to emigrate]] by the authorities of the former [[Soviet Union]] and other countries of the [[Eastern bloc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Azbel', Mark |author2=Forbes, Grace |title=Refusenik, trapped in the Soviet Union|date=1981|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|isbn=978-0395302262|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kGSAAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; A movement for the right to emigrate formed in the 1960s, which also gave rise to a revival of interest in Jewish culture. The refusenik cause gathered considerable attention in the West.

Citizens of German origin who lived in the [[Baltic states]] prior to their annexation in 1940 and descendants of the
eighteenth-century Volga German settlers also formed a movement to leave the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=gerlant-law /&gt;{{rp|132}}&lt;ref name=rubenstein-dissent&gt;{{Cite book| isbn = 978-0-226-22628-6| pages = 64–75| last1 = Cracraft| first1 = James| last2 = Rubenstein| first2 = Joshua| title = The Soviet Union Today: An Interpretive Guide| chapter = Dissent| date = 1988| chapterurl = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;scope=site&amp;db=nlebk&amp;db=nlabk&amp;AN=933059}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}} In 1972, the West German government entered an agreement with the Soviet authorities which permitted between 6000 and 8000 people to emigrate to West Germany every year for the rest of the decade. As a result, almost 70000 ethnic Germans had left the Soviet Union by the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=rubenstein-dissent /&gt;{{rp|67}}

Similarly, Armenians achieved a small emigration. By the mid-1980s, over 15000 Armenians had emigrated.&lt;ref name=rubenstein-dissent /&gt;{{rp|68}}

=== Religious movements ===
{{Broader|Persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union}}The religious movements in the USSR included [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] movements. They focused on the freedom to practice their faith and resistance to interference by the state in their internal affairs.&lt;ref name=alexeyeva-dissent /&gt;{{rp|8}}

The Russian Orthodox movement remained relatively small. The Catholic movement in Lithuania was part of the larger Lithuanian national movement. Protestant groups which opposed the anti-religious state directives included the [[Baptists]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist]]s, and the [[Pentecostals]]. Similar to the Jewish and German dissident movements, many in the independent Pentecostal movement pursued emigration.

=== National movements{{Anchor|National movements}} ===
The national movements included the Russian national dissidents as well as dissident movements from Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Georgia, and Armenia.

Among the nations that lived in their own territories with the status of republics within the Soviet Union, the first movement to emerge in the 1960s was the Ukrainian movement. Its aspiration was to resist the [[Russification of Ukraine]] and to insist on equal rights and democratization for the republic.&lt;ref name=alexeyeva-dissent /&gt;{{rp|7}}

In Lithuania, the national movement of the 1970s was closely linked to the Catholic movement.&lt;ref name=alexeyeva-dissent /&gt;{{rp|7}}

=== Literary and cultural ===

Several landmark examples of dissenting writers played a significant role for the wider dissident movement. These include the persecutions of [[Osip Mandelstam|Osip Mandelshtam]], [[Boris Pasternak]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], and [[Joseph Brodsky]], as well as the publication of ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' by [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]].

In literary world, there were dozens of literati who participated in dissident movement, including [[Vasily Aksyonov]], [[Arkadiy Belinkov]], [[Leonid Borodin]], [[Joseph Brodsky]], [[Georgi Vladimov]], [[Vladimir Voinovich]], [[Alexander Galich (writer)|Aleksandr Galich]], [[Venedikt Yerofeyev]], [[Alexander Zinoviev]], [[Lev Kopelev]], [[Naum Korzhavin]], Vladimir Maximov, [[Viktor Nekrasov]], [[Andrei Sinyavsky]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], and [[Varlam Shalamov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Писатели-диссиденты: биобиблиографические статьи (начало)|journal = Новое литературное обозрение [New Literary Review]|date = 2004|issue = 66|url = http://magazines.russ.ru/nlo/2004/66/pisat29.html|trans-title = Dissident writers: bibliographic articles (beginning)|language = Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early Soviet Union, non-conforming academics were exiled via so-called [[Philosophers' ships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gregory, Paul|title=The ship of philosophers: how the early USSR dealt with dissident intellectuals|journal=[[The Independent Review]]|date=Spring 2009|volume=13|issue=4|pages=485–492|url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/2984587a66b51328b71eeaa8416662fc/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, figures such as cultural theorist [[Grigory Pomerants|Grigori Pomerants]] were among active dissidents.&lt;ref name="alexeyeva-dissent" /&gt;{{Rp|327}}

Other intersections of cultural and literary nonconformism with dissidents include the wide field of [[Soviet Nonconformist Art]], such as the painters of the underground Lianozovo group, and artists active in the "Second Culture".

=== Other groups ===
Other groups included the Socialists, the movements for socioeconomic rights (especially the independent unions), as well as women's, environmental, and peace movements.&lt;ref name=gerlant-law /&gt;{{rp|132}}&lt;ref name=alexeyeva-dissent /&gt;{{rp|3–18}}

==Dissidents and the Cold War==
[[File:C13571-8a.jpg|thumb|315px|right|President Reagan delivering the March 23, 1983 speech initiating [[Strategic Defense Initiative|Star Wars program]]]]
Responding to the issue of [[refusenik]]s in the Soviet Union, the United States Congress passed the [[Jackson–Vanik amendment]] in 1974. The provision in [[United States federal law]] intended to affect U.S. trade relations with countries of the [[Communist state|Communist bloc]] that restrict freedom of [[emigration]] and other [[human rights]].

The eight member countries of the [[Warsaw Pact]] signed the [[Helsinki Final Act]] in August 1975. The "third basket" of the Act included extensive human rights clauses.&lt;ref name="thomas-effect"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas, Daniel|title=The Helsinki effect: international norms, human rights, and the demise of Communism|date=2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N. J.|isbn=978-0691048598}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|99–100}}

When [[Jimmy Carter]] entered office in 1976, he broadened his advisory circle to include critics of US–Soviet [[détente]]. He voiced support for the Czech dissident movement known as [[Charter 77]], and publicly expressed concern about the Soviet treatment of dissidents [[Alexander Ginzburg|Aleksandr Ginzburg]] and [[Andrei Sakharov]]. In 1977, Carter received prominent dissident [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] in the White House, asserting that he did not intend "to be timid" in his support of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-83721-7| pages = 66–88| editors = Melvyn P.

In 1979, the [[Helsinki Watch|US Helsinki Watch Committee]] was established, funded by the [[Ford Foundation]]. Founded after the example of the [[Moscow Helsinki Group]] and similar watch groups in the Soviet bloc, it also aimed to monitor compliance with the human rights provisions of the [[Helsinki Accords]] and to provide moral support for those struggling for that objective inside the Soviet bloc. It acted as  aconduit for information on repression in the Soviet Union, and lobbied policy-makers in the United States to continue to press the issue with Soviet leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-83721-7| pages = 445–465| editors = Melvyn P.

US President [[Ronald Reagan]] attributed to the view that the "brutal treatment of Soviet dissidents was due to bureaucratic inertia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Altshuler, Stuart|title=From exodus to freedom: a history of the Soviet Jewry movement|date=2005|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0742549364|pages=61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G2uJfgAyVG0C&amp;pg=PA61}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 November 1988, he held a meeting with [[Andrei Sakharov]] at the [[White House]] and said that Soviet human rights abuses are impeding progress and would continue to do so until the problem is "completely eliminated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lee, Gary|title=President receives Sakharov|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=15 November 1988|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1988/11/15/president-receives-sakharov/2cb81c98-cc99-4769-abbc-136af36a4e55/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether talking to about one hundred dissidents in a broadcast to the Soviet people or at the U.S. Embassy, Reagan's agenda was one of freedom to travel, freedom of speech, freedom of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edwards, Lee|title=The essential Ronald Reagan: a profile in courage, justice, and wisdom|date=2005|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0742543751|pages=136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-dSvWrJ6ooAC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;lpg=PA136}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an opinion that [[Strategic Defense Initiative|Star Wars program]], which was launched in the US under Ronald Reagan, was a major factor in the chain of events that led to the first defeat of the USSR in the [[Cold War]] and later to the collapse of the communist regime in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ackerman, Galina|title=Еще раз о диссидентах – об их роли в падении советского режима|trans-title=Once again about dissidents – about their role in the fall of the Soviet regime|journal=[[Kontinent]]|date=2006|issue=128|url=http://magazines.russ.ru/continent/2006/128/akk15.html|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissidents about their dissent==
Andrei Sakharov said, "Everyone wants to have a job, be married, have children, be happy, but dissidents must be prepared to see their lives destroyed and those dear to them hurt. When I look at my situation and my family's situation and that of my country, I realize that things are getting steadily worse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hadden, Briton |author2=Luce, Henry |title=The World|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=1977|issue=109|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zj8nAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fellow dissident and one of the founders of the [[Moscow Helsinki Group]] [[Lyudmila Alexeyeva]] wrote:

{{quote|What would happen if citizens acted on the assumption that they have rights?

In [[political science]], '''statism''' is the belief that the [[state (polity)|state]] should control either [[economic policy|economic]] or [[social policy]], or both, to some degree.&lt;ref name="Statism1"&gt;* {{cite book | title=The State After Statism: New State Activities in the Age of Liberalization | publisher=Harvard University Press | author=Levy, Jonah D | year=2006 | location=Cambridge, MA | pages=469 | isbn=978-0-674-02276-8}}&lt;br /&gt;

While the term "statism" has been in use since the 1850s, it gained significant usage in [[Politics of the United States|American political]] discourse throughout the 1930s and 1940s. [[Ayn Rand]]&lt;ref&gt;"The term "statism" was tirelessly promoted by Ayn Rand. A computer search of her published works for "statism" or "statist" gives over 300 hits. She described statism as the idea that 'man’s life and work belong to the state—to society, to the group, the gang, the race, the nation—and that the state may dispose of him in any way it pleases for the sake of whatever it deems to be its own, tribal, collective good'". — Harry Binswanger,  ''Forbes'', November 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; made frequent use of it in a series of articles in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn, “Introducing Objectivism,” ''The Objectivist Newsletter'', Aug. 1962, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn, “War and Peace,” ''The Objectivist Newsletter'', Oct. 1962, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of statism==
Statism can take many forms from [[minarchism]] to [[totalitarianism]]. Minarchists prefer a minimal state such as a [[night-watchman state]] to protect people from [[aggression]], [[theft]], [[breach of contract]] and [[fraud]] with [[military]], [[police]] and [[courts]].&lt;ref name="Minarchism1"&gt;{{Cite journal | issn = 1145-6396 | volume = 12 | pages = 569–88 | last = Machan | first = T | title = Anarchism and Minarchism: A Rapprochement | journal = Journal Des Economistes et Des Etudes Humaines | year = 2002 }}

==State, society and individuals==
[[Authoritarianism|Authoritarians]] view a strong, authoritative state as required to legislate or enforce morality and cultural practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/authoritarian |title=authoritarian |author= |date=9 October 2013 |publisher=Dictionary.com, LLC |accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/facpub/644/ |title=The Authoritarian Impulse in Constitutional Law |author=West, Robin |date=1988 |publisher=Georgetown University Law Center |accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideology of statism espoused by [[fascism]] holds that [[sovereignty]] is not vested in the [[popular sovereignty|people]], but in the nation state and that all individuals and associations exist only to enhance the power, prestige and well-being of the state. It repudiates individualism and the family and exalts the nation as an organic body headed by the supreme leader and nurtured by unity, force and discipline.&lt;ref name="fascism"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fascism-archive.org/books/PoliticalDoctrinesRocco.html |title=The Political Doctrine of Fascism |author=Rocco, Alfredo |date=1926 |publisher=Carnegie Endowment For International Peace |accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fascism and some forms of [[corporatism]] extol the moral position that the corporate group, usually the state, is greater than the sum of its parts and that individuals have a moral obligation to serve the state.&lt;ref name="fascism" /&gt;

==Economic statism==
[[Economic statism]] promotes the view that the state has a major, necessary and legitimate role in directing the [[economy]], either directly through [[state-owned enterprises]] and other types of machinery of government, or indirectly through [[economic planning]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, R. J. Barry. "STATISM." Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy. 1st. Volume 3. New York, New York: Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===State interventionism===
{{Main article | State interventionism}}
The term "statism" is sometimes used to refer to [[Market economy|market economies]] with large amounts of government intervention, regulation or influence over a market or [[Mixed economy|mixed-market economy]]. [[Economic interventionism]] asserts that the state has a legitimate or necessary role within the framework of a [[Capitalism|capitalist economy]] by intervening in markets, regulating against overreaches of [[Private sector|private sector industry]] and either providing or subsidizing goods and services not adequately produced by the market.

===State socialism===
{{Main article | State socialism}}
State socialism broadly refers to forms of [[socialism]] based on [[State enterprise|state ownership]] of the means of production and state-directed allocation of resources. It is often used in reference to [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economic systems]] of former [[Communist state]]s.

In some cases, when used in reference to Soviet-type economies, state socialism is used interchangeably with [[state capitalism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Michie|first= Jonathan |title= Reader’s Guide to the Social Sciences |publisher= Routledge|date=January 1, 2001|isbn= 978-1579580919|page = 1595 |quote= State capitalism has inconsistently been used as a synonym for ‘state socialism’, although neither phrase has a stable denotation }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis that the Soviet model of economics was actually based upon a process of state-directed [[capital accumulation]] and social hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1= Bertrand Badie |author2= Dirk Berg-Schlosser |author3= Leonardo Morlino |title= International Encyclopedia of Political Science |publisher= SAGE Publications, Inc |year= 2011|month= |isbn= 978-1412959636|page = 2459|quote=The repressive state apparatus is in fact acting as an instrument of state capitalism to carry out the process of capital accumulation through forcible extraction of surplus from the working class and peasantry }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, state socialism is often used to designate any socialist political ideology or movement that advocates for the use of state power for the construction of socialism, or to the belief that the state must be appropriated and used to ensure the success of a [[socialist revolution]]. It is usually used in reference to [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] socialists who champion a [[single-party state]].

===State capitalism===
{{Main article | State capitalism}}
Statism may be used to refer to state capitalism. State capitalism refers to forms of capitalism that feature high concentrations of state-directed commercial enterprises.

In some cases, state capitalism refers to economic policies such as [[dirigisme]], which existed in France during the second half of the 20th century; and to the present-day economies of the People's Republic of China and Singapore, where the government owns controlling shares in [[Public company|publicly traded companies]].&lt;ref name="Leviathan in Business: Varieties of State Capitalism and Their Implications for Economic Performance, 2012"&gt;''Leviathan in Business: Varieties of State Capitalism and Their Implications for Economic Performance'', by Musacchio, Aldo. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors also define the former economies of the [[Eastern bloc]] as constituting a form of state capitalism.

The U.S. '''Passport Card''' is a limited [[travel document]] issued by the [[federal government of the United States]] in the size of a [[credit card]]. It may often be used as an identity card for purposes other than international travel, such as domestic air travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Passport Card|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/apply-renew-passport/card.html|website=travel.state.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like a U.S. [[United States passport|passport book]], the passport card is only issued to [[U.S. citizen]]s and [[Citizenship of the United States#Citizenship vs. nationality|U.S. nationals]] exclusively by the [[United States Department of State| U.S. Department of State]] and is compliant to the standards for [[identity documents]] set by the [[REAL ID Act]] and can be used as proof of U.S. citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/212239.pdf Passport Application Form DS-11] (Accessed December 2, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Passport Card|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/apply-renew-passport/card.html|website=Travel.State.Gov|publisher=U.S. Department of State - Bureau of Consular Affairs|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passport card allows cardholders to travel by domestic air flights within the United States and to enter and exit the United States via land and sea between member states of the [[Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative]] (WHTI).&lt;ref name=DoSPassportCard&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Passport Card|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/passports/information/card.html|publisher=U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs|accessdate=10 June 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604110932/https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/passports/information/card.html | archive-date = June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the passport card cannot be used for international [[air travel]].

The passport card (previously known as the People Access Security Service Card, or PASS Card) was created as a result of the WHTI which imposed more stringent documentary requirements on travelers. Applications have been accepted since February 1, 2008; production of the cards began July 14, 2008. By the end of 2016, more than 12 million Passport Cards had been issued to U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/statistics.html|title=Passport Statistics|last=|first=|date=|website=travel.state.gov|publisher=United States Department of State|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The card is manufactured by [[L-1 Identity Solutions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.l1id.com/pages/650-passport-card-border-crossing-card-solutions Passport Card &amp;amp; Border Crossing Card Solutions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301123033/http://www.l1id.com/pages/650-passport-card-border-crossing-card-solutions |date=2013-03-01 }}.

[[Identity document|National identity cards]] with similar utility are [[National identity cards in the European Economic Area|common inside]] the [[European Union]] countries for both national and international use, with the difference that such cards are often mandatory to carry in several of these countries. In contrast, there are only some states in the US which have '[[stop and identify statutes]]' and in these states a  driving licence will always suffice.

==History==
As a result of the [[September 11 attacks]], the United States began implementing a range of measures to increase the security of its [[Border control|borders]] and its [[identity document]]s. One result of this was [[Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative|WHTI]], which mandates that a smaller, more secure number of documents verifying both identity and citizenship be used to facilitate identification and international border crossing. Previous to WHTI, many different types of documents were acceptable to cross the border, including birth certificates issued by thousands of different authorities within the United States and Canada. As a result of WHTI, American citizens traveling to Canada would have been required to obtain a [[United States passport|passport]] booklet in order to cross the border. In order to offer a less expensive and more portable alternative to border communities and frequent travelers, the passport card was developed.

In an effort to improve efficiency at land crossings, the passport card also includes a vicinity-read [[radio frequency identification]] chip with a unique identifying number tied to [[government database]]s. Unlike the passport book, the RFID chip in the passport card is designed to be readable at a greater distance, allowing border agents to access traveler information before they pull up to the inspection station. While a [[biometric passport]] contains a chip containing all of the traveler's information in electronic format, the RFID chip in a passport card does not contain any personal information beyond the identifying number, which is used to locate records in secure government databases. To prevent the RFID chip from being read when the card is not being used, the passport card comes with a sleeve designed to block RFID while inside.&lt;ref&gt;[https://travel.state.gov/passport/ppt_card/ppt_card_3926.html U.S. Passport Card]. Retrieved February 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
The passport card is a limited travel document, valid only for land and sea travel within North America (Canada, the United States, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Bermuda). It cannot be used for international air travel. The Department of State indicates that this is because "designing a card format passport for wide use, including by air travelers, would inadvertently undercut the broad based international effort to strengthen civil aviation security and travel document specifications to address the post 9/11 threat environment".&lt;ref name="usgpo2006"&gt;US Government Printing Office (2006-10-17). Federal Register, Volume 71 Issue 200. [[US Government Printing Office]], 17 October 2006. Retrieved on 2010-08-04 from http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2006-10-17/html/E6-17237.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from being unable to be used for international air travel, the passport card is treated as a passport for all other purposes. A United States passport card can be used as primary evidence of United States citizenship, just like a passport booklet,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/42/435.407|title=42 CFR 435.407 - Types of acceptable documentary evidence of citizenship.|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be used as a valid proof of citizenship and proof of identity both inside and outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://de.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/passports/passport-card/ Passport Card&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the acceptance of the passport card as an identity document by both private and governmental entities within the U.S. varies greatly, due to its unfamiliarity with many people.{{cn|date=November 2017}}{{OR|date=May 2018}}

Under the [[REAL ID Act]], the passport card is also accepted for federal purposes (such as domestic air travel or entering federal buildings), which may make it an attractive option for people living in states whose [[driver's licenses]] and ID cards are not REAL ID–compliant when those requirements go into effect. TSA regulations list the passport card as an acceptable identity document at airport security checkpoints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/acceptable_documents.shtm Driver's License or Passports Preferred ID at Checkpoints], retrieved May 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; For the purposes of state [[Voter ID laws in the United States|voter photo identification]] initiatives, the passport card has been deemed acceptable.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

[[U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]] has indicated that the U.S. Passport Card may be used in the Employment Eligibility Verification Form [[I-9 (form)|I-9]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=8daff5a7ebd9b110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=55b2aca797e63110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD|title=USCIS Informs The Public That New Passport Card Is Acceptable For Employment Eligibility Verification|work=USCIS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passport card is considered a "List A" document that may be presented by newly hired employees during the employment eligibility verification process to show work authorized status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/131-list-documents-establish-identity-and-employment-authorization|title=List A Documents That Establish Identity and Employment Authorization|work=USCIS|accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "List A" documents are those used by employees to prove both identity and work authorization when completing the Form I-9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/acceptable-documents/list-documents/form-i-9-acceptable-documents|title=Form I-9 Acceptable Documents|work=USCIS|accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passport cards are much less popular than driver licenses, a commonly used form of identification. As previously stated, in 2016 there were more than 12 million passport cards issued. In contrast, in 2009 there were 210 million licensed drivers.&lt;ref&gt;cite web | url = https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/pubs/hf/pl11028/chapter4.cfm | author1 = Office of Highway Policy Information | publisher = US Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration | title = Our Nations Highways: 2011 | date = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. Passport Cards can be used ''only at land border-crossings or sea ports-of-entry'' to member states and territories of the [[Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative]], currently:

==Validity and fees==

The passport card will share the same validity period as the passport book: 10 years for persons 16 and over, 5 years for children under 16.  As of April 9, 2018, the passport card renewal fee for eligible applicants (adults only, by mail) is $30; first-time applicants and those applying in person must also pay a $35 processing fee, for a total fee of $65. Passport cards for children must be applied for in person; the total fee is $50, including the $35 processing fee.

Adults who already have a fully valid passport book may pay a fee of $30 to apply for the card as a passport renewal.

A citizen or national is allowed to hold both a card passport and a booklet passport. A passport in either form entitles its holder to apply for the other form (or both forms) as a "renewal" by mail at the end of its validity period.

==Card layout==
{{original research section|date=February 2018}}
[[Image:ppt card front.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 1:''' Front of Card blank artwork (2008).]]
[[File:Ppt card back blank.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 2:''' Card back artwork (2008).]]
The passport card is formatted according to specifications for [[ISO/IEC 7810#ID-1|credit card (ID-1) sized travel documents]], as described in ICAO Document 9303, Part 3, Volume 1. The card contains both human-readable and machine-readable information; the latter is printed in the [[machine-readable zone]] on the rear of the card as [[optical character recognition|OCR]]-readable text in a similar format as on the identity page of the passport book. The zone starts with the letters IP (designated by ICAO for passport card&lt;ref&gt;see page V-11 of [http://www2.icao.int/en/MRTD/Downloads/Doc%209303/Doc%209303%20English/Doc%209303%20Part%203%20Vol%201.pdf ICAO9303 part 3]&lt;/ref&gt;), followed by the issuing country code USA and then the Passport Card's serial number (which is prefixed with a "C" and differs from the individual's passport book number, even if issued together). The general layout of the Passport Card is virtually identical to the layout of the [[Border Crossing Card]] issued to Mexican citizens with primarily the background imagery and entitlements varying between the two cards.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

===Anti-counterfeiting features===
In addition to the embedded RFID chip, the front of the card features a complex multi-layer hologram consisting of an American bald eagle surrounded by the words "United States of America Department of State" in a small clearly readable font, further surrounded by the same words repeatedly in microprint. The card's background consists of interweaving smooth curves rich in variable color and microprint. All of the personal information on the card is created by laser engraving, with some key information produced in raised tactile engraving, including the date of birth, vertical letters "USA", the passport card number, and an alphanumeric sequence underneath the photograph. A second, smaller "ghost" photograph of the bearer is included on the right side of the card; when closely inspected this ghost image is actually an approximation of the shading in the original photo composed of various letters from the card holder's name. There is an embossed seal in the upper left hand corner of the card (partially overlapping the photograph) depicting the obverse of the [[Great Seal of the United States]]. On the rear of the card, the "PASSsystem" mark appears in [[Optically variable ink]]. When viewed under UV lighting, a reddish-orange bald eagle in flight appears. On newer passport cards, the eagle is surrounded by a blue ring that reads "From Sea To Shining Sea".{{fact|date=February 2018}}

The '''Welsh Language Board''' ({{lang-cy|Bwrdd yr Iaith Gymraeg}}) was a statutory body set up by [[Her Majesty's Government]] under the [[Welsh Language Act 1993]]. It was an [[Assembly Sponsored Public Body]]. It began its life under [[John Walter Jones (Wales)|John Walter Jones]] OBE, and its last Chief Executive was Meirion Prys Jones, with Meri Huws acting as Chair.

It received an annual government grant of £13m which was used to "promote and facilitate" the use of the [[Welsh language]].

The Board was responsible for administering the Welsh Language Act and for seeing that public bodies in [[Wales]] kept to its terms. Over 500 Welsh language schemes were agreed with a range of bodies named under the provisions of the Act.

In cases where there were concerns that public bodies were not complying with their Welsh language schemes, the Board could hold a statutory investigation. If the Board's investigations indicated that an organisation has broken its own Welsh language scheme, it could produce recommendations to the organisation and, ultimately, refer the matter to the Minister for Heritage at the Welsh Assembly Government.

The Board's Private Sector and Business team worked with a wide variety of large and small companies. Since launching the private sector Welsh language policy in November 2008, over 100 businesses produced a policy, and 150 companies signed up to the Board's "Investing in Welsh scheme", indicating support for the language.

The Welsh Language Board was at the forefront of promoting bilingual design, in part by making annual bilingual awards. In 2006, winners included FBA, Glass Hammer, Synergy Creative Design &amp; Marketing, Hoffi, 6721, Elfen, Zodshop and Departures.

In winter 2004 [[Rhodri Morgan]], previous [[First Minister of Wales]], announced his decision to abolish the Welsh Language Board. This decision evoked a mixed reaction throughout Wales: welcomed by ''[[Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg]]'' but met with scepticism by others. It was abolished on 31 March 2012 and replaced by the [[Welsh Language Commissioner]]: Meri Huws was the first Commissioner. The Board's powers were transferred to the Welsh Government and the Commissioner.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2193">'''Witte Boekje''' (English: ''White Booklet'') is the popular name for the '''Spelling Guide of Our Language''' (Spellingwijzer Onze Taal), a publication of the [[Genootschap Onze Taal]]. The first edition was released in October 1998; the latest edition is the tenth and was released in 2004. All these publications are explanations of the official spelling rules, as set by the [[Dutch Language Union]].

Although the words in the guide have been based on the same official rules as the [[Green Booklet]], the spellings in the two booklets do not always match. To aid users, the differences between the White Booklet and Green Booklet are made clear by appending ''GB'' to the differently spelled words.

==2006 edition==
After the spelling reform of 2005, the White Booklet was updated explicitly in a break with the [[Dutch Language Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NiRDcX7WEwMC&amp;pg=PA251|title=Tussen taal, spelling en onderwijs|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqkijaV-tdwC&amp;pg=PA10|title=Dutch|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boycott of official spelling==
The latest edition will, because of the changes, be unable to bear the official certification mark of the [[Dutch Language Union]]. The White Booklet will then become the spelling prescription of a group of media organizations and companies in The Netherlands who will boycott the new spelling rules. These parties have jointly announced in December 2005 that they will not switch to the new official spelling, and they had not done as of August 1, 2006. These are [[de Volkskrant]], [[Trouw]], [[NRC Handelsblad]], [[Elsevier (magazine)|Elsevier]], [[HP/De Tijd]], [[De Groene Amsterdammer]], [[Vrij Nederland]], [[Planet Internet]], [[TekstNet]], and the [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]]. They will follow the spelling as determined by the White Booklet.

Even though Onze Taal is a society for both Belgium and the Netherlands, no major media or publisher in Flanders uses the White Booklet.

"'''Women's rights are human rights'''" is a phrase used in the [[feminism|feminist movement]]. The phrase was first used in the 1980s and early 1990s. Its most prominent usage is as the name of a speech given by [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Rodham Clinton]], the [[First Lady of the United States]], on 5 September 1995, at the [[United Nations]] [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fester|first=Gertrude|title=Women's Rights Are Human Rights|journal=Agenda: Empowering Women for Gender Equity |date=1994|volume=20|pages=76–79|jstor=4065874}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this speech she sought to closely link the notion of [[women's rights]] with that of [[human rights]]. In the speech, Clinton used the phrase within the longer, bidirectional refrain, "human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights."

==First uses==
The notion that "women's rights are human rights" was first expressed with different phrasing by the abolitionists and proto-feminists [[Sarah Moore Grimké]] and [[Angelina Grimké|Angelina Grimké Weld]] in the late 1830s.  In her series of ''Letters on the Equality of the Sexes'', Sarah Moore Grimké writes, "Consequently I know nothing of man’s rights, or woman’s rights; human rights are all that I recognize".&lt;ref&gt;''Letters on the Equality of the Sexes, and the Condition of Woman''. Addressed to Mary S. Parker.  Boston:  Isaac Knapp, 1838.  Reprinted by Forgotten Books, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar expression is used by her sister, Angelina Grimké Weld, in her speeches and personal letters. In a letter to her friend Jane Smith, she writes, "whatever is morally right for a man to do is morally right for a woman to do.  I recognized no rights but human rights."&lt;ref&gt;The Grimke Sisters, ''Sarah and Angelina Grimke:  the First American Women Advocates of Abolition and Woman's Rights''.  Washington, DC, Lee and Shepard, 1885. Reprint by Greenwood Press, 1969.  Reprint by Hard Press, 2014, p.109.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The phrase "Women's rights are human rights" was used intermittently during the 1980s and first half of the 1990s, before Clinton's speech.  Instances include in 1984, when ''[[The New York Times]]'' quoted the head of [[New York City Human Rights Law|New York City's Human Rights Commission]], Marcella Maxwell, using this phrase in conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/01/style/a-fighter-for-roghts.html | title=A Fighter for Rights | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 1, 1984|author=Lawson, Carol}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was again used in 1985 by [[Cecilia Medina]], a noted Chilean jurist, in a seminal paper on feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Eg51ozCTCUC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=%22women's%20rights%20are%20human%20rights%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22women's%20rights%20are%20human%20rights%22&amp;f=false|title=Women, Feminist Identity, and Society in the 1980s: Selected Papers|first1=Myriam|last1=Díaz-Diocaretz|first2=Iris M.|last2=Zavala|date=1 January 1985|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of her work was 'Women's Rights as Human Rights: Latin American Countries and the Organization of American States (OAS).' In articulating the historic idea, Medina wrote, "As a logical consequence of the fact that women's rights are human rights, feminism, in theory, is a movement to achieve a democratic society, without which human rights may not be fully enjoyed."

Canadian politician [[Ed Broadbent]], who was the head of the [[International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development]], used the phrase in an interview with the ''[[Calgary Herald]]'' in January 1993 when he stated, "If we believe as a society that women's rights are human rights, then it is time to stop discriminating against women in refugee policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/BP/bp370-e.htm#(2) | title=Gender-related Refugee Claims | publisher=Government of Canada Publications | date=March 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was used by Laurel Fletcher during a 1993 international law symposium called ''Human Rights Violations Against Women'', an edited version of which was published by Fletcher, Allyn Taylor and Joan Fitzpatrick in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1216&amp;context=facpubs|title=Human Rights Violations Against Women|first1=Laurel|last1=Fletcher|first2=Allyn|last2=Taylor|first3=Joan|last3=Fitzpatrick|journal=Whittier Law Review|volume=15|issue=319|year=1994|access-date=2017-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 3 of Malaysian Charter on Human Rights, published in December 1994 by a number of non-governmental organizations, begins with the sentence "Women's Rights are Human Rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurights.or.jp/archives/other_documents/section1/1994/03/malaysian-charter-on-human-rights-1994.html|title=Malaysian Charter on Human Rights|publisher=Malaysian NGOs|year=1994|accessdate=2017-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In planning to make her speech, the 47-year-old Clinton defied both internal administration pressure and external Chinese pressure to soften her remarks.&lt;ref name="nw-doctrine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt122607"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/26/us/politics/26clinton.html |title=The Résumé Factor: Those 8 Years as First Lady |last=Healy | first= Patrick |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[U.S. State Department]] and the [[National Security Agency]] both tried to dissuade her on the grounds that it would irritate the Chinese.&lt;ref name=timesfd/&gt; While President [[Bill Clinton]] had seen the speech in advance, his aides had not, and White House Chief of Staff [[Thomas McLarty]] was under the impression that it would not say anything new or controversial.&lt;ref name = timesfd/&gt; Some human rights campaigners also objected to Clinton speaking in China, fearing it would legitimize that government, and a State Department condition was that Chinese human rights activist [[Harry Wu]] be released before she would appear, which he was.&lt;ref name=timesfd/&gt; Some vocal Catholic groups criticized the gathering as "anti-family" while some ideological conservatives said that Clinton was clearly going to push a "radical feminist agenda" while there.&lt;ref name=timesfd/&gt;

Cecilia Medina was part of the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] in 1995 and so may have influenced the speech.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

Once it happened on 5 September 1995, Clinton's speech was delivered in a large hall at the conference.&lt;ref name=timesfd/&gt;
In it, she argued against practices abusing women around the world and in China itself.&lt;ref name="nyt090695"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tyler |first=Patrick |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/06/world/hillary-clinton-in-china-details-abuse-of-women.html |title=Hillary Clinton, In China, Details Abuse of Women |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 6, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Targeting governments and organizations as well as individual females, she stated her belief that the issues facing women and girls are often either ignored or "silenced" and thus go unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clinton|first=Hillary Rodham|title=Women's Rights Are Human Rights|journal=[[Women's Studies Quarterly]]|date=1996|volume=24|issue=1/2|pages=98–101|jstor=40004518}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elements brought up in the speech include [[dowry death]]s and China's [[one-child policy]].&lt;ref name="nyt090695" /&gt;

Clinton declared "that it is no longer acceptable to discuss women's rights as separate from human rights".&lt;ref name="nyt090695" /&gt; Delegates from over 180&amp;nbsp;countries heard her say:

{{cquote|"If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights, once and for all."&lt;ref name="nw-doctrine"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2011/03/06/the-hillary-doctrine.html |title=The Hillary Doctrine |last=Lemmon | first=Gayle Tzemach |magazine=[[Newsweek]] |date=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

She followed this by saying, "As long as discrimination and inequities remain so commonplace everywhere in the world, as long as girls and women are valued less, fed less, fed last, overworked, underpaid, not schooled, subjected to violence in and outside their homes—the potential of the human family to create a peaceful, prosperous world will not be realized."&lt;ref name=nw-doctrine/&gt;  A number of the women delegates at the conference pounded on tables and cheered as she spoke.&lt;ref name=nw-doctrine/&gt;

China's citizenry was not allowed to attend the speech, and it was blacked out on Chinese radio and television.&lt;ref name="nyt090695"/&gt;

The speech received prominent media attention at the time.&lt;ref name=nbcnn&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/flashback-first-lady-hillary-clinton-china-n58001 "Flashback: First Lady Hillary Clinton in China"], BETSY FISCHER MARTIN and GRACE LAMB-ATKINSON, NBC News, 20 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[NBC News]] anchor [[Tom Brokaw]] said, "In her own way, she made a direct hit on the Chinese," while that network's correspondent [[Andrea Mitchell]] said it was "highly unusual" for a U.S. first lady to engage in this kind of significant diplomatic activity.&lt;ref name=nbcnn /&gt; ''The New York Times'' said that Clinton spoke "more forcefully on human rights than any American dignitary has on Chinese soil."&lt;ref name="nyt090695"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
The speech is considered to be influential in the women's rights movement. Specifically, it became a key moment in the empowerment of women, and years later women around the world would recite Clinton's key phrases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Hillary Doctrine: Sex &amp; American Foreign Policy | last=Hudson | first=Valerie M. | last2=Leidl | first2=Patricia | publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] | year=2015 | isbn=0-231-16492-0 | location=New York |pages=7-8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The speech was listed as number 35 in American Rhetoric's Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century (listed by rank).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael E. Eidenmuller |url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/top100speechesall.html |title=Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century by Rank |publisher=American Rhetoric |date=2009-02-13 |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Clinton took a similar position on [[LGBT rights by country or territory|LGBT rights]] in a speech to the United Nations on [[International Human Rights Day]], declaring "gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/post/Clintons-geneva-accord-gay-rights-are-human-rights/2011/03/04/gIQAPUipcO_blog.html|title=Clinton’s Geneva accord: ‘Gay rights are human rights’|last=Capehart|first=Jonathan|date=December 11, 2011|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, following Clinton's stint as [[U.S. Secretary of State]], Clinton led a review at the [[Clinton Global Initiative]] of how women's rights have changed since her 1995 speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rucker|first=Philip|title=Hillary Clinton to lead review of progress for women since 1995 Beijing conference|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/09/25/hillary-clinton-to-lead-review-of-progress-for-women-since-1995-beijing-conference/|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=September 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concluded that progress had been made for girls in education and for women and girls in healthcare but that females around the world still suffered due to lack of political rights and security vulnerabilities.&lt;ref name=timesfd/&gt; In Clinton's words: "It’s a glass-half-filled kind of scenario."&lt;ref name=timesfd/&gt;

On the twentieth anniversary of the speech in 2015 there were more retrospectives on it.&lt;ref name=timesfd &gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/09/05/20-years-later-hillary-clintons-beijing-speech-on-women-resonates/?_r=0 "Hillary Clinton' Beijing Speech on Women Resonates 20 Years Later"], Amy Chozick, ''The New York Times'', 5 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  Not everyone was enamored of it: publicly visible lawyer [[Bruce Fein]] said:  “She made one statement in Beijing that wasn’t very profound — that women are human beings.”&lt;ref name=timesfd/&gt;

The speech and phrase became a focal point of [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref name=timesfd/&gt; The campaign sold T-shirts stating "women's rights are human rights" at her campaign store, in reference to her speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Apparel |url=https://shop.hillaryclinton.com/products/the-trailblazer-tee |title=The Trailblazer Tee &amp;#124; Shop &amp;#124; Hillary for America Shop |publisher=Shop.hillaryclinton.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign also sold a bag that featured the full phrase "Human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights"; on the bag it was shown in six languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Accessories |url=https://shop.hillaryclinton.com/products/statement-bag |title=Statement Bag &amp;#124; The Shop |publisher=Shop.hillaryclinton.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, the campaign sold a [[Tory Burch]] T-shirt featuring the phrase "women's rights are human rights..." in capital letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://shop.hillaryclinton.com/products/tory-burch-tee |title=Tory Burch Tee &amp;#124; The Shop |publisher=Shop.hillaryclinton.com |date=2016-06-23 |accessdate=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign also created photo references and displays of items necessary for five Halloween costumes, including "'Women’s rights are human rights' Hillary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Singer |first=Paul |url=http://onpolitics.usatoday.com/2015/10/26/hillary-clinton-campaign-sanctions-official-halloween-costume-ideas/ |title=Hillary Clinton campaign sanctions official Halloween costume ideas &amp;#124;|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2015-01-21 |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/halloween/ |title=Texts from Hillary and 4 other DIY Hillary Clinton costumes for Halloween &amp;#124; The Feed &amp;#124; Hillary for America |publisher=Hillaryclinton.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jennifer Lopez]]'s 2016 music video for her song "[[Ain't Your Mama]]", a sample of Clinton giving part of her speech can be heard, specifically, "Human rights are women’s rights, and women’s rights are human rights, once and for all."&lt;ref&gt;Gostin, Nicki  [http://m.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/jennifer-lopez-samples-hillary-clinton-speech-new-music-video-article-1.2627353 "Jennifer Lopez samples Hillary Clinton speech in new music video"] ''[[New York Daily News]]'', 6 May 2016&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/hillaryclintonbeijingspeech.htm "Hillary Rodham Clinton – United Nations 4th World Conference Speech"] American Rhetoric &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, for [[International Women's Day]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] released a short film titled ''Her-Story''; it ends with the message "Women's rights are human rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Legaspi |first=Althea |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/see-madonnas-stylish-international-womens-day-short-film-w471211 |title=See Madonna's Stylish International Women's Day Short Film |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2017-03-08 |accessdate=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As evidenced by physician Leslie Regan in ''[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]'', the phrase remains relevant in political discourse in the 2010s, specifically with regards to the discussion of policy regarding women's sexual health and reproductive rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Regan|first=Lesley|title=Integrating Human Rights and Women’s Health.

The '''World Federation of the Deaf''' ('''WFD''') is an international [[non-governmental organization]] that acts as a [[peak body]] for [[World Federation of the Deaf#Constituency|national associations of Deaf people]], with a focus on Deaf people who use sign language and their family and friends. WFD aims to promote the Human Rights of Deaf people worldwide, by working closely with the [[United Nations]] (with which it has consultative status) and various UN agencies such as the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://esango.un.org/civilsociety/showProfileDetail.do?method=showProfileDetails&amp;profileCode=547 |title=World federation of the Deaf's entry on the website of the United Nations |accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  WFD is also a member of the [[International Disability Alliance]] (IDA).

The current 11 board members are all deaf. The offices are located in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]].

== History ==
The WFD was established in September 1951 in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], at the first World Deaf Congress, under the auspices of ''Ente Nazionale Sordomuti'' (ENS), the Italian Deaf Association.&lt;ref name="mission" /&gt; The first president of WFD was Professor Vittorio Ieralla, who was also, at that time, president of the ENS. The congress was attended by representatives from 25 countries.

Dr. [[Cesare Magarotto]] was one of the founders of World Federation of the Deaf and its first General Secretary (1951-1987) along with Mr. Vittorio Ieralla who was elected as the President from 1951 -1955.

Mr. Ieralla and Dr. Magarotto successfully convinced the Italian government to support their efforts to establish a WFD General Secretariat in Rome, in 1951. With continued support from the Italian government and later with the ENS, the WFD General Secretariat was able to establish informative and advocacy networks, with national federations of the Deaf around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wfdeaf.org/whoarewe/history |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919060604/http://wfdeaf.org/whoarewe/history |archivedate=2015-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Decades later, the WFD General Secretariat relocated to Finland (1987), with support from the Finnish government and the Finnish national of the Deaf led by the former WFD General Secretary Dr. Liisa Kauppinen (WFD President Emeritius).

==Constituency==
The WFD claims to represent 70 million deaf people worldwide, of which more than 80 percent live in [[developing countries]]. This is done mainly through membership of national deaf organisations, where such organisations exist. {{As of|2009|February}}, 130 national associations are members. Associate members, international members and individual members also make up WFD’s membership base.

The '''Worshipful Company of Leathersellers''' is one of the [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]] of the [[City of London]]. The organisation originates from the latter part of the fourteenth century and received its [[Royal Charter]] in 1444, and thereby is the senior leather industry-related City Livery Company.

The Leathersellers' Company ranks fifteenth in the [[order of precedence]] of Livery Companies. The Company's [[motto]] is ''Soli Deo Honor et Gloria'', [[Latin]] for ''Honour and Glory to God Alone''.

==Activities==
The Company, which originally regulated [[leather]] [[merchant]]s, continues to act as an advocate for the [[UK]] leather trade, together with its leather-associated livery partners: ''Cordwainers'', ''Curriers'', ''Girdlers'', ''Glovers'' and ''Saddlers'' . Like all these other Companies, today it is primarily involved in philanthropic, charitable and educational activities.

==Schools==
The [[Livery Company|Company]] is very closely linked with the Leathersellers' Federation of Schools (formerly Prendergast School), now comprising [[Prendergast Hilly Fields College]], [[Prendergast Ladywell Fields College]] and [[Prendergast Vale College]], all located within the [[London Borough of Lewisham]]. Since the mid-seventeenth century the Company has also been closely associated with [[Colfe's School]], today an independent co-educational school located at Lee, near [[Lewisham]], [[London]]. In addition the Company supports and maintains its longstanding connection with the Institute for Creative Leather Technologies (now a part of the [[University of Northampton]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northampton.ac.uk/info/20521/research-in-the-school-of-science-and-technology/773/institute-for-creative-leather-technologies ''Institute for Creative Leather Technologies'']&lt;/ref&gt; successor to the college which the Company founded at [[Bermondsey]] in 1909 as Leathersellers' Technical College. The Company continues to support higher education through [[exhibition]]s (grants) to university students, a practice which began in 1603 when four 'poor scholars', two at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and two at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], were awarded five pounds and five shillings each ''per annum''. Today around 100 students receive exhibitions which enable them to study at various universities.

==Affiliations==
The Company is affiliated with the Royal Navy's submarine [[HMS Tireless|HMS ''Tireless'']] and with [[1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards]].

==Almshouses==
Like many other Livery Companies, it has a long tradition of maintaining [[almshouses]]. The first almshouses run by the Company were built circa 1543-44, close to Leathersellers' Hall, on a site behind [[St Ethelburga's Bishopsgate|St Ethelburga's Church]] and housed seven elderly people. In 1837 the Company also built almshouses at [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]] in north London. These were extended in the mid-nineteenth century. In 1866 it was decided to close the almshouses in the City and remove the residents from there to join those already at Barnet. The Company still maintains almshouses in the [[London Borough of Barnet]], now known as Leathersellers' Close, home to about 20 residents.

The Company has had previous six Halls throughout its history, and is now in its seventh Hall, which was officially opened by HRH the Earl of Wessex in May 2017. Its first hall was on [[London Wall]] but in 1543 the Company acquired the former [[Benedictine]] [[Convent]] of St Helen, off [[Bishopsgate]], and the subsequent Halls have all been on that site, now [[St Helen's Bishopsgate|St Helen's Place]]. The fifth Hall was destroyed in May 1941 during the [[London Blitz]]. The sixth Hall was officially opened in 1960 and was demolished in 2011, though the [[façade]] of the building has been saved. The new, seventh Hall, has been designed by Eric Parry [[Royal Academician|RA]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/academicians/architects/eric-parry-ra,596,AR.html www.royalacademy.org.uk - Eric Parry]&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Yetta Barsh Shachtman''' (1915–1996) was an [[United States|American]] [[socialist]] politician, married to [[Max Shachtman]], a Marxist theorist.

She wrote most of [[Albert Shanker]]'s weekly columns for the ''[[New York Times]]''. At her funeral, [[Saul Bellow]], a classmate, delivered a eulogy.

Yetta did not write most -- or even any -- of Al's weekly ''New York Times'' pieces. He wrote them himself -- typing with two fingers -- except during a stretch in 1975-76 when New York City was on the verge of bankruptcy and the [[United Federation of Teachers]] was on the verge of a strike (and during the strike itself).
