      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5972">An '''American immigrant novel''' is a genre of American fiction novel which explores the process of assimilation and the relationship American immigrants have towards American identity and ideas. The novels often show and explore generational differences in immigrant families, especially the first and second generations. The extraordinary ethnic diversity of America allows for a type of immigrant novel which differs from other countries. America, often seen as a country of immigrants, opens up a unique canvas for expression and a better understanding of the american immigrant experience through literature. The narrative styles are diverse and can include memoirs, third person, first person, and biographies. The past twenty-five years alone have witnessed a major scholarly emphasis on multiculturalism in American studies, and a flood of new immigrant novels, reflecting the shifting demographics of United States immigration patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/literature-and-language-arts/essays/immigrant-fiction-exploring-american-identity|title=Immigrant Fiction: Exploring an American Identity {{!}} The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History|date=2012-06-21|website=www.gilderlehrman.org|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generational changes of attitude, identity, experience and demographics from real statistics are challenged and explored  by immigrant novels, such as the change in income level and attitudes towards assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewhispanic.org/2004/03/19/generational-differences/|title=Generational Differences|date=2004-03-19|website=Pew Research Center's Hispanic Trends Project|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==
In these novels the immigrant experience often begins with a feeling of wild, open-ended adventure, as the protagonists make the move to the US and leave their previous homes halfway around the world. However once they arrive in America, the immigrant family often finds themselves in an unfamiliar and seemingly unwelcoming and introverted culture. Tensions appear within and without the family and manifest themselves in problems at work, with health, or strained family relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/literature-and-language-arts/essays/immigrant-fiction-exploring-american-identity|title=Immigrant Fiction: Exploring an American Identity {{!}} The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History|date=2012-06-21|website=www.gilderlehrman.org|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents tend to retain their culture from their home country while their children, the second generation are fully assimilated americans who understand american culture and become the guides for their parents. Then often in this pattern the third generation, the grandkids of the original immigrants return to a fascination with their heritage and their grandparent’s culture. Recent research highlights the complexity of immigrant generations and their increases and declines in socioeconomic integration, and this genre of novel explores this complex theme. Age at the time of arrival, family relationships, and economic status all interact to create a diverse genre of novel, dealing with types of questions such as when the immigrants behind to consider themselves american, and when parents and children will end up switching roles as the younger caretaker and the older, but seemingly helpless beneficiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/www/external/labor/seminars/adp/pdfs/2013/trejo.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The powerful mother is a common pivotal figure in immigrant fiction, just as the sensitive child, torn between this matriarchal authority and a weaker, less adaptive father, often assumes the book’s central consciousness. Paule Marshall’s&amp;nbsp;''Brown Girl, Brownstones''&amp;nbsp;(1959), certainly fits the pattern, with its tense mother-daughter duo, Silla and Selina. Silla is the archetypal strong Barbadian woman who will scrub floors, work day and night, and save every penny to own someday a piece of America, a brownstone house, even if it means crushing her husband’s island-returning dreams in the process. Selena, her articulate, precocious daughter, seeks her own individual identity, with or without the approval of the community. (It is worth noting how many immigrant novels fit this&amp;nbsp;''Bildungsroman''&amp;nbsp;pattern of tracing the moral, psychological, and intellectual development of a youthful main character: The émigré group’s inexperience in the new country and the young protagonist’s viewpoint seem to dovetail nicely.) Marshall’s vivid, earthy prose thrillingly depicts the speech and singular folkways of the Barbadian colony, both its strivers and the idlers, as it re-roots itself in a Brooklyn ghetto.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/literature-and-language-arts/essays/immigrant-fiction-exploring-american-identity|title=Immigrant Fiction: Exploring an American Identity {{!}} The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History|date=2012-06-21|website=www.gilderlehrman.org|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Annals of Loch Cé''''' (also ''Annals of Lough Cé'') cover events, mainly in Connacht and its neighbouring regions, from 1014 to 1590. It takes its name from [[Lough Cé]] in the kingdom of [[Moylurg]] - now north [[County Roscommon]]  - which was the centre of power of the Clan [[MacDermot]]. For its earliest centuries it used the [[Annals of Boyle]].

The largest part of the Annals are attributed to members of [[Clan Ó Duibhgeannáin]], with some emendations by the patron, [[Kings of Moylurg|Brian na Carriag MacDermot]], first MacDermot of the Carrick (died 1592). The text is in [[Early Modern Irish]], with a portion of the text in [[Latin]].

[[File:Den tyske ordens skjold.svg|thumb|right|Emblazonment of the Order of Teutonic Knights.]]
[[File:Teuton flag.svg|thumb|right|Emblazonment of the Order's Grand Master.]]
The '''''Banderia Prutenorum''''' is a manuscript of 48 [[parchment]] sheets, 18.6 by 29.3&amp;nbsp;cm (7.3 by 11.5&amp;nbsp;inches), composed by [[Jan Długosz]] and illuminated by Stanisław Durink, listing 56 ''vexillae'', or [[banner]]s, of the Order of the [[Teutonic Knights]]. The title means ''Blazons of the Prussians''.&lt;ref&gt;According to ''Webster's Third New International Dictionary'', [[Gothic language|Gothic]] has ''bandwa'', "sign", from which Germanic [http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE36.html *bandwa-], "sign", is reconstructed. From this comes [[Late Latin]] ''banderia'', which Webster's hypothesizes has a Latin formative suffix, -arium. It could as well be from a Germanic plural. Banner comes from it, but the earlier meaning was not the cloth but the signs. [[Blazon]] has a similar origin from a different but synonymous root, [http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE50.html *bhel-], at least in the sense of "sign." In [[Middle English]] it has the connotation of shield, but this also is a secondary development. Heraldry originates with the Roman army, who put their unit signs on shields but not flags. ''Banderia'' therefore imitate the shield blazons in cloth. Royal and national "blazons" go beyond the original intent, which was only unit identification, and are therefore a later development.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Prutenorum'' is the [[genitive]] plural of ''Pruteni'', [[Old Prussians|Prussians]].

In Polish the name is ''Chorągwie Pruskie''. ''Chorągwie'' can mean ''banner'', ''standard'', or ''regiment''. The heraldic term [[blazon]] in English is probably the exact meaning.

==Historical circumstances of the Banderia==
The work describes the [[gonfalon]]s, or battle flags,&lt;ref&gt;The original Germanic [http://www.bartleby.com/61/96/G0189600.html *gundfanon-] meant "battle-flag". According to ''Webster's Third New International Dictionary'', this descends through [[Old High German]] ''gunfano'', "[[war flag]]" to [[Middle French]] and modern English gonfanon, a very rare word, and through [[Italian language|Italian]] ''gonfalone'' to English [[gonfalon]], synonymous with gonfanon. The modern terms have ceased to mean battle flags except when historians use them to refer to battle flags.&lt;/ref&gt; collected from the field after the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410 AD. This battle was a major confrontation between the Teutonic Order and the allied forces of [[Poles]] and [[Lithuanians]], whom the Order was trying to conquer. At that time, the Order had succeeded in subjecting or eliminating the western Balts, including the Prussians; however, the Teutonic Knights were decisively defeated by the joint forces of the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]] and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania under the command of the Polish King [[Władysław II Jagiełło]].

At the end of the battle, the major officers of the Order lay dead on the field beside the standards under which they had fought. Some units escaped with their standards. The Banderia does not describe all the order's flags. The flags were collected and stored at [[Wawel Cathedral]] in [[Cracow]]. They are known to have been there in 1603, after which they disappeared. They have been recreated, starting in the 1900. In October 2009, as part of the preparations for the battle's anniversairy, Polish scholars and artists in Kraków have finished reconstructing all known standards.&lt;ref name=mp&gt;{{pl icon}} Magdalena Piwnicka, ''Znaki świetnego zwycięstwa'', Focus - Historia, Nr 7-8. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
It was probably the Polish historian, [[Jan Długosz]], who commissioned the painter, Stanisław Durink of [[Cracow]], to illustrate the flags in 1448. Długosz then wrote the [[Latin]] descriptions. The work thus has the format of a catalog, with an [[Illuminated manuscript|illumination]] and Latin entry for each flag.

The flag is decorated with a heraldic blazon identifying the ''comturia'', or district, from which the soldiers of that unit came. The blazon might appear in any circumstances, such as in a [[coat of arms]] or on a shield, or in any conspicuous place. Its function was that of identification. The rules of heraldry were undoubtedly followed.

The title raises a few questions of language and society. In it a Polish scholar and historian is calling the conquerors of the Prussians by that very name, even though at the beginning of their conquest they found the name odious to them. Old Prussian speakers still lived in substantial numbers in east Prussia. As they were not excluded from military service, some must have fought for the order, and yet they are not distinguished from the Germans in any way.

''Banderium'' is in origin neither Latin nor Polish, but comes from the Germanic. The place names also are in their Germanic forms rather than their Polish ones. Why Długosz, a Polish historian, chose to use the Germanicized Prussian Latin is not clear.

==Location of the manuscript==
By some miracle, the manuscript survived World War II, even though it was given to [[Malbork]] castle by the Nazis for political purposes. After the war it showed up at a London auction house and was brought to its current location in the library of [[Jagiellonian University]].

==Notes on the work==
In the scholarly Latin of manuscript terminology, a ''[[recto]]'' page is "on the right side". The ''[[verso]]'' or "turned side" (the other side of the page) is therefore a left-hand page. This terminology has nothing to do with Długosz.

Durink states the width (''latitudo'') and length (''longitudo'') of each flag in units he calls ''ulne'' (classical ''ulnae''). These must be [[cubit]]s rather than [[ell]]s; i.e., one ''ulna'' is 18&amp;nbsp;inches by today's standard ell. The flags are generally longer than they are wide.

Page 1 recto bears the following introduction:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Pro libraria universitatis studii Cracouiensis datum per dominum Johannem Dlugosch. Descriptio Prutenicae cladis seu crucigerorum sub Jagellone per Joannem Dlugosz canonicum Cracoviensem. Banderia Prutenorum anno domini millesimo quadringentesimo decimo in festo Divisionis Apostolorum erecta contra Polonie regem Wladislaum Jagyelno et per eundem regem prostrata et Cracouiam adducta ac in ecclesia catedrali suspensa, que, ut sequitur, in hune modum fuerunt depicta.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A translation directly from the Latin is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Given to the library of the university of study of Cracow by the master John Długosz. Description of the Prussian ruin or (the ruin) of the cross-bearers through Jagiello by John Dlugosz, canon of Cracow. The blazons of the Prussians in the year of the Lord 1410 in the holiday of the Divisio Apostolorum (Dispersal of the Apostles), which were erected against the king of Poland, Wladislaw Jagiello, and were cast down by the same king and brought to Cracow and hung in the church cathedral, were depicted in this manner, as follows.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The description to which Długosz refers is contained in the Latin notes with the flags.

==Comturiae mentioned in the work==
[[Chełmno|Culm]], [[Pomesania]], [[Graudenz]], [[Balga]], [[Kowalewo Pomorskie|Schonsze]], [[Starogard Gdański|Stargard]], [[Sambia]], [[Tuchola|Tuchel]], [[Stuhm]], [[Nessau]], [[Westphalia]], [[Rogasen]], [[Elbing]], [[Pokrzywno, West Pomeranian Voivodeship|Engelsburg]], [[Brodnica|Strasburg]], [[Chełm, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship|Chełm]], [[Brettchen]] and [[Neumark]], [[Braunsberg]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3349">'''Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 139''' is a northern English manuscript compiled in ''c''. 1170. Apart from preliminary additions (i + ii), it contains two separate volumes, comprising 180 folios in total. The original first volume has 165 folios in twenty gatherings, about half of which are occupied by the historical compilation ''[[Historia regum]]'', which runs from f. 51v to 129v. In the sixteenth century, the codex was bequeathed by [[Matthew Parker]] to the [[Parker Library]] of [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], where it is held to this day.

'''''Carmen Miserabile super Destructione Regni Hungariae per Tartaros''''' ([[Latin]] for "Sad Song for the destruction of the Kingdom of Hungary by the Tartars") is an account written by [[Rogerius of Apulia]].  After 1241, Rogerius wrote a description of the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|conquest]] of [[Transylvania]] and the Great Hungarian Plain by the [[Tatars]] in this work.  [[Mongol]]-[[Tatar]] [[Golden Horde]] forces led by [[Batu Khan]] began attacking [[Europe]] in 1223, starting with [[Kievan Rus'|Kievan Rus]]. They continued to defeat [[Germany|German]], [[Poland|Polish]], and [[Hungary|Hungarian]] armies before turning back to go home in 1241.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64916">These tables provide a '''comparison of operating systems''', of computer devices, as listing general and technical information for a number of widely used and currently available [[personal computer|PC]] or handheld (including [[smartphone]] and [[tablet computer]]) [[operating system]]s. The article "[[Usage share of operating systems]]" provides a broader, and more general, comparison of operating systems that includes [[Server (computing)|servers]], [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]] and [[supercomputers]].

Because of the large number and variety of available [[Linux distribution]]s, they are all grouped under a single entry; see [[comparison of Linux distributions]] for a detailed comparison. There is also a variety of BSD and DOS operating systems, covered in [[comparison of BSD operating systems]] and [[comparison of DOS operating systems]]. For information on views of each operating system, see [[operating system advocacy]].
&lt;!-- NOTES TO EDITORS, PLEASE READ THIS
 - All tables in this article are meant to be sorted alphabetically
 - All tables should list the same operating systems. If you add an OS, please add it to ALL tables.
 - The unfixed bug count in the security table WAS updated automatically by User:SecuniBot. There WAS no
   need to update that column manually, except to add the link to the secunia.com page corresponding to
   an OS the first time. See below. The security table currently needs to be updated manually until this bot can be repaired/updated.
 - Please have a look at the conventions used in existing table entries when adding new data. E.g.
   the "Target system type" column should list systems types like "Server", "Workstation", "Personal computer",
   "Network Appliance", "Embedded system".
 - It's not necessary to list all architectures in the "supported architectures" columns. Just list the primary
   ones (maybe up to five) and add "some others" or "N others" or something like that if there are more.
   Specifically, its not necessary to add an arch to this list just because an experimental port exists.
   Listed archs should be fully supported.
 - The same goes for filesystems, just list the important ones.
 - Use "?" or the {inc} template for missing data, not "-". "-" is used to mean "none" / "n/a" in these tables.
 - Some systems that have been removed from this comparison by consensus on the talk page. Please refer
   to the discussion there before re-adding them: AmigaOS, BeOS, Reactos
 - Footnotes shall be grouped references for their respective tables. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing sources#List-defined references --&gt;
&lt;!-- SECUNIBOT IS NOT PERMITTED
This comment forbids the bot [[User:SecuniBot]] permission to update the ''unpatched vulnerabilities''
column of the Security table, until after the bot is updated to conform to the current Secunia URI scheme
and the current Security table format scheme. If the bot were to update an entry, it would have the format
| [http://secunia.com/product/&lt;number&gt;/ &lt;number&gt;] || &lt;date&gt;
Where &lt;number&gt; is any sequence of digits, and &lt;date&gt; is either '-' or a date in numeric format, i.e.
  [[&lt;number&gt;-&lt;number&gt;-&lt;number&gt;]]

while it should have the format
| [http://secunia.com/advisories/product/&lt;PRODUCT_NUMBER&gt;/ &lt;NUMBER_OF_UNPATCHED_VULNERABILITIES_LISTED_AS_Extremely critical&gt;]
| [http://secunia.com/advisories/product/&lt;PRODUCT_NUMBER&gt;/ &lt;NUMBER_OF_UNPATCHED_VULNERABILITIES_LISTED_AS_Highly critical&gt;]
| [http://secunia.com/advisories/product/&lt;PRODUCT_NUMBER&gt;/ &lt;NUMBER_OF_UNPATCHED_VULNERABILITIES_LISTED_AS_Moderately critical&gt;]
| [http://secunia.com/advisories/product/&lt;PRODUCT_NUMBER&gt;/ &lt;NUMBER_OF_UNPATCHED_VULNERABILITIES_LISTED_AS_Less critical&gt;]
| [http://secunia.com/advisories/product/&lt;PRODUCT_NUMBER&gt;/ &lt;NUMBER_OF_UNPATCHED_VULNERABILITIES_LISTED_AS_Not critical&gt;]{IF non-zero, then follow with oldest UNPATCHED_VULNERABILITY of this criticality}&lt;br&gt;[http://secunia.com/advisories/&lt;VULNERABILITY_NUMBER&gt;/ {{start date and age|&lt;YYYY&gt;|&lt;MM&gt;|&lt;DD&gt;|br=yes}}]
| [http://www.securityfocus.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi?c=12&amp;op=display_list&amp;vendor=&lt;VENDOR_NAME&gt;&amp;title=&lt;PRODUCT_TITLE&gt;&amp;version=&lt;VERSION_NUMBER_AS_LISTED_IN_GENERAL_INFORMATION_LATEST_STABLE_VERSION_COLUMN&gt; &lt;NUMBER_OF_VULNERABILITIES&gt;]&lt;br&gt;[http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/&lt;VULNERABILITY_NUMBER&gt; {{start date and age|&lt;YYYY&gt;|&lt;MM&gt;|&lt;DD&gt;|br=yes}}]

All other entries will be ignored. The current bot fetches the linked secunia.com page and counts the advisories
marked ''less critical'' or above. The footnote below the table that gives the ''last updated'' date is
also adjusted. The bot is run by [[User:Sperling]]. The source is available at [[User:SecuniBot/source]].
This bot has not been updated since 2006-08-27T07:40:31, nor has it's maintainer contributed since 2008-08-19T03:55:38. --&gt;

{{Reflist|group="t"|refs=
&lt;ref name="GUI"&gt;Operating systems where the GUI is not installed and turned on by default are often bundled with an implementation of the [[X Window System]], installation of which is usually optional.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="API"&gt;Most operating systems use proprietary APIs in addition to any supported standards.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="BSDX"&gt;NetBSD and OpenBSD include the [[X Window System]] as base install sets, managed in their respective main source repository, including local modifications. Packages are also provided for more up-to-date versions which may be less tested.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="WindowsFS"&gt;Windows can read and write with Ext2 and Ext3 file systems only when a driver from [http://www.fs-driver.org FS-driver] or [[Ext2Fsd]] is installed. However, using [[Explore2fs]], Windows can read from, but not write to, Ext2 and Ext3 file systems. Windows can also access ReiserFS through [http://p-nand-q.com/download/rfstool.html rfstool] and related programs.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="i686"&gt;only i686 CPU&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="AmigaOSinstaller"&gt;Amiga OS features since OS 2.0 version a standard centralized Install utility called [[AmigaOS#Workbench 2.0 user interface improvements|Installer]], which could be used by any software house to install programs. It works as a [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] language interpreter, and install procedures could be listed as simple text. AmigaOS can also benefit of a 3rd party copyrighted library called [[XAD (software)|XAD]] that is available for all POSIX ([[Unix]], [[Linux]], BSD, and for [[AmigaOS]], [[MorphOS]], etc.). This library is freely distributable and publicly available on [[Aminet]] Amiga centralized repository of all Open Source or Free programs and utilities. XAD.Library, complete with GUI Voodoo-X, is based on modules and capable to manage over 300 compression methods and package systems (Voodoo-X GUI supports 80 package systems), including those widely accepted as standards such as [[ZIP (file format)|.ZIP]], [[Cabinet (file format)|.CAB]], [[LHA (file format)|.LHA]], [[LZX (algorithm)|.LZX]], [[RPM Package Manager|.RPM]], etc.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="AmigaOSinstallation"&gt;A standard AmigaOS installation requires usually only few files (typically 3 to 10 files) to be copied in their appropriate directory, and libraries and language files for national localization to be put in their standard OS directories. Any Amiga user with some minimal experience knows where these files should be copied and could perform programs installations by hand.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="AmiUpdate"&gt;AmiUpdate is capable to update AmigaOS files and also all Amiga programs which are registered to use the same update program that is standard for Amiga. Updating AmigaOS requires only few libraries to be put in standard OS location (for example all libraries are stored in "Libs:" standard virtual device and absolute path finder for "Libs" directory, Fonts are all in "Fonts:" absolute locator, the files for language localization are all stored in "Locale:" and so on). This leaves Amiga users with a minimal knowledge of the system almost free to perform by hand the update of the system files.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NOTE:''' Linux systems may vary by distribution which specific program, or even 'command' is called, via the POSIX &lt;tt&gt;alias&lt;/tt&gt; function.  For example, if you wanted to use the DOS &lt;tt&gt;dir&lt;/tt&gt; to give you a directory listing with one detailed file listing per line you could use &lt;tt&gt;alias dir='ls -lahF'&lt;/tt&gt; (e.g. in a session configuration file).

{{Reflist|group="c"|refs=
&lt;ref name="cd"&gt;May be omitted. Simply entering the directory name will change to it.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="nice1"&gt;This feature is still in development, see [http://unix.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/FreeBSD/stable/2009-01/msg00316.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="nice2"&gt;The nice command utilizes the setpriority() system call, which affects I/O priority, see [https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man2/setpriority.2.html OS X man page] .&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking for granted an equal [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|moral status]] as [[person]]s, '''difference feminism''' asserts that there are differences between men and women but that no value judgment can be placed upon them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/carol-gilligan/|title = Carol Gilligan |website= Psychology's Feminist Voices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "difference feminism" developed during the "equality-versus-difference debate" in American feminism in the 1980s and 1990s,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=Joan|title=Deconstructing Equality-Versus-Difference: Or, the Uses of Post-structuralist Theory for Feminism|journal=Feminist Studies|date=1988|volume=14|issue=1|doi=10.2307/3177997|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; but subsequently fell out of favor and use. In the 1990s feminists addressed the binary logic of "difference" versus "equality" and moved on from it, notably with postmodern and/or deconstructionist approaches that either dismantled or did not depend on that dichotomy.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bock|first1=Gisela|last2=James|first2=Susan|title=Beyond Equality and Difference|date=1992|publisher=Routledge|isbn = 9780415079891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voet|first1=Rian|title=Feminism and Citizenship|date=1998|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd|location = London|isbn = 9781446228043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Difference feminism did not require a commitment to [[gender essentialism|essentialism]]. Most strains of difference feminism did not argue that there was a biological, inherent, ahistorical, or otherwise "essential" link between womanhood and traditionally feminine values, habits of mind (often called "ways of knowing"&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiebinger|first1=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science?|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or personality traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grande Jensen|first1=Pamela|title=Finding a New Feminism: Rethinking the Woman Question for Liberal Democracy|page=2 footnote 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These feminists simply sought to recognize that, in the present, women and men are significantly different and to explore the devalued "feminine" characteristics.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tandon|first1=Neeru|title=Feminism: A Paradigm Shift|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some strains of difference feminism, for example [[Mary Daly]]'s, argue not just that women and men were different, and had different values or different ways of knowing, but that women and their values were superior to men's.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; This viewpoint does not require essentialism, although there is ongoing debate about whether Daly's feminism is essentialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoagland|first1=Sarah Lucia|last2=Frye|first2=Marilyn|title=Feminist Interpretations of Mary Daly|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sandilands|first1=Catriona|title=The Good-Natured Feminist Ecofeminism and the Quest for Democracy|date=1999|pages=chapter 5: "Cyborgs and Queers"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Difference feminism was developed by feminists in the 1980s, in part as a reaction to popular liberal feminism (also known as "[[equality feminism]]"), which emphasized the similarities between women and men in order to argue for equal treatment for women. Difference feminism, although it still aimed at equality between men and women, emphasized the differences between men and women and argued that identicality or sameness are not necessary in order for men and women, and masculine and feminine values, to be treated equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voet|first1=Rian|title=Feminism and Citizenship|date=1998|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal feminism aimed to make society and law gender-neutral, since it saw recognition of gender difference as a barrier to rights and participation within liberal democracy, while difference feminism held that gender-neutrality harmed women "whether by impelling them to imitate men, by depriving society of their distinctive contributions, or by letting them participate in society only on terms that favor men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grande Jensen|first1=Pamela|title=Finding a New Feminism: Rethinking the Woman Question for Liberal Democracy|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Difference feminism drew on earlier nineteenth-century strains of thought, for example the work of German writer [[Elise Oelsner]], which held that not only should women be allowed into formerly male-only spheres and institutions (e.g. public life, science) but that those institutions should also be expected to change in a way that recognizes the value of traditionally devalued feminine ethics (like care [see [[ethics of care]]]). On the latter point, many feminists have re-read the phrase "difference feminism" in a way that asks "what difference does feminism make?" (e.g. to the practice of science) rather than "what differences are there between men and women"?&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Essentialism and Difference Feminism==
Some have argued that the thought of certain prominent second-wave feminists, like psychologist [[Carol Gilligan]] and radical feminist theologian [[Mary Daly]], is "essentialist." In philosophy essentialism is the belief that "(at least some) objects have (at least some) essential properties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accidental vs Essential Properties|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/essential-accidental/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of sexual politics essentialism is taken to mean that "women" and "men" have fixed essences or essential properties (e.g. behavioral or personality traits) that cannot be changed. However, essentialist interpretations of Daly and Gilligan have been questioned by some feminist scholars, who argue that charges of "essentialism" are often used more as terms of abuse than as theoretical critiques based on evidence,&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyes|first1=Cressida J.|title=Anti-Essentialism in Practice: Carol Gilligan and Feminist Philosophy|journal=Hypatia|date=1997|volume=13|issue=3|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1997.tb00009.x|pages=142–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braidotti|first1=Rosi|title="Essentialism" in Feminism and Psychoanalysis: A Critical Dictionary|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not accurately reflect Gilligan&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; or Daly's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suhonen|first1=Marja|title="Toward Biophilic Be-ing: Mary Daly's Feminist Metaethics and the Question of Essentialism" in Feminist Interpretations of Mary Daly|date=2000|publisher=Penn State University Press|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; views.

In [[linguistics]], the '''donor principle''' refers primarily to the observance of the  original spelling of a [[loanword]] from the original ("donor") language. This principle applies in particular to the standardization in the receiver language of [[exonym]]s when they are used in publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogeographics.org/sites/default/files/080205_D5.1_Exonyms%20guidelines%20synopsis.pdf|title= Exonyms guidelines synopsis |date= |website= |publisher= EuroGeoNames|access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Peter Jordan |author2=Milan Orožen Adamič |author3=Paul Woodman |title= Exonyms and the International Standardisation of Geographical Names |url= https://books.google.nl/books?id=NVReAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=%22exonym%22+%22donor+principle%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xVfZqoTJU5&amp;sig=rdggekWiaLi1VCHjqyswhpCxhN8&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB-sL0-_LPAhUoDcAKHW02Br0Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22exonym%22%20%22donor%20principle%22&amp;f=false|location= |publisher= |page= 11|date= 2007|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term donor principle is sometimes also used for the particular spelling of names of specific products, brands, institutions etc. chosen by their owner, founder, designer, etc., when it clashes with the official spelling rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Einstein's Blackboard''' is a [[blackboard]]&lt;ref name="blackboard"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/blackboard/einstein.htm | title=Bye-bye blackboard ... from Einstein and others | publisher=[[Museum of the History of Science]] | location=Oxford | accessdate=14 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which physicist [[Albert Einstein]] (1879–1955) used on 16 [[May 1931]] during his lectures while visiting the [[University of Oxford]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| contribution-url=http://geekatlas.com/photo/einsteins-blackboard-at | section=Einstein's Blackboard at Oxford's Museum of the History of Science | last=Garrett | first=C. | date=June 11, 2009 | url=http://geekatlas.com/ | title=The Geek Atlas | accessdate=14 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The blackboard is one of the most iconic objects in the collection of the [[Museum of the History of Science]] in [[Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Einstein's Blackboard – in Oxford's Museum of the History of Science | first=Jim | last=Bennett | authorlink=Jim Bennett (historian) | publisher=[[YouTube]] | accessdate=14 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/collections/imu-search-page/record-details/?TitInventoryNo=44725&amp;querytype=field&amp;thumbnails=on&amp;irn=9738 | first=Albert | last=Einstein | authorlink=Albert Einstein | title=Blackboard Used by Albert Einstein, Oxford, May 16, 1931 | work=MHS Collection Database Search | publisher=Museum of the History of Science | location=Oxford | date=1931 | accessdate=1 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The lecture in which the blackboard was used was the second of three, delivered at [[Rhodes House]] in [[South Parks Road]]. Einstein's visit to give the Rhodes Lectures, and also to receive an honorary [[Doctor of Science]] degree from Oxford University on 23 May 1931, was hosted by the physicist [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Frederick Lindemann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Ronald W. | last=Clark | authorlink=Ronald W. Clark | title=The Life and Times: Einstein – An Illustrated Biography | year=1984 | pages=255–256 | publisher=Wings Books | location=New York | isbn=0-517-14718-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein's first lecture was on [[Theory of relativity|relativity]], the second on [[cosmology]], and the third on [[unified field theory]]. All the lectures were delivered in [[German language|German]]. A brief report of the second lecture was given in ''[[The Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 18 May 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Our Astronomical Column | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | date=1931 | volume=127 | page=790 |doi=10.1038/127794a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A summary of all three lectures can be found in the Archives of the Oxford Museum for the History of Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/collections/search/display-narrative/?irn=9738&amp;index=3 | title=Printed Pamphlet Accompanying The Rhodes Lectures, Oxford | date=1931 | first=Albert | last=Einstein | authorlink=Albert Einstein | publisher=[[Museum of the History of Science, Oxford]] | location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blackboard was rescued with another by dons (including the chemist [[E. J. Bowen]], zoologist [[Gavin de Beer]], and historian of science [[Robert Gunther]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=A. E. | last=Gunther | series=Early Science in Oxford | volume=XV | title=Robert T. Gunther | publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford]] | date=1967 | pages=250, 436 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and formally donated by the [[Warden (college)|Warden]] of Rhodes House, Sir [[Francis James Wylie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=Einstein's Blackboard | work=Label in gallery | publisher=Museum of the History of Science | location=Oxford, UK | date=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Einstein's Blackboard | first=Mark | last=Callaghan | date=20 May 2011 | work=[[The Oxford Student]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The writing on the blackboard, although [[ephemeral]] in nature, is of historic interest because the equations displayed are taken from a model of the universe proposed by Einstein in May 1931 known as [[The Friedmann-Einstein universe]].&lt;ref name="einstein-1931"&gt;Einstein, A. 1931. Zum kosmologischen Problem der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie Sitzungsb.König. Preuss. Akad. 235-237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cor-2013"&gt;O’Raifeartaigh, C. and McCann, B. (2014) ‘Einstein’s cosmic model of 1931 revisited: an analysis and translation of a forgotten model of the universe’.Eur. Phys. J. (H) 39 (1), pp. 63–85. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.2192 Physics ArXiv preprint].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kragh-2013"&gt;Kragh, H. (2013). ‘Cyclic models of the relativistic universe: the early history’. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0932 Physics ArXiv 1308.0932].&lt;/ref&gt; The last three lines on the blackboard are estimates of the density of matter in the universe ''ρ'', the radius of the universe ''P''  and the timespan ''t'' of the expansion of the universe respectively ("L.J." on the blackboard indicates "[[light year]]s" in [[German language|German]]). It has recently been shown that these estimates contain a systematic numerical error.&lt;ref name="cor-2013"/&gt;

The blackboard is considered a "mutant" object or artefact in that it is very different from most of the objects in the collection of the museum (mainly scientific instruments such as [[astrolabe]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| contribution-url=http://jfgauvin2008.wordpress.com/2009/03/09/einsteins-blackboard/ | section=Einstein’s Blackboard as a Mutant Object | first=Jean-Francois | last=Gauvin | date=9 March 2009 | url=http://jfgauvin2008.wordpress.com/ | title=Carrière et vie professionnelle | publisher=[[WordPress]] | accessdate=14 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| contribution-url=http://scientificobjects.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/scientificobjectsPublic/index/Archive/Wandering-Seminar-Archive/Objects-Wandering-Seminar/20.html | section=Einstein’s Blackboard as a Mutant Artefact | url=http://scientificobjects.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ | title=History of Scientific Objects | location=Germany | publisher=International Max Planck Research Network | accessdate=14 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second blackboard used by Einstein during the lecture is also in the collection of the Museum of the History of Science, but is not on display. However it is of less interest because it was wiped clean after the lecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/collections/imu-search-page/record-details/?TitInventoryNo=11714&amp;querytype=field&amp;thumbnails=on&amp;irn=17883 | first=Albert | last=Einstein | title=Einstein Blackboard No.2, 1931 | work=MHS Collection Database Search | publisher=Museum of the History of Science | location=Oxford | date=1931 | accessdate=1 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein returned to Oxford again in 1932 and 1933 before he settled at [[Princeton University]] in the United States for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Andrew | last=Robinson | authorlink=W. Andrew Robinson | title=Einstein: A Hundred Years of Relativity | year=2005 | page=96 | publisher=[[Palazzo Editions]] | isbn=0-9545103-4-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The science of the blackboard==
It has recently been pointed out&lt;ref name="cor-2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kragh-2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ORaifeartaigh15"&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Raifeartaigh|first=C.|title=Einstein's blackboard and the Friedman-Einstein model of the cosmos|url=https://coraifeartaigh.wordpress.com/2015/12/22/einsteins-blackboard/|website=Antimatter|publisher=[[WordPress]]|date=22 December 2015|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the equations on the Oxford blackboard are taken directly from a key paper on relativistic cosmology written by Einstein in April 1931 and published in the Proceedings of the Royal Prussian Academy of Science on May 9 of that year.&lt;ref name="einstein-1931" /&gt; The paper, known as  [[The Friedmann-Einstein universe]], is of historic significance because it constituted the first scientific publication in which Einstein embraced the possibility of a cosmos of time-varying radius. In the paper,&lt;ref name="einstein-1931" /&gt; Einstein adopts Alexander Friedman’s 1922 analysis&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, A. 1922. Über die Krümmung des Raumes. Zeit. Physik. 10 : 377-386&lt;/ref&gt; of relativistic models of a universe of time-varying radius and positive curvature, but sets the cosmological constant to zero, declaring it redundant, predicting a universe that expands and contracts over time. (The work is sometimes known as the Friedman-Einstein model of the universe&lt;ref&gt;North, J.D. 1965. The Measure of the Universe: A History of Modern Cosmology . Oxford University Press p132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rindler, W. 1969. Essential Relativity: Special, General and Cosmological. Van Nostrand Reinhold Company New York p261&lt;/ref&gt;). With the use of Edwin Hubble’s observations&lt;ref&gt;Hubble, E. 1929. A relation between distance and radial velocity among extra-galactic nebulae. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 15: 168-173&lt;/ref&gt; of a linear redshift/distance relation for the spiral nebulae, Einstein extracts from his model estimates of ''ρ'' ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;−26&lt;/sup&gt; g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, ''P'' ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; light-years and ''t'' ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; years for the density of matter, the radius of the cosmos and the timespan of the cosmic expansion respectively. These values are displayed in the last three lines on the Oxford blackboard (although the units of measurement are not specifically stated for the density estimate, [[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|cgs]] units are implied by the other calculations).

==The role of the blackboard in clarifying an error==
It has also been noted&lt;ref name="cor-2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ORaifeartaigh15" /&gt; that the numerical estimates of cosmic parameters in Einstein’s 1931 paper – and on the blackboard – contain a systematic error. Analysis of the 1931 paper shows that, given the contemporaneous Hubble constant of 500&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;Mpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, Einstein's estimates of cosmic density, radius and timespan should have been ''ρ'' ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;−28&lt;/sup&gt; g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, ''P'' ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; light-years and ''t'' ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years respectively. One line on the blackboard, not included in the published paper, makes the nature of Einstein's error clear. In the fourth line on the blackboard, Einstein obtains a value of 10&lt;sup&gt;−53&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; for the quantity ''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, defined in the top line of the blackboard as ''D'' = (1/c). (1/P).(dP/dt), i.e., the [[Hubble constant]] divided by the speed of light. Simple calculation shows that the contemporaneous value of the Hubble constant in fact implied a value of ''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;−55&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; (or 10&lt;sup&gt;−51&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;) for this quantity. It appears that Einstein stumbled in converting megaparsecs to cm, giving a density of matter that was too high by a factor of a hundred, a cosmic radius that was too low by a factor of ten, and a timespan for the expansion that was too high by a factor of ten.&lt;ref name="cor-2013" /&gt; These errors were corrected in a later review of relativistic cosmology written by Einstein in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Einstein | first=A. | date=1945 | chapter=Appendix: On the cosmological problem | title=The Meaning of Relativity | publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] | location=Princeton | edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nottingham blackboard==
A blackboard used by Einstein in a public lecture at the [[University of Nottingham]] on 6 June 1930 was also preserved after the lecture and is now in the university's archives.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Anscombe, [http://blogs.nottingham.ac.uk/newsroom/2015/06/05/remembering-whenalbert-einstein-visited-the-university-and-was-late/ 'Remembering when ... Albert Einstein visited the university - and was late!'] (University of Nottingham, 5 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Encyclopedia of Chicago''''' is an historical [[reference work]] covering [[Chicago]] and the entire [[Chicago metropolitan area]] published by the [[University of Chicago Press]].  Released in October 2004, the work is the result of a ten-year collaboration between the [[Newberry Library]] and the [[Chicago Historical Society]].  It exists in both a [[hardcover]] print edition and an online format, known as the '''''Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago'''''.&lt;ref name=EOCNL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newberry.org/scholl/encyclopedia.html |title=The Encyclopedia of Chicago |accessdate=September 24, 2009 |publisher=[[Newberry Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206164225/http://www.newberry.org/scholl/encyclopedia.html |archivedate=December 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The print edition is 1117 pages and includes 1400 entries, 2000 biographical sketches, 250 significant business enterprise descriptions, and hundreds of maps.&lt;ref name=EOCWC/&gt;&lt;ref name=EOCNL/&gt;&lt;ref name=EOCUoCP/&gt;  Initially, the internet edition included 1766 entries, 1000 more images and sources.&lt;ref name=Cchetca/&gt;

The concept was fueled by other regional encyclopedias that had met with commercial success in 1980s and 1990s.  Eventually, the vision to create the book found initial financing from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].  The book was well received and became a [[bestseller]] during the 2004 Christmas season following its October 2004 release.  The following May the ''Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago'' was released. [[Northwestern University]] joined the Newberry Library/Chicago Historical Society collaboration to publish the internet edition.  The internet edition was the second of its kind for a U.S. city.

==Details==
Individual entries were compiled by [[historian]]s, [[graduate assistant]]s and [[author]]s.&lt;ref name=TWWWIOMW/&gt;  Most contributors were [[professor]]s.&lt;ref name=CFATZ/&gt;  About 600 people contributed entries at a rate of $.10/per word.&lt;ref name=TcCfstp/&gt;  The contributors consulted reliable [[secondary source]]s, such as [[newspaper]]s, to compile historical accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FBFAFA171559E8D&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=History sleuths dig up suburbs' hidden pasts|accessdate=September 24, 2009|date=June 29, 2003|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Vogt, Amanda|page=1, Metro section}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was edited by James R. Grossman, Ann Durkin Keating, and Janice L. Reiff.  At the time, Grossman was the vice president for research and education at the Newberry Library and visiting professor of history at the [[University of Chicago]].  Keating was a professor of history at [[North Central College]]. Reiff was an associate professor of history at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=EOCUoCP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/books/grossman/about.html|title=The Encyclopedia of Chicago|accessdate=September 24, 2009|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike resource compilation efforts for the cities that inspired this encyclopedia, the work was not bounded by the [[city limits]].  Instead, every suburb was provided an entry, as were each of Chicago's 77 official [[Community areas of Chicago|community areas]].  Entries ranged from 50 to 4000 words long.&lt;ref name=TcCfstp&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB42308EA5C72A8&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Tome chronicles Chicago from stockyards to pizza|accessdate=September 24, 2009|date=May 26, 1997|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Ritter, Jim|page=47, News section}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, the coverage of the subject matter expanded to include Southwest [[Michigan]] and [[Northwest Indiana]].&lt;ref name=WaphoC&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB42469817312CC&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Writing a perfect history of Chicago|accessdate=September 24, 2009|date=March 9, 2000|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Steinberg, Neil|page=40, Section 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Newberry Library describes the work as "one of the most significant historical projects undertaken in the last twenty years".&lt;ref name=EOCNL/&gt;

==History==
Inspired by encyclopedia compilation efforts of cities such as New York City, Indianapolis and Cleveland, Keating approached the Newberry Library in 1991 to strategize on how to best to study and teach Chicago history. Eventually she and Grossman agreed to prepare a funding request from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH).  Their initial proposal was declined, but after working with Grossman to refine the specifics of their proposal, the NEH accepted their idea.&lt;ref name=TWWWIOMW&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB426A534FBBE7C&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=The Way We Were, In One Million Words|accessdate=September 24, 2009|date=April 2, 1995|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Christiansen, Richard|page=2, Arts section}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IiTB/&gt; The book venture was originally announced in 1994 as a project funded by a NEH [[US$]]200,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|200000|1994|r=0}}}} today) grant.&lt;ref name=VHPMTCIC&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB4263BB73D65EB&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Vast History Project May Turn CD-ROM Into CD-Chicago|accessdate=September 24, 2009|date=November 25, 1994|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Pridmore, Jay|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The grant also included a $300,000 [[challenge grant]] to be met by Newberry Library for the first three years of work.&lt;ref name=TWWWIOMW/&gt; The original plan was to publish a hardcover book by 2001 and then to follow with what at the time was referred to vaguely as "hypermedia" in reference to possible internet and [[CD-ROM]] auxiliary products.&lt;ref name=VHPMTCIC/&gt;  After Grossman and Keating obtained the initial grant, Reiff, a computer technology expert, and encyclopedia veteran Carol J. Summerfield all became part of the team.&lt;ref name=TWWWIOMW/&gt;  The editors sought the advice of Chicago-area [[librarians]] who were organized into focus groups to determine the proper components for the planned publication.  The editors also organized into task forces of experts in dozens of specialized fields.&lt;ref name=IiTB/&gt;  Early on they sought the expertise of [[University of Chicago]] [[cartographer]] Michael P. Conzen, who helped develop 56 original maps.&lt;ref name=IiTB/&gt; Conzen is credited as the cartographic editor.&lt;ref name=EOCWC/&gt;

By 1997, the text had taken shape and the plan was that the average biographical entry would be 150 words.  The longest biographical entries, about 450 words, were written for former [[Chicago Mayor]]s [[Harold Washington]] and [[Richard J. Daley]].  Neither [[Richard M. Daley]] nor [[Michael Jordan]] had entries because only notable deceased persons were included.&lt;ref name=TcCfstp/&gt; By 1998, the editors had settled on the table of contents and begun the job of assigning, editing, fact-checking and re-editing the hundreds of entries, some of them as long as 4000 words.&lt;ref name=IiTB/&gt; By March 2000, 1100 of the targeted 1400 entries were completed.  Also, the growth of the internet had clarified the vision of an online version of the print edition.  In 2000, the final volume was expected to be 1300 pages set for release in fall 2002.  The internet version was expected the following year.&lt;ref name=WaphoC/&gt; By June 2001, nearly 1300 of the entries had been submitted and a third had been edited and reviewed for accuracy.  The effort had become a $2.5 million effort and was aspiring towards the success of earlier encyclopedic efforts projecting a fall 2003 publication of a 1.3-million-word 1300-page edition.  At this time, the final electronic form available through the Chicago Historical Society had been conceptualized.&lt;ref name=TCs/&gt;

==Public release==
By 2001, two editions of ''The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History'' (1987) had sold 24,000 copies; ''The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis'' (1994) had sold 9000 copies and ''[[The Encyclopedia of New York City]]'' (1995) had sold 70,000 (50,000 in its first year).  Hardcover versions of these works had sold for $59.95 and up.  The commercial success of these other regional encyclopedias made it clear that there is a market for such products.&lt;ref name=TCs&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0ECF19E3DB5844E5&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=The Chicago story - Book to show racial, ethnic, economic diversity of area |accessdate=September 24, 2009|date=June 13, 2001|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Reardon, Patrick T.|page=3, Tempo section}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several university presses released regional encyclopedic publications in 2004.  In April, [[Rutgers University Press]] published ''[[The Encyclopedia of New Jersey]]''. In September, the [[University of Nebraska Press]] published ''Encyclopedia of the Great Plains''. In October, the University of Chicago Press released ''The Encyclopedia of Chicago''. Additionally, [[Yale University Press]] was scheduled to publish both ''Encyclopedia of New England'' and the second edition of ''The Encyclopedia of New York City''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:EQUB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=105BEC236D99576A&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=UPs Get Hip to Encyclopedias|accessdate=September 24, 2009|date=October 11, 2004|work=Executive Quote and Information Service | first=Raya | last=Kuzyk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic edition===
At the time of the print release, the online version, known as the ''Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago'', was being developed to include additional features, which relied on [[hyperlink]]s, that were not available in the print edition.&lt;ref name=IiTB/&gt;  At the time, it was expected to be released by the Chicago Historical Society in April 2005.&lt;ref name=EOCNL/&gt; On May 11, the Electronic edition, which cost nearly $1 million to create and is continuously available for free to the public, was released.  It included hundreds of additional entries (bringing the total to 1766),&lt;ref name=Cchetca/&gt; more than 1000 additional images,&lt;ref name=VEoCgotW/&gt; video of historic figures and events, and extensive primary source material.&lt;ref name=VEoCgotW/&gt; The online version includes 1000 more sources than the print edition.&lt;ref name=Cchetca&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=10A077528727044A&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=City's colorful history enters the cyber age - Chicago encyclopedia to be offered online |accessdate=September 25, 2009|date=May 11, 2005|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|page=2, Metro section|author=McCarthy, Brendan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Web site includes many tables and maps that date to the 19th Century.&lt;ref name=Cchetca/&gt; [[Northwestern University]] media specialists developed the Web architecture for the electronic version.&lt;ref name=VEoCgotW&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=10A2638D0E32C904&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Vast Encyclopedia of Chicago goes on the Web // The price is right: free -- and online version has nifty new features|accessdate=September 25, 2009|date=May 11, 2005|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|page=10, News section|author=McNamee, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The electronic edition made Chicago the second major U.S. city (following Cleveland) with an extensive Internet encyclopedia dedicated to its history and its release was covered by newspapers throughout the [[Midwest]].&lt;ref name=Cchwbof&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:GPTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=10A7225A7545B410&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Chicago city history will be online, free|accessdate=September 25, 2009|date=May 19, 2005|work=[[Post-Tribune]]|page=A10, National section}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NCeofoe&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:DTHB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=10A48274544AF829&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=New Chicago encyclopedia offers free online edition - It is 2nd major city to offer historical information over the Internet|accessdate=September 25, 2009|date=May 23, 2005|work=[[Telegraph Herald]]|page=d2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The extra features of the online edition would have required 10,000 pages to produce in print-edition format.&lt;ref name=VEoCgotW/&gt; Initially, the online edition was a static version, but updates and adjustments were planned.&lt;ref name=Cchetca/&gt;

==Critical review==
''USA Today''' referred to it as a good [[coffee table book]].&lt;ref name=Ziotobtwmtm/&gt; ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' journalist Rick Kogan describes this as a massive undertaking with the natural foibles of the human element in it selections and accuracy, and by nature of its attempt to serve as a historical compilation an immediately dated product due to the dynamic nature of the city.  However, he feels it is sure to amaze its audience.&lt;ref name=CFATZ/&gt; A ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' reviewer describes it as a scholarly product that is "easily the most comprehensive reference book on the Chicago region ever published".&lt;ref name=IiTB/&gt; ''[[The State Journal-Register]]'', the [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], Illinois newspaper, reviewers complain that downstate cities and regions are neglected in the book.&lt;ref name=DIgfmie/&gt; A ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]'' review describes it as a book accurately "billed as the city's most definitive historical reference book".&lt;ref name=NbitwocslFCJtfgcCdhlws/&gt;  The ''[[Peoria Journal Star]]'' notes that although there are complaints about omissions and underserved topics, the online version should quell the demands for further knowledge.&lt;ref name=NbbwtoCcp/&gt;

The online version was noted for its "large number of tables and maps that date to the 19th Century" by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.&lt;ref name=Cchetca/&gt; [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]], Iowa's ''[[Telegraph Herald]]'' newspaper and [[Indiana]]'s ''[[Post-Tribune]]'' referenced an [[Associated Press]] press release that described the online version as a compilation assembled "with more than Chicagoans in mind".&lt;ref name=Cchwbof/&gt;&lt;ref name=NCeofoe/&gt; The ''Chicago Tribune'' described the online version as an extension of "the most comprehensive reference book on the Chicago region ever published" that is unlimited by physical bounds.&lt;ref name=VEoCgotW/&gt;

''[[Journal of American History]]'' along with the website History Matters: The U.S. Survey Course on the Web published a review by [[University of Southern California]] professor Philip J. Ethington that spoke glowingly about both versions of the encyclopedia describing it as "one of the finest collective works (with 633 listed authors) of North American historical scholarship of our era".  They praised it for its breadth and coherence.  The online version was noted for its meticulous [[hyperlink]]ing.  The online review was cursory in the sense that it did not realize the expansion of the online version.  However, the review notes that the online version provides "powerful and substantive" interactive resources that are not possible in the print edition.  The review is especially respectful of the cartographic contributions, which it describes in detail.  It dismisses the alphabetical structure of the online version as an unnecessary complication.  The review also complains about biographical omissions that necessitate extensive navigation to related articles.  The review felt some of the online foibles left open the possibility that the production might get overshadowed by future ventures that leverage the electronic possibilities more fully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=25498678&amp;site=ehost-live|title=Web Site Reviews: The Encyclopedia of Chicago (subscription required)|author=Ethington, Philip J.|accessdate=October 30, 2009|date=June 2007|publisher=[[Journal of American History]]|pages=363&amp;ndash;365|volume= 94|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' reviewed the ''Encyclopedia'' along with several of its peers and mentioned early in the review that the advent of online encyclopedias makes the works much easier to correct and update. However, the availability of online encyclopedias diminished the significance of the print editions according to the review because it made gifting them less significant and it reduced sales at libraries.  The review also noted that the online approach is becoming so successful that the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] has produced the online-only ''[[New Georgia Encyclopedia]]'', which started as a 300-article venture and has blossomed to a 1300-article work.  However, they noted that when the ''Encyclopedia of Chicago'' was first released that the local media supported the book; some Chicago [[disc jockey]]s read passages from it on air. It enjoyed successful marketing as both a popular gift item and a must-have for local historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=19635677&amp;site=ehost-live|title=Hot Type (subscription required)|accessdate=October 30, 2009|date=February 3, 2006|work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|page=A22|author=Howard, Jennifer|volume=52|issue=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The encyclopedia is composed of 1117 pages that feature over 1400 entries by more than 600 contributors.&lt;ref name=IiTB&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=1052A01D20A0ED74&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=It's in The Book // Everything you ever wanted to know about Chicago but didn't know whom to ask . .|accessdate=September 24, 2009|date=September 9, 2004|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|page=16, News section|author=McNamee, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, it includes 442 maps, more than 400 vintage photographs,&lt;ref name=NbitwocslFCJtfgcCdhlws&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:ADHB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=105E66F67056B8CC&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=New book is the word on city, suburban lore From Cracker - Jack to first golf course, Chicago's diverse history linked with - suburbs |accessdate=September 24, 2009|date=October 6, 2004|work=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]|page=1, News section|author=Pyke, Marni}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 250 sketches of "historically significant business enterprises",&lt;ref name=CFATZ&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=1061337D34AA6D03&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Chicago - From 'Abolitionism' To 'Zoroastrians' - An amusing, enlightening--and occasionally frustrating--guide to the city and its environs |accessdate=September 24, 2009|date=October 31, 2004|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|page=1, Books section|author=Kogan, Rick}}&lt;/ref&gt; a dictionary of Chicago-area businesses, a biographical dictionary and a 21-page [[timeline]] that traces the history of Chicago from 1630 to 2000.&lt;ref name=EOCUoCP/&gt;&lt;ref name=IiTB/&gt;

The 1400-entry main alphabetical section of the ''Encyclopedia'' covers all Chicago neighborhoods, suburbs, and ethnic groups as well as the major [[cultural institution]]s.  Topics covered include technology and science, architecture, religions, immigration, transportation, business history, labor, music, health and medicine. It is considered the most geographical diverse city encyclopedia of its kind because it fully encompasses the [[suburb]]s in eight of the region's counties.&lt;ref name=EOCNL/&gt; 386 thumbnail maps of neighborhoods and municipalities are complemented by 400 black-and-white photographs plus hundreds of color photographs and thematic maps.&lt;ref name=EOCNL/&gt;&lt;ref name=EOCUoCP/&gt; There are separate lengthy interpretive essays woven into the alphabetical section on topics such as the built environment, literary images of Chicago, and the city's sports culture. The Encyclopedia includes a 2000-entry comprehensive biographical dictionary and a detailed listing of approximately 250 of the city's historically significant business enterprises. A color insert features a timeline of Chicago history and photo essays exploring nine pivotal years in this history.&lt;ref name=EOCNL/&gt;  The photo essays feature the city’s urban art and artifacts.&lt;ref name=EOCUoCP/&gt;

The '''Gagasan Sejahtera''' (English: ''Ideas of Prosperity'', [[abbreviation|abbrev]]: '''GS''') is an informal coalition of opposition [[Islamism|Islamist]] political parties which promote the "ideas of peace" in Malaysia.

[[Image:Gai-uron-120764.jpg|right|thumb|260px|Introduction of Gai Luron from an origin panel.&lt;ref name="no1"/&gt;]]
'''''Gai-Luron''''' is a [[France|French]] [[comics]] series about a melancholic [[basset hound]], Gai-Luron, created on July 12, 1964 by [[Gotlib]].&lt;ref name="no1"&gt;''Gai-Luron ou la joie de vivre'', n°1, p1. Footnote of date of creation by Gotlib&lt;/ref&gt; Originally published in the [[Franco-Belgian comics]] magazines ''Vaillant'' and ''[[Pif Gadget]]'', the character joined ''Nanar, Jujube et Piette'', which Gotlib had drawn since 1962, but eventually headlined a hit series of its own.&lt;ref name="lambiek"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lambiek Comiclopedia|title=Gotlib|url=http://lambiek.net/artists/g/gotlib.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album collection series began were released from 1975, and the second album, ''Gai-Luron en écrase méchamment'' was awarded the prize for [[Angoulême International Comics Festival Prize for Best Comic Book#1970s|French comical work]] at the [[Angoulême International Comics Festival|Angoulême]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="toutenBD-1976"&gt;{{Cite web|last=ToutEnBD|title=Le palmarès 1976|url=http://www.toutenbd.com/article.php3?id_article=848|language=French|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313075212/http://www.toutenbd.com/article.php3?id_article=848|archivedate=2007-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
It follows the [[anthropomorphic]] [[dog]] Gai-Luron (whose name can be roughly translated as "Jolly Fellow", which contrasts with Gai-Luron's generally [[apathetic]] behaviour), his girlfriend Belle-Lurette and his friend Jujube the [[fox]].

The plot sometimes involves Gai-Luron and Jujube reading their [[fan mail]], which is almost always written by the same reader, a little boy named Jean-Pierre Liégeois, or else a friend or relative of his.

==Bibliography==
Gai-Luron's adventures were published in 10 volumes between 1975 and 1982, and a last one, ''La bataille navale...ou Gai-Luron en slip'', was published as Gotlib's goodbye to the comic strip scene in 1986.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5393">In [[computer science]], and in particular [[functional programming]], a '''hylomorphism''' is a [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] function, corresponding to the [[function composition|composition]] of an [[anamorphism]] (which first builds a set of results; also known as 'unfolding') followed by a [[catamorphism]] (which then [[fold (higher-order function)|folds]] these results into a final [[return value]]). Fusion of these two recursive computations into a single recursive pattern then avoids building the intermediate data structure. This is an example of [[deforestation (computer science)|deforestation]], a program optimization strategy. A related type of function is a '''metamorphism''', which is a catamorphism followed by an anamorphism.

==Formal definition==

A hylomorphism &lt;math&gt;h : A \rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt; can be defined in terms of its separate anamorphic and catamorphic parts.

The anamorphic part can be defined in terms of a [[arity|unary]] function &lt;math&gt;g : A \rightarrow B \times A&lt;/math&gt; defining the list of elements in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; by repeated application (''"unfolding"''), and a [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] &lt;math&gt;p : A \rightarrow \text{Boolean}&lt;/math&gt; providing the terminating condition.

The catamorphic part can be defined as a combination of an initial value &lt;math&gt;c \in C&lt;/math&gt; for the fold and a binary [[Operation (mathematics)|operator]] &lt;math&gt;\oplus : B \times C \rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt; used to perform the fold.

Thus a hylomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;
h\,a = \begin{cases}
 c &amp; \mbox{if } p\,a
 \\b \oplus h\,a' \,\,\,where \,(b, a') = g\,a &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
 \end{cases}
 &lt;/math&gt;
may be defined (assuming appropriate definitions of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; &amp; &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;).

===Notation===
An abbreviated notation for the above hylomorphism is &lt;math&gt;h = [\![(c, \oplus),(g, p)]\!]&lt;/math&gt;.

==Hylomorphisms in practice==

===Lists===
[[List (computing)|Lists]] are common data structures as they naturally reflect linear computational processes.  These processes arise in repeated ([[Iteration|iterative]]) function calls.  Therefore, it is sometimes necessary to generate a temporary list of intermediate results before reducing this list to a single result.

One example of a commonly encountered hylomorphism is the canonical [[factorial]] function.

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
factorial :: Integer -&gt; Integer
factorial n
  | n == 0 = 1
  | n &gt; 0 = n * factorial (n - 1)
&lt;/source&gt;

In the previous example (written in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], a [[purely functional programming language]]) it can be seen that this function, applied to any given valid input, will generate a linear call tree [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a list. For example, given ''n'' = 5 it will produce the following:

 factorial 5 = 5 * (factorial 4) = 120
 factorial 4 = 4 * (factorial 3) = 24
 factorial 3 = 3 * (factorial 2) = 6
 factorial 2 = 2 * (factorial 1) = 2
 factorial 1 = 1 * (factorial 0) = 1
 factorial 0 = 1

In this example, the anamorphic part of the process is the generation of the call tree which is isomorphic to the list &lt;code&gt;[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]&lt;/code&gt;. The catamorphism, then, is the calculation of the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of the [[element (mathematics)|elements]] of this list. Thus, in the notation given above, the factorial function may be written &lt;math&gt;\text{factorial} = [\![(1,\times),(g, p)]\!]&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;g\ n = (n, n - 1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p\ n = (n = 0)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Trees===

However, the term 'hylomorphism' does not apply solely to functions acting upon isomorphisms of lists. For example, a hylomorphism may also be defined by generating a non-linear call tree which is then collapsed. An example of such a function is the function to generate the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[term (mathematics)|term]] of the [[Fibonacci sequence]].

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 fibonacci :: Integer -&gt; Integer
 fibonacci n
   | n == 0 = 0
   | n == 1 = 1
   | n &gt; 1 = fibonacci (n - 2) + fibonacci (n - 1)
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Image:Fib 4.png|thumb|300px|Call tree for &lt;code&gt;fibonacci 4&lt;/code&gt;.]]

This function, again applied to any valid input, will generate a call tree which is non-linear. In the example on the right, the call tree generated by applying the &lt;code&gt;fibonacci&lt;/code&gt; function to the input &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt;.

This time, the anamorphism is the generation of the call tree isomorphic to the tree with [[leaf node]]s &lt;code&gt;0, 1, 1, 0, 1&lt;/code&gt; and the catamorphism the [[summation]] of these leaf nodes.

'''iStock''' is an online [[royalty free]], [[international]] [[microstock photography|micro stock photography]] provider based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The firm offers millions of [[photos]], [[illustrations]], [[clip art]], [[Digital video|video]]s and [[Digital audio|audio]] tracks. Images cost between 1 and 3 credits,  with the price of credits ranging from $10.00 to $0.22 depending on volume purchased and subscription plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istockphoto.com/plans-and-pricing http://www.istockphoto.com/plans-and-pricing]  Company pricing page&lt;/ref&gt; Artists, [[designers]] and [[photographers]] worldwide contribute their work to iStock collections in return for royalties.  Nearly half a million new [[photos]], [[illustrations]], [[video]]s and audio files, are added each month.

== History ==

The company was founded by [[Bruce Livingstone]] in May 2000, as iStockphoto, a free stock imagery website supported by Livingstone's web development firm, Evolvs Media, It began charging money in 2001 and has been profitable since then.&lt;ref name="ST-05-28-07"&gt;Kim Peterson, [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003724590_istockphoto28.html "Microstock photography represents a new business model"], ''Seattle Times'', May 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 9, 2006 the firm was acquired by [[Getty Images]] for $50 million USD. Livingstone promised that the site would continue "functioning independently with the benefits of Getty Images, yet, very importantly for them and us, autonomy. "&lt;ref name=Marketwire&gt;{{cite web|title=iStockphoto Joins Getty Images|url=http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/istockphoto-joins-getty-images-as-explosive-growth-continues-expansion-into-social-media-nyse-gyi-579577.htm|publisher=Marketwire|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 18, 2006 the site experienced the first benefits of the new ownership:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istockphoto.com/article_view.php?ID=217 istockphoto.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015170446/http://www.istockphoto.com/article_view.php?ID=217 |date=2006-10-15 }} &amp;ndash; Language features announcement&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Controlled vocabulary]] keyword taxonomy borrowed from Getty Images.

As of March 31, 2007, [[iStockpro]] closed. iStockpro was a more expensive version of iStockphoto that was never as popular as iStockphoto, and became redundant after the acquisition by Getty Images.

On April 1, 2008 Getty Images disclosed, as part of its agreement to be sold to a private equity firm, that iStockphoto's revenue in 2007 was $71.9 million USD of which $20.9 million (29%) was paid to contributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.istockphoto.com/forum_messages.php?threadid=67521 |title=iStock contributors make $21 million in 2007 |publisher=iStockphoto Forums |accessdate=2008-04-01 |date=2008-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405183450/http://www.istockphoto.com/forum_messages.php?threadid=67521 |archivedate=2008-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Contributors ==

Contributing photographers apply (via a short quiz regarding policies, requirements, basic photographic knowledge, and legal issues) before they are eligible to upload their images. The applicant's sample images are screened for quality and suitability before being approved.

Contributors receive a commission of between 15% and 40% of each sale, depending on whether or not they are "exclusive", and various other factors.

In an address to its community entitled "2008: A Year in Review and a Look Ahead″,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istockphoto.com/forum_messages.php?threadid=80935 2008: A Year in Review and a Look Ahead] &amp;ndash; Executive Forum Post&lt;/ref&gt; the firm's CEO mentioned that the company was paying out ‘almost’ $1.1 million per week in royalty payments to contributors.

== Purchasing and use ==
Each approved image is added to the searchable online database, where it can be found by purchasers.  Files can be downloaded immediately, and used in almost anything. The basic license agreement prohibits some uses, such as [[web templates]], [[print on demand]], adult materials, etc. Print runs over 500,000 must pay additional royalties. Extended licenses are available for purchase to cover needs not met by the basic license agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istockphoto.com/license_purchaser.php Extended License Options] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509155246/http://www.istockphoto.com/license_purchaser.php |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
[[File:Roommate poster.jpg|thumb|right|This background of a movie poster for the 2011 film ''[[The Roommate]]'' was provided by iStockphoto. The image is that of the Christy Administration building at [[Southwestern College (Kansas)|Southwestern College]]. The college believes this image was used without their permission.]]

===Pricing===
Since iStockphoto's launch in 2000, purchase prices have slowly increased, from initially bartered (based on accumulated contributions),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://istockphoto.com/ |title=iStockphoto.com - The SOURCE for free Royalty Free Stock Photography and Illustration |date=7 April 2000 |publisher= |accessdate=28 October 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000407101943/http://istockphoto.com/ |archivedate=7 April 2000 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to $.25 and then $.50,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030207225936/http://www.istockphoto.com/about2.php web.archive.org] February 7, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently tiered at $1, $2 and $3,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050510230431/http://istockphoto.com/file_closeup.php?id=142016 web.archive.org] May 10, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; to a higher-cost tiered pricing of $1, $3, $5 and $10 or more for extra-high resolution,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060203033452/http://istockphoto.com/index.php web.archive.org] February 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; to today's current pricing scheme where images cost between 1 and 250 credits, and credits sell for $9 each or from $8 to $5.81 each in bundles of 3 to 3000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.istockphoto.com/plans-and-pricing|title=Download Video and Images: Buy Credits and Subscriptions - iStock|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Best rates for photos, vectors and illustrations are available through monthly or annual subscriptions.

===Ownership of material===
The 2011 film ''[[The Roommate]]'' obtained photos from iStockPhoto for its promotional material. One of the photos used as its backdrop was the Christy Administration Building from [[Southwestern College (Kansas)|Southwestern College]] in [[Winfield, Kansas]]. The college administration voiced concern that permission to use the photograph of the building was not properly obtained and is investigating the legality of its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.winfieldcourier.com/articles/2010/12/03/news/news/doc4cf932cdb33af858348853.txt|publisher = [[The Winfield Daily Courier]]|title = Image of SC building on movie poster|date = December 3, 2010|first = Allen|last = Twitchell|accessdate = January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of February 8, 2011, no lawsuits have been filed but discussions continue to take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winfieldcourier.com/articles/2011/02/08/news/news/doc4d5183cc7aa41324106218.txt|publisher=[[The Winfield Daily Courier]]|title=Movie poster image remains a concern for SC administration|first=Allen|last=Twitchell|date=February 8, 2011|accessdate=February 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== iStockvideo ==
On July 31, 2006 iStockphoto announced the development of a new branch, iStockvideo, to sell stock [[video]] clips in a variety of formats from web-size, through [[NTSC]] and [[PAL]] up to [[HDV]] and [[High-definition video|HD]] sizes. The collection is slated to open on September 5, 2006, and clips (between 5 and 30 seconds) will range in cost from $5 USD to $50 USD, based on resolution. As of February 9, 2010 the video collection contains over 250,000 videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.istockphoto.com/forum_messages.php?threadid=175161|title=Forums - iStockvideo - 250,000 videos|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Videos are not available as part of the images pricing or subscription arrangements.

This new branch of iStockphoto competes with motion stock collections already available from companies such as [[Getty Images]], Artbeats, and Veer.

== iStockalypse event ==
The iStockalypse was founded in 2005, as an official multi-day iStock photography event held several times a year for contributing artists and photographers .&lt;ref&gt;http://www.istockalypse.com/What.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the first event in Las Vegas, iStock has visited [[Seattle]], [[Boston]], [[Ljubljana]], [[Prague]], [[Austin]], [[Barcelona]], [[Marseilles]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Malta]], [[Berlin]], [[Calgary]], [[Istanbul]], [[Cannes]], [[Tokyo]], [[London]], [[Milan]], [[Singapore]], [[Sao Paulo]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[Paris]]. In March 2015 the event&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.istockalypse.com/CurrentLypse.aspx?lypse_id=11|title=iStockalypse - Dubai|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was organized in Dubai to get authentic, local shots of the city and its people.

{{Formation of Malaysia}}
The '''Independence of Singapore Agreement 1965''' was an [[Treaty|agreement]] between the Government of [[Malaysia]] and the Government of [[Singapore]] on 7 August 1965 that granted [[independence]] to Singapore. The Singapore Act 1966 followed the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1966/29/pdfs/ukpga_19660029_en.pdf Singapore Act 1966]&lt;/ref&gt;  The agreement included a Proclamation on Singapore to be made by Malaysian Prime Minister [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]]; a different [[Proclamation of Singapore]] was made by Singapore prime minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]]. 

As a result of the agreement, Singapore achieved full independence from Malaysia with effect from 9 August 1965.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7289">In [[mathematics]] and particularly in [[dynamic systems]], an '''initial condition''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baumol |first=William J. |authorlink=William Baumol |title=Economic Dynamics : An Introduction |location=London |publisher=Collier-Macmillan |edition=3rd |year=1970 |isbn=0-02-306660-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp.160}} in some contexts called a '''seed value''', is a value of an evolving variable at some point in time designated as the initial time (typically denoted ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0). For a system of [[order (differential equation)|order]] ''k'' (the number of time lags in [[discrete time]], or the order of the largest derivative in [[continuous time]]) and [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]] ''n'' (that is, with ''n'' different evolving variables, which together can be denoted by an ''n''-dimensional [[coordinate vector]]), generally ''nk'' initial conditions are needed in order to trace the system's variables forward through time. 

In both [[differential equation]]s in continuous time and [[difference equation]]s in discrete time, initial conditions affect the value of the dynamic variables ([[state variable]]s) at any future time. In continuous time, the problem of finding a [[closed form solution]] for the state variables as a function of time and of the initial conditions is called the [[initial value problem]]. A corresponding problem exists for discrete time situations. While a closed form solution is not always possible to obtain, future values of a discrete time system can be found by iterating forward one time period per iteration, though rounding error may make this impractical over long horizons.

==Linear system==

===Discrete time===

A linear [[matrix difference equation]] of the homogeneous (having no constant term) form &lt;math&gt;X_{t+1}=AX_t&lt;/math&gt; has closed form solution &lt;math&gt;X_t=A^tX_0&lt;/math&gt; predicated on the vector &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt; of initial conditions on the individual variables that are stacked into the vector; &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt; is called the vector of initial conditions or simply the initial condition, and contains ''nk'' pieces of information, ''n'' being the dimension of the vector ''X'' and ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 being the number of time lags in the system. The initial conditions in this linear system do not affect the qualitative nature of the future behavior of the state variable ''X''; that behavior is [[stability (mathematics)|stable]] or unstable based on the [[eigenvalue]]s of the matrix ''A'' but not based on the initial conditions.

Alternatively, a dynamic process in a single variable ''x'' having multiple time lags is 

:&lt;math&gt;x_t=a_1x_{t-1} +a_2x_{t-2}+\cdots +a_kx_{t-k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the dimension is ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and the order is ''k'', so the necessary number of initial conditions to trace the system through time, either iteratively or via closed form solution, is ''nk''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k''. Again the initial conditions do not affect the qualitative nature of the variable's long-term evolution. The solution of this equation is found by using its [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors#Dynamic equations|characteristic equation]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda^k-a_1\lambda^{k-1} -a_2\lambda^{k-2}-\cdots -a_{k-1}\lambda-a_k=0&lt;/math&gt; to obtain the latter's ''k'' solutions, which are the [[characteristic value]]s &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1, \dots , \lambda_k,&lt;/math&gt; for use in the solution equation

:&lt;math&gt;x_t=c_1\lambda _1^t+\cdots + c_k\lambda _k^t.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the constants &lt;math&gt;c_1, \dots , c_k&lt;/math&gt; are found by solving a system of ''k'' different equations based on this equation, each using one of ''k'' different values of ''t'' for which the specific initial condition &lt;math&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt; Is known.

===Continuous time===

A differential equation system of the first order with ''n'' variables stacked in a vector ''X'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dX}{dt}=AX.&lt;/math&gt;

Its behavior through time can be traced with a closed form solution conditional on an initial condition vector &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt;. The number of required initial pieces of information is the dimension ''n'' of the system times the order ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 of the system, or ''n''. The initial conditions do not affect the qualitative behavior (stable or unstable) of the system.

A single ''k''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order linear equation in a single variable ''x'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^{k}x}{dt^k}+a_{k-1}\frac{d^{k-1}x}{dt^{k-1}}+\cdots +a_1\frac{dx}{dt} +a_0x=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the number of initial conditions necessary for obtaining a closed form solution is the dimension ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 times the order ''k'', or simply ''k''. In this case the ''k'' initial pieces of information will typically not be different values of the variable ''x'' at different points in time, but rather the values of ''x'' and its first ''k''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1 derivatives, all at some point in time such as time zero. The initial conditions do not affect the qualitative nature of the system's behavior. The [[Characteristic equation (of difference equation)|characteristic equation]] of this dynamic equation is &lt;math&gt;\lambda^k+a_{k-1}\lambda^{k-1}+\cdots +a_1\lambda +a_0=0,&lt;/math&gt; whose solutions are the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|characteristic value]]s &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1,\dots , \lambda_k;&lt;/math&gt; these are used in the solution equation

:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=c_1e^{\lambda_1t}+\cdots + c_ke^{\lambda_kt}.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation and its first ''k'' – 1derivatives form a system of ''k'' equations that can be solved for the ''k'' parameters &lt;math&gt;c_1, \dots , c_k,&lt;/math&gt; given the known initial conditions on ''x'' and its ''k'' – 1 derivatives' values at some time ''t''.

==Nonlinear systems==

[[Nonlinear system]]s can exhibit a substantially richer variety of behavior than linear systems can. In particular, the initial conditions can affect whether the system diverges to infinity or whether it [[convergence (mathematics)|converges]] to one or another [[attractor]] of the system. Each attractor, a (possibly disconnected) region of values that some dynamic paths approach but never leave, has a (possibly disconnected) [[basin of attraction]] such that state variables with initial conditions in that basin (and nowhere else) will evolve toward that attractor. Even nearby initial conditions could be in basins of attraction of different attractors (see for example [[Newton's method#Basins of attraction]]).

Moreover, in those nonlinear systems showing [[chaos theory|chaotic behavior]], the evolution of the variables exhibits [[sensitive dependence on initial conditions]]: the iterated values of any two very nearby points on the same [[strange attractor]], while each remaining on the attractor, will diverge from each other over time. Thus even on a single attractor the precise values of the initial conditions make a substantial difference for the future positions of the iterates. This feature makes accurate [[Simulation#Computer simulation|simulation]] of future values difficult, and impossible over long horizons, because stating the initial conditions with exact precision is seldom possible and because rounding error is inevitable after even only a few iterations from an exact initial condition.

'''John Tolos''', [[nickname]]d '''"The Golden Greek"''', (September 18, 1930 – May 28, 2009&lt;ref name=Death/&gt;) was a [[Greeks|Greek]]-[[Canadians|Canadian]] [[professional wrestler]], and [[professional wrestling manager]].

==Professional wrestling career==
John was born on September 18, 1930 in Hamilton, Ontario to [[Greeks|Greek]] parents, Nicolaos and Evangelia (Evangeline) Tolos. During the 1950s and 60s, Tolos was part of the Canadian Wrecking Crew with his brother [[Chris Tolos]]. On December 28, 1963, John and Chris captured the [[WWWF United States Tag Team Championship]] in [[Teaneck, New Jersey]] in two straight falls from [[Gorilla Monsoon]] and [[Killer Kowalski]]. While both teams were heels at the time, the Tolos Brothers did a television interview prior to the title match, "looking forward" to seeing all of their fans in Teaneck. That night, they were cheered throughout. As a vicious heel known as the "Golden Greek", Tolos also engaged in a long time rivalry with [[Freddie Blassie|"Classy" Freddie Blassie]] in the [[Gene LeBell|LeBell]] family's [[List of NWA territories|Los Angeles territory]], often feuding over the [[NWA Americas Heavyweight Championship|Americas Championship]].&lt;ref name=pencil&gt;"Classy" Freddie Blassie with Keith Elliot Greenberg, ''Listen, You Pencil Neck Geeks'', (WWE Books, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolos joined the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) for a brief stint in mid-1991 as Coach (a classic [[coach (sport)|coach]], whistle and all), managing [[Beverly Brothers|The Beverly Brothers]] and [[Curt Hennig|"Mr. Perfect" Curt Hennig]], replacing Hennig's former manager [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby "The Brain" Heenan]], who was then moving into a full-time broadcaster's role.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia65"&gt;{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=65|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|DK]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a back injury sidelined Hennig for more than a year, Tolos was replaced by [[Lanny Poffo|The Genius]] as The Beverly Brothers' manager and departed the WWF.

Tolos then had a run in Herb Abrams' [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams)|Universal Wrestling Federation]], managing [[Bob Orton, Jr.|Cowboy Bob Orton]], [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]] and The Power Twins as well as serving as color commentator on the UWF's ''Fury Hour'' program.

==Death==
Tolos died in [[Los Angeles, California]] on May 29, 2009. His death was from [[kidney failure]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-john-tolos1-2009jun01,0,5561561.story John Tolos dies at 78; notorious wrestling villain known as the Golden Greek] - ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Retrieved on 2009-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt; following a series of [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]s and [[stroke]]s.&lt;ref name=Death/&gt;

==Cricket==
In July 1845, aged 18, only 5&amp;nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;[[inch|in]] and weighing just {{convert|7|stone|kg}},&lt;ref name=survival/&gt; he made his first-class debut for Sussex against MCC, taking 6 wickets in the first innings and three in the second.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/541726.html Scorecard], Sussex v Kent. 3,4,5 July 1845&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[All-England Eleven]] in 1846, moving allegiance to the [[United All-England Eleven]] in 1852.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  He was engaged to marry [[George Parr (cricketer)|George Parr]]'s sister Annie in 1849, but she died before the wedding, and he never married.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

Initially a fast [[roundarm bowling|roundarm bowler]], before [[overarm bowling]] was permitted, his pace slowed in later years so he bowled medium pace; he also bowled slow [[underarm bowling|underarm]]. While bowling fast, he took on average nearly 10 [[wicket]]s in each game.&lt;ref name=CIprofile/&gt; In 1850, when he was playing for the South against the North at [[Lord's]], his off-cutter technique won him 10 wickets in the second innings, all clean bowled (still the only instance of all ten wickets being taken "bowled" in any first-class match).&lt;ref name=CIprofile/&gt; He was also a competent batsman, and scored two first-class centuries, the first, exactly 100, against Kent at Tunbridge Wells in 1849, and in 1855 he notched up 148 against Yorkshire, the only first-class century scored in 1855.&lt;ref name=CIprofile/&gt;

He played almost all of his cricket in England, mostly for Sussex, but once for Kent and thrice for Middlesex.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  He travelled with a touring team led by [[George Parr (cricketer)|George Parr]] to Canada and the US in 1859, where eight matches in [[Montreal]], [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] were won easily.&lt;ref name=survival/&gt;

Of moderate height, he was nicknamed the "Little Wonder" after [[Little Wonder (horse)|the winner]] of [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] in 1840, and later the "Cardinal".&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  He was said to be the best all-rounder of his day.&lt;ref name=CIprofile/&gt;  In all, he took 1,109 first-class wickets with a [[bowling average]] of 10.32&lt;!--according to CricketArchive; profile in ESPNcricifo says bowling average of 6.66--&gt;.  He scored 4,140 first-class runs with a [[batting average]] of 14.12, an average which was very good for the time.&lt;ref name=CAprofile/&gt;&lt;ref name=CIprofile/&gt;

==Business career and legacy==
[[File:J Wisden &amp; Company, 21 Cranbourn Street, London 03.jpg|thumb|J Wisden &amp; Company, 21 Cranbourn Street, London]]
Wisden began a cricket-equipment business in [[Leamington Spa]] in 1850 and five years later opened a "cricket and cigar" shop in Coventry Street near [[The Haymarket]] in central London, in partnership with [[Fred Lillywhite]] until 1858.&lt;ref name=survival/&gt;&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; He was also the cricket coach at [[Harrow School]] from 1852 to 1855, and owned ''The Cricketers'', a public house at [[Duncton]] in Sussex.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

He retired from cricket in 1863 at the relatively early age of 37 as a result of rheumatism,&lt;ref name=survival/&gt; and started publishing his annual ''Cricketers' Almanack'' the following year.&lt;ref name=CIprofile/&gt;  He also published in ''Cricket and How to Play It'' in 1866.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; In retirement he developed his business into a manufacturer and retailer of equipment for many sports, not just cricket.  The shop moved to Cranbourn Street near [[Leicester Square]] in 1872.&lt;ref name=survival/&gt;

After his death the business grew into a major international sports brand, receiving a [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant]] in 1911 as "Athletic Outfitters to the King".&lt;ref name=survival/&gt; The business went into receivership in 1939, and was acquired in 1943 by a [[Co-operative society]], which sold it on to [[Grays International|Grays]] of Cambridge in 1970.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Grays then ceased to use Wisden as an equipment brand, but re-established [[John Wisden &amp; Co]] as the publisher of the ''Cricketers' Almanack''. It is now an imprint of Wisden's owner, [[Bloomsbury Publishing Plc]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Death==
Wisden died of cancer, at the age of 57, in the flat above his Cranbourn Street shop (next to [[Leicester Square tube station]]). He was buried in [[Brompton Cemetery]], London.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

In 1913, 29 years after his death, he was the subject of a "Special Portrait" in the 50th edition of Wisden, replacing the usual [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]] feature which was dropped from that edition.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} In 1984, a headstone was placed at his grave to mark the centenary of his death.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

'''Joseph Herman Hirshhorn''' (August 11, 1899 – August 31, 1981) was an entrepreneur, [[financier]], and [[art collector]]. 

== Biography ==
Born in  [[Mitau]], [[Latvia]], the twelfth of thirteen children, Hirshhorn emigrated to the [[United States]] with his widowed mother at the age of six.

Hirshhorn went to work as an office boy on [[Wall Street]] at age 14. Three years later, in 1916, he became a [[stockbroker]] and earned $168,000 that year.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian biographical sketch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/findingaids/FARU7449.htm|title=Search|work=Smithsonian Institution Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shrewd investor, he sold off his Wall Street investments two months before the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|collapse of 1929]], realizing $4 million in cash.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian biographical sketch"/&gt; Hirshhorn made his fortune in the mining and oil business. In the 1930s, he focused much of his attention on gold and uranium mining prospects in [[Canada]], establishing an office in [[Toronto]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Freund, Thatcher, 1993, Objects of Desire, New York: Pantheon. {{ISBN|0679421572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, he and geologist [[Franc Joubin]] were primarily responsible for the "Big Z" uranium discovery in northeastern Ontario and the subsequent founding of the city of [[Elliot Lake]]. Hirshhorn Avenue, a residential street in that city, is named after him.  By 1960, when he sold the last of his uranium stock, he had made over $100 million in cash from the uranium business.&lt;ref&gt;Freund, op. cit., p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1961 to 1976, Hirshhorn lived in a three-story Norman chateau in a {{convert|22|acre|m2|sing=on}} estate at the summit of Round Hill, a {{convert|550|ft|m|sing=on}} rise in north-central [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], Connecticut, with a view of the Manhattan skyline.&lt;ref name=sn&gt;Nova, Susan, "Many rooms, skyline views: Chateau atop Round Hill is for sale", article in the Real Estate section of ''The Advocate'' of Stamford, Connecticut, page R1, March 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Art collecting ==
[[File:Moss-Hirshhorn-1970.jpg|left|thumb|Hirshhorn with [[Jacqueline Moss]] and an unknown arts writer in the sculpture garden at Round Hill, 1970.]]
When Hirshhorn began to make money, he began to buy art, both paintings and sculpture. He amassed a collection of paintings and [[sculpture]]s from the 19th and 20th centuries. Applying himself seriously to the study of art, he would question dealers, critics, and curators, and visit artists in their studios. He made quick decisions on buying a piece. "If you've got to look at a picture a dozen times before you make up your mind", he once said, "there's something wrong with you or the picture".&lt;ref&gt;Freund, op. cit., p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirshhorn graced his Greenwich mansion with paintings by [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Raphael Soyer]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Larry Rivers]], and [[Thomas Eakins]], and the grounds outside with sculptures by [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Richard Bernstein (artist)]], and [[Henry Moore]]. He allowed many nonprofit groups to use tours of his sculpture garden for fundraising.&lt;ref name=sn/&gt;

In 1966 Hirshhorn donated much of his collection, consisting of 6,000 paintings and sculptures from the 19th and 20h centuries (and constituting one of the world's largest private art treasures), to the [[United States government]], along with a $2 million endowment. The  [[Smithsonian Institution]] established the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden|Joseph H. Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1966 to hold the collection; the museum opened in 1974. At Hirshhorn's death in 1981, he willed an additional 6,000 works and a $5 million endowment to the museum.&lt;ref name=sn/&gt;

== Controversy ==
His business dealings in Canada were not without controversy. He was investigated by the [[Ontario Securities Commission]], convicted twice of breaking Canadian foreign exchange laws, deported from Canada for illegal stock manipulation (which he later appealed and won by having himself declared a landed immigrant), and fined for an illegal securities sale and illegally smuggling cash out of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Burnham, Sophy, 1973, The Art Crowd, New York: David McKay Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Hirshhorn's first wife was Jennie Berman. They were married in 1922 and separated in 1941. They had four children, daughters Robin Gertrude (b. 1923), Gene Harriet (b. 1926), and Naomi Caryl (b. 1931), and son Gordon (b. 1929).&lt;ref name=LePere&gt;LePere, Gene Hirshhorn. ''Little Man in a Big Hurry: The Life of Joseph H. Hirshhorn, Uranium King and Art Collector'' (Vantage Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; He was married to portraitist and book illustrator [[Lily Harmon]] from 1947&lt;ref name=LePere /&gt;–1956. The couple adopted two daughters, Amy (b. 1948) and Jo Ann (b. 1951).&lt;ref name = nytimes&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/14/nyregion/lily-harmon-85-portraitist-and-book-illustrator.html "Lily Harmon, 85, Portraitist and Book Illustrator,"] ''New York Times'' (14 Feb. 1998). Retrieved 29 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Hirshhorn's third wife was named Brenda Hawley Heide.&lt;ref name=LePere /&gt; In 1964 he married his fourth wife, [[Olga Hirshhorn]] (nee Zatorsky). He remained married to her until his death in 1981&lt;ref&gt;"A First Generation in Greenwich: Olga Zatorsky Hirshhorn",Oral History Interview by Penny Bott, 1976, Greenwich Library&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kulturforum''' is a collection of cultural buildings in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. It was built up in the 1950s and 1960s at the edge of [[West Berlin]], after most of the once unified city's cultural assets had been lost behind the [[Berlin Wall]]. The Kulturforum is characterized by its innovative modernist architecture; several buildings are distinguished by the organic designs of [[Hans Scharoun]], and the [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] was designed by [[Mies van der Rohe]]. Today, the Kulturforum lies immediately to the west of the redeveloped commercial node of [[Potsdamer Platz]].

==Cultural institutions==
Among the cultural institutions housed in and around the Kulturforum are:
*[[Neue Nationalgalerie]]
*[[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie]]
*[[Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin|Museum of Decorative Arts]]
*[[Berlin Musical Instrument Museum|Musical Instrument Museum]]

==History==
After [[World War II]], the public art collections were divided by the Berlin Wall, with particularly the Old Master paintings split between the [[Bode Museum]] in what became the east, and a temporary exhibition space in Dahlem, a western suburban district of Berlin. Public opinion at the time of reunification strongly favored a return of the Old Masters to their historical home at the Bode Museum. Yet Wolf-Dieter Dube, the then director-general of the [[Berlin State Museums]], pushed through his plans to move the collection to the Kulturforum, a modernist complex as answer to [[Museum Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Charly Wilder (September 14, 2012), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/berlin-s-culture-war-debate-pits-modern-art-against-old-masters-a-855704.html Berlin's Culture War - Debate Pit Modern Art against Old Masters] ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] became the centerpiece of the new complex, completed in 1998 when the long-planned $140 million [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie]] was opened nearby to house paintings of the 13th to 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Butler (December 2, 2001), [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/02/world/berlin-museum-s-revival-bolsters-german-identity.html Berlin Museum's Revival Bolsters German Identity] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Department of Architecture and Design ==
This is a '''partial list of works in MoMA's Department of Architecture and Design''', organized by type.

MoMA's Department of Architecture and Design was founded in 1932&lt;ref name="Arch Record"&gt;[http://archrecord.construction.com/news/2011/11/MoMAs-Architecture-Dept.asp Broome, Beth: ''A Landmark Acquisition for MoMA’s Architecture and Design Department''] in the Architectural Record, November 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; as the first museum department in the world dedicated to the intersection of architecture and design.&lt;ref name="MoMA Arch"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/explore/collection/architecture_design MoMA: Architecture and Design], retrieved November 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The department's first director was [[Philip Johnson]] who served as curator between 1932–34 and 1946–54.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/learn/resources/archives/EAD/PJohnsonPapersf MOMA: ''Philip Johnson Papers in The Museum of Modern Art Archives'', 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection consists of 28,000 works including architectural models, drawings and photographs.&lt;ref name="Arch Record"/&gt; One of the highlights of the collection is the [[Mies van der Rohe]] Archive.&lt;ref name="MoMA Arch"/&gt; It also includes works from such legendary architects and designers as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metropolismag.com/Point-of-View/January-2014/Frank-Lloyd-Wright-Exhibit-Set-to-Open-at-MoMA/ Frank Lloyd Wright Exhibit opens at MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vogue.com/872666/urban-design-frank-lloyd-wrights-archives-on-view-at-moma/ Frank Lloyd Wright Archives at MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1448 Frank Lloyd Wright and the City: Density vs. Dispersal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=6459 Frank Lloyd Wright, the collection]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul László]], the [[Charles and Ray Eames|Eameses]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], and [[George Nelson (designer)|George Nelson]]. The design collection contains many industrial and manufactured pieces, ranging from a self-aligning [[ball bearing]] to an entire [[Bell 47|Bell 47D1 helicopter]]. In 2012, the department acquired a selection of 14 [[video games]], the basis of an intended collection of 40 which is to range from ''[[Spacewar!]]'' (1962) to ''[[Minecraft]]'' (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Antonelli |first=Paola |title=Video Games: 14 in the Collection, for Starters |url=http://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2012/11/29/video-games-14-in-the-collection-for-starters |publisher=MoMA |accessdate=November 30, 2012|date=November 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130082752/http://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2012/11/29/video-games-14-in-the-collection-for-starters/ |archive-date=November 30, 2012 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Magna Alloys &amp; Research (S.A.) (Pty) Ltd. v Ellis'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZASCA/1984/116.html 1984 (4) SA 874 (A)].&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South Africa]]n [[law]], particularly [[contract]]. It established the principle that a [[restraint of trade]] is enforceable unless the court is convinced that it is unreasonable.

the leading case on restraint of trade is Magna Alloys and Research ( SA) (PTY) Ltd Vs Ellis 1984 (4) 874 ( A). The Law on agreements in restraint of trade has changed as a result of this decision. Prior to the Magna Alloys case, South African courts have accepted that an agreement in restraint of trade is contrary to public policy and therefore void, unless it can be shown that the restraint is reasonable. The Magna Alloys case changed the law and has settled the divisions of opinion on the issue of the retraint of trade.

Beginning with the recognition of musical collections in Prato conducted by the Center of Musical Documentation of Tuscany, it is possible to trace a synthesis of the history of the citizen’s musical production.&lt;ref name="FONTI"&gt;Stefania Gitto, ''Il Centro Documentazione Musicale della Toscana: prime riflessioni dell'attività di ricognizione'', in «Fonti Musicali Toscane», 20 (2015), Lucca, LIM, 2015, pp. 
157-174.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Following a chronological path linked to the most important musical subjects in Prato - institutions, composers and interpreters - and studying the handwritten and printed music brought to us, we were able to delineate a historical and cultural itinerary of the pratese musical life. 
The most antique musical collections of the city of Prato are the “pergamenacei” (made of parchment) liturgical book of the fourteenth century of [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]] origin, which are now preserved at the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo.&lt;ref name="CAPITOLO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedomus.toscana.it/web-db/?idscheda=34|title=Cathedral's Archive of the Chapter|publisher=CeDoMus}} (it)&lt;/ref&gt; 
The fourteenth-century cappella left little trace and merged with the new one, established in 1535. Beginning in 1981, a great deal of musical material of the latter institution belongs to the Archivio Storico Diocesano (Historical Diocesan Archive), in which there are many sources regarding its activities, as in the Archivio del Capitolo della Cattedrale (Archive of the Chapter in the Cathedral).&lt;ref name="CAPITOLO" /&gt;
The cappella saw rotations of Kappellmeister such as Giovanni Francesco Beccatelli (1679-1734), Giuseppe Becherini (1758-1840), Augusto Borgioli (1821-1879), Luigi Borgioli (1864-1939) whose works are conserved in the Historical Archive of the Cappella of the Duomo, together with the works of the most performed artists of the different time periods (Giovan Carlo Maria Clari, Nicola Benvenuti, Giuseppe Gherardeschi).&lt;ref name="DIOCESANO STORICO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedomus.toscana.it/web-db/?idscheda=25|title=Historical Diocesan Archive|publisher=CeDoMus}} (it)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, The Historical Diocesan Archive also gathered the materials of 61 parishes together, which is preserved today in the Archives of the parishes. There are many chorals and sacred music, manuscripts and printed, that cover a vast period of time, from the fourteenth century to the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="PARROCCHIE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedomus.toscana.it/web-db/?idscheda=115|title=Parishes' Diocesan Archive|publisher=CeDoMus}} (it)&lt;/ref&gt; 
The activities of the chapel were sided with the production of secular music, which left traces mostly beginning in the eighteenth century.
The Cicognini Boarding School has manuscripts of the performances staged by the boarders from 1780 until 1870, including comic operas and dance music from [[Wolfgnag Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] to [[Riccardo Zandonai|Zandonai]].&lt;ref name="CICOGNINI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedomus.toscana.it/web-db/?idscheda=174|title=Cicognini Archive|publisher=CeDoMus}} (it)&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1842, the group «Concerto Cittadino Edoardo Chiti», of which the archive conserves a large amount of music of various genres used in their frequent concerts&lt;ref name="CONCERTO CITTADINO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedomus.toscana.it/web-db/?idscheda=33|title=Chiti Collection|publisher=CeDoMus}} (it)&lt;/ref&gt;; and at the end of the eighteenth century, the choir «Guido Monaco» was formed, which has a musical archive consisting of a large amount of printed edition vocal music.&lt;ref name="CORALE GUIDO MONACO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedomus.toscana.it/web-db/?idscheda=22|title=Page of the choir's music collection|publisher=CeDoMus}} (it)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Autografo di Attilio Ciardi a Prato.jpg|thumb|First page of autographed mass by Attilio Ciardi (1899), conserved in the music collection of «Guido Monaco» Choir&lt;ref name="CORALE GUIDO MONACO" /&gt;|228x228px|left]][[File:Copertina Rota Prato.jpg|thumb|First page of Nino Rota's composition performed at Treble Festival held by «Guido Monaco» Choir in 1973&lt;ref name="VOCI BIANCHE" /&gt;|289x289px]]
These institutions represented the musical vocation of the citizens for over a century, offering an example of one of the most important civil musical activities in Tuscany, to which many talented composers contributed. In the 19th century Cesare Ciardi, Attilio Ciardi, Attilio Nuti were active in Prato, and whose autographs are spread throughout the institutions in Prato.

[[File:Resume.pdf|thumb|Sample résumé outline for a college student]]
A '''résumé''' or '''resume'''{{efn|{{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|r|ɛ|z|ʊ|ˌ|m|eɪ|,_|ˈ|r|eɪ|-|,_|ˌ|r|ɛ|z|ʊ|ˈ|m|eɪ|,_|ˌ|r|eɪ|-}} {{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|r|ɛ|zj|ʊ|m|eɪ}}; {{IPA-fr|ʁezyme|lang}}}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=résumé|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/r%C3%A9sum%C3%A9|dictionary=Merriam-Webster Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a document used by a person to present their backgrounds and skills. Résumés can be used for a variety of reasons, but most often they are used to secure new employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/resume |title=Resume &amp;#124; Define Resume at Dictionary.com |website=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical résumé contains a "summary" of relevant job [[experience]] and [[education]], as its French origin implies. The résumé is usually one of the first items, along with a [[cover letter]] and sometimes an application for employment, which a potential [[employer]] sees regarding the job seeker and is typically used to [[Screening (economics)|screen]] applicants, often followed by an [[interview]].

The [[curriculum vitae]] (CV) used for employment purposes in the UK (and in other European countries) is more akin to the résumé—a shorter, summary version of one's education and experience—than to the longer and more detailed CV that is expected in U.S. academic circles.

Generally, the résumé is substantially shorter than a CV in [[English Canada]], the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doyle |first=Alison |url=http://jobsearch.about.com/cs/curriculumvitae/f/cvresume.htm |title=The Difference Between a Resume and a Curriculum Vitae |website=Jobsearch.about.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Asian countries such as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, [[biodata]] is often used in place of a résumé.&lt;ref name="Sehgal2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sehgal|first=M. K.|title=Business Communication|year=2008|publisher=Excel Books |language=English|isbn=9788174465016|page=392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As has been indicated above, the word résumé comes from the French word {{lang|fr|résumé}} meaning "summary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=Merriam-Webster| accessdate=9 March 2015| url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/resume| title=resume| quote=French résumé, from past participle of résumer to resume, summarize, from Middle French resumer}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonardo da Vinci]] is credited with the first résumé, though his "résumé" takes the form of a letter written about 1481–1482 to a potential employer, Ludovico Sforza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pratt|first1=Síofra|title=3 Lessons Every Job Seeker Can Learn from the World’s Oldest CV|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141015111116-2417166-3-lessons-every-job-seeker-can-learn-from-the-world-s-oldest-cv|publisher=[[LinkedIn]]|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Skills of Leonardo da Vinci|url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/03/skills-of-da-vinci.html|website=Lettersofnote.com|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next roughly 450 years, the résumé continued to be a mere description of a person, and included their abilities and past employment. In the early 1900s, résumés listed things like weight, height, marital status, and religion. It was not until 1950 that the résumé evolved into something more than words written on scraps of paper. By then, résumés were considered very much mandatory, and started to include information like personal interests and hobbies. It was not until the 1970s, the beginning of the [[Digital Age]], that résumés took on a more professional look in terms of presentation and content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-resumes-have-evolved-since-their-first-creation-in-1482-2011-2|title=The 500-Year Evolution Of The Resume|newspaper=[[Business Insider]]|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In many contexts, a résumé is typically limited to one or two pages of size [[ISO 216|A4]] or [[Letter paper|letter-size]], highlighting only those experiences and qualifications that the author considers most relevant to the desired position. Many résumés contain [[Index term|keywords]] or [[skills]] that potential employers are looking for via [[applicant tracking system]]s, make heavy use of active verbs, and display content in a flattering manner. Acronyms and credentials after the applicant's name should be spelled out fully in the appropriate section of the résumé, greater chance of being found in a computerized keyword scan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/organizational-and-employee-development/pages/how-to-create-an-hr-resume.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; Résumés can vary in style and length, but should always contain accurate contact information of the job seeker. A recent hiring simulation by ResumeGo concluded that a two-page resume was more likely to lead to being hired than a one-page resume.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cbsnews.com/news/your-one-page-resume-may-be-killing-your-job-search/|title=Your one-page resume may be killing your job search|last=Ivanova|first=Irina|date=|website=CBS News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A résumé is a marketing tool in which the content should be adapted to suit each individual job application or applications aimed at a particular industry. The transmission of résumés directly to employers became increasingly popular as late as 2002. {{citation needed|date=February 2010}} Job seekers were able to circumvent the [[application for employment|job application]] process and reach employers through direct email contact and résumé blasting, a term meaning the mass distribution of résumés to increase personal visibility within the job market. However, the mass distribution of résumés to employers can often have a negative effect on the applicant's chances of securing employment as the résumés tend not to be tailored for the specific positions the applicant is applying for. It is usually, therefore, more sensible to optimize the résumé for each position applied for and its keywords. In order to keep track of all experiences, keeping a 'master résumé' document is recommended, providing job-seekers with the ability to customize a tailored résumé while making sure extraneous information is easily accessible for future use if needed.

The complexity or simplicity of various résumé formats tends to produce results varying from person to person, for the occupation, and to the industry. Résumés or CVs used by medical professionals, professors, artists and people in other specialized fields may be comparatively longer. For example, an artist's résumé, typically excluding any non-art-related employment, may include extensive lists of [[Solo exhibition|solo]] and group [[Art exhibitions|exhibitions]].

==Styles==
Résumés may be organized in different ways. The following are some of the more common résumé formats:

===Reverse chronological résumé===
A reverse chronological résumé lists a candidate's job experiences in chronological order, generally covering the previous 10 to 15 years. Positions are listed with starting and ending dates. Current positions on a résumé typically list the starting date to the present. The reverse chronological résumé format&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Reverse Chronological Resume Format: Focusing on Work History, Growth - For Dummies|url = http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/reverse-chronological-resume-format-focusing-on-w0.html|website = Dummies.com|accessdate = 22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is most commonly used by those who are not professional résumé writers. In using this format, the main body of the document becomes the Professional Experience section, starting from the most recent experience and moving chronologically backwards through a succession of previous experience. The reverse chronological résumé works to build credibility through experience gained, while illustrating career growth over time and filling all gaps in a career trajectory. A chronological résumé is not recommended to job seekers with gaps in their career summaries. In the United Kingdom the chronological résumé tends to extend only as far back as the applicant's [[GCSE]]/[[Standard Grade]] qualifications.

===Functional résumé===
A functional  résumé lists work experience and skills sorted by skill area or job function.

The functional résumé is used to focus on skills that are specific to the type of position being sought. This format directly emphasizes specific professional capabilities and utilizes experience summaries as its primary means of communicating professional competency. In contrast, the chronological résumé format will briefly highlight these competencies prior to presenting a comprehensive timeline of career growth through reverse chronological listings, with the most recent experience listed first. The functional résumé works well for those making a career change, having a varied work history or with little work experience. A functional résumé is also preferred for applications to jobs that require very specific skills or clearly defined personality traits. A functional résumé is a good method for highlighting particular skills or experiences, especially when those particular skills or experiences may have derived from a role which was held some time ago. Rather than focus on the length of time that has passed, the functional résumé allows the reader to identify those skills quickly.

===Hybrid résumé===
The hybrid résumé balances the functional and [[chronological]] approaches. A résumé organized this way typically leads with a functional list of job skills, followed by a chronological list of employers. The hybrid has a tendency to repeat itself and is, therefore, less widely used than the other two.

===Online résumés===
As the search for employment has become more electronic, it is common for employers to only accept résumés electronically, either out of practicality or preference. This has changed much about the manner in which résumés are written, read, and processed. Some career experts are pointing out that today a paper-based résumé is an exception rather than the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20140620-to-print-or-not-to-print |title=To Print Or Not To Print |last=Garone |first=Liz |date=23 June 2014  | website=bbc.com |accessdate= 25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many employers now find candidates' résumés through [[search engine]]s, which makes it more important for candidates to use appropriate keywords when writing a résumé. Larger employers use [[Applicant tracking system|Applicant Tracking Systems]] to search, filter, and manage high volumes of résumés. Job ads may direct applicants to email a résumé to a company or visit its website and submit a résumé in an electronic format.

Many employers, and recruitment agencies working on their behalf, insist on receiving résumés in a particular [[file format]]. Some require [[Microsoft Word]] documents, while others will only accept résumés formatted in [[HTML]], [[PDF]], or plain [[ASCII]] text.

Another consideration for electronic résumé documents is that they are parsed with [[Natural language processing|natural language processors]]. [[Resume parsing|Résumé parsers]] may correctly interpret some parts of the content of the résumé but not other parts. The best résumé parsers capture a high percentage of information regarding location, names, titles, but are less accurate with skills, industries and other less structured or rapidly changing data. Résumés written in a standard format are more likely to be correctly interpreted by résumé parsers, and thereby may make the candidate more findable.

One advantage for employers to online résumés is the significant cost saving compared to traditional hiring methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.careerjournal.com/hrcenter/weddlesguide/19990405-weddle.html |title=Career Advice, Find a Job &amp; Salary Trends - Wall Street Journal |website=Careerjournal.com |date=2002-10-03 |accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is that potential employers no longer have to sort through massive stacks of paper.

===Infographic, video and website résumés===
As the Internet becomes more driven by multimedia, job-seekers have sought to take advantage of the trend by moving their résumés away from the traditional paper and email media.

[[Video resume|Video]], infographic, and even [[Vine (service)|Vine]] résumés have gained popularity, though mainly in the creative and media industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-resumes-that-got-worldwide-attention-194410148.html |title=10 Resumes That Got Worldwide Attention |last=Shontell |first=Alyson |date=27 February 2013  | website=finance.yahoo.com |accessdate= 25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This trend has attracted criticism from [[human resources management]] professionals, who warn that this may be a passing fad and point out that multimedia-based résumés may be overlooked by recruiters whose [[workflow]] is designed only to accommodate a traditional résumé format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2012/05/18/recruiters-tell-us-do-resume-fads-really-work/ |title=Recruiters Tell Us: Do Résumé Fads Really Work? |date=18 May 2012  | website=forbes.com |accessdate= 25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Résumé evaluation==
Many résumé development agencies offer résumé evaluation services wherein they evaluate the résumé and suggest any necessary changes. Candidates are free to either do those changes themselves or may take help of the agency itself. Some career fields include a special section listing the lifelong works of the author: for computer-related fields, the [[softography]]; for musicians and composers, the [[discography]]; for actors, a [[filmography]].

Keeping résumés online has become increasingly common for people in professions that benefit from the multimedia and rich detail that are offered by an HTML résumé, such as actors, photographers, graphic designers, developers, dancers, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/cv/actorcv.htm |title=How to Write an Actor's/Singer's CV | website=Kent University }}&lt;/ref&gt; Job seekers are finding an ever-increasing demand to have an electronic version of their résumé available to employers and professionals who use [[Internet recruiting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/worklife/05/07/cb.e.resume/index.html?iref=nextin |title= An E-friendly Résumé in 5 Easy Steps |last=Presely |first=Eric |date=8 May 2008  | website=cnn.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Online résumé distribution services have emerged to allow job seekers to distribute their résumés to numerous employers of their choice through email.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/workinglife/the-future-of-the-resume/2269763 |title= The Future of the Resume|last=Burdick |first=Cody |date=17 March 2016  | website=Tampa Bay Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Résumé as one part of a personal branding mix==
In some sectors, particularly in the [[Startup company|startup]] community, use of traditional résumé has seen a consistent decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/is-the-resume-dead/article18988834/ |title=Is The Resume Dead? |last=Lawrence |first=Daina |date=5 June 2014  | website=forbes.com |accessdate= 25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While standalone résumés are still used to apply for jobs, job-seekers may also view their résumés as one of a number of assets which form their [[personal branding|personal brand]] and work together to strengthen their job application. In this scenario, résumés are generally used to provide a potential employer with factual information (e.g., achievements), while the social media platforms give insight into the job-seekers' motivations and personality in development.

'''Michael Shawn Hickenbottom''' (born July 22, 1965), better known by his [[ring name]] '''Shawn Michaels''', is an American retired [[professional wrestler]], actor, and [[television presenter]] currently signed to [[WWE]]. He has been cited by a number of peers and fans as the greatest in-ring performer in history.&lt;ref name="GOAT"/&gt;
 
Michaels wrestled consistently for WWE, formerly the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), from 1988 until his first retirement in 1998. He held non-wrestling roles from 1998 to 2000 and resumed wrestling in 2002 until retiring ceremoniously in 2010, before being assigned as a trainer in 2016 and returning for one match in 2018.

In the WWF/WWE, Michaels headlined major [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|pay-per-view events]] between 1989 and 2010, closing the company's flagship annual event, [[WrestleMania]], five times. He was the co-founder and original leader of the successful stable, [[D-Generation X]]. Michaels also wrestled in the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), where he founded [[The Rockers|The Midnight Rockers]] with [[Marty Jannetty]] in 1985. After winning the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]] twice, the team continued to the WWF as The Rockers and had a high-profile breakup in January 1992. Within the year, Michaels twice challenged for the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] and won his first [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]], heralding his arrival as one of the industry's premier singles stars.

Michaels is a four-time [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world champion]], having held the WWF Championship [[List of WWE Champions|three times]] and WWE's [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] [[List of World Heavyweight Champions (WWE)|once]]. He is also a two-time [[Royal Rumble]] winner (and the first man to win the match as the number one entrant), the first [[Grand Slam (professional wrestling)#WWE|WWF Grand Slam Champion]] and the fourth [[Triple Crown (professional wrestling)#WWE|WWF Triple Crown Champion]], as well as a [[WWE Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (2011)|class of 2011]] inductee. Michaels won the ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]'' "[[List of Pro Wrestling Illustrated awards#Match of the Year|Match of the Year]]" reader vote a record eleven times, and his match against [[John Cena]] on April 23, 2007 was ranked by WWE as the best match ever aired on the company's flagship ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/50-greatest-wwe-monday-night-raw-matches-list|title=The 50 greatest matches in Raw history re-ranked|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Hickenbottom was born on July 22, 1965 in [[Chandler, Arizona]].&lt;ref name=sm12&gt;{{harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/michaels-shawn.html|title=Slam! Sports biography|accessdate= July 10, 2007|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|work=Slam! Sports|date=March 12, 2005|last=Milner|first=John|author2=Jason Clevett }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last of four children – Randy, Scott, and Shari are his older siblings – he was raised in a [[military]] family and spent a brief part of his early years in [[Reading, Berkshire]], England,&lt;ref name=sm12/&gt; but grew up in [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]]. As a child, Hickenbottom disliked the name Michael, so his family and friends just called him Shawn.&lt;ref name=sm18&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since, he has been referred to as Shawn. Additionally, Hickenbottom moved around frequently since his father was in the military.&lt;ref name=sm18/&gt;

He knew he wanted to become a professional wrestler at the age of twelve and said he performed a wrestling routine in his high school's talent show, complete with fake [[blood.]]&lt;ref name="slam" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/136347/professional-wrestler-visits-former-base-school-home.aspx|title=Professional wrestler visits former base school, home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hickenbottom was already an athlete; his career began at the age of six when he started playing [[American football|football]].&lt;ref name=sm15&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a stand-out [[linebacker]] at [[Randolph High School (Texas)|Randolph High School]] on [[Randolph Air Force Base]] and eventually became captain of the football team.&lt;ref name="WWEProfile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/inductees/hbk/|title=Shawn Michaels' WWE Hall of Fame Profile|accessdate=March 31, 2011|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating, Hickenbottom attended [[Texas State University|Southwest Texas State University]] in [[San Marcos, Texas]], but soon realized that college life was not for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=43–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then began pursuing a career in professional wrestling.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== National Wrestling Alliance (1984–1985) ===
Hickenbottom began to train under Mexican professional wrestler [[Jose Lothario]].&lt;ref name=stopper&gt;{{cite web|url= http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/2004/03/14/381421.html|title=Shawn Michaels, still the show-stopper|first=Jaya|last=Roopansingh|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|work=Slam! Sports|accessdate=March 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sm57&gt;{{harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his training, Hickenbottom adopted the ring name, "Shawn Michaels".&lt;ref name="HAT"/&gt; After his training with Lothario, he debuted as Shawn Michaels with the [[National Wrestling Alliance]]'s (NWA) [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]] territory on October 16, 1984, against [[Art Crews]], losing to Crews via swinging neckbreaker. Michaels' performance in his debut match impressed many veterans, including [[Terry Taylor]].

In January 1985, he debuted for [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW), the NWA territory in [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]]. In April 1985, Michaels went to work for another NWA territory in Kansas City called [[Heart of America Sports Attractions|Central States Wrestling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=75–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, he and tag team partner [[Marty Jannetty]] defeated The Batten Twins for the [[NWA Central States Tag Team Championship]], later losing it back to the Battens.&lt;ref name="slam"/&gt;

=== Texas All-Star Wrestling (1985–1986) ===
After leaving Kansas City, he returned to [[Texas]] to wrestle for [[Southwest Championship Wrestling|Texas All-Star Wrestling]] (TASW).&lt;ref name="HAT"&gt;{{cite video|date=2007|title=The Shawn Michaels Story: Heartbreak &amp; Triumph|medium=DVD|publisher=[[WWE Home Video]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time with TASW, Michaels replaced [[Nick Kiniski]] in the [[American Force (wrestling)|American Breed]] [[tag team]], teaming with [[Paul Diamond]]. Michaels and Diamond were awarded the [[Texas All-Star USA Tag Team Championship|TASW Tag Team Championship]] by [[Chavo Guerrero Sr.]]&lt;ref name="slam"/&gt; The team was later renamed American Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in TASW, Michaels and Diamond feuded with [[Footloose (professional wrestling)|Japanese Force]].

=== American Wrestling Association (1986–1987) ===
Michaels made his national-level debut, as Sean Michaels, at the age of 20 in the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), in a victory over Buddhakhan on ESPN. He was once again teamed with Marty Jannetty, billed as [[The Rockers|The Midnight Rockers]]. The Midnight Rockers won the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]], defeating [[Doug Somers]] and [[Buddy Rose]].&lt;ref name=stopper/&gt;

=== World Wrestling Federation and return to AWA (1987–1988) ===
In 1987, The Rockers were signed by a competing promotion: the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF).&lt;ref name=stopper/&gt; They were fired from WWF two weeks later, for a bar incident (a misunderstanding, according to Michaels' autobiography).&lt;ref name=stopper/&gt;&lt;ref name="sm116"/&gt; They then returned to AWA, where they won the AWA tag team titles for a second time,&lt;ref name="slam"/&gt; but were re-signed by WWF a year later.&lt;ref name="sm116"&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=116–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to the WWF/E===

{{Main article|The Rockers}}
[[File:The Rockers - Michaels and Jannetty.jpg|thumb|left|Michaels (left) with [[Marty Jannetty]] during their time as [[The Rockers]]]]
The Rockers redebuted at a WWF [[House show|live event]] on July 7, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to WWF chairman [[Vince McMahon]]'s desire to have his performers carry WWF-exclusive ring names, Michaels and Jannetty were renamed, as simply [[The Rockers]].&lt;ref name="HAT" /&gt; The team proved popular with both children and women&lt;ref name="stopper" /&gt; and was a mid-card stalwart of television and [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|pay-per-view]] shows for the next two years.&lt;ref name="sm148"&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=148–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Michaels headlined his first pay-per-view for the WWF when The Rockers were involved in the [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|4-on-4 Survivor Series match]] main event of the [[Survivor Series (1989)|1989 Survivor Series]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/89.htm Survivor Series 89 - Chicago, IL - Rosemont Horizon - November 23, 1989]. The History of WWE. Retrieved August 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 30, 1990, The Rockers unofficially won the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] from [[The Hart Foundation]] ([[Bret Hart]] and [[Jim Neidhart]]), as Neidhart, half of the championship team, was in the process of negotiating his release from the company.&lt;ref name=sm148/&gt; The match was taped with The Rockers winning the title, but soon after Neidhart came to an agreement with management and was rehired.&lt;ref name=sm148/&gt; The championship was returned to the Hart Foundation, while the title change was never broadcast or even acknowledged on television (though The Rockers did actually have a successful title defence on November 3, 1990 against [[Power and Glory]] ([[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules]] and [[Paul Roma]]) before the title was returned to the Hart Foundation).&lt;ref name=sm148/&gt; When news spread, WWF explained that the original result was void due to a collapsed [[turnbuckle]] in the ring during the bout. A buckle had indeed broke, but not to a noticeable or dangerous extent during the match.&lt;ref name="HAT"/&gt; The Rockers continued their partnership, eventually splitting on December 2, 1991 during an incident on [[Brutus Beefcake]]'s televised ''Barber Shop'' talk show [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|promotional segment]].&lt;ref name=sm159&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=157–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels [[superkick]]ed Jannetty and [[Defenestration|threw him]] through a [[Sugar glass|glass]] window on the set of Beefcake's talk show.&lt;ref name=stopper/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.ign.com/articles/583/583410p1.html|title=IGN: Shawn Michaels Interview|last=Robinson|first=Jon|date=January 28, 2005|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|work=[[IGN]] Sports|accessdate=August 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jannetty returned to the WWF the following year and enjoyed moderate success before leaving the company in 1994, while Michaels became a prominent villain of the early to mid-1990s as "The Boy Toy".&lt;ref name=sm159/&gt;

At the suggestion of [[Curt Hennig]], Michaels adopted the nickname "The Heartbreak Kid".&lt;ref name=stopper/&gt; Along with his new name came a new [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] as a vain, cocky [[heel (professional wrestling)|villain]].&lt;ref name=shining&gt;{{cite journal|first=Steve|last=Anderson|title=7 Superstars Shining Brightly|work=Wrestling Digest|date=February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was put together with mirror-carrying [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]], [[Sherri Martel|Sensational Sherri]], who according to the storyline had become infatuated with him.&lt;ref name=sm159/&gt; Sherri even sang the first version of his new [[theme music]], "Sexy Boy".&lt;ref name="HAT"/&gt; During that period, after Michaels had wrestled his scheduled match at live events, his departure was announced with "Shawn Michaels has left the building", alluding to the phrase "[[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] has left the building".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=165–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shawn and Diesel tag champs.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Kevin Nash|Diesel]] acted as Michaels's on-air bodyguard and [[tag team]] partner for two [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|championship reigns]]]]
At [[WrestleMania VIII]], Michaels defeated [[Tito Santana]] in his first pay-per-view singles match after both men had simultaneously eliminated each other from that year's [[Royal Rumble (1992)|Royal Rumble]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/8/results WrestleMania VIII: Full Event Results].

In September 1993, Michaels was suspended for testing positive for [[steroid]] – a charge he never admitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; On WWF programs, his suspension was explained by his having neglected to defend the title often enough. After turning down [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW)'s advances, Michaels returned to the WWF and made several appearances in the [[United States Wrestling Association]] (USWA) during a WWF/USWA cross-promotion. He returned to WWF television in November at the [[Survivor Series (1993)|Survivor Series]] substituting for [[Jerry Lawler]], who was dealing with legal issues, in a match pitting himself and three of Lawler's "Knights" against the Hart brothers, Bret, [[Bruce Hart (wrestler)|Bruce]], [[Keith Hart (wrestler)|Keith]] and [[Owen Hart|Owen]].&lt;ref name=pwi92&gt;{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac &amp; Book of Facts|work=Wrestling's Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|pages=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Michaels entered a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|staged rivalry]] with Razor Ramon, who had won the Intercontinental Championship, which had been vacated during Michaels' absence.&lt;ref name="ladderbegin"&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=182–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Michaels had never been defeated in the ring for the title, he claimed to be the rightful champion and even carried around his old title belt.&lt;ref name="ladderbegin"/&gt; This feud culminated in a ladder match between the two at [[WrestleMania X]].&lt;ref name="ladderbegin"/&gt; Michaels lost the match, which featured both his and Ramon's championship belts suspended above a ladder in the ring.&lt;ref name=pwi92/&gt;&lt;ref name="ladderbegin"/&gt; This match was voted by fans as "[[List of Pro Wrestling Illustrated awards#Match of the Year|Match of the Year]]" by ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]''.&lt;ref name=stopper/&gt; It also received a five-star rating from ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'' editor [[Dave Meltzer]], one of five WWF/WWE matches to do so. Over the next few months, Michaels battled various injuries and launched the ''[[WWE Raw#Recurring segments|Heartbreak Hotel]]'' television talk show segment, mainly shown on ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 28, Michaels and Diesel captured the WWF Tag Team Championship from [[The Headshrinkers]] ([[Samula Anoaʻi|Samu]] and [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Fatu]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day at [[SummerSlam (1994)|SummerSlam]], Diesel lost the Intercontinental Championship to Ramon when Michaels accidentally superkicked Diesel.&lt;ref name=pwi92/&gt; This triggered a split between Michaels and Diesel, a storyline that was drawn out until [[Survivor Series (1994)|Survivor Series]] that November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac &amp; Book of Facts|work=Wrestling's Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|pages=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels went on to win the [[Royal Rumble (1995)|Royal Rumble]] in 1995,&lt;ref name=sm196&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=196–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; which set up a championship grudge match at [[WrestleMania XI]] against Diesel (who had gone on to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from [[Bob Backlund]]).&lt;ref name=sm196/&gt; As part of the storyline, Michaels recruited [[Sid Eudy|Sid]] as his bodyguard for the build-up, lost the match&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Finn|title=Power Slam Magazine, issue 10|work=Tough luck Shawn (WrestleMania XI)|publisher=SW Publishing|date=April 24, 1995|pages=20–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was attacked by Sid the following night.&lt;ref name="Sid attack"&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, Michaels took time off&lt;ref name="Sid attack"/&gt; because Vince McMahon wanted Michaels to become a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=203–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Formation of the Kliq (1995–1996) ====
{{Main article|The Kliq}}
Michaels returned to the ring as a fan favorite in May 1995 and he went on to defeat [[Jeff Jarrett]] to win his third Intercontinental Championship in July at [[In Your House 2|In Your House 2: The Lumberjacks]].&lt;ref name=stopper/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a title defense against Razor Ramon at [[SummerSlam (1995)|SummerSlam]] in a ladder match, which Michaels won.&lt;ref name=stopper/&gt; Around this time, Michaels became the leader of a backstage group known as [[The Kliq]].&lt;ref name=stopper/&gt; Critics perceive the group to have sufficient clout with WWF owner Vince McMahon, becoming dominant wrestling figures in the WWF for several years in the mid-1990s, causing friction with other wrestlers. Michaels disputes the perception, saying that McMahon pushed only deserving wrestlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=206–208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels' fan base was later nicknamed "The Kliq" as an inside reference to the real "Kliq".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1995, Michaels was the victim of a legit assault outside a bar in [[Syracuse, New York]].&lt;ref name="HAT"/&gt; Due to not being able to compete, Michaels was forced to forfeit the Intercontinental Championship to his original opponent [[Shane Douglas|Dean Douglas]] at [[In Your House 4|In Your House: Great White North]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; who in turn Douglas lost the championship to Razor Ramon, another member of the Kliq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac &amp; Book of Facts|work=Wrestling's Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event has been cited as an example of the Kliq holding others down. During a match with [[Owen Hart]] on a November episode of ''Raw'', Hart performed an [[Professional wrestling attacks#Enzuigiri|enzuigiri]] that struck the back of Michaels' head.&lt;ref name=sm215&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; They continued the match, but Michaels collapsed in the ring, supposedly because he had suffered a concussion.&lt;ref name="HAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sm215/&gt; The concussion was scripted, which was kept from most fans at the time.&lt;ref name="HAT"/&gt; A retirement angle was written so that Michaels could take some time off after he came back from an injury too soon.&lt;ref name="HAT"/&gt;

==== WWF Champion (1996–1998) ====
{{Main article|D-Generation X}}
After teasing a retirement, Michaels returned to the WWF at the [[Royal Rumble (1996)|Royal Rumble]] match in 1996, which he wound up winning for a second year in a row, to receive a [[WWE World Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match in the main event at [[WrestleMania XII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2007 Wrestling Almanac &amp; Book of Facts|work=Wrestling's Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, Jose Lothario became Michaels' on-screen manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; At WrestleMania XII, Michaels defeated WWF Champion Bret Hart in the overtime of their sixty-minute [[Iron Man match]], which had ended in a scoreless tie.&lt;ref name=stopper/&gt; On May 19, Michaels and his fellow Kliq members were involved in the incident known as "[[The Kliq#Curtain Call: The MSG Incident|Curtain Call]]". Diesel and Razor Ramon were about to leave WWF to company rival WCW. After Michaels won a match against Diesel, Ramon and [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]] came to the ring and joined Michaels and Diesel in a group-hug.&lt;ref name=assael156&gt;{{harv|Assael|Mooneyham|2002|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Diesel and Helmsley were seen as villains at the time, in contrast to Michaels and Ramon, this constituted a breach of "[[kayfabe]]", as acting out of character, which was rare and controversial at the time.&lt;ref name=assael156/&gt; As WCW gained momentum due to the signings of Hall and Nash, Michaels held the championship for most of the year. Michaels' championship reign ended at the [[Survivor Series (1996)|Survivor Series]] event, where he lost to Sycho Sid, his former bodyguard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels recaptured the championship from Sid in January 1997 at the [[Royal Rumble (1997)|Royal Rumble]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454115|title=HBK's second WWE title reign|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=August 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a special episode of ''Raw'' dubbed ''Thursday Raw Thursday'', Michaels vacated the WWF World Heavyweight Championship.&lt;ref name="HAT"/&gt; He explained to fans that he was informed by doctors that he had conjured a knee injury and that he had to retire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=239–240}}&lt;/ref&gt; His speech was regarded as controversial, as Michaels was allegedly unwilling to lose to Bret Hart at [[WrestleMania 13]] (since it was noted that he was going to have a rematch with Hart at WrestleMania).&lt;ref name=stopper/&gt; Michaels contemplated thoughts of retirement and stated that he "had to find his smile again", which he had "lost" somewhere down the line.&lt;ref name=stopper/&gt; After knee surgery by [[James Andrews (physician)|Dr. James Andrews]], Michaels returned a few months later, briefly teaming with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] to win the WWF Tag Team Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/304454132122112|title=Stone Cold &amp; Shawn Michaels first World Tag Team title reign|accessdate=July 12, 2007|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, Michaels reveals about his real-life feud with Bret Hart, claiming that Hart did interviews on live television claiming that he [Michaels] was faking his whole injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=243–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WWE- Birmingham 200997 (22).jpg|thumb|right|Michaels portrayed his cocky, vain character with colourful outfits]]
By spring of 1997, the real-life backstage conflict between Michaels and Hart were reaching its heights. Both men were going out on television and frequently making personal, true to heart remarks about one another. Michaels briefly left the WWF in June of that year after a real backstage fight with Hart, just hours before a ''Raw Is War'' show, which allegedly resulted from Michaels making an on-air remark, known as the "Sunny Days" comment, implying that Hart (who was married at the time) was having an affair with [[Tammy Sytch]], a manager and valet who was signed to the WWF as Sunny. Michaels and Austin were still WWF Tag Team Champions at the time during an ongoing feud with the Hart Foundation and a tournament was made to decide new tag team champions. Michaels eventually returned that summer in July. At [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]], Michaels officiated the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match between WWF Champion [[The Undertaker]] and Bret Hart.&lt;ref name="takerSS"&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=247–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match ended in controversial fashion, with Michaels hitting Undertaker with a chair (unintentionally, as he was aiming for Hart after he spat in his face).&lt;ref name="takerSS"/&gt; Michaels was then forced to award the championship to his nemesis, Bret Hart.&lt;ref name="takerSS"/&gt; The next night on ''Raw Is War'', signs of a heel turn started to show as Michaels told the WWF fans what happened at SummerSlam was an accident and that he dealt with the Undertaker when the time came. At [[WWF One Night Only]], held in [[Birmingham|Birmingham, England]] in September, Michaels defeated The British Bulldog to capture the [[WWE European Championship|European Championship]].&lt;ref name="takerSS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/euro/358418 |title=HBK's first European title reign |accessdate=July 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224000439/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/euro/358418 |archivedate=February 24, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fans at the event were so appalled at the result of the match they booed Michaels out of the building to the extent that they littered the ring with garbage, cementing his second heel turn.&lt;ref name="takerSS"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pwi99&gt;{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac &amp; Book of Facts|work=Wrestling's Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|pages=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this win, Michaels became the first [[Grand Slam (professional wrestling)|Grand Slam Champion]].&lt;ref name="WWEProfile"/&gt; At [[Badd Blood: In Your House|In Your House: Badd Blood]], Michaels defeated Undertaker in the first [[Hell in a Cell]] match, during which Michaels fell off the side of the {{convert|15|ft|m|0|adj=on}} high structure through a table.&lt;ref name="HIAC1"&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=257–259}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match received a 5-star rating from Dave Meltzer.

In the fall, Michaels joined forces with real-life friend Hunter Hearst Helmsley (later known as Triple H), Helmsley's then real life girlfriend [[Chyna]], and [[Rick Rude]] to form the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]] [[D-Generation X]] (DX).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels continued his rivalry with Bret Hart and his reformed [[The Hart Foundation#The (New) Hart Foundation|Hart Foundation]], which was now a pro-Canada stable. Michaels taunted the group and Canada by engaging in acts such as blowing his nose with and humping the [[Flag of Canada|Canadian Flag]]. Michaels later claimed the flag desecration was Hart's idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=274–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels' feud with the Hart Foundation culminated in a championship match at [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]] in November 1997 against Hart. Michaels came out of this match, dubbed by fans the "[[Montreal Screwjob]]", as the WWF World Heavyweight Champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/30445415 |title=HBK's third WWE title reign |accessdate=July 13, 2007 |publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105072205/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/30445415 |archivedate=January 5, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels now held both the WWF World Heavyweight and European championship at the same time. Michaels dropped the European Championship to D-Generation X member Hunter Hearst Hemsley in a [[Farce|farcical]] match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/euro/|title=Title History: European|accessdate=July 16, 2008|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== First retirement and hiatus (1998−2002) ====
[[Image:Shawn-Michaels-on-RAW-08.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Michaels was the WWF Commissioner in 1998]]
At the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|1998 Royal Rumble]], in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|casket match]] against The Undertaker, Michaels took a [[Professional wrestling throws#Back body drop|back body drop]] to the outside of the ring and hit his lower back on the [[Coffin|casket]], causing him to [[Spinal disc herniation|herniate two discs]] and crush one completely.&lt;ref name=stopper/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels went on to win the match&lt;ref name=stopper/&gt; but the injury rendered him unable to compete on the following month's [[No Way Out of Texas: In Your House]] as advertised, and forced him into retirement a night after losing the WWF World Heavyweight Championship to Stone Cold Steve Austin at [[WrestleMania XIV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Assael|Mooneyham|2002|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being away for nearly four months, Michaels made a surprise return to the WWF as a guest commentator on the July 13 episode of ''Raw Is War''. Michaels continued to make non-wrestling appearances on WWF programming and on November 23 he replaced [[Sgt. Slaughter]] as the [[Professional wrestling authority figures#Commissioners|WWF Commissioner]], a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer, eventually joining Vince McMahon's group of wrestlers called [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]] as a villain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Raw is War|serieslink=WWE Raw|series=WWE Raw|network=[[USA Network]]|airdate=1998-11-23|season=6|number=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout late 1998 and early 1999, Michaels made regular television appearances on ''Raw'', in which he scheduled matches, throwing around his authority, and sometimes even deciding the outcome of matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Raw is War|serieslink=WWE Raw|series=WWE Raw|network=[[USA Network]]|airdate=1998-11-30|season=6|number=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Raw is War|serieslink=WWE Raw|series=WWE Raw|network=[[USA Network]]|airdate=1998-12-21|season=6|number=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title= Raw is War|serieslink=WWE Raw|series=WWE Raw|network=[[USA Network]]|airdate=1998-12-28|season=6|number=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the January 4, 1999 episode of ''Raw Is War'', Michaels re-joined DX as a fan favorite, but disappeared from WWF television for a few weeks to have back surgery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mr. X|title=Foley win Rocks WWF|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/jan9_fol.html|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|work=Slam!

That allows Michaels to be absent {{sic|for a|while|expected=for a while}} and he'll have back surgery.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the time he returned DX was on the way of dissolving within the next couple of months.

On November 23, 1999, Michaels made a special appearance for [[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling]] at the [[FMW 10th Anniversary Show|10th Anniversary Show]] at the [[Yokohama Arena]], serving as the guest referee for the [[Hayabusa (wrestler)|H]] vs [[Mr. Gannosuke|fake Hayabusa (Mr. Gannosuke)]] main event. He got himself involved in the match when Gannosuke delivered a low blow on him and he responded later on with ''Sweet Chin Music''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fmwwrestling.us/FMWHistory3.html|title=FMW History Part 3|publisher=FMW World|accessdate=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michaels made occasional appearances as the WWF Commissioner during the spring and summer of 1999, but remained absent from television after August until May 15, 2000, when he returned on ''Raw Is War'' to declare himself the special guest referee for [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] and Triple H's Iron Man match at [[Judgment Day (2000)|Judgment Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac &amp; Book of Facts|work=Wrestling's Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; One month later, Michaels briefly reappeared on ''Raw Is War'' to hand over the role of Commissioner to [[Mick Foley]] and after another appearance in October he did not make any in-ring appearances until mid-2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Raw is War|serieslink=WWE Raw|series=WWE Raw|network=[[USA Network]]|airdate=2000-06-26|season=8|number=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he appeared briefly on television to make a speech at [[The World (WWE)|WWF New York]] during [[Armageddon (2000)|Armageddon]] in December 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=John|last=Powell|url=http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingPPV/dec11_wwfarm-can.html|title=Armageddon: WWF saves the worst for last|accessdate=March 25, 2011|date=December 11, 2000|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|work=Slam! Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels also had no part at all in the [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|Invasion storyline]].

Believing that his wrestling career was over, Michaels was interested in training individuals who wanted to become professional wrestlers.&lt;ref name="training academy"&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=299–302}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw potential in using his name and opened the [[Texas Wrestling Academy|Shawn Michaels Wrestling Academy]] in 1999, after his [[lawyer]] Skip McCormick suggested the idea.&lt;ref name="training academy"/&gt; Michaels left the academy in 2002,&lt;ref name="training academy"/&gt; giving co-founder Rudy Boy Gonzalez sole responsibility due to Michaels' new contract with WWE.&lt;ref name=stopper/&gt; Michaels was also a sportscaster for [[San Antonio]]'s local news for a short period during his retirement.&lt;ref name="training academy"/&gt;

Michaels was still contracted to the WWF (known by May 2002 as World Wrestling Entertainment, WWE) during this period.

==== Feud with Triple H (2002–2004) ====
On the June 3 episode of ''Raw'', Michaels returned to WWE television after 18 months of absence when Kevin Nash announced him as a new member of the recently reformed [[The New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo). Michaels was the only nWo member to have never worked in WCW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last=McAvennie|title=WWE The Yearbook: 2003 Edition|publisher=[[WWE Books]]|date=April 2003|isbn=0-7434-6373-0|pages=140–141|quote=The Black and White seemed complete after Kevin Nash announced the New World Order's latest recruitment at the June 3 ''Raw:'' the king of WWE "Attitude," Shawn Michaels!}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the nWo had disbanded, Triple H appeared to make amends with Michaels. This was solidified when Michaels pleaded Triple H to return to ''Raw''.&lt;ref name="Raw - July 22"/&gt; Later on, they came down to the ring sporting their DX music and attire. When the pair was about to perform their trademark "Suck It" taunt, Triple H turned on Michaels by performing a [[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Pedigree]] on him.&lt;ref name="Raw - July 22"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/results/raw/83.shtml|title=WWE Raw Results – July 22, 2002|first=Adam|last=Martin|accessdate=July 17, 2008|date=July 22, 2002|publisher=WrestleView.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing the angle, a week later, Triple H attacked Michaels from behind in a parking lot and put his head through a car window, in storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Adam|last=Martin|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/results/raw/84.shtml|title=WWE Raw Results – July 29, 2002|accessdate= July 17, 2008|date=July 29, 2002|publisher=WrestleView.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Michaels challenged Triple H to "a fight" (a non-sanctioned match) at [[SummerSlam (2002)|SummerSlam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/results/raw/85.shtml|title=Full WWE Raw Results – 8/05/02|last=Nemer|first=Paul|date=August 5, 2002|publisher=WrestleView.com|accessdate=September 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Triple H accepted, laying the foundation for a rivalry that lasted for several years.

== Legacy ==
Michaels is considered one of the greatest wrestlers in history.&lt;ref name="GOAT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tribpub.com/gdpr/baltimoresun.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-news-rumors-shawn-michaels-open-to-one-more-match-u-k-tournament-details/&lt;/ref&gt; He received praises for several matches, including 15 Match of the Year awards between Pro Wrestling Illustrated and Wrestling Observer Newsletter. Also, his match at WrestleMania 24 against Ric Flair was named Match of the Decade by the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Dave Meltzer, from Wrestling Observer Newsletter, gave him two 5 stars matches (the Ladder match against Razor Ramon at WrestleMania X and the first Hell in a Cell against The Undertaker at Bad Blood 1998). After several acclaimed matches at WrestleMania, Michaels has been known as Mr. WrestleMania.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/is-shawn-michaels-wwes-real-mr-wrestlemania-ranking-the-15-best/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.skysports.com/wwe/news/14203/11187125/kevin-owens-shawn-michaels-inspired-me-to-become-a-wrestler&lt;/ref&gt; Sumit Rehal of Independent UK in his top 10 WrestleMania matches listed Michels 3 times (vs Razor Ramor at WrestleMania X, vs Bret Hart at WrestleMania XII and vs The Undertaker at WrestleMania XXV).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/wwe-mma-wrestling/wrestlemania-30-top-ten-wrestlemania-matches-of-all-time-9241050.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Dave Richard of CBS Sports ranked his match against Steve Austin at WrestleMania XIV as the best main event in WrestleMania history.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbssports.com/general/news/ranking-every-wwe-wrestlemania-main-event-match-from-worst-to-best/&lt;/ref&gt;

His rivalry with Bret Hart has been named one of the best rivalries in WWE history.&lt;ref&gt;http://grantland.com/features/one-wwe-greatest-rivalries/&lt;/ref&gt;

After 8 years retired from in-ring competition, Michaels made his return at Crown Jewel, receiving criticism from the fans and media. After his match, Brad Shepard from Oh You Didn't Know? said "he [Michaels] had a total disaster of a match at Crown Jewel".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ringsidenews.com/2018/11/14/shawn-michaels-reportedly-likely-wrestle-wwe/&lt;/ref&gt; PWTorch's Wade Keller said "Michaels shows glimpses and didn’t embarrass himself".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pwtorch.com/site/2018/11/02/wwe-crown-jewel-results-11-2-kellers-report-on-styles-vs-joe-strowman-vs-lesnar-world-cup-tournament-michaels-triple-h-vs-kane-undertaker/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Hickenbottom's first marriage, to Theresa Wood, soon ended in an amicably settled divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married Rebecca Curci, a former WCW [[Nitro Girls|Nitro Girl]] known as Whisper, on March 31, 1999, at the [[Graceland Wedding Chapel]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the couple and an [[Elvis impersonator]] were present. Their son, Cameron Kade, was born on January 15, 2000, and a daughter, Cheyenne, born on August 19, 2004 followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=329}}&lt;/ref&gt; His cousin [[Matt Bentley]] is also a professional wrestler, having wrestled in [[Impact Wrestling|TNA]] and WWE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=John M.|last=Milner|author2=Jaya Roopansingh|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/bentley-matt.html|title=Matt Bentley|accessdate=October 27, 2011|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|work=Slam! Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Hickenbottom posed for a non-nude layout in ''[[Playgirl]]'' magazine. Only after he posed did he discover ''Playgirl'' has a mostly homosexual readership, for which some of his fellow wrestlers teased him.&lt;ref name="playgirl"&gt;{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is [[Cross-dominance|ambidextrous]], and had trouble differentiating between right and left, which affected his football games as a boy. He uses his right hand to draw and color and his left hand to write. He typically kicks with his right leg in Sweet Chin Music, but uses either arm for his signature elbow drop, depending on position.&lt;ref name=sm15/&gt;

In 1987, Hickenbottom developed a pattern of "heavy" [[substance abuse]], which eventually alienated some of his closest friends. He [[Suicidal ideation|contemplated]] [[suicide]] in the late 1980s, and suggested that [[psychological intervention]] was "probably sorely needed" by the late 1990s. His wife Rebecca observed: "There was something in him that he despised, and he was self-destructing." Hickenbottom's fear that he was going to negatively influence his young son, prompted him to abandon his previous lifestyle.&lt;ref name="HAT"/&gt;

Hickenbottom became a [[Born again|born-again Christian]] on April 24, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Shawn Michaels|series=Off the Record with Michael Landsberg|series-link=Off the Record with Michael Landsberg|network=[[The Sports Network|TSN]]|date=March 24, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], but became a [[non-denominational Christian]] because of his wife.&lt;ref name="HAT"/&gt; His later ring attire often incorporated [[Christian cross|cross symbols]] and he made a praying gesture on his knees during ring entrances. Hickenbottom was in the audience for a televised service of [[John Hagee]]'s Cornerstone Church in his hometown, San Antonio, where he is also a Bible teacher.&lt;ref name="HAT"/&gt; In 2008, he appeared on a [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] program with fellow professional wrestler [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tbn.org/about/newsletter/index.php/793.html|title=TBN Newsletter|accessdate=July 17, 2008|publisher=[[Trinity Broadcasting Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HBK Line ===
During their [[2015-16 Pittsburgh Penguins season|2015-16 season]], the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] of the [[National Hockey League]] named a [[Line (ice hockey)|line]], consisting of [[Carl Hagelin]], [[Nick Bonino]] and [[Phil Kessel]], the "HBK Line" due to the fact that the trio's first initials, of their last names, recall Michaels' "Heartbreak Kid" moniker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bombulie|first=Jonathan|title='HBK' line shines as Penguins take series lead against Lightning|url=http://triblive.com/sports/penguins/10481193-74/game-penguins-hagelin|date=May 18, 2016|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After weeks of having fun with Penguins fans on [[Twitter]], the team officially invited Michaels for their [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] [[2016 Stanley Cup playoffs|Finals Game 5]] matchup with the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] (which consists of several wrestlers in its fanbase, including [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Titus O'Neil]]) at [[Consol Energy Center]], upon which Michaels accepted. Michaels met with Penguins' owner [[Mario Lemieux]] and sat with former [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]' defensive lineman [[Brett Keisel]] during the game. Keisel also gave Michaels a tour of the city including at the Steelers headquarters and having lunch at [[Primanti Brothers]] in the city's [[Strip District, Pittsburgh|Strip District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.si.com/nhl/2016/05/22/shawn-michaels-pittsburgh-penguins-hbk-line-mario-lemieux-primanti-bros|title=Wrestler Shawn Michaels takes in Game 5 of Penguins-Lightning|publisher=''[[Sports Illustrated]]''|last=Marraza|first=Dan|date=May 22, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Penguins lost the game in overtime 4-3, but went on to defeat the Lightning in the series and advance to the [[2016 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]], eventually defeating the [[San Jose Sharks]] for the [[Stanley Cup]]. Michaels eventually befriended Keisel and attended his annual "Shear Da Beard" event in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://triblive.com/local/allegheny/11921219-74/keisel-event-friends|title=Keisel's 'Shear Da Beard' event expected to top $300,000 for childrens' charity|first=Karen|last=Price|website=TribLIVE.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of his numerous appearances with WWE, it was not Michaels first visit to [[Pittsburgh]]. In 2013, he appeared at the opening of the first [[Field &amp; Stream (retailer)|Field &amp; Stream]] store in suburban [[Cranberry Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania|Cranberry Township]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wtae.com/news/local/butler/wwe-hall-of-famer-shawn-michaels-like-kid-in-a-candy-store-at-new-field-stream/-/10928542/21510198/-/29viiwz/-/index.html |title=WWE Hall of Famer Shawn Michaels 'like kid in a candy store' at new Field &amp; Stream |date=June 11, 2014 |work=WTAE |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010070840/http://www.wtae.com/news/local/butler/wwe-hall-of-famer-shawn-michaels-like-kid-in-a-candy-store-at-new-field-stream/-/10928542/21510198/-/29viiwz/-/index.html |archivedate=October 10, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Penguins successfully defended their Stanley Cup championship [[2017 Stanley Cup Finals|the following year]], the HBK Line was broken up when Kessel was moved to the 2nd line with [[Evgeni Malkin]] and Bonino left the team in free agency.

The '''Sousa Archives and Center for American Music''' ('''SACAM''') documents [[Music of the United States|American music]] through historical artifacts and [[Archive|archival records]] in multiple formats. The center is part of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign#Libraries|University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign's library system]] and the [[UIUC College of Fine and Applied Arts#Academic units|University of Illinois School of Music]].

Among the center's important collections are archives of [[John Philip Sousa]], [[Albert Austin Harding]] (Illinois' first band-master), [[Herbert L. Clarke]] and the [[Marching Illini|University of Illinois Bands]]. The center is devoted to collection and [[preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]], public access, exhibitions, publications, and scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.illinois.edu/sousa/?p=home|title=The Sousa Archives and Center For American Music|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The center is located in the [[Harding Band Building]] on the campus of the University of Illinois. It operates as a museum, with annual rotating exhibits on themes such as Baseball and Music, Women and Music, Technology and Music, and events during the annual November Music Month in [[Champaign-Urbana]]. All collections are accessible to the public and are regularly used in exhibit displays and public programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.illinois.edu/sousa/?p=special|title=The Sousa Archives and Center For American Music|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
The center opened in 1994 with the transfer from the University Bands of the  Sousa and  Clarke personal papers, and related materials. (The Bands had previous acquired Sousa's papers from a personal connection between Sousa and Harding, the University of Illinois' first band-master.) Since then, additional  collections have been added. These include over 50  record series documenting the history of American music, and music and performing arts at the University of Illinois. In addition to the Sousa, Clarke and Harding material, there are papers and music by and about [[Harry Partch]], [[Harry Begian]], [[Salvatore Martirano]], [[Pietro A. Cipollone]], [[Elbern Alkire]], [[Paul Martin Zonn]], [[Kenneth Gaburo]], [[Paul Bierley]] and [[Virginia Root]]. There are instrument collections from Alkire and [[Carl Busch]], and the Jack Linker Sound Recording Collection. The archives of the [[Association of Concert Bands]] is also held by the center, including administrative files, convention and concert programs, photographs, and sound recordings. The center also houses the Sal-Mar Construction, an electronic music system created by Salvatore Martirano, which enabled him to write and perform music that mixed human and computer-generated sounds and composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.illinois.edu/sousa/?p=collections|title=The Sousa Archives and Center For American Music|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sousa collection also includes The Claude Gordon Personal Papers and Music Instrument Collection, 1888–1992, which consists of music and correspondence with Herbert L. Clarke and other notable trumpet artists, educational material, publicity and memorabilia, and performance contracts. Claude Gordan, a long time student of Herbert L. Clarke, was an internationally renowned trumpet soloist, band leader and teacher with many methods published worldwide in several languages.

'''''The Negro Motorist Green Book''''' (at times styled '''''The Negro Motorist Green-Book''''' or titled '''''The Negro Travelers' Green Book''''') was an annual [[guide book|guidebook]] for [[African Americans|African-American]] [[Road trip|roadtrippers]], commonly referred to simply as the ''Green Book''. 

It was originated and published by New York City mailman [[Victor Hugo Green]] from 1936 to 1966, during the era of [[Jim Crow laws]], when open and often legally prescribed discrimination against non-whites was widespread. 

==History==
Although pervasive racial discrimination and poverty limited black car ownership, the emerging [[African-American middle class]] bought automobiles as soon as they could, but faced a variety of dangers and inconveniences along the road, from refusal of food and lodging to arbitrary arrest. In response, Green wrote his guide to services and places relatively friendly to African-Americans, eventually expanding its coverage from the New York area to much of North America, as well as founding a travel agency.

Many Black Americans took to driving, in part to avoid segregation on public transportation. As the writer [[George Schuyler]] put it in 1930, "all Negroes who can do so purchase an automobile as soon as possible in order to be free of discomfort, discrimination, segregation and insult."&lt;ref name="Franz242"&gt;[[#Franz|Franz]], p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; Black Americans employed as athletes, entertainers, and salesmen also traveled frequently for work purposes.

African-American travelers faced hardships such as white-owned businesses refusing to serve them or repair their vehicles, being refused accommodation or food by white-owned hotels, and threats of physical violence and forcible expulsion from whites-only "[[sundown town]]s". Green founded and published the ''Green Book'' to avoid such problems, compiling resources "to give the Negro traveler information that will keep him from running into difficulties, embarrassments and to make his trip more enjoyable."&lt;ref name="Franz246" /&gt;

From a New York-focused first edition published in 1936, Green expanded the work to cover much of North America, including most of the United States and parts of Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Bermuda. The ''Green Book'' became "the bible of black travel during Jim Crow",&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt; enabling black travelers to find lodgings, businesses, and gas stations that would serve them along the road. It was little known outside the African-American community. Shortly after passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which outlawed the types of racial discrimination that had made the ''Green Book'' necessary, publication ceased and it fell into obscurity. There has been a revived interest in it in the early 21st century in connection with studies of black travel during the [[Jim Crow era]].

Four issues (1940, 1947, 1954, and 1963) have been republished in facsimile (as of December 2017), and have sold well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Traveling while black: the African-American travel experience==
[[File:Victor Hugo Green (1892-1960) in 1956.png|thumb|187px|''The Negro Motorist Green Book'''s author, [[Victor Hugo Green]], 1956.]]

Before the legislative accomplishments of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], black travelers in the United States faced major problems unknown to most whites. [[White supremacy|White supremacists]] had long sought to restrict black mobility, and were uniformly hostile to black strangers. As a result, simple auto journeys for black people were fraught with difficulty and potential danger. They were subjected to [[racial profiling]] by police departments ("[[driving while black]]" or "DWB"), sometimes seen as "uppity" or "too prosperous" just for the act of driving, which many whites regarded as a white prerogative. They risked harassment or worse on and off the highway.&lt;ref name="Seiler88"&gt;[[#Seiler|Seiler]], p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; A bitter commentary published in a 1947 issue of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]]'s magazine, ''[[The Crisis]]'',  highlighted the uphill struggle blacks faced in recreational travel: 
{{quote|Would a Negro like to pursue a little happiness at a theater, a beach, pool, hotel, restaurant, on a train, plane, or ship, a golf course, summer or winter resort? Would he like to stop overnight at a tourist camp while he motors about his native land 'Seeing America First'? Well, just let him try!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Democracy Defined at Moscow|work=The Crisis|date=April 1947|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Such restrictions dated back to colonial times, and were found throughout the United States. After the end of legal slavery in the North and later in the South after the Civil War, most freedmen continued to live at little more than a subsistence level, but a minority of African Americans gained a measure of prosperity. They could plan leisure travel for the first time. Well-to-do blacks arranged large group excursions for as many as 2000 people at a time, for instance traveling by rail from [[New Orleans]] to resorts along the coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. In the pre-Jim Crow era this necessarily meant mingling with whites in hotels, transportation and leisure facilities.&lt;ref name="Foster"&gt;{{cite journal|title=In the Face of "Jim Crow": Prosperous Blacks and Vacations, Travel and Outdoor Leisure, 1890–1945|journal=The Journal of Negro History|volume=84|number=2|date=Spring 1999|pages=130–49|last=Foster|first=Mark S.|jstor=2649043}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were aided in this by the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]], which had made it illegal to discriminate against African Americans in [[public accommodations]] and public transportation.&lt;ref name="Armstead" /&gt;

[[File:WhiteTradeOnlyLancasterOhio.jpg|260px|thumb|Many hotels and restaurants excluded African Americans, such as this one in [[Lancaster, Ohio]], in 1938.]]
[[File:Lewis Mountain Negro Area.jpg|thumb|260px|alt=Park sign reading: "Lewis Mountain - Negro Area - Coffee Shop &amp; Cottages - Campground Picnicground - Entrance"|"Separate but equal" in practice; a separate "Negro Area" was established at Lewis Mountain in [[Shenandoah National Park]], [[Virginia]].]]

They encountered a white backlash, particularly in the South, where by 1877 [[Southern Democrats|white Democrats]] controlled every state government. The Act was declared unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] (SCOTUS) in 1883, resulting in states and cities passing numerous segregation laws. White governments in the South required even interstate railroads to enforce their segregation laws, despite national legislation requiring equal treatment of passengers. SCOTUS ruled in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896) that "[[separate but equal]]" accommodations were constitutional, but in practice, facilities for blacks were far from equal, generally being of lesser quality and underfunded.  Blacks faced restrictions and exclusion throughout the United States: if not barred entirely from facilities, they could use them only at different times from whites or in (usually inferior) "colored sections".&lt;ref name="Armstead" /&gt;

In 1917, the black writer [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] observed that the impact of "ever-recurring race discrimination" had made it so difficult to travel to any number of destinations, from popular resorts to major cities, that it was now "a puzzling query as to what to do with vacations".&lt;ref name="Armstead"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Revisiting Hotels and Other Lodgings: American Tourist Spaces through the Lens of Black Pleasure-Travelers, 1880–1950|first=Myra B.|last=Young Armstead|journal=The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts|volume=25|date=2005|pages=136–159|jstor=40007722}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a problem that came to affect an increasing number of black people in the first decades of the 20th century. Tens of thousands of southern African Americans migrated from farms in the south to factories and domestic service in the north. No longer confined to living at a subsistence level, many gained enough disposable income and time to engage in leisure travel.&lt;ref name="Foster" /&gt; 

The development of affordable mass-produced automobiles liberated black Americans from having to rely on the "Jim Crow cars" – smoky, battered and uncomfortable railroad carriages which were the separate but decidedly unequal alternatives to more salubrious whites-only carriages. As one black magazine writer commented in 1933, in an automobile "it's mighty good to be the skipper for a change, and pilot our craft whither and where we will. We feel like Vikings. What if our craft is blunt of nose and limited of power and our sea is macademized; it's good for the spirit to just give the old railroad Jim Crow the laugh."&lt;ref name="Foster" /&gt;

Middle-class blacks throughout the United States "were not at all sure how to behave or how whites would behave toward them", as Bart Landry puts it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Landry|Landry]], p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Cincinnati]], the African-American newspaper editor Wendell Dabney wrote of the situation in the 1920s that "hotels, restaurants, eating and drinking places, almost universally are closed to all people in whom the least tincture of colored blood can be detected."&lt;ref name="Armstead" /&gt; Areas without significant black populations outside the South often refused to accommodate them: not one hotel or other accommodation was open to blacks in [[Salt Lake City]] in the 1920s. Black travelers were stranded if they had to stop there overnight.&lt;ref name="Foster" /&gt; Only six percent of the more than 100 motels that lined [[U.S. Route 66]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], admitted black customers.&lt;ref name="Hinckley127" /&gt; Across the whole state of [[New Hampshire]], only three motels in 1956 served African Americans.&lt;ref name="Rugh77"&gt;[[#Rugh|Rugh]], p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

George Schuyler reported in 1943, "Many colored families have motored all across the United States without being able to secure overnight accommodations at a single tourist camp or hotel." He suggested that black Americans would find it easier to travel abroad than in their own country.&lt;ref name="Armstead" /&gt; In [[Chicago]] in 1945, [[St. Clair Drake]] and Horace A. Cayton reported that "the city's hotel managers, by general agreement, do not sanction the use of hotel facilities by Negroes, particularly sleeping accommodations."&lt;ref name="Drake 107"&gt;[[#Drake|Drake &amp; Cayton]], p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; One incident reported by Drake and Cayton illustrated the discriminatory treatment meted out even to blacks within racially mixed groups:
{{quote|Two colored schoolteachers and several white friends attended a luncheon at an exclusive coffee shop. The Negro women were allowed to sit down, but the waitress ignored them and served the white women. One of the colored women protested and was told that she could eat in the kitchen.&lt;ref name="Drake 107" /&gt;}}

===Coping with discrimination on the road===
[[File:African Americans with Oldsmobile.jpg|thumb|275px|An African-American family with their new Oldsmobile. Washington, D.C., April 1955.]]

While automobiles made it much easier for black Americans to be independently mobile, the difficulties they faced in traveling were such that, as Lester B. Granger of the [[National Urban League]] puts it, "so far as travel is concerned, Negroes are America's last pioneers."&lt;ref name="Seiler87"&gt;[[#Seiler|Seiler]], p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Black travelers often had to carry buckets or portable toilets in the trunks of their cars because they were usually barred from bathrooms and rest areas in service stations and roadside stops. Travel essentials such as gasoline were difficult to purchase because of discrimination at gas stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Race/R_Casestudy/R_Casestudy.htm|title=Driving While Black: The Car and Race Relations in Modern America|work=Automobile in American Life and Society|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas J.|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid such problems on long trips, African Americans often packed meals and carried containers of gasoline in their cars.&lt;ref name="WaPo"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/11/AR2010091105358.html|title=Guidebook that aided black travelers during segregation reveals vastly different D.C.|last=Freedom du Lac|first=J.|work=The Washington Post|date=September 12, 2010|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing of the road trips that he made as a boy in the 1950s, Courtland Milloy of the ''Washington Post'' recalled that his mother spent the evening before the trip frying chicken and boiling eggs so that his family would have something to eat along the way the next day.&lt;ref name="Milloy"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/24/AR2005062400510.html|title=Black Highways: Thirty Years Ago We Didn't Dare Stop|work=The Washington Post|last=Milloy|first=Courtland|date=June 21, 1987|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One black motorist observed in the early 1940s that while black travelers felt free in the mornings, by the early afternoon a "small cloud" had appeared. By the late afternoon, "it casts a shadow of apprehension on our hearts and sours us a little. 'Where,' it asks us, 'will you stay tonight?'".&lt;ref name="Foster" /&gt; They often had to spend hours in the evening trying to find somewhere to stay, sometimes resorting to sleeping in haylofts or in their own cars if they could not find anywhere. One alternative, if it was available, was to arrange in advance to sleep at the homes of black friends in towns or cities along their route. However, this meant detours and an abandonment of the spontaneity that for many was a key attraction of motoring.&lt;ref name="Foster" /&gt;

The civil rights leader [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] has recalled how his family prepared for a trip in 1951:
{{quote|There would be no restaurant for us to stop at until we were well out of the South, so we took our restaurant right in the car with us.... Stopping for gas and to use the bathroom took careful planning. Uncle Otis had made this trip before, and he knew which places along the way offered "colored" bathrooms and which were better just to pass on by. Our map was marked and our route was planned that way, by the distances between service stations where it would be safe for us to stop.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wright|Wright]], pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Finding accommodation was one of the greatest challenges faced by black travelers. Not only did many hotels, motels, and boarding houses refuse to serve black customers, but thousands of towns across the United States declared themselves "[[sundown town]]s," which all non-whites had to leave by sunset.&lt;ref name="Seiler87" /&gt; Huge numbers of towns across the country were effectively off-limits to African Americans. By the end of the 1960s, there were an estimated 10,000 sundown towns across the U.S.&amp;nbsp;– including large suburbs such as [[Glendale, California]] (population 60,000 at the time); [[Levittown, New York]] (80,000); and [[Warren, Michigan]] (180,000). Over half the incorporated communities in Illinois were sundown towns. The unofficial slogan of [[Anna, Illinois]], which had violently expelled its African-American population in 1909, was "'''A'''in't '''N'''o '''N'''iggers '''A'''llowed".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Loewen|Loewen]], pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Even in towns which did not exclude overnight stays by blacks, accommodations were often very limited. African Americans migrating to California to find work in the early 1940s often found themselves camping by the roadside overnight for lack of any hotel accommodation along the way.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Flamming|Flamming]], p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; They were acutely aware of the discriminatory treatment that they received. Courtland Milloy's mother, who took him and his brother on road trips when they were children, recalled that "after riding all day, I'd say to myself, 'Wouldn't it be nice if we could spend the night in one of those hotels?' or, 'Wouldn't it be great if we could stop for a real meal and a cup of coffee?' We'd see the little white children jumping into motel swimming pools, and you all would be in the back seat of a hot car, sweating and fighting."&lt;ref name="Milloy" /&gt;

African-American travelers faced real physical risks because of the widely differing rules of segregation that existed from place to place, and the possibility of extrajudicial violence against them. Activities that were accepted in one place could provoke violence a few miles down the road. Transgressing formal or unwritten racial codes, even inadvertently, could put travelers in considerable danger.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Trembanis|Trembanis]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Even driving etiquette was affected by racism; in the [[Mississippi Delta]] region, local custom prohibited blacks from overtaking whites, to prevent their raising dust from the unpaved roads to cover white-owned cars.&lt;ref name="Foster" /&gt; A pattern emerged of whites purposefully damaging black-owned cars to put their owners "in their place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/blog/negro-motorists-green-book|title=An atlas of self-reliance: The Negro Motorist's Green Book (1937-1964)|last=Driscoll|first=Jay|publisher=National Museum of American History|date=July 30, 2015|accessdate=December 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stopping anywhere that was not known to be safe, even to allow children in a car to relieve themselves, presented a risk; Milloy noted that his parents would urge him and his brother to control their need to use a bathroom until they could find a safe place to stop, as "those backroads were simply too dangerous for parents to stop to let their little black children pee".&lt;ref name="Milloy" /&gt;

Racist local laws, discriminatory social codes, segregated commercial facilities, racial profiling by police, and sundown towns made road journeys a minefield of constant uncertainty and risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Huffington Post| title=The Green Book: The First Travel Guide for African-Americans Dates to the 1930s|date=January 6, 2014|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kate-kelly/the-green-book-the-first_b_4549962.html|author=Kelly, Kate|accessdate=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Road trip narratives by blacks reflected their unease and the dangers they faced, presenting a more complex outlook from those written by whites extolling the joys of the road. Milloy recalls the menacing environment that he encountered during his childhood, in which he learned of "so many black travelers ... just not making it to their destinations."&lt;ref name="Milloy" /&gt;

Even foreign black dignitaries were not immune to the discrimination that African-American travelers routinely encountered. In one high-profile incident, [[Komla Agbeli Gbedemah]], the finance minister of newly independent [[Ghana]], was refused service at a [[Howard Johnson's]] restaurant at [[Dover, Delaware]], while traveling to [[Washington, D.C.]], even after identifying himself by his state position to the restaurant staff.&lt;ref name="Seiler84"&gt;[[#Seiler|Seiler]], p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The snub caused an international incident, to which an embarrassed President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] responded by inviting Gbedemah to breakfast at the White House.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeCaro|DeCaro]], p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated and sometimes violent incidents of discrimination directed against black African diplomats, particularly on [[U.S. Route 40]] between New York and Washington, D.C., led to the administration of President [[John F. Kennedy]] setting up a [[Special Protocol Service Section]] within the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] to assist black diplomats traveling and living within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LentzGower|Lentz &amp; Gower]], p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; The State Department considered issuing copies of ''The Negro Motorist Green Book'' to black diplomats, but eventually decided against steering them to black-friendly public accommodations as it wanted them "to have all of the privileges of whiteness."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wallach|Wallach]], p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John A. Williams]] wrote in his 1965 book, ''This Is My Country Too'', that he did not believe "white travelers have any idea of how much nerve and courage it requires for a Negro to drive coast to coast in America." He achieved it with "nerve, courage, and a great deal of luck," supplemented by "a rifle and shotgun, a road atlas, and ''Travelguide'', a listing of places in America where Negroes can stay without being embarrassed, insulted, or worse."&lt;ref name="primeau117"/&gt; He noted that black drivers needed to be particularly cautious in the South, where they were advised to wear a chauffeur's cap or have one visible on the front seat and pretend they were delivering a car for a white person. Along the way, he had to endure a stream of "insults of clerks, bellboys, attendants, cops, and strangers in passing cars."&lt;ref name="primeau117"/&gt; There was a constant need to keep his mind on the danger he faced; as he was well aware, "[black] people have a way of disappearing on the road."&lt;ref name="primeau117"&gt;[[#Primeau|Primeau]], p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Navigating Jim Crow: the role of the ''Green Book''==
[[File:Cabins for Colored.jpg|right|275px|thumb|The ''Green Book'' listed places that provided accommodation for black travelers, as in the case of this motel in South Carolina, which offered "Cabins for Colored".]]

Segregation meant that facilities for African-American motorists were limited, but entrepreneurs of both races realized the lucrative opportunities in marketing goods and services to black patrons.&lt;ref name="Foster" /&gt; The challenge for travelers was to find such oases in the middle of a desert of discrimination. To address this problem, African-American writers produced a number of guides to provide travel advice. These included directories of hotels, camps, road houses, and restaurants which would serve African Americans. Jewish travelers, who had long experienced discrimination at many vacation spots, created guides for their own community, though they were at least able to visibly blend in more easily with the general population.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jefferson|Jefferson]], p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; African Americans followed suit with publications such as ''Hackley and Harrison's Hotel and Apartment Guide for Colored Travelers'', published in 1930 to cover "Board, Rooms, Garage Accommodations, etc. in 300 Cities in the United States and Canada".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brevard|Brevard]], p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Negro Motorist Green Book'' was one of the best known of the African-American travel guides. It was conceived in 1932 and first published in 1936 by [[Victor H. Green]], a [[World War I]] veteran from New York City who worked as a mail carrier and later as a travel agent. He said his aim was "to give the Negro traveler information that will keep him from running into difficulties, embarrassments and to make his trip more enjoyable."&lt;ref name="Franz246"&gt;[[#Franz|Franz]], p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; According to an editorial written by Novera C. Dashiell in the Spring 1956 edition of the ''Green Book'', "the idea crystallized when not only [Green] but several friends and acquaintances complained of the difficulties encountered; oftentimes painful embarrassments suffered which ruined a vacation or business trip."&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/blog/green-book-helped-keep-african-americans-safe-on-the-road|title=‘Green Book’ Helped Keep African Americans Safe on the Road|last=Goodavage|first=Maria|publisher=PBS|date=January 10, 2013|accessdate=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green asked his readers to provide information "on the Negro motoring conditions, scenic wonders in your travels, places visited of interest and short stories on one's motoring experience." He offered a reward of one dollar for each accepted account, which he increased to five dollars by 1941.&lt;ref name="Seiler90" /&gt; He also obtained information from colleagues in the US Postal Service, who would "ask around on their routes" to find suitable public accommodations.&lt;ref name="Kahn" /&gt; The Postal Service was (and is) one of the largest employers of African Americans, and its employees were ideally situated to inform Green of which places were safe and hospitable to African-American travelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal_government/road-guide-for-african-american-civil-rights-activists-pointed-way-to-1963-march/2013/08/27/1085a2c4-0f64-11e3-8cdd-bcdc09410972_story.html|title=Road guide for African American civil rights activists pointed way to 1963 march|last=Tam|first=Ruth|work=The Washington Post|date=August 27, 2013|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
The ''Green Book's'' motto, displayed on the front cover, urged black travelers to "Carry your Green Book with you – You may need it".&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt; The 1949 edition included a quote from [[Mark Twain]]: "Travel is fatal to prejudice", inverting Twain's original meaning; as Cotton Seiler puts it, "here it was the visited, rather than the visitors, who would find themselves enriched by the encounter."&lt;ref name="Seiler92"&gt;[[#Seiler|Seiler]], p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Green commented in 1940 that the ''Green Book'' had given black Americans "something authentic to travel by and to make traveling better for the Negro."&lt;ref name="Seiler90"&gt;[[#Seiler|Seiler]], p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Its principal goal was to provide accurate information on black-friendly accommodations to answer the constant question that faced black drivers: "Where will you spend the night?" As well as essential information on lodgings, service stations and garages, it provided details of leisure facilities open to African Americans, including beauty salons, restaurants, nightclubs and country clubs.&lt;ref name="Seiler91"&gt;[[#Seiler|Seiler]], p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The listings focused on four main categories&amp;nbsp;– hotels, motels, tourist homes (private residences, usually owned by African Americans, which provided accommodation to travelers), and restaurants. They were arranged by state and subdivided by city, giving the name and address of each business. For an extra payment, businesses could have their listing displayed in bold type or have a star next to it to denote that they were "recommended".&lt;ref name="Rugh77" /&gt;

Many such establishments were run by and for African Americans and in some cases were named after prominent figures in African-American history. In North Carolina, such black-owned businesses included the [[George Washington Carver|Carver]], [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]], and [[Booker T. Washington]] hotels, the Friendly City beauty parlor, the Black Beauty Tea Room, the New Progressive tailor shop, the Big Buster tavern, and the Blue Duck Inn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lib.unc.edu/ncm/index.php/2010/08/27/traveling-while-black-a-jim-crow-survival-guide/|title=Traveling while black: A Jim Crow survival guide|last=Powell|first=Lew|publisher=University of North Carolina Library|date=August 27, 2010|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each edition also included feature articles on travel and destinations,&lt;ref name="Rugh78"&gt;[[#Rugh|Rugh]], p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and included a listing of black resorts such as [[Idlewild, Michigan]]; [[Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts]]; and [[Belmar, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="Rugh168"&gt;[[#Rugh|Rugh]], p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; The state of [[New Mexico]] was particularly recommended as a place where most motels would welcome "guests on the basis of ‘cash rather than color.'"&lt;ref name="Kahn" /&gt; &lt;syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Influence===
[[File:College View Court-Hotel Waco.jpg|right|thumb|275px|The College View Court-Hotel in [[Waco, Texas]] advertised itself in the 1950s as "Waco's Finest for Negroes".]]

The ''Green Book'' attracted sponsorship from a number of businesses, including the African-American newspapers ''[[Call and Post]]'' of [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and the ''[[Louisville Leader]]'' of [[Louisville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name="Seiler89"&gt;[[#Seiler|Seiler]], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Standard Oil]] (later [[Esso]]) was also a sponsor, owing to the efforts of James "Billboard" Jackson, a pioneering African-American Esso sales representative.&lt;ref name="Seiler90" /&gt; Esso's "race group", part of its marketing division, promoted the ''Green Book'' as enabling Esso's black customers to "go further with less anxiety". By contrast, [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]] gas stations were known to refuse black customers.&lt;ref name="Lewis269"&gt;[[#Lewis|Lewis]], p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 1949 edition included an Esso endorsement message that told readers: "As representatives of the Esso Standard Oil Co., we are pleased to recommend the ''Green Book'' for your travel convenience. Keep one on hand each year and when you are planning your trips, let Esso Touring Service supply you with maps and complete routings, and for real 'Happy Motoring'&amp;nbsp;– use Esso Products and Esso Service wherever you find the Esso sign."&lt;ref name="Hinckley127" /&gt; Photographs of some African-American entrepreneurs who owned Esso gas stations appeared in the pages of the ''Green Book''.&lt;ref name="Kahn" /&gt;

Although Green usually refrained from editorializing in the ''Green Book'', he let his readers' letters speak for the influence of his guide. William Smith of [[Hackensack, New Jersey]], described it as a "credit to the Negro Race" in a letter published in the 1938 edition. He commented:

{{quote|It is a book badly needed among our Race since the advent of the motor age. Realizing the only way we knew where and how to reach our pleasure resorts was in a way of speaking, by word of mouth, until the publication of ''The Negro Motorist Green Book''&amp;nbsp;... We earnestly believe that [it] will mean as much if not more to us as the [[AAA (American Automobile Association)|A.A.A.]] means to the white race."&lt;ref name="Seiler89" /&gt;}}

[[File:Hotel Clark, Beale Street, Memphis TN.jpg|thumb|upright=1.02|The "colored only" Hotel Clark in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].]]
Earl Hutchinson Sr., the father of journalist [[Earl Ofari Hutchinson]], wrote of a 1955 move from Chicago to California that "you literally didn't leave home without [the ''Green Book'']."&lt;ref name="Seiler94"&gt;[[#Seiler|Seiler]], p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernest Green]], one of the [[Little Rock Nine]], used the ''Green Book'' to navigate the {{convert|1000|miles}} from Arkansas to Virginia in the 1950s and comments that "it was one of the survival tools of segregated life".&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; According to the civil rights leader [[Julian Bond]], recalling his parents' use of the ''Green Book'', "it was a guidebook that told you not where the best places were to eat, but where there was ''any'' place."&lt;ref name="McGee"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/books/23green.html?pagewanted.all=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=The Open Road Wasn't Quite Open to All|last=McGee|first=Celia|work=The New York Times|date=August 22, 2010|accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bond comments:

While the ''Green Book'' was intended to make life easier for those living under Jim Crow, its publisher looked forward to a time when such guidebooks would no longer be necessary. As Green wrote, "there will be a day sometime in the near future when this guide will not have to be published. That is when we as a race will have equal opportunities and privileges in the United States. It will be a great day for us to suspend this publication for then we can go as we please, and without embarrassment."&lt;ref name="Seiler94" /&gt;

Los Angeles is now considering offering special protection to the sites that kept black travelers safe. Ken Bernstein, principal planner for the city's Office of Historic Resources notes, "At the very least, these sites can be incorporated into our city's online inventory system. They are part of the story of African Americans in Los Angeles, and the story of Los Angeles itself writ large."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-route-66-20160516-snap-story.html 'Green Book' sites along Route 66 kept traveling African Americans safe.

===Publishing history===
The ''Green Book'' was published locally in New York, but its popularity was such that from 1937 it was distributed nationally with input from Charles McDowell, a collaborator on Negro Affairs for the [[United States Travel Bureau]], a government agency.&lt;ref name="Franz246" /&gt; With new editions published annually from 1936 to 1940, the ''Green Book's'' publication was suspended during World War II and resumed in 1946.&lt;ref name="Landry57"&gt;[[#Landry|Landry]], p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Its scope expanded greatly during its years of publication; from covering only the New York City metropolitan area in the first edition, it eventually covered facilities in most of the United States and parts of Canada (primarily Montreal), Mexico and Bermuda. Coverage was good in the eastern US and weak in [[Great Plains]] states such as [[North Dakota]], where there were few black residents. It eventually sold around 15,000 copies per year, distributed by mail order, by black-owned businesses and [[Esso]] service stations, some of which&amp;nbsp;– unusual for the oil industry at the time&amp;nbsp;– were franchised to African Americans.&lt;ref name="McGee" /&gt;

It originally sold for 25 cents, increasing to $1.25 by 1957.&lt;ref name="Phoenix"&gt;{{cite news|title=African-American Travel Guide|last=Towne|first=Douglas|work=Phoenix Magazine|date=July 2011|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the book's growing success, Green retired from the post office and hired a small publishing staff that operated from 200 West 135th Street in [[Harlem]]. He also established a vacation reservation service in 1947 to take advantage of the post-war boom in automobile travel.&lt;ref name="Hinckley127" /&gt; From 10 pages in its first edition,&lt;ref name="Lewis269" /&gt; by 1949 he had expanded the ''Green Book'' to more than 80 pages, including advertisements.

The 1951 ''Green Book'' recommended that black-owned businesses raise their standards, as travelers were "no longer content to pay top prices for inferior accommodations and services". The quality of black-owned lodgings was coming under scrutiny, as many prosperous blacks found them to be second-rate compared to the white-owned lodgings from which they were excluded.&lt;ref name="Rugh84"&gt;[[#Rugh|Rugh]], p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, Green renamed the publication ''The Negro Travelers' Green Book'', in recognition of its coverage of international destinations requiring travel by plane and ship.&lt;ref name="Hinckley127" /&gt; Although segregation was still in force, by state laws in the South and often by practice elsewhere, the wide circulation of the ''Green Book'' had attracted growing interest from white businesses that wanted to tap into the potential sales of the black market. The 1955 edition noted: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;A few years after its publication ... white business has also recognized its [''The Green Book''’s] value and it is now in use by the Esso Standard Oil Co., The American Automobile Assn. and its affiliate automobile clubs throughout the country, other automobile clubs, air lines, travel bureaus, travelers aid, libraries and thousands of subscribers.&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the start of the 1960s, the ''Green Book''{{'}}s market was beginning to erode; African-American civil rights activism was having effects, even before the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] to prohibit racial segregation in public facilities. An increasing number of middle-class African Americans were beginning to question whether guides such as the ''Green Book'' were accommodating Jim Crow by steering black travelers to segregated businesses rather than encouraging them to push for equal access. Black-owned motels in remote locations off state highways lost customers to a new generation of integrated interstate motels located near freeway exits. The 1963 ''Green Book'' acknowledged that the activism of the civil rights movement had "widened the areas of public accommodations accessible to all," but it defended the continued listing of black-friendly businesses because "a family planning for a vacation hopes for one that is free of tensions and problems."&lt;ref name="Rugh84"&gt;[[#Rugh|Rugh]], p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1966 edition was the last to be published after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 made the guide effectively obsolete by outlawing racial discrimination in public accommodations.&lt;ref name="Hinckley127"&gt;[[#Hinckley|Hinckley]], p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; The last edition of the ''Green Book'' included significant changes that reflected the post-Civil Rights Act outlook. The title was changed to ''Traveler's Green Book: International Edition'' – no longer just for the Negro, or the motorist – as its publishers sought to widen its appeal. Although the content continued to proclaim its mission of highlighting leisure options for black travelers, the cover featured an affluent white blonde water-skiing – a sign of how, as Michael Ra-Shon Hall puts it, "the Green Book ‘whitened’ its surface and internationalized its scope, while still remaining true to its founding mission to ensure the security of African-American travelers both in the US and abroad."&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt;

==Representation in other media==
In the 2000s, academics, artists, curators, and writers exploring the history of African-American travel in the United States during the Jim Crow era revived interest in the ''Green Book''.

===Literature===
*African-American playwright [[Calvin Alexander Ramsey]] published a [[children's book]], ''Ruth and the Green Book'' (2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Ramsey, Calvin Alexander|title=Ruth and the Green Book| isbn=9780761352556 | publisher=Carolrhoda Book|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; about a Chicago family's journey to Alabama in 1952, in which they use the ''Green Book'' as a guide.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/US/02/24/green.book.black.history/index.html|title=Travel guide helped African-Americans navigate tricky times|first1=Emma|last1=Lacey-Bordeaux|first2=Wayne|last2=Drash|publisher=CNN|date=February 25, 2011|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ramsey also wrote a play, called ''The Green Book: A Play in Two Acts'', which debuted in Atlanta in August 2011&lt;ref name="Phoenix" /&gt; after a staged reading at the [[Lincoln Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Lincoln Theatre]] in Washington, DC in 2010.&lt;ref name="WaPo"/&gt; It centers on a tourist home in [[Jefferson City, Missouri]]. A black military officer, his wife, and a Jewish survivor of [[the Holocaust]] spend the night in the home just before the civil rights activist [[W.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;B. Du Bois]] is scheduled to deliver a speech in town. The Jewish traveler comes to the home after being shocked to find that the hotel where he planned to stay has a "No Negroes Allowed" notice posted in its lobby&amp;nbsp;– an allusion to the problems of discrimination that Jews and blacks both faced at the time.&lt;ref name="McGee" /&gt; The play was highly successful, gaining an extension of several weeks beyond its planned closing date.&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt;
*Matt Ruff's horror-fantasy novel ''[[Lovecraft Country (novel)|Lovecraft Country]]'' (2016) (set in Chicago) features a fictionalized version of Green and the ''Travel Guide'' known as the "Safe Negro Travel Guide"
*In Toni Morrison's ''[[Home (Morrison novel)|Home]]'' (2012), the narrator makes a brief reference to the Green Book: "From Green's travelers' book he copies out some addresses and names of rooming houses, hotels where he would not be turned away" (22-23).
