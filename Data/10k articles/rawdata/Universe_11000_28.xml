The '''Aero-propulsion Systems Test Facility''', located at [[Arnold Engineering Development Complex]] is a unique national facility designed to test aircraft propulsion systems in true mission environments without leaving the ground.&lt;ref name="af"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arnold.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=13714 |title=Factsheets : PROPULSION WIND TUNNEL FACILITY |publisher=arnold.af.mil |accessdate=2014-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113223928/http://www.arnold.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=13714 |archivedate=2013-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The test unit is owned by the [[United States Air Force]] and operated by [http://nas-llc.us/ National Aerospace Solutions].

== History ==
The need for an advanced ground-based, propulsion test facility was identified by a joint NASA and Department of Defense Aeronautics and Astronautics Coordinating Board in the 1960s. The Aero-propulsion Systems Test Facility was specifically designed for testing integrated, full-scale propulsion systems under simulated flight conditions. Construction begun in 1977 and took seven years to complete. Following integration and activation, the facility reached initial operational capability in September 1985.

== Capabilities ==
The Facility can simulate altitudes up to 75,000&amp;nbsp;feet, at speeds up to Mach 2.3, for engines rated up to 100,000&amp;nbsp;pounds of thrust. The air supply compressors can provide up to 1,500&amp;nbsp;pounds of air per second into the test cell to simulate airspeeds up to 1,800&amp;nbsp;miles per hour. The compressors, totaling 215,000 horsepower, are started by one of the largest variable frequency starting systems in the world.&lt;ref name="af"/&gt;  An additional 960&amp;nbsp;pounds per second of airflow is also available by drawing outside air directly into the C-2 test cell.

Inlet air to the tested propulsion systems can be conditioned up to 450&amp;nbsp;degrees Fahrenheit by large combustion air heaters. These heaters can burn either diesel fuel or waste aviation fuel and generate up to 1,000,000,000&amp;nbsp;BTU per hour. Exhaust gases are cooled by direct-contact water spray, which reduces the temperature to 200&amp;nbsp;degrees Fahrenheit. Additional water spray cools and cleans the exhaust gas to less than 150&amp;nbsp;degrees Fahrenheit before it enters the exhaust compressors.

'''Agrivoltaics''' is co-developing the same area of [[land]] for both solar [[photovoltaic]] power as well as for conventional [[agriculture]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dinesh|first=Harshavardhan|last2=Pearce|first2=Joshua M.|title=The potential of agrivoltaic systems|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2015.10.024|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=54|pages=299–308|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2015.10.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique was originally conceived by [[Adolf Goetzberger]] and Armin Zastrow in 1981.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=GOETZBERGER|first=A.|last2=ZASTROW|first2=A.|date=1982-01-01|title=On the Coexistence of Solar-Energy Conversion and Plant Cultivation|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01425918208909875|journal=International Journal of Solar Energy|volume=1|issue=1|pages=55–69|doi=10.1080/01425918208909875|issn=0142-5919|bibcode=1982IJSE....1...55G}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coexistence of solar panels and crops implies a sharing of light between these two types of production.

Agrivoltaics has been massively implemented in Japan since 2004 and then, Agrivoltaics has expanded in Asia and Europe. Several crops can benefit from these systems, including fruit production.

== History ==
In 1981, [[Adolf Goetzberger]] and Armin Zastrow were the first to propose the concept of a dual use of arable land for solar energy production and plant cultivation  in order to improve overall production.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; They were addressing the ongoing discussion on the competition for the use of arable land between solar energy production and crop. The light saturation point is the maximum amount of photons absorbable by a plant species. As more photons won’t increase to the rate of photosynthesis, Akira Nagashima suggest to combine PV systems and farming to use the excess of light. He developed the first prototypes in Japan in 2004.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2013/10/japan-next-generation-farmers-cultivate-agriculture-and-solar-energy.html|title=Japan Next-Generation Farmers Cultivate Crops and Solar Energy|website=renewableenergyworld.com|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term “agrivoltaic“ was used for the first time in a publication in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dupraz|first=C.|last2=Marrou|first2=H.|last3=Talbot|first3=G.|last4=Dufour|first4=L.|last5=Nogier|first5=A.|last6=Ferard|first6=Y.|title=Combining solar photovoltaic panels and food crops for optimising land use: Towards new agrivoltaic schemes|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2011.03.005|journal=Renewable Energy|volume=36|issue=10|pages=2725–2732|doi=10.1016/j.renene.2011.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is known under several names in the world: "agrophotovoltaics" in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schindele|first=Stefan|date=2013|title=Combining Pv And Food Crops To Agrophotovoltaic–Optimization Of Orientation And Harvest|url=|journal=13th IAEE European Conference|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agrophotovoltaik.de|title=APV Resola|website=APV Resola|language=de|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; "agrovoltaics" in Italy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rinnovabili.it/energia/fotovoltaico/agrovoltaico-equilibrio-perfetto/|title=Agrovoltaico, equilibrio perfetto {{!}} Rinnovabili|website=rinnovabili.it|language=it-IT|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.remtec.energy/en/agrovoltaico/|title=Agrovoltaico - Rem Tec|work=Rem Tec|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; "solar sharing" in Asia.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.i-sis.org.uk/Japanese_Farmers_Producing_Crops_and_Solar_Energy.php|title=Japanese Farmers Producing Crops and Solar Energy Simultaneously|website=i-sis.org.uk|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facilities such as photovoltaic greenhouses can be considered as agrivoltaic systems.

As one of the objectives of the agricultural systems is to preserve agricultural land, it is generally considered that agricultural production in agrivoltaic should not be neglected. The constraints on agricultural production vary from one country to another according to the legislation or according to the type of crop and to the objectives of the agrivoltaic system (optimization of the volume of agricultural production, quality of agricultural products, energy production...).

== Agrivoltaics in the world ==

=== Asia ===
[[Japan]] has been the forerunner in the development of open field agrivoltaics worldwide since 2004. Between 2004 and 2017, more than 1,000 open field power plants were developed in Japan.

==== Japan ====
In 2004 in Japan, Akira Nagashima developed a demountable structure that he tested on several crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2013/10/japan-next-generation-farmers-cultivate-agriculture-and-solar-energy.html|title=Japan Next-Generation Farmers Cultivate Crops and Solar Energy|website=renewableenergyworld.com|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, many field projects have been installed in Japan with a large number of crops (citrus fruits, peanuts, eggplants, cucumbers, cabbage, rice, vines, mushrooms ...) or livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.i-sis.org.uk/Japanese_Farmers_Producing_Crops_and_Solar_Energy.php|title=Japanese Farmers Producing Crops and Solar Energy Simultaneously|website=i-sis.org.uk|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removable structures allow farmers to remove or move facilities based on crop rotations and their needs. Increasingly large plants with capacities of several MW have been developed since 2004 with permanent structures and dynamic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://agrijournal.jp/renewableenergy/37506/|title=日本で最も有名なソーラーシェアリング成功事例！ 匝瑳市における地域活性プロジェクトとは {{!}} AGRI JOURNAL|date=2018-03-06|work=AGRI JOURNAL|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://solarjournal.jp/solarpower/20442/|title=耕作放棄地を豊かに！"メガ"ソーラーシェアリング {{!}} SOLAR JOURNAL|date=2017-11-27|work=SOLAR JOURNAL|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://solarjournal.jp/solarpower/20546/|title=ソーラーシェアリングには「追尾式架台」がベスト！ {{!}} SOLAR JOURNAL|date=2017-12-01|work=SOLAR JOURNAL|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a 35 MW power plant, installed on 54 ha of crops, was commissioned in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tech.nikkeibp.co.jp/dm/atclen/news_en/15mk/030601952/?ST=msbe?ST=msbe&amp;P=4|title=Chinese Power Company Runs Solar Plant in Harmony With Local Community - Visit to Plant - Solar Power Plant Business|website=tech.nikkeibp.co.jp|language=en|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shading rate of this plant is 50%, a value higher than the 30% shading usually used on Japanese agrivoltaic power plants. Farmers cultivate, among others, ginseng, ashitaba and coriander. Soon, the island of Ukujima should host a solar power plant of 480 MW, part of which will be agrivoltaics. The project has been under study since 2013 and the various partners have signed an agreement for the start of construction in 2019.

To obtain permission to exploit solar panels over crops, Japanese law requires farmers to maintain at least 80% of agricultural production.

==== China ====
In 2016, the Italian company REM TEC built a 0.5 MWp agrivoltaic power plant in Jinzhai County, [[Anhui]] Province. Chinese companies have developed several GWs of solar power plants combining agriculture and solar energy production, either photovoltaic greenhouses or open-field installations. For example, in August 2016, Panda Green Energy installed solar panels over vineyards in Turpan, [[Xinjiang]] Uygur Autonomous Region. The 0.2 MW plant was connected to the grid. The project was audited in October 2017 and the company has received approval to roll out its system across the country. Projects of several tens of MW have been deployed. For instance, in 2016, in [[Jiangxi]] Province, a 70 MW agrivoltaic plant was installed on agricultural and forestry crops.

For 30 years, the Elion Group has been trying to combat desertification in the Kubuqi region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4851013/china-greening-kubuqi-desert-land-restoration/|title=What We Can Learn From the Greening of China's Kubuqi Desert|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the techniques used, agrivoltaic systems were installed to protect crops and produce electricity. Regarding the equipment for the desert areas, Wan You-Bao patented in 2007 on a shade system to protect crops in the desert. The shades are equipped with solar panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=US&amp;NR=2008148631A1&amp;KC=A1&amp;FT=D#|title=Apparatus and Method For Desert Environmental Control And For Promoting Desert Plants Growth|last=|first=|date=|website=worldwide.espacenet.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== South Korea ====
South Korea is conducting initial tests of agrivoltaic power plants, drawing on the Japanese example since 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ARIRANG NEWS|title=Solar farming is growing as option for producing renewable energy|date=2017-08-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKXlx2riMgo|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agrivoltaic is one of the solutions studied to increase the share of renewable energies in Korea's energy mix. Their goal is to reach 20% renewable energy in 2030 against 5% in 2017.

==== India ====
Projects for isolated sites are being studied by [[Amity University, Noida|Amity University]] in [[Noida]], northern India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cityairnews.com/content/farmers-maximize-profit-through-%E2%80%98agri-voltaic-solar-energy-and-harvesting-project%E2%80%99|title=Farmers to maximize profit through ‘Agri- Voltaic: a Solar Energy and Harvesting Project’ {{!}} City Air News|website=cityairnews.com|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in 2017 looks at the potential of agrivoltaism for vineyards in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-10-01|title=Agrivoltaic potential on grape farms in India|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2213138817302096|journal=Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments|language=en|volume=23|pages=104–110|doi=10.1016/j.seta.2017.08.004|issn=2213-1388}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agrivoltaic systems studied in this article consist of solar panels intercalated between crops to limit shading on plants. This study suggests that agrivoltaic systems can significantly increase the incomes of Indian farmers.

==== Malaysia ====
The [[Universiti Putra Malaysia]], which specializes in agronomy, launched experiments in 2015 on plantations of Orthosiphon stamineus (Java tea). It is a fixed structure installed on an experimental surface of about 0.4 ha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Othman|first=N. F.|last2=Su|first2=A. S. Mat|last3=Ya’acob|first3=M. E.|date=2018|title=Promising Potentials of Agrivoltaic Systems for the Development of Malaysia Green Economy|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1755-1315/146/i=1/a=012002|journal=IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science|language=en|volume=146|issue=1|pages=012002|doi=10.1088/1755-1315/146/1/012002|issn=1755-1315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Vietnam ====
[[Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems|Fraunhofer ISE]] has deployed their agrivoltaic system on a shrimp farm located in Bac Liêu in the Mekong Delta. According to this institute, the results of their pilot project indicate that water consumption has been reduced by 75%. Their system would offer other benefits such as shading for workers as well as a lower and stable water temperature for better shrimp growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cleantechnica.com/2018/06/21/fraunhofer-experiments-in-chile-and-vietnam-prove-value-of-agrophotovoltaic-farming/|title=Fraunhofer Experiments In Chile And Vietnam Prove Value Of Agrophotovoltaic Farming {{!}} CleanTechnica|website=cleantechnica.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
In Europe in the early 2000s, photovoltaic [[greenhouse]]s are emerging. Part of the greenhouse roof is replaced by solar panels. In Austria and then in Italy, open field agrivoltaic systems appeared from 2007, followed by France and Germany.

==== Austria ====
In 2004, Günter Czaloun proposed a photovoltaic tracking system with a rope rack system.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pveurope.eu/News/Solar-Generator/A-rope-rack-for-PV-modules|title=A rope rack for PV modules|date=2017-08-28|work=PV Europe|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first prototype is built in [[South Tyrol]] in 2007 on a 0.1 ha area. The cable structure is more than five meters above ground. A new system was presented at the Intersolar 2017 conference in Munich. This technology is potentially less expensive than other open field systems because it requires less steel.

==== Italy ====
In 2009 and 2011, agrivoltaic systems with fixed panels were installed above [[vineyard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.freshplaza.it/article/9903/Mola-di-Bari-realizzato-primo-impianto-fotovoltaico-su-un-un-vigneto-di-uva-da-tavola/|title=Mola di Bari: realizzato primo impianto fotovoltaico su un un vigneto di uva da tavola|access-date=2018-11-17|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wine-pages.com/features/italy-franciacorta-top-sparkling-wines-from-lombardy/|title=A profile of Franciacorta's sparkling wines|work=wine-pages|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments showed a slight decrease of the yield and late harvests.

In 2009, the Italian company REM TEC develops a dual-axis solar tracking system. In 2011 and 2012, REM TEC built several MWp of open field agrivoltaic power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.remtec.energy/en/agrovoltaico-2/virgilio-plant/|title=Virgilio power plant|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.remtec.energy/en/agrovoltaico-2/monticelli-dongina-plant/|title=Monticelli d'Ongina power plant|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scienzenews.it/2012/09/25/fotovoltaico-e-agricoltura-maggiore-produttivita-in-meno-spazio/|title=Fotovoltaico e agricoltura: maggiore produttività in meno spazio|last=Gandola|first=Cristina|date=2012-09-25|website=Scienze News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[solar panel]]s are installed 5 m above the ground to operate agricultural machinery. The cover of [[Solar panel|photovoltaic panels]] shadow is less than 15% to minimize the effect on the crops. They are the first to offer automated integrated shading net systems into the supporting structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.remtec.energy/en/agrovoltaico-2/shading-nets/|title=Shading nets|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; REM TEC also designs dual-axis solar tracking systems integrated into [[greenhouse]] structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.remtec.energy/en/agrovoltaico-2/greenhouse/|title=greenhouse|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The control of the position of the [[solar panel]]s would optimize the [[greenhouse]] microclimate.

==== France ====

===== Photovoltaic greenhouses =====
Since the beginning of the 2000s, photovoltaic [[greenhouse]]s have been built in France. Photovoltaic greenhouse designers continue to innovate to improve both agricultural production and power generation. For instance, the concept of Agrinergie has been developed by {{ill|Akuo Energy|fr}} since 2007. The first power plants consisted of alternation of crops and solar panels.

==== Chile ====
Three 13 kWp agro-photovoltaic systems were built in Chile in 2017. The goal of this project, supported by the Metropolitan Region of Santiago, was to study the plants that can benefit from the shading of the agrivoltaic system. The electricity produced was used to power agricultural facilities: cleaning, packaging and cold storage of agricultural production, incubator for eggs ... One of the systems was installed in a region with a lot of power outages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cleantechnica.com/2018/06/21/fraunhofer-experiments-in-chile-and-vietnam-prove-value-of-agrophotovoltaic-farming/|title=Fraunhofer Experiments In Chile And Vietnam Prove Value Of Agrophotovoltaic Farming {{!}} CleanTechnica|website=cleantechnica.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
There are three types of '''Agrivoltaics''' that are being actively researched: solar arrays with space between for crops, stilted solar array above crops and greenhouse solar array.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; All three of these systems have several variables used to maximize solar energy absorbed in both the [[Solar panel|panels]] and the crops. The main variable taken into account for '''agrivoltaic''' systems is the angle of the solar panels-called the tilt angle. Other variables taken into account for choosing the location of the '''agrivoltaic''' system are the crops chosen, height of the panels, solar irradiation in the area and climate of the area.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Configuration of agrivoltaic systems ==
There are different configurations of agrivoltaic devices. Goetzberger and Zastrow have studied the conditions for optimizing agrivoltaic installations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Presented in the early 1980s, these conditions still serve as a reference in the definition of agrivoltaic systems:

* orientation of solar panels in the south for fixed or east-west panels for panels rotating on an axis,
* sufficient spacing between solar panels for sufficient light transmission to ground crops,
* elevation of the supporting structure of the solar panels to homogenize the amounts of radiation on the ground.

Experimental facilities often have a control agricultural area. The control zone is exploited under the same conditions as the agrivoltaic device in order to study the effects of the device on the development of crops.

=== Fixed solar panels over crops ===
The simplest approach is to install fixed [[solar panel]]s on agricultural [[greenhouse]]s, above open fields crops or between open fields crops. It is possible to optimize the installation by modifying the density of [[solar panel]]s or the inclination of the panels. In [[Japan]], agrivoltaic systems generally consist of dismountable light structures with light and small size solar panels to reduce wind resistance.

=== Dynamic Agrivoltaic ===
In more elaborate configurations, agrivoltaic system use a tracking system. [[Solar panel]]s can be controlled to optimize their positioning to improve agricultural production or electricity production.

The first dynamic agrivoltaic devices were developed in Japan. The panels are manually adjustable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ken Matsuoka|title=ソーラーシェアリング回動システム　100Wパネル579枚同時駆動|date=2013-08-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsbpifQjJM0|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers can modify the position of the solar panels according to the season or stage of crop development to increase or decrease shading and power generation. Japanese companies have also developed several more sophisticated systems. For example, crops grow under systems composed of tables (25 solar panels) fixed dual axis tracker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://solarjournal.jp/solarpower/20546/|title=ソーラーシェアリングには「追尾式架台」がベスト！ {{!}} SOLAR JOURNAL|date=2017-12-01|work=SOLAR JOURNAL|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Günter Czaloun proposed a photovoltaic tracking system with a rope rack system.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Panels can be oriented to improve power generation or shade crops as needed. The first prototype is built in 2007 in [[Austria]]. The company REM TEC has deployed several plants equipped with dual axis tracking system in [[Italy]] and [[China]]. They have also developed an equivalent system used for agricultural [[greenhouse]]s.

In France, Sun'R and Agrivolta companies are developing single axis tracking systems. According to these companies, their systems can be adapgted to the needs of plants. The Sun'R system is east-west axis tracking system. According to this company, complex models of plant growth, weather forecasts, calculation and optimization software are used. The device from Agrivolta is equipped with south-facing [[solar panel]]s that can be erased by a sliding system.

The Artigianfer company developed a photovoltaic [[greenhouse]] whose solar panels are installed on movable shutters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2013136276|title=GREENHOUSE AND SYSTEM FOR GENERATING ELECTRICAL ENERGY AND GREENHOUSE CULTIVATION|last=Massimo|first=CARDELLI,|date=2013-09-20|website=patentscope.wipo.int|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panels can follow the course of the Sun along an east-west axis.

The difficulty of such systems is to find the mode of operation to maintain the good balance between the two types of production according to the goals of the system. Fine control of the panels to adapt shading to the need of plants requires advanced agronomic skills to understand the development of plants. Experimental devices are usually developed in collaboration with research centers.

==Effects==
The [[solar panels]] of '''Agrivoltaics''' affects crops and land they cover in ways more than providing shade. Two ways are affecting water flow and heat. They also allow for more revenue per acre to be created.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, grape farms with appropriate spacing could increase revenue 15 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malu|first=Prannay R.|last2=et al.|first2=|last3=|first3=|date=|title=Agrivoltaic potential on grape farms in India|url=https://www.academia.edu/34605670/Agrivoltaic_Potential_on_Grape_Farms_in_India|journal=Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments|volume=23|pages=104–110|doi=10.1016/j.seta.2017.08.004|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water Flow===
In experiments testing evaporation levels under [[Solar panel|PVP]] for shade resistant crops [[cucumber]]s and [[lettuce]] watered by irrigation, a 14-29% savings in evaporation was found.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; '''Agrivoltaics''' could be used for crops or areas where [[water efficiency]] is imperative.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Heat===
A study was done on the heat of the land, air and crops under [[solar panel]]s for a growing season. It was found that while the air beneath the panels stayed consistent, the land and plants had lower temperatures recorded.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With rising temperature from [[climate change]] this may become important for some food crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaushal|first=Neeru|last2=Bhandari|first2=Kalpna|last3=Siddique|first3=Kadambot H.M.|last4=Nayyar|first4=Harsh|title=Food crops face rising temperatures: An overview of responses, adaptive mechanisms, and approaches to improve heat tolerance|url=https://www.cogentoa.com/article/10.1080/23311932.2015.1134380|journal=Cogent Food &amp; Agriculture|volume=2|issue=1|doi=10.1080/23311932.2015.1134380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
Simulations and studies on '''Agrivoltaics''' indicate electricity and shade-resistant crop production do not decrease in productivity, allowing both to be simultaneously produced efficiently. Dinesh et al. found lettuce output was found to be comparable in '''Agrivoltaics''' to monocultures. '''Agrivoltaics''' work best for plants that are shade resistant, with potential functioning crops being "hog peanut, alfalfa, yam, taro, cassava, sweet potato" along with lettuce.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Simulations performed by Dupraz et al. found the potential of land productivity to increase by 60-70%.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, Dinesh et al. found that the value of solar generated electricity coupled to shade-tolerant crop production created an over 30% increase in economic value from farms deploying agrivoltaic systems instead of conventional agriculture.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Harshavardhan Dinesh, Joshua M. Pearce, [https://www.academia.edu/18406368/The_potential_of_agrivoltaic_systems The potential of agrivoltaic systems], ''Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews'', '''54''', 299-308 (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; It has been postulated that '''Agrivoltaics''' would be beneficial for summer crops for the microclimate they create and the side effect of heat and water flow control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aciar.gov.au/files/node/13992/to_mix_or_not_to_mix_evidences_for_the_unexpected_19701.pdf|title=To mix or not to mix : evidences for the unexpected high productivity of new complex agrivoltaic and agroforestry systems.|last=Dupraz|first=C|date=|website=|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==
Shade resistant crops are not typically grown in industrial agricultural systems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, [[wheat]] crops do not fare well in a low light environment, meaning they would not work with '''Agrivoltaics'''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; '''Agrivoltaics''' do not yet work with greenhouses. Greenhouses with half of the roof covered in panels were simulated, and the resulting crop output reduced by 64% and panel productivity reduced by 84%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castellano|first=Sergio|date=2014-12-21|title=Photovoltaic greenhouses: evaluation of shading effect and its influence on agricultural performances|url=http://www.agroengineering.org/index.php/jae/article/view/jae.2014.433|journal=Journal of Agricultural Engineering|language=en|volume=45|issue=4|pages=168–175|doi=10.4081/jae.2014.433|issn=2239-6268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alisagar''' is a park, tourist attraction and an irrigation project which is 13&amp;nbsp;km (6.2&amp;nbsp;mi) from [[Nizamabad, Telangana|Nizamabad]] and 2&amp;nbsp;km (1.2&amp;nbsp;mi) off the Nizamabad-Bodhan road. The park was opened by the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1928. The forest spread along with the summer house, well laid out gardens, an island and hilltop guest house make it a favored getaway. Adding to the attraction is the deer park and facilities for trekking and water sports.

== History ==
[[File:Alisagar Guest House.jpg|thumb|Guest House at hilltop]]
In the year 1931, the Alisagar reservoir or lake was built by the order of the [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizam]] of [[Hyderabad]]. Later in the year 1985, the deer park was established with an aim to offer a safe haven to several species of deer. A natural habitat was created for the deer. Dense vegetation can be witnessed in this region.

== The project ==
[[File:Alisagar Dam.jpg|thumb|Irrigation dam]]
Alisagar lift irrigation project is a lift irrigation project located in [[Nizamabad district]] in [[Telangana]], [[India]]. The lift canal originates from the back waters of [[Sriram Sagar Project|Pochampadu Dam]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://india-wris.nrsc.gov.in/wrpinfo/index.php?title=Ali_Sagar_Lift_Irrigation_Project_JI00001|title= Ali Sagar Lift Irrigation Project JI00001|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alisagar Lift irrigation scheme is intended to stabilize the gap ayacut of 53,793 acres from distributor 50 to 73 of [[Nizamsagar]] Project.  The foreshore water of Sriram Sagar Project at Kosli (Village) will be lifted in three stages to feed the Alisagar balancing Reservoir at Mile 54 to Mile 56 on Main Canal of Nizamsagar Project.

In the first stage 720 cusecs of water from Godavari River is proposed to be lifted from Kosli (V) Navipet (Mandal) Nizamabad Dist. and proposed to be dropped into cistern at Bharath Tanda.  From there, the water is proposed to be dropped into Thadbiloli Tank by Gravity Canal.

In the second stage water is proposed to be lifted from the foreshore of Thadbiloli Tank and proposed to be dropped into a cistern at Kalyanpur Gutta.  It is proposed to carry water by gravity canal called Link Canal into Distributary No: 50 to irrigate 9,302 acres and another at higher level to irrigate 10,052 acres and balance water is proposed to be dropped into Pocharam Tank by gravity canal.

In the third stage water is proposed to be lifted from Pocharam Tank and dropped in a cistern near Alisagar Gutta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2004/01/27/stories/2004012707920300.htm Guthpa scheme by August]. The Hindu (2004-01-27). Retrieved on 2017-11-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parties that have "assigned amount units" to spare because of reductions in emissions below their Kyoto commitment set out in Article 3 and Annex B may sell those units to countries that have emissions exceeding their targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/mechanisms/emissions_trading/items/2731.php |title=Emissions Trading |publisher=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change |accessdate=2010-04-07 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100429214119/http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/mechanisms/emissions_trading/items/2731.php| archivedate= 29 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 17 also requires that any such emissions trading shall be supplemental to domestic action for the purpose of meeting quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments (QELRCs).

'''Atomic demolition munitions''' (ADMs), colloquially known as nuclear land mines, are small [[nuclear explosive device]]s. ADMs were developed for both military and civilian purposes. As weapons, they were designed to be exploded in the forward battle area, in order to block or channel enemy forces. Non-militarily, they were designed for demolition, mining or earthmoving. However, apart from testing, they have never been used for either purpose.

==Military uses==
[[File:UncleNuclearTest1951.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Operation Buster-Jangle|Shot Uncle of Operation Buster-Jangle]]'', had a yield of 1.2 kilotons,&lt;ref&gt;Some sources refer to the test as ''Jangle Uncle'' (e.g., Adushkin, 2001) or ''Project Windstorm'' (e.g., DOE/NV-526, 1998). Operation ''Buster'' and Operation ''Jangle'' were initially conceived as separate operations, and ''Jangle'' was at first known as ''Windstorm'', but the AEC merged the plans into a single operation on 19 June 1951. See Gladeck, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; and was detonated 5.2&amp;nbsp;m (17&amp;nbsp;ft) beneath ground level.&lt;ref name="adushkin2001"&gt;{{cite web|title=USGS Open File Report 01-312: Containment of Soviet underground nuclear explosions |first=Vitaly V. |last=Adushkin |author2=Leith, William |publisher=US Department of the Interior Geological Survey |date=September 2001 |url=http://geology.er.usgs.gov/eespteam/pdf/USGSOFR01312.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509080818/http://geology.er.usgs.gov/eespteam/pdf/USGSOFR01312.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The yield is approximately the same as the maximum yield of the [[W54]] equipped SADM.

Instead of being delivered to the target by missiles, rockets, or artillery shells, ADMs were intended to be emplaced by soldiers. Due to their relatively small size and light weight, ADMs could be emplaced by military engineers or [[Special Forces]] teams, then detonated on command or by timer to create massive obstructions. By destroying key terrain features or choke points such as bridges, dams, mountain passes and tunnels, ADMs could serve to create physical as well as [[radiological warfare|radiological obstacles]] to the movement of enemy forces and thus channel them into prepared [[killing zone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | type = field manual | id = 5-106 | title = Employment of Atomic Demolition Munitions | place = [[Washington, DC]], United States | publisher = Department of the Army |date=July 1984}} (unclassified).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acq.osd.mil/ncbdp/nm/nm_book_5_11/appendix_F.htm |title=The Nuclear Matters Handbook |quote="At the height of the Cold War, however, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces had contingency plans to use craters from nuclear detonations to channel, contain, or block enemy ground forces.

According to official accounts, the United States deployed ADMs overseas in Italy and [[West Germany]] ([[Fulda Gap]]) during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Kenneth W | last = Condit | title = The History of the Joint Chiefs of Staff—The Joint Chiefs of Staff and National Policy | volume = VI, 1955–56 | place = Washington, DC, US | publisher = GPO | year = 1992 | page = 146}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = 93rd Congress | title = US Security Issues in Europe | date = December 2, 1973 | page = 15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finney|first1=John IV|title=A NATO Nuclear Strategy|journal=The New York Times|date=2 December 1973|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/02/archives/a-nato-nuclear-strategy-use-of-outside-american-atomic-forces-is.html|accessdate=22 September 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most modern types (SADM and MADM) were deployed in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Peter |last=Hayes |url=http://www.nautilus.org/DPRKBriefingBook/nuclearweapons/PacificPowderkegbyPeterHayes.pdf |title=Pacific Powderkeg: American Nuclear Dilemmas in Korea |place=Lexington, [[Massachusetts]], US |publisher=DC Heath and Co |year=1991 |page=48 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201083701/http://nautilus.org/DPRKbriefingbook/nuclearweapons/PacificPowderkegbyPeterHayes.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Thomas ‘Tom’ | last = Gervasi | title = The Myth of Soviet Nuclear Supremacy | place = [[New York City]], US | publisher = Harper &amp; Row | year = 1986 | pages = 416–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = William M | last1 = Arkin | first2 = Richard W | last2 = Fieldhouse | title = Nuclear Battlefields: Global Links in the Arms Race | place = Cambridge | publisher = Ballinger | year = 1985 | page = 61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seymour Hersh]] referred to the deployment of ADMs along the [[Golan Heights]] by Israel in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Seymour | last  = Hersh | title = The Samson Option: Israel’s Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy | place = [[New York City]] | publisher = Random House | year = 1991 | page = 170}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civilian uses==
ADMs have never been used commercially although similar small devices, often modified to cut down on fission yield and maximize fusion, have been deeply buried to put out [[gas well]] fires as part of the Soviet test program.{{Clarify|reason=How does the burying of ADMs help to extinguish gas well fires?|date=April 2017}}

The [[Soviet Union]] tested the use of nuclear devices for mining and natural gas extraction (stimulating gas flow in a similar manner to [[fracking]]) on several occasions starting in the mid-1960s, as part of the [[Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy]] program. Tests for similar purposes were carried out in the United States under [[Operation Plowshare]], but due to [[radioactive contamination]] caused by the tests, no direct commercial use was made of the technology although they were successful at [[nucleosynthesis]] and probing the composition of the Earth's deep crust by [[Vibroseis]] which has helped mining company [[prospecting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.osti.gov/opennet/reports/plowshar.pdf  |title=Isotope recovery; neutron physics experiment; examination of heat recovery; seismic measurements; and explosive development.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://symposia.obs.carnegiescience.edu/series/symposium4/ms/becker.ps.gz&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ociw.edu/ociw/symposia/series/symposium4/proceedings.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-12-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210141005/http://www.ociw.edu/ociw/symposia/series/symposium4/proceedings.html |archive-date=2006-02-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States ADMs==
[[File:SADM(cropped).jpg|thumb|H-912 transport container for Mk-54 SADM]]
In the 1950s and 1960s, the United States developed several different types of lightweight nuclear devices. The main one was the [[W54]], a cylinder 40 by 60&amp;nbsp;cm (about 16 by 24 inches) that weighed 23&amp;nbsp;kg (50&amp;nbsp;lb). It was fired by a mechanical timer and had a [[variable yield]] equivalent to between 10&amp;nbsp;tons and 1 [[kiloton|kt]] of [[TNT]].  A Field non-variable yield version of the W54 nuclear device (called the "Mk-54 Davy Crockett" warhead for the M-388 Crockett round) was used in the [[Davy Crockett (nuclear device)|Davy Crockett Weapon System]].

===TADM===
The Mk 30 Mod 1 ''Tactical Atomic Demolition Munition'' (TADM) was a portable atomic bomb, consisting of a [[W30|Mk 30]] warhead installed in a X-113 case. The X-113 was 26&amp;nbsp;inches (66&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter and 70 [[inches|in]] (178&amp;nbsp;cm) long, and looked like corrugated culvert pipe. The whole system weighed 840 pounds (381&amp;nbsp;kg). Production of the TADM started in 1961 and all were removed from stockpile by 1966. A weapons effect test of the TADM was made in the 1962 Johnny Boy ("Johnnie Boy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/publications/historical/DOENV_209_REV15.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615231826/http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/publications/historical/DOENV_209_REV15.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) shot of the [[Operation Dominic I and II|Dominic II series]] (which is more accurately referred to as [[Operation Sunbeam]]), the yield of Johnny Boy/Johnnie Boy was about .5 kt.&lt;ref name=hansen-swords&gt;Hansen, Chuck, "[http://www.uscoldwar.com/ Swords of Armageddon]" (CD-ROM &amp; download available).

===SADM===
[[File:Medium Atomic Demolition Munition (with scientists).jpg|thumb|Scientists look at a MADM nuclear land mine. Cutaway casing with warhead inside, code-decoder / firing unit is at left.]]
The ''[[Special Atomic Demolition Munition]] (SADM)'' was a family of man-portable [[nuclear weapon]]s fielded by the US military in the 1960s, but never used in actual combat.  The US Army planned to use the weapons in Europe in the event of a Soviet invasion. US Army Engineers would use the weapon to irradiate, destroy, and deny key routes of communication through limited terrain such as the [[Fulda Gap]].  Troops were trained to [[parachute]] into Soviet occupied western Europe with the SADM and destroy power plants, bridges, and dams.

The weapon was designed to allow one person to parachute from any type of aircraft carrying the weapon package and place it in a harbor or other strategic location that could be accessed from the sea. Another parachutist without a weapon package would follow the first to provide support as needed.

The two-person team would place the weapon package in the target location, set the timer, and swim out into the ocean where they would be retrieved by a [[submarine]] or a high-speed surface water craft.

===MADM===
The ''[[Medium Atomic Demolition Munition]]'' (MADM) was a tactical nuclear weapon developed by the United States during the Cold War. They were designed to be used as nuclear land mines and for other tactical purposes, with a relatively low [[nuclear weapon yield|explosive yield]] from a [[W45]] warhead, between 1 and 15 [[kiloton]]s. Each MADM weighted around 400&amp;nbsp;lb (181&amp;nbsp;kg) total.  They were produced between 1965 and 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA495245#page=47 |page=47 |title=Combating WMD Journal |accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian controversy with ADMs===

In the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States and Russia developed a deep cooperation designed to assure the security of Russia’s nuclear arsenal. While a number of steps were taken to consolidate and improve the security of Russia’s strategic nuclear arms, particularly under the [[Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction|Cooperative Threat Reduction]] program, concern remained over the security of the Russian tactical nuclear weapons arsenal. In particular, a serious debate arose over the status of what are known as “suitcase nuclear weapons,” very small Soviet-era nuclear devices. This debate was all the more relevant when one considers the potential destruction that could occur should such a device fall into the hands of an organization like [[al-Qaeda]]. The term suitcase nuke is generally used to describe any type of small, man-portable nuclear device although there is serious debate as to the validity of the term itself. In a worst case analysis, a suitcase nuke would be small enough to be hand-carried into a major population or leadership center (downtown [[Manhattan]] or [[Capitol Hill]], for example) undetected and then detonated. Although, by most accounts, the yield of such a device is likely far less than ten kilotons, its combined effects may have the potential to kill tens of thousands, if not more. There is a great deal of confusion over just how many of these suitcase devices exist or if they even exist at all. By some accounts, the Soviet Union built hundreds of these devices, of which several dozen were missing. Based on other reports, suitcase nukes were never built in large numbers or were never deployed.

There is no definitive [[Open-source intelligence|open source information]] on the number, location, security, or status of these suitcase nuclear bombs. No Soviet suitcase bomb or any of its presumed components has ever been found, much less used, in the three decades after the collapse of the USSR. {{As of|2018}}, it is likely they would not work or would [[Fizzle (nuclear explosion)|fizzle]] at worst by lack of the required specialized maintenance common to all nuclear weapons, if they ever existed.

===''Frontline'' broadcast about suitcase nukes===

On February 23, 1999, the [[PBS]] investigative program ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' aired a special on Russian nuclear security which included a series of interviews with several of the individuals who spoke publicly during the 1997 debate on suitcase nukes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Russian Roulette|series=Frontline|date=February 23, 1999|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/russia/|network=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexei Yablokov]] appeared and reasserted his position that some number of small atomic charges had been built, even going so far as to speak of their weight (“thirty kilos, forty kilos”). Yablokov accused the Russian government of misleading the public on the situation, pointing to the inconsistencies in denials by the [[Federal Security Service|FSB]], [[Federal Agency on Atomic Energy (Russia)|MINATOM]], and the information that was publicly available on the Internet (“…if I’m looking at a [picture] of an American weapon, I must be sure that we have an analogy…″). On the same program, Congressman [[Curt Weldon]] recounted a meeting he held in December 1997 with Defense Minister [[Igor Sergeyev]]. During this meeting, Weldon asked Sergeyev specifically about the small ADM devices. According to Weldon, Sergeyev’s response was: “Yes, we did build them, we are in the process of destroying them, and by the year 2000 we will have destroyed all of our small atomic demolition devices.” Weldon went on to express confidence in Sergeyev’s statement but also raised concern as to whether or not the Russian government had accounted for all of its nuclear devices. ''Frontline'' also featured several American and Russian experts and officials who presented differing views on the subject. General Vladimir Dvorkin, a former officer in the [[Strategic Rocket Forces]] and subsequently Director of the Fourth Central Research Institute in Moscow, admitted that “some small devices existed in the United States and Russia” but that something that small would have a very limited shelf life and would have little deterrent value. Dvorkin discounted the validity of {{Non sequitur|reason="Lebed" is not previously mentioned|text=Lebed’s|date=April 2017}} statements, saying “…Lebed is probably the least informed person as far as this topic is concerned…an expert in military folklore.” The former commander of U.S. nuclear forces, retired General [[Eugene E. Habiger|Eugene Habiger]], also appeared on ''Frontline'' and expressed doubt about the size of such devices, calling the term suitcase “a little optimistic.” Additionally, Habiger spoke of the systems set up by the Russians to track their nuclear weapons, saying “If the Russians were as deadly serious about the accountability of the nuclear weapons that I saw and have been involved with, I can only surmise that they have the same concerns with the smaller weapons.”

===Suitcase nukes and bin Laden===

By late 1999, the concern had expanded from nuclear armed Chechen rebels to include concerns about [[Osama bin Laden]]’s al-Qaeda network. Although unsubstantiated, some reports suggested that bin Laden had already managed to acquire weapons from the Russian nuclear arsenal. In August 1999, [[Voice of America]] broadcast a story about the threat posed by bin Laden. In it, [[Yossef Bodansky]], an American terrorism analyst, author, and head of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Non-Conventional Warfare claimed that he had learned, through sources in Russia and the Middle East, that bin Laden had “a few of the ex-Soviet ‘suitcase’ bombs acquired through the Chechens.″&lt;ref&gt;Nick Simeone, “Bin Laden Bombing Anniversary,” Voice of America, August 6, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, on October 5, the Moscow daily [[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] published an interview in which Bodansky, citing “various intelligence sources,” claimed that bin Laden had acquired, through [[Kazakhstan]], “from several to twenty tactical nuclear warheads.” Bodansky also claimed that bin Laden had attempted to buy “nuclear suitcases” in Kazakhstan. In the same article, the director of the Atomic Energy Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan declared that all nuclear weapons had been removed “long ago” from Kazakhstan and that suitcase nuclear devices were never built in Kazakh territory. The head of counterintelligence for the Kazakhstani Committee on National Security told Komsomolskaya Pravda that all nuclear weapons were removed from Kazakhstan in 1995 in accordance with the [[START I]] treaty and denied reports that bin Laden had attempted to purchase nuclear weapons there.&lt;ref&gt;“Youssef Bodansky: Terrorist No. 1 Has an Atomic Bomb,” Komsomolskaya Pravda, October 5, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Bodansky’s claims surfaced again on October 25, 1999 when [[The Jerusalem Report]] published an article on bin Laden and suitcase nuclear devices. In this report, Bodansky’s claim of “a few to twenty” weapons was repeated. In addition, Bodansky claimed that bin Laden had purchased the weapons using “$30 million in cash and two tons of Afghan heroin.”&lt;ref&gt;“Bin Laden Has Several Nuclear Suitcases,” The Jerusalem Report, October 25, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Very little information is available to back Bodansky’s claims and they remain in doubt.

===Suitcase nukes concerns post-9/11===

Following the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]] on the United States, fresh attention was focused on al-Qaeda’s desire for weapons of mass destruction but with more urgency than in the past. A serious concern was that al-Qaeda terrorists might attempt to obtain Russian warheads or weapon-usable nuclear materials. Former [[Main Intelligence Directorate|GRU]] Colonel [[Stanislav Lunev]]’s 1998 statements were resurrected following the attacks. During an appearance on [[CBS]], Lunev reasserted his claim that suitcase bombs existed, even going so far as to claim that bin Laden had obtained several of the devices from the former Soviet Union. In the same segment, [[Michael E. O'Hanlon|Michael O’Hanlon]] of the [[Brookings Institution]] discounted Lunev’s claims: “Our view is that this is not a major worry. If those devices ever existed, they were under the control of the Soviet state, and not available to terrorists.”&lt;ref&gt;“Nuclear Terror?” CBSNews.com, November 5, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, 2001 [[United Press International|UPI]] reported that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] had stepped up its investigation into terrorist access to Russian nuclear stockpiles. [[Curt Weldon|Representative Weldon]], once again at the forefront of the debate, stated “Do I think he [bin Laden] has a {{sic}} small atomic demolition munitions, which were built by the Soviets in the Cold War? Probably doubtful.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nicholas Horrock |title=FBI Focusing On Portable Nuke Threat |publisher=UPI |date=December &lt;!-- (20 or) Pub date (20 or 21) is doubtful; Web says 21. --&gt;21, 2001 |accessdate=April 28, 2017 |url=http://www.upi.com/FBI-focusing-on-portable-nuke-threat/90071008968550/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428213710/http://www.upi.com/FBI-focusing-on-portable-nuke-threat/90071008968550/ |archivedate=April 28, 2017 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17, 2002, Russia’s Atomic Energy Minister, Aleksandr Rumyantsev, told [[Interfax]] it would be impossible for terrorists to construct a portable nuclear weapon, citing a lack of “necessary potential and materials.” The Interfax report went on to state “major nuclear powers have an effective system of control over miniature nuclear charges, which weigh a total of several dozen kilograms.” According to Rumyantsev “all of these [miniature nuclear devices] are registered… it is technically impossible for such charges to find their way into the hands of terrorists.”&lt;ref&gt;“Russian Minister Says Miniature Nuclear Charges Out Of Reach Of Terrorists,” Agentstvo Voyennykh Novostey, January 17, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2138">'''Berge Gerdt Larsen''' (born 16 November 1952) is a [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] businessperson.

Larsen graduated from [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle]] with a [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[chemical engineering]] and from [[University of Texas at Austin]] with a [[Master of Business Administration]].&lt;ref name=dno&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dno.no/About-DNO/Directors/Berge-G-Larsen/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329020711/http://www.dno.no/About-DNO/Directors/Berge-G-Larsen/ |archivedate=2008-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1989 to 1995 he was managing director of [[Odfjell Drilling]]. He was [[chief executive officer]] of [[DNO International|DNO ASA]] from 1996 to 2002, and has served as the executive chairman of their board of directors since 2002. He has also served as chairman of the [[Norwegian Rig Owners' Association]] and [[Bergen Shipowners' Association]].&lt;ref name=dno/&gt;

Larsen has a taxable net worth of about [[United States dollar|US$]]158 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skattelister.aftenposten.no/skattelister/soek.htm?firstMiddleName=berge&amp;lastName=larsen&amp;countyId=&amp;srchMode=smpl&amp;taxYear=2007&amp;x=0&amp;y=0%7ctitle=Forsiden%7cwork=aftenposten.no|title=Forsiden|work=aftenposten.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax affairs==
Larsen was investigated by Norwegian authorities over an alleged multi-million [[Norwegian krone|kroner]] [[tax evasion]], but he was acquitted by theGulating Court of Appeals on 31. August 2016. The Judgment is final. He is expected to file very substantial claims for compensation after being wrongly investigated for more than 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://headlinesnewsonline.blogspot.no/2016/08/berge-g-larsen-acquitted-bergensavisen.html/ |title=Berge G.

A '''black dwarf''' is a theoretical [[stellar remnant]], specifically a [[white dwarf]] that has cooled sufficiently that it no longer emits significant [[heat]] or [[light]]. Because the time required for a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current [[age of the universe]] (13.8 billion years), no black dwarfs are expected to exist in the universe now, and the temperature of the coolest white dwarfs is one observational limit on the age of the universe.&lt;ref name="2003ApJ...591..288H"/&gt;

The name "black dwarf" has also been applied to [[substellar object]]s that do not have sufficient mass, less  than approximately 0.08 {{Solar mass|link=y}}, to maintain [[hydrogen]]-burning nuclear fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A failed search for black dwarfs as companions to nearby stars|author1=R.

==Formation==
A white dwarf is what remains of a [[main sequence|main-sequence]] star of low or medium mass (below approximately 9 to 10 [[solar mass]]es ({{Solar mass|link=y}})) after it has either expelled or [[nuclear fusion|fused]] all the [[chemical element|element]]s for which it has sufficient temperature to fuse.&lt;ref name="2003ApJ...591..288H"&gt;&amp;sect;3, {{cite journal

They would, however, be detectable through their [[gravity|gravitational]] influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Baryonic Dark Matter: The Results from Microlensing Surveys|author1=Charles Alcock |author2=Robyn A.

Welch |year=1999|bibcode=1999ASPC..165..362A|volume=165|pages=362|journal=In the Third Stromlo Symposium: The Galactic Halo}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Various white dwarfs cooled below 3900 K (M0 [[Stellar classification|spectral class]]) were found in 2012 by astronomers using [[MDM Observatory]]'s 2.4-meter telescope. They are estimated to be 11 to 12 billion years old.&lt;ref name=2examples&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/12_Billion_Year_Old_White_Dwarf_Stars_Only_100_Light_Years_Away_999.html | title=12-Billion-Year-Old White-Dwarf Stars Only 100 Light-Years Away}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the far-future evolution of stars depends on physical questions which are poorly understood, such as the nature of [[dark matter]] and the possibility and rate of [[proton decay]], it is not known precisely how long it will take white dwarfs to cool to blackness.&lt;ref name="adams"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9701131v1 |title=A Dying Universe: The Long Term Fate and Evolution of Astrophysical Objects|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=69|issue=2|pages=337–372| doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.69.337|author1=Fred C. Adams  |author2=Gregory Laughlin |lastauthoramp=yes |arxiv = astro-ph/9701131 |bibcode = 1997RvMP...69..337A |date=April 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, § IIIE, IVA.&lt;/sup&gt;  Barrow and Tipler estimate that it would take 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; years for a white dwarf to cool to 5 K;&lt;ref&gt;Table 10.2, {{BarrowTipler1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, if [[weakly interacting massive particles]](WIMPs) exist, it is possible that interactions with these particles will keep some white dwarfs much warmer than this for approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; years.&lt;ref name="adams" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, § IIIE.&lt;/sup&gt;  If protons are not stable, white dwarfs will also be kept warm by energy released from proton decay. For a hypothetical proton lifetime of 10&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt; years, Adams and Laughlin calculate that proton decay will raise the [[effective temperature|effective surface temperature]] of an old one-[[solar mass|solar-mass]] white dwarf to approximately 0.06 K.  Although cold, this is thought to be hotter than the [[cosmic background radiation]] temperature 10&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt; years in the future.&lt;ref name="adams" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, §IVB.&lt;/sup&gt;

==Future of the Sun==
Once the [[Sun]] stops fusing helium in its core and ejects its layers in a [[planetary nebula]] in about 8 billion years, it will become a [[white dwarf]] and, over trillions of years time, eventually will no longer emit any light. After that, the Sun will not be visible to the equivalent of the [[naked eye|naked human eye]], removing it from optical view even if the gravitational effects are evident. The estimated time for the Sun to cool enough to become a black dwarf is about 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; (1 quadrillion) years, though it could take much longer than this, if [[weakly interacting massive particles]] (WIMPs) exist, as described above.

The '''Catalina Solar Project''' is a 143.2 [[Watt#Megawatt|megawatt]] (MW) [[photovoltaic power station]]&lt;ref name="CSP" /&gt; located near [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], [[Kern County, California|Kern County]], [[California]], owned by enXco, an [[EDF Énergies Nouvelles]] Company. It covers area of {{convert|445|ha}}.

Construction began in May, 2012 and was fully completed in August, 2013.&lt;ref name="Project Detail" /&gt; It use thin-film PV panels bought from [[Solar Frontier]] ([[Copper indium gallium selenide|CIGS]] type) and [[First Solar]] ([[Cadmium telluride photovoltaics|CdTe]] type).&lt;ref name="CSP" /&gt;

Phase&amp;nbsp;1 had a [[nameplate capacity]] of 60&amp;nbsp;MW and was connected to the grid in December, 2012.

enXco has signed a 25-year [[Power Purchase Agreement]] (PPA) with [[San Diego Gas &amp; Electric]] (SDG&amp;E) for the production from the station.&lt;ref name="Project Detail"&gt;[http://www.edf-re.com/projects/detail/catalina_solar_project/ "Project Detail - Catalina Solar Project"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130102120708/http://www.edf-re.com/projects/detail/catalina_solar_project/ |date=2013-01-02 }}.

[[Image:rice chaffs.jpg|thumb|[[Rice]] chaff]]

'''Chaff''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|æ|f}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɑː|f}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cambridge Pronouncing Dictionary|author=Daniel Jones|editor1=Peter Roach |editor2=James Hartman |editor3=Jane Setter |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the dry, scaly protective casings of the seeds of [[cereal grain]], or similar fine, dry, scaly plant material such as scaly parts of [[flower]]s, or finely chopped [[straw]]. Chaff is indigestible by humans, but [[livestock]] can eat it and in [[agriculture]] it is used as livestock [[fodder]], or is a waste material [[plough]]ed into the [[soil]] or burnt.

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary|chaff|glume}}
"Chaff" comes from [[Middle English]] ''chaf'', from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''ceaf'', related to [[Old High German]] ''cheva'', "husk".

==Grain chaff==
[[Image:Usdaeinkorn1 Triticum monococcum.jpg|thumbnail|Spikelets of a hulled wheat, [[Einkorn wheat|einkorn]]]]In [[Poaceae|grass]]es (including [[cereal]]s such as [[rice]], [[barley]], [[oat]]s, and [[wheat]]), the ripe seed is surrounded by thin, dry, scaly [[bracts]] (called [[glume]]s, [[Lemma (botany)|lemma]]s and [[palea (botany)|palea]]s), forming a dry [[husk]] (or hull) around the grain. Once it is removed it is often referred to as chaff.
 
In wild  cereals and in the primitive domesticated [[einkorn]],&lt;ref name=Potts&gt;Potts, D. T. (1996) ''Mesopotamia Civilization: The Material Foundations'' [[Cornell University Press]]. p. 62. {{ISBN|0-8014-3339-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[emmer]]&lt;ref&gt;Nevo, Eviatar &amp; A. B. Korol &amp; A. Beiles &amp; T. Fahima. (2002) ''Evolution of Wild Emmer and Wheat Improvement: Population Genetics, Genetic Resources, and Genome...''. Springer. p. 8. {{ISBN|3-540-41750-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[spelt]]&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, J. G. &amp; P. A. Judd. (2003) ''The Oxford Book of Health Foods''. [[Oxford University Press]]. p. 35. {{ISBN|0-19-850459-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; wheats, the husks enclose each seed tightly.  Before the grain can be used, the husks must be removed.

The process of loosening the chaff from the grain so as to remove it is called ''[[threshing]]'' &amp;ndash; traditionally done by milling or pounding. Separating remaining loose chaff from the grain is called ''[[winnowing]]'' &amp;ndash; traditionally done by repeatedly tossing the grain up into a light wind which gradually blows the lighter chaff away. This method typically utilizes a broad, plate-shaped basket or similar receptacle to hold and collect the winnowed grain as it falls back down.

Domesticated grains such as [[durum wheat]] and [[common wheat]] have been bred to have chaff that is easily removed. These varieties are known as ''free-threshing'' or ''naked''.

Chaff should not be confused with [[bran]], which is finer scaly material that is part of the grain itself.

==Straw chaff==
Chaff is also made by chopping [[straw]] (or sometimes coarse [[hay]]) into very short lengths, using a machine called a [[chaff cutter]].  Like grain chaff this is used as animal feed, and is a way of turning coarse fodder into a form more palatable to livestock.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk/collection/search/display.aspx?irn=56 "The Chaff cutter"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiquefarmtools.info/ Cutting chaff by hand]: detail of painting by [[David Teniers the Younger]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorians.asp-host.co.uk/themes/agriculture/chaffcutterobj.htm A Victorian chaff cutter] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321063813/http://www.victorians.asp-host.co.uk/themes/agriculture/chaffcutterobj.htm |date=March 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Botany==
In [[botany]], chaff refers to the thin [[List of plant morphology terms#Basic flower parts|receptacular]] [[bracts]] of many species in the sunflower family [[Asteraceae]] and related families. They are modified scale-like [[leaves]] surrounding single [[floret]]s in the flower-head.&lt;ref name="Jones2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald Jones|title=Plant Life of Kentucky: An Illustrated Guide to the Vascular Flora|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bsngx7s0OI4C&amp;pg=PA751|date=25 March 2005|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0-8131-7194-6|pages=751–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphor==
Chaff as a waste product from grain processing leads to a [[metaphor]]ical use of the term, to refer to something seen as worthless.  This is commonly used in the expression "to separate the wheat from the chaff" from [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 3:12 which says: Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.&lt;ref name="Manser2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin H. Manser|title=I Never Knew That Was in the Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3hPJjxbDpxgC&amp;pg=PT1224|date=13 February 2000|publisher=Thomas Nelson Inc|isbn=978-1-4185-6690-6|pages=1224–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compare also the "[[Parable of the Tares]]", which refers to a mixture of wheat and [[Lolium temulentum|tares]] (a kind of weed). Another example is in Psalm 1:4 of the [[Bible]], which says: The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. (KJV)

==Use==
Hungarian engineer László Schremmer has recently discovered that by the use of chaff-based filters it is possible to reduce the [[arsenic]] content of  water to 3 microgram/litre. This is especially important in areas where the potable water is provided by filtering the water extracted from the underground [[aquifer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mno.hu/gazdasag/szenzacios-magyar-talalmany-1068315 Newspaper article] (in Hungarian) published by [[Magyar Nemzet]] on April 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1134">'''Deformed power''' is a concept in [[electrical engineering]] which characterize the distortion to the sinusoidal states in electric network. It has been introduced by [[Constantin Budeanu]].

It is defined by the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;S = \sqrt {P^2 + Q^2 + D^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where S, P, Q, D are the [[Apparent power|apparent]], [[Active power|active]], [[Reactive power|reactive]] and deformed powers.

In linear electrical components like [[electrical resistance]] occurs no deformed (distortion) power. It is caused by nonlinear loads represented for instance by semiconducting devices (rectifiers, thyristors) especially when used for rectification of an alternating current to a direct one. The [[rectifier|rectification]] is needed especially for providing current for [[electric traction]] and electrochemical industry.

'''Frame and panel''' construction, also called '''rail and stile''', is a [[woodworking]] technique often used in the making of [[door]]s, [[panelling|wainscoting]], and other decorative features for [[Cabinet making|cabinet]]s, [[furniture]], and homes. The basic idea is to capture a 'floating' panel within a sturdy frame, as opposed to techniques used in making a slab solid wood cabinet door or drawer front, the door is constructed of several solid wood pieces running in a vertical or horizontal direction &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cabinets-q-and-a.com/cabinet-door-style.html|title=Kitchen Cabinets: Door Styles of Cabinets|author=|date=|website=cabinets-q-and-a.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with exposed endgrains. Usually, the panel is not glued to the frame but is left to 'float' within it so that seasonal movement of the wood comprising the panel does not distort the frame.

Frame and panel construction at its most basic consists of five members: the panel and the four members which make up the frame. The vertical members of the frame are called '''stiles''' while the horizontal members are known as '''rails'''. A basic frame and panel item consists of a top rail, a bottom rail, two stiles, and a panel.  This is a common method of constructing cabinet doors and these are often referred to as a '''five piece door'''.

In larger panels it is common to divide the panel into one or more sections. To house the extra panels, dividing pieces known as '''mid rails''' and '''mid stiles''' or '''[[muntin]]s''' are added to the frame.

==Panels==
[[Image:Woodworking-frameandpanel.svg|right|300px|Panel styles in frame and panel construction]]

The panel is either captured in a [[groove (joinery)|groove]] made in the inside edge of the frame members or housed in an edge [[rabbet]] made in the rear inside edge. Panels are made slightly smaller than the available space within the frame to provide room for movement.  Wood will expand and contract across the grain, and a wide panel made of solid wood could change width by a half of an inch, warping the door frame.  By allowing the wood panel to float, it can expand and contract without damaging the door.  A typical panel would be cut to allow 1/4" (5 mm) between itself and the bottom of the groove in the frame. It is common to place some sort of elastic material in the groove between the edge of the panel and the frame before assembly. These items center the panel in the frame and absorb seasonal movement. A popular item for this purpose is a small rubber ball, known as a ''spaceball'' (a trademarked product). Some cabinet makers will also use small pieces of [[Cork (material)|cork]] to allow for movement.  The panels are usually either '''flat''' or '''raised'''. 

A flat panel has its visible face flush with the front of the groove in the frame. This gives the panel an inset appearance. This style of panel is commonly made from man-made materials such as [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]] or [[plywood]] but may also be made from solid wood or [[tongue and groove]] planks.  Panels made from MDF will be painted to hide their appearance, but panels of hardwood-veneer plywood will be stained and finished to match the solid wood rails and stiles.

A raised panel has a profile cut into its edge so that the panel surface is flush with or proud of the frame. Some popular profiles are the ''ogee'', ''chamfer'', and ''scoop'' or ''cove''. Panels may be raised by a number of methods - the two most common in modern cabinetry are by coving on the [[tablesaw]] or the use of a panel raising cutter in a [[wood router]] or [[spindle moulder]].

== Frame ==
Frames can be constructed by several methods: [[cope and stick]], [[mortise and tenon]], [[bridle joint]], or a simple [[butt joint]].  Cope and stick is the most common method, as it is more efficient to manufacture.  Mortise and tenon is the strongest, and is often used for large doors which will have greater stresses imposed.  Bridle joints are typically used in less formal work, as the exposed endgrain is considered unattractive; while butt joints, being weak, are only used on very small assemblies.

The stiles and rails often have a profile cut into the inside edge of the outside face - usually a smaller version to match the profile of the panel. In some panel styles, a profile may also be cut on the outside edge of the outside face.

In modern cabinetry, the cope and stick joinery is achieved with a set of special router cutters. These cut the profile on the edge of the frame parts and also cut a reverse version of the same profile in the ends of the rail so that they may be slipped over the ends of the stiles and glued in place.  If done correctly, the cope cut in the end of the rail will mate perfectly with the sticking profile. When glued together, the resulting joint will have sufficient strength for most cabinet door applications without further reinforcement. For extremely large and heavy doors, the cope and stick joint can be further reinforced with dowels, loose [[Mortise and tenon|tenons]], or by some other method. 

For the other methods of frame construction, the inside profile is created either by mitred sticking or by an applied moulding.

In mitred sticking, the profile (known as the sticking) is applied to the edges of both the rail and stile and then a section of the sticking at the ends of each stile is removed leaving a mitred edge which aligns to a similar mitre cut on the ends of the sticking on each rail. This traditional method is more time consuming to complete, hence the popularity of cope and stick for manufactured items.

When applied moulding is to be used, the moulding is applied to the inside edge of the outer face of the frame after the frame and panel have been assembled.

== Assembly process ==
The process of making raised panel doors begins with gluing up panels, and then moves into cutting and preparing the frame parts. Next, the panels are cut to size and shaped.  Parts and panel are sanded before construction. It is also common to apply a finish to panels prior to assembly so that raw wood is not visible if the panel shrinks. The joints are glued and set into clamps. If the frame and panel items are paint grade they are sometimes nailed at the frame joints on the reverse side.  The door then moves on to finish sanding where it is brought to its final thickness, and the outside profile is added if required.

'''Generic Substation Events''' ('''GSE''') is a control model defined as per [[IEC 61850]] which provides a fast and reliable mechanism of transferring event data over entire [[electrical substation]] networks. When implemented, this model ensures the same event message is received by multiple physical devices using [[multicast]] or [[Broadcasting (networking)|broadcast]] services. The GSE control model is further subdivided into '''GOOSE''' ('''Generic Object Oriented Substation Events''') and '''GSSE''' ('''Generic Substation State Events''').

==Generic Object Oriented Substation Events==

'''Generic Object Oriented Substation Events''' ('''GOOSE''') is a controlled model mechanism in which any format of data (status, value) is grouped into a data set and transmitted within a time period of 4 milliseconds.  The following mechanisms are used to ensure specified transmission speed and reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://univagora.ro/jour/index.php/ijccc/article/view/329 |title=A Detailed Analysis of the Generic Object-Oriented Substation Event Message Structure in an IEC 61850 Standard-Based Substation Automation System &amp;#124; Kriger &amp;#124; International Journal of Computers Communications &amp; Control |publisher=Univagora.ro |date= |accessdate=2014-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*GOOSE data is directly embedded into [[Ethernet]] data packets and works on [[Publish–subscribe pattern|publisher-subscriber]] mechanism on multicast or broadcast MAC addresses.
*GOOSE uses [[VLAN]] and priority tagging as per [[IEEE 802.1Q]] to have separate virtual network within the same physical network and sets appropriate message priority level.
*Enhanced [[Retransmission (data networks)|retransmission]] mechanisms - The same GOOSE message is retransmitted with varying and increasing re-transmission intervals. A new event occurring within any GOOSE dataset element will result in the existing GOOSE retransmission message being stopped.  A state number within the GOOSE protocol identifies whether a GOOSE message is a new message or a retransmitted message.
*GOOSE messages are designed to be brand independent. Some vendors offer [[intelligent electronic device]]s (IED) that fully support IEC 61850 for a truly interoperable approach within the substation network without requiring vendor specific cables or algorithms.

==Generic Substation State Events==

'''Generic Substation State Events''' ('''GSSE''') is an extension of event transfer mechanism in UCA2.0. Only Status data can be exchanged through GSSE and it uses a status list (string of bits) rather than a dataset as is used in GOOSE. GSSE messages are transmitted directly over IEC/ISO 8802-2 and 8802-3 using a similar mechanism to GOOSE messages (refer IEC 61850-7-1 Clause 12.2, IEC 61850-8-1 Clause 6.4). As the GSSE format is simpler than GOOSE it is handled faster in some devices. GSSE is being progressively superseded by the use of GOOSE and support for it may eventually disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sclmanager.blogspot.com/2012/09/generic-substation-state-events-gsse.html |title=SCL Manager: Generic Substation State Events (GSSE) |publisher=Sclmanager.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-standard event reporting models==

Equipment manufacturers have started to offer non-standard protocols to report events over substation networks, citing advantages to these approaches. {{clarify|date=January 2014}}

*'''Fixed GOOSE''' - This is implemented in GE IEDs and makes use of the GSSE data format (list of bits) over the GOOSE protocol. This is said to be faster than GOOSE as it uses (shorter) unstructured data in the transmission string instead of structured data format required used by GOOSE.

'''Glued laminated timber''', also called '''glulam''', is a type of structural [[engineered wood]] product comprising a number of layers of [[dimensioned lumber]] bonded together with durable, moisture-resistant structural adhesives. In North America the material providing the laminations is termed ''laminating stock'' or ''lamstock''.

By laminating a number of smaller pieces of [[lumber]], a single large, strong, structural member is manufactured from smaller pieces. These structural members are used as vertical [[column]]s or horizontal [[beam (structure)|beams]], as well as curved, arched shapes. Glulam is readily produced in curved shapes and it is available in a range of species and appearance characteristics to meet varied end-use requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.apawood.org/SearchResults.aspx?q=C800&amp;tid=1 |title=A Guide To Engineered Wood Products, Form C800 |date=2010 |page=7 |format=PDF |publisher=[[APA – The Engineered Wood Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connections are usually made with bolts or plain steel dowels and [[Tie (engineering)|steel plates]].

Glulam optimizes the structural values of a renewable resource – wood. Because of their composition, large glulam members can be manufactured from a variety of smaller trees harvested from second- and third-growth forests and plantations. 
Glulam provides the strength and versatility of large wood members without relying on the old growth-dependent solid-sawn timbers. 
&lt;ref name="X440"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.apawood.org/SearchResults.aspx?q=X440&amp;tid=1 |title=Product Guide, Form No. EWS X440 |date=2008 |format=PDF |publisher=[[APA – The Engineered Wood Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} As with other engineered wood products, it reduces the overall amount of wood used when compared to solid sawn timbers by diminishing the negative impact of knots and other small defects in each component board. 
 
Glulam has much lower [[embodied energy]] than reinforced concrete and steel, although it entails more embodied energy than solid timber. However, the laminating process allows timber to be used for much longer spans, heavier loads, and complex shapes. Glulam is one tenth the weight of steel and one sixth the weight of concrete – the embodied energy to produce it is six times less than the same suitable strength of steel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timberengineeringeurope.com/glu_bea.html Timber Engineering Europe Ltd.

Retrieved on 2015-09-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Glulam can be manufactured to a variety of straight and curved configurations so it offers architects artistic freedom without sacrificing structural requirements.

The high strength and stiffness of laminated timbers enable glulam beams and arches to span large distances without intermediate columns, allowing more design flexibility than with traditional timber construction. The size is limited only by transportation and handling constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aitc-glulam.org/glulam.asp |title=About Glulam |website=American Institute of Timber Construction |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

One of the earliest still-standing glulam roof structures is generally acknowledged&lt;ref name="Müller"&gt;{{cite book |last=Müller |first=Christian |title=Laminated Timber Construction |publisher=[[Birkhäuser]] |isbn=978-3764362676  |date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be the assembly room of [[King Edward VI School, Southampton|King Edward VI College]], a school in Bugle Street, [[Southampton]], England, dating from 1866, designed by Josiah George Poole. The building is now the Marriage Room of Southampton 
Register Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Leonard |first=A.G.K. |title=Josiah George Poole (1818–1897): Architect and Surveyor serving Southampton |url=http://www.southampton.gov.uk/Images/Local%20History%20Journal%20March%202008_tcm46-200277.pdf|work=Journal of the Southampton Local History Forum|publisher=Southampton City Council|accessdate=2 June 2012|pages=19–21|date=Spring 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two churches in [[Northumberland]] are now thought to have the earliest extant uses: Holy Trinity, [[Cambo]] (1842), and Holy Trinity, [[Horsley, Northumberland|Horsley]] (1844), and four 1850s Merseyside churches also feature laminated timbers: St Mary, [[Grassendale]], St Luke, [[Formby]], St Paul, [[Tranmere, Merseyside|Tranmere]] and Holy Trinity, Parr Mount, [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}.

The first industrial patented use was in [[Weimar, Germany]]. Here in 1872&lt;ref name="Müller"/&gt; Otto Hetzer set up a steam sawmill and carpentry business in Kohlstrasse. Beginning in 1892, he took out a series of patents. DRP No. 63018 was for a ventilated timber floor deck that could be tightened laterally after installation, to compensate for shrinkage. Hetzer continued to patent various ingenious systems, but the first of these that could be compared with subsequently standardised horizontal glulam was DRP No. 197773, dated 1906. 

This entailed vertical columns which transitioned into curved glued laminated eaves zones, and then became sloped rafters, all in a single laminated unit. Each component, bonded under pressure, comprised three or more horizontally arranged laminations.  The result was the first glulam portal.

In 1895, Hetzer moved his company to Ettersburger Strasse, still in Weimar. At the height of production, in around 1917, he employed about 300 workers, and Müller includes a fine engraving of the railway sidings and works in 1921.

In 1909, the Swiss engineering consultants Terner &amp; Chopard&lt;ref name="Müller"/&gt; purchased permission to use Hetzer's patent, and employed glulam in a number of projects. These included the distinctive bell-shaped roof dome of the former Hygiene Institute, Zurich, 1911, now the main building of the [[University of Zurich]].

The technology arrived in North America in 1934 when Max Hanisch, Sr., who had worked with Hetzer at the turn of the century, formed the firm Unit Structures in [[Peshtigo, Wisconsin]] to manufacture structural glued laminated timber. The first building in the United States to use structural glued laminated timber was a school gymnasium in Peshtigo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://foresthistory.org/october-15-1934-glued-laminated-timber-comes-to-america/ October 15, 1934: Glued Laminated Timber Comes to America]. [[Forest History Society]]. Retrieved on 2018-10-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant development in the glulam industry was the introduction of fully water-resistant phenol-resorcinol adhesive in 1942. 
This allowed glulam to be used in exposed exterior environments without concern of gluline degradation. The first U.S. manufacturing standard for glulam was Commercial Standard CS253-63, which was published by the Department of Commerce in 1963. The most recent standard is ANSI/AITC Standard A190.1–02, which took effect in 2002.&lt;ref name="X440"/&gt;{{rp|4}}
 
The roof of the [[Centre Pompidou-Metz]] museum is composed of sixteen kilometers of glued laminated timber. It represents a 90-metre wide hexagon with a surface area of 8,000 m². The glued laminated timber motif forms hexagonal wooden units resembling the cane-work pattern of a Chinese hat.

== Glulam versus steel ==
A 2002 case study comparing energy use, greenhouse gas emissions and costs for roof [[Beam (structure)|beam]]s found it takes two to three times more energy and six to twelve times more fossil fuels to manufacture steel beams than it does to manufacture glulam beams. 
It compared two options for a roof structure of a new airport in Oslo, Norway – steel beams and glulam spruce wood beams. The life cycle greenhouse gas emission is lower for the glulam beams. If they are burned at the end of their service life, more energy can be recovered than was used to manufacture them. If they are landfilled, the glulam beams are a worse alternative than steel because of the [[methane]] emission.&lt;ref&gt; Petersen K, Solberg B. (2002) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389934103000637 Greenhouse gas emissions, life-cycle inventory and cost- efficiency of using laminated wood instead of steel constructions. Case: beams at Gardemoen airport.] ''Environmental Science &amp; Policy'' '''5'''(2): pp 169-182 &lt;/ref&gt; A more recent study by Chalmers University of Technology was not so optimistic. Nevertheless, it showed that while the absolute greenhouse emissions are strongly dependent on the method used to calculate them, the environmental profile of glulam is typically as good or better than steel in an example structural application.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11367-013-0686-x Sandin Peters Svanström (2014) Life cycle assessment of construction materials: the influence of assumptions in end-of-life modelling. International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment 19:723-731]&lt;/ref&gt;
The cost of the glulam beams is slightly lower than the steel beams.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.canfor.com/docs/why-wood/tr19-complete-pub-web.pdf FPInnovations A Synthesis of Research on Wood Products and Greenhouse Gas Impacts page 61]. Forintek.ca. Retrieved on 2015-09-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technological developments and glulam ==
=== Resin glues ===
When glued laminated timber was introduced to the building technology in the early twentieth century, casein glues, which are waterproof but have low shear strengths, were widely used. Joints with casein glues struggled with detachment due to inherent stresses in the wood. The invention of cold-curing synthetic resin glues in 1928 ("Kaurit") solved these problems - resin glues, which are inexpensive and easy-to-use, are completely waterproof and enable high adhesive strength. The development of resin glues contributed to the wide use of glued laminated timber construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Emergent timber technologies: materials, structures, engineering, projects|last=Simone|first=Jeska|publisher=|others=Pascha, Khaled Saleh,, Hascher, Rainer, 1950-|year=2015|isbn=9783038215028|location=Basel|pages=40|oclc=903276880}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finger joints ===
The use of [[finger joint]]s with glulam allowed for production of glulam beams and columns on large scale. Glulam finger joints were developed to provide broad surface area for gluing. Automatic finger-jointing machines help cut the finger joints, connect and glue them together under pressure, allowing for a strong, durable joint, capable of carrying high loads comparing to natural wood with the same cross-section.&lt;ref&gt;Jeska 2015, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Numerical control|Computer numerical control]] ===
[[Computer Numerical Control|Computer-controlled fabrication (CNC)]] allows architects and designers to cut glued laminated timber in unusual shapes with a high degree of precision. CNC machine tools can utilize up to five axes, which enables undercutting and hollowing-out processes. In contrast with laser cutting machines, the cost-effective CNC machines carve the material using mechanical tools, like a router.&lt;ref&gt;Jeska 2015, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
=== Sports structures ===
[[File:Richmond Olympic Oval intern View.jpg|thumb|right|[[Richmond Olympic Oval]]]]
Sports structures are a particularly suitable application for wide-span glulam roofs.  This is supported by the light weight of the material, combined with the ability to furnish long lengths and large cross-sections. Prefabrication is invariably employed and the structural engineer needs to develop clear method statements for delivery and erection at an early stage in the design. The [[PostFinance Arena]] is an example of a wide-span sports stadium roof using glulam arches reaching up to 85 metres.  The structure was built in [[Bern]] in 1967, and has subsequently been refurbished and extended. Eastern Kentucky University's Alumni Coliseum was built in 1963 with the world's largest glued laminated arches, which span 308 feet, 3 1/2 inches. 

The roof of the [[Richmond Olympic Oval]], built for speed skating events at the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], features one of the world's largest clearspan wooden structures. The roof includes 2,400 cubic metres of Douglas-fir lamstock lumber in glulam beams. A total of 34 yellow-cedar glulam posts support the overhangs where the roof extends beyond the walls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imagelibrary.bcfii.ca/ViewImage.aspx?s=UmljaG1vbmQgT3ZhbHw=&amp;p=0&amp;i=17 Naturally:wood Richmond Olympic Oval]. Imagelibrary.bcfii.ca. Retrieved on 2015-09-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anaheim Ice|Anaheim ICE]], located in Anaheim, CA, is also an example of using glued laminated timber. Disney Development Company desired to build an aesthetic ice rink with less cost, and glulam was one of the most qualified materials in order to meet the owner's requirement. The architect [[Frank Gehry]], suggested a design with large double-curved Yellow-Pine Glulam beams, and the ice rink was constructed in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.apawood.org/publication-search?q=W120&amp;tid=1|title=Disney ICE - the warmth of wood heats up an Anaheim ice rink|last=|first=|publisher=[[APA - The Engineered Wood Association]]|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bridges ===
[[File:Accoya-Glulam-Bridge.jpg|thumb|Heavy-traffic Accoya Glulam Bridge at Sneek, The Netherlands]]
[[File:Wood bridge Montmorency.jpg|thumbnail|Glulam bridge crossing [[Montmorency River]], [[Quebec]]]]
Pressure-treated glulam timbers or timbers manufactured from naturally durable wood species are well suited for creating bridges and waterfront structures. Wood’s ability to absorb impact forces created by traffic and its natural resistance to chemicals, such as those used for de-icing roadways, make it ideal for these installations. 
Glulam has been successfully used for pedestrian, forest, highway, and railway bridges. 
An example in North America of a glulam bridge is at [[Keystone Wye]], South Dakota, constructed in 1966–1967. The [[Vebjørn Sand Da Vinci Project|da Vinci Bridge]] in Norway, completed in 2001, is almost completely constructed with glulam.

The Kingsway Pedestrian Bridge in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada, is constructed of cast-in-place concrete for the support piers, structural steel and glulam for the arch, a post tensioned pre-cast concrete walking deck, and stainless steel support rods connecting the arch to the walking deck.

=== Religious buildings ===
[[File:Cathedral of Christ the Light in Oakland, California LCCN2013635148.tif|thumb|The interior of [https://www.ctlcathedral.org/ the Cathedral of Christ the Light] formed with glued laminated timber]]
Glulam is also used for the construction of multi-use facilities such as churches, school buildings, and libraries, and [https://www.ctlcathedral.org/ the Cathedral of Christ the Light] in Oakland, California, is one of the examples in a way to enhance the ecological and aesthetic effect. It was built as the replacement of the Cathedral of St. Francis de Sales, which became unusable because of the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989. The 21,600-square-feet wide and 110-foot high Vesica Pisces-shaped building formed the frame with a glued-laminated timber beam and steel-rod skeleton covered with a glass skin. Considering the conventional way of construction with steel or reinforced concrete moment-frame, this glulam-and-steel combination case is regarded as an advanced way to realize the economy and aesthetic in the construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.apawood.org/publication-search?q=J140&amp;tid=1|title=Case Study: Cathedral of Christ The Light - The Ultimate Engineering Challenge|last=|first=|publisher=APA - The Engineered Wood Association|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''God's Country''''' is a 1985 [[documentary film]] about [[Glencoe, Minnesota]], by [[France|French]] filmmaker [[Louis Malle]]. Original footage of a farming community, 60 miles west of Minneapolis, Minnesota was filmed in 1979 for a PBS documentary. But for the next six years Malle was too busy with other projects to finish this work. He returned in 1985 for a follow-up and found the community reacting to the mid eighties crisis of overproduction in farm country. Malle documented a sense of frustration and apprehension from the same participants he had befriended in better times half a decade earlier.

The film is occasionally shown on [[Turner Classic Movies]], and is available on [[DVD]] from the [[Criterion Collection]].

The name of the film comes from the widespread belief in [[Folklore of the United States|American folklore]] that the [[United States of America]] has an exceptional status in the world as "[[God]]'s [[countryside|country]]" or "the promised land" because, metaphorically, early European settlers such as the Puritans of Massachusetts Bay believed they were founding at God's behest a [[City upon a Hill|shining city upon a hill]].

[[File:Ambassador Gregory L. Schulte at the GCSP 2.jpg|thumb|Gregory L. Schulte]]
'''Gregory L. Schulte''' (born 1958) was the U.S. ambassador to the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] from July 2005 through June 2009. Schulte served as the Permanent Representative of the United States to the [[United Nations Office at Vienna]], the International Atomic Energy Agency, and other international organizations in Vienna.  Assuming his post on July 13, 2005, Schulte was charged with advancing the President’s agenda in countering proliferation, terrorism, [[organized crime]], and corruption, while promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=255|title= Gregory Schulte Biography|publisher=US Department of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appointed by President [[George W. Bush]] in January 2003, Schulte served as Executive Secretary of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] (NSC) through March 2005. He was accountable to [[Condoleezza Rice]] for overseeing the NSC staff, the national security decision-making process, and the [[White House Situation Room]].

Schulte served as Senior Director for Southeast European Affairs on the NSC staff from 2000 to 2002, overseeing U.S. diplomacy and military deployments in [[Bosnia]] and [[Kosovo]] and collaboration with the United Nations and European Union. He helped guide and coordinate interagency efforts to bring democracy to [[Serbia]] and prevent civil war in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]].

From 1999 to 2000, Schulte served as Principal Director for Requirements, Plans and Counterproliferation Policy in the [[Office of the Secretary of Defense]] at [[The Pentagon]]. His duties included review of U.S. war plans and policy oversight of efforts to protect U.S. and allied forces in the face of nuclear, biological, and chemical threats.

As Special Assistant to the President for Implementation of the [[Dayton Peace Accords]] on the NSC staff from 1998 to 1999, Schulte coordinated U.S. diplomacy and support for the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO air campaign]] that stopped [[Operation Horseshoe|ethnic cleansing in Kosovo]]. He co-chaired the NSC Executive Committee that planned for the subsequent UN and [[NATO]] missions in Kosovo.

From 1992 to 1998, Schulte was assigned to the NATO International Staff in Belgium. As Director of the Bosnia Task Force, he helped prepare NATO’s first "out of area" operations and manage its relations with the United Nations, Russia, and other Partner countries. He worked with NATO political and military authorities to develop guidance for air strikes in Bosnia, deployment of [[Implementation Force (IFOR)|IFOR]], and transition to [[SFOR]]. He simultaneously served as Director for Nuclear Planning, assisting in the restructuring of NATO’s nuclear weapons posture after the [[Cold War]].

Schulte worked for the Secretary of Defense from 1985 to 1992 as Director for Strategic Forces Policy and Assistant for Theater Nuclear Forces Policy. He contributed to two nuclear weapons treaties, two Presidential Nuclear Initiatives, a Strategic Targeting Review, a Failsafe and Risk Reduction Review, and NATO’s Nuclear Planning Group.

'''Guamblin Island''', also known as '''Socorro Island''', '''Nuestra Señora del Socorro''' or '''Huamblin''', is a [[Chile]]an island.  It is part of the [[Chonos Archipelago]], although it is some 25&amp;nbsp;km distant from the other islands of the archipelago, far out in the [[Pacific Ocean]].

The island is a [[National Parks of Chile|National Park]], and listed as an [[Important Bird Area]].  It is a breeding ground of the [[sooty shearwater]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sitefactsheet.php?id=24781 BirdLife International: site fact sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil spill==
In June 1973, the [[Liberia]]n [[oil tanker]] ''Napier'' ran aground on the island and sparked an [[oil spill]] releasing 30,000 tons of oil. After the rescue of the crew, ''Napier'' was fired upon and set ablaze by Chilean [[Hawker Hunter]]s with the purpose of burning the oil to avoid further pollution.&lt;ref&gt;SIGWEB Sistemas integrados de Gestión, Carlos Saldivia, [http://www.sigweb.cl/biblioteca/DerramesPetroleoChile.pdf Las desconocidas historias de los tres derrames de petróleo en Chile], retrieved on 18 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an [[odd-toed ungulate]] [[mammal]] belonging to the taxonomic family [[Equidae]]. The horse has [[evolution of the horse|evolved]] over the past 45 to 55&amp;nbsp;million years from a small multi-toed creature, ''[[Eohippus]]'', into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began [[Domestication|domesticating]] horses around 4000 BC, and their [[domestication of the horse|domestication]] is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies ''caballus'' are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as [[feral horse]]s. These feral populations are not true [[wild horse]]s, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered [[Przewalski's horse]], a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true [[wild horse]]. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from [[equine anatomy|anatomy]] to life stages, size, [[equine coat color|colors]], [[horse markings|markings]], [[horse breed|breeds]], [[horse gait|locomotion]], and behavior.

Horses' anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a well-developed [[Equilibrioception|sense of balance]] and a strong [[fight-or-flight response]]. Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thespruce.com/learn-how-all-horses-sleep-1887328|title=Do You Know How Horses Sleep?|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female horses, called [[mare]]s, carry their young for approximately 11&amp;nbsp;months, and a young horse, called a [[foal]], can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under [[saddle]] or in [[Horse harness|harness]] between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30&amp;nbsp;years.

Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited "hot bloods" with speed and endurance; "cold bloods", such as [[draft horse]]s and some [[Pony|ponies]], suitable for slow, heavy work; and "[[warmblood]]s", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. There are more than 300&amp;nbsp;breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses.

Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits, as well as in working activities such as [[Mounted police|police work]], [[working animal|agriculture]], entertainment, and [[hippotherapy|therapy]]. Horses were historically used in warfare, from which a wide variety of [[equestrianism|riding]] and [[driving (horse)|driving]] techniques developed, using many different styles of [[Horse tack|equipment]] and methods of control. Many products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares. Humans provide domesticated horses with food, water and shelter, as well as attention from specialists such as [[veterinarian]]s and [[farrier]]s.

Specific terms and specialized language are used to describe [[equine anatomy]], different life stages, colors and breeds.

===Lifespan and life stages===
Depending on breed, [[horse management|management]] and environment, the modern domestic horse has a life expectancy of 25 to 30&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=Ensminger46/&gt; Uncommonly, a few animals live into their 40s and, occasionally, beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/horses/facts/info_age.htm|title=The Age of a Horse|publisher=Government of Ontario|website=Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs|author=Wright, B.|date=March 29, 1999|accessdate=2009-10-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120031232/http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/horses/facts/info_age.htm|archivedate=January 20, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest verifiable record was "[[Old Billy]]", a 19th-century horse that lived to the age of 62.&lt;ref name=Ensminger46/&gt; In modern times, Sugar Puff, who had been listed in ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the world's oldest living pony, died in 2007 at age 56.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thehorse.com/viewarticle.aspx?ID=9708|title= World's Oldest Living Pony Dies at 56|accessdate=2007-05-31 |author= Ryder, Erin |website= The Horse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of a horse or pony's actual birth date, for most competition purposes a year is added to its age each January&amp;nbsp;1 of each year in the Northern Hemisphere&lt;ref name=Ensminger46/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Manual of Horsemanship of the British Horse Society and the Pony Club |author=British Horse Society |year=1966|edition=6th edition, reprinted 1970 |publisher= British Horse Society |location= Kenilworth, UK |isbn= 978-0-9548863-1-8|page= 255}}&lt;/ref&gt; and each August&amp;nbsp;1 in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.studbook.org.au/DisplayPDF.aspx?ty=RULES |format=PDF |title= Rules of the Australian Stud Book |accessdate=2008-07-09 |year= 2007 |publisher=Australian Jockey Club |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exception is in [[endurance riding]], where the minimum age to compete is based on the animal's actual calendar age.&lt;ref name=Endurance&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aerc.org/HorseAge.aspx|title= Equine Age Requirements for AERC Rides|accessdate= 2011-07-25|publisher= American Endurance Riding Conference|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110811110201/http://aerc.org/HorseAge.aspx|archivedate= 2011-08-11|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following terminology is used to describe horses of various ages:

* [[Foal]]: A foal of either sex less than one year old. A nursing foal is sometimes called a ''suckling'' and a foal that has been weaned is called a ''weanling''.&lt;ref name=Ensminger418&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 418&lt;/ref&gt; Most domesticated foals are weaned at five to seven months of age, although foals can be weaned at four months with no adverse physical effects.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Giffin|Giffin]], p. 431&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Yearling (horse)|Yearling]]: A horse of either sex that is between one and two years old.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 430&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Colt (horse)|Colt]]: A male horse under the age of four.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 415&lt;/ref&gt; A common terminology error is to call any young horse a "colt", when the term actually only refers to young male horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Becker, Marty |author2=Pavia,Audrey |author3= Spadafori, Gina |author4=Becker, Teresa |title=Why Do Horses Sleep Standing Up?: 101 of the Most Perplexing Questions Answered About Equine Enigmas, Medical Mysteries, and Befuddling Behaviors|publisher=HCI|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7573-0608-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Qvz62nMkQLYC&amp;pg=PA23|page= 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Filly]]: A female horse under the age of four.&lt;ref name=Ensminger418/&gt;
* [[Mare]]: A female horse four years old and older.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 422&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Stallion]]: A non-castrated male horse four years old and older.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 427&lt;/ref&gt; The term "horse" is sometimes used colloquially to refer specifically to a stallion.&lt;ref name=Ensminger420&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 420&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gelding]]: A [[castration|castrated]] male horse of any age.&lt;ref name=Ensminger418/&gt;

In [[horse racing]], these definitions may differ: For example, in the British Isles, [[Thoroughbred]] horse racing defines colts and fillies as less than five years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.equibase.com/newfan/glossary-full.cfm|title= Glossary of Horse Racing Terms|accessdate=2008-04-03 |website= Equibase.com|publisher= Equibase Company, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Australian Thoroughbred racing defines colts and fillies as less than four years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studbook.org.au/DisplayPDF.aspx?ty=RULES|title=Rules of the Australian Stud Book|accessdate=2010-02-05|page=9|date=July 2008|publisher=Australian Jockey Club Ltd and Victoria Racing Club Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Size and measurement===
The height of horses is usually measured at the highest point of the [[withers]], where the neck meets the [[back (horse)|back]].&lt;ref name=Whitaker77&gt;[[#Whitaker|Whitaker]], p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; This point is used because it is a stable point of the anatomy, unlike the head or neck, which move up and down in relation to the body of the horse.

In English-speaking countries, the height of horses is often stated in units of [[Hand (length)|hands]] and inches: one hand is equal to {{convert|101.6|mm|in|0|order=flip}}. The height is expressed as the number of full hands, followed by a [[radix point|point]], then the number of additional inches, and ending with the abbreviation "h" or "hh" (for "hands high"). Thus, a horse described as "15.2 h" is 15 hands plus 2&amp;nbsp;inches, for a total of {{convert|62|in|cm|1}} in height.&lt;ref name=Ensminger51&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Horse-and-pony.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Size varies greatly among horse breeds, as with this full-sized horse and small pony.|alt=A large brown horse is chasing a small horse in a pasture.]]
The size of horses varies by breed, but also is influenced by [[equine nutrition|nutrition]]. Light riding horses usually range in height from {{hands|14|to|16|lk=off}} and can weigh from {{convert|380|to|550|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bongianni|Bongianni]], entries 1, 68, 69&lt;/ref&gt; Larger riding horses usually start at about {{hands|15.2|lk=off}} and often are as tall as {{hands|17|lk=off}}, weighing from {{convert|500|to|600|kg|sigfig=3}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bongianni|Bongianni]], entries 12, 30, 31, 32, 75&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy or [[draft horse]]s are usually at least {{hands|16|lk=off}} high and can be as tall as {{hands|18|lk=off}} high. They can weigh from about {{convert|700|to|1000|kg|sigfig=3}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bongianni|Bongianni]], entries 86, 96, 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest horse in recorded history was probably a [[Shire horse]] named [[Sampson (horse)|Mammoth]], who was born in 1848. He stood {{hands|21.2+1/4|lk=off}} high and his peak weight was estimated at {{convert|1524|kg}}.&lt;ref name=Whitaker60&gt;[[#Whitaker|Whitaker]], p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; The current record holder for the world's smallest horse is [[Thumbelina (horse)|Thumbelina]], a fully mature [[miniature horse]] affected by [[dwarfism]]. She is {{convert|17|in|cm|abbr=on}} tall and weighs {{convert|57|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=409317&amp;in_page_id=1770|title=Meet Thumbelina, the World's Smallest Horse |accessdate=2006-10-08 |author= Martin, Arthur |work= Daily Mail | location=London | date=2006-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ponies====
{{Main|Pony}}
Ponies are [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomically]] the same animals as horses. The distinction between a horse and pony is commonly drawn on the basis of height, especially for competition purposes. However, height alone is not dispositive; the difference between horses and ponies may also include aspects of [[phenotype]], including conformation and temperament.

The traditional standard for height of a horse or a [[pony]] at maturity is {{hands|14.2|lk=off}}.

Height is not the sole criterion for distinguishing horses from ponies. [[Breed registry|Breed registries]] for horses that typically produce individuals both under and over 14.2&amp;nbsp;h consider all animals of that breed to be horses regardless of their height.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the [[Missouri Fox Trotter]], or the [[Arabian horse]]. See [[#McBane|McBane]], pp. 192, 218&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, some pony breeds may have features in common with horses, and individual animals may occasionally mature at over 14.2&amp;nbsp;h, but are still considered to be ponies.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the [[Welsh Pony]]. See [[#McBane|McBane]], pp. 52–63&lt;/ref&gt;

Ponies often exhibit thicker manes, tails, and overall coat. They also have proportionally shorter legs, wider barrels, heavier bone, shorter and thicker necks, and short heads with broad foreheads. They may have calmer temperaments than horses and also a high level of intelligence that may or may not be used to cooperate with human handlers.&lt;ref name=EnsmingerHT11/&gt; Small size, by itself, is not an exclusive determinant. For example, the [[Shetland pony]] which averages {{hands|10|lk=off}}, is considered a pony.&lt;ref name=EnsmingerHT11/&gt; Conversely, breeds such as the [[Falabella]] and other [[miniature horse]]s, which can be no taller than {{convert|30|in|cm}}, are classified by their [[breed registry|registries]] as very small horses, not ponies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#McBane|McBane]], p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses that have a white coat color are often mislabeled; a horse that looks "white" is usually a middle-aged or older [[gray (horse)|gray]]. Grays are born a darker shade, get lighter as they age, but usually keep black skin underneath their white hair coat (with the exception of pink skin under white [[horse markings|markings]]).

===Reproduction and development===
{{Main|Horse breeding}}

[[Gestation]] lasts approximately 340&amp;nbsp;days, with an average range 320–370 days,&lt;ref name=Ensminger156&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; and usually results in one [[foal]]; twins are rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www2.okstate.edu/pio/twinfoals.html|accessdate=2008-09-23|title=Rare Twin Foals Born at Vet Hospital: Twin Birth Occurrences Number One in Ten Thousand| author=Johnson, Tom|website= Communications Services, Oklahoma State University|publisher= Oklahoma State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horses are a [[precocial]] species, and foals are capable of standing and running within a short time following birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Miller, Robert M.  |author2=Rick Lamb|title=Revolution in Horsemanship and What it Means to Mankind |publisher= Lyons Press|location=Guilford, Connecticut|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59228-387-3 |oclc=57005594|pages=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foals are usually born in the spring. The [[estrous cycle]] of a mare occurs roughly every 19–22 days and occurs from early spring into autumn. Most mares enter an ''anestrus'' period during the winter and thus do not cycle in this period.&lt;ref name=Ensminger150&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Foals are generally [[weaning|weaned]] from their mothers between four and six months of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extension.org/pages/29352/reducing-weaning-stress-in-foals|author=Kline, Kevin H.|title=Reducing weaning stress in foals|publisher=Montana State University eXtension|date=2010-10-07|accessdate=2012-04-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322182958/http://www.extension.org/pages/29352/reducing-weaning-stress-in-foals|archivedate=2012-03-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses, particularly colts, sometimes are physically capable of reproduction at about 18&amp;nbsp;months, but domesticated horses are rarely allowed to breed before the age of three, especially females.&lt;ref name=HorseTack129&gt;{{cite book |author= Ensminger, M.E.|title= Horses and Tack|edition= Revised|publisher= Houghton Mifflin Company|location= Boston, MA|year= 1991|isbn= 978-0-395-54413-6 |oclc= 21561287|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horses four years old are considered mature, although the skeleton normally continues to develop until the age of six; maturation also depends on the horse's size, breed, sex, and quality of care. Larger horses have larger bones; therefore, not only do the bones take longer to form [[Osseous tissue|bone tissue]], but the [[epiphyseal plate]]s are larger and take longer to convert from [[cartilage]] to bone. These plates convert after the other parts of the bones, and are crucial to development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equineortho.colostate.edu/questions/dod.htm |title=Developmental Orthopaedic Disease: Problems of Limbs in young Horses|accessdate=2008-04-20|author= McIlwraith, C.W.|publisher=Colorado State University|website=Orthopaedic Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anatomy===

====Skeletal system====
{{Main|Skeletal system of the horse}}
[[File:Horse anatomy.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|The skeletal system of a modern horse|alt=Diagram of a horse skeleton with major parts labeled.]]
The horse skeleton averages 205 bones.&lt;ref name=Evans90&gt;{{cite book |author= Evans, J.|title= The Horse|edition= Second|publisher= Freeman|location= New York, NY|year= 1990|isbn=978-0-7167-1811-6 |oclc= 20132967|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant difference between the horse skeleton and that of a human is the lack of a [[Clavicle|collarbone]]—the horse's [[Equine forelimb anatomy|forelimbs]] are attached to the [[Vertebral column|spinal column]] by a powerful set of muscles, tendons, and ligaments that attach the [[Scapula|shoulder blade]] to the torso. The horse's legs and hooves are also unique structures. Their leg bones are proportioned differently from those of a human. For example, the body part that is called a horse's "knee" is actually made up of the [[Carpus|carpal]] bones that correspond to the human [[wrist]]. Similarly, the [[hock (zoology)|hock]] contains bones equivalent to those in the human [[ankle]] and [[heel]]. The lower leg bones of a horse correspond to the bones of the human hand or foot, and the [[Equine anatomy|fetlock]] (incorrectly called the "ankle") is actually the proximal [[sesamoid bone]]s between the [[Equine anatomy|cannon]] bones (a single equivalent to the human [[Metacarpus|metacarpal]] or [[Metatarsus|metatarsal]] bones) and the [[proximal phalanges]], located where one finds the "knuckles" of a human. A horse also has no muscles in its legs below the knees and hocks, only skin, hair, bone, [[tendon]]s, [[ligament]]s, [[cartilage]], and the assorted specialized tissues that make up the [[horse hoof|hoof]].&lt;ref name=Ensminger21&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], pp. 21–25&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hooves====
{{Main|Horse hoof|Horseshoe|Farrier}}

The critical importance of the feet and legs is summed up by the traditional adage, "no foot, no horse".&lt;ref name=Ensminger367&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; The [[horse hoof]] begins with the [[distal phalanges]], the equivalent of the human fingertip or tip of the toe, surrounded by [[cartilage]] and other specialized, blood-rich soft tissues such as the [[Horse hoof#Internal structures|laminae]]. The exterior hoof wall and horn of the sole is made of [[keratin]], the same material as a human [[Nail (anatomy)|fingernail]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Giffin|Giffin]], p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; The end result is that a horse, weighing on average {{convert|500|kg}},&lt;ref&gt;[[#Giffin|Giffin]], p. 457&lt;/ref&gt; travels on the same bones as would a human on tiptoe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cvm.uiuc.edu/petcolumns/showarticle_pf.cfm?id=118|title= Yes, The Shin Bone Is Connected to the Ankle Bone|accessdate=2008-04-05 |author= Fuess, Theresa A.|website= Pet Column|publisher= University of Illinois |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060909161307/http://www.cvm.uiuc.edu/petcolumns/showarticle_pf.cfm?id=118 |archivedate = September 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the protection of the hoof under certain conditions, some horses have [[horseshoe]]s placed on their feet by a professional [[farrier]]. The hoof continually grows, and in most domesticated horses needs to be trimmed (and horseshoes reset, if used) every five to eight weeks,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Giffin|Giffin]], pp. 310–312&lt;/ref&gt; though the hooves of horses in the wild wear down and regrow at a rate suitable for their terrain.

====Teeth====
{{Main|Horse teeth}}

Horses are adapted to [[grazing]]. In an adult horse, there are 12&amp;nbsp;[[incisor]]s at the front of the mouth, adapted to biting off the grass or other vegetation. There are 24&amp;nbsp;teeth adapted for chewing, the [[premolar]]s and [[Molar (tooth)|molars]], at the back of the mouth. Stallions and geldings have four additional teeth just behind the incisors, a type of [[Canine tooth|canine teeth]] called "tushes". Some horses, both male and female, will also develop one to four very small [[Vestigiality|vestigial]] teeth in front of the molars, known as "wolf" teeth, which are generally removed because they can interfere with the [[bit (horse)|bit]]. There is an empty interdental space between the incisors and the molars where the bit rests directly on the gums, or "bars" of the horse's mouth when the horse is [[bridle]]d.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kreling |first=Kai |title=Horses' Teeth and Their Problems: Prevention, Recognition, and Treatment |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=3q1LINmOkOIC&amp;pg=PA117-IA1 |year=2005 |publisher=Globe Pequot |location=Guilford, CT |isbn=978-1-59228-696-6 |chapter=The Horse's Teeth |oclc=59163221|pages= 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimate of a horse's age can be made from looking at its teeth. The teeth continue to erupt throughout life and are worn down by grazing. Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear pattern, changes in tooth shape, and changes in the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. This allows a very rough estimate of a horse's age, although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear.&lt;ref name=Ensminger46&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], pp. 46–50&lt;/ref&gt;

====Digestion====
{{Main|Equine anatomy#Digestive system|Equine nutrition|l1=Equine digestive system}}
Horses are [[herbivore]]s with a digestive system adapted to a [[forage]] diet of grasses and other plant material, consumed steadily throughout the day. Therefore, compared to humans, they have a relatively small stomach but very long intestines to facilitate a steady flow of nutrients. A {{convert|450|kg|adj=on}} horse will eat {{convert|7|to|11|kg}} of food per day and, under normal use, drink {{convert|38|to|45|L}} of [[water]]. Horses are not [[ruminant]]s, they have only one stomach, like humans, but unlike humans, they can utilize [[cellulose]], a major component of grass. Horses are [[hindgut fermentation|hindgut fermenters]]. Cellulose fermentation by symbiotic bacteria occurs in the [[cecum]], or "water gut", which food goes through before reaching the [[large intestine]]. Horses cannot [[Vomiting|vomit]], so digestion problems can quickly cause [[horse colic|colic]], a leading cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Giffin|Giffin]], p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

====Senses====
[[File:Pferdeauge.jpg|thumb|A horse's eye|alt=Close up of a horse eye, with is dark brown with lashes on the top eyelid]]
{{See also|Equine vision}}
The horses' senses are based on their status as [[predation|prey animals]], where they must be aware of their surroundings at all times.&lt;ref name=Ensminger309&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], pp. 309–310&lt;/ref&gt; They have the largest eyes of any land mammal,&lt;ref name=Sellnow&gt;{{cite book|author=Sellnow, Les|title=Happy Trails: Your Complete Guide to Fun and Safe Trail Riding|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bOUTZgrGD6QC&amp;pg=PA46|year=2004|publisher=Eclipse Press|isbn=978-1-58150-114-8|oclc=56493380|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are lateral-eyed, meaning that their eyes are positioned on the sides of their heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=15938 | title=Eye Position and Animal Agility Study Published|journal = The Horse | date =March 7, 2010 |nopp=|accessdate=2010-03-11}} Press Release, citing February 2010 Journal of Anatomy, Dr. Nathan Jeffery, co-author, University of Liverpool.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that horses have a range of vision of more than 350°, with approximately 65° of this being [[binocular vision]] and the remaining 285° [[monocular vision]].&lt;ref name=Sellnow/&gt; Horses have excellent day and [[night vision]], but they have two-color, or [[Dichromacy|dichromatic vision]]; their [[color vision]] is somewhat like [[Red–green color blindness|red-green color blindness]] in humans, where certain colors, especially red and related colors, appear as a shade of green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.thehorse.com/viewarticle.aspx?ID=9670|title= In Living Color |registration=yes|accessdate=2007-07-27 |author= McDonnell, Sue |journal= The Horse |date= June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their [[Olfaction|sense of smell]], while much better than that of humans, is not quite as good as that of a dog. It is believed to play a key role in the social interactions of horses as well as detecting other key scents in the environment. Horses have two olfactory centers. The first system is in the nostrils and nasal cavity, which analyze a wide range of odors. The second, located under the nasal cavity, are the [[Vomeronasal organ]]s, also called Jacobson's organs. These have a separate nerve pathway to the brain and appear to primarily analyze [[pheromones]].&lt;ref name="Briggs smell"&gt;{{cite web|last=Briggs|first=Karen|title=Equine Sense of Smell|url=http://www.thehorse.com/articles/10055/equine-sense-of-smell|publisher=The Horse|accessdate=2013-12-15|date=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavior===
{{Main|Horse behavior|Stable vices}}
Horses are prey animals with a strong [[fight-or-flight response]]. Their first reaction to threat is to startle and usually flee, although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extension.org/pages/23342/horse-fight-vs-flight-instinct |title=Horse Fight vs Flight Instinct |publisher=eXtension |date=2009-09-24 |accessdate=2013-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also tend to be curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always flee from something that they perceive as non-threatening. Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. However, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.&lt;ref name=Natural226&gt;{{cite book|ref=McBane |author= McBane, Susan|title= A Natural Approach to Horse Management|publisher= Methuen|location= London|year= 1992|isbn= 978-0-413-62370-6 |oclc= 26359746|pages= 226–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses are [[herd animal]]s, with a clear hierarchy of rank, led by a dominant individual, usually a mare. They are also social creatures that are able to form companionship attachments to their own species and to other animals, including humans. They communicate in various ways, including vocalizations such as nickering or whinnying, mutual [[Social grooming|grooming]], and [[body language]]. Many horses will become difficult to manage if they are isolated, but with training, horses can learn to accept a human as a companion, and thus be comfortable away from other horses.&lt;ref name=Ensminger305&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], pp. 305–309&lt;/ref&gt; However, when confined with insufficient companionship, exercise, or stimulation, individuals may develop [[stable vices]], an assortment of bad habits, mostly [[Stereotypy (non-human)|stereotypies]] of psychological origin, that include wood chewing, wall kicking, "weaving" (rocking back and forth), and other problems.&lt;ref name=Prince214&gt;{{cite book |author1=Prince, Eleanor F.  |author2=Gaydell M.

====Intelligence and learning====
Studies have indicated that horses perform a number of [[Cognition|cognitive]] tasks on a daily basis, meeting mental challenges that include [[foraging|food procurement]] and identification of individuals within a [[Social structure|social system]]. They also have good [[Spatial visualization ability|spatial discrimination]] abilities.&lt;ref name=Hanggi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horsetalk.co.nz/features/horseintelligence-119.shtml|title=Understanding horse intelligence|author=Clarkson, Neil|date=2007-04-16|accessdate=2008-09-16|website=Horsetalk 2007|publisher=Horsetalk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are naturally curious and apt to investigate things they have not seen before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=True horsemanship through feel|last=Dorrance|first=Bill|publisher=The Lion Press|year=1999|isbn=978-1-58574-321-6|location=Guilford, CT|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have assessed equine intelligence in areas such as [[problem solving]], speed of learning, and [[memory]]. Horses excel at simple learning, but also are able to use more advanced cognitive abilities that involve [[categorization]] and [[concept learning]]. They can learn using [[habituation]], [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitization]], [[classical conditioning]], and [[operant conditioning]], and positive and negative [[reinforcement]].&lt;ref name=Hanggi/&gt; One study has indicated that horses can differentiate between "more or less" if the quantity involved is less than four.&lt;ref name="count"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=15396 | title=Horses Demonstrate Ability to Count in New Study |author=Lesté-Lasserre, Christa |accessdate=2009-12-06|website=The Horse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domesticated horses may face greater mental challenges than wild horses, because they live in artificial environments that prevent [[instinct]]ive behavior whilst also learning tasks that are not natural.&lt;ref name=Hanggi/&gt; Horses are animals of [[Habit (psychology)|habit]] that respond well to regimentation, and respond best when the same routines and techniques are used consistently. One trainer believes that "intelligent" horses are reflections of intelligent trainers who effectively use response conditioning techniques and positive reinforcement to train in the style that best fits with an individual animal's natural inclinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.bloodhorse.com/blogs/nicanor/archive/2008/06/17/equine-iq-what-big-brown-couldn-t-tell-you-and-mr-ed-kept-to-himself.aspx|title=What Big Brown Couldn't Tell You and Mr. Ed Kept to Himself (part 1)|author=Coarse, Jim|date=2008-06-17|accessdate=2008-09-16|website=The Blood Horse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Temperament====&lt;!--[[cold blooded (horse)]] and [[hot blooded (horse)]] redirect to this section so if the section name is changed change the redirects--&gt;
{{Main|Draft horse|Warmblood|Oriental horse}}
Horses are [[mammal]]s, and as such are [[warm-blooded]], or [[endotherm]]ic creatures, as opposed to cold-blooded, or [[poikilotherm]]ic animals. However, these words have developed a separate meaning in the context of equine terminology, used to describe temperament, not [[Thermoregulation|body temperature]]. For example, the "hot-bloods", such as many [[horse racing|race horses]], exhibit more sensitivity and energy,&lt;ref name=Belknap255&gt;[[#Belknap|Belknap]], p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; while the "cold-bloods", such as most [[draft horse|draft breeds]], are quieter and calmer.&lt;ref name=Belknap112&gt;[[#Belknap|Belknap]], p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes "hot-bloods" are classified as "light horses" or "riding horses",&lt;ref name=Ensminger71&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], pp. 71–73&lt;/ref&gt; with the "cold-bloods" classified as "draft horses" or "work horses".&lt;ref name=Ensminger84&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary b35 043-0.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Illustration of assorted breeds; slim, light hotbloods, medium-sized warmbloods and draft and pony-type coldblood breeds|alt=a sepia-toned engraving from an old book, showing 11 horses of different breeds and sizes in nine different illustrations]]
"Hot blooded" breeds include "[[oriental horse]]s" such as the [[Akhal-Teke]], [[Arabian horse]], [[Barb (horse)|Barb]] and now-extinct [[Turkoman horse]], as well as the [[Thoroughbred]], a breed developed in England from the older oriental breeds.&lt;ref name=Belknap255/&gt; Hot bloods tend to be spirited, bold, and learn quickly. They are bred for agility and speed.&lt;ref name=Catalog18/&gt; They tend to be physically refined—thin-skinned, slim, and long-legged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=DeFilippis, Chris |title=The Everything Horse Care Book |publisher=Adams Media |location= Avon, MA|year=2006 |isbn=978-1-59337-530-0 |oclc=223814651|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original oriental breeds were brought to Europe from the Middle East and North Africa when European breeders wished to infuse these traits into racing and light [[cavalry]] horses.&lt;ref name=Whitaker43&gt;[[#Whitaker|Whitaker]], p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Whitaker194&gt;[[#Whitaker|Whitaker]], pp. 194–197&lt;/ref&gt;

Muscular, heavy [[draft horse]]s are known as "cold bloods", as they are bred not only for strength, but also to have the calm, patient temperament needed to pull a plow or a heavy carriage full of people.&lt;ref name=Belknap112/&gt; They are sometimes nicknamed "gentle giants".&lt;ref name=Catalog15&gt;[[#Price|Price]], p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Well-known draft breeds include the [[Belgian (horse)|Belgian]] and the [[Clydesdale (horse)|Clydesdale]].&lt;ref name=Catalog15/&gt; Some, like the [[Percheron]], are lighter and livelier, developed to pull carriages or to plow large fields in drier climates.&lt;ref name=Guide87&gt;[[#Bongianni|Bongianni]], entry 87&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as the [[Shire horse|Shire]], are slower and more powerful, bred to plow fields with heavy, clay-based soils.&lt;ref name=Ens124&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], pp. 124–125&lt;/ref&gt; The cold-blooded group also includes some pony breeds.&lt;ref name="Bennett7" /&gt;

"[[Warmblood]]" breeds, such as the [[Trakehner]] or [[Hanoverian (horse)|Hanoverian]], developed when European carriage and [[horses in warfare|war horses]] were crossed with Arabians or Thoroughbreds, producing a riding horse with more refinement than a draft horse, but greater size and milder temperament than a lighter breed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Edwards|Edwards]], pp. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt; Certain [[pony]] breeds with warmblood characteristics have been developed for smaller riders.&lt;ref&gt;Examples are the [[Australian Riding Pony]] and the [[Connemara pony|Connemara]], see [[#Edwards|Edwards]], pp. 178–179, 208–209&lt;/ref&gt; Warmbloods are considered a "light horse" or "riding horse".&lt;ref name=Ensminger71/&gt;

Today, the term "Warmblood" refers to a specific subset of [[sport horse]] breeds that are used for competition in [[dressage]] and [[show jumping]].&lt;ref name=Lyons231&gt;{{cite book |author=Price, Steven D. |author2=Shiers, Jessie |title=The Lyons Press Horseman's Dictionary |publisher=Lyons Press |location=Guilford, CT |year=2007 |edition=Revised |isbn=978-1-59921-036-0|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strictly speaking, the term "[[Warmblood|warm blood]]" refers to any [[crossbreeding|cross]] between cold-blooded and hot-blooded breeds.&lt;ref name=Belknap523&gt;[[#Belknap|Belknap]], p. 523&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include breeds such as the [[Irish Draught]] or the [[Cleveland Bay]]. The term was once used to refer to breeds of light riding horse other than Thoroughbreds or Arabians, such as the [[Morgan horse]].&lt;ref name=Catalog18&gt;[[#Price|Price]], p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down. In an adaptation from life in the wild, horses are able to enter light sleep by using a "[[stay apparatus]]" in their legs, allowing them to doze without collapsing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/behavior/eqzzz629/|title= How Horses Sleep|accessdate= 2007-03-23|author= Pascoe, Elaine|website= Equisearch.com|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927193341/http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/behavior/eqzzz629/|archivedate= 2007-09-27|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Horses sleep better when in groups because some animals will sleep while others stand guard to watch for predators. A horse kept alone will not sleep well because its [[instinct]]s are to keep a constant eye out for danger.&lt;ref name="Horse sleep pt. 2"/&gt;

Unlike humans, horses do not sleep in a solid, unbroken period of time, but take many short periods of rest. Horses spend four to fifteen hours a day in standing rest, and from a few minutes to several hours lying down. Total sleep time in a 24-hour period may range from several minutes to a couple of hours,&lt;ref name="Horse sleep pt. 2"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/behavior/eqpowernap1771/|title= How Horses Sleep, Pt. 2&amp;nbsp;– Power Naps|accessdate= 2007-03-23|author= Pascoe, Elaine|website= Equisearch.com|date= 2002-03-12|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927193158/http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/behavior/eqpowernap1771/|archivedate= 2007-09-27|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly in short intervals of about 15&amp;nbsp;minutes each.&lt;ref name=Ensminger310&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; The average sleep time of a domestic horse is said to be 2.9 hours per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=40 Winks?|author=Holland, Jennifer S. |journal=National Geographic|volume=220|date=July 2011|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses must lie down to reach [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM sleep]]. They only have to lie down for an hour or two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements.&lt;ref name="Horse sleep pt. 2"/&gt; However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may suddenly collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/behavior/sleepdisorder_121506/|title= Equine Sleep Disorder Videos|accessdate= 2007-03-23|author= EQUUS Magazine Staff|website= Equisearch.com|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070510051620/http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/behavior/sleepdisorder_121506/|archivedate= 2007-05-10|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This condition differs from [[narcolepsy]], although horses may also suffer from that disorder.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book |author=Smith, BP |title=Large Animal Internal Medicine|publisher=Mosby|location=St. Louis, MO|year=1996 |edition=Second |isbn=978-0-8151-7724-1 |oclc=33439780|pages= 1086–1087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, this order contained 14&amp;nbsp;[[Family (biology)|families]], but only three—[[Equidae]] (the horse and related species), Tapiridae (the [[tapir]]), and Rhinocerotidae (the [[rhinoceros]]es)—have survived to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Perissodactyla.html|title= Order Perissodactyla|accessdate=2008-07-09 |author= Myers, Phil|website= Animal Diversity Web |publisher= University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known member of the family Equidae was the ''[[Hyracotherium]]'', which lived between 45 and 55&amp;nbsp;million years ago, during the [[Eocene]] period.

All that remains of them in modern horses is a set of small [[Vestigiality|vestigial]] bones on the leg below the knee,&lt;ref name=Natural&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/horse/?section=evolution&amp;page=evolution_b|title= The Evolution of Horses|accessdate=2008-07-09 |website= The Horse |publisher= American Museum of Natural History}}&lt;/ref&gt; known informally as splint bones.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Their legs also lengthened as their toes disappeared until they were a hooved animal capable of running at great speed.&lt;ref name=Natural/&gt; By about 5&amp;nbsp;million years ago, the modern ''Equus'' had evolved.&lt;ref name=Florida&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fhc/equus1.htm|title= Equus|accessdate=2008-07-09|website= Fossil Horses in Cyberspace |publisher= Florida Museum of Natural History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equid teeth also evolved from browsing on soft, tropical plants to adapt to browsing of drier plant material, then to grazing of tougher plains grasses. Thus proto-horses changed from leaf-eating forest-dwellers to grass-eating inhabitants of semi-arid regions worldwide, including the [[steppe]]s of Eurasia and the [[Great Plains]] of North America.

By about 15,000 years ago, ''Equus ferus'' was a widespread [[holarctic]] species.

{{Main|Wild horse}}
A truly wild horse is a species or subspecies with no ancestors that were ever domesticated. Therefore, most "wild" horses today are actually [[feral horse]]s, animals that escaped or were turned loose from domestic herds and the descendants of those animals.&lt;ref name=Olsen46&gt;{{cite book |author= Olsen, Sandra L.|chapter=Horse Hunters of the Ice Age|title= Horses Through Time|edition= First|publisher= Roberts Rinehart Publishers|location= Boulder, CO |year= 1996 |isbn=978-1-57098-060-2 |oclc= 36179575|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two never-domesticated subspecies, the [[Tarpan]] and the [[Przewalski's Horse]], survived into recorded history and only the latter survives today.

The [[Przewalski's horse]] (''Equus ferus przewalskii''), named after the Russian explorer [[Nikolai Przhevalsky]], is a rare Asian animal. It is also known as the Mongolian wild horse; [[Mongolia]]n people know it as the ''taki'', and the [[Kyrgyz people]] call it a ''kirtag''. The subspecies was presumed extinct in the wild between 1969 and 1992, while a small breeding population survived in zoos around the world. In 1992, it was reestablished in the wild due to the conservation efforts of numerous zoos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.zsl.org/about-us/media/press-releases/null,1790,PR.html|title= An extraordinary return from the brink of extinction for worlds last wild horse|date= 2005-12-19|accessdate= 2012-06-06|website= ZSL Press Releases|publisher= Zoological Society of London|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130516230420/http://www.zsl.org/about-us/media/press-releases/null,1790,PR.html|archivedate= 2013-05-16|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, a small wild breeding population exists in Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.treemail.nl/takh/|title= Home|accessdate=2008-04-03 |publisher= The Foundation for the Preservation and Protection of the Przewalski Horse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dohner298&gt;[[#Dohner|Dohner]], pp. 298–299&lt;/ref&gt; There are additional animals still maintained at zoos throughout the world.

The [[tarpan]] or European wild horse (''Equus ferus ferus'') was found in Europe and much of Asia.

Periodically, populations of horses in isolated areas are speculated to be [[Relict (biology)|relict]] populations of wild horses, but generally have been proven to be feral or domestic.

===Other modern equids===
{{Main|Equus (genus)}}
Besides the horse, there are six other species of [[genus]] ''Equus'' in the Equidae [[family (biology)|family]]. These are the ass or [[donkey]], ''Equus asinus''; the [[mountain zebra]], ''Equus zebra''; [[plains zebra]], ''Equus quagga''; [[Grévy's Zebra|Grévy's zebra]], ''Equus grevyi''; the [[kiang]], ''Equus kiang''; and the [[onager]], ''Equus hemionus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bucknell.edu/MSW3/browse.asp?id=14100020 |title=Equus hemionus |author=Pallas |year=1775 |website=Wilson &amp; Reeder's mammal species of the world |publisher=[[Bucknell University]] |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses can [[crossbreed]] with other members of their genus. The most common [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] is the [[mule]], a cross between a "jack" (male donkey) and a [[mare]]. A related hybrid, a [[hinny]], is a cross between a stallion and a [[jenny (donkey)|jenny]] (female donkey).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishmulesociety.org.uk/|title= Mule Information|accessdate=2008-07-10 |website= BMS Website|publisher= British Mule Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other hybrids include the [[zorse]], a cross between a zebra and a horse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1408717.stm|title=Zebra hybrid is cute surprise|date=June 26, 2001|accessdate=2010-02-06|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; With rare exceptions, most hybrids are [[infertility|sterile]] and cannot reproduce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12260255 |title=Befuddling Birth: The Case of the Mule's Foal|accessdate=2008-08-16|website=All Things Considered|publisher=National Public Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestication==
{{Main|History of horse domestication theories|Domestication of the horse}}
[[File:Bhimbetka rock paintng1.jpg|thumb|[[Bhimbetka rock shelters|Bhimbetka]] rock painting showing man riding on horse, India]]
Domestication of the horse most likely took place in central Asia prior to 3500 BC. Two major sources of information are used to determine where and when the horse was first domesticated and how the domesticated horse spread around the world. The first source is based on [[Paleontology|palaeological]] and [[archaeological]] discoveries; the second source is a comparison of DNA obtained from modern horses to that from bones and teeth of ancient horse remains.

The earliest archaeological evidence for the [[domestication of the horse]] comes from sites in [[Ukraine]] and [[Kazakhstan]], dating to approximately 3500–4000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 19265018| year = 2009| author1 = Outram| first1 = A.

Domestication is also studied by using the genetic material of present-day horses and comparing it with the genetic material present in the bones and teeth of horse remains found in archaeological and palaeological excavations.

Before the availability of DNA techniques to resolve the questions related to the domestication of the horse, various hypotheses were proposed. One classification was based on body types and conformation, suggesting the presence of four basic prototypes that had adapted to their environment prior to domestication.&lt;ref name="Bennett7"&gt;{{cite book |author= Bennett, Deb|title= Conquerors: The Roots of New World Horsemanship|edition= First|publisher= Amigo Publications, Inc.|location= Solvang, CA|year= 1998 |isbn=978-0-9658533-0-9 |oclc= 39709067|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothesis held that the four prototypes originated from a single wild species and that all different body types were entirely a result of [[selective breeding]] after domestication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Edwards, Gladys Brown |title=The Arabian: War Horse to Show Horse |publisher=Rich Publishing|year=1973 |edition=Revised Collectors |pages= 1, 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the lack of a detectable substructure &lt;!--huh? what's that?

===Breeds===
{{Main|Horse breed||List of horse breeds|Horse breeding}}

The concept of [[purebred]] bloodstock and a controlled, written [[breed registry]] has come to be particularly significant and important in modern times. Sometimes purebred horses are incorrectly or inaccurately called "thoroughbreds". [[Thoroughbred]] is a specific breed of horse, while a "purebred" is a horse (or any other animal) with a defined [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]] recognized by a breed registry.&lt;ref name=Ensminger424&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; Horse breeds are groups of horses with distinctive characteristics that are transmitted consistently to their offspring, such as [[equine conformation|conformation]], color, performance ability, or disposition. These inherited traits result from a combination of natural crosses and [[artificial selection]] methods. Horses have been [[Selective breeding|selectively bred]] since their [[domestication of the horse|domestication]]. An early example of people who practiced selective [[horse breeding]] were the [[Bedouin]], who had a reputation for careful practices, keeping extensive pedigrees of their [[Arabian horse]]s and placing great value upon pure bloodlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Edwards, Gladys Brown |title=The Arabian: War Horse to Show Horse |publisher=Rich Publishing|year=1973 |edition=Revised Collectors |pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pedigrees were originally transmitted via an [[oral tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waho.org/History.html |title=Is Purity the Issue? |accessdate=2008-04-29 |website=WAHO Publication Number 21 January 1998 |publisher=World Arabian Horse Organization |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705105054/http://www.waho.org/Purityissue.html |archivedate=5 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 14th century, [[Carthusian]] monks of southern Spain kept meticulous pedigrees of bloodstock lineages still found today in the [[Andalusian horse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/andalusian/index.htm|title= Andalusian |accessdate=2008-04-29|website= Breeds of Livestock|publisher= Oklahoma State University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312061526/http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/andalusian/index.htm|archivedate=2008-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interaction with humans==
[[File:Three Counties Equine Hospital - geograph.org.uk - 1770200.jpg|thumb|Equine hospital in the [[United Kingdom]]]]
Worldwide, horses play a role within human cultures and have done so for millennia. The genetic makeup of the human population in a geographical area is affected by the presence or absence of horses (more variation in Africa, less in Eurasian steppes). Societies where horse riding is an integral part of life have developed traditional attires specially suited for horse riding such as tightly wrapping [[waistband]]s or [[cummerbund]]s giving wide support useful for protecting the spine during long journeys, and voluminous headgear such as [[turban]] to protect the skull during falls from the horse. Horses are used for leisure activities, sports, and working purposes. The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) estimates that in 2008, there were almost 59,000,000 horses in the world, with around 33,500,000 in the Americas, 13,800,000 in Asia and 6,300,000 in Europe and smaller portions in Africa and Oceania. There are estimated to be 9,500,000 horses in the United States alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/573/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=573#ancor|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization|date=December 16, 2009|accessdate=2010-02-05|title=FAO Stat&amp;nbsp;— Live Animals}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Horse Council]] estimates that horse-related activities have a direct impact on the economy of the United States of over $39 billion, and when indirect spending is considered, the impact is over $102 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.cthorsecouncil.org/AHC2005JuneEconStudy.pdf|format=PDF|title= Most Comprehensive Horse Study Ever Reveals A Nearly $40 Billion Impact On The U.S. Economy|accessdate=2005-06-20|publisher= American Horse Council |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060625083812/http://www.cthorsecouncil.org/AHC2005JuneEconStudy.pdf |archivedate = June 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2004 "poll" conducted by [[Animal Planet]], more than 50,000 viewers from 73 countries voted for the horse as the world's 4th favorite animal.&lt;ref name=IOL&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iol.co.za/news/back-page/tiger-tops-dog-as-world-s-favourite-animal-1.228797|title=Tiger tops dog as world's favourite animal |accessdate=2011-06-01 |website= Independent Online|publisher= Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication between human and horse is paramount in any equestrian activity;&lt;ref name="Olsen"/&gt; to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a [[saddle]] on their backs to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a [[bridle]] or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Edwards, Elwyn Hartley |title=Horses|edition=Second American |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |location= New York, NY|year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7894-8982-1 |oclc=50798049|pages= 32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes horses are ridden without a saddle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Self, Margaret Cabell|title=Riding Simplified|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iUTm7aD1Mf8C&amp;pg=PA55 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-4191-0087-1|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Thorson, Juli S. |title=Rugged Lark |editor= Martindale, Cathy and Kathy Swan |encyclopedia= Legends 7: Outstanding Quarter Horse Stallions and Mares |publisher=Western Horseman |location= Colorado Springs, CO |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-911647-79-2 |page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many horses are also [[Driving (horse)|driven]], which requires a [[horse harness|harness]], bridle, and some type of [[horse-drawn vehicle|vehicle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Mettler, John J Jr.|title= Horse Sense: A Complete Guide to Horse Selection and Care|publisher= Storey Communications, Inc.|location= Pownal, VT|year= 1989 |isbn=978-0-88266-549-8 |oclc= 19324181|pages=47–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sport===
&lt;!-- There is a whole article about Equestrianism for all details about every possible sport. This article should only give the bare summary. So, please do not add elaborate sections of your own favorite horse sport here. --&gt;
[[File:Beijing2008 HOKETSU Hiroshi.JPG|thumb|upright 1.2|A horse and rider in [[dressage]] competition at the [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]]|alt=A chestnut (reddish-brown) horse being ridden by a rider in a black coat and top hat.

{{Main|Equestrianism|Horse racing|Horse training|Horse tack}}
Historically, equestrians honed their skills through games and races. Equestrian sports provided entertainment for crowds and honed the excellent horsemanship that was needed in battle. Many sports, such as [[dressage]], [[eventing]] and [[show jumping]], have origins in [[horses in warfare|military training]], which were focused on control and balance of both horse and rider. Other sports, such as [[rodeo]], developed from practical skills such as those needed on working [[ranch]]es and [[Station (Australian agriculture)|stations]]. Sport hunting from horseback evolved from earlier practical hunting techniques.&lt;ref name="Olsen"&gt;{{cite book |author= Olsen, Sandra L.|chapter=In the Winner's Circle: The History of Equestrian Sports|title= Horses Through Time|edition= First|publisher= Roberts Rinehart Publishers|location= Boulder, CO |year= 1996 |isbn=978-1-57098-060-2 |oclc= 36179575|pages=105, 111–113, 121}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horse racing]] of all types evolved from impromptu competitions between riders or drivers. All forms of competition, requiring demanding and specialized skills from both horse and rider, resulted in the systematic development of specialized breeds and equipment for each sport. The popularity of equestrian sports through the centuries has resulted in the preservation of skills that would otherwise have disappeared after horses stopped being used in combat.&lt;ref name="Olsen"/&gt;

Horses are trained to be ridden or driven in a variety of sporting competitions. Examples include [[show jumping]], [[dressage]], three-day [[eventing]], [[combined driving|competitive driving]], [[endurance riding]], [[Gymkhana (equestrian)|gymkhana]], [[rodeo]]s, and [[fox hunting]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Edwards|Edwards]], pp. 346–356, 366–371&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horse show]]s, which have their origins in medieval European fairs, are held around the world. They host a huge range of classes, covering all of the mounted and harness disciplines, as well as [[halter (horse show)|"In-hand"]] classes where the horses are led, rather than ridden, to be evaluated on their conformation. The method of judging varies with the discipline, but winning usually depends on style and ability of both horse and rider.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Edwards|Edwards]], pp. 376–377&lt;/ref&gt;
Sports such as [[polo]] do not judge the horse itself, but rather use the horse as a partner for human competitors as a necessary part of the game. Although the horse requires specialized training to participate, the details of its performance are not judged, only the result of the rider's actions—be it getting a ball through a goal or some other task.&lt;ref name=Edwards360&gt;[[#Edwards|Edwards]], p. 360&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these sports of partnership between human and horse include [[jousting]], in which the main goal is for one rider to unseat the other,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Collins, Tony |author2= Martin, John |author3= Vamplew, Wray  |title=Encyclopedia of Traditional British Rural Sports|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NWu6sLJn7-kC&amp;pg=PA174|publisher=Routledge |year=2005|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-415-35224-6|oclc=57005595|pages=173–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[buzkashi]], a team game played throughout [[Central Asia]], the aim being to capture a goat carcass while on horseback.&lt;ref name=Edwards360/&gt;

[[Horse racing]] is an equestrian sport and major international industry, watched in almost every nation of the world. There are three types: "flat" racing; [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechasing]], i.e. racing over jumps; and [[harness racing]], where horses trot or pace while pulling a driver in a small, light cart known as a [[sulky]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Edwards|Edwards]], pp. 332–337&lt;/ref&gt; A major part of horse racing's economic importance lies in the [[Gambling#Parimutuel betting|gambling]] associated with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Campbell, B.N. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-p7ZF9KW8-MC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA111,M1 |title=National Gambling Impact Study Commission Final Report (1999)|publisher=DIANE Publishing |location=Darby, PA|year=2001 |isbn=978-0-7567-0701-9|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They may also be the only form of transport allowed in [[wilderness area]]s. Horses are quieter than motorized vehicles.

The '''Kalu Ganga Dam''' is a large [[gravity dam]], and the second vital component of the larger and more complex '''Moragahakanda — Kalu Ganga Project''', currently under construction across the [[Kalu Ganga|Kalu Ganga ("''Black River''")]] at [[Pallegama]], in the [[Matale District]] of [[Sri Lanka]]. Construction of the project was launched by [[President of Sri Lanka|President]] [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]] on {{Nowrap|25 January 2007}}.&lt;ref name=ITNnews.lk&gt;{{cite news|title=Work on Moragahakanda Kalu Ganga Project progressing satisfactorily|url=http://www.itnnews.lk/?p=8859|accessdate=14 January 2014|newspaper=[[Independent Television Network|ITN News]]|date=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maiden waters of the dam was released in July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/180722/news/president-to-inaugurate-filling-of-kalu-ganga-reservoir-tomorrow-303547.html |title=President to inaugurate filling of Kalu Ganga reservoir tomorrow |publisher=The Sunday Times|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The larger combined project involves the construction of the Kalu Ganga Dam and Reservoir, along with the separate [[Moragahakanda Dam|Moragahakanda Dam and Reservoir]], for [[irrigation]] and [[hydroelectricity|power generation]] purposes. Both these sites would be located approximately {{Convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} apart.&lt;ref name=Treasury.gov.lk&gt;{{cite web|title=Moragahakanda and Kaluganga Development Project|url=http://www.treasury.gov.lk/depts/npd/publications/projecpipeline-chap/Irrigation.pdf|publisher=[[Ministry of Finance and Planning (Sri Lanka)|Ministry of Finance and Planning]]|accessdate=14 January 2014|page=2|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total development cost for both sites totals to approximately {{Nowrap|[[Sri Lankan rupees|Rs.]] 48.145 billion}} (approximately {{Nowrap|US$370 million}}) and is being carried out by [[SMEC Holdings]] and [[Sinohydro]].&lt;ref name=SMEC&gt;{{cite web|title=SMEC Wins Major Project with World’s Largest Hydroelectric Company|url=http://www.smec.com/about-smec/media/smec-wins-major-project-with-world-s-largest-hydroelectric-company|publisher=[[SMEC Holdings]]|accessdate=14 January 2014|date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LankaNewspapers&gt;{{cite news|title=Moragahakanda project on schedule|url=http://www.lankanewspapers.com/news/2014/1/86327.html|accessdate=14 January 2014|newspaper=LankaNewspapers.com|date=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyNews1&gt;{{cite news|title=Moragahakanda multi purpose project construction on track|url=http://archives.dailynews.lk/2013/06/03/bus19.asp|accessdate=14 January 2014|date=3 June 2013|author=Shirajiv Sirimane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
The development of the Kalu Ganga segment would cost {{Nowrap|[[United States dollar|US$]]167 million}}. 22% or {{Nowrap|US$37 million}} of this is funded by the [[Kuwait Fund]], 27.5% or {{Nowrap|US$46 million}} is funded by the [[Saudi Fund for Development]], while the rest if borne by the [[Government of Sri Lanka]]. The funds will be payable in {{Nowrap|20 years}}, including a 5-year grace period.&lt;ref name=LBO.lk1&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lanka negotiates OPEC funds for irrigation project|url=http://www.lankabusinessonline.com/news/sri-lanka-negotiates-opec-funds-for-irrigation-project/1448112562|accessdate=15 January 2014|newspaper=LBO.lk|date=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The funding from [[OPEC]] will carry an interest rate of 3.2%, and a service charge of 1% on the principle amount withdrawn and outstanding.&lt;ref name=LBO.lk1 /&gt;

== Dam and reservoir ==
[[File:Base of Kaluganga Dam.jpg|thumb|left|Base of Kaluganga Dam]]
The primary Kalu Ganga Dam will be a {{Convert|67|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high concrete [[gravity dam]], measuring {{Convert|546|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in length. To support the new Kalu Ganga Reservoir created by the dam, two additional [[saddle dam]]s will also be created to contain the reservoir. The primary dam and saddle dams are estimated to cost approximately {{Nowrap|US$102.2 million}}.&lt;ref name=LankaNewspapers /&gt;&lt;ref name=LBO.lk1 /&gt;

In addition to using the reservoir's water for irrigation, a percentage of it would be consistently transferred via tunnel to the [[Moragahakanda Dam|Moragahakanda Reservoir]] for further irrigation uses and hydroelectricity generation.&lt;ref name=ITNnews.lk /&gt;

==Environmental and Social Impact of the Dam Construction==
A large area of forest east of Pallegama has been cleared for the construction of the dam and even more so for the construction of a new residential and agricultural colony east of the dam. The forest area cleared is adjoining [[Wasgamuwa National Park]] and linked the forests on the eastern side of [[Knuckles Mountain Range]] with the [[Wasgamuwa National Park]]. Elephants and other wildlife used to inhabit this area and used it as corridor. There are attempts to minimize environmental impact by reforesting catchment areas, and declaration of elephant corridors to Wasgamuwa, Girithale, Mineriya national parks.&lt;ref&gt; Warushamana, Gamini. “[http://archives.sundayobserver.lk/2013/07/21/fin24.asp Development apace - impact on socio environment minimised]” in ''Sunday Observer Online'',  21 July 2013. Retrieved 3 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several old villages, including Pallegama and Rambukoluwa, have to be abandoned and all the residents have to relocate to the new colony, about 5 to 10 kilometers northeast of Pallegama. Each family is compensated with two acres of land, 1.5 acres of paddy land and half an acre in the residential area to construct a new house.&lt;ref&gt; Warushamana, Gamini. “[http://archives.sundayobserver.lk/2013/07/21/fin24.asp Development apace - impact on socio environment minimised]” in ''Sunday Observer Online'',  21 July 2013.

'''Lanthanum''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''La''' and [[atomic number]] 57. It is a [[Hardness|soft]], [[ductility|ductile]], silvery-white [[metal]] that tarnishes rapidly when exposed to air and is soft enough to be cut with a knife. It is the eponym of the [[lanthanide]] series, a group of 15 similar elements between lanthanum and [[lutetium]] in the [[periodic table]], of which lanthanum is the first and the prototype. It is also sometimes considered the first element of the 6th-period [[transition metals]] and is traditionally counted among the [[rare earth element]]s and in 3rd group. The usual [[oxidation state]] is +3. Lanthanum has no biological role in humans but is essential to some bacteria. It is not particularly toxic to humans but does show some antimicrobial activity.

Lanthanum usually occurs together with [[cerium]] and the other rare earth elements. Lanthanum was first found by the Swedish chemist [[Carl Gustav Mosander]] in 1839 as an impurity in [[cerium nitrate]] – hence the name ''lanthanum'', from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''λανθάνειν'' (''lanthanein''), meaning "to lie hidden". Although it is classified as a rare earth element, lanthanum is the 28th most abundant element in the Earth's crust, almost three times as abundant as [[lead]]. In minerals such as [[monazite]] and [[bastnäsite]], lanthanum composes about a quarter of the lanthanide content.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://webmineral.com/data/Monazite-(Ce).shtml |title=Monazite-(Ce) Mineral Data |website=Webmineral |access-date=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is extracted from those minerals by a process of such complexity that pure lanthanum metal was not isolated until 1923.

Lanthanum compounds have numerous applications as [[Catalysis|catalysts]], additives in glass, carbon arc lamps for studio lights and projectors, ignition elements in [[lighter]]s and torches, [[hot cathode|electron cathodes]], [[scintillator]]s, [[Gas tungsten arc welding|GTAW]] electrodes, and other things. [[Lanthanum carbonate]] is used as a [[phosphate binder]] in cases of [[hyperphosphatemia|renal failure]]. It is also an element in the 6th period and in the 3rd group.

==Characteristics==

===Physical===
Lanthanum is the first element and prototype of the lanthanide series.{{efn|Lanthanum is not always considered to be a lanthanide, partly because the term "lanthanide" means "like lanthanum" and therefore logically cannot include lanthanum itself, and also because lanthanum lacks the 4f electrons characteristic of the rest of the lanthanide series. This use of the term "lanthanide" is thus limited to the fourteen elements between cerium and lutetium inclusive.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1227&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|page=1227}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the periodic table, it appears to the right of the [[alkaline earth metal]] [[barium]] and to the left of the lanthanide cerium. Lanthanum is often considered to be a [[group 3 element]], along with its lighter [[congener (chemistry)|congeners]] [[scandium]] and [[yttrium]] and its heavier congener, the radioactive [[actinium]],&lt;ref name=Greenwood1102&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1102&lt;/ref&gt; although this classification is sometimes disputed. Similarly to scandium, yttrium, and actinium, the 57 electrons of a lanthanum atom are arranged in the [[electron configuration|configuration]] [Xe]5d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;6s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with three valence electrons outside the noble gas core. In chemical reactions, lanthanum almost always gives up these three valence electrons from the 5d and 6s [[electron shell#Subshells|subshells]] to form the +3 oxidation state, achieving the stable configuration of the preceding noble gas [[xenon]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood1106&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1106&lt;/ref&gt; Some lanthanum(II) compounds are also known, but they are much less stable.&lt;ref name=patnaik&gt;{{cite book | last =Patnaik | first =Pradyot  | date = 2003 | title =Handbook of Inorganic Chemical Compounds | publisher = McGraw-Hill | pages = 444–446| isbn =0-07-049439-8 |  url= {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=Xqj-TTzkvTEC |page=243 }} | accessdate = 2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the lanthanides, lanthanum is exceptional as it does not have any 4f electrons; indeed, the sudden contraction and lowering of energy of the 4f orbital that is important for the chemistry of the lanthanides only begins to happen at cerium. Thus it is only very weakly [[paramagnetic]], unlike the strongly paramagnetic later lanthanides (with the exceptions of the last two, [[ytterbium]] and [[lutetium]], where the 4f shell is completely full).&lt;ref&gt;Cullity, B. D. and Graham, C. D. (2011) ''Introduction to Magnetic Materials'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|9781118211496}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, since the melting points of the trivalent lanthanides are related to the extent of hybridisation of the 6s, 5d, and 4f electrons, lanthanum has the second-lowest (after cerium) melting point among all the lanthanides: 920&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Krishnamurthy, Nagaiyar and Gupta,  Chiranjib Kumar (2004) ''Extractive Metallurgy of Rare Earths'', CRC Press, {{ISBN|0-415-33340-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lanthanides become harder as the series is traversed: as expected, lanthanum is a soft metal. Lanthanum has a relatively high [[resistivity]] of 615&amp;nbsp;nΩm at room temperature; in comparison, the value for the good conductor aluminium is only 26.50&amp;nbsp;nΩm.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1429&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1429&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lanthanum is the least volatile of the lanthanides.&lt;ref name=radio&gt;[http://library.lanl.gov/cgi-bin/getfile?rc000021.pdf The Radiochemistry of the Rare Earths, Scandium, Yttrium, and Actinium]&lt;/ref&gt; Like most of the lanthanides, lanthanum has a [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal crystal structure]] at room temperature. At 310&amp;nbsp;°C, lanthanum changes to a [[face-centered cubic]] structure, and at 865&amp;nbsp;°C, it changes to a [[body-centered cubic]] structure.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;

===Chemical===
As expected from [[periodic trend]]s, lanthanum has the largest [[atomic radius]] of the lanthanides and the stable group 3 elements. Hence, it is the most reactive among them, tarnishing slowly in air and burning readily to form [[lanthanum(III) oxide]], La&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which is almost as basic as [[calcium oxide]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood1105&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1105–7&lt;/ref&gt; A centimeter-sized sample of lanthanum will corrode completely in a year as its oxide [[spallation|spalls]] off like iron [[rust]], instead of forming a protective oxide coating like [[aluminium]] and lanthanum's lighter congeners scandium and yttrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elementsales.com/re_exp/index.htm |title = Rare-Earth Metal Long Term Air Exposure Test|accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lanthanum reacts with the [[halogen]]s at room temperature to form the trihalides, and upon warming will form [[binary compound]]s with the nonmetals nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, boron, selenium, silicon and arsenic.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1106/&gt;&lt;ref name=patnaik/&gt; Lanthanum reacts slowly with water to form [[lanthanum hydroxide|lanthanum(III) hydroxide]], La(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=webelements&gt;{{cite web| url =https://www.webelements.com/lanthanum/chemistry.html| title =Chemical reactions of Lanthanum| publisher=Webelements| accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In dilute [[sulfuric acid]], lanthanum readily forms the aquated tripositive ion {{nowrap|[La(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;}}: this is colorless in aqueous solution since La&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; has no f electrons.&lt;ref name=webelements/&gt; Lanthanum is the strongest and [[HSAB theory|hardest]] base among the lanthanides and group 3 elements, which is again expected from its being the largest of them.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1434&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1434&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of lanthanum}}
Naturally occurring lanthanum is made up of two isotopes, the stable &lt;sup&gt;139&lt;/sup&gt;La and the [[primordial nuclide|primordial long-lived radioisotope]] &lt;sup&gt;138&lt;/sup&gt;La. &lt;sup&gt;139&lt;/sup&gt;La is by far the most abundant, making up 99.910% of natural lanthanum: it is produced in the [[s-process]] (slow [[neutron]] capture, which occurs in low- to medium-mass stars) and the [[r-process]] (rapid neutron capture, which occurs in core-collapse [[supernova]]e).&lt;ref name="Audi"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Audi | first = Georges | title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties | journal = Nuclear Physics A | volume = 729 | pages = 3–128 | publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center | date = 2003 | doi = 10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001 | bibcode = 2003NuPhA.729....3A | last2 = Bersillon | first2 = O. | last3 = Blachot | first3 = J. | last4 = Wapstra | first4 = A.

E. Woosley, D. H. Hartmann, R. D. Hoffman, W. C. Haxton: ''The ν-process.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal'', Vol. 356, 1990, p. 272-301. ({{doi|10.1086/168839}})&lt;/ref&gt; All other lanthanum isotopes are [[synthetic radioisotope|synthetic]]: with the exception of &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;La with a half-life of about 60,000&amp;nbsp;years, all of them have half-lives less than a day, and most have half-lives less than a minute. The isotopes &lt;sup&gt;139&lt;/sup&gt;La and &lt;sup&gt;140&lt;/sup&gt;La occur as [[fission product]]s of uranium.&lt;ref name=Audi/&gt;
&lt;!--
===Position in the periodic table===
Traditionally, from the 1940s, lanthanum has been placed under scandium and yttrium in group 3 of the periodic table, as its differentiating electron from the previous element goes into a d-orbital. This results in a consistent set of electron configurations in group 3 (Sc: [Ar]3d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; Y: [Kr]4d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;5s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; La: [Xe]5d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;6s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). However, this position has sometimes been disputed, on the grounds that yttrium and to a lesser extent scandium are closer in their chemical properties to lutetium than lanthanum. Indeed, early techniques on separating the rare earths relied on the distinction between the early lanthanides in the cerium group (whose sodium double sulfates dissolve in water with difficulty) and the late ones (as well as yttrium) in the yttrium group (whose sodium double sulfates are very water-soluble), prompting some researchers in the 1920s and 1930s to place lutetium under yttrium instead. Since the differentiating electron between ytterbium and lutetium also goes into a d-orbital, both lutetium and lanthanum appear by this argument as equally valid candidates for being the third member of group 3.&lt;ref name=Jensen1982&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Positions of Lanthanum (Actinium) and Lutetium (Lawrencium) in the Periodic Table |author=William B.

Many of the discrepancies between lanthanum and the lighter group 3 elements can simply be explained by its larger size, as expected from periodic trends, as it precedes the [[lanthanide contraction]] that makes the early period 6 transition metals so similar to their period 5 homologs.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1107/&gt; This phenomenon, based on the poor [[shielding effect|shielding]] of nuclear charge by the 4f electrons that are added across the lanthanide series, results in a decrease of [[ionic radius|ionic]] and atomic radii across the lanthanide series, causing the early period 6 transition metals (just after the lanthanides) until about [[rhenium]] to be very similar to their period 5 homologs. This same effect makes yttrium more similar to lutetium ([Xe]4f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;5d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;6s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) than lanthanum. However, scandium still shows many differences from lutetium because it is even smaller, and in any case the similarity of yttrium is more generally to all of the late lanthanides from [[gadolinium]] onward, especially [[holmium]] which has almost the same ionic radius.&lt;ref name=CottonSA2006&gt;{{cite book |last=Cotton |first=Simon |year=2006 |title=Lanthanide and Actinide Chemistry|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike all the other lanthanides, no lanthanum ions have any electrons in f-orbitals (La&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;: [Xe]5d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; La&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;: [Xe]5d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; La&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;: [Xe]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://vector.umd.edu/images/links/Extractive_Metallurgy_of_Rare_Earths_Gupta.pdf ''Extractive Metallurgy of Rare Earths''] by C.

The trends going down from scandium and yttrium to lanthanum tend to be more similar to those going down groups [[alkali metal|1]] and [[alkaline earth metal|2]] in the periodic table, while those going down from scandium and yttrium to lutetium tend to be more similar to those in the early transition metals. Since Sc&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Y&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, and La&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; still have a low enough charge for their compounds to be predominantly ionic, unlike Ti&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zr&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Hf&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, it has been argued that lanthanum and the rest of group 3 should be considered at best atypical transition metals, as their chemistry is focused on the predominantly ionic +3 state and they have a low ability to form coordination compounds or organometallic compounds. Indeed, lanthanum is a strongly electropositive metal, comparable to calcium in electropositivity.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1107/&gt; The rare earth metals in general are more similar in reactivity to the alkaline earth metals that immediately precede them than to the transition metals proper which follow them.&lt;ref name=CottonSA2006/&gt;

==Compounds==
[[Lanthanum oxide]] is a white solid that can be prepared by direct reaction of its constituent elements. Due to the large size of the La&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion, La&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; adopts a hexagonal 7-coordinate structure that changes to the 6-coordinate structure of [[scandium oxide]] (Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[yttrium(III) oxide|yttrium oxide]] (Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) at high temperature. When it reacts with water, lanthanum hydroxide is formed: a lot of heat is evolved in the reaction and a hissing sound is heard. Lanthanum hydroxide will react with atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] to form the basic carbonate.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1107&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1107–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Lanthanum fluoride is insoluble in water and can be used as a [[qualitative inorganic analysis|qualitative]] test for the presence of La&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. The heavier halides are all very soluble [[deliquescent]] compounds. The anhydrous halides are produced by direct reaction of their elements, as heating the hydrates causes hydrolysis: for example, heating hydrated LaCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; produces LaOCl.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1107/&gt;

Lanthanum reacts exothermically with hydrogen to produce the dihydride LaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a black, [[pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]], brittle, conducting compound with the [[calcium fluoride]] structure.&lt;ref name="Fukai"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fukai |first=Y. |year=2005 |title=The Metal-Hydrogen System, Basic Bulk Properties, 2d edition|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-00494-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a non-stoichiometric compound, and further absorption of hydrogen is possible, with a concomitant loss of electrical conductivity, until the more salt-like LaH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is reached.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1107/&gt; Like LaI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and LaI, LaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is probably an [[electride]] compound.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1107/&gt;

Due to the large ionic radius and great electropositivity of La&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, there is not much covalent contribution to its bonding and hence it has a limited [[coordination chemistry]], like yttrium and the other lanthanides.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1108&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1108–9&lt;/ref&gt; Lanthanum oxalate does not dissolve very much in alkali-metal oxalate solutions, and [La(acac)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] decomposes around 500&amp;nbsp;°C. Oxygen is the most common [[donor atom]] in lanthanum complexes, which are mostly ionic and often have high coordination numbers over 6: 8 is the most characteristic, forming [[square antiprism]]atic and [[snub disphenoid|dodecadeltahedral]] structures. These high-coordinate species, reaching up to coordination number 12 with the use of [[chelating ligand]]s such as in La&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·9H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, often have a low degree of symmetry because of stereo-chemical factors.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1108/&gt;

Lanthanum chemistry tends not to involve π bonding due to the electron configuration of the element: thus its organometallic chemistry is quite limited. The best characterized organolanthanum compounds are the [[cyclopentadienyl complex]] La(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which is produced by reacting anhydrous LaCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with NaC&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; in [[tetrahydrofuran]], and its methyl-substituted derivatives.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1110&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1110&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mosander Carl Gustav bw.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Carl Gustaf Mosander]], discoverer of lanthanum]]
In 1751, the Swedish mineralogist [[Axel Fredrik Cronstedt]] discovered a heavy mineral from the mine at [[Bastnäs]], later named [[cerite]]. Thirty years later, the fifteen-year-old [[Vilhelm Hisinger]], from the family owning the mine, sent a sample of it to [[Carl Scheele]], who did not find any new elements within. In 1803, after Hisinger had become an ironmaster, he returned to the mineral with [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]] and isolated a new oxide which they named ''ceria'' after the [[dwarf planet]] [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], which had been discovered two years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderkrogt.net/elements/rareearths.php |title=The Discovery and Naming of the Rare Earths |publisher=Elements.vanderkrogt.net |accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ceria was simultaneously independently isolated in Germany by [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood1424&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1424&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1839 and 1843, ceria was shown to be a mixture of oxides by the Swedish surgeon and chemist [[Carl Gustaf Mosander]], who lived in the same house as Berzelius: he separated out two other oxides which he named ''lanthana'' and ''[[didymium|didymia]]''.&lt;ref name="Weeks"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ed009p1231 | last = Weeks | first = Mary Elvira |authorlink=Mary Elvira Weeks| title = The Discovery of the Elements: XI.

From p. 356:  ''"L'oxide de cérium, extrait de la cérite par la procédé ordinaire, contient à peu près les deux cinquièmes de son poids de l'oxide du nouveau métal qui ne change que peu les propriétés du cérium, et qui s'y tient pour ainsi dire caché.  Cette raison a engagé M. Mosander à donner au nouveau métal le nom de ''Lantane''."'' (The oxide of cerium, extracted from cerite by the usual procedure, contains almost two fifths of its weight in the oxide of the new metal, which differs only slightly from the properties of cerium, and which is held in it so to speak "hidden".  This reason motivated Mr. Mosander to give to the new metal the name ''Lantane''.)

''to lie hidden'').&lt;ref name=Greenwood1424/&gt; Relatively pure lanthanum metal was first isolated in 1923.&lt;ref name=patnaik/&gt;

==Occurrence and production==
Lanthanum is the third-most abundant of all the lanthanides, making up 39&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of the Earth's crust, behind [[neodymium]] at 41.5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg and cerium at 66.5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg. It is almost three times as abundant as [[lead]] in the Earth's crust.&lt;ref&gt;

Lanthanum is considered a rare earth metal because the process to mine it is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive.&lt;ref name=patnaik/&gt; Lanthanum is rarely the dominant lanthanide found in the rare earth minerals, and in their chemical formulae it is usually preceded by cerium. Rare examples of La-dominant minerals are monazite-(La) and lanthanite-(La).&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Monazite acid cracking process.svg|thumb|center|730px]]
The La&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is similarly-sized to the early lanthanides of the cerium group (those up to [[samarium]] and [[europium]]) that immediately follow in the periodic table, and hence it tends to occur along with them in [[phosphate]], [[silicate]] and [[carbonate]] minerals, such as [[monazite]] (M&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[bastnäsite]] (M&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F), where M refers to all the rare earth metals except scandium and the radioactive [[promethium]] (mostly Ce, La, and Y).&lt;ref name=Greenwood1103&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1103&lt;/ref&gt; Bastnäsite is usually lacking in [[thorium]] and the heavy lanthanides, and the purification of the light lanthanides from it is less involved. The ore, after being crushed and ground, is first treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid, evolving carbon dioxide, [[hydrogen fluoride]], and [[silicon tetrafluoride]]: the product is then dried and leached with water, leaving the early lanthanide ions, including lanthanum, in solution.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1426&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1426–9&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedure for monazite, which usually contains all the rare earths as well as thorium, is more involved. Monazite, because of its magnetic properties, can be separated by repeated electromagnetic separation. After separation, it is treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with [[sodium hydroxide]] to pH 3-4. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that, the solution is treated with [[ammonium oxalate]] to convert rare earths to their insoluble [[oxalate]]s. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes one of the main components, [[cerium]], whose oxide is insoluble in HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Lanthanum is separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization. This salt is relatively less soluble than other rare earth double salts and therefore stays in the residue.&lt;ref name=patnaik/&gt; Care must be taken when handling some of the residues as they contain [[radium-228|&lt;sup&gt;228&lt;/sup&gt;Ra]], the daughter of &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th, which is a strong gamma emitter.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1426/&gt; Lanthanum is relatively easy to extract as it has only one neighbouring lanthanide, cerium, which can be removed by making use of its ability to be oxidised to the +4 state; thereafter, lanthanum may be separated out by the historical method of [[fractional crystallization (chemistry)|fractional crystallization]] of La(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·2NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, or by [[ion-exchange]] techniques when higher purity is desired.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1426/&gt;

Lanthanum metal is obtained from its oxide by heating it with [[ammonium chloride]] or fluoride and hydrofluoric acid at 300-400&amp;nbsp;°C to produce the chloride or fluoride:&lt;ref name=patnaik/&gt;

:La&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl → 2 LaCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

This is followed by reduction with alkali or alkaline earth metals in vacuum or argon atmosphere:&lt;ref name=patnaik/&gt;

:LaCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 Li → La + 3 LiCl

Also, pure lanthanum can be produced by electrolysis of molten mixture of anhydrous LaCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and NaCl or KCl at elevated temperatures.&lt;ref name=patnaik/&gt;

==Applications==
[[Image:Glowing gas mantle.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Coleman Company|Coleman]] [[white gas]] lantern mantle burning at full brightness]]
The first historical application of lanthanum was in gas lantern [[gas mantle|mantles]]. Carl Auer von Welsbach used a mixture of 60% [[magnesium oxide]], 20% lanthanum oxide, and 20% [[yttrium oxide]], which he called ''Actinophor'' and patented in 1885. The original mantles gave a green-tinted light and were not very successful, and his first company, which established a factory in [[Atzgersdorf]] in 1887, failed in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|title=Lighting |volume=16 |pages=656–658 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri16chisrich#page/656/mode/1up/search/Welsbach}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2018|reason=It seems that EB1911 confirms Carl Auer von Welsbach patented the process in 1880s but none of the specific details mentioned in this paragraph are in the EB1911}}

==Biological role==
Lanthanum has no known biological role in humans. The element is very poorly absorbed after oral administration and when injected its elimination is very slow. [[Lanthanum carbonate]] (Fosrenol) was approved as a [[phosphate binder]] to absorb excess phosphate in cases of [[end stage renal disease]].&lt;ref name=fosrenol/&gt;

While lanthanum has pharmacological effects on several receptors and ion channels, its specificity for the [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] receptor is unique among trivalent cations. Lanthanum acts at the same modulatory site on the [[GABA receptor]] as [[zinc]], a known negative [[allosteric]] modulator. The lanthanum cation La&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is a positive allosteric modulator at native and recombinant GABA receptors, increasing open channel time and decreasing desensitization in a subunit configuration dependent manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1007/s10517-005-0503-z|title = Lanthanum Potentiates GABA-Activated Currents in Rat Pyramidal Neurons of CA1 Hippocampal Field|date = 2005|author = Boldyreva, A. A.|journal = Bulletin of Experimental Biology and Medicine|volume = 140|pages = 403–5|pmid = 16671565|issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lanthanum is an essential cofactor for the methanol dehydrogenase of the [[methanotrophic]] bacterium ''[[Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum]]'' SolV, although the great chemical similarity of the lanthanides means that it may be substituted with cerium, praseodymium, or neodymium without ill effects, and with the smaller samarium, europium, or gadolinium giving no side effects other than slower growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1462-2920.12249 |pmid=24034209 |title=Rare earth metals are essential for methanotrophic life in volcanic mudpots |date=2013 |last1=Pol |first1=Arjan |last2=Barends |first2=Thomas R.

'''Low-''g'' condition''' is a phase of aerodynamic [[flight]] where the airframe is temporarily unloaded.  The pilot&amp;mdash;and the airframe&amp;mdash;feel temporarily "[[Weightlessness|weightless]]" because the aircraft is in [[free-fall]] or decelerating vertically at the top of a climb.  It may also occur during an excessively rapid entry into autorotation. This can have a disastrous effect on the aircraft, particularly in the case of helicopters, some of which need the rotor to constantly be under a non-zero amount of load.

== Effects ==

'''In smaller airplanes'''

Most smaller airplanes and gliders have no problems with 0''g'' conditions. In fact, it can be enjoyable to have zero gravity in the cockpit. To produce 0''g'', the aircraft has to follow a ballistic flight path, which is essentially an upside down parabola.
This is the only method to simulate zero gravity for humans on earth. 

'''In helicopters'''

In contrast, low-g conditions can be disastrous for [[helicopter]]s. In such a situation their [[helicopter rotor|rotor]]s may flap beyond normal limits. The excessive flapping can cause the root of the blades to exceed the limit of their hinges and this condition, known as mast bumping, can cause the separation of the blades from the hub or for the mast to shear, and hence detach the whole system from the aircraft, falling from the sky. This is especially true for helicopters with teetering rotors, such as the two-bladed design seen on [[Robinson Helicopter Company|Robinson helicopter]]s.
This effect was first discovered when many accidents with [[Bell UH-1]] and AH-1 helicopters occurred. These particular helicopters simply crashed without any obvious cause. Later, it was found that these accidents usually happened during low terrain flight after passing a ridge and initiating a dive from the previous climb.
Articulated and rigid rotor systems do not lose controlling forces up to 0''g'', but may encounter this depending on their flapping hinge offset from the mast. However, dangerous situations, as with a teetering rotor, may not occur.

'''On fixed-wing aircraft'''

Low-''g'' conditions can also affect [[fixed-wing aircraft]] in some instances, mainly by disrupting the airflow over the wings, making them difficult or impossible to control via the aerodynamic surfaces.

The controllability of an airplane by the control surfaces only depends on airspeed. So, if one keeps airspeed, control is retained. Usually the controllability is even increased, because there is no need to produce lift. 0''g'' forces are a minimal problem for fixed wing aircraft, but there are exceptions, including, but not limited to, airplanes with gravity-fed fuel systems.

==Use in space agencies==
To simulate 0-''g'' conditions some space agencies uses a modified passenger aircraft to simulate a low-''g'' condition. The [[ESA]] uses an [[Airbus A300]], for example. [[NASA]] has the [[Vomit Comet]]. One upside down parabola simulates 0''g'' for about 25 s.

A '''Ludwieg tube''' is a cheap and efficient way of producing supersonic flow. Mach numbers up to 4 in air are easily obtained without any additional heating of the flow. With heating, Mach numbers of up to 11 can be reached.

==Principle==
A Ludwieg tube is a [[wind tunnel]] that produces supersonic flow for short periods of time. A large evacuated dump tank is separated from the downstream end of a [[convergent-divergent nozzle]] by a diaphragm or fast acting valve. The upstream end of the nozzle connects to a long cylindrical tube, whose cross-sectional area is significantly larger than the throat area of the nozzle. Initially, the pressure in the nozzle and tube is high. To start the tunnel, the diaphragm is ruptured, e.g., by piercing it with a suitable cutting device, or opening the valve respectively. As always when a diaphragm ruptures, a [[shock wave]] propagates into the low-pressure region (here the dump tank) and an [[expansion wave]] propagates into the high-pressure region (here the nozzle and the long tube). As this unsteady expansion propagates through the long tube, it sets up a steady [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] flow toward the nozzle, which is accelerated by the [[convergent-divergent nozzle]] to a [[supersonic]] condition. The flow is steady until the expansion, having been reflected from the far end of the tube, arrives at the nozzle again. For practical reasons, flow times are about 100 milliseconds for most Ludwieg tubes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesis.library.caltech.edu/36/1/ThesisRootFinal.pdf Experiments on the Mechanism of Inducing Transition between Regular and Mach Reflection]&lt;/ref&gt; For many purposes, this flow duration is sufficient. However, by taking advantage of multiple quasi-static flows between expansion wave reflections, experimentation times of up to 6 seconds can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cobweb.ecn.purdue.edu/~aae519/BAM6QT-Mach-6-tunnel/summary-2006.pdf Facilities and Instrumentation for Hypersonic Measurements of Transition Mechanisms at Purdue University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117151651/http://cobweb.ecn.purdue.edu/~aae519/BAM6QT-Mach-6-tunnel/summary-2006.pdf |date=2007-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Ludwieg tube was invented by Hubert Ludwieg (1912-2000) in 1955 in response to a competition for a [[transonic]] or [[supersonic]] wind tunnel design that would be capable of producing high [[Reynolds number]] at low operating cost. Professor Ludwieg was also responsible for the experimental demonstration and explanation of the large effect of sweep on the drag of [[transonic]] wings (his dissertation in 1937).

==Turbines==
The farm has 38 [[Siemens]] [[wind]] [[turbine]]s, 23×2.3 [[megawatt]] and 15×1.3 megawatt turbines giving a total of 72.4 megawatts. 
Meentycat wind farm near Ballybofey in Co Donegal has an installed capacity of 72MW, making it the largest wind farm in Ireland. 

With a total of 38 turbines on five sites, Meentycat wind farm generates enough electricity to power the equivalent of approximately 45,000 homes a year, with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; savings approaching 200,000 tonnes per year. 

Power from the turbines is transmitted to the national grid via a 110kV substation located at Meentycat, a 5km 110kV overhead line and a 110kV substation at Drumkeen to the east of the wind farm. In January 2011, it was the largest wind farm (by [[electricity]] generated) in Ireland. It is now owned  by SSE Renewables Holdings Limited  part of the Scottish and Southern Energy Group

The material is typically available as white beads.  These beads are allowed to swell in suitable solvents (ethyl acetate, DMF, DMSO), which then allows the reagents to substitute the chloride substituents.&lt;ref&gt;Vaino, Andrew R.; Janda, Kim D.

Merrifield Resin can be prepared by [[chloromethylation]] of polystyrene or by the copolymerization of [[styrene]] and [[4-Vinylbenzyl chloride|4-vinylbenzyl chloride]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;François Dardel, Thomas V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2779">In the [[metric system]], a '''microgram''' or '''microgramme''' ('''μg'''; the recommended symbol in the United States when communicating medical information is '''mcg''') is a [[Physical unit|unit]] of [[mass]] equal to one millionth ({{val|1|e=-6}}) of a [[gram]]. The unit symbol is '''μg''' according to the [[International System of Units]]. In μg the prefix symbol for [[micro-]] is the Greek letter [[Mu (letter)|μ (Mu)]].

==Abbreviation and symbol confusion==
When the Greek lowercase “μ” (Mu) in the symbol μg is typographically unavailable, it is occasionally—although not properly—replaced by the Latin lowercase “u”.

The United States-based Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) and the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) recommend that the symbol μg should not be used when communicating medical information due to the risk that the prefix [[micro-|μ (micro-)]] might be misread as the prefix [[milli-|m (milli-)]], resulting in a thousandfold overdose. The non-[[International System of Units|SI]] symbol '''mcg''' is recommended instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.ismp.org/recommendations/error-prone-abbreviations-list
|title=ISMP’s List of Error-Prone Abbreviations, Symbols, and Dose Designations
|accessdate=2018-03-28
|publisher=ISMP}}&lt;/ref&gt;However, the abbreviation mcg is also the symbol for an obsolete [[CGS]] unit of measure known as millicentigram, which is equal to 10&amp;nbsp;μg.

In the UK, because serious medication errors have been made from the confusion between milligrams and micrograms when micrograms has been abbreviated, the recommendation given in the Scottish Palliative Care Guidelines is that doses of less than one milligram ''must'' be expressed in micrograms and that the word ‘microgram’ must be written in full, and that it is never acceptable to use “mcg” or “μg”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palliativecareguidelines.scot.nhs.uk/guidelines/about-the-guidelines/pharmacological-considerations/prescribing-information-for-liquid-medicines.aspx Scottish Palliative Care Guidelines – Dose Prescribing Information for Liquid Medicines]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gamma (symbol: [[γ]]) is a deprecated non-[[International System of Units|SI]] unit of [[mass]] equal to one microgram.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-measures/publications/nist-handbooks/handbook-133 NIST Handbook 133 - 2018], [https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2017/04/28/12-apde-gentab-11-hb133-final.pdf#page=17 Appendix E.

In [[astrophysics]] and [[particle physics]], '''self-interacting dark matter''' ('''SIDM''') assumes [[dark matter]] has self-interactions, in contrast to the collisionless dark matter assumed by the [[Lambda-CDM model]].

[[File:Anacortes Refinery 32017.JPG|thumb|Storage tanks and towers at Shell Puget Sound Refinery ([[Shell Oil Company]]), [[Anacortes, Washington]]]]
Shell Oil Products US, a subsidiary of [[Shell Oil|Royal Dutch Shell PLC]], operates the '''Puget Sound Refinery''' located on March Point outside of [[Anacortes, WA]]. The plant is the largest taxpayer in [[Skagit County]] and one of the county's largest employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Shell Puget Sound Refinery|url = http://www.shell.us/about-us/projects-and-locations/puget-sound-refinery/about-shell-puget-sound-refinery.html|website = www.shell.us|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The refinery has a 145,000 b/d capacity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/refinerycapacity/table3.pdf|title = EIA.

Based on the secondary processing units in place, the facility likely follows a 3-2-1 crack spread. Shell’s refinery produces three grades of gasoline, fuel oil, diesel fuel, propane and butane. This plant is currently the only refinery in [[Washington state]] unable to accommodate [[tight oil]] via rail. The permitting process is currently underway for the proposed 60,000 b/d unloading capacity of the East Gate Rail Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shell Oil Products Proposed Crude by Rail Unloading Facility|url = http://skagitcounty.net/Departments/PlanningAndPermit/shellpermit.htm|website = skagitcounty.net|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Puget Sound Refinery was built by [[Texaco]] in 1957. Its initial 45,000 b/d capacity came online in 1958.

Prior to 1998 Shell Oil operated the '''Shell Anacortes Refinery'''. Shell and Texaco combined their refining and marketing operations, assets valued at $17 billion, in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Business {{!}} Shell-Texaco Deal OK'd - Shell Sells Anacortes Refinery {{!}} Seattle Times Newspaper|url = http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19971220&amp;slug=2579152|website = community.seattletimes.nwsource.com|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The joint business, Equilon Enterprises - later to become part of [[Motiva Enterprises]], subsequently co-owned both refineries on March Point outside of Anacortes. Antitrust litigation accepted the deal under the condition that Shell sell its preexisting refinery. [[Tesoro]], an independent Texas-based midstream and downstream company, won bidding for Shell's refinery at a $237 million, with an additional payment of $60 million for net working capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tesoro Wins Bidding for Shell's Anacortes Plant |work=The Oil Daily|publisher=[[HighBeam Research]]|url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-20556811.html|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The refinery is now known as the [[Marathon Anacortes Refinery]].

[[Palm oil]], produced from the [[oil palm]], is a basic source of income for many farmers in South East Asia, Central and West Africa, and Central America. It is locally used as a cooking oil, exported for use in many commercial food and personal care products and is converted into biofuel. It produces up to 10 times more oil per unit area than [[soyabean]]s, [[rapeseed]] or [[sunflower]]s.&lt;ref name=econ2010 /&gt;

In Indonesia, rising demand for palm oil and timber has led to the clearing of [[tropical forest]] land in [[National parks of Indonesia|Indonesian national parks]]. According to a 2007 report published by [[UNEP]], at the rate of deforestation at that time, an estimated 98 percent of Indonesian forest would be destroyed by 2022 due to legal and illegal logging, [[forest fire]]s and the development of palm oil plantations.&lt;ref name="UNEP Report"/&gt;

Malaysia, the second largest producer of palm oil has pledged to conserve a minimum of 50 percent of its total land area as forests. As of 2010, 58 percent of Malaysia was forested.&lt;ref name="Morales"&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia Has Little Room for Expanding Palm-Oil Production, Minister Says |last1=Morales |first1=Alex |last2= |first2= |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-18/malaysia-has-little-room-for-palm-oil-expansion-plantation-minister-says.html |newspaper=Bloomberg |date=18 November 2010 |accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water pollution===
{{main|water pollution}}
In some states where oil palm is established, lax enforcement of environmental legislation leads to encroachment of plantations into riparian strips,&lt;ref name = NST&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1001069/cut_down_oil_palm_on_river_banks_plantations_warned/index.html | title = Cut Down Oil Palm on River Banks, Plantations Warned  | publisher = New Straits Times | accessdate= 2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and release of pollutants such as palm oil mill effluent (POME) in the environment.&lt;ref name = NST/&gt;

More environment-friendly practices have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.sabah.gov.my/jpas/programs/ecd-cab/technical/OP211100.pdf | title = Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Guidelines for Oil Palm Plantation Development  | publisher =  | accessdate= 2007-11-29|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.rspo.org/default.aspx | title = Promoting the Growth and Use of Sustainable Palm Oil  | publisher = RSPO | accessdate= 2007-12-01 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070706035506/http://www.rspo.org/default.aspx &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those approaches is anaerobic treatment of POME, which might allow for biogas (methane) production and electricity generation, but it is very difficult to maintain optimum growth conditions for the anaerobic organisms that break down acetate to methane (primarily ''[[Methanosaeta]] concilii'', a species of [[Archaea]]).&lt;ref name="ejbiotechnology.info"&gt;[http://www.ejbiotechnology.info/content/vol12/issue3/full/4/4.pdf PCR-Based DGGE and FISH Analysis of Methanogens in Anaerobic Closed Digester Tank Treating Palm Oil Mill Effluent.] Meisam Tabatabaei, Mohd Rafein Zakaria, Raha Abdul Rahim, André-Denis G.

===Greenhouse gas emissions===
Damage to [[peatland]], partly due to palm oil production, is claimed to contribute to environmental degradation, including four percent of global [[greenhouse gas emissions]]&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/news/palm-oil_cooking-the-climate Cooking the Climate] Greenpeace UK Report, November 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and eight percent of all global emissions caused annually by burning fossil fuels,&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/business/worldbusiness/31biofuel.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=e653a375e67e8e49&amp;ex=1327899600&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss Once a Dream, Palm Oil May Be an Eco-Nightmare] The New York Times, January 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; due to the clearing of large areas of rainforest for palm oil plantations. Many Indonesian and Malaysian rainforests lie atop [[peat bogs]] that store great quantities of [[carbon]]. Forest removal and bog drainage to make way for plantations releases this carbon.

Researchers are looking for possible solutions and ways to help the situation and have suggested that if enough land is conserved and there remain large enough areas of primary forest reserves, the effects of the palm oil industry may not have as much of an impact on wildlife and biodiversity. Environmental groups like Greenpeace, the [[Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil]], and [[Amnesty International]] are also taking part in advocating bans on unsustainable palm oil crops and the companies that purchase these exports.

Environmental groups such as [[Greenpeace]] claim that this [[deforestation]] produces far more emissions than biofuels remove.&lt;ref name="pachter"&gt;{{

Greenpeace recorded peatland destruction in the Indonesian province of Riau on the island of [[Sumatra]], home to 25 percent of Indonesia's palm oil plantations.

===Indonesia and Malaysia===
{{Main|Palm oil production in Indonesia|Palm oil production in Malaysia}}

In the two countries responsible for over 80% of world oil palm production, Indonesia and Malaysia, smallholders account for 35–40% of the total area of planted oil palm and as much as 33% of the output. Elsewhere, as in West African countries that produce mainly for domestic and regional markets, smallholders produce up to 90% of the annual harvest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iied.org/pubs/display.php?o=13533IIED Vermeulen and Goad. 2006. Towards better practice in smallholder palm oil production. IIED]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of Malaysia's commitment to retain natural forest cover on at least 50 percent of the nation's land, the growth of new palm oil plantations has slowed in recent years. According to Malaysia's Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister Bernard Dompok, significant expansion of palm oil is no longer possible, therefore Malaysian farmers are now focusing on increasing production without expansion.&lt;ref name="Morales"/&gt;

In January 2008, the CEO of the Malaysian Palm Oil Council wrote a letter to the Wall Street Journal stating that Malaysia was aware of the need to pursue a [[sustainability|sustainable]] palm oil industry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120122705116215667 Malaysian Palm Trees Are Fine and Green, Too].

OP-ED letter from the CEO of the Malaysian Palm Oil Council, WSJ online&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the Malaysian government, along with palm oil companies, have increased production of certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO).&lt;ref name="Sarif"/&gt; Malaysia has been recognized by the [[Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil]] as the largest producer of CSPO, producing 50 percent of the world's supply,&lt;ref name="McDougall"&gt;{{cite news |title=RSPO names Malaysia as world's largest producer of sustainable palm oil |last1=McDougall |first1=Andrew |last2= |first2= |url=http://www.cosmeticsdesign-asia.com/Formulation-Science/RSPO-names-Malaysia-as-world-s-largest-producer-of-sustainable-palm-oil |newspaper=Cosmetics Design |date=22 June 2011 |accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accounting for 40% of CSPO growers worldwide.&lt;ref name="WWF2012"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sustainable plam oil is good for business WWF study |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |url=http://www.wwf.org.my/media_and_information/newsroom_main/?uNewsID=13940 |newspaper=World Wildlife Federation |date=10 April 2012 |accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesia produces 35 percent of the world's CSPO.&lt;ref name="Sarif"&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia expected to maintain position as world’s largest producer of Certified Sustainable Palm Oil |last1=Sarif |first1=Edy |last2= |first2= |url=http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/6/17/business/8916226&amp;sec=business |newspaper=The Malaysian Star |date=17 June 2011 |accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesia, the Indigenous Peoples' Alliance of the Archipelago (AMAN) under the direction of [[Mina Susana Setra]] has fought for policies that find balance between economic need and indigenous people's rights. 99% of the palm oil concessions in the country concern land that is occupied by indigenous people.&lt;ref name="Eshelman (2014)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eshelman|first1=Robert S.|title=Indonesian government's concession policy prioritizes companies over forest communities|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2014/1103-sri-eshelman-indonesia-industrial-concessions.html|accessdate=31 March 2015|publisher=Mongabay|date=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, AMAN led an advocacy team which won a Constitutional Court case recognizing customary land rights;&lt;ref name="Nasional  (2014)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Media|first1=Tim|title=Mina Setra Wakili Regio Kalimantan|url=http://dkn.or.id/en/2014/05/08/mina-setra-wakili-regio-kalimantan/|accessdate=31 March 2015|publisher=Dewan Kehutanan Nasional|date=May 8, 2014|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, implementation of programs that protect indigenous rights, the environment and developers have failed to come to fruition except in limited cases.&lt;ref name="Eshelman (2014)" /&gt;

===Africa===
In Africa, the situation is very different compared to Indonesia or Malaysia. In its [[Human Development Report]] 2007-2008, the [[United Nations Development Program]] says production of palm oil in West Africa is largely sustainable, mainly because it is undertaken on a smallholder level without resorting to diversity-damaging [[monoculture]]. The United Nations Food and Agriculture program is encouraging small farmers across Africa to grow palm oil, because the crop offers opportunities to improve livelihoods and incomes for the poor.&lt;ref name=hdr2008&gt;

==Increasing demand==
Food and cosmetics companies, including [[Archer Daniels Midland|ADM]], [[Unilever]], [[Cargill]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Nestle]], [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]] and [[Burger King]], are driving the demand for new palm oil supplies,&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.greenpeace.org/cookingtheclimate Cooking the Climate – palm oil industry] Greenpeace November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; demand was partly driven by a need for a replacement for high [[trans fat]] content oils.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.reuters.com/article/companyNewsAndPR/idUSN0318207820070303 US soyoil, low in trans fat, faces palm threat], Reuters, 3 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Although palm oil is used in the production of [[biofuel]]s and proposals have been made to use it in large installations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/press_releases/burning_palm_oil_fuels_cli_23082006.html|title=Burning palm oil fuels climate change|publisher=Friends of the Earth|date=Aug 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 2012 report by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] concluded that the increase in palm oil production is related to food demands, not biofuel demands.&lt;ref name="Saunders"&gt;{{Cite report |last1= Saunders |first1=Daniel J. |last2=Balagtas |first2=Joseph V. |last3=Gruere |first3=Guillaume |date=March 2012 |title=Revisiting the Palm Oil Boom in Southeast Asia |url=http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ifpridp01167.pdf |publisher=International Food Policy Research Institute |accessdate=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biodiesel===
[[Biodiesel]] made from palm oil grown on sustainable non-forest land and from established plantations reduces greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="CSIRO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csiro.au/resources/pf13o.html |title=The greenhouse and air quality emissions of biodiesel blends in Australia |date=26 November 2007 |work=csiro.au |publisher=The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation |accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Greenpeace, clearing peatland to plant oil palms releases large amounts of [[greenhouse gasses]], and that biodiesel produced from oil palms grown on this land may not result in a net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="Greenpeace FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/forests/faq-palm-oil-forests-and-climate-change |title=FAQ: Palm oil, forests and climate change |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |work=greenpeace.org.uk |publisher=Greenpeace UK |accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research by Malaysia's Tropical Peat Research Unit has found that oil palm plantations developed on peatland produce lower carbon dioxide emissions than forest peat swamp. However, it has been suggested that this research unit was commissioned by politicians who have interests in the palm oil industry.&lt;ref name=Wong2&gt;{{cite news |title=Less carbon dioxide from oil palm estates |author=Jack Wong |url=http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/9/20/business/7042775 |work=The Star |date=20 September 2010 |accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, eight of Malaysia's [[Federal Land Development Authority]] (FELDA) plantations were certified under the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification System (ISCC), becoming part of Asia's first ISCC certified supply and production chain for palm biodiesel. This certification system complies with the European Union's Renewable Energy Directive (RED).&lt;ref name="Vogele"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mission achieves ISCC certification, loses contract with Chevron |author=Erin Vogele |url=http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/articles/7671/mission-achieves-iscc-certification-loses-contract-with-chevron |work=Biodiesel Magazine |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the [[European Commission]] approved the RSPO's biofuel certification scheme allowing certified sustainable palm oil biofuel to be sold in Europe.&lt;ref name="RSPO press"&gt;{{cite press release |title=RSPO Announcement: On the Approval from the European Commission of RSPO-RED, the Biofuels Certification Scheme of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil |url=http://www.rspo.org/news_details.php?nid=137 |publisher=RSPO |date=28 November 2012 |accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainability==
[[File:Palm forest.jpg|thumb|250px|In Borneo, the forest (F), is being replaced by oil palm plantations (G). These changes are irreversible for all practical purposes (H).]]

The [[Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil]] (RSPO), founded in 2004, works to promote the production of sustainably sourced palm oil through involvement with growers, processors, food companies, investors and NGOs.&lt;ref name=econ2010/&gt; Beginning in 2008, palm oil that meets RSPO introduced standards has been designated "certified sustainable palm oil" (CSPO). Within two years of implementation, CSPO-designated palm oil comprised 7 percent of the global palm oil market.&lt;ref name="Adnan"&gt;{{cite news |title=A shot in the arm for CSPO |last1=Adnan |first1=Hanim |url=http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?sec=business&amp;file=/2011/3/28/business/8360810 |newspaper=The Star Online |date=28 March 2011 |accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2012, 12 percent of palm oil has been certified by the RSPO.&lt;ref name="Watson"&gt;{{cite news |title=WWF: Industry should buy into GreenPalm today, or it will struggle to source fully traceable sustainable palm oil tomorrow |last1=Watson |first1=Emma |url=http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Market/WWF-Industry-should-buy-into-GreenPalm-today-or-it-will-struggle-to-source-fully-traceable-sustainable-palm-oil-tomorrow |newspaper=Food Navigator |date=5 October 2012 |accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the first year of CSPO certification only 30 percent of sustainable oil was marketed as CSPO.&lt;ref name=econ2010/&gt;

In ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2010, the RSPO was criticized for not setting standards for greenhouse-gas emissions for plantations and because its members account for only 40 percent of palm oil production.&lt;ref name=econ2010/&gt; In a 2007 report, [[Greenpeace]] was critical of RSPO-member food companies saying that they are "dependent on suppliers that are actively engaged in deforestation and the conversion of peatlands".&lt;ref name="Greenpeace2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/planet-2/report/2007/11/palm-oil-cooking-the-climate.pdf |title=How the Palm Oil Industry is Cooking the Climate |year=2007 |work=greenpeace.org |publisher=Greenpeace International |accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a contribution of $1 billion from Norway, in May 2010, Indonesia announced a two-year suspension on new agreements to clear natural forests and peatlands. Additionally, Indonesia announced plans to create its own organization similar to the RSPO, which, as a government certification system, will introduce mandatory regulation for all Indonesian palm oil producers.&lt;ref name=econ2010/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillespie"&gt;{{cite news |title=ISPO, RSPO: Two sides of the same coin? |last1=Gillespie |first1=Piers |last2=Harjanthi |first2=Rahayu Siti |url=http://www2.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/11/02/ispo-rspo-two-sides-same-coin.html |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |date=2 November 2012 |accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Malaysia began developing a national certification, the "Malaysia sustainable palm oil" (MSPO) certification, to improve involvement in sustainable palm oil production nationwide.&lt;ref name="Daily Express"&gt;{{cite news |title=Having own palm oil certification hailed |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |url=http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=79183 |newspaper=Daily Express |date=14 September 2011 |accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The certification program, aimed at small and medium-sized producers, is expected to be launched in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestar.com.my/Business/Business-News/2013/09/04/Govt-expected-to-launch-palm-oil-standard-by-next-year.aspx Hanim Adnan.

===Carbon credit programs===
Oil palm producers are eligible to take part in [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM) programs in which developed nations invest in clean energy projects in developing nations to earn carbon credits to offset their own greenhouse gas emissions and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.&lt;ref name="Chiew"&gt;{{cite news |title=Developing countries play role to minimise global warming |last1=Chiew |first1=Hilary |url=http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2008/4/1/lifefocus/20318588&amp;sec=lifefocus |newspaper=The Star |date=1 April 2008 |accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investors have been cautious about investing in palm oil biofuel projects because of the impact the expansion of oil palm plantations has had on tropical rain forests,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asria.org/news/press/1195793283 Carbon market takes sides in palm oil battle] Carbon Finance, 23 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; but according to the South East Asian CDM development company [[YTL Corporation#YTL-SV Carbon|YTL-SV Carbon]], many CDM projects in the palm oil sector focus on improving use of waste products to reduce gas emissions and do not contribute to the establishment of new oil palm plantations.&lt;ref name="Varming"&gt;{{cite news |title=CDM is promoting sustainable palm oil |last1=Varming |first1=Soeren |last2=Dutschke |first2=Michael |url=http://www.ytl-svcarbon.com/news.php?newsID=19 |work=Point Carbon Newsletter: CDM &amp; JI Monitor |date=14 May 2008 |accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of sustainable oil by corporations===

The [[World Wildlife Foundation]] (WWF) publishes an annual report on the use of sustainable palm oil by major corporations. In the 2011 report, 31 of the 132 companies surveyed received a top score for their use of sustainable palm oil. This represents an increase from 2009, the first year the report was issued, where no companies received top scores.&lt;ref name="WWF2011"/&gt;

The WWF reports that 87 companies have committed to using only sustainable palm oil by 2015, including [[Unilever]] and [[Nestlé]], both of which committed to exclusively using sustainable palm oil following demonstrations and urgings from environmental organizations in the late 2000s.&lt;ref name=econ2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=foodnav&gt;
[http://www.foodnavigator.com/news/ng.asp?n=85047-unilever-greenpeace-palm-oil-carbon-emissions-sustainable     Unilever commits to sustainable palm oil] Food Navigator.com 2 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the WWF, the overall growth in the use of sustainable palm oil is too slow.&lt;ref name="WWF2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/footprint/agriculture/palm_oil/solutions/responsible_purchasing/scorecard2011/ |title=2011 Palm Oil Buyers' Scorecard |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2011 |work=wwf.panda.org |publisher=World Wildlife Foundation |accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retailers who have made commitments to offering products containing sustainable oil, including [[Walmart]] and [[Carrefour]], have attributed the slow rate of growth in the availability of sustainable palm oil to a lack of consumer interest and awareness in products made with sustainable palm oil. These companies have expressed concern about the potential impact of low consumer demand on the cost and future availability of sustainable palm oil.&lt;ref name="Watson2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Certified sustainable palm oil derivatives 'prohibitively expensive' in US |last1=Watson |first1=Elaine |last2= |first2= |url=http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Market/Certified-sustainable-palm-oil-derivatives-prohibitively-expensive-in-US |newspaper=Food Navigator |date=21 June 2011 |accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lingga"&gt;{{cite news |title=Consumer response to certified palm oil products still weak |last1=Lingga |first1=Vincent |last2= |first2= |url=http://www2.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/11/01/consumer-response-certified-palm-oil-products-still-weak.html |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |date=1 November 2012 |accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persuading governments===
It may be possible to persuade governments of nations that produce competing products to enact [[Protectionism|protectionist]] legislation against the products of deforestation, an approach that was presented in a report by the [[National Farmers Union (United States)]] and [[Avoided Deforestation Partners]]. The 2010 report estimates that protecting the {{convert|13,000,000|ha|sqmi}} of mostly tropical forest that are lost annually worldwide would boost American agricultural revenue by $190–270 billion between 2012 and 2030. However, several conservation groups, including [[Conservation International]], [[Environmental Defense Fund]], [[National Wildlife Federation]], and [[The Nature Conservancy]], presented a rebuttal to the report, stating that it was "based on the assumption, totally unfounded, that deforestation in tropical countries can be easily interrupted, and its conclusions are therefore also unrealistic."&lt;ref name=econ2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=gardner2010&gt;{{

A '''transgranular fracture''' is a [[fracture]] that follows the edges of [[crystal structure|lattice]]s in a [[granular material]], ignoring the [[grain]]s in the individual lattices.  This results in a fairly smooth looking fracture with less sharp edges than one that follows the changing grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Brittle Fracture|url=http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/MSE2094_NoteBook/97ClassProj/exper/ballard/www/ballard.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130020054/http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/MSE2094_NoteBook/97ClassProj/exper/ballard/www/ballard.html|archivedate=2016-01-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be visualized as several wooden [[jigsaw puzzle]] pieces with the grains showing, but with each piece having grains running in a different direction. A transgranular fracture follows the grains in the wood, not the edges of the puzzle pieces. This is opposed to an [[intergranular fracture]].

'''Transport Energy Futures: Long-Term Oil Supply Trends and Projections''' is a report published by the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, and prepared by the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics (BITRE) of Australia in 2009, which calculate peak oil to occur in 2017, after which oil supply is projected to decline rapidly.&lt;ref name="Energy Bulletin" /&gt; It is report number 117.

==Alleged cover-up==
On 20 January 2012, an article in the Daily Telegraph of Australia reports that a French man had put the report on the internet, while there is no sign of it anywhere on the official webpages of BITRE. The author of the article accuses the government of purposely covering up the report from the public eye, while at the same time postulated that the report was sent to a number of European organisations, reasoning this was an explanation for the report being leaked.&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph" /&gt;

A '''vacuum variable capacitor''' is a [[variable capacitor]] which uses a high [[vacuum]] as the [[dielectric]] instead of [[air]] or other [[electrical insulation|insulating]] material. This allows for a higher [[voltage]] rating than an air dielectric&lt;ref name=AMS/&gt; using a smaller total volume.  However, many dielectrics have higher [[Dielectric strength|breakdown field strengths]] than vacuum: 60-170 MV/m for [[teflon]], 470-670 MV/m for [[fused silica]] and 2000 MV/m for [[diamond]], compared with 20-40 MV/m for vacuum.  There are several different designs in vacuum variables. The most common form is inter-meshed concentric cylinders, which are contained within a glass or ceramic vacuum envelope, similar to an [[Vacuum tube|electron tube]]. A metal [[bellows]] is used to maintain a vacuum seal while allowing positional control for the moving parts of the capacitor.&lt;ref name=SB12&gt;http://www.hatdaw.com/papers/sb_12.pdf Service Bulletin ''Vacuum variable Capacitors'', retrieved 2012 March 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invention==
[[Nikola Tesla]] filed a patent in 1896 for a vacuum capacitor. The original use was to enhance the quality of the electrical components for handling "currents of high frequency and potential". These components were necessary for the DC impulse research which Tesla was studying. Commercial products have been available since 1942.&lt;ref name=AMS&gt;http://www.amstechnologies.com/fileadmin/amsmedia/downloads/4317_jenningscapacitorshighvoltagevacuumandgasfilled.pdf Jennings high voltage vacuum capacitors&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Vacuum variable capacitors are commonly used in high-[[voltage]] applications: 5000 [[volts]] (5 kV) and above. They are used in equipment such as high-powered [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] [[transmitter]]s, [[amateur radio]] [[Valve RF amplifier|RF amplifiers]] and large [[antenna tuner]]s. Industrially they are used in plasma generating equipment, for [[dielectric heating]], and in semiconductor manufacturing.&lt;ref name=AMS/&gt; The main applications today are RF plasmas of 2 to 160&amp;nbsp;MHz where the vacuum capacitor is used as the impedance variation part in an automatic [[matching network]] in the fabrication of chips and flat panel displays.

[[Image:Vacuum capacitor with uranium glass.jpg|thumb|150px|A 12 pF 20 kV fixed vacuum capacitor]]
[[File:Fixed value vacuum capacitor.jpg|150px|right|thumb|A fixed-value vacuum [[capacitor]]]]
Other variations of vacuum capacitors include fixed-value capacitors, which are designed very much like the variable versions with the exception of an adjustment [[Mechanism (technology)|mechanism]].

==Comparison==
When compared to other variable capacitors, vacuum variables tend to be more precise and more stable. This is due to the vacuum itself. Because of the sealed chamber, the dielectric constant remains the same over a wider range of operating conditions. With air [[variable capacitor]]s, the air moving around the plates may change the value slightly; often it is not much but in some applications it is enough to cause undesirable effects.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Vacuum variable capacitors are generally more expensive than air variable capacitors. This is primarily due to their design and the materials used. Although most use [[copper]] and [[glass]], some may use other materials such as [[ceramic]]s and [[metal]]s such as [[gold]] and [[silver]]. Vacuum variables also vary in adjustment mechanisms.

[[File:Eimac 2C39A.jpg|thumb|right|Transmitter tube Eimac 2C39A]]
Most high power transmitter amplifiers are of [[vacuum tube|valve construction]] because of the high power required.

==Anode circuits==
Since valves are designed to operate with much higher resistive loads than [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] devices, the most common anode circuit is a tuned [[LC circuit]] where the [[anode]]s are connected at a [[voltage]] [[Node (circuits)|node]]. This circuit is often known as the anode [[tank circuit]].

==Grid circuits==

===Active (or tuned grid) ===

[[Image:tunedgrid.png|thumb|400px|left|Simple [[tetrode]] based design using a tuned grid input]]

An example of this used at VHF/[[UHF]] include the 4CX250B, an example of a twin [[tetrode]] would be the QQV06/40A. The tetrode has a screen grid which is between the anode and the first grid.  This is grounded at the operating frequency, but carries a DC potential, normally 10 to 50% of the plate voltage. The screen grid  serves to increase the stage gain while also providing shielding which increases the stability of the circuit by reducing the effective capacitance between the first grid and the anode.

For very high gain circuits, the shielding effect of the screen may not be sufficient to prevent all coupling from the plate back to the grid.  Even a small amount of feedback may cause tuning difficulties and perhaps even self oscillation. Coupling of energy from the output back into the input can also occur due to poor circuit layout.  It is therefore often necessary to add a neutralization circuit, which feeds some of the output signal back to the input with proper amplitude and opposite phase so as to cancel out the above-mentioned undesirable effects.

In common with all three basic designs shown here the anode of the valve is connected to a LC circuit needed to tune the plate circuit to [[resonance]].  Power may be coupled to the antenna via an additional inductive link as shown.  More commonly modern circuits use a [[Pi network]] to resonate the plate circuit and match it to the antenna while also reducing harmonics.

===How it works===
For a fixed anode voltage the anode current of a triode can be described by the following equation

'''I&lt;sub&gt;anode&lt;/sub&gt; = {K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.(E&lt;sub&gt;grid&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)} + {K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.(E&lt;sub&gt;grid&lt;/sub&gt;²-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)} + {K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.(E&lt;sub&gt;grid&lt;/sub&gt;³-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}''' etc.

For a tetrode the equation will be:

'''I&lt;sub&gt;anode&lt;/sub&gt; = {K&lt;sub&gt;1grid1&lt;/sub&gt;.(E&lt;sub&gt;grid1&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;1grid1&lt;/sub&gt;)} + {K&lt;sub&gt;2grid1&lt;/sub&gt;.(E&lt;sub&gt;grid1&lt;/sub&gt;²-N&lt;sub&gt;2grid1&lt;/sub&gt;)} + {K&lt;sub&gt;3grid1&lt;/sub&gt;.(E&lt;sub&gt;grid1&lt;/sub&gt;³-N&lt;sub&gt;3grid1&lt;/sub&gt;)} etc. + {K&lt;sub&gt;1grid2&lt;/sub&gt;.(E&lt;sub&gt;grid2&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;1grid2&lt;/sub&gt;)} + {K&lt;sub&gt;2grid2&lt;/sub&gt;.(E&lt;sub&gt;grid2&lt;/sub&gt;²-N&lt;sub&gt;2grid2&lt;/sub&gt;)} + {K&lt;sub&gt;3grid2&lt;/sub&gt;.(E&lt;sub&gt;grid2&lt;/sub&gt;³-N&lt;sub&gt;3grid2&lt;/sub&gt;)} ...''' etc.

Note that the K constants for the second grid are smaller than those of the first grid because the second grid is further away from the [[cathode]].

As the second grid (screen grid) in a tetrode is maintained at a constant potential the equation for the tetrode can be reduced back to that of the triode as long as the screen grid is kept at the same potential.

''In short the anode current is controlled by the electrical potential (voltage) of the first grid.'' A [[Direct current|DC]] bias is applied to the valve to ensure that the part of the transfer equation which is most suitable to the required application is used.

The input signal is able to perturb (change) the potential of the grid, this in turn will change the [[anode]] [[Electric current|current]]. Another term for the anode in a valve is the [[Plate electrode|plate]] so hence on many designs the anode current is named the plate current.

In the [[Radio frequency|RF]] designs shown on this page between the anode and the high voltage supply (known by convention as B+) is a [[tuned circuit]]. This tuned circuit has been brought to resonance, and in a class A design can be thought of as a resistance. This is because a resistive load is coupled to the tuned circuit. In [[sound reproduction|audio]] amplifiers the resistive load ([[loudspeaker]]) is coupled via a transformer to the amplifier. In short the load formed by the loudspeaker driven via the [[transformer]] can be thought of as a [[resistor]] wired between the valves anode and B+.

As the current flowing through the anode connection is controlled by the grid, then the current flowing through the load is also controlled by the grid.

One of the disadvantages of a tuned grid compared to other RF designs is the neutralization is required.

==Passive grid==
[[Image:passivegrid.png|thumb|400px|right| simple [[tetrode]] based design using a passive grid input]]

An example of a passive grid used at VHF/[[UHF]] frequencies include the 4CX250B; an example of a twin tetrode would be the QQV06/40A. The tetrode has a screen grid which is between the anode and the first grid, the purpose of the screen grid is to increase the stability of the circuit by reducing the capacitance between the first grid and the anode. The combination of the effects of the screen grid and the damping resistor often allow the use of this design without neutralization.

The signals come into the circuit through a capacitor, they are then applied to the valve's first grid directly. The value of the grid resistor determines the gain of the amplifier stage. The higher the resistor the greater the gain, the lower the damping effect and the greater the risk of instability. With this type of stage good layout is less vital.

Passive grid design is ideal for audio equipment, because audio equipment must be more [[broadband]] than RF equipment. A RF device might be required to operate over the range 144 to 146&amp;nbsp;MHz (1.4% of an octave) while an audio amp might be required to operate over the range 20&amp;nbsp;Hz to 20&amp;nbsp;kHz, a range of three orders of magnitude.

===Advantages===
*Stable, no neutralizing required normally
*Constant load on the exciting stage

===Disadvantages===
*Low gain, more input power is required
*Less gain than tuned grid
*Less filtering than tuned grid (more broadband), hence the amplification of out of band spurious signals, such as harmonics, from an exciter is greater

==Grounded grid==
[[Image:groundedgrid.png|thumb|400px|left|Simple [[triode]] based design using cathode input]]

This design uses a triode, the grid current drawn in this system is larger than that required for the other two basic designs. Because of this, valves such as the 4CX250B are not suitable for this circuit. This circuit design has been used at 1296&amp;nbsp;MHz using disk seal [[triode]] [[valves]] such as the 2C39A.

The grid is kept at ground, the drive is applied to the cathode through a capacitor. The heater supply must be isolated with great care from the cathode as unlike the other designs the cathode is not connected to RF ground. The cathode may be at the same DC potential as the grid if a valve such as the 811A (zero bias triode) is used, otherwise the cathode must be positive with respect to the grid to provide proper bias.  This may be done by putting a zener diode between the cathode and ground, or by connecting a suitable power supply to the cathode.

===Advantages===
*Stable, no neutralizing required normally
*Some of the power from exciting stage appears in the output

===Disadvantages===
*Very low gain, much more input power is required
*The heater must be isolated from ground with chokes

The '''viscosity index''' ('''VI''') is an arbitrary, unitless measure of the change of [[viscosity]] with temperature, mostly used to characterize the viscosity-temperature behavior of [[lubricant|lubricating oils]]. The lower the VI, the more the viscosity is affected by changes in temperature. The VI was originally measured on a scale from 0 to 100; however, advancements in lubrication science have led to the development of oils with much higher VIs.

The viscosity of a [[lubricant]] is closely related to its ability to reduce [[friction]] in solid body contacts. Generally, the least viscous lubricant which still forces the two moving surfaces apart to achieve "[[fluid bearing]]" conditions is desired. If the [[lubricant]] is too viscous, it will require a large amount of energy to move (as in [[honey]]); if it is too thin, the surfaces will come in contact and friction will increase.

== Relevance ==
Many [[lubricant]] applications require the [[lubricant]] to perform across a wide range of conditions, for example, automotive lubricants are required to reduce [[friction]] between [[engine]] components when the engine is started from cold (relative to the engine's [[operating temperature]]s) up to {{convert|200|°C|0|disp=or}} when it is running. The best oils with the highest VI will remain stable and not vary much in viscosity over the temperature range.  This allows for consistent engine performance within the normal working conditions. Historically, there were two different oil types, recommended for usage in different weather conditions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Oil Viscosity |first=Timothy |last=Zahl |url=https://www.carid.com/articles/what-is-oil-viscosity-and-why-is-it-important-to-me.html |date=4 May 2017 |publisher=CARiD.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For winter use, the engines required motor oil with the viscosity rating 5, while for warm and hot season it had to be changed to oil with 30-40 viscosity rating. Later on, there appeared multi-grade motor oils, which contained polymers that made the oil film thinner at higher temperatures without thickening the oil.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== Classification ==
The VI scale was set up by the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE). The temperatures chosen arbitrarily for reference are {{convert|100|and|210|°F|°C|0}}. The scale was originally interpolated between 0 for a [[naphthenic]] Texas Gulf crude and 100 for a [[alkane|paraffinnic]] Pennsylvania crude.  Since the inception of the scale better oils have also been produced, leading to VIs greater than 100 (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wiki.anton-paar.com/en/viscosity-index/ |title=Viscosity Index |publisher=Anton Parr |location=UK |access-date=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VI improving [[oil additive|additives]] and higher quality base oils are widely used nowadays which increase the VIs attainable beyond the value of 100.  The Viscosity Index of [[synthetic oil]]s ranges from 80 to over 400.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

|}

== Calculation ==
The viscosity index can be calculated using the following formula:{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{VI }= 100 \frac{L-U}{L-H}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''U'' is the oil's kinematic viscosity at {{convert|40|°C|0}}, and ''L'' and ''H'' are values based on the oil's kinematic viscosity at {{convert|100|°C|0}}. ''L'' and ''H'' are the values of viscosity at 40°C for oils of VI 0 and 100 respectively, having the same viscosity at 100°C as the oil whose VI we are trying to determine. These ''L'' and ''H'' values can be found in ASTM D2270.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Engineering Tribology|edition=2nd|first=Gwidon W.|last=Stachowiak|first2=Andrew W.|last2=Batchelor|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Boston|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vox AC30''' is a [[Instrument amplifier|guitar amplifier]] manufactured by [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]]. It was introduced in 1958 to meet the growing demand for louder amplifiers. Characterised by its "jangly" high-end sound it has become widely recognized by British musicians and others.&lt;ref name=tube&gt;{{cite book|last=Pittman|first=Aspen|title=The Tube Amp Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JT1I7Ld76YsC&amp;pg=PA95|year=2003|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=978-0-87930-767-7|pages=95–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Vox AC30 was originally introduced in 1959 at [[Hank Marvin]]'s request as the "big brother" of the fifteen [[watt]] (15 W) AC15 model, Vox's original flagship amplifier, because the AC15 was not loud enough with the screaming fans at [[Cliff Richard]]'s concerts. The AC15 was powered by a pair of [[EL84]] [[Vacuum tube|tubes]], an [[EF86]]-driven "Normal" channel, an [[ECC83]]-driven "Vib-Trem" channel, and rectified by an EZ81. The original first-generation AC30 used a GZ34 tube rectifier, three ECC83s (12AX7) for the Normal channel and the tremolo/vibrato oscillator/modulator circuits, one ECC81 (12AT7) phase inverter, and EL34 tubes in the power amplifier circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintageguitar.com/1927/Vox-AC-30/|work=Vintage Guitar |date=May 1998 |title=Vox AC-30 The First AC-30?|author=John Teagle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This first generation of AC30s were housed in "TV-front" cabinets, much like the early to mid-50s tweed [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] amps, and had a single 12-inch Goodmans 60-watt speaker, as opposed to the later, conventional twin 12-inch speaker configuration. These early amps sported a thin white covering ("Rexine") with a small printed diamond pattern and larger diamond pattern grill cloth. However, the EL34-powered AC30 was short lived, and a new AC30 version appeared in late 1959. This second generation AC30/4 had two channels with two inputs, hence the "4" in the model name, and a single tone control, and was powered by a quartet of EL84 (6BQ5) power tubes, making it truly a doubling of the AC15 power amp circuit. The AC30/4 also carried over the AC15's preamplifier circuit, which included the EF86 pentode in its "Normal" channel. Vox initially offered a 1×12" version but subsequently introduced the 2×12" AC30 Twin, which solved the volume problem at larger venues. The first AC30 Twins used two Goodmans Audiom 60 15-Watt Speakers, followed by [[Celestion]] G12 [[alnico]] speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voxshowroom.com/uk/amp/ac30-4.html |publisher=The Vox Showroom |title=The AC-30/4 Twin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1960, Vox had forsaken the more conservative TV-front look for the now legendary cabinet design that has remained largely unchanged since 1960. The new cabinets featured a different covering known as fawn Rexine, which was a sort of beige leathercloth with a subtle printed grain. The front baffle was now divided by a thin gold-toned strip with the upper valence covered in fawn Rexine, and the lower grille covered in brown diamond cloth. Ventilation was provided by three small brass vents on the top of the cabinet, and the TV-front's single suitcase type handle was replaced with three leather straps.
[[File:EdgeAC30.jpg|thumb|[[The Edge]]'s almost-original Vox AC30/6 from 1964, housed in a '70s cabinet on stage. It is known that it is the 'brilliant' model (or top boost) and it was Edge's earliest amp used to record every [[U2]] album ]]

Since the higher output AC30/4 shared its preamplifier design with the lower powered AC15, Vox discovered the high-gain EF86 tube was susceptible to microphonics, or even failure, when exposed to the increased vibration present in this uprated amp. Vox soon tired of the problem so to cure AC30/4 reliability issues caused by the troublesome EF86 preamp tube,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voxshowroom.com/uk/amp/ac30_6_hood.html |publisher=The Vox Showroom |title=JMI Vox AC-30/6 Normal, Treble and Bass Models 1960–1967 A Detailed Look "Under the Hood"}}&lt;/ref&gt; in late 1960 Vox redesigned the preamp circuit, replaced the EF86 with an ECC83 (12AX7), and released this new design as the AC30/6. The AC30/6 was now an amp with three channels, each channel having two inputs.

About this time, the "Top Boost" (or "Brilliance") feature became available as Vox's optional addition of a rear panel-mounted [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] that introduced an extra gain stage and tone controls for bass and treble (as opposed to the single "tone" control of earlier AC30s). The unit became so popular that its features were soon incorporated in newer AC30/6 models, and the controls moved from the rear panel to the control panel. Vox AC30/6 amplifiers from around 1963 had already implemented the top boost, and therefore had three tone controls. People began to refer to these amplifiers as AC30TBs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/vintage325/topboost.html|title=Vox AC30 Topboost - Reasons &amp; Origins A?|author=Glen Lambert|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/vintage325/topboost.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+23:58:56|archivedate=2009-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, Vox also offered additional versions of the AC30 unit. In addition to the "Normal" version without the Top Boost, and the Top Boost version (which was a Normal version with the "Brilliance" unit added), Vox, with slight circuit modifications, created two more versions that were "voiced" in Brilliant (Treble), and Bass styles. Over the years many different AC30 models appeared but many consider the AC30 "Super Twin" to be the ultimate AC30, with a "trapezoid" shaped head and a separate speaker mounted on a trolley (see ''The Vox Story'', Petersen &amp; Denney 1993, p.39; see also the Vox showroom web site).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voxshowroom.com/uk/amp/ac30srt.html|title=The VOX Showroom - The Vox AC-30/6 Super Reverb Twin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late '60s Jennings drifted into financial problems and the company experienced various owner changes. Quality control was also inconsistent.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

During the Vox brand's early '70s "[[Dallas Arbiter]]" period, the tube rectifiers of AC30s were replaced by [[silicon]] rectifiers, which became standard on later AC30TB models. In the late 1970s Vox also introduced a [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] AC30 (AC30SS), which is the AC30 model that was used by [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]]. A tube AC30TB with spring reverb feature was reintroduced in 1978.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In spite of at least one AC30 production run titled "Limited Edition" of 100 units with starting serial number 0100 (1991) (no reverb), production of the AC30 has practically never ceased: Newer AC30s are reissues of the various top boost AC30/6 (AC30TB) models. AC30s made between 1989 and 1993 also had spring reverb as a standard feature.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The Rose Morris company, who owned the Vox name through the 1980s, sold Vox to [[Korg]] in the early 1990s, who then manufactured a reissue of the early '60s AC30 Top Boost, correcting previous inconsistencies ranging from the correct style grille cloth to the GZ34 rectifier tube. These AC30 amps were mostly offered in the traditional black Tolex/brown diamond grille configuration, but were also available in limited numbers with purple, red, or tan tolex. These amplifiers, like all AC30s to this point, were manufactured in [[Great Britain]]. These were available with a choice of [[Celestion]] "Blue" or "Greenback" speakers. In the mid 1980s, a company in Marlborough, MA, called Primo, imported and began re-distributing the AC30s in the U.S.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===AC30HW Limited (2003)===
In 2003, Vox created the "AC30 Heritage Handwired Limited Edition" amplifier (AC30HW). This amplifier differed from the standard offering in notable ways. First, the circuitry was constructed using old-fashioned tag strips. According to Vox this was far more labor-intensive, but it allowed for easier repair versus circuit boards because there were no copper tracks to burn. According to the Vox showroom site:

"1960s era Vox amps were hand wired on tag strips. The connecting lead (or wire) from each electronic part was manually wrapped around a terminal, or "tag," and then soldered. This mode of amp construction is very labour-intensive and the workmanship and accuracy of the employee building the amp will affect the performance of the product. It was for this reason that most electronics manufacturers transitioned to phenolic printed circuit boards by 1970."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hahlbeck|first=Gary|title=Vox AC30HW and AC30HWH/CV212LTD Hand Wired Amp Series - Made in the UK|url=http://www.voxshowroom.com/uk/amp/ac30hw.html|publisher=North Coast Music|accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second notable difference was the features and control layout. Guitar Player magazine reviewed the amp in its "Exotica" feature, December 2002. The article specifies details of the amp, including price, and its control layout:

"The AC30 HW ($4,000; head $3,250; 2×12 cab $1,350), which was developed with input from boutique amp designer Tony Bruno, features the famous Top Boost preamp, but has a control that is quite different from the standard model. For starters, there are only two inputs, which are marked Hi and Lo (AC30s traditionally have six inputs). To the right are the volume, treble, bass and tone-cut controls, a tremolo section with speed and depth knobs, a reverb section with reverb and tone controls, and a master volume." [And further into the article:] Top of the Marque. The AC30HW is by far the best AC variant to date. Few amps come close to matching its radiant complexity and those that do typically don't offer reverb and tremolo. The only downer about the HW is that only 350 of them will be made (along with 200 heads and cabinets)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Art|title=Exotica Vox AC30HW|journal=Guitar Player|date=December 2002|volume=36|issue=396|pages=141–142|url=http://guitarplayer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AC30 Custom Classic Series===
In 2004, Vox introduced a new series of amplifier called the '''AC30 Custom Classic'''. It claims to combine attributes of the original AC30 with what Vox sales literature refers to as a "boutique" of features. Specifications of the AC30CC series are two Inputs (Top Boost and Normal), an Input Link Switch for blending channels, a Normal Volume knob, a Brilliance Switch, a Top Boost Volume knob, a Treble knob, an EQ Standard/Custom Switch, Bass and Reverb Controls (Tone, Mix, and a Dwell Switch), Tremolo Speed &amp; Depth knobs, a Tone Cut knob, a Master Volume knob, a Standby and a Power Switch, switchable cathode bias (Output Bias switch: "50 Hot": 33W at full power, "82 Warm": 22W at low power), switchable filter values (vintage/modern), and a true bypass effects loop. Newer AC30CC (or "Custom Classic") reissues (CC1, CC2X CCH head) are produced in [[China]].

===AC30 Custom Series===
At the 2010 Winter NAMM expo Vox introduced the Custom series; these models were updates to the 2004 Custom Classic series amplifiers and featured two channels (Normal and Top Boost) with two inputs for each channel (High and Low), more akin to the original AC30/4 layout released in 1958. It was available with either Greenback speakers (C2) or Alnico Blue Speakers (C2x), and was also available as the AC15. Later limited edition models include the AC30BL, a tygoon blue tolex with grey speaker cloth, an AC30C2RD with a red finish, an AC30C2-BRG a British Racing Green tolex finish with a grey speaker cloth and the AC30C2 Black Comet; featuring a patterned finish all are identical to the C2. The amp featured an option known as "Jumping" where the High-Normal channel could be linked to the Low-Top Boost channel with a patch lead, whilst the guitar is plugged into the High-Top Boost channel, allowing both channels to sound and create a fuller, thicker overdrive sound. The amp also featured a solid-state rectifier to increase reliability. Controls include a Normal volume, Top Boost Volume, Treble and Bass controls, Reverb Tone and Level controls, Tremolo Speed and Depth controls, a Tone Cut control (to add further control over the higher-frequencies), a Master Volume, and a Standby and Power Switch. A true bypass effects loop, extension cab output and external cab output were also included; as well as an input for the external foot switch (to control Reverb and Tremolo). The amps are produced in China. The amps were released to critical success, garnering awards such as Music Radar's "Guitarist Choice" award. {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===AC30 Handwired (2007)===
Introduced in 2010, the amp featured Hand-wired turret board construction (against cheaper PCB construction), Birch-ply cabinets featuring solid bracing and a natural high frequency diffuser (versus MDF cabinets and no high frequency diffuser); All-tube design (different from the Custom series tube pre/power amp but solid-state rectifier); ECC83/12AX7 preamp tubes (×3) EL84 power tube quartet; (AC30 models); EL84 Duet (AC15 models); GZ34 rectifier (AC30 models); EZ81 rectifier (AC15 models); came factory-fitted with matched Ruby Tubes to provide extended dynamic range; maintained the traditional VOX two-channel design (Top Boost and Normal. High and Low inputs for each channel); the Normal channel features an additional BRIGHT switch; The top boost channel features a HOT/COOL switch to achieve even more gain. A Master Volume/BYPASS switch completely bypasses the Master Volume section allowing incredible levels of gain and sustain to be achieved. OP mode switch cut the amp's Output Power level in half (30 &gt; 15 on the AC30, 15 &gt; 7.5 on the AC15) allowing higher levels of saturation to be achieved at lower volumes. A Vintage fawn-colored vinyl covering, reminiscent of the 1960 classic AC30 and was available with either Celestion Alnico Blue or Celestion G12M Greenback speakers. A VFS1 footswitch controls the Top Boost channel's HOT/COOL switch was also included.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} The Heritage series 50th anniversary models incorporate the classic EF86 pre-amp tube, which although subject to failure in the late '50s had been re-introduced and improved. The classic EF86 pre-amp tube is remarkable for its high gain and for the notable harmonic overtones it produces and feeds to the power tubes when driven into distortion, providing the creamy distinctive VOX sound of the early hand made amplifiers produced by Jennings of Dartford. Clapton, Cream, Pink Floyd and Queen are ambassadors to the success of the early AC30s. The Heritage series 50th anniversary model stands alone as either the AC15 or AC30 with this distinct circuitry not found in the current VOX line-up.

===AC30BM===
Recently, Vox released a limited edition version of the amp, the '''AC30BM''', based on the tone of one of the amp's most prominent and consistent endorsers, [[Brian May]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. The amp is limited to only a few hundred examples worldwide, in a 'never-to-be-repeated' run. As the amp is designed to replicate May's tone, there are no controls on the amp except for a single volume control, though a switch enables the user to halve the number of output valves (therefore reducing the output to 15 watts as well as the volume, making it more suitable for home use), and there is a boost function operated from the included footswitch.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===JMI returns===
As of 2006, a company having licensed the name JMI ([[Jennings Musical Instruments]]) began manufacturing period correct, British made AC30 "copy" amplifiers, available in both black and beige. Since this incarnation of JMI has never owned the Vox brand, their official website lists the disclaimer "JMI amplification are in no way affiliated with Vox amplification (Korg)", and the models are listed as 30/6 (6 input) and 30/4 (4 inputs, sans "Brilliant" channel). As originally the case in the 1960s, Top Boost is offered as a retrofit upgrade and is not standard, and the original configuration 4/6 inputs are offered with options for Green/Blue speakers, the blue speakers being similar in appearance to the Celestion alnico speaker but made by Fane International with fiberglass voice coils, which allow them a much higher 100 watt power rating. JMI later changed alnico speakers to ones made by Tayden.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===AC30VR===
Another recent addition is the VOX AC30VR (Valve Reactor). According to the [http://www.voxamps.com/us/ Vox website], this version of the AC30 includes both "solid-state" and "tube" technology. Originally designed for the Valvetronix modelling amplifiers, the Valve Reactor circuit places a 12AX7 dual triode vacuum tube (or "valve") into the power stage, which is a tube configured to act as a small power amplifier. Too small to be used as an amplifier on its own, the output of this Valve Reactor circuit is fed to a solid state power amp that boosts the output signal.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Electronics==
Though widely believed to be a [[Power amplifier classes#Class A|class A amplifier]], the AC30 is in fact [[Power amplifier classes#Class AB|class AB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aikenamps.com/index.php/is-the-vox-ac-30-really-class-a|work=Aiken Amps technical pages|title=Is the Vox AC-30 Really Class A?|author=Randall Aiken}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tone-lizard.com/vox-myths |work=Tales from the Tone Lounge|title=Vox AC30 Myths|author=Randy Jamz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheldonamps.com/amptalk/myths.html|title=Class Distinction|author=Mark Breecher &amp; Shane Dolman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It uses a quartet of [[Cathode bias|cathode-biased]] EL-84 output tubes in [[Push-pull output|push-pull]] configuration.  The high bias condition is believed by some to be the source of the amplifier's famous immediate response and "jangly" high-end, though the lack of negative feedback, minimal preamp circuit, simple low loss [[tone stack]], and the use of cathode biasing on the output stage play at least as large a role, if not larger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevesamps.co.uk/wp/?page_id=287|work=Steve's Amps blog pages|title=Voxiness: What makes the Vox AC30 sound that way?|author=Steve Rowse}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Celestion "Blue" speakers that are integral to the AC30 also contribute much to the sound of the unit.  The two 12" 15-watt speakers, often overdriven and at the brink of their power handling capability, provide a cutting mid-range speaker sound that is immediate and sharp and a distinction from the [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] or [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]-style amplifier.

'''Water gas''' is a mixture of [[carbon monoxide]] and [[hydrogen]] produced from [[Syngas|synthesis gas]].  Synthesis gas is a useful product, but requires careful handling due to its flammability and the risk of [[carbon monoxide poisoning]]. The [[water-gas shift reaction]] can be used to reduce the carbon monoxide while producing additional hydrogen, resulting in water gas.

==Production==
Synthesis gas is made by passing [[steam]] over a red-hot carbon fuel such as [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]:
:&lt;chem&gt;{H2O} + C -&gt; {H2} + CO \ (\Delta H = +131 kJ/mol)&lt;/chem&gt;

The reaction is [[Endothermic process|endothermic]], so the fuel must be continually re-heated to keep the reaction going.  In order to do this, an air stream, which alternates with the vapor stream, is introduced for the combustion of carbon to take place.
:&lt;chem&gt;O2 + C -&gt; CO2 \ (\Delta H = -393 kJ/mol)&lt;/chem&gt;
Theoretically, to make 6&amp;nbsp;L of water gas, 5&amp;nbsp;L of air is required.

Or, alternatively, to prevent contamination with nitrogen, energy can be provided by using pure oxygen to burn carbon into carbon monoxide.
:&lt;chem&gt;O2 + 2 C -&gt; 2 CO \ (\Delta H = -221 kJ/mol)&lt;/chem&gt;
In this case 1&amp;nbsp;L of oxygen will create 5.3&amp;nbsp;L of pure water gas.

==History==
The [[water-gas shift reaction]] was discovered by Italian physicist [[Felice Fontana]] in 1780.

Water gas was made in England from 1828 by blowing steam through white-hot coke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Technology|editor-first=Charles|editor-last=Singer|displayeditors=etal|publisher=Clarendon Press|date=1954–1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lowe's gas process===
In 1873, [[Thaddeus S. C. Lowe]] developed and patented the water gas process by which large amounts of [[hydrogen]] gas could be generated for residential and commercial use in heating and lighting. This gas provided a more efficient heating fuel than the common [[coal gas]], or coke gas, which was used in municipal service. The process used the water-gas shift reaction:

:&lt;chem&gt;CO + H2O -&gt; CO2 + H2&lt;/chem&gt;

The process was discovered by passing high-pressure steam over hot [[coal]], the major source of coke gas. Lowe's process improved upon the chimney systems by which the coal could remain superheated, thereby maintaining a consistently high supply of the gas. The reaction produced carbon dioxide and hydrogen, which, after a process of cooling and "[[scrubber|scrubbing]]", produced hydrogen gas.

The process spurred on the industry of gas manufacturing, and [[gasification]] plants were established quickly along the Eastern seaboard of the United States. Similar processes, like the [[Haber process|Haber–Bosch process]], led to the manufacture of [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) by the combining of [[nitrogen]], found in [[air]], with hydrogen. This spurred on the [[refrigeration]] industry, which long used ammonia as its [[refrigerant]]. Prof. Lowe also held several patents on artificial ice making machines and was able to run successful businesses in cold storage, as well as products which operated on hydrogen gas.

==Variations==
===Carburetted water gas===
Water gas has a lower [[heat of combustion]] than [[coal gas]], so the [[calorific value]] was often boosted by passing the gas through a heated [[retort]], into which oil was sprayed.  The resulting mixed gas was called ''carburetted water gas''.

===Semi-water gas===
''Semi-water gas'' is a mixture of water gas and [[producer gas]] made by passing a mixture of air and steam through heated coke.  The heat generated when producer gas is formed keeps the temperature of the coke high enough to allow water gas to be formed.

===Water gas shift reaction===
Pure hydrogen can be obtained from water gas by using the water-gas shift reaction, after subsequent removal of the carbon dioxide formed when carbon monoxide reacts with water.

== Uses ==
* Used to remove carbon monoxide from fuel cell applications
* Used in [[Fischer–Tropsch process]]
* Reaction with producer gas to produce [[fuel gas]]
* Used to gain pure hydrogen for synthesis of ammonia

The '''Yuzivska gas field''' is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[natural gas field]] that was discovered in 2010. It will begin production in 2017 and will produce [[natural gas]] and [[Natural gas condensate|condensates]]. The total [[proven reserves]] of the Yuzivska gas field are around 70.8 trillion cubic feet (2000×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;m³) and production is slated to be around 960 million cubic feet/day (27.4×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;m³). The total exploration investment is expected to range between 250-300 million US$. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/16/ukraine-gas-shale-idUSL5E8GGAJY20120516|title=Ukraine sees 2017 for commercial shale gas output|date=2012|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-fracking-shale-gas-russia/24881720.html|title=Kyiv Turns To 'Unconventional' Natural Gas To Wean Itself From Gazprom|date=2013|publisher=rferl.org|accessdate=2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This model admits finite-rate chemical reactions and thus the process of detonation consists of the following stages. First, an [[infinitesimal]]ly thin shock wave compresses the explosive to a high pressure called the '''von Neumann spike'''. At the von Neumann spike point the explosive still remains unreacted. The spike marks the onset of the zone of exothermic chemical reaction, which finishes at the [[Chapman-Jouguet state]]. After that, the detonation products expand backward.

In the reference frame in which the shock is stationary, the flow following the shock is [[Speed of sound|subsonic]].  Because of this, energy release behind the shock is able to be transported acoustically to the shock for its support.  For a self-propagating detonation, the shock relaxes to a speed given by the [[Chapman–Jouguet condition]], which induces the material at the end of the reaction zone to have a locally sonic speed in the reference frame in which the shock is stationary.  In effect, all of the chemical energy is harnessed to propagate the shock wave forward.

However, in the 1960s, experiments revealed that gas-phase detonations were most often characterized by unsteady, three-dimensional structures, which can only in an averaged sense be predicted by one-dimensional steady theories. Indeed, such waves are quenched as their structure is destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Edwards, D.H. |author2=Thomas, G.O. |author3=Nettleton, M.A. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Diffraction of a Planar Detonation Wave at an Abrupt Area Change|journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics|volume= 95|issue=1|pages =79–96|year= 1979|doi=10.1017/S002211207900135X|bibcode = 1979JFM....95...79E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2514/5.9781600865497.0341.0357 |volume=75 |journal=Progress in Astronautics &amp; Aeronautics|year=1981|title=Diffraction of a Planar Detonation in Various Fuel-Oxygen Mixtures at an Area Change|isbn=978-0-915928-46-0|pages=341|editors=A.
