'''Advaita Ashrama''', Mayavati, is a branch of the [[Ramakrishna Math]], founded on 19 March 1899 at the behest of [[Vivekananda]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advaitaashrama.org/mayavati.html Mayavati – History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223084847/http://www.advaitaashrama.org/mayavati.html |date=23 December 2008 }} ''Advaita Ashrama''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tele"&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1030520/asp/calcutta/story_1984013.asp founded by Vivekananda in 1899.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526024042/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1030520/asp/calcutta/story_1984013.asp |date=26 May 2011 }} ''[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]], 20 May 2003.''&lt;/ref&gt; by his disciples James Henry Sevier, and [[Charlotte Sevier]].

== History ==
[[File:Cenotaph of Vivekananda.jpg|thumb|The cenotaph of Vivekananda in Advita Ashrama]]

The Advaita Ashram has its origins in 1896, when Vivekananda was travelling through the [[Alps]] recuperating, and expressed the desire to have a similar place in India, for retreat and study of Vedas.&lt;ref name=out&gt;[http://traveller.outlookindia.com/fulltravelogue.aspx?id=212 Mayabati:  A journey towards Self – Dr. Subhendu Chakravrati on a spiritual journey to Mayavati] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715023612/http://traveller.outlookindia.com/fulltravelogue.aspx?id=212 |date=15 July 2011 }} ''[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier, in 1895, James Henry Sevier&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 9/Letters – Fifth Series/CLXVIII Mother|James Henry Sevier]] The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 9/Letters – Fifth Series/CLXVIII Mother – ''[[wikisource]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; who had served as a captain in the [[British Indian Army]] for five years, and his wife Charlotte Elizabeth Sevier, met Vivekananda in England. Later in 1896, for nearly nine months, they travelled with him through Switzerland, Germany, and Italy. It was in the [[Alps]] that Vivekananda, while travelling with the couple that he expressed his desire to have a similar retreat for the monks in the Himalayas. In December 1896, the couple moved to India, with Vivekananda on board a steamer from [[Naples]], Italy, with an objective to find a place near Almora, and set up an Ashram,&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 5/Epistles – First Series/LXXI Alasinga|The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 5/Epistles – First Series/LXXI Alasinga]] Letter of Swami Vivekananda, 11 November 1896.'' [[wikisource]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and arriving at Madras in February 1897.&lt;ref name=mad&gt;[[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 5/Interviews/The Missionary Work of the First Hindu Sannyasin to the West And His Plan Of Regeneration Of India|The Missionary Work of the First Hindu Sannyasin to the West And His Plan Of Regeneration Of India]] Madras Times, February 1897.  ''[[wikisource]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Soon just as Vivekananda left for Calcutta, the couple left for Almora, where they rented a bungalow&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 8/Epistles – Fourth Series/CXXVIII Rakhal|Letter 20 May 1898]] The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 8/Epistles – Fourth Series/CXXVIII Rakhal – ''[[wikisource]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and this became the residence of Vivekananda and the Seviers for next two years.

[[File:Advaita Ashrama, Mayavati, a branch of the Ramakrishna Math, founded on March 19, 1899.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Advaita Ashrama, Mayavati, a branch of the [[Ramakrishna Math]], founded on 19 March 1899.]]
Later when he left for Kashmir, the Sevier couple along with Swami Swarupananda, a monastic disciple of Vivekananda, started travelling to the interior area looking a suitable place, which was eventually found in July 1898, set amidst dense [[Cedrus deodara|deodar]], pine and oak forests; the land which was until then a tea estate was promptly purchased, and decided upon for the new Ashram. Finally, with the help of [[Swami Swarupananda]], the Ashram was set up,&lt;ref name=maya&gt;[http://www.advaitaashrama.org/others/mayavati_route.pdf Mayawati Route – Visitors Booklet of Advaita Ashrama] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121190710/http://www.advaitaashrama.org/others/mayavati_route.pdf |date=21 November 2008 }} ''Advaita Ashrama''.&lt;/ref&gt; along with a small dwelling for the monks, ashramites and the couple themselves, around the same time as the [[Belur Math]] was being established near [[Kolkata]], when they moved in on 19 March 1899, which happened to be the birth anniversary of [[Ramakrishna]] ([[Hindu calendar]]) that year.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of the Swami Vivekananda, by His Eastern and Western Disciples, the Advaita Ashrama, Himalayas'', by Advaita Ashrama, Published by the [[Swami Virajananda]] from the Prabuddha Bharata Office, Advaita Ashrama, 1947. ''Page 341''.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the sudden death of its first editor, 24-year-old B. R. Rajam Iyer at [[Chennai]], the publication of the English Journal ''[[Prabuddha Bharata]]'' was discontinued for a few months in May 1898. Meanwhile, in [[Almora]], Vivekananda asked the Sevier couple to revive the magazine, and the editorship was given to [[Swami Swarupananda]], who not only became the first head of the Ashram upon its opening on 19 March 1899,&lt;ref&gt;The Vedanta Kesari, by Sri Ramakrishna Math (Madras, India). Published by Sri Ramakrishna Math., 1979. ''Page 212'' – Swami Swarupananda by Swami Raghaveshananda.&lt;/ref&gt; but also remained its editor, at its new base hence forth; and the held the position until his death in 1906.&lt;ref name=char /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advaitaashrama.org/prabuddha_bharata.html Prabuddha Bharata] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120094054/http://advaitaashrama.org/prabuddha_bharata.html |date=20 January 2009 }} ''Advaita Ashrama'' website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbg/sbg01.htm Srimad-Bhagavad-Gita, English translation and commentary by Swami Swarupananda, 1909] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223150550/http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbg/sbg01.htm |date=23 December 2008 }} at ''sacred-texts.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon its foundation, Vivekananda sent the following letter, in March 1899, entailing the prospectus of the Ashram:

"...To give this One Truth a freer and fuller scope in elevating the lives of individuals and leavening the mass of mankind, we start this Advaita Ashrama on the Himalayan heights, the land of its first expiration.

Here it is hoped to keep Advaita free from all superstitions and weakening contaminations. Here will be taught and practised nothing but the Doctrine of Unity, pure and simple; and though in entire sympathy with all other systems, this Ashrama is dedicated to Advaita and Advaita alone."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_5/writings_prose_and_poems/the_advaita_ashrama_himalayas.htm the Advaita Ashrama, Mayavati, Almora, Himalayas] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104193400/http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_5/writings_prose_and_poems/the_advaita_ashrama_himalayas.htm |date=4 January 2011 }} ''Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda''.&lt;/ref&gt;

James Sevier died on 28 October 1900, and was cremated by the nearby [[Sarada River]], according to Hindu traditions as he had wished.&lt;ref name=out /&gt;&lt;ref name=char&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/mag/2006/12/24/stories/2006122400300700.htm Serene heights] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516231013/http://www.hindu.com/mag/2006/12/24/stories/2006122400300700.htm |date=16 May 2008 }} ''[[The Hindu]]'', 24 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Vivekananda visited the Ashram from 3–18 January 1901, primarily to console her,&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 6/Epistles – Second Series/CLXVII Joe|Letter 26 December 1900]] The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 6/Epistles – Second Series/CLXVII Joe – ''[[wikisource]]''. "Dear Mr. Sevier passed away before I could arrive. He was cremated on the banks of the river that flows by his Ashrama, à la Hindu, covered with garlands, the Brahmins carrying the body and boys chanting the Vedas.".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 5/Epistles – First Series/XCIV Mother|Letter 6 January 1901]] The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 5/Epistles – First Series/XCIV Mother – ''[[wikisource]]''."Mrs. Sevier is a strong woman, and has borne her loss quietly and bravely. She is coming over to England in April, and I am going over with her."&lt;/ref&gt; and his place of residence has now been turned into a library.&lt;ref name=maya /&gt; Charlotte Sevier continued to stay at the Ashram for several years.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;{{canon law}}
An '''apostolic administrator''' in the [[Catholic Church]] is a [[prelate]] appointed by the [[Pope]] to serve as the [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] for an '''apostolic administration'''. An apostolic administration can either be an area that is not yet a [[diocese]] (a stable 'pre-diocesan', usually missionary apostolic administration) or for a [[diocese]], eparchy or similar permanent ordinariate (such a [[territorial prelature]] or a [[territorial abbacy]]) that either has no [[bishop]] (an apostolic administrator ''[[sede vacante]]'', as after an episcopal death or resignation) or, in very rare cases, has an incapacitated bishop (apostolic administrator ''sede plena'').

== Characteristics ==
Apostolic administrators of stable administrations are equivalent in [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] with [[diocesan bishop]]s, meaning they have essentially the same authority as a diocesan bishop. This type of apostolic administrator is usually the bishop of a [[titular see]].

Administrators ''sede vacante'' or ''sede plena'' only serve in their role until a newly chosen diocesan bishop takes possession of the diocese. They are restricted by canon law in what they can do to the diocese they temporarily administer. For example, such an administrator may not sell [[real estate]] owned by the diocese. This type of administrator is commonly an [[auxiliary bishop]] of the diocese, a priest serving as the [[vicar general]] of the diocese, or the [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] of a neighboring diocese.

Normally when a diocese falls vacant, either the previously appointed [[Coadjutor bishop]] takes possession of the see or (lacking such successor) a [[vicar capitular]]/diocesan administrator is chosen locally, but the Pope, having full governmental power, can preempt this choice and name an apostolic administrator instead. Sometimes a retiring, promoted or transferred (arch)bishop is designated to be apostolic administrator until his successor is designated and takes office, sometimes the Metropolitan or a fellow suffragan is appointed.

== Apostolic administrations==
In May 2015, there were the following stable apostolic administrations, most administered by a (titular or external) bishop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/data/typeapad.htm Apostolic Administrations]  ''GCatholic.org''. Accessed 2014-07-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most are of the Roman rite; most are in former or current [[communist]] countries.

Some apostolic administrations have jurisdiction not only over Latin Rite Catholics, but also over Catholics of other rites, not having their own jurisdictions there:

=== Diocese of Pyongyang ===
The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pyongyang|Diocese of Pyongyang]], [[North Korea]]: its last official bishop, [[Francis Hong Yong-ho]], was [[prisoner of conscience|imprisoned]] by the [[communist state|communist regime]] of [[Kim Il-sung]] in 1949 and later [[forced disappearance|disappeared]]. The Metropolitan [[Archbishop of Seoul]] (South Korea) acts as the Apostolic Administrator in [[Pyongyang]], as religion is suppressed in North Korea.

== Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney==
In addition, the [[Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney]] is a non-territorial jurisdiction, similar to a [[personal prelature]], which is exempt, i.e. immediately subject to the Holy See, not part of any ecclesiastical province. It is a separate [[particular church]] for [[traditionalist Catholic]]s within the Brazilian [[Diocese of Campos (Brazil)|Diocese of Campos]], a suffragan of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Niterói|Metropolitan Archdiocese of Niterói]].

The personal apostolic administration was formed by Pope John Paul II to administer to a group of traditionalist Catholic priests, using the [[Tridentine Mass]], who reconciled with Rome on January 18, 2002. The group had been formed by bishop [[Antônio de Castro Mayer]] and had been associated with the [[Society of St. Pius X]] of Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/data/typepapd.htm Personal Apostolic Administrations] ''GGatholic.com''.

== Temporary administration of vacant sees ==
It has become not unusual that the Pope appoints an Apostolic Administrator to a diocese which is [[sede vacante]], thus replacing the [[diocesan administrator]]. Usually, the emeritus bishop will be appointed in such a case. Recently (and in exception to the latter), the archdiocese [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh|St. Andrews and Edinburgh]] had [[Philip Tartaglia]] under this procedure.

The '''Bahá'í Faith in the United Arab Emirates''' began before the country gained independence in 1971.  The first [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] arrived in [[Dubai]] by 1950,&lt;ref name="info"&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/handscause_statistics_1953-63&amp;chapter=1#22  The Bahá'í Faith: 1844-1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Bahá'í Teaching &amp; Consolidation Plan 1953-1963], Compiled by [[Hands of the Cause]] Residing in the Holy Land, pages 4, 25, 28, 118.&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1957 there were four Bahá'í [[Spiritual Assembly|Local Spiritual Assemblies]] in the region of the [[United Arab Emirates]] and a regional National Spiritual Assembly of the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;ref name="info"/&gt; Recent estimates count some 75,000 Bahá'ís or 1.6% of the national population - second only to [[Iran]] in number of Bahá'ís in the nations of the Middle East&lt;ref name="tore"&gt;{{Cite book

By 1950 Bahá'ís had arrived in Dubai,&lt;ref name="info"/&gt; and by 1957 there were Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assemblies in Dubai, [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Ras Al Khaymah]], and [[Sharjah (emirate)|Sharjah]],  and a regional Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly of the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;ref name="info"/&gt; This regional national assembly was re-organized for the Southern and Eastern Arabia in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the 1980s, many anti-Bahá'í [[polemics]] were published in local newspapers of the UAE.&lt;ref name="MacEoin"&gt;{{cite web | last = MacEoin | first = Denis |author2=William Collins | title = Anti-Baha'i Polemics | work = The Babi and Baha'i Religions: An Annotated Bibliography | publisher = Greenwood Press's ongoing series of Bibliographies and Indexes in Religious Studies | url = http://bahai-library.com/books/biblio/antibahai.polemic.html | accessdate = 2008-04-12|pages = entries #1, 5, 26, 29, 108, 116, 122, 151, 204, 219, 227, 238, 272, 289, 330 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080515215132/http://bahai-library.com/books/biblio/antibahai.polemic.html| archivedate= 15 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception the religion has had involvement in [[Socio-economic development (Bahá'í)|socio-economic development]] beginning by giving greater freedom to women,&lt;ref name="iranhistory"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Momen  | first = Moojan | authorlink= Moojan Momen  | title = History of the Baha'i Faith in Iran  | work = draft "A Short Encyclopedia of the Baha'i Faith"  | publisher = Bahai-library.com  | date =   | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_iran#9.%20Social%20and%20economic%20development  | format =   | doi =   | accessdate = 2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kingdon  | first = Geeta Gandhi | title  = Education of women and socio-economic development | journal = Baha'i Studies Review | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | year = 1997 | url =http://bahai-library.com/kingdon_education_women_development }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics.&lt;ref name="iranhistory"/&gt; The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the [[Universal House of Justice]] dated 20 October 1983 was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Baha'i Faith 1957–1988: A Survey of Contemporary Developments | first = Moojan | last = Momen| authorlink= Moojan Momen |author2=Smith, Peter | year = 1989 |  url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_smith_developments_1957-1988 |volume = 19 | journal = Religion | pages=63–91 |doi= 10.1016/0048-721X(89)90077-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the [[Bahá'í teachings]], in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. However the current situation of the Bahá'ís in the UAE, while being better than the situation of the Bahá'ís in [[Iran]], (see [[Persecution of Bahá'ís]]) is mixed. Many consider the Bahá'ís [[kafir]] ([[infidel]]s), and they lack many basic rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Census figures count Bahá'ís as [[Muslim]] and since many Bahá'ís had passports that identify them as Muslims, the Ministry of Education required Bahá'í children to take the prescribed Islamic studies classes.&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{Cite web |title=United Arab Emirates: International Religious Freedom Report 2007 |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90223.htm |publisher=[[United States Department of State]]: [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] |date=2007-09-14 |accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, 15 percent of the UAE are not Muslim, Christian, or Jewish. Unofficial sources noted by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] assert that one-third of these are collectively Bahá'í, [[Parsi people|Parsi]], or [[Sikh]]. These estimates differ from census figures because census figures do not count "temporary" visitors and workers, and Bahá'ís are counted as Muslim.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; By some other estimates there were 55,000 Bahá'ís (1.95% of the national population) as of 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Recently, Bahá'ís have been generally able to practise their religion in the country; in 1999 a touring group of youth, a ''Bahá'í Workshop'' (see [[Oscar DeGruy]]), with members from many countries including the UAE had performed in India and other places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

However, as of 2005, the country's long-term [[Internet service provider]] at the time, [[Etisalat]], 
blocked some of the most visible websites related to the Bahá'í Faith. The blocking did not extend to most material concerning the Bahá'í Faith on the internet however.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document

'''Cake of Light''' is the [[eucharist]]ic host found within [[Thelema]], the religion founded by author and [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]] in 1904. It contains honey, oil, and particular bodily fluids, and is usually cooked in the shape of a small, flat wafer. It appears by name in two important Thelemic rituals: the [[Gnostic Mass]] and the [[Mass of the Phoenix]]. However, Crowley thought it was important for [[Magick (Aleister Crowley)|magicians]] to perform a eucharistic ritual of some kind daily (from ''[[Magick (Book 4)|Magick Book 4, Liber ABA]]'', ch. 20): 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A Eucharist of some sort should most assuredly be consummated daily by every magician, and he should regard it as the main sustenance of his magical life. It is of more importance than any other magical ceremony, because it is a complete circle. The whole of the force expended is completely re-absorbed; yet the virtue is that vast gain represented by the abyss between Man and God.

The magician becomes filled with God, fed upon God, intoxicated with God. Little by little his body will become purified by the internal lustration of God; day by day his mortal frame, shedding its earthly elements, will become in very truth the Temple of the Holy Ghost. Day by day matter is replaced by Spirit, the human by the divine; ultimately the change will be complete; God manifest in flesh will be his name.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Symbolism==

The overall significance of the cakes is that it is considered to be a eucharist, a symbolic union between the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], Man, and the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|macrocosm]], the Divine; and the consumption of which completes a sacred circle, affirming an intimate connection between the two, which strengthens with each sacrament.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

The Cakes of Light, traditionally composed of meal, honey, leavings of red wine [[Lees (fermentation)|lees]], [[Abramelin oil|oil of Abramelin]], olive oil and fresh blood as per the instructions in ''[[The Book of the Law]]'' is a perfume or incense when raw but also a cake when baked ("burned")&lt;ref name="Liber Al"&gt; [[The Book of the Law]]: Chapter 3, verses 23-25[http://www.invisiblehouse.org/pdf/liber220.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Olive_oil#Religious_use|Olive oil]] is considered a sacred oil by many cultures and religions of the world. It is also an ingredient in the making of Oil of Abramelin, and the olive noted by [[Aleister Crowley]] himself as "traditionally, the gift of Minerva, the Wisdom of God, the Logos.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

Abramelin Oil was considered by Crowley to be representative of the "whole [[Tree of Life]]. The ten [[Sephirot|Sephiroth]] are blended into the perfect gold." Abramelin Oil is thus also a symbol of the [[Philosopher's Stone]] of the [[Alchemy|Alchemists]].{{cn|date=April 2013}}

==Cakes of Light in ''The Book of the Law''==

Cakes of Light are never mentioned by name in ''The Book of the Law'', however many people interpret the following passages as being instructions for their creation (from III:23-25):

:For perfume mix meal &amp; honey &amp; thick leavings of red wine: then [[oil of Abramelin]] and olive oil, and afterward soften &amp; smooth down with rich fresh blood. 

:The best blood is of the moon, monthly: then the fresh blood of a child, or dropping from the host of heaven: then of enemies; then of the priest or of the worshippers: last of some beast, no matter what. 

:This burn: of this make cakes &amp; eat unto me. This hath also another use; let it be laid before me, and kept thick with perfumes of your [[Orison (spirituality)|orison]]: it shall become full of beetles as it were and creeping things sacred unto me. 

Some commentators have interpreted this to mean that the  "blood" component mentioned in the second portion of this quote may be formed from [[menstrual blood]] or [[semen]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aleister Crowley|Crowley, Aleister]].

There are two '''Catilli''' in [[Roman mythology|Roman legend]]:

* '''Catillus the Arcadian''', son of [[Amphiaraus]].
* '''Catillus''', his son.

Catillus the Arcadian and his sons Catillus, Coras, and Tiburtus  escaped the mass killing at [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and arrived at the [[Aniene]] Plateau. They drove away the [[Sicily|Sicilians]] who lived there and founded a city named [[Tivoli, Italy|Tibur]] (now Tivoli) in honor of Tiburtus.

In Book VII of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', the twin brothers, Catillus and Coras, leave [[Tivoli, Italy|Tibur]] and head for [[Latium]] to fight against [[Aeneas]] and the [[Troy|Trojans]] as an ally of [[Turnus]].

'''Criticism of Christianity''' has a long history stretching back to the initial formation of the religion during the [[Roman Empire]]. Critics have attacked Christian beliefs and teachings as well as Christian actions, from the [[Crusades]] to [[Christian terrorism|modern terrorism]]. The intellectual arguments against Christianity include the suppositions that it is a faith of violence, corruption, superstition, polytheism, and bigotry.

In the [[history of Christianity|early years of Christianity]], the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] emerged as one of the major critics with his book ''Against the Christians''. Porphyry argued that Christianity was based on false prophecies that had not yet materialized.&lt;ref&gt;[[Le Roy Froom]], ''Prophetic Faith of Our Fathers '', Vol. I, Washington D.C. Review &amp; Herald 1946, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the adoption of [[Christianity]] under the Roman Empire, dissenting religious voices were gradually suppressed by both governments and ecclesiastical authorities.{{sfn|Martin|1991|p=3–4}} A millennium later, the [[Protestant Reformation]] led to a fundamental split in European Christianity and rekindled critical voices about the Christian faith, both internally and externally. With the [[Scientific Revolution]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], Christianity experienced additional attacks from major thinkers and philosophers, such as [[Voltaire]], [[David Hume]], [[Thomas Paine]], and the [[Baron d'Holbach]].{{sfn|Martin|1991|p=4}} The central theme of these critiques sought to negate the historical accuracy of the Christian Bible and focused on the perceived corruption of Christian religious authorities.{{sfn|Martin|1991|p=4}} Other thinkers, like [[Immanuel Kant]], launched the first systematic and comprehensive assaults against [[Christian theology]] by attempting to refute [[Existence of God|arguments for theism]].&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Critique of Pure Reason'', pp. 553–69&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, Christianity has faced substantial criticism from a wide array of political movements and ideologies. In the late eighteenth century, the [[French Revolution]] saw a number of politicians and philosophers criticizing traditional Christian doctrines, precipitating a wave of secularism in which hundreds of churches were closed down and thousands of priests were deported.&lt;ref&gt;Robert R. Palmer and Joel Colton, ''A History of the Modern World'' (New York: McGraw Hill, 1995), pp. 388–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the French Revolution, prominent philosophers of [[liberalism]] and [[communism]], such as [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Karl Marx]], criticized Christian doctrine on the grounds that it was conservative and anti-democratic.[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] wrote that Christianity fostered a kind of slave morality that suppressed the desires contained in the human will.&lt;ref&gt;Robert R. Palmer and Joel Colton, ''A History of the Modern World'' (New York: McGraw Hill, 1995), p.630.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Chinese Revolution]], and several other modern revolutionary movements have also led to the criticism of Christian ideas.

The formal response of Christians to such criticisms is described as [[Christian apologetics]]. Philosophers like [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] have been some of the most prominent defenders of the Christian religion since its foundation.

===Biblical criticism===
{{See also|Biblical criticism}}

Biblical criticism, in particular higher criticism, covers a variety of methods used since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in the early 18th century as scholars began to apply to biblical documents the same methods and perspectives which had already been applied to other literary and philosophical texts.&lt;ref&gt;Browning, W.R.F. "[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O94-biblicalcriticism.html Biblical criticism.]" ''A Dictionary of the Bible.'' 1997 ''Encyclopedia.com.'' 8 Apr. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It is an umbrella term covering various techniques used mainly by mainline and liberal Christian theologians to study the meaning of biblical passages. It uses general historical principles, and is based primarily on reason rather than revelation or faith. There are four primary types of biblical criticism:&lt;ref name="RobinsonCriticism"&gt;Robinson, B.A. ''[http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_hcri.htm Biblical Criticism, including Form Criticism, Tradition Criticism, Higher Criticism, etc.]'' Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance, 2008. Web: 8 Apr 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Form criticism:'' an analysis of literary documents, particularly the Bible, to discover earlier oral traditions (stories, legends, myths, etc.) upon which they were based.
* ''Tradition criticism:'' an analysis of the Bible, concentrating on how religious traditions grew and changed over the time span during which the text was written.
* ''Higher criticism:'' the study of the sources and literary methods employed by the biblical authors.&lt;ref name=RobinsonCriticism /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mather"&gt;Mather, G.A. &amp; L.A. Nichols, ''Dictionary of Cults, Sects, Religions and the Occult,'' Zondervan (1993) (quoted in Robinson, ''Biblical Criticism''&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Lower criticism:'' the discipline and study of the actual wording of the Bible; a quest for textual purity and understanding.&lt;ref name="Mather" /&gt;

====Textual criticism====
{{See also|Textual criticism}}
Within the abundance of biblical manuscripts exist a number of textual variants. The vast majority of these textual variants are the inconsequential misspelling of words, word order variations&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Metzger]], cited in ''The Case for Christ'', Lee Strobel&lt;/ref&gt; and the mistranscription of abbreviations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ehrman |first=Bart D. |authorlink=Bart D.

Ehrman]] have proposed that some of these textual variants and interpolations were theologically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman, Bart D. ''The Orthodox Corruption of Scripture''. New York: Oxford U. Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrman's conclusions and textual variant choices have been challenged by some conservative evangelical reviewers, including [[Daniel B. Wallace]], [[Craig Blomberg]], and Thomas Howe.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Daniel B. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3817/is_200606/ai_n17176283/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 "The Gospel According to Bart: A Review Article of Misquoting Jesus by Bart Ehrman,"] ''[[Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society]]'', June 2006 (also available at [http://www.bible.org/page.php?page_id=4000 Bible.org])

In attempting to determine the original text of the New Testament books, some modern textual critics have identified sections as probably not original. In modern translations of the Bible, the results of textual criticism have led to certain verses being left out or marked as not original. These possible later additions include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Ehrman, Bart D. |title=Whose Word Is It? |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8264-9129-9}} p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Metzger1994"&gt;[[Bruce Metzger]] "A Textual Commentary on the New Testament", Second Edition, 1994, German Bible Society&lt;/ref&gt;

* The ending of [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]]{{Bibleref2c|Mk.|16}}
* The story in [[Gospel of John|John]] of the woman taken in adultery, the [[Pericope Adulterae]]
* An explicit reference to the [[Trinity]] in [[1 John]], the [[Johannine Comma]]

In ''The Text Of The New Testament'', [[Kurt Aland|Kurt]] and [[Barbara Aland]] compare the total number of variant-free verses, and the number of variants per page (excluding [[orthography|orthographic]] errors), among the seven major editions of the Greek NT ([[Constantin von Tischendorf#Works|Tischendorf]], [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott-Hort]], [[Hermann, Freiherr von Soden|von Soden]], Vogels, Merk, Bover and [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestle-Aland]]) concluding 62.9%, or 4999/7947, agreement.&lt;ref name="Aland"&gt;K. Aland and B. Aland, "''The Text Of The New Testament: An Introduction To The Critical Editions &amp; To The Theory &amp; Practice Of Modern Text Criticism''", 1995, op. cit., p. 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded, "Thus in nearly two-thirds of the New Testament text, the seven editions of the Greek New Testament which we have reviewed are in complete accord, with no differences other than in orthographical details (e.g., the spelling of names, etc.). Verses in which any one of the seven editions differs by a single word are not counted. This result is quite amazing, demonstrating a far greater agreement among the Greek texts of the New Testament during the past century than [[textual criticism|textual scholars]] would have suspected… In the [[Gospels]], [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] the agreement is less, while in the [[Epistles|letters]] it is much greater."&lt;ref name="Aland" /&gt;

With the discovery of the Hebrew Bible texts among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], questions have been raised about the textual accuracy of the [[Masoretic text]]. That is, whether the Masoretic text which forms the basis of the Protestant [[Old Testament]], or other translations such as the [[Septuagint]], [[Syriac Peshitta]], and [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] are more accurate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

{{See also|The Bible and History|Internal consistency and the Bible}}

Inconsistencies have been pointed out by critics and skeptics,&lt;ref&gt;See for example the [http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/contra/by_name.html list of alleged contradictions] from ''The Skeptic's Annotated Bible'' and [[Robert G. Ingersoll]]'s article [http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/robert_ingersoll/inspiration_of_bible.html ''Inspiration Of Bible''].&lt;/ref&gt; presenting as difficulties the different numbers and names for the same feature and different sequences for what is supposed to be the same event. Responses to these criticisms include the modern [[documentary hypothesis]], [[two-source hypothesis]] (in various guises), and assertions that the [[Pastoral Epistles]] are pseudonymous. Contrasting with these critical stances are positions supported by traditionalists, considering the texts to be consistent, with the [[Torah]] written by a single source,&lt;ref name="Phelan"&gt;M.W.J. Phelan. ''The Inspiration of the Pentateuch'', Two-edged Sword Publications (March 9, 2005) {{ISBN|978-0-9547205-6-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald D. Witherup, ''Biblical Fundamentalism: What Every Catholic Should Know'', Liturgical Press (2001), page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; but the Gospels by four independent witnesses,&lt;ref name="France2"&gt;France, R.T., [[Tyndale New Testament Commentaries]]: Matthew, Inter-Varsity Press, Leicester, England (1985), pg. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and all of the Pauline Epistles, except possibly the [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]], as having been written by [[Paul the Apostle]].

While consideration of the context is necessary when studying the Bible, some find the accounts of the [[Resurrection of Jesus]] within the four Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, difficult to reconcile. [[E. P. Sanders]] concludes that the inconsistencies make the possibility of a deliberate fraud unlikely: "A plot to foster belief in the Resurrection would probably have resulted in a more consistent story. Instead, there seems to have been a competition: 'I saw him,' 'So did I,' 'The women saw him first,' 'No, I did; they didn't see him at all,' and so on."&lt;ref&gt;Britannica Encyclopedia, ''Jesus Christ'', p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harold Lindsell]] points out that it is a "gross distortion" to state that people who believe in [[biblical inerrancy]] suppose every statement made in the Bible is true (opposed to accurate).&lt;ref name="Lindsell"&gt;[[Harold Lindsell|Lindsell, Harold]]. "The Battle for the Bible", Zondervan Publishing House, Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA (1976), pg. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; He indicates there are expressly false statements in the Bible which are reported accurately&lt;ref name="Lindsell" /&gt; (for example, Satan is a liar whose lies are accurately reported as to what he actually said).&lt;ref name="Lindsell" /&gt; Proponents of biblical inerrancy generally do not teach that the Bible was dictated directly by God, but that God used the "distinctive personalities and literary styles of the writers" of scripture and that [[Biblical inspiration|God's inspiration]] guided them to flawlessly project his message through their own language and personality.&lt;ref name="Chicago"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/chicago1.html|title=Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Art. VIII}}

Those who believe in the [[Biblical inspiration|inspiration]] of scripture teach that it is [[biblical infallibility|infallible]] (or inerrant), that is, free from error in the truths it expresses by its character as the word of God.&lt;ref&gt;As in {{Bibleref2|2Timothy|3:16|9;31|2 Timothy 3:16}}, discussed by {{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the scope of what this encompasses is disputed, as the term includes 'faith and practice' positions, with some denominations holding that the historical or scientific details, which may be irrelevant to matters of faith and Christian practice, may contain errors.&lt;ref name="inerrancy"&gt;{{citation |authors=Norman L. Geisler, William E. Nix |title=From God To Us Revised and Expanded: How We Got Our Bible |publisher=Moody Publishers |year=2012 |isbn=978-0802483928 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2sP5Ws0yj48C&amp;pg=PT45#v=snippet&amp;q=%22historical%20or%20scientific%20errors%22&amp;f=false |page=PT45}} "[https://books.google.com/books?id=2sP5Ws0yj48C&amp;pg=PT98#v=onepage&amp;q=%22faith%20and%20practice%22&amp;f=false faith and practice]"&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars take stronger views,&lt;ref&gt;See notably Grudem, representative of recent scholarship with this emphasis ({{Cite book|last=Grudem|first=Wayne|year=1994|title=Systematic Theology|publisher=Inter-Varsity Press|location=Nottingham|isbn=978-0-85110-652-6|pages=90–105}}).&lt;/ref&gt; but for a few verses these positions require more exegetical work, leading to dispute (compare the serious debate over the related issue of ''[[clarity of scripture|perspicuity]]'', attracting biblical and philosophical discussion).

Infallibility refers to the original texts of the Bible, and all mainstream scholars acknowledge the potential for human error in transmission and translation; yet, through use [[textual criticism]] modern (critical) copies are considered to "faithfully represent the original",&lt;ref name="Chicago" /&gt;{{rp|Art. X}} and our understanding of the original language sufficiently well for accurate translation. The opposing view is that there is too much corruption, or translation too difficult, to agree with modern texts.

===Unfulfilled prophecy===
{{see also|Unfulfilled Christian religious predictions}}

[[File:Abrahamthreeangels.jpg|thumb|right|God reveals himself to [[Abraham]] in scripture and he is seen here with three angels. By [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]].]]

Hundreds of years before the time of Jesus, Jewish prophets promised that a [[Jewish Messiah|messiah]] would come. [[Judaism]] claims that Jesus did not fulfill these prophecies. Other skeptics usually claim that the prophecies are either vague or unfulfilled,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/farrell_till/prophecy.html |title=Prophecies: Imaginary and Unfulfilled |accessdate=2007-01-16 |last=Till |first=Farrell |authorlink=Farrell Till |year=1991 |publisher=[[Internet Infidels]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; or that the Old Testament writings influenced the composition of New Testament narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=W.

Is it probable that this text exerted no significant influence upon Jesus' understanding of the plan of God to save the nations that the prophet Isaiah sets forth?" &amp;mdash;Two questions addressed in a conference on "Isaiah 53 and Christian Origins" at Baylor University in the fall of 1995, the principal papers of which are available in "Jesus and the Suffering Servant.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologists]] claim that Jesus fulfilled these [[Bible prophecy|prophecies]], which they argue are nearly impossible to fulfill by chance.&lt;ref&gt;Peter W. Stoner, ''Science Speaks'', Moody Pr, 1958, {{ISBN|0-8024-7630-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Christians anticipate the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus, when he will fulfill the rest of [[Messianic prophecy]], such as the [[Last Judgment]], the [[resurrection of the dead|general resurrection]], establishment of the [[Kingdom of God]], and the [[Messianic Age]] (see the article on [[Preterism]] for contrasting Christian views).

The [[New Testament]] traces Jesus' line to that of David; however, according to [[Stephen L. Harris]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Stephen L. |authorlink=Stephen L. Harris |title=Understanding the Bible |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=13MbAQAAMAAJ |edition=6 |accessdate=2 August 2013 |year=2002 |publisher=McGraw-Hill College |location= |isbn=9780767429160 |pages=376–377}} (Further snippets of quote: [https://books.google.com/books?id=13MbAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22deliver+the+covenant+people%22 B] [https://books.google.com/books?id=13MbAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22very+political+powers%22 C] [https://books.google.com/books?id=13MbAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22did+not+foresee%22 D])&lt;/ref&gt;

: Jesus did not accomplish what Israel's prophets said the Messiah was commissioned to do: He did not deliver the covenant people from their Gentile enemies, reassemble those scattered in the Diaspora, restore the Davidic kingdom, or establish universal peace (cf. {{bibleref2|Isaiah.9:6-7;11:7-12:16||9|Isa. 9:6–7; 11:7–12:16}}, etc.). Instead of freeing Jews from oppressors and thereby fulfilling God's ancient promises—for land, nationhood, kingship, and blessing—Jesus died a "shameful" death, defeated by the very political powers the Messiah was prophesied to overcome. Indeed, the Hebrew prophets did not foresee that Israel's savior would be executed as a common criminal by Gentiles, making Jesus' crucifixion a "stumbling block" to scripturally literate Jews. ({{Bibleref2|1Cor|1:23|niv|1 Cor.1:23}})

Christian preachers counter this argument by stating that these prophecies will be fulfilled by Jesus in the [[Millennialism|Millennial Reign]] after the [[Great Tribulation]], according to [[New Testament]] prophecies, especially in the [[Book of Revelation]].

The 16th-century [[Judaism|Jewish]] theologian [[Isaac b. Abraham of Troki|Isaac ben Abraham]], who lived in [[Trakai|Trakai, Lithuania]], penned a work called ''Chizzuk Emunah'' (''Faith Strengthened'') that attempted to refute the ideas that [[Jesus]] was the [[Messiah]] prophesied in the [[Old Testament]] and that Christianity was the "[[New Covenant]]" of [[God]]. He systematically identified a number of inconsistencies in the [[New Testament]], contradictions between the New Testament and the [[Old Testament]], and Old Testament prophesies which remained unfulfilled in Jesus' lifetime. In addition, he questioned a number of Christian practices, such as [[Sunday Sabbath]].&lt;ref name="trokibio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faithstrengthened.org/FS_Biography.html |title=Biography of Isaac ben Abraham of Troki |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929141601/http://www.faithstrengthened.org/FS_Biography.html |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Written originally for [[Jews]] to persuade them not to convert to [[Christianity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torahlab.org/store/index.php?act=viewProd&amp;productId=475|title=TorahLab - Store|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the work was eventually read by Christians. While the well-known Christian Hebraist [[Johann Christoph Wagenseil]] attempted an elaborate refutation of Abraham's arguments, Wagenseil's [[Latin]] translation of it only increased interest in the work and inspired later Christian [[freethinkers]]. ''Chizzuk Emunah'' was praised as a masterpiece by [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref name="trokibio" /&gt;

On the other hand, [[Blaise Pascal]] believed that "[t]he prophecies are the strongest proof of Jesus Christ". He wrote that Jesus was foretold, and that the prophecies came from a succession of people over a span of four thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Pascal | first = Blaise | authorlink = | title = Pensees |others=Translator W.

He says that even the timing of the [[Messiah]] in years and in relation to events is predicted, and that the Jewish [[Talmud]] (not accepting Jesus as the Messiah, see also [[Rejection of Jesus]]) laments that the Messiah had not appeared despite the scepter being taken away from Judah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = McDowell | first = Josh | authorlink =Josh McDowell | chapter = chapter 8 | title = The New Evidence that Demands a Verdict | publisher =Thomas Nelson | year =1999 | location = | chapter-url =https://books.google.com/books/about/The_New_Evidence_that_Demands_a_Verdict.html?id=65qYPwAACAAJ | isbn =9781850785521 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prophecy of the Nazarene====
Another example is [[Nazarene (title)|Nazarene]] in {{bibleref2|Matthew|2:23|9}}: "And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was &lt;u&gt;spoken&lt;/u&gt; by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene." The website for [[Jews for Judaism]] claims that "Since a Nazarene is a resident of the city of Nazareth and this city did not exist during the time period of the Jewish Bible, it is impossible to find this quotation in the Hebrew Scriptures. It was fabricated."&lt;ref name="jfj"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewsforjudaism.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/handbook_english.1.pdf|title=English Handbook Page 34 999KB|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://www.messiahtruth.com/notchristian.html "Given the New Testament a Chance?"] from the Messiah Truth website&lt;/ref&gt; However, one common suggestion is that the New Testament verse is based on a passage relating to ''[[Nazirite]]s'', either because this was a misunderstanding common at the time, or through deliberate re-reading of the term by the early Christians. Another suggestion is "that Matthew was playing on the similarity of the Hebrew word ''nezer'' (translated 'Branch' or 'shoot' in {{bibleref2|Isaiah|11:1}} and {{bibleref2|Jeremiah|23:5}}) with the Greek ''nazoraios,'' here translated 'Nazarene.'"&lt;ref name="Sper 1997"&gt;David Sper, Managing Editor, [http://www.livingvinechurch.org/ds/q1208/q1208.html "Questions Skeptics Ask About Messianic Prophecies,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120155247/http://www.livingvinechurch.org/ds/q1208/q1208.html |date=2008-11-20 }} RBC Ministries, Grand Rapids, MI, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Christians also suggest that by using an indirect quotation and the plural term prophets, "Matthew was only saying that by living in Nazareth, Jesus was fulfilling the many Old Testament prophecies that He would be despised and rejected."&lt;ref&gt;See {{bibleref2|Ps|22:6-8 || Psalms 22:6-8}},{{bibleref2-nb|Ps|22:13}}; {{bibleref2-nb|Ps|69:8}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Ps|69:20-21}}; {{bibleref2|Isaiah|11:1}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Isaiah|49:7}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Isaiah|53:2-3}},{{bibleref2-nb|Isaiah|53:8}}; {{bibleref2|Daniel|9:26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The background for this is illustrated by Philip's initial response in {{bibleref2|John|1:46}} to the idea that Jesus might be the Messiah: "Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?"&lt;ref name="Sper 1997" /&gt;

=== Virgin Birth and descent of Jesus ===
{{See also|Almah|Virgin birth of Jesus|Isaiah 7:14}}

A fundamental principle of the Christian faith is that Jesus was born of Mary, a virgin.{{sfn|Martin|1991|p=10-12 &amp; 105}} Both Matthew and Luke trace the genealogy of Joseph back to David. According to Jewish tradition, the Messiah must be a descendant of David, but if Jesus was born of a virgin, he cannot be a descendant of David through Joseph.{{sfn|Martin|1991|p=111}}  Michael Martin asserts that Mary's virginity is a later addition to Christianity as indicated through Paul's letters.{{sfn|Martin|1991|p=112}}  Further, Martin notes that early Christian communities did not seem to have widely believed in the virgin birth. The confusion surrounding the virginity of Mary may result from [[Septuagint]] translation of both {{lang-he|עַלְמָה|almah}} "young girl" and {{lang-he|בְּתוּלָה|bethulah}}, "virgin" into {{lang-el|παρθένος|parthenos}}, which usually means virgin. Relying on this translation, Matthew tried to show that Jesus's virgin birth was foretold in Isaiah 7:14-- which refers to an ''almah'' in Hebrew. {{sfn|Martin|1991|p=121}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreignword.com/Tools/dictsrch_aff.asp?menu=N&amp;query=parthenos&amp;src=CQ&amp;go=Translate&amp;trg=BP The NAS New Testament Greek Lexicon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ODCC"&gt;Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article ''Virgin Birth of Christ''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selective interpretation===
{{Main|Christian views on the Old Covenant}}
{{See also|Cafeteria Christianity}}

Critics argue that the selective invocation of portions of the Old Testament is hypocritical, particularly when those portions endorse hostility towards women and homosexuals, when other portions are considered obsolete. The entire Mosaic Law is described in {{bibleref2|Galatians|3:24-25}} as a tutor which is no longer necessary, according to some interpretations, see also [[Antinomianism#Antinomianism in the New Testament|Antinomianism in the New Testament]].

On the other hand, many of the [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|Old Testament laws are seen as specifically abrogated]] by the [[New Testament]], such as [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]],&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the [[Council of Jerusalem]] described in {{bibleref2|Acts|15}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this may simply be a parallel to Jewish [[Noahide Laws]]. See also [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism]]. On the other hand, other passages are pro-Law, such as Romans 3:31: "Do we then make void the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we establish the law." See also [[Antinomianism#Pauline passages opposing antinomianism|Pauline passages opposing antinomianism]].

===Mistranslation===
{{See also|Bible errata|Bible translations|English translations of the Bible}}

Translation has given rise to a number of issues, as the original languages are often quite different in grammar as well as word meaning. While the [[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy]]&lt;ref name="Chicago" /&gt; states that [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]] applies only to the original [[language]]s, some believers trust their own translation to be the accurate one. One such group of believers is known as the [[King-James-Only Movement]]. For readability, clarity, or other reasons, translators may choose different wording or sentence structure, and some translations may choose to paraphrase passages. Because some of the words in the original language have ambiguous or difficult to translate meanings, debates over the correct interpretation occur.

Criticisms are also sometimes raised because of inconsistencies arising between different English translations of the Hebrew or Greek text. Some Christian interpretations are criticized for reflecting specific doctrinal bias&lt;ref name="jfj" /&gt; or a variant reading between the Masoretic Hebrew and Septuagint Greek manuscripts often quoted in the New Testament.

==Criticism of historical behavior==
Certain interpretations of some moral decisions in the Bible are considered [[ethics|ethically]] questionable by many modern groups.{{who|date=September 2018}} Some of the passages most commonly criticized include [[Christianity and colonialism|colonialism]], the [[Women in Christianity|subjugation of women]], [[religious intolerance]], [[Christianity and homosexuality|condemnation of homosexuality]], and [[Christianity and slavery|support for the institution of slavery]] in both Old and New Testaments.

===Colonialism===
{{main|Christianity and colonialism}}

[[Christianity and colonialism]] are often closely associated because Catholicism and Protestantism were the religions of the European colonial powers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Colonialism: an international, social, cultural, and political encyclopedia, Volume 1 |page=496 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2003 |quote=Of all religions, Christianity has been most associated with colonialism because several of its forms (Catholicism and Protestantism) were the religions of the European powers engaged in colonial enterprise on a global scale. |author=Melvin E. Page, Penny M. Sonnenburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; and acted in many ways as the "religious arm" of those powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Steven |last=Bevans |title=Christian Complicity in Colonialism/ Globalism |url=http://www.secondenlightenment.org/Christian%20Complicity.pdf |accessdate=2010-11-17 |quote=The modern missionary era was in many ways the ‘religious arm’ of colonialism, whether Portuguese and Spanish colonialism in the sixteenth Century, or British, French, German, Belgian or American colonialism in the nineteenth. This was not all bad — oftentimes missionaries were heroic defenders of the rights of indigenous peoples}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Christian missionaries were portrayed as "visible saints, exemplars of ideal piety in a sea of persistent savagery". However, by the time the colonial era drew to a close in the last half of the twentieth century, missionaries became viewed as “ideological shock troops for colonial invasion whose zealotry blinded them.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Edward |last=Andrews |journal=Journal of Church &amp; State |title=Christian Missions and Colonial Empires Reconsidered: A Black Evangelist in West Africa, 1766–1816 |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=663–691 |year=2010 |doi=10.1093/jcs/csp090 |url=http://jcs.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2010/03/04/jcs.csp090 |quote=Historians have traditionally looked at Christian missionaries in one of two ways. The first church historians to catalogue missionary history provided hagiographic descriptions of their trials, successes, and sometimes even martyrdom. Missionaries were thus visible saints, exemplars of ideal piety in a sea of persistent savagery. However, by the middle of the twentieth century, an era marked by civil rights movements, anti-colonialism, and growing secularization, missionaries were viewed quite differently. Instead of godly martyrs, historians now described missionaries as arrogant and rapacious imperialists. Christianity became not a saving grace but a monolithic and aggressive force that missionaries imposed upon defiant natives. Indeed, missionaries were now understood as important agents in the ever-expanding nation-state, or “ideological shock troops for colonial invasion whose zealotry blinded them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity is targeted by critics of colonialism because the tenets of the religion were used to justify the actions of the colonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jake |last=Meador |title=Cosmetic Christianity and the Problem of Colonialism – Responding to Brian McLaren |url=http://notesfromasmallplace.wordpress.com/2010/09/17/cosmetic-christianity-and-the-problem-of-colonialism-responding-to-brian-mclaren/ |accessdate=17 November 2010 |quote=According to Jake Meador, "some Christians have tried to make sense of post-colonial Christianity by renouncing practically everything about the Christianity of the colonizers. They reason that if the colonialists’ understanding of Christianity could be used to justify rape, murder, theft, and empire then their understanding of Christianity is completely wrong.|date=2010-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Michael Wood asserts that the indigenous peoples were not considered to be human beings and that the colonisers were shaped by "centuries of Ethnocentrism, and Christian monotheism, which espoused one truth, one time and version of reality."&lt;ref&gt;Conquistadors, Michael Wood, p. 20, BBC Publications, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slavery===
{{Main|Christianity and slavery}}
[[File:Purchase of Christian captives from the Barbary States.jpg|thumb|300px|Catholic monks redeeming christian slaves from North African slaveholders. 17th c.]]
[[Early Christianity|Early Christian]] perspectives of slavery were formed in the contexts of [[Jewish Christianity|Christianity's roots in Judaism]], and as part of the wider culture of the [[Roman Empire]]. Both the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s recognize that the institution of slavery existed.

[[Saint Paul]] the Apostle in addressing slavery in Ephesians 6:-8{{bibleref2c|Eph.|6:5-8}} neither condemns slavery nor condones it. Nothing in the passage affirms slavery as a naturally valid or divinely mandated institution.  Rather, Paul’s discussion of the duties of Christian slaves and the responsibilities of Christian masters transforms the institution, even if it falls short of calling for outright abolition. St. Augustine thought slavery was a result of sin, but was part of the fallen world and so should be tolerated. However, others opposed it: John Chrysostom explicitly argued that slavery itself was a sin, but he did not advocate for its abolition; Origen called for the practice of [[Manumission|manumission]] after six years as found in the Old Testament; others, such as Gregory of Nyssa, Acacius of Amida, and St. Patrick, called for the complete abolition of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Sunshine, “Christianity and Slavery,” in True Reason: Confronting the Irrationality of the New Atheism, ed. Tom Gilson and Carson Weitnauer (Grand Rapids, MI: Kregel Publications, 2013), 292–293.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, others claim that Orthodox Christianity justified slavery on the ground that it was part of the divinely ordained hierarchical order. Not only there are passages in the Bible enjoining slaves to be submissive (Paul to Ephessians: "''slaves, obey your masters with fear and trembling, in singleness of heart, as you obey Christ; not only while being watched, and in order to please them, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.'' and to Collosians "''Slaves, obey your earthly masters [kyrioi] according to the flesh in everything, not only while being watched and in order to please them, but wholeheartedly, fearing the Lord [kyrios]''"){{sfn|Glancy|2002|p=141-145}} but more to that, St. John Chrysostom wrote ''"The slave should be resigned to his lot, in obeying his master he is obeying God"'' while St. Augustine wrote: ''"...slavery is now penal in character and planned by that law which commands the preservation of the natural order and forbids disturbance"''.{{sfn|Ellerbe|1995|p=90-92 }} 

According to one view, today and from a human rights perspective, it is difficult to understand why early Christians did not object to the social institution of slavery. It is uncertain whether one can go so far as to criticise Early Christians, including Paul and other authors of Biblical texts, for their active or passive acceptance of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1015-87582016000200005 P.G. Kirchschlaeger, "Slavery and Early Christianity - A reflection from a human rights perspective", ''Acta theologica''. vol.36  suppl.23 Bloemfontein  2016, paragraph 4.3. http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/actat.v23i1s.4]&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[Jennifer Glancy]], sexual exploitation of slaves in Roman Empire, was helped by Christian morality. Jesus urged his followers to act like slaves, implementing a [[Master–slave morality|slave morality]].  The early Christian theologians were unconcerned about slave morals.&lt;ref name="Brandeis University"&gt;{{cite web | title=Habits of Slavery in Early Christianity | website=Brandeis University | url=https://www.brandeis.edu/projects/fse/conferences/beyond-slavery/videos/jennifer-glancy.html | language=br | access-date=September 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine), a shift in the view of slavery is noticed, which by the 10th century transformed gradually a slave-object into a slave-subject.&lt;ref&gt;Youval Rotman, "Byzantine Slavery and the Mediterranean World", transl. by Jane Marie Todd, Cambridge, Massachusetts – London, Harvard University Press 2009. Book presentation in a) [http://www.mediterraneanchronicle.org/datafiles/file/MC1_294.pdf Nikolaos Linardos (University of Athens), , ''Mediterranean Chronicle'' 1 (2011)  pp. 281, 282], b) [https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article/115/5/1513/42872 Alice Rio, ''American Historical Review'', Vol. 115, Issue 5, 2010, pp. 1513–1514]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Middle Ages, the Christian understanding of slavery has been subjected to significant internal conflict and has endured dramatic change. Nearly all Christian leaders before the late 17th century recognised slavery, within specific biblical limitations, as consistent with Christian [[theology]]. The key verse used to justify slavery was Genesis 9:25-27: "Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers. He also said, 'Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem!

The "''[[Curse of Ham]]''" along with Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians, VI, 5-7 helped American slaveowners to balance their beliefs with slavery. There are plenty other pro-slavery verses in the Old Testament that were often quoted.

[[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] wrote her famous book, ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', according to her Christian beliefs in 1852. Earlier, in Britain and America, [[Quakers]] were active in abolitionism. A group of Quakers founded the first English abolitionist organization&lt;!-- "in 1873" cannot be correct --&gt;, and a Quaker petition brought the issue before government that same year. The Quakers continued to be influential throughout the lifetime of the movement, in many ways leading the way for the campaign.

Elizabeth Clark cites early Christian writings by authors such as [[Tertullian]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], and [[John Chrysostom]] as being exemplary of the negative view of women that has been perpetuated in church tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Elizabeth. ''Women in the Early Church''. Liturgical Press, 1984. {{ISBN|0-8146-5332-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the latter part of the 20th century, only the names of very few women who contributed to the formation of Christianity in its earliest years were widely known: [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], the mother of Jesus;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/jesus/tree.html|title=Jesus Many Faces - Jesus' Family Tree - From Jesus To Christ - FRONTLINE - PBS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Magdalene]], disciple of Jesus and the first witness to the resurrection; and [[Mary of Bethany|Mary]] and [[Martha]], the sisters who offered him hospitality in Bethany.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;"King, Karen L.

[[Harvard University|Harvard]] scholar [[Karen Leigh King|Karen King]] writes that more of the many women who contributed to the formation of Christianity in its earliest years are becoming known. Further, she concludes that for centuries in [[Western Christianity]], Mary Magdalene has been wrongly identified as the adulteress and repentant prostitute presented in {{Bibleref2|John|8}}—a connection supposed by tradition but nowhere claimed in the New Testament. According to King, the [[Gospel of Mary]] shows that she was an influential figure, a prominent disciple and leader of one wing of the early Christian movement that promoted women's leadership.

King claims that every sect within [[early Christianity]] which had advocated women's prominence in ancient Christianity was eventually declared [[heresy in Christianity|heretical]], and evidence of women's early leadership roles was erased or suppressed.&lt;ref name="King" /&gt;

Classicist [[Evelyn Stagg]] and [[New Testament]] scholar [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Frank Stagg]] in their jointly authored book, ''Woman in the World of Jesus,'' document very unfavorable attitudes toward women that prevailed in the world into which Jesus came. They assert that there is no recorded instance where Jesus disgraces, belittles, reproaches, or stereotypes a woman. They interpret the recorded treatment and attitude Jesus showed to women as evidence that the Founder of Christianity treated women with great dignity and respect.&lt;ref&gt;Stagg, Evelyn and Frank. ''Woman in the World of Jesus.'' Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1978. {{ISBN|0-664-24195-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various theologians have concluded that the canonical examples of the manner of Jesus are instructive for inferring his attitudes toward women.

===Christianity and violence===
{{Main|Christianity and violence}}
Many critics of Christianity have cited the violent acts of Christian nations as a reason to denounce the religion. Science-fiction writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]] said that he could not forgive religions for the atrocities and wars over time.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Arthur C. &amp; Watts, Alan (January), “At the Interface: Technology and Mysticism”, Playboy (Chicago, Ill.: HMH Publishing) 19 (1): 94, ISSN 0032-1478, OCLC 3534353&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Dawkins]] makes a similar case in his book, ''[[The God Delusion]]''. In the counterargument book ''[[The Dawkins Delusion?]],'' [[Alister McGrath]] responds to Dawkins by suggesting that, far from endorsing "out-group hostility", [[Jesus]] commanded an ethic of "out-group affirmation". McGrath agrees that it is necessary to critique religion, but says that Dawkins seems unaware that it possesses internal means of reform and renewal. While Christians may certainly be accused of failing to live up to Jesus' standard of acceptance, it is there at the heart of the Christian ethic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alister McGrath]] and Joanna Collicutt McGrath, ''[[The Dawkins Delusion?]],'' [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]], 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-281-05927-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La masacre de San Bartolomé, por François Dubois.jpg|thumb|280px|The [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of French Protestants in 1572]]
Peace, compassion and forgiveness of wrongs done by others are key elements of Christian teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|6|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Christians have struggled since the days of the [[Church fathers]] with the question of when the use of force is justified.&lt;ref name="Right Reason"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peoples, Dr.|first1=Glenn Andrew|title=Whittling down the pacifist narrative: Did early Christians serve in the army? |url=http://www.rightreason.org/2012/did-early-christians-serve-in-the-army/ |website=www.rightreason.org|accessdate=7 August 2014|date=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such debates have led to concepts such as [[just war theory]]. Throughout history, biblical passages have been used to justify the use of force against heretics,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1Kings|18:17-46|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; sinners&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|17:5|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and external enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Psalm|18:37|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heitman and Hagan identify the [[Inquisition]]s, [[Crusades]], wars of religion and [[antisemitism]] as being "among the most notorious examples of Christian violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International encyclopedia of violence research, Volume 2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sMNbcU7UnywC&amp;pg=PA323&amp;q=Christianity+antisemitism+%22violent+religion%22#v=onepage&amp;f=false |publisher=Springer |year=2003|isbn=9781402014666 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To this list, J. Denny Weaver adds, "warrior popes, support for [[capital punishment]], [[corporal punishment]] under the guise of 'spare the rod and spoil the child', justifications of slavery, world-wide colonialism in the name of conversion to Christianity, the systemic violence of women subjected to men". Weaver employs a broader definition of violence that extends the meaning of the word to cover "harm or damage", not just physical violence per se. Thus, under his definition, Christian violence includes "forms of systemic violence such as poverty, racism, and sexism".&lt;ref name=Weaver&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crosscurrents.org/weaver0701.htm#TEXT1 |title=Violence in Christian Theology|accessdate=28 October 2014 |publisher=Cross Currents|year=2001 |author=J. Denny Weaver |quote="[3rd paragraph] I am using broad definitions of the terms "violence" and "nonviolence." "Violence" means harm or damage, which obviously includes the direct violence of killing –  in war, capital punishment, murder –  but also covers the range of forms of systemic violence such as poverty, racism, and sexism. "Nonviolence" also covers a spectrum of attitudes and actions, from the classic Mennonite idea of passive nonresistance through active nonviolence and nonviolent resistance that would include various kinds of social action, confrontations and posing of alternatives that do not do bodily harm or injury.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some Christians have relied on Christian teaching to justify their use of force, other{{which|date=May 2013}} Christians have opposed the use of force and violence. Some{{which|date=May 2013}} of the latter have formed sects that have emphasized pacificism as a central tenet of their faith.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Christians have also engaged in violence against those that they classify as heretics and non-believers. In ''[[Letter to a Christian Nation]]'', critic of religion [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] writes that "...faith inspires violence in at least two ways. First, people often kill other human beings because they believe that the creator of the universe wants them to do it... Second, far greater numbers of people fall into conflict with one another because they define their moral community on the basis of their religious affiliation..."&lt;ref name=SHarris&gt;{{Cite book|title=Letter to a Christian Nation|author=Sam Harris|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=2006|pages=80–81|isbn=978-0-307-26577-7|authorlink=Sam Harris (author)|title-link=Letter to a Christian Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian theologians point to a strong [[doctrinal]] and historical imperative within Christianity against violence, particularly Jesus' [[Sermon on the Mount]], which taught nonviolence and love of enemies. Weaver says that Jesus' pacifism was "preserved in the justifiable war doctrine that declares all war as sin even when declaring it occasionally a necessary evil, and in the prohibition of fighting by monastics and clergy as well as in a persistent tradition of [[Christian pacifism]]".&lt;ref name="Weaver2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crosscurrents.org/weaver0701.htm#TEXT1|title=Violence in Christian Theology|accessdate=2010-10-27|publisher=Cross Currents|year=2001|author=J. Denny Weaver}} {{Unreliable source?|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others point out sayings and acts of Jesus that do not fit this description: the absence of any censure of the soldier who asks Jesus to heal his servant, his overturning the tables and chasing the moneychangers from the temple with a rope in his hand, and through his Apostles, baptising a Roman Centurion who is never asked to first give up arms.&lt;ref name=Addis&gt;''War, A Catholic Dictionary: Containing some Account of the Doctrine, Discipline, Rites, Ceremonies, Councils, and Religious Orders of the Catholic Church'', W.

Historically, prohibitions on fighting by monastics and clerics have often been discarded; the notion of military monasticism, emerged in the 12th century, in large part because of the advocacy of [[St. Bernard of Clairvaux]]. Bernard - and, once the papacy gave sanction to the idea, the entire Catholic Church - believed that existing Christian methods of serving the Church's ends in war were inadequate, and that a group of dedicated warrior monks could achieve spiritual merit by waging war, rather than despite it. In this view, war against heretics justified means of waging war that fell outside the bounds of [[just war]]; for example, the [[Teutonic Order]], which received papal sanction, made frequent use of massacre and the [[forced conversion|use of violence to compel conversion]] during the [[Baltic Crusades]]. &lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, Eric.

===Science===
{{See also|Relationship between religion and science}}
{{POV section|date=March 2013|Christian fundamentalists reject the theory of evolution}}

During the 19th century an interpretive model of the relationship between religion and science known today as the [[conflict theory]] developed, according to which interaction between religion and science almost inevitably leads to hostility and conflict. A popular example was the misconception that people from the [[Science in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]] believed that the [[Myth of the Flat Earth|Earth was flat]], and that only science, freed from religious dogma, had shown that it was spherical. This thesis was a popular [[historiography|historiographical]] approach during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but most contemporary [[history of science|historians of science]] now reject it.&lt;ref&gt;Quotation: "The conflict thesis, at least in its simple form, is now widely perceived as a wholly inadequate intellectual framework within which to construct a sensible and realistic historiography of Western science."

The astronomer [[Carl Sagan]], mentioned the dispute between the astronomical systems of [[Ptolemy]] (who thought that the sun and planets revolved around the earth) and [[Copernicus]] (who thought the earth and planets revolved around the sun). He states in ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'' that [[Ptolemy]]'s belief was "supported by the church through the Dark Ages… [It] effectively prevented the advance of astronomy for 1,500 years."&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, Carl. ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'', Episode 3: "The Harmony of the Worlds"&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ted Peters (theologian)|Ted Peters]] in ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' writes that although there is some truth in this story, it has been exaggerated and has become "a modern myth perpetuated by those wishing to see warfare between science and religion who were allegedly persecuted by an atavistic and dogma-bound ecclesiastical authority".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Ted Peters, Science and Religion, Encyclopedia of Religion, p.8182&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the [[Catholic Church]]'s seeming vindication of Galileo attracted much comment in the [[Galileo affair|media]].

However, a counter argument by Stephen Maitzen suggests that the ethical inconsistency in the bible that is not followed by most Christians or Jews today, such as the execution of homosexuals, blasphemers, disobedient children, or the punishment for mixing linen and cloth, ultimately undermines the skeptical theism argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maitzen|first1=Stephen|title=Skeptical Theism and God's Commands|journal=Sophia|date=1 November 2007|volume=46|issue=3|pages=237–243|doi=10.1007/s11841-007-0032-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christian ethics have also been criticized for breeding intolerance (such as anti-semitic views), and for having a repressive nature.

It is a form of Christianity that is the mirror opposite of what Jesus embodied."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yuricareport.com/Dominionism/Lang_BushAndTheRiseOfChristianFascism.html|title=George Bush and the Rise of Christian Fascism|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221073735/http://www.yuricareport.com/Dominionism/Lang_BushAndTheRiseOfChristianFascism.html|archivedate=2008-02-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christian right====
[[Christian right|Conservative Christians]] are often accused of being intolerant by [[secular humanists]] and [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Christians]], claiming that they oppose science that seems to contradict scripture ([[Creationism]], use of [[birth control]], [[abortion]], research into [[embryonic stem cell]]s, etc.), [[liberal democracy]] ([[separation of church and state]]), and progressive social policies (rights of people of other races and religions, of women, and of people with different sexual orientations).&lt;ref name="berlet1998"&gt;Chip Berlet, "Following the Threads," in Ansell, Amy E.

====United States====
Gallup polling shows that within the US, trust in organized religion has declined since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionnews.com/2015/06/17/americans-confidence-religion-hits-new-low/|title=Americans' confidence in religion hits a new low|work=Religion News Service|author=Cathy Lynn Grossman|date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phil Zuckerman, a sociology professor, argues that political campaigning against [[same-sex marriage]] in churches “is turning off so many people from Christianity,” and responsible for a decline in the number of Christians in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-us-religion-20150512-story.html|title=U.S. has become notably less Christian, major study finds|date=12 May 2015|work=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Kinnaman, president of the [[George Barna|Barna Institute]], and Gabe Lyons of the Fermi Project published a study of attitudes of 16- to 29-year-old Americans towards Christianity. They found that about 38% of all those who were not regular churchgoers had negative impressions of Christianity, and especially evangelical Christianity, associating it with conservative political activism, hypocrisy, [[Homophobia|anti-homosexuality]], [[authoritarianism]], and judgmentalism.&lt;ref&gt;About 91% of young outsiders felt Christians were anti-homosexual, 87% felt Christians were judgemental and 85% thought Christians were hypocritical.&lt;/ref&gt; About 17% had "very bad" perceptions of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publicreligion.org/2011/10/millennials-leave-their-churches-over-science-lesbian-gay-issues/|title=Millennials Leave Their Churches Over Science, Lesbian &amp; Gay Issues|date=10 June 2011|work=Public Religion Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/religion/2007-10-10-christians-young_N.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.barna.org/barna-update/culture/618-america-s-change-of-mind-on-same-sex-marriage-and-lgbtq-rights|title=America's Change of Mind on Same-Sex Marriage and LGBTQ Rights|work=Barna|date=3 Jul 2013|access-date=2015-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815173602/https://www.barna.org/barna-update/culture/618-america-s-change-of-mind-on-same-sex-marriage-and-lgbtq-rights|archive-date=2013-08-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of women===
There are three major viewpoints within modern Christianity over the role of women. They are known respectively as [[Christian feminism]], [[Christian egalitarianism]] and [[complementarianism]].

* ''Christian feminists'' take a feminist position from a Christian perspective.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite web|title=About the Evangelical and Ecumenical Women's Caucus |url=http://www.eewc.com/About.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710172712/http://www.eewc.com/About.htm |archivedate=July 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Christian egalitarians'' advocate ability-based, rather than gender-based, ministry of Christians of all ages, ethnicities and socio-economic classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbeinternational.org|title=Home - Christians for Biblical Equality (CBE)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egalitarians support the [[ordination of women]] and [[Christian views on marriage#Egalitarian view|equal roles]] in marriage, but are theologically and morally more conservative than Christian feminists and prefer to avoid the label "feminist". A limited notion of gender complementarity is held by some, known as "complementarity without hierarchy".&lt;ref name="DBE"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discovering Biblical Equality: Complementarity without Hierarchy|author=Ronald W. Pierce and Rebecca Merrill Groothuis (eds.)|publisher=IVP 2004|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Complementarians'' support both equality and beneficial differences between men and women.&lt;ref name="Grudem"&gt;[[Wayne Grudem|Grudem, Wayne A.]] "Should We Move Beyond the New Testament to a Better Ethic?" ''[[Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society]]'' (''JETS''), '''47/2''' (June 2004) 299–346&lt;/ref&gt; They believe the Bible teaches that men and women have distinct complementary roles in both marriage and in the church. They maintain that men have a responsibility to lead and women have a responsibility to submit to the leadership of men.

Some Christians argue that the idea of God as a man is based less on gender but rather on the dominant Patriarchal society of the time in which men acted as leaders and caretakers of the Family.&lt;ref&gt;Eck, Diana L. ''Encountering God: A Spiritual Journey from Bozeman to Banaras.'' (2003) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the idea of God being "The Father" is with regards to his relationship with what are "his children", Christians.

Most mainline Christians claim that the doctrine of the Trinity implies that God should be called Father and not called Mother, in the same way that Jesus was a man and was not a woman.&lt;ref name=Brumley&gt;Brumley, Mark. "[http://www.ewtn.com/library/Theology/NotMother.htm Why God is Father and not Mother]". ''The Catholic Faith Magazine''. July/August 1999.  Accessed 25 Feb 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus tells His followers to address God as Father.{{Bibleref2c|Mt.|6:9-13}} He tells his disciples to be merciful as their heavenly Father is merciful.{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|6:36}} He says the Father will give the Holy Spirit to those who ask{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|11:13}} and that the Spirit of their Father will speak through them in times of persecution.{{Bibleref2c|Mt.|10:20}} On Easter Sunday, he directs Mary Magdalene to tell the other disciples, "I am going to my Father and your Father...."{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|20:17}} Mark Brumley points out that behind New Testament language of Divine Adoption and regeneration is the idea that God is our Father because He is the "source" or "origin" of our new life in Christ. He has saved us through Christ and sanctified us in the Spirit. Brumley claims this is clearly more than a metaphor; the analogy with earthly fatherhood is obvious. God is not merely like a father for Christ’s followers; he is really their Father. Among Christians who hold to this idea, there is a distinct sense that Jesus' treatment of women should imply equality in leadership and marital roles every bit as strongly as the definite male gender of Jesus should imply a name of Father for God. Rather than as antifeminist, they characterize alternative naming as unnecessary and unsupported by the words found in the Bible.&lt;ref name=Brumley/&gt;

In 2000, the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] voted to revise its "Baptist Faith and Message" (Statement of Faith),&lt;ref name=BFM&gt;"[http://www.sbc.net/bfm/bfm2000.asp Baptist Faith and Message]"&lt;/ref&gt; opposing women as pastors. While this decision is not binding and would not prevent women from serving as pastors, the revision itself has been criticized by some from within the convention. In the same document, the Southern Baptist Convention took a strong position of the subordinating view of woman in marriage: "A wife is to submit herself ''graciously'' to the servant leadership of her husband. She has the God-given responsibility to respect her husband and to serve as his helper in managing the household and nurturing the next generation."&lt;ref name=BFM/&gt; (Emphasis added)

The Eastern Orthodox Church does not allow female clergy. The Chaldean Catholic Church on the other hand continues to maintain a large number of deaconesses serving alongside male deacons during mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaldaya.net/2008/DailyNews/08/Aug16_08_A1_MaryAssumptions.html|title=الاحتفال بعيد انتقال العذراء مريم في سان دييكو|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some evangelical churches, it is forbidden for women to become pastors, deacons or church elders. In support of such prohibitions, the verse {{Bibleref2|1tim|2:12|KJV|1&amp;nbsp;Timothy&amp;nbsp;2:12}} is often cited:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theologicalstudies.citymax.com/page/page/1572472.htm The 9 Most Important Issues Facing the Evangelical Church&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miracles===
{{Further|Miracle|Faith healing|Exorcism}}

Philosopher [[David Hume]] argued against the plausibility of miracles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hume |first=David |authorlink=David Hume |editor=Tom L. Beauchamp |chapter=Chapter 10. Of Religion |title=An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding: A Critical Edition |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R6d35Aei0KoC&amp;pg=PA86#v=snippet&amp;q=miracle%20violation&amp;f=false |work=Volume 3 of The Clarendon edition of the works of David Hume |accessdate=1 August 2013 |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= |isbn=9780198250609 |page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
1) A miracle is a violation of the known laws of nature;
2) We know these laws through repeated and constant experience;
3) The testimony of those who report miracles contradicts the operation of known scientific laws;
4) Consequently no one can rationally believe in miracles.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Roman Catholic Church and the Greek Orthodox Church reject Hume's argument against miracles outright with the teachings of St. Gregory Palamas, who postulated that Reason alone was not sufficient to understand God's energies (activities such as miracles) and essence, but faith was.&lt;ref&gt;*''Homilies of Saint Gregory Palamas'', Vol. 1 ({{ISBN|1-878997-67-X}}) ''Homilies of Saint Gregory Palamas'', Vol. 2 ({{ISBN|187899767X}})&lt;/ref&gt;  Of course, when no one would hear anything classified as Christianity but for the communications of other human beings, the question of just where faith has been placed arises. 

Miraculous healings through prayers, often involving the "[[laying on of hands]]", have been reported. However, reliance on [[faith healing]] alone can indirectly contribute to serious harm and even death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sram.org/0802/faith-healing.html |title=Inherent Dangers of Faith-Healing Studies |publisher=The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine |year=2004 |author=Bruce L.

[[Christian apologetics|Christian apologists]] including [[C.S. Lewis]], [[Norman Geisler]] and [[William Lane Craig]] have argued that [[miracle]]s are reasonable and plausible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =Are Miracles Logically Impossible?| publisher =Come Reason Ministries, Convincing Christianity| url =http://www.comereason.org/phil_qstn/phi060.asp| accessdate =2007-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title ="Miracles are not possible," some claim.

===Incarnation===
{{Main|Incarnation (Christianity)}}
[[Celsus]] found it hard to reconcile Christian human God who was born and matured with his Jewish God who was supposed to be one and unchanging. He asked "if God wanted to reform humanity, why did he choose to descend and live on earth? How his brief presence in Jerusalem could benefit all the millions of people who lived elsewhere in the world or who had lived and died before his incarnation?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard W. Clarke]], The Gospel of Matthew and Its Readers, Indiana University Press, 2003, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

One classical response is [[Lewis's trilemma]], a [[syllogism]] popularised by [[C. S. Lewis]] that intended to demonstrate the logical inconsistency of both holding [[Jesus]] of Nazareth to be a "great moral teacher" while also denying his divinity. The logical soundness of this trilemma has been widely questioned.&lt;ref&gt;William Lane Craig, ''Reasonable Faith: Christian Truth and Apologetics'', Crossway Books (1994) pages 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hell and damnation===
{{See also|Problem of Hell|Hell in Christianity}}

[[File:Adamandevesin.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adam and Eve]] being driven from Eden due to original sin, portrayed by [[Gustave Doré]].]]

Christianity has been criticized as seeking to persuade people into accepting its authority through simple fear of punishment or, conversely, through hope of reward after death, rather than through rational argumentation or [[empirical evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;"Let no cultured person draw near, none wise and none sensible, for all that kind of thing we count evil; but if any man is ignorant, if any man is wanting in sense and culture, if anybody is a fool, let him come boldly [to become a Christian]. [[Celsus]], AD178&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Christian doctrine dictates that, without faith in Jesus Christ or in the Christian faith in general, one is subject to eternal punishment in [[Hell]].&lt;ref&gt;"Since we all inherit Adam's sin, we all deserve eternal damnation. All who die unbaptized, even infants, will go to hell and suffer unending torment. We have no reason to complain of this, since we are all wicked. (In the Confessions, the Saint enumerates the crimes of which he was guilty in the cradle.) But by God's free grace certain people, among those who have been baptized, are chosen to go to heaven; these are the elect. They do not go to heaven because they are good; we are all totally depraved, except insofar as God's grace, which is only bestowed on the elect, enables us to be otherwise. No reason can be given why some are saved and the rest damned; this is due to God's unmotivated choice. Damnation proves God's justice; salvation His mercy. Both equally display His goodness." ''A history of Western Philosophy by Bertrand Russell'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1945&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics regard the eternal punishment of those who fail to adopt Christian faith as morally objectionable, and consider it an abhorrent picture of the nature of the world. On a similar theme objections are made against the perceived injustice of punishing a person for all eternity for a temporal crime. Some Christians agree (see [[Annihilationism]] and [[Trinitarian Universalism]]). These beliefs have been considered especially repugnant&lt;ref&gt;Bible Teaching and Religious Practice essay: "Europe and Elsewhere," [[Mark Twain]], 1923)&lt;/ref&gt; when the claimed omnipotent God makes, or allows a person to come into existence, with a nature that desires that which God finds objectionable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein]], ''Out of My Later Years (New York: Philosophical Library'', 1950), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Abrahamic religions, [[Hell]] has traditionally been regarded as a [[punishment]] for wrongdoing or [[sin]] in this life, as a manifestation of divine justice. As in the [[problem of evil]], some apologists argue that the torments of Hell are attributable not to a defect in God's benevolence, but in human [[free will]]. Although a benevolent God would prefer to see everyone saved, he would also allow humans to control their own destinies. This view opens the possibility of seeing Hell not as retributive punishment, but rather as an option that God allows, so that people who do not wish to be with God are not forced to be. [[C. S. Lewis]] most famously proposed this view in his book ''[[The Great Divorce]]'', saying: "There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, 'Thy will be done,' and those to whom God says, in the end, 'Thy will be done.'"

[[Hell]] is not seen as strictly a matter of retributive justice even by the more traditionalist churches. For example, the [[Eastern Orthodox]] see it as a condition brought about by, and the natural consequence of, free rejection of God's love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://home.it.net.au/~jgrapsas/pages/afterdeath.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-09-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020901031115/http://home.it.net.au/~jgrapsas/pages/afterdeath.htm |archive-date=2002-09-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] teaches that hell is a place of punishment&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1035, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, {{ISBN|0-89243-565-8}},1994-the revised version issued 1997 has no changes in this section&lt;/ref&gt; brought about by a person's self exclusion from communion with God.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1033, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, {{ISBN|0-89243-565-8}},1994&lt;/ref&gt; In some ancient Eastern Orthodox traditions, Hell and Heaven are distinguished not spatially, but by the relation of a person to God's love.

Some modern critics of the doctrine of Hell (such as [[Marilyn McCord Adams]]) claim that, even if Hell is seen as a choice rather than as punishment, it would be unreasonable for God to give such flawed and ignorant creatures as humans the awesome responsibility of their eternal destinies.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Beck. "[http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2007/03/christ-and-horrors-part-3-horror-defeat.html Christ and Horrors, Part 3: Horror Defeat, Universalism, and God's Reputation]". ''Experimental Theology.'' March 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Kvanvig]], in his book, ''The Problem of Hell'', agrees that God would not allow one to be eternally damned by a decision made under the wrong circumstances. For instance, one should not always honor the choices of human beings, even when they are full adults, if, for instance, the choice is made while [[depression (mood)|depressed]] or careless. On Kvanvig's view, God will abandon no person until they have made a settled, final decision, under favorable circumstances, to reject God, but God will respect a choice made under the right circumstances. Once a person finally and competently chooses to reject God, out of respect for the person's autonomy, God allows them to be annihilated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Kvanvig]], ''The Problem of Hell'', New York: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-508487-0}}, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

===Idolatry===

Christian have sometimes been accused of idolatry, especially in regards in the [[iconoclastic controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Works of Thomas Manton", by [[Thomas Manton]], p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Orthodox and Roman Catholic Christian forbid worship of icons and relics as divine in themselves, while honouring those represented by them is accepted and philosophically justified by the [[Second Council of Constantinople]].

===Limbo===
The Roman Catholic Church teaches that [[baptism]] is a necessity. In the 5th century, [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] [[Augustine of Hippo#Sacramental theology|concluded]] that infants who die without baptism were consigned to hell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg-e.org/maclehose/maw02.html|title="A Tender Age": Chapter 2|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 13th century, theologians referred to the "[[limbo]] of infants" as a place where unbaptized babies were deprived of the vision of God, but did not suffer because they did not know of that which they were deprived, and moreover enjoyed perfect natural happiness. The 1983 Code of Canon Law (1183 §2) specifies that ''"Children whose parents had intended to have them baptized but who died before baptism, may be allowed church funeral rites by the local ordinary"''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/236788/Code-of-Canon-Law-1983?from_related_doc=1 Canon Law 1983]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the 30-member International Theological Commission revisited the concept of limbo.&lt;ref name="catholicnews.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0702216.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-01-22 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20070508193238/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0702216.htm |archive-date=2007-05-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[n:Vatican abolishes Limbo]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the commission also said that hopefulness was not the same as certainty about the destiny of such infants.&lt;ref name="catholicnews.com" /&gt; Rather, as stated in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1257, "God has bound salvation to the sacrament of Baptism, but he himself is not bound by his sacraments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|year=1994|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York|isbn=978-0-385-47967-7|pages=845}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hope in the mercy of God is not the same as certainty through the sacraments, but it is not without result, as demonstrated in Jesus' statement to the thief on the cross in Luke 23:42-43.

The concept of limbo is not accepted by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] or by [[Protestantism|Protestants]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/limbo3.htm Limbo: Recent statements by the Catholic church; Protestant views on Limbo] at Religioustolerance.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atonement===
The idea of [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] for [[sin]] is criticized by [[Richard Dawkins]] on the grounds that the image of God as requiring the suffering and death of Jesus to effect reconciliation with humankind is immoral. The view is summarized by Dawkins: "if God wanted to forgive our sins, why not just forgive them? Who is God trying to impress?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0774118/quotes|title=Root of All Evil?|date=9 January 2006|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxford theologian Alister McGrath maintains that Dawkins is "ignorant" of [[Christian theology]], and therefore unable to engage religion and faith intelligently. He goes on to say that the atonement was necessary because of our flawed human nature, which made it impossible for us to save ourselves, and that it expresses God's love for us by removing the sin that stands in the way of our reconciliation with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= McGrath |first=Alister |authorlink=Alister McGrath |title=Dawkins' God: Genes, Memes, and the Meaning of Life |year=2004 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Oxford, England |isbn=978-1-4051-2538-3 |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to the criticism that he is "ignorant" of theology, Dawkins asks, "Do you have to read up on leprechology before disbelieving in [[leprechaun]]s?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://richarddawkins.net/articleComments,1647,Do-you-have-to-read-up-on-leprechology-before-disbelieving-in-them,Richard-Dawkins-The-Independent,page27 |title=Do you have to read up on leprechology before disbelieving in them? |accessdate=2007-11-14 |author=Dawkins, Richard |date=September 17, 2007 |publisher=RichardDawkins.net }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[y]es, I have, of course, met this point before. It sounds superficially fair. But it presupposes that there is something in Christian theology to be ignorant about. The entire thrust of my position is that Christian theology is a non-subject."&lt;ref&gt;Marianna Krejci-Papa, 2005. "[http://www.stnews.org/News-201.htm Taking On Dawkins' God:An interview with Alister McGrath] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207010849/http://www.stnews.org/News-201.htm |date=2015-02-07 }}." ''[[Science &amp; Theology News]]'', 2005–04–25.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dinesh D'Souza]] says that Dawkins' criticism "only makes sense if you assume Christians made the whole thing up." He goes on to say that Christians view it as a beautiful sacrifice, and that "through the extremity of Golgotha, Christ reconciles divine justice and divine mercy."&lt;ref&gt;[[Dinesh D'Souza]], ''What's So Great About Christianity'', Regnery Publishing, {{ISBN|1-59698-517-8}} (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Wilson argues that Dawkins misses the point of the atonement, which has nothing to do with masochism, but is based on the concepts of holiness, sin and grace.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Wilson, ''Deluded by Dawkins?'', Kingsway Publications, {{ISBN|978-1-84291-355-0}} (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert G.

The prominent Christian apologist [[Josh McDowell]], in ''More Than A Carpenter'', addresses the issue through an analogy of a real-life judge in California who was forced to fine his daughter $100 for speeding, but then came down, took off his robe, and paid the fine for her from his billfold,&lt;ref&gt;''More Than A Carpenter'', Tyndale House, Wheaton, Illinois, 1977, {{ISBN|978-0-8423-4552-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; though as in this and other cases, illustrations are only cautiously intended to describe certain aspects of the atonement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=978-1-84474-178-6|year=2007|last1=Jeffery|first1=Steve

===Second Coming===
{{Main|Second Coming}}
Several verses in the [[New Testament]] contain [[Jesus]]' predictions that the [[Second Coming]] would take place within a century following his death.&lt;ref&gt;Most notably, {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:22-23}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Matt.|16:27-28}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Matt.|23:36}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Matt.|24:29-34}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Matt.|26:62-64}}; {{bibleref2|Mark|9:1}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Mark|14:24-30}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Mark|14:60-62}}; and {{bibleref2|Luke|9:27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus appears to promise for his followers the second coming to happen before the generation he is preaching to vanishes. This is seen as an essential failure in the teachings of Christ by many critics such as [[Bertrand Russell]].&lt;ref&gt;In his famous essay [[Why I Am Not a Christian]]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Preterist]]s argue that Jesus did not mean his second coming{{bibleref2c|Matt.|16:28}} but speaks about demonstrations of his might, formulating this as "coming in his kingdom", especially the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple 70 AD, which he foretold, and by which time not all of his disciples were still living.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Knox Chamblin, Professor of New Testament Emeritus, Columbia Theological Seminary: [http://www.thirdmill.org/newfiles/kno_chamblin/NT.Chamblin.Matt.16.21-28.pdf Commentary on Matthew 16:21-28] - see last 4 paragraphs&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:23|31}} should be understood in the same way.&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Zahn, F.F. Bruce, J. Barton Payne, etc. hold this opinion [http://www.christiancourier.com/articles/668-what-is-the-meaning-of-matthew-10-23 - What is the meaning of Matthew 10:23?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inconsistency with Old Testament conception of the afterlife===
{{See also|Afterlife#Christianity}}

Most Christian traditions teach belief in life after death as a central and indispensable tenet of their faith. Critics argue that the Christian conception of the afterlife is inconsistent with that described in the [[Old Testament]]. George E. Mendenhall believes there is no concept of immortality or life after death in the Old Testament.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;''From Witchcraft to Justice: Death and Afterlife in the Old Testament,'' George E. Mendenhall.&lt;/ref&gt; The presumption is that the deceased are inert, lifeless, and engaging in no activity.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

The idea of [[Sheol]] ("שׁאול") or a state of nothingness was shared among [[Babylonian mythology|Babylonian]] and Israelite beliefs. "[[Sheol]], as it was called by the ancient Israelites, is the land of no return, lying below the cosmic ocean, to which all, the mighty and the weak, travel in the ghostly form they assume after death, known as Raphraim. There the dead have no experience of either joy or pain, perceiving no light, feeling no movement."&lt;ref name="multiply"&gt;Hiroshi Obayashi, ''Death and Afterlife: Perspectives of World Religions. See Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; Obayashi alludes that the Israelites were satisfied with such a shadowy realm of afterlife because they were more deeply concerned with survival.&lt;ref name="multiply" /&gt;

Before Christianity began in the 1st century, the belief in an afterlife was already prevalent in [[Jewish eschatology|Jewish thinking]]&lt;ref name="Jewish"&gt;[[Jewish eschatology#Olam Haba - the afterlife and the world to come]] Jewish eschatology: The afterlife and olam haba&lt;/ref&gt; among the [[Pharisees]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Acts|23:6-8|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pharisees"&gt;[[Pharisees#Pharisaic principles and values]] Pharisees: Pharisaic Principles and Values&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Essenes]].&lt;ref name="essenes"&gt;[[Essenes#Rules, customs, theology and beliefs]] Essenes: Rules, customs, theology and beliefs&lt;/ref&gt; The themes of unity and [[sheol]] which largely shaped the ancient tradition of Judaism had been undermined when only the most pious of Jews were being massacred during the [[Maccabean]] revolt.{{Clear}}

==Criticism of Christians==
{{See also|Anti-Christian sentiment}}

===Hypocrisy===
[[File:Proper hands.jpg|thumb|right|Protestant Christian dominated KKK hinting at violence toward Jews and Catholics. Illustration by Rev. [[Branford Clarke]] from ''[[Heroes of the Fiery Cross]]'' 1928 by Bishop [[Alma White]] published by the [[Pillar of Fire Church]] in [[Zarephath, NJ]].]]
''[[Gaudium et spes]]'' claims that the example of Christians may be a contributory factor to [[atheism]], writing, "…believers can have more than a little to do with the birth of atheism. To the extent that they neglect their own training in the faith, or teach erroneous doctrine, or are deficient in their religious, moral, or social life, they must be said to conceal rather than reveal the authentic face of God and religion."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gaudium et spes]]'', 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Secular and religious critics have accused many Christians of being hypocritical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/april/32.70.html|title=The Evangelical Scandal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Whiteman, a Philadelphia psychologist found that the primary reasons for Christian divorce include adultery, abuse (including substance, physical and verbal abuse), and abandonment whereas the number one reason cited for divorce in the general population was incompatibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.christian-parents.net/marriage/M103_Reality_of_Divorce.htm |title=Marriage 103: The Raw Reality of Divorce and its Terrible Results&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2008-01-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327224719/http://www.christian-parents.net/marriage/M103_Reality_of_Divorce.htm |archive-date=2008-03-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materialism===

{{Quotation|
Instead of understanding and following the teachings of Jesus, the Christians argued and quarreled about the nature of Jesus’s divinity and about the Trinity. They called each other heretics and persecuted each other and cut each other’s heads off. There was a great and violent controversy at one time among different Christian sects over a certain diphthong. One party said that the word Homo-ousion should be used in a prayer; the other wanted Homoi-ousion-this difference had reference to the divinity of Jesus. Over this diphthong fierce war was raged and large numbers of people were slaughtered.

{{Quotation|
I like your Christ. I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ. The materialism of affluent Christian countries appears to contradict the claims of Jesus Christ that says it's not possible to worship both Mammon and God at the same time.

[[Mahatma Gandhi]]&lt;ref&gt;As quoted by [[William Rees-Mogg]] 4 April 2005 edition of ''[[The Times]]''. Gandhi here makes reference to a statement of Jesus: “No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon." (Luke 16:13)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Sectarianism===
{{Main|Sectarianism|Christian denomination}}
Some have argued that Christianity is undermined by the inability of Christians to agree on matters of faith and church governance, and the tendency for the content of their faith to be determined by regional or political factors. [[Schopenhauer]] sarcastically suggested:

: To the South German ecclesiastic the truth of the Catholic dogma is quite obvious, to the North German, the Protestant. If then, these convictions are based on objective reasons, the reasons must be climatic, and thrive, like plants, some only here, some only there. The convictions of those who are thus locally convinced are taken on trust and believed by the masses everywhere.&lt;ref name="multiple29"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Schopenhauer | first=Arthur | authorlink=Schopenhauer | title=The Essays of Arthur Schopenhauer |author2=trans. T. Bailey Saunders | chapterurl=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10833/10833-h/10833-h.htm#RULE4_2 | chapter=Religion: A Dialogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians respond that [[Ecumenism]] has helped bring together such communities, where in the past mistranslations of Christological Greek terms may have resulted in seemingly different views. [[Non-denominational Christianity]] represents another approach towards reducing the divisions within Christianity, although many Christian groups claiming to be non-denominational wind up with similar problems.

===Persecution by Christians===
{{Main|Christian debate on persecution and toleration|Christianity and violence}}
Individuals and groups throughout history have been persecuted by certain Christians (and Christian groups) based upon sex, sexual orientation, race, and religion (even within the bounds of Christianity itself). Many of the persecutors attempted to justify their actions with particular scriptural interpretations. During [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], important Christian theologians advocated [[religious persecution]] to varying degrees.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed a turning point in the Christian debate on persecution and toleration. Nowadays all significant [[Christian denomination]]s embrace [[religious toleration]], and "look back on centuries of persecution with a mixture of revulsion and incomprehension".&lt;ref&gt;see e.g.: John Coffey, ''Persecution and Toleration on Protestant England 1558-1689'', 2000, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Early Christianity]] was a minority religion in the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were themselves persecuted during that time]]. After [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine I converted to Christianity]], it became the dominant religion in the Roman Empire. Already under the reign of Constantine I, Christian heretics had been persecuted; beginning in the late 4th century AD also the [[Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire|ancient pagan religions were actively suppressed]]. In the view of many historians, the [[Constantinian shift]] turned Christianity from a persecuted into a persecuting religion.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g.: John Coffey, ''Persecution and Toleration on Protestant England 1558-1689'', 2000, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], the further [[Christianization]] of Europe was to a large extent peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;*Lutz E. von Padberg (1998), ''Die Christianisierung Europas im Mitterlalter'', Reclam {{de icon}}, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; However, encounters between [[Christianity and Paganism|Christians and Pagans]] were sometimes confrontational, and some Christian [[king]]s ([[Charlemagne]], [[Olaf I of Norway]]) were known for their violence against pagans. In the late Middle Ages, the appearance of the [[Cathar]]s and [[Bogomils]] in Europe laid the stage for the later [[witch-hunts]]. These (probably [[gnostic]]-influenced) sects were seen as [[heretics]] by the [[Catholic Church]], and the [[Inquisition]] was established to counter them.

After the [[Protestant Reformation]], the devastation caused by the partly religiously motivated wars ([[Thirty Years' War]], [[English Civil War]], [[French Wars of Religion]]) in Europe in the 17th century gave rise to the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]].

===Response of apologists===
Christians will sometimes point out that in their points of view, the wrongdoings of other Christians are not the fault of their religious scriptures but of those who have wrongly interpreted it. They posit that the mistakes of Christians do not refute the validity of their teachings, but merely proves their weakness and sinful nature, of which they then turn to Christ. Thus, according to them, the "Word of God" can still be true and valid without it having been accurately followed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} According to [[Ron Sider]], an Evangelical theologian, "The tragedy is that poll after poll by [[Gallup poll|Gallup]] and [[The Barna Group|Barna]] show that evangelicals live just like the world. Contrast that with what the New Testament says about what happens when people come to living faith in Christ. There's supposed to be radical transformation in the power of the Holy Spirit (2 Cor 5:17, 1 Cor 10:13). The disconnect between our biblical beliefs and our practice is just, I think, heart-rending."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/april/32.70.html|title=The Evangelical Scandal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar arguments are held by Roman Catholics against critics of the Catholic Church, or by other Christians defending their respective Churches.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} of the Church's structure. Roman Catholics will argue that Popes who were corrupt in the Middle Ages is not the fault of the position of the Papacy or of the fact that there are obedient Priests lower in the hierarchy, but the fault of the individual people who act as "God's representative on Earth". Such examples can be seen in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', where Roman Catholic Clergy who had practiced [[simony]] find themselves in the lower circles of hell.

Adolf Hitler's 1920 [[National Socialist Program|Nazi Party Platform]] promoted [[Positive Christianity]]—which mixed ideas of racial purity and Nazi ideology with elements of Christianity and removed "Jewish" elements.&lt;ref name="William-L-Shirer-pp238-9"&gt;{{cite book |author=William L.

Nazism aimed to transform the subjective consciousness of the German people—their attitudes, values and mentalities—into a single-minded, obedient "national community". The Nazis believed they would therefore have to replace class, religious and regional allegiances.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw; ''The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation; 4th Edn; Oxford University Press; New York; 2000"; pp. 173–74&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' process, Hitler attempted to create a unified [[Protestant Reich Church]] from Germany's 28 existing Protestant churches. The plan failed, and was resisted by the [[Confessing Church]]. Persecution of the [[Roman Catholicism in Germany|Catholic Church in Germany]] followed the Nazi takeover. Hitler moved quickly to eliminate [[political catholicism]]. Amid harassment of the Church, the [[Reich concordat]] treaty with the Vatican was signed in 1933, and promised to respect Church autonomy. Hitler routinely disregarded the Concordat, closing all Catholic institutions whose functions were not strictly religious. Clergy, nuns, and lay leaders were targeted, with thousands of arrests over the ensuing years.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica Online 2013"&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica Online: ''Fascism - Identification with Christianity''; 2013. Web. 14 Apr. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler was supportive of Christianity in public, yet hostile to it in private. Anti-clericalists like [[Joseph Goebbels]] and [[Martin Bormann]] saw the conflict with the Churches as a priority concern, and anti-church and anti-clerical sentiments were strong among grassroots party activists.&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw p.381-382"/&gt; Hitler was born to a practising Catholic mother and an [[anticlerical]] father, but after leaving home Hitler never again attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or received the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]]. According to biographer Alan Bullock, Hitler retained some regard for the organisational power of Catholicism but held private contempt for its central teachings, which he said, if taken to their conclusion, "would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure.":&lt;ref name="Hitler p219"&gt;[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler: A Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p219&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Goebbels, the [[Reichs Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Reich Minister of Propaganda]] used his position to widely publicise trials of clergy and nuns in his propaganda campaigns, showing the cases in the worst possible light. In 1928, soon after his election to the Reichstag, Goebbels wrote in his diary that National Socialism was a "religion" that needed a genius to uproot "outmoded religious practices" and put new ones in their place: "One day soon National Socialism will be the religion of all Germans. My Party is my church, and I believe I serve the Lord best if I do his will, and liberate my oppressed people from the fetters of slavery. That is my gospel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/goebbels/filmmore/pt.html|title=American Experience . The Man Behind Hitler . Transcript - PBS|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the war progressed, on the "Church Question", he wrote "after the war it has to be generally solved... There is, namely, an insoluble opposition between the Christian and a heroic-German world view".&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw p.381-382"/&gt;

Hitler's chosen deputy and private secretary, [[Martin Bormann]], was a rigid guardian of National Socialist orthodoxy and saw Christianity and Nazism as "incompatible" (mainly because of its Jewish origins),&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica Online 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/74248/Martin-Bormann Encyclopedia Britannica Online - ''Martin Bormann'']; web 25 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as did the official Nazi philosopher, [[Alfred Rosenberg]]. In his "[[Myth of the Twentieth Century]]" (1930), Rosenberg wrote that the main enemies of the Germans were the "Russian Tartars" and "Semites" - with "Semites" including Christians, especially the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/509892/Alfred-Rosenberg Encyclopedia Britannica Online - ''Alfred Rosenberg'']; web 25 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Alan Bullock|Bullock]], Hitler considered the Protestant clergy to be "insignificant" and "submissive" and lacking in a religion to be taken seriously.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Bullock; [[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p219"&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler attempted to create a unified [[Protestant Reich Church]] from 28 separate regional churches through ''[[Gleichschaltung]]''. His bid to create a unified Reich Church ultimately failed, and Hitler became disinterested in supporting the so-called "[[German Christians]]" Nazi aligned movement. Hitler initially lent support to [[Ludwig Muller]], a Nazi and former naval chaplain, to serve as Reich Bishop, but his heretical views against Paul the Apostle and the Semitic origins of Christ and the Bible (see [[Positive Christianity]]) quickly alienated sections of the Protestant church. Lutheran Pastor [[Martin Neimoller]] created the [[Confessing Church]] movement to oppose the Nazification of Protestant churches.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; WW Norton &amp; Company; London; p.295-297&lt;/ref&gt; Neimoller was arrested by the Gestapo in 1937, and sent to the concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/414633/Martin-Niemoller Encyclopedia Britannica Online - ''Martin Niemöller'']; web 24 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Confessing Church seminary was prohibited that same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/73037/Dietrich-Bonhoeffer Encyclopedia Britannica Online - ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer'']; web 25 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christian Persecution Complex ===

[[Christian persecution complex]] is the notion that Christian values and Christians are being oppressed by social groups and governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoover|2015|p=23}}: According to  Hoover Linda "''...Castelli (2007) believed the reluctance to
self-disclose could be the “Christian persecution complex” (p. 156), an ideology that Christian values are unfavorably targeted by social and governmental opposition...''"&lt;/ref&gt; According to Elizabeth Castelli, some set the starting point in the middle of the 20th century while others point to the 90's. After [[9/11]], it accelarated. &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Årsheim|2016|p=7}}:According to Elizabeth Castelli, this engagement can be ascribed to a ‘Christian persecution complex’ that gathered pace throughout the 1990s, with the adoption of the US International Religious Freedom Act in 1998 as a significant milestone, and with the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 as an accelerating factor (Castelli 2007: 173). This complex ''“…mobilizes the language of [[religious persecution]] to shut down political debate and critique by characterizing any position not in alignment with this politicized version of Christianity as an example of antireligious bigotry and persecution. Moreover, it routinely deploys the archetypal figure of the martyr as a source of unquestioned religious and political authority.”'' (Castelli 2007: 154).&lt;/ref&gt;The concept that Christianity is being oppressed is popular among conservative politicians in contemporary politics in the United States, and they utilize this idea to address issues concerning [[LGBT|LGBT people]] or the [[Contraceptive mandate|ACA’s Contraceptives Mandate]], which they perceive  as an attack on Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ben-Asher|2017|p=22}}: «...The notion that Christianity is under attack is prevalent in contemporary arguments for religious exemptions. Conservative legislatures, politicians and the media frequently characterize issues such as same-sex marriage and the ACA’s Contraceptives Mandate as attacks on Christians or Christianity....&lt;/ref&gt;

Others (like prof [[Candida Moss]] and lecturer Paul Cavill ) point out, that this mentality of being persecuted roots back at early Christianity era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/tr/moss-candida.aspx|title=Professor Candida Moss|website=birmingham.ac.uk|language=en|accessdate=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; it appeared during the era of [[early Christianity]] due to internal Christian identity politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Janes|Houen|2014|p=24}}: Indeed, a recent study by Candida Moss, ''The Myth of Persecution]]'' has suggested that Cristian "persecution complex" was the result of internal christian identity politics''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/directory/pc504@cam.ac.uk|title=Dr Paul Cavill

The New Testament teaches that persecution is the inevidable by-product of effective Christianity&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism by other religions==

T. F. Jordens&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956 the [[Niyogi Committee Report On Christian Missionary Activities]] was published by the Government of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. This influential report on controversial missionary activities in India recommended that suitable controls on conversions brought about through illegal means should be implemented.&lt;ref name=ch6&gt;Chapter 6 Hindutva, Secular India and the Report of the Christian Missionary Activities Enquiry Committee: 1954-57 Sebastian C.H.

Panikkar]]'s work "Asia and Western Dominance" was published and was one of the first post-Independence Indian critiques of Christian missions. It argued that the attempt to convert Asia has definitely failed, and that this failure was due to the missionaries' claim of a monopoly of truth which was alien to the Asian mind; their association with imperialism and the attitude of moral and [[racial superiority]] of the [[Christian West]].&lt;ref name=ch6/&gt;

Bauman, Oxford University Press, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arun Shourie]] urged Hindus to be "alert to the fact that missionaries have but one goal - that of harvesting us for the church"; and he wrote that they have "developed a very well-knit, powerful, extremely well-endowned organizational framework" for attaining that goal.&lt;ref&gt;The Debate on Conversion Initiated by the Sangh Parivar, 1998-1999 Author: Sebastian Kim, Source: Transformation, Vol. 22, No. 4, Christianity and Religions (October 2005), pp. 224- 237&lt;/ref&gt; In his "widely read and cited" book ''Missionaries in India'', Shourie tried to build a case that Christian evangelistic methods were cynically calculating and materialistic, and to Shourie, missionary strategizing "sounded more like the [[Planning Commission (India)|Planning Commission]], if not the Pentagon, than like Jesus".&lt;ref&gt;Pentecostals, Proselytization, and Anti-Christian Violence in Contemporary India by Chad M.

Indian philosopher [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], wrote: {{quotation|Unfortunately Christian religion inherited the Semitic creed of the ‘jealous God’ in the view of Christ as ‘the only begotten son of God’ so could not brook any rival near the throne. When Europe accepted the Christian religion, in spite of its own broad humanism, it accepted the fierce intolerance which is the natural result of belief in 'the truth once for all delivered to the saints.'&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cDdpTcyJtxMC&amp;pg=PA641 The Philosophy of Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]'', by Paul Arthur Schilpp, page = 641&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Judaism===
{{see also|Christianity and Judaism}}
[[Shlomo ben Aderet]] criticized Christianity, adding that it has lesser form of monotheism, and lacks a unified deity compared to Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;"Judaism and Other Religions", p. 88, publisher = Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Flusser]] viewed Christianity as "Cheaper Judaism" and highly anti-Judaism. He also highlighted the "failure of christianity to convert the Jewish people to the new message" as "precisely the reason for the strong anti-jewish trend in christianity."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kin7Y5xcAuIC&amp;pg=PA41 Anti-Judaism and Early Christian Identity: A Critique of the Scholarly Consensus]'', by Miriam S. Taylor, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Moshe Halbertal]], regards Christianity to be "idolatrous religion" and he further adds that the idolatry by Christians "opened the door to the easing of many other restrictive prohibitions."&lt;ref&gt;"Idolatry", by Moshe Halbertal, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Samuel Wise]] in his own words was critical towards the Christian community for their failure to rescue Jews from Europe during Nazi rule. He wrote that: {{quotation|A Christian world that will permit millions of Jews to be slain without moving heaven by prayer and earth in every human way to save its Jews has lost its capacity for moral and spiritual survival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/1943/02/19/archive/wise-criticizes-christian-world-for-failure-to-rescue-jews-in-nazi-europe Wise Criticizes Christian World for Failure to Rescue Jews in Nazi Europe] 19 February 1943&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Islam===
According to the Qu'ran, [[At-Tawba]] 31, Christians should follow one God, but they have made multiple.

{{quotation|They have taken as lords beside Allah their rabbis and their monks and the Messiah son of Mary, when they were bidden to worship only One God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=At-Tawba, Al Qu'ran|url=http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/nora/html/9-31.html|publisher=University of Leeds|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Muslim scholars have criticized Christianity, usually for its [[Trinity]] concept. They argue that this doctrine is an invention, distortion of the idea about God, and presentation of the idea that there are three gods.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=v26doW8jIyYC ''Christianity: An Introduction''], p. 125, by Alister E. McGrath&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{See also|Historicity of Jesus|Christ myth theory|Christianity and Paganism}}

Some have argued that Christianity is not founded on a historical Jesus, but rather on a [[Jesus-Myth|mythical creation]].&lt;ref&gt;Examples of authors who argue the [[Jesus myth theory]]: [[Thomas L. Thompson]] ''The Messiah Myth: The Near Eastern Roots of Jesus and David '' (Jonathan Cape, Publisher, 2006); [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]], ''The Case Against Christianity'' (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1991), 36–72; [[J.M. Robertson|John Mackinnon Robertson]]&lt;/ref&gt; This view proposes that the idea of Jesus was the Jewish manifestation of Hellenistic mystery cults that acknowledged the non-historic nature of their deity using it instead as a teaching device.&lt;ref&gt;Freke, Timothy and Gandy, Peter (1999) The Jesus Mysteries. London: Thorsons (Harper Collins)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the position that Jesus was not a historical figure is essentially without support among [[Biblical studies|biblical scholars]] and [[Classical history|classical historians]], most of whom regard its arguments as examples of [[pseudo-scholarship]].&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;!-- CONSOLIDATION OF CITATIONS UNDER ONE "ref" tag --&gt;Historian [[Michael Grant (author)|Michael Grant]] stated, "To sum up, modern critical methods fail to support the Christ myth theory. It has 'again and again been answered and annihilated by first rank scholars.' In recent years, 'no serious scholar has ventured to postulate the non historicity of Jesus' or at any rate very few, and they have not succeeded in disposing of the much stronger, indeed very abundant, evidence to the contrary." &amp;mdash;Michael Grant, ''Jesus: An Historian's Review of the Gospels'' (Scribner, 1995).
* "There are those who argue that Jesus is a figment of the Church’s imagination, that there never was a Jesus at all. I have to say that I do not know any respectable critical scholar who says that any more." &amp;mdash;Burridge, R &amp; Gould, G, ''Jesus Now and Then'', Wm. B. Eerdmans, 2004, p.34.
* Michael James McClymond, ''Familiar Stranger: An Introduction to Jesus of Nazareth'', Eerdrmans (2004), page 24: "most scholars regard the argument for Jesus' non-existence as unworthy of any response".
&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars and historians such as [[James H. Charlesworth]] caution against using parallels with [[life-death-rebirth deity|life-death-rebirth gods]] in the widespread [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religion]]s prevalent in the [[Hellenistic]] culture to conclude that Jesus is a purely legendary figure. Charlesworth argues that "it would be foolish to continue to foster the illusion that the Gospels are merely fictional stories like the legends of [[Hercules]] and [[Asclepius]]. The theologies in the New Testament are grounded on interpretations of real historical events…"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Charlesworth|first=James H. (ed.)|authorlink=James H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1330">'''David ab Owen''' (died 1512) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[abbot]] and [[bishop]]. His family were from the [[Glasgoed, Ceredigion|Glasgoed]] area of [[Meifod]], [[Montgomeryshire]]. He studied at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], graduating with a qualification in Canon and Civil Law. He is thought to have taken his Doctorate in Law.

He was an abbot of [[Strata Marcella]], and of [[Strata Florida]], and also of [[Aberconwy Abbey|Aberconwy]] at Maenan (sometime after of 1489) where he continued after his appointment to the [[Bishop of St Asaph|bishopric of St. Asaph]] in December 1503.

Many of the Welsh poets of the time, such as [[Bedo Brwynllys]], Dafydd Amharedudd ap Tudur, [[Guto'r Glyn]] and Hywel Rheinallt praised his scholarship and learning.

He died in February 1512, and was buried near the altar in his cathedral church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David ab Owen|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-DAFY-ABO-1512.html|website=Dictionary of Welsh Biography|publisher=National Library of Wales|last=Williams|first=Griffith John|accessdate=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dharmarajika Stupa''' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|دھرم راجک اسٹوپا}}}}), also referred to as the '''Great Stupa of Taxila''',  is a [[Buddhist]] [[stupa]] near [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]], [[Pakistan]]. It dates from the 2nd century CE,&lt;ref name=gounesco&gt;{{cite web|title=Dharmarajika: The Great Stupa of Taxila|url=http://www.gounesco.com/dharmarajika-great-stupa-of-taxila/|website=GoUNESCO|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=22 June 2017|date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was built to house small bone fragments of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]].&lt;ref name=scarre/&gt;&lt;ref name="ISBN_9781438109961"/&gt; The stupa, along with the large monastic complex that later developed around it, forms part of the [[Ruins of Taxila]] - which were inscribed as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taxila|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/139|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It has been claimed that that Dharmarajika Stupa was built over the remains of an even older stupa that had been built by the [[Maurya]]n emperor King ''[[Ashoka]]'' in the 3rd century BCE,&lt;ref name=gounesco/&gt; though other archeologists alternatively suggest that this is unlikely.&lt;ref name=kurt&gt;{{cite book|last1=Behrendt|first1=Kurt A.|title=Handbuch der Orientalistik|date=2004|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004135956}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indo-Greek]] coins found at the site date from the 2nd century BCE, suggesting earliest possible establishment of a religious monument at the site.&lt;ref name=kurt/&gt;

Small stupas that predate the main stupa are found throughout the Dharmarajika site, and surrounded an earlier core stupa in an irregular layout.&lt;ref name=kurt/&gt; It is known that the earlier core stupa contained a pathway for [[pradakshina|circumabulation]] that was made of plaster, and decorated with shell bangles in geometric patterns.&lt;ref name=kurt/&gt; The earlier stupa likely had four gates in axial directions.&lt;ref name=kurt/&gt;

The current stupa was believed to have been established in the 2nd century CE during the [[Kushan]] era in order to house [[relics of the Buddha]],&lt;ref name=gounesco/&gt; which may have been sourced from earlier monuments,&lt;ref name=scarre&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scarre|first1=Geoffrey | authorlink = Geoffrey Scarre |last2=Coningham|first2=Robin | author2link = Robin Coningham |title=Appropriating the Past: Philosophical Perspectives on the Practice of Archaeology|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521196062|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=djEKducJvNAC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=dharmarajika+taxila+relics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkxrnL0tLUAhUDw2MKHVDJDOQQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=dharmarajika%20taxila%20relics&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and originally buried at the site around 78 CE.&lt;ref name=scarre/&gt; Buddhist texts mention that [[frankincense]] was used during religious services at Dharmarajika, while the complex was paved with colourful glass tiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Silk Road in World History|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195338102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FJ8RDAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=sassanid+dharmarajika&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site came under control of Persian [[Sassanid]] rule, and suffered a period of stagnation.&lt;ref name=kurt/&gt; Large-scale developments took place during the late Kushan and [[Kidarite]] era which added numerous monasteries and stupas to the site.

===Destruction===
[[File:Dharmarajika Stupa plan.jpg|thumb|Plan of the Dharmarajika Stupa.]]
The site was devastated by the [[Hephthalite Empire|White Huns]] in the 5th century CE, and then abandoned.&lt;ref name="ISBN_9781438109961"/&gt; Subsequent rulers, such as the Hun king [[Mihirakula]], persecuted the region's Buddhists.&lt;ref name=kurt/&gt; Under his reign, over a thousand Buddhist monasteries throughout Gandhara are said to have been destroyed.&lt;ref name=kurt/&gt; The White Huns destroyed not only Taxilan sites, but also devastated nearby [[Peshawar]].

===Excavation===
The stupa was excavated by [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|Sir John Marshall]] in 1913. The stupa had been looted several times prior to Marshall's discovery, and was badly damaged.&lt;ref name=Le/&gt; Marshall noted that a large trench, requiring tremendous effort, was built at some point in the past in order to loot the stupa's precious relics.&lt;ref name=scarre/&gt; By 1934, enough of the site had been uncovered that the site's scale could be appreciated.&lt;ref name="ISBN_9781438109961"/&gt; Human skeletons were discovered in the open area immediately south of the stupa, and may be the remains of monks who were killed during the invasion of the [[Hephthalite Empire|White Huns]].

==Layout==

The location of the stupa and its monastic community about 1 kilometre outside of [[Sirkap]] aligns with ancient Gandharan beliefs that the Buddha recommended monasteries should be neither "too far" nor "too close" to adjacent towns.&lt;ref name=Le&gt;{{cite book|last1=Le|first1=Huu Phuoc|title=Buddhist Architecture|date=2010|publisher=Grafikol}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three distinctive types of masonry in the buildings around the main stupa suggest the contributions of different periods to the building activity.

===Core stupa===
[[File:((By @ibnAzhar))0DharmaRajika Stupa-Taxila-Pakistan (24).JPG|thumb|The passageway between the main stupa and several smaller stupas was used for the practice of ''[[pradakshina]]''.]]
Dharmarajika Stupa is the largest of all stupas in the Taxila region,&lt;ref name="ISBN_9781438109961"/&gt; Surrounding the main mound is a passageway for ''[[pradakshina]]''&amp;nbsp;— the ancient practice of walking around a holy site.

The stupa's large ''anda'', or hemispherical mound, is damaged − though the [[plinth]] of the mound, known as the ''medhi'', is still largely intact.&lt;ref name=Le/&gt; The ''anda'' mound was made of [[ashlar]] stone.&lt;ref name=Le/&gt; The stupa's ''harmika'', or fence like structure built atop the ''anda'' mound, has been lost.&lt;ref name=Le/&gt;

The stupa's southern gateway was initially considered the most important, though the construction of four smaller stupas (termed G7, G8, S7, Q1) to the west of the stupa indicate that this then likely became the preferred entrance for those performing circambulation.&lt;ref name=kurt/&gt; Later constructions around the "Eastern Avenue" then shifted the preferred route for circambulation to the eastern side of the stupa.&lt;ref name=kurt/&gt;

Before entering the main sacred areas, visitors to the shrine from Sirkap would pass through a large building, now termed building H, that would openly display relics.&lt;ref name=kurt/&gt; Visitors likely venerated the relics at building H before entering the main stupa area.&lt;ref name=kurt/&gt;

===Peripheral stupas===

The stupa was surrounded by a circle of smaller stupas which were built approximately 200 years after the main stupa's construction,&lt;ref name="ISBN_9781438109961"/&gt; and were likely constructed together as part of a project funded by a single patron.&lt;ref name=kurt/&gt;

Additional stupas were built further along the northern portion of the site by various patrons, and date from the [[Indo-Scythian]] period.&lt;ref name="ISBN_9781438109961"/&gt; These stupas form a "Northern Avenue," that had several small shrines with devotional images, rendering the Northern Avenue as a processional corridor.&lt;ref name=kurt/&gt; Devotional images were likely relegated to the periphery of the complex due to religious conservatives, who were hesitant to fully embrace the new practice of using imagery in religious practice.&lt;ref name=kurt/&gt;

Unlike constructions at [[Sanchi]], stupas around the Dharmarajika Stupa were built by individual donors, rather than as part of a communal effort.&lt;ref name=insoll&gt;{{cite book|last1=Insoll|first1=Timothy | authorlink = Timothy Insoll |title=Archaeology and World Religion|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134597987|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FTqCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=dharmarajika+taxila+relics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA7aPw09LUAhURwmMKHeB4Awo4ChDoAQg2MAM#v=onepage&amp;q=dharmarajika%20taxila%20relics&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monasteries===
[[File:Dharmarajika stupa and monastery j by Usman Ghani.jpg|thumb|Ruins of several monasteries are located around the main stupa.]]
Early monastic cells near the stupa were built as a row of rooms, with a [[verandah]],&lt;ref name=insoll/&gt; The verandah style was later dropped in favour of monastic living quarters surrounding [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]]s that were built immediately north, northeast, and east of the stupa approximately 300 years after the stupa's construction.&lt;ref name="ISBN_9781438109961"/&gt;

The northern monastery consisted of two courtyards that were each built around a large stupa.&lt;ref name=kurt/&gt; The smaller eastern courtyard is believed to have housed 13 monks.&lt;ref name="ISBN_9781438109961"/&gt;

Monastery G, located immediately west of the stupa has at least 50 monastic cells, a stupa, and was likely multistoried.&lt;ref name=kurt/&gt; Monastery M in the extreme northwest section of the site, and contained its own stupa in a small courtyard.&lt;ref name=kurt/&gt; Monastery M is connected to a long residential monastery,&lt;ref name=kurt/&gt; oriented in a roughly north-south direction. At the southern edge of this monastery are the remains of two stupas, now termed E1 and E2.&lt;ref name=kurt/&gt; E1 was built in a pre-existing cell, while E2 was a more elaborated stupa that contained a small passageway for circambulation.&lt;ref name=kurt/&gt; Neither stupa was likely open to the public.&lt;ref name=kurt/&gt;

==Relics==
===Bone fragments of the Buddha===
[[File:Dharmarajika statuette.jpg|thumb|130px|Statuette from the Dharmarajika site, now displayed at the [[Guimet Museum]] in [[Paris]].]]
The site is famous for its bone relics&amp;nbsp;– thought to be those of the Buddha,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=M. S. Moray|title=History of Buddhism in Gujarāt|date=1985|publisher=Saraswati Pustak Bhandar|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=foYEAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=buddha+bone+dharmarajika&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=+dharmarajika}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the stupa's precious relics had been looted by the time it was discovered by Sir John Marshall.&lt;ref name=scarre/&gt; A silver casket containing a silver inscription was recovered from the stupa's chapel after discovery,&lt;ref name=scarre/&gt; The inscription is written in the ancient [[Kharosthi]] script that was once common throughout Gandhara,&lt;ref name="ISBN_9781438109961"/&gt; The inscription states that ''Urusaka'' of ''Noacha'' placed bone relics of the Buddha in his chapel at Dharmarajika in 78 CE.&lt;ref name="ISBN_9781438109961"/&gt;

In 2016, 2 bone relics from the Dharmarajika Stupa were sent to [[Sri Lanka]] for one month. The relics were displayed at important shrines in [[Polonnaruwa]], [[Colombo]], [[Kandy]], and [[Anuradhapura]], and attracted 9.3 million visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sacred Buddha relics returns to Pakistan after month long exposition in Sri Lanka|url=http://www.colombopage.com/archive_16B/Jun27_1467037360CH.php|accessdate=23 June 2017|agency=Colombo Page|date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reliquary vessels===
18 reliquary vessels were also recovered from smaller stupas surrounding the Dharmarajika Stupa that yielded a wide array of relics, including one that encased a cylindrical piece of gold.&lt;ref name="ISBN_9781438109961"/&gt; Other reliquaries yielded gold jewelry and precious jewels,&lt;ref name="ISBN_9781438109961"/&gt; while others contained items from distant locations such as [[lapis lazuli]] from [[Afghanistan]], pearls, and shells − reflecting the large trade networks operating from Taxila.&lt;ref name="ISBN_9781438109961"/&gt; Several coins of the Indo-Greek king [[Zoilos II]] were found under the foundation of such a 1st-century BCE stupa.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, "Excavations at Taxila", "The only minor antiquities of interest found in this building were twenty-five debased silver coins of the Greek king Zoilus II, which were brought to light beneath the foundations of the earliest chapel", p248&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name Dharmarajika comes from Dharmaraja, a name given to Buddha who was the true Dharma Raja (Lord of Law), according to Marshall. It is also believed that ‘Dharmarajika’ is derived from the word ‘Dharmaraja’, a title used by Mauryan emperor Ashoka. The stupa is also popularly known as ''Chir Tope'', or "Scarred hill".

==Access==
The Dharmarajika Stupa lies about 3 kilometers east of the [[Taxila Museum]], along the PMO Colony Road, northeast of [[Taxila Cantonment]]. The stupa was located near the ancient city of '''[[Sirkap]]''',  which also forms part of the [[Ruins of Taxila]].

An '''emergency baptism''' is a [[baptism]] administered to a person in danger of death. This can be done by a person not normally authorized to administer the [[sacraments]]

==Catholic Church==
{{Seealso|Canon law (Catholic Church)}}
{{canon law}}
===Latin Church===
In the [[Latin Rite]] of the Catholic Church, the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church#Ordinary and extraordinary ministers of the sacraments|ordinary minister]] of baptism is a [[bishop]], [[priest]], or [[deacon]] ([http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2V.HTM canon 861 §1] of the [[Code of Canon Law]]), and in normal circumstances, only the parish priest of the person to be baptized, or someone authorized by the parish priest may do so licitly ([http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1T.HTM canon 530]). "If the ordinary minister is absent or impeded, a [[catechist]] or some other person deputed to this office by the local Ordinary, may lawfully confer baptism; indeed, in a case of necessity, any person who has the requisite intention may do so ([http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2V.HTM canon 861 §2]), even a non-Catholic or indeed a non-Christian.&lt;ref name="catholicencyclopedia" /&gt;

By "a case of necessity" is principally meant imminent danger of death because of either illness or an external threat. "The requisite intention" is, at the minimum level, the intention "to do what the Church does" through the rite of baptism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.todayscatholicworld.com/nov05tcw.htm#baptism&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin Rite considers that the effect of the sacrament is not produced by the person who baptizes, but by the [[Holy Spirit]].

===Eastern Catholic churches===
In the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], a deacon is not considered an ordinary minister of baptism. Administration of the sacrament is reserved, as in the Latin Church, to the parish priest. But, "in case of necessity, baptism can be administered by a deacon or, in his absence or if he is impeded, by another cleric, a member of an institute of consecrated life, or by any other Christian faithful; even by the mother or father, if another person is not available who knows how to baptize" ([http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0758/_P1Q.HTM canon 677] of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches.)

==Other Eastern churches==
The discipline of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] is similar to that of the Eastern Catholic Churches. As opposed to the Catholic Church, however, they require the baptizer, even in cases of necessity, to be of their own faith, on the grounds that a person cannot convey what he himself does not possess, in this case membership in the [[Christian Church|Church]].

==Protestantism==

===Anglicanism===
Similar provisions exist throughout the constituent churches of the Anglican Communion, of which the Episcopal Church in the United States of America is one example as below.

For the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], the 1979 [[Book of Common Prayer]] states that "Holy Baptism is especially appropriate at the [[Easter Vigil]], on the day of [[Pentecost]], on [[All Saints' Day]] or the Sunday after All Saints' day, and on the [[Baptism of the Lord|Feast of the Baptism of our Lord]] . . . It is recommended that, as far as possible, Baptisms be reserved for these occasions or when a bishop is present. If on any one of the above-named days the ministry of a bishop or priest cannot be obtained, the bishop may specially authorize a deacon to preside.  In that case, the deacon omits the prayer over the candidates, page 308, and the formula and action which follow."  The Book of Common Prayer also specifies under the heading "Emergency Baptism" the following:

"''In case of emergency, any baptized person may administer Baptism according to the following form. Using the given name of the one baptized (if known), pour water on him or her, saying''

"I baptize you in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

"The [[Lord's Prayer]] is then said.

"''Other prayers, such as the following, may be added''

"Heavenly Father, we thank you that by water and the Holy Spirit you have bestowed on upon this your servant the forgiveness of sin and have raised him to the new life of grace. Strengthen him, O Lord, with your presence, enfold him in the arms of your mercy, and keep him safe forever.

"''The person who administers emergency Baptism should inform the priest of the appropriate parish, so that the fact can be properly recorded.''

"''If the baptized person recovers, the Baptism should be recognized at a public celebration of the Sacrament with a bishop or priest presiding, and the person baptized under emergency conditions, together with the sponsors or godparents, taking part in everything except the administration of the water.''"

===Other Protestant denominations===
For [[Methodists]] and many other [[Protestant]] denominations, too, the ordinary minister of baptism is a duly ordained or appointed minister of [[religion]].

==Infants, babies, and fetuses==
The [[Roman Ritual]] declares that a child is not to be baptized while still enclosed (clausus) in its mother's womb, it supposes that the baptismal water cannot reach the body of the child. When, however, this seems possible, even with the aid of an instrument, [[Pope Benedict XIV|Benedict XIV]]&lt;ref&gt;Syn. Diaec., vii, 5&lt;/ref&gt; declares that midwives should be instructed to confer [[conditional baptism]]. The Ritual further says that when the water can flow upon the head of the infant the sacrament is to be administered absolutely; but if it can be poured only on some other part of the body, baptism is indeed to be conferred, but it must be conditionally repeated in case the child survives its birth, It is to be noted that in these last two cases, the rubric of the Ritual supposes that the infant has partly emerged from the womb. For if the fetus was entirely enclosed, baptism is to be repeated conditionally in all cases.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmkuhl, n, 61&lt;/ref&gt;

In case of the death of the mother, the fetus is to be immediately extracted and baptized, should there be any life in it. Infants have been taken alive from the womb well after the mother's death. After the Cæsarean incision has been performed, the fetus may be conditionally baptized before extraction if possible; if the sacrament is administered after its removal from the womb the baptism is to be absolute, provided it is certain that life remains. If after extraction it is doubtful whether it be still alive, it is to be baptized under the condition: "If thou art alive". According to Catholic teaching, the fetus is animated by a human soul from the very beginning of its conception. In cases of delivery where the issue is a mass that is not certainly animated by human life, it is to be baptized conditionally: "If thou art a man."&lt;ref name="catholicencyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia : baptism]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversial baptisms of Jews==
In 1858, [[Edgardo Mortara]], then six years old, was taken from his Jewish parents by the police of the [[Papal States]]. He had reportedly been [[baptism|baptized]] by a Roman Catholic servant girl of the family while he was ill, because she feared that otherwise he would not be saved if he died.

The [[Jewish orphans controversy]] is a legal dispute that occurred after the [[Second World War]] when the Holy See under [[Pope Pius XII]] issued instructions that Catholic institutions and families should keep baptized Jewish children in their ranks after they had been rescued from a likely deportation to [[Auschwitz]].

==Deathbed conversion==
A [[deathbed conversion]] is the adoption of a particular [[religious]] [[faith]] shortly before dying.  Making a [[Religious conversion|conversion]] on one's deathbed may reflect an immediate change of belief, a desire to formalize longer-term beliefs, or to complete a process of conversion already underway.

{{Usul al-fiqh}}

'''{{transl|ar|DIN|Ḥakīm}}''' and '''{{transl|ar|DIN|Ḥākim}}''' are two [[Arabic language|Arabic]] titles derived from the same [[triliteral]] root Ḥ-K-M "appoint, choose, judge".  Compare the Hebrew title [[hakham]].
Hakim density in ancient times were dealing with health..This is the only class of the society which had the knowledge of human physiology and anatomy..this class of the society is khown for their education and for their contribution in the field of health..

==Hakīm ({{lang|ar|حكيم}})==
This title is one of the [[99 names of Allah]].

Hakīm (alternative transcription Hakeem) indicates a "wise man" or "physician", or in general, a practitioner of [[herbal medicine]], especially of [[Unani]] and [[Medicine in the medieval Islamic world|Islamic medicine]], like [[Hakim Ajmal Khan]], [[Hakim Said]], [[Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman]], etc.

Hakīm was also used more generally during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] to refer to [[polymath]] scholars who were knowledgeable in religion, medicine, [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|the sciences]], and [[Islamic philosophy]].

Some Examples of Hakīm are:
* [[Ibn Sina]]
* [[Omar Khayyam]]

===Uses===
*In old [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] or [[Ethiopia]],  ''Hakim'' usually meant a learned person, usually a [[physician]]. Hence a ''Hakim-Bejt'' was a doctor's house or hospital
*In [[Pakistan]] and [[India]], ''Hakim'' or ''Hakeem'' denotes a herbal medicine practitioner, specially of [[Unani]] medicine.
*In [[Turkey]], ''hekim'' denotes a physician, while ''hakim'' can be used for a very wise person or philosopher. (See also the use of the [[homonym]]ous word ''hakim'' for a judge, mentioned below.)

==Hākim ({{lang|ar|حاكم}})==
Hākim (alternative transcription Hakem) means a ruler, [[governor]] or judge.  As with many titles, it also occurs as a part of the names of many individuals.

===In Arab countries===
*In [[Lebanon]], the full title of the [[Emir]]s under Ottoman (and a while Egyptian) sovereignty was '''al-Amir al-Hakim''' 1516–1842
*In three future [[Persian Gulf emirates]], the first monarchic style was hakim:
**since 1783 when the conquering Al Khalifah lineage settles on Bahrain to 16 August 1971, its style was ''Hakim al-Bahrayn'' "Ruler of [[Bahrain]]", then ''Amir Dawlat al-Bahrayn'' "Emir of the State of Bahrain", since 14 February 2002 [[Malik]] al-Bahrayn (King of Bahrain)
**in [[Kuwait]], since its 1752 founding, the ruling Al Sabah dynasty's style was ''Hakim al-Kuwayt'' "Ruler of Kuwait" (from 1871 also [[Kaymakam]], i.e. district administrator, while recognizing the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire (as ''kazan'' [district] of Baghdad [from 1875 [[Basra Vilayet|Basra]]] ''vilayet'' (seats of the governors, styled [[Wali]], in Iraq], till 3 November 1914, then under British [[protectorate]]) till the 19 June 1961 independence, after that (still) ''Amir ad-Dawlat'' al-Kuwayt "Emir of the State of Kuwait";
**since on Muhammad ibn Thani's 12 September 1868 treaty with the British, effectively establishing [[Qatar]] (previously considered to be a dependency of Bahrain) as an independent State (limited to Doha and Wakrah, only later expanded to the entire peninsula), his al-Thani dynasty's style was ''Hakim Qatar'' "Ruler of Qatar" (from 1871 also Kaymakam, i.e. Ottoman district administrator, cfr. above, till 3 November 1916, thereafter under British protectorate), since the 3 September 1971 independence from Britain ''Amir Dawlat'' Qatar "Emir of the State of Qatar".
*In [[Libya]], Hakim was the 1946 – 12 February 1950 style of the "ruler" of the former sultanate of [[Fezzan]] during the UN administration (in practice by France, with its own concurrent military governor); the only incumbent, Ahmad Sayf an-Nasr (b. c. 1876 – d. 1954), stayed on as regional [[Wali]] (governor; in French ''Chef du territoire'' "head of the territory") in the united [[United Kingdom of Libya|Libyan kingdom]] until 24 December 1951, with a French [[Resident (title)|Resident]] at his side, and then, without such French shadow, as first royal governor (until 1954).
*In [[Yemen]] till 1902 (changed to Sultan) the rulers of the Quaiti State of Shir and Mukalla, ash-Shihr Wa´l Mukalla, as before the 10 November 1881 merger with the Naqib of Mukalla's state it has been the princely style of ash-Shihr since independence from the Ottomans in 1866.

===Elsewhere===
*In the [[Makran]] region of [[Sistan and Baluchestan Province]] in [[Iran]], ''hakom'' refers to [[sardar]]s and [[Khan (title)|khans]] in the traditional [[Baluchistan|Baluchi]] government.&lt;ref name=salzman&gt;Philip Carl Salzman, [http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/mesh/files/2008/06/baluch_salzman1.pdf Politics and Change among the Baluch in Iran], June 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Turkey]], ''hakim'' denotes a judge.
*In [[Nepal]], a [[Bada Hakim]] was in charge of a district of the realm.
* In the [[Emirate of Bukhara]], ''hakem'' was the title of a governor.
* In [[Nigeria]], the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] is ceremonially governed by ''hakimai'', chiefs that are answerable to the Sultan of Sokoto and the Emirs of the realm.
* In [[Uzbekistan]] the term ''hokim'' is used to describe a governor or mayor of a region.

===Furthermore===
As with many titles, the word also occurs in many personal names, without any noble or political significance.

[[Vísir.is]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is Iceland's first major [[Hof (Germanic temple)|hof]] to the [[Norse mythology|Norse gods]] since the [[Viking Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Reuters in Reykjavik. 2 February 2015. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/02/iceland-temple-norse-gods-1000-years Iceland to build first temple to Norse gods since Viking age]. [[The Guardian]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is located on the southern slope of the hill [[Öskjuhlíð]], close to [[Reykjavík University]]. The project has been under development since 2005, but suffered several delays. It has been under construction since 2015.

== Architecture and design ==
Hof Ásatrúarfélagsins was designed by the Icelandic architect and [[Ásatrúarfélagið]] member [[Magnús Jensson]]. Jensson wanted the building to look timeless and neither be a [[Viking Age]] pastiche nor specifically modern.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;Neil McMahon. 14 February 2015. [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31437973 Iceland's Asatru pagans reach new height with first temple]. [[BBC]].&lt;/ref&gt; The aim was to represent a close relationship to earth, sky and sun.&lt;ref name="bi" /&gt; The design incorporates [[Numbers in Norse mythology|numbers]] and [[Sacred geometry|geometry]] considered sacred by Ásatrúarfélagið, such as the numbers nine, 432,000 and the [[golden ratio]].&lt;ref name="im2015"&gt;[https://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/news/2015/01/27/asatru_temple_rises_in_2016_2/ A religion that speaks to people today]. 27 January 2015. [[Morgunblaðið|Iceland Monitor]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The main part of the building will have an area of 350 square metres and hold a maximum of 250 people.&lt;ref name="im2015" /&gt; It has an oval shape and an inverted dome on top to let in sunlight which changes on a daily and seasonal basis. It is built into the side of the hill and uses natural rock as one of its walls, allowing water to flow down the stone wall and be collected in pools.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

The design allows the building to be expanded in the future. According to Ásatrúarfélagið's ''[[Allsherjargoði (Ásatrúarfélagið)|allsherjargoði]]'' [[Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson]], there are preliminary plans for an expansion which would allow Ásatrúarfélagið to provide a facility for international research on subjects related to mythology.&lt;ref name="birgir" /&gt;

== Development ==
[[File:Veturnáttablót 2009.JPG|thumb|A ceremony in 2009 at the location of the planned building]]
In 2005, Ásatrúarfélagið decided to sell its house in [[Reykjavík]] which it had acquired in 1998. The real-estate value had at this point increased so much that the organization's long-time goal of building a [[Hof (Germanic temple)|hof]] in Reykjavík for its activities had become a realistic project.&lt;ref&gt;Óttar Ottósson. [https://asatru.is/vor-sidur-2005-2 Af yfirlýsingum]. Vor siður, 2:2005&lt;/ref&gt; Ásatrúarfélagið originally applied for a plot of land for a religious building in [[Elliðaár]]dalur. Reykjavík's mayor [[Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir]] instead suggested a location on the hill [[Öskjuhlíð]], which Ásatrúarfélagið accepted in 2006.&lt;ref name="im2015" /&gt; However, this plot turned out to be within the safety zone of the [[Reykjavík Airport]], so a new location nearby, on the southern slope of the same hill, was assigned in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visir.is/g/200770820079/asatruarfelagid-faer-adra-lod-i-oskjuhlid Ásatrúarfélagið fær aðra lóð í Öskjuhlí]. 20 August 2007. [[Vísir.is]].&lt;/ref&gt; Ásatrúarfélagið and Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson were especially pleased by the proximity between this location and the [[Reykjavík University]].&lt;ref name="im2015" /&gt;

The land was donated by the city, while the construction funds were provided by Ásatrúarfélagið itself. When the building still was on a planning stage, the [[2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis|2008 Icelandig banking collapse]] took place, which resulted in substantial financial losses for Ásatrúarfélagið and the hof project was delayed by several years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visir.is/g/2010270017574/trufelog-ekki-enn-byrjud-ad-byggja Trúfélög ekki enn byrjuð að byggja]. 26 October 2010. [[Vísir.is]].&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015 Magnús Jensson's design for the building was eventually revealed and it was reported that construction was soon to begin. The building was reported to have a construction cost of 130 million [[Icelandic króna]]s.&lt;ref name="im2015" /&gt;

== Construction ==
The building is made of concrete and local wood.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; Construction broke ground at the [[solar eclipse of March 20, 2015|solar eclipse of 20 March 2015]], with the building originally projected to be finished in the late summer of 2016.&lt;ref name="im2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefán Árni Pálsson. 20 March 2015. [http://www.visir.is/g/2015150329942 Fyrsta skóflustungan að hofi Ásatrúarfélagsins: „Þetta mun breyta öllu fyrir okkur“]. [[Vísir.is]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the complicated design has caused technical problems and further delays. In December 2017 it was expected to be finished by the end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/culture_and_living/2017/12/02/iceland_s_first_pagan_temple_in_1000_years_ready_in/ Iceland's first pagan temple in 1000 years ready in late 2018]. 2 December 2017. [[Morgunblaðið|Iceland Monitor]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
The name used in the media and promotional material, "hof Ásatrúarfélagsins", is descriptive and simply means "The Asatru Fellowship's hall" or "The Asatru Fellowship's temple". The fellowship has asked the public for proposals for the building's official name, but the final decision will be taken shortly before the consecration.&lt;ref&gt;Guðmundur Magnússon. 30 November 2017.

A [[Christian denomination]] is a distinct [[religion|religious]] body within [[Christianity]], identified by traits such as a name, [[Ecclesiastical polity|organization]], leadership and [[doctrine]]. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church or sometimes [[Communion (Christian)|fellowship]]. Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine; issues such as the [[Christology|nature of Jesus]], the authority of [[apostolic succession]], [[Christian eschatology|eschatology]], and [[papal primacy]] may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations—often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties—are sometimes known as "branches of Christianity" or "denominational families" (e.g. [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] or [[Western Christianity]] and their sub-branches).

This is not a complete list, but aims to provide a comprehensible overview of the diversity among denominations of Christianity. Only those Christian denominations or organizations with Wikipedia articles will be listed in order to ensure that all entries on this list are notable and verifiable. The denominations or organizations listed are ordered from ancient to contemporary Christianity.

==Terminology and qualification==
Some groups included on this list do not consider themselves denominations. For example, the [[Catholic Church]] considers itself the [[one true church]] and the [[Holy See]], as pre-denominational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20000806_dominus-iesus_en.html|title=Dominus Iesus|publisher=[[Vatican.va]]|accessdate=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] also considers itself the original Church, and pre-denominational.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oca.org/questions/history/the-original-christian-church|title=The Original Christian Church - Questions &amp; Answers|website=oca.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; To express further the complexity involved, the Catholic and Orthodox churches were historically one and the same, as evidenced by the fact that they are the only two modern churches in existence to accept all of the [[first seven ecumenical councils]], until differences arose, such as [[Papal primacy|papal authority]] and dominance, the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], the continuance of emperors in the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]], and the final and permanent split that occurred during the [[Crusades]] with the [[Sack of Constantinople (1204)|siege of Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2016/02/12/the-differences-between-the-catholic-and-orthodox-churches|title=The differences between the Catholic and Orthodox churches|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also illustrates that denominations can arise not only from religious or theological issues, but political and generational divisions as well.

Other groups that are viewed by non-adherents as denominational are highly decentralized and do not have any formal denominational structure, authority, or record-keeping beyond the local congregation; several groups within the [[Restoration Movement]] fall into this category.

Some groups are large (e.g. [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] or [[Baptists]]), while others are just a few small churches, and in most cases the relative size is not evident in this list except for the denominational group or movement as a whole (e.g. [[Church of the East]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], Lutheranism or the [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saints]]). The largest group is the Catholic Church with more than 1.29 billion members.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/it/bollettino/pubblico/2018/06/13/0440/00957.html|title=Presentazione dell’Annuario Pontificio 2018 e dell’ “Annuarium Statisticum Ecclesiae” 2016|website=press.vatican.va|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smallest of these groups may have only a few dozen adherents or an unspecified number of participants in independent churches as described below. As such, specific numbers and a certain size may not define a group as a denomination. However, as a general rule, the larger a group becomes, the more acceptance and legitimacy it gains.

Modern movements such as [[Christian fundamentalism]], [[Pietism]], [[Evangelicalism]], the [[Holiness movement]] and [[Pentecostalism]] sometimes cross denominational lines, or in some cases create new denominations out of two or more continuing groups (as is the case for many [[United and uniting churches]], for example). Such subtleties and complexities are not clearly depicted here.

Between denominations, theologians, and comparative religionists there are considerable disagreements about which groups can be properly called Christian or a Christian denomination as disagreements arise primarily from doctrinal differences between groups. As an example, this list contains groups also known as "rites" which many, such as the Catholic Church, would say are not denominations as they are in full papal [[Communion (religion)|communion]], and thus part of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/catholic_rites_and_churches.htm|title=Catholic Rites and Churches|website=www.ewtn.com|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the purpose of simplicity, this list is intended to reflect the self-understanding of each denomination. Explanations of different opinions concerning their status as Christian denominations can be found at their respective articles.

There is no official recognition in most parts of the world for religious bodies, and there is no official clearinghouse which could determine the status or respectability of religious bodies. Often there is considerable disagreement between various churches about whether other churches should be labeled with pejorative terms such as "[[cult]]", or about whether this or that group enjoys some measure of respectability. Such considerations often vary from place to place, or culture to culture, where one religious group may enjoy majority status in one region, but be widely regarded as a "dangerous cult" in another part of the world. Inclusion on this list does not indicate any judgment about the size, importance, or character of a group or its members.

===Early Christianity===
{{Main|Early Christianity|Christianity in the 1st century|History of early Christianity|List of Gnostic sects}}
Early Christianity is often divided into three different branches that differ in theology and traditions, which all appeared in the 1st century AD. They include [[Jewish Christian]]ity, [[Pauline Christianity]] and [[Christian Gnosticism|Gnostic Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_brief2.htm|title=Fragmentation of the  primitive Christian movement|work=Religious Tolerance|accessdate=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; All modern Christian denominations are said to have descended from the Jewish and Pauline Christianities, with Gnostic Christianity dying, or being hunted, out of existence after the early Christian era and being largely forgotten until discoveries made in the late 19th and early twentieth centuries. There are also other theories on the [[Origins of Christianity|origin of Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.earlychristianhistory.info/frac.html|title=Early Christian History|accessdate=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following Christian groups appeared between the beginning of the Christian religion and the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325.

* [[Adamites]]
* [[Arianism]]
* [[Ebionites]]
* [[Elcesaites]]
* [[Marcionism]]
* [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]]

Unlike the previously mentioned groups, the following are all considered to be related to Christian Gnosticism.

===Late ancient and Medieval Christian groups===
{{Main article|History of late ancient Christianity|History of Christianity during the Middle Ages}}
The following are groups of Christians appearing between the First Council of Nicaea, the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] and [[Proto-Protestantism]].

====Church of the East====
{{further information|Church of the East|Nestorianism|Schism of 1552}}
The Church of the East split from the Parthian Church during the [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid Period]].

=====Assyrian Christianity=====
Assyrian Christianity comprises churches who keep the traditional [[Nestorian]] [[Christology]] and [[ecclesiology]] of the historical Church of the East after the original church reunited with the Catholic Church, forming the Chaldean Catholic Church in 1552. The Assyrian Church of the East and the Ancient Church of the East together have 0.6 million members.

==== Oriental Orthodoxy ====
{{Further information|Oriental Orthodoxy}}
Oriental Orthodoxy comprises those Christians who did not accept the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Popular Encyclopedia of Church History|last=|first=|publisher=Harvest House Publishers|year=2013|isbn=978-0-7369-4806-7|location=|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other denominations often erroneously label these churches "[[Monophysite]]"; however, as the Oriental Orthodox do not adhere to the teachings of [[Eutyches]], they themselves reject this label, preferring the term [[Miaphysite]]. Some of these churches, especially the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] claim origination by [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]] and his 1st-century missionary journeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Two Thousand years of Coptic Christianity|last=Meinardus|first=Otto F. A.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, many of the Oriental Orthodox churches consider themselves collectively to be the [[Four Marks of the Church|One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church]] that Christ founded. Some have considered the Oriental Orthodox communion to be a part of the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church, a view which is gaining increasing acceptance in the wake of [[Ecumenism|ecumenical dialogues]]. Oriental Orthodoxy forms the fourth largest communion of Christian churches, with approximately 76 million members.

==Roman Catholic==
{{main article|Catholic Church|Catholic particular churches and liturgical rites}}
The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is composed of 24 autonomous ''[[sui iuris]]'' [[particular church]]es: the [[Latin Church]] and the 23 [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. The Catholic Church considers itself the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church that [[Christ]] founded,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070629_responsa-quaestiones_en.html| title=Responses to Some Questions Regarding Certain Aspects of the Doctrine on the Church| publisher=[[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which [[Saint Peter]] initiated along with the missionary work of [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] and others. As such, the Catholic Church does not consider itself a denomination, but rather considers itself pre-denominational, the original Church of Christ. Continuity is claimed based upon [[apostolic succession]] with the early Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|last=|first=|publisher=Vatican City: Catholic Church|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=77,861}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic population exceeds 1.29 billion as of 2016.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Latin, or Western Catholic Church, is the largest and most widely known of the 24 [[Particular Church#Autonomous particular Churches or Rites|''sui iuris'' churches]] that together make up the [[Catholic Church]] (not to be confused with the [[Roman Rite]], which is one of the [[Latin liturgical rites]], not a [[particular church]]).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 2015, the Latin Church composed 1.255 billion members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2017/04/06/170406e.html|title=The Pontifical Yearbook 2017 and the “Annuarium Statisticum Ecclesiae” 2015|website=press.vatican.va|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further information|Eastern Catholic Churches}}
All of the following are [[Particular Church|particular church]]es of the Catholic Church. They are all in [[Full communion|communion]] with the Pope as Bishop of Rome and acknowledge his claim of universal jurisdiction and authority. They have some minor distinct theological emphases and expressions (for instance, in the case of those that are of Greek/Byzantine tradition, concerning some non-doctrinal aspects of the Latin view of [[Purgatory]]).&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Dragani, ''[http://www.east2west.org/doctrine.htm#Purgatory From East to West]''&lt;/ref&gt; The Eastern Catholic Churches and the Latin Church (which together compose the worldwide Catholic Church) share the same doctrine and sacraments, and thus the same faith. The total membership of the churches accounts for approximately 18 million members.

The Eastern Orthodox Church consists of jurisdictions in communion with each other. The church has over 250 million members, making it the second largest church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://christianity.about.com/od/easternorthodoxy/p/orthodoxprofile.htm|title=Who Are Eastern Orthodox Christians and What Do They Believe?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them have a disputed administrative status (i.e. their autonomy or [[autocephaly]] is only partially recognized), but all remain in communion with each other as one church. The Orthodox claim continuity (based upon [[apostolic succession]]) with the early Church, and consider themselves pre-denominational, being the original Church of Christ before 1054.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/archdiocese/about|title=About the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America - Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|website=www.goarch.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Proto-Protestant ==
{{Main articles|Proto-Protestantism}}
Proto-Protestantism refers to individuals and movements that propagated ideas similar to Protestantism before 1517, when [[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546) initiated the Protestant Reformation. Major representatives were [[Peter Waldo]] (c. 1140–c. 1205), [[John Wycliffe]] (1320s–1384), [[Jan Hus]] (c. 1369–1415) and the movements they started.{{Div col}}

==Protestant==
{{main article|Protestantism|Reformation}}
This list includes a variety of Protestant denominations which separated from the Catholic Church during the Reformation, as well as their further divisions.&lt;ref&gt;"Protestant, I.2.a" ''Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; A denomination labeled "Protestant" subscribes to the fundamental Protestant principles—though not always—that is scripture alone, justification by faith alone and the universal priesthood of believers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lmsusa.org/sola.pdf|title=The "Solas" of the Reformation|last=|first=|date=|website=Lmsusa.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list gives only an overview, and certainly does not mention all of the Protestant denominations. The exact number of Protestant denominations, including the members of the denominations, is difficult to calculate and depends on definition. A group that fits the generally accepted definition of "Protestant" might not officially use the term. Therefore, it should be taken with caution.

The majority of Protestants are members of just a handful of denominational families: Adventism, Anglicanism, Baptists, Calvinism (Reformed tradition), Lutheranism, Methodism and Pentecostalism.

[[Nondenominational Christianity|Nondenominational]], Evangelical, [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic]], [[Neo-charismatic movement|neo-charismatic]], independent and other churches are on the rise, and constitute a significant part of Protestant Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oikoumene.org/en/church-families/evangelical-churches World Council of Churches: Evangelical churches]: "Evangelical churches have grown exponentially in the second half of the 20th century and continue to show great vitality, especially in the global South. This resurgence may in part be explained by the phenomenal growth of Pentecostalism and the emergence of the charismatic movement, which are closely associated with evangelicalism. However, there can be no doubt that the evangelical tradition "per se" has become one of the major components of world Christianity. Evangelicals also constitute sizable minorities in the traditional Protestant and Anglican churches. In regions like Africa and Latin America, the boundaries between "evangelical" and "mainline" are rapidly changing and giving way to new ecclesial realities."&lt;/ref&gt; The most accepted figure among various authors and scholars includes around 900 million Protestant Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2011/12/Christianity-fullreport-web.pdf|title=Pewforum: Christianity (2010)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gordonconwell.edu/resources/documents/1IBMR2015.pdf|title=Christianity 2015: Religious Diversity and Personal Contact|last=|first=|date=|website=gordonconwell.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Latter Day Saint movement====

{{see also|List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|Mormonism and Christianity}}
Most Latter Day Saint denominations are derived from the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] established by [[Joseph Smith]] in 1830. The largest worldwide denomination of this movement, and the one publicly recognized as [[Mormonism]], is [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. Some sects, known as the "Prairie Saints", broke away because they did not recognize [[Brigham Young]] as the head of the church, and did not follow him West in the mid-1800s. Other sects broke away over the abandonment of practicing [[Mormonism and polygamy|plural marriage]] after the [[1890 Manifesto]]. Other denominations are defined by either a belief in Joseph Smith as a [[prophet]] or acceptance of the [[Book of Mormon]] as [[religious text|scripture]]. The Latter Day Saints comprise a little over 16 million members collectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/15-million-member-milestone-announced-at-churchs-general-conference|title=15 Million Member Milestone Announced at LDS Church Conference|date=2013-10-05|work=www.mormonnewsroom.org|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="182460">In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), the '''[[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]]''' (also known as the '''Quorum of the Twelve''', the '''Council of the Twelve Apostles''', or simply the '''Twelve''') is one of the governing bodies in the church hierarchy. The [[Quorum (Latter Day Saints)|quorum]] was first organized in 1835 and designated as a body of "traveling councilors".  The following are the current and previous members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in the LDS Church.

==List notes==
This list only includes individuals who have served in the Quorum.  This list is organized by current Quorum members, original Quorum members, then by date of appointment to the Quorum, and then by last name.  Members of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], which include the [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of the Church]] and his counselors, are usually not part of the Quorum, and a calling to the First Presidency usually entails leaving the Quorum. Exceptions to this rule are noted. It is also possible to be ordained to the priesthood office of [[Apostle (LDS Church)|Apostle]] without automatic membership in the Quorum of the Twelve, or to serve in the First Presidency without having been ordained an Apostle. Such individuals who never became members of the Quorum do not appear in the last section of this page.

The begin and end dates represent when an individual first joined (typically corresponding to an ordination date) and last belonged to the Quorum.  Strictly speaking, members of the First Presidency rejoin the Quorum temporarily when a Church President dies, and before a successor is named.  For simplicity, this list does not consider these periods in determining the end date.  On occasion, a quorum member has left the Quorum for a time and later rejoined it; this is noted where applicable.

Additional positions held appears with each member, including, Counselor in the First Presidency ("First Counselor," etc.), [[President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] ("Quorum President"), [[Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] ("Acting Quorum President"), [[President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] ("Church President"), and [[Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve]]. A Quorum President is not a member of the Quorum if he is serving in the First Presidency. In those circumstances, an Acting President is typically called, as noted.

==Apostles who were never members of the Quorum of the Twelve==
The following men were ordained to the priesthood office of Apostle but were never members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.&lt;ref&gt;This list does not include [[Joseph F. Smith]], [[Brigham Young, Jr.]], and [[Sylvester Q. Cannon]], who were each ordained as apostles but not made members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles until a later date.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some, but not all, served in the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] of the LDS Church.
&lt;!-- Do not add the Apostle Paul to this list. While the LDS Church believes him to be a leader appointed by Christ, Paul was not a "latter-day" church leader. Thank you. --&gt;

Yoga, rather than being the name for a singular lineage or even a specific practice, is a bracket term that covers a number of methodologies, each with a number of schools. Within the major branches of yoga such as [[hatha yoga|haṭha]], [[laya yoga|lāya]], [[raja yoga|rāja]], [[jnana yoga|jñāna]], and [[bhakti]] there are many different schools and lineages, both extant and defunct. Since the late 19th century, a great number of distinct new styles of "[[Yoga]]" have been introduced by individual teachers. There are also a number of schools and traditions that are occasionally referred to as yoga or yogic for their similar practices despite having no foundation in the Indian tradition such as [[Shin Shin Tōitsu-dō]], and [[Daoyin]].

==Modern Hinduism and Neo-Hindu revival==
The term "Yoga" has been used for various philosophies and concepts in the context of [[Hindu revivalism]] and [[Hinduism in the West|Neo-Hindu]] religious and philosophical movements.

{{Marcus Aurelius}}
'''Marcus Aurelius''' ({{IPAc-en|ɔː|ˈ|r|iː|l|i|ə|s}}; {{lang-la|Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus}}; 26 April 121 – 17 March 180 AD), called '''the Philosopher''', was [[Roman emperor]] from {{no wrap|161 to 180}}. [[Early life of Marcus Aurelius|He was adopted]] by [[Antoninus Pius]], whose daughter [[Faustina the Younger|Faustina]] he married and whom he and his adoptive brother, [[Lucius Verus]], succeeded. He ruled the [[Roman Empire]] with Lucius until Lucius' death in 169, and with his son by Faustina, [[Commodus]], from 177. He was the last of the rulers traditionally known as the [[Five Good Emperors]]. He was a practitioner of [[Stoicism]], and his personal philosophical writings, which later came to be called ''[[Meditations]]'', are a significant source of the modern understanding of ancient Stoic philosophy. 

During [[Reign of Marcus Aurelius|his reign]], the Empire [[Roman–Parthian War of 161–166|defeated]] a revitalized [[Parthian Empire]] in the East; Marcus' general [[Avidius Cassius]] sacked the Parthian capital [[Ctesiphon]] in 164. In central Europe, Marcus fought the [[Marcomanni]], [[Quadi]], and [[Sarmatians]] with success during the [[Marcomannic Wars]], although the threat of the [[Germanic peoples]] began to represent a troubling reality for the Empire. The [[Column of Marcus Aurelius|Column]] and [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius]] still stand in Rome, where they were erected in celebration of his military victories. Persecution of [[Christian]]s is said to have increased during his reign. The [[Antonine Plague]], a [[pandemic]] that broke out in 165, devastated the [[Demography of the Roman Empire|population of the Roman Empire]] and may have been the cause of death for his co-ruler Lucius. Marcus' death in 180 is seen as an end to the [[Pax Romana]], an age of relative peace and stability for the Empire.

==Sources==
The major sources depicting the life and rule of Marcus are patchy and frequently unreliable. The most important group of sources, the biographies contained in the ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'', claim to be written by a group of authors at the turn of the 4th century AD, but were in fact written by a single author (referred to here as "the biographer") from about 395 AD. The later biographies and the biographies of subordinate emperors and usurpers are unreliable, but the earlier biographies, derived primarily from now-lost earlier sources ([[Marius Maximus]] or Ignotus), are much more accurate.&lt;ref name="Birley, 1889"&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 229–30. The thesis of single authorship was first proposed in H. Dessau's "Über Zeit und Persönlichkeit der ''Scriptoes Historiae Augustae''" (in German), ''Hermes'' 24 (1889), pp. 337ff.&lt;/ref&gt; For Marcus' life and rule, the biographies of [[Hadrian]], [[Antoninus Pius|Antoninus]], Marcus, and [[Lucius Verus|Lucius]] are largely reliable, but those of [[Aelius Verus]] and [[Avidius Cassius]] are not.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 230. On the ''HA Verus'', see Barnes, pp. 65–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

A body of correspondence between Marcus' tutor Fronto and various Antonine officials survives in a series of patchy manuscripts, covering the period from c. 138 to 166.&lt;ref&gt;Beard; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus' own ''Meditations'' offer a window on his inner life, but are largely undateable, and make few specific references to worldly affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; The main narrative source for the period is [[Cassius Dio]], a Greek senator from [[Bithynian]] [[Nicaea]] who wrote a history of Rome from its founding to 229 in eighty books. Dio is vital for the military history of the period, but his senatorial prejudices and strong opposition to imperial expansion obscure his perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 228–29, 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other literary sources provide specific details: the writings of the physician [[Galen]] on the habits of the Antonine elite, the orations of [[Aelius Aristides]] on the temper of the times, and the constitutions preserved in the ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]]'' and ''[[Codex Justinianus]]'' on Marcus' legal work.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 227–28.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epigraphy|Inscriptions]] and [[numismatics|coin finds]] supplement the literary sources.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

His name at birth was supposedly Marcus Annius Verus,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=wyKaVFZqbdUC&amp;pg=PA693&amp;dq=Marcus+Aurelius+was+born+in+Rome+april+26#v=onepage&amp;q=Marcus%20Aurelius%20was%20born%20in%20Rome%20april%2026&amp;f=false | title=Dictionary of World Biography| isbn=9781579580407| last1=Magill| first1=Frank Northen| date=2003-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some sources assign this name to him upon his father's death and adoption by his grandfather, upon his coming of age,&lt;ref name="Historia MA I.9–10"&gt;''Historia'' MA I.9–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Ackeren, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 33"&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; or at the time of his marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Dio 69.21.1; ''HA Marcus'' i. 10; McLynn, ''Marcus Aurelius: Warrior, Philosopher, Emperor'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; He may have been known as Marcus Annius Catilius Severus,&lt;ref&gt;Dio lxix.21.1; ''HA Marcus'' i. 9; McLynn, ''Marcus Aurelius: Warrior, Philosopher, Emperor'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; at birth or at some point in his youth,&lt;ref name="Historia MA I.9–10"&gt;''Historia'' MA I.9–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 33"/&gt; or Marcus Catilius Severus Annius Verus.

===Family origins===
[[File:Young Marcus Aurelius Musei Capitolini MC279.jpg|thumb|A bust of Marcus Aurelius as a young boy ([[Capitoline Museum]]). [[Anthony Birley]], his modern biographer, writes of the bust: "This is certainly a grave young man."&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=Bust of a young Marcus Aurelius]]

Marcus' family originated in [[Espejo, Córdoba|Ucubi]], a small town southeast of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] in Iberian [[Baetica]]. The family rose to prominence in the late 1st century AD. Marcus Aurelius' great-grandfather Marcus Annius Verus (I) was a [[Roman Senate|senator]] and (according to the ''Historia Augusta'') ex-[[praetor]]; in 73–74, his grandfather, [[Marcus Annius Verus|Marcus Annius Verus (II)]], was made a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]].&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' i. 2, 4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 28; McLynn, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Cassius Dio asserts that the Annii were near-kin of Hadrian, and that it was to these familial ties that they owed their rise to power.&lt;ref&gt;Dio 69.21.2, 71.35.2–3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The precise nature of these kinship ties is nowhere stated. One conjectural bond runs through Annius Verus (II). Verus' wife [[Rupilia|Rupilia Faustina]] was the daughter of the consular senator [[Libo Rupilius Frugi]] and an unnamed mother. It has been hypothesized Rupilia Faustina's mother was [[Salonina Matidia|Matidia]], who was also the mother (presumably through another marriage) of [[Vibia Sabina]], Hadrian's wife.&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Inscriptionum Latinarum'' [http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=CIL+14,+03579&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 14.3579] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429224027/http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=CIL+14,+03579&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle |date=29 April 2012 }}; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 29; McLynn, pp. 14, 575 n. 53, citing Ronald Syme, ''Roman Papers'' 1.244.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} Verus' elder son—Marcus Aurelius' father—[[Marcus Annius Verus (praetor)|Marcus Annius Verus (III)]] married [[Domitia Lucilla]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 29; McLynn, ''Marcus Aurelius: Warrior, Philosopher, Emperor'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucilla was the daughter of the patrician P. Calvisius Tullus Ruso. Her mother, also Domitia Lucilla, had inherited a great fortune (described at length in one of [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]]'s letters) from her maternal grandfather and her paternal grandfather by adoption.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 29, citing Pliny, ''Epistulae'' 8.18.&lt;/ref&gt; The younger Lucilla would acquire much of her mother's wealth, including a large brickworks on the outskirts of Rome—a profitable enterprise in an era when the city was experiencing a construction boom.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood===
[[File:Young Marcus Aurelius.jpg|thumb|Statue of young Marcus Aurelius from a private collection housed in the [[San Antonio Museum of Art]]|alt=Statue of a young Marcus Aurelius]]
Marcus' sister, [[Annia Cornificia Faustina]], was probably born in 122 or 123.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 31, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; His father probably died in 124, during his praetorship, when Marcus was three years old.&lt;ref name="Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 31"&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Farquharson dates his death to 130, when Marcus was nine.&lt;ref&gt;Farquharson, 1.95–96.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} Though he can hardly have known his father, Marcus wrote in his ''Meditations'' that he had learned "modesty and manliness" from his memories of his father and from the man's posthumous reputation.&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' 1.1, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother Lucilla did not remarry.&lt;ref name="Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 31"/&gt;

Lucilla, following prevailing aristocratic customs, probably did not spend much time with her son. Instead, Marcus was in the care of "nurses".&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' ii. 1 and ''Meditations'' v. 4, qtd. in Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, Marcus credits his mother with teaching him "religious piety, simplicity in diet", and how to avoid "the ways of the rich".&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' i. 3, qtd. in Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; In his letters, he makes frequent and affectionate reference to her; he was grateful that, "although she was fated to die young, yet she spent her last years with me".&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' i. 17.7, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his father's death, Marcus was raised by his paternal grandfather Marcus Annius Verus, who had always retained the legal authority of ''[[patria potestas]]'' over his son and grandson. Technically this was not an adoption, the creation of a new and different ''patria potestas''. [[Lucius Catilius Severus]], described as Marcus' maternal great-grandfather, also participated in his upbringing; he was probably the elder Domitia Lucilla's stepfather.&lt;ref name="Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 33"/&gt; Marcus was raised in his parents' home on the [[Caelian Hill]], a district he would affectionately refer to as "my Caelian".&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' ii. 8.2 (= Haines 1.142), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was an upscale area, with few public buildings but many aristocratic villas. Marcus' grandfather owned a palace beside the [[Lateran Palace|Lateran]], where he would spend much of his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus Aurelius thanks his grandfather for teaching him "good character and avoidance of bad temper".&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' i. 1, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; He was less fond of the mistress his grandfather took and lived with after the death of his wife, Rupilia Faustina.&lt;ref name="Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 35"&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus Aurelius was grateful that he did not have to live with her longer than he did.&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' i. 17.2; Farquharson, 1.102; McLynn, ''Marcus Aurelius: Warrior, Philosopher, Emperor'', p. 23; cf. ''Meditations'' i. 17.11; Farquharson, 1.103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus was educated at home, in line with contemporary aristocratic trends;&lt;ref&gt;McLynn, ''Marcus Aurelius: Warrior, Philosopher, Emperor'', 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; he thanks Catilius Severus for encouraging him to avoid public schools.&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' 1.4; McLynn, ''Marcus Aurelius: Warrior, Philosopher, Emperor'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his teachers, Diognetus, a painting master, proved particularly influential; he seems to have introduced Marcus Aurelius to the philosophic way of life.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' ii. 2, iv. 9; ''Meditations'' i. 3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 37; McLynn, ''Marcus Aurelius: Warrior, Philosopher, Emperor'', pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 132, at the behest of Diognetus, Marcus took up the dress and habits of the philosopher: he studied while wearing a rough [[Pallium (Roman cloak)|Greek cloak]], and would sleep on the ground until his mother convinced him to sleep on a bed.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' ii. 6; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 38; McLynn, ''Marcus Aurelius: Warrior, Philosopher, Emperor'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new set of tutors—[[Alexander of Cotiaeum]], [[Trosius Aper]], and [[Tuticius Proculus]]{{refn|Birley amends the text of the ''HA Marcus'' from "Eutychius" to "Tuticius".&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Lives of the Later Caesars'', pp. 109, 109 n.8; ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 40, 270 n.27, citing ''Bonner Historia-Augusta Colloquia'' 1966/7, pp. 39ff.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}}—took over Marcus' education in about 132 or 133.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' ii. 3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 40, 270 n.27.&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known of the latter two (both teachers of Latin), but Alexander was a major littérateur, the leading [[Homer]]ic scholar of his day.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 40, citing Aelius Aristides, ''Oratio'' 32 K; McLynn, ''Marcus Aurelius: Warrior, Philosopher, Emperor'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus thanks Alexander for his training in literary styling.&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' i. 10; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 40; McLynn, ''Marcus Aurelius: Warrior, Philosopher, Emperor'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander's influence—an emphasis on matter over style and careful wording, with the occasional Homeric quotation—has been detected in Marcus Aurelius' ''Meditations''.&lt;ref&gt;Birley,  ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 40, 270 n.28, citing A.S.L. Farquharson, ''The Meditations of Marcus Antoninus'' (Oxford, 1944) ii. 453.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 136, Hadrian almost died from a [[Bleeding|haemorrhage]]. Convalescent in [[Hadrian's Villa|his villa]] at [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]], he selected Lucius Ceionius Commodus, Marcus' intended father-in-law, as his successor and adopted son&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt; ''invitis omnibus'', "against the wishes of everyone".&lt;ref&gt;''HA Hadrian'' xiii. 10, qtd. in Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; While his motives are not certain, it would appear that his goal was to eventually place the then-too-young Marcus on the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 42. Van Ackeren, 142. On the succession to Hadrian, see also: T.D. Barnes, "Hadrian and Lucius Verus", ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 57:1–2 (1967): 65–79; J. VanderLeest, "Hadrian, Lucius Verus, and the Arco di Portogallo", ''Phoenix'' 49:4 (1995): pp. 319–30.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his adoption, Commodus took the name Lucius Aelius Caesar. His health was so poor that, during a ceremony to mark his becoming heir to the throne, he was too weak to lift a large shield on his own.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Aelius'' vi. 2-3&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief stationing on the [[Danube]] frontier, Aelius returned to Rome to make an address to the senate on the first day of 138. The night before the speech, however, he grew ill, and died of a haemorrhage later in the day.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Hadrian'' xxiii. 15–16; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 45; "Hadrian to the Antonines", 148.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Commodus was a known consumptive at the time of his adoption, so Hadrian may have intended Marcus' eventual succession anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Dio, lxix.17.1; ''HA Aelius'', iii. 7, iv. 6, vi. 1–7; Birley, "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}}

On 24 January 138, Hadrian selected Aurelius Antoninus, the husband of Marcus' aunt [[Faustina the Elder]], as his new successor.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 46. Date: Birley, "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of Hadrian's terms, Antoninus in turn adopted Marcus and Lucius Verus, the son of Lucius Aelius.&lt;ref&gt;Weigel.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus became M. Aelius Aurelius Verus, and Lucius became L. Aelius Aurelius Commodus. At Hadrian's request, Antoninus' daughter Faustina was betrothed to Lucius.&lt;ref&gt;Dio 69.21.1; ''HA Hadrian'' xxiv. 1; ''HA Aelius'' vi. 9; ''HA Antoninus Pius'' iv. 6–7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus reportedly greeted the news that Hadrian had become his adoptive grandfather with sadness, instead of joy. Only with reluctance did he move from his mother's house on the Caelian to Hadrian's private home.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' v. 3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

At some time in 138, Hadrian requested in the senate that Marcus be exempt from the law barring him from becoming ''[[quaestor]]'' before his twenty-fourth birthday. The senate complied, and Marcus served under Antoninus, the consul for 139.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus' adoption diverted him from the typical career path of his class. If not for his adoption, he probably would have become ''[[Triumvir Monetalis|triumvir monetalis]]'', a highly regarded post involving token administration of the state mint; after that, he could have served as [[military tribune|tribune with a legion]], becoming the legion's nominal second-in-command. Marcus probably would have opted for travel and further education instead. As it was, Marcus was set apart from his fellow citizens. Nonetheless, his biographer attests that his character remained unaffected: "He still showed the same respect to his relations as he had when he was an ordinary citizen, and he was as thrifty and careful of his possessions as he had been when he lived in a private household."&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' v. 6–8, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Turner]], ''The Bay of Baiae, with Apollo and Sybil'', 1823)|alt=Painting depicting the beach of the town of Baiae]]

After a series of suicide attempts, all thwarted by Antoninus, Hadrian left for [[Baiae]], a seaside resort on the [[Campania]]n coast. His condition did not improve, and he abandoned the diet prescribed by his doctors, indulging himself in food and drink. He sent for Antoninus, who was at his side when he died on 10 July 138.&lt;ref&gt;Dio 69.22.4; ''HA Hadrian'' xxv. 5–6; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 50–51. Hadrian's suicide attempts: Dio, lxix. 22.1–4; ''HA Hadrian'' xxiv. 8–13.&lt;/ref&gt; His remains were buried quietly at [[Pozzuoli|Puteoli]].&lt;ref&gt;''HA Hadrian'' xxv. 7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The succession to Antoninus was peaceful and stable: Antoninus kept Hadrian's nominees in office and appeased the senate, respecting its privileges and commuting the death sentences of men charged in Hadrian's last days.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Antoninus Pius'' v. 3, vi. 3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 55–56; "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; For his dutiful behavior, Antoninus was asked to accept the name "Pius".&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 55; "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heir to Antoninus Pius (138–145)===

Immediately after Hadrian's death, Antoninus approached Marcus and requested that his marriage arrangements be amended: Marcus' betrothal to Ceionia Fabia would be annulled, and he would be betrothed to Faustina, Antoninus' daughter, instead. Faustina's betrothal to Ceionia's brother Lucius Commodus would also have to be annulled. Marcus Aurelius consented to Antoninus' proposal.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' vi. 2; ''Verus'' ii. 3–4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antoninus bolstered Marcus' dignity: Marcus was made [[Roman consul|consul]] for 140, with Antoninus as his colleague, and was appointed as a ''seviri'', one of the [[Equites|knights]]' six commanders, at the order's annual parade on 15 July 139. As the heir apparent, Marcus became ''princeps iuventutis'', head of the equestrian order. He now took the name Caesar: Marcus Aelius Aurelius Verus Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;Dio 71.35.5; ''HA Marcus'' vi. 3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus would later caution himself against taking the name too seriously: "See that you do not turn into a Caesar; do not be dipped into the [[Tyrian purple|purple dye]]—for that can happen".&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' vi. 30, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 57; cf. ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 270 n.9, with notes on the translation.&lt;/ref&gt; At the senate's request, Marcus joined all the priestly colleges (''[[Pontiff|pontifices]]'', ''[[augur]]es'', ''[[quindecimviri sacris faciundis]]'', ''[[Epulones|septemviri epulonum]]'', etc.);&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''HA Marcus'' vi. 3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 57.&lt;/ref&gt; direct evidence for membership, however, is available only for the [[Arval Brethren]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 57, 272 n.10, citing ''Codex Inscriptionum Latinarum'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20120429224044/http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=CIL+06,+00032&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 6.32], [https://web.archive.org/web/20120429224054/http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=CIL+06,+00379&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 6.379], cf. ''Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20120429224059/http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+00360&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 360].&lt;/ref&gt;

Antoninus demanded that Marcus take up residence in the House of Tiberius, the imperial palace on the Palatine. Antoninus also made him take up the habits of his new station, the ''aulicum fastigium'' or "pomp of the court", against Marcus' objections.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Marcus would struggle to reconcile the life of the court with his philosophic yearnings. He told himself it was an attainable goal—"Where life is possible, then it is possible to live the right life; life is possible in a palace, so it is possible to live the right life in a palace"&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' 5.16, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;—but he found it difficult nonetheless. He would criticize himself in the ''Meditations'' for "abusing court life" in front of company.&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' 8.9, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

As quaestor, Marcus would have had little real administrative work to do. He would read imperial letters to the senate when Antoninus was absent, and would do secretarial work for the senators. His duties as consul were more significant: one of two senior representatives of the senate, he would preside over meetings and take a major role in the body's administrative functions.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; He felt drowned in paperwork, and complained to his tutor, [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto|Fronto]]: "I am so out of breath from dictating nearly thirty letters".&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' iv. 7, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; He was being "fitted for ruling the state", in the words of his biographer.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' vi. 5; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; He was required to make a speech to the assembled senators as well, making oratorical training essential for the job.&lt;ref name="Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 89"&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 145, Marcus was made consul a second time. He might have been unwell at this time: a letter from Fronto that might have been sent at this time urges Marcus to have plenty of sleep "so that you may come into the Senate with a good colour and read your speech with a strong voice".&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' v. 1, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus had complained of an illness in an earlier letter: "As far as my strength is concerned, I am beginning to get it back; and there is no trace of the pain in my chest. But that ulcer [...]{{refn|The manuscript is corrupt here.&lt;ref name="Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 89"/&gt;|group=notes}} I am having treatment and taking care not to do anything that interferes with it."&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' 4.8, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus Aurelius was never particularly healthy or strong. The Roman historian Cassius Dio, writing of his later years, praised him for behaving dutifully in spite of his various illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Dio 71.36.3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 145 AD, Marcus married Faustina, as had been planned since 138 AD. Since Marcus was, by adoption, Antoninus' son, under Roman law he was marrying his sister; Antoninus would have had to formally release one or the other from his paternal authority (his ''patria potestas'') for the ceremony to take place.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; Little is specifically known of the ceremony, but it is said to have been "noteworthy".&lt;ref&gt;''HA Antoninus Pius'' x. 2, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Coins were issued with the heads of the couple, and Antoninus, as ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'', would have officiated. Marcus makes no apparent reference to the marriage in his surviving letters, and only sparing references to Faustina.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fronto and further education===
After taking the ''[[Toga#Varieties|toga virilis]]'' in 136, Marcus probably began his training in [[Eloquence|oratory]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; He had three tutors in Greek, Aninus Macer, Caninius Celer, and [[Herodes Atticus]], and one in Latin, Fronto. The latter two were the most esteemed orators of the day,&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' iii. 6; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; but probably did not become his tutors until his adoption by Antoninus in 138. The preponderance of Greek tutors indicates the importance of the [[Greek language]] to the aristocracy of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' ii. 4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the age of the [[Second Sophistic]], a renaissance in Greek letters. Although educated in Rome, in his ''Meditations'', Marcus would write his inmost thoughts in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Cameron, review of Anthony Birley's ''Marcus Aurelius'', ''Classical Review'' 17:3 (1967): p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt;

Atticus was controversial: an enormously rich Athenian (probably the richest man in the eastern half of the empire), he was quick to anger, and resented by his fellow Athenians for his patronizing manner.&lt;ref&gt;''Vita Sophistae'' 2.1.14; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Atticus was an inveterate opponent of [[Stoicism]] and philosophic pretensions.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, ''Noctes Atticae'' 9.2.1–7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt; He thought the Stoics' desire for a "lack of feeling" foolish: they would live a "sluggish, enervated life", he said.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, ''Noctes Atticae'' 19.12, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus would become a Stoic. He would not mention Herodes at all in his ''Meditations'', in spite of the fact that they would come into contact many times over the following decades.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fronto was highly esteemed: in the self-consciously antiquarian world of Latin letters,&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 67–68, citing Champlin, ''Fronto and Antonine Rome'', esp. chs. 3 and 4.&lt;/ref&gt; he was thought of as second only to [[Cicero]], perhaps even an alternative to him.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 65–67.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Modern scholars have not offered as positive an assessment. His second modern editor, [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr|Niebhur]], thought him stupid and frivolous; his third editor, [[Samuel Adrian Naber|Naber]], found him contemptible.&lt;ref&gt;Champlin, ''Fronto'', pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have seen him as a "pedant and a bore", his letters offering neither the running political analysis of a Cicero or the conscientious reportage of a Pliny.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, p. 460.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent prosopographic research has rehabilitated his reputation, though not by much.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., e.g.: Mellor, p. 461 and ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} He did not care much for Atticus, though Marcus was eventually to put the pair on speaking terms. Fronto exercised a complete mastery of Latin, capable of tracing expressions through the literature, producing obscure [[synonym]]s, and challenging minor improprieties in word choice.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

A significant amount of the correspondence between Fronto and Marcus has survived.&lt;ref name="Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 69"&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The pair were very close. "Farewell my Fronto, wherever you are, my most sweet love and delight. How is it between you and me? I love you and you are not here."&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' iv. 6 (= Haines 1.80ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus Aurelius spent time with Fronto's wife and daughter, both named Cratia, and they enjoyed light conversation.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' iv. 6 (= Haines 1.80ff); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote Fronto a letter on his birthday, claiming to love him as he loved himself, and calling on the gods to ensure that every word he learned of literature, he would learn "from the lips of Fronto".&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' iii. 10–11 (= Haines 1.50ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; His prayers for Fronto's health were more than conventional, because Fronto was frequently ill; at times, he seems to be an almost constant invalid, always suffering&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;—about one-quarter of the surviving letters deal with the man's sicknesses.&lt;ref&gt;Champlin, "Chronology of Fronto", p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus asks that Fronto's pain be inflicted on himself, "of my own accord with every kind of discomfort".&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' v. 74 ( =Haines 2.52ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fronto never became Marcus' full-time teacher, and continued his career as an advocate. One notorious case brought him into conflict with Atticus.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 77. On the date, see Champlin, "Chronology of Fronto", p. 142, who (with Bowersock, ''Greek Sophists in the Roman Empire'' (1964), 93ff) argues for a date in the 150s; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 78–79, 273 n.17 (with Ameling, ''Herodes Atticus'' (1983), 1.61ff, 2.30ff) argues for 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus pleaded with Fronto, first with "advice", then as a "favour", not to attack Atticus; he had already asked Atticus to refrain from making the first blows.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' iii. 2 (= Haines 1.58ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Fronto replied that he was surprised to discover Marcus counted Atticus as a friend (perhaps Atticus was not yet Marcus' tutor), and allowed that Marcus might be correct,&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' iii. 3 (= Haines 1.62ff); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; but nonetheless affirmed his intent to win the case by any means necessary: "...the charges are frightful and must be spoken of as frightful. Those in particular which refer to the beating and robbing I will describe in such a way that they savour of gall and bile. If I happen to call him an uneducated little Greek it will not mean war to the death."&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' iii. 3 (= Haines 1.62ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of the trial is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the age of twenty-five (between April 146 and April 147), Marcus had grown disaffected with his studies in [[jurisprudence]], and showed some signs of general [[malaise]]. His master, he writes to Fronto, was an unpleasant blowhard, and had made "a hit at" him: "It is easy to sit yawning next to a judge, he says, but to ''be'' a judge is noble work."&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' iv. 13 (= Haines 1.214ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus had grown tired of his exercises, of taking positions in imaginary debates. When he criticized the insincerity of conventional language, Fronto took to defend it.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' iv. 3.1 (= Haines 1.2ff); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, Marcus' formal education was now over. He had kept his teachers on good terms, following them devotedly. It "affected his health adversely", his biographer writes, to have devoted so much effort to his studies. It was the only thing the biographer could find fault with in Marcus' entire boyhood.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' iii. 5–8, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fronto had warned Marcus against the study of philosophy early on: "It is better never to have touched the teaching of philosophy...than to have tasted it superficially, with the edge of the lips, as the saying is".&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' iv. 3, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; He disdained philosophy and philosophers, and looked down on Marcus' sessions with [[Apollonius of Chalcedon]] and others in this circle.&lt;ref name="Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 69"/&gt; Fronto put an uncharitable interpretation of Marcus' "conversion to philosophy": "In the fashion of the young, tired of boring work", Marcus had turned to philosophy to escape the constant exercises of oratorical training.&lt;ref&gt;''De Eloquentia'' iv. 5 (= Haines 2.74), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 95. Alan Cameron, in his review of Birley's biography (''The Classical Review'' 17:3 (1967): p. 347), suggests a reference to chapter 11 of Arthur Darby Nock's ''Conversion'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1933, rept. 1961): "Conversion to Philosophy".&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus kept in close touch with Fronto, but would ignore Fronto's scruples.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 94, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollonius may have introduced Marcus to Stoic philosophy, but [[Junius Rusticus|Quintus Junius Rusticus]] would have the strongest influence on the boy.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 95; Champlin, ''Fronto'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Champlin notes that Marcus' praise of him in the ''Meditations'' is out of order (he is praised immediately after Diognetus, who had introduced Marcus to philosophy), giving him special emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;Champlin, ''Fronto'', p. 174 n. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} He was the man Fronto recognized as having "wooed Marcus away" from oratory.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Antoninum Imperator'' i.2.2 (= Haines 2.36), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; He was older than Fronto and twenty years older than Marcus. As the grandson of [[Arulenus Rusticus]], one of the martyrs to the tyranny of [[Domitian]] (''r''. 81–96), he was heir to the tradition of "[[Stoic Opposition]]" to the "bad emperors" of the 1st century;&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 94–95, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; the true successor of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] (as opposed to Fronto, the false one).&lt;ref&gt;Champlin, ''Fronto'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus thanks Rusticus for teaching him "not to be led astray into enthusiasm for rhetoric, for writing on speculative themes, for discoursing on moralizing texts.... To avoid oratory, poetry, and 'fine writing.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' i.7, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Births and deaths===
On November 30, 147, Faustina gave birth to a girl named Domitia Faustina. She was the first of at least thirteen children (including two sets of twins) that Faustina would bear over the next twenty-three years. The next day, 1 December, Antoninus gave Marcus the [[tribune|tribunician]] power and the ''[[imperium]]''—authority over the armies and provinces of the emperor. As tribune, he had the right to bring one measure before the senate after the four Antoninus could introduce. His tribunican powers would be renewed with Antoninus' on 10 December 147.&lt;ref name="Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 103"&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RomaCastelSantAngelo-2.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Mausoleum of Hadrian]], where the children of Marcus and Faustina were buried|alt=Mausoleum of Hadrian]]

The first mention of Domitia in Marcus' letters reveals her as a sickly infant. "Caesar to Fronto. If the gods are willing we seem to have a hope of recovery. The diarrhea has stopped, the little attacks of fever have been driven away. But the emaciation is still extreme and there is still quite a bit of coughing." He and Faustina, Marcus wrote, had been "pretty occupied" with the girl's care.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' 4.11 (= Haines 1.202ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Domitia would die in 151.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 247 F.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 149, Faustina gave birth again, to twin sons. Contemporary coinage commemorates the event, with crossed cornucopiae beneath portrait busts of the two small boys, and the legend ''temporum felicitas'', "the happiness of the times". They did not survive long. Before the end of the year, another family coin was issued: it shows only a tiny girl, Domitia Faustina, and one boy baby. Then another: the girl alone. The infants were buried in the [[Castel Sant'Angelo|Mausoleum of Hadrian]], where their epitaphs survive. They were called Titus Aurelius Antoninus and Tiberius Aelius Aurelius.&lt;ref name="Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 206–07"&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 206–07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus steadied himself: "One man prays: 'How I may not lose my little child', but you must pray: 'How I may not be afraid to lose him'."&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' ix.40, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; He quoted from the ''[[Iliad]]'' what he called the "briefest and most familiar saying...enough to dispel sorrow and fear":&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt; leaves,
the wind scatters some on the face of the ground;
like unto them are the children of men.&lt;/poem&gt;
–&amp;nbsp;''Iliad'' vi.146&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' x.34, tr. Farquharson, pp. 78, 224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another daughter was born on 7 March 150, [[Lucilla|Annia Aurelia Galeria Lucilla]]. At some time between 155 and 161, probably soon after 155, Marcus' mother Domitia Lucilla died.&lt;ref name="Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 107"&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Faustina probably had another daughter in 151, but the child, Annia Galeria Aurelia Faustina, might not have been born until 153.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 107–08.&lt;/ref&gt; Another son, Tiberius Aelius Antoninus, was born in 152. A coin issue celebrates ''fecunditati Augustae'', "the Augusta's fertility", depicting two girls and an infant. The boy did not survive long; on coins from 156, only the two girls were depicted. He might have died in 152, the same year as Marcus' sister Cornificia.&lt;ref name="Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 108"&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 28 March 158, when Marcus replied, another of his children was dead. Marcus Aurelius thanked the temple synod, "even though this turned out otherwise". The child's name is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;''Inscriptiones Graecae ad Res Romanas pertinentes'' 4.1399, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; In 159 and 160, Faustina gave birth to daughters: Fadilla and Cornificia, named respectively after Faustina's and Marcus' dead sisters.&lt;ref name="Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 114"&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antoninus Pius' last years===
[[File:Antoninus Pius Glyptothek Munich 337 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Antoninus Pius]], Marcus Aurelius' adoptive father and predecessor as emperor ([[Glyptothek]])|alt=Bust of Antoninus Pius]]

Lucius started his political career as a quaestor in 153. He was consul in 154,&lt;ref&gt;Reed, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; and was consul again with Marcus in 161.&lt;ref name="livius1"&gt;Lendering, "Marcus Aurelius".&lt;/ref&gt; Lucius had no other titles, except that of "son of Augustus". Lucius had a markedly different personality from Marcus: he enjoyed sports of all kinds, but especially hunting and wrestling; he took obvious pleasure in the circus games and gladiatorial fights.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 2.9–11; 3.4–7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Although part of the biographer's account of Lucius is fictionalized (probably to mimic Nero, whose birthday Lucius shared&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Nero'' 6.1; ''HA Verus'' 1.8; Barnes, "Hadrian and Lucius Verus", 67; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 158. See also: Barnes, "Hadrian and Lucius Verus", pp. 69–70; Pierre Lambrechts, "L'empereur Lucius Verus. Essai de réhabilitation" (in French), ''Antiquité Classique'' 3 (1934), pp. 173ff.&lt;/ref&gt;) and another part poorly compiled from a better biographical source,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, "Hadrian and Lucius Verus", p. 66. Poorly compiled: e.g. Barnes, "Hadrian and Lucius Verus", p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; scholars have accepted these biographical details as accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, "Hadrian and Lucius Verus", pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} He did not marry until 164.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 2.9–11; 3.4–7; Barnes, "Hadrian and Lucius Verus", 68; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 156, Antoninus turned 70. He found it difficult to keep himself upright without [[corset|stays]]. He started nibbling on dry bread to give him the strength to stay awake through his morning receptions. As Antoninus aged, Marcus would take on more administrative duties, more still when he became the [[praetorian prefect]] (an office that was as much secretarial as military) as Gavius Maximus died in 156 or 157.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; In 160, Marcus and Lucius were designated joint consuls for the following year. Antoninus may have already been ill.&lt;ref name="Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 114"/&gt;

Two days before his death, the biographer reports, Antoninus was at his ancestral estate at [[Lorium]], in [[Etruria]],&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, 156; Victor, 15:7&lt;/ref&gt; about 19 kilometres (12&amp;nbsp;mi) from Rome.&lt;ref name="Victor, 15:7"&gt;Victor, 15:7&lt;/ref&gt; He ate Alpine cheese at dinner quite greedily. In the night he vomited; he had a fever the next day. The day after that, 7 March 161,&lt;ref&gt;Dio 71.33.4–5; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; he summoned the imperial council, and passed the state and his daughter to Marcus. The emperor gave the keynote to his life in the last word that he uttered when the [[tribune]] of the night-watch came to ask the password—"aequanimitas" (equanimity).&lt;ref name="Bury 532"&gt;Bury, p. 532.&lt;/ref&gt; He then turned over, as if going to sleep, and died.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Antoninus Pius'' 12.4–8; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; His death closed out the longest reign since Augustus, surpassing [[Tiberius]] by a couple of months.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accession of Marcus Aurelius and Verus (161)===
[[File:Lucius Verus - MET - L.2007.26 edit.jpg|thumb|[[Lucius Verus]], Marcus Aurelius' co-emperor from 161 to Lucius' death in 169 ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] lent by the Louvre)|alt=Bust of Marcus Aurelius' co-ruler Lucius Verus]]

After Antoninus died in 161, Marcus was effectively sole ruler of the Empire. The formalities of the position would follow. The senate would soon grant him the name Augustus and the title ''[[imperator]]'', and he would soon be formally elected as ''Pontifex Maximus'', chief priest of the official cults. Marcus made some show of resistance: the biographer writes that he was "compelled" to take imperial power.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' vii. 5, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been a genuine ''horror imperii'', "fear of imperial power". Marcus Aurelius, with his preference for the philosophic life, found the imperial office unappealing. His training as a Stoic, however, had made the choice clear that it was his duty.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 116. Birley takes the phrase ''horror imperii'' from ''HA Pert''. xiii. 1 and xv. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Marcus showed no personal affection for Hadrian (significantly, he does not thank him in the first book of his ''Meditations''), he presumably believed it his duty to enact the man's succession plans.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, although the senate planned to confirm Marcus Aurelius alone, he refused to take office unless Lucius received equal powers.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' iii.8; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 116; "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; The senate accepted, granting Lucius the ''imperium'', the tribunician power, and the name Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' iv.1; ''Marcus'' vii.5; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus became, in official titulature, Imperator Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus; Lucius, forgoing his name Commodus and taking Marcus' family name, Verus, became Imperator Caesar Lucius Aurelius Verus Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 116–17.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|These name-swaps have proven so confusing that even the ''Historia Augusta'', our main source for the period, cannot keep them straight.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 117; "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 157 n.53.&lt;/ref&gt; The 4th-century ecclesiastical historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] shows even more confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 157 n.53.&lt;/ref&gt; The mistaken belief that Lucius had the name "Verus" before becoming emperor has proven especially popular.&lt;ref name="Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 117"&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} It was the first time that Rome was ruled by two emperors.&lt;ref name="Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 117"/&gt;{{refn|There was, however, much precedent. The consulate was a twin magistracy, and earlier emperors had often had a subordinate lieutenant with many imperial offices (under Antoninus, the lieutenant had been Marcus). Many emperors had planned a joint succession in the past: [[Augustus]] planned to leave [[Gaius Caesar]] and [[Lucius Caesar]] as joint emperors on his death; Tiberius wished to have [[Gaius Caligula]] and [[Tiberius Gemellus]] do so as well; [[Claudius]] left the empire to [[Nero]] and [[Britannicus]], imagining that they would accept equal rank. All of these arrangements had ended in failure, either through premature death (Gaius and Lucius Caesar) or judicial murder (Gemellus by Caligula and Britannicus by Nero).&lt;ref name="Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 117"/&gt;|group=notes}}

In spite of their nominal equality, Marcus held more ''[[auctoritas]]'', or "authority", than Lucius. He had been consul once more than Lucius, he had shared in Antoninus' administration, and he alone was ''Pontifex Maximus''. It would have been clear to the public which emperor was the more senior.&lt;ref name="Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 117"/&gt; As the biographer wrote, "Verus obeyed Marcus...as a lieutenant obeys a proconsul or a governor obeys the emperor."&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' iv.2, tr. David Magie, cited in Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 117, 278 n.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after their senate confirmation, the emperors proceeded to the [[Castra Praetoria]], the camp of the [[Praetorian Guard]]. Lucius addressed the assembled troops, which then acclaimed the pair as ''imperatores''. Then, like every new emperor since [[Claudius]], Lucius promised the troops a special donative.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' vii. 9; ''Verus'' iv.3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 117–18.&lt;/ref&gt; This donative, however, was twice the size of those past: 20,000 [[sestertius|sesterces]] (5,000 [[denarius|denarii]]) per capita, with more to officers. In return for this bounty, equivalent to several years' pay, the troops swore an oath to protect the emperors.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' vii. 9; ''Verus'' iv.3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 117–18. "twice the size": Duncan-Jones, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony was perhaps not entirely necessary, given that Marcus' accession had been peaceful and unopposed, but it was good insurance against later military troubles.&lt;ref name="Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 118"&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his accession he also devalued the [[Roman currency]]. He decreased the silver purity of the denarius from 83.5% to 79%—the silver weight dropping from 2.68 grams to 2.57 grams.&lt;ref name="TulaneUniversity"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010210220413/http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm Roman Currency of the Principate].&lt;/ref&gt;

Antoninus' funeral ceremonies were, in the words of the biographer, "elaborate".&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' vii. 10, tr. David Magie, cited in Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 118, 278 n.6.&lt;/ref&gt; If his funeral followed those of his predecessors, his body would have been incinerated on a pyre at the [[Campus Martius]], and his spirit would have been seen as ascending to the gods' home in the heavens. Marcus and Lucius nominated their father for deification. In contrast to their behavior during Antoninus' campaign to deify Hadrian, the senate did not oppose the emperors' wishes. A ''[[flamen]]'', or cultic priest, was appointed to minister the cult of the deified Antoninus, now ''Divus Antoninus''. Antoninus' remains were laid to rest in Hadrian's mausoleum, beside the remains of Marcus' children and of Hadrian himself.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' vii. 10–11; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The temple he had dedicated to his wife, Diva Faustina, became the [[Temple of Antoninus and Faustina]]. It survives as the church of San Lorenzo in Miranda.&lt;ref name="Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 118"/&gt;

In accordance with his will, Antoninus' fortune passed on to Faustina.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Antoninus Pius'' xii.8; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 118–19.&lt;/ref&gt; (Marcus had little need of his wife's fortune. Indeed, at his accession, Marcus transferred part of his mother's estate to his nephew, Ummius Quadratus.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' vii. 4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;) Faustina was three months pregnant at her husband's accession. During the pregnancy she dreamed of giving birth to two serpents, one fiercer than the other.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Comm''. i.3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 August she gave birth at [[Lanuvium]] to twins: T.

Soon after the emperors' accession, Marcus' eleven-year-old daughter, Annia Lucilla, was betrothed to Lucius (in spite of the fact that he was, formally, her uncle).&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' vii. 7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; At the ceremonies commemorating the event, new provisions were made for the support of poor children, along the lines of earlier imperial foundations.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 118, citing Werner Eck, ''Die Organization Italiens'' (1979), pp. 146ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus and Lucius proved popular with the people of Rome, who strongly approved of their ''civiliter'' ("lacking pomp") behavior. The emperors permitted free speech, evidenced by the fact that the comedy writer Marullus was able to criticize them without suffering retribution. As the biographer wrote, "No one missed the lenient ways of Pius."&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' viii. 1, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 119; "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus replaced a number of the empire's major officials. The ''[[ab epistulis]]'' Sextus Caecilius Crescens Volusianus, in charge of the imperial correspondence, was replaced with Titus Varius Clemens. Clemens was from the frontier province of [[Pannonia]] and had served in the war in [[Mauretania]]. Recently, he had served as procurator of five provinces. He was a man suited for a time of military crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 122–23, citing H.G. Pfalum, ''Les carrières procuratoriennes équestres sous le Haut-Empire romain'' I–III (Paris, 1960–61); ''Supplément'' (Paris, 1982), nos. 142; 156; Eric Birley, ''Roman Britain and the Roman Army'' (1953), pp. 142ff., 151ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucius Volusius Maecianus, Marcus ' former tutor, had been [[Augustal prefect|prefectural governor]] of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]] at Marcus' accession. Maecianus was recalled, made senator, and appointed prefect of the treasury (''[[aerarium Saturni]]''). He was made consul soon after.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 123, citing H.G. Pfalum, ''Les carrières procuratoriennes équestres sous le Haut-Empire romain'' I–III (Paris, 1960–61); ''Supplément'' (Paris, 1982), no. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Fronto's son-in-law, [[Gaius Aufidius Victorinus]], was appointed governor of [[Germania Superior]].&lt;ref name="HA Marcus 8 1985"&gt;''HA Marcus'' viii. 8; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 123, citing W. Eck, ''Die Satthalter der germ. Provinzen'' (1985), pp. 65ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fronto returned to his Roman townhouse at dawn on 28 March, having left his home in [[Cirta]] as soon as news of his pupils' accession reached him. He sent a note to the imperial freedman Charilas, asking if he could call on the emperors. Fronto would later explain that he had not dared to write the emperors directly.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 120, citing ''Ad Verum Imperator'' i.3.2 (= Haines 1.298ff).&lt;/ref&gt; The tutor was immensely proud of his students. Reflecting on the speech he had written on taking his consulship in 143, when he had praised the young Marcus, Fronto was ebullient: "There was then an outstanding natural ability in you; there is now perfected excellence. There was then a crop of growing corn; there is now a ripe, gathered harvest. What I was hoping for then, I have now. The hope has become a reality."&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Antoninum Imperator'' iv.2.3 (= Haines 1.302ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Fronto called on Marcus Aurelius alone; neither thought to invite Lucius.&lt;ref name="Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 120"&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucius was less esteemed by Fronto than his brother, as his interests were on a lower level. Lucius asked Fronto to adjudicate in a dispute he and his friend Calpurnius were having on the relative merits of two actors.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 120, citing ''Ad Verum Imperator'' i.1 (= Haines 1.305).&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus told Fronto of his reading—[[Lucius Coelius Antipater|Coelius]] and a little Cicero—and his family. His daughters were in Rome with their great-great-aunt Matidia; Marcus thought the evening air of the country was too cold for them. He asked Fronto for "some particularly eloquent reading matter, something of your own, or Cato, or Cicero, or Sallust or Gracchus—or some poet, for I need distraction, especially in this kind of way, by reading something that will uplift and diffuse my pressing anxieties."&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Antoninum Imperator'' iv.1 (= Haines 1.300ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus' early reign proceeded smoothly; he was able to give himself wholly to philosophy and the pursuit of popular affection.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' viii. 3–4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, however, he would find he had many anxieties. It would mean the end of the ''felicitas temporum'' ("happy times") that the coinage of 161 had proclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 120, citing H. Mattingly, ''Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus'' (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 841; 845.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tiber in flood 2.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Tiber Island]] seen at a forty-year high-water mark of the Tiber, December 2008|alt=Tiber Island]]
In the spring of 162,{{refn|Because both Lucius and Marcus are said to have taken active part in the recovery (''HA Marcus'' viii. 4–5), the flood must have happened before Lucius' departure for the east in 162; because it appears in the biographer's narrative after Antoninus' funeral has finished and the emperors have settled into their offices, it must not have occurred in the spring of 161. A date in autumn 161 or spring 162 is probable, and, given the normal seasonal distribution of Tiber flooding, the most probable date is in spring 162.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory S. Aldrete, ''Floods of the Tiber in ancient Rome'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007), pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; (Birley dates the flood to autumn 161.&lt;ref name="Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 120"/&gt;)|group=notes}} the [[Tiber]] overflowed its banks, flooding much of Rome. It drowned many animals, leaving the city in famine. Marcus and Lucius gave the crisis their personal attention.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' viii. 4–5; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Since 15 AD, the river had been administered by a Tiber Conservancy Board, with a consular senator at its head and a permanent staff. In 161, the ''curator alevi Tiberis et riparum et cloacarum urbis'' ("Curator of the Tiber Bed and Banks and the City Sewers") was A. Platorius Nepos, son or grandson of [[Aulus Platorius Nepos|the builder]] of [[Hadrian's Wall]], whose name he shares. He probably had not been particularly incompetent. A more likely candidate for that incompetence is Nepos' likely predecessor, [[Marcus Statius Priscus|M. Statius Priscus]]. A military man and consul for 159, Priscus probably looked on the office as little more than "paid leave".&lt;ref&gt;''Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20120429224106/http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+05932&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 5932] (Nepos), [https://web.archive.org/web/20120429224111/http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+01092&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 1092] (Priscus); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} In other times of famine, the emperors are said to have provided for the Italian communities out of the Roman granaries.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' xi. 3, cited in Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 278 n.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fronto's letters continued through Marcus' early reign. Fronto felt that, because of Marcus' prominence and public duties, lessons were more important now than they had ever been before. He believed Marcus was "beginning to feel the wish to be eloquent once more, in spite of having for a time lost interest in eloquence".&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Antoninum Imperator'' 1.2.2 (= Haines 2.35), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Fronto would again remind his pupil of the tension between his role and his philosophic pretensions: "Suppose, Caesar, that you can attain to the wisdom of [[Cleanthes]] and [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]], yet, against your will, not the philosopher's woolen cape."&lt;ref&gt;''De eloquentia'' 1.12 (= Haines 2.63–65), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early days of Marcus' reign were the happiest of Fronto's life: Marcus was beloved by the people of Rome, an excellent emperor, a fond pupil, and, perhaps most importantly, as eloquent as could be wished.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Antoninum Imperator'' 1.2.2 (= Haines 2.35); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 127–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus had displayed rhetorical skill in his speech to the senate after an earthquake at [[Cyzicus]]. It had conveyed the drama of the disaster, and the senate had been awed: "Not more suddenly or violently was the city stirred by the earthquake than the minds of your hearers by your speech." Fronto was hugely pleased.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Antoninum Imperator'' 1.2.4 (= Haines 2.41–43), tr. Haines; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War with Parthia (161–166)===

[[File:Coin of Vologases IV of Parthia.jpg|thumb|300px|Coin of [[Vologases IV]], king of Parthia, from 152/53|alt=Coin of Parthian ruler Vologases IV]]
On his deathbed, Antoninus Pius spoke of nothing but the state and the foreign kings who had wronged him.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Antoninus Pius'' xii.7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 114, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; One of those kings, [[Vologases IV of Parthia]], made his move in late summer or early autumn 161.&lt;ref&gt;Event: ''HA Marcus'' viii. 6; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 121. Date: Jaap-Jan Flinterman, "The Date of Lucian's Visit to Abonuteichos," ''Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik'' 119 (1997): p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; Vologases entered the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] (then a Roman client state), expelled its king and installed his own—[[Bakur|Pacorus]], an [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] like himself.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' viii. 6; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; The governor of Cappadocia, the frontline in all Armenian conflicts, was [[Marcus Sedatius Severianus]], a Gaul with much experience in military matters.&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Alexander'' 27; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Convinced by the prophet [[Alexander of Abonutichus]] that he could defeat the Parthians easily and win glory for himself,&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Alexander'' 27; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 121–22. On Alexander, see: Robin Lane Fox, ''Pagans and Christians'' (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1986), pp. 241–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Severianus led a legion (perhaps the [[Legio IX Hispana|IX Hispana]]&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 278 n.19.&lt;/ref&gt;) into Armenia, but was trapped by the great Parthian general Chosrhoes at Elegia, a town just beyond the Cappadocian frontiers, high up past the headwaters of the Euphrates. After Severianus made some unsuccessful efforts to engage Chosrhoes, he committed suicide, and his legion was massacred. The campaign had lasted only three days.&lt;ref&gt;Dio 71.2.1; Lucian, ''Historia Quomodo Conscribenda'' 21, 24, 25; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 121–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was threat of war on other frontiers as well—in Britain, and in [[Raetia]] and Upper Germany, where the [[Chatti]] of the [[Taunus]] mountains had recently crossed over the ''[[limes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' viii. 7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus was unprepared. Antoninus seems to have given him no military experience; the biographer writes that Marcus spent the whole of Antoninus' twenty-three-year reign at his emperor's side and not in the provinces, where most previous emperors had spent their early careers.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Antoninus Pius'' vii.11; ''Marcus'' vii.2; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 103–04, 122.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|[[Alan Cameron (classical scholar)|Alan Cameron]] adduces the 5th-century writer [[Sidonius Apollinaris]]'s comment that Marcus commanded "countless legions" ''vivente Pio'' (while Antoninus was alive) while contesting Birley's contention that Marcus had no military experience.

More bad news arrived: the Syrian governor's army had been defeated by the Parthians, and retreated in disarray.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' viii. 6; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Reinforcements were dispatched for the Parthian frontier.

Marcus took a four-day public holiday at [[Alsium]], a resort town on the coast of Etruria. He was too anxious to relax. Writing to Fronto, he declared that he would not speak about his holiday.&lt;ref&gt;''De Feriis Alsiensibus'' 1 (= Haines 2.3); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Fronto replied: "What? Do I not know that you went to Alsium with the intention of devoting yourself to games, joking, and complete leisure for four whole days?"&lt;ref&gt;''De Feriis Alsiensibus'' 3.1 (= Haines 2.5), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; He encouraged Marcus to rest, calling on the example of his predecessors (Antoninus had enjoyed exercise in the ''[[palaestra]]'', fishing, and comedy),&lt;ref&gt;''De Feriis Alsiensibus'' 3.4 (= Haines 2.9); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 126–27.&lt;/ref&gt; going so far as to write up a fable about the gods' division of the day between morning and evening—Marcus Aurelius had apparently been spending most of his evenings on judicial matters instead of at leisure.&lt;ref&gt;''De Feriis Alsiensibus'' 3.6–12 (= Haines 2.11–19); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 126–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus could not take Fronto's advice.

Haines 2.19; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus Aurelius put on Fronto's voice to chastise himself: "'Much good has my advice done you', you will say!"

Fronto sent Marcus a selection of reading material,&lt;ref&gt;''De bello Parthico'' x. (= Haines 2.31), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; and, to settle his unease over the course of the Parthian war, a long and considered letter, full of historical references. In modern editions of Fronto's works, it is labeled ''De bello Parthico'' (''On the Parthian War''). There had been reverses in Rome's past, Fronto writes,&lt;ref&gt;''De bello Parthico'' i-ii. (= Haines 2.21–23).&lt;/ref&gt; but, in the end, Romans had always prevailed over their enemies: "Always and everywhere [Mars] has changed our troubles into successes and our terrors into triumphs."&lt;ref&gt;''De bello Parthico'' i. (= Haines 2.21), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the winter of 161–162, news that a rebellion was brewing in Syria arrived and it was decided that Lucius should direct the Parthian war in person. He was stronger and healthier than Marcus, the argument went, and thus more suited to military activity.&lt;ref&gt;Dio, lxxi. 1.3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucius' biographer suggests ulterior motives: to restrain Lucius' debaucheries, to make him thrifty, to reform his morals by the terror of war, and to realize that he was an emperor.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' v. 8; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 123, 125.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Birley believes there is some truth in these considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} Whatever the case, the senate gave its assent, and, in the summer of 162, Lucius left.

The Armenian capital [[Artashat (ancient city)|Artaxata]] was captured in 163.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' ix. 1; Birley, "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the year, Lucius took the title ''Armeniacus'', despite having never seen combat; Marcus declined to accept the title until the following year.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' ix. 1; ''HA Verus'' vii. 1–2; ''Ad Verrum Imperator'' 2.3 (= Haines 2.133); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 129; "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; When Lucius was hailed as ''imperator'' again, however, Marcus did not hesitate to take the ''Imperator II'' with him.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 129; "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 162, citing H. Mattingly, ''Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus'' (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 233ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Occupied Armenia was reconstructed on Roman terms. In 164, a new capital, Kaine Polis ('New City'), replaced Artaxata.&lt;ref&gt;Dio, lxxi.3.1; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 131; "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 162; Millar, ''Near East'', p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; A new king was installed: a Roman senator of consular rank and Arsacid descent, [[Sohaemus of Armenia|Gaius Julius Sohaemus]]. He may not even have been crowned in Armenia; the ceremony may have taken place in Antioch, or even Ephesus.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 280 n. 42; "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Sohaemus was hailed on the imperial coinage of 164 under the legend {{Smallcaps|Rex armeniis Datus}}: Lucius sat on a throne with his staff while Sohaemus stood before him, saluting the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 131; "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 162, citing H. Mattingly, ''Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus'' (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 261ff.; 300 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 163, the Parthians intervened in [[Osroene]], a Roman client in upper Mesopotamia centered on [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], and installed their own king on its throne.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 130, 279 n. 38; "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 163, citing ''Prosopographia Imperii Romani''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; M 169; Millar, ''Near East'', p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Roman forces were moved downstream, to cross the [[Euphrates]] at a more southerly point.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 130; "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the end of 163, however, Roman forces had moved north to occupy Dausara and Nicephorium on the northern, Parthian bank.&lt;ref&gt;Fronto, ''Ad Verum Imperator'' ii.1.3 (= Haines 2.133); Astarita, 41; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 130; "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the conquest of the north bank of the Euphrates, other Roman forces moved on Osroene from Armenia, taking Anthemusia, a town southwest of Edessa.&lt;ref&gt;''Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20120429223856/http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+01098&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 1098]; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 165, Roman forces moved on Mesopotamia. Edessa was re-occupied, and Mannus, the king deposed by the Parthians, was re-installed.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 163, citing ''Prosopographia Imperii Romani''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; M 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The Parthians retreated to Nisibis, but this too was besieged and captured. The Parthian army dispersed in the [[Tigris]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Historia Quomodo Conscribenda'' 15, 19; Birley, "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; A second force, under Avidius Cassius and the III Gallica, moved down the Euphrates, and fought a major battle at Dura.&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Historia Quomodo Conscribenda'' 20, 28; Birley, "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 163, citing Syme, ''Roman Papers'', 5.689ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the year, Cassius' army had reached the twin metropolises of Mesopotamia: [[Seleucia]] on the right bank of the Tigris and [[Ctesiphon]] on the left. Ctesiphon was taken and its royal palace set to flame. The citizens of Seleucia, still largely Greek (the city had been commissioned and settled as a capital of the [[Seleucid Empire]], one of [[Alexander the Great]]'s [[Diadochi|successor kingdoms]]), opened its gates to the invaders. The city was sacked nonetheless, leaving a black mark on Lucius' reputation. Excuses were sought, or invented: the official version had it that the Seleucids broke faith first.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Verus'' 8.3–4; Birley, "Hadrian to the Antonines", 163. Birley cites R.H. McDowell, ''Coins from Seleucia on the Tigris'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1935), pp. 124ff., on the date.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cassius' army, although suffering from a shortage of supplies and the effects of a plague contracted in Seleucia, made it back to Roman territory safely.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucius took the title Parthicus Maximus, and he and Marcus were hailed as ''imperatores'' again, earning the title 'imp. III'.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 164, citing H. Mattingly, ''Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus'' (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 384 ff., 1248 ff., 1271 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Cassius' army returned to the field in 166, crossing over the Tigris into Media. Lucius took the title 'Medicus',&lt;ref&gt;Birley, "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 164, citing P. Kneissl, ''Die Siegestitulatur der römischen Kaiser. Untersuchungen zu den Siegerbeinamen des 1. und 2. Jahrhunderts'' (Göttingen, 1969), pp. 99 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and the emperors were again hailed as ''imperatores'', becoming 'imp. IV' in imperial titulature. Marcus took the Parthicus Maximus now, after another tactful delay.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, "Hadrian to the Antonines", p. 164, citing H. Mattingly, ''Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus'' (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 401ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pile of trophies on the reverse celebrates the end of the Marcomannic Wars.&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly &amp; Sydenham, ''Roman Imperial Coinage'', vol. III, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=Aureus of Marcus Aurelius]]

During the early 160s, Fronto's son-in-law Victorinus was stationed as a legate in Germany. He was there with his wife and children (another child had stayed with Fronto and his wife in Rome).&lt;ref&gt;Dio 72.11.3–4; ''Ad amicos'' 1.12 (= Haines 2.173); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; The condition on the northern frontier looked grave. A frontier post had been destroyed, and it looked like all the peoples of central and northern Europe were in turmoil. There was corruption among the officers: Victorinus had to ask for the resignation of a [[legionary]] legate who was taking bribes.&lt;ref&gt;Dio, lxxii. 11.3–4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 132, citing ''De nepote amisso'' ii (= Haines 2.222); ''Ad Verum Imperator'' ii. 9–10 (= Haines 2.232ff.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Experienced governors had been replaced by friends and relatives of the imperial family. [[Lucius Dasumius Tullius Tuscus]], a distant relative of Hadrian, was in Upper Pannonia, succeeding the experienced [[Marcus Nonius Macrinus]]. Lower Pannonia was under the obscure [[Tiberius Haterius Saturnius]]. [[Marcus Servilius Fabianus Maximus]] was shuffled from Lower Moesia to Upper Moesia when [[Marcus Iallius Bassus]] had joined Lucius in Antioch. Lower Moesia was filled by Pontius Laelianus' son. The Dacias were still divided in three, governed by a praetorian senator and two procurators. The peace could not hold long; Lower Pannonia did not even have a legion.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 133, citing Geza Alföldy, ''Konsulat und Senatorenstand'' (1977), Moesia Inferior: pp. 232f.; Moesia Superior: p. 234f.; Pannonia Superior: p. 236f.; Dacia: p. 245f.; Pannonia Inferior: p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 160s, [[Germanic tribes]] and other nomadic people launched raids along the [[limes Germanicus|northern border]], particularly into [[Gaul]] and across the [[Danube#Human history|Danube]]. This new impetus westwards was probably due to attacks from tribes further east. A first invasion of the Chatti in the province of Germania Superior was repulsed in 162.&lt;ref name="McLynn2010"&gt;McLynn, ''Marcus Aurelius: A Life'', pp. 323–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Far more dangerous was the invasion of 166, when the [[Marcomanni]] of Bohemia, clients of the Roman Empire since 19 AD, crossed the Danube together with the [[Lombards]] and other Germanic tribes.&lt;ref name="Bohec2013"&gt;Le Bohec, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, the Iranian [[Sarmatians]] attacked between the Danube and the [[Tisza|Theiss]] rivers.&lt;ref name="Grant2016"&gt;Grant, ''The Antonines: The Roman Empire in Transition'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Costoboci]], coming from the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] area, invaded [[Moesia]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], and Greece. After a long struggle, Marcus Aurelius managed to push back the invaders. Numerous members of Germanic tribes settled in frontier regions like [[Dacia]], Pannonia, Germany, and Italy itself. This was not a new thing, but this time the numbers of settlers required the creation of two new frontier provinces on the left shore of the Danube, Sarmatia and [[Marcomannia]], including today's [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Hungary]]. Some Germanic tribes who settled in [[Ravenna]] revolted and managed to seize possession of the city. For this reason, Marcus Aurelius decided not only against bringing more barbarians into Italy, but even banished those who had previously been brought there.&lt;ref&gt;Dio, lxxii.11.4-5; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal and administrative work===
[[File:Portrait de Marc Aurèle 2.jpg|thumb|Bust of Marcus Aurelius in the [[Liebieghaus]], Frankfurt|alt=Bust of Marcus Aurelius]]
Like many emperors, Marcus spent most of his time addressing matters of law such as petitions and hearing disputes,&lt;ref&gt;Fergus Millar, ''The Emperor in the Roman World, 31 BC&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;AD 337'' (London: Duckworth, 1977), 6 and ''passim''. See also: idem. "Emperors at Work", ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 57:1/2 (1967): 9–19.&lt;/ref&gt; but unlike many of his predecessors, he was already proficient in imperial administration when he assumed power.&lt;ref&gt;Thinkers at War. "Pius, one of longest-serving emperors, became infirm in his last years, so Marcus Aurelius gradually assumed the imperial duties. By the time he succeeded in AD 161, he was already well-practised in public administration."&lt;/ref&gt; He took great care in the theory and practice of legislation. Professional jurists called him "an emperor most skilled in the law"&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Justinianus'' 7.2.6, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 133.&lt;/ref&gt; and "a most prudent and conscientiously just emperor".&lt;ref&gt;''Digest'' 31.67.10, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; He showed marked interest in three areas of the law: the manumission of slaves, the guardianship of orphans and minors, and the choice of city councillors (''decuriones'').&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus showed a great deal of respect to the Roman Senate and routinely asked them for permission to spend money even though he did not need to do so as the absolute ruler of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;William b. Irvine, A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy, Oxford University Press, 2009, pp.57-58&lt;/ref&gt; In one speech, Marcus himself reminded the Senate that the imperial palace where he lived was not truly his possession but theirs.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, lxxii.33&lt;/ref&gt;

In 168, he revalued the denarius, increasing the silver purity from 79% to 82%—the actual silver weight increasing from 2.57 grams to 2.67 grams. However, two years later he reverted to the previous values because of the military crises facing the empire.&lt;ref name="TulaneUniversity" /&gt;

A possible contact with [[Han Dynasty|Han China]] occurred in 166 when a [[Sino-Roman relations|Roman traveller visited the Han court]], claiming to be an ambassador representing a certain Andun ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: [[wikt:安|安]][[wikt:敦|敦]]), ruler of [[Daqin]], who can be identified either with Marcus or his predecessor Antoninus.&lt;ref&gt;Pulleyblank, Leslie and Gardiner, 71–79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yü, 460–61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Crespigny, 600.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to [[Roman Republic|Republican]]-era [[Roman glass]]wares found at [[Guangzhou]] along the [[South China Sea]],&lt;ref&gt;An, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman golden medallions made during the reign of Antoninus and perhaps even Marcus have been found at [[Óc Eo]], [[Vietnam]], then part of the [[Kingdom of Funan]] near the Chinese province of [[Jiaozhi]] (in northern Vietnam). This may have been the port city of [[Kattigara]], described by [[Ptolemy]] (c. 150) as being visited by a Greek sailor named Alexander and laying beyond the [[Golden Chersonese]] (i.e. [[Malay Peninsula]]).&lt;ref name="young 2001 pp29-30"&gt;Young, 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="osborne 2006 pp24-25"&gt;For further information on [[Óc Eo]], see Osborne, Milton. [https://books.google.com/books?id=uxF2kH04WKgC ''The Mekong: Turbulent Past, Uncertain Future'']. Crows Nest: Allen &amp; Unwin, 2006, revised edition, first published in 2000. pp. 24–25. {{ISBN|9781741148930}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman coins from the reigns of [[Tiberius]] to [[Aurelian]] have been found in [[Xi'an]], China (site of the Han capital [[Chang'an]]), although the far greater amount of [[Indo-Roman trade relations|Roman coins in India]] suggests the Roman maritime trade for [[History of silk|purchasing Chinese silk]] was centered there, not in China or even the overland [[Silk Road]] running through Persia.&lt;ref name="ball 2016 p154"&gt;Ball, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plague===
{{Main|Antonine Plague}}
When Lucius' army returned from the war with Parthia, it brought with it plague. Cases of "Antonine Plague", also known as "the Plague of [[Galen]]", occurred throughout the Empire for years. The [[pandemic]] is believed to have been either [[smallpox]] or [[measles]],&lt;ref&gt;Haeser, p. 24–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"There is not enough evidence satisfactorily to identify the disease or diseases" concluded J. F. Gilliam in his summary (1961) of the written sources, with inconclusive Greek and Latin inscriptions, two groups of papyri and coinage.&lt;/ref&gt; but the true cause remains undetermined. The epidemic may have claimed the life of Lucius, who died in 169. The disease broke out again nine years later, according to the Roman historian [[Dio Cassius]], causing up to 2,000 deaths a day in Rome, one-quarter of those who were affected, giving the disease a mortality rate of about 25%.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius, lxxii. 14.3–4; his book that would cover the plague under Marcus is missing; this later outburst was the greatest of which the historian had knowledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The total deaths have been estimated at five million,&lt;ref&gt;Murphy.&lt;/ref&gt; and the disease killed as much as one-third of the population in some areas and devastated the Roman army.&lt;ref&gt;Plague in the Ancient World.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and succession (180)===
[[File:Delacroix-Marc Aurèle-MBA-Lyon.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|left|''[[Last Words of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius]]'' (1844) by [[Eugène Delacroix]]|alt=Painting that depicts Marcus on his deathbed and his son Commodus, surrounded by the emperor's philosopher friends]]
Marcus died on 17 March 180 due to natural causes in the city of Vindobona (modern Vienna). He was immediately deified and his ashes were returned to Rome, where they rested in Hadrian's [[mausoleum]] (modern [[Castel Sant'Angelo]]) until the [[Visigoth]] [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack of the city]] in 410. His campaigns against Germans and Sarmatians were also commemorated by a [[Column of Marcus Aurelius|column]] and a [[temple of Marcus Aurelius|temple]] built in Rome.&lt;ref name="Kleiner2016"&gt;Kleiner, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars consider his death to be the end of the [[Pax Romana]].&lt;ref name="Merrony2017"&gt;Merrony, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was succeeded by his son [[Commodus]], whom he had named Caesar in 166 and with whom he had jointly ruled since 177.&lt;ref name="Birley186–91"&gt;Birley, "Hadrian to the Antonines", pp. 186–91.&lt;/ref&gt; Biological sons of the emperor, if there were any, were considered heirs;&lt;ref&gt;Kemezis, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; however, it was only the second time that a "non-adoptive" son had succeeded his father, the only other having been a century earlier when [[Vespasian]] was succeeded by his son [[Titus]]. Historians have criticized the decision, citing Commodus' erratic behavior and lack of political and military acumen.&lt;ref name="Birley186–91"/&gt; At the end of his history of Marcus' reign, Cassius Dio wrote an [[encomium]] to the emperor, and described the transition to Commodus in his own lifetime with sorrow:
[[File:Castings of Ancient Roman busts in the Pushkin Museum (Antonin Pius, Marcus Aurelius and Clodius) by shakko.jpg|thumb|left|Castings of the busts of [[Antonius Pius]] (left), Marcus Aurelius (centre), and [[Clodius Albinus]] (right), [[Pushkin Museum]], Moscow|alt=Busts of Marcus' adoptive father Antoninus, Marcus, and Clodius Albinus, a claimant to the Roman throne]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;...[Marcus] did not meet with the good fortune that he deserved, for he was not strong in body and was involved in a multitude of troubles throughout practically his entire reign. But for my part, I admire him all the more for this very reason, that amid unusual and extraordinary difficulties he both survived himself and preserved the empire. Just one thing prevented him from being completely happy, namely, that after rearing and educating his son in the best possible way he was vastly disappointed in him. This matter must be our next topic; for our history now descends from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust, as affairs did for the Romans of that day.
:–Cassius Dio lxxi. 36.3–4&lt;ref&gt;Tr. Cary, ''ad loc''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dio adds that from Marcus' first days as counsellor to Antoninius to his final days as emperor of Rome, "he remained the same [person] and did not change in the least."&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio lxxii. 36, 72.34&lt;/ref&gt; 

Michael Grant, in ''The Climax of Rome'', writes of Commodus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The youth turned out to be very erratic, or at least so anti-traditional that disaster was inevitable. But whether or not Marcus ought to have known this to be so, the rejections of his son's claims in favour of someone else would almost certainly have involved one of the civil wars which were to proliferate so disastrously around future successions.&lt;ref name="Grant2011"&gt;Grant, ''The Climax Of Rome'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy and reputation==
Marcus acquired the reputation of a [[philosopher king]] within his lifetime, and the title would remain his after death; both Dio and the biographer call him "the philosopher".&lt;ref&gt;''HA Marcus'' i. 1, xxvii. 7; Dio lxxi. 1.1; James Francis, ''Subversive Virtue: Asceticism and Authority in the Second-Century Pagan World'' (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1995), 21 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark.&lt;/ref&gt; Christians such as [[Justin Martyr]], Athenagoras, and Melito also gave him the title.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, p. 21 n.1, citing Justin, ''1 Apologia'' 1; Athenagoras, ''Leg''. 1; Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 4.26.9–11.&lt;/ref&gt; The last named went so far as to call him "more philanthropic and philosophic" than Antoninus and Hadrian, and set him against the persecuting emperors Domitian and Nero to make the contrast bolder.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 4.26.9–11, qtd. and tr. Francis, 21 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; "Alone of the emperors," wrote the historian Herodian, "he gave proof of his learning not by mere words or knowledge of philosophical doctrines but by his blameless character and temperate way of life."&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, ''Ab Excessu Divi Marci'' i.2.4, tr. Echols.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iain King]] concludes that Marcus' legacy is tragic, because the emperor's "Stoic philosophy—which is about self-restraint, duty, and respect for others—was so abjectly abandoned by the imperial line he anointed on his death".&lt;ref&gt;Thinkers at War.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitude towards Christians==
In the first two centuries of the Christian era, it was local Roman officials who were largely responsible for the [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution of Christians]]. In the second century, the emperors treated Christianity as a local problem to be dealt with by their subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, "Legislation Against the Christians".&lt;/ref&gt; The number and severity of persecutions of Christians in various locations of the empire seemingly increased during the reign of Marcus. The extent to which Marcus himself directed, encouraged, or was aware of these persecutions is unclear and much debated by historians.&lt;ref name="McLynn2010295"&gt;McLynn, ''Marcus Aurelius: A Life'', p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Edward Gibbon]], with the onset of the Germanic war, his treatment of the Christians degraded with increased persecutions uncharacteristic of the previous years of his reign and those of his predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Ch. 16 Pt. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
{{main|Meditations}}
[[File:MeditationsMarcusAurelius1811.jpg|thumb|First page of the 1792 English translation by [[Richard Graves]]|alt=First page of Meditations]]
While on campaign between 170 and 180, Marcus wrote his ''[[Meditations]]'' in Greek as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement. The original title of this work, if it had one, is unknown. "Meditations"–as well as other titles including "To Himself"–were adopted later. He had a logical mind and his notes were representative of Stoic philosophy and spirituality. ''Meditations'' is still revered as a literary monument to a government of service and duty. According to Hays, the book was a favourite of [[Christina of Sweden]], [[Frederick the Great]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Matthew Arnold]], and [[Goethe]], and is admired by modern figures such as [[Wen Jiabao]] and [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;Hays, xlix.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been considered by many commentators to be one of the greatest works of philosophy.&lt;ref name="Collins1973"&gt;Collins, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known how widely Marcus' writings were circulated after his death. There are stray references in the ancient literature to the popularity of his precepts, and [[Julian the Apostate]] was well aware of his reputation as a philosopher, though he does not specifically mention ''Meditations''.&lt;ref&gt;Stertz, 434, citing Themistius, ''Oratio'' 6.81; ''HA Cassius'' 3.5; Aurelius Victor, ''De Caesaribus'' 16.9.&lt;/ref&gt;  It survived in the scholarly traditions of the Eastern Church and the first surviving quotes of the book, as well as the first known reference of it by name ("Marcus' writings to himself") are from [[Arethas of Caesarea]] in the 10th century and in the Byzantine [[Suda]] (perhaps inserted by Arethas himself). It was first published in 1558 in Zurich by [[Wilhelm Xylander|Wilhelm Xylander (ne Holzmann)]], from a manuscript reportedly lost shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Hays, xlviii–xlix.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest surviving complete manuscript copy is in the [[Vatican library]] and dates to the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hadot, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius]] in Rome is the only Roman equestrian statue which has survived into the modern period.&lt;ref&gt;Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius.&lt;/ref&gt; This is perhaps due to it being wrongly identified during the Middle Ages as a depiction of the [[Christianity in the 4th century|Christian emperor]] [[Constantine the Great]] and hence was spared destruction, unlike some other statues associated with paganism. Crafted of bronze in circa 175 AD, it stands {{cvt|11.6|ft|m}} and is now located in the [[Capitoline Museums]] of Rome. The emperor's hand is outstretched in an act of clemency offered to a bested enemy, while his weary facial expression due to the stress of leading Rome into nearly constant battles perhaps represents a break with the [[Ancient Greek art|classical tradition]] of [[Ancient Greek sculpture|sculpture]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Column of Marcus Aurelius==
{{main|Column of Marcus Aurelius}}

The [[victory column]] of Marcus Aurelius, established in Rome either in his last few years of life or after his reign and completed in 193 AD, was built to commemorate his victory over the Sarmatians and Germanic tribes in 176 AD. A spiral of carved [[relief]]s wraps around the column, showing scenes from his military campaigns. A statue of Marcus had stood atop the column but disappeared during the [[Middle Ages]]. It was replaced with a statue of [[Saint Paul]], in 1589 by pope [[Sixtus V]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://curate.nd.edu/show/ft848p61g5s "Column of Marcus Aurelius: Overall view, of base and column"]. [[University of Notre Dame]], [[Hesburgh Library]]. Accessed 24 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The columns of Marcus Aurelius and [[Trajan]] are often compared by scholars given how they are both [[Doric order|Doric]] in style, had a pedestal at the base, had sculpted [[frieze]]s depicting their respective military victories, and a statue on top.&lt;ref&gt;[https://omeka1.grinnell.edu/Classics/exhibits/show/columns-exhibit "The Columns of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius"].

GAYN, 72, JOURNALIST; SPECIALIST ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS], ''[[The New York Times]]'', Dec. 24, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Mark Julius Ginsbourg was born in 1909 in Barim, [[Manchuria]], in the [[Qing Empire]] (today Balin&lt;!--No match in zhwiki for the Chinese name--&gt; [{{lang|zh|巴林鎮}}], [[Yakeshi]] in [[Inner Mongolia]], [[China]]) to [[Russian-Jewish]] parents who had migrated from the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name=Bradshaw/&gt; He went to school in [[Vladivostok]] in the [[Soviet Union]] and then in [[Shanghai]], China.&lt;ref name=Bradshaw/&gt;  He was accepted to [[Pomona  College]] in [[Claremont, California]], in the United States where he majored in political science.&lt;ref name=Bradshaw/&gt;  Following his graduation from Pomona, he entered the [[Columbia University School of Journalism|School of Journalism]] at [[Columbia University]], graduating in 1934.&lt;ref name=Bradshaw/&gt;

Ginsbourg got into his career in the 1930s as a [[stringer (journalism)]] for ''[[Washington Post]]'' in the Shanghai.  He returned to the U.S. shortly after [[World War II]] broke out in Europe, changing his name to Gayn to prevent Japanese reprisals against his brother Sam, who remained in [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]]-occupied Shanghai.&lt;ref name=Bradshaw/&gt;  Gayn also went on to write for ''[[Collier's]]'' and was arrested in the [[FBI]] raid on the offices of the [[Institute for Pacific Relations]]' ''[[Amerasia]]'' office in June 1945.

However, the charges were dropped shortly thereafter—the ''New York Times'' described him as "quickly vindicated in the courts."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; The [[State Department]] refused to admit his Hungarian-born wife Suzanne Lengvary&lt;!-- Lengváry Zsuzsa known for movies A Cigány (1941) and Taken by the Flood (1941)?? --&gt; to the United States, on the grounds of her alleged Communist sympathies, so he moved to Canada and continued his work as a foreign affairs correspondent.

He filed reports on [[North Korea]]n dictator [[Kim Il Sung]]'s repression and, as one of the first Western journalists admitted into China in the mid-1960s, he managed to criticize the country's Maoist regimentation.

Within the U.S., Gayn's work appeared within the ''[[New York Times]]'' as well as in ''[[Newsweek]]'' and in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]].

At the time of his death from [[cancer]] on December 17, 1981, Gayn was still the senior [[foreign correspondent (journalism)|foreign affairs correspondent]] for the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada.

==Legacy==
During his life, Mark Gayn wrote four books: ''The Fight for the Pacific'' published in 1942, ''Journey From the East: An Autobiography'' published in 1944, ''Japan Diary'' published in 1948 and republished in 1989 and ''New Japan Diary'' which was published after his death in December 1981.

The Mark Gayn Papers—covering his 50 years as a journalist—were given to the [[Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library]] at the [[University of Toronto]] before his death in 1981.{{refn|group=nb|There is a typescript guide to the contents: Collection Guide to the Mark Gayn Papers (MS Col. 215), prepared by Graham S.

A '''muezzin''' ({{IPAc-en|m|(|j|)|u|ˈ|ɛ|z|ɪ|n}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/muezzin|title=muezzin|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-tr|müezzin}} from {{lang-ar|مؤذن}},  {{transl|ar|DIN|''muʾaḏḏin''}} {{IPA-ar|muʔaðːɪn|}}) is the person appointed at a [[mosque]] to lead and recite the [[Adhan|call to prayer]] for every event of prayer&lt;ref name="Modarresi"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi|authorlink=Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi|title=The Laws of Islam|date=26 March 2016|publisher=Enlight Press|isbn=978-0994240989|url=http://almodarresi.com/en/books/pdf/TheLawsofIslam.pdf|accessdate=8 August 2018|ref=Modarresi|language=English|page=470}}&lt;/ref&gt; and worship in the mosque. The mu'addhin's post is an important one, and the community depends on him for an accurate [[salah|prayer schedule]].

==Roles and responsibilities==
The professional mu'addhin is chosen for his good character, voice and skills to serve at the mosque. However, the mu'addhin is not considered a [[cleric]], but in a position comparable to a Christian [[verger]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} When calling to prayer, the mu'addhin faces the [[qiblah]], the direction of the [[Ka'bah]] in [[Mecca|Makkah]], while reciting the ''[[adhan]]''.

==Call of the Mu'addhin==
The call of the mu'addhin is considered an art form, reflected in the melodious chanting of the [[adhan]]. In [[Turkey]], there is an annual competition to find the country's best mu'addhin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/witness/2013/03/20133413812851784.html | title=Muezzin | publisher=Aljazeera | date=13 March  2013 | accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, a mu'addhin would have recited the call to prayer atop the [[minaret]]s in order to be heard by those around the mosque.  Now, mosques often have [[Loudspeakers in mosques|loudspeakers mounted on the top of the minaret]] and the mu'addhin will use a microphone, or the mu'addhin recording is played, allowing the call to prayer to be heard at great distances without climbing the minaret.

==Origins==
The institution of the mu'addhin has existed since the time of [[Muhammad]]. The first mu'addhin was [[Bilal ibn Ribah]], who walked the streets to call the believers to come to prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=John Henrik|title=African People in World History|year=1993|publisher=Black Classic Press|location=Baltimore, MD|isbn=9780933121775|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although many of the customs associated with the mu'addhin remained undecided at the time of Muhammad's death, including which direction one should choose for the calling, where it should be performed, and the use of trumpets, flags or lamps, all of these are elements of the mu'addhin's role during the adhan.

After minarets became customary at mosques, the office of mu'addhin in cities was sometimes given to a [[Blindness|blind]] man, who could not see down into the inner courtyards of the citizens' houses and thus could not violate privacy.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Whether factual or not, the blindness of mu'addhin is claimed as almost universal at certain periods by Jose Saramago in his novel concerning historical epistemology,  [[The History of the Siege of Lisbon]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

{{Buddhism}}
'''Niguma''' is considered one of the most important and influential [[yogini]]s and [[Vajrayana]] teachers of the 10th or 11th century in [[India]]. She was a [[dakini]], and one of the two female founders of the [[Shangpa Kagyu]] school of [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, along with [[dakini]] [[Sukhasiddhi]]. Her birth name was '''Shrijnana''' (or '''Palgyi Yéshé''' in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kongtrul, Jamgon; Zangpo, Ngawang (2003). ''Timeless Rapture: Inspired Verses of the Shangpa Masters.'' Ithaca, New York, USA: Snow Lion Publications. p. 229. {{ISBN|978-1-55939-204-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many of the [[mahasiddha]]s and [[Tantra|Tantric]] practitioners of the time, Niguma was known by several names both during her lifetime and afterwards. She was called '''Yogini Vimalashri''', or '''Vajradhara Niguma''', or '''Jñana (wisdom) Dakini Adorned with Bone (ornaments)''',&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Harding. ''Niguma, Lady of Illusion''. Snow Lion Publications. 2010. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; or '''The Sister''' referring to her purported relationship to the great [[Buddhist]] teacher and adept [[Naropa]]. She was also sometimes called '''Nigupta''',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=P47&lt;/ref&gt; which is explained by the historical Buddhist scholar [[Taranatha]] as follows: "The name Nigu accords with the Indian language, which is Nigupta, and is said to mean 'truly secret' or 'truly hidden.' In fact, it is the [[Twilight language|code-language]] of the dakinis of timeless awareness."&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Harding. ''Niguma, Lady of Illusion''. Snow Lion Publications. 2010. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

There is often confusion between the biographical details of Niguma's life and spiritual accomplishments and that of the renowned Vajrayana teacher and [[mahasiddha]] [[Naropa]].&lt;ref&gt;Kongtrul, Jamgon; Zangpo, Ngawang (2003). ''Timeless Rapture: Inspired Verses of the Shangpa Masters.'' Ithaca, New York, USA: Snow Lion Publications. p. 228. {{ISBN|978-1-55939-204-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Harding. ''Niguma, Lady of Illusion''. Snow Lion Publications. 2010. pp. 1-6&lt;/ref&gt; While the biographical information for Niguma is scarce, what is available often offers details that are identical with the biography of Naropa.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Harding. ''Niguma, Lady of Illusion''. Snow Lion Publications. 2010. pp. 1-6&lt;/ref&gt; While not much can be confirmed about the historical details of Niguma's life, what does remain is the corpus of her teachings and her impact on the founding of the [[Shangpa Kagyu]] [[Buddhist]] spiritual lineage, known as one of the "“Eight Great Chariots of the Practice Lineages” ([[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]], ''sgrub brgyud shing rta chen po brgyad''), meaning one of the eight great Buddhist spiritual traditions that eventually were transmitted from [[India]] to [[Tibet]] .&lt;ref&gt;http://wordpress.tsadra.org/?p=785&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of the [[dakini]] Niguma as a spiritual practitioner, teacher, and lineage founder continues to the present day.

== Life and history ==
As secret, or hidden, as her name implies, there are only a few facts known about Niguma's life. This may partially be because of genuine lack of sources from both [[India]] and [[Tibet]] as well as the nature of the dakini. One author offers this explanation: {{quote|"The elusiveness of Niguma is typical of the lore of the dakini, the very embodiment of liminal spiritual experience. Additionally the difficulty of pinpointing historical information may well be due to the lack of ancient sources from India and the lack of concern about such mundane matters by the Tibetan masters who encountered her in dreams and visions and maybe in person. After all, when confronted with the blazing apparition of the resplendent and daunting dark dakini bestowing [[Twilight language|cryptic]] advice, a background check would be rendered irrelevant. Indian [[Buddhist]] [[hagiography|hagiographies]] are virtually unknown, whether of men or women. In Tibet, where hagiography became a prolific genre in its own right, those of women are extremely rare, for all the usual reasons. It is in the experience of those [[pawo|heroes]] who encountered the dakini that one finds the most information, and these experiences are invested with the value of spiritual meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Harding. ''Niguma, Lady of Illusion''. Snow Lion Publications. 2010. pp. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;}}

What most sources agree upon is that Niguma was born into a rich [[Brahmin]] family in the town (or monastery) of Peme in [[Kashmir]]&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Harding. ''Niguma, Lady of Illusion''. Snow Lion Publications. 2010. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; in the 10th or 11th century. Her father was named Santivarman ([[Standard Tibetan|Tib.]]: ''Zhi ba’i go cha'') and her mother was called Shrimati ([[Standard Tibetan|Tib.]]: ''dPal gyi blo gros ma'').&lt;ref&gt;Kongtrul, Jamgon; Zangpo, Ngawang (2003). ''Timeless Rapture: Inspired Verses of the Shangpa Masters.'' Ithaca, New York, USA: Snow Lion Publications. p. 229. {{ISBN|978-1-55939-204-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordpress.tsadra.org/?p=785]&lt;/ref&gt; According to different sources, Niguma was either the sister or consort of Naropa.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Harding. ''Niguma, Lady of Illusion''. Snow Lion Publications. 2010. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Her family relationship with Naropa is not entirely clear from the existing sources. One scholar who has done extensive research presents and discusses the available evidence and concludes that Niguma was indeed Naropa's older sister, not his wife or consort.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Harding. ''Niguma, Lady of Illusion''. Snow Lion Publications. 2010. pp. 3-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Previous incarnations==

Niguma was considered an emanation of the great dakini [[Mandarava]], [[Guru Rinpoche]]'s foremost Indian disciple.&lt;ref&gt;Kongtrul, Jamgon; Zangpo, Ngawang (2003). ''Timeless Rapture: Inspired Verses of the Shangpa Masters.'' Ithaca, New York, USA: Snow Lion Publications. {{ISBN|978-1-55939-204-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachers==
There is almost no information about Niguma's teachers in the extant sources. As one scholar writes: {{quote|"The only specific information about Niguma's teachers that I have from my sources is her connection with a certain [[Lawapa|Lavapa]], according to two accounts by [[Taranatha]]. However Lavapa is not mentioned by name in Niguma's ''Life Story'', where it says only that 'she directly saw the truth of the nature of phenomena just by hearing some instructive advice from ''a few adept masters''.' The only two named masters in the ''Life Story'' are Naropa and [[Ratnavajra]], and then only as cohabitants in [[Kashmir]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah Harding (lama)|Sarah Harding]]. ''Niguma, Lady of Illusion''. Snow Lion Publications. 2010. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, from the perspective of the spiritual lineage, it is said that Niguma's spiritual realization originates directly from the [[Vajradhara|Buddha Vajradhara]], rather than from any living human teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Kongtrul, Jamgon; Zangpo, Ngawang (2003). ''Timeless Rapture: Inspired Verses of the Shangpa Masters.'' Ithaca, New York, USA: Snow Lion Publications. p. 227. {{ISBN|978-1-55939-204-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Harding. "Seeking Niguma: Lady of Illusion." http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Niguma (2010). Accessed 5-7-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable students and the transmission of Niguma's lineages==

===Sukhasiddhi===
There is some evidence that the great [[dakini]] and Vajrayana teacher [[Sukhasiddhi]] may have been a student of Niguma's. Other evidence indicates that they may never have met even while living during the same time period. Both Niguma and Sukhasiddhi were teachers of [[Khyungpo Neljor]], and both Niguma and Sukhasiddhi are credited with the formation of the [[Shangpa Kagyu]] lineage of [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sukhasiddhi.org/about/lineage/niguma-story/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marpa Lotsawa, or Marpa the Translator===
The great meditation master and translator, [[Marpa Lotsawa]] received teachings from Niguma on at least two occasions. Marpa is said to have visited Niguma each time he traveled to [[India]]. Sources say that he sought out Niguma on the advice of [[Naropa]].&lt;ref&gt;Kongtrul, Jamgon; Zangpo, Ngawang (2003). ''Timeless Rapture: Inspired Verses of the Shangpa Masters.'' Ithaca, New York, USA: Snow Lion Publications. p. 227. {{ISBN|978-1-55939-204-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Harding. ''Niguma, Lady of Illusion''. Snow Lion Publications. 2010. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The story is told thusly, in ''The Life of Marpa'':{{quote|Naropa said, "On the shores of the poison lake in the South, in the [[charnel ground]] of Sosadvipa,&lt;ref&gt;Also known as ''Sosaling'' in Tibetan, Harding p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; is Jnanadakini Adorned with Bone Ornaments. Whoever encounters her is liberated. Go before her and request the ''Catuhpitha''. You can also request of the kusulus there whatever teachings you desire."
Having arrived in the charnel grounds at Sosadvipa, Marpa met this [[yogini]], who was living in a woven grass dome. offering her a mandala of gold, he supplicated her. She joyfully gave him the full [[Abhisheka|abhiseka]] and oral instructions on ''Catuhpitha''.&lt;ref&gt;Kongtrul, Jamgon; Zangpo, Ngawang (2003). ''Timeless Rapture: Inspired Verses of the Shangpa Masters.'' Ithaca, New York, USA: Snow Lion Publications. pp. 227-228. {{ISBN|978-1-55939-204-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Another source says that Marpa's first visit to Niguma was suggested by [[Naropa]] and that a later visit to Niguma was suggested by [[Shantibhadra]]. During the first meeting, Marpa received the ''Catuhpitha'' empowerment and instructions. During his second visit with Niguma, he received prophecy about meeting Naropa again, even though Naropa had already died.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Harding. Niguma, Lady of Illusion. Snow Lion Publications. 2010. p. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Khyungpo Neljor===
Niguma had many important students during her lifetime. The Tibetan [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|meditation master]] [[Khyungpo Neljor]] ({{bo|w=khyung po rnal 'byor}}) stands out both for his intensive travel to seek teachings and transmissions from qualified masters and also for receiving the entire corpus of teachings from Niguma that would become the basis of the [[Shangpa Kagyu]] lineage. Khyungpo Neljor traveled to Nepal and India seeking teachings and transmissions from a variety of teachers, including Niguma.&lt;ref&gt;Kongtrul, Jamgon; Zangpo, Ngawang (2003). ''Timeless Rapture: Inspired Verses of the Shangpa Masters.'' Ithaca, New York, USA: Snow Lion Publications. p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Niguma's realization, and teaching style, can be seen in the description of Khyngpo Neljor meeting Niguma for the first time. While in India studying with various teachers, Khyungpo Neljor asked those he met if there were any teachers who had met the Buddha [[Vajradhara]]. He was told that Niguma had. So, he sought out Niguma in order to receive even higher levels of teaching from her. He found the [[dakini]] Niguma in the Sosa [[Charnel ground|charnal ground]] of eastern India.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Gardener. ''Kungpo Neljor.''http://www.treasuryoflives.org/biographies/view/Khyungpo-Naljor/6285. Accessed 5/7/16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Eight_great_charnel_grounds&lt;/ref&gt; It is traditional for a student to request teachings and transmissions three times before they are bestowed. When Khyungpo Neljor first requested transmissions, Niguma is said to have replied in the [[Twilight language|code-language]] of the dakinis: "I am a flesh-eating dakini!" One source says that she claimed to be the queen of the cannibals.&lt;ref&gt;Kongtrul, Jamgon; Zangpo, Ngawang (2003). ''Timeless Rapture: Inspired Verses of the Shangpa Masters.'' Ithaca, New York, USA: Snow Lion Publications. p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally when Khyngpo Neljor again asked for transmissions, Niguma demanded gold from him. He had been traveling with great amounts of gold in order to make offerings to any teacher he met. When he offered the gold to Niguma, she threw it up into the air and it scattered throughout the forest. Then,{{quote|. . . her retinue of ḍākinī formed a [[Mandala|maṇḍala]], bestowing on Khyungpo Naljor the initiation of the [[Dream yoga|Illusory Body]] (''sgyu lus'') and [[Dream yoga|Dream Yoga]], two sections that make up the Nigu Chodruk (''ni gu chos drug''), or Six Yogas of Niguma. Niguma then transported him to a golden mountain summit where she bestowed the complete Six Yogas, the Dorje Tsikang (''rdo rje tshig rkang'') and the Gyuma Lamrim (''sgyu ma lam rim'').&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Gardener. ''Kungpo Neljor.''http://www.treasuryoflives.org/biographies/view/Khyungpo-Naljor/6285. Accessed 5/7/16&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Khungpo Neljor then returned to Tibet, and established a monastery at Zhangzhong in the Shang region in western [[Ü-Tsang|Tsang]]. This was his main seat, and he became known as the Lama of Shang. Although he was reputed to have founded hundreds of monasteries and had thousands of students, he passed the teachings of Niguma to only one of his students, [[Mochok Rinchen Tsondru]]. The [[Shangpa Kagyu|Shangpa lineage]] is often referred to as the "secret lineage" because Niguma instructed [[Khyungpo Neljor]] to transmit the teachings to only one student for the first seven generations beginning with [[Vajradhara]] and Niguma. Niguma then passed the lineage to [[Khyungpo Neljor]] who passed it to [[Mokchokpa Rinchen Tsondru]] (1110-1170). After that, Niguma's lineage went to [[Wonton Kyergngpa]] (or [[Chokyi Senge]], 1143-1216), [[Sangye Nyenton]] (or [[Rigongpa]], 1175-1247/1255?), and [[Drogon Sangye Tonpa]] (1207-1278). At this point, the lineage stream was opened up and teachings and practices were given to many others.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Harding. ''Niguma, Lady of Illusion''. Snow Lion Publications. 2010. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thang Tong Gyalpo===
The famous architect, scholar, and [[yogi]] [[Thang Tong Gyalpo]] (1385&amp;ndash;1464[[Common Era|CE]]&lt;ref&gt;Cyrus Stearns. ''King of the Empty Plain: The Tibetan Iron Bridge Builder Tangtong Gyalpo''. (2007).

) was one of Niguma's students,&lt;ref&gt;[http://tbrc.org/link?RID=P2778 TBRC Person P2778: thang stong rgyal po] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219092328/http://tbrc.org/link?RID=P2778 |date=2007-12-19 }}, Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center&lt;/ref&gt; yet in a unique way. He was instructed by Niguma in a vision two to three centuries after she lived.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Harding. Niguma, Lady of Illusion. Snow Lion Publications. 2010. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; He is well known for being a great Buddhist [[adept]], a yogi, physician, blacksmith, architect, and a pioneering [[civil engineer]]. He is considered a reincarnation of [[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen]] and founded the Iron Chain lineage ({{bo|w=thang lugs}}) of the [[Shangpa Kagyu]] school of Tibetan Buddhism which was founded by Niguma.

==Niguma's teachings and spiritual practices==

===Overview===
The legacy of Niguma's teachings and spiritual practices is still available today within the [[Shangpa Kagyu]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shangpa.net/spip.php?article24 accessed 5-11-16&lt;/ref&gt; Included in the corpus are songs and prayers (including aspiration prayers),&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Harding. ''Niguma, Lady of Illusion''. Snow Lion Publications. 2010. pp. 193-197.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[sadhana]] cycle called ''The Six Dharmas of Niguma'' (see below),&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Harding. ''Niguma, Lady of Illusion''. Snow Lion Publications. 2010. pp. 135-142 and pp. 183-192.&lt;/ref&gt; [[mahamudra]] practices,&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Harding. ''Niguma, Lady of Illusion''. Snow Lion Publications. 2010. pp. 143-152.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as unique sadhana practice cycles for [[Chakrasamvara]],&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Harding. ''Niguma, Lady of Illusion''. Snow Lion Publications. 2010. pp. 167-176.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hevajra]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Harding. ''Niguma, Lady of Illusion''. Snow Lion Publications. 2010. pp. 177-182.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples of songs and prayers ===
Like other early Indian [[mahasiddha]]s, Niguma is known for her oral teachings in the form of songs. Here are both songs to Niguma and songs by Niguma.

{{quote|''A Song of Niguma''

When one realizes that our many thoughts of anger and desire,&lt;br /&gt;
which churn the ocean of Samsara,&lt;br /&gt;
are devoid of any self-nature,&lt;br /&gt;
everything becomes a land of gold, my child.&lt;br /&gt;
When one meditates that magiclike phenomena&lt;br /&gt;
are all like magical illusions,&lt;br /&gt;
one will attain magiclike buddhahood,&lt;br /&gt;
[and all of the five paths and ten stages.]*&lt;br /&gt;
This, through the power of devotion!

&lt;ref&gt;Note: This extra line occurs only in a brief history of the Shangpa tradition by Jonang Jetsun Taranatha&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Translated from the Tibetan by Sherab Drime [TSD]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/Niguma&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|''Niguma's Song of Illusion''

If you practice illusion-like meditation&lt;br /&gt;
On illusion-like phenomena,&lt;br /&gt;
Illusion-like Buddhahood will arise&lt;br /&gt;
Through the power of your devotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naturaldharma.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Songs of Female Masters&lt;br /&gt;
Translated by Lama Willa Miller at the Natural Dharma Fellowship}}

{{quote|''Words of Dakini Niguma''

What throws you down into samsara's deep ocean&lt;br /&gt;
Are these thoughts of attachment and anger.&lt;br /&gt;
But realize they don't truly exist,&lt;br /&gt;
And all is an island of gold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ktgrinpoche.org/songs/words-dakini-niguma&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|''Vajra Verses of the Self-Liberating Great Seal''

Nature of mind,&lt;br /&gt;
Wish-fulfilling jewel, to you I bow.&lt;br /&gt;
Wishing to attain perfect enlightenment,&lt;br /&gt;
Visualize your body clearly as the deity&lt;br /&gt;
To purify ordinary thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;
Develop a noble intention to help others&lt;br /&gt;
And pure devotion to your spiritual master.&lt;br /&gt;
Don’t dwell on your spiritual master or the deity.&lt;br /&gt;
Don’t bring anything to mind,&lt;br /&gt;
Be it real or imagined.&lt;br /&gt;
Rest uncontrived in the innate state.&lt;br /&gt;
Your own mind, uncontrived, is the body of ultimate enlightenment.&lt;br /&gt;
To remain undistracted within this is meditation’s essential point.&lt;br /&gt;
Realize the great, boundless, expansive state.&lt;br /&gt;
Myriad thoughts of anger and desire&lt;br /&gt;
Propel you within the seas of existence.&lt;br /&gt;
Take the sharp sword of the unborn state&lt;br /&gt;
And cut through them to their lack of intrinsic nature.&lt;br /&gt;
When you cut a tree’s root,&lt;br /&gt;
Its branches won’t grow&lt;br /&gt;
On a bright ocean,&lt;br /&gt;
Bubbles emerge then dissolve back into the water.&lt;br /&gt;
Likewise, thoughts are nothing but the nature of reality:&lt;br /&gt;
Don’t regard them as faults. Relax.&lt;br /&gt;
When you have no clinging to what appears, what arises,&lt;br /&gt;
It frees itself within its own ground.&lt;br /&gt;
Appearances, sound, and phenomena are your own mind.&lt;br /&gt;
There are no phenomena apart from mind.&lt;br /&gt;
Mind is free from birth, cessation,&lt;br /&gt;
And formulation.&lt;br /&gt;
Those who know mind’s nature&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy the five senses’ pleasures&lt;br /&gt;
But do not stray from the nature of reality.&lt;br /&gt;
On an island of gold,&lt;br /&gt;
You search in vain for earth and stones.&lt;br /&gt;
In the equanimity of the great absolute expanse,&lt;br /&gt;
There is no acceptance or rejection,&lt;br /&gt;
No states of meditation or postmeditation.&lt;br /&gt;
When you actualize that state,&lt;br /&gt;
It is spontaneously present,&lt;br /&gt;
Fulfilling beings’ hopes&lt;br /&gt;
Like a wish-fulfilling jewel.&lt;br /&gt;
Persons of the highest, middle, and common levels of capability&lt;br /&gt;
Should learn this in stages suitable to their understanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kongtrul, Jamgon (2003). ''Timeless Rapture: Inspired Verses of the Shangpa Masters''. Snow Lion Publications., p.47&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The Six Dharmas of Niguma or The Six Yogas of Niguma?===
Niguma brought forth a [[Tantra|tantric]] [[sadhana]] cycle, a cohesive set of spiritual practices, referred to properly as the ''Vajra Lines of the Six Dharmas'', sometimes also referred to as the ''Six Yogas of Niguma''. This is a parallel to the more well known ''[[Six Yogas of Naropa]]''. Yet, for both Niguma's and [[Naropa|Naropa's]] [[Vajrayana]] sadhana cycles, it is more accurate to use the term ''six dharmas''. {{quote|"The term ''yoga (sbyor ba)'' is never used for this set of practices in Tibetan, and they should not be confused with the [[Kalachakra|Kālacaka]] tradition's group of six practices that ''are'' called ''yogas''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Peter Alan|title=Mahamudra and Related Instructions|year=2011|publisher=Wisdom Publications|location=Somerville, MA|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''Six Dharmas of Niguma'' are classified as [[Completion stage|completion]] stage (''rdzogs rim'') practices focusing on controlling and refining the channels, winds, and energies of the [[subtle body]].

Details of the [[sadhana]] cycle brought forth by Niguma can be found in ''Selected Works of the Dalai Lama: The Tantric Yogas of Sister Niguma'' compiled, edited, and translated by Glenn H. Mullin, 1985, Snow Lion Publications.

Additional details of the ''Nigh Chosdrug'', or ''Six Yogas of Sister Niguma'' can be found here:http://yoniversum.nl/daktexts/niguchos.html

An interesting comparison of ''The Six Dharmas of Niguma'' with ''The [[Six Yogas|Six Dharmas of Naropa]]'' can be found in ''Niguma, Lady of Illusion'' by Sarah Harding, pp.&amp;nbsp;135–136.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="955">The '''Orebites''' ({{lang-cz|Orebité}}) were followers of the [[Hussites]] in Eastern Bohemia.  The founders took part in the procession on Mount [[Oreb (hill)|Oreb]] near  [[Třebechovice pod Orebem]].  Later most of the noble supporters belonged to the East Bohemian church known as the ''[[Bohemian Brethren]]''.  The ideological founder of the Orebites was a priest named [[Ambrož Hradecký]].  Leaders included [[Hynek Krušina of Lichtenburg]] and [[Diviš Bořek of Miletínek]], captain of the Hussites in Eastern and Central Bohemia.  The Orebites were instrumental in the burning of the Benedictine monastery in [[Mnichovo Hradiště]] in the early summer of 1420, and in the autumn of that year they supported the rest of the Hussites at the [[Battle of Vyšehrad]].  In 1423 they merged with the ''[[Sirotci]]'' of [[Jan Žižka]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5343">The '''Pana-Wave Laboratory''' ({{lang-ja|パナウェーブ研究所}}) is a  [[Japanese new religions|Japanese new religious group]] or "Shinshūkyō". Estimates of membership range from several hundred to 1,200.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Metropolis (free magazine)|Metropolis]]'', "Fortean Japan", 27 June 2008, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
Pana-Wave is an offshoot of a religious group called [[Chino-Shoho]] ("True Law of Chino") based in [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]], [[Tokyo]], founded by a woman called Yuko Chino in 1977 and combining elements of Christianity, Buddhism and New Age doctrines. 

In the mid 1980s, members calling themselves the "scientific faction", and warning of the evils of [[electromagnetic waves]] (which the group claimed were causing catastrophic environmental destruction and climate change) built the Pana-Wave Laboratory in [[Fukui Prefecture]] in an area they believed was less at risk from electromagnetic pollution. Members started to dress only in white in the mid 1990s, in the belief that this would protect them from harmful "[[scalar (physics)|scalar]] electromagnetic waves", which they claimed were being used against them by [[communist]]s to try to kill their leader. 

In 1994 the group formed a convoy of white vans which traveled around rural Japan searching for a place least at risk from harmful electromagnetic radiation and away from power lines, and setting up camp in remote locations for months on end and covering everything in white. They also took their leader Chino when she was ill with cancer into the mountains of Japan to search for a safe place where waves couldn't harm her anymore. They believed that if the waves got to their leader that all of mankind would all at once be destroyed.

== Incidents in 2003 ==
They first attracted attention in March 2003, when they attempted (and failed) to capture [[Tama-chan]], an Arctic [[pinniped|seal]] which had become a national celebrity in Japan since showing up in [[Tama River]] in [[Tokyo]] the previous year. The group believed that the seal had been led astray by electromagnetic waves, and claimed that [[End time|doomsday]] would somehow be averted if the seal was returned to Arctic waters. They had even built two swimming pools, lined in white, in a compound in [[Yamanashi Prefecture]] in which to hold the seal until it could be transferred to the Arctic. 

The group made national headlines in April when the convoy was ordered by police to move on from a road in [[Gifu Prefecture]] and refused, resulting in a stand-off which was reported in the national media. Pana-Wave alleged that a close encounter with an undiscovered 10th planet, predicted for 15 May that year, would cause the Earth's poles to flip over and lead to catastrophic [[earthquake]]s and [[tsunami]]s which would destroy most of humankind, and that they were looking for a safe location to ride out the catastrophe. TV images showed members dressed completely in white, complete with white hoods, surgical masks and white boots. Their vehicles were decorated with swirl patterns which they believed neutralised the invisible waves, and even the steering wheel was covered in white plaster. Nearby trees, bushes and crash barriers were also covered in white fabric. TV crews were first shunned by members who feared that TV cameras were emitting harmful waves, but were later allowed closer as long as they covered themselves and their equipment in white material.

This camp was eventually broken up by three hundred police, some in riot gear, who threatened to arrest them for obstructing traffic. The convoy moved on, setting up camp intermittently, but many in Japan were unnerved by the group, which evoked memories of [[Aum Shinrikyo]], a religious terrorist group which carried out the deadly [[sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway]] in 1995, and the convoy continued being turned away from village after village. In the lead-up to the supposed doomsday, some one hundred riot police and TV crew followed the highly photogenic convoy around rural Japan for several weeks to keep tabs on their activities. 

On 14 May, the day before the predicted doomsday, police raided twelve locations associated with the group on the pretext of minor vehicle registration offences. However, nothing was found which suggested that they posed a danger to society. 

When the May 15 doomsday passed with nothing more serious than a minor earthquake in Tokyo which injured one boy who fell off his bed and broke an arm, a member thought to be Chino's second-in-command made a statement that they believed that they had miscalculated the date, and a new date of May 22 was set. However, as this date again passed without incident, media attention faded and the group sank back into obscurity.

On 25 October 2006, Chino died aged 72.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1830">{{Priesthoods of ancient Rome}}
In [[ancient Rome]], the '''''quindecimviri sacris faciundis''''' were the fifteen (''quindecim'') members of a [[Collegium (ancient Rome)|college (''collegium'')]] with priestly duties. Most notably they guarded the [[Sibylline Books]], scriptures which they consulted and interpreted at the request of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]. This ''collegium'' also oversaw the worship of any foreign gods which were introduced to Rome.

Originally these duties had been performed by ''duumviri'' (or ''duoviri''), two men of [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] status. Their number was increased to ten by a Licinio-Sextian law in 367 BC, which also required for half of the priests to be ''[[plebs]]''. During the [[Roman Republic#Mid-Republic_.28264.E2.80.93133_BC.29|Middle Republic]], members of the college were admitted through [[co-option]].

At some point in the third century BC, several priesthoods, probably including the ''quindecimviri'', began to be elected through the [[Tribal Assembly|voting tribes]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lintott]], ''The Constitution of the Roman Republic'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), pp. 183–184 [https://books.google.com/books?id=yaFPohP2lB8C&amp;pg=PA183&amp;dq=%22quindecimviri+sacris+faciundis%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22quindecimviri%20sacris%20faciundis%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Religious fanaticism''' is uncritical zeal or with an obsessive enthusiasm related to one's own, or one's group's, devotion to a [[religion]]&amp;nbsp;– a form of human [[fanaticism]] which could otherwise be expressed in one's other involvements and participation, including employment, role, and partisan affinities.

==Features==
Steffen gives several features associated with religious fanaticism or extremism:

* "Spiritual needs"... human beings have a spiritual longing for understanding and meaning, and given the mystery of [[existence]], that spiritual quest can only be fulfilled through some kind of relationship with ultimacy, whether or not that takes the form as a "transcendent other."  Religion has power to meet this need for meaning and transcendent relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idSteffen2007|Steffen, Lloyd.]] p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Attractiveness"... it presents itself in such a way that those who find their way into it come to express themselves in ways consistent with the particular vision of ultimacy at the heart of this religious form.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idSteffen2007|Steffen, Lloyd.]] p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A "live option"... it is present to the moral consciousness as a live option that addresses spiritual need and satisfies human longing for meaning, power, and belonging.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idSteffen2007|Steffen, Lloyd.]] p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of religious fanaticism==

===Christianity===
{{see also|Christianity and violence}}
Ever since Christianity was established, some of those in authority have sought to expand and control the church, often through the fanatical use of force.  Grant Shafer says, "Jesus of Nazareth is best known as a preacher of nonviolence"
&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idShafer2004|Shafer, Grant.]] p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;, although in Matthew 10:34 he says, "Think not that I am come to send peace on earth; I came not to send peace, but a sword."
The start of Christian fanatic rule came with the Roman Emperor [[Constantine I]] as Catholicism.  [[J. Harold Ellens|Ellens]] says, "When Christianity came to power in the empire of Constantine, it proceeded almost to viciously repress all non-Christians and all Christians who did not line up with official Orthodox ideology, policy, and practice".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idEllens2004|Ellens, J. Harold.]] pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of Christians who didn't line up with Orthodox ideology is the [[Donatists]], who "refused to accept repentant clergy who had formerly given way to apostasy when persecuted".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idShafer2004|Shafer, Grant.]] p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;
Fanatic Christian activity, as Catholicism, continued into the Middle Ages with the [[Crusades]].  These wars were attempts by the Catholics, sanctioned by the [[Pope]], to reclaim the [[Holy Land]] from the [[Muslims]]. However many Catholics see the crusades as a just war in self-defense. Charles Selengut, in his book ''Sacred Fury: Understanding Religious Violence'', said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Crusades were very much holy wars waged to maintain Christianity's theological and social control. On their way to conquering the Holy Land from the Muslims by force of arms, the crusaders destroyed dozens of Jewish communities and killed thousands because the Jews would not accept the Christian faith. Jews had to be killed in the religious campaign because their very existence challenged the sole truth espoused by the Christian Church.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idSelengut2008|Selengut, Charles. "Sacred Fury: Understanding Religious Violence."]] p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Shafer adds that, "When the crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099, they killed Muslims, Jews, and native Christians indiscriminately".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idShafer2004|Shafer, Grant.]] p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another prominent form of fanaticism according to some came a few centuries later with the [[Spanish Inquisition]].  The Inquisition was the monarchy's way of making sure their people stayed within Catholic Christianity.  Selengut said, "The inquisitions were attempts at self-protection and targeted primarily "internal enemies" of the church".&lt;ref name="SelengutCharles"&gt;[[#Reference-idSelengut2008|Selengut, Charles.]] p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  The driving force of the Inquisition was the Inquisitors, who were responsible for spreading the truth of Christianity.  Selengut continues, saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The inquisitors generally saw themselves as educators helping people maintain correct beliefs by pointing out errors in knowledge and judgment... Punishment and death came only to those who refused to admit their errors ... during the Spanish Inquisitions of the fifteenth century, the clear distinction between confession and innocence and remaining in error became muddled.... The investigators had to invent all sorts of techniques, including torture, to ascertain whether ... new converts' beliefs were genuine.&lt;ref name="SelengutCharles" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Islam===
{{See also|Khawarij}}
[[Islamic extremism|Extremism within Islam]] goes back to the 7th century to the [[Kharijites]]. From their essentially political position, they developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shiʿa Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to [[Takfir]], whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/another-battle-with-islams-true-believers/article20802390/|title=Another battle with Islam’s ‘true believers’|work=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819100539/http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |archivedate=2013-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/fruits-of-the-tree-of-extremism|title=Imam Mohamad Jebara: Fruits of the tree of extremism|author=Mohamad Jebara More Mohamad Jebara|work=Ottawa Citizen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hamid Mir interviewing Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri 2001.jpg|thumb|right|[[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] have promoted the overthrow of secular governments.]]
[[Sayyid Qutb]], a figurehead of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in Egypt, was influential in promoting a [[Pan-Islamism|Pan-Islamist]] ideology in the 1960s. When Qutb was executed by the [[Egyptian government]], [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] formed the organization [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] to replace the government with an [[Islamic state]] that would reflect Qutb's ideas for [[Islamic revival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Looming Tower]]|author=[[Lawrence Wright]]|publisher=Knopf|year=2006|isbn=0-375-41486-X|chapter = 2|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Qutbist]] ideology has been influential in [[Jihadism|jihadist]] movements that seek to overthrow secular governments, and Qutb's books have been frequently been cited by [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Anwar al-Awlaki]].&lt;ref name="NYT: path to terror"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/09/world/09awlaki.html?pagewanted=5&amp;hp|title=Imam’s Path From Condemning Terror to Preaching Jihad|author1=Scott Shane |author2=Souad Mekhennet |author3=Robert F.

Since [[Osama bin Laden]]'s [[fatwa]] in 1998, radical [[jihad]] has increasingly become an internationally recognized term. Bin Laden's concept, though, is very different from the actual meaning of the term.  In the religious context, ''jihad'' most nearly means "working urgently for a certain godly objective, generally an imperialist one".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idEllens2004|Ellens, J. Harold.]] p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The word jihad in Arabic means 'struggle'. The struggle can be a struggle of implementing the Islamic values in daily activities, a struggle with others to counter arguments against Islam, or self-defense when physically attacked because of belief in Islam. According to Steffen, there are portions of the Qur'an where military jihad is used.  As Steffen says, though, "Jihad in these uses is always defensive.  Not only does ‘jihad' not endorse acts of military aggression, but ‘jihad' is invoked in Qur'anic passages to indicate how uses of force are always subject to restraint and qualification".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idSteffen2007|Steffen, Lloyd.]] p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of jihad differs greatly from the kind most commonly discussed today.

Thomas Farr, in an essay titled "Islam's Way to Freedom", says that, "Even though most Muslims reject violence, the [[extremists]]' use of sacred texts lends their actions authenticity and recruiting power". (Freedom 24)  He goes on to say, "The radicals insist that their central claim – God's desire for Islam's triumph – requires no interpretation. According to them, true Muslims will pursue it by any means necessary, including dissimulation, civil [[coercion]], and the killing of innocents". (Freedom 24)

According to certain observers this disregard for others and rampant use of violence is markedly different from the peaceful message that jihad is meant to employ. Although fanatic jihadists have committed many terroristic acts throughout the world, perhaps the best known is the [[September 11 attacks]].  According to Ellens, the al-Qaeda members who took part in the terrorist attacks did so out of their belief that, by doing it, they would "enact a devastating blow against the evil of secularized and non-Muslim America.  They were cleansing this world, God's temple".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idEllens2004|Ellens, J. Harold.]] p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solomon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɒ|l|ə|m|ə|n}}; {{lang-he-n|שְׁלֹמֹה}}, ''Shlomoh),''{{efn|{{Hebrew Name|שְׁלֹמֹה|[[Shlomo|Šlōmō]]|Šelōmō}} &lt;small&gt;[[ISO 259-3]]&lt;/small&gt; ''Šlomo''; {{lang-syr|ܫܠܝܡܘܢ}} ''Šlemūn''; {{lang-ar|سُليمان}} ''{{transl |ar|ALA-LC|Sulaymān}}'', also [[varieties of Arabic|colloquially]]: ''{{transl|ara|Silimān}}'' or ''{{transl|ara|Slemān}}''; {{lang-el|Σολομών}} ''Solomōn''; {{lang-la|Salomon}})}} also called '''Jedidiah''' (Hebrew {{Hebrew |יְדִידְיָהּ}} ''Yedidyah''), was, according to the [[Hebrew Bible]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Books of Kings|Book of Kings]]: 1 Kings 1–11; [[Book of Chronicles]]: 1 Chronicles 28–29, 2 Chronicles 1–9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quran]], and [[Hadith]]s, a fabulously wealthy and wise [[Kings of Israel and Judah|king of Israel]] who succeeded his father, [[King David]].&lt;ref name='JewEnc'&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Barton |first=George A. |encyclopedia=Jewish Encyclopedia |title=Temple of Solomon|url= http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14310-temple-of-solomon|accessdate=2018-10-24 |year=1906 |pages=98–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conventional dates of Solomon's reign are circa 970 to 931&amp;nbsp;BCE, normally given in alignment with the dates of David's reign. He is described as the third king of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Monarchy]], which would break apart into the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] and the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]] shortly after his death. Following the split, his [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] descendants ruled over Judah alone.

According to the [[Talmud]], Solomon is one of the 48 [[Prophets in Judaism|prophet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=[[Rashi]] |title=''to'' Megillah |at=14a}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Quran, he is considered a major [[Prophets of Islam|prophet]], and [[Muslim]]s generally refer to him by the Arabic variant [[Solomon in Islam|Sulayman]], son of [[David in Islam|David]].

The [[Hebrew Bible]] credits him as the builder of the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]] in Jerusalem,&lt;ref name='JewEnc'/&gt; beginning in the fourth year of his reign, using the vast wealth he and his father had accumulated. He dedicated the temple to [[Yahweh]], the God of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;1 Kings 5:3; 8:20&lt;/ref&gt; He is portrayed as great in [[Wisdom#Judaism|wisdom]], wealth and power beyond either of the previous kings of the country, but also as a king who sinned. His sins included [[idolatry]], marrying foreign women and, ultimately, turning away from Yahweh, and they led to the kingdom's being torn in two during the reign of his son [[Rehoboam]].&lt;ref name="HouseName"&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter J |last=Leithart |author-link=Peter J. Leithart |title=A House for My Name |page=157 |publisher=[[Canon Press]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-885767-69-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solomon is the subject of many other later references and legends, most notably in the 1st-century [[apocryphal]] work known as the [[Testament of Solomon]]. In the [[New Testament]], he is portrayed as a teacher of wisdom excelled by [[Jesus]],&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 12:42; Luke 11:31&lt;/ref&gt; and as arrayed in glory, but excelled by "the [[Lilium|lilies]] of the field".&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 6:28-29; Luke 12:27&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, in mostly non-biblical circles, Solomon also came to be known as a [[Magic (paranormal)|magician]] and an [[exorcist]], with numerous [[amulet]]s and medallion seals dating from the [[Hellenistic]] period invoking his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmc-terrasanta.org/en/archaeology-culture-and-other-religions.html?vid=3586 |title=Archaeology, Culture, and other Religions |publisher=FMC terra santa |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical account==
The life of Solomon is primarily described in the second [[Book of Samuel]], and by 1 [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] and 1 [[Books of Kings|Kings]]. His two names mean "[[Š-L-M|peaceful]]" and "[[wikt:ידיד|friend of God]]", both appropriate to the story of his rule.&lt;ref name=JE /&gt;

===Chronology===
The conventional dates of Solomon's reign are derived from [[biblical chronology]] and are set from c. 970 to 931&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;E. Clarity, 2012, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the [[Davidic line|Davidic dynasty]], to which King Solomon belongs, its chronology can be checked against datable Babylonian and Assyrian records at a few points, and these correspondences have allowed archaeologists to date its kings in a modern framework.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}{{dubious|No such widely accepted sources.|date=April 2018}} According to the most widely used chronology, based on that by Old Testament professor [[Edwin R. Thiele]], the death of Solomon and the division of his kingdom would have occurred in the spring of 931&amp;nbsp;BCE.{{Sfn|Thiele|1983|p=78}}

===Childhood===
Solomon was born in [[Jerusalem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1 Chronicles|14:4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second born child of [[David]] and his wife [[Bathsheba]], widow of [[Uriah the Hittite]]. The first child (unnamed in that account), a son conceived adulterously during Uriah's lifetime, had died as a punishment on account of the death of Uriah by David's order. Solomon had three named full brothers born to Bathsheba: [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]], Shammua, and Shobab,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1 Chronicles|3:5}}&lt;/ref&gt; besides six known older half-brothers born of as many mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1 Chronicles|3:1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The biblical narrative shows that Solomon served as a peace offering between God and David, due to his adulterous relationship with Bathsheba. In an effort to hide this sin, for example, he sent the woman's husband to battle, hoping that he would be killed there. After he died, David was finally able to marry his wife. As punishment, the first child, who was conceived during the adulterous relationship, died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Solomon|last=Vance|first=Jennifer|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2015|isbn=9781681461182|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solomon was born after David was forgiven. It is this reason why his name, which means peace, was chosen. Some historians cited that [[Nathan (prophet)|Nathan the Prophet]] brought up Solomon as his father was busy governing the realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Golden childhood. The Little People's Own Pleasure-Book of Delight and Instruction|last=|first=|publisher=Ward, Lock, and Co.|year=1878|isbn=|location=London|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could also be attributed to the notion that the prophet held great influence over David because he knew of his adultery, which was considered a grievous offense under the [[Law of Moses|Mosaic Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discovering Hope in the Psalms: A Creative Bible Study Experience|last=Farrel|first=Pam|last2=Jones|first2=Jean|publisher=Harvest House Publishers|year=2017|isbn=9780736969970|location=Eugene|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only during [[Absalom]]'s rebellion when Solomon started spending more time at David's side.

===Succession and administration===
[[File:Cornelis de Vos - The Anointing of Solomon.jpg|thumb|''The Anointing of Solomon '' by [[Cornelis de Vos]] (c. 1630). According to 1 [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 1:39, Solomon was [[Anointing|anointed]] by [[Zadok]].]]
According to the [[First Book of Kings]], when David was old, "he could not get warm".&lt;ref name="1 Kings 1 ESV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20kings%201;&amp;version=47; |title=1 Kings 1 (ESV) |publisher=BibleGateway.com |accessdate=2010-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; "So they sought a beautiful young woman throughout all the territory of Israel, and found [[Abishag]] the [[Shunamitism|Shunamite]], and brought her to the king. The young woman was very beautiful, and she was of service to the king and attended to him, but the king knew her not."&lt;ref name="1 Kings 1 ESV" /&gt;

While David was in this state, court factions were maneuvering for power. David's [[heir apparent]], [[Adonijah]], acted to have himself declared king, but was outmaneuvered by Bathsheba and the prophet [[Nathan (Prophet)|Nathan]], who convinced David to proclaim Solomon king according to his earlier promise (not recorded elsewhere in the biblical narrative),&lt;ref&gt;Lumby, J. R., [http://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_kings/1.htm Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on 1 Kings 1], accessed 24 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt; despite Solomon being younger than his brothers.

Solomon, as instructed by David, began his reign with an extensive purge, including his father's chief general, [[Joab]], among others, and further consolidated his position by appointing friends throughout the administration, including in religious positions as well as in civic and military posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|4:1-19|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that Solomon ascended to the throne when he was only about fifteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Bible Exposition Commentary, Volume 1|last=Wiersbe|first=Warren|publisher=Cook Communications|year=2003|isbn=9780781435314|location=Eastbourne|pages=496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solomon greatly expanded his military strength, especially the cavalry and chariot arms. He founded numerous colonies, some of which doubled as trading posts and military outposts.

Trade relationships were a focus of his administration. In particular he continued his father's very profitable relationship with the Phoenician king [[Hiram I]] of Tyre (see 'wealth' below); they sent out joint expeditions to the lands of [[Tarshish]] and [[Ophir]] to engage in the trade of luxury products, importing gold, silver, sandalwood, pearls, ivory, apes and peacocks. Solomon is considered the most wealthy of the Israelite kings named in the Bible.

===Wisdom===
[[File:Luca Giordano - Dream of Solomon - WGA09004.jpg|thumbnail|[[Luca Giordano]] – ''Dream of Solomon'' – God promises Solomon Wisdom.]]
Solomon was the biblical king most famous for his [[wisdom]]. In 1 Kings he sacrificed to God, and God later appeared to him in a dream&lt;ref&gt;1 Kings 3:3-15&lt;/ref&gt; asking what Solomon wanted from God. Solomon asked for wisdom. Pleased, God personally answered Solomon's prayer, promising him great wisdom because he did not ask for self-serving rewards like long life or the death of his enemies.[[File:Plaque Castelli Salomon Musée de Lille 130108.jpg|thumb|''The Judgment of Solomon'', painting on ceramic, Castelli, 18th century, Lille Museum of Fine Arts]]
Perhaps the best known story of his wisdom is the [[Judgment of Solomon]]; two women each lay claim to being the mother of the same child. Solomon easily resolved the dispute by commanding the child to be cut in half and shared between the two. One woman promptly renounced her claim, proving that she would rather give the child up than see it killed. Solomon declared the woman who showed [[compassion]] to be the true mother, entitled to the whole child.&lt;ref&gt;1 Kings 3:16-28&lt;/ref&gt;

Solomon was traditionally considered the author of several biblical books, "including not only the collections of [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], but also of [[Ecclesiastes]] and the [[Song of Solomon]] and the later apocryphal book the [[Wisdom of solomon|Wisdom of Solomon.]]"{{Sfn|Coogan|2009|p=375}}

===Wealth===
{{See also|Solomon's Temple}}
According to the Hebrew Bible, the [[United Monarchy|Israelite monarchy]] gained its highest splendour and wealth during Solomon's reign of 40 years. In a single year, according to {{bibleverse|1|Kings|10:14|HE}}, Solomon collected [[tribute]] amounting to 666 [[talent (weight)|talents]] (18,125 kilograms) of gold. Solomon is described as surrounding himself with all the luxuries and the grandeur of an [[Eastern world|Eastern]] monarch, and his government prospered. He entered into an alliance with [[Hiram I]], king of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], who in many ways greatly assisted him in his numerous undertakings.

===Construction projects===
[[File:Solomon and the Plan for the Temple.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Solomon planning the building of the temple.|Solomon and the plan for the [[First Temple]], illustration from a Bible card published by the Providence Lithograph Co.]]
[[File:SolomonsTemple.png|thumb|220px|A sketch of [[Solomon's Temple]], based on descriptions in the Scriptures.]]
[[File:Ingobertus 001.jpg|thumb|Artist's depiction of Solomon's court (Ingobertus, c. 880)]]
For some years before his death, David was engaged in collecting materials for building a temple in Jerusalem as a permanent home for [[Yahweh]] and the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. Solomon is described as undertaking the construction of the [[Solomon's Temple|temple]], with the help of an architect, also named [[Hiram Abiff|Hiram]], and other materials, sent from King Hiram of Tyre.

After the completion of the temple, Solomon is described in the biblical narrative as erecting many other buildings of importance in [[Jerusalem]]. For 13 years, he was engaged in the building of a royal palace on [[Ophel]] (a hilly promontory in central Jerusalem). This complex included buildings referred to as:
*The House of the Forest of the Lebanon
*The Hall or Porch of Pillars
*The Hall of the Throne or the Hall of Justice
as well as his own residence and a residence for his wife, Pharaoh's daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|7:1-8|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solomon also constructed great works for the purpose of securing a plentiful supply of water for the city, and the [[Millo]] ([[Septuagint]], ''Acra'') for the defense of the city. However, excavations of Jerusalem have shown a distinct lack of monumental architecture from the era, and remains of neither the Temple nor Solomon's palace have been found.

Solomon is also described as rebuilding cities elsewhere in Israel, creating the port of [[Ezion-Geber]], and constructing [[Palmyra]] in the wilderness as a commercial depot and military outpost. Although the location of the port of Ezion-Geber is known, no remains have ever been found. More archaeological success has been achieved with the major cities Solomon is said to have strengthened or rebuilt, for example, [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]] and [[Gezer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|9:15|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; These all have substantial ancient remains, including impressive six-chambered gates, and [[ashlar]] palaces; however it is no longer the scholarly consensus that these structures date to the time, according to the Bible, when Solomon ruled.&lt;ref name=Finkelstein /&gt;

According to the Bible, during Solomon's reign, Israel enjoyed great commercial prosperity, with extensive traffic being carried on by land with [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], [[Egypt]], and [[Arabia]], and by sea with [[Tarshish]], [[Ophir]], and [[South India]].

===Wives and concubines===
According to the biblical account, Solomon had 700 [[wives]] and 300 [[concubine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:3|NKJV}}; not in the 2 Chronicles account&lt;/ref&gt; The wives were described as foreign princesses, including [[Pharaoh's daughter (wife of Solomon)|Pharaoh's daughter]] &lt;ref&gt;See also {{bibleverse|1|Kings|3:1|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and women of [[Moab]], [[Ammon]], [[Edom]], [[Sidon]] and of the [[Hittites]]. His marriage to Pharaoh's daughter appears to have cemented a political alliance with Egypt whereas he clung to his other wives and concubines "in love".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:3|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only wife mentioned by name is [[Naamah (wife of Solomon)|Naamah]] the [[Ammonites (people)|Ammonite]], mother of Solomon's successor, [[Rehoboam]]. The biblical narrative notes with disapproval that Solomon permitted his foreign wives to import their national deities, building temples to [[Ashtoreth]] and [[Milcom]].

In the branch of literary analysis that examines the Bible, called [[higher criticism]], the story of Solomon falling into idolatry by the influence of [[Pharaoh's daughter (wife of Solomon)|Pharaoh's daughter]] and his other foreign wives is "customarily seen as the handiwork of the [[Documentary hypothesis|'deuteronomistic historian(s)']]", who are held to have written, compiled, or edited texts to legitimize the reforms of [[Hezekiah]]'s grandson, King [[Josiah]] who reigned from ca 641 BCE to 609 BCE (over 280 years after Solomon's death according to Bible scholars).&lt;ref name="HC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Loving too well: The negative portrayal of Solomon and the composition of the Kings history|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=13777356}} Retrieved on Jan. 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly consensus in this field holds that "Solomon's wives/women were introduced in the 'Josianic' (customarily Dtr) edition of Kings as a theological construct to blame the schism [between Judah and the Northern Kingdom of Israel] on his misdeeds".&lt;ref name="HC" /&gt;

===Relationship with Queen of Sheba===
{{Main article|Queen of Sheba}}
[[File:'The Visit of the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon', oil on canvas painting by Edward Poynter, 1890, Art Gallery of New South Wales.jpg|thumb|''The Visit of the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon'', oil on canvas painting by Edward Poynter, 1890]]
[[File:Saabaghiberti.jpg|thumb|200px|Renaissance relief of the Queen of Sheba meeting Solomon – [[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]]'s Gates of Paradise at the [[Florence Baptistry]]]]
In a brief, unelaborated, and enigmatic passage, the Hebrew Bible describes how the fame of Solomon's wisdom and wealth spread far and wide, so much so that the queen of [[Sheba]] decided that she should meet him. The queen is described as visiting with a number of gifts including gold, spices and precious stones. When Solomon gave her "all her desire, whatsoever she asked," she left satisfied ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+10%3A10&amp;version=NIV 1 Kings 10:10]).

Whether the passage is simply to provide a brief token, foreign witness of Solomon's wealth and wisdom, or whether there is meant to be something more significant to the queen's visit is unknown; nevertheless the visit of the Queen of Sheba has become the subject of numerous stories.

[[Sheba]] is typically identified as [[Sabaeans|Saba]], a nation once spanning the [[Red Sea]] on the coasts of what are now [[Eritrea]], [[Somalia]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Yemen]], in [[Arabia Felix]]. In a Rabbinical account (e.g. [[Targum Sheni]]), Solomon was accustomed to ordering the living creatures of the world to dance before him (Rabbinical accounts say that Solomon had been given control over all living things by Yahweh), but one day upon discovering that the mountain-cock or [[hoopoe]] (Aramaic name: ''nagar tura'') was absent, he summoned it to him, and the bird told him that it had been searching for somewhere new (see: [[s:Translation:Colloquy of the Queen of Sheba|Colloquy of the Queen of Sheba]]).

The bird had discovered a land in the east, exceedingly rich in gold, silver, and plants, whose capital was called ''Kitor'' and whose ruler was the Queen of Sheba, and the bird, on its own advice, was sent by Solomon to request the queen's immediate attendance at Solomon's court.

An Ethiopian account from the 14th century (''[[Kebra Nagast]]'') maintains that the Queen of Sheba had sexual relations with King Solomon and gave birth by the Mai Bella stream in the province of [[Hamasien]], [[Eritrea]]. The Ethiopian tradition has a [[Queen of Sheba#Ethiopian accounts|detailed account of the affair]]. The child was a son who went on to become [[Menelik I]], King of [[Kingdom of Axum|Axum]], and founded a [[Solomonic dynasty|dynasty]] that would reign as the first Jewish, then Christian [[Empire of Ethiopia]] for 2,900+ years (less one [[Zagwe dynasty|usurpation episode]], an interval of c. 133 years until a legitimate male heir regained the crown) until [[Haile Selassie]] was overthrown in 1974. Menelik was said to be a practicing Jew who was given a replica of the [[Ark of the Covenant]] by King Solomon; and, moreover, that the original was switched and went to [[Axum]] with him and his mother, and is still there, guarded by a single priest charged with caring for the artifact as his life's task.

The claim of such a lineage and of possession of the Ark has been an important source of legitimacy and prestige for the Ethiopian monarchy throughout the many centuries of its existence, and had important and lasting effects on Ethiopian culture as a whole. The Ethiopian government and church deny all requests to view the alleged ark.{{Efn|Recent History Channel promotional production about ''Indiana Jones's''{{citation needed|date=June 2008|reason=Title needed, IMDB search on Indiana Jones user:fabartus}} positive impact on archaeology (released Mid-May 2008, the week before the 22 May 2008 US release of [[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]); History Channel producers were shown interviewing the guardian priest, and expert discussions about the Ark were part of the fare.}}

Some classical-era Rabbis, attacking Solomon's moral character, have claimed instead that the child was an ancestor of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], who destroyed [[Solomon's temple]] some 300 years later.&lt;ref name="JewishEncyclopedia"/&gt;

===Sins and punishment===
[[File:Isaak Asknaziy 02.jpeg|thumb|left |"[[Ecclesiastes|Vanity of vanities; all is vanity"]] illustrates an old and meditative King Solomon by [[Isaak Asknaziy]].]]
According to {{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:4|HE}} Solomon's "wives turned his heart after other gods", their own national deities, to whom Solomon built temples, thus incurring divine anger and retribution in the form of the division of the kingdom after Solomon's death ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:9–13|HE}}).
{{bibleverse |1|Kings|11|HE}} describes Solomon's descent into idolatry, particularly his turning after [[Ashtoreth]], the goddess of the [[Sidonians]], and after [[Milcom]], the abomination of the [[Ammon]]ites. In {{bibleverse ||Deuteronomy|17:16–17|HE}}, a king is commanded not to multiply horses or wives, neither greatly multiply to himself gold or silver. Solomon sins in all three of these areas. Solomon collects [[666 (number)|666]] [[talent (measurement)|talents]] of gold each year ({{bibleverse |1|Kings|10:14|HE}}), a huge amount of money for a small nation like Israel. Solomon gathers a large number of horses and chariots and even brings in horses from Egypt. Just as {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|17|HE}} warns, collecting horses and chariots takes Israel back to Egypt. Finally, Solomon marries foreign women, and these women turn Solomon to other gods.

According to {{bibleverse |1|Kings|11:30–34|HE}} and {{bibleverse |1|Kings|11:9–13|HE}}, it was because of these sins that "the Lord punishes Solomon by removing 10 of the 12 Tribes of Israel from the Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20kings%2011&amp;version=NIV|title=NIV 1 Kings 11 (Solomon's Wives)|publisher=Bible Gateway|accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods. But he did not keep what the Lord commanded. Therefore the Lord said to Solomon, "Since this has been your practice and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes that I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you and will give it to your servant. Yet for the sake of David your father I will not do it in your days, but I will tear it out of the hand of your son. However, I will not tear away all the kingdom, but I will give one tribe to your son, for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem that I have chosen.}}

===Enemies===
Near the end of his life, Solomon was forced to contend with several enemies, including [[Hadad the Edomite|Hadad]] of [[Edom]], [[Rezon the Syrian|Rezon]] of [[Zobah]], and one of his officials named [[Jeroboam]] who was from the [[tribe of Ephraim]].

===Death, succession of Rehoboam, and kingdom division===
[[File:Kingdoms of Israel and Judah map 830.svg|thumb|250px|The [[United Monarchy]] breaks up, with Jeroboam ruling over the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] (blue on the map) and [[Rehoboam]] ruling the [[Kingdom of Judah]] to the south.]]
According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], Solomon is the last ruler of a united Kingdom of Israel. He dies of natural causes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/Kings.html |title=The Kingdom of Israel |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |accessdate=2010-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; at around 60 years of age. Upon Solomon's death, his son, [[Rehoboam]], succeeds him. However, ten of the [[Tribes of Israel]] refuse to accept him as king, splitting the [[United Monarchy]] in the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] under [[Jeroboam]], while Rehoboam continues to reign over the much smaller southern [[Kingdom of Judah]]. Henceforth the two kingdoms are never again united.

==Jewish scriptures==
King Solomon is one of the central biblical figures in [[Judaism|Jewish heritage]] that have lasting religious, national and political aspects. As the builder of the [[First Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]] and last ruler of the united [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] before its division into the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] and the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]], Solomon is associated with the peak "golden age" of the independent Kingdom of Israel as well as a source of judicial and religious wisdom. According to Jewish tradition, King Solomon wrote three [[books of the Bible]]:
* ''Mishlei'' ([[Book of Proverbs]]), a collection of fables and wisdom of life
* ''Kohelet'' ([[Ecclesiastes]]), a book of contemplation and his self-reflection.
* ''Shir ha-Shirim'' ([[Song of Songs]]), an unusual collection of poetry interspersed with verse, whose interpretation is either literal (i.e., a romantic and sexual relationship between a man and a woman) or metaphorical (a relationship between God and his people).

The Hebrew word "To Solomon" (which can also be translated as "by Solomon") appears in the title of two hymns, 72 and 127, in the book of [[Psalms]] (''Tehillim''), suggesting to some that Solomon wrote them.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Apocryphal texts==
Rabbinical tradition attributes the ''[[Wisdom of Solomon]]'' to Solomon, although this book was probably written in the 2nd century BCE. In this work, Solomon is portrayed as an [[astronomer]]. Other books of [[wisdom poetry]] such as the ''[[Odes of Solomon]]'' and the ''[[Psalms of Solomon]]'' also bear his name. The Jewish historian [[Eupolemus]], who wrote about 157&amp;nbsp;BCE, included copies of [[apocryphal]] letters exchanged between Solomon and the kings of [[Egypt]] and [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]].

The [[Gnostic]] ''[[Apocalypse of Adam]]'', which may date to the 1st or 2nd century, refers to a legend in which Solomon sends out an army of [[demon]]s to seek a virgin who had fled from him, perhaps the earliest surviving mention of the later common tale that Solomon controlled demons and made them his slaves. This tradition of Solomon's control over demons appears fully elaborated in the early [[pseudographical]] work called the ''[[Testament of Solomon]]'' with its elaborate and grotesque [[demonology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=897&amp;letter=S |title= Solomon, Testament of | website =Jewish Encyclopedia | accessdate=2010-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments against biblical description===
Historical evidence of King Solomon other than the biblical accounts has been so minimal that some scholars have understood the period of his reign as a 'Dark Age' (Muhly 1998). The first-century [[Roman Jews|Romano-Jewish]] scholar [[Josephus]] in ''[[Against Apion]]'', citing [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] court records and [[Menander]], gives a specific year during which [[King Hiram I]] of Tyre sent materials to Solomon for the construction of the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Against Apion]]'' i:17, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; However, no material evidence indisputably of Solomon's reign has been found. [[Yigael Yadin]]'s excavations at [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], [[Beit Shean]] and [[Gezer]] uncovered structures that he and others have argued date from Solomon's reign,{{Sfn|Dever|2001}} but others, such as [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Silberman]], argue that they should be dated to the [[Omrides|Omride]] period, more than a century after Solomon.&lt;ref name=Finkelstein&gt;{{Harvnb|Finkelstein|Silberman|2001|pages=186–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Solomon's Wealth and Wisdom.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Solomon's Wealth and Wisdom, as in 1 Kings 3:12–13, illustration from a Bible card published 1896 by the Providence Lithograph Company.]]

According to Finkelstein and Silberman, authors of ''[[The Bible Unearthed]]: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts'',{{Sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2001|page=133}} at the time of the kingdoms of David and Solomon, Jerusalem was populated by only a few hundred residents or less, which is insufficient for an empire stretching from the [[Euphrates]] to [[Eilath#Biblical references|Eilath]]. According to ''The Bible Unearthed'', archaeological evidence suggests that the kingdom of Israel at the time of Solomon was little more than a small city state, and so it is implausible that Solomon received tribute as large as 666 [[talent (weight)|talents]] of gold per year. Although both Finkelstein and Silberman accept that David and Solomon were real inhabitants of Judah about the 10th century BCE,{{Sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2006|page=20}} they claim that the earliest independent reference to the Kingdom of Israel is about 890&amp;nbsp;BCE, and for Judah about 750&amp;nbsp;BCE. They suggest that because of religious prejudice, the authors of the Bible suppressed the achievements of the [[Omrides]] (whom the Hebrew Bible describes as being [[polytheist]]), and instead pushed them back to a supposed golden age of Judaism and monotheists, and devotees of [[Yahweh]]. Some [[biblical minimalism|Biblical minimalists]] like [[Thomas L. Thompson]] go further, arguing that Jerusalem became a city and capable of being a state capital only in the mid-7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Thomas L., 1999, ''The Bible in History: How Writers Create a Past'', Jonathan Cape, London, {{ISBN|978-0-224-03977-2}} p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Finkelstein and others consider the claimed size of Solomon's temple implausible.

===Arguments in favour of biblical description===
These views are criticized by [[William G. Dever]],{{Sfn |Dever|2001|p=160}} and [[André Lemaire]],&lt;ref name="Ancient Israel p113"&gt;{{Citation | title=Ancient Israel: From Abraham to the Roman Destruction of the Temple | first=Hershel | last=Shanks | page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others. Lemaire states in ''Ancient Israel: From Abraham to the Roman Destruction of the Temple''&lt;ref name="Ancient Israel p113" /&gt; that the principal points of the biblical tradition of Solomon are generally trustworthy, although elsewhere he writes that he could find no substantiating archaeological evidence that supports the Queen of Sheba's visit to king Solomon, saying that the earliest records of trans-Arabian caravan voyages from Tayma and Sheba unto the Middle-Euphrates etc. occurred in the mid-8th century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;See: [http://www.digitorient.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Lemaire%20South%20Arabia.pdf Lemaire, South Arabia]. In [[André Lemaire]]'s own words: "The first mention of Sheba in Neo-Assyrian texts is to be dated mid-8th c. BCE with the story of a caravan of 200 camels coming from Tayma and Sheba to Hindanu (Middle-Euphrates) (Cavigneaux – Ismaïl 1990: 339–357; Frame 1995: 300; Younger 2003: 279–282; Holladay 2006: 319–321)."&lt;/ref&gt; placing a possible visit from the Queen of Sheba to Jerusalem around this time – some 250 years later than the timeframe traditionally given for king Solomon's reign.&lt;ref&gt;[[André Lemaire]], ''The Queen of Sheba and the Trade Between South Arabia and Judah'', pub. in ''Bayn ʻEver LaʻArav: Contacts between Arabic Literature and Jewish Literature in the Middle Ages and Modern Times'', volume 6; A Collection of Studies Dedicated to Prof. Yosef Tobi on the Occasion of his Retirement, ed. Ali A. Hussein and Ayelet Oettinger (Haifa: University of Haifa Press, 2013), xi–xxxiv&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Kitchen]] argues that Solomon ruled over a comparatively wealthy "mini-empire", rather than a small city-state, and considers 666 gold talents a modest amount of money. Kitchen calculates that over 30 years, such a kingdom might have accumulated up to 500 tons of gold, which is small compared to other examples, such as the 1,180 tons of gold that [[Alexander the Great]] took from Susa.{{Sfn | Kitchen |2003|p=135}} Similarly Kitchen&lt;ref name="Kitchen2003p123"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kitchen|2003|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others consider the temple of Solomon a reasonable and typically sized structure for the region at the time. Dever states "that we now have direct Bronze and Iron Age parallels for every feature of the 'Solomonic temple' as described in the Hebrew Bible".&lt;ref name="Dever 2001 145"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dever|2001|p= 145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle way===
Some scholars have charted a middle path between minimalist scholars like Finkelstein, Silberman, and Philip Davies&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Philip R. 1992. In Search of 'Ancient Israel': A Study in Biblical Origins. London: Bloomsbury Publishing, T and T Clark.&lt;/ref&gt; (who believes that “Solomon is a totally invented character”)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.bibleodyssey.org/tools/video-gallery/d/david-and-solomon-davies |title=David and Solomon |website= www.bibleodyssey.org |language=en |access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the one hand, and maximalist scholars like Dever, Lemaire, and Kitchen on the other hand. For instance, the archaeologist Avraham Faust has argued that biblical depictions of Solomon date to later periods and do overstate his wealth, buildings, and kingdom, but that Solomon did have an acropolis and ruled over a polity larger than Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Faust, Avraham. 2012. The Archaeology of Israelite Society in Iron Age II. Translated by Ruth Ludlum. Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, his archaeological research in regions near Jerusalem, like Sharon, finds commerce too great not to be supported by a polity and such regions probably were ruled loosely by Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Faust, Avraham. 2007.

===Archaeology===
====General observations====
The archaeological remains that are considered to date from the time of Solomon are notable for the fact that [[Canaan]]ite material culture appears to have continued unabated; there is a distinct lack of magnificent empire, or cultural development – indeed comparing pottery from areas traditionally assigned to Israel with that of the [[Philistines]] points to the latter having been significantly more sophisticated. However, there is a lack of physical evidence of its existence, despite some archaeological work in the area.&lt;ref name=Finkelstein/&gt; This is not unexpected because the area was devastated by the [[Babylonians]], then rebuilt and destroyed several times.&lt;ref name="Kitchen2003p123"/&gt;

====Temple Mount in Jerusalem====
Little archaeological excavation has been done around the area known as the [[Temple Mount]], in what is thought to be the foundation of Solomon's Temple, because attempts to do so are met with protests by the Muslim authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/temple-mount-excavation.htm |title=Temple Mount: Excavation Controversy |publisher=Sacred destinations |accessdate=2010-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090621060530/http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/temple-mount-excavation.htm |archivedate=2009-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jewishmag.com/42mag/templemount/templemount.htm |author= Jacqueline Schaalje |title= Special: The Temple Mount in Jerusalem |publisher= Jewish Magazine |accessdate= 2018-04-07 |deadurl= bot: unknown |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091006025704/http://www.jewishmag.com/42mag/templemount/templemount.htm |archivedate= 2009-10-06 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Precious metals from Tarshish====
The biblical passages that understand [[Tarshish]] as a source of King Solomon's great wealth in metals – especially silver, but also gold, tin and iron (Ezekiel 27) – were linked to archaeological evidence from silver-hoards found in Phoenicia in 2013. The metals from Tarshish were reportedly obtained by Solomon in partnership with King Hiram of Phoenician Tyre (Isaiah 23), and the fleets of Tarshish-ships that sailed in their service, and the silver-hoards provide the first recognized material evidence that agrees with the ancient texts concerning Solomon's kingdom and his wealth (see 'wealth' below).

Possible evidence for the described wealth of Solomon and his kingdom was discovered in ancient silver-hoards, which were found in Israel and Phoenicia and recognized for their importance in 2003. The evidence from the hoards shows that the Levant was a center of wealth in precious metals during the reign of Solomon and Hiram, and matches the texts that say the trade extended from Asia to the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = King Solomon's Silver?

===Biblical criticism: Solomon's religiosity===
From a critical point of view, Solomon's building of a temple for Yahweh should not be considered an act of particular devotion to Yahweh because Solomon is also described as building places of worship for a number of other deities.&lt;ref name="JewishEncyclopedia"&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:4|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars and historians argue that Solomon's apparent initial devotion to Yahweh, described in passages such as his dedication prayer ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|8:14–66|HE}}), were written much later, after Jerusalem had become the religious centre of the kingdom, replacing locations such as [[Shiloh (Biblical city)|Shiloh]] and [[Bethel]]. Some scholars believe that passages such as these in the [[Books of Kings]] were not written by the same authors who wrote the rest of the text, instead probably by the [[Deuteronomist]].&lt;ref name="Dever 2001 145"/&gt; Such views have been challenged by other historians who maintain that there is evidence that these passages in Kings are derived from official court records at the time of Solomon and from other writings of that time that were incorporated into the canonical books of Kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Harrison |first=RK |year=1969 |title=Introduction to the Old Testament |place=Grand Rapids |publisher=Eerdmans |pages=722–724}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Archer |first=GL |year=1964 |title=A Survey of Old Testament Introduction |place=Chicago |publisher=Moody Press |pages=276–277}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Thiele|1983|p=193–204}}

==Religious views==
===Judaism===
King Solomon sinned by acquiring many foreign wives and horses because he thought he knew the reason for the biblical prohibition and thought it did not apply to him. When King Solomon married the daughter of the Egyptian Pharaoh, a sandbank formed which eventually formed the "great nation of Rome" – the nation that destroyed the Second Temple (Herod's Temple). Solomon gradually lost more and more prestige until he became like a commoner. Some say he regained his status while others say he did not. In the end however, he is regarded as a righteous king and is especially praised for his diligence in building the Temple.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Citation |title=Talmud Bavli |contribution=tractate Sanhendrin |page=21b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seder Olam Rabba]] holds that Solomon's reign was not in 1000 BCE, but rather in the 9th century BCE, during which time he built the First Temple in 832 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Seder Olam Rabba, Jerusalem 1971 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 1906 [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] gives the more common date of "971 to 931 B.C.".&lt;ref name=JE&gt;{{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia |title=Solomon |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13842-solomon |first1=Emil G. |last1=Hirsch |first2=Ira Maurice |last2=Price |first3=Wilhelm |last3=Bacher |first4=M. |last4=Seligsohn |first5=Mary W. |last5=Montgomery |first6=Crawford Howell |last6=toy |authorlink1=Emil G.

===Christianity===
[[File:King-Solomon-Russian-icon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] [[icon]] of King Solomon. He is depicted holding a model of the Temple (18th century, [[iconostasis]] of [[Kizhi]] [[monastery]], [[Russia]]).]]
Christianity has traditionally accepted the historical existence of Solomon, though some modern Christian scholars have also questioned at least his authorship of those biblical texts ascribed to him. Such disputes tend to divide Christians into traditionalist and modernist camps.

Of the two [[Genealogy of Jesus|genealogies of Jesus]] given in the [[Gospel]]s, [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] mentions Solomon, but [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] does not. Some commentators see this as an issue that can be reconciled while others disagree. For instance, it has been suggested that Luke is using Joseph's genealogy and Matthew is using Mary's, but [[Darrell Bock]] states that this would be unprecedented, "especially when no other single woman appears in the line". Other suggestions include the use by one of the royal and the other of the natural line, one using the legal line and the other the physical line, or that Joseph was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bock |first=Darell|title=Luke |series=The NIV Application Commentary |year=1996|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=978-0-310-49330-3|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus makes reference to Solomon, using him for comparison purposes in his admonition against worrying about your life. This account is recorded in Matthew 6:29 and the parallel passage in Luke 12:27

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], Solomon is commemorated as a [[saint]], with the title of "Righteous Prophet and King". His [[feast day]] is celebrated on the Sunday of the Holy Forefathers (two Sundays before the [[Great Feast]] of the [[Christmas|Nativity of the Lord]]).

The staunchly Catholic King [[Philip II of Spain]] sought to model himself after King Solomon. Statues of [[King David]] and Solomon stand on either side of the entrance to the [[basilica]] of [[El Escorial]], Philip's palace, and Solomon is also depicted in a great fresco at the center of El Escorial's library. Philip identified the warrior-king David with his own father [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], and himself sought to emulate the thoughtful and logical character which he perceived in Solomon. Moreover, the structure of the Escorial was inspired by that of Solomon's Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=René |last=Taylor |language=Spanish|title=Arquitectura y Magia.

{{Main article|Solomon in Islam}}

In [[Islam]]ic tradition, Solomon is venerated as a Prophet and a Messenger of [[God]], as well as a divinely appointed monarch, who ruled over the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]].&lt;ref name="Cite quran|2|102|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran |2 |102 |s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in [[Judaism]], Islam recognizes Solomon as the son of [[King David]], who is also considered a Prophet and a King but, refuses the claim that Solomon turned to idolatry. One of the enslaved [[Jinn]] escaped his enslavement, instead, and took over his kingdom and posed as Solomon, while others thought indeed he became a ruthless king.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lebling ''Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar'' I.B.Tauris 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-857-73063-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''One Thousand and One Nights''===
A well-known story in the collection ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' describes a [[genie]] who had displeased King Solomon and was punished by being locked in a bottle and thrown into the sea. Since the bottle was sealed with Solomon's seal, the genie was helpless to free himself, until freed many centuries later by a fisherman who discovered the bottle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/16/201.html "The Story of the Fisherman", ''Stories from the Thousand and One Nights'', The Harvard Classics, 1909–14]&lt;/ref&gt; In other stories from the ''One Thousand and One Nights'', protagonists who had to leave their homeland and travel to the unknown places of the world saw signs which proved that Solomon had already been there. Sometimes, protagonists discovered words of Solomon that were intended to help those who were lost and had unluckily reached those forbidden and deserted places.

===Angels and magic===
According to the [[Rabbinical literature]], on account of his modest request for wisdom only, Solomon was rewarded with riches and an unprecedented glorious realm, which extended over the upper world inhabited by the angels and over the whole of the terrestrial globe with all its inhabitants, including all the beasts, fowl, and reptiles, as well as the demons and spirits. His control over the demons, spirits, and animals augmented his splendor, the demons bringing him precious stones, besides water from distant countries to irrigate his exotic plants. The beasts and fowl of their own accord entered the kitchen of Solomon's palace, so that they might be used as food for him, and extravagant meals for him were prepared daily by each of his 700 wives and 300 concubines, with the thought that perhaps the king would feast that day in her house.

====Seal of Solomon====
A [[magic ring]] called the "[[Seal of Solomon]]" was supposedly given to Solomon and gave him power over demons or [[Jinn]]. The magical symbol said to have been on the Seal of Solomon which made it efficacious is often considered to be the ''[[Star of David]]''{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} though this emblem (also known as the Shield of David) is known to have been associated with Judaism only as recently as the 11th century CE while the five pointed star (pentagram) can be found on jars and other artifacts from Jerusalem dating back to at least the 2nd and 4th centuries BCE and is more likely to have been the emblem found on the ring purportedly used by King Solomon to control the Jinn or demons. [[Asmodai|Asmodeus]], king of demons, was one day, according to the classical Rabbis, captured by [[Benaiah]] using the ring, and was forced to remain in Solomon's service. In one tale, Asmodeus brought a man with two heads from under the earth to show Solomon; the man, unable to return, married a woman from Jerusalem and had seven sons, six of whom resembled the mother, while one resembled the father in having two heads. After their father's death, the son with two heads claimed two shares of the inheritance, arguing that he was two men; Solomon decided that the son with two heads was only one man. The Seal of Solomon, in some legends known as the Ring of Aandaleeb, was a highly sought after symbol of power. In several legends, different groups or individuals attempted to steal it or attain it in some manner.

====Solomon and Asmodeus====
One legend concerning [[Asmodeus]] (see: [[s:Translation:The Story of King Solomon and Ashmedai|The Story of King Solomon and Ashmedai]]) goes on to state that Solomon one day asked Asmodeus what could make demons powerful over man, and Asmodeus asked to be freed and given the ring so that he could demonstrate; Solomon agreed but Asmodeus threw the ring into the sea and it was swallowed by a fish. Asmodeus then swallowed the king, stood up fully with one wing touching heaven and the other earth, and spat out Solomon to a distance of 400 miles. The Rabbis claim this was a divine punishment for Solomon's having failed to follow three divine commands, and Solomon was forced to wander from city to city, until he eventually arrived in an Ammonite city where he was forced to work in the king's kitchens. Solomon gained a chance to prepare a meal for the Ammonite king, which the king found so impressive that the previous cook was sacked and Solomon put in his place; the king's daughter, [[Naamah (wife of Solomon)|Naamah]], subsequently fell in love with Solomon, but the family (thinking Solomon a commoner) disapproved, so the king decided to kill them both by sending them into the desert. Solomon and the king's daughter wandered the desert until they reached a coastal city, where they bought a fish to eat, which just happened to be the one which had swallowed the magic ring. Solomon was then able to regain his throne and expel Asmodeus. The element of a ring thrown into the sea and found back in a fish's belly also appeared in [[Herodotus]]' account of [[Polycrates]], the [[tyrant]] of [[Samos]] from c. 538&amp;nbsp;BCE to 522&amp;nbsp;BCE.

In another familiar version of the legend of the Seal of Solomon, Asmodeus disguises himself. In some myths, he's disguised as King Solomon himself, while in more frequently heard versions he's disguised as a falcon, calling himself Gavyn (Gavinn or Gavin), one of King Solomon's trusted friends. The concealed Asmodeus tells travelers who have ventured up to King Solomon's grand lofty palace that the Seal of Solomon was thrown into the sea. He then convinces them to plunge in and attempt to retrieve it, for if they do they would take the throne as king.

====Artifacts====
Other magical items attributed to Solomon are [[key of Solomon|his key]] and his Table. The latter was said to be held in [[Toledo, Spain]] during [[Visigoth]] rule and was part of the loot taken by [[Tarik ibn Ziyad]] during the [[Umayyad Conquest of Iberia]], according to [[Ibn Abd-el-Hakem]]'s ''History of the Conquest of Spain''. The former appears in the title of the [[Lesser Key of Solomon]], a [[grimoire]] whose [[Frame story|framing story]] is Solomon capturing demons using his ring, and forcing them to explain themselves to him. In ''The Book of Deadly Names'', purportedly translated from Arabic manuscripts found hidden in a building in Spain, the "King of the Jinn" Fiqitush brings 72 Jinn before King Solomon to confess their corruptions and places of residence. Fiqitush tells King Solomon the recipes for curing such corruptions as each evil Jinn confesses.

====Angels====
Angels also helped Solomon in building the Temple; though not by choice. The edifice was, according to rabbinical legend, miraculously constructed throughout, the large heavy stones rising and settling in their respective places of themselves. The general opinion of the Rabbis is that Solomon hewed the stones by means of a ''[[Solomon's Shamir|shamir]]'', a mythical worm whose mere touch cleft rocks. According to [[Midrash Tehillim]], the shamir was brought from paradise by Solomon's eagle; but most of the rabbis state that Solomon was informed of the worm's haunts by Asmodeus. The shamir had been entrusted by the prince of the sea to the mountain rooster alone, and the rooster had sworn to guard it well, but Solomon's men found the bird's nest, and covered it with glass. When the bird returned, it used the shamir to break the glass, whereupon the men scared the bird, causing it to drop the worm, which the men could then bring to Solomon.

====In the Kabbalah====
Early adherents of the [[Kabbalah]] portray Solomon as having sailed through the air on a throne of light placed on an eagle, which brought him near the heavenly gates as well as to the dark mountains behind which the fallen angels ''Uzza'' and ''Azzazel'' were chained; the eagle would rest on the chains, and Solomon, using the magic ring, would compel the two angels to reveal every mystery he desired to know.

====The palace without entrance====
According to one legend, while traveling magically, Solomon noticed a magnificent palace to which there appeared to be no entrance. He ordered the demons to climb to the roof and see if they could discover any living being within the building but they found only an eagle, which said that it was 700 years old, but that it had never seen an entrance. An elder brother of the eagle, 900 years old, was then found, but it also did not know the entrance. The eldest brother of these two birds, which was 1,300 years old, then declared it had been informed by its father that the door was on the west side, but that it had become hidden by sand drifted by the wind. Having discovered the entrance, Solomon found an idol inside that had in its mouth a silver tablet saying in Greek (a language not thought by modern scholars to have existed 1000 years before the time of Solomon) that the statue was of ''Shaddad, the son of 'Ad'', and that it had ''reigned over a million cities, rode on a million horses, had under it a million vassals and slew a million warriors'', yet it could not resist the [[death (personification)|angel of death]].&lt;ref name=JE /&gt;

===Throne===
[[File:Wurzach Pfarrkirche Decke Westteil.jpg|thumb|''Solomon at his throne'', painting by Andreas Brugger, 1777]]
Solomon's throne is described at length in [[Targum Sheni]], which is compiled from three different sources, and in two later [[Midrash]]. According to these, there were on the steps of the throne twelve golden lions, each facing a golden eagle. There were six steps to the throne, on which animals, all of gold, were arranged in the following order: on the first step a lion opposite an ox; on the second, a wolf opposite a sheep; on the third, a tiger opposite a camel; on the fourth, an eagle opposite a peacock, on the fifth, a cat opposite a cock; on the sixth, a sparrow-hawk opposite a dove. On the top of the throne was a dove holding a sparrow-hawk in its claws, symbolizing the dominion of Israel over the Gentiles. The first midrash claims that six steps were constructed because Solomon foresaw that six kings would sit on the throne, namely, Solomon, [[Rehoboam]], [[Hezekiah]], [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]], [[Amon of Judah|Amon]], and [[Josiah]]. There was also on the top of the throne a golden [[candelabrum]], on the seven branches of the one side of which were engraved the names of the seven patriarchs Adam, Noah, Shem, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Job, and on the seven of the other the names of Levi, Kohath, Amram, Moses, Aaron, Eldad, Medad, and, in addition, Hur (another version has Haggai). Above the candelabrum was a golden jar filled with olive-oil and beneath it a golden basin which supplied the jar with oil and on which the names of Nadab, Abihu, and Eli and his two sons were engraved. Over the throne, twenty-four vines were fixed to cast a shadow on the king's head.&lt;ref name=JE /&gt;

By a mechanical contrivance the throne followed Solomon wherever he wished to go. Supposedly, due to another mechanical trick, when the king reached the first step, the ox stretched forth its leg, on which Solomon leaned, a similar action taking place in the case of the animals on each of the six steps. From the sixth step the eagles raised the king and placed him in his seat, near which a golden serpent lay coiled. When the king was seated the large eagle placed the crown on his head, the serpent uncoiled itself, and the lions and eagles moved upward to form a shade over him. The dove then descended, took the scroll of the Law from the Ark, and placed it on Solomon's knees. When the king sat, surrounded by the [[Sanhedrin]], to judge the people, the wheels began to turn, and the beasts and fowls began to utter their respective cries, which frightened those who had intended to bear false testimony. Moreover, while Solomon was ascending the throne, the lions scattered all kinds of fragrant spices. After Solomon's death, Pharaoh [[Shishak]], when taking away the treasures of the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple]] (I Kings xiv. 26), carried off the throne, which remained in Egypt until [[Sennacherib]] conquered that country. After Sennacherib's fall Hezekiah gained possession of it, but when Josiah was slain by Pharaoh [[Necho II|Necho]], the latter took it away. However, according to [[rabbinical]] accounts, Necho did not know how the mechanism worked and so accidentally struck himself with one of the lions causing him to become lame; Nebuchadnezzar, into whose possession the throne subsequently came, shared a similar fate. The throne then passed to the Persians, whose king [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] was the first to sit successfully on Solomon's throne after his death; subsequently the throne came into the possession of the Greeks and [[Ahasuerus]].&lt;ref name=JE /&gt;

===Literature===
* In [[H. Rider Haggard]]'s ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'' the protagonists discover multiple settings said to belong to, or having been built at the request of King Solomon, such as 'Solomon's Great Road' and the mines themselves. Also, the two mountains which form the entrance to Kukuana Land (where the mines are located in the novel) are referred to as 'Sheba's Breasts' which could well be an allusion to the Queen of Sheba, with whom King Solomon had a relationship; or alternatively Solomon's mother, who was named Bathsheba. When in the mines the characters also contemplate what must have occurred to prevent King Solomon from ever returning to retrieve the massive amounts of diamonds, gold and ivory tusks that were found buried in his great 'Treasure Chamber'.
* In ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' the spirit of Solomon appears to [[Dante Alighieri]] in the Heaven of the Sun with other exemplars of inspired wisdom.
* In [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]]'s ''[[Die Physiker]]'', the physicist Möbius claims that Solomon appears to him and dictates the "theory of all possible inventions" (based on ''[[Unified Field Theory]]'').
* Solomon appears in Kipling's ''[[Just So Stories]]''.
* In [[Neal Stephenson]]'s three-volume ''[[The Baroque Cycle]]'', 17th-century alchemists like [[Isaac Newton]] believe that Solomon created a kind of "heavier" gold with mystical properties and that it was cached in the [[Solomon Islands]] where it was accidentally discovered by the crew of a wayward Spanish galleon. In the third volume of ''The Baroque Cycle, The System of the World'', a mysterious member of the entourage of Czar [[Peter I of Russia]], named "Solomon [[Kohen|Kohan]]" appears in early 18th-century London. The czar, traveling incognito to purchase English-made ships for [[Imperial Russian Navy#Russian Navy during the reign of Peter the Great|his navy]], explains that he added him to his court after the [[Azov campaigns#The second Azov campaign|Sack of Azov]], where Kohan had been a guest of the [[Pasha]]. Solomon Kohan is later revealed as one of the extremely long-lived "Wise" [[Enoch Root]], and compares a courtyard full of inventors' workstations to "an operation I used to have in Jerusalem a long time ago," denominating either facility as "a temple."
* In ''[[The Ring of Solomon|Bartimaeus: The Ring of Solomon]]'', both King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba are featured prominently.
* Solomon, King of Urushalim, is a significant character in ''[[The Shadow Prince]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-1533673503}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first novel of [[Philip Armstrong]]'s epic [[historical fantasy]], ''[[The Chronicles of Tupiluliuma]]''. His Ring is an Atalantaën Relic, by which is he able to command daemons. He uses it to summon a daemon army, thereafter called the Cohort of Free Daemons, to oppose the forces of the Chaos God, [[Sutekh]], thus allowing the young Hittite musician, Lisarwa, to repair the Veil that separates the physical world from the dangerous wild energies of the Netherworld, using another of the relics, the Harp of Daud, once owned by his father (King David). Solomon's son, [[Rehoboam]] also appears in a minor capacity.
* In the Japanese manga series ''[[Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic]]'', Solomon was a powerful magician which united all of the world under his peaceful rule. However, when this world was destroyed by a calamity, he created the world ''Magi'' is set in and saved mankind by sending them there. A special power originated from him, the "Wisdom of Solomon", allows the main character Aladdin to talk directly with the soul of a person, alive or dead.
* In ''[[Makai Ouji: Devils and Realist]]'', Solomon is a friend of Lucifer and is the "Elector" – the one who can choose the interim ruler over Hell as its emperor rests to regain his strength and had powers over demons known as his seventy-two pillars. He's also known who can control Hell or Heaven with the power of his ring.
* Chapter 14 of ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' ends with Huck and Jim debating over how wise Solomon really was.
* In Francis Bacon's Essay 'Of Revenge', Solomon is paraphrased: "And Solomon, I am sure, saith, It is the glory of a man, to pass by an offence."
* In a subject called in art the ''Idolatry of Solomon'', the foreign wives are depicted as leading Solomon away from [[Yahweh]] toward idolatry because they worshiped gods other than Yahweh ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:1–3|HE}}). This forms part of the [[Power of Women]] topos in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, showing the dangers women posed to even the most virtuous men.&lt;ref&gt;H Diane Russell (ed), ''Eva/Ave; Women in Renaissance and Baroque Prints'', pp. 162–164, National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1990, {{ISBN|1558610391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tennin (Japanese angel).jpg|thumb|right|A depiction of a Tennin.]]
'''''Tennin''''' (天人), which may include '''''tenshi''''' (天使), '''''ten no tsukai''''' (天の使い, lit. ''heavenly messenger''), '''''hiten''''' (飛天, lit. ''flying heaven'') and the specifically female '''''tennyo''''' (天女) are [[spiritual being]]s found in [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhism]] that are similar to western [[angel]]s, [[nymph]]s or [[fairy|fairies]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} They were seemingly imported from [[Chinese Buddhism]],&lt;ref name="b"&gt;[http://www.mukashibanashi.org/overview.html An Overview of Japanese Folklore] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712125650/http://mukashibanashi.org/overview.html |date=2009-07-12 }} at the [http://www.mukashibanashi.org/ Mukashibanashi Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213125021/http://www.mukashibanashi.org/ |date=2006-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was itself influenced by the concepts of heavenly beings found in [[History of Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhism]] and Chinese [[Taoism]]. 

==History==
''Tennin'' are mentioned in Buddhist [[sutra]]s{{fact|date=January 2012}}, and these descriptions form the basis for depictions of the beings in [[Japanese art]], [[Japanese sculpture|sculpture]], and [[Japanese theater|theater]]. They are usually pictured as unnaturally beautiful women dressed in ornate, colorful [[kimono]]s (traditionally in five colors), exquisite [[jewelry]], and flowing scarves that wrap loosely around their bodies. They usually carry [[Sacred lotus|lotus]] blossoms as a symbol of [[bodhi|enlightenment]] or play musical instruments such as the [[biwa]], or [[flute]].&lt;ref name = "c"&gt;[http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/karyoubinga.html#tennin Tennin] at [http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/buddhism.shtml GODS of Japan, A-to-Z Photo Dictionary of Japanese Buddhism (Buddhist &amp; Shinto Deities)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, Lafcadio, [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/8glm110.txt ''Glimpses of an Unfamiliar Japan''] at [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/8130 Project Gutenberg] online book catalog&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
''Tennin'' are believed to live in the [[Buddhist cosmology|Buddhist heaven]] as the companions to the [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] and [[Bodhisattva]]s. Some legends{{fact|date=January 2012}} also make certain ''tennin'' solitary creatures living on mountain peaks. Pilgrims sometimes climb these mountains in order to meet the holy spirits.

==Powers==
''Tennin'' can [[flight|fly]], a fact generally indicated in art by their colored or feathered kimonos, called ''hagoromo'' (羽衣, lit. ''feather dress'').&lt;ref name="b"&gt;[http://www.mukashibanashi.org/overview.html An Overview of Japanese Folklore] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712125650/http://mukashibanashi.org/overview.html |date=2009-07-12 }} at the [http://www.mukashibanashi.org/ Mukashibanashi Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213125021/http://www.mukashibanashi.org/ |date=2006-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some legends, ''tennin'' are unable to fly without these kimonos (and thus cannot return to heaven).&lt;ref name = "Noh"&gt;Waley, Arthur (1921), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/shi/npj/npj30.htm ''The Noh Plays of Japan'', Chapter V], p. 177, "A Note on Hagoromo"&lt;/ref&gt; More rarely, they are shown with feathered wings.&lt;ref name = "c"&gt;[http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/karyoubinga.html#tennin Tennin] at [http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/buddhism.shtml GODS of Japan, A-to-Z Photo Dictionary of Japanese Buddhism (Buddhist &amp; Shinto Deities)]&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Noh]] play ''[[Hagoromo (play)|Hagoromo]]'', which bears a number of similarities to the [[Western culture|Western]] [[swan maiden]] legends,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/places/the_burren/connor_oquin.htm The Legend of Connor O'Quin and the Swan Maiden] at [http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/places/the_burren/burren_folklore.htm Folklore of the Burren]&lt;/ref&gt; ''tennyo'' come to the earth and take off their ''hagoromo''. A fisherman spies them and hides their clothes in order to force one to marry him. After some years he tells his wife what he did, and she finds her clothes and returns to heaven.&lt;ref name="Noh" /&gt; The legend says it occurred on the beach of [[Miho no Matsubara]], now a part of the city of [[Shizuoka, Shizuoka|Shizuoka]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3083">The '''three-self formula''' or '''three-self principle''' is a [[Christian missions|missiological]] strategy to establish [[Indigenous church mission theory|indigenous churches]]. It was first coined in the late-19th century by various missions theorists, and is still used today in certain contexts such as in the [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]] in mainland China.

== History ==
&lt;section begin=early-history /&gt;
The three principles of self-governance, self-support (i.e., financial independence from foreigners), and self-propagation (i.e., indigenous missionary work) were first articulated by [[Henry Venn (Church Missionary Society)|Henry Venn]], General Secretary of the [[Church Missionary Society]] from 1841 to 1873, and [[Rufus Anderson]], foreign secretary of the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Christianity Today Library | url = http://ctlibrary.com/41452 | contribution = Marking Time in the Middle Kingdom | first = Madison | last = Trammel | accessdate = May 1, 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Henry | last = Venn | editor-last = Warren | editor-first = M | title = To Apply the Gospel: Selections from the Writings of… | place = Grand Rapids | publisher = Eerdmans | year = 1971}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The principles were drafted formally during an 1892 conference in [[Shanghai]] of Christian missions reflecting an almost unilateral agreement that the future of the Chinese church depended on the indigenization of the leadership, and the finding of sufficiently Chinese modes of [[worship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Grant | first = Paul | url = http://www.strategicnetwork.org/index.php?loc=kb&amp;view=v&amp;id=8345&amp;printerfriendly=Y&amp;lang= | title = The Three Self Church | publisher = NSM | date = January 1, 2007 | accessdate = May 1, 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dixon Edward Hoste]], head of the [[China Inland Mission]], was known for putting the same principles into practice in the effort of assisting the Chinese to establish their own indigenous churches during the early 20th Century.&lt;section end=early-history /&gt; 

The [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]] in mainland China, now the officially sanctioned form of Protestant [[Christianity in China]], adopted these principles as foundational for its establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Christianity Reborn: The Global Expansion of Evangelicalism in the Twentieth Century|first=Donald M.|last=Lewis|publisher=William B. Eerdmans|year=2004|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission historian [[David Bosch]] has argued that there needs to now be a fourth "self," self-theologizing.&lt;ref name="Bosch1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bosch|first=David J. |title=Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qEpf6wqHcGwC|year=1991|publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|isbn=978-1-60833-146-8|page=462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tinku''', a [[Bolivia|Bolivian]] [[Aymara people|Aymara]] tradition, began as a form of ritualistic combat. In the [[Aymara language]], it means “meeting-encounter.”&lt;ref name=lossambos&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lossambos.com/dances/PDFs/Tinku-English.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713232541/http://www.lossambos.com/dances/PDFs/Tinku-English.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this ritual, men and women from different communities will meet and begin the festivities by dancing. The women will then form circles and begin chanting while the men proceed to fight each other; rarely the women will join in the fighting as well. Large tinkus are held in [[Potosí]] during the first few weeks of May.

The story behind this cultural dance is that long ago, the Spanish conquistadors made the indigenous people their slaves. Tinku dance costumes are colorful and decorative. Women wear a dress, [[Abarca (shoe)|abarcas]], and a hat and men wear an undershirt, pants, jacket, sandals (abarcas), and hard helmet like hats. Even though the people were slaves, they loved to dance, and would often fight, but never really hurting each other.

Because of the rhythmic way the men throw their fists at each other, and because they stand in a crouched stance going in circles around each other, a dance was formed. This dance, the Festive Tinku, simulates the traditional combat, bearing a warlike rhythm.&lt;ref name=lossambos /&gt; The differences between the Andean tradition and the dance are the costumes, the role of women, and the fact that the dancers do not actually fight each other. The Festive Tinku has become a cultural dance for all of Bolivia, although it originated in Potosí.

==Tinku combat==

===History===

The Bolivian tradition began with the indigenous belief in [[Pachamama]], or Mother Nature. The combat is in praise of Pachamama, and any blood shed throughout the fighting is considered a sacrifice, in hopes of a fruitful harvest and fertility. Because of the violent nature of the tradition there have been fatalities, but each death is considered a sacrifice which brings forth life, and a donation to the land that fertilizes it.&lt;ref name=org&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tinku.org/content/view/2037/94/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119045056/http://www.tinku.org/content/view/2037/94/ |archivedate=2009-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The brawls are also considered a means of release of frustration and anger between the separate communities. Tinkus usually last two to three days.&lt;ref name=nystrom /&gt; During this time, participants will stop every now and then to eat, sleep, or drink.

===Methods of combat===

During the brawl itself, men will often carry rocks in their hands to have greater force in their punches, or they will just throw them at opponents. Sometimes, especially in the town of [[Santiago de Macha|Macha]] in [[Potosí]], where the brawl gets the most violent, men will wrap strips of cloth with shards of glass stuck to them around their fists to cause greater damage. Slingshots and whips are also used, though not as much as hand-to-hand combat.&lt;ref name=org /&gt; The last day of the fight is considered the most violent and police almost always have to separate the mass of bloody men and women.

===Attire===

Men attend tinkus wearing traditional monteras, or thick helmet-like hats made of thick leather, resembling helmets from the [[Conquistador]]s. These helmets are often painted and decorated with feathers.&lt;ref name=nystrom&gt;Bolivia by Andrew Dean Nystrom and Morgan Konn pg. 233&lt;/ref&gt; Their pants are usually simple black or white with traditional embroidering near their feet. Often the men wear wide thick belts tied around their waist and stomach for more protection.&lt;ref name=lossambos /&gt;

==Festive Tinku dance==
The Festive Tinku, a much more pleasant experience than a ceremonial tinku, has many differences. It has been accepted as a cultural dance in the whole nation of Bolivia. Tinku music has a loud constant drum beat to give it a native warlike feel, while [[charango]]s, guitars, and [[zampoña]]s (panpipes) play melodies.&lt;ref name=org /&gt; The dancers perform with combat like movements, following the heavy beat of the drum.

===Costumes===

For men, the costumes are more colorful. Their monteras are usually decorated with long colorful feathers. Tinku Suits, or the outfits men wear during Festive Tinku performances, are usually made with bold colors to symbolize power and strength, instead of the neutral colors worn in ceremonial tinkus that help participants blend in. Women wear long embroidered skirts and colorful tops. Their costumes are completed by extravagant hats, painted and decorated with various long and colorful feathers and ribbons. Men and women wear walking sandals so they can move and jump easily.&lt;ref name=lossambos /&gt;

===Dance===

The dance is performed in a crouching stance, bending at the waist. Arms are thrown out and there are various kicks, while the performers move in circles following the beat of the drum. Every jump from one foot to the next is followed by a hard stomp and a thrown fist to signify the violence from the ceremonial tinku. Many times the dancers will hold basic and traditional instruments in their hands that they will use as they stomp, just to add more noise for a greater effect.

'''Toltecayotl''' is a [[Nahuatl]] word derived from "[[Toltec|tōltēcātl]]" which as used by the Nahuas to refer to the members of the Toltec civilization that preceded them in the basin of Mexico, as well as a generalized meaning of "artisan".

== Modern use ==
The introduction and dissemination of that title in the academic world is due to [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Miguel León Portilla]] who, in 1980, published a book titled ''Tōltēcayōtl, aspects of the Nahuatl culture''.

León Portilla's interpretation of the concept of Toltecayotl is based on a set of principles that were collected in the ''[[Huehuetlatolli|Huēhuehtlahtōlli]]''&lt;ref&gt;Must point out that the "Huehuetlahtolli" is a series of texts collected from Nahua informers by Spanish missionaries: by the 16th century, the archaeological Toltec had disappeared.&lt;/ref&gt; or 'book of the ancient words', which includes traditional parliaments preserved by oral tradition and other documents. The main are the following:

{{quote|Be very careful to seek friendship from He who is everywhere and is invisible and impalpable. Be at peace with all; under no circumstances humiliate another person.
Do not waste the time which has been granted to us in this world, neither day nor night, because time is very necessary.| [[Bernardino de Sahagún]], ''Suma Indiana''{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}}}

{{quote|This way you shall become Toltec: If you acquire habit and custom to consult everything with your own heart.|[[Andres de Olmos]], ''Huēhuehtlahtōlli''{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}}}

== Criticism of the use of the term ==
''Toltequity'' is also the generic name given to the [[Toltec|tōltēca]] knowledge, or knowledge left by the ancient inhabitants of [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tollan-Xicocotitlan]] Tula ("Tollan-Xicocotitlan") (Hidalgo, Mexico). Not used in University environments, nor in archaeological analysis (see "''Tōltēcayōtl, aspects of the Nahuatl culture''" from [[Miguel León-Portilla]], anthropologist and Mexican historian and leading authority in the field of thought and literature Nahuatl. Since 1988 he is emeritus researcher at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]].)

The historical validity of toltequity as such tends to be controversial, historians do not even agree in the Toltec city which is known as such, Tula is usually considered (the settlement known as the "Chico") as the base around year 550, and is closely related to the Quetzalcoatl history, while there are four origins, all agree in that he was a King, son of Mixcōātl and Chimalma, and who later was worshipped as God, and later would become one of the main gods in the Anahuac. While the Toltec gave rise to the founding of a legendary city called Tula or Tōllan ("Tōl-+-tlan" = Capital, the name of the Toltec city itself was "Xicocotitlan").

== The Toltec sources ==
Toltec was a generic name applied to all Mesoamerica inhabitants of. Derived from the root ''tol-'', which meant originally 'stem, Reed', which gave birth to the name of the city of Tula or "Tollan" ('(place with abundant) reeds') and due to the cultural tradition of the Toltec City (originally ' inhabitant of Tula') came to acquire the sense of 'educated person'. Toltec ideas received the name of tōltēcayōtl 'toltequity' and were made up of religious, artistic and scientific formulas that reflected the Mesoamerican cosmovision.

The definition of the Toltecs as a historical or ethnic group is a fact established by researchers in a round table in 1941. Currently, [[new age]] groups claim very disparate things to justify the native use of the term Toltec:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;poem&gt;&lt;small&gt;Toltecatl, mechanical arts craftsman. Toltecauia, making something for the teacher. Tōltēcayōtl, art of living".
{{Right| ''Nahuatl-Castilian vocabulary, Padre Molina, 1571}} &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/poem &gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;poem&gt;&lt;small&gt;You shall be called the Toltec for having created ad formed us, oh Feathered Serpent”
{{Right|''Popol Vuh I.1''}}  &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/poem &gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;poem&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Toltec is wise, is a fire, a torch, a thick torch that does not smoke. Makes wise others faces, makes them take a heart. Does not go above things: stops, reflects, observes.
{{Right|''Codex Matritense''}}   &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/poem &gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;poem&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Toltec is a mirror bored on both sides. His is the ink, the codices; He himself is writing and wisdom, path, accurate guide for others;  leads people and things, and is an authority on human affairs
{{Right|''Codex Matritense'' }}  &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/poem &gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;poem&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Toltec is careful; respects tradition, possesses the knowledge transmission and he teaches others, follows the truth. Makes us take a face and develop it, opens our ears, and enlightens us. He is teacher of teachers
{{Right|''Codex Matritense'' }}  &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/poem &gt;&lt;/center&gt;



Currently, the term "Toltec" is used by various [[New Age]] groups and by neo-nagualism practitioners. On the other hand, groups who claim to rescue the national identity roots assert without proof, having recuperated the original use of the name, applying it to anyone who follows the Toltec life principles; these are not validated by the Popper's [[falsifiability]] principle

== Neo-Shamanism ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
The idea of neo-shamanism groups, derived from the author [[Carlos Castaneda]], is summarized in that a lifestyle can be lived with respect for elders, to obtain knowledge and preserve it without harming others.

From the neo-shamanism movement point of view, Ken Eagle mentions in his book similar topics as Carlos Castaneda, with the exception that makes connection with elements of the army of United States (Rangers) rather than the term originally used by Castaneda, Stalkers. In the book the Toltec path also recounts situations that appear to be alien channels, which removes historical seriousness from the term.

Carlos Castaneda refers generically to the Toltec as "secret conservators" in his book ''The Second Ring of Power'', and in recent years a movement has been created divided into two parts, on the one hand the books by Don Miguel Ruiz, that shows a series of ideas or moral principles, and on the other hand a series of courses New Age type, that advertises on the handling of a return to the roots.

The '''Way of the Celestial Masters''' is a Chinese [[Daoist]] movement that was founded by [[Zhang Daoling]] in 142 CE.&lt;ref name="Woolf2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Woolf|title=Ancient civilizations: the illustrated guide to belief, mythology, and art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=94NuSg3tlsgC&amp;dq=ancient+civilizations+the+illustrated+guide+mythology&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Zhang+Daoling|year=2007|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0121-0|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its height, the movement controlled a [[theocratic state]] in what is now [[Sichuan]].

===Way of the Five Pecks of Rice===
{{Main|Way of the Five Pecks of Rice}}
{{Taoism}}
In 142 CE Zhang Daoling announced that [[Laozi]] had appeared to him and commanded him to rid the world of decadence and establish a new state consisting only of the ‘chosen people.’ Zhang became the first Celestial Master, and began to spread his newly founded movement throughout the province of Sichuan. The movement was initially called the "Way of the Five Pecks of Rice", because each person wishing to join was required to donate five [[peck]]s of rice.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrischke (2000), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement spread rapidly, particularly under his son {{Interlanguage link multi|Zhang Heng (Taoist)|zh|3=张衡 (道教)|lt=Zhang Heng}} and grandson [[Zhang Lu (Three Kingdoms)|Zhang Lu]].&lt;ref name=Hend140&gt;Hendrischke (2000), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Their rebellion against the [[Han dynasty]] is known as the Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion. After the success of the rebellion in 184, they founded the theocratic state of Zhang Han in the Hanzhong Valley of Sichuan, enjoying full independence.&lt;ref name="Hend140"/&gt;

In 215, Zhang Lu submitted to [[Cao Cao]], the ruler of the Wei Kingdom, surrendering his state in exchange for gaining state religion status for Tianshi Daoism. Zhang was given a title and land, as were several other family members and generals.  His daughter was married to Cao Cao’s son, [[Cao Yu (playwright)|Cao Yu]].  His followers were forced to resettle in other parts of China, with one group being sent to the [[Chang'an]] area, and another being sent to [[Luoyang]]. Zhang relocated to the Han court until the Han Dynasty changed to the [[Cao Wei|Wei]]. He then used his own popularity as a religious leader to lend legitimacy to the Wei, proclaiming that the Wei court had inherited divine authority from the Tao church, as well as from Confucian laws.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

The collapse of the Wei Kingdom in 260 CE, along with the fall of Northern China to the Huns in 317, further scattered adherents to the Celestial Master.&lt;ref&gt;Bokenkamp (1997), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The Celestial Masters later reemerged in the 4th and 5th centuries as two distinct offshoots, the Northern and Southern Celestial Masters.

Celestial Masters had prophecy rituals banned since what happens in the future it was supposed to be just known already by the member without rituals.&lt;ref name="LagerweyLü2009 47"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Lagerwey|author2=Pengzhi Lü|title=Early Chinese Religion: The Period of Division (220-589 Ad)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q2nWdWbN3MQC&amp;pg=PA370#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=30 October 2009|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-17585-7|pages=370–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the water, earth, and heaven officials, Celestial Masters wrote the 三官手書 sanguan shoushu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Chinese Religion I (2 vol.set): Song-Liao-Jin-Yuan (960-1368 AD)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2DiBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA986#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=8 December 2014|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-27164-7|pages=986–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Southern Celestial Masters===
After the fall of [[Luoyang]] to non-Chinese invaders in 311, the remnants of the court fled to Jiankang (modern-day [[Nanjing]]) and established a new state known as the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Eastern Jin]] dynasty. Among the court members who fled were members of the Celestial Masters. There is also evidence that after Zhang Lu’s submission to Cao Cao, numerous adherents fled south from Sichuan. These various followers of The Way of the Celestial Master coalesced to form a distinct form of Celestial Master Daoism known as the Southern Celestial Masters. The Southern Celestial Masters lasted as a distinct movement into the fifth century.

===The Northern Celestial Masters===
{{Main|The Northern Celestial Masters}}
[[Kou Qianzhi]], who was raised in a Celestial Master family, received two visions of Laozi in 415 and in 423. In 424, he brought the work that resulted from these visions to the court of the [[Northern Wei]] dynasty. The rulers put his works into practice, and Kou became the Celestial Master of the Daoist theocracy of the Northern Wei. After Kou died in 448, the prime minister, [[Cui Hao]], became power hungry and began to insult the Wei rulers. Unhappy with his insubordination, the rulers had Cui executed in 450, and ended the Daoist theocracy.

===The Celestial Masters today===
{{Main|Zhengyi Dao}}
During the Yuan Dynasty, the [[Zhengyi Dao]] School of Daoism claimed lineage to the Celestial Masters.  They became one of the two leading schools of Daoism in China, along with [[Quanzhen School|Quanzhen Dao]].  Zhengyi Daoists became common in the [[Jiangxi]], [[Jiangsu]], and [[Fujian]] provinces of China, as well as in [[Taiwan]].

Zhang Yucai, the Celestial Master (38th) draw a handscroll of a dragon. Zhang Sicheng was the 39th and succeeded him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Chinese Religion I (2 vol.set): Song-Liao-Jin-Yuan (960-1368 AD)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2DiBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1035#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=8 December 2014|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-27164-7|pages=1035–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celestial Master teachings and Daoxue were mixed together by Yu Ji, whose teacher was 吳澄 Wu Cheng.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Chinese Religion I (2 vol.set): Song-Liao-Jin-Yuan (960-1368 AD)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2DiBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=8 December 2014|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-27164-7|pages=61–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daoism's biggest known conceptions are folk religion, the Celestial Masters and Quanzhen Daoism in the modern era since Wang Changyue launched a renaissance of the Quanzhen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Chinese Religion I (2 vol.set): Song-Liao-Jin-Yuan (960-1368 AD)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2DiBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1158#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=8 December 2014|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-27164-7|pages=1158–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Celestial Masters have survived into the 20th century. In 1949, after the communists gained power in the mainland, the Celestial Master fled to [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/arts---leisure/2008/12/15/187654/Who%E2%80%99s-going.htm Who’s going to be the 65th Taoist pope?]," ''The China Post'', December 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of the 64th Master, a succession dispute arose between different branches of the family in Taiwan and mainland China.

In fact, the Way of the Celestial Masters have flourished during the reign of Communism.  They regularly ordain priests at the Zhengyi Monastery at the Celestial Master’s Mansion in Mainland China.

The Way of the Celestial Masters have tribes worldwide, including the United States.  Their western United States branch is headed by Grandmaster Jerry Alan Johnson and is known as the Temple of the Celestial Cloud.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.daoistmagic.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs and practices==
[[Image:Zhang Daoling.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Zhang Daoling, the first Celestial Master]]
Each of the three different eras of the Celestial Masters had distinct beliefs. However, because the Southern and Northern Celestial Masters both descended directly from the initial movement founded by Zhang Daoling, there are many beliefs that are shared. A number of texts exist that give insight into early Celestial Master practice, in particular the ''[[Taiping Jing]]'' and the ''[[Xiang'er]]'' commentary to the Laozi.

The foundation of Daoist belief is that there is an energy source known as [[qi]] that pervades all things. The human body also contains qi, but it only has a limited amount of qi. Qi could be lost from the body through things such as sweating and ejaculation. The Celestial Masters shared these foundational Daoist beliefs, but modified them slightly.

One such change was that illness was caused by [[sin]]. This was because sin caused qi to leave the body. In order to cure any illness, repentance was a crucial factor in ensuring that the loss of qi could be staunched. Repentance could be accomplished by spending time in a 'Chamber of Silence,' and reflecting on one's sins, or by beating one's breasts and [[kowtow]]ing to heaven. Illness could also be cured in other ways as well, among them using medicinal herbs and by listening to ritual music. Eating very little was also of extreme importance, and an ideal diet would consist of no food at all, but only noncorporeal things such as air, which the person could absorb through meditation.

Sexual practices (known as [[heqi]], or 'The Union of the Breaths') were not part of Celestial Master Daoism. While the School of the Naturalists (and offshoot schools) advocate not ejaculating during sex in order to 'nourish the brain,' the Celestial Masters frowned upon this, and simply advocated celibacy as a way to avoid losing qi. In addition, the Celestial Masters thought that the macrobiotic method of stealing a woman's qi to replenish the man's own qi was completely wrong, and should not be practiced.&lt;ref&gt;Bokenkamp (1997), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

The Celestial Masters were the first group of organized Daoists. Before their foundation, Daoism did not exist as an organized religion. Being the first organized religious Daoists, the Celestial Masters are the ancestors of subsequent Daoist movements such as the [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] and [[Lingbao School|Lingbao]] movements.

'''Yuán''' ({{zh|t=緣|zh|s=缘|p=yuán}}) or '''Yuanfen''' ({{zh|t=緣分|zh|s=缘分|p=yuánfèn}}; [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: duyên phận), "fateful coincidence," is a concept in the [[Chinese folk religion]] describing good and bad chances and potential relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Fan, Chen. 2013. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be translated as "destiny, luck as conditioned by one's past," or "natural affinity among friends."&lt;ref&gt;''Lin Yutang's Chinese English Dictionary of Modern Usage'' (Hong Kong: The Chinese University Press of Hong Kong, 1972) p. 1432.&lt;/ref&gt; It is comparable to the concept of ''[[karma]]'' in [[Buddhism]], but ''yuanfen'' is interactive rather than individual.  The driving forces and causes behind ''yuánfèn'' are said to be actions done in previous [[reincarnation|incarnation]]s. 

Scholars [[Yang Kuo-shu]] and David Ho have analysed the psychological advantages of this belief: by assigning causality of negative events to ''yuanfen'' beyond personal control, people tend to maintain good relationships, avoid conflict, and promote social harmony; likewise, when positive events are seen as result of ''yuanfen'', personal credit is not directly assigned, which reduces pride on one side of the relationship and envy and resentment on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Fan, Chen. 2013. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yang, Ho pp. 269, 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in society==
[[Yang Kuo-shu]] and David Ho trace the origins of the term to traditional Buddhism and observe that ''yuan '' or ''yuanfen'' are important concepts in maintaining social harmony in personal relationships and group solidarity because they attribute cause or "fateful coincidence" to an outside factor beyond the control or responsibility of individuals. Yang and Ho's research found that these concepts are still very much alive in Chinese social life and culture among university students. The concepts of ''yuan ''and ''yuanfen ''and beliefs in predestination and fatalism have waned, and belief in yuan has waned as well, but continuity with past conceptions is still strong.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, Ho pp. 269, 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marc Moscowitz, an anthropologist, finds that ''yuanfen'' appears frequently in [[Mandopop|contemporary popular music]]. Here ''yuanfen'' refers to a “karmic relationship” with someone who was known in a previous life and is used to explain the end of a relationship that was not destined to work out.&lt;ref&gt;Moscowitz p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular usage==

* The proverbial saying "have fate without destiny" refers to couples who were fated to ''come'' together, but not destined to ''stay'' together, and as such is sometimes used as a break-up line.
* Upon meeting a person (of any gender) who is hard to find, one might aptly exclaim: "It is ''yuánfèn'' that has brought us together!"
* When one encounters another repeatedly in various locations such that it seems to be more than coincidence, one can refer to ''yuánfèn''.
* As a counter-example, when two people know each other, e.g. as [[penpal]]s, but never have the opportunity to meet face-to-face, it can be said that their ''yuánfèn'' is too superficial or thin.

The proverb: 百世修來同船渡，千載修得共枕眠 ([[Traditional Chinese characters|Traditional]])/百世修来同船渡，千载修得共枕眠 ([[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified]]) ([[pinyin]]: bǎi shì xiū lái tóng chuán dù, qiān zǎi xiū dé gòng zhěn mián).

* Literally: It takes hundreds of rebirths to bring two persons to ride in the same boat; it takes a thousand eons to bring two persons to share the same pillow. This goes to show just how precious ''yuánfèn'' is.
* An alternative of this proverb is: 十年修得同船渡，百年修得共枕眠 (same in both [[Traditional Chinese characters|Traditional]] and [[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified]] characters) ([[pinyin]]: shí nián xiū dé tóng chuán dù, bǎi nián xiū dé gòng zhěn mián),which means literally: ten years of meditation (or good deeds) bring two people to cross a river in the same ferry, and a hundred years of [[meditation]] (or good deeds) bring two people to rest their heads on the same pillow. It conveys the same message.
* It is important to note that although ''yuanfen ''is often used in the context of lovers' relationships, the concept itself is much broader and can refer to any relationship between people under any circumstance. For example, ''yuanfen ''can be thought of as the mechanism by which family members have been "placed" in each other's lives. On the other hand, even two strangers sitting next to each other on a short-haul plane ride are also thought to have a certain amount of ''yuanfen''. The line of reasoning follows roughly as such: out of the seven billion or so people living on this planet, the odds of two specific persons riding in an airplane together are astronomically small. Thus, two specific persons riding together on a plane have beaten out all odds to end up in those specific seats. If, in addition to their chance encounter, they happen to strike up an engaging conversation and find that they have common interests—perhaps in cinema, music, and/or photography—it makes their meeting all the more precious, and the depth of their yuanfen all the more noteworthy.

{{unreferenced section|date = November 2014}}

"Affinity occasion" could be a good translation of ''yuánfèn'' since ''yuánfèn'' really depends on the probability or a number of chances of meeting (or seeing) someone in the real world at any given time and space/place, however, although in reality haven't yet known each other for very long time, both persons felt as if they have already known each other for a very long time.

The concept of "synchronicity" from the Swiss psychologist [[Carl Jung]] is a good English translation of ''yuanfen''. The French writer [[Émile Deschamps]] claims in his memoirs that in 1805, he was treated to some plum pudding by a stranger named Monsieur de Fontgibu. Ten years later, the writer encountered plum pudding on the menu of a Paris restaurant and wanted to order some, but the waiter told him that the last dish had already been served to another customer, who turned out to be de Fontgibu. Many years later, in 1832, Deschamps was at a dinner and once again ordered plum pudding. He recalled the earlier incident and told his friends that only de Fontgibu was missing to make the setting complete—and in the same instant, the now senile de Fontgibu entered the room.

Often ''yuánfèn'' is said to be the equivalent of "fate" (as is with the title of a 1984 [[film|movie]], given the western name ''Behind the Yellow Line'', starring [[Leslie Cheung]]) or "destiny". However, these words do not have the element of the past playing a role in deciding the outcome of the uncertain future. The most common Chinese term for "fate" or "destiny" is ''mìngyùn'' ([[Traditional Chinese character]]: [[wikt:命運|命運]]; [[Simplified Chinese character]]: [[wikt:命運|命运]]), literally "the turn of events in life".

"Providence" and "[[predestination]]" are not exact translations, because these words imply that the things happen by the will of God or [[Chinese mythology|god]]s, whereas ''yuánfèn'' does not necessarily involve divine intervention.

'''Yunju Temple''' ({{zh|s=云居寺|t=雲居寺|p=Yúnjū Sì}}) is a [[Buddhist temple]] located in [[Fangshan District]], 70 kilometers southwest of [[Beijing]] and contains the world's largest collection of stone Buddhist sutra steles in the world.  Yunju Temple also contains one of only two extant woodblocks for the Chinese Buddhist Tripitaka in the world and rare copies of printed and manuscript Chinese Buddhist Tripitakas.  It also has many historic pagodas dating from the Tang and Liao Dynasty.

==History==
The exact year Yunju Temple was built is unknown; however construction started during the [[Northern Qi]] Dynasty (550 CE – 570 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yw.eywedu.com/wenhua/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=5959  |title=北京 “敦煌”—— 房山石经及云居寺 |website=古詩文翻譯網 (tr. to English: Translation of Ancient Literature Web) |language=Chinese |trans-title=Beijing’s Dunhuang: Fangshan Stone Sutra and Yunju Temple |access-date=2017-10-24 |quote=关于云居寺的始建时间，许多人认为是静琬刻经时所建，其实不然。据辽天庆七年(公元 1117 年)《大辽燕京涿州范阳县白带山石经云居寺释迦佛舍利塔记》载：“案诸传记并起寺碑，原其此寺始自北齐(公元 550—577年)，迄至隋代，有幽州智泉寺沙门智苑，……发心磨莹贞石镌造大藏经，以备法灭 (tr. to English: regarding the time Yunju temple was first built, many people assume it was when Jingwan started to engrave stone sutra steles, in fact that is not so.  According to “The Records of the Great Liao Yanjing Zhuozhou Fanyang County Baidai Mountain Stone Sutra Stele and Yunju Temple Buddha Sarira Pagoda” written in 1117 CE, it was recorded : “According to numerous records and temple stone steles, originally this temple (i.e. Yunju Temple) started in the [[Northern Qi]] Dynasty(550 CE – 570 CE) up to the Sui Dynasty (581 CE – 618 CE) when a monk named Zhiyuan (also known as Jingwan) from Zhiquan Temple located in Youzhou province made a vow to polish solid rock to engrave the Buddhist Tripitaka in order to prepare for the end of Buddhism.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 611 CE, a high priest named [[Jingwan]] (? - 639 CE) made a vow to engraved Buddhist sutras on stone steles to insure Buddhism's future survival because of the challenges Chinese Buddhism had recently faced during the anti-Buddhist campaigns of [[Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei]] and [[Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ddc.shengyen.org/mobile/text/06-05/114.php |title=火宅清涼 十六、雲居寺、石經山 |authors=Shi Shengyen |year=1991 |page=114 |website=法鼓全集 The Complete Collection of Dharma Drum |language=Chinese |trans-title=A Cool Wind in a Burning House (Chapter 16 : Yunju Temple and Stone Sutra Mountain) |access-date=2017-10-24 |quote=:石經的雕刻工程，是起於佛教的末法思想，所謂末法之說……歷正法，像法，末法的三期，最後法滅。南嶽慧思禪師相信正法五百年，像法一千年，末法一萬年，而隋世正好是佛涅槃一千五百年，因為剛經過北魏太武帝及北周武帝的滅法運動，佛法遭受到無情的打擊，所以在南嶽慧思禪師，就有末法時代已經開始的信仰。當時他的弟子靜琬，便擔心佛教很快就會被毀，所以發起了石雕佛經藏於山洞的運動。(tr. to English:  The engraving (of the stone sutra steles) came from the belief in (the coming of) the Degenerate Age of Buddhism……divides the time period when Buddhism exists in the world into three ages : the Age of the Right Dharma, the Age of the Semblence Dharma and the Degenerate Age – the end of which Buddhism perishes (c.f. [[Three Ages of Buddhism]]).  Chan Master [[Huisi]] of Nanyue believed that the Age of the Right Dharma would last five hundred years, the Age of the Semblance Dharma would last one thousand years and the Degenerate Age would last ten thousand years.  Moreover because the Sui Dynasty (581 CE- 618 CE) was (believed to be) already 1,500 years since the parinirvāṇa of Buddha and because of the recent memories of the ruthless attacks Buddhism suffered during Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei and Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou’s Anti-Buddhist Movement, Chan Master [[Huisi]] of Nanyue believed the Degenerate Age was already in progress. At the same time, his disciple Jingwan also worried Buddhism would very soon be destroyed and therefore started the movement of engraving stone sutra steles to be hidden in mountain caves.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venerable Jingwan therefore set in motion a movement to engraved Buddhist sutras on stone steles that continued for over a thousand years; the last stone sutra stele engraved is dated to 1691 CE --- although by that time. the belief in the impending disaster of the Degenerate Age had subsided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tripitaka.cbeta.org/B26n0146_002 |title=房山雲居寺石經──經文、題記、碑銘等拓片之選輯 第2卷 |website=CBETA 漢文大藏經 (tr. to English: CBETA (Chinese Buddhist Electronic Tripitaka Association) Chinese Buddhist Tripitaka)  |language=Chinese |trans-title=Fangshan Yunju Temple Stone Sutras – Rubbings of Selected Sutra Text, Descriptive Inscriptions, Stone Stele Inscriptions, etc., Scroll No. 2  |access-date=2017-10-24 |quote=[0012a06] ...清代康熙以後雖然幾次修葺雲居寺，也刻了一些經碑立於寺中但已失去石經原來錮藏以備法滅時充經本用的意義了。(tr. to English: [0012a06] ...Yunju Temple was repaired several times during the Qing Dynasty after Emperor Kangxi's reign and some sutras were also engraved on stone stele which were placed inside temple halls.

In addition to text, they were also engraved sometimes with images of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas as well as [[Siddhaṃ]] Letters.  The collection of stone sutra steles is also sometimes called the Fangshan Stone Sutra.  Venerable Jingwan initially vowed to engrave the entire Tripitaka; at least ten titles still survive today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tripitaka.cbeta.org/B26n0146_002 |title=房山雲居寺石經──經文、題記、碑銘等拓片之選輯 第2卷 |website=CBETA 漢文大藏經 (tr. to English: CBETA (Chinese Buddhist Electronic Tripitaka Association) Chinese Buddhist Tripitaka) |language=Chinese |trans-title=Fangshan Yunju Temple Stone Sutra – Rubbings of Selected Sutra Text, Descriptive Inscriptions, Stone Stele Inscriptions, etc., Scroll No. 2  |access-date=2017-10-24 |quote=[0012a10]靜琬最初 發願要刻的十二部經具體經名沒有寫明，已無法考查。然就現存可認為是靜琬刻造的石經，主要有：《法華經》、《華嚴經》、《晉譯》、《涅槃經》、《維摩經》、《勝鬘經》、《金剛經》、《佛遺教經》、《無量義經》、《彌勒上生經》等。(tr. to English: [0011a07] Ven.

This stone sutra stele explicitly states in its colophon : “Tripitaka Master Xuanzang was ordered to translate”;moreover the merits for engraving the stele came mainly from Yueyang County adjacent from Chang’an (today’s Xian), which is not far from Daci’en Monastery [where Xuanzang was translating sutras at the time]. Also there is another engraved stone stele of the Heart Sutra [located at Fangshan] dated to 669 CE which also has the same colophon inscription i.e. “Tripitaka Master Xuanzang was ordered to translate”. In addition to these, we have the Xian's [[Stele Forest]] [stone stele] dated to 672 CE, Hongfu Temple’s [another temple where Tripitaka Master Xuanzang translated sutras] Ven. Master Huairen’s [commission of the (re)engraving of] “Foreword of the Holy Teaching of the Tripitaka of the Great Tang” [written by Emperor [[Tang Taizong]]] [reign 626 CE - 649 CE] and on the reverse the “Heart Sutra”  [both] in the collected calligraphic style of [[Wang Xizhi]], also is inscribed with “Xuanzang was ordered to translate”.  Therefore these examples certified that Xuanzang did indeed translate the Heart Sutra and furthermore was ordered to do so by Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Sui and Tang Dynasties, donors oftentimes determined which sutra to engraved on the stone stele; hence many sutras were engraved multiple times.  Royal patronage began in the Sui Dynasty (see below for rediscovery of Buddha relics). During the [[Tang Dynasty]], Princess Jinxian (ca. 713 - 755 CE) petition [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] to donate over 4,000 manuscript scrolls of the Buddhist Tripitaka and land to support Yunju Temple's engraving of stone sutra steles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tripitaka.cbeta.org/B26n0146_002 |title=房山雲居寺石經──經文、題記、碑銘等拓片之選輯 第2卷 |website=CBETA 漢文大藏經 (tr. to English: CBETA (Chinese Buddhist Electronic Tripitaka Association) Chinese Buddhist Tripitaka)  |language=Chinese |trans-title=Fangshan Yunju Temple Stone Sutras – Rubbings of Selected Sutra Text, Descriptive Inscriptions, Stone Stele Inscriptions, etc., Scroll No. 2  |access-date=2017-10-24 |quote=[0014a17] 惠暹和玄法的刻造石經事業，得到了唐玄宗第八妹金仙長公主的大力施助。據上述王守泰撰《山頂石浮圖後記》記載：[0015a01] 「大唐開元十八年，金仙長公主為奏聖上，賜大唐新舊譯經四千餘卷，充幽府范陽縣為石經本...」and [0015a05] 《後記》同時還載明了當時負責送這些經本的人是長安崇福寺沙門，著名的《開元釋教錄》著者智昇。由此可見，金仙長公主當時對房山雲居寺石經事業的施助，不僅送來四千多卷經本，而且劃出大片田園山林作為刻造石經的經費。因此惠暹和玄法才有條件刻造幾部大部頭的佛經。(tr. to English: [0014a17] Huixian and Xuanfa (descendants of disciples of Jingwan) engraving of stone sutras received the tremendous support of Emperor Xuanzong's eighth younger sister, Princess Jinxian.  ...according to the "Latter Record of the Mountaintop Stone Stele": [0015a01] Princess Jinxian petition Emperor Xuanzong in 730 CE to donate over 4,000 (manuscript) scrolls of New and Old translations of the Tripitaka for the engraving of stone sutras in Chongyufu Fanyang District...and [0015a05] According to the "Latter Record" at the same time the person responsible for delivering these manuscript scrolls was Chang'an's famous monk/writer Zhisheng of Chongfu Temple, (compiler of the Kaiyuan Record of Buddhist Teaching ca. 730 CE(Catalog)).  Therefore the assistance Princess Jinxian offered at the time to the engraving of the stone sutras at Yunju Temple, was not limited to only donating 4,000 scrolls of sutras but furthermore she planned for the expense of engraving the stone sutras with the donation of fields, orchards and forests.  Therefore Huixian and Xuanfa was given the ability to engrave large sections of Buddhist sutras.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is still a pagoda commemorating Princess Jinxian's support on the top of Fangshan mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ddc.shengyen.org/mobile/text/06-05/114.php |title=火宅清涼 十六、雲居寺、石經山 |authors=Shi Shengyen |year=1991 |page=115 |website=法鼓全集 The Complete Collection of Dharma Drum |language=Chinese |trans-title=A Cool Wind in a Burning House (Chapter 16 : Yunju Temple and Stone Sutra Mountain) |access-date=2017-10-24 |quote=:到現在為止，在石經山的頂上還有一座金仙公主的紀念塔。(tr. to English:  Even now on the top of Stone Sutra Mountain (on top of Leiyin Cave) there is still a pagoda that commemorates Princess Jinxian.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Liao Dynasty]], royal patronage attempted to complete the engraving of the incomplete Mahayana sutras and missing Mahayana titles.  Also during this time, royal patronage attempted to engrave on stone stele the entire Liao Dynasty's Khitan Tripitaka ({{zh |t=契丹藏}}). Because the Sui and Tang Dynasty manuscripts on which the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang Dynasty]] stone steles were based as well as the printed copies of the Khitan Tripitaka on which the Liao Dynasty stone sutras were based have largely disappeared, this makes the Fangshan stone sutras of Yunju Temple a rare treasure house of Buddhist sutras.&lt;ref&gt;Dan and Wang 2001, p26&lt;/ref&gt; Since these stone steles were engraved with an eye on fidelity to the original, they can be used to potentially correct later printed Tripitakas.  Since Venerable Jingwan's time a total of nine caves were excavated and filled with stone sutra steles, two underground depository rooms were also excavated and numerous temple halls were added and repaired.  The most famous cave is Cave No. 5 popularly known as Leiyin Cave ({{zh|s=雷音洞|t=雷音洞}}）.  This cave is opened for public viewing and is a large cave covered with stone sutra steles on four walls with an area for Buddhist ceremonies. Formerly a statue of Maitreya, the next Buddha was enshrined here but it was removed by unknown persons during the early 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://big5.china.com.cn/culture/txt/2009-06/22/content_17990450_3.htm |title=佛舍利明起重回雲居寺 |date=2009-06-22 |website=中国网 China.com.cn |language=Chinese |trans-title=Buddha Relic (Śarīra) Starting Tomorrow to Return to Yunju Temple |access-date=2017-10-24 |quote=雷音洞內不到40平方米，高不到3米，中間原有一座彌勒佛像，上世紀40年代初被挪走...(tr. to English: Leiyin Cave is about 40 square meters and about 3 meters in height.

In total, 1,122 Buddhist sutras in 3572 volumes were produced at the temple consisting of over 14,200 stone steles engraved on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130205224405/http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5319/] Pagoda, Library Caves and Stone Tablets of Sutra of Yunju Temple – UNESCO World Heritage Center.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There are also over 22,000 scrolls of rare printed or manuscript sutras kept at Yunju Temple.  The Ming Dynasty's Yongle Southern Tripitaka (1420 CE) and Yongle Northern Tripitaka (1440 CE) are stored here as well as individual printed sutras and manuscripts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yunju Temple also has one of only two extant complete woodblocks of the Chinese Tripitaka in the world : namely the Qianlong Tripitaka (1733).  Carved on over 77,000 blocks, it attracts a large number of visitors. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/beijing/2012-12/19/content_16031223.htm &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The other extant complete woodblock of the Chinese Tripitaka is located in Korea in [[Haeinsa]] (see also [[Tripitaka Koreana]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''Zoroastrianism''',{{refn|group=n|Less frequently known as '''Mazdaism''' or '''Magianism''' from the [[Magi]] or '''Zarathustraism''' from an alternate name of [[Zoroaster]].}} or '''Mazdayasna''', is one of the world's oldest religions that remains active.

The most important texts of the religion are those of the ''[[Avesta]]'', which includes the writings of Zoroaster known as the [[Gathas]], enigmatic poems that define the religion's precepts, and the [[Yasna]], the scripture. The full name by which Zoroaster addressed the deity is: Ahura, The Lord Creator, and Mazda, Supremely Wise. The religious philosophy of Zoroaster divided the early Iranian gods of Proto-Indo-Iranian tradition, but focused on [[Personal responsibility|responsibility]], and did not create a devil ''per se''. Zoroaster proclaimed that there is only one God, the singularly creative and sustaining force of the Universe, and that human beings are given a right of choice. Because of cause and effect, they are responsible for the consequences of their choices.  The contesting force to Ahura Mazda was called Angra Mainyu, or angry spirit. Post-Zoroastrian scripture introduced the concept of Ahriman, the Devil, which was effectively a personification of Angra Mainyu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zarathushtra.com/z/article/overview.htm |title=Zarathushtra's Philosophy : Basic Overview|website=Zarathushtra.com|date=|accessdate=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyce_1979_6-12"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1979|pp=6–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoroastrianism has no major theological divisions, though it is not uniform; modern-era influences having a significant impact on individual and local beliefs, practices, values and vocabulary, sometimes merging with tradition and in other cases displacing it.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;  In Zoroastrianism, the purpose in life is to "be among those who renew the world...to make the world progress towards perfection". Its basic maxims include:

* Humata, Hukhta, Huvarshta, which mean: Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds.
* There is only one path and that is the path of Truth.
* Do the right thing because it is the right thing to do, and then all beneficial rewards will come to you also.

==Terminology==
The name ''Zoroaster'' is a [[Greek language|Greek]] rendering of the name ''Zarathustra''. He is known as ''Zartosht'' and ''Zardosht'' in [[Persian language|Persian]] and ''Zaratosht'' in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]. The Zoroastrian name of the religion is ''Mazdayasna'', which combines ''Mazda-'' with the [[Avestan language]] word ''[[yasna]]'', meaning "worship, devotion". In [[English language|English]], an adherent of the faith is commonly called a Zoroastrian or a Zarathustrian. An older expression still used today is ''Behdin'', meaning "The best Religion | '''''Beh''''' &lt; Middle Persian '''''Weh''''' (good) + '''''Din''''' &lt; Middle Persian '''''dēn''''' &lt; Avestan '''''Daēnā'''''". In Zoroastrian [[liturgy]] the term is used as a title for an individual who has been formally inducted into the religion in a ''[[Navjote]]'' ceremony.

The term ''Mazdaism'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|z|d|ə|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) is a typical 19th century construct, taking ''Mazda-'' from the name [[Ahura Mazda]] and adding the suffix ''-ism'' to suggest a belief system. The March 2001 draft edition of the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' also records an alternate form, ''Mazdeism'', perhaps derived from the French ''Mazdéisme'', which first appeared in 1871.

Zoroastrian philosophy is identified as having been known to [[Italian Renaissance]] Europe through an image of Zoroaster in [[Raphael]]'s "[[School of Athens]]" by [[Giorgio Vasari]] in 1550. The first surviving reference to Zoroaster in English scholarship is attributed to [[Thomas Browne]] (1605–1682), who briefly refers to the prophet in his 1643 ''[[Religio Medici]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Browne, T. (1643) "Religio Medici"&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the ''Oxford English Dictionary's'' record of the 1743 (Warburton, ''Pope's Essay''). The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' records use of the term ''Zoroastrianism'' in 1874 in [[Archibald Sayce]]'s ''Principles of Comparative Philology''.

==Overview==

===Theology===

{{Weasel|section|date=April 2016}}

Zoroastrians believe that there is one universal, transcendent, supreme god, [[Ahura Mazda]], or the "Wise Lord". (''Ahura'' means "Being" and ''Mazda'' means "Mind" in a sacred Old Iranian language called [[Avestan]]).&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|last=Duchesne-Guillemin|first=Jacques|title=Zoroastrianism|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/658081/Zoroastrianism|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zoroaster]] keeps the two attributes separate as two different concepts in most of the [[Gathas]] and also consciously uses a masculine word for one concept and a feminine for the other, as if to distract from an [[anthropomorphism]] of his divinity. Zoroaster claimed that Ahura Mazda is almighty, though not omnipotent.

Other scholars assert that since Zoroastrianism's divinity covers both being and mind as [[Immanence|immanent]] entities, it is better described as a belief in an immanent self-creating universe with consciousness as its special attribute, thereby putting Zoroastranism in the [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] fold where it can be easily traced to its shared origin with Indian [[Brahmanism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=l0NtAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA38 ''The Student's Manual of Oriental History: Medes and Persians, Phœnicians, and Arabians''], Page. 38, by François Lenormant, E. Chevallier&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwIkZaZvItAC&amp;pg=PA81 |title=General Sketch of the History of Pantheism |author=Constance E. Plumptre |page=81 |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, Ahura Mazda's creation—evident is widely agreed as ''[[asha]]'', truth and order—is the [[antithesis]] of chaos, which is evident as ''druj'', falsehood and disorder. The resulting conflict involves the entire universe, including humanity, which has an active role to play in the conflict.&lt;ref name="iranica.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zoroastrianism: Holy text, beliefs and practices|date=2010-03-01|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/zoroastrianism-i-historical-review|website=Iranicaonline.org|accessdate=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Zoroastrian tradition, the "chaotic" is represented by Angra Mainyu (also referred to as "Ahriman"), the "Destructive Principle", while the benevolent is represented through Ahura Mazda's [[Amesha Spenta|Spenta Mainyu]], the instrument or "Bounteous Principle" of the act of creation. It is through Spenta Mainyu that transcendental Ahura Mazda is [[immanence|immanent]] in humankind, and through which the Creator interacts with the world. According to Zoroastrian [[cosmology]], in articulating the [[Ahuna Vairya]] formula, Ahura Mazda made His ultimate triumph evident to Angra Mainyu. As expressions and aspects of Creation, Ahura Mazda emanated the [[Amesha Spenta]]s ("Bounteous Immortals"), that are each the [[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] and representative of one aspect of that Creation. These Amesha Spenta are in turn assisted by a league of lesser principles, the [[Yazata]]s, each "Worthy of Worship" and each again a hypostasis of a moral or physical aspect of creation.

Zoroastrian theology includes a duty to protect nature. This has led some to proclaim it as the "world's first ecological religion."  Some have argued that, since the protections are part of a ritual, they stem from theology rather than ecology. Others have responded that, since as one of its strongest precepts the scripture calls for the protection of water, earth, fire and air it is, in effect, an ecological religion: "It is not surprising that Mazdaism ... is called the first ecological religion. The reverence for Yazatas (divine spirits) emphasizes the preservation of nature (Avesta: Yasnas 1.19, 3.4, 16.9; Yashts 6.3–4, 10.13)." &lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Foltz]] and Manya Saadi-nejad "[https://www.academia.edu/9387070/Is_Zoroastrianism_an_Ecological_Religion Is Zoroastrianism an Ecological Religion?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101215651/http://www.academia.edu/9387070/Is_Zoroastrianism_an_Ecological_Religion |date=2016-01-01 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; However, this particular assertion is undermined in that Zoroastrians have a duty to exterminate "evil" species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animalsandsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/foltz.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The religion states that active participation in life through good deeds is necessary to ensure happiness and to keep chaos at bay. This active participation is a central element in Zoroaster's concept of [[free will]], and Zoroastrianism rejects all forms of [[monasticism]]. Ahura Mazda will ultimately prevail over the evil [[Angra Mainyu]] or Ahriman, at which point the universe will undergo a cosmic renovation and time will end. In the final renovation, all of creation—even the souls of the dead that were initially banished to "darkness"—will be reunited in Ahura Mazda, returning to life in the undead form. At the end of time, a savior-figure (a [[Saoshyant]]) will bring about a final renovation of the world (''[[frashokereti]]''), in which the dead will be revived.&lt;ref name="iranica.com"/&gt;

In Zoroastrian tradition, life is a temporary state in which a mortal is expected to actively participate in the continuing battle between truth and falsehood. Prior to being born, the ''urvan'' (soul) of an individual is still united with its ''[[fravashi]]'' (guardian spirit), which has existed since Mazda created the universe. During life, the ''fravashi'' acts as a guardian and protector. On the fourth day after death, the soul is reunited with its ''fravashi'', in which the experiences of life in the material world are collected for the continuing battle in the spiritual world. For the most part, Zoroastrianism does not have a notion of [[reincarnation]], at least not until the final renovation of the world. Followers of [[Ilm-e-Kshnoom]] in India believe in reincarnation and practice vegetarianism, two principles unknown to Orthodox Zoroastrianism,{{sfn|Boyce|2007|p=205}}&lt;!-- the final renovation of the world includes the revival of the dead, and this revival may (subject to which tradition is being followed) be interpreted as a revival in corporeal form--&gt; although Zoroaster was himself a vegetarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=J. Christopher Reyes|year=1963|title=In his name}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--[[File:Zartosht.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zoroaster]]; portrayed here in a popular Parsi Zoroastrian depiction. This image emerged in the eighteenth century.{{deletable image-caption|Wednesday, 12 January 2011}}]]--&gt;
In Zoroastrianism, water (''[[aban|apo]]'', ''aban'') and fire (''[[atar]]'', ''azar'') are agents of ritual purity, and the associated purification ceremonies are considered the basis of ritual life. In Zoroastrian [[cosmogony]], water and fire are respectively the second and last primordial elements to have been created, and scripture considers fire to have its origin in the waters&lt;!-- (Boyce supposes this idea is due to an identification of lightning with rain) --&gt;. Both water and fire are considered life-sustaining, and both water and fire are represented within the precinct of a [[fire temple]]. Zoroastrians usually pray in the presence of some form of fire (which can be considered evident in any source of light), and the [[Ab-Zohr|culminating rite]] of the principle act of worship constitutes a "strengthening of the waters". Fire is considered a medium through which spiritual insight and wisdom is gained, and water is considered the source of that wisdom.

A corpse is considered a host for decay, i.e., of ''druj''. Consequently, scripture enjoins the safe disposal of the dead in a manner such that a corpse does not pollute the good creation. These injunctions are the doctrinal basis of the fast-fading traditional practice of ritual exposure, most commonly identified with the so-called [[Tower of Silence|Towers of Silence]] for which there is no standard technical term in either scripture or tradition. Ritual exposure is only practiced by Zoroastrian communities of the [[Indian subcontinent]], in locations where it is not illegal and [[diclofenac]] poisoning has not led to the virtual extinction of scavenger birds. Other Zoroastrian communities either [[cremation|cremate]] their dead, or bury them in graves that are cased with [[lime mortar]].

While the [[Parsi|Parsees]] in India have traditionally been opposed to [[proselytizing]], and even considered it a crime for which the culprit may face expulsion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khan|first=Roni K|edition=Online|year=1996|title=Traditional Zoroastrianism: Tenets of the Religion|url=http://tenets.parsizoroastrianism.com/|website=Tenets.parsizoroastrianism.com|accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian Zoroastrians have never been opposed to conversion, and the practice has been endorsed by the Council of [[Mobad|Mobed]]s of [[Tehran]]. While the Iranian authorities do not permit proselytizing within Iran, Iranian Zoroastrians in exile have actively encouraged missionary activities, with The Zarathushtrian Assembly in [[Los Angeles]] and the International Zoroastrian Centre in [[Paris]] as two prominent centres. As in many other faiths, Zoroastrians are encouraged to marry others of the same faith, but this is not a requirement.

The roots of Zoroastrianism are thought to have emerged from a common prehistoric [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] religious system dating back to the early 2nd millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Foltz 2013, pp. 10–18&lt;/ref&gt;  The prophet Zoroaster himself, though traditionally dated to the 6th century BCE, is thought by many modern historians to have been a reformer of the polytheistic Iranian religion who lived in the 10th century BCE.&lt;ref name="Atlas"&gt;Patrick Karl O'Brien, ed. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ffZy5tDjaUkC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq= ''Atlas of World History''], concise edn. (NY: Oxford UP, 2002), 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Zoroastrianism as a religion was not firmly established until several centuries later. Zoroastrianism enters recorded history in the mid-5th century BCE. [[Herodotus]]' ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' (completed ''c.'' 440&amp;nbsp;BCE) includes a description of [[Greater Iran]]ian society with what may be recognizably Zoroastrian features, including exposure of the dead.

''The Histories'' is a primary source of information on the early period of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid era]] (648–330&amp;nbsp;BCE), in particular with respect to the role of the [[Magi]]. According to Herodotus i.101, the Magi were the sixth tribe of the [[Medes]] (until the unification of the Persian empire under [[Cyrus the Great]], all Iranians were referred to as "Mede" or "Mada" by the peoples of the Ancient World), who appear to have been the priestly caste of the Mesopotamian-influenced branch of Zoroastrianism today known as [[Zurvanism]], and who wielded considerable influence at the courts of the Median emperors.

[[File:Map of the Achaemenid Empire.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|right|The Zoroastrian [[Achaemenid Empire]] at its greatest extent.]]

Following the unification of the Median and Persian empires in 550 BCE, Cyrus the Great and, later, his son [[Cambyses II]] curtailed the powers of the Magi after they had attempted to sow dissent following their loss of influence. In 522 BCE, the Magi revolted and set up a rival claimant to the throne. The usurper, pretending to be Cyrus' younger son [[Smerdis]], took power shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dHIlhU4Gd5AC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=cambises+and+smerdis+#v=onepage&amp;q=cambises&amp;f=false |title=Resumen de la Historia Universal: escrito con su conocimiento, y aprobado ... – Joan Cortada i Sala – Google Libros |publisher=Books.google.com.ar |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07|year=1867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the [[despotism|despotic rule]] of [[Cambyses]] and his long absence in Egypt, "the whole people, Persians, Medes and all the other nations" acknowledged the usurper, especially as he granted a remission of taxes for three years (Herodotus iii. 68).

Darius I and later [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenid emperors]] acknowledged their devotion to Ahura Mazda in inscriptions, as attested to several times in the [[Behistun]] inscription, and appear to have continued the model of coexistence with other religions. Whether Darius was a follower of Zoroaster has not been conclusively established, since devotion to Ahura Mazda was (at the time) not necessarily an indication of an adherence to Zoroaster's teaching. A number of the Zoroastrian texts that today are part of the greater compendium of the [[Avesta]] have been attributed to that period. This calendar attributed to the Achaemenid period is still in use today. Additionally, the divinities, or [[yazata]]s, are present-day Zoroastrian [[angel]]s (Dhalla, 1938).

According to later Zoroastrian legend (''[[Denkard]]'' and the ''[[Book of Arda Viraf]]''), many sacred texts were lost when [[Alexander the Great]]'s troops invaded [[Persepolis]] and subsequently destroyed the royal library there. [[Diodorus Siculus]]'s ''Bibliotheca historica'', which was completed circa 60 BCE, appears to substantiate this Zoroastrian legend (Diod. 17.72.2–17.72.6). According to one archaeological examination, the ruins of the palace of [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] bear traces of having been burned (Stolze, 1882). Whether a vast collection of (semi-)religious texts "written on parchment in gold ink", as suggested by the ''Denkard'', actually existed remains a matter of speculation, but is unlikely. Given that many of the ''Denkard''s statements-as-fact have since been refuted by scholars, the tale of the library is widely accepted to be fictional (Kellens, 2002).

Alexander's conquests largely displaced Zoroastrianism with [[Hellenistic religion|Hellenistic beliefs]],&lt;ref name="Atlas" /&gt; though the religion continued to be practiced many centuries following the demise of the Achaemenids in mainland Persia and the core regions of the former Achaemenid Empire, most notably [[Anatolia]], [[Mesopotamia]], and the [[Caucasus]]. In the [[Cappadocia|Cappadocian kingdom]], whose territory was formerly an Achaemenid possession, Persian colonists, cut off from their co-religionists in Iran proper, continued to practice the faith [Zoroastrianism] of their forefathers; and there [[Strabo]], observing in the first century B.C., records (XV.3.15) that these "fire kindlers" possessed many "holy places of the Persian Gods", as well as fire temples.&lt;ref name="books.google.nl"&gt;Mary Boyce.

===Late antiquity===
As late as the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] period, [[Armenian mythology|a form of Zoroastrianism]] was without a doubt the dominant religion in the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenian]] lands.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Boyce. [https://books.google.nl/books?id=a6gbxVfjtUEC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=armenians+zoroastrianism+christianity&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAWoVChMIi5zf656SxgIVgbMsCh1xBQB1#v=onepage&amp;q=armenians%20zoroastrianism%20christianity&amp;f=false ''Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices''] Psychology Press, 2001 {{ISBN|0415239028}}, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanids]] aggressively promoted the [[Zurvanite]] form of Zoroastrianism, often building fire temples in captured territories to promote the religion. During the period of their centuries long [[suzerainty]] over the [[Caucasus]], the Sassanids made attempts to promote Zoroastrianism there with considerable successes, and it was prominent in the pre-Christian Caucasus (especially modern-day [[Azerbaijan]]).

Due to its ties to the Christian [[Roman Empire]], Persia's arch-rival since [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] times, the Sassanids were suspicious of [[State church of the Roman Empire|Roman Christianity]], and, after the reign of [[Constantine the Great]], sometimes persecuted it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|page=34|author=Wigram, W.

Most of the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Sassanid Empire was overthrown by the Arabs]] over the course of 16 years in the 7th century. Although the administration of the state was rapidly Islamicized and subsumed under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], in the beginning "there was little serious pressure" exerted on newly subjected people to adopt Islam.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1979_150"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1979|p=150}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their sheer numbers, the conquered Zoroastrians had to be treated as ''[[dhimmi]]s'' (despite doubts of the validity of this identification that persisted down the centuries),&lt;ref name="Boyce_1979_146"/&gt; which made them eligible for protection. Islamic jurists took the stance that only Muslims could be perfectly moral, but "unbelievers might as well be left to their iniquities, so long as these did not vex their overlords."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1979_146"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1979|p=146}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the main, once the conquest was over and "local terms were agreed on", the Arab governors protected the local populations in exchange for tribute.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1979_146"/&gt;

The Arabs adopted the Sassanid tax-system, both the land-tax levied on land owners and the [[tax per head|poll-tax]] levied on individuals,&lt;ref name="Boyce_1979_146"/&gt; called ''[[jizya]]'',&lt;!-- Boyce 1979:146 --&gt; a tax levied on non-Muslims (i.e., the ''dhimmi''s). In time, this poll-tax came to be used as a means to humble the non-Muslims, and a number of laws and restrictions evolved to emphasize their inferior status. Under the early orthodox [[caliphs]], as long as the non-Muslims paid their taxes and adhered to the ''dhimmi'' laws, administrators were enjoined to leave non-Muslims "in their religion and their land." ([[Abu Bakr|Caliph Abu Bakr]], qtd. in {{harvnb|Boyce|1979|p=146}}).

Under Abbasid rule, Muslim Iranians (who by then were in the majority) increasingly found ways to taunt Zoroastrians, and distressing them became a popular sport. For example, in the 9th century, a deeply venerated [[cypress tree]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] (which Parthian-era legend supposed had been planted by Zoroaster himself) was felled for the construction of a palace in Baghdad, {{convert|2000|mi|km}} away. In the 10th century, on the day that a Tower of Silence had been completed at much trouble and expense, a Muslim official contrived to get up onto it, and to call the ''[[adhan]]'' (the Muslim call to prayer) from its walls. This was made a pretext to annex the building.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1979_158"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1979|p=158}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular means to distress Zoroastrians was to maltreat dogs,&lt;!-- Boyce 158--&gt; as these animals are sacred in Zoroastrianism. Such baiting, which was to continue down the centuries, was indulged in by all; not only by high officials, but by the general uneducated population as well.

Ultimately, Muslim scholars like [[Al-Biruni]] found little records left of the belief of, for instance, the Khawarizmians, because figures like [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]] “extinguished and ruined in every possible way all those who knew how to write and read the Khawarizmi writing, who knew the history of the country and who studied their sciences.” As a result, “these things are involved in so much obscurity that it is impossible to obtain an accurate knowledge of the history of the country since the time of Islam...”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lib.iium.edu.my/mom2/cm/content/view/view.jsp?key=CkX1cftLSG76ALezab2WfMEBoHrJ63pJ20091104105517625|title=Kamar Oniah Kamaruzzaman, Al-Biruni: Father of Comparative Religion|website=Lib.iium.edu.my|accessdate=9 June 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713061658/http://lib.iium.edu.my/mom2/cm/content/view/view.jsp?key=CkX1cftLSG76ALezab2WfMEBoHrJ63pJ20091104105517625|archivedate=13 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conversion====
Though subject to a new leadership and harassment, the Zoroastrians were able to continue in their former ways. But there was a slow but steady social and economic pressure to convert.&lt;ref name="Buillet_1979_37.138"&gt;{{harvnb|Buillet|1978|p=37,138}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyce_1979_147"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1979|pp=147}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The nobility and city-dwellers were the first to convert, with Islam more slowly being accepted among the peasantry and landed gentry.&lt;ref name="Buillet_1979_59"&gt;{{harvnb|Buillet|1978|p=59}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Power and worldly-advantage" now lay with followers of Islam, and although the "official policy was one of aloof contempt, there were individual Muslims eager to [[proselytize]] and ready to use all sorts of means to do so."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1979_147"/&gt;

Two decrees in particular encouraged the transition to a preponderantly Islamic society.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The first edict, adapted from an Arsacid and Sassanid one (but in those to the advantage of Zoroastrians), was that only a Muslim could own Muslim slaves or [[indentured servant]]s. Thus, a bonded individual owned by a Zoroastrian could automatically become a freeman by converting to Islam. The other edict was that if one male member of a Zoroastrian family converted to Islam, he instantly inherited all its property.

In time, a tradition evolved by which Islam was made to appear as a partly Iranian religion. One example of this was a legend that [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]], son of the fourth caliph [[Ali Ibn Abi Talib|Ali]] and grandson of Islam's prophet [[Muhammad]], had married a captive Sassanid princess named [[Shahrbanu]]. This "wholly fictitious figure"&lt;ref name="Boyce_1979_151"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1979|p=151}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was said to have borne Husayn [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|a son]], the historical fourth [[Shi'a]] [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|imam]], who claimed that the [[caliphate]] rightly belonged to him and his descendants, and that the [[Umayyad]]s had wrongfully wrested it from him. The alleged descent from the Sassanid house counterbalanced the Arab nationalism of the Umayyads, and the Iranian national association with a Zoroastrian past was disarmed. Thus, according to scholar Mary Boyce, "it was no longer the Zoroastrians alone who stood for patriotism and loyalty to the past."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1979_151"/&gt; The "damning indictment" that becoming Muslim was [[Aniran|Un-Iranian]] only remained an idiom in Zoroastrian texts.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1979_151"/&gt;

With Iranian (especially Persian) support, the [[Abbasids]] overthrew the Umayyads in 750, and in the subsequent caliphate government—that nominally lasted until 1258—Muslim Iranians received marked favor in the new government, both in Iran and at the capital in [[Baghdad]]. This mitigated the antagonism between Arabs and Iranians, but sharpened the distinction between Muslims and non-Muslims. The Abbasids zealously persecuted [[Heresy|heretics]], and although this was directed mainly at Muslim [[sectarians]], it also created a harsher climate for non-Muslims.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1979_152"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1979|p=152}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Abbasids were deadly foes of Zoroastrianism, the brand of Islam they propagated throughout Iran became in turn ever more "Zoroastrianized", making it easier for Iranians to embrace Islam.&lt;!-- 152 --&gt;

====Survival====
[[File:USSHER(1865) p012 BAKU, FIRE TEMPLE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|The [[Ateshgah of Baku|fire temple]] of [[Baku]], c. 1860]]
Despite economic and social incentives to convert, Zoroastrianism remained strong in some regions, particularly in those furthest away from the Caliphate capital at Baghdad. In [[Bukhara]] (in present-day Uzbekistan), resistance to Islam required the 9th-century Arab commander Qutaiba to convert his province four times. The first three times the citizens reverted to their old religion. Finally, the governor made their religion "difficult for them in every way", turned the local fire temple into a mosque, and encouraged the local population to attend Friday prayers by paying each attendee two [[dirhams]].&lt;ref name="Boyce_1979_147"/&gt; The cities where Arab governors resided were particularly vulnerable to such pressures,&lt;!--147--&gt; and in these cases the Zoroastrians were left with no choice but to either conform or migrate to regions that had a more amicable administration.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1979_147"/&gt;

The 9th century came to define&lt;!--e.g., Bailey's ''Zoroastrian problems in the ninth-century books''--&gt; the great number of Zoroastrian texts that were composed or re-written during the 8th to 10th centuries (excluding copying and lesser amendments, which continue for some time thereafter). All of these works are in the [[Middle Persian]] dialect of that period (free of Arabic words), and written in the difficult [[Pahlavi script]] (hence the adoption of the term "Pahlavi" as the name of the variant of the language, and of the genre, of those Zoroastrian books). If read aloud, these books would still have been intelligible to the [[laity]]. Many of these texts are responses to the tribulations of the time, and all of them include exhortations to stand fast in their religious beliefs. Some, such as the "[[Denkard]]", are doctrinal defenses of the religion, while others are explanations of theological aspects (such as the [[Bundahishn]]'s) or practical aspects (e.g., explanation of rituals) of it. About sixty such works are known to have existed, of which some are known only from references to them in other works.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

[[File:Museum of Zoroastrians - Kerman.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Museum of Zoroastrians in [[Kerman]]]]
In [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] in the northeastern Iran, a 10th-century Iranian nobleman brought together four Zoroastrian priests to transcribe a Sassanid-era Middle Persian work titled ''Book of the Lord'' (''Khwaday Namag'') from Pahlavi script into Arabic script. This transcription, which remained in Middle Persian prose (an Arabic version, by [[Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa|al-Muqaffa]], also exists), was completed in 957 and subsequently became the basis&lt;!-- so Boyce 159 --&gt; for [[Firdausi]]'s ''[[Shahnameh|Book of Kings]]''. It became enormously popular among both Zoroastrians and Muslims, and also served to propagate the Sassanid justification for overthrowing the Arsacids (i.e., that the Sassanids had restored the faith to its "orthodox" form after the Hellenistic Arsacids had allowed Zoroastrianism to become corrupt).

Among migrations were those to cities in (or on the margins of) the great salt deserts, in particular to [[Yazd]] and [[Kerman]], which remain centers of Iranian Zoroastrianism to this day. Yazd became the seat of the Iranian high priests during [[Ilkhanate|Mongol Il-Khanate]] rule, when the "best hope for survival [for a non-Muslim] was to be inconspicuous."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1979_163"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1979|p=163}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Crucial to the present-day survival of Zoroastrianism was a migration from the northeastern Iranian town of [[Sanjan (Khorasan)|"Sanjan in south&lt;!-- hyphen--&gt;-&lt;!--per literal quote--&gt;western Khorasan"]],&lt;ref name="Boyce_1979_157"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1979|p=157}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Gujarat]], in western [[India]]. The descendants of that group are today known as the ''[[Parsi]]s''—"as the [[Gujarati people|Gujaratis]], from long tradition, called anyone from Iran"&lt;ref name="Boyce_1979_157"/&gt;—who today represent the larger of the two groups of Zoroastrians.

The struggle between Zoroastrianism and Islam declined in the 10th and 11th centuries. Local Iranian dynasties, "all vigorously Muslim,"&lt;ref name="Boyce_1979_157"/&gt; had emerged as largely independent [[vassals]] of the Caliphs. In the 16th century, in one of the early letters between Iranian Zoroastrians and their co-religionists in India, the priests of [[Yazd]] lamented that "no period [in human history], not even [[Hellenistic period|that of Alexander]], had been more grievous or troublesome for the faithful than 'this millennium of the [[Aeshma|demon of &lt;!--caps cause hypostasis--&gt;Wrath&lt;!-- and because this is a literal quotation--&gt;]]'."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1979_175"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1979|p=175}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoroastrianism has survived into the modern period, particularly in India, where it has been present since about the 9th century.

Today Zoroastrianism can be divided in three different sects or dominions: restorationists, progressives and traditionalists (or isolationists). Traditionalists or isolationists are almost solely [[Parsi]]s and accept, beside the Gathas and Avesta, also the [[Middle Persian]] works called 'Nasks of the Sassanians'. They generally do not allow [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to the faith. Therefore, for someone to be a Zoroastrian, they must be born of Zoroastrian parents. Some traditionalists recognize the children of mixed marriages as Zoroastrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/conversion-vii |title=CONVERSION vii. Zoroastrian faith in mod. per. – Encyclopaedia Iranica |website=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 19th century onward, the Parsis gained a reputation for their education and widespread influence in all aspects of society.
They played an instrumental role in the economic development of the region over many decades; several of the best-known business conglomerates of India are run by Parsi-Zoroastrians, including [[Tata Group|Tata]], [[Godrej family|Godrej]], [[Wadia]] families, and others.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Though the Armenians share a rich history affiliated with Zoroastrianism (that eventually declined with the advent of Christianity), reports indicate that there were [[Zoroastrianism in Armenia|Zoroastrian Armenians]] in [[Armenia]] until the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Sofie Roald, Anh Nga Longva. [https://books.google.nl/books?id=Ab0yAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA313&amp;dq=armenians+were+zoroastrian&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBWoVChMI49KPt6KSxgIVAo4sCh1evgDN#v=onepage&amp;q=armenians%20were%20zoroastrian&amp;f=false ''Religious Minorities in the Middle East: Domination, Self-Empowerment, Accommodation''] BRILL, 11 November 2011, {{ISBN|9004216847}}, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

A comparatively minor population persisted in Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Persia, and an expatriate community has formed in the United States (some from India), and to a lesser extent in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. Many of these are titled restorationists, progressives or "reformists". Progressives generally accept the [[Yashts]] and the [[Visperad]] texts of the [[Avesta]] as obligatory, along with the [[Gathas]]. Restorationists refer only to the compositions of Zoroaster, and thus only consider the [[Gathas]], the other texts only having value as far as they elaborate on some Gathic point and do not contradict the Gathic teaching.

At the request of the government of [[Tajikistan]], [[UNESCO]] declared 2003 a year to celebrate the "3000th anniversary of Zoroastrian culture", with special events throughout the world.

===Indo-Iranian origins===
{{See also|Indo-Iranians|Proto-Indo-Iranian religion|Proto-Indo-European religion}}
The religion of Zoroastrianism is closest to Vedic religion. Some historians believe that Zoroastrianism, along with similar philosophical revolutions in South Asia were interconnected strings of reformation against a common Indo-Aryan thread. Many traits of Zoroastrianism can be traced back to the culture and beliefs of the prehistorical Indo-Iranian period, that is, to the time before the migrations that led to the [[Indo-Aryans]] and [[Iranian peoples|Iranics]] becoming distinct peoples. Zoroastrianism consequently shares elements with the [[historical Vedic religion]] that also has its origins in that era. An example is the relation of the Avestan word ''Ahura'' ("[[Ahura Mazda]]") and the Vedic Sanskrit word ''[[Asura]]'' ("demon; evil demigod"), and ''[[Daeva]]'' ("demon") and ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]'' ("god"). They are descended from a common [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion]]. Vedic religious texts are replete with people from far flung countries practising or leaving Aryan teachings.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Manichaeism===
Zoroastrianism is often compared with [[Manichaeism]]. Nominally an Iranian religion, it has its origins in [[Middle-East]]ern [[Gnosticism]]. Superficially such a comparison seems apt, as both are dualistic and Manichaeism adopted many of the [[Yazata]]s for its own pantheon. Gherardo Gnoli, in ''The Encyclopaedia of Religion'',&lt;ref&gt;Gherardo Gnoli, “Manichaeism: An Overview”, in ''Encyclopedia of Religion'', ed. Mircea Eliade (NY: MacMillan Library Reference USA, 1987), 9: 165.&lt;/ref&gt; says that "we can assert that Manichaeism has its roots in the Iranian religious tradition and that its relationship to Mazdaism, or Zoroastrianism, is more or less like that of Christianity to Judaism".&lt;ref name="Henning"&gt;Contrast with Henning's observations: Henning, W.B., ''The Book of Giants'', BSOAS, Vol. XI, Part 1, 1943, pp. 52–74:
{{quote|It is noteworthy that Mani, who was brought up and spent most of his life in a province of the Persian empire, and whose mother belonged to a famous Parthian family, did not make any use of the Iranian mythological tradition. There can no longer be any doubt that the Iranian names of Sām, Narīmān, etc., that appear in the Persian and Sogdian versions of the Book of the Giants, did not figure in the original edition, written by Mani in the Syriac language}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are however quite different.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zaehner|1956|pp=53–54}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Manichaeism equated evil with matter and good with spirit, and was therefore particularly suitable as a doctrinal basis for every form of asceticism and many forms of mysticism. Zoroastrianism, on the other hand, rejects every form of asceticism, has no dualism of matter and spirit (only of good and evil), and sees the spiritual world as not very different from the natural one (the word "paradise", or ''pairi.daeza'', applies equally to both.)

Manichaeism's basic doctrine was that the world and all corporeal bodies were constructed from the substance of Satan, an idea that is fundamentally at odds with the Zoroastrian notion of a world that was created by God and that is all good, and any corruption of it is an effect of the bad. From what may be inferred from many Manichean texts and a few Zoroastrian sources{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}, the adherents of the two religions (or at least their respective priesthoods) despised each other intensely.

===Present-day Iran===
Many aspects of Zoroastrianism are present in the culture and mythologies of the peoples of the [[Greater Iran]], not least because Zoroastrianism was a dominant influence on the people of the cultural continent for a thousand years. Even after the rise of Islam and the loss of direct influence, Zoroastrianism remained part of the cultural heritage of the [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]]-speaking world, in part as festivals and customs, but also because [[Ferdowsi]] incorporated a number of the figures and stories from the [[Avesta]] in his epic ''[[Shahnameh|Shāhnāme]]'', which in turn is pivotal to Iranian identity.

==Religious text==

===Avestan===
{{Main|Avesta|Avestan language}}
The Avesta is the religious book of Zoroastrians that contains a collection of sacred texts. The history of the Avesta is found in many [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi texts]]. According to tradition, [[Ahura Mazda]] created the twenty-one nasks which [[Zoroaster]] brought to [[Vishtaspa]]. Here, two copies were created, one which was put in the house of archives, and the other put in the Imperial treasury. During Alexander's conquest of Persia, the Avesta was burned, and the scientific sections that the Greeks could use were dispersed among themselves.

Under the reign of King Valax of the [[Arsacid Dynasty of Parthia|Arsacis Dynasty]], an attempt was made to restore the Avesta. During the [[Sassanid Empire]], Ardeshir ordered Tansar, [[Dastur|his high priest]], to finish the work that King Valax had started. [[Shapur I]] sent priests to locate the scientific text portions of the Avesta that were in the possession of the Greeks. Under [[Shapur II]], Arderbad Mahrespandand revised the canon to ensure its orthodox character, while under [[Khosrow I]], the Avesta was translated into Pahlavi.

The compilation of these ancient texts was successfully established underneath the Mazdean priesthood and the Sassanian emperors. Only a fraction of the texts survive today. The later manuscripts all date from this millennium, the latest being from 1288, 590 years after the fall of the Sassanian Empire. The texts that remain today are the [[Gathas]], [[Yasna]], [[Visperad]] and the [[Vendidad]]. Along with these texts is the communal household prayer book called the [[Khordeh Avesta]], which contains the [[Yasht]]s and the Siroza. The rest of the materials from the Avesta are called "Avestan fragments".{{sfn|Bromiley|1995|p=124}}

===Middle Persian/Pahlavi===
Middle Persian and Pahlavi works created in the 9th and 10th century contain many religious Zoroastrian books, as most of the writers and copyists were part of the Zoroastrian clergy. The most significant and important books of this era include the [[Denkard]], [[Bundahishn]], [[Menog-i Khrad]], Selections of Zadspram, [[Jamasp Namag]], Epistles of Manucher, [[Rivayat]]s, Dadestan-i-Denig, and [[Arda Viraf Namag]]. All Middle Persian texts written on Zoroastrianism during this time period are considered secondary works on the religion, and not [[scripture]]. Nonetheless, these texts have a strong influence on the religion.

==Zoroaster==
{{Main|Zoroaster}}
Zoroastrianism was founded by Zoroaster (or Zarathustra), later deemed a prophet, in ancient Iran. The precise date of the founding of Zoroastrianism is uncertain.
Zoroaster was born in either Northeast Iran or Southwest Afghanistan. He was born into a culture with a [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religion, which included [[animal sacrifice]]&lt;ref&gt;Boyce (1979), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; and the ritual use of intoxicants, quite similar to early forms of [[Hinduism]] in India. Zoroaster's birth and early life are little documented. What is known is recorded in the [[Gathas]]—the core of the Avesta, which contains hymns thought to be composed by Zoroaster himself. Born into the [[Spitama]] clan, he worked as a priest. He had a wife, three sons, and three daughters.

Zoroaster rejected the religion of the Bronze Age Iranians, with their many gods and oppressive [[Caste system|class structure]], in which the Karvis and Karapans (princes and priests) controlled the ordinary people. He also opposed animal sacrifices and the use of the [[hallucinogenic]] [[Haoma]] plant (possibly a species of [[Ephedra (genus)|ephedra]]) in rituals, but held the rooster as a "symbol of light"&lt;ref&gt;The Heretic's Feast: A History of Vegetarianism By Colin Spencer – May 15, 1995 page 60&lt;/ref&gt; and associated it with "good against evil"&lt;ref&gt;The Heretic's Feast: A History of Vegetarianism By Colin Spencer – May 15, 1995 – page 60&lt;/ref&gt; because of his heraldic actions.

===Vision of Zoroaster===
According to Zoroastrian belief, when Zoroaster was 30 years old, he went into the Daiti river to draw water for a [[Haoma]] ceremony; when he emerged, he received a vision of [[Vohu Manah]]. After this, Vohu Manah took him to the other six Amesha Spentas, where he received the completion of his vision.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce (1979), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; This vision radically transformed his view of the world, and he tried to teach this view to others. Zoroaster believed in one creator God, teaching that only one God was worthy of worship. Some of the deities of the old religion, the ''[[Daevas]]'' (''Devas'' in Sanskrit), appeared to delight in war and strife. Zoroaster said these were evil spirits, workers of Angra Mainyu.

Zoroaster's ideas were not taken up quickly; he originally only had one convert: his cousin Maidhyoimanha.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce (1979), pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; The local religious authorities opposed his ideas, considering that their faith, power, and particularly their rituals, were threatened by Zoroaster's teaching against over-ritualising religious ceremonies. Many did not like Zoroaster's downgrading of the Daevas to evil spirits. After 12 years of little success, Zoroaster left his home.

In the country of King [[Vishtaspa]] in [[Bactria]], the king and queen heard Zoroaster debating with the religious leaders of the land and decided to accept Zoroaster's ideas as the official religion of their kingdom. Zoroaster died in his late 70s. Very little is known of the time between Zoroaster and the [[Achaemenian]] period, except that Zoroastrianism spread to Western Iran. By the time of the founding of the Achaemenid Empire, Zoroastrianism was already a well-established religion.

==Principal beliefs==
Humata, Hukhta, Huvarshta (Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds) are the basic tenets of the religion.

[[File:Faravahar.svg|thumb|right|[[Faravahar]] (or Ferohar), one of the primary symbols of Zoroastrianism, believed to be the depiction of a ''Fravashi'' (guardian spirit)|right]]
In Zoroastrianism, [[Ahura Mazda]] is the beginning and the end, the creator of everything that can and cannot be seen, the Eternal, the Pure and the only Truth. In the [[Gathas]], the most sacred texts of Zoroastrianism thought to have been composed by Zoroaster himself, the prophet acknowledged devotion to no other divinity besides Ahura Mazda.

''[[Daena]]'' (''din'' in modern [[Persian language|Persian]]) is the eternal Law, whose order was revealed to humanity through the ''Mathra-Spenta'' ("Holy Words"). ''Daena'' has been used to mean religion, faith, law, and even as a translation for the Hindu and [[Buddhist]] term [[Dharma]], to which it is related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morreall |first1=John |last2=Sonn |first2=Tamara |title=The Religion Toolkit: A Complete Guide to Religious Studies |date=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781444343717 |page=324 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aM461tmUDe4C&amp;pg=PT324 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is often interpreted as "duty" but can also mean social order, right conduct, or virtue. The metaphor of the "path" of ''Daena'' is represented in Zoroastrianism by the [[muslin]] undershirt ''Sudra'', the "Good/Holy Path", and the 72-thread ''[[Kushti]]'' girdle, the "Pathfinder".

''Daena'' should not be confused with the fundamental principle ''[[asha]]'' (Vedic ''rta''), the equitable law of the universe, which governed the life of the ancient Indo-Iranians. For these, ''asha'' was the course of everything observable—the motion of the planets and astral bodies; the progression of the seasons; and the pattern of daily nomadic herdsman life, governed by regular metronomic events such as sunrise and sunset.

All physical creation (''geti'') was thus determined to run according to a master plan—inherent to Ahura Mazda—and violations of the order (''druj'') were violations against creation, and thus violations against Ahura Mazda. This concept of ''asha'' versus the ''druj'' should not be confused with the good-versus-evil battle evident in western religions, for although both forms of opposition express moral conflict, the ''asha'' versus ''druj'' concept is more systemic and less personal, representing, for instance, chaos (that opposes order); or "uncreation", evident as natural decay (that opposes creation); or more simply "the lie" (that opposes truth and righteousness). Moreover, in his role as the one uncreated creator of all, Ahura Mazda is not the creator of ''druj'', which is "nothing", anti-creation, and thus (likewise) uncreated. Thus, in Zoroaster's revelation, Ahura Mazda was perceived to be the creator of only the good (Yasna 31.4), the "supreme benevolent providence" (Yasna 43.11), that will ultimately triumph (Yasna 48.1).
[[File:Parsee Wedding 1905.jpg|thumb|left|A ''[[Parsi people|Parsi]]'' Wedding, 1905]]

In this [[Model (abstract)|schema]] of ''asha'' versus ''druj'', mortal beings (both humans and animals) play a critical role, for they too are created. Here, in their lives, they are active participants in the conflict, and it is their ''duty'' to defend order, which would decay without counter''action''. Throughout the [[Gathas]], Zoroaster emphasizes deeds and actions, and accordingly [[asceticism]] is frowned upon in Zoroastrianism. In later Zoroastrianism, this was explained as fleeing from the experiences of life, which was the very purpose that the ''urvan'' (most commonly translated as the "soul") was sent into the mortal world to collect. The avoidance of any aspect of life, which includes the avoidance of the pleasures of life, is a shirking of the responsibility and duty to oneself, one's ''urvan'', and one's family and social obligations.

Central to Zoroastrianism is the emphasis on moral choice, to choose the responsibility and duty for which one is in the mortal world, or to give up this duty and so facilitate the work of ''druj''. Similarly, [[predestination]] is rejected in Zoroastrian teaching. Humans bear responsibility for all situations they are in, and in the way they act toward one another. Reward, punishment, happiness, and grief all depend on how individuals live their lives.&lt;ref name=Cavendish/&gt;

In Zoroastrianism, good transpires for those who do righteous deeds. Those who do evil have themselves to blame for their ruin. Zoroastrian morality is then to be summed up in the simple phrase, "good thoughts, good words, good deeds" (''Humata'', ''Hukhta'', ''Hvarshta'' in [[Avestan language|Avestan]]), for it is through these that ''asha'' is maintained and ''druj'' is kept in check.

Through accumulation, several other beliefs were introduced to the religion that, in some instances, supersede those expressed in the [[Gathas]]. In the late 19th century, the moral and immoral forces came to be represented by ''[[Spenta Mainyu]]'' and its [[antithesis]] ''[[Angra Mainyu]]'', the "good spirit" and "evil spirit" emanations of Ahura Mazda, respectively. Although the names are old, this opposition is a modern Western-influenced development popularized by [[Martin Haug]] in the 1880s, and was, in effect, a realignment of the precepts of [[Zurvanism]] (Zurvanite Zoroastrianism), which had postulated a ''third'' deity, ''Zurvan'', to explain a mention of twinship (''Yasna'' 30.3) between the moral and immoral. Although Zurvanism had died out by the 10th century, the critical question of the "twin brothers" mentioned in ''Yasna'' 30.3 remained, and Haug's explanation provided a convenient defence against Christian missionaries, who disparaged the Parsis for their "[[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]]". Haug's concept was subsequently disseminated as a Parsi interpretation, thus corroborating Haug's theory, and the idea became so popular that it is now almost universally accepted as doctrine.{{Citation needed|reason=Nov 2009|date=November 2009}}

Zoroastrianism developed the abstract concepts of heaven and hell, as well as personal and final judgment, all of which are only alluded to in the [[Gathas]]. ''Yasna'' 19, which has only survived in a [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid era]] (&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;–650 CE&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''Zend'' commentary on the ''[[Ahuna Vairya]]'' invocation), prescribes a Path to [[Judgment]] known as the ''Chinvat Peretum'' or ''[[Chinvat bridge]]'' (''cf:'' [[As-Sirāt]] in Islam), which all souls had to cross, and judgment (over thoughts, words, and deeds performed during a lifetime) was passed as they were doing so. However, the Zoroastrian personal judgment is not final. At the end of time, when evil is finally defeated, all souls will be ultimately reunited with their [[Fravashi]]. Thus, Zoroastrianism can be said to be a [[Universalism|universalist]] religion with respect to salvation.

In addition, and strongly influenced by [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] and [[Babylonia]]n practices, the Achaemenids popularized [[shrines]] and temples, hitherto alien forms of worship. In the wake of Achaemenid expansion, shrines were constructed throughout the empire and particularly influenced the role of [[Mithra]], [[Aredvi Sura Anahita]], [[Verethragna]] and [[Tishtrya]], all of which, in addition to their original (proto-)Indo-Iranian functions, now also received Perso-Babylonian functions.

===Creation of the universe===
According to the Zoroastrian [[creation myth]], [[Ahura Mazda]] existed in light and goodness above, while [[Angra Mainyu]] existed in darkness and ignorance below. They have existed independently of each other for all time, and manifest contrary substances. Ahura Mazda first created seven abstract heavenly beings called ''[[Amesha Spenta]]s'', who support him and represent beneficent aspects, along with numerous ''yazads'', lesser beings worthy of worship. He then created the universe itself in order to ensnare evil. Ahura Mazda created the floating, egg-shaped universe in two parts: first the spiritual (''menog'') and 3,000 years later, the physical (''getig''). Ahura Mazda then created [[Keyumars|Gayomard]], the archetypical perfect man, and the first bull.&lt;ref name=Cavendish&gt;{{Citation|title=Mythology: an Illustrated Encyclopedia |pages=40–45 |first1=Richard |last1=Cavendish |first2=Trevor Oswald |last2=Ling |publisher=Rizzoli |year=1980 |isbn=0847802868 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GdEnAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Ahura Mazda created the universe and humankind, Angra Mainyu, whose instinct is to destroy, miscreated demons, evil ''yazads'', and noxious creatures (''khrafstar'') such as snakes, ants, and flies. Angra Mainyu created an opposite, evil being for each good being, except for humans, which he found he could not match. Angra Mainyu invaded the universe through the base of the sky, inflicting [[Keyumars|Gayomard]] and the bull with suffering and death. However, the evil forces were trapped in the universe and could not retreat. The dying primordial man and bull emitted seeds. From the bull's seed grew all beneficial plants and animals of the world, and from the man's seed grew a plant whose leaves became the first human couple. Humans thus struggle in a two-fold universe trapped with evil. The evils of this physical world are not products of an inherent weakness, but are the fault of Angra Mainyu's assault on creation. This assault turned the perfectly flat, peaceful, and ever day-lit world into a mountainous, violent place that is half night.&lt;ref name=Cavendish/&gt;

===Renovation and judgment===
{{main|Frashokereti}}
Zoroastrianism also includes beliefs about the [[eschatology|renovation of the world]] and individual judgment (cf. [[general judgment|general]] and [[particular judgment]]), including the [[resurrection of the dead]].

Individual judgment at death is by the [[Chinvat Bridge|Bridge of Judgment]], which each human must cross, facing a spiritual judgment. Humans' actions under their free will determine the outcome. One is either greeted at the bridge by a beautiful, sweet-smelling maiden or by an ugly, foul-smelling old woman. The maiden leads the dead safely across the bridge to the [[Amesha Spenta]] Good Mind, who carries the dead to paradise. The old woman leads the dead down a bridge that narrows until the departed falls off into the abyss of hell.&lt;ref name=Cavendish/&gt;

Zoroastrian hell is reformative; punishments fit the crimes, and souls do not rest in eternal damnation. Hell contains foul smells and evil food, and souls are packed tightly together although they believe they are in total isolation.&lt;ref name=Cavendish/&gt;

In [[Frashokereti|Zoroastrian eschatology]], a 3,000-year struggle between good and evil will be fought, punctuated by evil's final assault. During the final assault, the sun and moon will darken and humankind will lose its reverence for religion, family, and elders. The world will fall into winter, and Angra Mainyu's most fearsome miscreant, [[Azi Dahaka]], will break free and terrorize the world.&lt;ref name=Cavendish/&gt;

The final savior of the world, [[Saoshyant]], will be born to a virgin impregnated by the seed of Zoroaster while bathing in a lake. Saoshyant will raise the dead – including those in both heaven and hell – for final judgment, returning the wicked to hell to be purged of bodily sin. Next, all will wade through a river of molten metal in which the righteous will not burn. Heavenly forces will ultimately triumph over evil, rendering it forever impotent. Saoshyant and Ahura Mazda will offer a bull as a final sacrifice for all time, and all humans will become immortal. Mountains will again flatten and valleys will rise; heaven will descend to the moon, and the earth will rise to meet them both.&lt;ref name=Cavendish/&gt;

Humanity requires two judgments because there are as many aspects to our being: spiritual (''menog'') and physical (''getig'').&lt;ref name=Cavendish/&gt;

===Head covering===
The Zarathushtri also practice traditional head covering ritual similar to that of Judaism. It is vital to the practice, and according to Hoshang Bhadha,{{year needed|date=November 2014}}{{unreliable source?|date=November 2014}}
{{quotation|A Zarathustri is enjoined to cover his head at all times. It is one of the basic disciplines for a Zarathustri. If you have ever looked at the pictures of Zarathustris from the past, you will recognize them simply because they were wearing cap or turban covering their head. If you read the description of Parsees from the past... it is emphatically described that whether a child, female or male they all had their head(s) covered. It is unfortunate that our own community people laugh on us for wearing cap, which is the foundation of all our religion practices. Needless to say, today a Zarathustri wearing cap will get strange glances; he/she will evoke giggles and some people even consider them as one belonging to the Stone Age. However, such reactions are seldom seen when a Zarathustri will observe a Muslim or Jew demonstrating their practice of covering head during and out of their prayer area. It is a common sight to see a Zarathustri coming out from the Agiary with one hand over his head, not as a respect but to prepare himself/ herself to remove the cap/scarf before he/she reaches the main gate. Some people feel embarrassed to wear in public whereas some remove it to protect their hairstyle. My dear Zarathustris, wearing cap is not imposed upon us but it is a remedy to protect oneself from destructive thought process[es]...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/topi33.html |title=Effect of Wearing Cap on Zarathustri Urvaan: by Ervad (Dr.) Hoshang J.

{{further|List of countries by Zoroastrian population|List of Zoroastrians}}
Zoroastrian communities comprise two main groups of people: those of [[South Asian]] Zoroastrian background known as [[Parsi people|Parsis]] (or Parsees), and those of Central Asian background. &lt;!-- What about the original communities in Iran/ Western Asia? --&gt;According to a survey in 2004 by the Zoroastrian Associations of North America, the number of Zoroastrians worldwide was estimated at between 124,000 and 190,000. The number is imprecise because of wildly diverging counts in Iran.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/06/us/06faith.html|title=Zoroastrians Keep the Faith, and Keep Dwindling|publisher=The New York Times|date=2008-09-06|accessdate=2009-10-03 | first=Laurie | last=Goodstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's 2011 Census found 57,264 Parsi Zoroastrians.&lt;ref name=pti&gt;{{Citation | title=Parsi population dips by 22 per cent between 2001–2011: study | url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Parsi-population-dips-by-22-per-cent-between-2001-2011-study/article14508859.ece | publisher=PTI | date=2016-07-26 | accessdate=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small Zoroastrian communities may be found all over the world, with a continuing concentration in Western India, Central Iran, and Southern Pakistan. Zoroastrians of the [[diaspora]] are primarily located in [[Great Britain]] and the former British colonies, particularly [[Canada]] and [[Australia]], as well as in the [[United States|American]] state of [[California]] where they form part of the [[Iranian American]] community.

===In South Asia===
{{Main|Parsi|Irani (India)}}
[[File:Parsi-navjote-sitting.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Parsi people|Parsi]] ''[[Navjote]]'' ceremony (rites of admission into the Zoroastrian faith)]]
India is considered to be home to the largest Zoroastrian population in the world. When the Islamic armies, under the first Caliphs, invaded Persia, those locals who were unwilling to convert to Islam sought refuge, first in the mountains of Northern Iran, then the regions of Yazd and its surrounding villages. Later, in the ninth century CE, a group sought refuge in the western coastal region of India, and also scattered to other regions of the world.
Following the fall of the [[Sassanid Empire]] in 651 CE, many Zoroastrians migrated. Among them were several groups who ventured to [[Gujarat]] on the western shores of the [[Indian subcontinent]], where they finally settled. The descendants of those refugees are today known as the Parsis. The year of arrival on the subcontinent cannot be precisely established, and Parsi legend and tradition assigns various dates to the event.

In the Indian census of 2001, the Parsis numbered 69,601, representing about 0.006% of the total population of India, with a concentration in and around the city of [[Mumbai]]. Due to a low birth rate and high rate of [[emigration]], demographic trends project that by 2020 the Parsis will number only about 23,000 or 0.002% of the total population of India. The Parsis would then cease to be called a community and will be labeled a "tribe". By 2008, the birth-to-death ratio was 1:5; 200 births per year to 1,000 deaths.&lt;ref name="doomed"&gt;{{Citation | title=Doomed by faith | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/doomed-by--faith-856095.html | publisher=Guardian | date=2008-06-28 | accessdate=2008-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Pakistan]], they number fewer than 1,700, mostly living in [[Karachi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2012-11-28/parsi-community-karachi-pakistan|title=The Parsi Community in Karachi, Pakistan|work=Public Radio International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran, Iraq and Central Asia===
{{Main|Zoroastrians in Iran}}
Iran's figures of Zoroastrians have ranged widely; the last census (1974) before the [[Iranian Revolution|revolution of 1979]] revealed 21,400 Zoroastrians.&lt;ref name=hins&gt;{{cite web|author=K. E. Eduljee |url=http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/demographics/ |title=Zoroastrian Demographics &amp; Group Names |website=Heritageinstitute.com |date=2008-06-28 |accessdate=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some 10,000 adherents remain in the [[Central Asia]]n regions that were once considered the traditional stronghold of Zoroastrianism, i.e., [[Bactria]] (see also [[Balkh]]), which is in Northern Afghanistan; [[Sogdiana]]; [[Margiana]]; and other areas close to [[Zoroaster#Place|Zoroaster's homeland]].
In Iran, emigration, out-marriage and low birth rates are likewise leading to a decline in the Zoroastrian population. Zoroastrian groups in Iran say their number is approximately 60,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |author=U.S. State Department  | title = Iran – International Religious Freedom Report 2009  | publisher = The Office of Electronic Information, Bureau of Public Affair  | date = 2009-10-26  | url = https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127347.htm  | accessdate = 2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Iranian census data from 2011 the number of Zoroastrians in Iran was 25,271.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/census-iran-young-urbanised-and-educated |title=Census: Iran young, urbanised and educated |publisher=Egypt Independent |date=2012-07-29 |accessdate=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communities exist in [[Tehran]], as well as in [[Yazd]], [[Kerman]] and [[Kermanshah]], where many still speak an Iranian language distinct from the usual [[Persian language|Persian]]. They call their language [[Dari (Zoroastrian)|Dari]] (not to be confused with the [[Dari (Persian)|Dari of Afghanistan]]). Their language is also called ''Gavri'' or ''Behdini'', literally "of the Good Religion". Sometimes their language is named for the cities in which it is spoken, such as ''Yazdi'' or ''Kermani''. Iranian Zoroastrians were historically called [[Gabr|''Gabr''s]], originally without a pejorative connotation but in the present-day derogatorily applied to all non-Muslims.

More recently the Zoroastrian faith has gained strength among the [[Kurds]] in Iraq and claims to have 100,000 followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/020620153|title=Zoroastrian faith returns to Kurdistan in response to ISIS violence|publisher=Rudaw|date=2015-06-02|accessdate=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zoroastrians currently seek official status for their religion in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/02/iraq-kurdistan-religious-minorities-zoroastrianism.html|title=Zoroastrianism in Iraq seeks official recognition|publisher=Al-Monitor|date=2016-02-17|accessdate=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western world===
[[North America]] is thought to be home to 18,000–25,000 Zoroastrians of both [[South Asian]] and [[Iran]]ian background. A further 3,500 live in [[Australia]] (mainly in [[Sydney]]).
As of 2012, the population of Zoroastrians in USA was 15,000, making it the third largest Zoroastrian population in the World after those of India and Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.niacinsight.com/2016/12/16/an-old-faith-in-the-new-world-zoroastrianism-in-the-united-states/|title=An Old Faith in the New World - Zoroastrianism in the United States - NIAC inSight|first=Washington insights for the Iranian-American community from the National Iranian American Council|last=(NIAC).|website=www.niacinsight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
