The '''2008 Canadian listeriosis outbreak''' was a widespread outbreak of [[listeriosis]] in [[Canada]] linked to [[cold cuts]] from a [[Maple Leaf Foods]] plant in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. There were 57 total confirmed cases, resulting in 22 deaths.&lt;ref name="weatherill"&gt;{{cite news|last=Weatherill|first=S. |year=2009|title=Report of the Independent Investigator into the 2008 Listeriosis outbreak|work=Government of Canada|page=vii|url=http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2009/agr/A22-508-2009E.pdf|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and spread==
[[Image:Listeria monocytogenes PHIL 2287 lores.jpg|left|upright|thumb|''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'', the bacterium responsible for listeriosis]]
Listeriosis is an infection caused by the [[bacterium]] ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]''. The outbreak originated from lines 8 and 9 of the [[Maple Leaf Foods]] Bartor Road facility (Establishment No. 97B) in [[North York, Ontario]], a neighbourhood of Toronto. There were about 220 possibly contaminated products, each stamped with the code "97B" near the "Best before" date. Since the bacteria travelled through deli meats, which are cooked (and as a result are usually free of pathogens), the contamination likely occurred during packaging.&lt;ref&gt;

==Response from Maple Leaf Foods==
Maple Leaf Foods had instituted a voluntary recall before the outbreak was linked to their plant; upon confirming the link, they expanded the recall to all products from the Bartor Road facility. In a press conference, President and CEO of Maple Leaf Foods Michael McCain stated, "Tragically, our products have been linked to illness and loss of life. To those people who are ill, and to the families who have lost loved ones, I offer my deepest and sincerest sympathies. Words cannot begin to express our sadness for their pain."&lt;ref&gt;

Officials from Maple Leaf believe that the outbreak originated sometime in July on line 8 or line 9 of the North York facility. Regardless, the entire plant has undergone intense sanitation, which began August 21. About 80 workers were involved in the cleanup, with additional outside experts and microbiologists supervising the operation. They used [[peroxyacetic acid]], [[quaternary ammonium compound]], [[isopropyl alcohol]], refrigeration gel and a granular compound to disinfect the parts of the apparatuses. About 600 employees were to attend a four-hour training session on ''Listeria'' and on cleanliness, and about 250 employees were laid off while the plant was being cleaned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The recall reportedly cost the company $20 million, about ten times the original estimate.&lt;ref name="CBCaug25"&gt;

==Political responses==
Ontario Premier  [[Dalton McGuinty]] credited the discovery of the outbreak to an early-warning system implemented after the 2003 [[SARS]] outbreak in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On the federal political level, there was a debate on the [[privatization]] of food inspection.&lt;ref name = "GAMprivatization" /&gt; A cabinet document leaked earlier in the year outlined a plan to save money at the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] (CFIA) by shifting federal meat inspectors into an oversight role and leaving companies to implement their own methods. Liberal leader [[Stéphane Dion]] was harshly critical and drew comparisons to the 2000 [[Walkerton Tragedy|Walkerton tainted water tragedy]] and the privatization of propane inspection, which he blamed for the [[2008 Toronto explosions]]. Gerry Ritz responded that the CFIA had added 200 inspectors since the Conservatives came to power, adding, "As opposed to having our inspectors standing line by line, they'll have a more oversight role within the plant itself [...] We're trying to [[Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door|build a better mousetrap]] here."&lt;ref name = "GAMprivatization" /&gt; [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] agriculture critic [[Alex Atamanenko]] said he strongly opposed the apparent privatization plans.&lt;ref name = "GAMprivatization" /&gt;  The NDP claimed that policy changes first put in place by the Liberals and then continued under the Conservative government were to blame for the outbreak.

===Gerry Ritz comments===
On September 17, 2008, Agricultural Minister [[Gerry Ritz]] made national news when comments he made on an August 30, 2008 conference call with government officials were made public. Ritz was quoted as saying, "This is like a death by a thousand cuts. Or should I say cold cuts." Then, when told of a death in [[Prince Edward Island]], Ritz said, "Please tell me it's (Liberal MP) [[Wayne Easter]]." Ritz apologized for his remarks, but various groups called for his resignation. [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] Leader [[Jack Layton]] responded by saying, "Canadians are dying because of the mismanagement of our government... there should absolutely never be that kind of humour.... It illustrates the government is not taking this matter as seriously as they should." A spokesman for Prime Minister Harper released a statement saying Ritz's comments were tasteless and completely inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/ritz-sorry-for-tasteless-listeria-comments-1.325662|title=Ritz sorry for 'tasteless' Listeria comments|accessdate=16 October 2016 |publisher=CTV News |date=17 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Harper refused to seek Ritz's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Class-action lawsuits==
Four separate class-action lawsuits were filed in [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], [[Saskatchewan]], and [[British Columbia]]. The lawsuit in Ontario claimed damages of $350 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

All the cheques to claimants were mailed on the afternoon of February 3, 2012.

A court order for a "Pro Rata Reduction to all entitlements" was ordered, meaning that
all claims were delivered at 93.04% of the original agreement. Claimants had until August 1, 2012
to cash their cheques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''AFL Tribunal''' is the disciplinary [[tribunal]] of the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL), an [[Australian rules football]] competition. The Tribunal regulates the conduct of players, [[Umpire (Australian rules football)|umpires]], and other officials associated with the AFL and its clubs.

==Points system==

Prior to 2005, any player who was reported would face a hearing at the AFL Tribunal. This process had become problematic, and in 2005, a new system (similar to that used by the [[NRL Judiciary]] at the time) was adopted. The changes were primarily made to reduce the number of tribunal hearings, and to improve the consistency of penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mm.afl.com.au/Portals/0/afl_docs/Development/AFL%20Tribunal%20Booklet%202011-1.pdf |title=AFL Tribunal 2011 Guidebook|publisher=Australian Football League|year=2011|accessdate=2011-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930213942/http://mm.afl.com.au/Portals/0/afl_docs/Development/AFL%20Tribunal%20Booklet%202011-1.pdf |archivedate=30 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current tribunal process is as follows:

===Match Review Panel===
On-field umpires and certain off-field observers can report players for incidents which occur during games. On the Monday after the round of football, each incident is then reviewed by the Match Review Panel, a small panel of former players and umpires. Within the review, the Match Review Panel grades the severity of the incident in three factors, and awards ''activation points'' depending upon the severity. The three factors are:
{|
| style="width:300px" |
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|+Conduct
! Manner of action || Points
|-
| Intentional || 3
|-
| Reckless|| 2
|-
| Negligent || 1
|-
| Accidental or Incidental || ''Charge Rejected''
|}
| style="width:300px" |
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|+Impact
! {{tooltip|Degree of impact|The Match Review Panel can consider injury reports when assessing impact.}} || Points
|-
| Severe || 4
|-
| High || 3
|-
| Medium || 2
|-
| Low || 1

|}
| style="width:300px" |
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|+Contact
! Point of impact || Points
|-
| Head or Groin || 2
|-
| Elsewhere on Body || 1
|}
|}
{{Clear}}
The activation points from all three categories are added together to give the ''total activation points'' for the incident. It is important to note that an incident involving accidental/incidental conduct, or negligible impact, will be rejected and the player will receive no penalty, even if the activation points in the other categories are high. Because of this, any offence must rate at least three activation points to be considered further.

Next, activation points are converted into an offence ''level'':
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
! style="text-align:right;" | Activation Points
| style="width:40px;" | 3-4
| style="width:40px;" | 5 
| style="width:40px;" | 6
| style="width:40px;" | 7
| style="width:40px;" | 8
| style="width:40px;" | 9
|-
! style="text-align:right;" | Offence Level
| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || ''Ungraded''
|}
Next, the player is given a number of ''base demerit points'', based on the type and level of his offence. The base demerit point totals are standardised in the ''Table of Offences''. As an example, any player charged by the Match Review Panel with a Level 4 Kicking offence receives 550 base demerit points. This is where the Match Review Panel's role in the Tribunal process ends.

===Player response===
Following the Match Review Panel's findings, a player's base points are subjected to a series of ''additions'' and ''deductions'' (which are described in the next section) to arrive at a number of ''total demerit points''. Each 100 total demerit points that a player finishes with then corresponds to a suspension for one match; ''e.g.'' a player who finished with 225 demerit points will receive a two-match suspension. If a player finishes with fewer than 100 demerit points, he is not suspended, but receives what is known as a ''reprimand''.

Because the penalty is standardised and pre-announced by the Match Review Panel, the player has the option to plead guilty to the charge and receive his penalty without the need to attend a Tribunal hearing; he receives a ''deduction'' for doing this (see next section). Alternatively, a player may choose to appeal the findings of the Match Review Panel, and attend a Tribunal hearing to argue the case. Players may appeal to try to have their entire charge withdrawn, or may argue for a reduction in one of the three factors; ''e.g.'' a player could try to have the conduct factor reduced from reckless to negligent. Should a player successfully reduce the severity of his infraction, the penalty is re-evaluated and the player is again given the choice to plead guilty or further contest the revised charge.

If an incident is ungraded (''i.e.'' has nine activation points), the player is required to attend a tribunal hearing.

===Residuals, additions and deductions===
''Residuals'' (also called carry-over points) are any points a player may still have below the 100 required for a suspension. For every 100 points accrued, the player is suspended one week and the 100 points are subtracted; ''e.g.'', a player with 225 demerit points is suspended for two weeks; 200 points are correspondingly subtracted, and the remaining 25 are residual points; or, if a player receives a reprimand with 93.75 points, all of these points are residual as they are not enough to draw a suspension. Residual points from a previous offence will be added to the base demerit points of the player's next offence if it occurs within one year; a player's residual points are cancelled if a year elapses without a punishable offence.

A player with prior suspensions over the past two years is subject to an additional penalty known as ''loading''. For each week in excess of two that a player has been suspended over the past two years, he receives an additional penalty of 10% of the current offence's original base score, up to a maximum penalty of 50%; ''e.g.'' a player suspended for three matches will receive a 10% loading, while one suspended for seven matches will receive a 50% loading. (Prior to 2013, the relevant period was three years, and loading began with the first match suspended.)

Any player with more than six years (increased in 2013, previously five years) experience who has not been found guilty of a punishable offence over the previous five years receives a 25% deduction.

Any reportable offence that occurs during a [[AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] match will receive an addition called the ''double penalty'': equal to the offence's original base score as determined by the Match Review Panel. This addition is applied after the additions and deductions previously mentioned. This loading is meant to discourage excessively rough play encouraged because any penalties given as a result would not apply until the following season. A rough fight in the [[2004 AFL Grand Final]] between [[Alastair Lynch]] and [[Darryl Wakelin]] resulted in the Tribunal handing down stiff penalties and adding the double penalty rule.

Finally, players will receive a 25% deduction by accepting the Match Review Panel's finding without contest; this is typically known as an ''early guilty plea''. As a result of this rule, players are often faced with the option of accepting a shorter suspension with an early plea, or contesting the charge and risking a longer suspension if unsuccessful. Note that if a player contests the match review panel's assessment at the Tribunal, and successfully has the number of base demerit points changed, the penalty is re-evaluated, meaning the player, in spite of attending a hearing, can still take an early guilty plea on the revised charge.

The final offence score is thus calculated from this series of discrete steps:
* Residual (from prior offence(s))
* Base Score (from Match Review Panel)
* Loading (for poor record)
* Good Record Deduction
* Double Penalty (for a Grand Final offence)
* Early Guilty Plea Deduction
Each addition or deduction is made to the final result of the previous calculation step.

===Offences attracting financial penalties===
The Match Review Panel also assesses a variety of offences for which players are fined but not suspended, including wrestling, negligent contact with an umpire, making an obscene gesture, etc. As for physical offences, there is a standardised table of penalties, which depend upon the nature of the offence, and any prior similar offences; ''e.g.'' a player's second wrestling offence attracts double the penalty of his first. As for physical offences, a player can accept his penalty with an early guilty plea, receiving a 25% reduction in his fine, or he may contest it and risk the full penalty.

===Appeals Board===
If a player wishes to appeal against a decision handed down in a tribunal hearing, he may take his case to the AFL Appeals Board. The board will re-hear the case, with a different set of panel members, and may uphold or change the Tribunal's original decision. The Appeals Board was established in 1998 following a recommendation from Justice John Hedigan of the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]], after several tribunal findings were appealed through the Victorian court system during the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="law1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law4u.com.au/footylaw/footy_law_shearing.html |title=The Supreme Court Hearing |accessdate=30 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219144555/http://www.law4u.com.au/footylaw/footy_law_shearing.html |archivedate=19 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deregistration===
As of May 2011, under the official AFL Deregistration Policy, any player who accumulates a total of at least 10 weeks of suspensions over the course of his football career (both inside and outside the AFL) receives a formal notice that further suspensions can result in his automatic deregistration from the league. Any player who accumulates a total of at least 16 weeks of suspensions over the course of his career will be automatically deregistered from the AFL and barred from any further participation. Any previous suspensions within the AFL are carried over at only half their original length (e.g. a previous suspension of four weeks will only count as two weeks under this policy), but any immediate suspension is to be considered at its full length. If a player receives an immediate first suspension of at least 16 weeks, deregistration is left to the discretion of the League.

A deregistered player may apply for an exemption to re-register or appeal the deregistration under the appropriate laws of the league. However, only one request can be made. Should a player be exempted and re-registered, any further suspension will result in permanent, irrevocable deregistation.&lt;ref name="dereg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingpulse.com/get_file.cgi?id=2120089|title=AFL National Deregistration Policy, May 2011|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deregistration is only practiced in country or suburban football competitions; it is not practiced by the AFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Warner|first1=Michael|title=AFL says it has no plans to implement a life ban as used in local footy|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/more-news/afl-says-it-has-no-plans-to-implement-a-life-ban-as-used-in-local-footy/news-story/e7f39fc0362569cf15d9073d00a4417b|website=Herald Sun|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an AFL spokesperson, the deregistration policy was designed for serial aggressive offenders, not low-level repeat offenders, and that the AFL did not believe there has been a repeat offender issue at AFL level over the last 20 years where a player has been getting repeated, long suspensions for repeated behind-play offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Warner|first1=Michael|title=AFL says it has no plans to implement a life ban as used in local footy|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/more-news/afl-says-it-has-no-plans-to-implement-a-life-ban-as-used-in-local-footy/news-story/e7f39fc0362569cf15d9073d00a4417b|website=Herald Sun|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since the overhaul, the heaviest suspension for a single offence has been eight weeks, handed out to [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]]'s [[Dean Solomon]] for elbowing [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]]'s [[Cameron Ling]] in [[2008 AFL season#Round 15|round 15 of the 2008 season]], and to {{AFL WC}}'s [[Andrew Gaff]] for striking {{AFL Fre}}'s [[Andrew Brayshaw]] in [[2018 AFL season#Round 20|round 20 of the 2018 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2018-08-07/afl-tribunal-hands-down-gaff-verdict|title=Tribunal hands down Gaff verdict|publisher=AFL.com.au|first=Riley|last=Beveridge|date=7 August 2018|accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Round 4, 2008 [[Barry Hall]] of the [[Sydney Swans]] was suspended for seven matches after striking [[West Coast Eagles|West Coast's]] [[Brent Staker]]. 

In 2007, [[Steven Baker (Australian footballer)|Steven Baker]] of St Kilda was suspended for seven matches for rough conduct on [[Jeff Farmer (footballer)|Jeff Farmer]] (although the base suspension was only four weeks, with residual points and a significant loading due to his poor record his penalty increased to seven).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22285614-661,00.html | work=Herald Sun | title=Steven Baker suspended for seven weeks | date=21 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest suspension was handed out in June 2010, [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda's]] [[Steven Baker (Australian footballer)|Steven Baker]] was suspended for a total of nine weeks after he pleaded guilty to three striking charges and was found guilty of a misconduct charge, all against [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]]'s [[Steve Johnson (Australian footballer)|Steve Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;Paton, Al (29 June 2010) [http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/cats-accept-steve-johnson-cameron-mooney-bans/story-e6frf9jf-1225885664182 St Kilda's Steven Baker rubbed out for nine weeks after misconduct appeal fails at tribunal]; [[Herald Sun]]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the first person to be charged with misconduct for interfering with an injured opponent.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Bruce (29 June 2010) [http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/afl/saint-nicks-rule-traps-steven-baker/story-e6frepf6-1225885429768 Saint Nick's rule traps Steven Baker]; Herald Sun&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, the AFL challenged the tribunal's verdict for the first time in history, following an off-the-ball incident involving {{AFL Ric}} player [[Bachar Houli]] and {{AFL Car}}'s [[Jed Lamb]]: Houli was originally given a two-week suspension for striking Lamb during the first quarter of the Round 14 match at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]. Houli was reported for the incident, which saw Lamb sit out the remainder of the match, and sent straight to the tribunal the following day. When his case went before the tribunal that week, he was given the two-week suspension, but part of the reason the penalty was low was due to character reference statements given by [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Malcolm Turnbull]] and media personality [[Waleed Aly]]. Following an announcement of the penalty, there was a public outcry about the length of the suspension. The following day the AFL announced they would challenge the decision, and the matter would be heard in front of the appeals tribunal. Following an extensive review hearing, Houli's suspension was doubled from two weeks to four weeks.

In June 2018, {{AFL GWS}} player [[Jeremy Cameron]] became the first player in AFL history to be referred directly to the tribunal more than once in his career, where he was found guilty of striking [[Brisbane Lions]] player [[Harris Andrews]] and suspended for five matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theroar.com.au/2018/07/29/no-jezza-no-worries-giants/|title=No Jezza, no worries for the Giants|publisher=The Roar|date=29 July 2018|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/5569040/gaff-could-face-biggest-afl-ban-in-years/|title=Gaff could face biggest AFL ban in years|publisher=The Courier|first=Michael|last=Ramsey|date=6 August 2018|accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously been sent straight to the tribunal after breaking [[Rhys Mathieson]]'s jaw during a [[2016 NAB Challenge|pre-season match in 2016]], for which he was suspended for four matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news.com.au/sport/afl/brisbane-lions/brisbane-wont-hold-any-grudges-towards-jeremy-cameron-after-errant-elbow-on-harris-andrews/news-story/ec3b0e882f002eb8771b456b55ccbd88|title=Brisbane won’t hold any grudges towards Jeremy Cameron after errant elbow on Harris Andrews|publisher=news.com.au|date=26 June 2018|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Baxter was later exonerated on appeal due to mistaken identity. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Prior to 1926, some players found guilty of serious offences were given a lifetime suspension, but in each case the penalty was later commuted. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Cousins was suspended for a period of twelve months for "bringing the game into disrepute", equating to 22 matches. His old club, {{AFL WC}}, had deregistered him prior to his suspension, meaning he was not officially listed as a player at the time of his suspension.

One noteworthy suspension administered by the VFL Tribunal was that of John Bourke of the Collingwood Reserves team. In an outburst broadcast on Australian television on 4 May 1985, he kicked Sydney Swans ruckman Patrick Foy in the groin in response to Foy tagging him throughout the game. When umpire Phil Waight attempted to send Burke off for the incident, a visibly upset Burke shoved him to the ground and kicked him, struck the Collingwood runner, and then jumped into the stands to attack a Swans fan. The Tribunal suspended him for 10 years plus 16 games (later commuted to seven years). This suspension is not listed above because he was not a member of a Senior team, but it remains one of the most infamous suspensions in the modern history of the sport, being covered by Australian news for some time afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|aDMlxoUhPSo|john bourke (collingwood) hits umpire - his story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chair city for the alliance is Ichikawa, [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The alliance and its members work in favour of the healthy city, defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as "one that is continually creating and improving those physical and social environments and expanding those community resources which enable people to mutually support each other in performing all the functions of life and in developing to their maximum potential".&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. ''Health Promotion Glossary.'' Geneva, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Banner AFHC 2008 conference.jpg|thumb|120px|AFHC third conference [[nobori]] in [[Ichikawa, Chiba]] in October 2008]]
The first international declaration that promoted the concepts underlying healthy cities, the [[Alma Ata Declaration]], was adopted at the International Conference for [[Primary Health Care]], jointly convened by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and [[UNICEF]] in [[Almaty]] (formerly Alma-Ata), presently in [[Kazakhstan]], 6–12 September 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

 |deadurl=yes 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary health care strategy endorsed and targeted [[health for all]] the people of the world by the year 2000.

Various discussions have taken place since then. [[Trevor Hancock]] and [[Leonard Duhl]] promoted the term "Healthy Cities" in consultation with the [[WHO]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/pon97/indust1.htm |title=Healthy cities, healthy children, Leonard Duhl and Trevor Hancock|publisher=[[UNICEF]] |archiveurl=http://www.unicef.org/pon97/indust1.htm|archivedate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Economic development has brought comfort and convenience to many people in the industrialized world, but in its wake are pollution, new health problems, blighted urban landscapes and social isolation. Growing numbers of the dispossessed are also being left on the sidelines as the disparity between rich and poor grows. In an effort to remedy these ills, people from disparate backgrounds in thousands of communities are joining together with government agencies under the Healthy Cities/Healthy Communities banner to improve the quality of life in their towns and cities."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the First International Conference on Health Promotion in 1986, the [[Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion]] was adopted that presented actions to achieve healthy life for all people by the year 2000 and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

 |archivedate=2009-07-27 
 |deadurl=yes 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a second international conference on [[health promotion]] at [[Adelaide]] in 1988 and a third at [[Sundsvall]] in 1991, and twenty years after the [[Alma Ata Declaration]], the Fourth International Conference on Health Promotion held in July 1997 in [[Jakarta]] adopted the new [[Jakarta Declaration]]: "New Players for a New Era - Leading Health Promotion into the 21st Century". It came at a critical moment in the development of international PHC strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

An '''automated refraction system''' is a group of ophthalmic devices used during an [[eye examination]] to aid in the determination of a person's [[Refraction error|refractive error]] and [[Eyeglass prescription|prescription]] for [[glasses]] or [[contact lenses]].

The standard components of an automated refraction system are:

* an electronic and motor driven [[phoropter]] (auto-phoropter, auto-refractor head) used to present powered [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] in front of the patient's eyes, 
* a hardware or software-driven controller that changes the lenses in the phoroptor for the subjective portion of the testing. A lens and prism system can also be used.
* an [[eye chart]] to aid in the determination of [[visual acuity]] during the test,
* an [[autorefractor]] that measures the patient's objective refractive error, normally used as the starting point of the subjective testing,
* an autolensmeter that measures the powers of the patient's current pair of glasses or contact lenses.

Automated refraction systems currently on the market vary in features, level of automation, ease of use, training required and documentation.  Some systems contain automatic detection and compensation of common refraction issues such as [[Accommodation (eye)|accommodation]] and "over-minusing".  An automated refraction is quick and painless.

Some advantages of automated refraction systems vs. manual refraction equipment are:

* less manual labour by the practitioner or technician
* more automation of repetitive and iterative tasks in the refraction
* ability to present former and new values quickly for validation
* reduced risk of [[human error]]
* direct transmission of results to [[Electronic Medical Record]] (EMR) software - see [[paperless office]]
* improved office efficiency

Depending on the nature of the substance, the duration of exposure and other factors it can lead to varying degrees of damage to the [[oral mucosa]], the [[esophagus]], and the [[Gastric mucosa|lining of the stomach]].&lt;ref name=Lancet&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30313-0|title=Caustic ingestion|journal=The Lancet|volume=389|issue=10083|pages=2041|year=2017|last1=Chirica|first1=Mircea|last2=Bonavina|first2=Luigi|last3=Kelly|first3=Michael D|last4=Sarfati|first4=Emile|last5=Cattan|first5=Pierre|pmid=28045663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The severity of the injury can be determined by [[Esophagogastroduodenoscopy|endoscopy]] of the upper digestive tract, although [[CT scan]]ning may be more useful to determine whether surgery may be required.&lt;ref name=Lancet/&gt;

During the healing process, [[Esophageal stricture|strictures]] of the oesophagus may form, which may require [[Esophageal dilatation|therapeutic dilatation]] and insertion of a [[Esophageal stent|stent]].&lt;ref name=Lancet/&gt;

'''''Chlamydia trachomatis''''' ({{IPAc-en|k|l|ə|ˈ|m|ɪ|d|i|ə|_|t|r|ə|ˈ|k|oʊ|m|ə|t|ᵻ|s}}), commonly known as chlamydia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://web.uconn.edu/mcbstaff/graf/Student%20presentations/Chlamydia/Chlamydia%20trachomatis.html|title= Chlamydia trachomatis|date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a bacterium that can [[obligate intracellular parasite|only replicate]] in human cells. It causes [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], which can manifest in various ways, including: [[trachoma]], [[lymphogranuloma venereum]], [[non-gonococcal urethritis|nongonococcal urethritis]], [[cervicitis]], [[salpingitis]], [[pelvic inflammatory disease]]. ''C. trachomatis'' is the most common infectious cause of blindness and the most common sexually transmitted bacterium.&lt;ref name=Elwell2016/&gt;

Different types of ''C. trachomatis'' cause different diseases. The most common strains cause disease in the genital tract, while other strains cause disease in the eye or lymph nodes. Like other ''Chlamydia'' species, the ''C. trachomatis'' life cycle consists of two morphologically distinct life stages: elementary bodies and reticulate bodies. Elementary bodies are spore-like and infectious. Reticulate bodies are the replicative stage and are only seen within host cells.

==Description==
''Chlamydia trachomatis'' is a [[gram-negative bacteria|gram-negative]] bacteria that can only replicate [[Obligate parasite|within a host]] cell.&lt;ref name=Elwell2016&gt;{{cite journal|title=''Chlamydia'' cell biology and pathogenesis |date=2016 |vauthors=Elwell C, Mirrashidi K, Engel J |journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology |volume=14 |pages=385-400 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro.2016.30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the ''C. trachomatis'' life cycle, the bacteria take on two distinct forms. [[Elementary body|Elementary bodies]] are 200 to 400 [[nanometer]]s across, and are surrounded by a rigid cell wall that allows them to survive outside of a host cell.&lt;ref name=Elwell2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bergey&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Chlamydia |vauthors=Kuo CC, Stephens RS, Bavoil PM, Kaltenboeck B |date=2015 |doi=10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00364 |isbn=9781118960608 |title=Bergey's Manual of Systematics of Archaea and Bacteria |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |editor=Whitman WB}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form can initiate a new infection if it comes into contact with a susceptible host cell.&lt;ref name=Elwell2016/&gt; [[Reticulate body|Reticulate bodies]] are 600 to 1500 nanometers across, and are only found within host cells.&lt;ref name=Bergey/&gt; Neither form is motile.&lt;ref name=Bergey/&gt;

The ''C. trachomatis'' genome is substantially smaller than that of many other bacteria at approximately 1.04 [[megabase]]s, encoding approximately 900 genes.&lt;ref name=Elwell2016/&gt; A number of important metabolic functions are not encoded in the ''C. trachomatis'' genome, and instead are likely scavenged from the host cell.&lt;ref name=Elwell2016/&gt; In addition to the [[chromosome]] that contains most of the genome, nearly all ''C. trachomatis'' strains carry a 7.5 [[kilobase]] plasmid that contains 8 genes.&lt;ref name=Bergey/&gt; The role of this plasmid is unknown, though strains without the plasmid have been isolated, suggesting it is not required for suvival of the bacterium.&lt;ref name=Bergey/&gt;

==Life cycle==
[[File:Chlamydae Life Cycle.svg|thumb|400px|Life cycle]]
Like other ''Chlamydia'' species, ''C. trachomatis'' has a life cycle consisting of two morphologically distinct forms. First, ''C. trachomatis'' attaches to a new host cell as a small spore-like form called the [[elementary body]].&lt;ref name=Nunes2014/&gt; The elementary body enters the host cell, surrounded by a host [[vacuole]], called an inclusion.&lt;ref name=Nunes2014/&gt; Within the inclusion, ''C. trachomatis'' transforms into a larger, more metabolically active form called the [[reticulate body]].&lt;ref name=Nunes2014/&gt; The reticulate body substantially modifies the inclusion, making it a more hospitable environment for rapid replication of the bacteria, which occurs over the following 30 to 72 hours.&lt;ref name=Nunes2014/&gt; The massive number of intracellular bacteria then transition back to resistant elementary bodies, before causing the cell to rupture and being released into the environment.&lt;ref name=Nunes2014/&gt; These new elementary bodies are then shed in the semen or released from epithelial cells of the female genital tract, and attach to new host cells.&lt;ref name=Witkin2017&gt;{{cite journal|title=''Chlamydia trachomatis'':the persistent pathogen |journal=Clinical and Vaccine Immunology |doi=10.1128/CVI.00203-17 |pmid=28835360 |date=2017 |vauthors=Witkin SS, Minis E, Athanasiou A, Leizer J, Linhares IM |volume=24 |issue=10 |pages=e00203-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
''C. trachomatis'' are bacteria in the phylum [[Chlamydiae]], a group of obligate intracellular parasites of [[eukaryote|eukaryotic cells]].&lt;ref name=Elwell2016/&gt;

''C. trachomatis'' strains are generally divided into three [[biovar]]s based on the type of disease they cause. These are further subdivided into several [[serovar]]s based on surface [[antigen]]s recognized by the immune system.&lt;ref name=Elwell2016/&gt; Serovars A through C cause trachoma. Serovars D through K infect the genital tract, causing pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancies, and infertility. Serovars L1 through L3 cause an invasive infection of the lymph nodes near the genitals, called [[lymphogranuloma venereum]].&lt;ref name=Elwell2016/&gt;

''C. trachomatis'' is thought to have diverged from other ''Chlamydia'' species around 6 million years ago, when its sole host modern humans emerged.&lt;ref name=Nunes2014/&gt; The closest relative to ''C. trachomatis'' is ''[[Chlamydia muridarurm|C. muridarum]]'', which infects mice.&lt;ref name=Nunes2014/&gt; Different evolutionarily distinct lineages of ''C. trachomatis'' seem to cause disease in different body niches:&lt;ref name=Nunes2014/&gt;

==Role in disease==
{{See also|Chlamydia infection}}

Clinical signs and symptoms of ''C. trachomatis'' infection and [[gonorrhea]] infection are indistinguishable.&lt;ref name="Malhotra2013"/&gt;&lt;!--review article --&gt;
Both are common causes of [[urethritis]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fredlund H, Falk L, Jurstrand M, Unemo M |title=Molecular genetic methods for diagnosis and characterisation of ''Chlamydia trachomatis'' and ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'': impact on epidemiological surveillance and interventions |journal=APMIS: acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica |volume=112 |issue=11–12 |pages=771–84 |year=2004 |pmid=15638837 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0463.2004.apm11211-1205.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0903-4641&amp;date=2004&amp;volume=112&amp;issue=11-12&amp;spage=771}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''C. trachomatis'' is the single most important infectious agent associated with blindness (trachoma); about 84 million worldwide suffer ''C. trachomatis'' eye infections and 8 million are blinded as a result of the infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Trachoma |work=Prevention of Blindness and Visual Impairment |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/blindness/causes/trachoma/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pathogenesis===
Elementary bodies are generally present in the semen of infected men and vaginal secretions of infected women.&lt;ref name=Witkin2017/&gt; When they come into contact with a new host cell, the elementary bodies bind to the cell via interaction between [[Bacterial adhesin|adhesin]]s on their surface and several host receptor proteins and [[heparan sulfate proteoglycan]]s.&lt;ref name=Elwell2016/&gt; Once attached, the bacteria inject various effector proteins into the host cell using a [[type three secretion system]].&lt;ref name=Elwell2016/&gt; These effectors trigger the host cell to take up the elementary bodies and prevent the cell from triggering [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name=Elwell2016/&gt; Within 6 to 8 hours after infection, the elementary bodies transition to reticulate bodies and a number of new effectors are synthesized.&lt;ref name=Elwell2016/&gt; These effectors include a number of proteins that modify the inclusion membrane, called [[Inc protein]]s, as well as proteins that redirect host vesicles to the inclusion.&lt;ref name=Elwell2016/&gt; 8 to 16 hours after infection, another set of effectors are synthesized, driving acquisition of nutrients from the host cell.&lt;ref name=Elwell2016/&gt; At this stage, the reticulate bodies begin to divide, causing the inclusion to expand.&lt;ref name=Elwell2016/&gt; If several elemenary bodies have infected a single cell, their inclusions will fuse at this point to create a single large inclusion in the host cell.&lt;ref name=Elwell2016/&gt; From 24 to 72 hours after infection, reticulate bodies transition to elementary bodies which are released either by lysis of the host cell or extrusion of the entire inclusion into the host genital tract.&lt;ref name=Elwell2016/&gt;

===Presentation===
Most people infected with ''C. trachomatis'' are asymptomatic. However, the bacteria can present in one of three ways: genitourinary (genitals), pulmonary (lungs), and ocular (eyes). Genitourinary cases can include genital discharge, vaginal bleeding, itchiness (pruritus), painful urination (dysuria), among other symptoms.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chlamydia Trachomatis Infections: Screening, Diagnosis, and Management|journal=American Family Physician|publication-date=15 December 2012 |volume=86|issue=12|pages=1127–1132|pmid=23316985|vauthors=Mishori R, McClaskey EL, WinklerPrins VJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, symptoms are similar to those of a [[urinary tract infection]].

===Prevalence===
Three times as many women as men are diagnosed with genitourinary ''C. trachomatis'' infections. Women aged 15–19 have the highest prevalence, followed by women aged 20–24, although the rate of increase of diagnosis is greater for men than for women. Risk factors for genitourinary infections include unprotected sex with multiple partners, lack of condom use, and living in an urban area.

Pulmonary infections can occur in infants born to women with active chlamydia infections, although the rate of infection is less than 10%.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Ocular infections take the form of conjunctivitis or trachoma, both in adults and children. Trachoma is the primary source of infectious blindness in some parts of rural Africa and Asia&lt;ref&gt;Global Network for Neglected Tropical Diseases. Trachoma interactive fact sheet.&lt;nowiki&gt;http://old.globalnetwork.org/sites/all/modules/globalnetwork/factsheetxml/disease.php?id=9&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Accessed February 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and is a [[neglected tropical disease]] that has been targeted by the World Health Organization for elimination by 2020.

===Treatment===
Treatment depends on the infection site, age of the patient, and whether another infection is present. Having a ''C. trachomatis'' and one or more other [[sexually transmitted infection]]s at the same time is possible. Treatment is often done with both partners simultaneously to prevent reinfection. ''C. trachomatis'' may be treated with several antibiotic medications, including [[azithromycin]], [[erythromycin]], or [[ofloxacin]].&lt;ref name=Malhotra2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Malhotra M, Sood S, Mukherjee A, Muralidhar S, Bala M |title=Genital Chlamydia trachomatis: an update |journal=Indian J. Med. Res. |volume=138 |issue=3 |pages=303–16|date=September 2013 |pmid=24135174 |pmc=3818592 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--review article --&gt;&lt;!--Other medications are used to treat this disease; I just can't find a reference to support the other medications. Bfpage --&gt;

Azithromycin and doxycycline have equal efficacy to treat C. trachomatis with 97 and 98 percent success respectively. Treatment with doxycycline generic 2x1 100&amp;nbsp;mg for 7 days has equal success with expensive delayed-released doxycycline 1x 200&amp;nbsp;mg for 7 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/chlamydia.htm |title=Chlamydial Infections in Adolescents and Adults |accessdate=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If treatment is necessary during pregnancy, [[levofloxacin]], ofloxacin, and [[doxycycline]] are not prescribed. In the case of a patient who is pregnant, the medications typically prescribed are azithromycin, amoxicillin, and erythromycin. Amoxicillin has fewer side effects than the other medications for treating antenatal ''C. trachomatis'' infection. Retesting during pregnancy can be performed three weeks after treatment. If the risk of reinfection is high, screening can be repeated throughout pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Malhotra2013/&gt;

If the infection has progressed, ascending the reproductive tract and pelvic inflammatory disease develops, damage to the fallopian tubes may have already occurred. In most cases, the ''C. trachomatis'' infection is then treated on an outpatient basis with azithromycin or doxycycline. Treating the mother of an infant with ''C. trachomatis'' of the eye, which can evolve into a pneumonia, is recommended.&lt;ref name=Malhotra2013/&gt;

===Laboratory tests===

''Chlamydia'' species are readily identified and distinguished from other ''Chlamydia'' species using DNA-based tests.

Most strains of ''C. trachomatis'' are recognized by [[monoclonal antibodies]] (mAbs) to epitopes in the VS4 region of MOMP.&lt;ref name="pmid10678996"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ortiz L, Angevine M, Kim SK, Watkins D, DeMars R |title=T-Cell Epitopes in Variable Segments of ''Chlamydia trachomatis'' Major Outer Membrane Protein Elicit Serovar-Specific Immune Responses in Infected Humans |journal=Infect. Immun. |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=1719–23 |year=2000 |pmid=10678996|doi=10.1128/IAI.68.3.1719-1723.2000 |pmc=97337}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these mAbs may also cross-react with two other ''Chlamydia'' species, ''[[Chlamydia suis|C. suis]]'' and ''[[Chlamydia muridarum|C. muridarum]]''.

*[[Nucleic acid amplification tests]] (NAATs) tests find the genetic material (DNA) of ''Chlamydia'' bacteria. These tests are the most sensitive tests available, meaning they are very accurate and are very unlikely to have false-negative test results. A [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) test is an example of a nucleic acid amplification test. This test can also be done on a urine sample.
*Nucleic acid hybridization tests (DNA probe test) also find ''Chlamydia'' DNA. A probe test is very accurate, but is not as sensitive as NAATs.
*[[Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] (ELISA, EIA) finds substances (''Chlamydia'' antigens) that trigger the immune system to fight ''Chlamydia'' infection. Chlamydia Elementary body (EB)-ELISA could be used to stratify different stages of infection based upon Immunoglobulin-γ status of the infected individuals &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakshi|first=Rakesh|last2=Gupta|first2=Kanupriya|last3=Jordan|first3=Stephen J.|last4=Brown|first4=LaDraka' T.|last5=Press|first5=Christen G.|last6=Gorwitz|first6=Rachel J.|last7=Papp|first7=John R.|last8=Morrison|first8=Sandra G.|last9=Lee|first9=Jeannette Y.|date=2017-04-21|title=Immunoglobulin-Based Investigation of Spontaneous Resolution of Chlamydia trachomatis Infection|journal=The Journal of Infectious Diseases|doi=10.1093/infdis/jix194|issn=1537-6613|pmid=28444306}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Direct fluorescent antibody]] test also finds ''Chlamydia'' antigens.
*''Chlamydia'' [[cell culture]] is a test in which the suspected ''Chlamydia'' sample is grown in a vial of cells. The pathogen infects the cells, and after a set incubation time (48 hours), the vials are stained and viewed on a fluorescent light microscope. Cell culture is more expensive and takes longer (two days) than the other tests. The culture must be grown in a laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/chlamydia-tests |title=Chlamydia Tests |accessdate=2012-08-07 |work=

==Research==
Due to its significance to human health, ''C. trachomatis'' is the subject of research in laboratories around the world. The bacteria are commonly grown in [[immortalised cell line]]s such as [[McCoy cell]]s and [[HeLa cell]]s.&lt;ref name=Bergey/&gt; Infectious particles can be quantified by infecting cell layers and counting the number of inclusions, analagous to a [[plaque assay]].&lt;ref name=Bergey/&gt;

==History==
''C. trachomatis'' was first described in 1907 by Stanislaus von Prowazek and Ludwig Halberstädter in scrapings from trachoma cases.&lt;ref name=Nunes2014&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evolution, Phylogeny, and molecular epidemiology of ''Chlamydia'' |journal=Infection, Genetics, and Evolution |volume=23 |date=2014 |pages=49-64 |vauthors=Nunes A, Gomes JP |doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2014.01.029}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinking they had discovered a "mantled protozoan", they named the organism "Chlamydozoa" from the Greek "Chlamys" meaning mantle.&lt;ref name=Nunes2014/&gt; Over the next several decades, "Chlamydozoa" was thought to be a virus as it was small enough to pass through bacterial filters and unable to grow on known laboratory media.&lt;ref name=Nunes2014/&gt; However, in 1966 [[electron microscopy]] studies showed ''C. trachomatis'' to be a bacterium.&lt;ref name=Nunes2014/&gt;

''C. trachomatis'' agent was first cultured and isolated in the yolk sacs of eggs by [[Tang Fei-fan]], ''et al.'' in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Darougar S, Jones BR, Kinnison JR, Vaughan-Jackson JD, Dunlop EM |title=Chlamydial infection&lt;/ref&gt; This was a significant milestone because it became possible to preserve these agents which could then be used for future genomic and phylogenetic studies. The isolation of C. trachomatis coined the term isolate to describe how C. trachomatis has been isolated from an in vivo setting into a “strain” in cell culture. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Clarke |first1=Ian |title=Evolution of Chlamydia Trachomatis |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22239534 |website=pubmed.gov |accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few “isolates” have been studied in detail, limiting the information that can be found on the evolutionary history of C. trachomatis.

'''Chronic Lyme disease''' (not to be confused with [[Lyme disease]]) is a generally rejected diagnosis that encompasses "a broad array of illnesses or symptom complexes for which there is no reproducible or convincing scientific evidence of any relationship to ''[[Borrelia burgdorferi]]'' infection."&lt;ref name="nejm-feder"/&gt; Despite numerous studies, there is no clinical evidence that "chronic" Lyme disease is caused by a persistent infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=P.

== Background ==
[[File:Doxycycline 100mg capsules.jpg|thumb|There are risks associated with long-term use of antibiotics, such as [[doxycycline]], by people who believe they have chronic lyme disease.]]
&lt;!-- Terminology --&gt;
The term ''chronic Lyme disease'' is distinct from untreated late-stage Lyme disease, which can cause [[arthritis]], [[peripheral neuropathy]] and/or [[encephalomyelitis]]. Chronic Lyme disease is also distinct from the 'post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome' (PTLDS)", when symptoms linger after standard antibiotic treatments.&lt;ref name=cdc_postlds&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/postLDS/index.html |title=CDC - Post Lyme Disease Syndrome - Lyme Disease |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=February 7, 2013 |accessdate=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cairns"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cairns V, Godwin J |title=Post-Lyme borreliosis syndrome: a meta-analysis of reported symptoms |journal=Int J Epidemiol |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=1340–45 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16040645 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyi129}}&lt;/ref&gt; PTLDS is estimated to occur in less than 5% of people who had Lyme disease and were treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bope|first1=Edward T.|last2=Kellerman|first2=Rick D.|title=Conn's Current Therapy 2013: Expert Consult: Online|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=1455733342|page=151|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SwRBtIPU5yQC&amp;pg=PT151|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases there is no objective evidence that people who believe they have chronic Lyme have ever been infected with Lyme disease: standard diagnostic tests for infection are often negative.&lt;ref name="nejm-feder"&gt;{{cite journal | title = A Critical Appraisal of "Chronic Lyme Disease" | journal = [[The New England Journal of Medicine|NEJM]] | volume = 357 | issue = 14 | pages = 1422–30 | url = http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMra072023 |date=October 2007 | pmid = 17914043 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra072023 | last1 = Feder | first1 = HM | last2 = Johnson | first2 = BJB | last3 = O'Connell | first3 = S | display-authors = 3 | last4 = Shapiro | first4 = ED | last5 = Steere | first5 = AC | last6 = Wormser | first6 = GP | author7 = Ad Hoc International Lyme Disease Group | last8 = Agger | first8 = WA | last9 = Artsob | first9 = H | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IDSA_FAQ&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.idsociety.org/Lyme_Facts/ | title = Ten Facts You Should Know About Lyme Disease |publisher = [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]]|date = May 10, 2011| accessdate = June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause --&gt;
While it is undisputed people can have severe symptoms of an illness, the cause and appropriate treatment promoted by "chronic Lyme" advocates are controversial. The symptoms represent "for all intents and purposes" [[fibromyalgia]] or [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].&lt;ref name=FMWars&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wolfe F |title=Fibromyalgia wars |journal=[[J.

The authors noted that none of the lingering spirochetes were associated with inflamed tissues and criticized the studies for not considering adequately the different [[pharmacodynamics]] and [[pharmacokinetics]] of the antibiotics used to treat the animals in the trials versus what would be expected to be used to treat humans. The authors concluded, "There is no scientific evidence to support the hypothesis that such spirochetes, should they exist in humans, are the cause of post-Lyme disease syndrome."&lt;ref name=Wormser2009&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wormser GP, Schwartz I |title=Antibiotic treatment of animals infected with Borrelia burgdorferi |journal=Clin.

Major US medical authorities, including the [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]], the [[American Academy of Neurology]], and the [[National Institutes of Health]], have stated there is no convincing evidence that ''Borrelia'' is involved in the various symptoms classed as chronic Lyme disease, and particularly advise against long-term antibiotic treatment as it is ineffective and potentially harmful.&lt;ref name="nejm-feder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="idsa guideline"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wormser GP |title=The clinical assessment, treatment, and prevention of lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis: clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America |journal=Clin.

== Controversy and politics ==

While there is general agreement on the optimal treatment for early Lyme disease, the existence of chronic Lyme is generally rejected and there is no consensus even among advocates over its prevalence, diagnostic criteria, or treatment.&lt;ref name=Tonks/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ballantyne 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1215615 '''Correspondence''', "Reinfection versus Relapse in Lyme Disease"], New England Journal of Medicine, March 14, 2013.  (This exchange of three letters nicely illustrates the controversy and some of the issues at stake.)&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence-based perspective is exemplified by a 2007 review in ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]],'' which noted the diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease is used by a few physicians despite a lack of "reproducible or convincing scientific evidence", leading the authors to describe this diagnosis as "the latest in a series of syndromes that have been postulated in an attempt to attribute medically unexplained symptoms to particular infections."&lt;ref name="nejm-feder"/&gt; Medical authorities agree with this viewpoint: the [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] (IDSA), the [[American Academy of Neurology]], the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), and the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), advise against long-term antibiotic treatment for chronic Lyme disease, given the lack of supporting evidence and the potential toxicities.&lt;ref name="idsa guideline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17522387"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nih-cld"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] | title = "Chronic Lyme Disease" Fact Sheet | url =http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/lymedisease/understanding/pages/chronic.aspx | date = April 17, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611094755/http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/lymedisease/understanding/pages/chronic.aspx|archivedate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A minority, primarily not medical practitioners, holds that chronic Lyme disease is responsible for a range of unexplained symptoms, sometimes in people without any evidence of past infection.&lt;ref name="Ballantyne 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ballantyne C |title=The chronic debate over Lyme disease|journal=Nat.

In 2006, [[Richard Blumenthal]], the [[Connecticut Attorney General]], opened an [[antitrust]] investigation against the IDSA, accusing the IDSA Lyme disease panel of undisclosed [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] and of unduly dismissing alternative therapies and chronic Lyme disease. The investigation was closed on May 1, 2008, without charges when the IDSA agreed to submit to a review of its guidelines by a panel of independent scientists and physicians which would occur on July 30, 2009,&lt;ref name="amnews"/&gt; citing mounting legal costs and the difficulty of presenting scientific arguments in a legal setting.&lt;ref name="cid-danger"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Klein JO |title=Danger ahead: politics intrude in Infectious Diseases Society of America guideline for Lyme disease |journal=Clin.

The expert panel's review was published in 2010, with the independent doctors and scientists in the panel unanimously endorsing the guidelines, stating "No changes or revisions to the 2006 Lyme guidelines are necessary at this time," and concluding long-term antibiotic treatments are unproven and potentially dangerous.&lt;ref name=singer_2010&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/36721207/ns/health-infectious_diseases/|title=No changes to Lyme disease treatment |first=Stephen |last=Singer |agency=Associated Press |date=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IDSA welcomed the final report, stating that "Our number one concern is the patients we treat, and we're glad patients and their physicians now have additional reassurance that the guidelines are medically sound."&lt;ref name=idsa_besttreat_2010&gt;[http://www.idsociety.org/Lyme_Review_Panel_News_Release/ Special Review Panel Unanimously Upholds Lyme Disease Treatment Guidelines: Short-term Antibiotics Proven to be Best Treatment for Patients] [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]].

But the bottom line, to me, is that ''Under Our Skin'' is not a very well-made movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gleiberman |first1=Owen |date=20 November 2009 |title=Oscar documentary scandal: The real reason that too many good movies got left out |url=http://ew.com/article/2009/11/20/oscar-documentary-scandal/ |website=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Chronic enteropathy associated with SLCO2A1 [[gene]]''' is a rare [[Autosome|autosomal]] [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive]] [[enteropathy]] that was first described in 1968.&lt;ref name=Okabe1968&gt;Okabe H, Sakimura M (1968) Nonspecific multiple ulcer of the small intestine. Stomach and Intestine 3: 1539–1549&lt;/ref&gt; This condition was previously named chronic nonspecific multiple [[Gastric ulcer|ulcers]] of the [[small intestine]].&lt;ref name=Matsumoto2004&gt;Matsumoto T, Iida M, Matsui T, Yao T, Watanabe H, Yao T, Okabe H (2004) Non-specific multiple ulcers of the small intestine unrelated to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. J Clin Pathol 57(11):1145-1150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Matsumoto2007&gt;Matsumoto T, Iida M, Matsui T, Yao T (2007) Chronic nonspecific multiple ulcers of the small intestine: a proposal of the entity from Japanese gastroenterologists to Western enteroscopists. Gastrointest Endosc 66(3 Suppl):S99-107&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical features==

This [[disease]] occurs most commonly in women. [[Symptom]] onset is usually in [[adolescence]]. Symptoms include [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[Edema|oedema]] and [[abdominal pain]]. The disease course is [[Chronic condition|chronic]] and while [[Immunosuppression|immunosuppressants]] have been tried these have not been shown to be helpful.

On small bowel endoscopy the ulcers may be visible.

==Pathology==

Within the small intestine there are multiple small shallow ulcers which may be linear or concentric.&lt;ref name=Matsumoto2006&gt;Matsumoto T, Nakamura S, Esaki M, Yada S, Koga H, Yao T, Iida M (2006) Endoscopic features of chronic nonspecific multiple ulcers of the small intestine: comparison with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced enteropathy. Dig Dis Sci 51(8):1357-1363&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stenosis|Stensosis]] of the small bowel may be present due to healing of these ulcers. The ulcers resemble those associated with non steroidal use but occur in the absence of the use of these drugs.

==Genetics==

[[DNA sequencing|Sequencing]] the DNA of several [[patient]]s suggested a [[mutation]] in the [[SLCO2A1]] gene.&lt;ref name=Umeno2015&gt;Umeno J, Hisamatsu T, Esaki M, Hirano A, Kubokura N, Asano K, Kochi S, Yanai S, Fuyuno Y, Shimamura K, Hosoe N, Ogata H, Watanabe T, Aoyagi K, Ooi H, Watanabe K, Yasukawa S, Hirai F, Matsui T, Iida M, Yao T, Hibi T, Kosaki K, Kanai T, Kitazono T, Matsumoto T (2015) A hereditary enteropathy caused by mutations in the SLCO2A1 gene, encoding a prostaglandin transporter. PLoS Genet 5:11(11):e1005581. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005581&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of this mutation was confirmed by sequencing this gene in additional patients.

This gene encodes an [[prostaglandin]] transporter. As [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug|non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] inhibit prostaglandin synthesis this helps to explain the known similarity in the [[Histology|histological]] findings between these conditions. The identification of this mutation suggests that prostaglandin replacement may be helpful but this will need to be tested in a [[Clinical trial|clinical trail]].

'''Culinary diplomacy''', also known as '''gastrodiplomacy''', is a type of [[cultural diplomacy]], which itself is a subset of [[public diplomacy]]. Its basic premise is that "the easiest way to win hearts and minds is through the stomach".&lt;ref name="Rockower 1"&gt;Rockower, Paul S. [http://uscpublicdiplomacy.org/media/Projecting_Taiwan.pdf "Projecting Taiwan: Taiwan's Public Diplomacy Outreach."] ''Issues &amp; Studies'' 47, no. 1 (March 2011): 107-152.&lt;/ref&gt; Official government-sponsored culinary diplomacy programs have been established in [[Thailand]], [[South Korea]], [[Malaysia]], [[Peru]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=Chapple-Sokol&gt;Chapple-Sokol, Samuel. [http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/10.1163/1871191x-12341244 "Culinary Diplomacy: Breaking Bread to Win Hearts and Minds."] ''The Hague Journal of Diplomacy'' Volume 8, Issue 2 (2013): 161-183.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and definitions ==

The terms "culinary diplomacy" and "gastrodiplomacy" have been in use since the early 2000s, and have been popularized by the work of public diplomacy scholars [[Paul Rockower]] and [[Sam Chapple-Sokol]]. An early mention of the concept was in a 2002 [[The Economist|Economist]] article about the ''Thai Kitchen of the World'' program.&lt;ref name="KOTW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Economist-20020221" /&gt; In a 2011 article published in the Taiwanese journal ''Issues &amp; Studies'', Rockower wrote that "Gastrodiplomacy is predicated on the notion that the easiest way to win hearts and minds is through the stomach."&lt;ref name="Rockower 1" /&gt; Chapple-Sokol wrote in a 2013 article in the journal ''The Hague Journal of Diplomacy'' that culinary diplomacy is "the use of food and cuisine as an instrument to create cross-cultural understanding in the hopes of improving interactions and cooperation."&lt;ref name="Chapple-Sokol" /&gt;

=== Culinary diplomacy versus gastrodiplomacy ===

The two terms "culinary diplomacy" and "gastrodiplomacy" are used interchangeably by many, though some scholars have differentiated the terms. Rockower, for example, claims that gastrodiplomacy refers to a tool of public diplomacy, while culinary diplomacy serves as "a means to further diplomatic protocol through cuisine".&lt;ref name="Rockower 2"&gt;Rockower, Paul S. [http://www.palgrave-journals.com/pb/journal/v8/n3/abs/pb201217a.html "Recipes for Gastrodiplomacy."] ''Place Branding and Public Diplomacy'' Volume 8 (2012): 235-346.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chapple-Sokol writes that both of these fall under the broad categorization of "culinary diplomacy", and differentiates between ''public'' and ''private'' culinary diplomacy.&lt;ref name="Chapple-Sokol" /&gt; The former refers to culinary diplomacy being used as a tool of public diplomacy, and more specifically cultural diplomacy, while the latter "occurs behind closed doors", akin to Rockower's definition.

== Examples ==

=== Thailand ===
The "Global Thai" program, launched in 2002, was a government-led culinary diplomacy initiative. It aimed to boost the number of Thai restaurants worldwide to 8,000 by 2003 from about 5,500 previously.&lt;ref name="Economist-20020221"&gt;{{cite news |title=Thailand's gastro-diplomacy |url=https://www.economist.com/asia/2002/02/21/thailands-gastro-diplomacy |accessdate=16 August 2018 |work=The Economist |date=2002-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, that number had swelled to more than 10,000 Thai restaurants worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Developing Chefs for Thai Cuisine Who Will Promote Thai Food Standards Overseas |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926085448/http://thailand.prd.go.th/view_news.php?id=5585&amp;a=2 |accessdate=16 August 2018 |work=The Government Public Relations Department (PRD) (Thailand) |date=2011-03-21 |format=Press release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was explained in ''Thailand: Kitchen of the World'', an eBook published to promote the program. The point of the e-book: "In the view of the Export Promotion Department, Thai restaurants have a good business potential that can be developed to maintain a high level of international recognition. To achieve that goal, the department is carrying out a public relations campaign to build up a good image of the country through Thai restaurants worldwide."&lt;ref name="KOTW"&gt;{{cite book |title=Thailand: Kitchen of the World |date=n.d. |publisher=The Government Public Relations Department (Thailand) (PRD)|location=Bangkok |url=http://thailand.prd.go.th/ebook2/kitchen/intro.html |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|Chapter 7}}

The Department of Export Promotion of the Thai [[Ministry of Commerce (Thailand)|Ministry of Commerce]] offers potential restaurateurs plans for three different "master restaurant" types—from fast food to elegant—which investors can choose as a prefabricated restaurant plan.&lt;ref name="ThaiSelect"&gt;{{cite web |title=Thai Select |url=https://thailandselect.wordpress.com/thai-biz-restaurant/ |website=Thai Select |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vice-20180329"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Karp |first1=Myles |title=The Surprising Reason that There Are So Many Thai Restaurants in America |url=https://munchies.vice.com/en_us/article/paxadz/the-surprising-reason-that-there-are-so-many-thai-restaurants-in-america?utm_source=reddit.com |accessdate=16 August 2018 |work=Vice |date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concomitantly, the [[Export-Import Bank of Thailand]] offered loans to Thai nationals aiming to open restaurants abroad, and the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Bank of Thailand set up an infrastructure for loans of up to US$3 million for overseas food industry initiatives, including Thai restaurants.&lt;ref name="Vice-20180329" /&gt;

=== South Korea ===

[[South Korea]] launched its own culinary diplomacy program in 2009, a $77m investment entitled "Korean Cuisine to the World or "Global ''Hansik''".&lt;ref name="Pham"&gt;Pham, Mary Jo A. [http://thediplomatist.com/2013/01/25/food-as-communication-a-case-study-of-south-koreas-gastrodiplomacy/ "Food as Communication: A Case Study of South Korea's Gastrodiplomacy."] ''Journal of International Service'' Volume 22, Number 1 (Spring 2013): 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of the program, run by the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, are to promote the unique nature and health qualities of [[Korean cuisine]] (''hansik''), as well as to increase the number of Korean restaurants worldwide to 40,000 by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;"Global Hansik off to strong start" [http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2009/05/123_42711.html ''The Korea Times'']&lt;/ref&gt; Projects undertaken by the Korean government include the opening of a [[kimchi]] institute, working to establish Korean cuisine as a course in internationally recognized cooking schools, and the launch of a touring Korean [[food truck]].&lt;ref name="Pham"/&gt;

=== Malaysia ===

Since 2010 [[Malaysia]] has undertaken a similar project by running the "Malaysia Kitchen" Programme.&lt;ref&gt;"'Malaysia Kitchen for the World 2010' Campaign Launched to Promote Malaysian Restaurants and Cuisine in the New York Metro Area" [http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/malaysia-kitchen-for-the-world-2010-campaign-launched-to-promote-malaysian-restaurants-and-cuisine-in-the-new-york-metro-area-87148567.html ''PRNewswire'']&lt;/ref&gt; The programme, carried out by the Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation, has focused most of its efforts to promote [[Malaysian cuisine]] in Australia, United States and United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Rockower 2"/&gt; Malaysia is an especially appropriate country to conduct culinary diplomacy due to its history as a culinary crossroads and its current mix of [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], and [[Indian people|Indian]] populations. The approach, which has employed celebrity chefs such as [[Rick Stein]] and [[Norman Musa]] in the UK, has had significant impact in increasing awareness of Malaysian cuisine and Malaysian restaurants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btimes.com.my/Current_News/BTIMES/articles/3DAPOR/Article/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203032454/http://www.btimes.com.my/Current_News/BTIMES/articles/3DAPOR/Article/ |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; through product promotions and cooking demonstrations at supermarkets, food festivals and an annual night market at [[Trafalgar Square]], London.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/434621/Thousands-drawn-to-Trafalgar-Square-for-a-taste-of-Malaysia&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peru ===

An official [[Peru]]vian culinary diplomacy program started in 2011, with Peru's application for its cuisine to be included in [[UNESCO]]'s list of [[intangible cultural heritage|intangible cultural heritage,]] the first year food heritage was recognized. &lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Rachel.

=== The United States ===

In September 2012, the United States officially launched its Culinary Diplomacy Partnership Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/09/197375.htm U.S. Department of State to Launch Diplomatic Culinary Partnership]&lt;/ref&gt; More than 80 chefs, including White House Executive Chef [[Cristeta Comerford]], former White House Executive Pastry Chef [[William Yosses]], and Spanish-born chef [[José Andrés]], were named to be members of the "American Chef Corps." The initiative is organized by the [[United States State Department]] Office of Protocol. One goal of the program is to send members of the Chef Corps to American embassies abroad on [[public diplomacy]] missions to teach about [[Cuisine of the United States|American cuisine]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3847">'''E-epidemiology''' (also known as Digital Epidemiology) is the science underlying the acquisition, maintenance and application of [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] knowledge and information using digital media such as the [[internet]], [[mobile phones]], [[digital paper]], [[digital TV]].  E-epidemiology also refers to the large-scale epidemiological studies that are increasingly conducted through distributed global collaborations enabled by the Internet.&lt;ref name="BrownsteinFreifeld2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brownstein|first1=John S.|last2=Freifeld|first2=Clark C.|last3=Madoff|first3=Lawrence C.|title=Digital Disease Detection — Harnessing the Web for Public Health Surveillance|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=360|issue=21|year=2009|pages=2153–2157|issn=0028-4793|doi=10.1056/NEJMp0900702|pmid=19423867|pmc=2917042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional approach in performing epidemiological trials by using paper questionnaires is both costly and time-consuming. The questionnaires have to be transformed to analyzable data and a large number of personnel are needed throughout the procedure.
Modern communication tools, such as the web, cell phones and other current and future communication devices, allow rapidly and cost-efficient assembly of data on determinants for lifestyle and health for broad segments of the population. Modern IT technology provides means for storage, organization and retrieval of large amounts of biological and lifestyle data, which will ensure more data and more reliable statistical results. Efficient number crunching computing, using modern analytical tools and simulation based inference procedures allow knowledge to be extracted from the resulting large and complex data-structures. 
Web portals directly connected to the studies enables instant feedback and information to the participants. It also allows animations and other web based tools linked to the questionnaires, which can increase the interactivity and facilitates flow of information between the study participant and the study centre. The web portal will also generate a possibility for the Universities to carry out the third assignment, which is to spread the knowledge generated at the University to the public.

Important aspects of e-epidemiology include the development of security and confidentiality preserving solutions to protect individual integrity and research data ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Using software agents to preserve individual health data confidentiality in micro-scale geographical analyses |journal=J Biomed Inform |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=160–70 |date=April 2006 |pmid=16098819 |doi=10.1016/j.jbi.2005.06.003 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1532-0464(05)00056-0|name-list-format=vanc|author1 = Kamel Boulos MN|author2 = Cai Q|author3=Padget JA |author4=Rushton G |authorlink1=Maged N.

Accurate security programmes and firewalls are a critical condition for handling personal records over the Internet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12587">'''Euro Health Consumer Index''' ('''EHCI''') is a comparison of [[Healthcare in Europe|European health care system]]s based on waiting times, results, and generosity. The information is presented as a graphic index. EHCI was produced 2005–2009 and 2012–2016 by [[Health Consumer Powerhouse]]. The 2014 ranking included 37 countries measured by 48 indicators.  It claims to measure the "consumer friendliness" of healthcare systems. It does not claim to measure which European state has the best healthcare system, but it does produce specialist Indexes on Diabetes, Cardiac Care, HIV, Headache and Hepatitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Outcomes in EHCI 2015|url=http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/EHCI_2015/EHCI_2015_report.pdf|accessdate=27 January 2016|publisher=Health Consumer Powerhouse|date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006 France was the champion with 768 points out of 1000. In the 2015 results the same performance would have given the 13th position among 35 countries because of the widespread improvements in standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EHCI: European healthcare steadily improving|url=http://www.news-medical.net/news/20160128/EHCI-European-healthcare-steadily-improving.aspx|accessdate=28 January 2016|publisher=News Medical.net|date=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas no bias in favour of any health system was alleged, the index was criticised in the [[British Medical Journal]] by [[Martin McKee]] and others from the [[European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies]] in February 2016.  Points they made included:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cylus|first1=Jonathan|last2=Nolte|first2=Ellen|last3=Figueras|first3=Josep|last4=McKee|first4=Martin|title=What, if anything, does the EuroHealth Consumer Index actually tell us?|journal=BMJ|date=9 February 2016|url=http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2016/02/09/what-if-anything-does-the-eurohealth-consumer-index-actually-tell-us/|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The index is constructed by scoring performance as good, intermediary or not-so-good, based on arbitrary cut-off points. 
* There is no logic in how many points are allocated to each indicator.  225 points are allocated to accessibility, but only 250 to health outcomes.
* The indicators are a  mix of trends over time and cross-sectional rankings.

'''Flue-cured tobacco''' is a type of [[cigarette]] [[tobacco]]. Along with [[burley tobacco]], it accounts for more than 90% of US tobacco production. Flue-cured farming is centered in [[North Carolina]]. Production was limited by national marketing quotas and [[acreage allotment]]s. It was eligible for nonrecourse price support loans until 2005, when the quota buyout program ended these programs (PL 108-357, Title VI).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6743">'''Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy''' is a method of [[psychotherapy]] based strictly on [[Gestalt psychology]]. Its origins go back to the 1920s when Gestalt psychology founder [[Max Wertheimer]], [[Kurt Lewin]] and their colleagues and students started to apply the holistic and systems theoretical Gestalt psychology concepts in the field of [[psychopathology]] and clinical psychology&lt;ref&gt;cf. Michael Wertheimer, K. Crochetière, N. Vicker, J. Parker &amp; D.B. King: Gestalt Theory and Psychopathology, ''Gestalt Theory 23'' (2/2001), 144-154; Michael Wertheimer &amp; V. Sarris: Max Wertheimer's Research on Aphasia and Brain Disorders, ''Gestalt Theory 23'' (4/2001), 267-277; Joseph de Rivera: ''Field Theory As Human-Science: Contributions of Lewin's Berlin Group'', Gardner Press (June 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; Many developments in psychotherapy in the following decades drew from these early beginnings, like e.g. group psychoanalysis (S. Foulkes),  [[Gestalt therapy]] (Laura and Fritz Perls Goodman and others), or Katathym-imaginative Psychotherapy (Hanscarl Leuner). In Europe Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy in its own right has been initiated and formulated on this basis by the German Gestalt [[psychologist]] and psychotherapist [[Hans-Jürgen Walter|Hans-Jürgen P. Walter]] and his colleagues in Germany and Austria. Walter, a student of Gestalt psychologist Friedrich Hoeth, was influenced to form the core of his theoretical concept on the basis of the work of Gestalt theorists [[Max Wertheimer]], [[Wolfgang Köhler]], [[Kurt Koffka]], [[Kurt Lewin]], and [[Wolfgang Metzger]]. Walter’s first publication on Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy came out in 1977 ''Gestalttheorie und Psychotherapie'' (Gestalt Theory and Psychotherapy), which is now on its third edition (1994). The majority of the extensive literature on Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy which has been published in the decades since then is in the German language. However, Walter's articles ''Cognitive Behavior Therapy and Gestalt-Theoretical Psychotherapy'' and ''What do Gestalt therapy and Gestalt theory have to do with each other?'' have been  published also in English, as well as [[Gerhard Stemberger]]'s more recent introductory article ''Diagnostics in Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy''. 

Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy in this form has gained popularity predominately in German speaking countries.&lt;ref name="Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy|url=http://www.gestalttheory.net/cms/index.php?page=gt-psychotherapy|website=Gestalt Theory|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is officially approved by the Austrian government as a scientific psychotherapy method under the Austrian Psychotherapy Act. 

One of the most striking characteristics of Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy is the key role of the [[epistemology|epistemological]] grounding position of Gestalt theory ([[critical realism (philosophy of perception)|critical realism]]) and its applicability to the fundamental, theoretical, and practical problems in psychotherapy. In Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy this is closely bound up with the basic methodological approach ([[holism|holistic]], [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]], [[experiment]]al) of Gestalt theory, its system theoretical approach, and its specific psychophysical and psychological approach. 

Gerhard Stemberger’s ''Diagnostics in Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy'', provides insight into the concept and process of Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy. The Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy therapeutic process is a relationship between two individuals in which both the therapist and client develop an egalitarian attitude. An egalitarian attitude is the concept that everyone is equal. The diagnostic process and the therapeutic process are inseparable to Gestalt theoretical psychotherapists. The therapist is responsible for supporting the client in discovering their specific and individual feelings and problems. Gestalt theoretical psychotherapists believe that an individual cannot be forced into doing things that are against the individual’s nature; therefore it is crucial for the therapist to adapt diagnostic exploration to the individual’s capabilities. The therapeutic process requires no strict or set schedule, and the speed of the process varies for each individual. “[[Force-field  analysis]]”, a concept from Kurt Lewin, is a phenomenological procedure in which the therapist and client look for opportunities to explore specific attributes of the client’s life space, their driving forces, and barriers. This can occur in therapy through dialogue, allowing the client to experience their feelings through speaking. The anthropological model in Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy is the belief that the therapist should not only focus on ‘inner components’ of the client, but also focus on the interaction between the client and their environment that effect their experience and behavior.&lt;ref name=Stemberger&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stemberger|first1=Gerhard|title=Diagnostics in Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy|journal=Psychotherapeutic Diagnostics - Guidelines for the new standard|date=2008|pages=97-108|url=https://www.academia.edu/4762581/Diagnostics_in_Gestalt_Theoretical_Psychotherapy_2008_|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy is related to but different from [[Fritz Perls]]' [[Gestalt therapy]] in its theoretical foundation. Mary Henle has pointed out the differences between Gestalt theory in its original sense and the Perls'ian understanding of Gestalt.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Mary Henle]] (1975): ''Gestalt Psychology and Gestalt Therapy'' http://gestalttheory.net/archive/henle.html'', 15.08.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
With her analysis however, she restricts herself explicitly to only three of Perls' books from 1969 and 1972, leaving out Perls' earlier work, and Gestalt therapy in general as a psychotherapy method.&lt;ref&gt;See Barlow criticizing Henle: Allen R. Barlow: [http://www.gestalt.org/barlow.htm ''Gestalt Therapy and Gestalt Psychology. Gestalt – Antecedent Influence or Historical Accident''], in: ''The Gestalt Journal'', Volume IV, Number 2, Fall, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;
It must also be mentioned that Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy adopts techniques from Gestalt therapy as Walter points out.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Jürgen Walter: ''Gestalttheorie und Psychotherapie'', Darmstadt 1977, p. 170ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7518">The '''Global Polio Eradication Initiative''' is an initiative created in 1988, just after the [[World Health Assembly]] resolved to [[Poliomyelitis eradication|eradicate the disease poliomyelitis]] by the year 2000. It was described by the [[World Health Organization]] as the largest public health initiative in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hale/Held|first1=Thomas/David|title=The Handbook of Transnational Governance: Institutions and Innovations|publisher=Polity press|isbn=978-0-7456-5060-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy==
The strategy for the eradication of polio rests on immunizing every at risk child until there is no one left for the disease to transmit to and the disease eventually dies out. The Initiative is spearheaded by the following Organizations:

*WHO ([[World Health Organization]]) who are responsible for planning, technical direction, surveillance and eradication certification. 
*[[Rotary International]] whose responsibilities include fundraising, advocacy, and volunteer recruitment.
* The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] who are in charge of deploying scientists and public health experts to WHO and [[UNICEF]].
* [[UNICEF]] is in charge of the distribution of the vaccine and helping countries develop communication and awareness strategies.
* [[The Gates Foundation]] as well provided a large portion of the funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unicef's Engagement in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative|url=http://www.unicef.org/partners/files/Partnership_profile_2012_Polio_revised.pdf|website=Unicef.org|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key tactics used by the GPEI include strengthening childhood immunization through oral vaccines, conducting surveillance 
through investigation of [[acute flaccid paralysis]] cases among children under 15 years old (in order to determine areas where the virus is truly eradicated), and conducting "mop up" campaigns in areas where cases of polio have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wassilak/Orenstein|first1=Steven/Walter|title=Challenges faced by the global polio eradication initiative|journal=Expert Review of Vaccines|date=2010|doi=10.1586/erv.10.45|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1586/erv.10.45|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
By 2012 the GPEI had raised 9 billion dollars in funding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study on the Impact of Polio Eradication on Strengthening (Routine Immunization and Primary Health Care|url=http://sites.middlebury.edu/polio_eradication_impacts_study/files/2012/12/Fact-Sheet-Polio-Eradication-Impacts-Study.pdf|publisher=Middlebury College|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in alone 2011 the GPEI received a 1.1 billion dollars, for a budget of 0.98 billion dollars. 30% of their funding came from the [[Gates Foundation]] 30% from developed governments, 27% from countries at risk of polio, and the rest was made up of donations from non profits, private funders, and other foundations. It is likely that the GPEI will become almost entirely funded by private organizations in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vaccination funding landscape|url=http://www.givewell.org/international/charities/vaccination-organizations#Eradicationinitiatives|website=Givewell.org|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation==
In 1995 a Global Certification Commission was created to oversee the certification of the eradication of wild-type poliovirus transmissions. Certification for the six WHO regions requires all of the countries in that region to be certified by the commission. By the year 2000 both the regions of the Western Pacific and the Americas met the criteria to be certified free of polio transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Technical Consultative Group to the World Health Organization on the Global Eradication of Poliomyelitis|title="Endgame" Issues for the Global Polio Eradication Initiative|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|date=2002|volume=34|pages=72–77|doi=10.1086/338262|url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/1/72.abstract|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012 the initial number of estimated cases in 1988 of 350,000 across 125 endemic countries has dropped to 650 confirmed cases. In addition the 3 of the six WHO regions are now certified polio eradicated (Europe, the Americas, The West Pacific). [[India]], which many thought would face the greatest challenge to eradication was removed from the list of endemic countries. According to the most recent study by the GPEI, in 2016, there are only three countries still listed as endemic, [[Nigeria]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Monitoring|url=http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Poliocasesworldwide.aspx|website=Global Polio Eradication Initiative|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is owing to this dramatic reduction that the funding for the GPEI will likely soon come entirely from private donors and foundations such as the [[Gates Foundation]] instead of from individual countries. In fact [[Bill Gates]] has listed polio eradication as one of his "Top Personal Priorities".

A 2011 study by [[Middlebury College]] (commissioned by the [[Gates Foundation]]) indicated a list recommendations for how the GPEI should operate moving forward:

*  Include surveillance for other diseases in AFP (polio) surveillance systems
* Use integrated campaigns to reach marginalized populations
* Standardize and compile polio’s maps of marginalized populations to provide them with additional services
* Fund routine immunization in locations with frequent polio campaigns
* Build staff capacity in a variety of areas beyond polio
* Share pertinent information gathered during polio campaigns with other health programs
* Add questions on key health indicators of interest to post campaign monitoring
* Communicate to workers why repeated campaigns are necessary in high intensity areas
* Raise monetary incentives for campaign workers to a living wage or eliminate them entirely
* Conduct cross planning sessions to determine how programs and services can be integrated to reduce workforce burden without compromising programmatic objectives
* Conduct polio campaigns only where and when they are necessary
*  Mitigate the most serious effects of service interruption with strategic planning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study on the Impact of Polio Eradication on Strengthening (Routine Immunization and Primary Health Care|url=http://sites.middlebury.edu/polio_eradication_impacts_study/files/2012/12/Fact-Sheet-Polio-Eradication-Impacts-Study.pdf|publisher=Middlebury College|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endgame==
The final steps of polio eradication for the GPEI, or what is known as the "endgame" are as follows:
#  Detect and interrupt all poliovirus transmissions
# Strengthen immunization systems and withdraw oral polio vaccine
#  Contain poliovirus and certify interruption of transmission
# Ensure the remaining investments made to eradicate polio go to the greater cause of improving global health&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan 2013–2018|url=http://www.polioeradication.org/resourcelibrary/strategyandwork.aspx|website=Polio Eradication Initiative|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Calhan Colorado High School Gymnasium by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Calhan High School gymnasium in [[Calhan, Colorado]]]]

A '''gymnasium''', also known as a '''gym''', is a covered location for [[gymnastics]], [[Athletics (physical culture)|athletics]], and gymnastic services.  The word is derived from the ancient Greek [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|''gymnasium'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Partridge|1984|p=517}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are commonly found in athletic and fitness centers, and as activity and [[learning space]]s in educational institutions.  "Gym" is also slang for "[[fitness center]]", which is often an area for indoor recreation.

Gymnasia apparatus such as barbells, parallel bars, jumping board, running path, tennis-balls, cricket field, fencing area, and so forth are used as exercises. In safe weather, outdoor locations are the most conducive to health.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ravenstein|Hulley|1867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gyms were popular in ancient Greece. Their curricula included Gymnastica militaria or self-defense, gymnastica medica, or physical therapy to help the sick and injured, and gymnastica athletica for physical fitness and sports, from boxing to dancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Partington|1838|p=627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These gymnasia also had teachers of wisdom and philosophy. Community gymnastic events were done as part of the celebrations during various village festivals. In ancient Greece there was a phrase of contempt, "He can neither swim nor write." After a while, however, Olympic athletes began training in buildings specifically designed for them. Community sports never became as popular among ancient Romans as it had among the ancient Greeks. Gyms were used more as a preparation for military service or spectator sports. During the Roman Empire, the gymnastic art was forgotten. In the Dark Ages there were sword fighting tournaments and of chivalry; and after gunpowder was invented sword fighting began to be replaced by the sport of fencing. There were schools of dagger fighting and wrestling and boxing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Partington|1838|p=628}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in the 18th century, Salzmann, German clergyman, opened a gym in Thuringia teaching bodily exercises, including running and swimming. Clias and Volker established gyms in London, and in 1825, Doctor Beck, a German immigrant, established the first gymnasium in the United States. It was found that gym pupils lose interest in doing the same exercises, partly because of age. Variety in exercises included skating, dancing, and swimming. Some gym activities can be done by 6 to 8 year-olds while age 16 has been considered mature enough for boxing and horseback riding.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Partington|1838|p=629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Greece]], the ''[[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasion]]'' (γυμνάσιον) was a locality for both physical and intellectual [[education]] of young men. The latter meaning of intellectual education persisted in [[Greek language|Greek]], [[German language|German]] and other languages to denote a certain type of school providing [[secondary education]], the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], whereas in [[English language|English]] the meaning of physical education pertained in the word 'gym'.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The Greek word ''gymnasium'' means "school for naked exercise" and was used to designate a locality for the [[education]] of young men, including physical education (''[[gymnastics]]'', i.e. exercise) which was customarily performed naked, as well as [[bathing]], and studies. For the Greeks, physical education was considered as important as cognitive learning. Most Greek ''gymnasia'' had libraries that could be utilized after relaxing in the baths.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==History==
[[File:Amsterdam - Gymnasium - 0591.jpg|thumb|right|Inside a gymnasium in Amsterdam]]
The first recorded gymnasiums date back to over 3000 years ago in ancient [[Persia]], where they were known as ''[[Pahlevani and zoorkhaneh rituals|zurkhaneh]]'', areas that encouraged physical fitness. The larger [[Thermae|Roman Baths]] often had attached fitness facilities, the baths themselves sometimes being decorated with [[mosaic]]s of local champions of sport. Gyms (''i.e''., places for gymnastics) in [[Germany]] were an outgrowth of the ''Turnplatz'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-turnplatz-open-air-gymnasium-in-the-hasenheide-1811-48390278.html|title=Stock Photo - Turnplatz (open-air gymnasium) in the Hasenheide, 1811|last=Limited|first=Alamy|website=Alamy|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; an outdoor space for gymnastics, which was promoted by German educator [[Friedrich Jahn]] and the [[Turners]], a nineteenth-century political and gymnastic movement. The first indoor gymnasium in Germany was probably the one built in [[Hesse]] in 1852 by Adolph Spiess, an enthusiast for boys' and girls' gymnastics in schools.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

[[File:Gville UF Florida Gym01.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Florida Gymnasium]] at the [[University of Florida]]]]
Through worldwide colonization, Great Britain expanded its national interest in sports and games to many countries. In the 1800s, programs were added to schools and college curricula that emphasized health, strength, and bodily measure. Sports drawn from European and British cultures thrived as college students and upper-class clubs financed competition. As a result, towns began building playgrounds that furthered interest in sports and physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to physical education, exercise science, and sport studies|last=Lumpkin|first=Angela|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education; 9 edition|date=January 29, 2013|isbn=0078022665|location=|pages=226|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], the Turner movement thrived in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The first Turners group was formed in London in 1848. The Turners built gymnasia in several cities like Cincinnati and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] which had large [[German American]] populations. These gyms were utilized by adults and youth. For example, a young [[Lou Gehrig]] would frequent the Turner gym in [[New York City]] with his father.
[[File:ErfgoedLeiden LEI001015553 Gymnastiekzaal van de Gymnastiekschool aan de Pieterskerkgracht in Leiden.jpeg|thumb|220x220px|Interior of a gym in The Netherlands, around 1900]]
The [[Boston Young Men's Christian Union]] claims to be "America's First Gym". The [[YMCA]] first organized in [[Boston]] in 1851 and a smaller branch opened in Rangasville in 1852. Ten years later there were some two hundred YMCAs across the country, most of which provided gymnasia for exercise, games, and social interaction.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The 1920s was a decade of prosperity that witnessed the building of large numbers of public high schools with a gymnasium, an idea founded by Nicolas Isaranga. Over the course of the 20th century, gymnasia have been reconceptualized to accommodate the popular team and individual games and sports that have supplanted gymnastics in the school [[curriculum]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Today, gymnasia are commonplace in the United States. They are in virtually all U.S. [[colleges]] and [[high school]]s, as well as almost all [[middle school]]s and [[elementary school]]s. These facilities are used for [[physical education]], [[intramural sports]], and school gatherings. The number of gyms in the U.S. has more than doubled since the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title="The Scope of the U.S. Health Club Industry (industry estimates)."|journal=International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association (IHRSA). 2003.|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Haukilahti water tower''' is located in [[Haukilahti]] in southern [[Espoo]], [[Finland]]. The water tower was built in 1968 and owned by the Espoo waterworks. The diameter of the tower is 45.3 m and its volume is 4000 m³. The height of the tower is 45.3 m and from sea level 76.3 m.

In the top part of the water tower is a [[restaurant]] called Haikaranpesä ("Stork's nest"). It is a very popular restaurant and many business people and tourists go there to eat {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. A scene of the Finnish [[film]] ''[[Black Ice (2007 film)|Musta jää]]'' was filmed in the restaurant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8685">[[File:JPII 29-09-2004 portret.jpg|thumb|right|John Paul II during a general audience on 29 September 2004]]

'''[[Pope John Paul II]]''' entered the [[papacy]] in 1978 as an avid [[Sportsperson|sportsman]], enjoying [[hiking]] and [[human swimming|swimming]].  The 58-year-old was extremely [[healthy]] and active for his age, [[jogging]] in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]] gardens to the horror of Vatican staff, who informed him that his jogging could be seen by [[tourist]]s climbing to the summit of the [[dome]] of St. Peter's [[Basilica]]. The [[pope]]'s response, according to media reports, was "so what?"  When the cost of installing a [[swimming pool]] in his summer residence was queried by [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s, John Paul joked that it was "cheaper than another [[Papal conclave|conclave]]".

John Paul's obvious physical fitness and looks earned much comment in the media following his election, which compared his health and trim figure to the poor health of [[John Paul I]] and [[Paul VI]], the portliness of [[Pope John XXIII]] and the constant claims of ailments of [[Pius XII]]. The only modern pope with a keep-fit regime had been [[Pope Pius XI]] (r: 1922-1939) who was an avid mountain climber. An ''[[Irish Independent]]'' article in the 1980s labelled John Paul "the keep-fit pope".

However, after over twenty-five years on the papal throne, two [[assassination]] attempts (one of which resulted in severe physical injury to the Pope), and a number of [[cancer]] scares, John Paul's physical health declined.

==1981 assassination attempt==
{{main|Pope John Paul II assassination attempt}}
The 1981 assassination attempt was costlier to his overall health than was generally known by the public at the time. Rushed to the [[Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic]] to undergo emergency [[surgery]], he experienced profound [[bleeding]] leading to a dangerous fall in [[blood pressure]] and to [[cardiac arrest]], which was however successfully [[defibrillation|defibrillated]]. He received the [[Anointing of the Sick]] (formerly known as "Last Rites"). Despite difficulties with extensive [[blood transfusion]]s, which are speculated to have transmitted [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) infection, surgery was eventually successful. The bullet had passed completely through the body, puncturing the [[intestine]]s and necessitating a [[colostomy]]. Seven weeks later, discussions were held about reversing the colostomy and eight of nine doctors voted against it, arguing the Pope was still too weak from the CMV infection. Saying "I don't want to continue half dead and half alive", the Pope effectively overruled his [[physician]]s and the reversal was done successfully on August 5, 1981.

==Later years==
Despite the shooting and the complications during recovery, John Paul remained in good physical condition throughout the 1980s, and remained active as well. During the 1990s John Paul's health began to decline. A benign intestinal tumor was removed in 1992; he experienced two falls in 1993 and 1994 which dislocated his shoulder and broke his femur respectively; and he underwent an appendectomy in 1996. In December 1995, he had to suspend his ''[[urbi et orbi]]'' blessing on Christmas Day after a dizzy spell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/video/video-142161.html | accessdate=27 November 2018 | title=Tagesschau vor 20 Jahren, 25. Dezember 1995 | work=Tagesschau | location=Germany | date=25 December 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Orthopedic surgery|orthopaedic surgeon]] confirmed in 2001 that Pope John Paul II was suffering from [[Parkinson's disease]], as international observers had suspected for some time; this was acknowledged publicly by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] in 2003. Despite difficulty speaking more than a few sentences at a time, trouble [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]] and severe [[osteoarthrosis]], he continued to tour the world, although rarely walking in public. Some of those who met him late in his life said that although physically he was in poor shape, mentally he remained fully alert.

However, that claim was disputed by among others [[Rowan Williams]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and [[Mary McAleese]], the [[President of Ireland]], in their accounts of meetings with him in 2003. After John Paul II's death, Williams told ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' of a meeting with the Pope, during which he had paid tribute to one of John Paul's [[encyclical]]s. According to Williams, John Paul II showed no recognition {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. An aide whispered in the pope's ear, but was overheard reminding John Paul about the encyclical.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} However the Pope still showed no recognition. Papal critic [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]] claimed that, after Williams and his entourage left, the Pope turned to an aide and asked "tell me, who were those people?"&lt;ref name="JohnCornwell"&gt;John Cornwell, The Pope in Winter: The Dark Side of John Paul II's Papacy (Penguin, 2005) p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Cornwell, Mary McAleese told the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] newspaper ''[[The Universe (Catholic newspaper)|The Universe]]'' of a visit as President of Ireland to John Paul where he struggled to talk about the [[Irish College]] in [[Rome]], where [[Irish people|Irish]] seminarians in the city are trained and to which the Pope prior to his election had often travelled. "He wanted to be reminded of where the Irish College was, and when he heard that it was very close to [[Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano|St. John Lateran]]'s basilica he wanted to be reminded where that was too."&lt;ref name="JohnCornwell" /&gt;

==Final days==
On 1 February 2005, the Pope was taken to the [[Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic|Gemelli Hospital]] suffering from acute [[inflammation]] and [[spasm]] of the [[larynx]], brought on by a bout of [[influenza]]. He was released, but in late February 2005 he began having trouble breathing, and he was rushed back. A [[tracheotomy]] was performed, allowing him to breathe more easily, but limiting his speaking ability, to which he reacted with evident frustration during a failed attempt at public speaking from the window of the hospital ward.

On [[Palm Sunday]] (20 March 2005) the Pope made a brief appearance at his window and silently waved an [[olive branch]] to [[pilgrim]]s. Two days later there were renewed concerns for his health after reports stated that he had taken a turn for the worse and was not responding to medication. By the end of the month, speculation was growing. The Vatican officials confirmed that he was nearing death when on March 31, 2005 at around 11:00 am, the pope, who had gone to the chapel to celebrate Mass, was beset by strong shivers which was followed by high fever because of a [[urinary tract infection]]. Despite the use of [[antibiotics]], the disease continues and he developed [[sepsis]] and [[multiple organ failure]]. He was not rushed to the hospital again, however, and equipment for medical monitoring was brought to his residence in the Vatican, where he was followed by a team of top physicians. On April 2 at 9:37 pm, he died in his apartment on 2 April 2005 at 84 years and 319 days of age, 46 days before his 85th birthday. The pope is reported to have died looking towards the window as he prayed, raising his right hand as if he is aware of the crowds present in [[St. Peter's Square]] where he made an effort to say "Amen" and his life ended. The illumination of a third light in the papal apartment makes some onlookers in the square knew that the end had come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2015/04/02/how-we-reported-the-death-of-st-john-paul-ii/|title=How we reported the death of St John Paul II|accessdate=6 June 2018|work=''Catholic Herald''|date=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His death was confirmed when an electrocardiogram signal remained [[flatline|flat]] for more than 20 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://zenit.org/articles/septic-shock-and-heart-failure-cited-in-death/|title=Septic Shock and Heart Failure Cited in Death|accessdate=6 May 2018|work=''Zenit News Agency''|date=3 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pope was the third-longest serving Pope ever in history, after the first Pope [[St. Peter]] and [[Pope Pius IX]]. He died after 26 years and 162 days of papacy. He was buried in presence of millions on 8 April 2005.

==Costs==
In the early 1970s, the Ministry of Heath was heavily subsidized by foreign aid. However, by 1977, health programs had been so successful that US Aid for International Development in the sector was ended, as the country was found "too healthy" to continue being a recipient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Lynn M.|date=Spring 1987|title=Health without Wealth?

[[File:CCSS - Costa Rica.gif|thumb|[[Costa Rican Social Security Fund]] Logo]]
{{see also|List of hospitals in Costa Rica}}
The '''[[Costa Rican Social Security Fund]]''' or ''Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social'' (as it is known in Spanish) is in charge of most of the nation's public health sector. Its role in public health (as the administrator of health institutions) is key in Costa Rica, playing an important part in the state's national health policy making.  Worker and employer contribution are mandated by law, under the principle of solidarity.  Workers need to be cover by a  "poliza de riesgo del trabajo" an insurance policy that complements the health care provided by the "Caja" for injuries related to labor risks.

Caja services are guaranteed to all residents, including the uninsured.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Cercone, James, Etoile Pinder, Jose Pacheco Jimenez, and Rodrigo Bricena. "Impact of Health Insurance on Access, Use, and Health Status in Costa Rica." ''The Impact of Health Insurance in Low-and Middle-Income Countries'', edited by Maria-Luisa Escobar, Charles C. Griffin, and R. Paul Shaw, Brookings Institution Press, Washington, D.C., 2010, pp. 89-105.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 this was expanded to include undocumented immigrants as well, which constituted up to 8% of the population at the time. The percent of residents with health insurance increased gradually, as the program was originally only intended for urban workers. It was not until 1961 that universal mandatory coverage became a stated goal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After reaching a peak of 92% coverage in 1990, rates have remained around 88%. 12% of the insured are low-income residents who are eligible to have their coverage paid entirely by the state, based on a means-test. 87% of the uninsured enter a hospital via the emergency room, compared to only 58% of the insured.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Emergency care is provided free of charge to all residents.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This governmental entity's functions encompass both the administrative and functional aspects. It has the obligation (as a public institution) to formulate and execute health programs that are both preventive (such as: [[vaccination]], informational, [[fumigation]], etc.) and healing (such as: [[surgery]], [[radiation therapy]], [[pharmacy]], [[Clinical medicine|clinical]], etc.) in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.ccss.sa.cr/portal/page/portal/Gerencia_Administrativa/Funciones|title=CCSS {{!}} Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social: Funciones|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225102233/http://portal.ccss.sa.cr/portal/page/portal/Gerencia_Administrativa/Funciones|archive-date=25 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Services "are aimed disproportionately" toward underprivileged Nicaraguan and Colombian immigrants and indigenous communities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Spending is relatively progressive, with the poorest quintile receiving 29% of spending while the richest quintile only receives 11%.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2000, 90% of the country's doctors were employed by the public sector, but 1/3 of those also maintained a private practice.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During the decade of the 1990s the percentage of all medical staff (not just doctors) who worked in the private sector increased from 10% to almost 25%.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As more doctors opt for the more profitable field of private practice, especially in relation to medical tourism, the government has resorted to hiring around 100 Cuban doctors annually to work in the public sector, as of 2010.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Alongside universal health care the government also provides basic dental care. However, this does not include most orthodontic procedures, such as braces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://usaherald.com/costa-rica-dental-clinic-provides-free-dental-care-children-need/|title=Costa Rica Dental Clinic Provides Free Dental Care to Children in Need – USA Herald|date=2017-11-13|work=USA Herald|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== EBAIS ===

The Equipos Báscios de Atención Integral en Salud (EBAIS), or Comprehensive Basic Health Care Team, began operating in 1995, under control of the Social Security Fund. The program had been proposed two years earlier by a bipartisan committee of experts set up by the president to redress decreases in the quality of services that had occurred over the preceding decade.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The goal of the program is to ensure that all citizens have access to medical care, including rural residents. EBAIS employees are divided into teams of about five members, including one doctor. Team members visit people at their homes to vaccinate, offer medical advice, check vitals, and dispense medication. They also rectify any standing water situations they observe, which otherwise act as breeding grounds for mosquitoes and their associated diseases.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; EBAIS designates certain residences as high-risk due to subs-standard housing and amenities or risky health conditions (eg. teenage pregnancy). Members also address the health of patients' pets, such as ensuring that they are up to date on all necessary vaccinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.psu.edu/story/338473/2014/12/16/academics/students-travel-costa-rica-study-health-care-system|title=Students travel to Costa Rica to study health care system {{!}} Penn State University|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are nearly 1,000 teams, each overseeing the health of 3,500-4,000 individuals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

After an original rejection, $9 million was later granted for the creation of EBAIS by the World Bank. The rest of the $50 million price tag was paid for by the Social Security Fund.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''Costa Rican Social Security Fund''' is also charged with the administration of the public pension system.

==Private==
{{see also|Medical tourism#Costa Rica}}
Costa Rica is a popular destination for [[medical tourism]] because of the beautiful surroundings, low costs, abundance of bilingual medical personnel, and medical reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Walecia Kinrad| title = Going Abroad to Find Affordable Health Care| publisher = New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/21/health/21patient.html|date = March 20, 2009|accessdate = 2010-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 40,000 Americans come to the country annually as medical tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thecostaricanews.com/costa-rica-country-loved-expats/|title=Costa Rica: A Country Loved by Expats {{!}} The Costa Rica News|last=Canelo|first=Abelardo|date=2017-12-05|work=The Costa Rica News|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private insurance plans are available through the government-owned insurance company(INS). Private plans include dental work, optometry, well-visits and annual check-ups. 80% of the costs are covered for prescription drugs, certain medical exams, sick visits and hospitalization. Surgeon and aesthetician costs are covered at full cost. Currently, private medical insurance costs about $60–$250/month per person, depending on gender, age, other factors.&lt;ref name="bare_url_a" /&gt; Reasons for opting for private health care include shorter wait times and the ability to choose one's doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thecostaricanews.com/costa-rica-curious-facts/|title=Costa Rica's Curious Facts {{!}} The Costa Rica News|last=Barrera|first=Gilberto|date=2017-12-04|work=The Costa Rica News|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 30% of the population utilizes private health services at least once a year, according to surveys.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Costa Rica has three internationally accredited private hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Chrissie Long|title = Why Rush Limbaugh would go to Costa Rica if Obama's healthcare plan passes|publisher = Christian Science Monitor|url = http://www.csmonitor.com/World/2010/0311/Why-Rush-Limbaugh-would-go-to-Costa-Rica-if-Obama-s-healthcare-plan-passes|date = March 11, 2010|accessdate = 2010-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The four largest private hospitals in Costa Rica are CIMA in the suburbs of San Jose, Clínica Biblica in the center of San Jose, Clínica Católica and Hospital Clinica UNIBE in the suburbs of San Jose.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Care in Costa Rica Hospital Clínica UNIBE (Universidad de Iberoamerica)|url=http://www.costa-rica-forum-cosmetic-plastic-surgery.com/57-hospitals-in-costa-rica-hospital-cl%C3%ADnica-unibe.html|publisher=Plastic Surgery Forums Costa Rica|accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic private health insurance was not legalized until 2006.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; International private insurance companies were not allowed to operate in the country until a Free Trade Agreement was signed with the United States in 2009.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Pharmacy==
Many drugs (like birth control pills, high cholesterol medication, migraine medicine, etc.) are available in Costa Rica without a prescription. Many common problems can be accurately diagnosed and treated by pharmacists. Also, most major pharmacies have a doctor on staff. Most Costa Ricans head to the pharmacy first and consult with the pharmacist or doctor on staff; if he or she can not diagnose you or believe you need further treatment, you will be sent to the hospital.&lt;ref name="bare_url_a" /&gt;

== Childbirth ==
[[Ngöbe]] women are considered "sick" (''bren'') while pregnant, and pregnancy is almost never discussed, even during birth. When the baby is deemed healthy, people consider it safe to acknowledge the pregnancy. Many women have traditionally given birth in their homes, with the help of their mother or a [[midwife]]. The government has established some women's clinics in Ngobe territory, seeking to improve women's health.

'''Hilal Ahmar''' ({{lang-ar|الهلال الأحمر}}, {{lang-fa|هلال احمر}}, {{lang-tr|Hilâl-i Ahmer}},{{lang-ur|ہلالِ احمر}}) means ''Red Crescent'' in English. Hilal Ahmar is a [[charitable organization|charity]]; the equivalent of the [[International Red Cross]]. 

The Hilal e Ahmar was renamed the ''Kızılay Derneği'' in [[Turkey]] in 1935. 
Red Crescent society in [[Pakistan]] is still called Anjuman e Hilal e Ahmar Pakistan. It was founded on December 20, 1947 by the founder of Pakistan, [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18331">The concept of excessive [[selfishness]] has been recognized throughout history. The term "[[narcissism]]" is derived from the [[Greek mythology]] of [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]], but was only coined at the close of the nineteenth century.

Since then, narcissism has become a household word; in analytic literature, given the great preoccupation with the subject, the term is used more than almost any other'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Neville Symington]], ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 1990) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of narcissism has changed over time. Today narcissism "refers to an interest in or concern with the self along a broad continuum, from healthy to pathological ... including such concepts as self-esteem, self-system, and self-representation, and true or false self".&lt;ref name=Ronningstam&gt;{{cite book|last=Ronningstam, Ed.|first=Elsa|title=Disorders of Narcissism: Diagnostic, Clinical, and Empirical Implications|year=2000|publisher=Jason Aronson|isbn=978-0765702593|page=53|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DHDD3yoVixUC&amp;dq=%22Walter+Mitty%22+narcissism&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before Freud==

Narcissus was a handsome Greek youth who rejected the desperate advances of the [[nymph]] [[Echo (mythology)|Echo]]. As punishment, he was doomed to fall in love with his own reflection in a pool of water. Unable to consummate his love, Narcissus 'lay gazing enraptured into the pool, hour after hour',&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Graves]], in Symington, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and finally pined away, changing into a flower that bears his name, the [[Narcissus (plant)|narcissus]].

The story was retold in Latin by [[Ovid]] in his [[Metamorphoses]], in which form it would have great influence on medieval and Renaissance culture. 'Ovid's tale of Echo and Narcissus...weaves in and out of most of the English examples of the Ovidian narrative poem';&lt;ref&gt;Colin Burrow ed., ''William Shakespeare: The Complete Sonnets and Poems'' (Oxford 2002) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and 'allusions to the story of Narcissus...play a large part in the poetics of the [[Shakespeare's Sonnets|Sonnets]]'&lt;ref&gt;Burrow ed., p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; of Shakespeare. Here the term used was '[[self-love]]...Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel'.&lt;ref&gt;Burrow ed., pp. 387 and 383&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Bacon]] used the same term: 'it is the nature of extreme self-lovers, as they will set a house on fire, and it were but to roast their eggs...those that (as [[Cicero]] says of [[Pompey]]) are ''sui amantes sine rivali''...lovers of themselves without rivals'.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Bacon, ''The Essays'' (Penguin 1985) p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Byron]] at the start of the nineteenth century used the same term, describing how, "Self-love for ever creeps out, like a snake, to sting anything which happens...to stumble on it."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Simon Crompton, ''All about Me'' (London 2007) p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Baudelaire]] wrote of 'as vigorous a growth in the heart of natural man as self-love', as well as of those who 'like Narcissuses of fat-headedness...are contemplating the crowd, as though it were a river, offering them their own image'.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Baudelaire, ''The Painter of Modern Life'' (Penguin) p. 49 and p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-century, however, [[egotism]] was perhaps an equally common expression for self-absorption—'egotists...made acutely conscious of a self, by the torture in which it dwells'&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Cowley ed., ''The Portable Hawthorne'' &lt;Penguin 1978) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;—though still with 'curious suggestions of the Narcissus legend'&lt;ref&gt;Cowley ed., "Editor's Introduction" p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; in the background. At the century's close, the term as we now know it finally emerged, with [[Havelock Ellis]], the English [[sexology|sexologist]], writing a short paper in 1927 on its coining, in which he 'argued that the priority should in fact be divided between himself and [[Paul Näcke]], explaining that the term "narcissus-like" had been used by him in 1898 as a description of a psychological attitude, and that Näcke in 1899 had introduced the term ''Narcismus'' to describe a sexual perversion'.&lt;ref&gt;Editor Note, Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 65n1&lt;/ref&gt;

The twentieth century has largely defined the concept in psychological terms, with [[Otto Rank]] publishing in 1911 the first psychoanalytical paper specifically concerned with narcissism, linking it to [[vanity]] and self-admiration.&lt;ref name=millon&gt;Millon, Theodore, Personality Disorders in Modern Life, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sigmund Freud==
{{Main article|Sigmund Freud}}
[[Image:Sigmund Freud, by Max Halberstadt (cropped).jpg|thumb|Sigmund Freud, by Max Halberstadt, 1914]]

[[Ernest Jones]] tells us that 'at a meeting of the Vienna Psycho-Analytical Society on 10 November 1909 [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] had declared that narcissism was a necessary intermediate stage between auto-erotism and object-love'.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Richards, "Editor's Note", Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 110 pp. 61-2&lt;/ref&gt; The following year in his "Leonardo" he described publicly for the first time how 'the growing youngster...finds his love objects on the path of ''narcissism'', since Greek myths call a youth Narcissus, whom nothing pleased so much as his own mirror image'.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Peter Gay, ''Freud; A Life for Our Time'' (London 1989) p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Although Freud only published a single paper exclusively devoted to narcissism called [[On Narcissism|On Narcissism: An Introduction]].,&lt;ref name=freud1&gt;[http://www.english.hawaii.edu/criticalink/narc/guide1.html Freud, Sigmund, On Narcissism: An Introduction], 1914&lt;/ref&gt; in 1914, 'Narcissism was soon to take a central place in his thinking'.&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Primary narcissism ===
Freud suggested that exclusive self-love might not be as abnormal as previously thought and might even be a common component in the human [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]. He argued that narcissism "is the [[libido|libidinal]] complement to the [[Psychological egoism|egoism]] of the [[instinct]] of [[self-preservation]]," or, more simply, the desire and energy that drives one’s [[instinct]] to survive.  He referred to this as ''primary narcissism''.&lt;ref name=freud1 /&gt;

According to Freud, people are born without a sense of themselves as individuals, or [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]. The ego develops during infancy and the early part of childhood, only when the outside world, usually in the form of parental controls and expectations, intrudes upon primary narcissism, teaching the individual about the nature and standards of his [[social environment]] from which he can form the ''[[ego ideal|ideal ego]]'', an image of the perfect [[Self (psychology)|self]] towards which the ego should aspire. 'As it evolved, the ego distanced itself from primary narcissism, formed an ego-ideal, and proceeded to cathect objects'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/narcissism-primary Michel Vincent, "Narcissism, Primary"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud regarded all [[libido|libidinous]] [[Drive theory|drives]] as fundamentally sexual and suggested that ''ego libido'' ([[libido]] directed inwards to the [[Self (psychology)|self]]) cannot always be clearly distinguished from ''object-libido'' (libido directed to persons or objects outside oneself).

An aspect frequently associated with primary narcissism appears in an earlier essay, '[[Totem and Taboo]],'&lt;ref name=freud2&gt;Freud, ''Sigmund, [[Totem and Taboo]]'', 1913&lt;/ref&gt; in which Freud describes his observations of children and primitive people.  What he observed was called [[magical thinking]], such as the belief that a person can impact reality by wishing or willpower.  It demonstrates a belief in the self as powerful and able to change external realities, which Freud believed was part of normal human development.

=== Secondary narcissism ===
According to Freud, ''secondary narcissism'' occurs when the libido withdraws from objects outside the self, above all the mother, producing a relationship to social reality that includes the potential for [[megalomania]]. 'This megalomania has no doubt come into being at the expense of object-libido....This leads us to look upon the narcissism which arises through the drawing on of object-cathexes as a secondary one, superimposed upon a primary narcissism'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; For Freud, while both primary and secondary narcissism emerge in normal human development, problems in the transition from one to the other can lead to pathological narcissistic disorders in adulthood.

"This state of secondary narcissism constituted object relations of the narcissistic type", according to Freud, something he went on to explore further in ''[[Mourning and Melancholia]]''—considered one of Freud's most profound contributions to [[object relations theory]], and constituting the overall principles of object relations and narcissism as concepts.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Grotstein, "Foreword", Symington, pp. x-xi&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Narcissism, relationships and self-worth ===
According to Freud, to care for someone is to convert ego-libido into object-libido by giving some self-love to another person, which leaves less ego-libido available for primary narcissism and protecting and nurturing the self. When that affection is returned so is the libido, thus restoring primary narcissism and self-worth. Any failure to achieve, or disruption of, this balance causes psychological disturbances. In such a case, primary narcissism can be restored only by withdrawing object-libido (also called ''object-love'') to replenish ego-libido.

According to Freud, as a child grows, and his ego develops, he is constantly giving of his self-love to people and objects, the first of which is usually his mother. This diminished self-love should be replenished by the affection and caring returned to him.

==Karen Horney==
{{Main article|Karen Horney}}
[[Image:Karen Horney 1938.jpg|thumb|Karen Horney]]Karen Horney saw narcissism quite differently from Freud, Kohut and other mainstream [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theorists in that she did not posit a primary narcissism but saw the narcissistic personality as the product of a certain kind of early environment acting on a certain kind of temperament. For her, narcissistic needs and tendencies are not inherent in human nature.

Narcissism is different from Horney's other major [[Defence mechanism|defensive strategies]] or solutions in that it is not compensatory. Self-idealization is compensatory in her theory, but it differs from narcissism. All the defensive strategies involve self-idealization, but in the narcissistic solution it tends to be the product of indulgence rather than of deprivation. The narcissist's [[self-esteem]] is not strong, however, because it is not based on genuine accomplishments.&lt;ref name=horney1&gt;Paris, Bernard J, ''Personality and Personal Growth'', edited by Robert Frager and James Fadiman, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heinz Kohut==
{{Main article|Heinz Kohut}}
Heinz Kohut explored further the implications of Freud's perception of narcissism. He maintained that a child will tend to fantasize about having a grandiose [[Self (psychology)|self]] and ideal parents. He claimed that deep down, all people retain a belief in their own perfection and the perfection of anything they are part of. As a person matures, [[grandiosity]] gives way to [[self-esteem]], and the idealization of the parent becomes the framework for core values. It is when [[psychological trauma]] disrupts this process that the most primitive and narcissistic version of the self remains unchanged. Kohut called such conditions [[narcissistic personality disorder]], 'in which the merging with and detaching from an archaic self-object play the central role...narcissistic union with the idealized self-object'.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Kohut, ''The Analysis of the Self'' (Madison 1971) p. 282 and pp. 97-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Kohut suggested narcissism as part of a stage in normal development, in which caregivers provide a strong and protective presence with which the child can identify that reinforces the child's growing sense of self by mirroring his good qualities. If the caregivers fail to provide adequately for their child, the child grows up with a brittle and flawed sense of self.&lt;ref name=kohut1&gt;Kohut, Heinz, ''The Analysis of the Self'', 1971&lt;/ref&gt; 'Kohut's innovative pronouncement...became a veritable manifesto in the United States....The age of "normal narcissism" had arrived'&lt;ref&gt;James L. Grotstein, "Foreword", in Symington, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Kohut also saw beyond the negative and [[pathological]] aspects of narcissism, believing it is a component in the development of resilience, ideals and ambition once it has been transformed by life experiences or analysis&lt;ref name=kohut2&gt;Kohut, Heinz, ''Forms and Transformations of Narcissism'', 1966&lt;/ref&gt;—though critics objected that his theory of how 'we become attached to ideals and values, instead of to our own archaic selves...fits the individual who escapes from bad inner negativity into idealized objects outside'.&lt;ref&gt;Symington, pp. 108-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Otto Kernberg==
{{Main article|Otto Kernberg}}
[[File:Otto F. Kernberg, MD.jpg|thumb|Otto F. Kernberg.]]
Otto Kernberg uses the term ''narcissism'' to refer to the role of [[Self (psychology)|self]] in the regulation of [[self-esteem]].

He believed normal, infantile narcissism depends on the affirmation of others and the acquisition of desirable and appealing objects, which should later develop into healthy, mature self-esteem. This healthy narcissism depends upon an integrated sense of [[Self (psychology)|self]] that incorporates images of the internalized affirmation of those close to the person and is regulated by the [[super ego]] and [[ego ideal]], internal mental structures that assure the person of his worth and that he deserves his own respect.

The failure of infantile narcissism to develop in this healthy adult form becomes a [[pathology]].&lt;ref name=kernberg&gt;Siniscalco, Raffaele [http://www.psychomedia.it/jep/number12-13/kernberg.htm Narcissism. The American Contribution – A Conversation with Otto Kernberg] ''Journal of European Psychoanalysis'', Number 12–13, Winter–Fall 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Object relations theory==
{{Main article|Object relations theory}}
'[[Melanie Klein]]'s...descriptions of infantile [[omnipotence]] and [[megalomania]] provided important insights for the clinical understanding of narcissistic states. In 1963, writing on the psychopathology of narcissism, [[Herbert Rosenfeld]] was especially concerned to arrive at a better definition of object-relationships and their attendant defense mechanisms in narcissism'.&lt;ref name="Michel Vincent, Narcissism"&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/narcissism Michel Vincent, "Narcissism"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[D. W. Winnicott]]'s 'brilliant observations of the mother-child couple [also] throw considerable light on primary narcissism, which in the young child can be viewed as the extension of the mother's narcissism.&lt;ref name="Michel Vincent, Narcissism"/&gt;

==French connections==

[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]—building on Freud's dictum that 'all narcissistic impulses operate from the ego and have their permanent seat in the ego'&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;—used his own concept of the [[mirror stage]] to explore the narcissistic ego in terms of 'the essential structure it derives from its reference to the specular image...narcissism',&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1994) p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; in his battle against [[ego psychology]].

'[[Béla Grunberger]] drew attention to a double orientation of narcissism—as both a need for self-affirmation and a tendency to restore permanent dependency. The active presence of narcissism throughout life led Grunberger to suggest treating it as an autonomous factor (1971)'.&lt;ref name="Michel Vincent, Narcissism"/&gt;

'Under the evocative title ''Life Narcissism, Death Narcissism'' (1983), [[André Green (psychoanalyst)|André Green]] clarified the conflict surrounding the object of narcissism (whether a fantasy object or a real object) in its relationship to the ego. For Green, it was because narcissism affords the ego a certain degree of independence...that a lethal kind of narcissism must be considered, for the object is destroyed at the beginning of this process'; while in a further analysis, 'Green evokes physical narcissism, intellectual narcissism, and moral narcissism'&lt;ref name="Michel Vincent, Narcissism"/&gt;—a set of divisions sometimes simplified into that between 'somatic narcissists who are obsessed with the body...[&amp;] cerebral narcissists—people who build up their sense of magnificence out of an innate feeling of intellectual superiority'.&lt;ref&gt;Crompton, pp. 28-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern diagnosis==
[[Narcissistic personality disorder]] is a condition defined in [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]], but a proposal has been made to remove it from the next edition, [[DSM-5]], instead submerging it as a facet of the antagonism personality type domain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=19 Narcissistic Personality Disorder]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=474 Antagonism]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online usage==

The success of the term ''narcissism'' has led to something of an "inflation of meanings....Some in fact exploited it as a handy term of abuse for modern culture or as a loose synonym for bloated self-esteem."&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 340&lt;/ref&gt;

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a life-threatening disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia accompanied by variable neurological dysfunction, renal failure and fever. It is caused by severely reduced activity of the von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease ADAMTS13. Hereditary TTP, caused by ''ADAMTS13'' gene mutations, is much less common.

Congenital or inherited TTP represents less than 5% of all cases of TTP and the annual incidence is estimated at less than 1/1,000,000. More than 80 different mutations have been identified in families with hereditary TTP.Most patients are carriers of compound heterozygous mutations. Only 15 mutations have been observed in homozygous form, including a homozygous deletion of nucleotides 2930–2935 in exon 23 of ''ADAMTS13''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Romão de Souza|first=Valter|last2=Beatriz Cavalcante de Oliveira|first2=Ana|last3=Maria Vanderlei|first3=Ana|last4=Queiroz da Mota Silveira Aroucha|first4=Amanda|last5=Pontes Duarte|first5=Bruna|last6=Nunes Machado|first6=Aureli|last7=Netto Chaer|first7=Lívia|last8=Wanderley de Barros Correia|first8=Cláudia|last9=da Conceição de Barros Correia|first9=Maria|date=2018-01-22|title=Inherited thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura mimicking immune thrombocytopenic purpura during pregnancy: a case report|journal=Journal of Medical Case Reports|language=En|volume=12|issue=1|pages=15|doi=10.1186/s13256-017-1545-3|issn=1752-1947|pmc=5778757|pmid=29357939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir John Murray''' [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of London|FRS]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] [[FRSGS]] (3 March 1841 – 16 March 1914) was a pioneering British [[oceanographer]], [[marine biologist]] and [[limnologist]]. He is considered to be the father of modern oceanography.&lt;ref name="Waterston"&gt;{{cite book

==Early life and education==
Murray was born at [[Cobourg, Ontario|Cobourg]], [[Canada West]] on 3 March 1841. He was the second son of Elizabeth Macfarlane and Robert Murray, an accountant. His parents had [[emigrate]]d from Scotland to Ontario in about 1834. He went to school in [[London, Ontario]] and later to Cobourg College. In 1858, at the age of seventeen he returned to Scotland to live with his grandfather, John Macfarlane, and continue his education at [[Stirling High School]].  In 1864 he enrolled at [[University of Edinburgh]] to study medicine however he did not complete his studies and did not graduate.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ashworth|first=J.H.|title=Murray, Sir John (1841–1914)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35165|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868 he joined the whaling ship, ''Jan Mayen'', as ship's surgeon and visited [[Spitsbergen]] and [[Jan Mayen Island]].  During the seven-month trip he collected marine specimens and recorded ocean currents, ice movements and the weather.

On his return to [[Edinburgh]] he re-entered the University to complete his studies (1868–72) in geology under Sir [[Archibald Geikie]].

==Challenger Expedition==
In 1872 Murray assisted in preparing scientific apparatus for the [[Challenger Expedition]] under the direction of the expedition's chief scientist, [[Charles Wyville Thomson]]. When a position on the expedition became available Murray joined the crew as a naturalist. During the four-year voyage he assisted in the research of the oceans including collecting marine samples, making and noting observations, and making improvements to marine instrumentation. After the expedition Murray was appointed Chief Assistant at the Challenger offices in Edinburgh where he managed and organised the collection. After Thomson's death in 1882 Murray became Director of the office and in 1896 published ''The Report on the Scientific Results of the Voyage of HMS Challenger'', a work of more than 50 volumes of reports.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

Murray renamed his house, on Boswall Road in northern Edinburgh, ''Challenger Lodge'' in recognition of the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1905-6&lt;/ref&gt; The building now houses St Columba's Hospice.

==Marine Laboratory, Granton==
In 1884,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst10042.html Overview of Dunstaffnage ik Marine Laboratory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Murray set up the Marine Laboratory at [[Granton, Edinburgh]], the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. In 1894, this laboratory was moved to [[Millport, Isle of Cumbrae]], on the [[Firth of Clyde]], and became the [[University Marine Biological Station, Millport]], the forerunner of today's [[Scottish Association for Marine Science]] at [[Dunbeg|Dunstaffnage]], near [[Oban]], [[Argyll and Bute]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Bathymetrical survey of the fresh-water lochs of Scotland==
After completing the Challenger Expedition reports, Murray began work surveying the fresh water [[lochs]] of Scotland. He was assisted by [[Frederick Pullar]] and over a period of 3 years they surveyed 15 lochs together. In 1901 Pullar drowned as a result of an ice skating accident which caused Murray to consider abandoning the survey work. However Pullar's father, Laurence Pullar, persuaded him to continue and gave £10,000 towards completion of the survey. Murray coordinated a team of nearly 50 people who took more than 60,000 individual depth soundings and recorded other physical characteristics of the 562 lochs. The resulting 6 volume ''Bathymetrical Survey of the Fresh-Water Lochs of Scotland'' was published in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The cartographer [[John George Bartholomew]], who strove to advance geographical and scientific understanding through his cartographic work, drafted and published all the maps of the Survey.

==North Atlantic oceanographic expedition==
In 1909 Murray indicated to the [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea ]] that an oceanographic survey of the north Atlantic should be undertaken. After Murray agreed to pay all expenses, the Norwegian Government lent him the research ship ''Michael Sars'' and its scientific crew. He was joined on board by the Norwegian marine biologist [[Johan Hjort]] and the ship departed [[Plymouth]] in April 1910 for a four-month expedition to take physical and biological observations at all depths between Europe and North America.  Murray and Hjort published their findings in ''The Depths of the Ocean'' in 1912 and it became a classic for marine naturalists and oceanographers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Murray|title=Sir John Murray {{!}} Scottish Canadian oceanographer|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the first to note the existence of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] and of [[oceanic trench]]es. He also noted the presence of deposits derived from the [[Sahara]]n desert in deep ocean [[sediments]] and published a vast number of papers on his findings.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Biography==
Faithfull was born in [[Woolton]],&lt;ref name="Benezit"/&gt; a suburb of Liverpool where her father, Sir [[Sir James Reynolds, 1st Baronet|James Reynolds]], had business interests. She married George Faithfull in 1917. and after his death she married, in 1943, the writer and critic Cuthbert Worsley.&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Buckman|publisher=Art Dictionaries Ltd|year=1998|title=Artists in Britain Since 1945 Vol 1, A to L |ISBN=0 95326 095 X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Evacuees Growing Cabbages (Art.IWM ART.LD 428) (1940).jpg|thumb|''Evacuees Growing Cabbages'' (Art.IWM ART.LD 428) (1940)]] 

Faithfull studied at the [[Slade School of Art]] throughout 1923 and 1924, before going to Paris to study at the [[Académie de la Grande Chaumière]]. In 1933 she exhibited at the [[Salon des Artistes Francais]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Benezit"&gt;{{cite book|authors=|publisher=Editions Grund, Paris|year=2006|title=Benezit Dictionary of Artists Volume 5 Dyck-Gemignani|ISBN=2 7000 3075 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of World War Two, Faithfull applied to work for the [[War Artists' Advisory Committee]], WAAC. Although not given a full-time commission by WAAC, she was given facilities and permits to work. She used these to produce paintings depicting evacuee children and, later, scenes of American servicemen playing baseball in a London park, and these pieces were purchased by WAAC.&lt;ref name="Beyond"&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Speck|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=2014|title=Beyond the Battlefield, Women Artists of Two World Wars|ISBN=978 178023 374 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harries"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Merion Harries |author2=Susie Harries |publisher=Michael Joseph, The Imperial War Museum &amp; the Tate Gallery|year=1983|title=The War Artists, British Official War Art of the Twentieth Century |ISBN=0 7181 2314 X}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, Faithfull also worked for a time as a surgical artist at the new plastic surgery unit at the [[Queen Victoria Hospital]] in [[East Grinstead]] under Sir [[Archibald McIndoe]].&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"/&gt; At the end of the war, Faithfull produced a triptych depicting the crowds gathered around [[Buckingham Palace]], celebrating on [[Victory in Europe Day|VE-Day]].&lt;ref name="WW2Art"&gt;{{cite book|author=|publisher=Imperial War Museum|year=2007|title=Art from the Second World War|ISBN=978-1-904897-66-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyond"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IWMlf&gt;{{cite web |author=Imperial War Museum|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/1050000874|title=Correspondence with artists, Mrs L Faithfull |year=|accessdate=28 April 2017|work=[[Imperial War Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Faithfull built a reputation as a portrait painter and exhibited widely with works shown at the [[Royal Academy]], the [[Royal Society of British Artists]] and the [[New English Art Club]].&lt;ref name=Waters2&gt;{{cite book|author=Grant M. Waters|publisher=Eastbourne Fine Art|year=|title=Dictionary of British Artists Working 1900-1950 Volume II|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Kenneth Clark]] and Sir [[Edward Marsh (polymath)|Edward Marsh]] acquired examples of her work for their private collections.&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"/&gt; In her later years she begin working in metal, creating figures of dancers and horses. Faithfull died in 1994 at St. Angelia's Convent in Bristol, where she had lived for several years.&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"/&gt;

{{Chinese name|[[Lü (surname)|Lü]]}}
[[File:Album of 18 Daoist Paintings - 15.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Zhang Lu (painter)|Zhang Lu]]'s painting of Lü Dongbin, early 16th century]]
'''Lü Dongbin''' ({{zh|t=呂洞賓|w=Lü Tung-Pin}}) (796 CE-1016 CE) was a [[Tang Dynasty]] Chinese scholar and poet who has been elevated to the status of an [[Xian (Taoism)|immortal]] in the [[Chinese cultural sphere]], worshipped especially by the [[Taoism|Taoists]].  Lü is one of the most widely known of the group of deities known as the [[Eight Immortals]] and considered by some to be the de facto leader. (The formal leader is more likely said to be [[Zhongli Quan]] or sometimes [[Iron-Crutch Li]].) He is also a historical figure who was mentioned in the official history book ''History of Song''. Lü is widely considered to be one of the earliest masters of the tradition of [[neidan]], or internal alchemy. He is depicted in art as being dressed as a scholar and he often bears a [[magic sword|sword]] on his back that dispels evil spirits.

==Character==
Lü Dongbin is usually portrayed as a scholarly, clever man with a genuine desire to help people obtain wisdom/enlightenment and to learn the Tao.   However, he is often portrayed as having some character "flaws", not an uncommon theme for the colorful Taoist immortals, all of whom in general have various eccentricities:
*He is said to be a ladies man, even after (or only after) becoming an immortal – and for this reason he is generally not invoked by people with romantic problems.  This may also relate to some of the [[Taoist sexual practices|Taoist sexual arts]].
*He is portrayed as having bouts of drunkenness, which was not uncommon among the often fun-loving Eight Immortals.  This also parallels several Taoist artists renowned for their love of drinking.
*One story relates that early on after becoming immortal, he had a strong temper as a "young" immortal, even deforming a riverbank in a bout of anger.
* Lü was also a prolific [[poet]]. His works were collected in the ''[[Quan Tangshi]]'' (Complete Tang poetry).

==Early life==
His name is '''Lü Yán''', with '''Yán''' (巖 or 岩 or 喦) being the [[given name]]. Dòngbīn is his [[courtesy name]]. He is called Master Pure-[[yin and yang|Yang]] (純陽子 Chunyang Zi), and is also called Lü the Progenitor (呂祖 lü zŭ) by some [[Taoism|Daoist]], especially those of the [[Quanzhen School]]. He was born in Jingzhao Prefecture (京兆府 Jīngzhào Fŭ) around 796 CE during the [[Tang Dynasty]]

When he was born, a [[Aroma compound|fragrance]] allegedly filled the room. His birthday is said to be on the fourteenth day of the fourth month of the [[Chinese calendar]]. He had been very intelligent since childhood and had many academic achievements. However, according to one story, still unmarried by the age of 20, Lü twice took the top-level [[Imperial examination|civil service exam]] to become a government official, but did not succeed.

In the first year of Tang Baoli (825 CE), he was a scholar for a period of time. He served as a county magistrate twice. Soon he was ruined by officialdom, abandoned his official position and retired to the mountains.  Once you traveled to Chang'an Wine Cellar, you will be divorced by Zhengyang's real person. After the "Ten Tests", [[Zhongli Quan]]（鍾離權 Zhong Liquan） "gives the way of the Golden Dan, because of the law," and finally becomes a fairy，He died in the Yellow Crane Tower in the 1016 CE in the Northern [[Song Dynasty]]（黃鶴樓 huánɡhèlóu）.

==Yellow Millet Dream==
[[File:The Daoist immortal Lü Dongbin crossing Lake Dongting.jpeg|thumb|''The Daoist immortal Lü Dongbin crossing Lake Dongting'', dated to the [[Song dynasty]]]]
The legend has it that one night when Lü Yan was in [[Chang'an]] or [[Handan]], he dozed off as his yellow [[millet]] was cooking in a hotel. He dreamed that he took the imperial exam and excelled, and thus was awarded a prestigious office and soon promoted to the position of vice minister (侍郎 shìláng). He then married the daughter of a prosperous household and had a son and a daughter. He was promoted again and again, and finally became the [[prime minister]]. However, his success and luck attracted jealousy of others, so he was accused of crimes that caused him to lose his office.  His wife then betrayed him, his children were killed by bandits, and he lost all his wealth. As he was dying on the street in the dream, he woke up.

Although in the dream, eighteen years had passed, the whole dream actually happened in the time it took his millet to cook. The characters from his dream were actually played by [[Zhongli Quan]] in order to make him realize that one should not put too much importance on transient glory and success.  As a result, Lü went with Zhongli to discover and cultivate the [[Tao]].  This dream is known as "Dream of the Yellow Millet" (黃粱夢 Huáng Liáng Mèng) and is described in a writing compiled by [[Ma Zhiyuan]] of the [[Yuan Dynasty]].

In volume 82 of [[Song Dynasty]] scholar [[Li Fang (Song dynasty)|Li Fang]]'s ''[[Extensive Records of the Taiping Era]]'', an earlier version of the story, Lü Dongbin was replaced by Student Lu (盧生 Lú Shēng), and Zhongli Quan by Elder Lü  (呂翁 Lǚ Wēng).

The exact age of Lü Yan when this incident occurred varies in the tellings, from 20 years of age to 40.

==Ten trials of Lü Dongbin==
[[File:The Daoist Immortal Lü Dongbin.jpg|thumb|''The Daoist Immortal Lü Dongbin'', a painting from the Ming dynasty]]
A story has it that when in Chang An, Lü was tested by Zhongli Quan ten times before Quan took him in as a disciple and Lü subsequently became immortal. These ten trials are described below.

# One day Lü came back from work and found out that his loved one was dying; without sadness or remorse, he started to prepare the dress and coffin necessary for burial, but later his loved one revived and lived on. Lü was still without sadness or joyous feeling.
# Lü was selling goods at a market and there came a buyer to bargain with him. After agreeing on the price, Lü handed him the stuff but the buyer refused to pay in full and then walked away. Lü would not argue and let him walk away.
# On the first day of the lunar calendar, Lü met with a beggar. After giving him some money, the beggar kept asking for more and threw vulgar words at him. Lü left the scene with a smile.
# Lü was once a shepherd. During his tenure a hungry tiger was eyeing the goats under his care. Lü protected the goats by sending them down to the hillside and stood in front of the Tiger. The hungry tiger was awed to see this and left without hurting Lü.
# Lü was studying at a small hut on a mountain when a beautiful woman came by and asked if she could stay there for the night since she was lost. That night, this beautiful lady was flirting and tried to get Lü to have sex with her, but Lü was untouched by such temptation.
# One day Lü came back to his house and saw that he had been burglarized and lost all his belongings. Without becoming angry he started to work on his farm. As he dug into the ground he found countless pieces of gold. He uncovered the earth without taking a single piece of the gold.
# Lü bought some bronze utensils at a market. Upon returning home he realized that all of the utensils were made of gold and he immediately returned them to the seller.
# A crazy Taoist was selling medicine on the street, telling people that his magic potion would have one of two outcomes: either 1) the drinker would die on the spot, or 2) the drinker would become immortal. No one would dare to try, except Lü, who bought and tried the potion. Nothing happened to him.
# A river was elevated due to heavy rain. Lü and other passengers were on a boat crossing the river. Before reaching the middle of the journey, the weather deteriorated, and most of the passengers except Lü became worried. Lü took it in his stride and never worried about life and death!
# Lü was alone at home and suddenly weird things happened. Ghost and monsters were killing each other and wanted to do the same to Lü. Showing no sense of fear, Lü kept on doing his chores without paying attention to them. Another group of devils with blood all over them tried to take Lü’s life away by saying to Lü that he owed his previous life to them since in past life Lü took his life. Without any fear Lü said ‘go ahead and take my life since I took yours in past life, this is fair and square !’ All of a sudden the sky turned blue and those ghost and devils disappeared.  Zhongli Quan  (Who happened to be his Teacher and Mentor in Taoist stories) was looking and laughing at him while all these events were happening.

These 10 tests proved that Lü was a pure and dignified person and Master Zhongli was very satisfied and happy to take Lü to Nan San Her Ling to pass his secret to life and subsequently formed a "Zhong-Lü Golden Dan" school of Taoism. But Lü was not too fond of the secret and instead changed his formula for inner peace and benefits more human beings; many until today practiced such path to immortals. This is his major effort and contribution. He is said to have helped many to walk the right path and improve the health and living conditions of many people.

==Stories and legends==
[[Image:LuDongbin.jpg|300px|thumb|Statue of Lü Dongbin in the temple in [[Handan]]]]
Since the [[Northern Song Dynasty]], there have been many stories and legends that are connected to Lü Dongbin. The stories were usually about Lü helping others to learn the Tao. According to the official [[History of the Song Dynasty]] (《宋史》), Lü was seen several times visiting the house of [[Chen Tuan]] (陳摶), who was believed to be the first person to present to the public the [[Taijitu]].

The kindness of Lü Dongbin is demonstrated in the [[Chinese proverb]] "dog bites Lü Dongbin" (狗咬呂洞賓 gŏu yăo Lǚ Dòngbīn), which means an inability to recognize goodness and repay kindness with vice. Some say that the original proverb should actually be "狗咬呂洞賓，不識好人心," stemming from a story about the friendship between Gou Miao (狗咬) and Lü Dongbin, who both did for the other great favors, each of which seemed like a disservice initially, signifying the importance of having faith in one's friends.

According to [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]], Lü was the founder of the School of the Golden Elixir of Life (Jin Dan Jiao), and originator of the material presented in the book "Tai Yi Jin Hua Zong Zhi" (《太一金華宗旨》), or [[The Secret of the Golden Flower]]. Also, according to [[Daoist]] legend, he is the founder of the [[internal martial arts]] style called "Eight Immortals Sword" (八仙剑), considered to be one of the martial treasures of [[Wudangshan]].

According to one story, Lü's teacher [[Zhongli Quan]] became an immortal and was about to fly to [[heaven]], while saying to Lü that if he kept practicing the Tao he would also be able to fly to heaven himself very soon. Lü Dongbin replied to his teacher that he'll fly to heaven only after he enlightens all the sentient beings on earth (another story says all his relatives).  According to the book "The Eight Immortals Achieving the Tao (《八仙得道摶》)," in his previous [[incarnation]], Lü Dongbin was a Taoist master and the teacher of Zhongli Quan.

According to the Taoist book "History of the Immortals" (《歷代神仙通鑒》), Lü is the [[reincarnation]] of the ancient [[Wise old man|Sage]]-[[King]] "Huang-Tan-Shi" (皇覃氏).

According to Venerable Hsuan Hua, Lü is one of the transformations of [[Guanyin]] ([[Avalokiteśvara]]) Bodhisattva.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vbs.drbachinese.org/vbs/vbsgallery/vbs/300/vbs300p014.jpg 金剛菩提海圖像版 Vajra Bodhi Sea, vbs 300]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lü Dongbin and White Peony (Bai Mudan)==
One of most popular of Lü Dongbin's legends is his encounter with a prostitute named [[White Peony]] (Bai Mudan)

The most popular version comes from the Journey to the East novel.&lt;ref&gt;Wu Yuantai. [http://open-lit.com/listbook.php?cid=27&amp;gbid=101&amp;bid=3987&amp;start=0 Journey to the East (Dong You Ji)-Chinese text]&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the immortal Lü Dongbin was greatly attracted to White Peony, one of the most beautiful courtesans in [[Luoyang]]. Lü Dongbin slept with her many times but never ejaculated, because he didn’t want to lose his Yang essence. 
Unfortunately Lu’s immortal colleague [[Iron-Crutch Li]] and [[He Xiangu]] taught Mudan how to make him ejaculate by tickling his groin. Finally White Peony successfully made Lü Dongbin ejaculate and absorbed his Yang essence. Later she cultivated herself and  became immortal too.

Another version comes from Ba Xian Dedao novel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guji.artx.cn/article/24620.html Ba Xian Dedao (Eight Immortal obtain enlightenment) Chinese text]&lt;/ref&gt; This version is more subtle and there is no sexual intercourse here.
One day the immortal Lü Dongbin transforms himself into a handsome scholar and tries to advise the famous prostitute White Peony. In their first encounter White Peony seduces him passionately, but he refuses to sleep with her.  In their second encounter, Lü agrees to sleep with her.  But as they walk to the bed, Lü suddenly cries that his stomach is painful, and faints.   White Peony is very sorry about his condition and calls a doctor using her money (despite her pimp’s grumbling, who incites her to throw the sick Lü to the road).  Lü (who is only pretending to be sick) is very pleased knowing Peony's merciful heart. In their third encounter, Lü Dongbin finally succeeds to persuade White Peony to leave her wayward life. She finally becomes immortal too.

In the opera version, White Peony is changed from a seductive prostitute to the daughter of a drugstore owner. One day Lü Dongbin comes to their store and makes trouble by asking for impossible medicines.  Knowing her father's difficulty, Peony meets Lü and answers all of his question. From quarrelling they finally become lovers.

==Modern worship==
In 19th- and 20th-century Guangdong, belief in the powers of Lüzu was strong. In the century after the 1840s, temples were founded which organized [[spirit writing]] seances, festivals for the birthdays of the gods, death rituals, and running schools, clinics, and disaster relief.&lt;ref&gt;Shiga Ichiko, "Manifestations of Lüzu in Modern Guangdong: The Rise and Growth of Spirit Writing Cults," in Livia Kohn, Harold David Roth, ed., ''Daoist Identity: Cosmology, Lineage, and Ritual'' (Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2002 {{ISBN|0585464049}}), [https://books.google.com/books?id=_wzwgLAeMWwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=Lu+Dongbin#v=onepage&amp;q=Lu%20Dongbin&amp;f=false p.  200].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media depictions==
In the television show ''[[Jackie Chan Adventures]]'', Dongbin was shown to be the immortal who sealed away [[List of Jackie Chan Adventures characters#Shendu|Shendu, The Fire Demon]].

[[Jackie Chan]] portrayed  Lü Dongbin in the film ''[[The Forbidden Kingdom]]''.

In Desolate Era, Lü Dongbin is portrayed as one of the True Yang Immortals.

Over the decades, with demand for healthcare providers increasing due to marked growth in the population of Kenya, training programs were implemented.

==History==

In 1908, nursing in Kenya began when [[Missionary|missionaries]] who visited Kenya provided training.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The first nurses were primarily male and were known as "dressers."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their primary responsibilities included dressing [[wound]]s, administering [[Intramuscular injection|injections]], and managing [[hospital]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-143-23.jpg|thumb|Off duty time for African nurses at Fort Hall. (Picture issued 1945)]]
Before 1950, nursing in Kenya was conducted without a formal framework. Most health care institutions provided in-service training for healthcare workers, to assist the whites in the provision of required healthcare, thus making it difficult to identify healthcare workers according to their level of training and scope of practice.In 1950 meeting of the Nurses and Midwives Council of Kenya members passed a resolution that formally described the different cadres of nurses who were practising nursing in Kenya at that time. The titles of State Registered Nurse, Kenya Registered Nurse, and Assistant Registered Nurse Grade 1 and 2 remained in force on the basis of Registration and Training.

In 1952, the Examination Sub-Committee held its first examination for Assistant Enrolled Nurses Grade I and II. Approval of training schools was required to be done by the relevant training schools sub-committee, whilst the inspection of schools would be done every three years.

The King George Hospital [[Kenyatta National Hospital]] became the first hospital to start the Kenya Registered Nurse training programme. The course was approved to run for 3 ½ years, with the Preliminary Training Service (PTS) to extend over 3 months, followed by a period of 3 months ward rotation and 3 years of theory and clinical training.

1980s there was a marked growth in the population of Kenya. As a result of the rapid development going on in the country at that time, there was an increase in rural-urban migration, resulting in an uneven distribution of resources, with particular reference to human resources. There was also a growing need for health care providers to engage in effective healthcare management strategies, to be able to reach every part of the population.
1987 the Kenya Registered Community Health Nurse (KRCHN) training was commenced, to prepare nurses who would be able to give comprehensive care to the communities.
1990s, due to expansion and emergence of complex disease patterns    among populations such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, cardiac conditions, the Nursing Council of Kenya approved the preparation of nurses at bachelors level because the effective management of such patients requires highly skilled and trained personnel who would be able to engage in critical thinking and sound decision-making.

2013,approved-nursing-courses-council-Kenya 19 programmes had been approved, as health care learning institutions continue to recognise the need to build capacity to facilitate health care management and practice at all levels.

==Nursing regulation==

Before the establishment of the [[Nursing Council of Kenya]] (NCK) under the Nurses Cap 257 of the Laws of Kenya, the activities of the Council were governed by Ordinances. Ordinance number 16 of 4 June 1946 was the first governing tool to be authorised by the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya to address health issues and activities of the nurses in the then Kenya Colony.

In 1983, the Council was finally acknowledged by an Act of Parliament under the Nurses Act Cap 257 of the Laws of Kenya as the "Nursing Council of Kenya".

===Mandate===
The core functions of the Nursing Council of Kenya are to establish and improve standards of all branches of the nursing profession in all their aspects and to safeguard the interest of all nurses.

The '''nutrition facts label''' (also known as the '''nutrition information panel''', and other slight variations) is a label required on most [[packaged food]] in many countries.  Most countries also release overall [[List of nutrition guides|nutrition guides]] for general educational purposes. In some cases, the guides are based on different dietary targets for various nutrients than the labels on specific foods.

Nutrition facts labels are only one of many types of [[food label]] required by regulation or applied by manufacturers.

==Australia and New Zealand==

Australia and New Zealand use a nutritional information panel of the following format:

{| class="wikitable"
|+ '''NUTRITION INFORMATION'''
|-
|colspan="3"|
Servings per package:

Serving size: g
|-
!
!Quantity per Serving
!Quantity per 100 g

|-
| Carbohydrate || g || g
|-
| &amp;emsp; - sugars || g || g
|-
| Sodium || mg || mg
|}

Other items are included as appropriate, and the units may be varied as appropriate (e.g. substituting ml for g, or mmol for mg in the 'Sodium' row).&lt;ref&gt;Food Standards Australia and New Zealand Standard 1.2.8 {{cite web |url=http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/_srcfiles/ACF2A90.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514085734/http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/_srcfiles/ACF2A90.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013 the New Zealand government introduced rules around common claims made on food packaging, such as 'low in fat'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Greens-welcome-food-labelling-move/tabid/423/articleID/293423/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= Greens welcome food labelling move| date=April 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
{{See also|Canadian health claims for food}}

[[File:NutritionFactsValeurNutritive.jpg|thumb|A Canadian Nutrition Label displaying information in both English and French.]]
In [[Canada]],  a standardized "Nutrition Facts" label was introduced as part of regulations passed in 2003, and became mandatory for most prepackaged food products on December 12, 2005.  (Smaller businesses were given until December 12, 2007 to make the information available.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/label-etiquet/nutrition/index_e.html |title=Nutrition Labelling - Food and Nutrition - Health Canada |publisher=Hc-sc.gc.ca |accessdate=2013-01-26|date=2004-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with food packaging laws in the country, all information, including the nutrition label, must be written in both English and French, the country's two official languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/labelling/food-labelling-for-industry/bilingual/eng/1328121549968/1328121616816|title=Bilingual Labelling|first=Government of Canada, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Food Labelling and Claims|last=Directorate|website=www.inspection.gc.ca|date=2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian regulation tightly controls the manner in which the nutrition fact table (NFT) data are laid out. There is a wide variety of possible formats for use on a given food package. A selection hierarchy is used to select among the many formats (28 main formats, and 2-7 sub formats for each). This results in standard (vertical) formats being considered for use before horizontal and linear formats. The selection hierarchy also allows the NFT to occupy no more than 15% of the physical package's available display area (ADS), but never to be smaller than a format that would be &lt;=15% of ADS. In practice, determining the ADS of a package, and selecting the appropriate NFT format, can be a detailed calculation.

==China==
In 2011 the Chinese Ministry of Health released the National Food Safety Standard for Nutrition Labeling of Prepackaged Foods (GB 28050-2011). The core nutrients that must be on a label are: protein, fat, carbohydrate and sodium. Energy is noted in kJ. And all values must be per 100g/100ml.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/General%20Rules%20for%20Nutrition%20Labeling%20of%20Prepackaged%20Foods%20_Beijing_China%20-%20Peoples%20Republic%20of_1-9-2013.pdf | title=General Rules for Nutrition labeling of prepackaged foods | publisher=USDA Foreign Agriculture Service | accessdate=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsciq.gov.cn/www/ContentsDisp.asp?id=7715 | title=GB 28050-2011 (chinese) | publisher=www.gsciq.gov.cn | accessdate=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Union==

[[File:Nutrition-Information-UK-Label-Yoghurt.png|thumb|A UK nutrition information label, for low-fat yoghurt. A key difference from US labelling is that it always gives values for a set quantity (100 ml or - like here - 100 g), allowing easy comparison between products. Also, fibre is not considered a type of carbohydrate]]
[[File:Nutri info naranjas eu.jpg|thumb|A rare example of optional nutrition facts on a label for oranges (in the EU not mandatory for unprocessed fruits)]]
It was regulated by the Commission Directive 2008/100/EC of 28 October 2008 amending Council Directive 90/496/EEC on nutrition labelling for [[foodstuff]]s as regards recommended daily allowances, [[energy conversion factor]]s and definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:285:0009:0012:EN:PDF |title=COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2008/100/EC of 28 October 2008 |publisher=EUR-Lex.europa.eu |accessdate=2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new regulation is now in force ([[Regulation 1169/2011]]).&lt;ref name="Reg1169"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:304:0018:0063:EN:PDF|title=REGULATION (EU) No 1169/2011 on the provision of food information to consumers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutritional labelling becomes mandatory for most pre-packaged foods as from December 2016.

In the European Union, along the "old" rules (Directive 90/496, amended), the information (usually in panel format) is most often labelled "Nutrition Information" (or equivalent in other EU languages). An example is shown on the right. The panel is optional, but if provided, the prescribed content and format must be followed. It will always give values for a set quantity&amp;nbsp;— {{convert|100|g|abbr=on}} or {{convert|100|ml|abbr=on}} of the product&amp;nbsp;— and often also for a defined "serving", as an option. First will come the energy values, in both [[calorie|kilocalories]] and [[kilojoule]]s.

Then will come a breakdown of constituent elements: usually most or all of protein, carbohydrate, starch, sugar, fat, fibre and sodium. The "fat" figure is likely to be further broken down into [[saturated fat|saturated]] and unsaturated fat, while the "carbohydrate" figure is likely to give a subtotal for sugars. With the "new" rules, the mandatory information is: energy, fat, saturates, carbohydrates, sugars, protein and salt, in that particular order, with options to extend this list to: mono-unsaturates, polyunsaturates, polyols, starch, fibre, and vitamins and minerals.&lt;ref name="Reg1169"/&gt;

With regards to health claims and nutrition (composition) claims, these are harmonised in the EU through Regulation 1924/2006, amended.&lt;ref name="Reg1924"/&gt; In November 2012, the European Commission published two new regulations: Regulation (EC) No. 1047/2012 and Regulation (EC) No.1048/2012.
Certain nutrition claim groups as of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 had to be changed. Moreover, the health claims associated to barley beta-gluten were amended (e.g. lowering  blood cholesterol).&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:310:0036:0037:EN:PDF Commission Regulation (EU) No 1047/2012], European Commission, 8 November 2012, Retrieved 7 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:310:0038:0040:EN:PDF Commission Regulation (EU) No 1048/2012], European Commission, 8 November 2012, Retrieved 7 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Regulation 1924, there are legal definitions of terms such as "low fat", "high fibre", "reduced calories".&lt;ref name="Reg1924"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02006R1924-20121129&amp;qid=1417169827044&amp;from=EN|title=REGULATION (EC) No 1924/2006 on nutrition and health claims made on foods|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All health claims have been harmonised in the European Union. They can be used if they have been approved by [[EFSA]]. The list of approved and rejected claims is available on a web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/nuhclaims/|title=Nutrition and Health Claims - European Commission|first=DG|last=SANTE|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provided the full nutrition information is shown on the packet, additional nutritional information and formats (e.g. a [[traffic light rating system]]) may be included and this falls outside the scope of regulation.

The United Kingdom regulations are given in Schedules 6 and 7 of the Food Labelling Regulations 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Hong Kong==
In [[Hong Kong]] nutrition facts labels are regulated by the subsidiary legislation Food and Drugs (Composition and Labelling) (Amendment: Requirements for Nutrition Labelling and Nutrition Claim) Regulation 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nutritionlabel.gov.hk/ |title=Hong Kong government |publisher=Nutritionlabel.gov.hk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had, on September 19, 2008, notified the [[Prevention of Food Adulteration]] (5th Amendment) Rules, 2008, mandating packaged food manufacturers to declare on their product labels nutritional information and a mark from the  F.P.O or [[Agmark]] (Companies that are responsible for checking food products) to enable consumers make informed choices while purchasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/PFA%20Rule%20Relating%20to%20Nutritional%20Labeling%20of%20Packaged%20Food%20Implemented_New%20Delhi_India_4-3-2009.pdf |title=PFA Rule Relating to Nutritional Labeling of Packaged Food Implemented |publisher=USDA Foreign Agricultural Service |accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this amendment, disclosure of nutritional information was largely voluntary though many large manufacturers tend to adopt the international practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freshplaza.com/news_detail.asp?id=32031 |title=India: Packaged foods must list nutritional facts |publisher=Freshplaza.com |accessdate=2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexico==
Food products sold in [[Mexico]] use the NOM-051-SCFI-1994 "Información nutrimental" product labelling standard, very similar to "Nutrition Facts" in the US. The Official Mexican Standard, or NOM (''Norma Oficial Mexicana''), was developed by the Mexican Secretary of Commerce and Industrial Promotion (''Secretaría de Comercio y Fomento Industrial''), now a part of the Secretary of the Economy (SECOFI). It entered into effect on January 24, 1996&lt;ref&gt;http://cronos.cta.com.mx/cgi-bin/normas.sh/cgis/despresult.p?clave=NOM-051-SCFI-1994&lt;/ref&gt; and defines "General specifications for labelling foods and pre-bottled non-alcoholic beverages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mexicolaws.com/scfi/NOM-051-SCFI-1994.htm |title=mexicolaws.com |publisher=mexicolaws.com |accessdate=2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

===Description===
In the [[United States]], the Nutritional Facts label lists the percentage supplied that is recommended to be met, or to be limited, in one day of human [[nutrient]]s based on a daily diet of 2,000 calories.

With certain exceptions, such as foods meant for babies, the following Daily Values are used.&lt;ref&gt;[[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=ebf41b28ca63f43546dd9b6bf3f20330&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=21:2.0.1.1.2&amp;idno=21#21:2.0.1.1.2.1.1.6 101.9(c)8(iv)]&lt;/ref&gt; These are called [[Reference Daily Intake]] (RDI) values and were originally based on the highest 1968 [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]]s (RDA) for each nutrient in order to assure that the needs of all age and sex combinations were met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crnusa.org/about_recs4.html|title=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031115637/http://www.crnusa.org/about_recs4.html|archivedate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are older than the current [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]]s of the [[Dietary Reference Intake]]. For [[vitamin C]], [[vitamin D]], [[vitamin E]], [[vitamin K]], [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], [[magnesium]], and [[manganese]], the current highest RDAs are up to 50% higher than the older Daily Values used in labeling, whereas for other nutrients the recommended needs have gone down. A side-by-side table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at [[Reference Daily Intake]]. As of October 2010, the only micronutrients that are required to be included on all labels are vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=21:2.0.1.1.2.1.1.6&amp;idno=21 21 CFR  101.9(c)(8)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813113845/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=77734a162c4f7ddd997233b4d623c029&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=21:2.0.1.1.2.1.1.6&amp;idno=21 |date=2009-08-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; To determine the nutrient levels in the foods, companies may develop or use databases, and these may be submitted voluntarily to the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] for review.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/GuidanceDocuments/FoodLabelingNutrition/FoodLabelingGuide/ucm064894.htm VII.

[[File:FDA Nutrition Facts Label 2006.jpg|thumb|The original FDA Nutrition Facts label, as of 2006]][[File:FDA Nutrition Facts Label 2016.png|thumb|The new Nutrition Facts label|alt=]]
The label was mandated for most food products under the provisions of the 1990 [[Nutrition Labeling and Education Act]] (NLEA), per the recommendations of the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milestones in U.S. Food and Drug Law History|url=http://www.fda.gov/aboutfda/whatwedo/history/milestones/ucm128305.htm|publisher=FDA|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Dead link|date=October 2018}} It was one of several controversial actions taken during the tenure of FDA Commissioner [[David Aaron Kessler|Dr. David Kessler]]. The law required food companies to begin using the new food label on packaged foods beginning May 8, 1994. (Meat and poultry products were not covered by NLEA, though the U.S. Department of Agriculture proposed similar regulations for voluntary labeling of raw meat and poultry.&lt;ref&gt;Saltos E, Davis C, et al. (December 1994). [http://naldr.nal.usda.gov/NALWeb/Agricola_Link.asp?Accession=CAT10702513 "Using Food Labels To Follow the Dietary Guidelines for Americans: A Reference"]. Agriculture Information Bulletin Number 704. United States Department of Agriculture, Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion. Retrieved November 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;)  Foods labeled before that day could use the old label. This appeared on all products in 1995. The old label was titled "Nutrition Information Per Serving" or simply, "Nutrition Information".

The label begins with a standard [[serving size|serving]] measurement, [[calories]] are listed second, and then following is a breakdown of the constituent elements. Always listed are [[total fat]], [[sodium]], [[carbohydrates]] and [[protein]]; the other nutrients usually shown may be suppressed, if they are zero. Usually all 15 nutrients are shown: [[calories]], calories from fat, [[fat]], [[saturated fat]], [[trans fat]], [[cholesterol]], [[sodium]], [[carbohydrates]], [[dietary fiber]], [[sugars]], [[protein]], [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin C]], [[calcium]], and [[iron]].

Products containing less than 5&amp;nbsp;g of fat show amounts rounded to the nearest 0.5&amp;nbsp;g. Amounts less than 0.5&amp;nbsp;g are rounded to 0&amp;nbsp;g. For example, if a product contains 0.45&amp;nbsp;g of trans fat per serving, and the package contains 18 servings, the label would show 0&amp;nbsp;g of trans fat, even though the product actually contains a total of 8.1&amp;nbsp;g of trans fat.

In addition to the nutrition label, products may display certain nutrition information or health claims on packaging. These health claims are only allowed by the FDA for "eight diet and health relationships based on proven scientific evidence", including: calcium and osteoporosis, fiber-containing grain products, fruits and vegetables and cancer, fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber—particularly soluble fiber—and the risk of coronary heart disease, fat and cancer, saturated fat and cholesterol and coronary heart disease, sodium and hypertension, and folate and neural tube defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wheeler|first=Madelyn|author2=Marion Franz |author3=Joan Heins |author4=Rebecca Schafer |author5=Harold Holler |title=Food Labeling|journal=Diabetes Care|date=May 1994|volume=17|issue=5|page=482|url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/17/5/480.full.pdf|accessdate=28 January 2014|doi=10.2337/diacare.17.5.480 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute of Medicine recommended these labels contain the most useful nutritional information for consumers: saturated fats, trans fats, sodium, calories, and serving size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Examination of Front-of-Package Nutrition Rating Systems and Symbols: Phase 1 Report | url = http://iom.edu/Reports/2010/Examination-of-Front-of-Package-Nutrition-Rating-Systems-and-Symbols-Phase-1-Report.aspx | publisher = [[Institute of Medicine]] | date = 2010-10-13 | accessdate = 2011-01-26 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110111172009/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2010/Examination-of-Front-of-Package-Nutrition-Rating-Systems-and-Symbols-Phase-1-Report.aspx | archivedate = 2011-01-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, food manufacturers and grocery stores announced plans to display some of this nutrition information on processed food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Food Makers Devise Own Label Plan | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/business/25label.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss | publisher = New York Times | date = 2010-01-25 | accessdate = 2011-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nutrition facts label currently appears on more than 6.5 billion food packages. President [[Bill Clinton]] issued an award of design excellence for the nutrition facts label in 1997 to [[Burkey Belser]] in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Briefs - The NIH Record | url = http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2006/04_07_2006/briefs.htm | publisher = [[National Institutes of Health]] | date = 2006-04-27 | accessdate = 2009-06-16 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090609073232/http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2006/04_07_2006/briefs.htm | archivedate = 2009-06-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA does not require any specific typeface be used in the Nutrition Facts label, mandating only that the label "utilize a single easy-to-read type style",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2012-title21-vol2/pdf/CFR-2012-title21-vol2-sec101-9.pdf|title=21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(ii)(A)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though its example label uses [[Helvetica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Examples of Revised Nutrition Facts Panel Listing Trans Fat | url = http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/labtr.html | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition | date = 2003-07-09 | accessdate = 2007-11-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013040155/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/labtr.html |archivedate = October 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as regulated by the FDA and the USDA, it is mandatory for certain information listed in the label to be written in English, including: name of the product, net quantity, serving size and number of servings per package, nutrition facts, ingredient list, and name of manufacturer or distributor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davidson|first=Tish|title=Food Labeling|journal=The Gale Encyclopedia of Diets: A Guide to Health and Nutrition|year=2008|volume=1|pages=407–412|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX2830000120&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=pcc&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=aadf9c6be7ccb502289438e9e6014d75|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smallest lettering should be at least 1/16th of an inch tall (1.5875 millimeters), based on the height of a lowercase "o".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/CFR-2012-title21-vol2/CFR-2012-title21-vol2-sec101-2|title=21 CFR 101.2 - Information panel of package form food.|website=www.gpo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, ''Trans'' fat was required to be listed under saturated fat. This was the first significant change to the Nutrition Facts panel since it was introduced in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=23786&amp;page=2|title=Trans Fats  Added To Nutrition Labels|website=MedicineNet|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 revision===
In 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposed several simultaneous improvements to nutrition labeling for the first time in over 20 years.&lt;ref name="fdanewlabel"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm385663.htm|title = Proposed Changes to the Nutrition Facts Label|date = 1 August 2014|accessdate = 15 February 2015|website = U.S. Food and Drug Administration|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/UCM395422.pdf|title = Nutrition Facts Label: Proposed Changes Aim to Better Inform Food Choices|date = February 2014|accessdate = 15 February 2015|website = Consumer Health Information|publisher = US Food and Drug Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed changes were based on trends of consumption of nutrients of public health importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm387164.htm|title=Proposed Nutrition Facts Label Changes Are Based on Science and Research|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies had shown that the majority of the U.S. population could not understand the information in the then current Nutrition Facts Label.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothman|first=Russell L.|last2=Housam|first2=Ryan|last3=Weiss|first3=Hilary|last4=Davis|first4=Dianne|last5=Gregory|first5=Rebecca|last6=Gebretsadik|first6=Tebeb|last7=Shintani|first7=Ayumi|last8=Elasy|first8=Tom A.|date=2006-11-01|title=Patient Understanding of Food Labels: The Role of Literacy and Numeracy|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379706002819|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|volume=31|issue=5|pages=391–398|doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2006.07.025|pmid=17046410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrition label numeracy is particularly low in older individuals, of black and Hispanic race/ethnicity, who are unemployed, born outside of the US, have lower English proficiency, lower education achievement, lower income, or live in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nogueira|first=Leticia M.|last2=Thai|first2=Chan L.|last3=Nelson|first3=Wendy|last4=Oh|first4=April|date=2016-07-01|title=Nutrition Label Numeracy: Disparities and Association with Health Behaviors|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/png/ajhb/2016/00000040/00000004/art00004?token=005212eec95a666f3a7b6c5340346f3b6b66213b786c49264f65263a3d4f58762f46b03491963582ab|journal=American Journal of Health Behavior|volume=40|issue=4|pages=427–436|doi=10.5993/AJHB.40.4.4|pmid=27338989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposed changes included a new design requiring serving sizes to more accurately reflect how many servings the average individual is actually consuming. The new recommendation also proposed removing “calories from fat”, and instead focusing on total calories and type of fats being consumed in a product. The proposed labels were to also list how much sugar is added (rather than inherent) to a product, as well as declaring the amount of Vitamin D and potassium in a product.&lt;ref name="fdanewlabel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA finalizes menu and vending machine calorie labeling rules|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm423952.htm|website=www.fda.gov|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=25 November 2014|ref=FDA Finalizes Calorie Labeling Rules}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these changes sparked a major debate between the food industry and public health agencies. The proposal to indicate sugar added during food production, in particular, was brought forward by the FDA as a measure to counter the increase in per capita sugar consumption in the US, which over the last decades exceeded the limits recommended by scientific institutions and governmental agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/06/25/how-the-sugar-lobby-helps-perpetuate-that-sweet-tooth-of-yours/|title = How the sugar lobby helps perpetuate that sweet tooth of yours|last = Ferdman|first = Roberto A.|date = 25 June 2014|work = The Washington Post|access-date = 15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/03/added-sugar-labels_n_6604728.html|title = Here's Why Nutrition Labels Should List Added Sugar|last = Weingus|first = Leigh|date = 3 February 2015|work = The Huffington Post|access-date = 15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major American food associations opposed the label change, indicating "lack of merit" and "no preponderance of evidence" to justify the inclusion of sugar added in the new label.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/07/02/the-crucial-fda-nutrition-label-battle-you-probably-dont-know-about-but-should/|title = The crucial FDA nutrition label battle you probably don’t know about, but should|last = Ferdman|first = Roberto A.|date = 2 July 2014|work = The Washington Post|access-date = 15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/04/us-sugar-labels-idUSKBN0G40X020140804|title = Food fight builds as U.S. regulators weigh 'added sugar' label|last = Prentice|first = Chris|date = 4 August 2014|work = Reuters|access-date = 15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules for the new design were finalized on May 20, 2016.  Manufacturers were initially given until July 26, 2018 to comply (or July 26, 2019 if they have less than $10 million in annual food sales).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm385663.htm|title=Labeling &amp; Nutrition - Changes to the Nutrition Facts Label|first=Center for Food Safety and Applied|last=Nutrition|website=www.fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proposed rule by the FDA would extend the compliance deadline to January 1, 2020 (or January 1, 2021 for qualified small business).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FDA-2004-N-0258-0180|title=Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels and Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed at One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments; Proposed Extension of Compliance Dates|first=Anna K.|last=Abram|date=October 2, 2017|access-date=October 3, 2017|publisher=Regulations.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; For food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amounts of vitamins and nutritionally essential minerals in a serving are expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV).

===Alcohol===
In the United States, [[alcoholic beverage]]s are regulated by the [[Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau]] (TTB). As of 2012, the TTB does not require alcoholic beverage packaging to have a nutrition facts label. Since at least 2003, consumer groups have lobbied the TTB to require labelling disclosing Nutrition Facts information.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2011-01-23-alcohol-labels_N.htm |title=Alcohol industry grapples with nutrition labeling |date=2011-01-23 |accessdate=2013-01-20 |agency=USA Today |author=Michelle Locke}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some marketing terms, such as "light" and "table wine", must follow TTB guidelines. Packaging must disclose alcohol content in some circumstances.&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt;{{which|date=June 2018}}

==Nursing==
Qualifications for veterinary nursing in New Zealand underwent a review in 2014/15.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The new qualification being taught from 2016 are:

* Certificate in Animal Technology - Veterinary Nursing Assistant&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitec.ac.nz/career-and-study-options/animal-health-and-welfare/new-zealand-certificate-in-animal-technology-veterinary-nursing-assistant "Veterinary Nursing Assistant"], unitec&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Diploma in Veterinary Nursing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.op.ac.nz/study/natural-sciences/veterinary-nursing/national-diploma-in-veterinary-nursing/ "Diploma in Veterinary Nursing"], Otago Polytechnic&lt;/ref&gt;

The Certificate represents one year of formal training, while the Diploma represents an additional one year with the Certificate (or its equivalent) as a prerequisite.  Other available entry-level certificates include the Certificate in Animal Care&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Certificate in Animal Care|publisher=[[Otago Polytechnic]]|url=http://www.otagopolytechnic.ac.nz/images/information%20sheets/VET%20AC.pdf|accessdate=26 Feb 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Certificate in Rural Animal Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Certificate in Rural Animal Technology (Level 4)|publisher=[[Otago Polytechnic]]|url=http://www.otagopolytechnic.ac.nz/images/information%20sheets/VET%20RV4.pdf|accessdate=1 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-2016;
Veterinary nurses currently hold either of the pre-2016 qualifications:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9193">'''Patient registration''' is the concept and set of methods needed to correlate the reference position of a [[Virtuality|virtual]] [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] [[dataset]] gathered by computer [[medical imaging]] with the reference position of the patient. This procedure is crucial in [[computer assisted surgery]], in order to insure the reproducitibility of the preoperative registration and the clinical situation during surgery.
The use of the term "patient registration" out of this context can lead to a confusion with the procedure of registering a patient into the files of a medical institution.

==The larger context==
In [[computer assisted surgery]], the first step is to gather a 3D dataset that reproduces with great accuracy the geometry of the normal and pathological tissues in the region that has to be operated on. This is mainly obtained by using [[Computed tomography|CT]] or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scans of that region. The role of patient registration is to obtain a close-to-ideal reference reproducibility of the dataset – in order to correlate the position (offset) of the gathered dataset with the patient's position during the surgical intervention. Patient registration (1) eliminates the necessity of maintaining the same strict position of the patient during both preoperative scanning and surgery, and (2) provides the surgical robot the necessary reference information to act accurately on the patient, even if he has (been) moved during the intervention.

==Evolution of the concept==
Patient registration was used mostly in head surgery – oral and maxillofacial surgery, neurosurgery, otolaryngology. With the advent of marker- and markerless-registration, the concept has been extended for abdominal surgery.

===Patient registration using headframes===
The first attempts in 3D mapping of human tissues were made by [[Victor Horsley|V. Horsley]] and R. Clarke in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke RH, Horsley V: ''On a method of investigating the deep ganglia and tracts of the central nervous system (cerebellum)'', Br Med J 2: 1799–1800, 1906&lt;/ref&gt; They have built a rectangular [[stereotactic]] headframe that had to be fixed to the head. It was based on cartesian principles and allowed them to accurately and reproductibly guide needle-like electrodes for neurophysiological experiments. They have experimented animals and were able to contribute to the mapping of the cerebellum. Improved versions of the [[Horsley–Clarke apparatus]] are still in used today in experimental neurosurgery.

The first stereotactic device for humans was also developed in neurosurgery, by E. Spiegel and H. Wycis in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Spiegel EA, Wycis HT, Marks M, Lee AS: ''Stereotaxic apparatus for operations on the human brain'', Science 106:349–350, 1947&lt;/ref&gt; It was used for surgical treatment of [[Parkinson's disease]] and, during time, its applicability was extended for the surgical treatment of tumors, vascular malformations, functional neurosurgery etc. The system was based both on headframes and X-ray images taken for all three planes of space.

Further development of stereotactic surgery was made by Brown, Roberts and Wells in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Heilbrun MP, Roberts TS, Apuzzo MLJ, Wells TH, Sabshin JK: ''Preliminary experience with Brown–Roberts–Wells (BRW) computerized-tomography stereotaxic guidance-system'', J Neurosurg 59(2):217–222, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; They have developed a halo ring that was applied on the skull, during a [[Computed tomography|CT]] scan and neurosurgical interventions. This method provided improved surgical guidance and was in fact the first development of computer guided surgery.

Patient registration for the head area has developed for nearly two decades on the same principle of combining CT scans with mechanical reference devices such as headframes or halo rings. But the clinical experience showed that headgear is very uncomfortable to wear and even impossible to apply on little children, because their lack of cooperation; furthermore, the headframes can create [[artifact (observational)|artifacts]] in preoperative data gathering, or during surgery.

===Patient registration using reference markers===

====''Patient registration using skin markers''====
In 1986, a different approach was developed by Roberts und Strohbehn.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts DW, Strohbehn JW, Hatch JF, Murray W, Kettenberger H: ''A frameless stereotaxic integration of computerized tomographic imaging and the operating microscope'', J Neurosurg 65: 545–549, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; They have used as landmarks several markers on the patient's skin both preoperative CT registration, and intraoperatively. This was a new current of the time in patient registration. Still, the method is time-consuming, and the exact reproducitibility of the marker positions is questionable.

====''Patient registration using bone markers''====
The bony structures can provide a much better stability and reproducibility of the landmarks for patient registration. Based on this concept, a further technique was used: to implant temporary markers into bone structures that are superficial to the skin, under local anestesia.&lt;ref&gt;Alp MS, Dujovny M, Misra M et al.: ''Head registration techniques for image-guided surgery.'' Neurological Research 20: 31–37, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; This was also combined with surface markers and CT registration.&lt;ref&gt;Maurer C, Aboutanos G, Dawant B: ''Registration of CT and MR brain images using a combination of points and surfaces medical imaging: image processing.'' Spie Press 2434:109–123, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The technique has the disadvantage of a further minimal surgical procedure of placing the bone implants, with some risk of infection for the patient.

[[Image:SurgicalPlanningArtikulator.jpg|thumb|Surgical planning using [[bone segment navigation]] for the [[osteotomy]] of the jaw bones, based on models fixed into an [[articulator]] (registration based on infrared devices)]]

====''Patient registration using markers on a dental splint''====
Dental splints have been traditionally used for transferring and reproducing 3D reference landmarks for positioning cast models in [[articulator]]s – in [[Prosthodontics|dental prosthetics]], [[orthodontics]] and orthognatic surgery. By applying several infrared markers on the splints and using an infrared camera, a better registration was obtained.&lt;ref&gt;Hassfeld S, Mühling J, Zöller J: ''Intraoperative navigation in oral and maxillofacial surgery'', Int J Oral Maxillofac Surg 24: 111–119, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===Markerless patient registration===

====''Markerless patient registration using anatomical landmarks''====
The first attempts, based on the identification of anatomical landmarks were made by Caversaccio and Zulliger.&lt;ref&gt;Caversaccio M., Zulliger D., Bächler R., et al.: ''Practical Aspects for Optimal Registration (Matching) on the Lateral Skull Base With an Optical Frameless Computer-Aided Pointer System.'' The American Journal of Otology 21:863–870, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The method was based on identifying certain antropometrical points and other anatomical landmarks on the skull, in correlation with the CT registration. But the landmarks cannot be exactly pointed out and reproduced during patient dataset registration and surgery, therefore the method is not precise enough.

[[Image:SSNSchemaEnglish.jpg|thumb|Schematic representation of the SSN system]]
[[Image:SSNimOP.jpg|thumb|Actual usage of the SSN system in the operating room]]

====''Markerless patient registration using surface registration''====
Since 1998, new procedures have been developed by Marmulla and co-workers, using a different approach to the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Marmulla R, Niederdellmann H: ''Computer-assisted bone segment navigation'', J Craniomaxillofac Surg 26:347–359, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marmulla R, Lüth T, Mühling J, Hassfeld S: ''Markerless Laser Registration in Image-Guided Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery'', J Oral Maxillofac Surg 62:845–851, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Both during CT dataset gathering and surgical intervention, the patient registration was made by registering complete areas and surfaces, instead of distinctive surface markers. This was achieved by using laser scanners and a small guiding transmitter. The precision of the patient registration was significantly improved with this method.

Based on this concept, several registration and navigation systems were built by the same team. The [[Surgical segment navigator|Surgical Segment Navigator (SSN and SSN++)]] is such a system, developed for the first time for [[oral and maxillofacial surgery]]. This system correlates three different coordinate sets: CT data set, surface laser scan data set and the dataset produced by a small guiding transmitter, placed on the patient's head. The Laboratory Unit for Computer-Assisted Surgery (LUCAS) is used for planning surgery in the laboratory. This technological and surgical advance has permitted the elimination of mechanical guidance systems and improved the accuracy of the determinations, and thus the surgical act.

== Description ==

The concept is usually referenced to the work of Jesse Ausubel and Iddo Wernick.&lt;ref name=sandetal/&gt;&lt;ref name="Norberg2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johan Norberg|title=Progress: Ten Reasons to Look Forward to the Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rk34DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA236|date=1 September 2016|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-951-8|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryce2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Bryce|title=Smaller Faster Lighter Denser Cheaper: How Innovation Keeps Proving the Catastrophists Wrong|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mc5nAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA151|date=13 May 2014|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1-61039-206-8|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; They predict that over the next fifty years an area of at least 146 million hectares is going to be released from farming and will probably revert to its natural state.&lt;ref name="Bryce2014"/&gt; As [[Land development|land conversion]] (from a natural state to human use) is one of the greatest threats to the natural environment in general, and [[biodiversity]] in particular, this is seen as good for the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.nature.org/conservancy/2013/01/22/are-we-close-to-peak-farmland/|title=Are We Close to Peak Farmland? {{!}} Conservancy Talk|date=22 January 2013|newspaper=Conservancy Talk|access-date=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|Together with Iddo Wernick [...] we believe that humanity has reached Peak Farmland, and that a large net global restoration of land to Nature is ready to begin. Happily, the cause is not exhaustion of arable land, as many have feared, but rather moderation of population and tastes and ingenuity of farmers. – Jesse H. Ausubel&lt;ref&gt;Jesse H. Ausubel, [http://phe.rockefeller.edu/docs/Peak%20Farmland%2018%20Dec%20lecture%20Ausubel(1).pdf Peak Farmland], Lecture for the 18 December 2012 Symposium in Honor of the 80th Birthday of Paul Demeny and his retirement as editor of Population and Development Review&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Geisler and Currens note, however, that "Peak Farmland, though newly named, is a long-standing issue" that has been debated by scholars for decades.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The issue deals with two opposing views: one that predicts that more and more farmland will be needed to sustain the growing [[world population]], and the other (the peak farmland view) that progress in agricultural techniques, measured in steadily increasing crop yields from a set amount of farmland, will result in a decrease in the amount of farmland needed to feed the world's population, eventually leading to a decrease in the world's acreage of farmland.&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crops-idUSBRE8BG0QH20121217|title="Peak farmland" is here, crop area to diminish: study|date=17 December 2016|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norberg2016" /&gt;

The '''"potato riots"''' were the mass anti-[[serfdom]] movement of ''udelnye krestyane'' (imperial [[peasant]]s; peasants in the personal property lands of the Russian imperial house) in 1834, and of [[state peasants]] in 1840–44, in [[Russian Empire]]. The reason for the rebellion was the coercive introduction  of [[potato]] cultivation. The government selected the best fertile sections for potatoes from peasant lands. Authorities enforced brutal punishments for the non-fulfillment of the orders and assessed different requisitions. In 1834 unrest flared up in [[Kirov Oblast|Vyatsky]] and [[Vladimir Oblast|Vladimir]] provinces, but it reached its height among the state peasants in 1840–44. Riots appeared simultaneously and they were partly in response to [[Pavel Kiselyov]]'s reforms of state villages (1837–41). In the provinces of [[Ural (region)|Ural]] and the lower [[Volga Region]] more than 500,000 peasants rose up destroying sowings of potatoes, and thrashing officials. They arbitrarily re-elected wardens, and attacked punitive detachments with weapons. Aside from ethnic Russians, participants in the riots included the [[Mari people|Mari]] population, [[Chuvash people|Chuvashes]], [[Udmurt people|Udmurt]]s, [[Tatars]], and [[Komi people|Komi]]. The government sent troops to suppress the riots. In a number of places, peasants were shot. Thousands of rebels were convicted, and exiled into [[Siberia]] or forcibly drafted as soldiers.

The eschatological rumours associating potato planting with the service to the Antichrist has also contributed to the magnitude of the disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.li/2gJbN#selection-643.1-659.68 Холерные и картофельные бунты первой половины XIX века как отражение религиозного мировоззрения русского крестьянства]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9911">'''Prevalence''' in [[epidemiology]] is the proportion of a particular population found to be affected by a medical condition (typically a disease or a risk factor such as smoking or seat-belt use). It is derived by comparing the number of people found to have the condition with the total number of people studied, and is usually expressed as a fraction, as a percentage, or as the number of cases per 10,000 or 100,000 people. '''Point prevalence'''&lt;!--Redirects here, bolded per MOS:BOLD--&gt; is the proportion of a population that has the condition at a specific point in time. '''Period prevalence'''&lt;!--Redirects here, bolded per MOS:BOLD--&gt; is the proportion of a population that has the condition at some time during a given period (e.g., 12 month prevalence), and includes people who already have the condition at the start of the study period as well as those who acquire it during that period. '''Lifetime prevalence'''&lt;!--Redirects here, bolded per MOS:BOLD--&gt; (LTP) is the proportion of a population that at some point in their life (up to the time of assessment) have experienced the condition.&lt;ref name="Rothman2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth J. Rothman|title=Epidemiology: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKs7adtH-_IC&amp;pg=PA53|date=21 June 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-975455-7|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prevalence estimates are used by epidemiologists, health care providers, government agencies, toxicologists, and insurers.

Prevalence is contrasted with [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]], which is a measure of ''new'' cases arising in a population over a given period (month, year, etc.). The difference between prevalence and incidence can be summarized thus: prevalence answers "How many people have this disease right now?" or "How many people have had this disease during this time period?" and incidence answers "How many people per year newly acquire this disease?"

==Examples and utility==
In science, ''prevalence'' describes a [[ratio|proportion]] (typically expressed as a [[percentage]]).  For example, the prevalence of obesity among American adults in 2001 was estimated by the U. S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control (CDC)]] at approximately 20.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/obesity/trend/prev_reg.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519084009/http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/obesity/trend/prev_reg.htm |archivedate=2007-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prevalence is a term which means being widespread and it is distinct from [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]]. Prevalence is a measurement of ''all'' individuals affected by the disease at a particular time, whereas incidence is a measurement of the number of ''new'' individuals who contract a disease during a particular period of time. Prevalence is a useful parameter when talking about long lasting diseases, such as [[HIV]], but incidence is more useful when talking about diseases of short duration, such as [[chickenpox]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Uses==

===Lifetime prevalence===
'''Lifetime prevalence''' (LTP) is the proportion of individuals in a population that at some point in their life (up to the time of assessment) have experienced a "case", e.g., a disease; a traumatic event; or a behavior, such as committing a crime. Often, a 12-month prevalence (or some other type of "period prevalence") is provided in conjunction with lifetime prevalence. ''Point prevalence'' is the prevalence of disorder at a specific point in time (a month or less). ''Lifetime morbid risk'' is "the proportion of a population that might become afflicted with a given disease at any point in their lifetime."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-937806-7| others = S. Charles Schulz, Michael Foster Green, Katharine J.

Charles|page=7|location = New York|date = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Period prevalence===
'''Period prevalence''' is the proportion of the population with a given disease or condition over a specific period of time. It could describe how many people in a population had a cold over the cold season in 2006, for example. It is expressed as a percentage of the population and can be described by the following formula:

Period prevalence (ratio) = Number of cases that existed in a given period ÷ Number of people in the population during this period

The relationship between incidence (rate), point prevalence (ratio) and period prevalence (ratio) is easily explained via an analogy with photography. Point prevalence is akin to a flashlit photograph: what is happening at this instant frozen in time. Period prevalence is analogous to a long exposure (seconds, rather than an instant) photograph: the number of events recorded in the photo whilst the camera shutter was open. In a movie each frame records an instant (point prevalence); by looking from frame to frame one notices new events (incident events) and can relate the number of such events to a period (number of frames); see [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence rate]].

===Point prevalence===
'''Point prevalence''' is a measure of the proportion of people in a population who have a disease or condition at a particular time, such as a particular date. It is like a snap shot of the disease in time. It can be used for statistics on the occurrence of [[chronic diseases]]. This is in contrast to [[period prevalence]] which is a measure of the proportion of people in a population who have a disease or condition over a specific period of time, say a season, or a year. Point prevalence can be described by the formula: Prevalence = Number of existing cases on a specific date ÷ Number of people in the population on this date &lt;ref&gt;

==Limitations==
It can be said that a very small error applied over a very large number of individuals (that is, those who are ''not affected'' by the condition in the general population during their lifetime; for example, over 95%) produces a relevant, non-negligible number of subjects who are incorrectly classified as having the condition or any other condition which is the object of a survey study: these subjects are the so-called false positives; such reasoning applies to the 'false positive' but not the 'false negative' problem where we have an error applied over a relatively very small number of individuals to begin with (that is, those who are ''affected'' by the condition in the general population; for example, less than 5%). Hence, a very high percentage of subjects who seem to have a history of a disorder at interview are false positives for such a medical condition and apparently never suffered a fully clinical [[syndrome]].

A different but related problem in evaluating the public health significance of psychiatric conditions has been highlighted by [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]] of [[Columbia University]]: fulfillment of [[diagnostic criteria]] and the resulting [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] do not necessarily imply need for treatment.&lt;ref name=Spitzer1998&gt;{{cite journal | first = Robert | last = Spitzer | date = February 1998 | title = Diagnosis and need for treatment are not the same | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 120 | url = http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9477924 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.55.2.120 | pmid = 9477924 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110705210403/http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9477924 | archivedate = 2011-07-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known statistical problem arises when ascertaining rates for disorders and conditions with a relatively low population prevalence or [[base rate]]. Even assuming that lay interview diagnoses are highly accurate in terms of [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] and [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]] and their corresponding area under the [[ROC curve]] (that is, [[Area under the curve|AUC]], or area under the [[receiver operating characteristic]] curve), a condition with a relatively low prevalence or base-rate is bound to yield high [[Type I and type II errors|false positive]] rates, which exceed [[Type I and type II errors|false negative]] rates; in such a circumstance a limited [[positive predictive value]], PPV, yields high [[false positive]] rates even in presence of a specificity which is very close to 100%.&lt;ref name=Baldessarini1993&gt;{{cite journal | first = Ross J. | last = Baldessarini |author2=Finklestein S. |author3=Arana G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55745">'''Protein engineering''' is the process of developing useful or valuable [[protein]]s. It is a young discipline, with much research taking place into the understanding of [[protein folding]] and recognition for [[protein design]] principles.  It is also a product and services market, with an estimated value of $168 billion by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/speeding-up-the-protein-assembly-line/5418/ |title= Speeding Up the Protein Assembly Line |last= Liszewski|first= Kathy |date= 15 February 2015 |work= [[Gen.

There are two general strategies for protein engineering: [[protein design|rational protein design]] and [[directed evolution]].  These methods are not mutually exclusive; researchers will often apply both.  In the future, more detailed knowledge of [[protein structure]] and [[Protein function|function]], and advances in [[high-throughput screening]], may greatly expand the abilities of protein engineering.  Eventually, even unnatural amino acids may be included, via newer methods, such as [[expanded genetic code]], that allow encoding novel amino acids in genetic code.

==Approaches==

=== Rational design ===
{{main|Protein design}}
In rational protein design, a scientist uses detailed knowledge of the structure and function of a protein to make desired changes. In general, this has the advantage of being inexpensive and technically easy, since [[site-directed mutagenesis]] methods are well-developed. However, its major drawback is that detailed structural knowledge of a protein is often unavailable, and, even when available, it can be very difficult to predict the effects of various mutations since structural information most often provide a static picture of a protein structure. However, programs such as [[Folding@home]] and [[Foldit]] have utilized [[crowdsourcing]] techniques in order to gain insight into the folding motifs of proteins. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farmer|first1=Tylar|last2=Bohse|first2=Patrick|last3=Kerr|first3=Diane|title=Rational Design Protein Engineering Through Crowdsourcing|journal=Journal of Student Research|date=2017|volume=6|issue=2|url=http://www.jofsr.com/index.php/path/article/view/377/168|accessdate=27 April 2018|issn=2167-1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Computational protein design [[algorithm]]s seek to identify novel amino acid sequences that are low in energy when folded to the pre-specified target structure. While the sequence-conformation space that needs to be searched is large, the most challenging requirement for computational protein design is a fast, yet accurate, energy function that can distinguish optimal sequences from similar suboptimal ones.

===Multiple Sequence Alignment===

Without structural information about a protein, sequence analysis is often useful in elucidating information about the protein. These techniques involve alignment of target protein sequences with other related protein sequences. This alignment can show which amino acids are conserved between species and are important for the function of the protein. These analyses can help to identify hot spot amino acids that can serve as the target sites for mutations. [[Multiple sequence alignment]] utilizes data bases such as PREFAB, SABMARK, OXBENCH, IRMBASE, and BALIBASE in order to cross reference target protein sequences with known sequences. Multiple sequence alignment techniques are listed below.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook&gt;{{cite book|last1=Poluri|first1=Krishna Mohan|last2=Gulati|first2=Khushboo|title=Protein Engineering Techniques|date=2017|publisher=Springer|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-981-10-2732-1|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

This method begins by performing pair wise alignment of sequences using [[k-tuple]] or [[Needleman–Wunsch algorithm|Needleman–Wunsch]] methods. These methods calculate a matrix that depicts the pair wise similarity among the sequence pairs. Similarity scores are then transformed into distance scores that are used to produce a guide tree using the neighbor joining method. This guide tree is then employed to yield a multiple sequence alignment.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Clustal Omega====

This method is capable of aligning up to 190,00 sequences by utilizing the k-tuple method. Next sequences are clustered using the mBed and [[k-means clustering|''k''-means]] methods. A guide tree is then constructed using the [[UPGMA]] method that is used by the HH align package. This guide tree is used to generate multiple sequence alignments.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====MAFFT====
This method utilizes Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) that converts amino acid sequences into a sequence composed of volume and polarity values for each amino acid residue. This new sequence is used to find homologous regions.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====K-Align====

This method utilizes the Wu-Manber approximate string matching algorithm to generate multiple sequence alignments.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Multiple Sequence Comparison by Log Expectation (MUSCLE)====

This method utilizes Kmer and Kimura distances to generate multiple sequence alignments.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====T-Coffee====

This method utilizes tree based consistency objective functions for alignment evolution. This method has been shown to be 5-10% more accurate than Clustal W.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

===Coevolutionary Analysis===

Coevolutionary analysis is also known as correlated mutation, covariation, or co-substitution. This type of rational design involves reciprocal evolutionary changes at evolutionarily interacting loci. Generally this method begins with the generation of a curated multiple sequence alignments for the target sequence. This alignment is then subjected to manual refinement that involves removal of highly gapped sequences also sequences with low sequence identity. This step increases the quality of the alignment. Next, the manually processed alignment is utilized for further coevolutionary measurements using distinct correlated mutation algorithms. These algorithms result in a coevolution scoring matrix. This matrix is filtered by applying various significance tests to extract significant coevolution values and wipe out background noise. Coevolutionary measurements are further evaluated to assess their performance and stringency. Finally, the results from this coevolutionary analysis are validated experimentally.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

===Structural Prediction===

''De Novo'' synthesis of protein benefits from knowledge of existing protein structures. This knowledge of existing protein structure assists with the prediction of new protein structures. Methods for protein structure prediction fall under one of the four following classes:  ''ab initio,'' fragment based methods, homology modeling, and protein threading.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====''Ab initio''====

These methods involve free modeling without using any structural information about the template. ''Ab initio''  methods are aimed at prediction of the native structures of proteins corresponding to the global minimum of its free energy. some examples of ''ab initio'' methods are AMBER, GROMOS, GROMACS, CHARMM, OPLS, and ENCEPP12. General steps for  ''ab initio'' methods begin with the geometric representation of the protein of interest. Next, a potential energy function model for the protein is developed. This model can be created using either molecular mechanics potentials or protein structure derived potential functions. Following the development of a potential model, energy search techniques including molecular dynamic simulations, Monte Carlo simulations and genetic algorithms are applied to the protein.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Fragment based====

These methods use database information regarding structures to match homologous structures to the created protein sequences. These homologous structures are assembled to give compact structures using scoring and optimization procedures, with the goal of achieving the lowest potential energy score. Webservers for fragment information are listed here: I-TASSER, ROSETTA, ROSETTA @ home, FRAGFOLD, CABS fold, PROFESY, CREF, QUARK, UNDERTAKER, HMM, and ANGLOR.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{rp|72}}

====Homology modeling====

These methods are based upon the homology of proteins. These methods are also known as comparative modeling. The first step in homology modeling is generally the identification of template sequences of known structure which are homologous to the query sequence. Next the query sequence is aligned to the template sequence. Following the alignment, the structurally conserved regions are modeled using the template structure. This is followed by the modeling of side chains and loops that are distinct from the template. Finally the modeled structure undergoes refirnment and assessment of quality. Servers that are available for homology modeling data are listed here: SWISS MODEL, MODELLER, ReformAlign, PyMOD, TIP-STRUCTFAST, COMPASS, 3d-PSSM, SAMT02, SAMT99, HHPRED, FAGUE, 3D-JIGSAW, META-PP, ROSETTA, and I-TASSER.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Protein threading====

Protein threading can be used when a reliable homologue for the query sequence cannot be found. This method begins by obtaining a query sequence and a library of template structures. Next, the query sequence is threaded over known template structures. These candidate models are scored using scoring functions. These are scored based upon potential energy models of both query and template sequence. The match with the lowest potential energy model is then selected. Methods and servers for retrieving threading data and performing calculations are listed here: GenTHREADER, pGenTHREADER, pDomTHREADER, ORFEUS, PROSPECT, BioShell-Threading, FFASO3, RaptorX, HHPred, LOOPP server, Sparks-X, SEGMER, THREADER2, ESYPRED3D, LIBRA, TOPITS, RAPTOR, COTH, MUSTER.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

For more information on rational design see [[Site-directed mutagenesis]].

=== Directed evolution ===
{{main|Directed evolution}}
In directed evolution, random [[mutagenesis]], e.g. by [[error-prone PCR]] or [[Sequence Saturation Mutagenesis]], is applied to a protein, and a selection regime is used to select variants having desired traits.  Further rounds of mutation and selection are then applied.  This method mimics natural [[evolution]] and, in general, produces superior results to rational design. An added process, termed [[DNA shuffling]], mixes and matches pieces of successful variants to produce better results.  Such processes mimic the [[homologous recombination|recombination]] that occurs naturally during [[sexual reproduction]].  Advantages of directed evolution are that it requires no prior structural knowledge of a protein, nor is it necessary to be able to predict what effect a given mutation will have.  Indeed, the results of directed evolution experiments are often surprising in that desired changes are often caused by mutations that were not expected to have some effect.  The drawback is that they require [[high-throughput screening]], which is not feasible for all proteins.  Large amounts of [[recombinant DNA]] must be mutated and the products screened for desired traits.  The large number of variants often requires expensive robotic equipment to automate the process.  Further, not all desired activities can be screened for easily.

Natural Darwinian evolution can be effectively imitated in the lab toward tailoring protein properties for diverse applications, including catalysis. Many experimental technologies exist to produce large and diverse protein libraries and for screening or selecting folded, functional variants. Folded proteins arise surprisingly frequently in random sequence space, an occurrence exploitable in evolving selective binders and catalysts. While more conservative than direct selection from deep sequence space, redesign of existing proteins by random mutagenesis and selection/screening is a particularly robust method for optimizing or altering extant properties. It also represents an excellent starting point for achieving more ambitious engineering goals. Allying experimental evolution with modern computational methods is likely the broadest, most fruitful strategy for generating functional macromolecules unknown to nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jäckel|first=Christian|last2=Kast|first2=Peter|last3=Hilvert|first3=Donald|date=2008-05-07|title=Protein Design by Directed Evolution|url=http://annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125832|journal=Annual Review of Biophysics|language=en|volume=37|issue=1|pages=153–173|doi=10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main challenges of designing high quality mutant libraries have shown significant progress in the recent past. This progress has been in the form of better descriptions of the effects  of mutational loads on protein traits. Also computational approaches have showed large advances in the innumerably large sequence space to more manageable screenable sizes, thus creating smart libraries of mutants. Library size has also been reduced to more screenable sizes by the identification of key beneficial residues using algorithms for systematic recombination. Finally a significant step forward toward efficient reengineering of enzymes has been made with the development of more accurate statistical models and algorithms quantifying and predicting coupled mutational effects on protein functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shivange|first=Amol V|last2=Marienhagen|first2=Jan|last3=Mundhada|first3=Hemanshu|last4=Schenk|first4=Alexander|last5=Schwaneberg|first5=Ulrich|title=Advances in generating functional diversity for directed protein evolution|url=http://za2uf4ps7f.search.serialssolutions.com.proxy2.cl.msu.edu/?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;url_ctx_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.atitle=Advances%20in%20generating%20functional%20diversity%20for%20directed%20protein%20evolution&amp;rft.aufirst=Amol%20V.&amp;rft.aulast=Shivange&amp;rft.date=2009&amp;rft.epage=25&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.issn=1367-5931&amp;rft.issue=1&amp;rft.jtitle=CURRENT%20OPINION%20IN%20CHEMICAL%20BIOLOGY&amp;rft.pages=19-25&amp;rft.spage=19&amp;rft.stitle=CURR%20OPIN%20CHEM%20BIOL&amp;rft.volume=13&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/www.isinet.com:WoK:UA&amp;rft.au=Marienhagen,%20Jan&amp;rft.au=Mundhada,%20Hemanshu&amp;rft.au=Schenk,%20Alexander&amp;rft.au=Schwaneberg,%20Ulrich&amp;rft_id=info:pmid/19261539&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016/j.cbpa.2009.01.019|journal=Current Opinion in Chemical Biology|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=19–25|doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2009.01.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, directed evolution may be summarized as an iterative two step process which involves generation of protein mutant libraries, and high throughput screening processes to select for variants with improved traits. This technique does not require prior knowledge of the protein structure and function relationship. Directed evolution utilizes random or focused mutagenesis to generate libraries of mutant proteins. Random mutations can be introduced using either error prone PCR, or site saturation mutagenesis. Mutants may also be generated using recombination of multiple homologous genes. Nature has evolved a limited number of beneficial sequences. Directed evolution makes it possible to identify undiscovered protein sequences which have novel functions. This ability is contingent on the proteins ability to tolerant amino acid residue substitutions without compromising folding or stability.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

Directed evolution methods can be broadly categorized into two strategies, asexual and sexual methods.

=== Asexual Methods ===
Asexual methods do not generate any cross links between parental genes. Single genes are used to create mutant libraries using various mutagenic techniques. These asexual methods can produce either random or focused mutagenesis.

==== Random Mutagenesis ====
Random mutagenic methods produce mutations at random throughout the gene of interest. Random mutagenesis can introduce the following types of mutations: transitions, transversions, insertions, deletions, inversion, missense, and nonsense. Examples of methods for producing random mutagenesis are below.

====Error Prone PCR====

Error prone PCR utilizes the fact that Taq DNA polymerase lacks 3' to 5' exonuclease activity. This results in an error rate of 0.001-0.002% per nucleotide per replication. This method begins with choosing the gene, or the area within a gene, one wishes to mutate. Next, the extent of error required is calculated based upon the type and extent of activity one wishes to generate. This extent of error determines the error prone PCR strategy to be employed. Following PCR, the genes are cloned into a plasmid and introduced to competent cell systems. These cells are then screened for desired traits. Plasmids are then isolated for colonies which show improved traits, and are then used as templates the next round of mutagenesis. Error prone PCR shows biases for certain mutations relative to others. Such as biases for transitions over transversions.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

Rates of error in PCR can be increased in the following ways:&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}
# Increase concentration of magnesium chloride, which stabilizes non complementary base pairing.
# Add manganese chloride to reduce base pair specificity. 
# Increased and unbalanced addition of dNTPs.
# Addition of base analogs like dITP, 8 oxo-dGTP, and dPTP.
# Increase concentration of Taq polymerase.
# Increase extension time.
# Increase cycle time.
# Use less accurate Taq polymerase.
Also see [[Polymerase chain reaction]] for more information.

====Rolling circle error-prone PCR====

This PCR method is based upon rolling circle amplification, which is modeled from the method that bacteria use to amplify circular DNA. This method results in linear  DNA duplexes. These fragments contain tandem repeats of circular DNA called concatamers, which can be transformed into bacterial strains. Mutations are introduced by first cloning the target sequence into an appropriate plasmid. Next, the amplification process begins using random hexamer primers and Φ29  DNA polymerase under error prone rolling circle amplification conditions. Additional conditions to produce error prone rolling circle amplification are 1.5 pM of template DNA, 1.5 mM MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a 24 hour reaction time. MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is added into the reaction mixture to promote random point mutations in the DNA strands. Mutation rates can be increased by increasing the concentration of MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or by decreasing concentration of the template DNA. Error prone rolling circle amplification is advantageous relative to error prone PCR because of its use of universal random hexamer primers, rather than specific primers. Also the reaction products of this amplification do not need to be treated with ligases or endonucleases. This reaction is isothermal.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Chemical mutagenesis====

Chemical mutagenesis involves the use of chemical agents to introduce mutations into genetic sequences. Examples of chemical mutagens follow:

&lt;u&gt;Sodium Bisulfate&lt;/u&gt; - This mutagenic agent is effective at mutating G/C rich genomic sequences. This is because sodium bisulfate catalyses deamination of unmethylated cytosine to uracil.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

&lt;u&gt;Ethyl Methane Sulfonate&lt;/u&gt; - This chemical agent alkylates guanidine residues. This alteration causes errors during DNA replication.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

&lt;u&gt;Nitrous Acid&lt;/u&gt; - This chemical agent causes transversion by de-amination of adenine and cytosine.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

The dual approach to random chemical mutagenesis is an iterative two step process. First it involves the ''in vivo'' chemical mutagenesis of the gene of interest via EMS. Next, the treated gene is isolated and cloning into an untreated expression vector in order to prevent mutations in the plasmid backbone.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}} This technique preserves the plasmids genetic properties.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Targeting Glycosylases to Embedded Arrays for Mutagenesis (TaGTEAM)====

This method has been used to create targeted  ''in vivo'' mutagenesis in yeast. This method involves the fusion of a 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase to tetR DNA-binding domain. This has been shown to increase mutation rates by over 800 time in regions of the genome containing tetO sites.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Mutagenesis by Random Insertion and Deletion====

This method involves alteration in length of the sequence via simultaneous deletion and insertion of chunks of bases of arbitrary length. This method has been shown to produce proteins with new functionalities via introduction of new restriction sites, specific codons, four base codons for non-natural amino acids.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Transposon Based Random Mutagenesis====

Recently many methods for transposon based random mutagenesis have been reported. This methods include, but are not limited to the following: PERMUTE-Random Circular Permutation, random protein truncation, random nucleotide triplet substitution, random domain/tag/multiple amino acid insertion, codon scanning mutagenesis, and multicodon scanning mutagenesis. These aforementioned techniques all require the design of mini-Mu transposons. Thermo scientific manufactures kits for the design of these transposons.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Random Mutagenesis Methods Altering the Target DNA Length====

These methods involve altering gene length via insertion and deletion mutations. An example is the Tandem Repeat Inserstion (TRINS) method. This technique results in the generation of tandem repeats of random fragments of the target gene via rolling circle amplification and concurrent incorporation of these repeats into the target gene.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Mutator strains====

Mutator strains are bacterial cell lines which are deficient in one or more DNA repair mechanisms. An example of a mutator strand is the E. coli XL1-RED.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}} This subordinate strain of E. coli is deficient in the MutS, MutD, MutT DNA repair pathways. Use of mutator strains is useful at introducing many types of mutation; however, these strains show progressive sickness of culture because of the accumulation of mutations in the strains own genome.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

==== Focused mutagenesis ====
Focused mutagenic methods produce mutations at predetermined amino acid residues. These techniques require and understanding of the sequence-function relationship for the protein of interest. Understanding of this relationship allows for the identification of residues which are important in stability, stereoselectivity, and catalytic efficiency.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}} Examples of methods that produce focused mutagenesis are below.

====Site saturation mutagenesis====

Site saturation mutagenesis is a PCR based method used to target amino acids with significant roles in protein function. The two most common techniques for performing this are whole plasmid single PCR, and overlap extension PCR.

Whole plasmid single PCR is also referred to as site directed mutagenesis (SDM). SDM products are subjected to Dpn endonuclease digestion. This digestion results in cleavage of only the parental strand, because the parental strand contains a GmATC which is methylated at N6 of adenine. SDM does not work well for large plasmids of over ten kilobases. Also, this method is only capable of replacing two nucleotides at a time.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

Overlap extension PCR requires the use of two pairs of primers. One primer in each set contains a mutation. A first round of PCR using these primer sets is performed and two double stranded DNA duplexes are formed. A second round of PCR is then performed in which these duplexes are denatured and annealed with the primer sets again to produce heteroduplexes, in which each strand has a mutation. Any gaps in these newly formed heteroduplexes are filled with DNA polymerases and further amplified.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====[[Sequence saturation mutagenesis]] (SeSaM)====

This technique results in the randomization of the target sequence at every nucleotide position. This method begins with the generation of variable length DNA fragments tailed with universal bases via the use of template transferases at the 3' termini. Next, these fragments are extended to full length using a single stranded template. The universal bases are replaced with a random standard base, causing mutations. There are several modified versions of this method such as SeSAM-Tv-II, SeSAM-Tv+, and SeSAM-III.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Single primer reactions in parallel (SPRINP)====

This site saturation mutagenesis method involves two separate PCR reaction. The first of which uses only forward primers, while the second reaction uses only reverse primers. This avoids the formation of primer dimer formation.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Mega Primed and Ligase Free Focused Mutagenesis====

This site saturation mutagenic technique begins with one mutagenic oligonucleotide and one universal flanking primer. These two reactants are used for an initial PCR cycle. Products from this first PCR cycle are used as mega primers for the next PCR.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Ω-PCR====

This site saturation mutagenic method is based on overlap extension PCR. It is used to introduce mutations at any site in a circular plasmid.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====PFunkel-Ominchange-OSCARR====

This method utilizes user defined site directed mutagenesis at single or multiple sites simultaneously. OSCARR is an acronym for One Pot Simple Methodology for Cassette Randomization and Recombination. This randomization and recombination results in randomization of desired fragments of a protein. Omnichange is a sequence independent, multisite saturation mutagenesis which can saturate up to five independent codons on a gene.

====Trimer-Dimer Mutagenesis====

This method removes redundant codons and stop codons.

====Cassette Mutagenesis====

This is a PCR based method. Cassette mutagenesis begins with the synthesis of a DNA cassette containing the gene of interest, which is flanked on either side by restriction sites. The endonuclease which cleaves these restriction sites also cleaves sites in the target plasmid. The DNA cassette and the target plasmid are both treated with endonucleases to cleave these restriction sites and create sticky ends.  Next the products from this cleavage are ligated together, resulting in the insertion  of the gene into the target plasmid. An alternative form of cassette mutagenesis called combinatorial cassette mutagenesis is used to identify the functions of individual amino acid residues in the protein of interest. Recursive ensemble mutagenesis then utilizes information from previous combinatorial cassette mutagenesis. Codon cassette mutagenesis allows you to insert or replace a single codon at a particular site in double stranded DNA.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

=== Sexual Methods ===
Sexual methods of directed evolution involve ''in vitro'' recombination which mimic natural ''in vivo'' recombination. Generally these techniques require high sequence homology between parental sequences. These techniques are often used to recombine two different parental genes, and these methods do create cross overs between these genes.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

==== ''In vitro'' Homologous Recombination ====
Homologous recombination can be categorized as either ''in vivo'' or ''in vitro. In vitro'' homologous recombination mimics natural ''in vivo'' recombination. These ''in vitro'' recombination methods require high sequence homology between parental sequences. These techniques exploit the natural diversity in parental genes by recombining them to yield chimeric genes. The resulting chimera show a blend of parental characteristics.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====DNA shuffling====

This ''in vitro'' technique was one of the first techniques in the era of recombination. It begins with the digestion of homologous parental genes into small fragments by DNase1. These small fragments are then purified from undigested parental genes. Purified fragments are then reassembled using primer-less PCR. This PCR involves homologous fragments from different parental genes priming for each other, resulting in chimeric DNA. The chimeric DNA of parental size is then amplified using end terminal primers in regular PCR.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Random priming ''In vitro'' recombination (RPR)====

This ''in vitro'' homologous recombination method begins with the synthesis of many short gene fragments exhibiting point mutations using random sequence primers. These fragments are reassembled to full length parental genes using primer-less PCR. These reassembled sequences are then amplified using PCR and subjected to further selection processes. This method is advantageous relative to DNA shuffling because there is no use of DNase1, thus there is no bias for recombination next to a pyrimidine nucleotide. This method is also advantageous due to its use of synthetic random primers which are uniform in length, and lack biases. Finally this method is independent of the length of DNA template sequence, and requires a small amount of parental DNA.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Truncated Metagenomic Gene-Specific PCR====

This method generates chimeric genes directly from metagenomic samples. It begins with isolation of the desired gene by functional screening from metagenomic DNA sample. Next, specific primers are designed and used to amplify the homologous genes from different environmental samples. Finally, chimeric libraries are generated to retrieve the desired functional clones by shuffling these amplified homologous genes.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Staggered Extension Process (StEP)====

This ''in vitro'' method is based on template switching to generate chimeric genes. This PCR based method begins with an initial denaturation of the template, followed by annealing of primers and a short extension time. All subsequent cycle generate annealing between the short fragments generated in previous cycles and different parts of the template. These short fragments and the templates anneal together based on sequence complementarity. This process of fragments annealing template DNA is known as template switching. These annealed fragments will then serve as primers for further extension. This method is carried out until the parental length chimeric gene sequence is obtained. Execution of this method only requires flanking primers to begin. There is also no need for Dnase1 enzyme.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Random Chimeragenesis on Transient Templates (RACHITT)====

This method has been shown to generate chimeric gene libraries with an average of 14 crossovers per chimeric gene. It begins by aligning fragments from a parental top strand onto the bottom strand of a uracil containing template from a homologous gene. 5' and 3' overhang flaps are cleaved and gaps are filled by the exonuclease and endonuclease activities of Pfu and taq DNA polymerases. The uracil containing template is then removed from the heteroduplex by treatment with a uracil DNA glcosylase, followed by further amplification using PCR. This method is advantageous because it generates chimeras with relatively high crossover frequency. However it is somewhat limited due to the complexity and the need for generation of single stranded DNA and uracil containing single stranded template DNA.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Synthetic shuffling====

Shuffling of synthetic degenerate oligonucleotides adds flexibility to shuffling methods, since oligonucleotides containing optimal codons and beneficial mutations can be included.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

==== ''In vivo'' Homologous Recombination ====
'''&lt;small&gt;Cloning Performed in Yeast&lt;/small&gt;'''

This method involves PCR dependent reassembly of fragmented expression vectors. These reassembled vectors are then introduced to, and cloned in yeast. Using yeast to clone the vector avoids toxicity and counter-selection that would be introduced by ligation and propagation in E. coli.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Mutagenic Organized Recombination Process by Homologous ''In Vivo'' Grouping (MORPHING)====

This method introduces mutations into specific regions of genes while leaving other parts intact by utilizing the high frequency of homologous recombination in yeast.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Phage Assisted Continuous Evolution (PACE)====

This method utilizes a bacteriophage with a modified life cycle to transfer evolving genes from host to host. The phage's life cycle is designed in such a way that the transfer is correlated with the activity of interest from the enzyme. This method is advantageous because it requires minimal human intervention for the continuous evolution of the gene.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

=== ''In Vitro'' Non-Homologous Recombination Methods ===
These methods are based upon the fact that proteins can exhibit similar structural identity while lacking sequence homology.

===Exon Shuffling===

Exon shuffling is the combination of exons from different proteins by recombination events occurring at introns. Orthologous exon shuffling involves combining exons from orthologous genes from different species. Orthologous domain shuffling involves shuffling of entire protein domains from orthologous genes from different species. Paralogous exon shuffling involves shuffling of exon from different genes from the same species. Paralogous domain shuffling involves shuffling of entire protein domains from paralogous proteins from the same species. Functional homolog shuffling involves shuffling of non-homologous domains which are functional related. All of these processes being with amplification of the desired exons from different genes using chimeric synthetic oligonucleotides. This amplification products are then reassembled into full length genes using primer-less PCR. During these PCR cycles the fragments act as templates and primers. This results in chimeric full length genes, which are then subjected to screening.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Incremental Truncation for the Creation of Hybrid Enzymes (ITHCY)====

Fragments of parental genes are created using controlled digestion by exonuclease III. These fragments are blunted using endonuclease, and are ligated to produce hybrid genes. THIOITHCY is a modified ITHCY technique which utilized nucleotide triphosphate analogs such as α-phosphothioate dNTPs. Incorporation of these nucleotides blocks digestion by  exonuclease III. This inhibition of digestion by exonuclease III is called spiking. Spiking can be accomplished by first truncating genes with exonuclease to create fragments with short single stranded overhangs. These fragments then serve as templates for amplification by DNA polymerase in the presence of small amounts of phosphothioate dNTPs. These resulting fragments are then ligated together to form full length genes. Alternatively the intact parental genes can be amplified by PCR in the presence of normal dNTPs and phosphothioate dNTPs. These full length amplification products are then subjected to digestion by an exonuclease. Digestion will continue until the exonuclease encounters an α-pdNTP, resulting in fragments of different length. These fragments are then ligated together to generate chimeric genes.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====SCRATCHY====

This method generates libraries of hybrid genes inhibiting multiple crossovers by combining DNA shuffling and ITHCY. This method begins with the construction of two independent ITCHY libraries. The first with gene A on the N-terminus. And the other having gene B on the N-terminus. These hybrid gene fragments are separated using either restriction enzyme digestion or PCR with terminus primers via agarose gel electrophoresis. These isolated fragments are then mixed together and further digested using DNase1. Digested fragments are then reassembled by primerless PCR with template switching.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Recombined Extension on Truncated Templates (RETT)====

This method generates libraries of hybrid genes by template switching of uni-directionally growing polynucleotides in the presence of single stranded DNA fragments as templates for chimeras. This method begins with the preparation of single stranded DNA fragments by reverse transcription from target mRNA. Gene specific primers are then annealed to the single stranded DNA. These genes are then extended during a PCR cycle. This cycle is followed by template switching and annealing of the short fragments obtained from the earlier primer extension to other single stranded DNA fragments. This process is repeated until full length single stranded DNA is obtained.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Sequence Homology-Independent Protein Recombination (SHIPREC)====

This method generates recombination between genes with little to no sequence homology. These chimeras are fused via a linker sequence containing several restriction sites. This construct is then digested using DNase1. Fragments are made are made blunt ended using S1 nuclease. These blunt end fragments are put together into a circular sequence by ligation. This circular construct is then linearized using restriction enzymes for which the restriction sites are present in the linker region. This results in a library of chimeric genes in which contribution of genes to 5' and 3' end will be reversed as compared to the starting construct.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Sequence Independent Site Directed Chimeragenesis (SISDC)====

This method results in a library of genes with multiple crossovers from several parental genes. This method does not require sequence identity among the parental genes. This does require one or two conserved amino acids at every crossover position. It begins with alignment of parental sequences and identification of consensus regions which serve as crossover sites. This is followed by the incorporation of specific tags containing restriction sites followed by the removal of the tags by digestion with Bac1, resulting in genes with cohesive ends. These gene fragments are mixed and ligated in an appropriate order to form chimeric libraries.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Degenerate Homo-Duplex Recombination (DHR)====

This method begins with alignment of homologous genes, followed by identification of regions of polymorphism. Next the top strand of the gene is divided into small degenerate oligonucleotides. The bottom strand is also digested into oligonucleotides to serve as scaffolds. These fragments are combined in solution are top strand oligonucleotides are assembled onto bottom strand oligonucleotides. Gaps between these fragments are filled with polymerase and ligated.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Random Multi-Recombinant PCR (RM-PCR)====

This method involves the shuffling of plural DNA fragments without homology, in a single PCR. This results in the reconstruction of complete proteins by assembly of modules encoding different structural units.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====User Friendly DNA Recombination (USERec)====

This method begins with the amplification of gene fragments which need to be recombined, using uracil dNTPs. This amplification solution also contains primers, PfuTurbo, and Cx Hotstart DNA polymerase. Amplified products are next incubated with USER enzyme. This enzyme catalyzes the removal of uracil residues from DNA creating single base pair gaps. The USER enzyme treated fragments are mixed and ligated using T4 DNA ligase and subjected to Dpn1 digestion to remove the template DNA. These resulting dingle stranded fragments are subjected to amplification using PCR, and are transformed into E. coli.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Golden Gate Shuffling (GGS) Recombination====

This method allows you to recombine at least 9 different fragments in an acceptor vector by using type 2 restriction enzyme which cuts outside of the restriction sites. It begins with sub cloning of fragments in separate vectors to create Bsa1 flanking sequences on both sides. These vectors are then cleaved using type II restriction enzyme Bsa1, which generates four nucleotide single strand overhangs. Fragments with complementary overhangs are hybridized and ligated using T4 DNA ligase. Finally these constructs are then transformed into E. coli cells, which are screened  for expression levels.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Phosphoro Thioate-Based DNA Recombination Method (PRTec)====

This method can be used to recombine structural elements or entire protein domains. This method is based on phosphorothioate chemistry which allows the specific cleavage of phosphorothiodiester bonds. The first step in the process begins with amplification of fragments that need to be recombined along with the vector backbone. This amplification is accomplished using primers with phosphorothiolated nucleotides at 5' ends. Amplified PCR products are cleaved in an ethanol-iodine solution at high temperatures. Next these fragments are hybridized at room temperature and transformed into E. coli which repair any nicks.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Integron====

This system is based upon a natural site specific recombination system in E. coli. This system is called the integron system, and produces natural gene shuffling. This method was used to construct and optimize a functional tryptophan biosynthetic operon in trp-deficient E. coli by delivering individual recombination cassettes or trpA-E genes along with regulatory elements with the integron system.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Y-Ligation Based Shuffling (YLBS)====

This method generates single stranded DNA strands, which encompass a single block sequence either at the 5' or 3' end, complementary sequences in a stem loop region, and a D branch  region serving as a primer binding site for PCR. Equivalent amounts of both 5' and 3' half strands are mixed and formed a hybrid due to the complementarity in the stem region. Hybrids with free phosphorylated 5' end in 3' half strands are then ligated with free 3' ends in 5' half strands using T4 DNA ligase in the presence of 0.1 mM ATP. Ligated products are then amplified by two types of PCR to generate pre 5' half  and pre 3' half PCR products. These PCR product are converted to single strands via avidin-biotin binding to the 5' end of the primes containing stem sequences that were biotin labeled. Next, biotinylated  5' half strands and non-biotinylated 3' half strands are used as 5' and 3' half strands for the next Y-ligation cycle.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

== Semi-Rational Design ==
Semi-rational design uses information about a proteins sequence, structure and function, in tandem with predictive algorithms. Together these are used to identify target amino acid residues which are most likely to influence protein function. Mutations of these key amino acid residues create libraries of mutant proteins that are more likely to have enhanced properties.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lutz|first=Stefan|date=2017-04-20|title=Beyond directed evolution - semi-rational protein engineering and design|journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology|volume=21|issue=6|pages=734–743|doi=10.1016/j.copbio.2010.08.011|issn=0958-1669|pmc=2982887|pmid=20869867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in semi-rational enzyme engineering and de novo enzyme design provide researchers with powerful and effective new strategies to manipulate biocatalysts. Integration of sequence and structure based approaches in library design has proven to be a great guide for enzyme redesign. Generally, current computational de novo and redesign methods do not compare to evolved variants in catalytic performance. Although experimental optimization may be produced using directed evolution, further improvements in the accuracy of structure predictions and greater catalytic ability will be achieved with improvements in design algorithms. Further functional enhancements may be included in future simulations by integrating protein dynamics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Biochemical and biophysical studies, along with fine-tuning of predictive frameworks will be useful to experimentally evaluate the functional significance of individual design features. Better understanding of these functional contributions will then give feedback for the improvement of future designs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Directed evolution will likely not be replaced as the method of choice for protein engineering, although computational protein design has fundamentally changed the way protein engineering can manipulate bio-macromolecules. Smaller, more focused and functionally-rich libraries may be generated by using in methods which incorporate predictive frameworks for hypothesis-driven protein engineering. New design strategies and technical advances have begun a departure from traditional protocols, such as directed evolution, which represents the most effective strategy for identifying top-performing candidates in focused libraries. Whole-gene library synthesis is replacing shuffling and mutagenesis protocols for library preparation. Also highly specific low throughput screening assays are increasingly applied in place of monumental screening and selection efforts of millions of candidates. Together, these developments are poised to take protein engineering beyond directed evolution and towards practical, more efficient strategies for tailoring biocatalysts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Screening and Selection Techniques ==
Once a protein has undergone directed evolution, ration design or semi-ration design, the libraries of mutant proteins must be screened to determine which mutants show enhanced properties. Phage display methods are one option for screening proteins. This method involves the fusion of genes encoding the variant polypeptides with phage coat protein genes. Protein variants expressed on phage surfaces are selected by binding with immobilized targets in vitro. Phages with selected protein variants are then amplified in bacteria, followed by the identification of positive clones by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. These selected phages are then subjected to DNA sequencing.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

Cell surface display systems can also be utilized to screen mutant polypeptide libraries. The library mutant genes are incorporated into expression vectors which are then transformed into appropriate host cells. These host cells are subjected to further high throughput screening methods to identify the cells with desired phenotypes.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

Cell free display systems have been developed to exploit ''in vitro'' protein translation or cell free translation. These methods include mRNA display, ribosome display, covalent and non covalent DNA display, and ''in vitro'' compartmentalization.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{rp|53}}

===Enzyme engineering===
Enzyme engineering is the application of modifying an enzyme's structure (and, thus, its function) or modifying the catalytic activity of isolated [[enzyme]]s to produce new metabolites, to allow new (catalyzed) pathways for reactions to occur,&lt;ref&gt;['Designer Enzymes' at http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/101236.php] Accessed 22 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; or to convert from some certain compounds into others ([[biotransformation]]). These products are useful as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, fuel, food, or agricultural additives.

An ''enzyme reactor'' &lt;ref&gt;[Enzyme reactors at {{cite web |url=http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/biology/enztech/reactors.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502110325/http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/biology/enztech/reactors.html |archivedate=2012-05-02 |df= }}] Accessed 22 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; consists of a vessel containing a reactional medium that is used to perform a desired conversion by enzymatic means.

Computing methods have been used to design a protein with a novel fold, named [[Top7]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kuhlman|first=Brian|title=Design of a Novel Globular Protein Fold with Atomic-Level Accuracy|year=2003|last2=Dantas|last3=Ireton|last4=Varani|last5=Stoddard|last6=Baker|first2=Gautam|first3=Gregory C.|first4=Gabriele|first5=Barry L.|first6=David|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=302|issue=5649|pages=1364–1368|bibcode=2003Sci...302.1364K|doi=10.1126/science.1089427|pmid=14631033|lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sensors for unnatural molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Looger|first=Loren L.|title=Computational design of receptor and sensor proteins with novel functions|year=2003|last2=Dwyer|last3=Smith|last4=Hellinga|first2=Mary A.|first3=James J.|first4=Homme W.|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=423|issue=6936|pages=185–190|bibcode=2003Natur.423..185L|doi=10.1038/nature01556|pmid=12736688|lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engineering of [[fusion protein]]s has yielded [[rilonacept]], a pharmaceutical that has secured [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval for treating [[cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome]].

Another computing method, IPRO, successfully engineered the switching of cofactor specificity of Candida boidinii xylose reductase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Computational design of Candida boidinii xylose reductase for altered cofactor specificity|date=October 2009|last1=Khoury|last2=Fazelinia|last3=Chin|last4=Pantazes|last5=Cirino|last6=Maranas|first1=GA|first2=H|first3=JW|first4=RJ|first5=PC|first6=CD|journal=Protein Science|volume=18|issue=10|pages=2125–38|doi=10.1002/pro.227|pmc=2786976|pmid=19693930}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Iterative Protein Redesign and Optimization (IPRO) redesigns proteins to increase or give specificity to native or novel [[Enzyme substrate (biology)|substrates]] and [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]]. This is done by repeatedly randomly perturbing the structure of the proteins around specified design positions, identifying the lowest energy combination of [[Conformational isomerism|rotamers]], and determining whether the new design has a lower binding energy than prior ones.&lt;ref&gt;The iterative nature of this process allows IPRO to make additive mutations to a protein sequence that collectively improve the specificity toward desired substrates and/or cofactors. Details on how to download the software, implemented in [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and experimental testing of predictions are outlined in this paper: {{Citation|title=Computational design of Candida boidinii xylose reductase for altered cofactor specificity|date=October 2009|last1=Khoury|last2=Fazelinia|last3=Chin|last4=Pantazes|last5=Cirino|last6=Maranas|first1=GA|first2=H|first3=JW|first4=RJ|first5=PC|first6=CD|journal=Protein Science|volume=18|issue=10|pages=2125–38|doi=10.1002/pro.227|pmc=2786976|pmid=19693930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computation-aided design has also been used to engineer complex properties of a highly ordered nano-protein assembly.&lt;ref name="Ardejani"&gt;{{Citation|title=Stabilization of a Protein Nanocage through the Plugging of a Protein–Protein Interfacial Water Pocket|date=April 2011|last1=Ardejani|last2=Li|last3=Orner|first1=MS|first2=NX|first3=BP|journal=Biochemistry|volume=50|issue=19|pages=4029–4037|doi=10.1021/bi200207w|pmid=21488690}}&lt;/ref&gt; A protein cage, E. coli bacterioferritin (EcBfr), which naturally shows structural instability and an incomplete self-assembly behavior by populating two oligomerization states, is the model protein in this study. Through computational analysis and comparison to its [[Protein homology|homologs]], it has been found that this protein has a smaller-than-average [[Protein dimer|dimeric interface]] on its two-fold symmetry axis due mainly to the existence of an interfacial water pocket centered on two water-bridged asparagine residues. To investigate the possibility of engineering EcBfr for modified structural stability, a semi-empirical computational method is used to virtually explore the energy differences of the 480 possible mutants at the dimeric interface relative to the [[wild type]] EcBfr.  This computational study also converges on the water-bridged [[asparagine]]s. Replacing these two asparagines with [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] amino acids results in proteins that fold into [[Alpha helix|alpha-helical]] monomers and assemble into cages as evidenced by circular dichroism and transmission electron microscopy. Both thermal and chemical denaturation confirm that, all redesigned proteins, in agreement with the calculations, possess increased stability.  One of the three mutations shifts the population in favor of the higher order oligomerization state in solution as shown by both size exclusion chromatography and native gel electrophoresis.&lt;ref name="Ardejani" /&gt;

The '''Protestant Hospital of Ngaoundéré ''' is a [[Protestant]] hospital in [[N'Gaoundere]], [[Cameroon]]. Founded by Norwegian missionaries of the [[Norwegian Missionary Society]], and partly funded by a wealthy American donator in Cameroon and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Cameroon]], the hospital has been in full operation since 1957. The Protestant Hospital of Ngaoundéré today employs over 127 people.&lt;ref name="OsEELC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oseelc.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=58:ngaoundere&amp;catid=53:ngaoundere-protestant-hospital&amp;Itemid=58|title=Ngaoundéré|date=December 3, 2008|publisher=L'Eglise Evangélique Luthérienne au Cameroun (OSEELC)|accessdate=January 6, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1931 Norwegian missionaries Mr and Mrs Endressen arrived at Ngaoundéré from [[Madagascar]]. Mr. Endressen was pastor while his wife is a nurse.&lt;ref name="OsEELC"/&gt; They began medical work, visiting patients at home and treating them. Given the sheer number of patients who flocked to her, she had to ask the mission to build a room where she could hospitalize those who required a formal observation. A straw huts was erected, with one room serving as a hospital room for men and the second for women. Endressen also initiated a health education program in the neighborhoods. She taught in particular the prevention of certain diseases such as [[malaria]], [[tuberculosis]], intestinal worms and other [[sexually transmitted diseases]] (STDs).&lt;ref name="OsEELC"/&gt;

In 1935 however, she succumbed to illness herself and was forced to return to Norway, closing the clinic. Three years later, however, she returned in 1938 and resumed her activities. Desiring a hospital to undertake the great work, one evening she went to the present site of the hospital and prayed to God for a hospital being built. At that time, the site was not yet chosen. The [[Sudan Mission]] had already issued in 1945 the idea of collaborating with the NMS and the Fraternal Lutheran Mission (MFL) north of Cameroon for the establishment of a hospital because they lacked the funds for the construction of a hospital.&lt;ref name="OsEELC"/&gt; This hospital should be beneficial not only for the indigenous population but also for the care for the missionaries in the area. By this time, however, the government had begun construction of a hospital in Meiganga and would not consider building another hospital and the initial proposals were rejected due to strong opposition.&lt;ref name="OsEELC"/&gt; In 1947, however, the NMS decided to send a doctor to aid the work of Endressen. Dr. Bernt Sigurd Bjaanes, a Norwegian who had arrived with his wife in Cameroon in December 1947.&lt;ref name="OsEELC"/&gt;
[[File:N'Gaoundere hospital5.jpg|thumb|left|300px|European physicians are still active in the hospital today]]

In 1948 a new plan was presented by the Pastor Endressen Pastor and in June of that year John Fosse, a nurse and deacon arrived and three Cameroonian medical students were added to this team. One died and was replaced by another Cameroonian, Moussa Martin, and the three students would become part of the first class of nursing students in 1954. In 1949 the idea of the creation of the Ngaoundéré Protestant Hospital was already well advanced and the site that should accommodate the hospital was found. That same year, the Directorate of NMS sent a Norwegian architect [[Ove Aasen]], to start construction work on the clinic of Dr. Bjaanes and the hospital.&lt;ref name="OsEELC"/&gt; When Dr. Syrdal became Superintendent of the NMS he made a great effort to reach an agreement with the Sudan Mission to build a hospital in Ngaoundéré in the early 1950s. This reached a climax at a meeting on 2 February 1953 to clarify things.&lt;ref name="OsEELC"/&gt;

Following this development, it was now under consideration to finance the construction of the hospital. As stated above, the SM had already received enough money to build a hospital but this was not enough money to build a common hospital. In addition, the economic situation of the NMS became increasingly critical, which did not allow him to continue funding the construction of the hospital despite the fact that construction work had already started.&lt;ref name="OsEELC"/&gt; On the proposal of Pastor Keller, secretary of the Mission, a request for assistance was sent to a French organization [[FIDES]]. A sum of 100 million [[francs]] had been requested, but only 2,882,000 francs have been achieved. FIDES were interested in particular in surgery and dentistry facilities but were not willing to finance the whole unit.&lt;ref name="OsEELC"/&gt; By circumstance, a rich American named Young was in Cameroon and promised to contribute a sum of $ 25,000 enabling the construction of the hospital which would not only enabled full services to be provided but would finance the building of a school for nurses, and homes of the doctors and some nurses.&lt;ref name="OsEELC"/&gt; In a letter dated 20 April 1954, Young also promised to pay the operating costs of the hospital for a minimum period of 5 years and a maximum period of 10 years.&lt;ref name="OsEELC"/&gt; The generous donation was regarded by the missionaries as a gift from God enabling the creation of an advanced hospital in Ngaoundéré.

==Construction==
[[File:N'Gaoundere hospital1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Waiting patients at the busy accident and emergency unit.]]
A construction committee was appointed to conduct the work until its completion. This committee was composed by Oscar Noss (SM) and Ada Kopstad (NMS). The use of the donation of 25,000 dollars was directly used for the construction of 2 buildings of 5 rooms for patients (50,000 francs), hospital equipment with a value of 305 000 francs, a building for a dental clinic (500 000 francs), dental equipment (500,000 francs), dental surgery (720 000 francs), a pavilion for whites, which would include 4 hospital rooms, two dining rooms, two kitchens, four showers and toilets and an exam room and deliveries (1,350 000 francs), and a chapel and a classroom for medical students (500 000 francs).&lt;ref name="OsEELC"/&gt; The land on which the hospital was built Ngaoundéré was awarded to the [[Norwegian Mission]] by Order No. 353 of 24 June 1949. Ove Aasen was the principal architect of the hospital. On the request, the High Commissioner of the Republic of Cameroon residing in [[Yaoundé]] on 4 September 1952, according to plan which was presented by Mr. Endressen, authorised the outbuildings, a clinic, four hospital units, a sterilization facility, and the installation of water and sanitation.&lt;ref name="OsEELC"/&gt;

In 1956 the Young Foundation gave a total of 48,800 dollars that helped build a pavilion surgery, a dental clinic, the dentist's residence, and even the house of Aasen the architect. It also built an annex for the hospital, two houses for nurses, a kitchen for the surgical pavilion, a room for the generator, ten hospital rooms and an office amounting to 41,600 dollars.&lt;ref name="OsEELC"/&gt; It was completed in 1957 and plays an important role in healthcare in the city and surrounding area today.

'''Refeeding syndrome''' is a [[syndrome]] consisting of metabolic disturbances that occur as a result of reinstitution of nutrition to patients who are [[starvation|starved]], severely [[malnourishment|malnourished]] or metabolically stressed due to severe illness. When too much food and/or liquid nutrition supplement is consumed during the initial four to seven days of refeeding, this triggers synthesis of [[glycogen]], fat and protein in cells, to the detriment of [[serum (blood)|serum (blood)]] concentrations of potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus.&lt;ref name=pmid18583681&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mehanna HM, Moledina J, Travis J |title=Refeeding syndrome: what it is, and how to prevent and treat it |journal=BMJ |volume=336 |issue=7659 |pages=1495–8 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18583681 |pmc=2440847 |doi=10.1136/bmj.a301 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18583681}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doig|first=GS|last2=Simpson|first2=F|last3=Heighes|first3=|last4=Bellomo|first4=R|last5=Chesher|first5=D|last6=Caterson|first6=ID|last7=Reade|first7=MC|last8=Harrigan|first8=PWJ|date=2015-12-01|title=Restricted versus continued standard caloric intake during the management of refeeding syndrome in critically ill adults: a randomised, parallel-group, multicentre, single-blind controlled trial|journal=The Lancet Respiratory Medicine|volume=3|issue=12|pages=943–952|doi=10.1016/S2213-2600(15)00418-X|issn=2213-2619|pmid=26597128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiac, pulmonary and neurological symptoms can be signs of refeeding syndrome. The low serum minerals, if severe enough, can be fatal.

==Cause==
Any individual who has had negligible nutrient intake for many consecutive days and/or is metabolically stressed from a critical illness or major surgery is at risk of refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome usually occurs within four days of starting to re-feed. Patients can develop fluid and [[electrolyte]] disorders, especially [[hypophosphatemia]], along with neurologic, pulmonary, cardiac, neuromuscular, and hematologic complications.

During [[fasting]] the body switches its main fuel source from carbohydrates to fat tissue [[fatty acids]] and [[amino acids]] as the main energy sources. The spleen decreases its rate of red blood cell breakdown thus conserving [[red blood cell]]s. Many intracellular minerals become severely depleted during this period, although serum levels remain normal. Importantly, [[insulin]] secretion is suppressed in this fasted state and [[glucagon]] secretion is increased.&lt;ref name=pmid18583681/&gt;

During refeeding, insulin secretion resumes in response to increased [[blood sugar]], resulting in increased glycogen, fat and protein synthesis. This process requires [[phosphate]]s, [[magnesium]] and [[potassium]] which are already depleted and the stores rapidly become used up. Formation of phosphorylated carbohydrate compounds in the liver and skeletal muscle depletes intracellular [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[2,3-diphosphoglycerate]] in [[red blood cells]], leading to cellular dysfunction and inadequate oxygen delivery to the body's organs. Refeeding increases the [[basal metabolic rate]]. Intracellular movement of electrolytes occurs along with a fall in the [[blood serum|serum]] electrolytes, including [[phosphorus]] and [[magnesium]]. Levels of serum glucose may rise and the B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; vitamin [[thiamine]] may fall. [[Arrhythmia|Abnormal heart rhythms]] are the most common cause of death from refeeding syndrome, with other significant risks including confusion, [[coma]] and convulsions and [[cardiac failure]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

This syndrome can occur at the beginning of treatment for [[anorexia nervosa]] when patients have an increase in calorie intake and can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Webb GJ, Smith K, Thursby-Pelham F, Smith T, Stroud MA, Da Silva AN |title=Complications of emergency refeeding in anorexia nervosa: case series and review |journal=Acute Medicine |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=69–76 |year=2011 |pmid=22041604 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also occur after the onset of a severe illness or major surgery. The shifting of electrolytes and fluid balance increases cardiac workload and heart rate. This can lead to acute heart failure. Oxygen consumption is also increased which strains the respiratory system and can make weaning from ventilation more difficult.

==Diagnosis==
Refeeding syndrome can be fatal if not recognized and treated properly. An awareness of the condition and a high index of suspicion are required in order to make the diagnosis. The electrolyte disturbances of the refeeding syndrome can occur within the first few days of refeeding.  Close monitoring of blood biochemistry is therefore necessary in the early refeeding period. 

==Treatment==
In critically ill patients admitted to an [[intensive care unit]], if [[phosphate]] drops to below 0.65&amp;nbsp;mmol/L (2.0&amp;nbsp;mg/dL) from a previously normal level within three days of starting enteral or parenteral nutrition, caloric intake should be reduced to 480 kcals per day for at least two days whilst electrolytes are replaced. Prescribing [[thiamine]], [[vitamin B]] complex (strong) and a [[multivitamin|multivitamin and mineral preparation]] is recommended. Biochemistry should be monitored regularly until it is stable. Although clinical trials are lacking in patients other than those admitted to an intensive care, it is commonly recommended that [[Energy balance (biology)|energy intake]] should remain lower than that normally required for the first 3–5 days of treatment of refeeding syndrome.

==History==
A common error, repeated in multiple papers, is that "The syndrome was first 
described after [[World War II]] in Americans who, held by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] as [[prisoners of war#World War II|prisoners of war]], had become malnourished during captivity and who were then released to the care of United States personnel in the [[Philippines]]."&lt;ref name="pmid14847450"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1951|title=A clinical study of malnutrition in Japanese prisoners of war|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=35|issue=1|pages=69–96|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-35-1-69|pmid=14847450|vauthors=Schnitker MA, Mattman PE, Bliss TL|url=https://www.annals.org/article.aspx?volume=35&amp;issue=1&amp;page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, closer inspection of the 1951 paper by Schnitker reveals the prisoners under study were not American POWs but Japanese soldiers who, already malnourished, surrendered in the Philippines during 1945, after the war was over. 

It is difficult to ascertain when the syndrome was first discovered and named, but it is likely the associated electrolyte disturbances were identified well before 1951, perhaps in Holland during the closing months of World War II, before Victory Day in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=BSandstead|first2=HR|last3=Drummond|first3=J|date=1945|title=Starvation in Western Holland: 1945.|journal=Lancet|volume=246|pages=282–83.|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(45)90738-0|last1=Burger|first1=GCE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also anecdotal eyewitness reports from a still earlier time of Polish prisoners in Iran who were freed from Soviet camps in 1941–1942 under an amnesty to form an army under General Anders and were given food whilst in a state of starvation which caused many to die.&lt;ref&gt;Many of these deaths were due to dysentry, typhoid and other diseases but this was largely amongst the civilian evacuees from Poland.  Clear eyewitness reports identify eating too much as a cause.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Historian Flavius [[Josephus]] writing in first century the described classic symptoms of the syndrome among survivors of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|siege of Jerusalem]]. He described the death of those who over indulged in food after famine, whereas those who ate a more restrained pace survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2850/2850-h/2850-h.htm#link52HCH0013|title=The Wars of the Jews by Flavius Josephus|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gutenberg.org|page=book V, chapter XIII, paragraph 4|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 5th century BCE work 'On Fleshes' (De Carnibus), [[Hippocrates]] writes, "if a person goes
seven days without eating or drinking anything, in this period most die; but there are some who survive that time
but still die, and others are persuaded not to starve themselves to death but to eat and drink: however, the cavity
no longer admits anything because the jejunum (nêstis) has grown together in that many days, and these people
too die." Though [[Hippocrates]] misidentifies the exact cause of death, this passage likely represents an early description of Refeeding Syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;Hippocrates of Kos. De Carnibus. 5th century BCE.&lt;/ref&gt;

This enables Plan Sponsors to continue providing drug coverage to their [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]-eligible [[retirees]] at a lower cost.

Benefits of the RDS Program for participating Plan Sponsors include:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://rds.cms.hhs.gov/user_guide/userguide/ug_003.htm#t029 RDS User Guide]'', Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Version 17, May 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* A Federal [[subsidy]] equal to 28-percent Qualifying Covered Retiree's costs for prescription drugs otherwise covered by [[Medicare Part D]] that are attributable to such drug costs [[Medicare Part D coverage gap|between the applicable Cost Threshold and Cost Limit]]
* Incurred costs (including dispensing fees) that the Health Plan Sponsor pays, and that the retiree pays, are eligible for subsidy. Rebates received are subtracted from the amount eligible for subsidy.
* Program flexibility that supports the Health Plan Sponsor's current prescription drug plan structure
* Extensive educational materials and support

To qualify for the subsidy, a Health Plan Sponsor must show that its coverage is "actuarially equivalent" to, or at least as generous as, the defined standard Medicare Part D coverage.

'''Richard A. Isay''' (December 13, 1934 – June 28, 2012) was an [[United States|American]] psychiatrist, psychoanalyst, author and gay activist. He was a professor of psychiatry at [[Weill Cornell Medical College]] and a faculty member of the [[Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research]]. Isay is considered a pioneer who changed the way that psychoanalysts view homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/health/richard-isay-fought-illness-tag-for-gays-dies-at-77.html?_r=1|title=Dr. Richard Isay, Who Fought Illness Tag for Gays, Dies at 77|author=Chris Geidner |date=June 29, 2012 |work= |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Richard Isay was born and raised in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. Isay graduated from [[Haverford College]] and the [[University of Rochester]] School of Medicine and Dentistry. Soon after completing his psychiatry residency at [[Yale University]], he completed his training at the Western New England Psychoanalytic Institute. Throughout his career, Isay maintained a private practice of psychiatry and psychoanalysis and was an influential teacher and supervisor. He was the program chairman of the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]] (APsaA), the American Program Chairman of the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]] and chairman of the Committee on Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Issues of the [[American Psychiatric Association]].

In 1983, as chair of the APsaA's program committee, Isay organized a panel called "New Perspectives on Homosexuality". Isay argued that homosexuality is a normal variant of sexual identity, and that psychoanalysts should stop trying to change the sexual orientation of their patients, which he considered injurious, creating a firestorm of controversy. "Several analysts walked out", Isay later recalled. Isay soon became the first openly gay member of the association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rochester.edu/pr/Review/V71N4/gazette2.html |title=Gays in the Institutes |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=University of Rochester |publisher=Alumni Gazette |accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Isay wrote widely on the subjects of psychoanalysis and homosexuality, including texts such as ''Being Homosexual: Gay Men and Their Development''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Being Homosexual: Gay Men and Their Development |last=Isay |first=Richard |year=1989 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |isbn=0-374-11012-3 |pages=159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Being Homosexual'' was one of the first books to argue that homosexuality is an inborn identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rochester.edu/pr/Review/V71N4/gazette2.html |title=Gays in the Institutes |author=Karen McCally|year=2002 |work=Alumni Gazette |publisher=University of Rochester |accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first to describe a non-pathological developmental pathway that is specific to gay men. It is widely considered a breakthrough in psychoanalytic theory and an important, historical work.

In an autobiographical chapter of his book, ''Becoming Gay: The Journey to Self-Acceptance'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Becoming Gay: The Journey to Self-Acceptance |last=Isay |first=Richard |year=1996 |publisher=Pantheon |isbn=0-307-38977-4 |pages=208 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isay tells the story of how he spent ten years trying to change his homosexual orientation. During his analysis, he married. After completing his analysis, he realized that he was, in fact, gay. He was closeted in his professional life for several years, during which time he became a prominent member of the American Psychoanalytic Association. He began to write about homosexuality shortly after meeting his [[life partner]] and future husband, Gordon Harrell, in 1979.

In ''Becoming Gay'', Isay recounts that with the help of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], he threatened to sue the APsaA, due to their discriminatory policies. As a result, on May 9, 1991, the APsaA adopted a non-discrimination policy for the training of analytic candidates and changed its position statement on homosexuality. 1991 was also the year that the APsaA agreed to allow gays and lesbians to become [[Training analysis|training analysts]], and to promote gay and lesbian teachers and supervisors.

This fundamental change in position by the APsaA created a ripple effect that was felt throughout the profession. The ApsaA was and is the preeminent psychoanalytic organization in the world. These changes of position and practice by the APsaA became a stimulus for reform. They were slowly copied by psychoanalytic, psychiatric, psychological and social work organizations internationally. A few years later, these changes were adopted by psychoanalytic groups in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/late-richard-isay-who-cured-psychiatry-gay-cures010712 |title=The late Richard Isay: Who cured psychiatry of gay 'cures' |last1=Littauer |first1=Dan |last2= |first2= |date=July 1, 2012 |website=Gay Star News |publisher=Gay Star News |accessdate=December 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isay was an early proponent of gay marriage. In 1989 Isay told ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'': "If the time comes in which there's a change to society's attitude toward homosexuality - when, for example, gay marriages and adoptions are possible and gay couples reap the same social benefits as heterosexual couples - I believe there will be a corresponding change in the behavior of gay men, with much less emphasis on the sexual act and more emphasis on relationships".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goode |first=Erica |date=Nov 6, 1989 |title=Growing Up Gay in America |url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/late-richard-isay-who-cured-psychiatry-gay-cures010712 |journal=U.S. News &amp; World Report |location= |publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was long before gay marriage had become an issue within the mainstream, LGBT community.

Subsequently, the APsaA became the first national mental health organization to support [[gay marriage]], in 1997;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.towleroad.com/2012/06/dr-richard-isay-died-of-cancer-on-thursday-according-to-the-new-york-times-he-was-74-during-his-life-he-affected-a-drama.html |title=Richard Isay, Psychologist, psychiatrist and gay pioneer, dies at 77 |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=June 30, 2012 |website=TowleRoad |publisher= |accessdate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a policy that was spearheaded by Isay.

In his 2006 book, ''Commitment and Healing: Gay Men and the Need for Romantic Love'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Commitment and Healing: Gay Men and the Need for Romantic Love  |last=Isay |first=Richard |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=0-471-74049-7 |pages=160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Isay describes the difficulty many gay men have sustaining romantic, loving relationships.

Isay appeared on ''[[Larry King Live]]'', ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]'', ''[[Live with Regis and Kelly|The Morning Show]]'' and others.

In 1993 Isay was featured in the documentary "[[America Undercover]]: Why am I Gay? Stories of Coming Out in America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1136024/|title=America Undercover: Why Am I Gay? Stories of Coming Out in America |author=|publisher=IMDB |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 Isay was profiled in the book, ''Gay Soul: Finding the Heart of Gay Spirit and Nature'', by Mark Thompson.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=Gay Soul: Finding the Heart of Gay Spirit and Nature |last=Thompson |first=Mark |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1995 |publisher=HarperOne |location= |isbn=0-06-251041-X |page= |pages=272 |url=http://www.markthompsongayspirit.com/GaySoul.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 13, 2011, Isay married Gordon Harrell, his partner of 32 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/late-richard-isay-who-cured-psychiatry-gay-cures010712 |title=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/late-richard-isay-who-cured-psychiatry-gay-cures010712 |author=Dan Littauer |date=July 1012 |work= |publisher=Gay Star News |accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 12, 2011, Isay received the highly prestigious Hans W. Loewald award, from the International Forum on Psychoanalytic Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifpe.org/Award/Loewald_Award/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513165109/http://ifpe.org/Award/Loewald_Award/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 May 2008 |title=Hans W Loewald Award |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |work=Past Recipients of the Award |publisher=IFPE |accessdate=11 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isay died on June 28, 2012, of complications of adenocarcinoma. He was interred at [[Green-Wood Cemetery]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York city|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.green-wood.com/2012/dr-richard-isay-dead-at-77/ |title=Dr Richard Isay Dead at 77 |last1=Richman |first1=Jeff |date=July 3, 2012 |work= |publisher=Green-Wood Cemetery |accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 14, 2014, Isay was featured in the first gay themed tour of Green-Wood Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.green-wood.com/event/gay-green-wood-trolley-tour/ |title=Gay Green-Wood Trolley Tour |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Green-Wood |publisher=Green-Wood |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://walkaboutny.com/2014/06/18/the-gay-graves-tour/ |title=The Gay Graves Tour |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= June 18, 2014 |website=Walk About New York |publisher=Walk About New York |accessdate=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2014, the "Gay Grave Tour", as it's now called, has become part of Green-Wood Cemetery's annual summer program.

'''Robert H. W. Strang''' (April 4, 1881 – July 17, 1982) was an American [[orthodontist]]. He was the first specialist in orthodontics in the state of [[Connecticut]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Thompson| first1=W.M| title=Dr. Robert H. W. Strang| journal=The Angle Orthodontist| date=1983| url=http://www.angle.org/doi/pdf/10.1043/0003-3219(1983)053%3C0003%3ADRHWS%3E2.0.CO%3B2| accessdate=27 September 2015| doi=10.1043/0003-3219(1983)053&lt;0003:DRHWS&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and practiced in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] for many years.

==Life and career==
Strang graduated from [[Wilbraham Academy]], Massachusetts, in 1899. He then attended the [[Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery|University of Pennsylvania]] Dental and Medical Schools in 1902 and 1904 respectively, earning his degree in both fields. After completing his internship at the [[Western Pennsylvania Hospital]] in [[Pittsburgh]], he returned to his home state of Connecticut. He then enrolled himself in the [[Angle School of Orthodontia]] in [[St. Louis]] in 1906. After spending time with [[Edward Angle]] there, he returned to Connecticut to practice as its first orthodontic specialist. He also started teaching at the Alfred C. Fones School of Dental Hygiene. In 1947 he started the Fones School of Oral Hygiene at [[Bridgeport University]]. Along with teaching [[dental hygiene]], Strang remained active in his orthodontic career, giving lectures at different universities. He started giving orthodontic lectures at [[Temple University]] until 1960.

Dr. Strang authored over 100 articles and published four editions of the book ''Textbook of Orthodontia''. He served on the editorial board of [[The Angle Orthodontist]] for 50 years.

He died on July 17, 1982, after an illness at the age of 101 in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]].

'''SafetyLit''' (short for "Safety Literature") is a [[bibliographic database]] and online update of recently published scholarly research of relevance to those interested in the broad field of injury prevention and safety promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initiated in 1995, SafetyLit is a project of the SafetyLit Foundation in cooperation with the [[San Diego State University College of Health &amp; Human Services]] and the [[World Health Organization]] - Department of Violence and Injury Prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=WHO Department of Violence and Injury Prevention|title=VIP Home|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Like the [[United States National Library of Medicine|US National Library of Medicine's]] (NLM) [[PubMed]] system, SafetyLit is a free service that is distributed without commercial messages. There are many online literature databases. Most are subscription-based, costly and are available only through a library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | title = Normative behavior and information: The social aspects of information access
 | year = 2008
 | journal = Library and Information Science Research
 | pages = 56–66
 | volume = 30
 | issue = 1

 | last1 = Burnett	 | first1 =  Gary
 | last2 =  Jaeger	 | first2 =  Paul T.
 | last3 =  Thompson	 | first3 =  Kim M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, these databases focus on a specific scientific discipline. For example, PubMed has a bio-medicine focus, [[PsycINFO]] focuses upon behavioral issues, Compendex on engineering, etc.

While other bibliographic databases can focus upon the publications of only one or two professional disciplines, it has been known since the early 20th Century that issues relevant to safety research and policy development arise from many distinct disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| pages = 19–26

 | last3 =  Meier	 | first3 =  A.
 | last4 =  Laflamme	 | first4 =  L.	}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, SafetyLit draws its content from many disciplines. Articles are selected that are relevant to the issues of injury prevention and safety promotion from over 16000 scholarly journals (as of January 2016) in the physical, biological and social sciences, as well as engineering, medicine, and the applied social sciences. SafetyLit also indexes selected doctoral theses and relevant technical reports from government agencies and NGOs.&lt;ref name=ssources&gt;''{{cite web|title=About SafetyLit: Source Statistics|url=http://www.safetylit.org/statistics.htm|publisher=SafetyLit Foundation|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The idea for SafetyLit came from an electronic mailing list service provided in the early-1990s by the librarians at the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), [[National Center for Injury Prevention and Control]] (NCIPC). This bibliographic update was a print-out of article citations from Medline that were indexed with selected [[MeSH]] terms related to the treatment and prevention of injuries. This free service was provided at a time when searching Medline was quite costly. The NCIPC update service ended in 1994, about one year before the National Library of Medicine began providing an experimental version of PubMed.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|title=About_SafetyLit|url=http://www.safetylit.org/about.htm|accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Canese|first=K.|title=PubMed Celebrates its 10th Anniversary!|journal=NLM Technical Bulletin|year=2006|issue=352|pages=e5|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/so06/so06_pm_10.html|accessdate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To help fill the gap from that loss, SafetyLit began in early 1995 as a simple email message sent to about 20 people who were affiliated with the CDC-funded state Disability Prevention Programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Louisiana State Office of Public Health, Injury Research and Prevention Section, Disability Prevention Program |url=http://www.dhh.state.la.us/offices/page.asp?ID=221&amp;Detail=5527 |publisher=Louisiana Department of health and Hospitals |accessdate=29 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209030806/http://www.dhh.state.la.us/offices/page.asp?ID=221&amp;Detail=5527 |archivedate=December 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Louisiana and a few other U.S. states. As more and more people learned about SafetyLit, the mailing list expanded. By the end of 1998 the updates were circulated to more than 5000 addresses. By the close of 1999 the address list had expanded beyond 15,000.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;

During 1999, several publishing companies began supplying their journal article citation and abstract data to SafetyLit and the journal sources expanded far beyond what was available through PubMed. In 2001 the SafetyLit update service moved from a series of lengthy flat-file newsletters to a database-driven dynamic website. The email newsletter became a simple announcement that a pdf version of Update Bulletin is available on the SafetyLit website. With that improvement, an archive database with search capacity was established. From that time forward, each week brought the addition of about 300-400 recently published articles and more than 250 articles from the back-files of journals that published relevant material.&lt;ref name=ssources /&gt;
 
In mid-2013, to sustain the contents of the languishing VioLit database, SafetyLit formed a partnership with the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence (CSPV), a research program of the Institute of Behavioral Science (IBS) at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The VioLit database, had items related to preventing youth violence with most records including a thorough review written by CSPV experts. The VioLit expanded article reviews are being added to existing SafetyLit records where there is overlap of the database contents and VioLit items that had been missing from SafetyLit are being added.

In mid-2014 the static parts of the SafetyLit website became available in 17 languages (with localization) by expert translators. The content of article summaries is available in many languages through machine translation (Google).&lt;ref name="SLTranslate"&gt;{{cite web|title=SafetyLit Translated From English To 16 Languages|url=http://safetylit-blog.org/2014/08/24/safetylit-translated-from-english-to-16-languages/|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coverage==

===Sources===
Although SafetyLit began with a focus upon articles from scholarly journals, in early 2013 it expanded to include books (and book chapters) and the [[gray literature]] (academic doctoral theses, reports from scientific research groups, working papers, etc.).

====Scholarly Journals====
Information about the 16,000-plus serials indexed in SafetyLit is found in the SafetyLit Journals Database that lists journal title and current publisher, title abbreviation, both the print and electronic [[International Standard Serial Number]] (pISSN and eISSN), the range of years the journal has been published, the journal's previous or subsequent titles, and a link to the journal's pages on the publisher's website. Each journal listing includes a link to the OCLC [[WorldCat]] ''find item in a nearby library'' service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SafetyLit Journal Source List|url=http://www.safetylit.org/week/journals.php|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SafetyLit draws from journals that publish material that has been subjected to [[peer review]]. Most articles in SafetyLit are written in the English language or contain titles and abstracts in English.  However, the abstracts of some non-English articles are included after translation to English by staff or volunteers. Titles and abstracts in the original language are retained. SafetyLit staff and volunteers regularly hand-examine (issue by issue) more than 3800 current scholarly journals from many nations to find relevant material.&lt;ref name=ssources /&gt; Other journals are scanned at least once per volume.&lt;ref name="JACRS"&gt;{{Citation
 | title = SafetyLit: A bibliographic service for injury prevention
 | year = 2011
 | journal = Journal of the Australasian College of Road Safety
 | pages = 279–296
 | volume = 44
 | issue = 4
 | last1 = Oliverio	 | first1 =  Stephanie M.F.
 | last2 =  Lawrence	 | first2 =  David W.
	}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Home&gt;{{cite web|title=SafetyLit Home Page|url=http://www.safetylit.org/index.htm|accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gray Literature====
In mid-January 2013, SafetyLit announced that it was accepting submissions of academic doctoral theses on relevant topics (see below).&lt;ref name=Thesis&gt;{{cite web|title=SafetyLit Thesis Project|url=http://www.safetylit.org/thesis-project.pdf|accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early February of that year, more than 150 theses from 18 universities had been added.

==How items are selected==
SafetyLit includes summaries of "scholarly" reports, conference proceedings, and journal articles about injury occurrence and risk factors. More specifically, items are considered relevant if they concern any of the pre-event or event elements of the [[Haddon Matrix]]; the epidemiology of injury and injury risk factors; or the financial, personal, or societal costs or consequences of the any injury or risk factor.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web|title=SafetyLit FAQ|url=http://www.safetylit.org/faq.html|accessdate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although items are screened for relevant content, SafetyLit makes no attempt to screen for quality. The nature and rigor of the peer review process at one journal may be quite different from other journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | title = Peer review for journals: Evidence on quality control, fairness, and innovation
 | year = 1997
 | journal = Science and Engineering Ethics
 | pages = 63–84
 | volume = 3
 | issue = 1
 | doi = 10.1007/s11948-997-0017-3
 | last1 = Armstrong	 | first1 =  J. Scott

	}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same may be said for academic programs, book publishers, government agencies, etc. The SafetyLit site contains the following statement:

:The purpose of SafetyLit is to provide information to allow users to identify and find articles (both good and poor) that have been published about injury prevention and safety promotion topics... An important part of professionalism is to identify flawed publications and counter the flaws by commenting upon them in a letter to the editor of the journal where the article was published. Further, the best knowledge today may become outdated tomorrow. Although published corrections and errata are included [in SafetyLit when available], the older articles with inaccuracies are not removed from the site. These out-of-date items may be useful for authors or researchers who are examining the progression of scientific or social thought on a topic.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;

There are several very good bio-medicine databases that index articles about the assessment and the medical and surgical treatment of injuries (i.e. Medline, EMBASE, Scopus). Thus, in general, articles concerning medical treatment for injuries or complications of medical care are excluded except when the article also contains information on one of the inclusion criteria.  Similarly, articles that focus upon routine road or building repair and maintenance are excluded except when those articles are relevant to safety. SafetyLit also includes reports on other topics that may help a reader to make decisions about research or prevention strategies and priorities.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;

==SafetyLit Services==

===SafetyLit Weekly Update Bulletin===
The Weekly Update Bulletin is a pdf document containing citations of about 400 new items.&lt;ref name=ssources /&gt; Clicking on the title of the item will provide more detail such as an abstract or a link to the full text if these are available. Items are listed under 38 interest categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SafetyLit Categories|url=http://www.safetylit.org/category-definitions.html|accessdate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of the categories within SafetyLit is to make it easy for subscribers to the Weekly Update Bulletin to limit their content only to the topics that are within the sphere of their interest.

Items are assigned multiple categories based upon the answer to the question,&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; "Might someone with an interest in (category) find this article useful or interesting?" For example, a journal article concerning a physiological basis for deep emotional depression could be assigned to the Suicide and Self-Harm category even if suicide is not mentioned in the article text.

The contents of the weekly update are available 4 ways:&lt;ref name="JACRS" /&gt;

1. A PDF file is posted each Monday before 0100 UTC to the SafetyLit website (http://www.safetylit.org/archive.php). The current and past versions of the Weekly Update Bulletin may be found via the 'Browse archives' link from the SafetyLit homepage. The PDF file contains bookmarks that allow a reader to jump directly to any category without needing to scroll through 50-plus pages of citations to get to their category of interest. Those who wish to do so may subscribe to an email notice that will alert them when the bulletin is available at an earlier hour.

2. The new week's citations and abstracts are available in html format at 0100 UTC each Monday by clicking on the 'View current abstracts' link from the SafetyLit home page. (After this time the previous week's material is only available by viewing the appropriate PDF file on the Browse Archives pages or by searching the database.) From here it is possible to scroll through all the week's citations and abstracts or to check selected tick boxes to limit the scope of articles to certain interest categories.

3. A frequent SafetyLit user may avoid the need to tick or un-tick category select-boxes by registering and signing up for a personalized custom listing of articles. This '[http://www.safetylit.org/citations/index.php?fuseaction=citations.customsearch My SafetyLit]' option allows a user to record the category or categories they want to view each week. Users may allow their browser to automatically log them in and effortlessly view only the citations and abstracts that match their custom setting.

4. Each of the SafetyLit categories is available via RSS feed. A feed with an unduplicated listing (without categories) of all articles is also available. This allows readers to receive new articles throughout the week as they are entered into SafetyLit or at any interval (from immediately upon posting up to once per month) that they desire.

===SafetyLit database archive===

The SafetyLit database contains more than 515,000 journal articles (as of 12 October 2016) with more than 400 articles and 50 gray literature items being added each week.&lt;ref name=ssources /&gt;&lt;ref name=Home /&gt; The database may be searched by author name or textword using the basic search screen or, if the advanced search screen is used, by author name, author [[ORCID]] ID number, textword (with wildcard characters and truncation), hybrid textword+synonyms, or journal using Boolean operators.

The textword+synonyms search uses the SafetyLit Thesaurus to allow a query to take advantage of [[synonym ring]] and hierarchical term searching. The synonym ring function allows a searcher to use a single textword such as 'baby walker' to substitute for doing a series of regular textword searches using the 15 other terms by which the device is known. The entry of a single term in the textword+synonym box will produce a listing of ''all'' articles with text containing ''any'' of the synonyms for that term.

The search system recognizes ambiguous English language query terms and offers more focused options. (See below.)

The SafetyLit Thesaurus is the basis for hybrid textword+synonym search capacity. There are often many synonyms and spelling variants for potential search terms. New terms and synonyms are added weekly. Work on the SafetyLit thesaurus is not finished, so the full hierarchical search system is not yet complete. However, some term hierarchies such as geographic area names are available for searching. For example, an index term search using ‘Australia’ will find articles that contain the words ‘Canberra’, ‘Adelaide’, or ‘Perth’, even if the SafetyLit records do not contain the word ‘Australia’. The SafetyLit Thesaurus is built on a modified version of TemaTres open-source software.

The thesaurus-aided search system also allows for ''' [[word-sense disambiguation]]'''. For example, a query using the term "football" will return a disambiguation screen &lt;ref name=disambiguate&gt;{{cite web|title=Disambiguation Example|url=http://www.safetylit.org/disambiguation-example.html|website=SafetyLit Search System|publisher=SafetyLit Foundation|accessdate=22 June 2015|ref=Football}}&lt;/ref&gt; that provides for the selection of any of several options for the various game types (American football, Association football (soccer), Australian-rules football, Canadian football, Flag football, Gaelic football, etc.) each with different rules and player protection.

===Availability of search results to bibliography management software===
All resources found from a query of the SafetyLit database are directly available to the free [[Zotero]] [[reference management software]]. Records may also be downloaded in [[RIS (file format)|RIS]], ENW, and [[BibTeX]] formats for import into other software such as [[EndNote]], [[Mendeley]], [[Papers (software)|Papers]], etc. The metadata for each SafetyLit record is silently available in [[COinS]], [[unAPI]], and Google Scholar/Highwire Press metadata formats.

==Controversy==
Researchers and policymakers who address controversial safety-related issues have been targets of threats or violence for hundreds of years from those with strong feelings who wish to obstruct certain knowledge for the basis of evidence-based policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Others take more extreme action to make their point. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks have been made against the SafetyLit servers. Other attackers organized their interest groups to subscribe to the SafetyLit email service and then to label the SafetyLit messages as unsolicited spam by using their internet service providers' automated reporting process. This in an unsuccessful attempt to block all users of that ISP from receiving SafetyLit email messages.

Some of the topics that bring the most complaints are not what might be expected:&lt;ref name="Attacks"/&gt;

:The single most controversial subject that generates the most letters are citations to articles that complainers believe promote [[bicycle helmet]] wearing. Throughout the years 2006-2011, SafetyLit received an average of 16.4 complaints each week that the Update Bulletin contains a citation to an article about bicycle helmets. (Articles about helmet ''laws'' are not counted here. Instead, they are included below under 'nanny government'.)

:The second-most controversial topic is any article concerning brain or spinal cord injury prevention. These complaints come from those who take an extreme view on issues of the rights of persons with acquired disabilities. They argue that efforts to prevent central nervous system injuries suggest that persons who have experienced these injuries are less valued than persons who are uninjured.

*Articles about '[[nanny government]]' laws or regulations (14.3 complaints per week). These are complaints about issues such as: building codes; motor vehicle design standards and regulations (e.g. air bags, helmet laws, speed limits, cellular telephone prohibitions); consumer product risks and regulations.
*Articles they believe are biased in favor of firearm control regulations (14.1)
*Articles they believe are biased in opposition to firearm control regulations (11.6)
*Articles about an ethnic group or population they do not like (8.3)
*Articles about suicide prevention (5.2). The writers believe that suicide can be a good and rational choice—even for adolescents.
*Articles that reference psychology, human behavior, and risk-taking (5.0). The writers believe that these are biased in favor of psychology and psychiatry, professions they believe are a threat to basic human rights and a danger to society.
*Articles about intimate partner violence (4.8). Correspondents say the problem is exaggerated, that most reported cases are lies, or that most times the physical aggression was provoked and deserved.
*Articles about alcohol and the risk of traffic crashes (4.7). The writers argue that people who drink and drive rarely have crashes and, when they do, it is not necessarily related to alcohol or that, for the many drivers who are tense and highly strung, alcohol relaxes them and they drive more safely.

[[File:Rest Stop, North Korea. (2604218611).jpg|thumb|A man [[tobacco smoking|smokes]] at a shop selling cigarettes.]]
[[Tobacco smoking]] is popular and, at least for men, culturally acceptable in [[North Korea]]. {{As of|2014}}, some 45% of men are reported to smoke daily, whilst in contrast only 2.5% of women smoke daily, with most of these being older women from rural areas. Smoking is a leading cause of death in North Korea, and {{as of|2010|lc=yes}} mortality figures indicate that 34% of men and 22% of women die due to smoking-related causes, the highest mortality figures in the world. There are [[tobacco control]] programs in North Korea, and although smoking is not [[Smoking ban|prohibited]] in all public spaces, the smoking rates have declined since their peak in the 2000s.

All three [[Leader of North Korea|leaders of North Korea]]—[[Kim Il-sung]], [[Kim Jong-il]], and [[Kim Jong-un]]; have been smokers and the country has struggled to balance their public image with its anti-smoking efforts. In general, North Koreans tend to prefer strong tobacco and different classes of quality range from homegrown to sought-after foreign brands that are considered [[status symbol]]s. As a percentage of the available arable land compared to consumption, the tobacco crop is over-represented in North Korean agriculture.

==Consumption==
Over 4,569,000 adults and 167,000 children in [[North Korea]] are believed to consume [[tobacco]] daily.&lt;ref name="Country"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tobaccoatlas.org/country-data/dpr-korea/ |title=Country Fact Sheet: DPR Korea |publisher=World Lung Foundation| website=The Tobacco Atlas |date=2015 |access-date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated by the [[World Lung Foundation]] and [[American Cancer Society]]'s ''The Tobacco Atlas'' (2014 data) that 45% of men, 2.5% of women, nearly 16% of boys and &lt;1% of girls (aged &lt;15) are daily smokers,&lt;ref name="Country" /&gt; with the average smoker (data is likely skewed towards males due to the higher prevalence of smoking in this group) smoking an average of 609 cigarettes per person per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tobaccoatlas.org/topic/cigarette-use-globally/ |title=Cigarette Use Globally |website=The Tobacco Atlas |date=2014 |access-date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) data is roughly comparable, with 44% of men classified as smokers (only 33% are classed as "daily smokers"),{{sfn|''WHO Country Profile''|2015|p=2}} whilst North Korean anti-smoking authorities put the figure even higher, saying that some 54% of men are smokers.&lt;ref name="SCMP2016"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Smokers' Paradise: North Korea is Now Urging People to Quit, though Kim Jong-un Sets a Poor Example | agency = Associated Press | work = South China Morning Post | date = 6 July 2016 | accessdate = 25 October 2016 | url = http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/1986135/smokers-paradise-north-korea-now-urging-people-quit-though-kim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the average smoker consumes 12.4 cigarettes per day,&lt;ref name="STEP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/entity/chp/steps/DPRK_STEPS_Report_2008.pdf#page=7|title=STEPwise Approach to Chronic Disease Risk Factor Surveillance|year=2007|publisher=World Health Organization|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; with this figure rising slightly to 15 per day when just male smokers are considered.{{sfn|WHO|2009|p=13}} The average smoker starts smoking at the age of 23 and the percentage of the population that smokes increases with age until the 55–64 age group,{{sfn|WHO|2009|p=13}} after which it declines.&lt;ref name="STEP" /&gt; On average, people who live in urban areas tend to smoke more cigarettes per day than rural farmers.{{sfn|WHO|2009|p=13}}

Data indicates that the prevalence of smoking in North Korea is on par with [[South Korea]], although South Korean men pick up the habit earlier and smoke more cigarettes per day.{{sfn|Khang|2013|p=926}} The high rate of smoking in South Korea is possibly due to it being a capitalist society, where marketing is prevalent and consumption is uncontrolled. {{sfn|Khang|2013|p=927}}

However, much of the current information regarding the smoking habits of North Koreans is obtained by studying [[North Korean defectors]] who now live in South Korea and may not be totally representative of the true picture. One study of defectors found that smoking is even more common than anticipated, but [[nicotine dependence]] was not as severe as predicted. Defectors are reported as often being very interested in quitting smoking.{{sfn|Kim et al.|2016|p=685}}

Tobacco first arrived in [[Korea]] in the early-1600s from [[Japan]]{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=107}} and until around 1880, both men and women smoked.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=109}} Today, North Koreans consider smoking to be a normal activity for men, but [[Women and smoking|female smoking]] has become a social taboo.&lt;ref name="Lee2015"/&gt;

All of North Korea's three [[Leader of North Korea|leaders]]—[[Kim Jong-un]], his father [[Kim Jong-il]] and grandfather [[Kim Il-sung]]; have been smokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = A South Korean Spy Agency Claims They've Worked Out How Much Weight Kim Jong Un Has Put On | last = Oppenheim | first = Maya | work = The Independent | date = 3 July 2016 | accessdate = 18 August 2016 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/kim-jong-un-north-korea-weight-gain-binge-eating-a7117236.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim Jong-il has called smokers one of the "three main fools of the 21st century", along with people who do not understand music or computers.&lt;ref name="Choson2016"/&gt; The current leader Kim Jong-un is often seen smoking in public,&lt;ref name="Macdonald2016"/&gt; including in university classrooms, subway carriages, and in the presence of his pregnant wife [[Ri Sol-ju]],&lt;ref name="DailyNK2016"/&gt; facts that "might make the life of the North Korean health educators more complicated."&lt;ref name="Lee2015"/&gt; While discussing any negative aspects of the leaders has normally been rare, some North Koreans have recently raised the issue of the apparent contradiction between anti-smoking measures and Kim's public image with foreigners.&lt;ref name="Macdonald2016"/&gt;

==Culture==
===Women and smoking===
[[Women and smoking|Female smoking]] is a taboo in North Korea&lt;ref name="Lee2015"/&gt; and is considered even more disgraceful than heavy drinking. Women are said to "react with shock if you joke that maybe they secretly smoke in bathrooms".&lt;ref name="Choson2016"/&gt; Smoking by older women, above the age of 45 to 50{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=109}} is more tolerated, particularly in rural areas.&lt;ref name="Lee2015"/&gt; In comparison, for men smoking is considered such an important social activity that men who do not smoke can become socially isolated at workplaces.&lt;ref name="Lee2015"/&gt;

===Smokers' preferences===
[[File:PYONGYANG SUNAN AIRPORT AWAITING FOR AIR KORYO IL18 DEPARTURE TO ORANG MOUNT CHILBO ON A WET TUESDAY MORNING DPR KOREA OCT 2012 (8195707755).jpg|thumb|Cigarettes being sold at a [[duty-free shop]] at [[Pyongyang Sunan International Airport]]]]
Even though most consumer items are in short supply in North Korea, there is a considerable variety of cigarettes available.&lt;ref name="SCMP2016"/&gt; In general, strong tobacco is preferred,&lt;ref name="Lee2015"/&gt; and [[Cigarette filter|filters]] are rare.{{sfn|Hokkanen|2013|p=97}} Western brands, particularly American, but also Chinese, Russian and Japanese{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=108}}&lt;ref name="SCMP2016" /&gt; are popular with the elite and preferred over domestic cigarettes.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=108}} Foreign cigarettes and the domestic [[727 (cigarette)|727]] brand, whose name stands for 27 July, the date of the [[Korean Armistice Agreement]]; are veritable [[status symbol]]s.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=108}}&lt;ref name="SCMP2016"/&gt; [[Menthol cigarette]]s are virtually non-existent, but there is competition among tobacco companies to introduce other attractive products, such as fruit-flavoured balls inside the filter to give the cigarette a more distinct flavour.&lt;ref name="SCMP2016" /&gt;

Those who have [[hard currency]] can easily buy imported cigarettes from [[hard currency shop]]s,{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=108}} although these will also stock the best domestic brands (such as [[Pak Ma]], comparable in quality to [[makhorka]]) to convince tourists of the quality of North Korean tobacco.{{sfn|Hokkanen|2013|p=97}} Cigarettes are popular gifts,{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=107}} and tourists are recommended to give Western brands of cigarettes to tour guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = North Korea Travel Rules and Tips | publisher = New Korea Tours | date = 2014 | accessdate = 18 August 2016 | url = http://www.newkoreatours.com/north_korea_travel_rules.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the country, cigarettes are used as form of currency in [[Corruption in North Korea|bribery]].{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=107}}

[[File:Air Koryo complimentary newspaper.jpg|thumb|The party newspaper ''[[Rodong Sinmun]]'' is used as [[rolling paper]] for [[roll-your-own cigarette]]s.]]
Those who [[Roll-your-own cigarette|roll their own]] tobacco prefer to use sheets of ''[[Rodong Sinmun]]''—the organ of the [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea|Central Committee]] of the ruling [[Workers' Party of Korea]]—as [[rolling paper]].{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=108}} One piece of the paper can be used to roll some 40-50 cigarettes. According to one defector, when a North Korean "starts to smoke the ''Rodong Sinmun'' tobacco, he cannot smoke other kinds of tobacco. I used to smoke the ''Rodong Sinmun'' tobacco, and after defection, couldn't smoke with Chinese paper tobacco due to the poor taste."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Who Reads North Korea's Rodong Sinmun Newspaper? | work = NK News | date = 13 October 2015 | accessdate = 24 March 2016 | url = https://www.nknews.org/2015/10/who-reads-north-koreas-rodong-sinmun-newspaper/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ''Rodong Sinmun'' is in limited circulation, most North Koreans roll their cigarettes with some other paper.{{sfn|Hokkanen|2013|p=98}}

==Health effects==
The health impacts of smoking are well documented and in North Korea the high prevalence of smoking has a significant impact on the health of the population.{{sfn|WHO|2009|p=13}} Some 34.3% of men and 22.3% of women are reported to die as a result of smoking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobaccoatlas.org/topic/smokings-death-toll/|title=Smoking's Death Toll|date=2010|website=The Tobacco Atlas|publisher=World Lung Foundation|access-date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the highest smoking mortality figures in the world,{{sfn|Eriksen|Mackay|Schluger|Gomeshtapeh|2015|pp=14–15}} and in total tobacco-caused illness kills 55,600 North Koreans annually.&lt;ref name="Country"/&gt;

==Tobacco control==
Tobacco is only sold at designated shops at a fixed price set by the government.{{sfn|WHO|2011|p=22}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Law of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on Tobacco Control|2009|loc=Articles 22 and 23}}}} {{As of|2014}}, a 20-pack of the most common cigarette brand costs 246.38 KPW [[North Korean won]] (£0.21, US$0.27),{{sfn|''WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic''|2015|p=137}} whilst the cheapest 20-pack sells for as little as 7.47 won (£0.01, US$0.0083).{{sfn|''WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic''|2015|p=149}}

North Korea has set up specific government objectives for [[tobacco control]] and there is a national agency to implement them, with eight full-time staff members.{{sfn|''WHO Country Profile''|2015|p=1}} Although there is no free of charge [[smoking cessation]] [[quitline]] that smokers could phone and discuss their problems, most healthcare facilities offer support in cessation,{{sfn|''WHO Country Profile''|2015|p=4}} including cessation programs and [[nicotine replacement therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=
http://www.tobaccoatlas.org/topic/quitting/ |title=Quitting |publisher=World Lung Foundation| website=The Tobacco Atlas |date=2012 |access-date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costs are covered for the patient partially, or in full by the state.{{sfn|''WHO Country Profile''|2015|p=4}} In addition to regular healthcare clinics, there are eleven specialised anti-smoking centres in the country where consultation is free, but medicine is not.&lt;ref name="SCMP2016"/&gt; Of medicines, [[bupropion]] and [[varenicline]] are not legally available in North Korea,{{sfn|''WHO Country Profile''|2015|p=4}} but herbal medicines are used as smoking cessation aids.&lt;ref name="SCMP2016"/&gt;

There have been attempts at anti-smoking movements "across the generations" in the country,&lt;ref name="Macdonald2016"/&gt; with the earliest major campaign taking place in 2004.&lt;ref name="Choson2016"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Smoking in Pyongyang | work = chosonexchange.org | publisher = Choson Exchange | date = 30 June 2016 | accessdate = 25 October 2016 | url = http://www.chosonexchange.org/our-blog/2016/6/30/smoking-in-pyongyang}}&lt;/ref&gt; While early campaigns had little effect, they have become more frequent in the 2010s and restrictions on smoking have been observed more closely in recent years;&lt;ref name="Macdonald2016"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Mixed Messages on Smoking Restrictions in North Korea | last = Macdonald | first = Hamish | work = NK News | date = 6 July 2016 | accessdate = 25 October 2016 | url = https://www.nknews.org/2016/07/mixed-messages-on-smoking-restrictions-in-north-korea/}}&lt;/ref&gt; consequently, since the early-2000s; smoking rates have started to decline.&lt;ref name="Lee2015"&gt;{{Cite web | title = North Korea's Halting Anti-smoking Efforts | first = Michelle |last = Lee | work = NK News | date = 4 December 2015 | accessdate = 28 July 2016 | url = https://www.nknews.org/2015/12/north-koreas-halting-anti-smoking-efforts/}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are signs that the North Korean government takes anti-smoking campaigns more seriously than they did in the past.&lt;ref name="Macdonald2016" /&gt; According to the WHO, North Korea now "keenly celebrates [[World No Tobacco Day]] (WNTD) every year and disseminates information about tobacco use and its effect on health. The Government persuades public health institutions and the media to spread the information about the health effects of tobacco and its adverse impact on environmental protection and economic development."{{sfn|WHO|2011|p=22}}

===Law===
Smoking legislation in North Korea has tightened in recent years, although it is still relatively lax and has not had any really meaningful effect on curtailing smoking rates.&lt;ref name="DailyNK2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Macdonald2016"/&gt; The rules on where people can or cannot smoke are complex, with smoking prohibited on pavements, ferries, aircraft and at stations, in healthcare and educational facilities, pre-schools and nurseries, shops, theatres, cinemas, culture halls and conference rooms, historic and battle sites, and hotel lobbies.{{sfn|''WHO Country Profile''|2015|p=3}}{{sfn|WHO|2012|p=88}}{{sfn|WHO|2011|p=22}}&lt;ref name="Macdonald2016" /&gt;{{efn|{{harvnb|Law of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on Tobacco Control|2009|loc=Articles 27 and 28}}}} However, smoking is not prohibited in either private or work vehicles or on-board trains, at bus stops, near entrances to buildings, in universities, government offices, workplaces, restaurants, cafes, bars, or nightclubs.{{sfn|''WHO Country Profile''|2015|p=3}}{{sfn|WHO|2012|p=88}}&lt;ref name="Macdonald2016" /&gt;

[[File:Grand People's Study House, smoking lounge.JPG|thumb|left|A smoking lounge at the [[Grand People's Study House]] in [[Pyongyang]]]]
Some of the legislation is observed with high levels of compliance,{{sfn|''WHO Country Profile''|2015|p=3}} but not uniformly throughout the country.&lt;ref name="Macdonald2016"/&gt; There are not mandatory fines for smoking transgressions,{{sfn|''WHO Country Profile''|2015|p=3}} although the newest 2016 anti-smoking campaign has seen fines issued and offenders threatened with images of them being broadcast on TV.&lt;ref name="DailyNK2016"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Smoking Ban by Cigarette-loving Kim Riles Residents | author = Seol Song Ah | work = Daily NK | date = 27 June 2016 | accessdate = 25 October 2016 | url = http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk01500&amp;num=13961}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tobacco packaging warning messages]] are required on all types of packaging, but their appearance is not regulated in any way.{{sfn|''WHO Country Profile''|2015|pp=5–6}} They are usually printed in small print on the side of the package and only state that smoking is harmful to health.&lt;ref name="SCMP2016" /&gt; However, the descriptions must state the [[nicotine]] and [[Tar (tobacco residue)|tar]] content,{{sfn|WHO|2011|p=22}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Law of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on Tobacco Control|2009|loc=Article 12}}}} must not be misleading and do need to be approved by local authorities.{{sfn|WHO|2012|p=80}} Graphic warning images that are now common worldwide have never appeared on packaging in North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tobaccoatlas.org/topic/warnings-packaging/ |title=Warnings &amp; Packaging |publisher=World Lung Foundation |website=The Tobacco Atlas |date=2015 |access-date=31 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906180844/http://www.tobaccoatlas.org/topic/warnings-packaging/ |archivedate=6 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no restrictions on [[tobacco advertising]],{{sfn|''WHO Country Profile''|2015|p=8}} although there are no advertising campaigns of any kind in [[media of North Korea|North Korean media]].{{sfn|WHO|2009|p=68}} Tobacco may not be sold to minors {{efn|{{harvnb|Law of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on Tobacco Control|2009|loc=Article 24}}}}{{sfn|WHO|2011|p=23}} (those under the age of seventeen)&lt;ref name="SCMP2016" /&gt; and [[Cigarette machine]]s are banned.{{sfn|''WHO Country Profile''|2015|p=8}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Law of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on Tobacco Control|2009|loc=Article 22}}}} North Korea imposes no kind of tax at all on tobacco, including specific [[excise]], ''[[ad valorem]]'' excise, [[value-added tax]], [[sales tax]], or [[import duty]].{{sfn|''WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic''|2015|p=137}} [[Electronic cigarette]]s are legal.{{sfn|''WHO Country Profile''|2015|p=9}}

The tobacco industry in North Korea is substantial,&lt;ref name="Choson2016"/&gt; with 53,000 hectares (2.3% of its arable land)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobaccoatlas.org/topic/growing-tobacco/|title=Growing Tobacco|date=2012|website=The Tobacco Atlas|publisher=World Lung Foundation|access-date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated to tobacco cultivation. This is the fourth-highest percentage of arable land dedicated to tobacco in the world,{{sfn|Eriksen|Mackay|Schluger|Gomeshtapeh|2015|p=47}} with the annual output exceeding 80,000 tonnes, making North Korea one of the top 25 tobacco producers worldwide. This is despite 31% of North Koreans being malnourished.{{sfn|Eriksen|Mackay|Schluger|Gomeshtapeh|2015|p=46}} The best, strongest and most expensive tobacco comes from the north of the DPRK near [[China–North Korea border|the border with China]].{{sfn|Hokkanen|2013|p=98}}

There are many North Korean tobacco companies,&lt;ref name="Choson2016"/&gt; making some 30 different types of cigarettes,{{sfn|Lankov|2007|page=107}} with the biggest tobacco company being the North Korea General Tobacco Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobaccoatlas.org/topic/tobacco-companies/|title=Tobacco Companies|date=2014|website=The Tobacco Atlas|publisher=World Lung Foundation|access-date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies export tobacco to the [[Middle East]] and elsewhere, sometimes in partnership with foreign firms. For example, the [[Taedong River Tobacco Company]] and the [[Rason Shinhung Tobacco Company]], both operating in the [[Rason Special Economic Zone]], are partnered with the Chinese [[Jilin Tobacco]]. [[British American Tobacco]] also has business in the country, but it has reduced its involvement due to political pressure and public relations reasons.&lt;ref name="Choson2016" /&gt; During the [[Cold War]], North Korea paid for goods it imported from the [[Soviet Union]] with poor quality tobacco.&lt;ref name="Lankov2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lankov|first=Andrei|title=The Real North Korea: Life and Politics in the Failed Stalinist Utopia|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-939003-8|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, during the years of the [[Sunshine Policy]], high-end [[Pyongyang (cigarette)|Pyongyang]] brand cigarettes were exported to South Korea where they were popular among South Koreans who wanted to express a pro-[[Korean reunification|reunification]] stance.{{sfn|Hokkanen|2013|p=97}} There are some privately owned tobacco factories, some of which are known to produce [[Counterfeit consumer goods|counterfeit]] brand cigarettes for export as part of [[North Korea's illicit activities]] to earn hard currency.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=108}} North Korea is one of the largest producers of counterfeit cigarettes in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cha|first=Victor|title=The Impossible State: North Korea, Past and Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AShswwfIbqsC&amp;pg=PA8|year=2012|publisher=Random House|location=London|isbn=978-1-4481-3958-3|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaf tobacco is cheap and can be bought from markets to roll one's own cigarettes. Many rural farmers produce homegrown tobacco on their own plot of land, while others steal tobacco from co-operative farms for sale.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=108}}

'''Straub Medical Center''' is not-for-profit health care system with a 159-bed hospital in [[Honolulu]], and a network of neighborhood clinics.

==History==
George F. Straub founded the clinic in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hawaiipacifichealth.org/straub/about-us/overview/|title=Straub - About Us - Overview|website=www.hawaiipacifichealth.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Straub was educated in [[Germany]] and came to practice in [[Hawaii]] in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/stories/1996/12/02/story3.html|title=https://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/stories/1996/12/02/story3.html|website=www.bizjournals.com|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, he conceived the idea of forming a group of physicians to provide better, more specialized care for his patients. It, however, took over 10 years to bring this idea to fruition.

The first step in 1912 was the construction of a wood frame building at 410 South Beretania Street. Straub established his office on the first floor and his home on the second. By 1916 his practice had grown to the point that he recruited an assistant, Guy C. Milnor. Straub envisioned a clinic providing specialized care in five major fields: [[Obstetrics]] and [[Gynecology]], [[Surgery]], [[Internal Medicine]], [[Otolaryngology|ENT]], and [[Clinical Pathology]]. To this end, he next enlisted Arthur Jackson, a specialist in [[internal medicine]] in 1920 and the group carried on for a short time as Straub, Milnor, and Jackson.

In the latter part of 1920, Howard Clarke resigned his commission in the [[United States Army]] and joined as a specialist in Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat. Eric A Fennel also left the Army about this time and joined the group as [[pathologist]].

In January, 1921, the five founding partners formally organized themselves as a legal partnership. At Straub's insistence the group he founded did not bear his name, and it was to be known simply as "The Clinic".
A specialist in [[internal medicine]] and [[radiology]], joined the clinic in 1921, a [[general surgeon]] in 1922, and a [[pediatrician]] joined in 1924.

In 1952 the clinic was renamed "Straub Clinic" in honor of Straub, who died in May, 1966.

On December 21, 2001 it became part of the [[Hawaii Pacific Health]] network.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hawaiipacifichealth.org/media/8537/straub-at-a-glance-122017ytd.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Straub currently has a total of 10 locations on 3 Hawaiian Islands: Oahu, Lanai, and Hawaii Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hawaiipacifichealth.org/straub/locations/|title=Driving Directions and Location Maps - Straub Medical Center and Clinics|website=www.hawaiipacifichealth.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13618">'''Urgent care''' is a category of [[walk-in clinic]] focused on the delivery of [[ambulatory care]] in a dedicated medical facility outside of a traditional [[emergency department]] (emergency room). Urgent care centers primarily treat [[injury|injuries]] or [[illness]]es requiring immediate care, but not serious enough to require an emergency department (ED) visit. Urgent care centers are distinguished from similar ambulatory healthcare centers such as emergency departments and [[convenient care clinic]]s by their scope of conditions treated and available facilities on-site.

The United States is seeing a rapid increase in the number of urgent care centres. In Europe and the United Kingdom, similar services are called [[walk-in centres]]. While urgent care centers are usually not open 24 hours a day, 70% of centers in the United States open by 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. or earlier and 95% close after 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Urgent Care Association of America |title='2012 Urgent Care Benchmarking Survey Results.' Urgent Care Industry Information Kit. 2013 |url=http://www.ucaoa.org/docs/UrgentCareMediaKit_2013.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urgent care in the United States==
The initial urgent care centers opened in the United States during the 1970s. Since then, this [[healthcare industry|healthcare]] sector has rapidly expanded to  approximately 10,000 centers across the United States. Many centers were started by [[emergency medicine]] [[physician]]s, responding to a public need for convenient access to unscheduled medical care. A significant factor for the increase of these centers is significant monetary savings when compared to [[emergency department|EDs]]. Many [[managed care]] organizations (MCOs) now encourage or even require customers to utilize urgent care options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blue Cross of GA Uses Google Maps to Encourage Use of Urgent Care |url=http://www.urgentcarenews.com/June2011/bcbs.php |publisher=Urgentcarenews.com |access-date=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2014, the urgent care industry is worth an estimated $14.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com-dly.us/2014/07/10/business/race-is-on-to-profit-from-rise-of-urgent-care.html |title=Race Is On to Profit from Rise of Urgent Care |work=The New York Times |date=2014-07-09 |accessdate=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographic features of urgent care patients and providers==
In 2014, US communities with non-hospital-based urgent care centers (UCCs) were mainly urban, located in areas with higher income levels and higher levels of private insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/4/e010663.full |title=Community characteristics associated with where UCCs are located: a cross-sectional analysis |last1= Le |first1=S T |last2=Hsia |first2=Renee Y |date=7 April 2016 |journal=[[BMJ Open]] |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=e010663 |doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010663 }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kaissi et al. considered local multi-hospital systems in Florida, Maryland, Nevada, Texas, Virginia and Washington.  In 2012 50% of 117 hospital-based "clusters" included either UCCs, retail clinics, or both. 57% of systems in Washington operated an UCC, compared to 36% of systems in Washington, while systems in Florida had the largest share of UCCs (17.6%).

Corwin et al. considered Medicare beneficiaries presenting to an UCC (n=1,426,354) emergency department (ED) (n=334,841) or physicians office (n=8,359,498) with upper respiratory or urinary tract infections, bronchitis, sprains or contusions, and back or arthritic pain, in 2012.  Patients who presented to an ED were more likely to be female (67% of ED presentations) compared to those who presented to a UCC or physicians office (65% and 64% respectively).  Patients who presented to an UCC were significantly more likely to be aged over 85 (27%, compared to 15% of physicians office presentations, and 13% of ED presentations) or Black (11%, compared to 6% of physicians office presentations, and 4% of ED presentations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Corwin |first1=GS |last2=Parker |first2=DM |last3=Brown |first3=JR |title=Site of Treatment for Non-Urgent Conditions by Medicare Beneficiaries: Is there a role for Urgent Care Centres? |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |volume=129 |issue=9 |pages=966 |year=2016 |doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2016.03.013|pmid=27083513 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2014, 3.1% of Family Physicians in the United States worked primarily in UCCs, with a male:female ratio of workforce is 6:7, and an urban:rural ratio of 2:1.

==Criteria for urgent care centers==
Both the Urgent Care Association of America (UCAOA) and the American Academy of Urgent Care Medicine (AAUCM) have established criteria for urgent care centers and the physicians that operate them. Each share similar qualifying criteria including:
* Must accept walk-in patients during business hours
* Treat a broad spectrum of illnesses and injuries, as well as perform minor medical procedures
* Have a licensed physician operating as the medical director
* Be open 7 days a week
* Have on-site diagnostic equipment, including [[phlebotomy]] and [[x-ray]]
* Contain multiple exam rooms
* Various ethical and business standards
*Contain a procedure room where stitches could be placed, a cast be put on a leg, or even a minor surgical procedure if it is not too risky and can be done under a local anesthetic (numbs a small portion of the body; however, will not put patient into a medically induced coma). 
*Contain communication lines with local hospitals so that patients who need transfer to an emergency room have easy access.

The UCAOA program is called Urgent Care Certification&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucaoa.org/cuc_about.php]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826172318/http://www.ucaoa.org/cuc_about.php |date=August 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the AAUCM is called Urgent Care Center Accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Urgent Care Accreditation?|url=http://aaucm.org/professionals/accreditation/default.aspx|publisher=Aaucm.org|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organized medicine and urgent care==
The [[Urgent Care Association of America]] (UCAOA) holds an annual spring convention and an annual fall conference. Founded in 2004, the UCAOA does not own any urgent care centers itself, but rather provides resources, training, and leadership to the industry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucaoa.org/?aboutUCAOA&lt;/ref&gt; Many leaders of organized urgent care  anticipate the establishment of urgent care as a fully recognized specialty. This organization launched an accreditation program in 2014, and has since partnered with an insurer called Urgent Care Assurance Company.

Urgent Care Management Monthly hosts a bi-annual conference, teaching doctors, investors, and owners about the business side of an urgent care center.
Urgent Care Management Monthly (UCMM) is the official publication for urgent care management, with discussions on topics such as billing, staffing, marketing, accounting, and logistics.

JUCM, The Journal of Urgent Care Medicine is the Official Publication of the Urgent Care Association of America (UCAOA). Each issue contains peer-reviewed clinical and practice management articles.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jucm.com/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

Board of Certification in Urgent Care Medicine (BCUCM) provides board certification for physicians with requisite training and experience. The Urgent Care College of Physicians (UCCOP) offers educational programs for physicians in the urgent care field, and advocates for the field's overall status as a unique specialty.

Another entity, the American Board of Urgent Care Medicine (ABUCM), was founded in 1997. This organization provides certification to urgent care programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abucm.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postgraduate training==
In 2006, the Urgent Care Association of America sponsored the first fellowship training program in urgent care medicine. A collaboration between the Department of Family Medicine University Hospitals of Cleveland / Case School of Medicine, the Urgent Care Association of America (UCAOA), and University Primary and Specialty Care Practices, Inc. in [[Cleveland]], Ohio made this fellowship possible. The program was partially funded by an unrestricted grant from the Urgent Care Association of America. Fellowship physicians receive training in many disciplines, including: adult emergencies, pediatric emergencies, wound &amp; injury evaluation and treatment, occupational medicine, urgent care procedures, and care center business aspects. In 2007, the Urgent Care Association of America (UCAOA) sponsored a second fellowship opportunity through the University of Illinois. The one-year fellowships are open to graduates of accredited Family Medicine and Med/Peds residencies.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Staffing and services==
Unlike other walk-in clinics such as [[convenient care clinic|retail clinics]], urgent care centers are generally staffed by a physician and supported by [[Nursing|nurses]], [[physician assistant]]s and [[medical assistant]]s. Sixty-five percent of urgent care centers have at least one physician on-site at all times.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Of the physicians that staff urgent care centers, 47.8% are [[family medicine]], 30.1% are [[emergency medicine]] and 7.6% are [[internal medicine]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

With these licensed physician on-site, urgent care centers are able to offer a wide range of services including [[Bone fracture|broken bones]], moderate cuts and lacerations requiring [[Surgical suture|stitches]], and most common injuries and illnesses. These services, of course, are made possible with the diagnostic equipment and [[x-ray]] machines typically found at an urgent care.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Of course, the urgent care centers are not an emergency department. They do not offer [[surgery|surgical services]], as a rule- particularly invasive surgical procedures (more than cutaneous or subcutaneous procedures- those involving body organs and organ parts, and/or deep penetration of deep fascia, tendons, ligaments, bursae, joints, muscles, or bones), any procedures requiring the use of regional or general anesthesia (more than topical local anesthesia), those procedures requiring a full operating room or suite, having lengthy recovery times, or requiring more than the level of imaging or specialists available at the center.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

That said, an estimated 13.7 to 27.1 percent of all emergency department visits could take place at an urgent care center or a retail clinic, generating a potential cost savings of approximately $4.4 billion annually, according to a 2010 study in ''[[Health Affairs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Weinick, R. M.|author2=Burns., R. M.|author3=Mehrotra, A|title=Many Emergency Department Visits Could Be Managed At Urgent Care Centers and Retail Clinics|publisher=Content.healthaffairs.org|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/29/9/1630.abstract|date=September 2010|accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
The majority of urgent care centers are owned by physicians or physician groups, however, more corporations and [[Investment banking|investment banks]] are acquiring urgent care centers and creating regional and national brands in the industry. The following is a breakdown of urgent care ownership following a 2012 study by the [[Urgent Care Association of America|UCAOA]]:
* 35.4 percent of centers owned by physicians or physician groups, down from 50 percent in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jucm.com/magazine/issues/2011/0811/files/42.html |title=The Journal of Urgent Care Medicine |publisher=Jucm.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 30.5 percent owned by a corporation, up from 13.5 percent in 2010
* 25.2 percent owned by a hospital
* 4.4 percent owned by a non-physician individual
* 2.2 percent owned by a franchise

==Codes for urgent care==
In recent years the American Medical Association approved the code UCM (Urgent Care Medicine). This code allows physicians to self-designate as specializing in urgent care medicine. Services rendered in an urgent care center may be designated, using the place of service code -20 (POS -20) on the CMS-1500 form, as submitted to third-party payers. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) have designated two specific codes to apply to urgent care centers: S9083 (global fee for urgent care centers) and S9088 (services rendered in an urgent care center).{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Whooping cough boy.ogv|thumb|upright=1.3|A boy with pertussis]]
The classic symptoms of pertussis are a [[paroxysmal]] cough, inspiratory whoop, and [[fainting]], or [[vomiting]] after coughing.&lt;ref name=JAMA2010&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cornia PB, Hersh AL, Lipsky BA, Newman TB, Gonzales R | title = Does this coughing adolescent or adult patient have pertussis? | journal = JAMA | volume = 304 | issue = 8 | pages = 890–6 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20736473 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2010.1181 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cough from pertussis has been documented to cause [[subconjunctival hemorrhage]]s, [[rib fracture]]s, [[urinary incontinence]], [[hernias]], and [[vertebral artery dissection]].&lt;ref name=JAMA2010/&gt; Violent coughing can cause the [[pleura]] to rupture, leading to a [[pneumothorax]]. Vomiting after a coughing spell or an inspiratory whooping sound on coughing, almost doubles the likelihood that the illness is pertussis. The absence of a paroxysmal cough or posttussive [[emesis]], though, makes it almost half as likely.&lt;ref name="JAMA2010"/&gt;

The illness usually starts with mild respiratory symptoms include mild coughing, sneezing, or a [[Rhinorrhea|runny nose]]. This is known as the [[catarrhal]] stage. After one to two weeks, the coughing classically develops into uncontrollable fits,  followed by a high-pitched "whoop" sound in younger children, or a gasping sound in older children, as the person tries to inhale ([[Paroxysmal attack|paroxysmal]] stage).

This stage usually lasts two to eight weeks, or sometimes longer. A gradual transition then occurs to the convalescent stage, which usually lasts one to four weeks. This stage is marked by a decrease in paroxysms of coughing, although paroxysms may occur with subsequent respiratory infection for many months after the onset of pertussis.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/pert.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incubation period===

==Cause==
Pertussis is caused by the bacterium ''[[Bordetella pertussis]]''.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=CDC2014C/&gt; --&gt; It is an [[airborne disease]] (through droplets) that spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person.&lt;ref name=CDC2014C/&gt;

===Spread from other animals===
Uncertainties have existed of ''B. pertussis'' and whooping cough as a [[Zoonosis|zoonotic disease]] since around 1910&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Inaba I | year = 1912 | title = Über den Bordet-Gengouschen Keuchhustenbacillus Übertragungsversuches des Keuchenhustens auf Tiere | url = | journal = Z Kinderheilkd | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 252–264 | doi=10.1007/bf02088879}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bachamn W, Burghard E | year = 1925 | title = Der Nachweis der Bordet-Gengouschen Bacillen und ihre aetiologische Bedeutung für den Keuchenhusten | url = | journal = Z Kinderheilkd | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 465–483 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the 1930s, knowledge was gained that the bacteria lost their [[virulence|virulent]] power when repeatedly spread on [[agar]] media. This explained the difficulties to reproduce results from different studies as the pre-inoculating handlings of the bacteria were not standardized among scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shibley|first1=GS|last2=Hoelscher|first2=H|title=Studies on whooping cough.

Today it is established that at least some [[primate]] species are highly susceptible to ''B. pertussis'' and develop clinical whooping cough in high [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] when exposed to low inoculation doses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gustavsson OE, Röken BO, Serrander R | year = 1990 | title = An Epizootic of Whooping Cough among Chimpanzees in a Zoo | url = | journal = Folia Primatol | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 45–50 | doi=10.1159/000156498}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Warfel JM, Merkel TJ | date = Oct 2014 | title = The baboon model of pertussis: effective use and lessons for pertussis vaccines | url = | journal = Expert Rev Vaccines | volume = 13 | issue = 10| pages = 1241–52 | doi = 10.1586/14760584.2014.946016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bacteria may be present in wild animal populations, but this is not confirmed by laboratory diagnosis, although whooping cough is known among wild [[gorilla]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Butynski TM et al.

Bloomsbury Publishing, London, 2013. {{ISBN|978-1-4081-2252-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[zoo]]s also have a long-standing custom of vaccinating their primates against whooping cough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Loomis MR |chapter=Immunoprofylaxis in infant great apes |editor1=Graham CE |editor2=Bowen JA |series=Monographs in Primatology |volume=5 |title=Clinical Management of Infant Great Apes |pages=107–112 |publisher=Liss |location=New York |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
After the bacteria are inhaled, they initially adhere to the ciliated epithelium in the nasopharynx. Surface proteins of ''B. pertussis'', including [[filamentous hemaglutinin]] and [[pertactin]], mediate attachment to the epithelium. The bacteria then multiply.&lt;ref name="Top2017"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Top|first1=Karina A.|last2=Halperin|first2=Scott A.|editor1-last=Kasper|editor1-first=Dennis L.|editor2-last=Fauci|editor2-first=Anthony S.|title=Harrison's Infectious Diseases|date=2017|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|location=New York|isbn=9781259835971|pages=502–506|edition=3|chapter=Pertussis and other Bordetella infections}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kilgore2016&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kilgore PE, Salim AM, Zervos MJ, Schmitt HJ |title=Pertussis: Microbiology, Disease, Treatment, and Prevention |journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=449–86 |date=July 2016 |pmid=27029594 |pmc=4861987 |doi=10.1128/CMR.00083-15 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In infants, who experience more severe disease, the bacteria spread down to the lungs.&lt;ref name=Kilgore2016/&gt;

The bacteria secrete a number of toxins. [[Tracheal cytotoxin]], a fragment of [[peptidoglycan]], kills ciliated epithelial cells and thereby inhibits the mucociliary elevator by which mucus and debris are removed.&lt;ref name=Hewlett2014&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hewlett EL, Burns DL, Cotter PA, Harvill ET, Merkel TJ, Quinn CP, Stibitz ES |title=Pertussis pathogenesis--what we know and what we don't know |journal=The Journal of Infectious Diseases |volume=209 |issue=7 |pages=982–5 |date=April 2014 |pmid=24626533 |pmc=3952676 |doi=10.1093/infdis/jit639 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TCT may contribute to the cough characteristic of pertussis.&lt;ref name=Melvin2014&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Melvin JA, Scheller EV, Miller JF, Cotter PA |title=Bordetella pertussis pathogenesis: current and future challenges |journal=Nature Reviews.

The elevated number of white blood cells leads to [[pulmonary hypertension]], a major cause of death by pertussis.&lt;ref name=Hewlett2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kilgore2016/&gt;  In infants who develop [[encephalopathy]], cerebral hemorrhage and cortical atrophy occur, likely due to [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].&lt;ref name=Kilgore2016/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Bordetella pertussis.jpg|thumb|Gram stain of ''Bordetella pertussis'']]
A physician's overall impression is most effective in initially making the diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Eb2017/&gt; Single factors are much less useful.&lt;ref name=Eb2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ebell|first1=MH|last2=Marchello|first2=C|last3=Callahan|first3=M|title=Clinical Diagnosis of Bordetella Pertussis Infection: A Systematic Review.|journal=J Am Board Fam Med|date=2017|volume=30|issue=3|pages=308–319|doi=10.3122/jabfm.2017.03.160330|pmid=28484063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods used in laboratory diagnosis include [[microbiological culture|culturing]] of nasopharyngeal swabs on a nutrient medium ([[Bordet-Gengou agar|Bordet-Gengou medium]]), [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), [[direct fluorescent antibody]] (DFA), and [[serology|serological]] methods (e.g. [[complement fixation test]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Agustín|last=Pedro-Pons|title=Patología y Clínica Médicas|year=1968|edition=3rd|page=615|volume=6|publisher=Salvat|isbn=84-345-1106-1|language=Spanish|location=Barcelona}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bacteria can be recovered from the person only during the first three weeks of illness, rendering culturing and DFA useless after this period, although PCR may have some limited usefulness for an additional three weeks.

Serology may be used for adults and adolescents who have already been infected for several weeks to determine whether antibody against [[pertussis toxin]] or another virulence factor of ''B. pertussis'' is present at high levels in the blood of the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.eurodiagnostica.com/index.php?headId=4&amp;pageId=4&amp;langId=1&amp;diseaseId=8#nr1-tab| title = Pertussis| date = | website = Euro Diagnostica| publisher = Euro Diagnostica AB| access-date = 29 February 2016| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304231237/http://www.eurodiagnostica.com/index.php?headId=4&amp;pageId=4&amp;langId=1&amp;diseaseId=8#nr1-tab| archivedate = 4 March 2016| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
The primary method of prevention for pertussis is [[vaccination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pertussis {{!}} Whooping Cough {{!}} Vaccination {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/vaccines.html|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=27 May 2017|language=en-us|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170526025248/https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/vaccines.html|archivedate=26 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of antibiotics in those who have been exposed, but are without symptoms.&lt;ref name=Cochrane07&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Altunaiji S, Kukuruzovic R, Curtis N, Massie J | title = Antibiotics for whooping cough (pertussis) | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 3 | pages = CD004404 | date = 2007-07-18 | pmid = 17636756 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004404.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Preventive antibiotics, however, are still frequently used in those who have been exposed and are at high risk of severe disease (such as infants).&lt;ref name=Update10/&gt;

Immunization does not confer lifelong immunity; a 2011 CDC study indicated that protection may only last three to six years.

An effect of widespread immunization on society has been the shift of reported infections from children aged 1–9 years to infants, adolescents, and adults, with adolescents and adults acting as reservoirs for ''B. pertussis'' and infecting infants who have had fewer than three doses of vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Mattoo| first = Seema| last2 = Cherry| first2 = James D.| date = 2005-04-01| title = Molecular Pathogenesis, Epidemiology, and Clinical Manifestations of Respiratory Infections Due to Bordetella pertussis and Other Bordetella Subspecies| url = http://cmr.asm.org/content/18/2/326| journal = Clin Microbiol Rev| language = en| volume = 18| issue = 2| pages = 326–382| doi = 10.1128/CMR.18.2.326-382.2005| issn = 0893-8512| pmc = 1082800| pmid = 15831828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have suggested that while acellular pertussis vaccines are effective preventing the disease, they have a limited impact on infection and transmission, meaning that vaccinated people could spread the pertussis even though they may have only mild symptoms or none at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/6/5/00-0512_article | title=Pertussis Infection in Fully Vaccinated Children in Day-Care Centers, Israel | date=October 2000 | first1=Isaac | last1=Srugo | first2=Daniel | last2=Benilevi | first3=Ralph | last3=Madeb | first4=Sara | last4=Shapiro | first5=Tamy | last5=Shohat | first6=Eli | last6=Somekh | first7=Yossi | last7=Rimmar | first8=Vladimir | last8=Gershtein | first9=Rosa | last9=Gershtein | first10=Esther | last10=Marva | first11=Nitza | last11=Lahat | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402042035/http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/6/5/00-0512_article | archivedate=2 April 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/wer/2015/wer9035.pdf |title=Pertussis Vaccines:WHO Position Paper |date=August 2015 |quote="It is plausible that in humans, as in nonhuman primates, asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections in DTaP-immunized persons may result in transmission of B. pertussis to others and may drive pertussis outbreaks." |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110610/http://www.who.int/wer/2015/wer9035.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
&lt;!-- Antibiotics --&gt;
The antibiotics [[erythromycin]], [[clarithromycin]], or [[azithromycin]] are typically the recommended treatment.&lt;ref name=Cochrane07/&gt; Newer [[macrolides]] are frequently recommended due to lower rates of side effects.&lt;ref name=Update10/&gt; [[Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]] (TMP/SMX) may be used in those with allergies to first-line agents or in infants who have a risk of [[pyloric stenosis]] from macrolides.&lt;ref name=Update10/&gt;

A reasonable guideline is to treat people age &gt;1 year within 3 weeks of cough onset and infants age &lt;1 year and pregnant women within 6 weeks of cough onset. If the person is diagnosed late, antibiotics will not alter the course of the illness, and even without antibiotics, they should no longer be spreading pertussis.&lt;ref name=Update10/&gt; When used early, antibiotics decrease the duration of infectiousness, and thus prevent spread.&lt;ref name=Update10/&gt; Short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for 3–5 days) are as effective as long-term treatment (erythromycin 10–14 days) in eliminating ''B. pertussis'' with fewer and less severe side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altunaiji|first1=S|last2=Kukuruzovic|first2=R|last3=Curtis|first3=N|last4=Massie|first4=J|title=Antibiotics for whooping cough (pertussis).|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Jul 18, 2007|issue=3|pages=CD004404|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004404.pub3|pmid=17636756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People with pertussis are infectious from the beginning of the catarrhal stage (a runny nose, sneezing, low-grade fever, symptoms of the common cold) through the third week after the onset of paroxysms (multiple, rapid coughs) or until 5 days after the start of effective antimicrobial treatment.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Before vaccines, an average of 178,171 cases was reported in the U.S., with peaks reported every two to five years; more than 93% of reported cases occurred in children under 10 years of age. The actual [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] was likely much higher. After vaccinations were introduced in the 1940s, pertussis incidence fell dramatically to approximately 1,000 by 1976. Incidence rates have increased since 1980. In 2015, rates in the United States were 20,762 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pertussis {{!}} Whooping Cough {{!}} Surveillance {{!}} Cases by Year {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/surv-reporting/cases-by-year.html|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=10 April 2017|language=en-us|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410214238/https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/surv-reporting/cases-by-year.html|archivedate=10 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pertussis is the only vaccine-preventable disease that is associated with increasing deaths in the U.S. The number of deaths increased from four in 1996 to 17 in 2001, almost all of which were infants under one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gregory DS | title = Pertussis: a disease affecting all ages | journal = Am Fam Physician | volume = 74 | issue = 3 | pages = 420–6 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16913160 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/20060801/420.html | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080516080021/http://www.aafp.org/afp/20060801/420.html | archivedate = 2008-05-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canada]], the number of pertussis infections has varied between 2,000 and 10,000 reported cases each year over the last ten years, and it is the most common vaccine-preventable illness in [[Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://chealth.canoe.ca/channel_condition_info_details.asp?disease_id=217&amp;channel_id=2026&amp;relation_id=18305&amp;rot=4 Whooping Cough – Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, Diagnosis – - C-Health&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707033910/http://chealth.canoe.ca/channel_condition_info_details.asp?disease_id=217&amp;channel_id=2026&amp;relation_id=18305&amp;rot=4 |date=2012-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of exemptions varied widely among communities, but tended to be highly clustered. In some schools, more than three-fourths of parents filed for vaccination exemptions. The data suggest vaccine refusal based on nonmedical reasons and personal belief exacerbated the outbreak. Other factors included reduced duration of immunity following the acellular vaccine and, the fact that most vaccinated adults and older children had not received a booster shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/09/25/226147147/vaccine-refusals-fueled-californias-whooping-cough-epidemic|title=Vaccine Refusals Fueled California’s Whooping Cough Epidemic|author=Shute, Nancy|publisher=NPR|date=30 September 2013|accessdate=6 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005102028/http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/09/25/226147147/vaccine-refusals-fueled-californias-whooping-cough-epidemic|archivedate=5 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24082000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Atwell JE, Van Otterloo J, Zipprich J, Winter K, Harriman K, Salmon DA, Halsey NA, Omer SB | title = Nonmedical vaccine exemptions and pertussis in California, 2010 | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 132 | issue = 4 | pages = 624–30 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24082000 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2013-0878 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Discovery ===
''B. pertussis'' was discovered in 1906 by [[Jules Bordet]] and [[Octave Gengou]], who also developed the first serology and vaccine. Efforts to develop an inactivated whole-cell vaccine began soon after ''B. pertussis'' was cultured that year. In the 1920s, [[Louis W. Sauer]] developed a weak vaccine for whooping cough at [[NorthShore University HealthSystem#Evanston Hospital|Evanston Hospital]] (Evanston, IL). In 1925 Danish physician Thorvald Madsen was the first to test a whole-cell vaccine on a wide scale.&lt;ref name="Baker_2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baker JP, Katz SL | title = Childhood vaccine development: an overview | journal = Pediatr Res | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 347–56 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14630981 | doi = 10.1203/01.PDR.0000106317.36875.6A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Madsen used the vaccine to control outbreaks in the [[Faroe Islands]] in the North Sea.

=== Vaccine ===
In 1932 an outbreak of whooping cough hit [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], prompting pediatrician [[Leila Denmark]] to begin her study of the disease. Over the next six years her work was published in the ''[[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]]'', and in partnership with [[Emory University]] and [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly &amp; Company]], she developed the first pertussis vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Changing the Face of Medicine {{!}} Dr. Leila Alice Daughtry Denmark|url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_78.html|website = www.nlm.nih.gov|access-date = 2016-02-03|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150321042123/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_78.html|archivedate = 2015-03-21|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 American scientists [[Grace Eldering]], [[Loney Gordon]], and [[Pearl Kendrick]] combined the whole-cell pertussis vaccine with [[diphtheria]] and [[tetanus]] toxoids to generate the first DTP combination vaccine.&lt;ref name="Bannink_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bannink, Jill | title = Finding aid for the Michigan women and the whooping cough vaccine collection[s] | url = http://grplpedia.grpl.org/wiki/images/6/65/328.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150205095413/http://grplpedia.grpl.org/wiki/images/6/65/328.pdf | archivedate = 2015-02-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; To minimize the frequent side effects caused by the pertussis component, Japanese scientist Yuji Sato developed an acellular vaccine consisting of purified haemagglutinins (HAs: filamentous [[strep throat]] and [[leukocytosis]]-promoting-factor HA), which are secreted by ''B. pertussis''. Sato's acellular pertussis vaccine was used in Japan starting in 1981.&lt;ref name="Sato_1984"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sato Y, Kimura M, Fukumi H | title = Development of a pertussis component vaccine in Japan | journal = The Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 8369 | pages = 122–6 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6140441 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(84)90061-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later versions of the acellular vaccine in other countries consisted of additional defined components of ''B. pertussis'' and were often part of the [[DTaP]] combination vaccine.
