The '''1994 Brussels summit''' was the 13th [[NATO summit]] bringing the leaders of member nations together at the same time.  The formal sessions and informal meetings in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] took place on 10–11 January 1994.&lt;ref name="nato1"&gt;{{cite web|title=NATO summit meetings |author=NATO |url=http://www.nato.int/issues/summits/index.html#agendas |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gWo4KcXm?url=http://www.nato.int/issues/summits/index.html |archivedate=2009-05-04 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2009-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In this period, the organization faced conventional questions about whether a new generation of leaders would be as committed to NATO as their predecessors had been,&lt;ref name="thomas101"&gt;Thomas, Ian Q.R. (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?id=mwYQSw00m8EC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=NATO+and+Brussels+summit+1974#PPA101,M1  ''The promise of alliance: NATO and the political imagination,'' p. 101.]&lt;/ref&gt; but events gave those concerns a new spin. In August 1994, NATO air strikes were ordered in an attempt to protect UN safe havens and deter the Bosnia Serbs from further aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mwYQSw00m8EC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=NATO+and+Brussels+summit+1974#PPA163,M1  p. 163.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agenda==
The general discussions focused on the reaffirmation of alliance readiness to carry out air strikes in support of UN objectives in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref name="nato1"/&gt;  Also discussed was the launching of the Partnership for Peace (PfP) initiative in which all North Atlantic Cooperation Council partner countries and members of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) were invited to participate.&lt;ref name="nato1"/&gt;

==Accomplishments==
The summit's work was followed by publication of the Partnership for Peace Framework Document.&lt;ref name="nato1"/&gt;

The summit leaders endorsed the concept of Combined Joint Task Forces (CJTFs) and other measures to develop the European Security and Defence Identity.&lt;ref name="nato1"/&gt;

The '''radiotherapy accident in Costa Rica''' occurred with the Alcyon II [[radiotherapy]] unit at San Juan de Dios Hospital in [[San José, Costa Rica]]. It was related to a [[cobalt-60]] source that was being used for radiotherapy in 1996.  An accidental overexposure of radiotherapy patients treated during August and September 1996 was detected. During the calibration process done after the change of &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co source on 22 August 1996, a mistake was made in calculating the dose rate, leading to severe overexposure of patients. The error of calibration was detected on 27 December 1997. In the course of the accident, 114 patients received an overdose of radiation and 13 died of radiation-related injuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=p6b4qDorN4wC&amp;pg=PA299 Medical management of radiation accidents] pp. 299 &amp; 303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull413/article1.pdf Strengthening the Safety of Radiation Sources] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5hO7gbe9a?url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull413/article1.pdf |date=2009-06-08 }} p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ardagh Group''' is a [[Luxembourg]]-based producer of glass and metal products that has "grown in the past two decades into one of the world’s largest metal and glass packaging companies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Robert|title=Hot market greets ‘super PIK’ bonds sold by Irish billionaire|url=https://www.ft.com/content/985507cc-f7a8-11e7-8715-e94187b3017e|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=Financial Times|date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1932 as the Irish Glass Bottle Company in [[Dublin]], the company expanded through a series of [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisitions]] after [[Paul Coulson]] acquired an initial stake in the company in 1998.&lt;ref name = "boland"/&gt; In North America, the company currently operates two of the oldest continuously operated glass container plants in the country: Dunkirk, Indiana, opened in 1889, and Winchester, Indiana, opened in 1898.

It purchased [[Rockware Glass]] in 1999. In 2011, it purchased the metal packaging company Impress Group for €1.7 billion and Fi Par for €125 million. In August 2012, the company acquired [[Anchor Hocking|Anchor Glass]] for $880 million. In January 2013, Ardagh Group agreed to acquire St-Gobain's Verallia North America for €1.3 billion. In 2012 it purchased the [[Rexam]] Glass Division.&lt;ref name = "anchor"/&gt;

The company launched an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) in March 2017 on the [[New York Stock Exchange]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Packaging conglomerate Ardagh launches long-awaited IPO in New York|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ardagh-pkg-gr-ipo/packaging-conglomerate-ardagh-launches-long-awaited-ipo-in-new-york-idUSKBN16D2RM|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=Reuters|date=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; raising just over $300 million.&lt;ref name = "boland"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boland|first1=Vincent|title=Packaging maker Ardagh raises $300m in IPO|url=https://www.ft.com/content/6443bf91-4eca-37f7-ba3c-2a87213c4a39|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=Financial Times|date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Attentat''''' is a  novel by Belgian author [[Amélie Nothomb]]. It was first published in 1997.

== Summary ==

In ''Attentat'', the novelist creates two original characters for her readers. The grotesque yet enlightened Epiphane Otos  both refined and vulnerable and  Ethel, a smart young actress, portrayed as incredibly beautiful. The story is about Epiphane's love and devotion to Ethel. It is also a pretext for discourse on the idea of [[Norm (social)|societal norms]]. Like in all books by Amélie Nothomb, literary and artistic references abound (for example Notre Dame de Paris). The use of little known vocabulary is equally an essential style trait of this novelist's work.&lt;ref&gt;(fr)[https://deslectureshumaines.wordpress.com/2012/09/06/attentat-amelie-nothomb/ deslectureshumaines]&lt;/ref&gt;

All the author's ideas support the debate she puts forward on normality. What is a norm? What is the role, involuntary or not, played by society in the elaboration of such standards? Amélie Nothomb skillfully demonstrates depictions of beauty and ugliness throughout the dialogue between Epiphane and Ethel: We are thrown by others views,  shaped by them. On a wider scale, [[Amélie Nothomb]] invites us to question our philosophies and core beliefs, through the character of Epiphane Otos. Are one's views on a given topic, fact, or idea a result of personal reflection or the absorption of a societal concept which has not yet been refuted?

Some minor oversights are present in this work. One example is where the author writes, "the square of my hypotenuse was equal to the sum of my right angles," whereas the square of the hypotenuse should be equal to the sum of the squares of the two other sides. In another quote, "it was six o'clock in the morning in Japan therefore 2pm at Ethel's" is erroneous even if it is not specified whether she lives in France or Belgium We do know however that the location is in Europe, somewhere west of Germany, thanks to a fax written by Epiphane during the journey to Japan which indicated the countries on the flight path. So the [[Time zone]] difference with Japan is not correctly calculated. In January, the month in which the action occurs, it is in fact 10pm in France or Belgium while it is already 6am the next day in Japan.

The impaling scene was inspired by a music video called [[Sans logique|Sans Logique]] by [[Mylène Farmer]] who is known to the novelist.

The '''Bank of Slovenia''' ({{lang-sl|Banka Slovenije}}) is the bank of issue and the [[central bank]] of the [[Slovenia|Republic of Slovenia]].  Based in [[Ljubljana]], it was established on 25 June 1991.  Its primary task is to take care of the stability of the domestic currency and to ensure the liquidity of payments within the country and with foreign countries.  It also acts as the supervisor of the banking system.  It is a non-governmental independent institution, obliged to periodically present a report on its operation to the [[National Assembly (Slovenia)|National Assembly of Slovenia]].

The Bank of Slovenia joined the [[Eurosystem]] in 2007, when the euro replaced the [[Slovenian tolar|tolar]] as the official currency of Slovenia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1040">The '''beer riots in Bavaria''' happened between 1 May and 5 May 1844, beginning after King [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] decreed a [[tax]] on [[beer]]. Crowds of urban workers beat up [[police]] while the [[Bavarian army]] showed reluctance to get involved. [[Civic virtue|Civil]] order was restored only after the King decreed a ten percent reduction in the price of beer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Engels]] wrote about the events for the [[Chartism|Chartist]] newspaper [[Northern Star (chartist newspaper)|''Northern Star'']], on 25 May 1844.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[Revolutions of 1848]], Ludwig I [[abdicated]] in favour of his son, [[Maximilian II of Bavaria|Maximilian II]].

Brunei is the only sovereign state completely on the island of Borneo; the remainder of the island's territory is divided between the nations of Malaysia and [[Indonesia]].

At the peak of the [[Bruneian Empire]], [[Bolkiah|Sultan Bolkiah]] (reigned 1485–1528) is alleged to have had control over most regions of [[Borneo]], including modern-day Sarawak and [[Sabah]], as well as the [[Sulu Archipelago]] off the northeast tip of Borneo, [[Seludong]] (modern-day [[Manila]]), and the islands off the northwest tip of Borneo. The [[thalassocracy|maritime state]] was visited by Spain's [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan Expedition]] in 1521 and fought against Spain in the 1578 [[Castilian War]].

During the 19th century, the Bruneian Empire began to decline. The Sultanate ceded Sarawak ([[Kuching]]) to [[James Brooke]] and installed him as the [[White Rajahs|White Rajah]], and it ceded Sabah to the British [[North Borneo Chartered Company]]. In 1888, Brunei became a [[British protected state]] and was assigned a [[Resident (title)|British resident]] as colonial manager in 1906. After the Japanese occupation during [[World War II]], in 1959 a new constitution was written. In 1962, a small [[Brunei revolt|armed rebellion]] against the monarchy was ended with the help of the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pocock |first=Tom |title=Fighting General – The Public &amp;Private Campaigns of General Sir Walter Walker |year=1973 |edition=First |publisher=Collins |location=London |isbn=0-00-211295-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brunei gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 1 January 1984. Economic growth during the 1990s and 2000s, with the GDP increasing 56% from 1999 to 2008, transformed Brunei into an industrialised country. It has developed wealth from extensive petroleum and natural gas fields. Brunei has the second-highest [[Human Development Index]] among the [[Southeast Asian]] nations, after [[Singapore]], and is classified as a "[[developed country]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Human Development Reports |publisher=United Nations |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/ |accessdate=5 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), Brunei is ranked fifth in the world by gross domestic product per capita at [[purchasing power parity]]. The IMF estimated in 2011 that Brunei was one of two countries (the other being [[Libya]]) with a public debt at 0% of the national GDP. ''[[Forbes]]'' also ranks Brunei as the fifth-richest nation out of 182, based on its petroleum and natural gas fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/02/25/forbes-ranks-brunei-fifth-richest-nation.html |title=Forbes ranks Brunei fifth richest nation |date=25 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226155809/https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/02/25/forbes-ranks-brunei-fifth-richest-nation.html |archivedate=26 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
According to local historiography, Brunei was founded by Awang Alak Betatar, later to be [[Muhammad Shah of Brunei|Sultan Muhammad Shah]], reigning around AD 1400. He moved from Garang in the [[Temburong]] District&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p= 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Brunei River]] estuary, discovering Brunei. According to legend, upon landing he exclaimed, ''Baru nah'' (loosely translated as "that's it!" or "there"), from which the name "Brunei" was derived.&lt;ref name="Vienne2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marie-Sybille de Vienne|title=Brunei: From the Age of Commerce to the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IfpIBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27|date=9 March 2015|publisher=NUS Press|isbn=978-9971-69-818-8|pages=27–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first Muslim ruler of Brunei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southeastasianarchaeology.com/2007/03/08/treasuring-bruneis-past/ |title=Treasuring Brunei's past |publisher=Southeast Asian Archaeology |date=8 March 2007 |accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the rise of the [[Bruneian Empire]] under the Muslim Bolkiah Dynasty, Brunei is believed to have been under Buddhist rulers.&lt;ref name="Nicholl1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Nicholl|title=Notes on Some Controversial Issues in Brunei History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EN-hXwAACAAJ|date=1980|pages=32–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was renamed "Barunai" in the 14th century, possibly influenced by the [[Sanskrit]] word "''{{transl|sa|varuṇ}}''" ({{lang|sa|वरुण}}), meaning "seafarers".&lt;ref name="Minahan2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=James B. Minahan|title=Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific: An Encyclopedia: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOQkpcVcd9AC&amp;pg=PT75|date=30 August 2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-660-7|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "[[Borneo]]" is of the same origin. In the country's full name, ''{{lang|ms|Negara Brunei Darussalam}}'', ''{{lang|ms|darussalam}}'' ({{lang-ar|دار السلام}}) means "abode of peace", while ''{{lang|ms|negara}}'' means "country" in [[Malay language|Malay]].

The earliest recorded documentation by the West about Brunei is by an Italian known as [[Ludovico di Varthema]], who also said the "Bruneian people have fairer skin tone than the peoples he met in [[Maluku Islands]]". On his documentation back to 1550;

== History ==
{{Main|History of Brunei}}

=== Early history ===
[[File:The Tomb of the King of Boni (Brunei) Nanjing.JPG|thumb|The [[Tomb of the King of Boni|tomb of a ruler of Po-ni]] in [[Nanjing]], [[Jiangsu]], China.]]
One of the earliest Chinese records is the 977 AD letter to Chinese emperor from the ruler of Po-ni, which some scholars believe to refer to Borneo.&lt;ref name="Hutton2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Hutton|title=Adventure Guides: East Malaysia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YWO5Va53GkgC&amp;pg=PA30|date=November 2000|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=978-962-593-180-7|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1225, a Chinese official, Chau Ju-Kua ([[Zhao Rugua]]), reported that Po-ni had 100 warships to protect its trade, and that there was a lot of wealth in the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fourteenth century, the [[Java]]nese manuscript [[Nagarakretagama]], written by [[Mpu Prapanca|Prapanca]] in 1365, mentioned ''Barune'' as the [[vassal state]] of [[Majapahit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Naskah Nagarakretagama | publisher=Perpustakaan Nasional Republik Indonesia | url=http://kelembagaan.pnri.go.id/Digital_Docs/homepage_folders/activities/highlight/naskah_nagara_kretagama/isi.htm | language=Indonesian | accessdate=13 October 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523163555/http://kelembagaan.pnri.go.id/Digital_Docs/homepage_folders/activities/highlight/naskah_nagara_kretagama/isi.htm | archive-date=23 May 2017 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which had to make an annual [[tribute]] of 40 [[catty|katis]] of [[camphor]]. In 1369, the Sulus attacked Po-ni, looting it of treasure and gold. A fleet from Majapahit succeeded in driving away the Sulus, but Po-ni was left weaker after the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Chinese report from 1371 described Po-ni as poor and totally controlled by Majapahit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, scholars claim that the power of the [[Sultanate]] of Brunei was at [[Bruneian Empire|its peak]] between the 15th and 17th centuries, with its power extending from northern Borneo to the southern Philippines.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bx.html | title=Brunei | publisher=[[CIA World Factbook]] | year=2011 | accessdate=13 January 2011 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 16th century, Islam was firmly rooted in Brunei, and the country had built one of its biggest mosques. In 1578, Alonso Beltrán, a Spanish traveller, described it as being five stories tall and built on the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nicholl|2002|pp=47–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== War with Spain and decline ===
[[File:Brunei territorial lose (1400–1890).gif|thumb|left|Brunei territorial losses from 1400 to 1890.]]
[[Colonialism|European influence]] gradually brought an end to the [[regional power]], as Brunei entered a period of decline compounded by internal strife over royal succession. Since the Spanish regarded Brunei the center of Islamic preaching in the Philippines&lt;ref name=cia /&gt; Spain [[Castille War|declared war]] in 1578, planning  to attack and capture [[Kota Batu, Brunei-Muara|Kota Batu]], Brunei's capital at the time. This was based in part on the assistance of two Bruneian [[Pengiran#Brunei|noblemen]], Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna. The former had travelled to [[Manila]], then the centre of the Spanish colony, Manila itself was captured from Brunei and Christianised, Pengiran Seri Lela came to offer Brunei as a [[tributary state|tributary]] to Spain for help to recover the throne usurped by his brother, Saiful Rijal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Melo Alip|1964|p=201,317}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish agreed that if they succeeded in conquering Brunei, Pengiran Seri Lela would be appointed as the sultan, while Pengiran Seri Ratna would be the new [[Bendahara]].

In March 1578, the Spanish fleet had arrived from Mexico and settled at the Philippines, they were led by [[Francisco de Sande|De Sande]], acting as [[Capitán-General]], he organised an expedition from Manila for Brunei. The expedition consisted of 400 Spanish, 1,500 [[Filipino people|Filipino]] natives and 300 Borneans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|United States War Dept|1903|p=379}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was one of many, which also included action in [[Mindanao]] and [[Sulu Archipelago|Sulu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McAmis|2002|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filipiniana.net/publication/letter-from-francisco-de-sande-to-felipe-ii/12791881675822|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327133109/http://www.filipiniana.net/publication/letter-from-francisco-de-sande-to-felipe-ii/12791881675822|archivedate=27 March 2012|title=Letter from Francisco de Sande to Felipe II, 1578|accessdate=17 October 2009|work=filipiniana.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish invaded the capital on 16 April 1578, with the help of Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna. The Sultan Saiful Rijal and Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Abdul Kahar were forced to flee to Meragang then to [[Jerudong]]. In Jerudong, they made plans to chase the conquering army away from Brunei. Suffering high fatalities due to a [[cholera]] or [[dysentery]] outbreak,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frankham|2008|p=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Atiyah|2002|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Spanish decided to abandon Brunei and returned to Manila on 26 June 1578, after 72 days. Before doing so, they burned the mosque, a high structure with a five-tier roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Saunders|2002|pp=54–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pengiran Seri Lela died in August or September 1578, probably from the same illness suffered by his Spanish allies. There was suspicion he could have been poisoned by the ruling sultan. Seri Lela's daughter, a Bruneian princess had left with the Spanish, she married a Christian [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]], named Agustín de Legazpi de Tondo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Saunders|2002|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local Brunei accounts&lt;ref name="History for Brunei 2009 41"&gt;{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; differ greatly from the generally accepted view of events. What was called the Castilian War was seen as a heroic episode, with the Spaniards being driven out by Bendahara Sakam, purportedly a brother of the ruling sultan, and a thousand native warriors. Most historians consider this to be a [[folk-hero]] account, which probably developed decades or centuries after.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Saunders|2002|pp=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country suffered a [[Brunei Civil War|civil war]] from 1660 to 1673.

=== British intervention ===
&lt;!--Linked from [[Template:History of Brunei]]--&gt;
{{See also|British Brunei Administrators}}
[[File:Control of the island of Borneo.png|thumb|right|Boundaries of Brunei (green) since 1890.]]
The British have intervened in the affairs of Brunei on several occasions. Britain attacked Brunei in July 1846 due to internal conflicts over who was the rightful Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1880s, the decline of the [[Bruneian Empire]] continued. The sultan granted land (now Sarawak) to [[James Brooke]], who had helped him quell a rebellion and allowed him to establish the [[Kingdom of Sarawak]]. Over time, Brooke and his nephews (who succeeded him) leased or annexed more land. Brunei lost much of its territory to him and his dynasty, known as the [[White Rajahs]].

Sultan [[Hashim Jalilul Alam Aqamaddin]] appealed to the British to stop further encroachment by the Brookes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Treaty of Protection" was negotiated by [[Sir Hugh Low]] and signed into effect on 17 September 1888. The treaty said that the sultan "could not cede or lease any territory to foreign powers without British consent"; it provided [[United Kingdom|Britain]] effective control over Brunei's external affairs, making it a [[British protected state]] (which continued until 1984).&lt;ref name=cia /&gt; But, when the Kingdom of Sarawak annexed Brunei's [[Limbang Division|Pandaruan District]] in 1890, the British did not take any action to stop it. They did not regard either Brunei or the Kingdom of Sarawak as 'foreign' (per the Treaty of Protection). This final annexation by Sarawak left Brunei with its current small land mass and separation into two parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[British resident]]s were introduced in Brunei under the Supplementary Protectorate Agreement in 1906.&lt;ref name="History for Brunei 2009 59"&gt;{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residents were to advise the sultan on all matters of administration. Over time, the resident assumed more executive control than the sultan. The residential system ended in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discovery of oil ===
Petroleum was discovered in 1929 after several fruitless attempts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two men, F. F. Marriot and T. G. Cochrane, smelled oil near the [[Seria]] river in late 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They informed a [[geophysicist]], who conducted a survey there. In 1927, gas seepages were reported in the area. Seria Well Number One (S-1) was drilled on 12 July 1928. Oil was struck at {{convert|297|m}} on 5 April 1929. Seria Well Number 2 was drilled on 19 August 1929, and, {{As of|2009|lc=y}}, continues to produce oil.&lt;ref name="History for Brunei 2009 14"&gt;{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil production was increased considerably in the 1930s with the development of more oil fields. In 1940, oil production was at more than six million barrels.&lt;ref name="History for Brunei 2009 14" /&gt; The British Malayan Petroleum Company (now [[Brunei Shell Petroleum]] Company) was formed on 22 July 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first offshore well was drilled in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Macmillan Atlas|isbn=1-4202-0995-7|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil and natural gas have been the basis of Brunei's development and wealth since the late 20th century.

=== Japanese occupation ===

{{Main|Japanese occupation of British Borneo}}
[[File:Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin (AWM P10841.001).JPG|thumb|[[Ahmad Tajuddin]], the [[List of Sultans of Brunei|27th Sultan of Brunei]], with members of his court in April 1941, eight months before the Japanese invaded Brunei.]]
The Japanese invaded Brunei on 16 December 1941, eight days after their [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the United States Navy. They landed 10,000 troops of the [[Kawaguchi Detachment]] from [[Cam Ranh Bay]] at [[Kuala Belait]]. After six days fighting, they occupied the entire country. The only Allied troops in the area were the 2nd Battalion of the [[15th Punjab Regiment]] based at [[Kuching]], Sarawak.&lt;ref&gt;"Brunei under the Japanese occupation", Rozan Yunos, ''Brunei Times'', Bandar Seri Begawan, 29 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the Japanese occupied Brunei, they made an agreement with [[Ahmad Tajuddin|Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin]] over governing the country. Inche Ibrahim (known later as Pehin Datu Perdana Menteri Dato Laila Utama Awang Haji Ibrahim), a former Secretary to the British Resident, Ernest Edgar Pengilly, was appointed [[Chief Administrative Officer]] under the Japanese Governor. The Japanese had proposed that Pengilly retain his position under their administration, but he declined. Both he and other British nationals still in Brunei were interned by the Japanese at [[Batu Lintang camp]] in Sarawak. While the British officials were under Japanese guard, Ibrahim made a point of personally shaking each one by the hand and wishing him well.&lt;ref&gt;"The Japanese Interregnum...," Graham Saunders, ''A history of Brunei'', Edition 2, illustrated, reprint, Routledge, 2002, p. 129, {{ISBN|070071698X}}, {{ISBN|9780700716982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sultan retained his throne and was given a pension and honours by the Japanese. During the later part of the occupation, he resided at Tantuya, [[Limbang]] and had little to do with the Japanese. Most of the Malay government officers were retained by the Japanese. Brunei's administration was reorganised into five prefectures, which included British [[North Borneo]]. The Prefectures included [[Miri Division|Baram]], [[Labuan]], [[Lawas]], and [[Limbang]]. Ibrahim hid numerous significant government documents from the Japanese during the occupation. Pengiran Yusuf (later YAM Pengiran Setia Negara Pengiran [[Haji Mohd Yusuf]]), along with other Bruneians, was sent to Japan for training. Although in the area the day of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]], Yusuf survived.

[[File:Japanese battleships at Brunei, Borneo, in October 1944 (NH 73090).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|Japanese battleships at Brunei in October 1944.]]
The British had anticipated a Japanese attack, but lacked the resources to defend the area because of their engagement in the war in Europe. The troops from the Punjab Regiment filled in the [[Seria]] oilfield oilwells with concrete in September 1941 to deny the Japanese their use. The remaining equipment and installations were destroyed when the [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|Japanese invaded Malaya]]. By the end of the war, 16 wells at [[Miri, Malaysia|Miri]] and Seria had been restarted, with production reaching about half the pre-war level. Coal production at [[Muara, Brunei|Muara]] was also recommenced, but with little success.
[[File:Japanese Surrender, Labuan (AWM 115989).JPG|right|thumb|upright=1.15|[[George Wootten|Major-General Wootten]] of the Australian 9th Division with [[Masao Baba|Lieutenant-General Masao Baba]] (signing) of the Japanese 37th Division at the surrender ceremony at Labuan on 10 September 1945.]]

During the occupation, the Japanese had their language taught in schools, and Government officers were required to learn Japanese. The local currency was replaced by what was to become known as [[Banana money|''duit pisang'' (banana money)]]. From 1943 hyper-inflation destroyed the currency's value and, at the end of the war, this currency was worthless. Allied attacks on shipping eventually caused trade to cease. Food and medicine fell into short supply, and the population suffered famine and disease.

The [[Brunei International Airport|airport]] runway was constructed by the Japanese during the occupation, and in 1943 Japanese naval units were based in [[Brunei Bay]] and Labuan. The naval base was destroyed by Allied bombing, but the airport runway survived. The facility was developed as a public airport. In 1944 the Allies began a bombing campaign against the occupying Japanese, which destroyed much of the town and Kuala Belait, but missed [[Kampong Ayer]].&lt;ref&gt;"Japanese occupation", ''Historical Dictionary of Brunei Darussalam'', Jatswan S. Sidhu, Edition 2, illustrated, Scarecrow Press, 2009, p. 115, {{ISBN|0810870789}}, {{ISBN|9780810870789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 June 1945, the [[Australian 9th Division]] landed at Muara under [[Battle of North Borneo|Operation Oboe Six]] to recapture Borneo from the Japanese. They were supported by American air and naval units. Brunei town was bombed extensively and recaptured after three days of heavy fighting. Many buildings were destroyed, including the Mosque. The Japanese forces in Brunei, Borneo, and Sarawak, under Lieutenant-General Masao Baba, formally surrendered at Labuan on 10 September 1945. The British Military Administration took over from the Japanese and remained until July 1946.

=== Post-World War II ===
After [[World War II]], a new government was formed in Brunei under the [[British Military Administration (Borneo)|British Military Administration]] (BMA). It consisted mainly of Australian officers and servicemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administration of Brunei was passed to the Civil Administration on 6 July 1945. The Brunei State Council was also revived that year.&lt;ref name="History for Brunei 2009 80"&gt;{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BMA was tasked to revive the Bruneian economy, which was extensively damaged by the Japanese during their occupation. They also had to put out the fires on the wells of Seria, which had been set by the Japanese prior to their defeat.&lt;ref name="History for Brunei 2009 80" /&gt;

Before 1941, the Governor of the Straits Settlements, based in Singapore, was responsible for the duties of British High Commissioner for Brunei, [[Kingdom of Sarawak|Sarawak]], and [[North Borneo]] (now [[Sabah]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[British High Commissioner]] for Brunei was the Governor of Sarawak, Sir Charles Ardon Clarke.
The Barisan Pemuda ("Youth Movement") (abbreviated as BARIP) was the first political party to be formed in Brunei, on 12 April 1946. The party intended to "preserve the sovereignty of the Sultan and the country, and to defend the rights of the [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]]".&lt;ref name="History131"&gt;{{cite book|last=A History of Brunei|title=A History of Brunei|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-7007-1698-X|page=131|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SQ4t_OJgSjAC&amp;printsec=frontcover|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; BARIP also contributed to the composition of the country's national anthem. The party was dissolved in 1948 due to inactivity.

In 1959, a new constitution was written declaring Brunei a self-governing state, while its foreign affairs, security, and defence remained the responsibility of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="US DOS" /&gt; A small [[rebellion]] erupted against the monarchy in 1962, which was suppressed with help of the UK. Known as the [[Brunei Revolt]], it contributed to the failure to create the [[North Borneo Federation]]. The rebellion partially affected Brunei's decision to opt out of the Malaysian Federation.&lt;ref name="US DOS" /&gt;

Brunei gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 1 January 1984.&lt;ref name="US DOS" /&gt; The official National Day, which celebrates the country's independence, is held by tradition on 23 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.lonelyplanet.com/brunei-darussalam/events/brunei-national-day/a/poi-fes/1152687/355846 | title = Brunei National Day | work = Lonely Planet | accessdate = 21 February 2017 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170222054402/https://www.lonelyplanet.com/brunei-darussalam/events/brunei-national-day/a/poi-fes/1152687/355846 | archivedate = 22 February 2017 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writing of the Constitution ===
In July 1953, Sultan [[Omar Ali Saifuddien III]] formed a seven-member committee named ''Tujuh Serangkai'', to find out the citizens' views regarding a written constitution for Brunei. In May 1954, the Sultan, Resident and High Commissioner met to discuss the findings of the committee. They agreed to authorise the drafting of a constitution. In March 1959 Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III led a delegation to London to discuss the proposed Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British delegation was led by Sir [[Alan Lennox-Boyd]], Secretary of State for the Colonies. The British Government later accepted the draft constitution.

On 29 September 1959, the Constitution Agreement was signed in [[Bandar Seri Begawan]]. The agreement was signed by Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III and Sir Robert Scott, the Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia.
It included the following provisions:&lt;ref name="History for Brunei 2009 59" /&gt;
* The Sultan was made the Supreme Head of State.
* Brunei was responsible for its internal administration.
* The British Government was responsible for foreign and defence affairs only.
* The post of Resident was abolished and replaced by a British High Commissioner.

Five councils were set up:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Executive Council
* [[Legislative Council of Brunei|The Legislative Council of Brunei]]
* The Privy Council
* The Council of Succession
* The State Religious Council

=== National development plans ===
A series of National Development Plans was initiated by the 28th Sultan of Brunei, [[Omar Ali Saifuddien III]].

The first was introduced in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total sum of B$100 million was approved by the Brunei State Council for the plan. E.R. Bevington, from the Colonial Office in [[Fiji]], was appointed to implement it.&lt;ref name="History Page 129"&gt;{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; A $US14 million Gas Plant was built under the plan. In 1954, survey and exploration work were undertaken by the Brunei Shell Petroleum on both offshore and onshore fields. By 1956, production reached 114,700 [[barrels per day|bpd]].

The plan also aided the development of public education. By 1958, expenditure on education totalled at $4 million.&lt;ref name="History Page 129" /&gt; Communications were improved, as new roads were built and reconstruction at Berakas Airport was completed in 1954.&lt;ref name="History for Brunei 2009 21"&gt;{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second National Development Plan was launched in 1962.&lt;ref name="History for Brunei 2009 21" /&gt; A major oil and gas field was discovered in 1963, with this discovery, [[Liquefied Natural Gas]] became important. Developments in the oil and gas sector have continued, and oil production has steadily increased since then.&lt;ref name="History for Brunei 2009 96"&gt;{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan also promoted the production of meat and eggs for consumption by citizens. The fishing industry increased its output by 25% throughout the course of the plan. The [[List of Panamax ports|deepwater port]] at [[Muara, Brunei|Muara]] was also constructed during this period. Power requirements were met, and studies were made to provide electricity to rural areas.&lt;ref name="History for Brunei 2009 96" /&gt; Efforts were made to eradicate [[malaria]], an endemic disease in the region, with the help of the [[World Health Organization]]. Malaria cases were reduced from 300 cases in 1953 to only 66 cases in 1959.&lt;ref name="History129"&gt;{{cite book|last=A History of Brunei|title=A History of Brunei|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-7007-1698-X|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SQ4t_OJgSjAC&amp;printsec=frontcover|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death rate was reduced from 20 per thousand in 1947 to 11.3 per thousand in 1953.&lt;ref name="History129" /&gt; Infectious disease has been prevented by public sanitation and improvement of drainage, and the provision of piped pure water to the population.&lt;ref name="History129" /&gt;

=== Independence ===
On 14 November 1971, Sultan [[Hassanal Bolkiah]] left for London to discuss matters regarding the amendments to the 1959 constitution. A new agreement was signed on 23 November 1971 with the British representative being [[Anthony Royle, Baron Fanshawe of Richmond|Anthony Royle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ministry of Education, Brunei|first=|title=History for Brunei Darussalam|year=2008|publisher=EBP Pan Pacific|isbn=9991725458|page=101|chapter=The Nation Building Years 150–1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this agreement, the following terms were agreed upon:
* Brunei was granted full internal self-government
* The UK would still be responsible for external affairs and defence.
* Brunei and the UK agreed to share the responsibility for security and defence.

This agreement also caused [[British Military Garrison Brunei|Gurkha units]] to be deployed in Brunei, where they remain up to this day.

On 7 January 1979, another treaty was signed between Brunei and the UK. It was signed with Lord Goronwy-Roberts being the representative of the UK. This agreement granted Brunei to take over international responsibilities as an independent nation. Britain agreed to assist Brunei in diplomatic matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ministry of Education, Brunei|first=|title=History for Brunei Darussalam|year=2008|publisher=EBP Pan Pacific|isbn=9991725458|page=102|chapter=The Nation Building Years 150–1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1983, it was announced by the UK that the date of independence of Brunei would be 1 January 1984.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

On 31 December 1983, a mass gathering was held on main mosques on all four of the districts of the country and at midnight, on 1 January 1984, the Proclamation of Independence was read by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah. The sultan subsequently assumed the title "[[Majesty|His Majesty]]", rather than the previous "[[His Royal Highness]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/home_news/2009/01/01/reminiscing_bruneis_independence_proclamation|title=Reminiscing Brunei's independence proclamation|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Brunei Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321195012/http://bt.com.bn/home_news/2009/01/01/reminiscing_bruneis_independence_proclamation|archive-date=21 March 2016|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunei was [[Member states of the United Nations|admitted to the United Nations]] on 22 September 1984, becoming the organisation's 159th member.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/22/world/brunei-is-greeted-as-the-159th-un-member.html BRUNEI IS GREETED AS THE 159TH U.N.

In October 2013, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah announced his intention to impose [[Penal Code]] from the Sharia law on the country's Muslims, which make up roughly two thirds of the country's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Brunei's sultan to implement Sharia penal code|url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/10/22/brunei-sharia-law/3162127/|website = USA TODAY|accessdate = 6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be implemented in three phases, culminating in 2016, and making Brunei the first and only country in East Asia to introduce Sharia law into its penal code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Implications of Brunei’s Sharia Law|url = http://thediplomat.com/2015/05/the-implications-of-bruneis-sharia-law/|website = The Diplomat|accessdate = 6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move attracted international criticism,&lt;ref name="MSNBC_2014-05-07"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Brunei's Sharia law creates backlash in Beverly Hills | last = McNew | first = David | website = [[MSNBC]] | date = 7 May 2014 | accessdate = 12 June 2016 | url = http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/la-protests-bruneis-death-stoning-law }}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Nations expressing "deep concern".&lt;ref name="BBC-27216798"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Brunei introduces tough Islamic penal code | website = [[BBC News]] | date = 30 April 2014 | accessdate = 12 June 2016 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-27216798 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Brunei}}
Brunei is a southeast Asian country consisting of two unconnected parts with a total area of {{convert|5765|km2|sqmi|0}} on the island of Borneo. It has {{convert|161|km|mi|0}} of coastline next to the [[South China Sea]], and it shares a {{convert|381|km|abbr=on}} border with Malaysia. It has {{convert|500|km2|sqmi|0}} of territorial waters, and a {{convert|200|nmi|adj=on}} [[exclusive economic zone]].&lt;ref name="cia" /&gt;

About 97% of the population lives in the larger western part ([[Belait District|Belait]], [[Tutong District|Tutong]], and [[Brunei and Muara|Brunei-Muara]]), while only about 10,000 people live in the mountainous eastern part ([[Temburong District]]). The total population of Brunei is approximately 408,000 {{As of|July 2010|lc=y}}, of which around 150,000 live in the capital [[Bandar Seri Begawan]].&lt;ref&gt;2001 Summary Tables of the Population Census.

== Politics and government ==
{{Main|Politics of Brunei}}
[[File:Hassanal Bolkiah.jpg|thumb|[[Hassanal Bolkiah]], [[Sultan of Brunei]].]]
Brunei's political system is governed by the constitution and the national tradition of the Malay Islamic Monarchy, the concept of ''[[Melayu Islam Beraja]]'' (MIB). The three components of MIB cover Malay culture, Islamic religion, and the political framework under the monarchy.&lt;ref name="bruneipress.com.bn" /&gt; It has a legal system based on [[English common law]], although Islamic [[shariah law]] supersedes this in some cases.&lt;ref name=cia /&gt; Brunei [[Legislative Council of Brunei|has a parliament]] but there are no elections; the last election was held in [[Brunei Revolt|1962]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/brunei-darussalam/constitution-politics#sthash.ij6FNXxq.dpuf|title=Brunei Darussalam : Constitution and politics|website=thecommonwealth.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Brunei's 1959 constitution, [[His Majesty Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzaddin Waddaulah]] is the [[head of state]] with full executive authority. Since [[Brunei Revolt|1962]], this authority has included emergency powers, which are renewed every two years. Brunei has technically been under [[martial law]] since the [[Brunei Revolt]] of 1962.&lt;ref name="US DOS" /&gt; [[Hassanal Bolkiah]] also serves as the state's Prime Minister, [[Finance Minister]] and [[Defence Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=PMO Organisation Chart|title=Organisation Chart at the Prime Minister's Office|url=http://pmo.gov.bn|accessdate=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal family retains a venerated status within Brunei.&lt;ref name="US DOS" /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2015}}

Until 1979, Brunei's foreign relations were managed by the UK government. After that, they were handled by the Brunei Diplomatic Service. After independence in 1984, this Service was upgraded to ministerial level and is now known as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mofat.gov.bn/index.php/the-ministry/about-us |title=About Us |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=20 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017191316/https://www.mofat.gov.bn/index.php/the-ministry/about-us |archivedate=17 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With its traditional ties with the United Kingdom, Brunei became the 49th member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] immediately on the day of its independence on 1 January 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mfa.gov.bn/foreignpolicy/commonwealth.htm| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128232720/http://www.mfa.gov.bn/foreignpolicy/commonwealth.htm| archivedate=28 January 2010 |title=MOFAT, Commonwealth| date=30 March 2010| publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Brunei Darussalam}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of its first initiatives toward improved regional relations, Brunei joined [[ASEAN]] on 7 January 1984, becoming the sixth member. To achieve recognition of its sovereignty and independence,  it joined the [[United Nations]] as a full member on 21 September of that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080218170858/http://www.mfa.gov.bn/foreignpolicy/unitednation.htm |archivedate=18 February 2008 |title= MOFAT, UN |date=30 March 2010 |publisher= Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Brunei Darussalam |url= http://www.mfa.gov.bn/foreignpolicy/unitednation.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an Islamic country, Brunei became a full member of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (now the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]]) in January 1984 at the Fourth Islamic Summit held in [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mfa.gov.bn/foreignpolicy/oic.htm |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080618090110/http://www.mfa.gov.bn/foreignpolicy/oic.htm| archivedate= 18 June 2008 |title=MOFAT, OIC| date=30 March 2010 |publisher= Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Brunei Darussalam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its accession to the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] forum (APEC) in 1989, Brunei hosted the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in November 2000 and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in July 2002.&lt;ref name="APEC_2000"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.apec.org/apec/leaders__declarations/2000.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100321170443/http://www.apec.org/apec/leaders__declarations/2000.html| archivedate=21 March 2010 | title=APEC, 2000 Leaders' Declaration| date=30 March 2010| publisher=Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunei became a founding member of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) on 1 January 1995,&lt;ref name="WTO_2008"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mfa.gov.bn/economytrade/wto.htm| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625053100/http://www.mfa.gov.bn/economytrade/wto.htm| archivedate=25 June 2008 | title=MOFAT, WTO| date=30 March 2010| publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a major player in [[BIMP-EAGA]], which was formed during the Inaugural Ministers' Meeting in [[Davao City|Davao]], [[Philippines]], on 24 March 1994.&lt;ref name="BIMP_1994"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mfa.gov.bn/economytrade/bimpeaga.htm| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621071516/http://www.mfa.gov.bn/economytrade/bimpeaga.htm| archivedate=21 June 2008 | title=MOFAT, BIMP-EAGA| date=30 March 2010| publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brunei shares a close relationship with [[Singapore]] and the Philippines. In April 2009, Brunei and the Philippines signed a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] (MOU) that seeks to strengthen the bilateral co-operation of the two countries in the fields of agriculture and farm-related trade and investments.&lt;ref&gt;Marvyn N.

The national [[flag carrier|air carrier]], [[Royal Brunei Airlines]], is trying to develop Brunei as a modest hub for international travel between Europe and Australia/New Zealand. Central to this strategy is the position that the airline maintains at London Heathrow Airport. It holds a daily slot at the highly capacity-controlled airport, which it serves from Bandar Seri Begawan via Dubai. The airline also has services to major Asian destinations including Shanghai, Bangkok, Singapore and Manila.

Brunei depends heavily on imports such as agricultural products (e.g. rice, [[convenience food|food products]], livestock, etc.),&lt;ref name="agriculture brunei"&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Agriculture, Brunei Darussalam|url=http://www.agriculture.gov.bn/|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[automobile|motorcars]] and [[consumer electronics|electrical products]] from other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brunei Statistical Year Book|year=2010|publisher=Brunei Government|page=5|url=http://www.depd.gov.bn/SI/BDSYB2010/BDSYB%202010.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307205335/http://www.depd.gov.bn/SI/BDSYB2010/BDSYB%202010.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunei imports 60% of its food requirements; of that amount, around 75% come from the ASEAN countries.&lt;ref name="agriculture brunei" /&gt;

Brunei's leaders are very concerned that steadily increased integration in the world economy will undermine internal [[social cohesion]]. But, it has become a more prominent player by serving as chairman for the 2000 [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) forum.

=== Languages ===
{{Main|Languages of Brunei}}
The official language of Brunei is [[Malay language|Standard Malay]], for which both the [[Latin alphabet]] and the [[Arabic alphabet]] are used. The local dialect, [[Melayu Brunei]] (Brunei Malay), is the most widely spoken language.

[[English Language|English]] is widely used as a business and official language and it is spoken by a majority of the [[Demographics of Brunei|population in Brunei]].

The [[Ethnic Chinese in Brunei|Chinese minority]] in Brunei speak a number of [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]].

[[Arabic language|Arabic]] (عربي) is the religious language of [[Muslim]]s. Therefore, Arabic is taught in schools, particularly religious schools, and also in institutes of higher learning. As of 2004, there are six Arabic schools and one religious teachers' college in Brunei. A majority of Brunei's Muslim population has had some form of formal or informal education in the reading, writing and pronunciation of the [[Arabic language]] as part of their religious education.

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Brunei}}
[[File:Royal Regalie (1).JPG|thumb|right|Royal Regalia Museum]]
The culture of Brunei is predominantly [[Malay people|Malay]] (reflecting its ethnicity), with heavy influences from [[Islam]], but is seen as much more conservative than [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of religious freedom, see [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71334.htm Brunei]. International Religious Freedom Report 2006, United States Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt; Influences to Bruneian culture come from the Malay cultures of the [[Malay Archipelago]]. Four periods of cultural influence have occurred, animist, [[Hindu]], Islamic, and Western. Islam had a very strong influence, and was adopted as Brunei's ideology and philosophy. Brunei's official main language is [[Malay language|Malay]] but English is also widely spoken as it is a compulsory subject in the majority of the schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110511082403/http://www.jpm.gov.bn/pmo1/index.php?view=article&amp;id=185%3Alanguage-and-culture&amp;format=pdf&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=209 Language and Culture]. jpm.gov.bn (28 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has been given "Not Free" status by [[Freedom House]]; press criticism of the government and monarchy is rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/inc/content/pubs/pfs/inc_country_detail.cfm?country=6929&amp;year=2007&amp;pf|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080511080900/http://www.freedomhouse.org/inc/content/pubs/pfs/inc_country_detail.cfm?country=6929&amp;year=2007&amp;pf|archivedate=11 May 2008|title=Freedom of the Press – Brunei (2006) |publisher=Freedomhouse.org|accessdate=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the press is not overtly hostile toward alternative viewpoints and is not restricted to publishing only articles regarding the government. The government allowed a printing and publishing company, Brunei Press PLC, to form in 1953. The company continues to print the English daily ''[[Borneo Bulletin]]''. This paper began as a weekly community paper and became a daily in 1990&lt;ref name="bruneipress.com.bn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bruneipress.com.bn/brunei/brunei.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020623025316/http://www.bruneipress.com.bn/brunei/brunei.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 June 2002 |title=About Brunei |publisher=Bruneipress.com.bn |date=30 July 1998 |accessdate=23 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from The ''Borneo Bulletin'', there is also the ''[[Media Permata]]'' and Pelita Brunei, the local Malay newspapers which are circulated daily. ''[[The Brunei Times]]'' is another English independent newspaper published in Brunei since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brunei Times Website|url=http://bt.com.bn/|accessdate=15 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213020954/http://www.bt.com.bn/|archivedate=13 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brunei government owns and operates six television channels with the introduction of digital TV using DVB-T (RTB 1, RTB 2, RTB 3 (HD), RTB 4, RTB 5 and RTB New Media (Game portal)) and five radio stations (National FM, Pilihan FM, Nur Islam FM, Harmony FM and Pelangi FM). A private company has made cable television available (Astro-Kristal) as well as one private radio station, Kristal FM.&lt;ref name="bruneipress.com.bn" /&gt;
It also has an online campus radio station, ''[[UBD FM]]'' that streams from its first university, [[Universiti Brunei Darussalam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UBD Radio Website|title=UBD Radio|url=http://www.ubdfm.blogspot.com/|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sport===
The most popular sport in Brunei is [[association football]]. The [[Brunei national football team]] joined [[FIFA]] in 1969, but has not had much success. The top two football leagues are the [[Brunei Super League]] and the [[Brunei Premier League]].

Brunei debuted [[Brunei at the Olympics|at the Olympics]] in 1996; it has competed at all subsequent [[Summer Olympics]] except 2008. The country has competed in badminton, shooting, swimming, and track-and-field, but is yet to win any medals. Brunei has had slightly more success [[Brunei at the Asian Games|at the Asian Games]], winning four bronze medals. The first major international sporting event to be hosted in Brunei was the [[1999 Southeast Asian Games]]. According to the [[all-time Southeast Asian Games medal table]], Bruneian athletes have won a total of 11 gold medals at the games; only [[East Timor]] has won fewer.

== Legal system ==
Brunei has numerous courts in its judicial branch. The highest court is the Supreme Court, which consists of the Court of Appeal and High Court. Both of these have a chief justice and two judges.&lt;ref name=cia /&gt;

=== Women and children ===
{{Main|Women in Brunei}}
The U.S. Department of State has stated that discrimination against women is a problem in Brunei.&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eap/154379.htm 2010 Human Rights Report: Brunei Darussalam]. US Department of State&lt;/ref&gt; The law prohibits sexual harassment and stipulates that whoever assaults or uses criminal force, intending thereby to outrage or knowing it is likely to outrage the modesty of a person, shall be punished with imprisonment for as much as five years and [[caning]]. The law stipulates imprisonment of up to 30 years, and caning with not fewer than 12 strokes for rape. The law does not criminalise spousal rape; it explicitly states that sexual intercourse by a man with his wife, as long as she is not under 13 years of age, is not rape. Protections against sexual assault by a spouse are provided under the amended Islamic Family Law Order 2010 and Married Women Act Order 2010. The penalty for breaching a protection order is a fine not exceeding BN$2,000 ($1,538) or imprisonment not exceeding six months.

Citizenship is derived through one's parents rather than through birth within the country's territory. Parents with stateless status are required to apply for a special pass for a child born in the country; failure to register a child may make it difficult to enroll the child in school. By law, sexual intercourse with a female under 14 years of age constitutes rape and is punishable by imprisonment for not less than eight years and not more than 30 years and not less than 12 strokes of the cane. The intent of the law is to protect girls from exploitation through prostitution and "other immoral purposes", including pornography.&lt;ref name="state.gov" /&gt;

=== Human rights ===
{{Main|Freedom of religion in Brunei|LGBT rights in Brunei}}
Brunei's revised penal code came into force on 22 April 2014, stipulating the [[death penalty]] for numerous offenses (both violent and non-violent), such as insult or defamation of [[Muhammad]], insulting any verses of the Quran and Hadith, [[blasphemy]], declaring oneself a prophet or non-Muslim, robbery, rape, adultery, sodomy, extramarital sexual relations for Muslims, and murder. Stoning to death was the specified "method of execution for crimes of a sexual nature". Rupert Colville, spokesperson for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) declared that, "Application of the death penalty for such a broad range of offences contravenes international law."&lt;ref name="UN_2014"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47552 |title=UN concerned at broad application of death penalty in Brunei’s revised penal code |date=11 April 2014 |accessdate=5 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male and female [[homosexuality]] is [[LGBT rights in Brunei|illegal in Brunei]]. The country passed a law that came into force on 22 April 2014, allowing the death penalty to be administered by [[stoning]] for homosexual acts, such as sexual intercourse, given there is enough evidence pointing to the action (i.e. with four trusted, impartial, and truthful witnesses in attendance). It has been acknowledged as a crime in Brunei with the introduction of the [[Sharia]] law.&lt;ref name="MV_media_2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muslimvillage.com/2014/04/20/52563/brunei-sultan-institutes-death-penalty-for-homosexuality/|title=Brunei: Sultan institutes death penalty for homosexuality|author=[http://muslimvillage.com/author/mv-media/ MV Media]|publisher=Muslim Village|date=20 April 2014|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law also stipulates that adultery is to be punished with death by stoning given there is enough evidence pointing to the action (i.e. with four trusted, impartial, and truthful witnesses in attendance). Without four qualified witnesses, there will be no stoning.&lt;ref name="BTsyariah"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/frontpage/2013/10/23/hm-approves-introduction-syariah-penal-codeto-be-implemented-phases-law-will|title=HM approves introduction of Syariah Penal Code|last=Bandial|first=Qaratul-Ain|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=31 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231202855/http://www.bt.com.bn/frontpage/2013/10/23/hm-approves-introduction-syariah-penal-codeto-be-implemented-phases-law-will|archivedate=31 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2018|October|}}, there were no cases within the Sharia Penal Code that would entail the death penalty without four qualified witnesses.&lt;ref name="BTsyariah" /&gt;

=== Religious rights ===

Upon adopting sharia, the Sultan banned [[Christmas]] decorations in public places such as shopping malls, believing that it might interfere with the practice of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/minister-brunei-unfairly-hurt-by-unverified-news-on-christmas-ban|title=Minister: Brunei unfairly hurt by unverified news on Christmas ban|date=26 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, local and foreign Christians are still allowed to celebrate Christmas as usual. On 25 December 2015, 4,000 out of 18,000 estimated local Catholics attended the mass of Christmas Day and Christmas Eve.&lt;ref name="m.bt.com.bn"&gt;[http://m.bt.com.bn/news-national/2015/12/26/christians-celebratex%E2%80%99mas-brunei Christians celebrate X'mas in Brunei | The Brunei Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231202905/http://m.bt.com.bn/news-national/2015/12/26/christians-celebratex%E2%80%99mas-brunei |date=31 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"To be quite honest there has been no change for us this year; no new restrictions have been laid down, although we fully respect and adhere to the existing regulations that our celebrations and worship be [confined] to the compounds of the church and private residences", according to [[Bishop Cornelius Sim]], head of the Catholic Church in Brunei.&lt;ref name="m.bt.com.bn" /&gt;

=== Animal rights ===

Brunei is the first country in Asia to have banned shark finning nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildaid.org/news/brunei-institutes-asia%E2%80%99s-first-nationwide-shark-fin-ban|title=Brunei Institutes Asia's First Nationwide Shark Fin Ban|publisher=WildAid|accessdate=31 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015203319/http://www.wildaid.org/news/brunei-institutes-asia%E2%80%99s-first-nationwide-shark-fin-ban|archivedate=15 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brunei has retained most of its forests, compared to its neighbours that share [[Borneo]] island. There is a public campaign calling to protect [[pangolin]]s which are considered ''threatened treasure'' in Brunei.&lt;ref name=Hii2015&gt;{{cite news |last=Hii |first=Robert |title=Saving Pangolins From Extinction: Brunei |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-hii/saving-pangolins-from-extinction_b_6835202.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Candidatus rerum politicarum''' (male), '''Candidata rerum politicarum''' (female), abbreviated '''cand.polit.''', is an [[academic degree]] in [[economics]] in [[Denmark]] and formerly an academic degree in all [[social science]]s in [[Norway]], including for example economics, [[psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[political science]].

==Denmark==
In Denmark, cand.polit. refers exclusively to the candidate's degree in economics awarded by the [[University of Copenhagen]]. Economics degrees from other Danish universities are known as ''cand. oecon''.

==Norway==
In Norway, the cand.polit. was prior to 2003–2008 awarded in all [[social sciences]] by the faculties of social science at the universities, nominally requiring at least six years of study, although many students used somewhat longer time.

After the "[[Quality Reform]]" it has been replaced by a [[Master of Philosophy]] degree, shortening the nominal study time from six to five years. The cand.polit. degree was at the time of its abolition in practice a two-year or a two-and-a-half-year&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sv.uio.no/english/academics/degrees/candpolit.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112070548/http://www.sv.uio.no/english/academics/degrees/candpolit.html |date=November 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; extension to the four-year [[cand.mag.]] degree or equivalent qualifications.

[[File:Hotel Chez Lando.jpg|thumb|Hotel Chez Lando]]
'''Chez Lando''' is a hotel and restaurant located in the [[Rwanda]]n capital city, [[Kigali]]. The hotel was founded in the 1980s by prominent Rwandan businessman and politician [[Lando Ndasingwa]], and his Canadian wife Hélène,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.focus.rw/wp/2016/07/chez-lando-fire-causes-minimal-damage/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022083841/http://www.focus.rw/wp/2016/07/chez-lando-fire-causes-minimal-damage/# |archive-date=2016-10-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who were both killed in the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]]. Following Ndasingwa's death, the hotel was taken over by his sister [[Anne-Marie Kantengwa]], who was a 2013 student on the [[Institute for Economic Empowerment of Women|IEEW]]'s Peace Through Business program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieew.org/2013-ptb-students/anne-marie-kantengwa|title=the Institute for Economic Empowerment of Women – Anne-Marie Kantengwa|website=Ieew.org|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1913">The '''Civil Guard Association for a Better Future''' ({{lang-hu|Szebb Jövőért Polgárőr Egyesület}}) is a Hungarian militant organisation involved in [[Anti-Romanyism|anti-Roma]] activities in areas such as the town of Gyöngyöspata in early 2011, where they have been accused of intimidating the Roma population with weapons and dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/2011/03/18/hungarian-government-urged-to-protect-roma-from-harassment-and-intimidation/ |title=Hungarian Government Urged To Protect Roma From Harassment and Intimidation |publisher=Human Rights First |date=2011-03-18 |accessdate=2011-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408060423/http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/2011/03/18/hungarian-government-urged-to-protect-roma-from-harassment-and-intimidation/ |archivedate=2011-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name originates from ''Szebb jövőt!'', the regular greeting of the [[Levente (organization)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepress-freespeech.com/holhome/kiscikk0/levente.htm |title=NÉHÁNY SZÓ A LEVENTEINTÉZMÉNYRŐL HUNNIA 115. szám |publisher=freepress-freespeech.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Roma Rights Centre]] has claimed that the Civil Guard has ties to the Magyar Nemzeti Gárda, a new group sharing the same ideology as the banned [[Magyar Gárda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.errc.org/cms/upload/file/hungary-gy%C3%B6ngy%C3%B6spata-letter-march-2011.pdf |title=ERCC |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Delo''''' ({{lang-ru|Дело}}) is a Russian daily business newspaper in [[Ukraine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ukrainian newspapers and magazines|url=http://www.pecob.eu/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/EN/IDPagina/1287|work=PECOP|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; belonging to Ekonomika, a joint-venture of [[Handelsblatt]] Publishing Group, Germany, one [[Czech Republic|Czech]] and two young Ukrainian publishers. The newspaper started in October 2005 as the first independent business daily of Ukraine. Its competitors are the Russian newspaper ''[[Kommersant]]'' and ''Ekonomicheskie Izvestia'', which belongs to ISD - [[Industrial Union of Donbas]]. 

''Delo'' is the first daily in Ukraine, publishing its real print circulation (13.000 - 15.000) and trying to introduce Western editorial and business standards into the rather post-soviet environment.

The '''[[district]]s of [[Peru]]''' ({{Lang-es|distritos}}) are the third-level [[country subdivision]]s of [[Peru]]. They are subdivisions of the [[provinces of Peru|provinces]], which in turn are subdivisions of the larger [[regions of Peru|regions]] or departments. There are 1,838 districts in total.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnd.gob.pe/ Sistema Nacional de Estadística] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321045616/http://www.cnd.gob.pe/ |date=2007-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
A 1982 law requires a minimum of residents in an area for a new district to be legally established: 3,500 if it is located in the [[rainforest]], 4,000 in the [[Andes]] highlands and 10,000 in the [[Chala|coast]]al area.

In the dry Andean area, many districts have less than 3,500 inhabitants due to low [[population density]] in the area. In some cases, their populations have decreased in comparison to the days when they were founded. Districts that are located at very high altitudes tend to be scarcely populated. These districts usually are large in area, have few available land for use. Many basic government services do not reach all residents of these districts due to their difficult geography. Many lack financial means to govern their whole jurisdictions and they often have high [[emigration]] rates.

A similar pattern can be observed in many districts located in the Peruvian [[Amazon rainforest]]. Once important settlements created during the era of [[colonization]], they nowadays do not offer much space for agriculture. Deeper into the jungle, the districts of the 'selva alta' ([[Omagua|lower jungle]]) have higher populations living on geographically large districts. Districts located outside the colonized area have very low populations that are entirely composed of Native Amazonian tribes.

All over the country, many districts have higher populations than the minimum required by law. This is true of the colonized areas of the rainforest, the northern Andes as well as in the southern Andes from [[Huancayo]] to the shores of [[Lake Titicaca]], which is the historical heartland of the Peruvian highlands. These districts are old and tend to be smaller in area with high population densities since [[prehispanic]] times.

Districts in the [[Chala]] (coastal area) tend to be mid-sized except in low-density areas such as the [[Sechura Desert]] and part of the Southern coast, but all of them feature large populations due to emigration from other regions of the country that turned the Peruvian coast into the country's main economic powerhouse.

Districts with a population of more than 10 000 inhabitants should ideally be subdivided, particularly if they are also large in area, as is the case in part of the Amazon rainforest. Colonization happens quickly and boundaries of districts are often not modified, except in large [[urban area|urban]] areas. This is less of a problem in the coast where communication is easier. However, reaching to large populations remain a problem in this area.&lt;ref name="ineibid"&gt;{{es icon}} [[Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática]].

Prior to its uniform adoption of [[proportional representation]] in 1999, the [[United Kingdom]] used [[plurality voting system|first-past-the-post]] for the [[Elections in the European Union|European elections]] in [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]]. The [[European Parliament constituency|European Parliament constituencies]] used under that system were smaller than the later regional constituencies and only had one [[Member of the European Parliament]] each.

The constituency of '''East Sussex and Kent South''' was one of them.

It consisted of the [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|Westminster Parliament constituencies]] of [[Bexhill and Battle (UK Parliament constituency)|Bexhill and Battle]], [[Eastbourne (UK Parliament constituency)|Eastbourne]], [[Hastings and Rye (UK Parliament constituency)|Hastings and Rye]], [[Lewes (UK Parliament constituency)|Lewes]], [[Sevenoaks (UK Parliament constituency)|Sevenoaks]], [[Tunbridge Wells (UK Parliament constituency)|Tunbridge Wells]], and [[Wealden (UK Parliament constituency)|Wealden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/ |title=David Boothroyd's United Kingdom Election Results |accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jack Stewart-Clark]] of the Conservatives was the MEP for the constituency's entire existence; he had previously represented the old constituency of [[Sussex East (European Parliament constituency)|Sussex East]] since 1979.

"'''Ellada, Hora Tou Fotos'''" ([[Greek alphabet|Greek]]: Ελλάδα, χώρα του φωτός, [[English language|English]]: "Greece, Country of Light") is a song by [[Greece|Greek]] pop singer [[Katy Garbi|Katerina Garbi]]. It was [[Greece]]'s entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1993]], and a single from Garbi's fifth solo album ''[[Os Ton Paradeiso]]''. Ellada, Hora Tou Fotos was the first CD single to ever be commercially released in Greece, beginning a new trend in the way Greek artists would release 1-5 tracks to the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tovima.gr/relatedarticles/article/?aid=124792|title=Τα 45άρια των λέιζερ|publisher=''To Vima Newspaper''|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==At Eurovision==
The song was performed sixth on the night, following [[Denmark]]'s [[Tommy Seebach|Tommy Seebach Band]] with "[[Under stjernerne på himlen]]" and preceding [[Belgium]]'s [[Barbara Dex]] with "[[Iemand als jij]]". At the close of voting, it had received 64 points, placing 9th in a field of 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/index/main?page=66&amp;event=235|title=History by Year - Eurovision Song Contest 1993|publisher=''Eurovision.tv ([[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]])''|accessdate=2008-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song is in fact a praise of Greece itself, with Garbi singing about its great intellectual and cultural heritage, despite criticizing the country's inability to transform and develop and emphasizing on the great need for a change. It is thus considered partly a political and social criticism song.  It was succeeded as [[Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest|Greek representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|1994 Contest]] by [[Costas Bigalis]] &amp; [[The Sea Lovers]] with "[[To Trehandiri]]".

'''Eurosinkut''' (abbreviated '''*es''') is a free-form community for [[Finland|Finnish]] single people. It organises many kinds of activities all around [[Finland]].

Eurosinkut was founded in [[Helsinki]] in 1997. It is not an officially registered organisation, and does not have a specific governing board or structure. The community views its free form as a benefit: no [[bureaucracy]], no government facilities, no annual meetings, no official protocol...

Eurosinkut accepts all Finnish single people as its members, and becoming a member is as simple as filling in a form on the community [[web site]]. Membership is free of charge. The Eurosinkut [[mailing list]] currently has about 5000 addresses (as of November 2006). The age range is between 16 and 70 years, and there are members from all over Finland.

==Events==
There are over 1000 events every year. Most events gather from 10 to 30 participants, but the most popular events can draw over 300.

Any member of Eurosinkut can organise an event, in any topic he/she wishes. The costs of the event are paid by the participants themselves, and participation is open to anyone interested.

The range of events is large: single parties, [[speed dating]], [[movie]]s, [[theatre]], sähly (Finnish floorball), [[pesäpallo]], [[bar (establishment)|bar]] evenings, walking trips, wandering trips, [[dancing]], [[bicycle]] trips, [[literature]], [[sailing]], [[horse riding]], cruises, "little Christmas" parties, [[Midsummer]] parties, [[Halloween]] parties...

The community maintains an [[Internet forum]] for discussion of events and other things.

The Eurosinkut community informs its members through its web site and mailing list.

==Additional information==
Getting rid of single status, or being paired, is not the single main purpose of Eurosinkut. Instead, the idea is for members to find new friends among each other, to participate in all kinds of events together. If a member finds another member that he/she likes to be in company with, the community has served its purpose.

Also, being single is not an absolute requirement for membership. (Ex-)singles who have later been paired can also participate in the community: they are called the R (=romance) club.

The '''flag of the [[Isle of Man]]''' or '''flag of Mann''' ({{lang-gv|brattagh Vannin}}) is a [[triskelion]], composed of three armoured legs with golden spurs, upon a red background. It has been the official flag of Mann since 1 December 1932&lt;ref&gt;Isle of Man Weekly Times, 3 December 1932&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on the [[Coat of arms of the Isle of Man|Manx coat of arms]], which dates back to the 13th century. The three legs are known in Manx as ''{{lang|gv|ny tree cassyn}}'' ("the three legs"). The triskelion is an ancient symbol, used by the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaeans]] and the [[Lycia]]ns. It is not known for certain why the symbol was originally adopted on the Isle of Man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/history/legs.htm|title=The Three Legs of Man|work=isle-of-man.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before its adoption in 1932, the official flag of the Isle of Man was the [[Union Jack]].

There is also a [[civil ensign]] for the Isle of Man. This flag was first authorised on 27 August 1971.&lt;ref name="fotw" /&gt; Another Manx flag is the flag of [[Tynwald]], the legislature of the Isle of Man, which has flown outside the Legislative Buildings since 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iomguide.com/manxflags.php|title=Isle of Man Guide – GOVERNMENT, Manx Flags|first=Maxima Systems|last=Ltd.|work=iomguide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Halfpenny Rose Red''', first issued on 1 October 1870, was the first [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]] [[postage stamp]] issued in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. 

The halfpenny stamp was introduced following a reduction in the postal rate for newspapers and postcards. It was designed to be approximately half the size of the corresponding one penny stamp and is notable for being the smallest UK postage stamp ever issued at {{cvt|17.5|x|14|mm}}.&lt;ref name=Guinness&gt;{{cite book|date=1 September 1988|author=James MacKay|isbn=0851123511|title=The Guinness Book of Stamps Facts &amp; Feats|publisher=Guinness}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The stamps  (nicknamed 'Bantams' due to their small size) were printed in sheets of 480 (20 horizontal rows of 24 stamps). They were line engraved and featured a bust of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|
Queen Victoria]] in profile with '½d' on either side.  

A plate number was engraved in the design, in the left and right side lace work. The plates were numbered from 1 to 20, but plates 2, 7, 16, 17, and 18 were not completed, plates 21 and 22 were not used and plate 9 is now scarce because it was a rarely used reserve plate. The stamps were watermarked with the word "halfpenny" that extended across three stamps.&lt;ref name=Gibbons&gt;[[Stanley Gibbons Ltd]], ''Specialised Stamp Catalogue Volume 1: Queen Victoria''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pennyreds&gt;[http://pennyreds.tripod.com/halfpenny.html Halfpenny Rose Red at ''pennyreds'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The stamp was replaced in 1880 by the surface printed Halfpenny Green stamp.

He defeated [[Roman Republic|Rome]]'s allies at the [[Battle of Thermae]] in 259 BC and killed 4,000–6,000 of them with the help of surprise and good use of [[military intelligence]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=73}}{{sfn|Rankov|2011|p=154}} He then captured the towns of [[Enna]] and [[Camarina]] that same year with traitors.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=75}}{{sfn|Rankov|2011|p=154}} He was defeated at the [[Battle of Tyndaris]] in 257 BC, losing 18 ships and sinking 9 Roman ships. He failed to prevent the Roman landing in Africa, being defeated at the [[Battle of Ecnomus|Ecnomus]] in 256 BC, one of the largest naval battles in antiquity, with the loss of 94 ships, to the Romans' 24. After the Roman invasion of Africa, Hamilcar was recalled by Carthage from Sicily. He was defeated at the [[Battle of Adys]] in 255 BC by [[Marcus Atilius Regulus]].

The '''Honeywell Project''' was a peace group based in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], United States that existed from the late 1960s until around 1990. During its existence, the organization waged a campaign to convince the board and executives of the [[Honeywell|Honeywell Corporation]] to convert their weapons manufacturing business to peaceful production.

==Purpose and beginning==
Marv Davidov, founder of the organization, says that in 1968, [[Staughton Lynd]] wrote an article calling for anti-war activists to oppose the Vietnam war by taking the struggle to the corporations that were profiting from it. In response to this Davidov and other activists in Minnesota began researching the local corporations and their ties to the military. At the time, the Honeywell corporation was Minnesota's largest military contractor. Over the two decades, Honeywell corporation's military contracts included the production of conventional weapons such as [[cluster bombs]] and guidance systems for both [[nuclear weapons]] and [[military aircraft]]. The group formed to challenge Honeywell's participation in the Vietnam war specifically, but also to oppose the corporation's military contracts in general.

==Activities==
In its early days the Project sponsored cultural and educational events coupled with large demonstrations outside of Honeywell's corporate headquarters in south Minneapolis. In the 1980s the group turned to large actions of nonviolent civil disobedience as its primary tactic. Additionally, the organization leafleted workers at Honeywell's various plants and sponsored study groups and trainings in nonviolence. As the civil disobedience actions grew larger, the Project began organizing people into [[affinity groups]].

==Membership==
The Honeywell Project had no formal membership, but the base of the organization was a coalition of secular and religious pacifists, socialists, anarchists, and activists from the anti-war, labor, solidarity movements. Participants came from a wide variety of occupations and ages and was open to anyone. Like many similar organizations of the time, participants were mostly white, though a few native Americans, African-Americans, and Hispanics were involved.

==Slogans or demands==
Over the years the organization focused on four main demands, the exact wording of which varied from time to time. Roughly speaking, these demands were:
* Peace conversion without loss of jobs
* No components for nuclear weapons
* No cluster bombs or other conventional weapons.
* Worker and community control over Honeywell and the nation's corporation.

Most of the banners and signs appearing at the organization's events referred to one of these slogans. The first three of these demands seems to have had the most support within the organization and thus received the highest attention. However when leafleting the Honeywell plants the labor activists in the organization also focused on the fourth.

==Organizational history==
===Vietnam era and COINTELPRO, 1968–1970s===
The Project's activities came in three phases with a dormant period in the mid-1970s. Between 1968 and 1972 the group focused on the Vietnam War. With the end of the war, the Project appeared to die off. When it was revealed that the organization had been infiltrated by [[FBI]] agents during its [[COINTELPRO]] program the group revived and in conjunction with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] filed a lawsuit against the FBI. This led to a low level of activity that lasted through the mid-1980s when the suit was settled out of court.

===Civil disobedience campaign, 1982–1990===
In 1982 a burgeoning [[anti-nuclear]] and the [[Plowshares Movement|Plowshares Eight]] inspired the group to once again take action in the streets. Davidov and a few members of the [[Catholic Worker Movement]] began to meet and plan a nonviolent civil disobedience action for November of that year. The action received a small amount of press. Thirty-six participants were arrested for blocking the entrances of the corporate headquarters. From this action came a trial and Honeywell Project organizers recruited activists for another, larger action in the spring of 1983 in conjunction with Honeywell's annual shareholders meeting. 

This set a pattern that would be repeated over the next few years. There would be two large civil disobedience actions per year, one in the spring and one in the fall. Each action would be preceded by a large rally with an educational speaker and musicians, designed to reach out to the public and educate the activists. Notable speakers at these rallies included [[Daniel Berrigan]], [[Phillip Berrigan]], [[Daniel Ellsberg]], and [[Noam Chomsky]]. The cultural component of these events included musicians and authors such as [[Utah Phillips]], [[Meridel Le Sueur]], [[Dean Reed]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deanreed.de/presse/minn19851106.html |title=Minneapolis Nov. 1985 |publisher=Deanreed.de |date=2007-12-07 |accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Bly]]. 

The following day the group would hold a mass action at Honeywell's corporate headquarters with places for people risking arrest and supporters. The largest of these demonstrations took place on October 24, 1983, when thousands of protesters blockaded the entrances to Honeywell's corporate offices for over twelve hours, resulting in the arrests of 577 people. 

In 1983 media reports of the demonstrations became much more prominent with the arrest of Erica Bouza, wife of Minneapolis's Chief of Police, [[Tony Bouza]].

Between the large actions, several smaller actions took place. Some were sponsored directly by the Honeywell Project and other indirectly by affinity groups affiliated with the organization. Over the seven-year campaign several thousand people were arrested, resulting in hundreds of court trials. Those convicted usually received light sentences of two to four days in jail, moderate fines, or mandatory community service. A few cases resulted in acquittals. At one point over a thousand court trials were scheduled in [[Hennepin County]] as a result of these demonstrations.

===Campaign against testing sites, 1987–1988===
In the late 1980s Honeywell's testing site in [[Arden Hills, Minnesota]] was showing signs of age and they began looking for an alternative site to test their weapons. Two attempts to find a suitable site elsewhere in Minnesota met organized opposition from local residents, some of whom had participated in the demonstrations in Minneapolis. 

In 1987 Honeywell purchased land in the [[Black Hills]] of [[South Dakota]] with a plan of creating their testing site there. Honeywell Project members worked in Minneapolis to support a group of white ranchers and Native Americans that called themselves the "Cowboy and Indian Alliance" or "CIA". The Honeywell Project reasoned that if Honeywell could not find a place to reliably test its weapons it would be unable to manufacture weapons of sufficient quality to sell to the military. In the end Honeywell was unable to install its testing site anywhere and Honeywell converted the land into a sanctuary for wild horses.

The main focus of the Honeywell Project at this time was still on its large civil disobedience oriented events and the main force behind the opposition to all three test site proposals came from local activists.

==Decline==
As the demonstrations grew in their regularity and predictability, their newsworthiness changed. Articles still appeared in the local paper, but as often as not they began to appear in the society pages, rather than in the news section. The Honeywell corporation adapted to the regularity of the events taking moves to minimize the disruptions they caused. Factional and personality splits within the organization led to a number of participants leaving. 

In the end many of the activists that made up the core of the Honeywell Project moved on to other struggles or changed their tactics. Some affinity groups continued to meet but related less to the Project as an organization. By 1990 the Project had ceased to formally meet.

==End results==
In September 1990, Honeywell spun off most of its military contracts business and formed a new company [[Alliant Techsystems]]. At the time, corporate spokespeople dismissed the notion that the Honeywell Project's activities had any part in their decision to do this. Honeywell Project activists disagreed.

Some of the activists that once worked on the campaign against Honeywell, and others, became involved in AlliantACTION, a similar group that conducted weekly vigils outside of Alliant Techsystems' headquarters in [[Hopkins, Minnesota|Hopkins]], [[Edina, Minnesota|Edina]], and [[Eden Prairie, Minnesota]], from 1996 to 2011.  AlliantACTION conducted its final weekly vigil on October 5, 2011, after Alliant Techsystems moved its corporate headquarters to [[Arlington, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliantaction.org/scoop/s1go/2004/faithandvalues/082804trib.html |title=AlliantAction |publisher=AlliantAction.org |date=2004-08-28 |accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[Japan]] annexed [[Taiwan]] from [[China]] in 1895, Taiwan lacked an effective government capable of banning or regulating the consumption of [[opium]].  According to Japanese statistics, in 1900, there were 169,000 opium smokers in Taiwan, equivalent to 6% of the Taiwanese population. In 1907, the Government of Japan enacted the Penal Code which included articles criminalizing the trade in opium, trade in instruments of smoking, as well as the smoking (Article 136~Article 141 inclusive). The Penal Code was enforced in Japan and the territories administered by Japan. The devastation opium had caused in China, and the penetration of opium addiction into all stratae of Asian society prompted the Japanese legislature. The Japanese law was concise to the point that Sc.138 is specific to corruption of Customs Officials&lt;ref&gt;https://ja.wikibooks.org/wiki/%E5%88%91%E6%B3%95%E7%AC%AC137%E6%9D%A1&lt;/ref&gt;, an indicator of the seriousness of the opium problem, and the serious policy to combat it&lt;ref&gt;Government Of Japan, Ministry of Justice, Enacted books of Law of the year 1907, Book of Law number 45, &lt;/ref&gt;.
The Japanese colonial government eliminate opium use in Taiwan. (between 1895 and 1945)
Japanese opium policy in Taiwan was one of the most controversial issues.
For the Japanese administration, opium was both a deep-rooted problem of social control and an inviting source of revenue.
The revenue from this source would help to balance a budget that remained in the red.
Japanese opium policy was promoted under the administration and leadership of the [[East Asia Development Board]] (Kōain) in operation from December 1938 to November 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NZ9Wc5IkCHwC&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=Japanese%20opium%20policy%20in%20Taiwan&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage&amp;q=Japanese%20opium%20policy%20in%20Taiwan&amp;f=false

&lt;/ref&gt;
The Japanese government tried to prohibit opium at first, but after encountering many difficulties, the strategy turned into one of "slow weaning" by adopting a licensing system. As a result, the number of opium smokers had decreased to 24,000 by 1929. However, as [[World War II]] progressed, opium licensing became a source of much-needed revenue for Japan's war efforts.

'''Royal Guard Brigade - Hamza Ibn Abd Al-Muttalib (Sayed Al-Shuhada)''' is a unit of the [[Jordanian Armed Forces]], The Royal Guards Brigade is one of the most elite unites of the Jordanian army and is primarily responsible for the protection and defense of the royal Hashemite dynasty.  

The Royal Guards are based in Amman. They are largely recruited from the most loyal [[Bedouin]] tribes of the east bank of Jordan. The Royal guards brigade is not to be confused with the [[King of Jordan|king’s]] [[Circassian Bodyguard]] who though are part of the Royal Guards, but are primarily ceremonial. 

The Royal Guards Brigade are under the direct personal control of the King. There is also a special bodyguard unit assigned to [[Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah]], called ''His Majesty’s Special Security Group.'' The special security unit is responsible for the close personal security of the king and is basically the Jordanian equivalent of the [[U.S. Secret Service]]. It was commanded by the king's brother, Prince Ali.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gloria-center.org/meria/2001/06/bligh.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ssm.gov.tr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ihracat.ssm.gov.tr/TR/Documents/sofex2008/Mart%202008_%20Turkiye%20Urdun%20SSI%20Bilgi%20Notu.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122151459/http://ihracat.ssm.gov.tr/TR/Documents/sofex2008/Mart%202008_%20Turkiye%20Urdun%20SSI%20Bilgi%20Notu.PDF |archivedate=2009-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mammoth''''' ({{lang-bg|Мамут}}) is a 1990 satirical play by Bulgarian playwright [[Stanislav Stratiev]]. It was written in 1989,&lt;ref name="Jacobson2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacobson|first=Josepha|title=Contemporary Bulgarian plays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zKwXAQAAIAAJ|date=1 June 2002|publisher=Tantalus|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; but premiered at the [[Satirical Theatre]] of [[Sofia]] on October 12, 1990. 

==Plot==
The play centres around the Associate Professor of Linguistics Ivan Antonov, his wife Martha—a professor of composition at the conservatory, and their son Bozhidar. Suddenly, in the middle of the night on the wall appears the shadow of the mammoth, which is said to appear wherever an unsolved crime is committed. Gradually the shadow of the mammoth appears throughout the block, neighborhood, and finally across the city.

Malta is located {{convert|93|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Sicily]], and {{convert|288|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[North Africa]], giving the country a warm, [[Mediterranean climate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doi.gov.mt/en/islands/location.asp The Maltese Islands], Department of Information&amp;nbsp;— Malta.&lt;/ref&gt; The nation's [[Capital (political)|capital]] is the 16th century city of [[Valletta]].

Throughout much of its history, Malta has been considered a crucial location due in large part to its position in the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://home.wanadoo.nl/bezver/introduc.html|publisher=A History of Malta|title=Situation|date=6 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was held by several ancient cultures including [[Sicily|Sicilians]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Byzantine]]s and others. The island is commonly associated with the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of St. John]] who ruled it. This, along with the historic pseudo-historic and religiously claimed shipwreck of [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] on the island, and since the 12th century ingrained a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] legacy which is still the official [[religion in Malta]] today combined with secular values.

The country's official languages are [[Maltese language|Maltese]] and [[English language|English]], the former is the national language and the latter a legacy from Malta's period as a [[British colony]]. Malta gained [[independence]] in 1964 and is currently a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], as well as the [[European Union]], which it joined in 2004.

'''"Petit bonhomme"''' ([[English language|English]] translation: "Little Boy") was the [[Luxembourg]]ish entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1962]], performed in [[French language|French]] by Luxembourgish singer [[Camillo Felgen]].

This was Felgen's second appearance on the Eurovision stage, in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1960|1960 Contest]] he had also represented Luxembourg, singing "[[So laang we's du do bast]]" in [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]].

"Petit bonhomme" is a ballad, with Felgen singing to a boy he identifies as his son near the end of the lyric. He tells him that there are many more experiences for his generation than the older one and that this is a good thing. Felgen also recorded his entry in a [[German language]] version, as "Du kleiner Mann" ("You, Little Man").

The song was performed fourteenth on the night (following the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Ronnie Carroll]] with "[[Ring-A-Ding Girl]]" and preceding [[Italy]]'s [[Claudio Villa (singer)|Claudio Villa]] with "[[Addio, addio]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 11 points, placing 3rd in a field of 16.

It was succeeded as [[Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest|Luxembourgish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1963|1963 Contest]] by [[Nana Mouskouri]] with "[[À force de prier]]".

The '''Sustained Dialogue Institute''', founded by [[Harold H. Saunders]] and incorporated in 2002, is an independent tax-exempt 501 (c)(3) organization formed in collaboration with the [[Kettering Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;Sustained Dialogue in Conflicts: Transformation and Change, by Harold "Hal" Saunders, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The institute provides trainings, consulting, and technical support for the Sustained Dialogue process on campuses, workplaces, and communities around the globe. Sustained Dialogue is system for transforming conflictual or destructive relationships, and implementing long-term change, developed from Hal Saunders' experience facilitating peace processes in the Middle East as a United States diplomat.&lt;ref&gt;http://sustaineddialogue.org/about-us//&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The Sustained Dialogue Institute houses the '''Sustained Dialogue System''' process and the [[Sustained Dialogue Campus Network]].

== Sustained Dialogue System ==
'''Sustained Dialogue''' is a process for transforming deep-rooted human conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Relational, Networked and Collaborative Approaches to Public Diplomacy: The Connective Mindshift, by R.S. Zaharna, Amelia Arsenault, Ali Fisher; published by Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Former United States [[Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs]] Hal Saunders developed the process, which is rooted in his experience in facilitating peace processes, including the [[Camp David Accords]] and the [[Iran Hostage Crisis]]. During the [[Cold War]], the Sustained Dialogue System served as the underlying philosophy of the [[Dartmouth Conferences (peace)|Dartmouth Conferences]], the longest-running citizen dialogue between U.S. and Russian (formerly Soviet) citizens. The Dartmouth Conference worked to open channels to transmit and clarify perspectives when communication among Russian (formerly Soviet) and United States officials broke down.&lt;ref&gt;Dialogue Sustained: The Multilevel Peace Process and the Dartmouth Conference By James Voorhees, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sustained Dialogue Campus Network ==
The '''Sustained Dialogue Campus Network (SDCN)''', a project of the Sustained Dialogue Institute founded in 2003, is a training and consulting hub for the international network of campuses running Sustained Dialogues. SDCN began during Saunders' time on the Board of Trustees at Princeton University. Saunders and [[Princeton University]] undergraduates David Tukey and Teddy Nemeroff worked together to apply the Sustained Dialogue methodology to addressing race-based conflicts at Princeton, and their collaboration spread to the [[University of Virginia]], and developed into the Campus Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.princeton52.org/dynamic.asp?id=class_news|title=Sustained Dialogue marks decade |work=Daily Princetonian|author=Anne Lee|accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Housed by the Sustained Dialogue Institute, SDCN involves students from dozens of campuses in twelve countries who work to improve intergroup relations and campus climate. The focus of any Sustained Dialogue program is relationship building across lines of difference and facilitating honest dialogue between students, faculty, staff, and administrators.&lt;ref&gt;"To Serve a Larger Purpose": Engagement for Democracy and the Transformation ... edited by John Saltmarsh, Matthew Hartley, page 165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sustaineddialogue.org/our-impact/#&lt;/ref&gt; SDCN trains campus communities in facilitation and Sustained Dialogue moderation, as well as inclusive leadership skills and conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unsv.com/voanews/specialenglish/scripts/2006/01/18/0045/|title=Explorations-Sustained Dialogue: Solving Conflicts Among People in Africa and at American Colleges|work=VOA Special English|author=Marilyn Christiano|date=2006-01-18|accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active programs send students to annual dialogue conferences at local chapters or at SDCN headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]]

== Impact ==
A study published by the Journal of Peace Research showed that Sustained Dialogue had a positive effect on decreasing mistrust and increasing the level of trust between people of different ethnic origins. However, participation in the dialogue program increased the sense of importance of ethnic identities as well as the perception of being ethnically discriminated and had no significant effect on game behavior.&lt;ref&gt;http://jpr.sagepub.com/content/50/5/563&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Telstar 302''' was a [[geostationary]] [[communication]] [[satellite]] built by [[Hughes Communications|Hughes]], it was located at orbital position of 85 degrees west longitude and was operated by [[AT&amp;T]]. The satellite was based on the [[HS-376]] platform and its life expectancy was 10 years. Telstar 302 left service on September 5, 1997. The satellite was successfully launched into space on August 30, 1984, at 12:41:50 UTC, aboard the [[Space Shuttle Discovery]] during the [[STS-41D]] mission from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] in [[Florida]], [[United States]], Along with the [[SBS 4]] satellites and [[Leasat 2]]. It had a launch mass of 1,140&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;[[NASA]], [[GSFC]]. [http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1984-093D 1984-093D]. NSSDC Master Catalog. Retrieved May 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Telstar 302 was equipped with 24 [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] transponders to provide telecommunication service to [[North America]] (including [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]] and [[Puerto Rico]]).

Retrieved on 16 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; officially the '''Republic of Turkmenistan''' is a country in [[Central Asia]], bordered by [[Kazakhstan]] to the northwest, [[Uzbekistan]] to the north and east, [[Afghanistan]] to the southeast, [[Iran]] to the south and southwest, and the [[Caspian Sea]] to the west. [[Ashgabat]] is the capital and largest city. The population of the country is 5.6 million, the lowest of the Central Asian republics.

Turkmenistan has been at the crossroads of civilizations for centuries. In medieval times, [[Merv]] was one of the great cities of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] and an important stop on the [[Silk Road]], a caravan route used for trade with [[China]] until the mid-15th century. Annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1881, Turkmenistan later figured prominently in the [[Russian Civil War|anti-Bolshevik movement]] in Central Asia. In 1925, Turkmenistan became a constituent republic of the [[Soviet Union]], [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Turkmen SSR); it became independent upon the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=cia /&gt;

Turkmenistan possesses the world's sixth [[List of countries by natural gas proven reserves|largest reserves of natural gas resources]].&lt;ref name="TM Gas Reserves"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/new-customer-turkmen-natural-gas |title= A New Customer for Turkmen Natural Gas| accessdate= 22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the country is covered by the [[Karakum Desert|Karakum (Black Sand) Desert]]. From 1993 to 2017, citizens received government-provided electricity, water and natural gas free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkmen-ruler-ends-free-power-gas-water-120631|title=Turkmen ruler ends free power, gas, water – World News|website=Hürriyet Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[sovereign state]] of Turkmenistan was ruled by [[President for Life]] [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] (also known as ''Turkmenbashi'') until his death in 2006. [[Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow]] was elected president in 2007. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], "Turkmenistan remains one of the world’s most repressive countries. The country is virtually closed to independent scrutiny, media and religious freedoms are subject to draconian restrictions, and human rights defenders and other activists face the constant threat of government reprisal."&lt;ref name="MyUser_Hrw.org_January_28_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2014/country-chapters/turkmenistan |title=World Report 2014: Turkmenistan |newspaper=Hrw.org |date= 2 January 2014|accessdate= 28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After suspending the death penalty, the use of capital punishment was formally abolished in the 2008 constitution.&lt;ref name="constituteproject.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/249665.stm|title=BBC News – Asia-Pacific – Turkmenistan suspends death penalty|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The name of Turkmenistan ({{lang-tk|Türkmenistan}}) can be divided into two components: the ethnonym [[Turkmens|Türkmen]] and the Persian suffix [[-stan]] meaning "place of" or "country". The name "Turkmen" comes from Turk, plus the [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] suffix -men, meaning "almost Turk", in reference to their status outside the Turkic dynastic mythological system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Zuev |first=Yury |title= Early Türks: Essays on history and ideology |location= Almatý |publisher= Daik-Press |year= 2002 |page=157 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scholars argue the suffix is an [[intensifier]], changing the meaning of Türkmen to "pure Turks" or "the Turkish Turks."&lt;ref&gt;''US Library of Congress Country Studies.'' "[http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/tmtoc.html Turkmenistan]."&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim chroniclers like [[Ibn Kathir]] suggested that the etymology of Turkmenistan came from the words Türk and [[Iman (concept)|Iman]] ({{lang-ar|إيمان}}, "faith, belief") in reference to a massive conversion to Islam of two hundred thousand households in the year 971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ar.wikisource.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9_%D9%88_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9_-_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%B2%D8%A1_11 Ibn Kathir al-Bidaya wa al-Nihaya]. {{ar icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of Turkmenistan}}
Historically inhabited by the [[Indo-Iranians]], the written history of Turkmenistan begins with its annexation by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] of Ancient Iran. In the 8th century AD, [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]] tribes moved from [[Mongolia]] into present-day Central Asia. Part of a powerful confederation of tribes, these Oghuz formed the ethnic basis of the modern Turkmen population.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Turkmenistan.pdf |title=Country Profile: Turkmenistan |publisher=Library of Congress Federal Research Division |format=PDF |date=February 2007 |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 10th century, the name "Turkmen" was first applied to Oghuz groups that accepted [[Islam]] and began to occupy present-day Turkmenistan.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; There they were under the dominion of the [[Seljuk Empire]], which was composed of Oghuz groups living in present-day [[Iran]] and Turkmenistan.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; Turkmen soldiers in the service of the empire played an important role in the spreading of Turkic culture when they migrated westward into present-day [[Azerbaijan]] and eastern [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name=cs /&gt;

[[File:Turban helmet Met 04.3.211.jpg|thumb|left|[[Turkmens|Turkmen]] helmet (15th century)]]

In the 12th century, [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] and other tribes overthrew the Seljuk Empire.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; In the next century, the [[Mongols]] took over the more northern lands where the Turkmens had settled, scattering the Turkmens southward and contributing to the formation of new tribal groups.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; The sixteenth and eighteenth centuries saw a series of splits and confederations among the [[nomad]]ic Turkmen tribes, who remained staunchly independent and inspired fear in their neighbors.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; By the 16th century, most of those tribes were under the nominal control of two sedentary [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] [[khanate]]s, [[Khanate of Khiva|Khiva]] and [[Khanate of Bukhara|Bukhoro]].&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; Turkmen soldiers were an important element of the Uzbek militaries of this period.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; In the 19th century, raids and rebellions by the [[Yomud]] Turkmen group resulted in that group's dispersal by the Uzbek rulers.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; According to Paul R. Spickard, "Prior to the Russian conquest, the Turkmen were known and feared for their involvement in the Central Asian [[History of slavery in Asia|slave trade]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul R.

[[Russia]]n forces began occupying Turkmen territory late in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; From their [[Caspian Sea]] base at Krasnovodsk (now [[Türkmenbaşy, Turkmenistan|Turkmenbashi]]), the Russians eventually overcame the Uzbek khanates.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; In 1881, the last significant resistance in Turkmen territory was crushed at the [[Battle of Geok Tepe]], and shortly thereafter Turkmenistan was annexed, together with adjoining Uzbek territory, into the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; In 1916 the Russian Empire's participation in [[World War I]] resonated in Turkmenistan, as an anticonscription revolt swept most of Russian Central Asia.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; Although the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 had little direct impact, in the 1920s Turkmen forces joined [[Kazakhs]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], and Uzbeks in the so-called [[Basmachi Rebellion]] against the rule of the newly formed [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; In 1924 the [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic]] was formed from the tsarist province of [[Transcaspia]].&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; By the late 1930s, Soviet reorganization of agriculture had destroyed what remained of the nomadic lifestyle in Turkmenistan, and Moscow controlled political life.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; The [[1948 Ashgabat earthquake|Ashgabat earthquake]] of 1948 killed over 110,000 people,&lt;ref name="NGDC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/results?eq_0=3891&amp;t=101650&amp;s=13&amp;d=22,26,13,12&amp;nd=display | title=Comments for the significant earthquake | publisher=[[National Geophysical Data Center]] | work=Significant Earthquake Database | accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; amounting to two-thirds of the city's population.

During the next half-century, Turkmenistan played its designated economic role within the Soviet Union and remained outside the course of major world events.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; Even the major [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–1991)|liberalization movement]] that shook Russia in the late 1980s had little impact.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; However, in 1990 the Supreme Soviet of Turkmenistan declared sovereignty as a [[nationalist]] response to perceived exploitation by [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; Although Turkmenistan was ill-prepared for independence and then-[[communist]] leader [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] preferred to preserve the Soviet Union, in October 1991 the fragmentation of that entity forced him to call a national referendum that approved independence.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; On 26 December 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist. Niyazov continued as Turkmenistan's chief of state, replacing communism with a unique brand of independent nationalism reinforced by a pervasive [[cult of personality]].&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; A 1994 referendum and legislation in 1999 abolished further requirements for the president to stand for re-election (although in 1992 he completely dominated the only [[Turkmenistani presidential election, 1992|presidential election]] in which he ran, as he was the only candidate and no one else was allowed to run for the office), making him effectively [[president for life]].&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; During his tenure, Niyazov conducted frequent purges of public officials and abolished organizations deemed threatening.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; Throughout the post-Soviet era, Turkmenistan has taken a neutral position on almost all international issues.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; Niyazov eschewed membership in regional organizations such as the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]], and in the late 1990s he maintained relations with the [[Taliban]] and its chief opponent in [[Afghanistan]], the [[Northern Alliance]].&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; He offered limited support to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|military campaign against the Taliban]] following the [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]].&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; In 2002 an alleged assassination attempt against Niyazov led to a new wave of security restrictions, dismissals of government officials, and restrictions placed on the media.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; Niyazov accused exiled former foreign minister [[Boris Shikhmuradov]] of having planned the attack.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt;

Between 2002 and 2004, serious tension arose between Turkmenistan and [[Uzbekistan]] because of bilateral disputes and Niyazov's implication that Uzbekistan had a role in the 2002 assassination attempt.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; In 2004 a series of bilateral treaties restored friendly relations.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; In the [[Turkmenistani parliamentary election, 2004|parliamentary elections of December 2004 and January 2005]], only Niyazov's party was represented, and no [[Election monitoring|international monitors]] participated.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; In 2005 Niyazov exercised his dictatorial power by closing all hospitals outside [[Ashgabat]] and all rural libraries.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; The year 2006 saw intensification of the trends of arbitrary policy changes, shuffling of top officials, diminishing economic output outside the oil and gas sector, and isolation from regional and world organizations.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; China was among a very few nations to whom Turkmenistan made significant overtures.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; The sudden death of Niyazov at the end of 2006 left a complete vacuum of power, as [[List of cults of personality#Turkmenistan|his cult of personality]], compared to the [[Kim Il-sung's cult of personality|one]] of former president [[Kim Il-sung]] of [[North Korea]], had precluded the naming of a successor.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; Deputy Prime Minister [[Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow]], who was named interim head of government, won the [[Turkmenistani presidential election, 2007|special presidential election]] held in early February 2007.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt; He was [[Turkmenistani presidential election, 2012|re-elected in 2012]] with 97% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/13/turkmenistan-president-wins-election?newsfeed=true |title=Turkmenistan president wins election with 96.9% of vote |publisher=theguardian.com |date= 13 February 2012|accessdate=25 November 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 69 years as part of the [[Soviet Union]] (including 67 years as a union republic), Turkmenistan declared its independence on 27 October 1991.

[[President for Life]] [[Saparmurat Niyazov]], a former bureaucrat of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], ruled Turkmenistan from 1985, when he became head of the [[Communist Party of the Turkmen SSR]], until his death in 2006. He retained absolute control over the country after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. On 28 December 1999, Niyazov was declared President for Life of Turkmenistan by the Mejlis (parliament), which itself had taken office a week earlier in elections that included only candidates hand-picked by President Niyazov. No opposition candidates were allowed.

Since the December 2006 death of Niyazov, Turkmenistan's leadership has made tentative moves to open up the country. His successor, President [[Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow]], repealed some of Niyazov's most idiosyncratic policies, including banning opera and the circus for being ''"insufficiently Turkmen"''. In education, Berdimuhamedow's government increased basic education to ten years from nine years, and higher education was extended from four years to five. It also increased contacts with the West, which is eager for access to the country's natural gas riches.

The politics of Turkmenistan take place in the framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], with the [[President of Turkmenistan|President]] both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. Under Niyazov, Turkmenistan had a [[One-party state|one-party system]]; however, in September 2008, the People's Council unanimously passed a resolution adopting a new [[Constitution of Turkmenistan|Constitution]]. The latter resulted in the abolition of the Council and a significant increase in the size of Parliament in December 2008 and also permits the formation of multiple political parties.

The former Communist Party, now known as the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]], is the dominant party. The second party, the [[Party of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs]] was established in August 2012. Political gatherings are illegal unless government sanctioned. In 2013 the first multi-party Parliamentary Elections [[Turkmenistani parliamentary election, 2013|were held]] in Turkmenistan. Turkmenistan was a one-party state from 1991 to 2012; however, the 2013 elections were widely seen as mere window dressing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2014/turkmenistan|title=Turkmenistan|publisher=|accessdate=12 February 2016|date=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, all parties in parliament operate jointly under the direction of the DPT. There are no true opposition parties in the Turkmen parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://carnegie.ru/2017/05/22/ru-pub-70020|title=Независимому Туркменистану двадцать пять лет: цена авторитаризма|last=Stronski|first=Paul|date=22 May 2017|work=carnegie.ru|language=Russian|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Human rights in Turkmenistan}}
Turkmenistan has been widely criticised for human rights abuses and has imposed severe restrictions on foreign travel for its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3007598.stm |title=Russians 'flee' Turkmenistan |publisher=BBC News |date=20 June 2003 |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination against the country's ethnic minorities remains in practice.

According to [[Reporters Without Borders]]' 2014 World Press Freedom Index, Turkmenistan had the 3rd worst press freedom conditions in the world (178/180 countries), just before [[North Korea]] and [[Eritrea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rsf.org/en/ranking/2014|title=Reporters Without Borders|work=rsf.org|accessdate=14 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214000000/http://rsf.org/index2014/en-index2014.php|archivedate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be one of the "10 Most Censored Countries".

=== Restrictions on free and open communication ===
Despite the launch of Turkmenistan's first [[communication satellite]]—[[TurkmenSat 1]]—in April 2015, the [[Government of Turkmenistan|Turkmen government]] banned all [[satellite dish]]es in Turkmenistan the same month. The statement issued by the government indicated that all existing satellite dishes would have to be removed or destroyed—despite the communications receiving antennas having been legally installed since 1995—in an effort by the government to fully block access of the population to many "hundreds of independent international media outlets which are currently accessible in the country only through satellite dishes, including all leading international news channels in different languages. The main target of this campaign is [[Radio Azatlyk]], the Turkmen-language service of [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]. It is the only independent source of information about Turkmenistan and the world in the [[Turkmen language]] and is widely listened to in the country."&lt;ref name=at20150422&gt;{{cite news |last1=Forrester|first1=Chris |title=Satellite dishes banned in Turkmenistan |url=http://advanced-television.com/2015/04/22/satellite-dishes-banned-in-turkmenistan/ |accessdate=23 April 2015 |work=Advanced Television |date=22 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Administrative divisions ==
{{See also|Districts of Turkmenistan}}
{{Turkmenistan Provinces Image Map}}

Turkmenistan is divided into five provinces or ''welayatlar'' (singular ''[[welayat]]'') and one capital city district. The provinces are subdivided into districts (''etraplar'', sing. ''etrap''), which may be either counties or cities. According to the [[Constitution of Turkmenistan]] (Article 16 in the 2008 Constitution, Article 47 in the 1992 Constitution), some cities may have the status of ''welaýat'' (province) or ''etrap'' (district).

[[File:Turkmenistan map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Turkmenistan map of Köppen climate classification]]
The [[Karakum Desert]] is one of the driest deserts in the world; some places have an average annual precipitation of only {{convert|12|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}. The highest temperature recorded in [[Ashgabat]] is {{convert|48.0|°C|lk=on}} and [[Kerki]], an extreme inland city located on the banks of the [[Amu Darya]] river, recorded {{convert|51.7|°C}} in July 1983, although this value is unofficial. {{convert|50.1|C|F|0}} is the highest temperature recorded at [[Repetek Biosphere State Reserve|Repetek Reserve]], recognized as the highest temperature ever recorded in the whole former Soviet Union.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Turkmenistan|List of mountains of Turkmenistan}}
[[File:Turkmenistan-map.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of Turkmenistan]]

At {{convert|488100|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, Turkmenistan is the world's 52nd-largest country. It is slightly smaller than [[Spain]] and somewhat larger than the US state of [[California]]. It lies between latitudes [[35th parallel north|35°]] and [[43rd parallel north|43° N]], and longitudes [[52nd meridian east|52°]] and [[67th meridian east|67° E]].
Over 80% of the country is covered by the [[Karakum Desert]]. The center of the country is dominated by the [[Turan Depression]] and the Karakum Desert. The [[Kopet Dag]] [[mountain range|Range]], along the southwestern border, reaches {{convert|2,912|m|ft|lk=out|abbr=off}} at Kuh-e Rizeh (Mount Rizeh).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=10469 Kuh-e Rizeh] on Peakbagger.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Balkhan Range in the west of the country ([[Balkan Province]]) and the [[Köýtendag Range]] on the southeastern border with Uzbekistan ([[Lebap Province]]) are the only other significant elevations. The Great Balkhan Range rises to {{convert|1880|m|ft}} at [[Gora Arlan|Mount Arlan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=13160 |title=Mount Arlan |publisher=Peakbagger.com |date=1 November 2004 |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the highest summit in Turkmenistan is [[Ayrybaba]] in the Kugitangtau Range – {{convert|3137|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=10488 |title=Ayrybaba |publisher=Peakbagger.com |date=1 November 2004 |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Kopet Dag]] mountain range forms most of the border between Turkmenistan and Iran. Rivers include the [[Amu Darya]], the [[Murghab River (Tajikistan)|Murghab]], and the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Tejen]].

The climate is mostly arid desert with [[subtropics|subtropical]] temperature ranges and little rainfall. Winters are mild and dry, with most precipitation falling between January and May. The area of the country with the heaviest precipitation is the Kopet Dag Range.

The Turkmen shore along the [[Caspian Sea]] is {{convert|1748|km|mi}} long. The Caspian Sea is entirely landlocked, with no natural access to the ocean, although the [[Volga–Don Canal]] allows shipping access to and from the [[Black Sea]].

The major cities include [[Ashgabat|Aşgabat]], [[Türkmenbaşy, Turkmenistan|Türkmenbaşy]] (formerly Krasnovodsk) and [[Daşoguz]].

The country possesses the world's sixth largest reserves of [[natural gas]] and substantial oil resources.&lt;ref name="TM Gas Reserves" /&gt;

Turkmenistan has taken a cautious approach to economic reform, hoping to use gas and cotton sales to sustain its economy. In 2014, the unemployment rate was estimated to be 11%.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tx.html |title=Turkmenistan |publisher=CIA World Factbook |date= |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bai Bazaar, Dashoguz.jpg|thumb|[[Bazaar]] in [[Daşoguz]]]]

Between 1998 and 2002, Turkmenistan suffered from the continued lack of adequate [[export]] routes for natural gas and from obligations on extensive short-term external [[debt]]. At the same time, however, the value of total exports has risen sharply because of increases in international oil and gas prices. Economic prospects in the near future are discouraging because of widespread internal [[poverty]] and the burden of foreign debt. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
[[File:10000 manat. Türkmenistan, 1998 b.jpg|thumb|[[Saparmurat Hajji Mosque]] featured on the obsolete 10,000 manat banknote.]]

President Niyazov spent much of the country's revenue on extensively renovating cities, Ashgabat in particular. Corruption watchdogs voiced particular concern over the management of Turkmenistan's currency reserves, most of which are held in off-budget funds such as the Foreign Exchange Reserve Fund in the Deutsche Bank in [[Frankfurt]], according to a report released in April 2006 by London-based non-governmental organization [[Global Witness]].

According to the decree of the Peoples' Council of 14 August 2003,&lt;ref&gt;Resolution of Khalk Maslahati (Peoples' Council of Turkmenistan) N 35 (14 August 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; [[electricity]], [[natural gas]], [[water]] and [[salt]] will be subsidized for citizens up to 2030. Under current regulations, every citizen is entitled to 35 kilowatt hours of electricity and 50 cubic meters of natural gas each month. The state also provides 250 liters (66 gallons) of water per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/turkmenistan-leader-wants-to-end-free-power-gas-and-water/a-39152012 |title=Turkmenistan leader wants to end free power, gas, and water |date=6 July 2017 |accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition car drivers were entitled to 120 litres of free petrol a month until 1 July 2014. Drivers of buses, lorries and tractors could get 200 litres of fuel and motorcyclists and scooter riders 40 litres free. On 5 September 2006, after Turkmenistan threatened to cut off supplies, Russia agreed to raise the price it pays for Turkmen natural gas from $65 to $100 per 1,000 cubic meters. Two-thirds of Turkmen gas goes through the Russian [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned]] [[Gazprom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5314940.stm |title=Business &amp;#124; Russia reaches Turkmen gas deal |publisher=BBC News |date=5 September 2006 |accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Natural gas and export routes ===
{{As of|May 2011}}, the [[Galkynysh gas field]] has the second-largest volume of gas in the world, after the [[South Pars]] field in the Persian Gulf. Reserves at the [[Galkynysh gas field]] are estimated at around 21.2 trillion cubic metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/05/25/gas-turkmenistan-idUKLDE74O23A20110525 | work=Reuters | first=Dmitry | last=Solovyov | title=Turkmen gas field to be world's second-largest | date=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkmenistan Natural Gas Company ([[Türkmengaz]]), under the auspices of the Ministry of Oil and Gas, controls gas extraction in the country. Gas production is the most dynamic and promising sector of the national economy. In 2010 Ashgabat started a policy of diversifying export routes for its raw materials.&lt;ref name="europarussia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarussia.com/posts/1748 |title=Turkmenistan.

Turkmenistan has previously estimated the cost of the project at $3.3 billion.
On 21 May 2010, president [[Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow]] unexpectedly signed a decree stating that companies from Turkmenistan will build an internal East-West gas pipeline allowing the transfer of gas from the biggest deposits in Turkmenistan (Dowlatabad and Yoloten) to the Caspian coast. The East-West pipeline is planned to be 773-kilometre (483-mile) long and have a carrying capacity of 30 bn m³ annually, at a cost of between one and one and a half billion US dollars.&lt;ref name="europarussia.com" /&gt; The Trans-Caspian pipeline (TCP) project, backed by the European Union, has so far remained on paper, partly due to disputes about the Caspian Sea's legal status and Turkmenistan's refusal to sign production-sharing agreements with foreign companies for major [[hydrocarbon]] deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Turkmenistan boosts gas export capacity with East-West link|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/turkmenistan-pipeline-idUSL8N14C0GT20151223|publisher=Reuters.com |date=23 December 2015|newspaper=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oil ===
Most of Turkmenistan's oil is extracted by the Turkmenistan State Company (Concern) [[Türkmennebit]] from fields at Koturdepe, [[Balkanabat]], and [[Cheleken]] near the Caspian Sea, which have a combined estimated reserve of 700 million tons. The oil extraction industry started with the exploitation of the fields in Cheleken in 1909 (by [[Branobel]]) and in Balkanabat in the 1930s. Production leaped ahead with the discovery of the Kumdag field in 1948 and the Koturdepe field in 1959. A big part of the oil produced in Turkmenistan is refined in Turkmenbashy and Seidi refineries. Also, oil is exported by tankers through the Caspian Sea to Europe via canals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://turkmenistanoil.tripod.com/id4.html |title=Turkmenistan Oil and Gas |publisher=Turkmenistanoil.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy ===
Turkmenistan is a net exporter of electrical power to Central Asian republics and southern neighbors. The most important generating installations are the Hindukush Hydroelectric Station, which has a rated capacity of 350 megawatts, and the Mary Thermoelectric Power Station, which has a rated capacity of 1,370 megawatts. In 1992, electrical power production totaled 14.9 billion kilowatt-hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/turkmenistan/22.htm |title=Turkmenistan study |publisher=Countrystudies.us |date= |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Turkmenistan, most of irrigated land is planted with [[cotton]], making the country the world's ninth-largest cotton producer.&lt;ref name="statista"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statista.com/statistics/151168/cotton-producing-countries/ |title=The ten largest cotton producing countries in 2009 |publisher=Statista.com |date= |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2011 season, Turkmenistan produced around 1.1 million tons of raw cotton, mainly from Mary, Balkan, Akhal, Lebap and Dashoguz provinces. In 2012, around 7,000 tractors, 5,000 cotton cultivators, 2,200 sowing machines and other machinery, mainly procured from [[Belarus]] and the US, are being used. The country traditionally exports raw cotton to Russia, Iran, South Korea, Britain, China, Indonesia, Turkey, Ukraine, Singapore and the Baltic nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Turkmenistan to Privilege US Farm Machinery Manufacturers|url=http://www.satrapia.com/news/article/turkmenistan-to-privilege-us-farm-machinery-manufacturers/|accessdate=4 August 2012|newspaper=The Gazette of Central Asia|date=26 July 2012|publisher=Satrapia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Turkmenistan's citizens are [[Turkmen people|ethnic Turkmens]] with sizeable minorities of [[Uzbeks]] and [[Russians]]. Smaller minorities include [[Kazakhs]], [[Tatars]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Kurds]] (native to [[Kopet Dagh]] mountains), [[Armenians]], [[Azerbaijani people|Azeris]], [[Baloch people|Balochs]] and [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]]. The percentage of ethnic [[Russians in Turkmenistan]] dropped from 18.6% in 1939 to 9.5% in 1989. In 2012 it was confirmed that the population of Turkmenistan decreased due to some specific factors{{which|date=April 2013}} and is less than the previously estimated 5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Moya Flynn|title=Migrant Resettlement in the Russian Federation: Reconstructing 'homes' and 'homelands'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YLeAxHLmgR8C&amp;pg=PA15|year=2004|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=978-1-84331-117-1|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''CIA World Factbook'' gives the ethnic composition of Turkmenistan as 85% Turkmen, 5% Uzbek, 4% Russian and 6% other ({{As of|2003|alt=2003 estimates}}).&lt;ref name=cia /&gt; According to data announced in Ashgabat {{As of|2001|02|alt=in February 2001}}, 91% of the population are Turkmen, 3% are Uzbeks and 2% are Russians.

According to the [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]], [[Muslims]] constitute 89% of the population while 9% of the population are followers of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the remaining 2% religion is reported as ''non-religious.''&lt;ref name=cia /&gt; However, according to a 2009 [[Pew Research Center]] report, 93.1% of Turkmenistan's population is Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewforum.org/uploadedfiles/Topics/Demographics/Muslimpopulation.pdf |format=PDF |title=MAPPING THE GLOBAL MUSLIM POPULATION : A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World's Muslim Population |date=October 2009 |website=Pweforum.org |accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first migrants were sent as [[Dawah|missionaries]] and often were adopted as patriarchs of particular clans or tribal groups, thereby becoming their "founders." Reformulation of communal identity around such figures accounts for one of the highly localized developments of Islamic practice in Turkmenistan.&lt;ref name="JuergensmeyerRoof2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Juergensmeyer|author2=Wade Clark Roof|title=Encyclopedia of Global Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwJzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1312|date=18 October 2011|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-6656-5|pages=1312–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, all religious beliefs were attacked by the communist authorities as superstition and "vestiges of the past." Most religious schooling and religious observance were banned, and the vast majority of mosques were closed. However, since 1990, efforts have been made to regain some of the cultural heritage lost under Soviet rule.

Former president [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] ordered that basic Islamic principles be taught in public schools. More religious institutions, including religious schools and mosques, have appeared, many with the support of [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], and [[Turkey]]. Religious classes are held in both schools and mosques, with instruction in [[Arabic language]], the [[Qur'an]] and the [[hadith]], and history of Islam.&lt;ref name=cs2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/about.html |author1=Larry Clark |author2=Michael Thurman |author3=David Tyson |last-author-amp=yes |title=A Country Study: Turkmenistan |editor=Glenn E.

President Niyazov wrote his own religious text, published in separate volumes in 2001 and 2004, entitled the [[Ruhnama]]. The Turkmenbashi regime required that the book, which formed the basis of the educational system in Turkmenistan, be given equal status with the Quran (mosques were required to display the two books side by side). The book was heavily promoted as part of the former president's personality cult, and knowledge of the Ruhnama is required even for obtaining a driver's license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3528746.stm |title=Asia-Pacific &amp;#124; Turkmen drivers face unusual test |publisher=BBC News |date=2 August 2004 |accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United Nations Angola Verification Mission III''' is a [[peacekeeping]] mission that began operating in [[Angola]] in February 1995 during [[Angolan Civil War|the civil war]].&lt;ref name="dates"&gt;Meisler, Stanley. ''United Nations: The First Fifty Years'', 1997. Page 369.&lt;/ref&gt; It was established by the [[United Nations Security Council]] in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 976|Resolution 976]].

The Indian Army contributed to this UN mission by deploying one infantry battalion group (1000 personnel) and one Engineers company group (200 pers). There were a total of six infantry battalion groups operating in distinct regions of Angola, during this period (One each from India, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Brazil, Bangladesh and Uruguay and also one battalion from Romania). The mandate of the Indian Infantry Battalion group was to ensure ceasefire between the Angolan Army and the UNITA rebels (who had control over more than half the country at that time), and then arrange for a safe "quartering" of these UNITA rebels once they laid down their arms. Subsequently, most of the arterial routes connecting major regions of the country were physically opened to traffic after demining them. The Indian Army initially sent 14 Punjab as the infantry component and later replaced it with 16 Guards.
