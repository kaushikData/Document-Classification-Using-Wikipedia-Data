The '''Ababda''' or '''Ababde''' – the '''Gebadei''' of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], and possibly the '''[[Troglodytae|Troglodytes]]''' of other classical writers – are [[nomad]]s living in the area between the [[Nile]] and the [[Red Sea]], in the vicinity of [[Aswan]] in [[Egypt]] and north Sudan.  They are a subgroup of the [[Beja people]] who are bilingual in [[Beja language|Beja]] and [[Arabic]].

==Overview==
[[File:14 Ababda (9) C.jpg|thumb|left|Ababda bedouin in Wadi um Ghamis (1961)]]
The Ababda extend from the [[Nile]] at [[Aswan]] to the [[Red Sea]], and reach northward to the [[Qena]]-Quseir road, thus occupying the southern border of [[Egypt]] east of the Nile. They call themselves "sons of the Jinns." With some of the clans of the [[Bisharin]] and possibly the [[Hadendoa]], they represent the [[Blemmyes]] of classic geographers, and their location today is almost identical with that assigned them in [[ancient Rome|Roman]] times.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abābda|volume=1|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sheikh Hasan Aly Mustafa.png|thumb|upright|Sheikh Hasan Aly Mustafa of the Ababda Beja.]]
They were constantly at war with the Romans, who eventually conquered them. In the Middle Ages, they were known as Beja, and convoyed pilgrims from the Nile valley to [[‘Aydhab|Aidhab]], the port of embarkation for [[Jeddah]]. From time immemorial, they have acted as guides to caravans through the [[Nubia]]n desert and up the Nile valley as far as Sennar. They intermarried with the [[Nubians]], and settled in small colonies at [[Shendi]] and elsewhere up to [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali's]] conquest of the region in the early 19th century. They are still great trade carriers, and visit very distant districts.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2925">'''Al-Mansur an-Nasir''' (died 1462) was an [[imam]] of the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] state in [[Yemen]] who held power in parts of the northern Yemeni highland in 1436-1462.

The old imam [[al-Mansur Ali bin Salah ad-Din]] died from the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] in 1436. His position was then claimed by three different [[Sayyid]]s, of which one was al-Mansur an-Nasir. He was the great-great-grandson of the imam [[al-Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar bin Yahya]] (d. 1298).&lt;ref&gt;Imam Zaid bin Ali Cultural Foundation, http://www.izbacf.org/page_display.php?book_id=37&amp;page_num=51 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726200941/http://www.izbacf.org/page_display.php?book_id=37&amp;page_num=51 |date=2011-07-26 }} (in Arabic). The descent line is al-Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar - Ahmad - an-Nasir - Muhammad - al-Mansur an Nasir.&lt;/ref&gt; The two other competitors were [[al-Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar]] (d. 1474) and [[al-Mahdi Salah ad-Din]] (d. 1445). Al-Mansur an-Nasir tried to strengthen his claim by marrying the granddaughter of al-Mansur Ali.&lt;ref&gt;''Enzyklopädie des Islam'', Vol. III, Leiden 1936,, p. 1219. Another text says that his mother Maryam was the daughter of al-Mansur Ali; see http://www.izbacf.org/page_display.php?book_id=37&amp;page_num=51 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726200941/http://www.izbacf.org/page_display.php?book_id=37&amp;page_num=51 |date=2011-07-26 }} (in Arabic).&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the once powerful [[Rasulid Dynasty]] in lowland Yemen was quickly crumbling, and fell altogether in 1454. The new [[Sunni]] lowland regime was the [[Tahirids (Yemen)|Tahiride]] Dynasty, which was engaged in warfare with the imam from its inception. Nevertheless, it was internal Zaidi dissention that finally toppled the position of al-Mansur an-Nasir. The important city [[San'a]] was eventually acquired by his rival al-Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar, later to be conquered by the Tahirides in 1462.&lt;ref&gt;Lein O. Schuman, ''Political History of the Yemen at the Beginning of the 16th Century''. Groningen 1960, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Mansur an-Nasir himself was captured by tribesmen east of [[Dhamar, Yemen|Dhamar]] and handed over to al-Mutawakkil. He was placed in custody in [[Kawkaban]] and died there, still a prisoner, in 1462.&lt;ref&gt;Zaidi biographies, http://www.al-aalam.com/personinfo.asp?pid=1701 (in Arabic).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[imamate]] was subsequently claimed by his son [[al-Mu’ayyad Muhammad]].

'''Al-Mutawakkil Isma'il''' (c. 1610 – 15 August 1676) was an Imam of [[Yemen]] who ruled the country from 1644 until 1676. He was a son of [[Al-Mansur al-Qasim]]. His rule saw the biggest territorial expansion of the [[Zaidiyyah]] [[imamate]] in [[Greater Yemen]].

==Early reign==

Al-Mutawakkil Isma'il was the son of the founder of the Qasimid imamate, [[al-Mansur al-Qasim]]. In 1644 his elder brother [[al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad]] died. With his death, fraternal strife broke out, as several brothers competed for the [[imamate]]. In the end, the other brothers submitted to Isma'il. In Zaidi sources, his reign is portrayed in exceedingly positive terms. Yemen was restored to prosperity as the farmers enjoyed excellent harvests. His rule was considered just and incorruptible. Nevertheless, in 1648 a dispute arose between the imam and the various [[ulema]] over taxation policy. As Ismail managed to uphold public order in the deeply localized and factionalized Yemeni society, merchants ventured to visit Yemen from other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. Serjeant]] &amp; R. Lewcock, ''San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City''. London 1983, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The coffee trade that went through [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]] had been going on for some time and gave the imam's government increased revenues.

==Conquest of Hadramaut==

The authority of al-Mutawakkil Isma'il expanded eastwards along the South Arabian coast. Aden had been conquered by Yemeni forces in 1644.&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Gavin, ''Aden under British Rule, 1839-1967.'' London 1975, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1654, a struggle for the throne in the [[Kathiri]] area provided the imam with an excuse to send a sizable army into the [[Hadramaut]]. The [[Yafa]] tribesmen submitted, as did the Kathiri sultan. A further expedition in 1658 renewed the suzerainty of the imam in an area as far east as [[Dhofar]]. However, the conquest of Hadramaut resulted in a military confrontation with Sultan bin Saif, the sultan of [[Oman]]. Being in control of the seas in these areas, the Omanis were able to raid Yemen. Insecurity at sea led to a decrease in goods being imported into the Yemeni seaports.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Stookey, ''Yemen; The Politics of the Yemen Arab Republic''. Boulder 1978, p. 146; R. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, pp. 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomatic relations==

Yemen in the 17th century was not a very outward-looking society, but its role as virtually the sole [[coffee]] producer of the world made it a vital link in the [[Indian Ocean]] trading system.&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Gavin, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Mutawakkil Isma'il's reign saw a number of diplomatic ties with other powers around the periphery of the [[Indian Ocean]]. An [[Ethiopia]]n embassy visited the imam in 1646, and a Yemeni return visit took place in the following year. With [[Mughal India]] there were likewise friendly contacts. [[Surat]] on the Indian west coast was the principal trading partner of Yemen at this time. The [[Ottoman Empire]], which had lost control over Yemen in 1635, planned a renewed attack in 1674.  However, this was abandoned over their fear of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] power.&lt;ref&gt;R. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, pp. 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior policy==

Although he was the most resourceful of the Qasimid line, al-Mutawakkil Isma'il had to contend with the deep localism persisting in the Yemeni society, in particular among the highland tribes. Some tribes were not taxed, but on the contrary received stipends to keep quiet. This was a practice that prevailed until the 20th century. The imam himself is reputed to have lived a life of [[Sparta]]n simplicity; he would sew and sell caps for his subsistence, and his household consisted of his one wife and a female slave.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Playfair, ''A History of Arabia Felix or Yemen''. Bombay 1859, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the imam's reign, he quelled what he thought was a rebellion against the Yemeni state, led by the Jewish leader of a [[Sabbatean]] sect, Suleiman Jamal. Although the imam resided in al-Suda, he was informed by the governor of [[Sana'a]] about the man's actions (i.e. he had tried to usurp authority) and the man was immediately sentenced to die.&lt;ref&gt;ʻAbd Allah ibn ʻAlī ibn al-Wazīr, ''Ṭibāq al-Ḥulwā wa-Ṣihāf al-Mān wa-l-Salwā'' (Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.S. van Köningsveld, J. Sadan, and Q. Al-Samarrai, ''Yemenite Authorities and Jewish Messianism: Aḥmad ibn Nāṣir al-Zaydī's Account of the Sabbatian Movement in Seventeenth Century Yemen and its Aftermath'', Leiden, Leiden University 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The imam then made it more difficult for his Jewish subjects by confiscating their property and by prohibiting them from owning land.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Tobi, ''The Jews of Yemen'' (''Studies in Their History and Culture''), Brill: Leiden 1999, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Mutawakkil Isma'il died in 1676, and a dispute arose between two of his nephews over the succession. Of these, [[al-Mahdi Ahmad]] finally succeeded to the imamate.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Stookey, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Berta''' or '''Bertha''' are an ethnic group living along the border of [[Sudan]] and [[Ethiopia]]. They speak a [[Nilo-Saharan language]] that is not related to those of their Nilo-Saharan neighbors ([[Gumuz people|Gumuz]], [[Uduk people|Uduk]]). Their total Ethiopian population is about 183,000 people.

== History ==
Their origins are to be found in eastern Sudan, in the area of the former [[Funj sultanate of Sinnar]] (1521-1804). During the 16th or 17th century, they migrated to western Ethiopia, in the area of the modern [[Benishangul-Gumuz Region]]. "Benishangul" is an Arabicized form of the original name ''Bela Shangul'', meaning "Rock of Shangul". This refers to a sacred stone located in a mountain in the [[Menge (woreda)|Menge]] [[woreda]], one of the places where the Berta originally settled when they arrived to Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;On the "Rock of Shangul", see Alessandro Triulzi, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/181098 "Trade, Islam, and the Mahdia in Northwestern Wallagga, Ethiopia", ''Journal of African History''], 16 (1975), p. 57 and the sources there cited.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their arrival in Ethiopia was marked by strong territorial conflict among the diverse shangul communities. For this reason, and for protecting themselves from slave raids coming from Sudan, the shangul communities  decided to establish their villages in naturally-defended hills and mountains, amidst rocky outcrops. Due to this harsh topography, houses and granaries were raised over stone pillars. German traveler [[Ernst Marno]] described shangul architecture and villages in his ''Reisen im Gebiete des Blauen und Weissen Nil'' (Vienna, 1874). The shangul of Benishangul were incorporated into Ethiopia only in 1896.

After conflicts and raids receded during the 20th century, the Shangul people moved to the valleys, where their villages are located today. During the 19th century, the area of Benishangul was divided in several sheikhdoms (Fadasi, Komosha, Gizen, [[Asosa Sultanate|Asosa]]), the most powerful of which was ruled by Sheikh Khoyele at the end of the 19th century.

== Customs ==
After several centuries of Arab Sudanese influence, the Berta are now mostly Muslim and many speak fluent [[Arabic]]. Due to their intermarriage with Arab traders, some Berta were called ''Watawit'' -the local name for "bat", meaning that they were a mix of two very different groups. However, they still have traditional customs that are similar to those of their Nilo-Saharan neighbors. For example, there still exist ritual specialists called ''neri'', who have healing and divination powers. They are the ones who know how to deal with evil spirits (''shuman''). Rain-making rituals are also found among the Berta, as among other Nilo-Saharan and Nilotic communities.

In their wedding ceremonies music is played by males with large calabash trumpets (''was'a''). The groom arrives to the wedding on a donkey and carrying a ''bang'' (throwing stick) in his hand. After the wedding, the husband has to build a hut and live in his wife's village for a year or more, tilling their father-in-law's land. Divorce is accepted. The Berta decorate their faces with scarifications, usually three vertical lines on each cheek, which they consider to be symbols of God (each line is interpreted as the initial letter of Allah, the Arabic ''alif'').

The Berta are slash-and-burn agriculturalists. Their staple food is [[sorghum]], with which they make porridge in ceramic vessels. They also make beer with sorghum. Beer is prepared in large ceramic containers called ''awar'' and ''is'u''. Working parties play an important role in Berta society. When somebody wants to build a house or cultivate a field, he calls his neighbors for help and provides beer and food.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3093">The '''Bill against Pornography and Porno-Action''' ({{lang-id|'''Rancangan Undang-Undang Anti Pornografi dan Pornoaksi'''}}) (sometimes translated as '''Bill against Pornography and Pornographic Acts''') was a bill proposed by the [[Indonesia]]n legislative assembly, [[Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat]] on February 14, 2006. 

A similar bill was discussed and unsuccessfully presented in the 1990s but was withdrawn in the face of opposition.&lt;ref name=InsideIndo&gt;[A law on pornography still divides the community {{cite web |url=http://www.insideindonesia.org/edition-94/hot-debates |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217010311/http://www.insideindonesia.org/edition-94/hot-debates |archivedate=2011-02-17 |df= }}], Inside Indonesia, Helen Pausacker&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005-06 bill attracted extensive opposition and was dropped, only to be reintroduced in 2008 as the Bill on Pornography.&lt;ref name=InsideIndo/&gt; The bill states that anyone engaging in [[pornography]] and ''pornoaction'' is punishable by law, ''pornoaction'' being an invented word that means "actions deemed indecent." This includes, but is not limited to, public acts such as spouses kissing,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,501060410-1179416,00.html Indonesia's Skin Wars - TIME&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; women showing their navels or shoulders, and people sunbathing in [[bikini]]s or [[swimwear]].

This bill provoked a severe negative reaction from many people who believed that the government is trying to limit their freedom. Several public demonstrations ensued both by people who supported (the [[Prosperous Justice Party]] (PKS) and Muslim religious leaders) and those who rejected the bill as too broad-ranging and a restriction on personal freedom.

The bill was passed into an Act on 30 October 2008 as Law No. 44 of 2008 on Pornography.&lt;ref name=InsideIndo/&gt;

In 2010 the anti-pornography law was challenged but Indonesia's Constitutional Court upheld the ban and stated that the law's definition of pornography was clear and did not violate the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8586749.stm BBC News - Indonesia upholds anti-pornography bill]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Buru people''' ({{lang-id|Suku Buru}}) is an ethnic group mostly living on [[Indonesia]]n island [[Buru]], as well as on some other [[Maluku Islands]]. They also call themselves '''Gebfuka''' or  '''Gebemliar''', which literally means "people of the world" or "people of the land". Buru people are related to the eastern Indonesian anthropological group and from an ethnographic point of view are similar to other indigenous peoples of the island Buru. They speak [[Buru language]].&lt;ref name="Etno" /&gt;&lt;ref name="etnologue" /&gt;

==Distribution  ==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Inwoners van het dorp Waepote voor een huis op het eiland Boeroe TMnr 10005850.jpg|thumb|Traditional Buru house of the early 1900s.]]
About 33,000 of 35,000 Buru people live on the island of Buru; they make about a quarter of the island population (about 135,000 as of 2009) and are the most numerous ethnicity of Buru; about 2,000 live on [[Ambon Island]] and several hundred are scattered over other islands in the Indonesian province of [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]] and the capital [[Jakarta]]. There is a small Buru community in the [[Netherlands]] formed by the descendants of the soldiers of  [[Republic of South Moluccas]] ({{lang-id|Republik Maluku Selatan}}) who moved there after the accession of this self-proclaimed state in Indonesia in 1950.&lt;ref name="etnologue" /&gt;

Buru people are evenly spread over Buru island, except for some parts of the northern coast and the central mountainous part which is sparsely populated. Their relative fraction is somewhat lower in the towns, such as [[Namrole]] and [[Namlea]], owing to inflow of people of other Indonesian ethnicities.&lt;ref name = "Tribes" /&gt; In the initial period of the Dutch colonization of the island in the middle of the 17th century, much of the tribal nobility of Buru was moved to the eastern part and later became one of the components in the [[ethnogenesis]] of ethnic [[Kayeli people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Reuter|title=Sharing the Earth, Dividing the Land: Land and Territory in the Austronesian World|year=2006|contribution=|publisher=ANU E Press|isbn=19-209-4270-X|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several ethnic groups are distinguished within Buru people, which differ in lifestyle and language specifics – ''Rana'' (14,258 people mainly in the central part of the island), Masarete (about 9,600 people mainly in the south), Wae Sama (6,622 people mostly in the south-east) and Fogi (about 500 people in the west).&lt;ref name="Tribes" /&gt;

== Language ==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Demonstraties van speerwerpen en vechten met zwaard en schild door mannen in een dorp op Boeroe. TMnr 60045885.jpg|thumb|Buru people demonstrating spearing techniques.]]
The nation speaks [[Buru language]], which belongs to the Central Maluku branch of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]].&lt;ref name="etnologue" /&gt; Three dialects are distinguished according to the major ethnic groups of Rana, Masarete and Wae Sama. In addition, some 3,000–5,000 of Rana people along with their main dialect use the so-called "secret dialect" ''Ligahan''. The western dialect ''Fogi'' is now extinct.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;Thomas Edward Dutton, [[Darrell Tryon|Darrell T. Tryon]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=xOlI8czLshIC&amp;pg=PA276 Language contact and change in the Austronesian world], Walter de Gruyter (1994) {{ISBN|3110127865}} pp. 276 ff&lt;/ref&gt; Lexical differences between the dialects are relatively small: about 90% between Masarete and Wae Sama, 88% between Masarete and Rana and 80% between Wae Sama and Rana. Apart from native vernaculars, most Buru people, especially in the coastal regions and towns have command of the official language of the country, Indonesian. The coastal population also uses the [[Ambonese Malay|Ambonese language]], which is a creolized form of Malay with additions of the local lexicon.&lt;ref name="Etno" /&gt;&lt;ref name="etnologue" /&gt;

== Religion ==
Religiously, Buru people are divided into comparable fractions of [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]], who mostly live in the north of the island, and [[Christianity|Christians]]-[[Protestantism|Protestants]] in the south. Remnants of traditional local beliefs persist almost everywhere, and in the central areas of the island many openly profess the cult of the supreme deity ''Opo Hebe Snulat'' and his messenger ''Nabiat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boombastis.com/animisme-dan-dinamisme/41629 |title=Animisme dan Dinamisme di Indonesia dan Suku-Suku yang Masih Menganutnya |author=Tetalogi |publisher=Boombastis |date=2015 |accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economical crisis of the 1990s resulted in frequent conflicts among Buru people over religious grounds. So within a few days in December 1999, 43 people were killed and at least 150 houses burned in the Wainibe village.&lt;ref name="ham1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "ham2" /&gt;

== Lifestyle ==
Most Buru people are engaged in farming [[rice]], [[millet]], [[sago]], [[sweet potato]] and various spice, such as [[allspice]], [[nutmeg]] and [[Eucalyptus]] tree, which is used for aromatic oil. In the inland areas, they also hunt the wild pig [[Buru babirusa]], deer and [[Phalanger|possum]], and take part in tuna fishing on the coast.&lt;ref name="Etno" /&gt; In the urban areas, the growing number of Buru people take jobs in the industrial enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Reuter|title=Sharing the Earth, Dividing the Land: Land and Territory in the Austronesian World|year=2006|contribution=|publisher=ANU E Press|isbn=19-209-4270-X|pages=150–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Buru houses are made from bamboo, often on stilts. The roofs are covered with palm leaves or reeds, with tiles becoming progressively popular. Traditional Buru clothing is similar that of many other Indonesia peoples. Men wear [[sarong]] (a kind of [[kilt]]) and a long-skirted tunic, and women are dressed in sarong and a shorter jacket. However, the colors and decor items differ quite substantially among Masarete, Wae Sama and Rana. Traditional Buru weapons are straight machete (parang) and a short spear. In the past, Buru hunters were famed for their spear throwing skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307215235/http://www.kompasiana.com/asrim/memelihara-calon-istri-sejak-bayi_54f5cd30a33311171f8b45c3 |title=Memelihara Calon Istri sejak Bayi|author=Muhammad Asri Amin|publisher=Kompas|date=20 September 2014|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buru people, along with the Muslim or Christian names, also use traditional ones, the most common being Lesnussa, Latbual, Nurlatu, Lehalima, Wael and Sigmarlatu.

The '''Buyang people''' are an officially unrecognized [[Kra peoples|Kra ethnic group]] living in [[Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture|Wenshan Prefecture]], [[Yunnan]] and [[Napo County]], [[Guangxi]] in [[China]]. They are closely related to the [[Laha people|Laha]], [[Qabiao people|Qabiao]], [[Gelao people|Gelao]], and [[Lachi people|Lachi]]. The [[Buyang language]] is spoken, although many Buyang are now shifting to [[Zhuang language|Zhuang]] and [[Southwestern Mandarin]]. In [[Yunnan]], the Buyang are classified by the Chinese government as [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]], while they are classified as [[Yao people|Yao]] in [[Guangxi]] (Li 2006).

==Names==
The name Buyang comes from the [[Standard Zhuang|Zhuang]] ''pu22 jaaŋ24'' (alternatively ''pu22 ȵaaŋ24''), which means "other people." The Buyang of [[Napo County]], [[Guangxi]] call themselves the ''ʔia33 hrɔŋ53'', while [[Guangnan County|Guangnan]] Buyang call themselves ''pa33 ha33''. In  [[Napo County|Napo]] and [[Jingxi County|Jingxi]] counties, many Zhuang are called "Buyang" by other Zhuang groups. In southeastern Guizhou and Tianlin, Longlin, and Xilin counties of Guangxi, many villages also contain the word ''yang'' 央, suggesting that those villages may be formerly Buyang-speaking areas that had been assimilated by the [[Zhuang people]].

The Buyang of Guangnan County and Funing County are officially classified as [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]], while those in [[Napo County]] are classified as [[Yao people|Yao]]. This is because Buyang clothing appears similar to [[Yao people|Yao]] clothing, and many Zhuangs and Hans have mistaken the Buyang as [[Yao people|Yao]] and have called them:

*Tu Yao 土瑶, "native Yao"
*Tie Yao 铁瑶, "Iron Yao"
*Liu Yao 六瑶, "Six Yao"

The Buyang of [[Napo County]] are also called the Liu Yao 六瑶 ("Six Yao") because they used to live in six villages (Li &amp; Luo 2010). According to the ''Napo County Almanac'' (那坡县志), this exonym dates back to the [[Qing Dynasty]], when the "Six Yao" lived in the villages of Nianyi 念益, Guolie 果列, Yancun 燕村, Rongtun 荣屯, Gonghe 共和, and Shanhe 善合.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gxdqw.com/bin/mse.exe?seachword=&amp;K=c&amp;A=18&amp;rec=46&amp;run=13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Traditional Buyang clothing resembles that of the [[Gelao people|Gelao]] and [[Lachi people|Lachi]] peoples, although many have now switched to Zhuang-style clothing. Today, most Buyang celebrate Zhuang festivals, although the Guangnan Buyang (or Paha) celebrate the Dragon-Worshiping Festival and the Yin Day, or New Year, Festival.

==History==
The Buyang people may have originally migrated to their present locations in [[Yunnan]] and [[Guangxi]] from [[Guizhou]] province in the north, which is now occupied by the [[Gelao people]]. Various types of historical evidence suggest that the Buyang were much more populous in the past. For instance, many village names in [[Xilin County]], [[Longlin County]], and [[Napo County]] begin with Yāng (央 or 秧), suggesting that they may have formerly been Buyang-speaking areas from at least the [[Qing Dynasty]]. Today, the dominant languages in these areas are [[Bouyei language|Bouyei]] and [[Yang Zhuang language|Yang Zhuang]]. Li (1999) states that the following counties were formerly inhabited by Buyang speakers, but no longer have any:

The majority resided in the [[Hongshui River]] (Hongshui He 红水河) valley. Today, the river serves as a border between northwestern [[Guangxi]] and southwestern [[Guizhou]].

A legend among the Buyang of Guangxi recounts that once there were three Buyang brothers living in poverty. One stayed in Guangxi, another went to Yunnan to escape poverty, and yet another migrated to northern Vietnam. The third brother who migrated to Vietnam could have been the ancestor of the [[En language|En]] (Nung Ven) or the [[Qabiao people]].

A [[Qing dynasty|Qing]]-era chronicle had also mentioned a people called the Puyang 普央 living in Guangnan (Li &amp; Luo 2010).

According to Holm (2003:15),&lt;ref name="Holm2003"&gt;Holm, David. 2003. ''[http://texts.00.gs/Zhuang_Cosmological_text,_1.htm Killing a buffalo for the ancestors: a Zhuang cosmological text from Southwest China]''. DeKalb, IL: Southeast Asia Publications, Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Northern Illinois University.&lt;/ref&gt; the Buyang used to build [[hanging coffins]], including hanging coffins on cliffs above a large bend in the [[Hongshui River]] near Banwen village 板文村, Sihe Township 四合乡, [[Donglan County]], [[Guangxi]].

:The Buyang are reported to have been "banished to 'the edge of the sky and the corner of the sea,' that is, much further south, after a losing a contest of wits with the Bouyei’s apical ancestor Baeu Rodo. Even now, however, when the wind blows at night the villagers still light lamps, because otherwise the returning ghosts of the Buyang will mistake their houses for caves, and fly into them. On such nights women’s clothing is festooned on trees, as a way of keeping the spirits of the Buyang at bay. &amp;mdash; quoted from Holm (2003:15)&lt;ref name="Holm2003"/&gt;

Holm (2003:159-160)&lt;ref name="Holm2003"/&gt; reports that the Buyang continue to exist in the legends of the [[Zhuang people]] of [[Donglan County]], [[Guangxi]] and the [[Buyi people]] of [[Xingyi, Guizhou]].

:The Buyang themselves say that their ancestors came from Guangdong and Guangxi. In fact, traces of the Buyang are widespread. In the former [[Xingyi, Guizhou|Xingyi]] prefecture in southwestern Guizhou, and in Xilong sub-prefecture in far northwestern Guangxi, there are numerous names of villages and stockades that contain 'yang' as an element. The majority of inhabitants of this area call themselves either Bouyei or Zhuang. According to local legends, however, it was the Buyang who originally opened up the area and constructed the paddy fields. This circumstance is still commemorated each year on the 6th day of the 6th lunar month, when the local Zhuang and Bouyei kill a chicken and present offerings of wine in the fields to the "Buyang rice-fields," commemorating the Buyang and thereby praying for an abundant harvest. &amp;mdash; quoted from Holm (2003:159-160)&lt;ref name="Holm2003"/&gt;

'''Chindu Bhagavatam'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/theatre/chindu-bhagavatam-comes-of-age/article3839122.ece The Hindu Chindu Bhagavatham]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMTcVmQmkb8 Youtube Chindu Bhagavatham]&lt;/ref&gt; is a drama type art which is very near to [[Yakshagana]]m and this is widely performed in [[Telangana]], [[India]]. The art form has evolved over time from being restricted to a small sub-sect within a community to being performed all over the region and utilised by the State government.

==History==
The art goes that within the ‘[[Madiga]]’ community, a sect considered itself ‘Pedda Madiga’ (Big madiga) and another sect that was living on begging, performing yakshaganas, as ‘Chinna Madigas’, (Small madiga). These Chindu Bhagavatas were not permitted to perform beyond their own community. A lot has changed since then. Chindu Yellamma, a respected icon from Nizamabad, was invited to perform with her troupe at [[Ravindra Bharathi]] by the erstwhile Dance Academy headed by [[Nataraja Ramakrishna]]. The academy had also published a small booklet on this art and the Chindu Bhagavatas at that time. 

The word ‘Chindu’ in Telugu means ‘jump’. As their presentation is interspersed with leaps and jumps, it gained the name of Chindu Bhagavatam. Most of the stories narrated are from ‘[[Bhagavata]]m’. Gaddam Sammayya, a leader of these troupes, claims that though the Chindu Bhagavatas were seen as a lowly section of society, they trace their origin to Jamba Mahamuni, and believe their clan is the most ancient sect. “Hence most of our dramas open with 'Jamba Puranam' with the opening pallavi that goes ‘Ekkuvani Mari Palukabokumura, Ekkuvevvaru Mari Telisi Palukumura’ (don’t speak of being high, speak knowing who is higher),” he says.

==Present==
Contemporary plays based on the Bhagavata were passed down generations orally until writers like Chevirala Bhagayya, Jilla Venkatadasu, Burugupally Venkatanarasayya Panthulu, Yadavadasu wrote some plays on new themes, made the script more sophisticated, adding some verses to meter thus making it a full-fledged theatrical performance. “Some of us are educated up to ‘Peddabalasiksha’ and can read the script and memorise it,” Sammayya informs.

Currently there are 800 Chindu Bhagavatam troupes , each troupe is made skilled performers , typically all male. Everyone is trained in the art of make up, singing and playing musical instruments like harmonium, cymbals and Dholak. Sammayya says every family of their caste gets trained in the Yakshagana prakriya. “We spend our lives in learning and staging many mythological themes. Believe us, we are armed with more than 300 themes,” he claims. They learn to render songs and verses and verbal dramatic bits. All skill performers are in Yakshagana format. The stage for them is any special place in a village - be it under trees or at cross roads. People come in large numbers to watch. Sometimes they present ‘Gadies’ of Deshmukhs or ‘Chavadi Kottaalu’ you find in rural areas in the Telangana region. Plays run throughout the night till dawn. Makeup is done on the spot.

They keep a picture of Goddess Yellamma before them and move around the villages to collect whatever the villagers give, be they clothes or food. Generally they avoid performances in monsoon season. When not performing, they work as farm labour or do fishing and rope making. Thanks to the Government’s developmental and welfare programmes, the services of Chindu Bhagavatas are borrowed to propagate programmes like protection of environment, sanitation, family planning, literacy, awareness of TB, AIDS and so on. They incorporate these messages as a part of the Yakshaganam to make them entertaining, says Sammayya. “We are able to survive because of the remuneration government gives us for this”, he says.
The State Culture Council and department of Culture have promised to give pension to old and indigent artistes of Chindu Bhagavatulu and also send these troupes to other parts of the state. However, the immediate help they can render is to fund for their costumes and accessories. However they plead for houses as part of ‘Gruha Samaudaya Pathakam’ (group housing
scheme) in different mandals in the Telangana region.

[[Christianity]] is one of the recognized religions in [[Israel]] and is practiced, as of December 2016, by more than 169,000 Israeli citizens (about 2.0% of the population). They include 133,000 [[Arab Christians]] who are mostly adherents of the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church]] (about 60% of Israeli Christians)&lt;ref name="MFA2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/AboutIsrael/Spotlight/Pages/The-Christian-communities-in-Israel-May-2014.aspx |title=The Christian communities in Israel |website=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |date=1 May 2014 |accessdate=3 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017004653/http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/AboutIsrael/Spotlight/Pages/The-Christian-communities-in-Israel-May-2014.aspx |archivedate=17 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem|Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem]], as well as [[Latin Church|Latin Rite Catholics]], with small numbers of [[Maronites in Israel|Maronites]], [[Arameans in Israel|Arameans]], [[Copts]], and Protestants, about 25,000 [[Russians in Israel|Orthodox Christians from the former Soviet Union]] ([[Russian Orthodox]]) and smaller minorities of [[Assyrians in Israel|Assyrians]] and [[Armenians in Israel|Armenians]]. A certain number of Israelis also practice [[Messianic Judaism]]—usually considered a [[Religious syncretism|syncretist]] form of Christianity, with estimates of several thousands, but exact numbers of such are not available.

About 80% of Christian residents of Israel are [[Arab Christians]], who are historically bound with neighbouring [[Christianity in Lebanon|Lebanese]], [[Christianity in Syria|Syrian]], and [[Palestinian Christians]]. A community of 1,000 Coptic Christians also exists in Israel, being registered as "Arab Christians", though their [[Coptic identity|Arab identity is disputed]]. [[Christian Arabs]] are one of the most educated groups in Israel. ''[[Maariv (newspaper)|Maariv]]'' has described the Christian Arabs sector as "the most successful in the education system",&lt;ref name="Maariv"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/319/566.html |title=המגזר הערבי נוצרי הכי מצליח במערכת החינוך |website=Nrg.co.il |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; since Christian Arabs fared the best in terms of education in comparison to any other group receiving an education in Israel.&lt;ref name="StrongInEducation"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4323529,00.html |title= Christians in Israel: Strong in education |website= Yneynews.com  |accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 25,000 (the majority of the remaining) are immigrants from the former Soviet Union, who immigrated with Jewish relatives due to mixed marriages; there are also smaller ethnoreligious affiliations of about 7,000 [[Maronites in Israel|Maronites]] (some of whom are recorded in Israel as "Arab Christians" and others as "[[Arameans in Israel|Aramean Christians]]") and 1,000 [[Assyrians in Israel|Assyrians]].

There are approximately 300 Christians who have converted from Islam according to one 2014 estimate, and most of them are part of the Roman Catholic church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Duane Alexander|title=FREEDOM OF RELIGION IN ISRAEL-PALESTINE: MAY MUSLIMS BECOME CHRISTIANS, AND DO CHRISTIANS HAVE THE FREEDOM TO WELCOME SUCH CONVERTS?|journal=St Francis Magazine|date=April 2014|volume=10|issue=1|pages=17–24|url=https://www.academia.edu/6928461/Freedom_of_Religion_in_Israel-Palestine_may_Muslims_become_Christians_and_do_Christians_have_the_freedom_to_welcome_such_converts_}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten Christian churches are formally recognized under Israel's confessional system, for the self-regulation and state recognition of status issues, such as [[marriage in Israel|marriage and divorce]]: the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], the [[Armenian Catholic Church]], the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], the [[Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East|Episcopal Church]], the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], the [[Latin Church]], the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church]], the [[Syriac Catholic Church]], the [[Syriac Maronite Church]], and the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]].{{cn|date=November 2017}} However, the practice of religion is free, with no restrictions on the practice of other denominations.

==History==
[[File:Yardenit - Jordan River.JPG|thumb|Yardenit, [[Jordan River]] baptismal site]]
{{see also|Jerusalem in Christianity}}
According to historical and traditional sources, [[Jesus]] lived in [[Roman Judea]], and died and was buried on the site of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City Jerusalem]]  making the area a [[Holy Land]] for Christianity. However, few [[Christian]]s now live in the region, compared to Muslims and Jews. This is mainly because Islam displaced Christianity throughout the Middle East, and the rise of modern [[Zionism]] and the establishment of the State of Israel has seen millions of Jews emigrate to Israel.

The Christian population in Israel has increased significantly with the immigration of many [[Interfaith marriage|mixed families]] from the former Soviet Union (1989-late 1990s) and by the influx of some 10,000 [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Christian Maronites]] from Lebanon in 2000.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Recently a further increase in Christianity came with arrival of many foreign workers and asylum seekers, some of Christian background (for instance from the Philippines and South Sudan). As a result, numerous churches have opened in [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref&gt;Adriana Kemp &amp; Rebeca Raijman, "Christian Zionists in the Holy Land: Evangelical Churches, Labor Migrants, and the Jewish State", ''Identities: Global Studies in Power and Culture'', 10:3, 295-318 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Affiliations==
As of December 2013, about 161,000 Israeli citizens practiced Christianity, together comprising about 2% of the total population.&lt;ref name="MFA2014"/&gt; The largest group consists of Melkites (about 60% of Israel's Christians), followed by the Greek Orthodox (about 30%), with the remaining ca. 10% spread between the Roman Catholic (Latin), Maronite, Anglican, Lutheran, Armenian, Syriac, Ethiopian, Coptic and other denominations.&lt;ref name="MFA2014"/&gt; 

===Catholic Church===
{{Main article|Catholic Church in Israel}}

Six of the [[particular church]]es of the [[Catholic Church]] have jurisdiction within Israel: the [[Latin Church]] (the dominant Catholic church worldwide), the [[Armenian Catholic Church]], the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church]], the [[Syriac Catholic Church]], and the [[Syriac Maronite Church]]. 60% of Christians in Israel are Melkites.&lt;ref name="MFA2014"/&gt;

{{main|Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem}}
A large portion of Christians in Israel are adherents of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. There are two Eastern Orthodox ecclesiastical jurisdictions on the territory of Israel: [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem]] (covering central and southern regions) and [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch]] (covering only the most northern region). Eastern Orthodox Christians in Israel have many churches, monasteries, seminaries, and other religious institutions all over the land, particularly in [[Jerusalem]].

===Oriental Orthodox===
{{main|Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem|Monastery of Saint Mark, Jerusalem}}
[[Oriental Orthodoxy]] in Israel is represented mainly by adherents of [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], represented by [[Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem]], and adherents of [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], headed by archbishop [[Mor Severius Malke Mourad]], patriarchal exarch of [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://syriacpatriarchate.org/2016/04/statement-syriac-orthodox-patriarchate/ Syriac Orthodox Patriarchate (2016): Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestants===
There has been a small Protestant community in Israel since the foundation of the state in 1948, who are either [[Christian Arabs]] who had changed their religious affiliation to Protestant teachings or European residents moving to the area.

The [[Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East]] is a [[ecclesiastical province#Anglican Communion|province]] of the [[Anglican Communion]]. The seat of the [[Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem]] is [[St. George's Cathedral, Jerusalem]]. Other prominent Episcopal churches in Israel include [[Christ Church, Jerusalem]], built in 1849, which is inside the [[Jaffa Gate]] of the contested Old City of Jerusalem, and [[Christ Church, Nazareth]], built in 1871, both built during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Duane Alexander|title=The First Church of the Diocese of Jerusalem: A Work in Progress--or Maybe Not?|journal=Anglican and Episcopal History|date=June 2012|volume=81|issue=2|url=https://www.academia.edu/4334341/The_First_Church_of_the_Diocese_of_Jerusalem_A_Work_in_Progress_or_Maybe_Not_The_Third_Sunday_of_Advent_11_December_2011|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hebrew Christian movement====
{{main article|Hebrew Christian movement}}
The Hebrew Christian movement of the 19th and early 20th centuries consisted of Jews who converted to Christianity as a result of Protestant missionary activity. It was incorporated into the later parallel Messianic Jewish movement in the late 1960s.

====Messianic Jews====
{{main article|Messianic Judaism}}
The number of Messianic Jews in Israel is estimated at around 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154463.htm|title=2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Israel and the occupied territories|publisher=US Department of State|date=April 8, 2011|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishisrael.ning.com/page/statistics-1|publisher=Jewish Israel|date=March 2016|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with other religions==

===Christian–Jewish relations===
[[Hebrew]]-speakers call Christians as ''Notzri'' (also romanized ''Notsri''), which means [[Nazarene (title)|Nazarene]] (originated from Nazareth).&lt;ref name="Bromily"&gt;Bromiley, Geoffrey W., "Nazarene," ''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: K-P'', pp. 499–500.&lt;/ref&gt; The word is cognate to the Arabic ''[[Nasrani (Arabic term for Christian)|Nasrani]]''.

====History====
Israel's [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], issued in 1948, describes the country as a [[Jewish state]] but clearly extends religious freedoms to all of its inhabitants by stating that the State of Israel will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex; it will guarantee freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture; it will safeguard the Holy Places of all religions.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

During the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], the fate of the Christian Palestinians was similar to that of the Muslims, in term of military administration and land confiscations.&lt;ref name="books.google.fr"/&gt; However, Christian churches generally avoided destruction or defilement during the 1948/1949 Arab-Israeli War. Aware of the international attention to the conflict, [[David Ben-Gurion]] is said to have expressly forbidden to loot or defile holy places.&lt;ref name="books.google.fr"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C0czGz-oI3AC&amp;pg=PT132 |title=Palestinian Christians in Israel: State Attitudes towards Non-Muslims in a ... |author=Una McGahern |website=Books.google.com |date=2012-06-25 |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reason, Israeli authorities have a more lenient attitude to the right of return of the Christian refugees.&lt;ref name="books.google.fr"/&gt;

According to Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, since the [[reunification of Jerusalem]], the Christian as well as Jewish and Islamic holy sites were opened for multinational pilgrims by the Israeli authorities, for the first time since 1948, when the Kingdom of Jordan took over the Eastern half of the city.&lt;ref name=mfa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA_Graphics/MFA%20Gallery/Israel60/ch6.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Holy Land : Jews, Christians and Muslims |website=Mfa.gov.il |accessdate=2016-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA_Graphics/MFA%20Gallery/Israel60/ch6.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, the [[Government - Christians Forum]] was formed in Jerusalem, Israel, under the umbrella of the Ministry of Public Security, to address the concerns of the Christian leaders and representatives in Israel, and in order to empower the relations between the government and Christian leaders and representatives in Israel.

====Prosperity of Christian community====
Gabriel Naddaf argues that Israel is the only country in which Christian communities have been able to thrive in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2014/11/21/israeli-priest-gabriel-nadaf-confident-of-greater-christian-recruitment-into-idf-interview/ |title=Israeli Priest Gabriel Nadaf Confident of Greater Christian Recruitment Into IDF (INTERVIEW) &amp;#124; Jewish &amp; Israel News |website=Algemeiner.com |date=2014-11-21 |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there has also been criticism by Palestinian Christians of this claim, with such statements being called a "manipulation" of the facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bohstromyesterday |first=Philippe |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/christian-palestinians-israel-manipulating-facts-by-claiming-we-are-welcome-1.420718 |title=Christian Palestinians: Israel 'Manipulating Facts' by Claiming We Are Welcome |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2012-03-26 |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Palestinian Christian community claim that such statements attempt to hide the discrimination that Arab Christians face within Israel due to alleged discrimination against Arabs as well as the effect of the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza on the Christian population in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://imeu.org/article/discrimination-hate-crimes-against-christian-palestinians-in-the-holy-land |title=Discrimination &amp; Hate Crimes Against Christian Palestinians in the Holy Land |publisher=IMEU |date=2015-12-24 |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sons of the New Testament Party====
{{Main article|Sons of the New Testament}}
Recently, there has been a steady undercurrent of Christian Arabs who seek deeper integration into Israeli society. Under the leadership of Greek Orthodox priest [[Gabriel Naddaf]], the "[[Sons of the New Testament]]" is a political party that advocates Christian enlistment in the IDF and a more distinct societal separation of Christians from Muslims.&lt;ref name="jpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Editorials/Father-Nadaf-317867|title=Father Nadaf &amp;#124; JPost &amp;#124; Israel News|publisher=jpost.com|accessdate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This separation is partly based on the purported fact that Christians in Israel are not technically Arabs, seeing as they were present in the holy land long before the Arab conquest, hallmarked by the [[Siege of Jerusalem (637)|Siege of Jerusalem]]. This distinction is in the process of being formalized into law, as the Likud government is currently drafting legislation to grant this request.&lt;ref name="theway"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theway.co.uk/news-9441-historic-new-law-gives-boost-to-christians-in-israel|title=Historic new law gives boost to Christians in Israel &amp;#124; The Way, Christianity without walls|publisher=theway.co.uk|accessdate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new attitude is founded largely by the perception by some that only in Israel the Christian population is growing due to natural increase and no state persecution, seeing the entire Middle East, except Lebanon, as where Christianity is and has been rapidly on the decline. In addition, increasing numbers of Christian leaders and community members are pointing to Muslim violence as a threat to their way of life in Arab majority cities and towns.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303849604579278722657163880|title=Israel&amp;#39;s Christian Awakening - WSJ.com|publisher=online.wsj.com|accessdate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sons of the New Testament as a party and a national movement has been met with wide admiration from the Jews of Israel, harshly negative scorn from the Muslim Arabs, and mixed reactions from the Christians themselves. Because of Israel's parliamentary system where each party must attain at least 2% of the popular vote, Sons of the New Testament must be supported by non-Christians to enter the [[Knesset]].

==== Interfaith institutions ====
In 2008, Rabbi [[Shlomo Riskin]], the chief rabbi of [[Efrat]], established the [[Center for Jewish–Christian Understanding and Cooperation]] or CJCUC, the first Orthodox Jewish institution to dialogue with the Christian world on a religious and theological basis. The center, currently located in [[Jerusalem]], engages in Hebraic Bible Study for Christians, from both the local community and from abroad, has organized numerous interfaith praise initiatives, such as ''[[Day to Praise]]'', and has established many fund-raising initiatives such as ''[[Blessing Bethlehem]]'' which aim to aid the persecuted Christian community of [[Bethlehem]], in part, and the larger persecuted Christian community of the [[Middle East]] region and throughout the world.

===Christian–Muslim relations===
A recent survey indicated that Christians in Israel are prosperous and well-educated&amp;nbsp;– but some fear that Muslim intimidation will cause a mass escape to the West.&lt;ref name=inn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/163468#.VYHE2fmqqko|title=Christians in Israel Well-Off, Statistics Show|website=Israelnationalnews.com|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently there has been an increase of anti-Christian incidents in the Nazareth area, inspired by the rise of Jihadist forces in the Middle East. Many Christians have complained of being targeted by Muslims, whom they believe are trying to either drive them out of cities that have traditionally had large Christian populations, or to "persuade" them to convert.&lt;ref name=inn/&gt; In 1999, for example, radical Muslims in Nazareth rioted as they attempted to wrest land from a major Christian shrine to build a mosque.&lt;ref name=inn/&gt; In one incident during 2014, a flag of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant was installed in front of a church in Nazareth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/08/26/photos-isis-flag-at-key-sites-send-chill-through-israel/|title=Photos of ISIS flag at key sites send chill through Israel - Fox News|date=26 August 2014|website=Foxnews.com|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been increasing incitement and violence by the Muslims against Christians who voice their support for the Israel Defense Forces. In a recent case, the son of [[Gabriel Naddaf]], a prominent Eastern Orthodox priest who is regarded as being pro-Israel, was severely beaten. Nadaf himself has been suffering from vasts amount of Muslim incitement in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Father-Nadaf-Arab-leaders-must-stop-incitement-campaign-against-me-334377/|title=Father Nadaf: Arab leaders must stop incitement campaign against me|website=Jpost.com|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2014/09/23/arab-israeli-priest-to-un-israel-only-safe-haven-for-christians-in-middle-east-video/|title=Arab-Israeli Priest to UN: ‘Israel Only Safe Haven For Christians in Middle East’ (VIDEO)|website=Algemeiner.com|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study estimates some 300 Christians from a Muslim background in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnstone|first1=Patrick|last2=Miller|first2=Duane Alexander|title=Believers in Christ from a Muslim Background: A Global Census|journal=IJRR|date=2015|volume=11|issue=10|pages=1–19|url=https://www.academia.edu/16338087/Believers_in_Christ_from_a_Muslim_Background_A_Global_Census|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/05/10/5-facts-about-israeli-christians/|title=5 facts about Israeli Christians|date=2016-05-10|newspaper=Pew Research Center|access-date=2017-02-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Pew Research Center|Pew]] research points to the convergence of political views of both Muslims and Christians over issues like&amp;nbsp;– Israel cannot be a Jewish state and a democracy at the same time (Christians: 72%; Muslims: 63%), US being too supportive of Israel (Christians: 86%; Muslims: 75%), Israeli government not making enough efforts to make peace with Palestine (Christians: 80%; Muslims: 72%).

==Demographics==
=== Education ===
[[File:Saint Joseph's Latin Parish.JPG|The Aedicule|thumb|200px|[[Catholic school]] in [[Haifa]]: High level [[Christian school]]s are among Israel's best performing educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.676300 Why Angry Christians in Israel Are Crying Discrimination], ''Haaretz''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
According to the study "Are Christian Arabs the New Israeli Jews? Reflections on the Educational Level of Arab Christians in Israel" by Hanna David from the [[University of Tel Aviv]], one of the factors why Arab Christians are the most educated segment of Israel's population is the high level of the Christian educational institutions. [[Christian school]]s in Israel are among the best schools in the country, and while those schools represent only 4% of the Arab schooling sector, about 34% of [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab]] university students come from [[Christian school]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hcef.org/790796657-demonstration-of-christian-schools-in-jerusalem/ |title= Demonstration of Christian Schools in Jerusalem - Holy Land Christian Ecumenical Foundation |website=Hcef.org |accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 87% of the [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli Arabs]] in the [[high tech]] sector have been educated in Christian schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/schools-starved-funds-christians-question-their-future-israel-1522645081 |title=With schools starved of funds, Christians question their future in Israel |website= Middleeasteye.net |accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.676300 |title=Why Angry Christians in Israel Are Crying Discrimination - Features |newspaper=Haaretz |accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 Maariv article described the Christian Arab sector as "the most successful in the education system",&lt;ref name="Maariv"/&gt; an opinion supported by others who point out that Christian Arabs fared best in terms of education in comparison to any other group receiving an education in Israel.&lt;ref name="StrongInEducation"/&gt; 

====High school and matriculation exams====
The [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]] noted that when taking into account the data recorded over the years, Christian Arabs fared the best in terms of education in comparison to any other group receiving an education in Israel.&lt;ref name="StrongInEducation"/&gt; In 2016 Christian Arabs had the highest rates of success at [[matriculation examination]]s, namely 73.9%, both in comparison to [[Muslims|Muslim]] and [[Druze in Israel|Druze]] Israelis (41% and 51.9% respectively), and to the students from the different branches of the [[Hebrew]] (majority [[Jewish]]) education system considered as one group (55.1%).&lt;ref name="Aruz7"&gt;{{cite web |url= An inside look at Israel's Christian minority |website=Aruz7|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TOI2013"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.timesofisrael.com/christian-arabs-top-countrys-matriculation-charts/ |title= Christian Arabs top country’s matriculation charts |website=The Times of Israel|accessdate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Higher education====
Christian Arabs are one of the most educated groups in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303849604579278722657163880 |title= Christians in Israel: A minority within a minority |website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303849604579278722657163880 |title= Israel's Christian Awakening |website=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistically, [[Christian Arabs]] in Israel have the highest rates of [[educational attainment]] among all religious communities, according to a data by [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]] in 2010, 63% of Christian Arabs have had college or [[postgraduate education]], the highest of any religious group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bokra.net/Article-1155836 |title=  المسيحيون العرب يتفوقون على يهود إسرائيل في التعليم |website=Bokra |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that Arab Christians only represent 2.1% of the total Israeli population, in 2014 they accounted for 17.0% of the country's [[university]] students, and for 14.4% of its [[college]] students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.walla.co.il/item/279897 ]{{dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of Arab Christian women who are receiving higher education is also higher than that of other groups.&lt;ref name="Maariv"/&gt; There are more Christians who have attained a [[bachelor's degree]] or higher [[academic degree]]s than the median Israeli population.&lt;ref name="StrongInEducation"/&gt;

The rate of students studying in the field of [[medicine]] was higher among Christian Arab students than that of all other sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/National-News/CBS-report-Christian-population-in-Israel-growing|title= CBS report: Christian population in Israel growing |website=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Arab Christian students were also the vanguard in terms of eligibility for [[higher education]],&lt;ref name="StrongInEducation"/&gt; as the Christian Arab students had the highest rates of receiving [[Psychometric Entrance Test]] scores which make them eligible for acceptance into universities, data from the [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]] show that 61% of Christian Arabs were eligible for university studies, compared to 50% of Jewish, 45% of Druze, and 35% of Muslim students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.breakingisraelnews.com/8421/christian-arabs-likely-graduate-high-school-israel/#Yw4jp6yTtgoxsjcA.97 |title= Christian Arabs Most Likely to Graduate High-School in Israel |website= Breaking Israel News |accessdate=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socio-economic ===
In terms of their socio-economic situation, Arab Christians are more similar to the Jewish population than to the Muslim Arab population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terrasanta.net/tsx/articolo.jsp?wi_number=3483&amp;wi_codseq=&amp;language=en|title=Israeli Christians Flourishing in Education but Falling in Number|website=Terrasanta.net|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have the lowest incidence of poverty and the lowest percentage of unemployment which is 4.9% compared to 6.5% among Jewish men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/163468|title=Christians in Israel Well-Off, Statistics Show: Christians in Israel are prosperous and well-educated - but some fear that Muslim intimidation will cause a mass escape to the West|website=Arutz Sheva|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also the highest [[median household income]] among [[Arab citizens of Israel]] and second highest median household income among the Israeli ethno-religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abrahamfund.org/webfiles/fck/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A7%204%20-%20%D7%A4%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%97%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D.pdf |format=PDF |title=פרק 4 פערים חברתיים-כלכליים בין ערבים לבין יהודים |website=Abrahamfund.org |accessdate=2016-09-18}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Also Arab Christians have a high presentation in [[science]] and in the [[White-collar worker|white collar]] professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/7603271/David_H._2014_._Are_Christian_Arabs_the_New_Israeli_Jews_Reflections_on_the_Educational_Level_of_Arab_Christians_in_Israel|title=David, H. (2014). Are Christian Arabs the New Israeli Jews? Reflections on the Educational Level of Arab Christians in Israel|website=Academia.edu|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Israel, Arab Christians are portrayed as a hard-working and [[upper-middle-class]] educated [[ethno-religious]] minority.

== Religiosity ==
[[File:Wikimania 2011-08-07 by-RaBoe-078.jpg|The Aedicule|thumb|200px|[[Catholic Mass]] in the [[Basilica of the Annunciation]] in [[Nazareth]].]]

The '''Congress of Catalan Culture''' (&lt;span contenteditable="false"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; Catalan, el Congrés de Cultura Catalana, abbreviated as '''CCC''') was a group of activities organized by the School of Lawyers of Barcelona, geared towards the study and diffusion of the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] culture, developed between 1975 and 1978.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{Harvard citation|AA.VV.|2006|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim was to promote the Catalan culture through diverse proposals for the future, which were concretized  in a group of twenty-three fields of study, developed by experts in diverse fields of the Catalan culture. Under the presidency of [[Jordi Rubió|Jordi Rubió i Balaguer]], a commission travelled during the course of the year 1976 throughout the entire geography of the so-called [[Països Catalans|Catalan Countries]] ([[Catalonia]], [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], [[Balearic Islands|Balearic]], [[Andorra]] and [[Roussillon|Rosellón]]), gathering information and proposals that were compiled into three volumes. In total 12,400 congressmen participated.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt;

Among other actions, the congress expressed the desirability of safeguarding aspects such as natural heritage and the identification of the territory, the official use of the [[Catalan language]], the revitalization of the culture and the folklore popular, and the maintenance of the Catalan institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

'''Crime''' is present in various forms in [[Cambodia]].

== Crime by type ==

===Murder===
{{Further|List of countries by intentional homicide rate}}

In 2012, Cambodia had a murder rate of 6.5 per 100,000 population.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt; There were a total of 964 murders in Cambodia in 2012.&lt;ref name=UNODC&gt;[https://www.unodc.org/gsh/en/index.html ''Global Study on Homicide''. [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robbery ===
Petty crime is common, with tourist areas often targeted. This includes [[snatch theft]] and pick-pocketing. Perpetrators are usually stricken with poverty, and as a result are driven to steal from foreigners with the knowledge that they bring about a significant amount of money and other valuable items. Owing to the easy accessibility of arms, armed robbery also occurs.&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1080.html |publisher=travel.state.gov |title=Cambodia |accessdate=June 13, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620151830/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1080.html |archivedate=June 20, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corruption ===
{{Further|Corruption in Cambodia}}

The rate of corruption in Cambodia is high; one source goes on to describe the situation as "nothing less than obscene". Corruption is considered a large expense to the Cambodian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CtXYNtLJYOoC&amp;pg=PA147 |pages=147– |title=Cambodia Reborn?: The Transition to Democracy and Development |last=Curtis |first=Grant |year=1998 |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |isbn=9780815791379 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cambodian police force is known to inappropriately use violence in certain cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wbru.com/2013/01/protest-claims-police-brutality-in-cambodian-home-drug-arrest/ |publisher=95.5 WBRU |title=Protest Claims Police Brutality in Cambodian Home |date=January 14, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212235029/http://www.wbru.com/2013/01/protest-claims-police-brutality-in-cambodian-home-drug-arrest |archivedate=December 12, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The misuse of ferocity has raised concerns from the Human Rights Watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/02/01/cambodia-escalating-violence-misuse-courts |date=February 1, 2013 |title=Cambodia: Escalating Violence, Misuse of Courts |publisher=Human Rights Watch }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prostitution===
{{main|Prostitution in Cambodia}}

[[Prostitution]] is against the law [[Prostitution in Cambodia|in Cambodia]], but still present and only growing. Le Thi Quy, a professor from the Women's Research Center, interviewed a handful of females in 1993 about prostitution; three quarters of the interviewees found being a prostitute to be a [[norm (social)|norm]] and a profession they felt was not shameful having.&lt;ref name="Barry 1"/&gt; That same year, the professor estimated that there were some one hundred thousand sex workers in the country.&lt;ref name="Barry 1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p8N-zQGWVf8C&amp;pg=PA137 |pages=137– |title=The Prostitution of Sexuality |first=Kathleen |last=Barry |publisher=NYU Press |year=1996 |isbn=9780814712771 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Femminielli''''' or '''''femmenielli''''' (singular '''''femminiello''''', cf. [[Standard Italian]] ''femmina'', "a female", ''-ello'', masculine [[diminutive]] suffix) is a term used to refer to a population of homosexual males with markedly feminine gender expression in traditional [[Naples|Neapolitan]] culture.&lt;ref name="Corriere"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fulvio |first1=Bufi |year=2009 |title=Presa Ketty, boss "femminiello" Comandava i pusher di Gomorra |journal=Corriere della Sera |issue=February 13, 2009 |pages=19 |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/febbraio/13/Presa_Ketty_boss_femminiello_Comandava_co_8_090213017.shtml |accessdate= |quote=FEMMINIELLO E' UNA FIGURA OMOSESSUALE (..)

==Gender analysis==
It is reductive to insert the Neapolitan Femminiello within the macro-category of transgender usually adopted in Anglo-Saxon and North American contexts. "The alternative identity of femminielli is possible from a transformed, disguised, and transfigured body, a complex phenomenon that could be considered 'endemic', and is peculiarly linked to the territory and the population of the city".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Zito, Eugenio. "Disciplinary crossings and methodological contaminations in gender research: a psycho-anthropological survey on Neapolitan femminielli." International Journal of Multiple Research Approaches, vol. 7, no. 2, 2013, p. 204+. Academic OneFile, http://link.galegroup.com.uaccess.univie.ac.at/apps/doc/A354578053/AONE?u=43wien&amp;sid=AONE&amp;xid=103bdda0. Accessed 23 Oct. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The femminiello, instead, could be considered as a peculiar gender expression, despite a widespread sexual binarism. The cultural roots of this phenomenon are embedded in confer to the femminiello a cultural and even socially legitimized status. For the historical and symbolic coordinates of Naples, the identity construct of the femminiello is not superimposable to more common European and euro-centric transgender clusters.&lt;ref&gt;Hochdorn, Alexander, Paolo F. Cottone and Dania Vallini (2011). Gender and discursive positioning: Doing transgender in highly normative contexts. ''69th Conference of the International Council of Psychologists''. 29 July - 2 August 2011, Washington DC (USA) http://www.icpweb.org {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304231821/http://icpweb.org/ |date=2012-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2000s many sex scandals have rocked Italy involving high-profile politicians (e.g., former President of Lazio, [[Piero Marrazzo]]) and [[Shemale|transsexual sex workers]] often of Latin American descent, who are usually referred to as ''transessuali'' (shortened to ''trans'') in Italian media. In 2009 the term ''femminiello'' gained some notoriety in Italian media after a Naples native ''femminiello'' [[Camorra]] mobster [[Ketty Gabriele]] ([[legal name]] Ugo Gabriele) was arrested. Gabriele had engaged in [[prostitution]] prior to becoming a [[Caporegime|capo]]. Gabriele has been referred to both as a ''femminiello''&lt;ref name="Corriere" /&gt; and ''transessuale'' or ''trans''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://city.corriere.it/2009/02/13/napoli/prima-cronaca/camorra-trans-vertice-clan-scissionisti-20324152476.shtml|title=Corriere della Sera|author=|date=|website=city.corriere.it|accessdate=7 May 2018}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.panorama.it/italia/2009/02/12/arrestata-ketty-transessuale-e-boss-a-scampia/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422061909/http://blog.panorama.it/italia/2009/02/12/arrestata-ketty-transessuale-e-boss-a-scampia |archivedate=2009-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Italian media.

However others maintain that ''i femminielli'' are decidedly male despite their female gender role, saying that "they are male; they know it and everyone else knows it."&lt;ref name="The Femminiello in Neapolitan Culture" /&gt; Achille della Ragione has written of social aspects of ''femminielli''. "[The ''femminiello''] is usually [[Fraternal birth order and male sexual orientation|the youngest male child]], 'mother's little darling,' ... he is useful, he does chores, runs errands and watches the kids."&lt;ref name="The Femminiello in Neapolitan Culture" /&gt;

Zito and Eugenio propose in their study that the femminielli "seem to confirm, in the field of [[gender identity]], the [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] idea of continuous modulation between the masculine and the feminine against their dichotomy."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A certain incompatibility between the notions of ''femminiello'' and (often foreign-born) transsexuals can be observed, e.g., a news headline reading ''Rivolta ai quartieri Spagnoli: i femminielli cacciano le trans'' ("Revolt in the [[Quartieri Spagnoli]]: ''femminielli'' drive out the transsexuals.")&lt;ref name="The Femminiello in Neapolitan Culture" /&gt;

The constant references in many sources to the ancient rituals behind the presence of the ''femminiello'' in Naples require little comment. The links to ancient [[Greek mythology]] are numerous: for example, [[Hermaphroditus]], who possessed the beauty of the mother, [[Aphrodite]], and the strength of the father, [[Hermes]]; or [[Tiresias]], the  blind prophet of Thebes, famous for being transformed into a woman for seven years. Both of these personages and, indeed, others in many cultures in the world are presumed to possess something that others do not: the wise equilibrium that comes from knowing both worlds, masculine and feminine.&lt;ref name="The Femminiello in Neapolitan Culture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="I femminielli - di Achille della Ragione"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guidecampania.com/dellaragione/articolo3/articolo.htm#99|title=I femminielli (Achille della Ragione)|author=|date=|website=www.guidecampania.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510111436/http://www.guidecampania.com/dellaragione/articolo3/articolo.htm#99 |archivedate=10 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceremony===
A ceremony called the ''matrimonio dei femminielli'' takes place in [[Torre Annunziata]] on [[Easter Monday]], a parade of ''femminielli'' dressed in wedding gowns and accompanied by a "husband" travel through the streets in horse-drawn carriages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostrillone.tv/legginotizia.asp?idnotizia=7630&amp;idcatnotizia=9&amp;titolo=Pasquetta%20con%20i%20femminielli%20%20nel%20quadrilatero%20Carceri Lo Strillone: Pasquetta con i femminielli nel quadrilatero Carceri] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031214310/http://www.lostrillone.tv/legginotizia.asp?idnotizia=7630&amp;idcatnotizia=9&amp;titolo=Pasquetta%20con%20i%20femminielli%20%20nel%20quadrilatero%20Carceri |date=2012-10-31 }}, 9 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tradition===
The ''femminiello'' in [[Campania]], enjoy a relatively privileged position thanks to their participation in some traditional events, such as ''Candelora al Santuario di Montevergine'' ([[Candlemas]] at the Sanctuary of [[Montevergine]]) in [[Avellino]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.incampania.com/EN/turismo.cfm?s=4&amp;Menu_ID=183&amp;Sub_ID=218&amp;Info_ID=3782 Il Santuario di Montevergine e la Candelora] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127053541/http://www.incampania.com/EN/turismo.cfm?s=4&amp;Menu_ID=183&amp;Sub_ID=218&amp;Info_ID=3782 |date=2012-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''Tammurriata'', a traditional dance performed at the feast of Madonna dell'Arco in [[Sant'Anastasia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liceoumberto.eu/cartelle/altro/tammurriata.htm|title=Traditional Dances - The Tummurriata|author=|date=|website=liceoumberto.eu|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325203119/http://www.liceoumberto.eu/cartelle/altro/tammurriata.htm|archivedate=25 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally ''femminielli'' are considered good luck. For this reason, it is popular in the neighborhoods for a ''femminiello'' to hold a newborn baby, or participate in games such as [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]].&lt;ref name="I femminielli - di Achille della Ragione"/&gt; Above all the [[Raffle|Tombola]] or ''Tombolata dei femminielli'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irpinianews.it/CulturaEventi/news/?news=40799|title=Tombolata dei Femminielli: divertimento e tradizione ad Avellino|author=|date=|website=irpinianews.it|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531094856/http://www.irpinianews.it/CulturaEventi/news/?news=40799|archivedate=31 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is a popular game performed every year on the 2nd of February, as the conclusive part of the Candlemas at the Sanctuary of Montevergine.

==Theatre==
In a stage production called ''La Gatta Cenerentola'' (The Cat Cinderella), by Roberto De Simone, ''femmenielli'' play the roles of several important characters. Among the major scenes in this respect are the ''rosario dei femmenielli'' and ''il suicidio del femminiella''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreeuniversity.net/LaGattaCenerentola/article.html|title=The Songs of LA GATTA CENERENTOLA - Roberto de Simone - Universitas adversitatis - Organiser Ed Emery|author=|date=|website=www.thefreeuniversity.net|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310141929/http://www.thefreeuniversity.net/LaGattaCenerentola/article.html |archivedate=10 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16460">'''Gender roles in agriculture''' are a frequent subject of study by [[sociologist]]s and [[agricultural economics|farm economist]]s. Historians also study them, as they are important in understanding the [[social structure]] of [[agrarian society|agrarian]], and even [[industrial society|industrial]], societies. Agriculture provides lots of job opportunities and livelihoods around the world. It can also reflect gender inequality and uneven distribution of resources and privileges among  gender&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://agecon.unl.edu/cornhusker-economics/2018/does-gender-matter-agriculture|title=Does Gender Really Matter in Agriculture? {{!}} Agricultural Economics|last=Network|first=University of Nebraska-Lincoln {{!}} Web Developer|website=agecon.unl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to the Institute of [https://agecon.unl.edu/ Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Nebraska-Lincoln], women are usually harder to obtain land, tools and knowledge than men, especially in developing countries. Several organizations such as [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] or research also indicated that increasing gender corporation can bring more profits and food security for the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garcia|first=Alicea Skye|last2=Wanner|first2=Thomas|date=2017-09-27|title=Gender inequality and food security: lessons from the gender-responsive work of the International Food Policy Research Institute and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12571-017-0718-7|journal=Food Security|language=en|volume=9|issue=5|pages=1091–1103|doi=10.1007/s12571-017-0718-7|issn=1876-4517}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/gender/insights/detail/en/c/431326/|title=Shared labour, shared rewards: men and women farming together in Sri Lanka {{!}} Gender {{!}} Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|website=www.fao.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/I8958EN|title=Document card {{!}} FAO {{!}} Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|website=www.fao.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==North America==
===United States===
The "classical" farm [[gender role]]s in the [[United States]], although varying somewhat from region to region, were generally based on a division of [[Manual labour|labor]] in which men participated in "field" tasks (animal care, [[plowing]], [[harvest]]ing [[crop]]s, using [[farm machinery]], etc.), while most women participated primarily in "farmhouse" tasks (preparing and preserving food and feedstuffs, and maintaining the farm compound).

According to agro-historian [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02218564 Jane Adams], the middle 20th century brought a change in which the centralization of agriculture eliminated many of the tasks considered part of the "female" role. This changed the perception of women from being active "housekeepers" to passive "homemakers". Some began working off the farm, or joined their husbands in fieldwork, but the majority, per Dr. Adams, simply became more like urban housewives. This trend continued until the 1980s [[farm crisis]], in which [[economic downturn]]s obliged many of them to take jobs off-farm.

===Canada===
Gender roles in [[Agriculture in Canada|Canadian agriculture]] vary greatly according to the region and community.

[[Alberta]], and particularly [[Southern Alberta]], has traditionally had highly defined gender roles similar to the late 19th-century United States. Men worked together and women worked together, but there were few tasks in which both men and women participated together. On most Alberta farms up until the 1970s, decisions about matters such as planning and insurance were done by [[fiat]] of the husband, rather than by joint venture of husband and wife. Some writers have considered Alberta's highly gendered division of farm life to be not only inefficient from an agricultural standpoint, but deleterious to the integrity of marriage relationships as well.

In the agricultural tradition of [[Central Canada]] there is an emphasis on [[Marriage|conjugal]] (husband-and-wife) collaboration. Major decisions are normally made together, with each spouse having equal decisive power. When extended families live and farm together, couples within the extended family are considered as working "units". This style of family farm management is rather common in the rest of Canada as well.

[[Quebec]] agriculture is based on the historic [[Seigneurial system of New France|seigneurial system]], vestiges of which exist today in the organized district system. Gender roles are sometimes more pronounced in areas where the [[Catholic]] influence is strong.

In [[Southern Ontario]] the history of agricultural gender roles parallels that of the U.S.A. almost precisely.

Besides these regional generalities, traditions vary among different ethnic and religious communities, such as [[First Nations]] (aboriginal), [[Anabaptist]], or historic immigrant settlements.

Across Canada, and also in the United States, the assignment of roles tends to be more [[egalitarian]] on [[Organic farming|organic]] and [[Certified Naturally Grown]] farms than on "conventional" ones.

==Europe==
===C.I.S. (former U.S.S.R.)===
Agricultural society in what is now the [[C.I.S.]] goes back thousands of years, and entails numerous distinct cultures. [[Slavonic language|Slavonic]]-speaking societies tended to follow the general [[Proto-Indo-European society|Indo-European]] pattern of [[patrilineality]], passing down property and rights from father to son. In agriculture this meant [[farmland|land]] and [[livestock]]. The gender roles on the farm presumed that the farm and all its contents belonged to the father or grandfather. [[Uralic language|Uralic]]-speaking societies, on the other hand, had a relatively egalitarian system in which land was considered to be the domain of a larger extended family or [[folk group]], without rigid boundaries between individual [[homestead (buildings)|homestead]]s. Division of labour was not rigid, and spouses often worked alongside each other, or helped each other with various tasks.

During the [[Russian Empire]] period, Slavonic patriarchy was emphasized and promoted to a greater extent across the board. This was especially the case in southern and central Russia during the 18th and 19th centuries, where every farmer or farm labourer was considered to hold a position in the [[feudal]] [[hierarchy]] of the Empire, until this system was modified in the later 19th century. Men were the official landowners and decision-makers, though women often had a significant amount of unofficial influence in decision-making (on the free [[peasant]] farmsteads).

In the years leading up to the [[Revolution]], as the remnants of feudalism disintegrated, many Russian farm families joined ''artels'' (артели), or cooperatives. The cooperatives practised (at least in theory) equal consideration of men's and women's opinions in making collective decisions, which was a sharp contrast to the feudal method. Moreover, as the Empire became more connected by rail and road, the [[rural]] residents of central and southern Russia gained knowledge of Uralic-based farm operation systems (which had survived in the north and east). These northern and eastern traditions contributed to the emerging cooperative practices.

After the Revolution, the government was initially supportive toward the [[artel]] movement (since it is "[[collectivist]]"). When the [[Stalinist]] government took power, however, many of the artels were superseded by [[Sovkhoz|state farm]] units (''sovkhozy'' or Совхоэӣ) under control of the central government. The effect on gender roles varied: workers of both sexes were assigned to do similar tasks, but [[Management|managers]] and [[wikt:overseer|overseer]]s were mostly male, though there was no fixed rule or custom that established this as absolute. Fieldworkers often worked in mixed-gender teams, though in the [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] and Middle [[Asia]]n republics an informal segregation by sex was maintained, following local (and ultimately [[Islamic]]) traditions. Throughout the Union, state-farm [[administrator (business)|administrator]]s tended to have little regard for [[marital]] relationships: marriage was considered part of the workers' personal lives, which needed not enter into the world of [[economic]] labour. Children born or conceived on a state farm were considered "bound" to it, in a concept lent from feudalism.

Later governments, from Krushchev's onward, eased the central control of farms, though certain republics (such as [[Tajikistan]]) took up this control into their own state governments, and retain much of it even to this day.

With the 1960s loosening of central administration over agriculture, the cooperative system became once again the main system of large-scale farmland operations in much of the U.S.S.R. This condition has remained ever since, with only minor changes.

Where small and extended family farms exist in the C.I.S., consensus is often a major mode of decision-making, and cooperation a major mode of work. On collective farms as well, conjugal collaboration is a respected and encouraged part of the overall dynamic, and couples often work as units within the larger framework. Exceptions include the [[Chechenya]]/[[Dagestan]]/[[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Naxcivan]] region, where all areas of life are highly sex-segregated, and marriage is often an arranged contract by the parents.

===Finland===
[[Agriculture in Finland|Finnish agriculture]] tends to follow a modern form of what is recognizably the Uralic system, though the influence of [[western Europe]] (particularly in [[Finland]]'s west half) has brought a greater consciousness of [[private property]]. Conjugal collaboration and joint venture are major characteristics of the Finnish farming tradition.

==Latin America==
===Mexico===
In Mexico, the most important crop has been and still is [[maize]]. It is the main ingredient in [[tortillas]], which is a staple in Mexican cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;Maize diversity and gender: research from Mexico&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, for many Mexicans, especially those living in rural farming communities, maize symbolizes the origin of life. Women, therefore, are usually the ones responsible for tending the maize crops, although it is not unusual for a man to farm the maize.&lt;ref&gt;"Si No Comemos Tortilla, No Vivimos:” Women, Climate Change, and Food Security in Central Mexico&lt;/ref&gt;

Although women have traditionally been responsible for the entire tortilla process, from farming the maize to grinding the maize into flour and cooking the tortillas, this takes a substantial amount of time. Because of this, recently some women have been purchasing bags of tortilla flour or even pre-made tortillas in local markets to better fit their busy lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Maize diversity and gender: research from Mexico&lt;/ref&gt; This has been controversial among individuals living in rural communities, as many people see the tortilla making process as having high importance in the traditions of their culture.&lt;ref&gt;Maize diversity and gender: research from Mexico&lt;/ref&gt;

Another recent controversy in Mexico has to do with the type of maize being grown and consumed. Maíz criollo, or [[landrace]] maize, is the most common type of maize grown in Mexico, although recently [[genetically modified crops]] are becoming more widespread. In a focus group meeting conducted among Mexican farmers, the men tended to feel that the [[genetically modified maize]] was better, as it was easier to farm, while the women tended to say that the landrace maize was better because it was more nutritional and better tasting than the genetically modified maize.&lt;ref&gt;Maize diversity and gender: research from Mexico&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
In [[Brazil]], large [[plantation]]s and [[finca]]s are often worked by several families. Fieldwork is a large portion of the workers' time, in the case both of men and of women.

In areas of more scattered agriculture, [[running water]] is often unavailable. It is usually women who must carry large water containers home from the stream or well in these cases, even though it is men who usually lift most other heavy loads on the Brazilian ranch, such as [[harvest]] sacks.

Among inland [[indigenous people]]s, varying forms of the pan-[[Amazon Basin|Amazonian]] (or pan-Amazon-basin) gender role construct are seen. In these societies, especially those in which [[polygynous]] marriage has been practiced, the family unit is considered on two levels, the [[matrifocal]] and the [[patrifocal]]. [[Crop]] plots are owned by the brothers of any patrifocal family collectively; thus, if a man plants a field of any crop, all of his brothers and paternal half-brothers are considered to automatically own an equal share of the harvest.&lt;ref&gt;Chagnon, N. 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile and Argentina===
Agriculture is varied but consists largely of [[ranch]]ing activity. There is very little emphasis on gender roles in [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]], compared to the rest of [[South America]]. Names for most agricultural "job descriptions" and individual roles are [[Gender-specific job title|gender-neutral]], with only the final letter changing according to the sex of the individual. The [[@]] symbol is sometimes used, in lieu of either "o" or "a", to describe the general occupation without specifying gender, as in ''Buscamos puester@s para...'' (as might be written in a help-wanted [[poster]]).

== Africa ==
In a lot of African countries nowadays, women rights are secondary in the sense that males dominant in assets, ownership, and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.keg.lu.se/en/research/research-projects/current-research-projects/afrint|title=AFRINT|date=2014-09-12|work=The Department of Human Geography|access-date=2018-09-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are usually in charge of light farming or crop processing, while males have more opportunities to work with livestock and stay out of their household duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/publications/sofa/the-state-of-food-and-agriculture/en/|title=The State of Food and Agriculture {{!}} FAO {{!}} Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|website=www.fao.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it also vary with ethnic groups, age and production cycles. Women are also responsible for children care, their financial ability and educational level may post strong influences on children’s well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebrooke.org/for-professionals/voices-women-research-project|title=Voices from Women research project {{!}} Brooke|website=www.thebrooke.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research showed that [[Equus (genus)|equine]] assisted rural women to finish their chores earlier, which provides females more time for children care. Moreover, by empowering women with assets and knowledge, the children’s nutritional status may be improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-05-01|title=Women's asset ownership and children's nutritional status: Evidence from Papua New Guinea|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953618301382|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|language=en|volume=204|pages=100–107|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.03.026|issn=0277-9536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''German-speaking Community of Belgium''' ({{lang-de|Deutschsprachige Gemeinschaft Belgiens}} {{IPA-de|ˈdɔʏ̯tʃˌʃpʁaːxɪɡə ɡəˈmaɪ̯nʃaft ˈbɛlɡi̯əns|}}, '''DG'''; {{lang-fr|Communauté germanophone de Belgique}} {{IPA-fr|kɔmynote ʒɛʁmanofɔn də bɛlʒik|}}; {{lang-nl|Duitstalige Gemeenschap van België}} {{IPA-nl|ˈdœy̯tsˌtaːlɪɣə ɣəˈmeːnˌsxɑp vɑn ˈbɛlɣijə|}}) or '''Eastern Belgium''' ({{lang-de|Ostbelgien}}; {{lang-fr|Belgique de l'est}}; {{lang-nl|Oost-België}}) is one of the three [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|federal communities]] of [[Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dglive.be/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-1263//2264_read-27181/ |title=The German-speaking Community |publisher=Dglive.be |date= |accessdate=2014-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504234715/http://www.dglive.be/en/Desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-1263/2264_read-27181/ |archivedate=2014-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Covering an area of {{convert|854|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}} within the [[provinces of Belgium|province]] of [[Liège (province)|Liège]] ({{lang-de|Lüttich}}) in [[Wallonia]], it includes nine of the eleven municipalities of [[Eupen-Malmedy|East Cantons]] ({{lang-de|Ost-Kantone}}). Traditionally speakers of [[Low Dietsch dialects|Low Dietsch]], [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] and [[Moselle Franconian dialects|Moselle Franconian]] varieties, the local population numbers over 75,000—about 0.70% of the national total.

Bordering the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]] and [[Luxembourg]], the area has its own parliament and government at [[Eupen]]. Although in the [[Luxembourg (Belgium)|Belgian province of Luxembourg]] many of the inhabitants in the border region next to the [[Luxembourg|Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] speak [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]], a [[West Central German]] language, they are not considered part of the German-speaking Community. The German-speaking Community of Belgium is composed of the German-speaking parts of the lands that were annexed in 1920 from Germany. In addition, in contemporary Belgium there are also some other areas where German is or has been spoken (the difference line between German, Dutch, Luxembourgish and Limburgish is very slight since they are all part of the same [[dialect continuum]]) that belonged to Belgium even before 1920, but they are not currently officially considered part of the German-speaking Community of Belgium: [[Bleiberg]]-[[Welkenraedt]]-[[Baelen]] in northeastern [[Liège (province)|province of Liège]] and [[Arelerland]] (city of [[Arlon]] and some of its nearby villages in southeastern [[Luxembourg (Belgium)|province of Belgian Luxembourg]]). However, in these localities, the German language is declining due to the expansion of [[French language|French]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Society for Threatened Peoples]]: [http://www.gfbv.it/3dossier/vielfalt-dt.html gfbv.it]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The area known today as the [[Eupen-Malmedy|East Cantons]] consists of the German-speaking Community and the municipalities of [[Malmedy]] and [[Waimes]] ({{lang-de|Weismes}}), which belong to the [[French Community of Belgium]]. The East Cantons were part of the [[Rhine Province]] of [[Prussia]] in [[Germany]] until 1920 (as the counties (''{{lang|de|Landkreise}}'') of [[Eupen-Malmedy|Eupen and Malmedy]]), but were annexed by Belgium following Germany's defeat in [[World War I]] and the subsequent [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref name="DG history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dglive.be/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-1397//2268_read-27185/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626130648/http://www.dglive.be/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-1397/2268_read-27185/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-06-26 |title=History of the German-speaking Community |publisher=Dglive.be |date= |accessdate=2014-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus they also became known as the ''{{lang|fr|cantons rédimés}}'', "redeemed cantons". The peace treaty of Versailles demanded the "questioning" of the local population. People who were unwilling to become Belgians and wanted the region to remain a part of Germany were required to register themselves along with their full name and address with the Belgian military administration, headed by [[Herman Baltia]], and many feared reprisals or even expulsion for doing so.

In the mid-1920s, there were secret negotiations between Germany and the kingdom of Belgium that seemed to be inclined to sell the region back to Germany as a way to improve Belgium's finances. A price of 200 million [[gold mark]]s has been mentioned.&lt;ref name="DG history"/&gt; At this point, the French government, fearing for the complete postwar order, intervened at Brussels and the Belgian-German talks were called off.

The new cantons had been part of Belgium for just 20 years when, in 1940, they were retaken by Germany in [[World War II]]. The majority of people of the east cantons welcomed this as they considered themselves German. Following the defeat of Germany in 1945, the cantons were once again annexed by Belgium, and as a result of alleged collaboration with Nazi Germany an attempt was made to de-Germanize the local population by the Belgian and Walloon authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Asbrock|first1= Frank|last2= Van Hiel|first2= Alain|date= 21 November 2017|title= An Insiders’ Outside Perspective on the Flemish-Walloon Conflict: The Role of Identification and Disidentification for the German-Speaking Minority

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the early 1960s, Belgium was divided into four linguistic areas, the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking [[Flanders|Flemish]] area, the [[French language|French]]-speaking area, the bilingual capital of [[Brussels]], and the German-speaking area of the east cantons. In 1973, three communities and three regions were established and granted internal autonomy. The legislative [[Parliament of the German-speaking Community]], ''{{lang|de|Rat der Deutschsprachigen Gemeinschaft}}'', was set up. Today the German-speaking Community has a fair degree of autonomy, especially in language and cultural matters, but it still remains part of the region of predominantly French-speaking [[Wallonia]]. There has been much argument in the past few years that the German-speaking Community should also become its own region, which is an ongoing process with the permanent transfer with the previous accord of some competences concerning social policy, conservation of sites and monuments, environment protection policy, transport, the financing of municipalities, among other things from the Walloon Region. One of the proponents of full regional autonomy for the German-speaking Community is [[Karl-Heinz Lambertz]], the minister-president from 1999 to 2014.&lt;ref name="De Groene Amsterdammer"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.groene.nl/2008/33/de-triangelspeler-van-belgie |title=De triangelspeler van België: Duitstalig België |publisher=De Groene Amsterdammer |last1=De Vries |first1=J. |last2=Tielemans |first2=A. |date=2008-08-15 |language=Dutch |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927135349/http://www.groene.nl/2008/33/de-triangelspeler-van-belgie |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially regional autonomy for spatial planning, city building and housing should be considered, according to the government of the German-speaking Community.&lt;ref name="De Groene Amsterdammer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="De Morgen"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/5036/Wetstraat/article/detail/995456/2009/09/15/Duitstalige-Gemeenschap-wil-extra-bevoegdheden.dhtml |title=Duitstalige Gemeenschap wil extra bevoegdheden |work=[[De Morgen]] |date=2009-09-15 |language=Dutch }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flag and coat of arms ==
[[File:Ingangsbord van de Duitstalige Gemeenschap.jpg|thumb|right|floatleft|The entrance of the ministerial building of the German-speaking Community shows the coat of arms of the Community, which has the nine [[cinquefoil]]s arranged differently from the flag, and also sports a royal crown.]]

In 1989, there was a call for proposals for a flag and arms of the Community. In the end the coat of arms of the Community was designed by merging the arms of the [[Duchy of Limburg]] and the [[Duchy of Luxembourg]], to which the two parts of the community had historically belonged.

A decree adopted on 1 October 1990 and published on 15 November 1990 prescribed the arms, the flag, the colours as well as the [[Day of the German-speaking Community of Belgium]], which was to be celebrated annually on 15 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dglive.be/en/Desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-1263/2264_read-27181/ |title=Coat of Arms and Flag of the German-speaking Community |publisher=Dglive.be |date= |accessdate=2014-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070530023348/http://www.dglive.be/EN/Desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-1263/2264_read-27181/ |archivedate=2007-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coat of arms, in [[heraldry|heraldic]] [[blazon]], is: ''Arms: Argent, a lion rampant gules between nine [[cinquefoil]]s azure. Crest: A royal crown.'' The flag shows a red lion together with nine blue cinquefoils on a white field. The colours of the German-speaking Community are white and red in a horizontal position.

An '''ice cream social''' (also known as an '''ice cream party''') is a planned event the primary focus of which is [[ice cream]] served to the guests. It is often a neighborhood event or welcoming party, normally held during the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dumptv.com/holidaze/summer/ice_cream.html|title=Ice Cream Social - The Perfect Ending to Any Summer Function!|work=dumptv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ice cream socials are a traditional gathering dating back to the 18th century in [[North America]]. The first ice cream social in America was in 1744, when [[Maryland]] governor [[Thomas Bladen]] served ice cream for a dinner party. The first ice cream social in the [[White House]] was in 1802 with the 3rd U.S. president, [[Thomas Jefferson]]. When ice cream became more common to the public in the 1800s, organizations such as schools and churches started hosting ice cream socials. [[Christian Church|Churches]] frequently organized ice cream socials since the 1860s, fashioned after the "ice cream gardens" that were common in society at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/IceCream/IceCreamHistory.htm History of Ice Cream] ''What's Cooking, America?''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/food-encyclopedia/ice-cream Ice Cream] ''The Encyclopedia of Food.''&lt;/ref&gt; Today, ice cream socials still take place in government and upper class, but have spread to all classes and different organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Ice Cream Socials|url=http://www.scoops2u.com/history-of-ice-cream-socials/|website=Scoops2u|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are an estimated 15,000 '''people of Indian origin in Panama'''. They are employed in the shipping industry while others are mainly engaged in commerce. A majority are Hindu with a substantial Muslim and Sikh minority; and they maintain [[Hindu temple]]s, [[Gurdwara]]s and mosques in [[Panama City]] and [[Colón, Panama|Colón]].

Panama's Indian community originates from Punjab, Gujarat, and Sindh (now a part of Pakistan). The first significant immigration was during the US phase of the building of the Panama Canal, and were primarily from the Caribbean (islands and British Guiana, now Guyana) under British rule. Many of the founders of the Colon Free Zone were Indians.  Since then, the Indian community has grown with a slow but steady stream of immigrants.

Panamanians of Indian descent speak their native languages which could include [[Punjabi language|Punjabi,]] [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]]. Spanish is also used in the community between speakers of two languages that are not mutually intelligible.

'''Kachama-Ganjule''' is an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language spoken in [[Ethiopia]] on islands in [[Lake Chamo]] and [[Lake Abaya]]. Kachama is spoken on [[Gidicho island]] in Lake Abaya, whereas Ganjule was originally spoken on a small island in Lake Chamo. Now the Ganjule speakers have relocated to the west shore of the Lake. There still are about 1,000 monolinguals in this language.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. Gordon Jr., ed.  2005.  ''Ethnologue:  Languages of the World''.  15th edition.  Dallas:  Summer Institute of Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blench (2006) lists Gidicho, Kachama, and Ganjule as separate languages. ''Ethnologue'' gives Gatame/Get'eme/Gats'ame as a synonym; however, Blench treats that as a separate languages as well, a synonym with Haruro/Harro. While he moves the others to the northern branch of the Ometo languages, he leaves Gatame/Haruro in the eastern branch.&lt;ref&gt;Blench, 2006. [http://rogerblench.info/Language/Afroasiatic/General/AALIST.pdf The Afro-Asiatic Languages: Classification and Reference List]&lt;/ref&gt;  No evidence is presented for treating these as separate languages.

The contest was created by a female blogger in northern China nicknamed Piggy Feet Beta on [[MOP (Internet site)|MOP]], a popular Chinese [[bulletin board system]]. It received more than 6,000 submissions.&lt;ref name="globalvoicesonline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/10/22/china-my-father-is-li-gang/ |title=China: My father is Li Gang!  |publisher=Global Voices |date=October 22, 2010 |accessdate=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT story"/&gt; The phrase has since become a popular [[catchphrase]] and [[internet meme]] within China, frequently seen on various forums and message boards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.alertnet.org/db/blogs/29542/8303a0a1e59786c072fa84efbc947ce5.htm |title=China: My father is Li Gang! |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=October 22, 2010 |accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in similar competitions using ad slogans and song lyrics, and used ironically in conversation by speakers trying to avoid responsibility.

[[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] officials tried at first to [[Censorship in the People's Republic of China|suppress reports]] of the incident,&lt;ref name="NYT story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wines|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Wines|title=China's Censors Misfire in Abuse-of-Power Case|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/world/asia/18li.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 18, 2010|accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but their efforts [[Streisand effect|backfired]].&lt;ref name="lemonde"/&gt;{{how|date=February 2018}} During an interview with [[China Central Television]] on 21 October, Li Gang wept in an apology; then on 22 October, a video showing Li Qiming's apology was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.china.org.cn/china/2010-10/26/content_21200529.htm |title=Drunken driver arrested for fatal incident  |publisher=china.org.cn |date=October 26, 2010 |accessdate=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apology was rejected by the victims' families, the elder brother of Chen Xiaofeng believing the apology to be a political stunt.&lt;ref name="globaltimes"/&gt; The ''[[People's Daily]]'', in an editorial published on October 26, urged authorities to take the affair into their own hands and shed light on the matter.&lt;ref name="lemonde" /&gt;

On October 29, the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' and other sources revealed that a directive from the [[Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China|Central Propaganda Department]], issued on October 28, required that there be "no more hype regarding the disturbance over traffic at Hebei University," and ordered Chinese newspapers to recall their reporters from Baoding.&lt;ref name="lemonde"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT story"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scmp.com/portal/site/SCMP/menuitem.2c913216495213d5df646910cba0a0a0/?vgnextoid=71305513f93fb210VgnVCM100000360a0a0aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=teaser&amp;ss=China&amp;s=News |title=Media recall reporters after ban on coverage of hit-and-run case |work=[[South China Morning Post]] |date=October 29, 2010 |accessdate=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On November 1, Zhang Kai, the attorney for the relatives of Chen Xiaofeng, was abruptly asked to terminate his representation in the case, after the law firm was cautioned by the [[Beijing]] Bureau of Justice, according to a blog by [[Wang Keqin]], an influential [[Chinese people|Chinese]] [[muckraker|muckraking]] [[reporter]], 
[[blogger]] and professor at [[Peking University]]. That same day, Director Liu of Baoding Traffic Police Division and some clerks from [[Wangdu County]] proposed payments to the relatives of Chen Xiaofeng to settle the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinaaid.org/qry/page.taf?id=144&amp;_function=detail&amp;sbtblct_uid1=1621&amp;month=11&amp;year=2010&amp;_nc=d98ad5c143971bd19701393b6e3585a5 |title=Attorney in the Speeding Case at Hebei University Receives Warning |publisher=[[ChinaAid]] |date=November 2, 2010 |accessdate=November 5, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017075716/http://www.chinaaid.org/qry/page.taf?id=144 |archivedate=October 17, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 4, the [[Central Propaganda Department]] banned news of an interview by [[Phoenix Television]] with Ms. Chen’s brother, Chen Lin, in which he was critical of the government.

Then on November 9, Internet discussion of the case suddenly stopped. Local students and activists such as [[Ai Weiwei]], however, continued to speak out.&lt;ref name="NYT story"/&gt;

In January 2011, Li Qiming was arrested. He was sentenced to six years in jail and ordered to pay the equivalent of $69,900 in compensation to the family of Chen Xiaofeng. Li was also ordered to pay $13,800 to the injured woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12317756 | work=[[BBC News]] | title=China hit-and-run driver sentenced to six years in jail | date=January 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=How long did he end up serving?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6061">The '''Malthusian League''' was a British organisation which advocated the practice of [[contraception]] and the education of the public about the importance of [[family planning]]. It was established in 1877 and was dissolved in 1927. The organisation was [[secular]], [[utilitarian]], [[individualistic]], and "above all [[malthusian]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Simms | first = Madeleine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e1c6OjifgyYC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221 |title=Revie w: A History of the Malthusian League 1877-1927 |journal=New Scientist |date=27 January 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation maintained that it was concerned about the poverty of the British working class and held that over-population was the chief cause of poverty.

The league was initially founded during the "Knowlton trial" of [[Annie Besant]] and [[Charles Bradlaugh]] in July 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = D'Arcy  | first = F. | title = The Malthusian League and the resistance to birth control propaganda in late Victorian Britain | journal = Population Studies: A Journal of Demography | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 429&amp;ndash;448 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/00324728.1977.10412759 | jstor = 2173367 | date = November 1977 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00324728.1977.10412759 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were prosecuted for publishing [[Charles Knowlton]]'s ''Fruits of Philosophy'' which explained various methods of birth control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Knowlton | first = Charles | editor-last1 = Besant | editor-first1 = Annie | editor-last2 = Bradlaugh| editor-first2 = Charles | author-link = Charles Knowlton | editor-link1 = Annie Besant | editor-link2 = Charles Bradlaugh | title = Fruits of philosophy: a treatise on the population question | publisher = Reader's Library | location = San Francisco | date = October 1891 | origyear = 1840 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38185/38185-h/38185-h.htm | oclc = 626706770}} A publication about birth control. [https://archive.org/details/fruitsphilosoph00knogoog View original copy.]&lt;/ref&gt; The League was formed as a permanent body to advocate for the elimination of penalties for promoting birth control as well as to promote public education in matters of contraception. The trial demonstrated that the public was interested in the topic of contraception and sales of the book surged during the trial.&lt;ref name=McLaren&gt;{{cite book|last=McLaren|first=Angus|title=Birth control in nineteenth-century England|year=1978|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WIUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first president was [[Charles Robert Drysdale]], who was succeeded by his [[free union]] partner [[Alice Vickery]]. The league initially restricted itself primarily to an "educative role" which emphasised the importance of Malthus' economic arguments rather than practical information about birth control. The league had an increasingly socially and economically conservative tone as the 19th century wore on. Thus some earlier agreement between Malthusians and [[Radicalism (historical)|social reformer]]s was replaced by mutual distrust. The league believed that the sole cause of poverty was an excess of births, and therefore opposed [[socialism]], considered [[strike action|strike]]s and reforms of labour laws to be "useless."&lt;ref name=McLaren /&gt; League members were primarily [[middle class]] and did not make many serious efforts to communicate with the [[working class]] aside from some debates with socialists during the 1880s. Although the league doctrine as a whole was hostile to socialism, some members were indeed socialists who were sympathetic to arguments in favour of birth control. The league also maintained some overlap with the [[women's rights]] movement, which was concerned with birth control. The League began plans for a birth control clinic in 1917 but these stalled
until they received funds from the philanthropist Sir John Sumner and finally the clinic opened on 9 November 1921 at 153a East Street, Walworth with [[Norman Haire]] as their honorary medical officer, three afternoons a week.  [[Marie Stopes]] and her husband had opened their clinic nine months earlier. Stopes’ clinic was the first in the British Empire (but not the first in the world) and the League always emphasised that theirs was the first English clinic where birth control instruction was given under medical supervision.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Wyndham. (2012) {{cite web|url= http://purl.library.usyd.edu.au/sup/9781743320068|title='Norman Haire and the Study of Sex'}} Foreword by the Hon. [[Michael Kirby (judge)|Michael Kirby]] AC CMG. (Sydney: {{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/sup/|title=Sydney University Press)}}, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar leagues were founded in several other European countries including Germany, France, and the Netherlands in the following years. In 1892, the Dutch league became the first to set up a medical clinic to provide information directly to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pUZLM6IVBO4C&amp;pg=PA125 |title=The selected papers of Margaret Sanger, Volume 1 |author=Sanger, Margaret |year=2003 |publisher=University of Illinois Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of the league's activity coincided with a substantial drop in the birth rate in Britain, and many European countries. Some have credited its activities, but others have disputed this conclusion, citing the general fall in birth rates even in countries without active league activity.&lt;ref name=McLaren107&gt;{{cite book|last=McLaren|first=Angus|title=Birth control in nineteenth-century England|year=1978|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WIUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;ots=bEcq2ils0d&amp;dq=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Malthusian League forms part of the society within [[Aldous Huxley]]'s novel [[Brave New World]].

The '''Maouri''' people are an [[ethnic group]] in western [[Africa]]. They are one of the major ethnic groups of [[Niger]], and are concentrated around the ''Dallol Maouri'' (Maouri Valley) of the [[Niger River]], extending from [[Matankari]], near [[Niamey]], to [[Gaya, Niger|Gaya]]. They are a subgroup of the [[Hausa people]], and speak both the [[Hausa language]] and the [[Djerma language]] (or Zarma).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Le Territoire français Niger-Tchad | author=[[Société Belge d'Études Coloniales]] | journal=Bulletin de la Société belge d'études coloniales |date=September 1905 | volume=12 | pages=449–523}}&lt;/ref&gt; When using the Zarma language, they are known as the Arawa people.&lt;ref name="histdict"/&gt;

The establishment of the Maouri people is uncertain, though many sources indicate descent from the [[Bornu Empire]]. The Maouri established two capitals in [[Matankari]] and [[Lougou]], with religious authority based in [[Bagaji]].&lt;ref name="histdict"&gt;{{cite book | title=Historical Dictionary of Niger | publisher=Scarecrow Press | author=Idrissa, Abdourahmane and Samuel Decalo | year=2012 | pages=588 | isbn=0810870908 | edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maouri are [[animism|animistic]], with beliefs based on the [[Doguwa (religion)|Doguwa]] spirits.&lt;ref name="histdict"/&gt; [[Islam]] (especially in [[Dogondoutchi]]) and [[Christianity]] have since gained some adherents among the Maouri, but they still largely hold to traditional beliefs, including [[fetishes]].&lt;ref name="histdict"/&gt; They resisted an attempted forced [[religious conversion|conversion]] to Islam in the early 19th century during the [[Fulani jihad]]s and subsequent establishment of the [[Sokoto Caliphate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Rough Guide to West Africa | publisher=Penguin | author=Trillo, Richard | year=2008 | pages=1360 | isbn=1405380705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maouri were also subject to colonization by European powers. The Maouri lands were traded between the English and French colonies in West Africa under various treaties between 1890 and 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Niger-Nigeria boundary, 1890-1906: a study of ethnic frontiers and a colonial boundary | publisher=Ohio University, Center for International Studies | author=Thom, Derrick J. | year=1975 | pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French were particularly brutal in their administration of their colonies: in 1898 the priestess of Lougou, [[Sarraounia]], resisted an attack by the French [[Voulet-Chanoine Mission]] at the [[Battle of Lougou]]. The town ultimately fell, though Sarraounia's forces managed a retreat and were able to inflict ten casualties on the much more numerous and better-armed French soldiers.&lt;ref name="histdict"/&gt; The French later massacred the neighboring [[Konni (Hausa state)|Konni]] town of [[Birni-N'Konni]] in revenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=French Colonial Documentary: Mythologies of Humanitarianism | publisher=University of Minnesota Press | author=Bloom, Peter J. | year=2008 | pages=265 | isbn=0816646287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the Maouri are traders and farmers, and have a reputation as industrious people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Niger Foreign Policy and Government Guide, Volume 1 | publisher=International Business Publications | year=2011 | isbn=1433036878 | edition=6th | page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mariah Carey''' (born March 27, 1969 or 1970)&lt;!--Do NOT change without gaining consensus
on talk page beforehand.--&gt;&lt;ref name="LR9N5" /&gt; is an American singer and songwriter. Referred to as the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Songbird Supreme]]" by the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', she is noted for her five-octave [[vocal range]], [[Belting (music)|power]], [[melisma]]tic style, and signature use of the [[whistle register]]. She rose to superstardom in 1990 after signing to [[Columbia Records]] and releasing her [[Mariah Carey (album)|eponymous debut album]], which topped the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] for 11 consecutive weeks. Carey became the first and only artist to have their first five singles reach number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, from "[[Vision of Love]]" to "[[Emotions (Mariah Carey song)|Emotions]]".&lt;ref name="x90Gk" /&gt;

Following her marriage to [[Sony Music]] head [[Tommy Mottola]], Carey became the label's highest-selling act with the follow-up albums ''[[Music Box (Mariah Carey album)|Music Box]]'' (1993), ''[[Merry Christmas (Mariah Carey album)|Merry Christmas]]'' (1994), and ''[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]'' (1995). These albums spawned some of Carey's most successful singles, including "[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]]", "[[Without You (Badfinger song)#Mariah Carey version|Without You]]", "[[All I Want for Christmas Is You]]", and "[[One Sweet Day]]"; the latter became the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100|longest-running U.S. number-one single in history]], with a total of 16 weeks. After separating from Mottola, Carey adopted a new image and incorporated more elements of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] into her music with the release of ''[[Butterfly (Mariah Carey album)|Butterfly]]'' (1997). ''Billboard'' named her the most successful artist of the 1990s in the United States, while the [[World Music Awards]] honored her as the world's best-selling recording artist of the 1990s.

After 11 consecutive years charting a number-one single, Carey parted with Columbia in 2000 and signed a record-breaking $100&amp;nbsp;million recording contract with [[Virgin Records]]. However, following her [[Glitter (soundtrack)#Controversies|highly publicized physical and emotional breakdown]], as well as the failure of her film ''[[Glitter (film)|Glitter]]'' (2001) and its accompanying [[Glitter (soundtrack)|soundtrack]], her contract was bought out for $50&amp;nbsp;million by Virgin and she signed with [[Island Records]] the next year. After a relatively unsuccessful period, she returned to the top of music charts with ''[[The Emancipation of Mimi]]'' (2005). It became the world's second best-selling album of 2005 and produced "[[We Belong Together]]", which made her the only artist to top the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements by decade|''Billboard'' Hot 100 Decade-End chart]] twice. With the release of "[[Touch My Body]]" (2008), Carey gained her 18th number-one single in the United States, [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most number-one singles|more than any other solo artist]].

Throughout her career, Carey has sold more than 200 million records worldwide, making her one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] of all time. According to the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], she is the [[List of best-selling music artists in the United States|third-best-selling female artist]] in the United States, with 63.5&amp;nbsp;million [[RIAA certification|certified]] albums. In 2012, she was ranked second on [[VH1]]'s list of the [[The Greatest (TV series)|100 Greatest Women in Music]]. Aside from her commercial accomplishments, Carey has won 5 [[Grammy Award]]s, 19 [[World Music Awards]], 10 [[American Music Award]]s,&lt;ref name="amas" /&gt; and 14 [[Billboard Music Award]]s,&lt;ref name="r1QJQ" /&gt; and has been consistently credited with inspiring generations of singers.

== Early life ==
Mariah Carey was born in [[Huntington (CDP), New York|Huntington, New York]].&lt;ref name="6G76Y" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nick1" /&gt; Her father, Alfred Roy Carey, was of [[African American]] and [[Afro-Venezuelan]] descent, while her mother, Patricia (née Hickey), is of Irish descent. The last name Carey was adopted by her Venezuelan grandfather, Francisco Núñez, after he came to New York.&lt;ref name="nick2" /&gt; Patricia was an occasional opera singer and vocal coach before she met Alfred in 1960.&lt;ref name="nick1" /&gt; As he began earning a living as an aeronautical engineer, the couple wed later that year, and moved into a small suburb in New York.&lt;ref name="nick2" /&gt; After their elopement, Patricia's family disowned her for marrying a black man. Carey later explained that growing up, she felt neglected by her maternal family, which greatly affected her.&lt;ref name="nick2" /&gt; During the years between the births of Carey's older sister Alison and herself, the Carey family struggled within the community due to their ethnicity.&lt;ref name="nick2" /&gt; Carey's name was derived from the song "[[They Call the Wind Maria]]", originally from the 1951 Broadway musical ''[[Paint Your Wagon (musical)|Paint Your Wagon]].''&lt;ref name="b3WSA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zDki9" /&gt; When Carey was three, her parents divorced.&lt;ref name="nick3" /&gt;

{{Quote box|width=300px|align=left|quote="It's been difficult for me, moving around so much, having to grow up by myself... my parents divorced. And I always felt kind of different from everybody else in my neighborhoods. I was a different person ethnically. And sometimes, that can be a problem. If you look a certain way, everybody goes 'White girl', and I'd go, 'No, that's not what I am.'"|source=—Carey, on her childhood&lt;ref name="nick6" /&gt;
}}
After their separation, Alison moved in with her father, while the other two children, Mariah and brother Morgan, remained with their mother. Carey would grow apart from her father, and would later stop seeing him altogether.&lt;ref name="nick3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nick4" /&gt; By the age of four, Carey recalled that she had begun to sneak the radio under her covers at night, and just sing and try to find peace within the music.&lt;ref name="nick4" /&gt; During elementary school, she excelled in subjects that she enjoyed, such as music, art, and literature, but did not find interest in others. After several years of financial struggles, Patricia earned enough money to move her family into a stable and more affluent sector in New York.&lt;ref name="nick5" /&gt; Carey had begun writing poems and adding melodies to them, thus starting as a [[singer-songwriter]] while attending [[Harborfields High School]] in [[Greenlawn, New York]],&lt;ref name="nick7" /&gt; where she graduated in 1987.&lt;ref name="people1993" /&gt; Carey excelled in her music, and demonstrated usage of the [[whistle register]], though only beginning to master and control it through her training with her mother. Though introducing her daughter to classical opera, Patricia never pressured her to pursue a career in it, as she never seemed interested. Carey recalled that she kept her singer-songwriter works a secret and noted that Patricia had "never been a pushy mom. She never said, 'Give it more of an operatic feel.' I respect opera like crazy, but it didn't influence me."&lt;ref name="nick7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nick8" /&gt;

While in high school, Carey began writing songs with [[Gavin Christopher]]. They needed an assistant who could play the [[Musical keyboard|keyboard]]: "We called someone and he couldn't come, so by accident we stumbled upon [[Ben Margulies|Ben]] [Margulies]. Ben came to the studio, and he really couldn't play the keyboards very well – he was really more of a drummer – but after that day, we kept in touch, and we sort of clicked as writers."&lt;ref name="nick8" /&gt; Carey and Christopher began writing and composing songs in the basement of his father's store during Carey's [[Senior (education)|senior year]]. After composing their first song together, "Here We Go 'Round Again", which Carey described as having a [[Motown]] vibe, they continued writing material for a full-length demo.&lt;ref name="nick9" /&gt; She began living in a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan, which she shared with four other female students.&lt;ref name="nick10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nick11" /&gt; Carey worked as a waitress for various restaurants, usually getting fired after two weeks.&lt;ref name="nick12" /&gt; While requiring work to pay for her rent, Carey still had musical ambitions, as she continued working late into the night with Margulies in hopes of completing a demo.&lt;ref name="nick12" /&gt; After completing her four song demo tape, Carey attempted to pass it to music labels, but failed each time.&lt;ref name="nick13" /&gt; Shortly thereafter, she was introduced to rising [[Pop music|pop]] singer [[Brenda K. Starr]].&lt;ref name="nick13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nick14" /&gt;

== Career ==

=== 1988–1992: ''Mariah Carey'' and ''Emotions'' ===
[[File:Mariah Carey 1990.jpg|thumb|upright|Carey exiting [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]] after promoting her single "Vision of Love" on ''[[Wogan]]'', in 1990]]

As Starr's friendship with Carey grew, so did her interest in helping Carey succeed in the industry. In December 1988, Carey accompanied Starr to a record executives' gala, where she handed her demo tape to the head of Columbia Records, Tommy Mottola, who listened to it on his way back home.&lt;ref name="nick17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nick16" /&gt; After the first two songs, he was interested in her; later, after searching for Carey for two weeks, he immediately signed her and began mapping out her commercial debut.&lt;ref name="nick17" /&gt; While she maintained that she wanted to continue working with Margulies, Mottola enlisted top producers of the time, including [[Ric Wake]], [[Narada Michael Walden]] and [[Rhett Lawrence]].&lt;ref name="nick17" /&gt; Mottola and the staff at Columbia had planned to market Carey as their main female pop artist, competing with [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] (signed to [[Arista Records|Arista]] and [[Sire Records]] respectively).&lt;ref name="nick18" /&gt; After the completion of her debut album, ''[[Mariah Carey (album)|Mariah Carey]]'', Columbia spent more than $1&amp;nbsp;million promoting it.&lt;ref name="nick19" /&gt; Despite a weak start, the album eventually reached the top of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], after Carey's exposure at the [[33rd Annual Grammy Awards]].&lt;ref name="nick20" /&gt; ''Mariah Carey'' stayed atop the charts for eleven consecutive weeks,&lt;ref name="jtml6" /&gt; and she won the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]], and [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] awards for her single "[[Vision of Love]]."&lt;ref name="eZTkj" /&gt; In addition to "Vision of Love", the album yielded the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number one singles "[[Love Takes Time]]", "[[Someday (Mariah Carey song)|Someday]]", and "[[I Don't Wanna Cry]]".&lt;ref name="Hot 100" /&gt; Carey became the first musical act since [[The Jackson 5]] to have their first four singles reach number one.&lt;ref name="6aGYr" /&gt; ''Mariah Carey'' finished as the best-selling album in the United States in 1991,&lt;ref name="yjtgw" /&gt; while totaling sales of over 15 million copies.&lt;ref name="bet" /&gt;

Carey began recording her second studio album, ''[[Emotions (Mariah Carey album)|Emotions]]'', in 1991.&lt;ref name="nick21" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nick22" /&gt; She described it as an homage to [[Motown]] [[soul music]], as she felt the need to pay tribute to the type of music that had influenced her as a child.&lt;ref name="nick22" /&gt; For the project, Carey worked with [[Walter Afanasieff]], who only had a small role on her debut, as well as [[Robert Clivillés]] and [[David Cole (record producer)|David Cole]], from the [[dance music|dance]] group [[C+C Music Factory]].&lt;ref name="nick23" /&gt; Carey's relationship with Margulies deteriorated over a personal contract Carey had signed with him before signing the record deal with Columbia, agreeing to split not only the songwriting royalties from the songs, but half of her earnings as well. However, when the time came to write music for ''Emotions,'' Sony officials made it clear he would only be paid the fair amount given to co-writers on an album. Margulies later filed a lawsuit against Sony which ultimately led to their parting of ways.&lt;ref name="nick22" /&gt; ''Emotions'' was released on September 17, 1991, and was accepted by critics as a more mature album than its predecessor.&lt;ref name="nick24" /&gt; While praised for Carey's improved songwriting, production, and new sound, the album was criticized for its material, thought weaker than that of her debut.&lt;ref name="nick25" /&gt; Though the album managed sales of over eight million copies globally, ''Emotions'' failed to reach the commercial and critical heights of its predecessor.&lt;ref name="sales" /&gt;

As after the release of her debut, critics again questioned whether Carey would embark on a world tour to promote her material.&lt;ref name="shapiro1" /&gt; Although Carey explained that [[stage fright]] and the style of her songs made a tour very daunting, speculation grew that Carey was a "studio worm," and that she was incapable of producing the perfect pitch and 5-[[octave]] [[vocal range]] for which she was known.&lt;ref name="nycc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shapiro2" /&gt; In hopes of putting to rest any claims of her being a manufactured artist, Carey and [[Walter Afanasieff]] decided to book an appearance on [[MTV Unplugged]], a television program aired by [[MTV]].&lt;ref name="nick26" /&gt; The show presented name artists "unplugged" or stripped of studio equipment.&lt;ref name="nick26" /&gt; While Carey favored her more soulful and powerful songs, it was decided that her most popular content would be included. Days before the show's taping, Carey and Afanasieff thought of adding a cover version of an older song, in order to provide something different and unexpected.&lt;ref name="shapiro3" /&gt; They chose "[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]", a song made popular by [[The Jackson 5]] in 1970. On March 16, 1992, Carey recorded a seven-piece set-list at [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] in Queens, New York.&lt;ref name="nickson27" /&gt; The [[revue]] was met with critical acclaim, leading to it being aired more than three times as often as an average episode would.&lt;ref name="nickson28" /&gt; The success tempted [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]] officials to market it.&lt;ref name="nickson29" /&gt; Sony decided to release it as an [[Extended play|EP]], priced low because it was short. The EP proved to be a success, contrary to critics and speculations that Carey was just a studio artist,&lt;ref name="nickson30" /&gt; and was given a triple-[[RIAA Certification|Platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA),&lt;ref name="riaa" /&gt; and managed Gold and Platinum certifications in several European markets.&lt;ref name="nickson29" /&gt;

=== 1993–1996: ''Music Box'', ''Merry Christmas'', and ''Daydream'' ===
During early 1993, Carey began working on her third studio album, ''[[Music Box (Mariah Carey album)|Music Box]]''.&lt;ref name="shapiro4" /&gt; After ''Emotions'' failed to achieve the commercial heights of her debut album, Carey and Columbia came to the agreement that the next album would contain a more pop influenced sound, in order to appeal to a wider audience.&lt;ref name="shapiro4" /&gt; During Carey's writing sessions, she began working mostly with Afanasieff, with whom she co-wrote and produced most of ''Music Box''.&lt;ref name="soul" /&gt; On August 31, ''Music Box'' was released around the world, debuting at number-one on the ''Billboard'' 200.&lt;ref name="shapiro7" /&gt; The album was met with mixed reception from music critics; while many praised the album's pop influence and strong content, others felt that Carey made less usage of her acclaimed vocal range.&lt;ref name="shapiro8" /&gt; Ron Wynn from [[AllMusic]] described Carey's different form of singing on the album: "It was wise for Carey to display other elements of her approach, but sometimes excessive spirit is preferable to an absence of passion."&lt;ref name="F0iAt" /&gt; The album's second single, "[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]]", would eventually come to be one of Carey's most popular and inspirational songs of her career.&lt;ref name="nickson31" /&gt; The song became Carey's eighth chart topper in the United States,&lt;ref name="nickson31" /&gt; and began expanding Carey's popularity throughout Europe. With the release of the album's third single, Carey achieved several career milestones. Her cover of [[Badfinger]]'s "[[Without You (Badfinger song)|Without You]]" became her first number one single in Germany, Sweden,&lt;ref name="ger" /&gt; and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="without" /&gt;

''Music Box'' spent prolonged periods at number one on the album charts of several countries,&lt;ref name="nickson32" /&gt; and eventually became one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums]] of all time, with worldwide sales of over 28 million copies.&lt;ref name="bettwenty" /&gt; After declining to tour for her past two albums, Carey agreed to embark on a short stateside string of concerts, titled the [[Music Box Tour]].&lt;ref name="shapiro9" /&gt; Spanning only six dates across North America,&lt;ref name="shapiro9" /&gt; the short but successful tour was a large step for Carey, who dreaded the hassle of touring.&lt;ref name="shapiro10" /&gt; Following ''Music Box'', Carey took a relatively large period of time away from the public eye, and began working on an unknown project throughout 1994.&lt;ref name="shapiro11" /&gt; In October 1994, ''Billboard'' announced that Carey would release a holiday album later that year.&lt;ref name="shapiro11" /&gt; That 1994, Carey recorded a duet with [[Luther Vandross]]; a cover of [[Lionel Richie]] and [[Diana Ross]]'s "[[Endless Love (song)|Endless Love]]".&lt;ref name="nickson33" /&gt; Carey's album ''[[Merry Christmas (Mariah Carey album)|Merry Christmas]]'' was released on November 1, 1994, on the same day that the album's first single, "[[All I Want for Christmas Is You]]", was released.&lt;ref name="nickson34" /&gt; The album eventually became the [[List of best-selling Christmas/holiday albums in the United States|best-selling Christmas album]] of all time, with global sales reaching over 15 million copies.&lt;ref name="newyorker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mimisales2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="national" /&gt; Upon its release, "All I Want for Christmas Is You" was critically praised, and is considered "one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon."&lt;ref name="newyorker" /&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described it as a "holiday standard and ranked it fourth on its Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs list.&lt;ref name="RSS" /&gt; Commercially, it became the best-selling holiday ringtone of all time,&lt;ref name="newswire" /&gt; and the best-selling single by a non-Asian artist in Japan,&lt;ref name="6xSNh" /&gt; selling over 2.1&amp;nbsp;million units (both ringtone and digital download).&lt;ref name="riajCDcertification1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="riajdl200812" /&gt; By the end of the holiday season of 1994, Carey and Afanasieff had already begun writing material for her next studio album, which would be released late the following year.&lt;ref name="nickson35" /&gt;

Released on October 3, 1995, ''[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]'' combined the pop sensibilities of ''Music Box'' with downbeat R&amp;B and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] influences.&lt;ref name="shapiro12" /&gt; The album's second single, "[[One Sweet Day]]" was inspired by the death of [[David Cole (record producer)|David Cole]].&lt;ref name="shapiro14" /&gt; The song remained atop the Hot 100 for a record-holding 16 weeks, and became the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones|longest-running number-one song in history]].&lt;ref name="nickson36" /&gt; ''Daydream'' became her biggest-selling album in the United States,&lt;ref name="syQhG" /&gt; and became her second album to be certified [[RIAA Certification|Diamond]] by the RIAA, following ''Music Box''.&lt;ref name="riaa" /&gt; The album again was the best-seller by an international artist in Japan, shipping over 2.2&amp;nbsp;million copies,&lt;ref name="BNPnL" /&gt; and eventually reaching global sales of over 20 million copies.&lt;ref name="BET.com Exclusive: Mariah Celebrates 20 Years; Thanks Fans" /&gt; Critically, the album was heralded as Carey's best to date; ''The New York Times'' named it one of 1995's best albums, and wrote, "best cuts bring R&amp;B candy-making to a new peak of textural refinement [...] Carey's songwriting has taken a leap forward and become more relaxed, sexier and less reliant on thudding clichés."&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; Carey once again opted to embark on a short world tour titled [[Daydream World Tour]]. It had seven dates, three in Japan and four throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="nickson100" /&gt; When tickets went on sale, Carey set records when all 150,000 tickets for her three shows at Japan's largest stadium, [[Tokyo Dome]], sold out in under three hours, breaking the previous record held by [[The Rolling Stones]].&lt;ref name="nickson100" /&gt; Due to the album's success, Carey won two awards at the [[American Music Award]]s for her solo efforts: [[American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist|Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist]] and [[American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Female Artist|Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Female Artist]].&lt;ref name="4VmN3" /&gt; ''Daydream'' and its singles were respectively nominated in six categories at the [[38th Grammy Awards]].&lt;ref name="shapiro16" /&gt; Carey, along with [[Boyz II Men]], opened the event with a performance of "One Sweet Day".&lt;ref name="shapiro17" /&gt; However, Carey did not receive any award, prompting her to comment "What can you do? I will never be disappointed again. After I sat through the whole show and didn't win once, I can handle anything."&lt;ref name="shapiro17" /&gt; In 1995, due to ''Daydream''{{'}}s enormous Japanese sales, ''Billboard'' declared Carey the "Overseas Artist of the Year" in Japan.&lt;ref name="U9mh9" /&gt;

=== 1997–2000: New image and independence, ''Butterfly'', and ''Rainbow'' ===
With her following albums, Carey began to take more initiative and control with her music, and started infusing more genres into her work.&lt;ref name="nickson39" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nickson40" /&gt; For ''[[Butterfly (Mariah Carey album)|Butterfly]]'', she sought to work with other producers and writers other than Afanasieff, such as [[Sean Combs]], [[Kamaal Fareed]], [[Missy Elliott]] and Jean Claude Oliver and Samuel Barnes from [[Trackmasters]].&lt;ref name="nickson40" /&gt; During the album's recording, Carey and Mottola separated, with Carey citing it as her way of achieving freedom, and a new lease on life.&lt;ref name="nickson41" /&gt; Aside from the album's different approach, critics took notice of Carey's altered style of singing, which she described as [[Breathy voice|breathy vocals]].&lt;ref name="L2U7u" /&gt; Her new-found style of singing was met with mixed reception; some critics felt this was a sign of maturity, that she did not feel the need to always show off her upper range,&lt;ref name="buff" /&gt; while others felt it was a sign of her weakening and waning voice.&lt;ref name="Iox35" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shapiro18" /&gt; The album's lead single, "[[Honey (Mariah Carey song)|Honey]]", and its accompanying music video, introduced a more overtly sexual image than Carey had ever demonstrated, and furthered reports of her freedom from Mottola.&lt;ref name="shapiro19" /&gt; Carey believed that her image was not "that much of a departure from what I've done in the past [...] It's not like I went psycho and thought I would be a rapper. Personally, this album is about doing whatever the hell I wanted to do."&lt;ref name="shapiro19" /&gt; Reviews for ''Butterfly'' were generally positive: ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote, "It's not as if Carey has totally dispensed with her old saccharine, Houston-style balladry [...] but the predominant mood of 'Butterfly' is one of coolly erotic reverie."&lt;ref name="UjjXX" /&gt; [[AllMusic]] editor [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] described Carey's vocals as "sultrier and more controlled than ever," and heralded ''Butterfly'' as one of her "best records and illustrates that Carey continues to improve and refine her music, which makes her a rarity among her '90s peers.'"&lt;ref name="all" /&gt; The album was a commercial success, although not to the degree of her previous albums ''Mariah Carey'', ''Music Box'' and ''Daydream''.&lt;ref name="shapiro20" /&gt;

[[File:Mariah Carey13 Edwards Dec 1998.jpg|thumb|left|upright||Carey at the [[Edwards Air Force Base]] during the making of the "[[I Still Believe (Brenda K. Starr song)#Mariah Carey version|I Still Believe]]" music video in December 1998]]
Carey began developing other projects during the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="shapiro21" /&gt; On April 14, 1998, Carey partook in the [[VH1 Divas]] [[benefit concert]], where she sang alongside [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Celine Dion]], [[Shania Twain]], [[Gloria Estefan]], and [[Carole King]].&lt;ref name="divas" /&gt; Carey had begun developing a film project ''All That Glitters'', later re-titled to simply ''[[Glitter (film)|Glitter]]'',&lt;ref name="boston" /&gt; and wrote songs for other projects, such as ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'' (1997) and ''[[Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000 film)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'' (2000).&lt;ref name="shapiro21" /&gt; After ''Glitter'' fell into [[development hell|developmental hell]], Carey postponed the project, and began writing material for a new album.&lt;ref name="shapiro21" /&gt; [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]] executives wanted her to prepare a greatest hits collection in time for the holiday season.&lt;ref name="shapiro22" /&gt; They wanted to release an album that featured her number one singles in the United States, and her international chart toppers on the European versions, without any new material, while Carey felt that a compilation album should reflect on her most personal songs, not just her most commercial.&lt;ref name="shapiro23" /&gt; The album, titled ''[[Number 1's (Mariah Carey album)|#1's]]'' (1998), featured a duet with [[Whitney Houston]], "[[When You Believe]]", which was included on the soundtrack for ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' (1998).&lt;ref name="shapiro23" /&gt; ''#1's'' became a phenomenon in Japan, selling over one million copies in its opening week, making Carey as the only international artist to accomplish this feat.&lt;ref name="japansales" /&gt; It sold over 3.25&amp;nbsp;million copies in Japan after only the first three months, and holds the record as the [[List of best-selling albums in Japan|best-selling album]] by a non-Asian artist.&lt;ref name="japansales" /&gt;

During the spring of 1999, Carey began working on the final album per her record contract with Sony.&lt;ref name="shapiro25" /&gt; But due to the pressure and the awkward relationship Carey had developed with Sony, she completed the album in a period of three months in the summer of 1999, quicker than any of her other albums.&lt;ref name="shapiro6" /&gt; Titled ''[[Rainbow (Mariah Carey album)|Rainbow]]'' (1999), the album found Carey once again working with a new array of music producers and songwriters, such as [[Jay-Z]] and [[DJ Clue?]].&lt;ref name="shapiro27" /&gt; Carey also wrote two ballads with [[David Foster]] and [[Diane Warren]], whom she used to replace Afanasieff.&lt;ref name="shapiro27" /&gt; ''Rainbow'' was released on November 2, 1999, to the highest first week sales of her career at the time, however debuting at number two on the ''Billboard'' 200.&lt;ref name="shapiro30" /&gt; In the meantime Carey's troubled relationship with Columbia grew, as they halted promotion after the album's first two singles.&lt;ref name="shapiro30" /&gt; They felt ''Rainbow'' didn't have any strong single to be released, whereas Carey wanted to release a ballad.&lt;ref name="shapiro30" /&gt; This led to a very public feud, as Carey began posting messages on her website, telling fans inside information on the dispute, as well as instructing them to request "[[Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)]]" on radio stations.&lt;ref name="shapiro28" /&gt; The song was ultimately released but Carey found out that the song had only been given a very limited and low-promotion release, which made it commercially non-viable.&lt;ref name="shapiro29" /&gt; Critical reception of ''Rainbow'' was generally enthusiastic, with the ''[[Sunday Herald]]'' saying that the album "sees her impressively tottering between soul ballads and collaborations with R&amp;B heavyweights like [[Snoop Dogg]]y Dogg and [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] [...] It's a polished collection of pop-soul."&lt;ref name="CeT0a" /&gt; Though a commercial success, ''Rainbow'' became Carey's lowest selling album to that point in her career.&lt;ref name="fox" /&gt;

=== 2001–2004: Personal and professional struggles, ''Glitter'' and ''Charmbracelet'' ===
After she received [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard''{{'}}s Artist of the Decade Award]] and the World Music Award for Best-Selling Female Artist of the Millennium,&lt;ref name="bestselling" /&gt; Carey parted from Columbia and signed an estimated $100&amp;nbsp;million, five-album recording contract with [[Virgin Records America]] ([[EMI Records]]) in April 2001.&lt;ref name="WHXgh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="emi" /&gt; Carey was given full conceptual and creative control over the project.&lt;ref name="emi" /&gt; She opted to record an album partly mixed with 1980s influenced disco and other similar genres, in order to go hand-in-hand with the film's setting.&lt;ref name="NGn8u" /&gt; She often stated that Columbia had regarded her as a commodity, with her separation from Mottola exacerbating her relations with label executives. Just a few months later, in July 2001, it was widely reported that Carey had suffered a physical and emotional breakdown. She had left messages on her website that complained of being overworked,&lt;ref name="x7Dmq" /&gt; and her three-year relationship with the singer [[Luis Miguel]] ended.&lt;ref name="Luis Miguel Relationship" /&gt; In an interview the following year, she said, "I was with people who didn't really know me and I had no personal assistant. I'd do interviews all day long and get two hours of sleep a night, if that."&lt;ref name="stand" /&gt; Due to the pressure from the media, her heavy work schedule and the split from Miguel, Carey began posting a series of disturbing messages on her official website, and displayed erratic behavior on several live promotional outings.&lt;ref name="nyc" /&gt; On July 19, 2001, Carey made a surprise appearance on the [[MTV]] program ''[[Total Request Live]]'' (TRL).&lt;ref name="hospital" /&gt; As the show's host [[Carson Daly]] began taping following a commercial break, Carey came out pushing an ice cream cart while wearing a large men's shirt, and began a [[striptease]], in which she shed her shirt to reveal a tight yellow and green ensemble.&lt;ref name="hospital" /&gt; While she later revealed that Daly was aware of her presence in the building prior to her appearance, Carey's appearance on TRL garnered strong media attention.&lt;ref name="nyc" /&gt; Only days later, Carey began posting irregular voice notes and messages on her official website: "I'm trying to understand things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now. What I'd like to do is just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [to] just be me and that's what I should have done in the first place ... I don't say this much but guess what, I don't take care of myself."&lt;ref name="hospital" /&gt; Following the quick removal of the messages, Berger commented that Carey had been "obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly" when she posted the letters.&lt;ref name="hospital2" /&gt;

[[File:Mariah Carey 2003 tour 1.jpg|thumb|right|Carey performing "[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]]" during her [[Charmbracelet World Tour]], in September 2003]]
On July 26, she was suddenly hospitalized, citing "extreme exhaustion" and a "physical and emotional breakdown."&lt;ref name="respect" /&gt; Carey was admitted to an undisclosed hospital in Connecticut, and remained hospitalized and under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public.&lt;ref name="respect" /&gt; Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey's publicized breakdown and hospitalization, [[Virgin Records America]] and [[20th Century Fox]] delayed the release of both ''[[Glitter (film)|Glitter]]'', as well as its soundtrack of the same name.&lt;ref name="hospital2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="daily2" /&gt; When discussing the project's weak commercial reaction, Carey blamed both her frame of mind during the time of its release, its postponement, as well as the soundtrack having been released on [[September 11 attacks|September 11]].&lt;ref name="ONvmI" /&gt; Critics panned ''[[Glitter (film)|Glitter]]'', as well as its accompanying soundtrack; both were unsuccessful commercially.&lt;ref name="V1ZD9" /&gt; The accompanying soundtrack album, ''[[Glitter (soundtrack)|Glitter]]'', became Carey's lowest-selling album to that point. The ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' dismissed it as "an absolute mess that'll go down as an annoying blemish on a career that, while not always critically heralded, was at least nearly consistently successful."&lt;ref name="kLewn" /&gt; Following the negative cloud that was enveloping Carey's personal life at the time, as well as the project's poor reception, her $100&amp;nbsp;million five-album record deal with [[Virgin Records America]] ([[EMI Records]]) was bought out for $50&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="emi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="contract" /&gt; Soon after, Carey flew to [[Capri]], Italy for a period of five months, in which she began writing material for her new album, stemming from all the personal experiences she had endured throughout the past year.&lt;ref name="nyc" /&gt; Carey later said that her time at Virgin was "a complete and total stress-fest [...] I made a total snap decision which was based on money and I never make decisions based on money. I learned a big lesson from that."&lt;ref name="NTJYI" /&gt; Later that year, she signed a contract with [[Island Records]], valued at more than $24&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name="xVDsg" /&gt; and launched the record label [[Monarc Entertainment|MonarC]]. To add further to Carey's emotional burdens, her father, with whom she had little contact since childhood, died of [[cancer]] that year.&lt;ref name="BDtis" /&gt;

In 2002, Carey was cast in the independent film, ''[[WiseGirls]]'', alongside [[Mira Sorvino]] and [[Melora Walters]], who co-starred as waitresses at a mobster-operated restaurant. It premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], and received generally negative critical response, though Carey's portrayal of the character was praised; Roger Friedman of [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] referred to her as "a [[Thelma Ritter]] for the new millennium," and wrote, "Her line delivery is sharp and she manages to get the right laughs."&lt;ref name="07m02" /&gt; Later that year, Carey performed the American [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]] to rave reviews at the [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] at the [[Louisiana Superdome]] in New Orleans, Louisiana.&lt;ref name="europe" /&gt; Towards the end of 2002, Carey released her next studio album ''[[Charmbracelet]]'', which she said marked "a new lease on life" for her.&lt;ref name="stand" /&gt; Though released in the wake of ''Glitter'' and Carey's return to the music scene, sales of ''Charmbracelet'' were moderate and the quality of Carey's vocals came under criticism. Joan Anderson from ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' declared the album "the worst of her career, and revealed a voice [that is] no longer capable of either gravity-defying gymnastics or soft coos,"&lt;ref name="7HMqX" /&gt; while [[AllMusic]] editor [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] expressed similar sentiments and wrote, "What is a greater problem is that Mariah's voice is shot, sounding in tatters throughout the record. She can no longer coo or softly croon nor can she perform her trademark gravity-defying vocal runs."&lt;ref name="lswjd" /&gt;

In April 2003, Carey announced she would be touring later in the year.&lt;ref name="vh1" /&gt; The [[Charmbracelet World Tour]]: An Intimate Evening with Mariah Carey, spanned North America and East Asia over three months, generally playing in smaller venues rather than arenas.&lt;ref name="vh2" /&gt; Throughout the United States, the shows were done in theaters, and something more Broadway-influenced, "It's much more intimate so you'll feel like you had an experience. You experience a night with me."&lt;ref name="vh1" /&gt; However, while smaller productions were booked throughout the tour's stateside leg, Carey performed at stadiums in Asia and Europe, performing for a crowd of over 35,000 in Manila, 50,000 in Malaysia, and to over 70,000 people in China.&lt;ref name="wiauS" /&gt; In the United Kingdom, it became Carey's first tour to feature shows outside London, booking arena stops in Glasgow, Birmingham and Manchester.&lt;ref name="Rjd4H" /&gt; Charmbracelet World Tour: An Intimate Evening with Mariah Carey garnered generally positive reviews from music critics and concert goers, with many complimenting the quality of Carey's live vocals, as well as the production as a whole.&lt;ref name="asilo" /&gt;

=== 2005–2007: Resurgence with ''The Emancipation of Mimi'' ===
[[File:Mariah Carey &amp; L.A. Reid 2005.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Carey, pictured with former [[Island Records]] head [[L.A. Reid]] in 2005, at the release party for ''The Emancipation of Mimi'']]

Throughout 2004, Carey focused on composing material for her tenth studio album, ''[[The Emancipation of Mimi]]'' (2005). The album found Carey working predominantly with [[Jermaine Dupri]], as well as [[Bryan-Michael Cox]], [[Manuel Seal]], [[The Neptunes]] and [[Kanye West]].&lt;ref name="viber" /&gt; The album debuted atop the charts in several countries, and was warmly accepted by critics. Caroline Sullivan of ''[[The Guardian]]'' defined it as "cool, focused and urban [... some of] the first Mariah Carey tunes in years which I wouldn't have to be paid to listen to again,"&lt;ref name="C7SHn" /&gt; while ''[[USA Today]]''{{'}}s Elysa Gardner wrote, "The ballads and midtempo numbers that truly reflect the renewed confidence of a songbird who has taken her shots and kept on flying."&lt;ref name="hTNKe" /&gt; The album's second single, "[[We Belong Together]]", became a "career re-defining"&lt;ref name="promo" /&gt; song for Carey, at a point when many critics had considered her career over.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5" /&gt; Music critics heralded the song as her "return to form,"&lt;ref name="slanter" /&gt; as well as the "return of The Voice,"&lt;ref name="slanter" /&gt; while many felt it would revive "faith" in Carey's potential as a [[ballad]]eer.&lt;ref name="viber" /&gt; "We Belong Together" broke several records in the United States and became Carey's sixteenth chart topper on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref name="records" /&gt; After staying at number one for fourteen non-consecutive weeks, the song became the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones|second longest running number one song in US chart history]], behind Carey's 1996 collaboration with [[Boyz II Men]], "[[One Sweet Day]]".&lt;ref name="records" /&gt; ''Billboard'' listed it as the "song of the decade" and the ninth most popular song of all time.&lt;ref name="yahoosales" /&gt; Besides its chart success, the song broke several airplay records, and according to Nielsen BDS, gathered both the largest one-day and one-week audiences in history.&lt;ref name="QmzjW" /&gt;

During the week of September 25, 2005, Carey set another record, becoming the first female to occupy the first two spots atop the Hot 100, as "We Belong Together" remained at number one, and her next single, "[[Shake It Off (Mariah Carey song)|Shake It Off]]" moved into the number two spot ([[Ashanti (singer)|Ashanti]] had topped the chart in 2002 while being a "featured" singer on the number two single).&lt;ref name="records" /&gt; On the [[Billboard Year-End|Billboard Hot 100 Year-end Chart]] of 2005, the song was declared the number one song, a career first for Carey.&lt;ref name="US_yearend" /&gt; ''Billboard'' listed "We Belong Together" ninth on The ''Billboard'' Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs and was declared the most popular song of the 2000s decade by ''Billboard''.&lt;ref name="decade" /&gt; The album earned ten [[Grammy Award]] nominations in 2006–07: eight in 2006 for the original release (the most received by Carey in a single year),&lt;ref name="usaawards" /&gt; and two in 2007 for the ''Ultra Platinum Edition'' (from which "[[Don't Forget About Us]]" became her seventeenth number-one hit). In 2006 Carey won [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album|Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album]] for ''The Emancipation of Mimi'', as well as [[Grammy Award for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance|Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song|Best R&amp;B Song]] for "We Belong Together".&lt;ref name="usaawards" /&gt; ''The Emancipation of Mimi'' was the best-selling album in the United States in 2005, with nearly five million units sold. It was the first album by a solo female artist to become the year's best-selling album since [[Alanis Morissette]]'s ''[[Jagged Little Pill]]'' in 1996.&lt;ref name="ABrS6" /&gt; At the end of 2005, the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry|IFPI]] reported that ''The Emancipation of Mimi'' had sold more than 7.7&amp;nbsp;million copies globally, and was the second-best-selling album of the year after [[Coldplay]]'s ''[[X&amp;Y]]''. It was the best-selling album worldwide by a solo and female artist.&lt;ref name="world2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="c4e1v" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cnpo6" /&gt; To date, ''The Emancipation of Mimi'' has sold over 12 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name="autogenerated11" /&gt; At the [[48th Grammy Awards]], Carey performed a medley of "We Belong Together" and "[[Fly Like a Bird]]".&lt;ref name="nemn" /&gt;

In support of the album, Carey embarked on her first headlining tour in three years, named [[The Adventures of Mimi]]: The Voice, The Hits, The Tour after a "Carey-centric fan's" music diary.&lt;ref name="H9Z0G" /&gt; The tour spanned forty stops, with thirty-two in the United States and Canada, two in Africa, and six in Japan.&lt;ref name="mtvnews8" /&gt; It received warm reaction from music critics and concert goers, many of which celebrated the quality of Carey's live vocals, as well as the show as a whole.&lt;ref name="outshines" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aLu19" /&gt; Carey played to about 60,000 fans in the two shows in [[Tunis]].&lt;ref name="4cluB" /&gt; ''[[The Adventures of Mimi (video)|The Adventures of Mimi]]'' [[DVD]] was released in November 2007 internationally and December 2007 in the U.S.

=== 2008–2009: ''E=MC²'', ''Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel'', and ''Precious'' ===
By spring 2007, Carey had begun to work on her eleventh studio album, ''[[E=MC² (Mariah Carey album)|E=MC²]]'', in a private villa in [[Anguilla]].&lt;ref name="9nue3" /&gt; Although ''E=MC²'' was well received by most critics,&lt;ref name="WA6Sk" /&gt; some of them criticized it for being very similar to the formula used on ''The Emancipation of Mimi''.&lt;ref name="angels" /&gt; Two weeks before the album's release, "[[Touch My Body]]", the record's lead single, reached the top position on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, becoming Carey's eighteenth number one and making her the solo artist with the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most number-one hits|most number one singles in United States history]], pushing her past [[Elvis Presley]] into second place according to the magazine's revised methodology.&lt;ref name="mpEdo" /&gt; Carey is second only to [[The Beatles]], who have twenty number-one singles. Additionally, it gave Carey her 79th week atop the Hot 100, tying her with Presley as the artist with the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most cumulative weeks at number one|most weeks at number one in the ''Billboard'' chart history]]."&lt;ref name="OGmfQ" /&gt;

[[File:Mariah Carey 2 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Carey at the 2008 [[Tribeca Film Festival]], displaying her engagement ring]]
''E=MC²'' debuted at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 with 463,000 copies sold, the biggest opening week sales of her career.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; In 2008, Carey also played an aspiring singer named Krystal in ''[[Tennessee (film)|Tennessee]]''&lt;ref name="wTYWf" /&gt; and had a [[cameo appearance]] in [[Adam Sandler]]'s film ''[[You Don't Mess with the Zohan]]'', playing herself.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Since the album's release, Carey had planned to embark on an extensive tour in support of ''E=MC²''.&lt;ref name="mtvvid2" /&gt; However the tour was suddenly cancelled in early December 2008.&lt;ref name="preg" /&gt; Carey later stated that she had been pregnant during that time period, and suffered a miscarriage, hence she cancelled the tour.&lt;ref name="42n3G" /&gt;&lt;ref name="derschowitz1" /&gt; On January 20, 2009, Carey performed "[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]]" at the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|Neighborhood Inaugural Ball]] after [[Barack Obama]] was sworn as the first African-American president of the United States.&lt;ref name="SEA2N" /&gt; On July 7, 2009, Carey – alongside [[Trey Lorenz]] – performed her version of [[The Jackson 5]] song "[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)#Mariah Carey version|I'll Be There]]" at the memorial service for [[Michael Jackson]].&lt;ref name="reuters" /&gt;

In 2009, she appeared as a [[social work]]er in ''[[Precious (film)|Precious]]'', the movie adaptation of the 1996 novel ''Push'' by [[Sapphire (author)|Sapphire]]. The film garnered mostly positive reviews from critics, also for Carey's performance.&lt;ref name="psG6u" /&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described her acting as "pitch-perfect."&lt;ref name="q3pCq" /&gt; In January 2010, Carey won the Breakthrough Actress Performance Award for her role in ''Precious'' at the [[Palm Springs International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Carey" /&gt; On September 25, 2009, Carey's twelfth studio album, ''[[Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel]]'', was released. Reception for the album was mostly mixed; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of [[AllMusic]] called it "her most interesting album in a decade,"&lt;ref name="29pfs" /&gt; while Jon Caramanica from ''[[The New York Times]]'' criticized Carey's vocal performances, decrying her overuse of her softer vocal registers at the expense of her more powerful lower and upper registers.&lt;ref name="bixu7" /&gt; Commercially, the album debuted at number three on the ''Billboard'' 200, and became the lowest-selling studio album of her career.&lt;ref name="f4xsP" /&gt; The album's lead single, "[[Obsessed (Mariah Carey song)|Obsessed]]",&lt;ref name="recs" /&gt; debuted at number eleven and peaked at number seven on the chart, and became Carey's 27th US top-ten hit, tying her with [[Elton John]] and [[Janet Jackson]] as the fifth most top-ten hits.&lt;ref name="recs" /&gt; The album's follow-up single, a cover of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]'s "[[I Want to Know What Love Is]]", managed to break airplay records in Brazil. The song spent 27 weeks atop the [[Brasil Hot 100 Airplay]], making it the longest running song in the chart's history.&lt;ref name="dCRom" /&gt;

On January 15, 2015, Carey announced her [[Number Ones (Mariah Carey residency)|Number Ones]] residency at [[The Colosseum at Caesars Palace]] in [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name="OytFb" /&gt; On January 30, it was announced that Carey has left [[Universal Music Group]]'s Def Jam Recordings to re-unite with [[L.A.

Carey told ''[[The New York Times]]'', "I thought it would be a good opportunity to kind of, like, show my personality and who I am, even though I feel like my real fans have an idea of who I am...

On December 31, 2016, Carey's performance on ''[[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve]]'' in [[Times Square]] received worldwide attention after technical difficulties caused Carey's [[in-ear monitor]]s to malfunction, resulting in what ''The New York Times'' referred to as a "performance train wreck."&lt;ref name="5eqQz" /&gt; The singer cited her inability to hear the music without in-ear auditory feedback as the cause for the mishap.&lt;ref name="6gRlu" /&gt; Carey's representatives and [[Dick Clark Productions]] placed blame on each other.&lt;ref name="NbZL3" /&gt;

On February 3, 2017, Carey released the single "[[I Don't (Mariah Carey song)|I Don't]]" featuring [[YG (rapper)|YG]].&lt;ref name="Billboard Artwork" /&gt; In February 8, 2017, she voiced the [[List of mayors of Gotham City|Mayor of Gotham City]], in the animated film ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]''.&lt;ref name="CareyCast" /&gt; In April 2017, it was announced that Carey is launching her own record label, [[Butterfly MC Records]], a joint partnership with Epic Records.&lt;ref name="J9JEk" /&gt; In July 2017, Carey made a cameo in the comedy film ''[[Girls Trip]]'', starring [[Queen Latifah]], [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] and [[Regina Hall]].&lt;ref name="OxmbP" /&gt; The same month, Carey embarked on a tour with [[Lionel Richie]], titled, [[All the Hits Tour (Lionel Richie and Mariah Carey)|All the Hits Tour]].&lt;ref name="MAqsy" /&gt; Carey was featured in the official remix for [[French Montana]]'s single "[[Unforgettable (French Montana song)|Unforgettable]]", alongside [[Swae Lee]].&lt;ref name="jwRwY" /&gt; In October 2017, Carey released a new soundtrack single, "The Star", for the [[The Star (2017 film)|movie of the same name]].&lt;ref name="1H5vo" /&gt; Carey also developed an animated Christmas film, titled ''Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You'', for which soundtrack she recorded an original song called "Lil' Snowman."

== Philanthropy and other activities ==
Carey is a philanthropist who has been involved with several charitable organizations.&lt;ref name="fresh" /&gt; She became associated with the [[Fresh Air Fund]] in the early 1990s, and is the co-founder of a camp located in [[Fishkill, New York|Fishkill]], New York, that enables inner-city youth to embrace the arts and introduces them to career opportunities.&lt;ref name="fresh" /&gt; The camp was called [[The Fresh Air Fund|Camp Mariah]] "for her generous support and dedication to Fresh Air children," and she received a Congressional Horizon Award for her youth-related charity work.&lt;ref name="2FiIF" /&gt; Carey also donated royalties from her hits "[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]]" and "[[One Sweet Day]]" to charities.&lt;ref name="billboard2" /&gt; She is well-known nationally for her work with the [[Make-A-Wish Foundation]] in granting the wishes of children with life-threatening illnesses, and in November 2006 she was awarded the Foundation's Wish Idol for her "extraordinary generosity and her many wish granting achievements."&lt;ref name="93zRj" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gy0mb" /&gt; Carey has volunteered for the [[Police Athletic League of New York City]] and contributed to the [[obstetrics]] department of [[NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital|New York Presbyterian Hospital]] Cornell Medical Center.&lt;ref name="pre" /&gt; A percentage of the sales of ''MTV Unplugged'' was donated to various other charities.&lt;ref name="pre" /&gt; In 2008, Carey was named Hunger Ambassador of the [[World Food Programme|World Hunger Relief Movement]].&lt;ref name="HFb8H" /&gt; In February 2010, the song, "[[100% (Mariah Carey song)|100%]]", which was originally written and recorded for the film, ''Precious'',&lt;ref name="uk7kr" /&gt; was used as one of the theme songs for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], with all money proceeds going to [[United States Olympic Committee|Team USA]].&lt;ref name="wVfJV" /&gt;

One of Carey's most high-profile benefit concert appearances was on VH1's 1998 ''[[VH1 Divas|Divas Live]]'' special, during which she performed alongside other female singers in support of the Save the Music Foundation.&lt;ref name="divas" /&gt; The concert was a ratings success, and Carey participated in the [[VH1 Divas#Divas 2000|Divas 2000]] special.&lt;ref name="divas" /&gt; In 2007, the Save the Music Foundation honored Carey at their tenth gala event for her support towards the foundation since its inception.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AwxTJ" /&gt; She appeared at the ''[[America: A Tribute to Heroes]]'' nationally televised fundraiser in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]], and in December 2001, she performed before peacekeeping troops in [[Kosovo]].&lt;ref name="6yvtj" /&gt; Carey hosted the [[CBS]] television special ''At Home for the Holidays'', which documented real-life stories of adopted children and foster families.&lt;ref name="qjRbw" /&gt; In 2005, Carey performed for [[Live 8 concert, London|Live 8 in London]]&lt;ref name="bbcnews" /&gt; and at the [[Hurricane Katrina]] relief telethon "Shelter from the Storm."&lt;ref name="wzFWc" /&gt; In August 2008, Carey and other singers recorded the charity single, "[[Just Stand Up!|Just Stand Up]]" produced by [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]] and [[L.A. Reid|L. A. Reid]], to support [[Stand Up to Cancer]].&lt;ref name="LVp8d" /&gt; In 2008, Carey performed in a New Year's Eve concert for the family of Libyan dictator [[Muammar Gaddafi]], something she later claimed to "feel horrible and embarrassed to have participated in."&lt;ref name="PyrdT" /&gt; In March 2011, Carey's representative Cindi Berger stated that royalties for the song "Save The Day", which was written for her fourteenth studio album, would be donated to charities that create awareness to human rights issues to make amends for the Gadaffi error. Berger also said that "Mariah has and continues to donate her time, money and countless hours of personal service to many organizations both here and abroad."&lt;ref name="billboard2" /&gt; "Save The Day" was never released.

Declining offers to appear in commercials in the United States during her early career, Carey was not involved in brand marketing initiatives until 2006, when she participated in endorsements for [[Intel]] [[Centrino]] personal computers and launched a jewelry and accessories line for teenagers, Glamorized, in American [[Claire's]] and Icing stores.&lt;ref name="jqmov" /&gt; During this period, as part of a partnership with [[Pepsi]] and [[Motorola]], Carey recorded and promoted a series of exclusive [[ringtone]]s, including "Time of Your Life".&lt;ref name="EAsHr" /&gt; She signed a licensing deal with the cosmetics company [[Elizabeth Arden]], and in 2007, she released her own fragrance, "[[M (fragrance)|M]]."&lt;ref name="mtv1" /&gt; The Elizabeth Arden deal has netted her $150&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="xVhUT" /&gt; In 2007, ''[[Forbes]]'' named her as the fifth richest woman in entertainment, with an estimated net worth of US$270&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="namerer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DbpAe" /&gt; In November 2011, it was reported that Carey's net worth was valued at more than $500&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="enter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="highestpaid" /&gt; On November 29, 2010, she debuted a collection on [[Home Shopping Network|HSN]], which included jewelry, shoes and fragrances.&lt;ref name="Hzahz" /&gt; In 2013, human rights activists criticized Carey for performing in a concert for [[Angola]]'s "father-daughter kleptocracy" and accused her of accepting "dictator cash."&lt;ref name="EAxEE" /&gt;

== Artistry ==

=== Influences ===
Carey has said that from childhood she has been influenced by [[Billie Holiday]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and R&amp;B and soul musicians such as [[Al Green]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Gladys Knight]] and [[Aretha Franklin]].&lt;ref name="black" /&gt; Her music contains strong influences of [[gospel music]], and she credits [[The Clark Sisters]], [[Shirley Caesar]] and [[Edwin Hawkins]] as the most influential in her early years.&lt;ref name="black" /&gt; When Carey incorporated [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] into her sound, speculation arose that she was making an attempt to take advantage of the genre's popularity, but she told ''[[Newsweek]]'', "People just don't understand. I grew up with this music."{{sfn|Shapiro|2001|p=124}} She has expressed appreciation for rappers such as [[The Sugarhill Gang]], [[Eric B. &amp; Rakim]], the [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] and [[Mobb Deep]], with whom she collaborated on the single "[[The Roof (Back in Time)]]" (1998).&lt;ref name="vinsky" /&gt; Carey was heavily influenced by [[Minnie Riperton]], and began experimenting with the whistle register due to her original practice of the range.&lt;ref name="vinsky" /&gt;

During Carey's career, her vocal and musical style, along with her level of success, has been compared to [[Whitney Houston]], who she has also cited as an influence,&lt;ref name="FOX" /&gt; and [[Celine Dion]]. Carey and her peers, according to Garry Mulholland, are "the princesses of wails [...] virtuoso vocalists who blend chart-oriented pop with mature [[middle of the road (music)|MOR]] [[torch song]]."&lt;ref name="Mul" /&gt; Author and writer Lucy O'Brien attributed the comeback of [[Barbra Streisand]]'s "old-fashioned showgirl" to Carey and Dion, and described them and Houston as "groomed, airbrushed and overblown to perfection."&lt;ref name="Mul" /&gt; Carey's musical transition and use of more revealing clothing during the late 1990s were, in part, initiated to distance herself from this image, and she subsequently said that most of her early work was "schmaltzy MOR."&lt;ref name="Mul" /&gt; Some have noted that unlike Houston and Dion, Carey co-writes and produces her own songs.&lt;ref name="James" /&gt;

=== Musical style ===
[[File:Mimivegas.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Carey performing at a concert in Las Vegas in 2010]]
Love is the subject of the majority of Carey's lyrics, although she has written about themes such as racism, [[social alienation]], death, [[Malnutrition|world hunger]], and [[spirituality]]. She has said that much of her work is partly autobiographical, but ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine wrote: "If only Mariah Carey's music had the drama of her life. Her songs are often sugary and artificial—[[NutraSweet]] soul. But her life has passion and conflict," applying it to the first stages of her career. He commented that as her albums progressed, so too her songwriting and music blossomed into more mature and meaningful material.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt; Jim Faber of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'', made similar comments, "For Carey, vocalizing is all about the performance, not the emotions that inspired it. Singing, to her, represents a physical challenge, not an emotional unburdening."&lt;ref name="uGMRL" /&gt; While reviewing ''Music Box'', Stephen Holden from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' commented that Carey sang with "sustained passion," while Arion Berger of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote that during some vocal moments, Carey becomes "too overwhelmed to put her passion into words."&lt;ref name="g5NvI" /&gt; In 2001, ''[[The Village Voice]]'' wrote in regards to what they considered Carey's "centerless ballads," writing, "Carey's [[Strawberry Shortcake]] soul still provides the template with which [[teen pop|teen-pop]] cuties draw curlicues around those centerless [[Diane Warren|[Diane] Warren]] ballads [.....] it's largely because of [Blige] that the new R&amp;B demands a greater range of emotional expression, smarter poetry, more from-the-gut testifying, and less [sic] unnecessary notes than the squeaky-clean and just plain squeaky Mariah era. Nowadays it's the [[Christina Aguilera]]s and [[Jessica Simpson]]s who awkwardly oversing, while the women with roof-raising lung power keep it in check when tune or lyric demands."&lt;ref name="Q5Zfi" /&gt;

Carey's output makes use of [[electronic musical instrument|electronic instruments]] such as [[drum machine]]s,&lt;ref name="viber" /&gt; [[electronic keyboard|keyboards]] and synthesizers.&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt; Many of her songs contain piano-driven melodies,&lt;ref name="rs" /&gt; as she was given piano lessons when she was six years old.&lt;ref name="nick3" /&gt; Carey said that she cannot read [[sheet music]] and prefers to collaborate with a pianist when composing her material, but feels that it is easier to experiment with faster and less conventional [[melody|melodies]] and [[chord progression]]s using this technique.&lt;ref name="nick3" /&gt; While Carey learned to play the piano at a young age, and incorporates several ranges of production and instrumentation into her music, she has maintained that her voice has always been her most important asset: "My voice is my instrument; it always has been."&lt;ref name="shapiro20" /&gt; Carey began commissioning [[remix]]es of her material early in her career and helped to spearhead the practice of recording entirely new vocals for remixes.&lt;ref name="MTV-Oct2003" /&gt; Disc jockey [[David Morales]] has collaborated with Carey on several occasions, starting with "[[Dreamlover (song)|Dreamlover]]" (1993), which popularized the tradition of remixing R&amp;B songs into [[house music|house]] records, and which ''[[Slant Magazine|Slant]]'' magazine named one of the greatest dance songs of all time.&lt;ref name="xYM1F" /&gt; From "[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]]" (1995) onward, Carey enlisted both hip-hop and house producers to re-structure her album compositions.&lt;ref name="shapiro17" /&gt; ''Entertainment Weekly'' included two remixes of "Fantasy" on a list of Carey's greatest recordings compiled in 2005: a National Dance Music Award-winning remix produced by Morales, and a [[Sean Combs]] production featuring rapper [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]].&lt;ref name="UrIRl" /&gt; The latter has been credited with popularizing the R&amp;B/hip-hop collaboration trend that has continued into the 2000s, through artists such as [[Ashanti (singer)|Ashanti]] and [[Beyoncé]].&lt;ref name="MTV-Oct2003" /&gt; Combs said that Carey "knows the importance of mixes, so you feel like you're with an artist who appreciates your work—an artist who wants to come up with something with you."&lt;ref name="viberness" /&gt;

=== Voice and timbre ===
Carey possesses a [[Vocal range|five-octave vocal range]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KKHEv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="E12Ji" /&gt; and has the ability to reach notes beyond the 7th octave.&lt;ref name="sRbWm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HQh4d" /&gt; Referred to as the "songbird supreme" by the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'',&lt;ref name="James" /&gt; she was ranked first in a 2003 MTV and ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' magazine countdown of the 22 Greatest Voices in Music, as voted by fans and readers in an online poll. Carey said of the poll, "What it really means is voice of the MTV generation. Of course, it's an enormous compliment, but I don't feel that way about myself."&lt;ref name="iiIbd" /&gt; She also placed second in ''Cove'' magazine's list of "The 100 Outstanding Pop Vocalists."&lt;ref name="100 Outstanding Pop Vocalists" /&gt;

Regarding her [[voice type]], Carey said that she is an [[alto]], though several critics have described her as a [[Coloratura soprano]].&lt;ref name="kIJ0L" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ym1CZ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.ca" /&gt; The singer claims that she has [[Vocal fold nodule|nodules]] in her vocal cords since childhood, due to which she can sing in a higher register than others. However, tiredness and sleep deprivation can affect her vocals due to the nodules, and Carey explained that she went through a lot of practice to maintain a balance during singing.&lt;ref name="vinsky" /&gt;&lt;ref name="3fqV5" /&gt;

[[Jon Pareles]] of ''The New York Times'' described Carey's lower register as a "rich, husky alto" that extends to "dog-whistle high notes."&lt;ref name="nytreview" /&gt; Additionally, towards the late 1990s, Carey began incorporating [[Breathy voice|breathy vocals]] into her material.&lt;ref name="charm" /&gt; Tim Levell from the BBC News described her vocals as "sultry close-to-the-mic breathiness,"&lt;ref name="charm" /&gt; while ''USA Today''{{'}}s Elysa Gardner wrote "it's impossible to deny the impact her vocal style, a florid blend of breathy riffing and resonant belting, has had on today's young pop and R&amp;B stars."&lt;ref name="gold" /&gt;

Sasha Frere-Jones of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' adds her [[timbre]] possesses various colors, saying, "Carey's sound changes with nearly every line, mutating from a steely tone to a vibrating growl and then to a humid, breathy coo. Her wide vocal range allows Carey to take melodies from alto bottom notes to coloratura soprano upper register."&lt;ref name="newyorker" /&gt; Carey also possesses a "whisper register." In an interview with the singer, Ron Givens of ''Entertainment Weekly'' described it this way, "first, a rippling, soulful ooh comes rolling effortlessly from her throat: alto. Then, after a quick breath, she goes for the stratosphere, with a sound that nearly changes the barometric pressure in the room. In one brief swoop, she seems to squeal and roar at the same time."&lt;ref name="siSJg" /&gt;

Her sense of pitch is admired&lt;ref name="nytreview" /&gt; and Jon Pareles adds "she can linger over sensual turns, growl with playful confidence, syncopate like a [[scat singing|scat singer]]... with startlingly exact pitch."&lt;ref name="nytreview" /&gt;

Carey's vocal style and singing ability have significantly impacted popular and contemporary music. As music critic G. Brown from ''[[The Denver Post]]'' wrote, "For better or worse, Mariah Carey's five-octave range and melismatic style have influenced a generation of pop singers."&lt;ref name="DKTHK" /&gt; According to ''Rolling Stone'', "Her mastery of melisma, the fluttering strings of notes that decorate songs like "[[Vision of Love]]", inspired the entire ''[[American Idol]]'' vocal school, for better or worse, and virtually every other female R&amp;B singer since the Nineties."&lt;ref name="great" /&gt; Jody Rosen of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' wrote of Carey's influence in modern music, calling her the most influential vocal stylist of the last two decades, the person who made rococo melismatic singing.&lt;ref name="slate.com" /&gt; Rosen further exemplified Carey's influence by drawing parallel with American Idol, which to her, "often played out as a clash of melisma-mad Mariah wannabes. And, today, nearly 20 years after Carey's debut, major labels continue to bet the farm on young stars such as the winner of Britain's X Factor show, [[Leona Lewis]], with her Generation Next gloss on Mariah's big voice and big hair."&lt;ref name="slate.com" /&gt; Sean Daly of ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' wrote, "Depending on how you feel about public humiliation, the best/worst parts of American Idol are the audition shows, which normally break down into three distinct parts:(1) The Talented Kids.(2) The Weird Kids.(3) The Mariahs." Daly further commented, "The Mariahs are the hardest ones to watch, mainly because most of them think they're reeeaaally good. The poor, disillusioned hopefuls plant themselves in front of judges [[Simon Cowell]], [[Paula Abdul]] and [[Randy Jackson]]&amp;nbsp;– then proceed to stretch, break and mutilate every note of a song, often Mariah's Hero, a tune that has ruined more throats than smoker's cough."&lt;ref name="npr.org" /&gt; ''New York Magazine's'' editor Roger Deckker said that in regarding Carey as an influential artist in music, he commented that "Whitney Houston may have introduced melisma (the vocally acrobatic style of lending a word an extra syllable or twenty) to the charts, but it was Mariah—with her jaw-dropping range—who made it into America's default sound." Deckker also added that "Every time you turn on American Idol, you are watching her children."&lt;ref name="nymag1" /&gt; Despite her vocal prowess, Carey's vocal technique particularly with the use of [[melisma]] and [[belting (music)|belting]], has been subject to public scrutiny mainly because of young singers such as from talent shows have been overly imitating her singing technique in which critics commented "Mariah Carey is, without a doubt, the worst thing to happen to amateur singing since the karaoke machine."&lt;ref name="npr.org" /&gt; As Professor Katherine L. Meizel noted in her book, ''The Mediation of Identity Politics in American Idol'', "Carey's influence not just stops in the emulation of melisma or her singing amongst the wannabe's, it's also her persona, her diva, her stardom which inspires them.... a pre-fame conic look."&lt;ref name="rAqlU" /&gt;

Among the hip hop, pop, and R&amp;B artists who have cited Carey as an influence are [[Aneeka]],&lt;ref name="aneeka-recording" /&gt; [[Ariana Grande]],&lt;ref name="Influences1" /&gt; [[Britney Spears]],&lt;ref name="asn0B" /&gt; [[Beyoncé]],&lt;ref name="newyorker" /&gt; [[Katy Perry]],&lt;ref name="fr7SY" /&gt; [[Lady Gaga]],&lt;ref name="Qgyue" /&gt; [[Bridgit Mendler]],&lt;ref name="VkKea" /&gt; [[Christina Aguilera]],&lt;ref name="vol" /&gt; [[Jessica Simpson]],&lt;ref name="gold" /&gt; [[Rihanna]],&lt;ref name="mtv.com" /&gt; [[Grimes (musician)|Grimes]],&lt;ref name="DslnP" /&gt; [[Kelly Clarkson]],&lt;ref name="USSEt" /&gt; [[Nelly Furtado]],&lt;ref name="W7Gof" /&gt; [[Bonnie McKee]],&lt;ref name="Y4o2M" /&gt; Leona Lewis,&lt;ref name="MQsC8" /&gt; [[Brandy Norwood]],&lt;ref name="great" /&gt; [[Pink (singer)|Pink]],&lt;ref name="2aLpR" /&gt; [[Mary J. Blige]],&lt;ref name="MtvqI" /&gt; [[Melanie Fiona]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated10" /&gt; [[Missy Elliott]],&lt;ref name="newyorker" /&gt; [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]],&lt;ref name="a9oYo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LPGxp" /&gt; [[Hikaru Utada]],&lt;ref name="hikaru" /&gt; [[Regine Velasquez]], [[Sarah Geronimo]], [[Charice Pempengco|Charice]]&lt;ref name="8ijfi" /&gt; [[Jordin Sparks]],&lt;ref name="MlEW8" /&gt; [[Justin Bieber]],&lt;ref name="ZrR1j" /&gt; [[Jessica Sanchez]],&lt;ref name="ZsJ01" /&gt; and [[Sandy (singer)|Sandy]].&lt;ref name="xvH4w" /&gt; According to [[Stevie Wonder]], "When people talk about the great influential singers, they talk about [[Aretha Franklin|Aretha]], [[Whitney Houston|Whitney]] and Mariah. That's a testament to her talent. Her range is that amazing."&lt;ref name="vibe" /&gt; Beyoncé credits Carey's singing and her song "Vision of Love" as influencing her to begin practicing vocal "runs" as a child, as well as helping her pursue a career as a musician.&lt;ref name="newyorker" /&gt; Rihanna has stated that Carey is one of her major influences and idol.&lt;ref name="mtv.com" /&gt; Aguilera said in the early stages of her career that Carey was a big influence in her singing career and one of her idols.&lt;ref name="vol" /&gt; According to Pier Dominguez, author of ''Christina Aguilera: A star is made'', Aguilera has stated how she loved listening to Whitney Houston, but it was Carey who had the biggest influence on her vocal styling. Carey's carefully choreographed image of a grown woman struck a chord with Aguilera. Her influence on Aguilera also grew from the fact that both are of mixed heritage.&lt;ref name="nytiN" /&gt; Philip Brasor, editor of ''[[The Japan Times]]'', expressed how Carey's vocal and melismatic style even influenced Asian singers. He wrote that Japanese singer Hikaru Utada "sang what she heard, from the diaphragm and with her own take on the kind of melisma that became de rigueur in American pop after the ascendance of Mariah Carey."&lt;ref name="hikaru" /&gt; In an article titled "Out With Mariah's Melisma, In With Kesha's Kick", writer [[David Browne (journalist)|David Browne]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' discusses how the once ubiquitous melisma pop style suddenly lost in favor of the now ubiquitous [[autotune]] in which the former was heavily popularized by the likes of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. Browne had commented "But beginning two decades ago, melisma overtook pop in a way it hadn't before. Mariah Carey's debut hit from 1990, "Vision of Love", followed two years later by Whitney Houston's version of "I Will Always Love You", set the bar insanely high for notes stretched louder, longer and knottier than most pop fans had ever heard." Browne further added "A subsequent generation of singers, including Ms. Aguilera, Jennifer Hudson and Beyoncé, built their careers around melisma. (Men like Brian McKnight and Tyrese also indulged in it, but women tended to dominate the form.)"&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;

Carey is also credited for introducing R&amp;B and hip hop into mainstream pop culture, and for popularizing rap as a featuring act through her post-1995 songs. Sasha Frere-Jones, editor of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' commented, "It became standard for R&amp;B/hip-hop stars like Missy Elliott and Beyoncé, to combine melodies with rapped verses. And young white pop stars—including Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson, Christina Aguilera, and [[NSYNC|'N Sync]]—have spent much of the past ten years making pop music that is unmistakably R&amp;B." Moreover Jones concludes that "[Carey's] idea of pairing a female songbird with the leading male MCs of hip-hop changed R&amp;B and, eventually, all of pop. Although now anyone is free to use this idea, the success of ''The Emancipation of Mimi'' suggests that it still belongs to Carey."&lt;ref name="newyorker" /&gt; Judnick Mayard, writer of ''The Fader'', wrote that in regarding of R&amp;B and hip hop collaboration, "The champion of this movement is Mariah Carey." Mayard also expressed that "To this day ODB and Mariah may still be the best and most random hip hop collaboration of all time," citing that due to the record "[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]]", "R&amp;B and Hip-Hop were the best of step siblings."&lt;ref name="thefader.com" /&gt; Kelefa Sanneh of ''The New York Times'' wrote, "In the mid-1990s Ms. Carey pioneered a subgenre that some people call the thug-love duet. Nowadays clean-cut pop stars are expected to collaborate with roughneck rappers, but when Ms. Carey teamed up with Ol' Dirty Bastard, of the Wu-Tang Clan, for the 1995 hit "Fantasy (Remix)", it was a surprise, and a smash."&lt;ref name="autogenerated7" /&gt; Aside from her pop culture and musical influence, Carey is credited for releasing a classic Christmas song called "[[All I Want for Christmas Is You]]."&lt;ref name="scotherlad" /&gt; In a retrospective look at Carey's career, [[Sasha Frere-Jones]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' said, the "charming" song was one of Carey's biggest accomplishments, calling it "one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon."&lt;ref name="newyorker" /&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked "All I Want for Christmas Is You" fourth on its Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs list, calling it a "holiday standard."&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; In a review of her ''[[Greatest Hits (Mariah Carey album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album, Devon Powers of [[PopMatters]] writes that "She has influenced countless female vocalists after her. At 32, she is already a living legend—even if she never sings another note."&lt;ref name="zefCx" /&gt; While reviewing a concert of Carey in [[Sydney]], Elise Vout of ''[[MTV Australia]]'' wrote that "it's not amazing choreography or high production value you're going to see, it's the larger than life personality, unique voice, and legend that is Mariah Carey."&lt;ref name="tjqB1" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
Carey began dating [[Tommy Mottola]] while recording ''Music Box'',&lt;ref name="shapiro5" /&gt; and married him on June 5, 1993.&lt;ref name="shapiro6" /&gt; After the release of ''Daydream'' and the success that followed, Carey began focusing on her personal life, which was a constant struggle at the time.&lt;ref name="nickson38" /&gt; Carey's relationship with Mottola began to deteriorate, due to their growing creative differences in terms of her albums, as well as his controlling nature.&lt;ref name="nickson38" /&gt; On May 30, 1997, the couple announced their separation,&lt;ref name="3dJzM" /&gt; with their divorce finalized by the time Mottola remarried on December 2, 2000.&lt;ref name="mottola-remarries" /&gt; Carey was in a three-year relationship with singer [[Luis Miguel]] from 1998 to 2001.&lt;ref name="Luis Miguel Relationship" /&gt;

Carey met actor and comedian [[Nick Cannon]] while they shot her music video for her song "[[Bye Bye (Mariah Carey song)|Bye Bye]]" on an island off the coast of [[Antigua]].&lt;ref name="success" /&gt; On April 30, 2008, Carey married Cannon in [[The Bahamas]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated12" /&gt; At 35 weeks into her pregnancy, she gave birth to their [[fraternal twin]]s, Moroccan and Monroe, on April 30, 2011&lt;ref name="cmTko" /&gt; via [[Cesarean section]].&lt;ref name="xmnMH" /&gt;

In August 2014, Cannon confirmed he and Carey had separated a few months earlier.&lt;ref name="ze40C" /&gt; He filed for divorce on December 12, 2014.&lt;ref name="edivorce" /&gt; It was finalized in 2016.&lt;ref name="I9uHJ" /&gt;

On January 21, 2016, Carey and Australian billionaire [[James Packer]] announced that they were engaged.&lt;ref name="WKpgR" /&gt; By October, however, they had ended their engagement.&lt;ref name="KgfRJ" /&gt;

Carey is an active [[Episcopal Church (USA)|Episcopalian]].&lt;ref name="aK7Oj" /&gt; She stated in 2006: "I do believe that I have been [[born again (Christianity)|born again]] in a lot of ways. I think what I've changed are my priorities and my relationships with [[God in Christianity|God]]. I feel the difference when I don't have my private moments to pray. ... I'm a fighter, but I learned that I'm not in charge. Whatever God wants to happen is what's going to happen. I feel like I've had endless second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth chances. It's by the grace of God I'm still here."&lt;ref name="wVmhp" /&gt;

In April 2018, Carey opened up about her struggle with [[bipolar II disorder]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She, self-reportedly, was diagnosed in 2001, but kept the diagnosis private. Recently, she has sought out treatment in the form of medication and therapy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13876">'''Mediated communication''' or '''mediated interaction''' (less often, '''mediated discourse''') refers to communication carried out by the use of [[information communication technology]] and can be contrasted to [[face-to-face communication]].&lt;ref name="Crowley(prof.)1994"/&gt; While nowadays the technology we use is often related to computers, giving rise to the popular term [[computer-mediated communication]], mediated technology need not be computerized as writing a letter using a pen and a piece of paper is also using mediated communication.&lt;ref name="Davis2000"/&gt; Thus, Davis defines mediated communication as the use of any technical medium for transmission across time and space.&lt;ref name="Davis2000"/&gt;

Historically, mediated communication was much rarer than the face-to-face method.&lt;ref name="OlickVinitzky-Seroussi2011"/&gt; Even though humans possessed the technology to communicate in space and time for millennia, the majority of the world's population lacked skills such as [[literacy]] to use them.&lt;ref name="OlickVinitzky-Seroussi2011"/&gt; This began to change in Europe with the [[Movable type|invention of the printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] that led to the spread of printed texts and rising literacy from the 15th century.&lt;ref name="OlickVinitzky-Seroussi2011"/&gt; Separately, the first [[print culture]] was Chinese in origin.&lt;ref name="metropolitan"/&gt; Whatever the tradition, [[face-to-face interaction]] has begun to steadily lose ground to mediated communication.&lt;ref name="OlickVinitzky-Seroussi2011"/&gt;

Compared to face-to-face communication, mediated communication engages fewer senses, transmits fewer symbolic cues (most mediated communication does not transmit [[facial expressions]]) and is seen as more private.&lt;ref name="SchementRuben1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson1995-8384"/&gt; Parties usually require some technical expertise to operate the mediating technologies.&lt;ref name="WaldeckKearney2012"/&gt; New computerized media, such as [[mobile telephones]] or [[instant messaging]], allow mediated communication to transmit more oral and nonverbal symbols than the older generation of tools.&lt;ref name="WaldeckKearney2012"/&gt;

The type of mediated technology used can also influence its meaning.&lt;ref name="WaldeckKearney2012"/&gt; This is most famously rendered in [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s maxim "[[the medium is the message]]".&lt;ref name="Grosswiler2010"/&gt;

Lundby (2009) distinguished between three forms of mediated communication: mediated [[interpersonal communication]], [[interactive communication]], and [[mass communication]].&lt;ref name="Lundby2009"/&gt;  Thompson (1995), however, treated mass communication not as a part of mediated communication, but on par with mediated and face-to-face communication, terming it "mediated quasi-interaction".&lt;ref name="Thompson1995-8384"/&gt;

== Differences from face-to-face communication ==
There are only a few ways that mediated communication and face-to-face communication function similarly. One of them is that [[Social skills|interpersonal coordination]] is present in both face-to-face and mediated communication.&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt; However, mediated communication has vast differences and limitations compared with face-to-face communication. [[Writing]] in communication media and [[speech]] in face-to-face communication are different in terms of their [[lexical density]], range of [[Grammar|grammatical structures]], varied connectivity between sentences, [[syntax]], permanence, etc.&lt;ref name="Cambridge" /&gt; These differences in each type of communication can change the message.&lt;ref name="Cambridge" /&gt; [[Texting]] and [[e-mail]], for example, contain combined forms of writing and speech, which is evident by [[slang]] and [[shorthand]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge" /&gt; Also, no [[Nonverbal communication|nonverbal cues]] can be sent through mediated communication, so received information can be harder to understand.&lt;ref name="McCornack/Ortiz" /&gt; Verbal (or textual) cues are used instead of nonverbal ones to convey the same messages.&lt;ref name="McCornack/Ortiz" /&gt;

Individuals send more information at a time through computer media than any other form of communication, including face-to-face communication.&lt;ref name="Friend/FoxHamilton" /&gt; This increased rate of information transfer allows abusive forms of communication like [[cyberbullying]] and [[phishing]] to occur.&lt;ref name="Friend/FoxHamilton" /&gt; The [[disassociation]] and [[disinhibition]] associated with mediated communication can cause people who are being deceived to have trouble interpreting the reactions of the deceiver since information sent through media instead of face-to-face can lose or have change the nonverbal cues within it, and, with that, signs of deception.&lt;ref name="Friend/FoxHamilton" /&gt; The decreased availability of these nonverbal cues increases disassociation and anonymity.&lt;ref name="Friend/FoxHamilton" /&gt; It is easier to trust someone else through mediated communication, but people with less trust can detect deception better online.&lt;ref name="Friend/FoxHamilton" /&gt;

Because of the limitations of mediated communication, Nardi and Whittaker (2002) note, "Many theorists imply that face-to-face communication is the gold standard of communication."&lt;ref name="HindsKiesler2002-83" /&gt; Mediated communication has been, however, described as more preferable in some situations, particularly where time and geographical distance are an issue.&lt;ref name="HindsKiesler2002-83" /&gt; For example, in maintaining long-distance friendship, face-to-face communication was only the fourth most common way of maintaining ties, after mediated communication tools of [[telephone]], email and [[instant messaging]].&lt;ref name="WrightWebb2011-236" /&gt;

== Uses ==
Individuals will use different types of media depending on their motivations,&lt;ref name="Namkee" /&gt; communication purpose, institutional factors, and situational factors.&lt;ref name="Watson-Manheim/Belanger"/&gt; Also, people will be more inclined to use a particular medium of communication if others associated with them use that medium; this is called the [[network effect]].&lt;ref name="Namkee" /&gt; Motivations for using certain media are divided into [[Interpersonal ties|strong- and weak-tie]] communication.&lt;ref name="Namkee" /&gt; There are five communication purposes: coordination, knowledge-sharing, information gathering, relationship development, and conflict resolution.&lt;ref name="Watson-Manheim/Belanger" /&gt; Institutional factors include the physical structure of work units, social structure, and incentives.&lt;ref name="Watson-Manheim/Belanger" /&gt; Situational factors include task characteristics, message content, and urgency.&lt;ref name="Watson-Manheim/Belanger" /&gt;

Mediated communication is not as commonly used as face-to-face communication in the workplace, but there are different preferred media of communication for simple forms of coordination.&lt;ref name="Watson-Manheim/Belanger" /&gt; E-mails and phone calls tend to be used for simple or complex coordination, but e-mails are also useful for retaining information and recording the exchange of information.&lt;ref name="Watson-Manheim/Belanger" /&gt; In terms of communication solutions to certain situational factors, e-mails are used for recording the transfer of information and sending long, complex, and non-textual information, and phone calls and pagers are used for immediate communication.&lt;ref name="Watson-Manheim/Belanger" /&gt; E-mails and phone calls are also used in knowledge sharing and information gathering.&lt;ref name="Watson-Manheim/Belanger" /&gt; E-mails are rarely used to accomplish relationship goals, but they are used for conflict resolution.&lt;ref name="Watson-Manheim/Belanger" /&gt; Individuals have a higher motivation to use cell-phone texting for weak-tie communication.&lt;ref name="Namkee"/&gt; The network effect has the most impact on e-mail, meaning that people tend to use e-mail more if their peers use it, too.&lt;ref name="Namkee"/&gt;

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar |Communities}}

'''Mizrahi Jews''', '''Mizrahim''' ({{lang-he|{{hebrew|מִזְרָחִים}}}}), also referred to as '''Edot HaMizrach''' ({{Hebrew|עֲדוֹת-הַמִּזְרָח}}; "Communities of the East"; Mizrahi Hebrew: ''{{transl|he|ʿEdot(h) Ha(m)Mizraḥ}}''), '''{{transl|he|Bene HaMizrah}}''' ("Sons of the East"), or '''Oriental Jews''',&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mizrahi Jews |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/432355/Oriental-Jews |publisher=''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''|access-date=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are descendants of local Jewish communities in the [[Middle East]] from biblical times into the modern era. They include descendants of [[Babylonian Jews]] and [[Mountain Jews]] from modern [[Iraqi Jews|Iraq]], [[Syrian Jews|Syria]], [[Bahraini Jews|Bahrain]], [[History of the Jews in Kuwait|Kuwait]], [[Mountain Jews|Dagestan]], [[History of the Jews in Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]], [[Persian Jews|Iran]], [[Bukharian Jews|Uzbekistan]], the [[Caucasus Jews|Caucasus]], [[Kurdish Jews|Kurdistan]], [[History of the Jews in Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[Indian Jews|India]], and [[Pakistani Jews|Pakistan]]. [[Yemenite Jews]], as well as [[North African Jews]] are sometimes also included, but their histories are separate from Babylonian Jewry.

The use of the term Mizrahi can be somewhat controversial. The term Mizrahim is sometimes applied to descendants of [[Maghrebi Jews|Maghrebi]] and [[Sephardi Jews]], who had lived in North Africa ([[Egyptian Jews|Egypt]], [[Libyan Jews|Libya]], [[Tunisian Jew|Tunisia]], [[Algerian Jews|Algeria]], and [[Moroccan Jews|Morocco]]), the Sephardi-proper communities of [[Turkish Jews|Turkey]], and the mixed Levantine communities of [[History of the Jews in Lebanon|Lebanon]], [[Old Yishuv|Israel]], and [[Syrian Jews|Syria]]. Before the establishment of the state of [[Israel]], Mizrahi Jews did not identify themselves as a separate Jewish subgroup. Instead, Mizrahi Jews generally characterized themselves as ''Sephardi'', as they follow the traditions of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi Judaism]] (but with some differences among the ''[[minhag]]'' "customs" of particular communities). That has resulted in a conflation of terms, particularly in Israel and in religious usage, with "Sephardi" being used in a broad sense and including Mizrahi Jews and North African Jews as well as Sephardim proper. From the point of view of the official Israeli rabbinate, any [[rabbi]]s of Mizrahi origin in Israel are under the jurisdiction of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel]].

As of 2005, 61% of Israeli Jews were of full or partial Mizrahi ancestry.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Jews, Arabs, and Arab Jews: The Politics of Identity and Reproduction in Israel'', Ducker, Clare Louise, [[Institute of Social Studies]], The Hague, Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2015}}
"Mizrahi" is literally translated as "Oriental", "Eastern", {{hebrew|מזרח}} ''Mizraḥ'', Hebrew for "east". In Arabic, "Misr" means Egypt; and that is also the term used for Egypt in the Bible. In the past the word "Mizrahim", corresponding to the Arabic word ''[[Mashriq]]iyyun'' (Easterners), referred to the natives of Kurdistan, Iraq and other Asian countries, as distinct from those of North Africa (''[[Maghreb|Maghribiyyun]]''). In medieval and early modern times, the corresponding Hebrew word ''ma'arav'' was used for North Africa. In Talmudic and [[Geonim|Geonic]] times, however, this word "ma'arav" referred to the land of Israel, as contrasted with Babylonia. For this reason, many object to the use of "Mizrahi" to include Moroccan and other North African Jews.

The term Mizrahim or ''Edot Hamizraḥ'', Oriental communities, grew in Israel under the circumstances of the meeting of waves of Jewish immigrants from Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, followers of Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Temani (Yemenite) rites. In modern [[Israel]]i usage, it refers to all Jews from Central and West Asian countries, many of them Arabic-speaking Muslim-majority countries. The term came to be widely used more by Mizrahi activists in the early 1990s. Since then in Israel it has become an accepted semi-official and media designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shohat|first1=Ella|title=Rupture And Return: A Mizrahi Perspective On The Zionist Discourse (archives)|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040501000000*/http://web.mit.edu/cis/www/mitejmes/issues/200105/download/Shohat.doc|publisher=The MIT Electronic Journal of Middle East Studies|access-date=8 March 2015|date=May 2001}} (clicking on archived links leads to document download)&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the "Mizrahi" activists actually originated from North African Jewish communities, traditionally called "Westerners" (Maghrebi), rather than "Easterners" (Mashreqi). Many Jews originated from Arab and Muslim countries today reject "Mizrahi" (or any) umbrella description, and prefer to identify themselves by their particular country of origin, or that of their immediate ancestors, e. g., "Moroccan Jew", or prefer to use the old term "Sephardi" in its broader meaning.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Some modern Arab Muslims and Christians are probably descendants of biblical/ancient Jews who later converted to Christianity and Islam.&lt;ref name="Corcos2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alain F.

==Religious rite designations==
{{refimprove|date=July 2013}}
Today, many identify all non-Ashkenazi rite Jews as Sephardi - in modern Hebrew "Sfaradim", mixing ancestral origin and religious rite. This broader definition of "Sephardim" as including all, or most, Mizrahi Jews is also common in Jewish religious circles. During the past century, the Sephardi rite absorbed the unique rite of the [[Yemenite Jews]], and lately, [[Beta Israel]] religious leaders in Israel have also joined Sefardi rite collectivities, especially following rejection of their Jewishness by some Ashkenazi circles.
[[File:Yemenite_Elder_Blowing_Shofat,_February_1,_1949.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yemenite Jew]] blowing shofar, 1947]]
The reason for this classification of all Mizrahim under Sephardi rite is that most Mizrahi communities use much the same religious rituals as Sephardim proper due to historical reasons. The prevalence of the Sephardi rite among Mizrahim is partially a result of Sephardim proper joining some of Mizrahi communities following the 1492 [[Alhambra Decree]], which expelled Jews from Sepharad ([[History of the Jews in Spain|Spain]] and [[History of the Jews in Portugal|Portugal]]). Over the last few centuries, the previously distinctive rites of the Mizrahi communities were influenced, superimposed upon or altogether replaced by the rite of the Sephardim, perceived as more prestigious. Even before this assimilation, the original rite of many Jewish Oriental communities was already closer to the Sephardi rite than to the Ashkenazi one. For this reason, "Sephardim" has come to mean not only "Spanish Jews" proper but "Jews of the Spanish rite", just as "[[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]]" is used for "Jews of the German rite", whether or not their families originate in Germany.

Many of the Sephardi Jews exiled from Spain resettled in greater or lesser numbers in the [[Arab world]], such as [[Syria]] and [[Morocco]]. In [[Syria]], most eventually intermarried with, and assimilated into, the larger established communities of [[Musta'arabi Jews|Musta'rabim]] and Mizrahim. In some North African countries, such as Morocco, Sephardi Jews came in greater numbers, and largely contributed to the Jewish settlements that the pre-existing Jews were assimilated by them. Either way, this assimilation, combined with the use of the Sephardi rite, led to the popular designation and conflation of most non-Ashkenazi Jewish communities from the Middle East and North Africa as "Sephardi rite", whether or not they were descended from Spanish Jews, which is what the terms "Sephardi Jews" and "Sfaradim" properly implied when used in the ethnic as opposed to the religious sense.

In some Arabic countries, such as Egypt and Syria, Sephardi Jews arrived via the [[Ottoman Empire]] would distinguish themselves from the already established Musta'rabim, while in others, such as Morocco and Algeria, the two communities largely intermarried, with the latter embracing Sephardi customs and thus forming a single community.

==Language==

===Arabic===
{{Further|Judeo-Arabic languages}}

In the [[Arab world]] (such as Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria), Mizrahim most often speak [[Arabic]],&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; although Arabic is now mainly used as a second language, especially by the older generation. Most of the many notable philosophical, religious and literary works of the Jews in Spain, North Africa and Asia were written in Arabic using a modified [[Hebrew alphabet]].

===Aramaic===
[[Image:KurdJewwomenRowendez905.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kurdish Jews]] in [[Rawanduz]], northern [[Iraq]], 1905.]]
[[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] is a Semitic language subfamily. Specific varieties of Aramaic are identified as "[[Jewish languages]]" since they are the languages of major Jewish texts such as the [[Talmud]] and ''[[Zohar]]'', and many ritual recitations such as the [[Kaddish]]. Traditionally, Aramaic has been a language of Talmudic debate in [[yeshiva|yeshivot]], as many rabbinic texts are written in a mixture of Hebrew and Aramaic. The current [[ Hebrew alphabet]], known as "Assyrian lettering" or "the square script", was in fact borrowed from Aramaic.

In [[Kurdistan]], the language of the Mizrahim is a variant of Aramaic.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; As spoken by the [[Kurdish Jews]], [[Judeo-Aramaic languages]] are [[Neo-Aramaic languages]] descended from [[Jewish Babylonian Aramaic]]. They are related to the Christian Aramaic dialects spoken by [[Assyrian people]].

In 2007, a book was published, authored by [[Mordechai Zaken]], describing the unique relationship between Jews in urban and rural Kurdistan and the tribal society under whose patronage the Jews lived for hundreds of years. Tribal chieftains, or aghas, granted patronage to the Jews who needed protection in the wild tribal region of Kurdistan; the Jews gave their chieftains dues, gifts and services. The text provides numerous tales and examples about the skills, maneuvers and innovations used by Kurdistani Jews in their daily life to confront their abuse and extortion by greedy chieftains and tribesmen. The text also tells the stories of Kurdish chieftains who saved and protected the Jews unconditionally.&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Zaken, ''Jewish Subjects and Their Tribal Chieftains in Kurdistan: A Study in Survival'', Brill: Boston and Leiden, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1950s, virtually the entire Jewish community of Kurdistan — a rugged, mostly mountainous region comprising parts of Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran, and the Caucasus, where Jews had lived since antiquity — relocated to Israel. The vast majority of Kurdish Jews, who were primarily concentrated in northern Iraq, left Kurdistan in the mass [[aliyah]] of 1950-51. This ended thousands of years of Jewish history in what had been [[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]].

===Persian and other languages===
Among other languages associated with Mizrahim are [[Judeo-Iranian languages]] such as [[Judeo-Persian]], the [[Bukhori dialect]], [[Judeo-Tat]], and [[Kurdish languages]]; [[Georgian language|Georgian]]; [[Marathi language|Marathi]]; and [[Judeo-Malayalam]]. Most [[Persian Jews]] speak standard [[Persian language|Persian]], as do many other Jews from Iran, Afghanistan, and [[Bukhara]] ([[Uzbekistan]]),&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; Judeo-Tat, a form of Persian, is spoken by the [[Mountain Jews]] of Azerbaijan and Russian Dagestan, and in other Caucasian territories in Russia.

==Migration==
Some Mizrahim migrated to India, other parts of Central Asia, and China. In some Mizrahi Jewish communities (notably those of Yemen and Iran), [[polygyny]] has been practiced.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

After the establishment of the State of Israel and subsequent [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], most Mizrahim were either expelled by their Arab rulers or chose to leave and emigrated to Israel.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/mejews.html |title=Jews of the Middle East |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |access-date=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2009 Statistical Abstract of Israel, 50.2% of Israeli Jews are of Mizrahi or Sephardi origin.&lt;ref&gt;Statistical Abstract of Israel, 2009, CBS. "Table 2.24 – Jews, by country of origin and age" (PDF). Retrieved 22 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-Jewish actions by Arab governments in the 1950s and 1960s, in the context of the founding of the State of Israel, led to the departure of large numbers of Mizrahi Jews from the Middle East.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The exodus of 25,000 Mizrahi Jews from Egypt after the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]] led to the overwhelming majority of Mizrahim leaving Arab countries. They became [[Jewish refugees|refugees]]. Most went to Israel. Many Moroccan and Algerian Jews went to France. Thousands of Lebanese, Syrian and Egyptian Jews emigrated to the United States and to Brazil.

{{Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries}}

Today, as many as 40,000 Mizrahim still remain in communities scattered throughout the non-Arab [[Muslim world]], primarily in [[Iran]], but also [[Uzbekistan]], [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html The Jewish Population of the World], The Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt; There are few Maghrebim remaining in the Arab world. About 5,000 remain in [[Morocco]] and fewer than 2,000 in [[Tunisia]]. Other countries with remnants of ancient Jewish communities with official recognition, such as [[Lebanon]], have 100 or fewer Jews. A trickle of emigration continues, mainly to [[Israel]] and the [[United States]].

===Absorption into Israeli society===
{{Expand section|date=April 2008}}

Refuge in Israel was not without its tragedies: "In a generation or two, millennia of rooted Oriental civilization, unified even in its diversity", had been wiped out, writes Mizrahi scholar [[Ella Shohat]].&lt;ref&gt;Ella Shohat: "Sephardim in Israel: Zionism from the Standpoint of its Jewish Victims", Social Text, No.19/20 (1988), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The trauma of rupture from their countries of origin was further complicated by the difficulty of the transition upon arrival in Israel; Mizrahi immigrants and refugees were placed in rudimentary and hastily erected tent cities ([[Ma'abarot]]) often in development towns on the peripheries of Israel. Settlement in [[Moshav]]im (cooperative farming villages) was only partially successful, because Mizrahim had historically filled a niche as [[Artisan|craftsmen]] and [[merchant]]s and most did not traditionally engage in farmwork. As the majority left their property behind in their home countries as they journeyed to Israel, many suffered a severe decrease in their socio-economic status aggravated by their cultural and political differences with the dominant Ashkenazi community. Furthermore, a policy of [[Austerity in Israel|austerity]] was enforced at that time due to economic hardships.

Mizrahi immigrants arrived with many mother tongues:
* many, especially those from North Africa and the fertile crescent, spoke Arabic dialects;
* those from Iran spoke [[Persian language|Persian]];
* [[Mountain Jews]] from Azerbaijan arrived with Judeo-Tat;
* [[Baghdadi Jews]] from [[India]] arrived with English;
* [[Bukharan Jews]] from [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Tajikistan]] arrived with the Bukhori dialect;
* the [[Bene Israel]] from [[Maharashtra]], [[India]], arrived with Marathi.
Mizrahim from elsewhere brought Georgian, [[Judaeo-Georgian]] and various other languages with them. Hebrew had historically been a language only of prayer for most Jews not living in Israel, including the Mizrahim. Thus, with their arrival in Israel, the Mizrahim retained culture, customs and language distinct from their Ashkenazi counterparts.

====Disparities and integration====
{{see also|Racism in Israel #North African and Middle Eastern descent}}
The cultural differences between Mizrahi and Ashkenazi Jews impacted the degree and rate of assimilation into Israeli society, and sometimes the divide between Eastern European and Middle Eastern Jews was quite sharp. Segregation, especially in the area of housing, limited integration possibilities over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-2427.00255 |title=Int J Urban &amp; Regional Res, Volume 24 Issue 2 Page 418-438, June 2000 |publisher=Wiley |date=2003-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intermarriage between Ashkenazim and Mizrahim is increasingly common in Israel and by the late 1990s 28% of all Israeli children had multi-ethnic parents (up from 14% in the 1950s).&lt;ref&gt;Barbara S. Okun, Orna Khait-Marelly. 2006. Socioeconomic Status and Demographic Behavior of Adult Multiethnics: Jews in Israel.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed that intermarriage does not tend to decrease ethnic differences in socio-economic status,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/demography/v041/41.1okun.html |title=Project MUSE |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |date= |access-date=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; however that does not apply to the children of inter-ethnic marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/351810|title=Children of Ethnic Intermarriage in Israeli Schools: Are They Marginal?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although social integration is constantly improving, disparities persist. A study conducted by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics (ICBS), Mizrahi Jews are less likely to pursue academic studies than Ashkenazi Jews. Israeli-born Ashkenazim are up to twice more likely to study in a university than Israeli-born Mizrahim.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbs.gov.il/publications/educ_demog_05/pdf/t16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the percentage of Mizrahim who seek a university education remains low compared to second-generation immigrant groups of Ashkenazi origin, such as Russians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/publications/educ_demog_05/pdf/gr14.pdf |title=97_gr_.xls |format=PDF |date= |access-date=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a survey by the Adva Center, the average income of Ashkenazim was 36 percent higher than that of Mizrahim in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adva.org/ivrit/ADVA_ISRAEL_2005_HEB.pdf Hebrew PDF] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217065803/http://www.adva.org/ivrit/ADVA_ISRAEL_2005_HEB.pdf |date=December 17, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21958">In 2005 the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) distributed a "self evaluation" to its member institutions for teams to examine the use of potentially offensive imagery with their mascot choice. This examination was done in accordance with NCAA policy that requires each member institution to maintain an "atmosphere of respect for and sensitivity to the dignity of every person."&lt;ref name="Hosick.20050314"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/NCAANewsArchive/2005/Association-wide/mascot%2Bmatter%2Bfits%2Binto%2Bproper-environment%2Bdiscussion%2B-%2B3-14-05%2Bncaa%2Bnews.html|title=Mascot matter fits into proper-environment discussion|date=March 14, 2005|first=Michelle|last=Brutlag Hosick|publisher=The NCAA News|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen schools either removed all references to Native American culture or were deemed not to have references to Native American culture as part

==Changes==
Colleges previously using the nickname ''Indians'' changed:
*[[Arkansas State University]] to [[Arkansas State Red Wolves|Red Wolves]]
*[[Indiana University of Pennsylvania]] to [[IUP Crimson Hawks|Crimson Hawks]]
*[[McMurry University]] to War Hawks
*[[Midwestern State University]] to [[Midwestern State Mustangs|Mustangs]]
*[[Newberry College]] to [[Newberry Wolves|Wolves]]
*[[University of Louisiana at Monroe]] to [[Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks|Warhawks]].

[[California State University, Stanislaus]] eliminated Native American references to their [[Stanislaus State Warriors|Warrior nickname]], initially using a Warrior Hawk mascot which never caught on;&lt;ref name="Hosick.20050314" /&gt; it has been replaced by a Roman Warrior, Titus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warriorathletics.com/|title=The Official Site of Cal State Stanislaus Athletics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[College of William and Mary]] (W&amp;M) had previously changed from "Indians" to [[William &amp; Mary Tribe|The Tribe]], but was cited due to two feathers in its logo, which were removed. After a brief period of having the frog-like character [[Colonel Ebirt]] as its unofficial mascot, W&amp;M selected the [[Griffin (mascot)|Griffin]] in 2010. Both [[Alcorn State University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meacswacsports.blogspot.com/2011/04/bravehawk-chosen-as-new-mascot-at.html|date=April 25, 2011|title=Bravehawk chosen as new mascot at Alcorn State|accessdate=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bradley University]] kept the nickname Braves but changed their mascots, while the [[Chowan University]] Braves became the [[Chowan Hawks|Hawks]]. The [[Carthage College]] Redmen became the Red Men, and the [[Southeastern Oklahoma State University]] Savages changed to [[Southeastern Oklahoma State Savage Storm|Savage Storm]].

===Controversies===
[[San Diego State University]] was not cited by the NCAA in 2005 due to a decision that the Aztecs were not a Native American tribe with any living descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20050806/news_1s6mascots.html| title=NCAA puts limited ban on Indian mascots: Postseason policy doesn't hit Aztecs| author=Brent Schrotenboer| date=August 6, 2005| publisher=San Diego Union-Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[San Diego State Aztecs|Aztec Warrior]] whose performance has included human sacrifice, has drawn criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2016/jun/12/sdqt-sdsu-mascot-sacrifice/#| title=Visiting professor complains about San Diego State mascot's pregame ritual sacrifices: "That's racist murderous."| author=Walter Mencken| date=June 12, 2016| publisher=San Diego Reader}}&lt;/ref&gt; A SDSU professor of American Indian Studies states that among other problems the mascot teaches the mistaken idea that the Aztecs were a local tribe rather than living in Mexico 1,000 miles away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/education/sd-me-sdsu-mascot-20161020-story.html| title=SDSU professor revives fight to change Aztec mascot | author=Gary Warth | publisher=San Diego Union-Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in February 2017 the SDSU Native American Student Alliance (NASA) supports removal of the mascot, calling its continue use "institutional racism" in its official statement to the Committee on Diversity, Equity and Outreach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thedailyaztec.com/81677/news/native-american-student-alliance-proposes-removal-of-aztec-mascot/| title=Native American Student Alliance proposes removal of Aztec mascot| author=Allyson Myers| date=February 27, 2017| publisher=The Daily Aztec}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwEYVqMcYGJOOF8xb0FxVFFwR0NqQldPN1BzbVR0aTRyZ1Fz/view| title=NASA 2016-2017 Mascot Statement| accessdate=February 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although that resolution was rejected by the SDSU Associated Students, the University Senate, which represents the administration, faculty, staff and students, has voted to phase out the human depiction of the Aztec Warrior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://timesofsandiego.com/sports/2017/11/08/no-more-aztec-warrior-sdsu-university-senate-votes-to-retire-mascot/| title=No More Aztec Warrior?

The [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] [[Illinois Fighting Illini|Fighting Illini]] kept the nickname as referring to the state, not Native Americans, but officially stopped using the [[Chief Illiniwek]] image and mascot in 2007, although an attachment remains among many students and alumni;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news-gazette.com/news/business/entrepreneurs/2012-04-21/former-chiefs-create-new-logo.html|title=Former Chiefs create new logo|date=April 21, 2012| first=Julie|last=Wurth|newspaper=News-Gazette|accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://councilofchiefs.org/|title=The Tradition Continues|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2013-03-13/ui-student-vote-favors-chief-illiniwek.html| title=UI student vote favors Chief Illiniwek| date=March 13, 2013| author=Christine Des Garennes|newspaper=News-Gazette| accessdate=April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2013/05/07/wisch-return-of-chief-illiniwek-proposed-and-ignored/| title=Wisch: Return Of Chief Illiniwek Proposed – And Ignored?| date=May 7, 2013| author=Dave Wischnowsky| accessdate=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Illinois Students Say: It's Time To Let Chief Illiniwek Go| publisher=Urbana Champaign Independent Media Center| accessdate = 2014-10-21| url = http://www.ucimc.org/content/illinois-students-say-its-time-let-chief-illiniwek-go| author=Carol Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Honor the Chief Society" filed an application with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] in 2009 to register the Chief Illiniwek symbol, which the university opposed. In October, 2013 an agreement was reached that will allow limited private use of the name as long as accompanied by a disclaimer stating that the university is not involved in such use. A new Chief Illiniwek cannot be named, and the university retains control of the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-10-23/news/chi-u-of-i-works-out-deal-on-use-of-chief-illiniwek-20131023_1_chief-society-roger-huddleston-the-news-gazette| title=U. of I. works out deal on use of Chief Illiniwek| date=October 23, 2013| author=Jodi S.

The [[University of North Dakota]] initially challenged the NCAA policy in court, but settled in 2007 when it was given three years to obtain consent from the [[Sioux]] tribes in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ag.state.nd.us/ncaa/ncaa.htm|title=UND v.

In 2011, the State Legislature voted that the university should retain the name but in a 2012 referendum the voters decided to proceed with the change, which has been completed but no alternative nickname or logo has been selected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/ncaa/2011-03-12/und-nickname-still-point-discussion|publisher=NCAA|title=UND nickname still point of discussion|author=The Associated Press|date=March 12, 2011|accessdate=February 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/8045554/north-dakota-residents-vote-let-school-scrap-fighting-sioux-nickname|publisher=ESPN|title=UND OK to drop Fighting Sioux name|date=June 14, 2012|author=Associated Press|accessdate=February 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCAA has agreed to allow some of the logos to remain in the sports stadiums, while removing the larger and more obvious ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2012/09/26/ncaa-agreement-permits-some-und-fighting-sioux-logos-to-remain/|title=Fighting Sioux Remains|date=September 26, 2012|accessdate=October 18, 2013|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional legal cases have run their course, leaving the Fighting Sioux name and logo officially retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.mprnews.org/statewide/2013/05/is_the_fighting_sioux_nickname_battle_over/|title=Is the Fighting Sioux nickname battle over?|author=Dan Gunderson|date=May 30, 2013|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 referendum specified that there would be a cooling off period during which a new nickname would not be selected, which ended on January 1, 2015. After a year-long selection process, "Fighting Hawks" was selected as the new nickname on November 18, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/university-of-north-dakota-picks-fighting-hawks-1447873520| title=University of North Dakota Picks 'Fighting Hawks'| author=Melissa Korn| date=November 18, 2015| newspaper=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially many fans, particularly at hockey games, continued to wear "Sioux" jerseys and boo when the "Fighting Hawks" is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/03/sports/hockey/with-sioux-nickname-gone-north-dakota-hockey-fans-are-fighting-change.html?_r=0&amp;module=ArrowsNav&amp;contentCollection=Hockey&amp;action=keypress&amp;region=FixedLeft&amp;pgtype=article| title=The Sioux Nickname Is Gone, but North Dakota Hockey Fans Haven't Moved On| author=Pat Borzi| date=March 1, 2016| publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a year, however, new Fighting Hawks merchandise is being sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/fighting-hawks-merchandise-released-into-the-wild/article_eaa99d22-a32c-5465-8d8a-0c8d7e86d88b.html| title=Fighting Hawks merchandise released into the wild| author=April Baumgarten| date=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waivers granted==
The NCAA has granted waivers from their mascot policy to five university teams originally on the "hostile and abusive" list that obtained official support from individual tribes for the use of their names and images, based upon the principle of [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|Tribal Sovereignty]]. As stated by the NCAI: "In general, NCAI strongly opposes the use of derogatory Native sports mascots. However, in the case where mascots refer to a particular Native nation or nations, NCAI respects the right of individual tribal nations to work with universities and athletic programs to decide how to protect and celebrate their respective tribal heritage."&lt;ref name="NCAI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncai.org/policy-issues/community-and-culture/anti-defamation-mascots|title=Anti-Defamation and Mascots|publisher=National Congress of American Indians|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Catawba College]] Indians became the [[Catawba people|Catawba]] [[Catawba Indians|Indians]] with approval of that tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=2463164|title=NCAA says Catawba College can use Indians nickname|date=May 30, 2006|accessdate=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Central Michigan University]] ([[Central Michigan Chippewas|Chippewas]]) - The [[Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Nation]] of Michigan gave its support to the nickname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2005/09/06/mascot| title=Two More Universities Off NCAA's Mascot List|date=September 6, 2005|author=Doug Lederman|publisher=Inside Higher Ed|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Florida State University]] ([[Florida State Seminoles|Seminoles]]): The name [[Seminoles]] was selected by student vote in the 1940s, and for the first two decades the athletic teams mostly used images based on stereotypes such as in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] [[Western (genre)|Westerns]]. Leaders of the [[Seminole Tribe of Florida]] who attended a basketball game on the campus in 1972 expressed their concerns to university officials regarding the antics of such mascots as ''[[Sammy Seminole]]'' and ''[[Osceola and Renegade#Previous mascots|Chief Fullabull]]'' which were retired that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=DeSlatte |first=Aaron |url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/NatNews/message/39441 |title=FSU worked to cultivate better image of Seminole |newspaper=Florida Today |date=August 17, 2005 |accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1978 marked the first appearance of [[Osceola and Renegade]], in which a student portrays the 19th-century Seminole leader [[Osceola]], riding Renegade, an [[Appaloosa]] horse. The student, chosen for his horsemanship, wears clothing provided by the Seminole tribe but is not necessarily of Native American descent himself. The Seminole Tribe of Florida officially sanctions the use of the Seminole as Florida State University's nickname and of Osceola as FSU's symbol. Max Osceola, the chief and general council president of the Seminole Tribe of Florida, has stated that he regards it as an "honor" to be associated with the university. However, the Seminole Tribe of Florida is only one of the tribal authorities representing Seminoles. Some members of the much larger [[Seminole Nation of Oklahoma]] objected to the use of the name and imagery, leading to the NCAA originally placed FSU on the list of colleges using imagery "hostile or abusive" towards Native Americans.&lt;ref name="mess"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2005/08/08/mascot|title=The Mascot Mess|date=August 8, 2005|first=Doug|last=Lederman|newspaper=Inside Higher Ed|accessdate=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in July 2005, the Seminole Nation General Council, the legislative body for the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, voted 18-2 not to oppose the use of Native American names and mascots by college sports teams.&lt;ref name="McBee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/8940521/|title=Seminole Nation OK with use of mascot|publisher=NBC Sports|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One opponent is [[David Narcomey]] who has referred to Osceola as a "minstrel show."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Florida State's Chief Osceola disgusts member of Seminole tribe of Oklahoma |publisher=News OK| accessdate = 2015-01-02| url = http://newsok.com/florida-states-chief-osceola-disgusts-member-of-seminole-tribe-of-oklahoma/article/3604488}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between the Florida tribe and the university has been maintained to the present, with few voices in opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher=The New York Times| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/29/sports/ncaafootball/29seminoles.html?pagewanted=all|title=Bonding Over a Mascot|first=JOE|last=LAPOINTE|date=December 29, 2006|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/sports/ncaafootball/amid-rising-discord-over-indian-images-florida-state-has-harmony.html?_r=0|title=Amid Rising Discord Over Indian Images, F.S.U.

*[[Mississippi College]] ([[Mississippi College Choctaws|Choctaws]]) received the support of the [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians]] to keep their name,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diverseeducation.com/article/5547/#|title=NCAA: Mississippi College Can Keep Choctaws Nickname|date=February 23, 2006|author=Associated Press|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but retired their mascot, Chief Choc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2015/04/22/school-mascots-name/26218987/| title=School mascots: What's in a name?| author=Therese Apel| publisher=The Clarion-Ledger| date=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[University of Utah]] ([[Utah Utes|Utes]]) - For many decades, the school did not have an official Western Athletic Conference mascot.  As early as the 1950s, the University of Utah created a Ute Indian boy, named "Hoyo", as its mascot.  The University of Utah club organizations, such as the Associated Students of the University of Utah, the University of Utah Alumni Association, the Daily Chronicle, and many other social organizations highly celebrated "Hoyo" at homecoming events, before and after football games events, and at other social events for many years.&lt;ref&gt;1951 ''Utonian'', p. 153, University of Utah&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1972, teams used both "Utes" and "Redskins" as nicknames, but dropped the latter in response to tribal concerns. In 1996 [[Swoop (University of Utah)|Swoop]], a red tailed hawk, became the official mascot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://utahutes.cstv.com/trads/swoop.html|title=Mascot/Nickname History|accessdate=November 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Swoop is now the University of Utah's official mascot, Utah fans and its clubs alike still use "Utes" as their nickname at sporting events. This is done with permission from the [[Ute people|Ute]] Tribal Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=2149907|title=NCAA takes Utah off banned mascots list|date=September 3, 2005|author=Associated Press|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utahutes.com/trads/ute-trads-general.html |title=Utah Traditions |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Utah Utes |publisher=CBS Interactive |access-date=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Organized crime in Nigeria''' may refer to a number of [[Confidence trick|fraudsters]], [[Illegal drug trade|drug traffickers]] and [[Racket (crime)|racketeers]] of various sorts originating from Nigeria. Nigerian criminal gangs rose to prominence in the 1980s, owing much to the [[globalization]] of the world's economies and the high level of lawlessness already in the country.

==Structure==
[[File:Neo Black Movement aka Black Axe.JPG|thumb|left|The '''Neo Black Movement''' often claim to be entirely unrelated to Black Axe in public statements, however the symbol is shown on their posters.]]

Criminal organizations from Nigeria typically do not follow the [[mafia]]-type model followed by other groups. They appear to be less formal and more organized along familial and ethnic lines, thus making them less susceptible by infiltration from law enforcement. Police investigations are further hampered by the fact there are at least [[Languages of Nigeria|250 distinct ethnic languages]] in Nigeria. Other criminal gangs from Nigeria appear to be smaller-scale freelance operations.&lt;ref&gt;La Sorte, Mike. "[http://www.americanmafia.com/Feature_Articles_349.html Defining Organized Crime]". AmericanMafia.com, May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Groups from [[Benin City]] are especially notorious for human trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=People and Power |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/peopleandpower/2011/08/201189141348631784.html |title=The Nigerian Connection - People &amp; Power |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2014-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this are the highly organized confraternities/campus gangs that operate worldwide, for example the [[Neo Black Movement of Africa]]. In its own words, the '''Neo Black Movement of Africa''' is a "registered non-partisan, non-religious and non-tribal organisation that sincerely seek to revive, retain and modify where necessary those aspects of African culture that would provide vehicles of progress for Africa and her peoples".

The current worldwide head of the Neo Black Movement is Augustus Bemigho-Oyeoyibo. A representative of the Neo Black Movement of Africa has claimed to be separate from the Black Axe groups and has engaged in charitable giving.

Behind the welfare facade of the Neo Black Movement&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbmarena.org/ nbmarena.org]&lt;/ref&gt; hides indeed the most dreaded Nigerian [[Confraternities in Nigeria|campus cult]], the Black Axe confraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,IRBC,,NGA,,50ebf7a82,0.html|title=Refworld &amp;#124; Nigeria: The Black Axe confraternity, also known as the Neo-Black Movement of Africa, including their rituals, oaths of secrecy, and use of symbols or particular signs; whether they use force to recruit individuals (2009-November 2012)|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Unhcr.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226171109/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2CIRBC%2C%2CNGA%2C%2C50ebf7a82%2C0.html|archive-date=2014-02-26|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2014-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBM usually state that they are not identical with Black Axe for propaganda purposes. While the [[Obafemi Awolowo University massacre|atrocities committed by campus cult members]] are well-known, very little is known about other activities of the Neo Black Movement. Offiong claims that the group's initial goal of promoting black consciousness and fighting for the dignity of Africans and their freedom from neo-colonialism has deteriorated into self-serving behaviour that is "notoriously and brutally violent".&lt;ref&gt;Offiong 2003, 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; He maintains that violence has in fact become the cult's official policy.&lt;ref&gt;Offiong 2003, 70&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the atrocities in the orbit of NBM, most members of the confraternity are involved in fraud and cyber crime. The main reason to join the confraternity is (besides the pressure and intimidation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/T%20&amp;%20T/T%20&amp;%20T-07-0-000-09-Web/T%20&amp;%20T-07-1-000-09-Abst-PDF/T&amp;T-07-1-017-09-175-Egbochuku-E-O/T&amp;T-07-1-017-09-175-Egbochuku-E-O-Tt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that is applied to students to join) the fact that the confraternity has infiltrated all spheres of Nigerian society and serves the main purpose of helping its members climb the career ladder and going unpunished for their crimes by means of their nepotistic structure.

Investigations and a number of arrests of members of NBM by the Italian police brought to light various crimes committed by members of NBM. NBM and other cults were found guilty of smuggling of drugs, extortion, 419 fraud, prostitution, passport falsification, and cloning of credit cards.

In 2011, eight more members of NBM were arrested in Italy for the same offenses mentioned above. They are referred to as an international criminal organisation and Nigerian Mafia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.articolotre.com/2011/09/arresti-in-campania-per-black-axe-la-mafia-nigeriana/37211 Arresti in Campania per Black Axe, la mafia nigeriana]&lt;/ref&gt; According to internal documents, the confraternity helps members to immigrate illegally to Europe. Nigerian fraud rings have been exported to Europe, America, and Asia (see external links section). In 2015 a sophisticated car theft ring run by the Black Axe organized crime ring was busted in Toronto, Canada. The ring had stolen more than 500 luxury cars in one year, valued at 30 million US dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/black-axe-car-thefts-1.3360872 | title=GTA luxury vehicle thefts linked to Nigerian crime ring Black Axe | publisher=CBC News Toronto | date=11 December 2015 | accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/sophisticated-car-theft-ring-targeting-luxury-vehicles/article28233541/ | title=GTA Sophisticated car theft ring targeting luxury vehicles | work=The Globe and Mail | date=17 January 2016 | accessdate=18 January 2016 | author=Ross, Selena}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

===Drug trafficking===

Nigerian criminal groups are heavily involved in drug trafficking, shipping [[heroin]] from [[Asia]]n countries to [[Europe]] and [[Americas|America]]; and [[cocaine]] from [[South America]] to Europe and [[South Africa]]. The large numbers of ethnic Nigerians in countries like India and [[Thailand]] give their gangs ready access to around 90% of the world's [[heroin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]. "[https://www.fbi.gov/hq/cid/orgcrime/africancrim.htm Organized Crime: African Criminal Enterprises]".&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, Nigerian drug traffickers are important distributors of heroin, from importing it into the country to distribution level and selling it to lower-level street gangs.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.usdoj.gov/ndic/pubs31/31379/heroin.htm National Drug Threat Assessment 2009 - Heroin]". [[National Drug Intelligence Center]], December 208. Accessed 1 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; These criminal groups are also known to launder drug money through domestic football clubs in the [[Nigeria Premier League]], and are rumored to make additional money through [[match fixing]] activity within football matches.

==Impact==
According to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], Nigerian criminal enterprises are the most notable of all African criminal enterprises. They are considered to be among the most aggressive and expansionist international criminal groups, operating in more than 80 countries of the world and are established on all populated continents of the world. Their most profitable activity is drug trafficking, though they are more famous for their financial fraud which costs the US alone approximately US$1 to 2 billion annually.&lt;ref name=FBI&gt;{{cite web|title=African Criminal Enterprises|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/organizedcrime/african|website=FBI|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Portuguese immigration to Hawaii''' began in 1878 when [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] residents made up less than 1% of the Island population. However, the migration that began that year of laborers from [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]] to work in the [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]]s rapidly increased the Portuguese presence in Hawaii, and by the end of 1911 nearly 16,000 Portuguese immigrants had arrived.

==Early immigration==
[[File:Madeira, Apanha de canas - B.P. n.º 155 (7).jpg|thumb|Madeira Islanders cutting sugarcane. About 6,000 of them by 1913 came to Hawaii to do the same work.]]
The Hawaiian census of 1878 showed that, out of a [[Monarchy|kingdom]] of 57,985 people, only 438 residents, which was less than 0.8% of the population, were Portuguese.&lt;ref name="thrum1903" /&gt; Most of these Portuguese residents had been born in either the [[Azores]] or [[Madeira Islands]], and nearly all had arrived as sailors on [[whaling ships]]. Although only a few brought their wives or were joined by them later, women made up only about one-eighth of this tiny immigrant community.&lt;ref name="rodgers1891" /&gt; Despite the fact that prior to 1878 so few Portuguese had made their way to the Hawaiian Islands, those that did found opportunity and tended to stay.&lt;ref name="marques1886" /&gt;

Conditions in Hawaii in 1878 were conducive to immigration. [[King Kalākaua]], who had recently ascended the Hawaiian throne, encouraged closer ties with [[Europe]], and a growing Hawaiian economy, due largely to increased [[sugar]] exports to [[California]], created a demand for laborers to work the sugarcane plantations.&lt;ref name="marques1886" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kuykendall1967" /&gt; Because the [[native Hawaiian]] workers had been decimated by disease, there were not enough laborers to supply the sugarcane plantations, which led in 1852 to the first importation of [[China|Chinese]] workers. So many Chinese were brought in that by 1878 they made up nearly 10% of the population.&lt;ref name="thrum1903" /&gt;&lt;ref name="coman1903" /&gt; Although the Chinese worked hard, they were accused of gambling, prostitution and opium use, and a search began for alternate sources of labor. This led both the Hawaiian government and the plantation owners to offer incentives, and concessions not given the Chinese nor other [[Asian people|Asian]] [[ethnic group]]s, to attract immigrants of European descent who were willing to work in the cane fields.&lt;ref name="coman1903_chinese" /&gt;

==Immigration of 1878 to 1911==
Jason Perry (Jacinto Pereira), a Portuguese settler who served as the Portuguese Consul to Hawaii, suggested in 1876 to plantation owners of the Planters' Society (a predecessor of the [[Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association]]) that the [[Madeira]] and [[Azores]] Islands of [[Portugal]] might be ideal sources of reliable workers.&lt;ref name="marques1886" /&gt; Portuguese colonists had first settled these islands in the Middle Ages, and the terrain and [[subtropical]] climate were very similar to that of the Hawaiian Islands. More important though, sugarcane had been the mainstay of the economy in Madeira and the Azores for over 400 years, and most of the population was involved in one way or another in the sugarcane industry.&lt;ref name="coman1903" /&gt;

[[File:Leonard's malasadas.jpg|thumb|[[Malasadas]] are a popular Hawaiian pastry first made in the Madeira islands.]]
[[File:John Philip Sousa and the Hawaiian Band, 1901.jpg|thumb|[[John Philip Sousa]] with Portuguese ukulele players of the Hawaiian Band, 1901]]

Intrigued by Perry's suggestion, the Planters' Society began recruiting Portuguese contract workers, first in 1878 from the Madeira Islands, and then two years later from the Azores as well. Several ships between 1878 and 1887 brought to Hawaii more than 3,300 Portuguese men from these islands, but because many of the men brought their wives, children, and other relations as well, there was an actual immigration during these years of about 10,700 Portuguese.&lt;ref name="marques1886" /&gt; Whereas contracts for the Chinese workers that preceded them generally stipulated single men only, the Portuguese were allowed to bring their families, an incentive that the plantation owners hoped would provide stability.&lt;ref name="coman1903" /&gt; Prior to independence in 1975, many [[Africans in Hawaii|Cape Verdeans emigrated to Hawaii]] from drought-stricken [[Portuguese Cape Verde]], formerly an [[overseas province]] of Portugal. Because these people arrived using their Portuguese passports, they were registered as [[Portuguese diaspora|Portuguese immigrants]] by the Hawaiian (and later, the American) authorities.

Portuguese immigration to the islands slowed after 1887, which was the same year that [[King Kalākaua]] was stripped of power, and about the same time that importation of other ethnic groups increased. Nonetheless, Portuguese immigration continued, and by the end of 1911 almost 16,000 Portuguese had arrived. Unfortunately, the more affluent members of Hawaiian society tended to view these newcomers as inferior or "low class", and growing resentment at being treated as "second-class citizens", resulted in many Portuguese later emigrating to the mainland United States, particularly California, in search of equality and opportunity.&lt;ref name="coman1903" /&gt;&lt;ref name="marques1910" /&gt; Though many left, many stayed and by 1910 Portuguese residents made up 11.6% of the population of Hawaii.&lt;ref name="1910census" /&gt;

==Immigrant culture and traditions==

Native Hawaiian speakers called the Portuguese immigrants who came to their country "Pukikī." These newcomers were devout followers of the Roman Catholic faith with strong family ties. Most were short, with slender builds, and dark skin from long hours of working out under the sun in the cane fields.&lt;ref name="pap1981" /&gt; Many in fact were so dark that their race on some of the early U.S. census returns is listed as black, which contributed to prejudice against them.&lt;ref name="census1910" /&gt; Because few of these immigrants could read or write, they had strong oral traditions, and they retained much of the culture and traditions they brought with them.&lt;ref name="pap1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="takaki1983" /&gt;

One popular Portuguese tradition in Hawaii today is the making of [[malasadas]], which are deep-fried pastries, similar to the [[beignet]] of [[New Orleans]], that traditionally have no holes or fillings, but are coated in granulated cane sugar. They were first made by Hawaiian residents from the Madeira and Azores Islands, who would use up butter and sugar prior to [[Lent]] by cooking malasadas. These pastries are an important part in Madeira and the Azores of the "Terça-feira Gorda", a festival also known as the Carnaval that is the same holiday as "[[Fat Tuesday]]" or "[[Mardi Gras]]" elsewhere. This day in Hawaii is called "Malasada Day", and it dates back to the time of the 19th-century sugarcane plantations.&lt;ref name="wiki-malasadas" /&gt;

Another popular Portuguese tradition in Hawaii is the Holy Spirit Festival (Festa do Espírito Santo), which since 1901 is celebrated each May with a parade and feast. This three-day event is not an official church holiday, but a traditional observance that began in the 18th century with the [[Cult of the Holy Spirit]] in the Azores. It usually starts on a Friday night, followed on Saturday by decorating religious statues for the festivities to follow. Then on Sunday a young woman is chosen as [[Elizabeth_of_Aragon|Queen Isabel]]  the 6th queen of Portugal, and she and her court lead a colorful parade. The final event is a mass with a "Blessing of the meat and bread" by a priest, after which Isabel is crowned as the Holy Ghost Queen. A feast is then held in "a tradition of charity and feeding the poor," where food is served to all present. The foods of this feast typically include [[malasadas]] (pastries), paodoce (sweet bread), bean soup, Portuguese sausages, and bowls of beef and fish marinated in wine.&lt;ref name="holyghost_star" /&gt;&lt;ref name="holyghost_web" /&gt;

The best-known Portuguese contribution to Hawaiian culture is the [[ukulele]], based on the traditional Portuguese braguinha ([[cavaquinho]]). The introduction of the ukulele is generally credited to Madeiran cabinet makers Manuel Nunes, Augusto Dias and José do Espírito Santo, who came to the Islands in 1879 on the British [[clipper]] SS ''[[SS Ravenscrag|Ravenscrag]]''.&lt;ref name="king2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="king2007" /&gt; The Hawaiian Gazette in late August 1879, two weeks after the arrival of the ''Ravenscrag'', reported that "Madeira Islanders recently arrived here have been delighting the people with nightly street concerts." The article then mentions "their strange instruments, which are a kind of cross between a guitar and banjo."&lt;ref name="hawaii_gazette1879b" /&gt;

[[File:British Bark Suffolk.jpg|thumb|The British ship ''Suffolk'' in 1881 brought 488 Azores Islanders to Hawaii.]]
[[File:StateLibQld 1 48976 Earl Dalhousie (ship).jpg|thumb|Six months after the arrival of the ''Suffolk'' the ''Earl Dalhousie'' brought 322 more immigrants from the Azores to Hawaii.]]

==How they came to Hawaii==

At least 24 different ships from 1878 to 1911 brought almost 16,000 Portuguese immigrants to Hawaii. Although mainly from Madeira and the Azores, there were also contingents from the eastern [[United States]], mainland Portugal, and from the Portuguese community of [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref name="ships_list" /&gt; Although conditions on board these ships from 1882 on improved dramatically, as most immigrants by then came by steamship, the first arrivals to Hawaii from Madeira and the Azores spent up to three months at sea in cramped quarters on sailing ships. Strong currents crossing the Atlantic, and rough seas when coming around Cape Horn at the tip of South America made for a perilous voyage.&lt;ref name="cabral_gomes-camacho" /&gt; When the SS ''Ravenscrag'' reached port with its load of immigrants in 1879 after 123 days at sea, three children had perished during the voyage.&lt;ref name="pacific_commercial_advertiser1879" /&gt; Even three years later when the first group of immigrants to reach Hawaii by steamship arrived in 1882 on the SS ''Monarch'' after 57 days at sea, 13 children had died on the voyage.&lt;ref name="planters_monthly" /&gt;

'''Sherut Leumi''' ({{lang-he|שירות לאומי}}, lit. ''National Service'') is an alternative voluntary [[national service]] in [[Israel]] for those that cannot or do not wish to serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. The majority who receive an exemption from the obligatory army service are [[Jew]]ish women from the [[Religious Zionism|Religious Zionist]] sector, and they receive it by declaring religious observance, as they maintain that a large number of religious observances for women cannot be upheld in the military, such as dress codes and modesty issues. However, there are also a small number of men who serve in Sherut Leumi. Volunteers are between the ages of 18 and 21. Sherut Leumi gives young women (and occasionally young men) exposure to a number of environments in Israeli society. Service typically requires working 30–40 hours/week over 12 to 24 months. Volunteers have the option of doing either one or two years of the National Service. Not all volunteers are Israeli citizens. It can be done on a tourist visa, and the volunteer will later receive a special volunteer visa that lasts as long as the person will be doing their service.

Young people in other sectors of Israeli society receive exemptions from the military. These include mainly [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] men who maintain that [[Torah study]] is the main practice for defending [[Israel]]; they are exempted under the [[Torato Omanuto]] arrangements. [[Arab citizens of Israel]] are also exempted, in order to avoid a conflict between allegiance to their country and to their Arab brothers (a decision originally taken by Israel's first Prime Minister, [[David Ben-Gurion]]). Historically, very few did, but in recent years, the number of Arab youths volunteering for national service has increased{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. Some Israeli [[Refusal to serve in the Israeli military|conscientious objectors]] who object to serving in the army, but are not eligible for an exemption, have voiced a wish to do an alternative form of national service instead.

In 2012, after much discussion and debate, Israel's cabinet extended military service exemption for 1,300 Haredi Yeshiva students as part of the "Shirut Le'umi Mishmar". This allows Yeshiva students to join national service, as opposed to joining the IDF. As part of the scheme, the defense minister is obliged to postpone the military service of Yeshiva students approved for national civil service, and who are at least 26 years old, or are at least 22 years old and have at least one child.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/israel-extends-idf-service-exemption-for-ultra-orthodox-men-1.483665&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
Youths work in various programs. The majority work in schools, but can also work in places such as special education, administration, hospitals, law, geriatrics, nursing homes, health clinics, teens at risk, internal security, disadvantaged communities, immigrant assistance, and many other organizations. Acceptance is based on an interview via a placement organizations that try to find the youth appropriate skills, interests, and needs.

==Placement organizations==
There are four main placement organizations for Sherut Leumi. They are the Agudah LeHitnadvut (''lit.'' Volunteering Union), Shlomit, [[Aminadav (non-profit organization)|Aminadav]], and Bat Ami. Each volunteer is then assigned to a coordinator (''rakezet''), who serves as a supervisor and adviser for the youth throughout their time in Sherut Leumi.

==Benefits==
Bnot Sherut (lit., female youth in the service) and Bnei Sherut (lit., male youth in the service) are entitled to a number of benefits during their service. Many of these benefits are the same as what a soldier serving in the army receives. They include:
* Monthly stipend for necessities. Amount varies with location and type of service, though usually is approximately 600 Shekels a month.
* Apartment housing in the city where they are serving.
* Refunds on intra-city bus passes (and a stamp that grants free rides on inter-city bus lines if necessary)
* Discounts offered by various business establishments.
* Social Programs such as weekend getaways, tours, learning programs, and parties.
* Weekly classes are often available, and sometimes required, on various [[Judaism]]-related subjects.
* At the end of the service, the Israeli volunteers receive a grant that can be used for things such education, buying a house, or paying for a wedding.
* Foreign volunteers receive private medical insurance.
* Free train rides (Since 2001)

==Israeli Arabs in National Service==
Rather than volunteer for army service, young people who are [[Arab citizens of Israel]] have the option to volunteer for this alternative national service and receive benefits similar to those received by discharged soldiers. The volunteers are generally allocated to Arab populations, where they assist with social and community matters. {{asof|2010}} there were 1,473 Arabs volunteering for national service. According to sources in the national service administration, Arab leaders are counseling youths to refrain from performing services to the Israeli state. According to a National Service official, "For years the Arab leadership has demanded, justifiably, benefits for Arab youths similar to those received by discharged soldiers. Now, when this opportunity is available, it is precisely these leaders who reject the state's call to come and do the service, and receive these benefits".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3974580,00.html Rise in Arab National Service volunteers], by Aviel Magnezi. YNet, 10.25.10, 14:47&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Surinamese people in the Netherlands''' are people in the [[Netherlands]] who come from a [[Surinamese people|Surinamese]] background. Until 1975, [[Suriname]] belonged to the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. 

Migration began during the colonial era. Initially this was mainly the colonial elite but expanded during the 1920s and 1930s to the less fortunate inhabitants looking for better education, employment, or other opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Gert Oostindie en Emy Maduro, ''In het land van de overheerser - II - Antillianen en Surinamers in Nederland 1634/1667-1954 (KITLV; Leiden 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 350,000 individuals of Surinamese descent now live in the Netherlands, with mass migration beginning in the years leading up to Suriname's independence in 1975, and continuing in the period immediately after independence and during military rule in the 1980s. Surinamese continued to migrate to the Netherlands throughout the 1990s because of the then tough economic situation in Suriname. Most Surinamese people in the Netherlands have a [[Dutch passport]] and the majority of whom have been successfully integrated into Dutch society.

Six percent of [[Dutch people]] of [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese descent]] can trace their ancestry through [[Suriname]]. Most of them are [[Hakka people]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7218">[[Image:Szekelys-in-hungary.png|thumb|300px|Migrations of the Székelys]]
The '''Székelys of Bukovina''' are a small [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[ethnic group|ethnic community]] with a complex history. They live today in the [[Tolna County|Tolna]] and [[Baranya (county)|Baranya]] counties of Hungary, in [[Hunedoara County]]&lt;ref&gt;Károly Kocsis, Eszter Kocsisné Hodosi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-zZ_NVM9mNEC Ethnic Geography of the Hungarian Minorities in the Carpathian Basin], Simon Publications LLC, 1 Apr 2001, p 133&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Romania]] and in the [[Serbia]]n province of [[Vojvodina]].

==Origins==

Some [[Székelys|Székely]] groups migrated from Transylvania to the province of [[Bukovina]] in the second half of the 18th century and established new villages, where they retained their distinctive culture and folk traditions into the 20th century. The migration was a reaction to the organization by the [[Habsburg Empire]] of the Székely Frontier Zone, which jeopardized certain of the Székelys' ancient privileges and rights. The Székelys protested specifically against the forced military [[conscription]] at a gathering at Madéfalva (today [[Siculeni]]), which was forcibly dispersed by the Austrian General Josef Siskovics on 7 January 1764, in what came to be known as the ''[[Siculicidium]]'' or Massacre of the Székelys. More than 400 Székelys died. Thereafter about 1000 Székelys migrated to Bukovina, then part of [[Moldavia]] and still under the [[suzerainty]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].
 [[Image:Bukovinai_szekelyek.png|thumb|300px|Székely villages in Bukovina]]
The occupation of northern Bukovina by Austria in 1774 brought a further wave of Székely immigration: another 100 families settled in the still sparsely populated territory in 1776, followed by a further 200 in 1784 and 1786, with assistance from Emperor [[Joseph II of Austria]] and Count [[András Hadik]], [[governor of Transylvania]]. The new Bukovina Székely villages were named Istensegíts ("God help us", now [[Ţibeni]]), Fogadjisten ("God, welcome us!", now {{ill|Iacobești, Suceava|lt=Iacobeşti|ro}}), Józseffalva (now [[Vornicenii Mari]]), Hadikfalva (now [[Dornești]]) and Andrásfalva (now [[Măneuţi]]).

===Cultural tradition===
The Székelys of Bukovina maintained an archaic Hungarian folklore because of their isolation.&lt;ref&gt;Zsuzsanna Palkó, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cnyzNWvVVIIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Hungarian+Folktales:+The+Art+of+Zsuzsanna+Palk%C3%B3&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kZ2oUfDOJYzbiwL52YDAAQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA Hungarian Folktales: The Art of Zsuzsanna Palkó], Univ. Press of Mississippi, 1995, p 13&lt;/ref&gt;
===Language===
{{Main|Hungarian dialects}}

==Overpopulation==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
The population of the Bukovina Székelys tripled in the 19th century, reaching 9887 in 1880 and about 16000 by the end of the 1930s. This caused an acute shortage of farmland and a sharp fall in [[standard of living|standards of living]]. Many Bukovina Székelys left the villages temporarily or permanently, some with official assistance. The Hungarian government settled 4000 of these impoverished Székelys along the [[Lower Danube]] in the new villages of [[Vojlovica, Pančevo|Hertelendyfalva]], [[Ivanovo (Serbia)|Sándoregyháza]] and [[Skorenovac|Székelykeve]] in 1883, in a part of the [[Banat]] that was annexed by [[Yugoslavia]] in 1918 and today belongs to [[Serbia]]. Other Székely families emigrated in that period to [[Canada]], USA, [[Brazil]] or cities in southern Transylvania.

==Resettlements==
Bukovina became part of [[Romania]] under the 1920 [[Treaty of Trianon]], and the impoverished Székelys soon found themselves oppressed culturally as well as economically, with no teaching in or of Hungarian in their schools. There was a general expectation of assistance from the "mother country" and increasing urgency after the [[Second Vienna Award]] of 1940 had caused widespread anti-Hungarian feeling in Bukovina. Hungary's 1941 invasion of [[Bačka]] (Bácska) in northwestern [[Vojvodina]] was followed quickly by the expulsion of postwar Serbian settlers and other measures of forced [[Magyarization]], including resettlement of the Bukovina Székelys to the region. The whole community of 13,200 people left Romania under a [[treaty]] concluded between Hungary and Romania, by which the Bukovina Székelys lost their Romanian citizenship and almost all their possessions, receiving the confiscated possessions of displaced Serbs in Bačka and some charitable assistance in exchange. They were not resettled in their original village communities as they had expected, but spread about in small groups among 14 villages and hamlets. (Those from Andrásfalva, for example, belonged to the [[Reformed Church in Hungary|Reformed Church]], while the others were Roman Catholics.)

The resettlement was short-lived. The tide of war turned and Hungary hurriedly evacuated Bačka on 8 October 1944. Most of the Bukovina Székelys managed to flee to [[Transdanubia]] before the vengeful Yugoslav partisan forces arrived, but again, they lost all of their property. Most were resettled in 1945-46 in the homes of expelled [[ethnic Germans|German]] in villages in the Völgység district of [[Tolna county|Tolna]] and adjacent counties.&lt;ref&gt;Nórbert Pap, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sRnsKeF2wGwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Tolna+-+a+rural+area+in+central-Europe:+regional+and+local+development+in+Tolna+country,+Hungary&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9ZqoUY-yA4LJigLYiIHAAg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA Tolna – a rural area in central-Europe: regional and local development in Tolna country, Hungary], 2007, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions between them and the residual German population have eased over the decades. The Székelys of Tolna remain proud of their history and folk customs.

The '''Tan-Tan Moussem''' is an annual gathering of more than thirty tribes from southern [[Morocco]] and other parts of [[Northwest Africa]] in [[Tan-Tan]], a town in south-western Morocco.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/moussem-of-tan-tan-00168|title=Moussem of Tan-Tan - intangible heritage - Culture Sector - UNESCO|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional [[Berbers|Berber]] culture, a ''moussem'' is "a type of annual fair with economic, cultural and social functions."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{About|the territories of the Awori people|further information on the tribe|Awori tribe}}

The '''Territories of the Awori''' are a part of Nigeria inhabited by the [[Awori tribe]] sub-ethnic group of the [[Yoruba people]], speaking a distinct dialect of the [[Yoruba language]]. Traditionally, Awori are found in two Nigerian States: [[Ogun (state)|Ogun]] and [[Lagos State|Lagos]].
The Awori people migrated from [[Ile Ife]] and occupied the present day Lagos state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pulse.ng/lifestyle/food-travel-arts-culture/awori-peoples-origin-belief-and-brief-history-id7161724.html |title=A brief history and belief of the original indigenes of Lagos |last=Oreva |first=Duke |date=September 6, 2017 |website=Pulse |access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-colonial creation of States and local governments influenced the splitting of the homogenous people into the present Ogun and Lagos States in South-western Nigeria. Awori towns in Ogun State are Otta, Igbesa, Ilobi and Tigbo.

The traditional territory of the Awori extends from latitude 60 30’ N from the extreme east and a landmass along the coast is over 350,000 hectares (3,500 km2) with less than twenty percent made up of lagoons, creeks and coastal estuaries.

==Territories with significant inhabitants==
The Awori could be grouped into two major divisions. These are the early Awori and the latter Awori groups. Among the early Awori group of settlement are Isheri, Otto-Olofin, Iddo, Ebute Metta, Apa, Ibereko as well as Otta and Ado-Odo in Ogun state of Nigeria. A common feature of these settlements is that they were founded before 1500. They also have a related migratory history and recognise Ogunfunminire as their progenitor. The later settlement include Ojo, Itire, Mushin, Iba, Otto-Awori, [[Ijanikin]], [[Ilogbo Elegba]], Ilogbo-Eremi, Iworo, Agbara, [[Ilashe]] etc. all of which are post 1500 settlements.

The Awori whose ancestral home is Isheri-Olofin were in Lagos before the Benin invasion as propounded by the Olofin Adimula of Orile Isheri and supported by other Awori groups such as Apa, Ilogbo-Eremi, Ibereko, Oto, Ota, Ado-Odo and Igbesa. Post-independence political creation of States however saw the dispersal of the homogenous clan scattered around the present Ogun and Lagos State.
===Lagos State===
Awori is generally considered to be the earliest dominant tribe in Lagos, even though the throne for the Oba of Lagos had its origin from Benin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.punchng.com/awori-own-lagos-land-bini-produce-oba-prof-smith/ |title=Awori own Lagos land, Bini produce Oba – Prof. Smith |last=Akinloye |first=Bayo |website=Punch |access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://esther.ng/first-settlers-lagos-awori-people-anibaba-ex-ican-president/ |title=The very first settlers in Lagos were the Awori people –Anibaba, ex-ICAN president |access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.punchng.com/awori-were-the-very-first-people-who-settled-in-lagos-anibaba-ex-ican-president/ |title=The very first settlers in Lagos were the Awori people –Anibaba, ex-ICAN president |website=Punch}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In an interview with ''[[The Punch]]'', Nigerian lawyer and elder statesman, [[Lateef Olufemi Okunnu]] described the [[Awori tribe|Aworis]] as being the original inhabitants of [[Lagos State]]. He noted that they settled in Lagos about half a century ago, long before the Bini invasion of Lagos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.punchng.com/awori-are-the-original-inhabitants-owners-of-lagos-okunnu/ |title=ICYMI: Awori are the original inhabitants, owners of Lagos — Okunnu |date=November 20, 2017 |website=Punch |access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sola Ebiseni, a former commissioner for environment in [[Ondo State]] and Awori-born legal practitioner in a publication for [[Vanguard (Nigeria)|Vanguard]], emphasized that early Awori territories in Lagos was governed through the Idejo chiefs, who had policies that ensured possession and increase of their land. He historically cited Awori as the second most populous indigenous tribe in Lagos, only surpassed by [[Ilaje]] people. Significant populations were described to have settled in Apapa, Ajegunle, Makoko, Iwaya, Bariga, Oko Baba, Oto, Ebute-Metta, Oyingbo, Ijora, Igbo Elejo, Ojo, Aloro Island (off the coast of Kirikiri) Ajah, Badore, Iton Agan, Oworonsoki, Agboyi, Bayeku etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/06/history-lagos-aboriginal-tribes/ |title=The history of Lagos and the aboriginal tribes  |last=Ebiseni |first=Sola |date=June 4, 2017 |website=Vanguard |access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[Erelu Kuti]] of Lagos, Abiola Dosunmu controversially refuted claims that the Awori's were the original "owners" of Lagos. She described Lagos as firstly being an "extension of the Benin kingdom". She also stated that after the emigration of the [[Awori tribe]] from Ife, they were initially paying royalties to the Oba of Benin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/12/benin-people-owned-lagos-aworis-paid-royalties-erelu-abiola-dosunmu/ |title=Benin people ‘owned’ Lagos, Aworis paid royalties to them —Erelu Abiola Dosunmu  |last=Kumolu |first=Charles |date=December 10, 2017 |website=Vanguard |access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her position was also corroborated by [[Oba of Lagos]], who earlier espoused the significance of Bini in the creation of Lagos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/ssouth-west/252183-i-never-said-benin-owned-lagos-oba-akiolu.html |title=I never said Benin owned Lagos – Oba Akiolu |last=Olawoyin |first=Oladeinde  |date=December 11, 2017 |website=[[Premium Times]] |access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://dailypost.ng/2017/05/03/lagos-not-belong-yorubas-oba-akiolu/ |title=Why Lagos does not belong to Yorubas – Oba Akiolu |last=Opejobi |first=Seun |date=May 3, 2017 |website=Dailypost |access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Awori constitute the bulk of the indigenous population of sixteen, out of the twenty local government areas of Lagos State as at the year 2003, the only exceptions being Epe, Ikorodu and IbejuLekki with minimal Awori inhabitants. In these areas, they have developed many kingdoms and chiefdoms. Speaking against a proposed Lagoon State, Awori Welfare Association of Nigeria (AWAN) advocated for more local governments for Aworiland, instead of creation of more states as marginalization of minorities will come to play if done. They also identified the insensitivity of the actors due to lack of consultation as a reason for their refusal. [[Apapa]], [[Iganmu]], [[Somolu]], [[Bariga]], [[Akoka]], Eti-Okun, Iwerekun, [[Kosofe]], Agboyi, [[Ketu, Nigeria|Ketu]], [[Obalende]]/[[lkoyi]], Iru/[[Victoria Island, Lagos|Victoria Island]], [[Eti-Osa]] East, Eti-Osa West, Eti-Osa Central, Etikun, Ibeshe and Majidun towns were described as Aworiland in the proposed state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/07/awori-people-back-out-of-proposed-lagoon-state/ |title=Awori people back out of proposed Lagoon state   |last=Ojiego |first=Nnamdi |access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ogun State===
The Awori people in [[Ogun State]] are located in Ogun West senatorial district, a portion that represents 37 percent of the entire area and 31% of the population in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2016/07/20/ogun-2019-in-search-of-a-yewaawori-candidate/ |title=Ogun 2019: In Search of a Yewa/Awori Candidate  |date=July 20, 2016 |website=ThisDay |access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.punchng.com/give-awori-ogun-gov-seat/ |title=Give Awori Ogun gov seat |website=Punch |access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tunjur''', or '''Tungur''', are a Sunni Muslim ethnic group found in eastern [[Chad]] and western [[Sudan]].&lt;ref name="Appiah2005p241"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Appiah|author2=Henry Louis Gates, Jr.|title=Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMZMAgAAQBAJ|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517055-9|pages=241–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethnic roots of the Tunjur people are unknown.&lt;ref name="Appiah2005p241"/&gt; According to their [[oral tradition]]s and some scholars, they are Arabs who migrated from the Arabian peninsula to Central Sudan either by way of North Africa and [[Tunis]] or by way of [[Nubia]]. In fact, as [[Nachtigal]] observed they resemble in features and behaviour the Arabs.&lt;ref&gt; Nachtigal/Fisher, ''Sahara'', II, 257/ III, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars suggest that they have non-Muslim Nilotic roots, that is from the River Nile region.&lt;ref name="Appiah2005p241"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Minahan2002p1130"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Minahan|title=Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: L-R |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9Lq_8Ozf5cC |year=2002|publisher=Greenwood |isbn=978-0-313-32111-5|pages=1130–1131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were a minority, but became the ruling class of Darfur and [[Ouaddai Empire|Wadai]] in the 13th century by peacefully taking over power from the [[Daju people|Daju]].&lt;ref name="Appiah2005p241"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. D. Fage|author2=Roland Oliver|title=The Cambridge History of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GWjxR61xAe0C&amp;pg=PA303|year=1975|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-20981-6|pages=303–304}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 16th century, they were overthrown by an Arab group that founded the [[Keira dynasty]], and later merged with the [[Fur people]]. According to the local legends of the Fur people, Shau Dorshid, the last ruler of the Tunjur, was “driven out by his own people because he compelled his subjects to dig wells in the high rocky regions and to undertake the ardeous and useless task of levelling the Mail mountain peak, on the summit of which he wanted to establish his residence" &lt;ref&gt; Nachtigal/Fisher, ''Sahara'', III, 361/IV, 276.&lt;/ref&gt; His capital is said to have been the site of [[Ain Farah]].{{cn|date=November 2016}}

About the middle of the 17th century, the Tunjur people were expelled from the Islamic Wadai empire by Abd-el-Kerim of the Maba people, and the Mabas controlled the slave supply caravans to the north.&lt;ref name="Appiah2005p241"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Minahan2002p1130"/&gt; The Tunjur people then migrated west into their current location. Thereafter, they converted to Maliki [[fiqh]] of Sunni Islam.&lt;ref name="Appiah2005p241"/&gt;

==Society==
They are farmers and live closely associated with the [[Fur people|Fur]]. Their own Tunjur language is now extinct, and they now speak [[Arabic]], Fur or Beri language as their first language.&lt;ref name="Appiah2005p241"/&gt;

==Contemporary issues==
Like the Fur and the [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]], since the start of the [[Darfur conflict]] in February 2003, many Tunjur have been affected. A number of Tunjur have taken part in the fight against the Sudanese government, under the banners of the [[Sudan Liberation Movement]] (SLM). They are estimated around 176,000 people.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

==History==

===19th century===
University Circle was known during the early 19th century as Doan’s Corners, after Nathanial Doan, a member of the [[Connecticut Land Company]], who settled his family and started a community here.&lt;ref&gt;http://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=UC&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "University Circle" began to take shape in the 1880s. Western Reserve University moved its campus from [[Hudson, Ohio]], to [[Euclid Avenue (Cleveland, Ohio)|Euclid Avenue]] in 1883. [[Case School of Applied Science]] moved from [[Downtown Cleveland]] to a site next to WRU in 1885.  Their relocation led to the birth of an educational center and the creation of a new community called University Circle, named in part after these new institutions—but also the circular street intersection and trolley turnaround located at [[Euclid Avenue (Cleveland, Ohio)|Euclid Avenue]] and Doan Brook Boulevard ([[Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard]] today).&lt;ref name="universitycircle15"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.universitycircle.org/uci.aspx?page=15 |title = History |publisher = University Circle |date = October 15, 1957 |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1890s, the Western Reserve School of Design for Women ([[Cleveland Institute of Art]]) moved to University Circle, and the concept of developing a world-class arts and cultural center came to life. The concept became more concrete when [[Jeptha Wade]], a trustee of Western Reserve University, set aside land for the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] to be built in the Circle. The Historical Society ([[Western Reserve Historical Society]]) joined these institutions before the start of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=UC |work = Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |title =University Circle  |date = July 23, 1997 |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
The Circle began to grow rapidly in the early 20th century. The [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] opened its doors in 1916. By the 1920s and 1930s, 19 educational and cultural institutions were located in the area, from the [[Cleveland Museum of Natural History]] to the [[Cleveland Hearing &amp; Speech Center|Cleveland Hearing and Speech Center]] to the [[Cleveland Botanical Garden]] and others.

Cleveland's [[college football]] scene began in University Circle through both [[Case Western Reserve Spartans football|Case and Western Reserve football]] teams.   Van Horn Field hosted games against [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]], [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]], and [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]].  Famed Notre Dame coach [[Knute Rockne]] made his coaching debut against Case in University Circle in [[1918 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|1918]].  In [[1920 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1920]], The [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama Crimson Tide]] played their first ever game in the [[Northern United States|north]] at Van Horn Field against Case. 

The arrival of [[University Hospitals]] in 1931 (founded in 1866) led to health care becoming another center of innovation in University Circle. Less than {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} away from University Hospitals, the [[Cleveland Clinic]] had been serving its patients since 1921. Also in 1931 [[Severance Hall]], home of the [[Cleveland Orchestra]], was constructed at the corner of Euclid and East Boulevard.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt; By 1950, 34 institutions had chosen University Circle as their home.&lt;ref name="universitycircle15"/&gt; In 1967, Case School of Applied Science and Western Reserve University confederated to become [[Case Western Reserve University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=CWRU |work = Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |title = Case Western Reserve University |date =  |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
University Circle remains [[Cleveland]]'s center for cultural, educational, religious, and social-service institutions.  The area is currently undergoing many construction projects with many institutions expanding, and private development of residential and commercial dwellings.  New housing developments in the area have increased the number of year-round residents in the area to an estimated 15,000 as of 2013.&lt;ref name="plainduc1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blog.cleveland.com/architecture/2013/03/can_university_circle_bring_th.html |title = Can University Circle lure the rich back to Cleveland, acquire a skyline and share the wealth? |location = Cleveland |work = The Plain Dealer |date = March 23, 2013 |accessdate = September 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland|Museum of Contemporary Art]] (MoCA) opened its new permanent location in University Circle at the corner of [[U.S. Route 322|Mayfield Road]] and [[Euclid Avenue (Cleveland)|Euclid Avenue]].&lt;ref name="plaindmoca1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2012/10/museum_of_contemporary_art_cle_9.html |title = Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland to open permanent home after 44 years on the move |location = Cleveland |work = The Plain Dealer |date = March 23, 2013 |accessdate = October 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public transportation==
[[File:HealthLine 1.jpg|thumb|A [[HealthLine]] [[Bus rapid transit|BRT]] vehicle drives through University Circle passing the [[Allen Memorial Medical Library]].]]
University Circle is served by multiple forms of transportation, including rapid train, bus, [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT), and circulators. Unique from other [[Cleveland]] neighborhoods, it contains two train stops on the [[Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority|RTA]]'s [[Red Line (Cleveland)|Red Line]], the [[Little Italy–University Circle (RTA Rapid Transit station)|Little Italy-University Circle Station]] and the [[University Circle (RTA Rapid Transit station)|University Circle-Cedar Rapid Station]]. The CircleLink shuttle service (colloquially known as the "Greenie") provides free public transportation within University Circle. It provides service between the north and south sides of the CWRU campus, from University Circle to Coventry Village, around the CWRU campus and the [[University Hospitals of Cleveland]], and between the [[Urban Child Research Center]] and the main Case campus.&lt;ref name="greenie.case.edu"&gt;http://greenie.case.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;  The new BRT [[HealthLine]], which opened on October 24, 2008, is the newest option to the neighborhood, being a major destination on the line along [[Euclid Avenue (Cleveland, Ohio)|Euclid Avenue]] that connects [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]] to [[Louis Stokes Station at Windermere]] in [[East Cleveland, Ohio|East Cleveland]]. In a $197 million project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Michelle |last = Jarboe |url = http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2009/11/clevelands_euclid_corridor_pro.html |title = Cleveland's Euclid corridor project has paved the way to economic development |work = The Plain Dealer |location = Cleveland |date =  |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Euclid Avenue was rebuilt during construction, with the installation of public art, new lighting, and sidewalks along the entire length of the HealthLine, along with dedicated bus lanes.  There are seven [[HealthLine]] stops in University Circle and runs 24 hours.  Additionally, many bus routes have stops in University Circle, including bus numbers 7, 8, 9, 10, 32, 38, and 48/48A.

{{div col end}}

==Construction and expansion projects==
University Circle is undergoing $2 billion in construction and renovation projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author =  |url = http://www.city-data.com/forum/21052288-post15.html |work = City-Data Forum |title = What is the best urban neighborhood in the Midwest? |date =  |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uptown project===
[[File:Cleveland Uptown Apartments University Circle.jpg|thumb|Apartments and Retail in the Uptown construction project]]

The Uptown project is a multi-phase, $150 million-plus retail, entertainment, restaurant and cultural project under development by MRN Ltd. of Cleveland, and sponsored by [[Case Western Reserve University]] and University Circle Inc.  Its location creates a true center to University Circle.

A $44.5 million "Phase I" broke ground on August 2, 2010, creating two mixed-use buildings of 102 apartments above first floor retail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Michelle |last = Jarboe |url = http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2010/07/developer_mrn_ltd_to_break_gro.html |title = Developer MRN Ltd. to break ground Monday on Uptown project in University Circle |work = The Plain Dealer |location = Cleveland |date =  |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional anchors of the project currently under construction include the $66 million expansion of the [[Cleveland Institute of Art]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2011/11/gund_foundation_and_family_mem.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the $32 million new home for the [[Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland|Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Foreign Office Architects |url = http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2010/11/moca_cleveland_board_approves.html |title = MOCA Cleveland board approves building new home in University Circle's Uptown development |work = The Plain Dealer |location = Cleveland |date =  |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new MOCA is designed by the London architect [[Farshid Moussavi]]. The surrounding pedestrian plaza is designed by [[James Corner|James Corner Field Operations]], the same landscape architecture firm who designed the [[High Line]] in New York City.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/30/realestate/commercial/cleveland-ignites-job-growth-with-rebuilding-project.html?_r=1 |work = The New York Times |first = Keith |last = Schneider |title = Cleveland Ignites Job Growth With Rebuilding Project |date = November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The $21 million "Phase II" consists of 43 apartments, dormitories for the [[Cleveland Institute of Art]], and retail.  The anchor tenant is a two-story bowling alley, known as Corner Alley.  Completion date was in fall 2014.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2013/05/uptown_project_picks_up_corner.html&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Euclid–East 120th (RTA Rapid Transit station)]] has been relocated to Mayfield Road at East 119th Street.  With a total cost of $17.5 million, it was renamed the Little Italy-University Circle Rapid Station.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.riderta.com/majorprojects/littleitalyuc&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 30, 2011, the ''[[New York Times]]'' showcased the project with an article entitled "Cleveland Turns Uptown Into New Downtown".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

===Cleveland Museum of Art expansion===
On March 7, 2005 the Cleveland Museum of Art embarked on a multi-year project to renovate and expand into the next century. The project is designed by architect [[Rafael Viñoly]], combining old and new styles. At a total cost of $350 million, it is the largest cultural project in the history of the state of Ohio and one of the most comprehensive renovation and expansion projects in the museum field in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.clevelandart.org/about/the%20building%20project.aspx |title = The Building Project |publisher = The Cleveland Museum of Art |date =  |accessdate = October 29, 2011 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111103102849/http://www.clevelandart.org/about/the%20building%20project.aspx |archivedate = November 3, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University Hospitals/Case Medical Center expansion===
Three new facilities and structures opened in summer of 2011.  They include the $250 million [[commons:File:Seidman Cancer Center.jpg|Seidman Cancer Center]], $41 million Center for Emergency Medicine, and a $30 million new parking structure.&lt;ref&gt;http://media.cleveland.com/pdgraphics_impact/photo/14fguhnetworkjpg-9522855e3d84a04c.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

===Train stations===
Both current University Circle train stations were rehabbed and reconstructed by August 2015.

The [[University Circle (RTA Rapid Transit station)|University Circle-Cedar Rd rapid station]] underwent a complete rehab, using an [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]]-compliant design to include a new rail entry plaza, waiting area, and train loading platform.  A new bus terminal was also constructed on the north side of Cedar Road with a pedestrian connection between the bus terminal and the rail station.  Secured funding included a $10.5 million grant from the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] and a $2 million grant from the [[Federal Transit Administration]]—totaling $12.5 million in federal funds.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.cleveland.com/sunpress/2011/05/university_circle_rapid_statio_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Euclid–East 120th (RTA Rapid Transit station)|Euclid–East 120th rapid station]] was relocated in conjunction with the Uptown Project to E.119 St and Mayfield Rd.  Funding was received through a $12.5 million grant from the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]], via the [[Federal Transit Administration]]. The final cost of the new station was around $17.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2011/12/post_545.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Louis Stokes VA Medical Center expansion===
Totaling a $526 million expansion, this project includes a seven-story administrative office tower, living space for 122 homeless veterans, a 2,000-car parking garage, and a seven-story tower with 222 patient beds. Among the other parts of the project are the renovation of the hematology/oncology unit, expansion of the radiation area, building two floors on top of the atrium to accommodate various services, and an expanded operating room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.urbanohio.com/forum2/index.php?topic=13900.0 |title = Cleveland: VA Hospital Expansion |work = Urbanohio.com |date =  |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case Western Reserve University expansion===
Two major new construction projects are readying to break ground:
*Tinkham Veale Student Center
*Wyant Field House

In Spring 2012, [[Case Western Reserve University]] campus will undergo the construction of $50 million student center in the center of campus.  It will be known as the Tinkham Veale Student Center designed by [[Ralph Johnson (architect)|Ralph Johnson]] of [[Perkins and Will|Perkins + Will]].  It will encompass  82,000-square-feet, have 24/7 student access, and be environmentally friendly—with a green roof to absorb rainwater and windows designed to prevent excessive heat from sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Steven |last = Litt |url = http://blog.cleveland.com/architecture/2011/10/architect_ralph_johnsons_new_t.html |title = Architect Ralph Johnson's new Tinkham Veale University Center at CWRU will bring 21st-century flair to University Circle |work = The Plain Dealer |location = Cleveland |date =  |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second project will be known as the Wyant Field House, enclosing the last open portion of [[DiSanto Field]].  The Wyant Field House will be approximately 24,000 square feet and will serve as a facility for varsity athletes and the 2,500 students who reside at The Village. The facility will include weight training and cardiovascular areas, a Varsity Club lounge, and multipurpose space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blog.case.edu/case-news/2010/06/07/wyantfieldhouse |title = Case Western Reserve University &amp;#124; News Center |publisher = Blog.case.edu |date = June 7, 2010 |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Little Italy==
[[Image:Cleveland's Little Italy.jpg|thumb|left|One of Little Italy's best known culinary landmarks, Presti's Bakery, sits at the corner of Mayfield and Coltman]]
'''Little Italy''' (known locally as "Murray Hill" or "The Hill")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://clevelandlittleitaly.com/about/ |title = About |publisher = Cleveland Little Italy |date =  |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[ethnic neighborhood|ethnic enclave]] that serves as the historic center of Cleveland's [[Italian American]] community. It is located from E. 119th to E. 125th streets on Murray Hill and [[U.S. Route 322|Mayfield]] roads, situated at the eastern city limits, along a long, moderately sloping grade that ascends in elevation approximately 300 feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:3:1205774897574425::NO::P3_FID:1066654 |title = GNIS Detail: Cleveland |publisher = United States Geological Survey |date =  |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;    It is bounded to the east and south by suburban [[Cleveland Heights, Ohio|Cleveland Heights]], to the northeast by [[Lakeview Cemetery]], and to the west by [[CSX]], [[Norfolk Southern]], and [[Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority]] [[Red Line (Cleveland)|Red Line]] railroad tracks, which separates it from the rest of University Circle.

===Points and events of interest===
Little Italy is known for its several culinary, historic, and cultural sites. Its biggest attractions are the restaurants, bakeries, and pizzerias.  It is also home to a thriving [[art gallery]] scene and many boutique shops.  The best known historic structure is [[Holy Rosary Church (Cleveland, Ohio)|Holy Rosary Church]] built in 1908.  Culturally, the Alta House is the community center for the neighborhood founded in 1895.  The private elementary and middle school is Montessori Elementary at [[Holy Rosary Church (Cleveland, Ohio)|Holy Rosary Church]].  Tony Brush Park&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universitycircle.org/locations/tony-brush-park&lt;/ref&gt; provides the neighborhoods green space and playgrounds.

[[File:MurrayHillLittleItalyCleveland.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The annual highlight event of Little Italy in Cleveland is the [[Cleveland Feast of the Assumption Festival|Feast of the Assumption]].]]

Each August, the [[Roman Catholic]] congregation of the historic [[Holy Rosary Church (Cleveland, Ohio)|Holy Rosary Church]] celebrates the 4-day festival for the [[Assumption of Mary|Feast of the Assumption]], in which Little Italy stages Greater Cleveland's [[Cleveland Feast of the Assumption Festival|largest Italian-American street festival]].   Every October, Little Italy hosts the city's [[Columbus Day]] Parade.  The neighborhood enjoys artwalks a few times a year, usually in June, October, and December.

===History===
Little Italy began in 1895 when immigrant Joseph Carabelli saw the need for monument work in Cleveland's [[Lakeview Cemetery]] and established what soon became the city's leading marble and granite works.  Local Cleveland industrial billionaire [[John D. Rockefeller]] took a special liking to the Italian immigrants of the neighborhood and commissioned the building of the community center Alta House, named after his daughter [[Alta Rockefeller Prentice]], in 1900.  Little Italy is also home to the first Italian restaurant to open in the [[State of Ohio]], Guarino's.  The first hand-crank pasta machine was invented in Little Italy by Angelo Vitantonio, an Italian immigrant to Cleveland. He received a [[patent]] for the product in 1906, and went on to found the Italian kitchenware manufacturer [[VillaWare]], which continues to operate today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.peasandcornco.com/villawares.asp |title = Villawares home kitchen appliances from the Peas and Corn Company |publisher = Peasandcornco.com |date =  |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1911 it was estimated that 96% of the inhabitants were Italian-born, and another 2% were of Italian parents.  [[Ettore Boiardi]] (Chef Boyardee) opened his first restaurant, Il Giardino d'Italia, in the 1920s.  In 1993, the community dedicated Tony Brush Park, named for champion boxer and Little Italy resident Anthony Brescia, at Mayfield and Random roads. Major residential project expansions occurred in 2003 with the 20-unit Villa Carabelli,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bxmagazine.com/article.asp?ID=225&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005 with the 15-unit Random Road Lofts townhomes,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clevelandheights.com/upload/newsletter/TopoftheHill.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2011 the 27-unit 27 Coltman townhouses.&lt;ref&gt;http://27coltman.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The neighborhood [[bocci]] courts are located at the Alta House, and in 2011 underwent a complete remodeling in a $110,000 project, being named in honor of Nick and Dorothy Lucarelli.

For a large part of its history, Cleveland was home to the largest [[Cleveland crime family|Mafia organization]] between New York and Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.clevelandmob.com/ |title = Cleveland Mafia |publisher = Clevelandmob.com |date =  |accessdate = October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mayfield Road Mob was the name of a gang which began around 1920 in Little Italy. Among the members of the "Mayfield Road Mob" were [[James T. Licavoli]] and [[Jimmy Fratianno]]. This Mafia faction was even mentioned by its old name in the movie "[[The Godfather (movie)|The Godfather]]" as the Lakeview Road Gang, as [[Lakeview Cemetery]] borders Mayfield Road Hill.

[[Nepal]], a Himalayan country situated in [[South Asia]], is [[List of Poorest Countries|one of the poorest countries of the world]]. It has suffered from [[Nepalese Civil War|political instability]] and [[Kingdom of Nepal|undemocratic rule]] for much of [[History of Nepal|its history]]. There is a lack of access to basic services, people have superstitious beliefs, and there is [[gender discrimination]]. Although the [[Constitution of Nepal|Constitution]] provides protections for women, including equal pay for equal work, the [[Government of Nepal|Government]] has not taken significant action to implement its provisions. 

The status of women in Nepal remains very poor in terms of health, education, income, decision-making, and access to policymaking. Patriarchal practices, which control women's lives, are reinforced by the legal system. Women face systematic discrimination, particularly in rural areas. Literacy rates are substantially lower than men's, and women work longer hours. Violence against women is still common, and there are not enough women in professions. Women’s representation has been ensured in constituent assembly, but women’s equal participation in all state mechanisms is far from ideal.

==Female Literacy Rate==
[[Literacy]] rates in Nepal still remain low, at 52.74% ([[CBS]], 2001). Despite improvement in recent years, the disparity in literacy rates between men and women still remains. In 2001, the rate of literacy for females stood at 42.49%. The low rate of literacy for women can be attributed to the discrimination they face at home.

Females face gender-based violence and this greatly limits their ability to attend school or receive proper education. Furthermore, religion restricts the opportunities for women to receive education. For example, the majority of the female [[Muslim]] population in Nepal is still deprived of [[basic education]], with only 20% having had any level of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Department for International Development Nepal, DFIDN Nepal Operational Plan: Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Annex|url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/publications1/op/nepal-2011-annex.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Dfid.gov.uk|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The percentage of women from rural areas who have never attended school: 51.1% (CBS, 2008) as compared to the percentage of women from urban areas who have never  attended school is 25% (CBS, 2008). This is reflected in the disparity in literacy rates, between women in rural areas, 36.5%, and those in urban areas, 61.5%. Literacy rates in rural areas are almost half that in urban areas. Although overall female participation in the workforce has increased, the majority of employed women are still heavily concentrated in the low-wage and more labor-intensive industries. Formal sector female participation is 6%. According to the 2008 report from CBS, there were 155 000 male professionals, but only 48 000 female professionals, about 31% of female professionals. This is in stark contrast to female participation in the [[subsistence agricultural]] sector, with female participation almost 160% that of male participation.

==Access to Health Services==
Health services in Nepal are inadequate and insufficient and are thus reflected in the low health status of Nepalese in relation to the rest of the [[Southeast Asian region]].
The most common illnesses that females at reproductive age face are [[anaemia]] and [[malnutrition]], due to the discrimination faced in childhood and in growing up. As females, especially girls, are considered to be of the lowest status in the household, they are often the last to eat and thus do not receive the proper nutrition required. Almost 70% of females who have reached puberty suffer from these common illnesses. Also, many women often delay seeking medical help out of fear.

The [[maternity mortality ratio]] in Nepal, stands at 380 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births in 2008, according to estimates by the [[WHO]]/[[UNICEF]]/[[UNFPA]]/[[The World Bank]].Although there has been a significant decrease as compared to the ratio of 539 per 100 000 live births in 2003, the ratio is still one of the highest in the world.
Because of the inadequate provision of healthcare for pregnant mothers, they are more susceptible to death during the course of pregnancy and during labor itself. 
According to the [[Nepal Demographic and Health Survey]] (NDHS) 2001, about 10% of all births are carried out in the presence of a qualified doctor or medical staff. This reflects the prevalence of [[home births]], around 81% of all births, in Nepalese society. Due to the cultural beliefs, women are generally reluctant to allow any outsiders to be present or attend to the birth. [[Geography]] has also greatly limited the availability of health services especially those in rural and mountainous regions.Even though there has been much road development in recent years, females are less impacted by it, as they remain infrequent road users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Central Bureau of Statistics National Planning Commission Secretariat Government of Nepal|title=REPORT ON THE NEPAL LABOUR FORCE SURVEY 2008|url=http://cbs.gov.np/image/data/Surveys/2015/NLFS-2008%20Report.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender-Based Violence to women==
[[Gender-based violence]] (GBV) towards women is a severe issue in [[Nepal]] where its women often find themselves susceptible to both public and domestic violence which constitutes rape, sexual abuse in the workplace and at home, and [[human trafficking]]. There is a persistence of harmful traditional practices deemed life-threatening such as [[Deuki]] (act of offering young girls to Hindu temples to live without proper care or education) and [[Chhaupadi]] (menstruating women are kept in a shed away from the home to live under harsh conditions). Based on the study by [[United Nations Population Fund]]’s (UNFPA) entitled Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women in Nepal, abused women are more inclined to suffer from depression, anxiety, psychosomatic symptoms, sexual dysfunction and various reproductive health problems.

In the recently published Nepal Human Rights Yearbook 2012 by Informal Sector Service Center (INSEC), a study of all 75 districts across the country returned results of 648 women as victims of violence in 2011. In addition, the number of girls under the age of 18 who were affected stands at 379.

The proportion of Nepali women who have been subjected to domestic violence are estimated at 60 to 70 per cent. Gender-based violence is worse in rural communities where an estimated 81 per cent of women experience recurring domestic violence.These incidences include physical abuse by husbands, [[polygamy]], dowry-related murders, and physical and psychological harassment by household members.

Reasons for gender-based violence in Nepal are largely attributed to social taboos and superstitions associated with women and deeply entrenched beliefs that propagate derogatory attitudes toward female such as Chhori ko janma hare ko karma ("A daughter is born with a doomed fate").Likewise, results derived from INSEC’s monitoring of the situation indicated that subjugating women to domestic violence was considered a deep-rooted traditional practice.Survey results also show that 20 and 23 per cent of men and women in Nepal view domestic violence as being acceptable.

Despite efforts of various human rights and women’s rights [[NGOs]], together with international aid agencies, to lobby for the elimination of domestic violence through implementation of more effective measures, the "Domestic Violence (Crime and Punishment)" bill introduced in 2002 is at a standstill.Complaints by women’s rights activists are directed towards the lackadaisical efforts of the law enforcement agencies in which disputes are settled without any charges pressed against the perpetrators. This is reflected in a statement by activist and former [[National Women Commission]] (NWC) chairperson Bandana Rana, "Often, police and local people try to settle the domestic dispute by pressing the women into accepting their ‘fate’ as the society is still dominated by Hindu patriarchy with its own set of strict codes—many of which are in conflict with basic rights for women".
