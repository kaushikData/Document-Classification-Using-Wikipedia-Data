'''Abdullah ibn Hudhafah as-Sahmi''' was a [[Sahaba|companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad]]. He is best known in [[Islamic]] tradition for his role as the courier of a letter from Muhammad to [[Khosrau II|Khusraw Parvez]] the King of [[Persia]], and for imprisonment and torture by [[Heraclius]], the [[Byzantine emperor]].

According to tradition, Heraclius attempted to convert to Abdullah Christianity with bribery and torture, but Abdullah refused to recant. Eventually, Heraclius released Abdullah and other Muslim prisoners when Abdullah agreed to kiss Heraclius forehead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Golden Stories of Umar Ibn Al-Khattab|first=Abdul Malik |last=Mujahid |publisher= Darussalam|isbn=9786035000994|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abu Sa'id Hasan ibn Bahram al-Jannabi''' ({{Lang-ar|أبو سعيد حسن بن بهرام الجنابي|Abū Saʿīd Ḥasan ibn Bahrām al-Jannābī}}; 845/855–913/914) was the founder of the [[Qarmatian]] state in [[Bahrayn (historical region)|Bahrayn]]. By 899, his followers controlled large parts of the region, and in 900 he scored a major victory over an [[Abbasid]] army sent to subdue him. He captured the local capital, [[Hadjar]], in 903, and extended his rule south and east into [[Oman]]. He was assassinated in 913, and succeeded by his eldest son [[Abu'l-Qasim Sa'id al-Jannabi|Sa'id]].

==Early life==
Abu Sa'id was of [[Persians|Persian]] origin, from [[Jannaba]] in coastal [[Fars Province|Fars]].{{sfn|Carra de Vaux|Hodgson|1965|p=452}} He was born sometime between 845 and 855,{{sfn|Madelung|1983}} and was reportedly crippled on his left side.{{sfn|Carra de Vaux|Hodgson|1965|p=452}} He later claimed (or it was claimed by his followers) that he had royal descent from the [[Sasanian dynasty]],{{sfn|Madelung|1983}} but in his early life he was a [[furrier]] or flour merchant, initially in his native Jannaba, an later in the vicinity of [[Kufa]], where he moved.{{sfn|Madelung|1983}} 

There he married into the Banu'l-Qassar family, who were prominent members of the [[Isma'ili]] community in the area. He was himself proselytized and taught by the missionary (''[[da'i|dā'ī]]'') [[Abu Muhammad Abdan]], the brother-in-law of [[Hamdan Qarmat]], the overall leader of the Isma'ili movement in Iraq. In the period about 874/884, Abu Sa'id was then in turn sent as a ''dā'ī'' to proselytize in Fars, in the area of Jannaba, [[Siniz]], [[Tavvaj]], and [[Mahruban]].{{sfn|Madelung|1983}} His mission was successful, and he gathered converts and funds, until he was denounced to the [[Sunni]] authorities. His treasure and stores were confiscated, but Abu Sa'id managed to escape and went into hiding, perhaps in Basra itself.{{sfn|Madelung|1983}}

==Conquest of Bahrayn==
After this, he was entrusted by Hamdan Qarmat with leading the missionary effort in [[Bahrayn (historical region)|Bahrayn]]. According to the 10th-century historian [[al-Mas'udi]], he arrived there in 886/887, but other sources place this at different dates, from 894 to 896, or even as late as 899, by which time however he is known to have established himself as a power in the area; as a result the later dates are unlikely to be correct.{{sfn|Madelung|1983}} 

Abu Sa'id initially assumed the role of a flour merchant in the town of [[Qatif]], where he established crucial bonds with the [[Banu Sanbar]], a [[Banu Thaqif|Thaqafi]] family of some prominence: the three sons, Hasan, Ali and Hamdan, became his closest supporters, while Hasan's daughter became his wife. The family would continue to play a leading role in the Qarmatian state over the next decades.{{sfn|Madelung|1983}} At Bahrayn he encountered another ''dā'ī'', Abu Zakariya al-Tamami, who had been sent by the [[Yemen]]i ''dā'ī'' [[Ibn Hawshab]], and who had managed to convert the [[Banu Kilab]] tribe. A certain rivalry ensued, but for long the two became reluctant partners, until Abu Sa'id finally had Abu Zakariya imprisoned and killed.{{sfn|Madelung|1983}}{{sfn|Daftary|1990|p=119}} Abu Sa'id nevertheless managed to gain the backing not only of the Kilab, but also of the [[Banu Uqayl]], who became the core of his military forces.{{sfn|Madelung|1983}}

With the backing of a strong [[Bedouin]] army, Abu Sa'id began attacking towns in the area: Qatif itself, Zara, [[Safwan]], Zahran, [[al-Hasa]], and Juwata. His expeditions reached as far east as [[Sohar]] (which he briefly captured after several attempts) in the [[Oman]] and west to Bilad al-Falaj and south to [[Yabrin]]; the central [[al-Yamama]] region was left devastated and depopulated in the process, as the local tribes of [[Banu Qushayr]] and [[Banu Sa'd]] were either killed or expelled.{{sfn|Madelung|1983}} Yamama was probably not placed under Qarmatian control, although they clashed with the [[Banu 'l-Ukhaidhir]] who ruled it at the time, and who later became allies of the Qarmatians.{{sfn|Madelung|1983}} At some unknown point, Abu Sa'id even captured the island of [[Awal]] (modern [[Bahrain]]), and imposed tariffs on shipping there.{{sfn|Madelung|1983}}

In 899, a major rift occurred in the Isma'ili movement, when Hamdan Qarmat and Abu Muhammad Abdan denounced the movement's secret leadership at [[Salamiya]], which had been taken over by [[Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah|Abdallah]], the future founder of the [[Fatimid Caliphate]]. Shortly after that, Hamdan Qarmat disappeared, while Abu Muhammad was murdered in the same year at the instigation of Zikrawayh ibn Mihrawayh, apparently on the instructions of Salamiya.{{sfn|Daftary|1990|pp=125–126}}{{sfn|Madelung|1996|p=24}} After Hamdan's disappearance, the term "Qarmatians" was retained by all Isma'ilis who refused to recognize the claims of Abdallah, and subsequently of the Fatimid dynasty.{{sfn|Madelung|1978|p=660}} Abu Sa'id likewise rejected Abdallah's claims; apart from ideological reasons and loyalty to his masters, political considerations may also have played a role, as this was "a favourable opportunity to make himself completely independent", as [[Wilferd Madelung]] put it.{{sfn|Madelung|1996|pp=25, 28}} It was also at that time, according to [[Ibn Hawqal]], that he had his rival Abu Zakariya al-Tamami imprisoned and executed, as he remained loyal to Abdallah.{{sfn|Madelung|1983}}{{sfn|Madelung|1996|p=25}}

By 899, his followers controlled most of Bahrayn, except for the regional capital [[Hadjar]], and in the north had advanced up to the vicinity of [[Basra]].{{sfn|Carra de Vaux|Hodgson|1965|p=452}}{{sfn|Madelung|1983}} This prompted the reaction of the [[Abbasid caliph]] [[al-Mu'tadid]], who in April 900 named his general [[al-Abbas ibn Amr al-Ghanawi]] governor of Bahrayn an Yamama, and sent him  with 2,000 soldiers, augmented with volunteers, against Abu Sa'id's forces. In July, in a salt marsh some two days' march from Qatif, the Abbasid army was defeated in battle. Al-Ghanawi was taken prisoner and later released, but the other captives were executed.{{sfn|Carra de Vaux|Hodgson|1965|p=452}}{{sfn|Madelung|1983}} In the aftermath of this success, Hadjar was captured, only to be lost again after the arrival of a new Abbasid governor in 901, while Abu Sa'id was leading an expedition in the vicinity of Basra.{{sfn|Madelung|1983}} In late 903, the Abbasid governor [[Ibn Banu]] reported to the central government in [[Baghdad]] that he had captured Qatif and defeated and killed Abu Sa'id's designated successor there.{{sfn|Madelung|1983}} Nevertheless, around the same time or a little later, Hadjar itself was forced to surrender anew to the Qarmatians after they cut its water supply. Many of its inhabitants chose flight to Awal, Siraf, and other places, while many who remained behind were either killed or converted in the [[pillaging]] that followed.{{sfn|Carra de Vaux|Hodgson|1965|p=452}}{{sfn|Madelung|1983}}

Despite the destruction visited upon it, Hadjar remained the chief city and capital of Bahrayn. Abu Sa'id, however, established his own palatial residence at al-Ahsa oasis.{{sfn|Madelung|1983}} From Bahrayn, the Qarmatians launched a series of raids against the vicinities of Basra, both to capture slaves and in retaliation for the participation of the local Zabba tribe in the 900 campaign against them.{{sfn|Madelung|1983}} The most notable of these raids occurred in Jul/–August 912, but although the local Abbasid governor was reportedly unable to confront it, the sources report that the force was involved very small, barely 30 men.{{sfn|Madelung|1983}}{{sfn|Madelung|1996|pp=29–30}}

==Governance and doctrine==
{{Ismailis|collapsed=yes}}
As the founder of the Qarmatian "[[republic]]" of Bahrayn, he was ascribed by later generations the establishment of its institutions.{{sfn|Carra de Vaux|Hodgson|1965|p=452}} While certainly far from their fully developed form as reported by Ibn Hawqal, he certainly did initiate some of them. The Qarmatian system was based on [[communal ownership]] and [[egalitarianism]], with a system of production and distribution overseen by Abu Sai'id's agents.{{sfn|Madelung|1983}}{{sfn|Daftary|1990|p=119}} For example, any livestock and supplies taken during raids were stored and distributed; slaves were employed in communal labour; the herding of cattle, camels, and sheep, the production of arms and clothing, were centrally directed; and all boys taken captive were trained together from the age of four, both in arms and riding and in the Qarmatian doctrine.{{sfn|Madelung|1983}} A council, the ''al-Iqdaniyya'', comprising representatives of leading families and senior officials, was also established in an advisory capacity.{{sfn|Daftary|1990|p=119}}

His religious teachings are less clear, as they are reported by few and heavily hostile sources.{{sfn|Madelung|1983}} Initially, he obviously adhered to the [[millennialist]] Isma'ili teachings about the imminent return of the ''[[mahdi|mahdī]]'', [[Muhammad ibn Isma'il]].{{sfn|Madelung|1983}} After the rift of 899, he no longer recognized the authority of Abdallah, who in 909 would establish the Fatimid Caliphate in [[Ifriqiya]]; according to the ''[[qadi]]'' [[Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad]], Abu Sa'id now claimed that the ''mahdī'' was no longer Ibn Isma'il but Muhammad, the son of [[Abdallah ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah]], whose appearance was expected in 912, but this information is of dubious reliability.{{sfn|Madelung|1983}} Following Isma'ili expectations that the ''mahdī'' would reveal the "hidden" or "inner" (''[[Batin (Islam)|bāṭin]]'') truths of the religion to his followers, thus ushering an "age of pure spiritual knowledge" and making religious laws and customs obsolete,{{sfn|Daftary|1990|pp=139–140}} Abu Sa'id abolished numerous Islamic rites, such as [[Salah|prayer]] and [[Fasting in Islam|fasting]].{{sfn|Madelung|1983}}

==Death and succession==
Al-Mas'udi reports that Abu Sa'id was murdered in June/July 913 while taking his bath in his palace by two ''[[saqlabi|ṣaqlabī]]'' eunuch slaves. Several of his higher-ranking officers and followers were killed at the same time, including Ali and Hamddan ibn Sanbar. However, the death was not reported in Baghdad until the summer of 914, perhaps indicating that it was kept secret until then.{{sfn|Carra de Vaux|Hodgson|1965|p=452}}{{sfn|Madelung|1983}} 

Of his seven sons, he was at first succeeded by the oldest, [[Abu'l-Qasim Sa'id al-Jannabi]], but his reign was brief; he was replaced by the youngest son, [[Abu Tahir al-Jannabi]].{{sfn|Carra de Vaux|Hodgson|1965|p=452}}{{sfn|Madelung|1996|p=37}} Most Arabic sources agree that Abu Sa'id had appointed him as his heir, but that he was deposed in 923 by Abu Tahir. Another tradition, by the Kufan anti-Isma'ili polemicist [[Abu Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Rizam al-Ta'i]], reports that Abu Sa'id intended for Abu Tahir to succeed him, and had named Sa'id only as regent, and that Sa'id voluntarily relinquished power to his brother in 917/918.{{sfn|Madelung|1996|p=37}} Indeed, it is likely that power was nominally invested among all of Abu Sa'id's sons, with Abu Tahir being the dominant among them during his reign.{{sfn|Madelung|1996|p=39}}

Following his death, Abu Sa'id became the object of veneration by his followers. It was believed that he would [[resurrection|return]] to lead them, to the point that a saddled horse was permanently kept at the entrance of his tomb.{{sfn|Carra de Vaux|Hodgson|1965|p=452}} The state he founded survived for almost two centuries, and as late as the mid-11th century the Bahrayni Qarmatians called themselves ''Abū Saʿīdī''s after him.{{sfn|Carra de Vaux|Hodgson|1965|p=452}}{{sfn|Daftary|1990|p=119}}

'''Alexander Brush''' (February 8, 1824 – June 1, 1892) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Mayor]] of the City of [[Buffalo, New York]], serving 1870–1873 and 1880–1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rizzo|first=Michael|title=Through The Mayors' Eyes|year=2005|publisher=Lulu|isbn=978-1-4116-3757-3|pages=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Early life==
He was born on February 8, 1824 at [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name="Genealogy1980"&gt;{{cite book|title=Biography and Genealogy Master Index|date=1980|publisher=[[Gale Research Company]]|page=700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EuDiAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=14 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1848, he moved to Buffalo and opened a [[Brick yard|brick making business]].&lt;ref name="bflo"/&gt;

Brush first served as [[Alderman]] for the third Ward in 1861 and reelected to that position until becoming street commissioner.  He was elected mayor November 2, 1869, as the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Revised Charter of the City of Buffalo: With the By-laws and Ordinances and Other Acts, Applicable to the City of Buffalo, and the Officers Thereof : Together with the Names of the Officers of the City Government from Its Corporation as a City in 1832, to 1878, Inclusive|date=1878|publisher=Printing House of Young, Lockwood &amp; Company|location=[[Buffalo, N.Y.]]|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X5tKAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=14 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was re-elected in a special election held in February 1872.&lt;ref name="bflo"/&gt;

During his term the cornerstone was laid for the [[County and City Hall]], which was not completed until early in 1876.  At the end of his second term, he declined to be a candidate for re-election. In 1879, six years after retiring from public office, on November 4, 1879, he was once again elected mayor and served until 1881.&lt;ref name="bflo"/&gt;

'''Anne Griffith''' (1734 – 1821) was a Welsh practitioner of folk medicine who was early user of foxgloves to treat heart conditions.

==Life==
Griffith was born in [[Aberdaron]] in 1734. She spent all of her adult life at a small cottage, Bryn Canaid, in the area of the parish called Uwchmynydd. She was known for herbal recipes. Noable amongst of which was her use of foxgloves for heart conditions. This was before it had been formally "discovered" by the British scientist [[William Withering]].

She also acted as a midwife and among the children was Richard Robert Jones otherwise known as the linguist [[Dic Aberdaron]].&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;{{Citation|title=Griffith, Anne (1734–1821), practitioner of folk medicine {{!}} Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/70541|work=The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/70541|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffish died at her home in 1821 and she was buried in [[St Hywyn's Church, Aberdaron]]. Information is known about her work due to studies of William Jones (Gwilym Daron) who lives in Aberdaron.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

'''Andrés Almarales Manga''' (1935 in [[Ciénaga, Magdalena|Cienaga]], [[Magdalena Department|Magdalena]], [[Colombia]] &amp;ndash; 7 November 1985, in [[Bogotá]]) was one of the commanders of the [[19th of April Movement]] (M-19) terrorist group. He was a member of the [[Colombian Communist Party]]. He worked with the socialist groups under Antonio Garcia and with the United People's Front with the priest, [[Camilo Torres Restrepo|Camilo Torres]]. He received Haba guerrilla instruction in Cuba and communist countries of Europe.&lt;ref name="semana"&gt;{{cite news|title=Las Cabezas Caidas del M19|url=http://www.semana.com/especiales/articulo/las-cabezas-caidas-del-m-19/7193-3|accessdate=7 August 2017|work=La Semana|date=9 September 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eco"&gt;{{cite news|title=Una historia que no tuvo eco|url=http://www.elespectador.com/impreso/cuadernilloa/judicial/articuloimpreso-una-historia-no-tuvo-eco|accessdate=7 August 2017|work=El Espectador|date=20 November 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101919/http://www.elespectador.com/impreso/cuadernilloa/judicial/articuloimpreso-una-historia-no-tuvo-eco|archivedate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Almarales was one of the founders of the M-19 and representative to the camera from the Socialist Anapo. He participated in stealing weaponry from the North Corner and in terrorist activities in the south of the country. His group recruited guerrillas and supporters in the union sector. Captured in the municipality of [[Bolivar, Santander|Bolivar]] ([[Santander Department|Santander]]) in 1979, Almares was put under house arrest and found guilty by Picota. When he rejoined civilian life, he wrote works on syndicalism and shortly thereafter helped plan the capture of the Dominican Republic. Later, his crimes were pardoned during the government of [[Belisario Betancur]].&lt;ref name="semana"/&gt;

When [[Carlos Toledo Plata]] was assassinated in 1984 in Bucaramanga, Almares organized the memorial service in Romero park, in front of the central cemetery of that city, as an insult to then-president Belisario Betancur and the Time newspaper. His group recruited young people for the armed resistance movement. Shortly thereafter, he moved to the Valley of the Cauca and collaborated with the M-19 to protect around Cali. In a popular action by the [[Patriotic Union (Colombia)]] in the Plaza de Bolivar of Bogota, Almarales spoke rudely comparing the press to  a "sewer", referring to President Betancur, minister of Government [[Jaime Castro]] and the Colombian conservative group.&lt;ref name="eco"/&gt;

On August 24th, 1984 he arranged a ceasefire between his group and the government of President Betancur. In front of all the television networks, he declared: "As of today, not a drop of blood was spilled by the subversives."

A radical and capable participant in negotiations, Almarales participated in the peace process. Later he was buried alongside [[Luis Otero Cifuentes]] and [[Alfonso Jacquin]]. There are two versions of his death:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=María, compañera de Andrés Almarales, recuerda sus últimos momentos con el guerrillero|url=http://caracol.com.co/radio/2005/11/04/audios/1131112200_218208.html|accessdate=7 August 2017|work=Caracol Radio|date=4 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Most well-known: he committed suicide in the Palace with the hostages.
#He was escorted by the military to the Florero House in Bogota where he was tortured and assassinated in the Usaquén Escuela de Caballeria and secretly buried in the Palace with the others similarly killed.

[[Grief]] is “a multifaceted response to loss, particularly to the loss of someone or something that has died, to which a bond or affection was formed”. A common emotion amongst [[human]]s, grief is also apparent in [[animal]]s, known as '''animal grief'''. In the late 19th century, research started to show grief in [[chimpanzee]]s and the connection between animal and human grief. However, until recently, grief has never been the focus of [[research]]. [[Marc Bekoff]], a scientist, has spent his time researching emotions in animals, including grief. Combined with other research, the following animals have been seen to grieve: [[Gray wolf|wolves]], chimpanzees, [[magpie]]s, [[elephant]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[otter]]s, [[Goose|geese]], [[sea lion]]s, and many more.

Grief can be caused by many things and one of the things to understand is animal pain and emotions.

== What is Animal Pain? ==
Bernard E. Rollin says that the ability to experience '''pain''' is something we have to feel to be considered moral (Rollin, 2010). It can result from something such as a wound or abuse causing physical pain. Animals can also experience pain mentally, such as experiencing grief as well as sadness due to anxiety. Animal pain can be understood once we understand the nature of a certain animal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=41486940|title=Animal Pain: What It is and Why It Matters|journal=The Journal of Ethics|volume=15|issue=4|pages=425–437|last1=Rollin|first1=Bernard E|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when somebody is caring for a dog as a pet the individual understands their actions, their traits and emotions. While taking care of an animal we are then able to understand that specific animal and their way of grieving or their happiness per se.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The difference in pain from humans and animals is how one is willing to bear pain for a better lifestyle. Rollin mentions an example of extending life. This example states that the owner may think pain will be a small price to pay for the life of their pet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since an animal cannot express their pain or how much something may hurt these emotions or decisions are hard to conclude. Pain felt can sometimes be unbearable to the point where humans have the decision or thought to choose death over the continuation of that pain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Animal Emotions ==
A question that is asked is if animals have any emotions? Marc Bekoff defines emotion as something that helps behavioral control and management (Bekoff, 2000).&lt;ref name="Bekoff2010" /&gt; It is known that humans have emotions and that it is something fundamental and important in our lives, however it is hard to say if that is true for animals or just some. There are different ways you can tell the emotion of animal: how they’re acting or how they’re looking at someone or something.

=== Primary Emotions and Secondary Emotions ===
There are different “categories” of emotions known as primary and secondary emotions. Bekoff explains that primary emotions are similar to reflex or something along the lines of fear or fight-or-flight response. Therefore, it is something that animals react to such as loud noises, unknown objects, or odors (Bekoff, 2000).&lt;ref name="Bekoff2010" /&gt; Having primary emotions is crucial because reactions to these are important for an animal's survival. The part of the brain that is responsible for primary emotions is the limbic system (Bekoff, 2000).&lt;ref name="Bekoff2010" /&gt;

Secondary emotions are part of an experience. These emotions are taking part in the central cortex of the brain because of the requirement of different and higher brain centers. With secondary emotions it allows one (in this case the animals that do feel grief) to create the connection between feelings and actions.

==Early Research on Animal Grief==
In 1879, Arthur E. Brown studied how a male chimpanzee reacted after the death of his female counterpart. He saw the male chimpanzee display grief and "a cry which the keeper of the animals assures [Brown] he had never heard before").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Arthur E. |title=Grief in the Chimpanzee |journal=The American Naturalist |date=1879 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=173–175 |jstor=2448772}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing to the next day, the chimpanzee sulked and barely moved. Brown deciphered that the male chimpanzee was [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] after the female chimpanzee died. However, Brown concluded that any permanent grief is only found in man, as the chimpanzee seemed fine after a couple of days.

[[William Emerson Ritter|William E. Ritter]] (1925) connects animal and human [[emotion]] to provide evidence of [[Human evolution|human descent]] from the animal kingdom. He mentions the [[James–Lange theory|James-Lange theory]], where "all emotional stages as of joy, grief, fear, anger, jealousy, love, are associated with more or less characteristic bodily manifestation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ritter |first1=William E. |title=The Emotions in Man and Animals |journal=The Scientific Monthly |date=1925 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=137–138 |jstor=7499}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ritter proposes new evidence to the theory, mentioning that no item on the above list is exclusive to humans, and most are common to the animal world. He argues that because the connection between human emotion and [[Emotion in animals|animal emotion]] is so strong, humans have descended from the animal kingdom.

==Marc Bekoff's Recent Research on Animal Grief==
Marc Bekoff is a professor of [[ecology]] and [[evolutionary biology]] at the [[University of Colorado Boulder|University of Colorado-Boulder]]. He has spent his life studying animals and their emotions, finding that animals grieve quite frequently. Such examples of grieving animals are:
*Bekoff found that '''sea lion''' mothers squeal eerily when they watch their babies be eaten by [[killer whale]]s.&lt;ref name=Bekoff2000&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/50/10/861/233998|title=Animal Emotions: Exploring Passionate Natures {{!}} BioScience {{!}} Oxford Academic|website=academic.oup.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Even after their calves have died, '''dolphin''' mothers have been seen to save them and grieve when they confirm the death.&lt;ref name=Bekoff2000/&gt;
*'''Elephants''' have been "observed to stand guard over a stillborn baby for days with their head and ears hanging down". Orphan elephants, who have watched their mothers be killed, have been shown to wake up screaming.&lt;ref name=Bekoff2000/&gt;
* A '''wolf''' "sniffed [her dead companion], then sat back and gave the most soulful and heart-wrenching howl I've ever heard!"; After a pack member died, the wolves let their tails and heads hang low while walking slowly.&lt;ref name=Bekoff2010&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Emotional_Lives_of_Animals.html?id=TIW2D7eR_Y8C|title=The Emotional Lives of Animals: A Leading Scientist Explores Animal Joy, Sorrow, and Empathy--and why They Matter|last=Bekoff|first=Marc|date=2010|publisher=New World Library|isbn=9781577313489|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Chimpanzee''' orphans can die while in the state of grieving.&lt;ref name=Bekoff2010/&gt; [[Jane Goodall]] (1990) followed [[Flint (chimpanzee)|Flint]], a chimpanzee, for a few days after the death of Flint's friend Flo. She noted that Flint "walked along one of the branches, then stopped and stood motionless, staring down at an empty nest". Flint had been lethargic, even refusing food. Per Goodall, Flint was "hollow-eyed, gaunt and utterly depressed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Through_A_Window.html?id=Gc59YpamCvgC|title=Through a Window: 30 years observing the Gombe chimpanzees|last=Goodall|first=Jane|date=2011|publisher=Orion|isbn=9780297865360|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Magpies''' have been seen to mourn over their dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755458609000541|title=Animal emotions, wild justice and why they matter: Grieving magpies, a pissy baboon, and empathic elephants - ScienceDirect|website=sciencedirect.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*After a fellow goose died, [[Konrad Lorenz]] noted that other '''geese''' had their "eyes sink deep into their sockets, and the individual ha[d] an overall drooping experience, literally letting the head hang".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Minding_Animals.html?id=Or4TDAAAQBAJ|title=Minding Animals: Awareness, Emotions, and Heart|last=Bekoff|first=Marc|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=9780195150773|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="Bekoff2010" /&gt; The previous example shows that animals can express their grief and it is possible for an individual to identify that. Bekoff mentions an experience of a bird that lost its partner. It showed many signs of depression before it ended up passing away in a vegetative state similar to the one his partner ended up dying in (Bekoff, 2010). Many animals can show grief when they have lost a loved one of their own.

== How Long Do Animals Feel Grief? ==
One of the questions that can be asked aside from does animals grief is how long do they grieve for or if these animals show signs of mourning. Anthropologist Barbra J King mentions how animals might sleep less or change their ways in their daily life styles. These animals might also end up staying close to their companion's corpse for a long time as well (Safina, 2015).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/nature/animal-grief/|title=The Depths of Animal Grief — NOVA Next {{!}} PBS|date=2015-07-08|work=NOVA Next|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Something we know is that emotions in a human can change one day they can be sad and the other happy. Actions are taken days after one of our loved ones die such as time of school, work or any social interaction (Safina, 2015).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is actually the same for animals. An example that can be shown is in chimpanzees.

A case is shown with one names Amos. The day before he died he spent the day in his nest and did not move until a female chimpanzee Daisy went up to him (Safina, 2015).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When Amos died, one of the chimpanzees who was more sociable than the rest as well as a “higher rank” than the rest did not want to be with the group for weeks. As shown here it also depends on who passed away on how long an animal can grieve. Though through the time spent mourning many signs can appear of an animals grief and agony of the loss of their companion.

Another example mentioned is the dog Hachiko from Tokyo. In this case the dog was no grieving due to the death of an animal, but of the loss of its owner. It is known that this dog went to the station where his owner would come home to every day for around ten years.

==Other Research on Animal Grief==
Though Bekoff is the face of recent research on animal grief, other scientists are starting to look more into it. Some studies have looked at depression in animals, with Paul Willner finding that there are eighteen [[animal models of depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00427414|title=The validity of animal models of depression|journal=Psychopharmacology|volume=83|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1007/BF00427414|pmid=6429692|year=1984|last1=Willner|first1=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter J. Fashing &amp; Nga Nguyen (2012) found that a group of chimpanzees groomed and caressed a grieving, older chimpanzee. They also found that "the dying female [elephant] was approached by the matriarch of another group who repeatedly attempted to bring her to her feet using her tusks". Even otters grieve, where members of a group caught fish for months and brought them to the matriarch who had failing vision and poor mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anthro.fullerton.edu/_resources/pdf/nga/FashingandNguyen2011.pdf|title=Behavior toward the dying, diseased, or disabled among animals and its relevance to paleopathology|website=anthro.fullerton.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications of Research==
Though grief in animals may seem questionable, evidence shows it is abundant. From chimpanzees to otters to sea lions, animals grieve just like humans do. Researchers like Bekoff, Fashing, Nguyen, and others, are studying every day to help better understand how and why animals grieve. With increased knowledge, humans can have better relationships with animals. For example, zoo caretakers can study chimpanzee grief habits and better notice when a chimpanzee mother is mourning. The caretakers can then help the mother cope and live a healthy and successful life. Research shows grief in animals, and understanding that can help humans form closer, healthier connections with them.

He began fighting in the United States where his career picked up. On June 17, 2005 in Cabazon, California, he defeated Carlos Navarro for the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] Continental Americas super featherweight title by a 7th-round technical knockout.

The fight was derided for careless performances from both Velazquez and Pacquiao. Referee [[Kenny Bayless]] warned Bobby Pacquiao ten times for performing too many low blows before he disqualified him in the eleventh round. As a result, Hector was rushed to the hospital after the fight.

Bobby Pacquiao made his debut at lightweight on June 9, 2007 where he fought soon-to-be WBC super featherweight champion  [[Humberto Soto]] in a 10-round bout. After sustaining a wound that impaired his vision, he was knocked out in round 7.

Bobby Pacquiao made a statement of knocking his opponents out using his style of punching, he low blows all of his opponents several times and made them quit.

He was interviewed after the fight because of the low blows he executed , pacquiao answered "That's his weakest part , you know, ahmm it's his weakest part that's why" and accompanied with it's famous line, "Its not a blow blow".

Following three bouts in that division, Bobby Pacquiao knocked out Decho Bankluaygym in eight rounds on August 2, 2008 for the [[WBO]] Asia-Pacific lightweight title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/title_search.php?title=WBOAP&amp;division=Lightweight&amp;SUBMIT=Go|title=BoxRec|website=Boxrec.com|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 19, 2008 he lost by unanimous decision to NABA champ [[Robert Frankel (boxer)|Robert Frankel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philboxing.com/news/story-20156.html|title=BOBBY PACQUIAO LOSES TO NABA CHAMP ROBERT FRANKEL|website=Philboxing.com|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was his last bout.

Unlike his older brother who has won world titles in several weight classes, Bobby Pacquiao never even fought for a world title.

'''Body identification''' is a subfield of [[forensic science]] wherein investigators need to identify a body. Forensic (literally, "for the courts") purposes are served by rigorous scientific [[forensic identification]] techniques, but these are generally preceded by simply asking bystanders or other persons for the victim's name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coronerstories.wordpress.com/2005/01/21/burnt-beyond-recognition/' Burnt Beyond Recognition]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} coronerstories&lt;/ref&gt;

If a body is not badly decomposed or damaged, two persons (or one) who knew the deceased well should visually confirm the identity.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond the Body: Death and Social Identity|author1=Hallam, E.|author2=Hockey, J.L.|author3=Howarth, G.|date=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415182928|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vC97VxxEn2MC|page=82|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authorities will also compare supportive documents such as [[driver's license]], [[passport]], or other authoritative [[photo ID]] before accepting a personal identification with which to further their investigative and/or forensic purposes.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Medical Times and Gazette|date=1863|volume=2|publisher=J. &amp; A. Churchill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2hkCAAAAYAAJ|page=281|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any formal investigation should "reality check" additional forensic and scientific evidence to reinforce or question the supposed identity of the victim.&lt;ref name="leelofland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leelofland.com/wordpress/?cat=12|title=Death Investigation - The Graveyard Shift|publisher=leelofland.com|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reliable identification becomes increasingly difficult as time passes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailypress.com/topic/nytwa96-jet2me,0,6651025.story]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military==
In many cases, people who have died while serving in military branches remain unidentified due to how long their remains went undiscovered or due to various other causes. If unidentified bodies of service people are returned to their country, formal treatment is required in respect for the decedent. In the United States, servicemen from each branch of the military supervise the delivery and other transportation of the remains. While under examination, the unidentified person is placed in a white sheet until they are identified. After the person's body is identified, a funeral and burial takes place in accompaniment of members of the respective branch that the person served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilcox|first1=Charlotte|title=Mummies, Bones &amp; Body Parts|date=2000|publisher=San Val, Incorporated|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|isbn=0613438531|page=48}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

He played at the [[point guard]] position.

==College career==
Darby played [[college basketball]] with the [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State Buckeyes]], between 1999 and 2003, and was a part of two [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] champion teams. He averaged 9.6 points per game in his sophomore season, 12.8 points per game as a junior, and 18.3 points and 4.4 assists per game in his senior year, in 2002-03. At the end of his college career, he was ranked 25th on the school's career scoring list, with 1,368 points scored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aol.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/story/2011-12-07/former-buckeye-star-brent-darby-dies Former Buckeye star Brent Darby dies.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/814/brent-darby ESPN Men's Basketball: Brent Darby stats.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
After college, Darby played professional basketball internationally, from 2003 until 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20111206/SPORTS05/112060409/Former-River-Rouge-basketball-star-Brent-Darby-dies-age-30 ''Detroit News: Former River Rouge basketball star Brent Darby dies at age 30]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Israel, Poland, Spain, and France ([[Limoges CSP]]), and he also spent several years in Italy ([[Juvecaserta Basket|Pepsi Juvecaserta Basket]], Giorgio Tesi PT, [[Banco di Sardegna Sassari]], [[S.S. Felice Scandone|S.S. Felice Scandone (Sidigas AV)]], [[Reyer Venezia Mestre|Umana Reyer Venezia Mestre]]). 

==Personal life and death==
Darby eventually had to stop playing basketball, as he battled a series of [[Thrombus|blood clot]] problems. Doctors implanted filters in Darby's body to break up clots before they reached his lungs, and he had a surgery to remove a large clot from his leg. He died in 2011.

'''CALO''' was an [[List of notable artificial intelligence projects|artificial intelligence project]] that attempted to integrate numerous AI technologies into a cognitive assistant. CALO is an acronym for "'''Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes'''". The name was inspired by the Latin word "calonis," which means "soldier’s servant". The project started in May 2003 and ran for five years, ending in 2008.

The CALO effort has had many major spin-offs, most notably the [[Siri (software)|Siri]] [[intelligent software assistant]] that is now part of the [[Apple iOS]] since [[iOS 5]], delivered in several phones and tablets; Social Kinetics, a social application that learned personalized intervention and treatment strategies for chronic disease patients, sold to [[RedBrick Health]]; the [[Trapit]] project, which is a [[web scraper]] and [[news aggregator]] that makes intelligent selections of web content based on user preferences; [[Tempo (app)|Tempo AI]], a smart calendar; [[Desti]], a personalized travel guide; and [[Kuato Studios]], a game development startup.

CALO was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]) under its Personalized Assistant that Learns (PAL) program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Markoff |authorlink=John Markoff |title=A Software Secretary That Takes Charge |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/business/14stream.html?_r=1 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=14 December 2008 |accessdate=14 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/I2O/Programs/Personalized_Assistant_that_Learns_%28PAL%29.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805162949/http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/I2O/Programs/Personalized_Assistant_that_Learns_%28PAL%29.aspx|archivedate=2011-08-05|title=Personalized Assistant that Learns (PAL)|publisher=[[DARPA]]|accessdate=2013-05-18|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; DARPA's five-year contract brought together over 300 researchers from 25 of the top university and commercial research institutions, with the goal of building a new generation of cognitive assistants that can reason, learn from experience, be told what to do, explain what they are doing, reflect on their experience, and respond robustly to surprise. [[SRI International]] was the lead integrator responsible for coordinating the effort to produce an assistant that can live with and learn from its users, provide value to them, and then pass a yearly evaluation that measures how well the system has learned to do its job.

==Functions==
CALO assists its user with six high-level functions:

# ''Organizing and Prioritizing Information'': As the user works with email, appointments, web pages, files, and so forth, CALO uses machine learning algorithms to build a queryable model of who works on which projects, what role they play, how important they are, how documents and deliverables are related to this, etc.
# ''Preparing Information Artifacts'': CALO can help its user put together new documents such as PowerPoint presentations, leveraging learning about structure and content from previous documents accessed in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Pan |first=Sinno Jialin |last2=Yang | first2=Qiang |title=A Survey on Transfer Learning|journal=IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering|volume=22 |issue=10 |pages=1345–1359 |date=October 2010|doi=10.1109/TKDE.2009.191|citeseerx=10.1.1.216.1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Mediating Human Communications'': CALO provides assistance as its user interacts with other people, both in electronic forums (e.g. email) and in physical meetings.  If given access to participate in a meeting, CALO automatically generates a meeting transcript, tracks action item assignments, detects roles of participants, and so forth.  CALO can also put together a "PrepPak" for a meeting containing information to read ahead of time or have at your fingertips as the meeting progresses.
# ''Task Management'': CALO can automate routine tasks for you (e.g. travel authorizations), and can be taught new procedures and tasks by observing and interacting with the user.
# ''Scheduling and Reasoning in Time'':  CALO can learn your preferences for when you need things done by, and help you manage your busy schedule (PTIME published in ACM TIST).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Berry |first=Pauline M. |last2=Gervasio | first2=Melinda |last3=Peintner|first3=Bart | last4=Yorke-Smith | first4=Neil |title=PTIME: Personalized assistance for calendaring|journal=ACM Tist|volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=1–22 |date=July 2011 |doi=10.1145/1989734.1989744}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://tist.acm.org |title=ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (ACM TIST)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Resource allocation'': As part of Task management, CALO can learn to acquire new resources (electronic services and real-world people) to help get a job done.

==Evaluation==

Every year, the CALO system, after living with its user for a period of time, is given an achievement-style test of 153 "administration assistant" questions, primarily focused on what it has learned about the user's life.  Evaluators measure how well CALO's performance on these questions improves year-over-year, and how much of CALO's performance is due to "learning in the wild" (new knowledge, tasks, and inferences it has been able to acquire on its own, as opposed to function or knowledge hard-wired into the system by a developer).

==Framework==

[[SRI International]] made a collection of successful machine learning and reasoning technologies developed in the PAL program, primarily from the CALO project, available online. The available technologies include both general-purpose learning methods along with more focused learning applications. The PAL software and related publications are available at the PAL Framework website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pal.sri.com/Plone/framework|title=Framework|website=Personalized Assistant that Learns (PAL)|publisher=[[SRI International]]|accessdate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PAL capabilities have been modularized, packaged, and adapted to industry standards to facilitate their incorporation into target applications. Various infrastructure components and APIs are available to simplify interaction with the technologies. PAL capabilities were integrated into the [[US Army]]'s [[CPOF]] command and control system and fielded to Iraq in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=[[Thomas Garvey (artificial intelligence researcher)|Thomas Garvey]], [[Melinda Gervasio]], [[Thomas H.

The available technologies were developed by research teams at SRI International, [[Carnegie Mellon University]], the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], the [[University of Rochester]], the [[Institute for Human and Machine Cognition]], [[Oregon State University]], the [[University of Southern California]], and [[Stanford University]].

"'''Calculon 2.0'''" is the twentieth episode of the [[Futurama (season 7)|seventh season]] of the animated sitcom ''[[Futurama]]''. It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] on July 24, 2013. The episode was written by Lewis Morton and directed by Stephen Sandoval. Calculon (who died in "[[The Thief of Baghead]]") is backed up and put into the body of a new robot so he can return to ''All My Circuits'', only to learn that his over-the-top acting was never appreciated.

==Plot==
It has been a year since [[Calculon]] killed himself in a failed attempt to win an acting competition by making a death scene more realistic. Fry and Bender are so dissatisfied with Calculon's replacement Vaxtron on ''All My Circuits'' that they resolve to resurrect Calculon. Bender exhumes Calculon's body on live television, and Farnsworth organizes an occult [[ritual]] to return Calculon's soul to his body. The Robot Devil practically begs Fry and Bender to reclaim Calculon's soul as Calculon has been driving him crazy with badly performed Shakespeare-style monologues ever since his [[suicide]] a year earlier.

Successfully resurrected, Calculon returns to [[Hollywood]] to resume his role on ''All My Circuits'', but he is rejected by the network president as "hammy" and "old-fashioned". Calculon receives another blow when he views the televised ceremony in which his star is removed from Hollywood's Walk of Fame and replaced with a second star for [[Robert Wagner]]'s head. Undaunted, Calculon sees these setbacks as "an opportunity to prove anew" that he "is the greatest actor to ever trod the boards!" Starting at the bottom, he performs "HAL 9000", a [[one-man show|one-man play]] that he had written years earlier; the play is unanimously panned by the critics. Stunned and crushed, he realizes that he is not the great actor he thought himself to be. Fry suggests that Calculon perform his trademark "dramatic pause" to cheer himself up, but Calculon vows never to pause again.

As Calculon prepares to begin his journey through life as a non-actor, he solemnly laments his former delusions, moving Leela to tears. She suddenly realizes that Calculon is being sincere for the first time ever. She explains that if he could channel real emotions into his acting and leave out the hamming, he could be "great". She convinces him to audition for a bit part on ''All My Circuits''. Calculon goes to an audition in [[disguise]] and finds that he is to portray "Calculon, back from his kidnapping ordeal." The casting team, noting this auditionee's "old, past-your-prime" air, hires him on the spot.

On the set, Calculon returns to his old ways, forgetting the humility he had so recently learned. The script calls for him to whine about how pathetic he is and commit suicide by hanging himself with a rope from the ceiling. Instead, he hams it up, ruining the scene. Leela verbally beats him back into submission, and in the second take Calculon deeply moves everyone on the set, even the network president. Calculon reveals his identity and is prevailed upon to take a bow. He inadvertently pulls on the rope that is still hanging from the ceiling, and equipment begins crashing to the floor, crushing Calculon to death.

"On the basis of one performance that almost no one saw," Calculon is posthumously re-awarded a star on the Walk of Fame. Back in Robot Hell, the Robot Devil's torments are just beginning as Calculon resumes annoying him.

==Reception==
''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave this episode a B+.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/futurama-calculon-20-100448/ “Calculon 2.0” | Futurama | TV Club | TV | The A.V. Club&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Max Nicholson of [[IGN]] gave the episode a 7.8/10 "Good" rating, saying "This week's ''Futurama'' bid a (second) fond farewell to Calculon, with pretty consistent laughs throughout".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/25/futurama-calculon-20-review|title=Futurama: "Calculon 2.0" Review|last=Nicholson|first=Max|date=July 25, 2013|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Beckman''' (August 16, 1813 - January 9, 1892) was an [[United States|American]] farmer and politician from [[Watertown, Wisconsin|Watertown]], [[Wisconsin]] who held a number of public offices, from mayor to member of the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.wi.us/lrb/pubs/ib/99ib1.pdf "Members of the Wisconsin Legislature 1848&amp;ndash;1999 State of Wisconsin Legislative Bureau. Information Bulletin 99-1, September 1999. p. x] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209014416/http://www.legis.state.wi.us/lrb/pubs/ib/99ib1.pdf |date=December 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Beckman was born in [[Goershagen]], [[Province of Pomerania (1653–1815)|Pomerania]], [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] on August 16, 1813. He received a [[state school|common school]] education, and became a farmer. On October 31, 1839 he married Hannah Charlotte Knuth, like him a native of Prussia; they were to have seven children. They came to the U. S. in September 1843, settling first in [[Buffalo, New York]]. Beckman taught school in Western New York until they came to [[Wisconsin Territory]] in 1845, initially settling in [[Emmet, Dodge County, Wisconsin|Emmet]], in [[Dodge County, Wisconsin|Dodge County]] near Watertown.

== Politics and public offices ==
Beckman was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] member, serving on the resolutions committee of the 1861 Dodge County Democratic convention which denounced [[secession]] and [[sectionalism]], and denounced the [[Radical Republicans]] as sectionalists, calling instead for "a union of all conservative men" to fight alike the secessionists and the Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;"Proceedings of the Democratic Senatorial Convention of the Western District of Dodge County, at Juneau, on the 21st Day of October, A. D. 1861". ''[[Milwaukee News]]'' October 25, 1861; p. 1, col. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

When elected to the Assembly in 1873, Beckman had been Dodge County [[coroner]] for two terms;&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.V010 Harvey, Louis P., et al. "Annual report of the secretary of state, for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 1861" in, ''Annual message of the governor of Wisconsin, and reports of the state departments, for the fiscal year ending Sept, 30th, 1861'' Madison: Smith and Cullaton, 1861; p. 293]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[county supervisor]] for three years; an [[alderman]] for eight years; a [[school board|school commissioner]] for two years; city [[treasurer]] and [[city clerk]]; "Commissioner of the Public Debt"; [[tax assessment|assessor]] for six years; a [[justice of the peace]] for nineteen years; and had been mayor of the [[political subdivisions of Wisconsin#Cities|city]] of Watertown in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;"Hon. Charles Beckman" in, ''The History of Jefferson County, Wisconsin: Containing a History of Jefferson County, Its Early Settlement, Growth, Development, Resources, Etc...'' Chicago: Western Historical Company, 1879; p. 598&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected to the assembly's 1st [[Jefferson County, Wisconsin|Jefferson County]] district (which included the [[political subdivisions of Wisconsin#Towns|Towns]] of [[Ixonia, Wisconsin|Ixonia]] and [[Watertown (town), Wisconsin|Watertown]] as well as the entire City of Watertown, including those two [[wards of the United States|wards]] which actually were in [[Dodge County, Wisconsin|Dodge County]]) as an [[independent (politics)|independent]] candidate, receiving 834 votes to 753 for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent [[Patrick Devy]]. When the legislature convened, he declared himself a "Reform Democrat" and appears to have joined with the [[Reform Party (19th-century Wisconsin)|Reform Party]], a short-lived [[coalition]] of Democrats, [[reform]] and [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], and [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grangers]] formed in 1873 which had secured the election of a [[Governor of Wisconsin]] and a number of state legislators. He declared his occupation to be "justice of the peace"; and was assigned to the [[standing committee]] on [[corporations|incorporations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1874 Turner, A. J., ed. ''The legislative manual of the state of Wisconsin: comprising the constitutions of the United States and of the state of Wisconsin, Jefferson's manual, forms and laws for the regulation of business; also, lists and tables for reference, etc.'' Thirteenth Annual Edition. Madison: Atwood and Culver, Printers and Stereotypers, 1874; pp. 461, 471, 479]&lt;/ref&gt; He was not a candidate for re-election in 1874, and was succeeded by fellow Reformer [[Christian Mayer (Wisconsin)|Christian Mayer]], also a former mayor of Watertown.

== After the Assembly ==
When in 1875 a Watertown [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows#Encampment|Encampment]] of the [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows]] was organized, Beckman was elected to be its "High Priest", a position apparently second only to the "Grand Patriarch" of that body.

'''Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe''', [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] (12 May 1816 – 29 April 1905), known previously as '''Sir Edmund Beckett, 5th Baronet''' and '''Edmund Beckett Denison''', was a "lawyer, mechanician and controversialist"&lt;ref name=Dict /&gt; as well as a noted [[horology|horologist]] and architect.

==Biography==
Beckett was born at [[Carlton-in-Lindrick|Carlton]] Hall [[Nottinghamshire]], England, and was the eldest son of [[Sir Edmund Beckett, 4th Baronet]], MP for the [[West Riding of Yorkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|West Riding of Yorkshire]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

He was educated at [[Hall Cross Academy|Doncaster Grammar School for Boys]] (briefly), then [[Eton College|Eton]], and went on to read mathematics at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he graduated in the 1838 Tripos with the rank of "30th [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Wrangler]]".&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

[[File:Lord Grimthorpe Vanity Fair 2 February 1889.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;"[[Big Ben|Bells]]"&lt;br&gt;Baron Grimthorpe as caricatured by Spy ([[Leslie Ward]]) in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], February 1889&lt;/center&gt;]]
Beckett began practising law in 1841 at Lincoln's Inn. He was made a [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1854, retiring in 1881.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;  He was elected to the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1866.  He was elected to the presidency of the [[British Horological Institute]] in 1868, a position he accepted on the condition that he should not be asked to attend dinners.&lt;ref name=Ferriday/&gt; He was re-elected annually until his death.&lt;ref name=Dict /&gt;  In 1877 he was appointed [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|Chancellor]] and [[Vicar general|Vicar-General]] of the [[Diocese of York]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;  He was created [[Baron Grimthorpe]] in 1886. He is sometimes known as Edmund Beckett Denison; his father had taken the additional name Denison in 1816, but the son dropped it on his father's death in 1874. He married Fanny Catherine (23 February 1823 – 8 December 1901), daughter of [[John Lonsdale]], 89th [[Bishop of Lichfield]].

In 1851, he designed the mechanism for the clock of the [[Palace of Westminster]] (the Houses of Parliament in London), responsible for the chimes of [[Big Ben]].

In 1868 he worked with [[William Henry Crossland|W. H. Crossland]] to design [[St Chad's Church, Far Headingley]] in [[Leeds]] on land given by his family.

He was also responsible throughout the 1880s and 1890s for rebuilding the west front, roof, and [[transept]] windows of [[St Albans Cathedral]] at his own expense. Although the building had been in need of repair (and indeed considerable work had already been done since 1856 under the guidance of Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]] until his death in 1878, including making the central tower safe, correcting the listing of the south side of the nave, and reconstructing [[St Alban]]'s shrine), popular opinion at the time held that he had changed the cathedral's character, even inspiring the creation and temporary popularity of the verb "to grimthorpe", meaning to carry out [[Victorian restoration|unsympathetic restorations]] of ancient buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.victorianweb.org/art/architecture/churches/stalbans2.html | quote=While the verb "to Grimthorpe" entered the English language of the time as a pejorative term for such insensitive "restoration," ... | accessdate=2008-01-18 | title=St Albans Cathedral and Abbey Church, Hertfordshire: A Case History in Victorian Restoration | last=Benerjee | first=Jacqueline | publisher=The Victorian Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of Beckett's additions included statues of the four evangelists around the western door; the statue of [[Matthew the Evangelist|St Matthew]] has Beckett's face. He later turned his attentions to [[Church of St. Peter, St. Albans|St Peter's]] and then to [[St Michael's Church, St Albans|St Michael's]] churches, both in the same city. He lived at [[Batchwood Hall]] from where he oversaw the restoration work on the cathedral.&lt;ref name=albans&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stalbanshistory.org/page_id__202.aspx|title=Batchwood Hall|publisher=St Albans and Hertfordshire Architectural and Archaeological History Society|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on 29 April 1905 after a fall, and is buried in the grounds of [[St Albans Cathedral]].  His obituary in the ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]'' noted his mastery of ecclesiastical law, his publications (ranging from ''Astronomy without Mathematics'' to ''Clocks, Watches, and Bells'' (1903)  to ''Building, Civil and Ecclesiastical'') and noted "there was not a better locksmith in England."&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Palomo became famous across Mexico and [[Latin America]] after his 1993 characterization of ''Juan del Diablo'' in ''[[Corazón salvaje (1993 telenovela)|Corazón salvaje]]''.

He was determined not to play in any other telenovelas after [[Ramona (2000 TV series)|Ramona]] (co-starring [[Kate del Castillo]]), but the sequel to ''Corazón Salvaje'' was something he could not refuse.  He was working on  an L.A. production of the play ''Una Pareja Con Ángel'' (written by Eduardo and successfully produced in Mexico) when he died.

Palomo was in the process of ''crossing-over'' to United States [[television]] audiences where he guest starred on shows such as "[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]" and "Kingpin" and was to star in a [[CBS]] series. His last movie was ''[[A Day Without a Mexican]]''.

'''Eleanor of Aragon''' (20 February 1358 – 13 August 1382) was a daughter of King [[Peter IV of Aragon]] and his wife [[Eleanor of Sicily]]. She was a member of the [[House of Aragon]] and [[Queen consort of Castile|Queen of Castile]] by her marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lundy|2003|p=11340 §113398}} cites {{harvnb|Louda|MacLagan|1999|loc=table 46}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Eleanor was the youngest child and only daughter of her father by his third marriage. Eleanor was a sister of [[John I of Aragon]] and [[Martin of Aragon]]. She was a half-sister of [[Constance of Aragon, Queen of Sicily|Constance, Queen of Sicily]], [[Joanna of Aragon, Countess of Ampurias|Joanna, Countess of Ampurias]] and [[Isabella of Aragon (1380–1424)|Isabella, Countess of Urgell]].

On the death of Eleanor's mother in 1375, her father married [[Sibila of Fortia]], who had been Eleanor of Sicily's lady-in-waiting. This caused disagreements between King Peter and his children especially John.&lt;ref&gt;{{MLCC |warning=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/ARAGON%20&amp;%20CATALONIA.htm#JuanIdied1396 |title-date= |title= ARAGON, Medieval Lands|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleanor's maternal grandparents were [[Peter II of Sicily]] and his wife [[Elisabeth of Carinthia]], granddaughter of [[Henry V, Duke of Legnica]] and [[Elisabeth of Kalisz]]. Eleanor's paternal grandparents were [[Alfonso IV of Aragon]] and his first wife [[Teresa d'Entença]].

== Marriage ==
At [[Soria]] on the 18 June 1375, Eleanor married [[John I of Castile]]. Her marriage was arranged as part of the arrangements for peace between [[Aragon]] and [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] agreed at [[Almazán]] on the 12 April 1374 and at [[Lérida]] on the 10 May 1375.&lt;ref&gt;{{MLCC |warning=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/ARAGON%20&amp;%20CATALONIA.htm#Leonordied1382MJuanCastilla |title-date= |title= Medieval Lands|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleanor and John were married for seven years, in which time they had three children:
#[[Henry III of Castile|Henry]] (4 October 1379 – 25 December 1406), succeeded his father as [[King of Castile]].
#[[Ferdinand I of Aragon|Ferdinand]] (27 November 1380 – 2 April 1416), became [[King of Aragon]] in 1412.
#Eleanor (b. 13 August 1382), died young

After seven years of marriage on 13 August 1382, Eleanor died giving birth to her daughter and namesake Eleanor, who died young. Eleanor's son Ferdinand later claimed his mother's rights on the Kingdom of Aragon when both of Eleanor's brothers died without surviving sons.

In ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (franchise)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', {{nihongo|'''Evangelions'''|エヴァンゲリオン|Evangerion}} (also referred to as '''Evas''' or '''EVAs''') are the fictional [[cyborgs]] piloted by the [[List of characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion#Children|Children]] chosen by the Marduk Institute (a [[front company]] of Seele). The Evas were created by [[NERV (Neon Genesis Evangelion)|Nerv]]. Their principal purpose is to defend Tokyo-3 from the [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)|Angel]]s. The visuals of the Evas were designed by [[Ikuto Yamashita]] and series director [[Hideaki Anno]], who also created their stories.

==Characteristics==
[[Image:EVA01 in Tokyo.jpg|thumb|200px|Unit 01 runs through Tokyo-3.]]
The Evas were designed similarly to the Japanese folklore creature [[Oni (folklore)|Oni]].&lt;ref&gt;Hideaki Anno {{cite journal|last=Wong|first=Amos|date=January 1996|title=Interview with Hideaki Anno, director of 'Neon Genesis Evangelion'|journal=Aerial Magazine|url=http://www.aoianime.hu/evangelion/index.php?page=interanno|accessdate=2007-05-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613125248/http://www.aoianime.hu/evangelion/index.php?page=interanno|archivedate=2007-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they were originally assumed to be giant [[humanoid]] robots, the Evas are actually [[cyborg]]s, integrating a mostly biological being with a substantial mechanical infrastructure, including a capsule inserted into the spine called an "entry plug" in which the pilot sits and controls the Eva's actions, though the extent of this control can waver. The only people who can pilot Evas are children whose mothers have died after the Second Impact, who are chosen by the Marduk Institute and designated in numeral order as "children" (i.e. First Child, Second Child). The reason of this is not explained for some time, until it is revealed that the souls of the pilots' mothers are integrated with the Evas to enable a psychic link between the two. Once connected to the Eva, the entry plug is filled with a translucent, breathable liquid known as LCL, which allows the pilots to electrochemically control the Evas. LCL is repeatedly described as smelling like blood and is revealed later on to be derived from the blood of the second Angel, [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Lilith|Lilith]]. The pilots wear uniforms called plug suits and devices called interface headsets on their heads to achieve better synchronization with the Eva. Although the Evas wear armor, their most significant defense is the Absolute Terror Field (AT Field for short), a form of force field which protects the Eva from all forms of conventional damage and can be used to disrupt an Angel's AT field.

All the Evangelions but one are derived from the first Angel, [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Adam|Adam]] (in the [[Book of Genesis]], [[Eve]] is created from one of [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]]'s ribs). Unit 01 is unique in having been born from the second Angel, [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Lilith|Lilith]]. With these revelations, the true purpose of their armor is also revealed - it is actually to constrain and control their movements. Based on production sketches from ''Evangelion 1.0 Complete Records Collection'', the Evas are 75 meters tall; this presumably applies to the humanoid angels as well.&lt;ref&gt;Evangelion 1.0: You Are (Not) Alone Complete Records Collection (ヱヴァンゲリヲン新劇場版：序 全記録全集){{ISBN|978-4-903713-17-5}}, Published May 2008, Retrieved March 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

To power their massive frames, they use internal [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], an umbilical cable, or an S² engine. Auxiliary batteries can be attached to extend an Eva's unplugged endurance. The Evas are controlled through their psychic link to the pilot via a combination of hand controls in the entry plug and direct nerve impulses that link to the pilot's plug suit and interface headset. The pilot's link with the Eva is expressed in a "synchronization ratio". The higher the synchronization, the greater the command over the Eva. A high synchronization permits direct feedback, including the ability for a pilot to directly experience pain induced by any damage against the Eva. This is the reason why the pilots often undergo routine synchronization tests, in order to measure how well the pilots are able to synchronize with the souls that are bonded within the Evas. The Evas can also be controlled by an autopilot system, the Dummy Plugs, which are based on the thought patterns of either [[Rei Ayanami]] or [[Kaworu Nagisa]]. Evas can also lose control in certain circumstances and go "berserk", such as when the pilot is under extreme stress.

The Evas fight with their arms and legs, but they can also wield and use a wide variety of giant conventional weapons. Additionally, each Eva has a retractable bladed weapon known as a "Progressive Knife" in their shoulder blade.

==Prototype Units==

==={{anchor|EVApre00}}Failed Units===
Nerv made numerous failed attempts to create a working Eva. The remains of these failed Evas are hidden in one of the lowest levels of Nerv headquarters. Most of these failed Evas' organic structures have rotted away, leaving little more than an armored head connected to a spine, often with an incomplete number of limbs and many of the skeletons are badly warped. They have the word "reject" painted on their heads in large red letters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071010034858/http://www.evacommentary.org/images_production/groundwork_23_C300_oa.gif Eva graveyard] (accessed via the [[Internet Archive]]) Concept sketch of Evangelion "graveyard", taken from one of the [http://www.animebooks.com/evangelion.html Groundwork of Evangelion artbooks]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the original version, the failed Eva prototypes were laid out on a massive empty floor, with what remained of their limbs carefully matched up with their spines and other body parts, and then circled by chalk marks. The New Production Cut shows the original concept with remaining body parts of dozens of failed Evas are thrown into a series of waste pits in the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071007133858/http://www.evacommentary.org/episode-23/23_C300_npc_comp.jpg The "new" Eva graveyard] (accessed via the [[Internet Archive]]) The Evangelion graveyard, as depicted in the "Director's Cut" version of episode 23&lt;/ref&gt; Some Eva rejects can also be seen in ''[[The End of Evangelion]]'', suspended vertically by the heads.

==={{anchor|EVASIM}}&lt;!-- inbound links --&gt;Simulation bodies===
Three incomplete Evangelion units are kept in the Pribnow Box in Nerv headquarters. They are unarmored, have no legs or cores, and have numerous cables exiting the neck instead of actual heads.&lt;ref&gt;See here [https://web.archive.org/web/20071202123431/http://www.evacommentary.org/images_production/groundwork_13_C073.gif] and here [https://web.archive.org/web/20071006092547/http://www.evacommentary.org/images_production/groundwork_13_C022.gif] for production sketches (taken from the [[Internet Archive]]) of the simulation bodies.&lt;/ref&gt; These units are used as training simulators and are eventually infected by the eleventh Angel, [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Ireul|Ireul]].&lt;ref name="ADV"&gt;[http://www.advfilms.com/titles/evangelion/ ADV Evangelion site] Official ADV site for ''Neon Genesis Evangelion''; Eva images and information are under the Artwork section (requires [[Adobe Flash]])  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630193917/http://www.advfilms.com/titles/evangelion/ |date=June 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--This page is archived under Wayback Internet Archive, but the pages are a useless blue screen. It looks like the abode flash media is no longer working--&gt;

''Rebuild of Evangelion 1.0'' reveals that the firing range training simulator uses a simulation body, as opposed to the anime or manga which show Unit 01 directly attached to simulation equipment. This simulation body appears to be an apparatus that consists of portions of the skeleton and nervous system of an Evangelion, but without any means of actual movement except for two small devices on the front of the head.

=== {{anchor|EVA00}}EVA Unit 00 ===
{{nihongo|Unit 00|零号機|Zerogōki}},&lt;ref name="ADV"/&gt; is the Prototype, the first successful Evangelion, and is piloted by the First Child, Rei Ayanami. The head design is similar to that of the previous failed attempts, with a single round optic in the center. Unit 00 is the only one of the original Evas that is never seen without its armor (Unit 02 was revealed in ''End of Evangelion'', and Unit 01 on multiple occasions) or opening its mouth; thus the appearance of its organic body is unknown.

Unit 00 was initially colored yellow like the previous prototypes, but its armor was damaged beyond repair by the Angel [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Ramiel|Ramiel]] and has since been refitted with blue armor plating in addition to other alterations made in order to make it more suitable for combat conditions, including shoulder pylons similar in appearance to the ones on Units 01 and 02. Because it is a prototype, Unit 00 cannot be fitted with D-type equipment. Unit 00 is also equipped with retro rockets as shown in the fight against [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Matarael|Matarael]]. The true nature of the soul inside Unit 00 is never specified, but it is implied to be directly connected to Rei in some fashion. Popular theories include the soul of Rei I, or Naoko Akagi. Unit 00 was destroyed when Rei self-destructed the Eva in order to destroy the sixteenth Angel, [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Armisael|Armisael]].

In the [[Rebuild of Evangelion]] series, Unit 00 design stays with its initial yellow color along with more white and gray. In the second film, Unit 00 was the Eva SEELE recommended be placed in storage upon the arrival of Unit 03, as the Vatican treaty states that no country can have more than three active Evangelion units at one time but Gendo Ikari chose to place Unit 02 in storage instead. After Unit 00 fails to destroy the 10th Angel with the N² Missile, the Angel absorbs the unit and uses its identification code to disable Central Dogma's defenses.

==={{anchor|EVA01}}EVA Unit 01===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
{{nihongo|Unit 01|初号機|Shogōki}} was created in the Third Annex of Gehirn's Artificial Evolution Laboratory in [[Hakone]] and is piloted by Shinji Ikari (with Dummy Plug as backup pilots). It is the first and the only Evangelion to be created from Lilith, the Second Angel, instead of Adam, the First Angel, from whom all the other Evangelions were created. Concept art for the TV series reveals that Unit 01's body was grown from biomass cultivated from Lilith's legs (the reason why her legs are missing throughout the show). Despite this fact, Unit 01 bears no real morphological difference from the other Evangelion units, possessing a core (unlike Lilith) and exaggerated proportions similar to Adam and the other Evas. Unit 01's armor is primarily purple; some components are colored neon green, light blue, orange, and black. Its helmet bears the signature unicorn-like single horn, and a 'frill', giving an appearance reminiscent of a ceratopsian dinosaur. The horn and the glowing eyes also gives the Evangelion a rather demonic appearance. It also has a distinctive chest plate resembling pectoral muscles, as opposed to the regular V-shaped chest plate the other Evangelions have. The humanoid entity beneath the armor has light brown skin, two emerald-green eyes, four small nostrils positioned, flat white teeth resembling that of humans, and red blood. It has the best battle record of all the Evangelions. It is a notorious berserker, and frequently acts independently, without the instructions of a pilot and without any apparent power source, moving freely even when the internal power source was depleted. The Eva will also take action to protect its pilot while sometimes servicing other interests. The Eva's resident soul, [[Yui Ikari]] (Shinji's mother), appears to be responsible for such events, in an attempt to protect her son. In such berserk incidents, the Eva goes into a 'battle rage', characterized by inhuman savageness and animal-like behavior. In the height of its berserk state, Unit 01 also demonstrates angelic abilities such as regeneration (repairing its damaged arm in a matter of seconds in battle against Sachiel and Zeruel), forming angelic cross shaped energy explosions, as well as manifesting a powerful AT Field for offensive purposes. It is the only Eva to have gone berserk in direct combat, inflicting fatal damage to Sachiel before it self-detonates, ripping apart Leliel and savagely mauling Zeruel. Shinji is clearly not responsible for these events, having blacked out in the first two berserk episodes and having dissolved into LCL after reaching a synchronization level of 400% during the battle with Zeruel. A similar state of battle rage, displaying heightened physical power and savageness, can be achieved when the Eva is controlled by the Dummy System, though this does not qualify as a genuine berserk incident. Unit 01 is called the "Test Type", in reference to its unusual method of creation.

Upon savagely disfiguring the fourteenth angel, [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Zeruel|Zeruel]], Unit 01 used one of Zeruel's arms to regenerate its severed left arm and proceeded to devour the Angel and absorb its S² Engine (which seemed to be used only at Unit 01's discretion, as the Eva was afterwards still shown to be sent into battle with an umbilical cable). By acquiring an S² Engine (the biblical Fruit of Life), it is stated that the Eva has become a being equal to God, possessing both the Fruit of Life and Knowledge.

In ''The End of Evangelion'', Unit 01 goes berserk for the final time, destroying the Nerv HQ building with a cross-shaped energy blast and growing enormous orange 'Wings of Light' (also appearing in the TV series opening and similar to Adam's seen during Second Impact). From then on the resident soul of Yui Ikari seems to be in complete control of the Eva. SEELE attempts to use the Eva in order to perform the Human instrumentality project in place of Lilith, who has been rendered unusable due to the loss of the Spear of Longinus. The mass production Evangelions impale Unit 01 with spears similar to the Spear of Longinus, possibly in an attempt to open the Doors of Guf on the Eva's palms. Later, Unit 01 and the MP Evas 'open' their S² Engines, forming a giant Sephirot in the sky, signaling the beginning of the Third Impact and creating an enormous explosion which completely exposes the Geofront's true form as the Black Moon, the Egg of Lilith. The original Spear of Longinus returns to Earth, merging with Unit 01 to form the 'Tree of Life', becoming a complete God with the power either save or destroy humanity. The Tree of Life is later absorbed by Lilith-Adam-Rei during Instrumentality. Near the end of the film, Eva 01 bursts out from the giant pupil of Lilith-Adam-Rei, roaring, and grows a complete set of twelve Wings of Light, then manipulates the Spear of Longinus to destroy the clone spears. At the conclusion, Unit 01 is left floating adrift in space, fossilized and still containing the soul of Yui Ikari, an eternal testament to the existence of humanity.

In the [[Rebuild of Evangelion]] series, Unit 01 sports more neon green highlights on the head, chest, abdomen and arms. The progressive knife and its storage mechanism are also redesigned, but most of the armor has not changed. During its fight with Shamshel, the skin of the humanoid entity beneath the armor is revealed to a lighter color than in the series. During its battle with Zeruel, the Eva enters the 'awakened state' and undergoes several radical changes: the pilot's plug depth exceeds a value of 180, the 'Great Beyond Depth', at the risk of being unable to return to normal. While appearing to have gone berserk, the pilot still appears to retain full control over the Eva's actions. In addition, its neon green highlights turn glowing red along with the Eva's eyes. Most significant however is Unit 01's possession of Angelic abilities, including the manifestation of a halo, advanced AT-field manipulation to replace its lost arm with an ethereal one that can launch concussive blasts and the ability to release a powerful energy beam from its eyes, similar to the one used by the Angels but with much more devastating effects.

After defeating Zeruel, the Unit 01 undergoes several more changes, growing energy wings from its core and gaining the ability to bridge the entry plug to the Angel's core. After absorbing Zeruel's core, Unit 01 undergoes a transformation into a glowing energy being, as a divine entity equal to God, a 'radiant giant' with 'wings of light' extending upwards into a vortex at the center of multi-colored concentric circles (confirmed in 3.0 as the Doors of Guf), similar to the Adams seen during Second Impact. The mere existence of the awakened Eva-01 triggers a phenomenon confirmed in ''Evangelion 3.0'' to have been (Near) Third Impact. It also seems that the Eva's awakening triggered by Rei and Shinji appears to have been planned from the beginning by Gendo, Shinji's father. While the Impact is aborted by Kaworu Nagisa in the Mark.06 impaling Unit 01 with the Spear of Cassius, it still results in the devastation of the entire planet, prompting the UN to seal Unit 01 into a tesseract they subsequently launch into space where it remains for the next fourteen years.

At the beginning of ''Evangelion 3.0'', the tesseract is stolen by WILLE, that subsequently use the Evangelion as an energy source to power their flying battleship, the AAA ''Wunder''. The unit remains inside the ''Wunder'' for the rest of the film, not making its appearance.

==Production Model Units==
Production Model Eva Units have varying numbers of eyes. Unit 02 has four, Units 03 and 04 have two, and Units 05 through 13 have no visible eyes.

==={{anchor|EVA02}}EVA Unit 02===
{{nihongo|Unit 02|弐号機|Nigōki}},&lt;ref name="ADV"/&gt; built by Nerv Germany, is the first Production Model Eva. It is piloted by [[Asuka Langley Soryu]] and is the first Evangelion built specifically for combat. Unlike Unit 01, it only goes ''truly'' "berserk" once, just before its destruction. It has achieved an unusually high sync ratio with its pilot(s). The Eva's armor is primarily red with yellow and white on the arms and head. As a result of being constructed by Nerv Germany, and also as an accommodation for its three-quarters-[[German people|German]] pilot, its default language setting is [[German language|German]]. It is known to contain the maternal part of the soul of [[List of characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion#Kyoko Zeppelin Soryu|Asuka's mother]]. Unit 02 features a different progressive knife from earlier Eva units as well as an internal weapon rack in the right shoulder binder which fires dart-like weapons. In the new movie continuity, it used a row of spikes from its shoulder extension in the battle against [[Zeruel]]. It has dark blue skin and four orange eyes, first seen when the [[#Mass Production (MP) Evangelions (Units 05 - 13)|MP Evas]] tear it apart during The End of Evangelion. These eyes are normally hidden by its head armor, with four green optical sensors handling vision. Its head armor is hinged in two places, allowing the eyes to be exposed when the Eva reaches a high synch ratio.

Unit 02 is damaged and incapacitated several times over the course of the series, and is finally destroyed in ''The End of Evangelion'' by the mass-produced Evas. Asuka was still highly synchronized with Unit 02 as it was destroyed, thus practically suffering every wound (the frames after the faux-Lance of Longinus is plunged just above the Eva's left eye show her bleeding profusely from her eye, a rapidly spreading bloodstain on her lower torso when the Eva is literally gutted, and then her arm splitting in synch with the Eva's as the faux-Lances are thrown into her).
In the manga, Kaworu Nagisa piloted Unit 02 against [[Armisael]] since Asuka was left comatose after the battle with [[Arael]]. The weapon he used in the battle was a double-bladed chainsaw. Armisael partially merged with Unit 02 while it was still fusing with Unit 00 and Rei.

In the second Rebuild film, it is shown that Unit 02's helmet is redesigned to have what look like [[Oni (folklore)|oni]] horns, and that its shoulder pylons are equipped with a pair of bladed weapons. It also sports more white in several places on its body. Of note, the Eva is able to open its mouth in Rebuild, which was not the case with the original. However, it seems to have lost the capability to partially 'open' its helmet to expose its organic eyes. Later in the film, Unit 02 is placed into storage in accordance with The Vatican Treaty- a law stating that no nation can have more than 3 Active Evas- and with Unit 03 arriving from America Gendo decided Unit 02 would be the mothballed Unit. Mari later hijacks Unit 02 to fight Zeruel, and in desperation, activates Unit 02's Beast Mode which significantly increases its combat ability and gives it a more feral appearance. However, Mari is unable to defeat the Angel and Unit 02 is severely damaged, losing its left arm and part of its head.

Unit 02 is featured prominently throughout Evangelion 3.0, appearing to be only partially repaired from the damage it sustained during the last film, being called Unit 02'(Dash) by Misato at the beginning. At the beginning of the film, Unit 02 is one of the two Evas that participate in the operation to hijack an inactive Unit 01 from [[low Earth orbit]], with Unit 02's equipment consisting of a harpoon gun, a pair of massive rocket boosters several times larger than the Eva itself and a cocoon-like pair of ablative heat shields to withstand atmospheric reentry; the boosters are seen to utilize [[vernier thrusters]] but their primary function is to provide a ten-second deorbit burn and are thus unusable for combat maneuvers. In the middle of Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo, it is modified into Unit-02'γ. Near the end of the film, Asuka is forced to engage "Mode 777 (Triple Seven)" Beast Mode against Mark 09, giving it an even more animalistic appearance resembling a [[saber-toothed cat]]. However, Unit 02 is later self-destructed to defeat Mark 09.

==={{anchor|EVA03}}EVA Unit 03===
{{nihongo|Unit 03|参号機|Sangōki}} was built in the United States by Nerv First Branch in Massachusetts, United States, Evangelion Unit 03&lt;ref name="ADV"/&gt; is one of two Units built with the Second Production Model design. It is the brother Unit of Unit 04 (Unit 3 and Unit 4 were the only Evangelion who were addressed as males during the series). The United States government insisted on having the rights to build Unit 03 and Unit 04. A few minor changes were made between the first and second Production Models. Unit 03's color was unique, with much darker plates than any other Eva.

The pilot assigned to it was [[Toji Suzuhara]], but in transit to Japan, it was possessed by the thirteenth Angel, [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Bardiel|Bardiel]], which appeared from cloud, infecting it with fungus-like growths. As Bardiel, it was savagely torn apart by Unit 01, after the control of Unit 01 was switched from Shinji to the Dummy Plug system, designed to simulate an artificial pilot on the basis of Rei Ayanami's thought patterns. Toji, the pilot, is severely injured in the anime, but in the manga he dies.

Unit-03 is also shown in ''Evangelion 2.0: You Can (Not) Advance'', with [[Asuka Langley Soryu|Asuka Langley Shikinami]] as the test pilot. She was put into quarantine due to possible contact with Bardiel and was confirmed to have been placed in a medically induced coma due to her injuries when the entry plug was crushed. In the teaser trailer for Evangelion 3.0 attached at the end of the 2nd Rebuild film, she is shown awoken from her coma with an eye patch covering her left eye.

Unit 03 sports a predominantly black color scheme with white and red highlights and during its fight with Unit 01, it grows a separate pair of arms out of the top of its shoulders to help strangle Unit 01. Both the original and the ''Rebuild'' version of the Eva have grey eyes, as evidenced by freeze-frame play of their destruction.

==={{anchor|EVA04}}EVA Unit 04===
While EVA {{nihongo|Unit 04|四号機|Yongōki}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.absoluteanime.com/eva/unit_04.htm Unit 04] Information and image&lt;/ref&gt; never actually appears in the series, it still serves a function in the story. Unit 04 was constructed at the Second Branch of Nerv, a desert site in [[Nevada]], United States, acting primarily as a test subject for S² Engine (provided by the Third Branch of Germany) experimentation. Unit 04 was destroyed along with the entire Second Branch and all facilities within an 89&amp;nbsp;km radius. The cause of the accident remains unknown. Nerv determined that the incident occurred when the S² Engine was being installed in the unit, and that there were numerous factors that could have led to the accident. The very nature of the destruction itself is unknown as well. One theory behind Unit 04's destruction, suggested by [[Ritsuko Akagi]], is that the S² Engine had opened up a [[Dirac sea]] similar to the one that was believed to comprise the twelfth Angel, [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Leliel|Leliel]]. Unit 04's design is virtually identical to that of Unit 03. According to [[Gainax]] material, this unit is silver in color, with black and red detail. While Unit 04 does not appear on-screen in the series, it does make appearances in the continuities of various ''Evangelion'' spin-offs and games. The pilot of Eva 04 is never specified in the series. In some spin-offs, Unit 04 is piloted by Kensuke Aida.

*In an official ''Evangelion'' [[pachinko]] machine in Japan (based specifically on the 2008 film "''[[Evangelion 1.0|Evangelion 1.0: You Are (Not) Alone]]''"), once you reach a certain level, there is a short animation featuring Unit-04.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} The scene shows the [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Ramiel|6th Angel Ramiel]] during an attack on Tokyo-3 (the footage is spliced in from the film). When it destroys some missile launching sites, Unit-04 suddenly appears floating over a hill, with [[Kaworu Nagisa#Rebuild of Evangelion|Kaworu Nagisa]] controlling it by floating in front of its head. Ramiel fires, but Kaworu's AT Field protects Unit-04. The EVA then charges forward with the Lance of Longinus. Ramiel reshapes itself and fires again, but Unit-04 blocks the attack with a scaled-up [[riot shield]] (previously seen only in merchandise, never-onscreen because of its impracticality in favor of AT Fields). After Ramiel stops its attack, Unit-04 hurls the Lance of Longinus at the Angel, which penetrates its own Field, and destroys it in this single shot. Kaworu and Unit-04 are seen casually standing on top of a lake at the end of the video.
**This video seems to be the only known officially licensed appearance of Evangelion Unit-04, but does confirm, in a way, that its appearance is based on Evangelion Unit-03, and that its coloring is silver with black and red.  (This video also establishes Unit-04 in the coloring scheme of the ''Rebuild'' films, and shares similar decorations.)

==={{anchor|EVAMP}}&lt;!-- inbound links --&gt;Mass Production EVAs===
These Evas appear in ''The End of Evangelion'' and were produced at seven different Nerv branches around the world, probably [[Germany]] (Third Branch), the [[United States]] (First Branch, Massachusetts), [[Japan]] ([[Matsushiro]]), the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Russia]], and [[China]]. Units 05 and 06 were made in Germany; Unit 08 was produced in China. Seele had them produced as part of their backup plan for initiating Instrumentality, but only nine out of an envisioned twelve were completed. They are controlled directly by Seele via Dummy Plugs based on Kaworu Nagisa. In dialogue, they are referred to as the {{nihongo|Eva Series|エヴァシリーズ|Evashirīzu}}.

Their physical build is different from previous Evas, being narrower in the chest and shoulders and wider in the hips, and apparently covered by the same reinforced plastic that coats the arms. The long jaws have red muscular lips, metal-plated teeth, a large grey tongue, and produce large quantities of saliva. They have no apparent eyes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evacommentary.org/images_production/ryousanki_design.gif MP Evas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202123427/http://www.evacommentary.org/images_production/ryousanki_design.gif |date=2007-12-02 }} Concept sketch of the mass-production Evas; taken from NEWTYPE 100% COLLECTION: NEON GENESIS EVANGELION''. 1997 Kadokawashoten. {{ISBN|4-04-852700-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their heads overall have a similar shape to that of a whale. They are equipped with large, mechanical, avian-style wings that enable them to fly, and which can be fully retracted into the back. They also lack the shoulder-mounted armor "blades" which were characteristic of previous Evas. Their primary weapons are double-bladed Heavy Lances, which eventually transform into their true form, dark gray replicas of the Lance of Longinus. Additionally, the MP Evas consistently behave in an animal-like manner; they show formidable savagery, and circle Unit 02 in the air in a manner similar to [[vulture]]s before descending to fight the Eva and tear it apart.

Each MP Eva contains an internal S² Engine, which grants them complete mobility (being freed from the umbilical cable) and no operational time limit.

In the alternate universe game ''[[Girlfriend of Steel 2]]'', Kaworu Nagisa pilots Eva Unit 05, which is otherwise the same as the Mass Production units, except that the Dummy Plug is replaced by a standard entry plug.

=={{anchor|OPU}}Other==
According to Misato, Unit 05 and Unit 06 were originally planned to be more or less a continuation of the production model design used for Units 02-04. However, when Seele began construction of the mass production model Eva Units 05-13, these plans were scrapped. The unfinished original Units 05 and 06 were scrapped for spare parts used to repair Units 00 and 02 after their fight with the Angel Zeruel. Various different EVA units have originated in spin-off games and other various media.

In the Battle Orchestra game two new EVA units are introduced. EVA {{nihongo|Unit-Alpha|甲号機|Kōgōki}} is a green colored EVA with distance-controlled gun barrels mounted on its shoulders (possibly inspired by the Psycommu System from the [[Gundam]] franchise), its pilot is unknown. EVA {{nihongo|Unit-Beta|乙号機|Otsugōki}}, piloted by Kaworu Nagisa, is gold in color with wings and a [[katana]]. EVA Unit 04 appears as well, painted a different shade of silver and piloted by Kensuke Aida.

==Units appearing in Rebuild of Evangelion==

==={{anchor|EVA05}}EVA Provisional Unit 05===
The EVA {{nihongo|Provisional Unit 05|仮設五号機|Kasetsu Gogōki}}, piloted by Mari Illustrious Makinami, features in the opening of [[Evangelion: 2.0|the second film]] in the ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]'' tetralogy and is held at the joint U.S./Russian Nerv Bethany Base. Unit-05 is designated as ''local specifications unit'' and less humanoid than the other Evas with a design that includes having shorter left and right arms that end in a pincer and a lance respectively, and instead of legs has four limbs that end in wheel like mechanisms. The Eva's torso is predominantly white with orange and gray areas; its limbs are a shade of green. Because of the inhuman design of the Eva, special tubes are attached to the wrists of the pilot's plug suit to help aid in movement and the pilot wears a helmet-like contraption. Rocket boosters and drills also feature in the design to help aid this speedy Eva once in action. It appears to lack an umbilical cord and gathers its energy from pantograph-like wires atop the shoulder pylons, which connect to the roofs of the tunnels of Bethany Base in Evangelion 2.0. The odd build is most likely due to its provisional status as moving on various terrains might be difficult. The Eva is solely sent into action against the previously released Third Angel which attempts to escape. The melee results in the destruction of the Angel, Unit 05 and Bethany base. Its designation as "Provisional" may be a reference to the EVA being launched despite Bethany base still waiting on several components for installation.

==={{anchor|EVA06}}EVA Mark.06===
Introduced in Rebuild of Evangelion, {{nihongo|Mark.06|マークシックス|Mākushikkusu}} is first seen at the end of the first film and fully appears in the second film. It was initially designed with blue armor with a glowing red visor covering its eyes and head design similar to Unit 01. Underneath its armor, the Eva unit has dark gray skin decorated on the torso with a seven-eyed purple face mask that is partially covered by a gray and red mask engraved with the words "Project Evangelion". In the 1.01 DVD release, Mark.06 has a glowing white halo. The narration states that it and its pilot "come down from the [[Moon]]". It is of SEELE's design who describe it as "the true Evangelion"; Gendo and Fuyutsuki had no hand in its creation.

In Evangelion 2.0, the unit's coloration is dark blue with gold highlights. It is piloted by [[Kaworu Nagisa]]. At the end of the film, Kaworu uses Mark.06 to throw a spear through Unit 01 (neutralizing it and stopping Third Impact) and descend from the Moon, after that declaring that he will make Shinji happy.

The unit briefly appears in Evangelion 3.0 where it is seen inactive and impaled in Terminal Dogma alongside Lilith. It was later revealed to have the Twelfth Angel sealed within it. This is the first Unit in the franchise that doesn't use the official Japanese naming convention for Evangelions (number + ''gōki'') but instead has an English designation phonetically transcribed into Japanese.

==={{anchor|EVA08}}EVA Unit 08===
First appeared in ''Evangelion 3.0'', Evangelion {{nihongo|Unit 08|八号機|Hachigōki}} is piloted by Mari Illustrious Makinami. The Unit seems similar to previous units, but the shoulder pylons are slightly different, and it appears to have thrusters on it. The head design is similar to the helmet of a suit of armor, with a protruding horn. Unlike its first depiction in the first teaser for the film, the Eva went through a significant redesign between films: while the teaser showed it having dark gray armor and a vaguely anchor-shaped pink visor, the final version - designated Unit-08α - has pink armor and a total of eight green eyes. Then partly through the movie, Unit-08α is modified by WILLE into Unit-08β, unlike Unit-08α, is not shaped like a typical production model. It is bulkier in hips, shoulders, and most notably in the torso. The plating on the chest, abdomen, and legs is far bulkier as well, and does not match the thin, sleek plating seen on most Evangelion units. Unlike Unit-08α, it also has large, pink guards around its forearms and wrists which add significantly to the bulk of the arms. Its coloring is largely the same, the most notable difference being that the pink portions of the shoulder pylons on Unit-08α are now white, as well as the arm colors being switched to a different order. At the beginning of the film, the Eva participates in the operation to hijack an inactive Unit 01 from low Earth orbit alongside Unit 02 but fails to achieve the required [[orbital speed]], commencing atmospheric reentry after only a few minutes of spaceflight. While in suborbital flight, the Eva is armed with a cannon that appears to be an energy weapon similar in function to a sniper rifle. It is also armed with rocket boosters and a cocoon-like pair of ablative heat shields identical to Unit 02's.

==={{anchor|EVA09}}EVA Mark 09===
First appeared in ''Evangelion 3.0'', Mark 09 is piloted by a Rei Ayanami clone. It has orange and white armor and a cyclopean head with a single red eye, closely resembling Unit 00. It is first seen in the operation where NERV kidnaps Shinji from WILLE, with the EVA losing its head during the skirmish. The missing head is not restored and near the end of the film the still headless Eva reappears, wielding a massive [[scythe]] to hold back Unit 02 and Unit 08 on its own. At the end of the film, it attempts to hijack control of the ''Wunder'' battleship with a number of luminescent blue organic tendrils sprouting from its legs, causing both the EVA's entry plug and the ''Wunder''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s bridge to turn black and display a large number of SEELE logos. The EVA also grows a new head closely resembling the ''Wunder''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s primary bridge while its armor changes to black. Even without a head, the EVA is capable of utilizing a ranged energy attack like many of the Angels. When the EVA is attacked by Unit-02γ, it is revealed that the entire EVA is made up of core material at this point, making all attacks that fail to destroy the entire body at once useless. It is finally destroyed by Unit-02γ's self-destruct. During various scenes, the EVA is specifically referred to as "Adams' [sic] Vessel" by multiple characters, along with a confirmation that the EVA used to be the ''Wunder''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s "former master" and that it is attempting to take control "back" from Unit 01.

==={{anchor|EVA13}}EVA Unit 13===
First appeared in ''Evangelion 3.0'', {{nihongo|Unit 13|第13号機|Dai Jū-san-gōki}} has an appearance near-identical to that of Unit 01, excluding having four eyes and arms. Its most distinctive feature is the Double Entry system of two entry plugs, with the two pilots capable of seeing each other as if they were in a single plug; either pilot is capable of controlling the EVA on their own, although both of them working in tandem is preferred. Unusually, the EVA does not appear to have an AT-field, instead using a number of remote-controlled drones called RS Hoppers to protect itself; these drones are each capable of deploying their own AT-field, can fly without any apparent means of propulsion and explode violently when damaged. Without these drones, the EVA does not appear to have any offensive weaponry but is immune to progressive blades and specialized anti-AT ammunition fired by Unit 08 fails to affect it whatsoever. The unit itself is also referred to as an "Adams" [sic], although the precise meaning of that term is left unclear. At the end of the film, Unit 13 is piloted by Shinji Ikari and Kaworu Nagisa who proceed to remove the two Spears of Longinus from Lilith, setting in motion a chain of events that cause the EVA to enter an "awakened" or "pseudo-evolved" form where it spontaneously emits light, sprouts a pair of wing-like protrusions from its shoulders and manifests a pair of concentric halos that allow it to fly at high speeds. In this state, the EVA proceeds to start Fourth Impact on its own before Kaworu commits suicide and Mari ejects Shinji's entry plug, making the EVA dormant once more. There is no umbilical cable socket on the EVA's back and it is unclear what power source it uses, if at all.

==={{anchor|EVA8+2}}EVA Unit 8+2===
Briefly mentioned in the first teaser for ''Evangelion FINAL'', {{nihongo|Unit 8+2|8+2号機|Hachi Tasu Nigōki}} appears to have a red and pink color scheme and is seen battling a large number of EVAs with a sword resembling the Magorox, an unused progressive sword design created by Ikuto Yamashita lead mecha designer for the original series and subsequently recycled in extended canon works. No further information about this EVA is known yet.

Since Evangelion 3.0's preview in the previous movie barely had any scene that actually made into the final product, it may as well be a [[red herring]].

===Mass Production EVAs===
A large number of these Units appear in the first teaser for ''Evangelion FINAL'', battling Unit 8+2. They have an identical head design to the Mark.06 but with dark green, almost gray armor. They are armed with Pallet Rifles, an Evangelion-sized [[bullpup]] [[assault rifle]] visually resembling a [[Steyr ACR]] and which used to be the standard-issue rifle for Evangelions in the original series but did not appear in Rebuild up to this point. Unlike the rifles in the series, these ones also have progressive knives crudely affixed onto them as a makeshift bayonet.

During ''Evangelion 3.0'', a large number of Evangelion hands with these Units' color scheme and a pile of Pallet Rifles were briefly seen inside the ruined Nerv headquarters, implying the existence of an assembly line of sorts for these EVAs. No further information is known yet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3944">In [[scientific research]], an '''experimental system'''  is the physical, technical and procedural basis for an [[experiment]] or series of experiments.  Historian of science [[Hans-Jörg Rheinberger]] defines an experimental system as: "A basic unit of experimental activity combining local, technical, instrumental, institutional, social, and [[Epistemology|epistemic]] aspects."&lt;ref&gt;Rheinberger, ''Toward a History of Epistemic Things'', p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Scientists]] (particularly laboratory biologists) and [[historians]] and [[philosophers]] of [[biology]] have pointed to the development and spread of successful experimental systems, such as those based on popular [[model organism]] or scientific apparatus, as key elements in the history of science, particularly since the early 20th century.  The choice of an appropriate experimental system is often seen as critical for a scientist's long-term success, as experimental systems can be very productive for some kinds of questions and less productive for others, acquiring a sort of momentum that takes research in unpredicted directions.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinberger, ''Toward a History of Epistemic Things'', pp. 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful experimental system must be stable and reproducible enough for scientists to make sense of the system's behavior, but variable and unpredictable enough that it can produce useful results.  In many cases, a well-understood experimental system can be "[[black-boxed]]" as a standard technique, which can then be a component of other experimental systems.  Rheinberger divides experimental systems into two parts: the part under investigation ("epistemic things") and the well-understood part that provides a stable context for experimentation ("technical objects").&lt;ref&gt;Rheinberger, ''Toward a History of Epistemic Things'', pp. 24-31. Note that the translation from German language introduces an ambiguity, or a possible misunderstanding. The meaning of ''Experimentalsystem'', referring to a system that is the site for experiments, whereas an ''experimentelles System'' is a system that is unfinished and under experimental investigation. Rheinberger uses the former term.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of experimental systems in biology often requires the "[[domestication]]" of a particular organism for the laboratory environment, including the creation of relatively homogeneous lines or [[Strain (biology)|strains]] and the tailoring of conditions to highlight the variable aspects that scientists are interested in.&lt;ref&gt;See Kohler, ''Lords of the Fly''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientific technologies, similarly, often require the development of a full experimental system to go from a viable concept to a technique that works in practice on a usefully consistent basis.  For example, the invention of the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) is generally attributed to [[Kary Mullis]], who came up with the concept in 1983, but the process of development of PCR into the revolutionary technology it became by the early 1990s took years of work by others at [[Cetus Corporation]]&amp;mdash;and the basic components of the system had been known since the 1960s DNA synthesis work of [[Har Gobind Khorana]]&amp;mdash;making "who invented PCR?" a complicated question.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinow, ''Making PCR'', pp. 7-9&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5149">The '''extended mind thesis''' ('''EMT''') says that an agent's mind and associated cognitive processing are neither skull-bound nor even body-bound, but extend into the agent's world.&lt;ref name=WilsonR&gt;
{{cite web |author1=Wilson, Robert A.  |author2=Foglia, Lucia |title=Embodied Cognition |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/embodied-cognition/ |date=July 25, 2011}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Andy Clark|Clark]] and [[David Chalmers|Chalmers]] put it:

{{quote|Where does the mind stop and the rest of the world begin?...We propose to pursue... an ''active externalism'', based on the active role of the environment in driving cognitive processes.|Andy Clark and David Chalmers: "[[The Extended Mind]]"&lt;ref name=ChalmersD&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Andy Clark |author2=David J Chalmers |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3328150?sid=21105405194441&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3739256&amp;uid=3739824&amp;uid=4 |title=The Extended Mind |journal=Analysis |volume=58 |issue=1 |date=January 1998 |pages=7–19 |doi=10.1093/analys/58.1.7}}; reprinted as: 
{{cite book |title= The Extended Mind |chapter=Chapter 2: The extended mind |author1=Andy Clark |author2=David J Chalmers |editor=Richard Menary  |pages=27–42 |isbn= 9780262014038 |publisher=MIT Press |year=2010}}; and available on line as: {{cite web |title=The extended mind |author1=Andy Clark |author2=David J Chalmers |url=http://cogprints.org/320/1/extended.html |publisher=Cogprints}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The question is raised as to the division point between the mind and the environment. The EMT proposes that some objects in the external environment are utilized by the [[mind]] in such a way that the objects can be seen as extensions of the mind itself. Specifically, the mind is seen to encompass every level of the cognitive process, which will often include the use of environmental aids.

==Criticism==

Philosophical arguments against the extended mind thesis include the following.&lt;ref name="Adams Aizawa"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://philpapers.org/rec/ADADTB | title=Defending the bounds of cognition, in The Extended Mind (Eds, Richard Menary) |author1=Adams, Fred. |author2=Aizawa, Ken | year=2010 | pages=67–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# When focusing on cognition, the thesis confuses claims about what is constitutive about the concept of cognition with claims about causal influences on cognition (the "causal-constitutional fallacy"). For example, Adams and Aizawa (2010) write, "Question: Why did the pencil think that 2 + 2 = 4?, Clark’s Answer: Because it was coupled to the mathematician." 
# It stretches the limits of our ordinary concept of cognition too far ("cognitive bloating"), potentially implying that everything on the Internet is part of individual cognitive systems.
# It uses a coarse-grained functionalism about the mind that ignores plausible differences between internal and external processes, such as differences between beliefs and external props and devices; or for creating a notion of cognition too heterogeneous to make up a scientific natural kind.

Each of these arguments is addressed in Clark (2008), in which he notes:&lt;ref name="Supersizing"&gt;{{cite book | title=Supersizing the Mind: Embodiment, Action, and Cognitive Extension | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Clark, Andy | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# While coupling is important for cognition, that is not to say that it is sufficient – the coupling must play a functional role in cognition. Many couplings do not do so and thus would not be 'extensions' (and this is consistent with a strong extended mind thesis).
# Any putative part of a system – internal or external – is unlikely to yield "cognition" on its own. Thus, examples such as calculators, pencils, should be considered in parallel with neural regions. Simply looking at the part is not enough for cognition.
# One can imagine circumstances under which a biological being might retain information in non-neural ways (a hypothetical Martian with a bitmap-based memory, or humans with prosthetics to support memory). Thus, being neural cannot be a necessary condition for being cognitive.

While in ''Supersizing the Mind'' Clark defends a strong version of the hypothesis of [[extended cognition]] (contrasted with a hypothesis of embedded cognition) in other work, some of these objections have inspired more moderate reformulations of the extended mind thesis. Thus, the extended mind thesis may no longer depend on the parity considerations of Clark and Chalmers' original argument but, instead, emphasize the "complementarity" of internal and external elements of cognitive systems or processes. This version might be understood as emphasizing the explanatory value of the extended mind thesis for cognitive science rather than maintaining it as an ontological claim about the nature of mind or cognition.&lt;ref name="Supersizing" /&gt;

'''Friedrich Gulda''' (16 May 1930{{spaced ndash}}27 January 2000) was an Austrian pianist and composer who worked in both the classical and jazz fields.

==Biography==
Born in [[Vienna]] as the son of a teacher, Gulda began learning to play the piano from Felix Pazofsky at the [[Wiener Volkskonservatorium]], aged 7. In 1942, he entered the [[University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna|Vienna Music Academy]], where he studied piano and musical theory under Bruno Seidlhofer and [[Joseph Marx]].

During [[World War II]] as teenagers, Gulda and his friend [[Joe Zawinul]] would go out and perform forbidden musics – like jazz, in violation of the government's prohibition on the playing of such music (this is mentioned in the documentary film "Friedrich Gulda: So What – A Portrait").

Gulda won first prize at the Geneva International Music Competition in 1946. Initially, the jury preferred the Belgian pianist Lode Backx, but when the final vote was taken, Gulda was the winner. One of the jurors, [[Eileen Joyce]], who favoured Backx, stormed out and claimed the other jurors were unfairly influenced by Gulda's supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Davis, ''Eileen Joyce: A Portrait'', 126-7&lt;/ref&gt; Gulda began to play concerts worldwide. He made his [[Carnegie Hall]] debut in 1950.&lt;ref name=all /&gt; Together with [[Jörg Demus]] and [[Paul Badura-Skoda]], Gulda formed what became known as the "Viennese troika".

Although most renowned for his [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] interpretations, Gulda also performed the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]] (often on [[clavichord]]), [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]. His recordings of Bach's Well Tempered Clavier are well regarded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/29/arts/friedrich-gulda-69-classical-music-rebel.html "Friedrich Gulda, 69, Classical-Music Rebel," New York Times], 29 January 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the Well Tempered Clavier, Gulda performed very few other pieces by Bach and recorded even fewer. Gulda's later reliance on co-operating with companies whose recording techniques were primitive in comparison to those espoused by more sophisticated rivals stood him in very poor stead with regard to posterity. The rescued Mozart sonata tapes issued on DG are unbelievably bad in terms of recorded technical quality; likewise the Debussy Preludes and Bach recordings of the late 60s and early 70s.

From the 1950s on Gulda cultivated a professional interest in [[jazz]], and in [[Free improvisation]] or open music improvisations, writing songs. He also recorded as a vocalist under the pseudonym  "Albert Golowin", fooling music critics for years until it was realized that Gulda and Golowin were the same person. He played instrumental pieces, at times combining jazz, free music, and [[European classical music|classical music]] in his concerts. In the late 1960s Gulda recorded the complete Beethoven sonatas. 

In 1956, Gulda performed and recorded at [[Birdland (jazz club)|Birdland]] in New York City&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1956/06/22/archives/gulda-has-debut-as-jazz-pianist-concert-artist-opens-2week.html "Gulda has Debut as Jazz Pianist," 22 June 1956], accessed 17 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]].&lt;ref name=all /&gt; He organized the International Competition for Modern Jazz in 1966,&lt;ref name=sax /&gt; and he established the International Musikforum, a school for students who wanted to learn improvisation, in Ossiach, Austria, in 1968.&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt; He once said:&lt;ref name=reassert&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/29/arts/gulda-reasserts-his-claims-to-fame.html K. Robert Schwarz , "Gulda Reasserts his Claim to Fame," 25 September 1989], accessed 17 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There can be no guarantee that I will become a great jazz musician, but at least I shall know that I am doing the right thing. I don't want to fall into the routine of the modern concert pianist's life, nor do I want to ride the cheap triumphs of the Baroque bandwagon.}}

In jazz, he found "the rhythmic drive, the risk, the absolute contrast to the pale, academic approach I had been taught."&lt;ref name=reassert /&gt; He also took up playing the [[baritone saxophone]].&lt;ref name=sax&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1966/07/17/archives/brooklyn-sax-man-wins-the-big-one-in-vienna.html "Brooklyn Sax Man Wins the Big One in Vienna," 17 July 1966], accessed 17 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, Gulda wrote a ''Prelude and Fugue'' with a theme suggesting [[Swing (genre)|swing]]. [[Keith Emerson]] liked Gulda's Fugue so much, that he often performed it in Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer concerts in the 1970s, and a studio version was also issued on [[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer|Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer's]] ''[[The Return of the Manticore]]''.

In addition, Gulda composed "Variations on The Doors' '[[Light My Fire]]'" (aka 'Variationen über "Light My Fire" (von Jim Morrison)' ) for solo piano, and released it in 1971 on Track 11 (LP disc 1, side 2, track 1) of "The Long Road To Freedom (Ein musikalisches Selbstportrat in Form eines Lehrgangs)". An earlier instrumental rock-style piano/bass/drums trio version (sans any of the complex Gulda composed and improvised variations...) of [[Light My Fire]] can also be found on Gulda's album ''[[As You Like It (Friedrich Gulda album)|As You Like It]]'' (1970), an album that also includes standards such as "[['Round Midnight (song)|'Round Midnight]]" and "[[What Is This Thing Called Love?]]", as well as Gulda's classic "Blues For H.G. (dedicated to [[Hans Georg Brunner-Schwer]])."

In the late 1960s through the 1980s – while continuing his straight ahead swing and bop-based jazz (often in European Jazz big bands, that he often organized yearly) performances and recordings, and his classical performances and recordings, he also performed and/or recorded (often using a custom electrically amplified [[clavichord]], percussion instruments, and a bass recorder wooden flute) with a wide range of musicians involved in [[Free improvisation]], including: [[Cecil Taylor]], [[Barre Phillips]], [[Ursula Anders]], [[John Surman]], [[Albert Mangelsdorff]], [[Stu Martin (drummer)|Stu Martin]], [[Gunther Rabl]], [[Limpe Fuchs]], [[Paul Fuchs]], [[Mounir Bashir]], [[Gerhard Herrmann]], [[Leszek Zadlo]], and [[Fritz Pauer]].

In the late 1970s and 1980s, Gulda was involved in yearly music festivals, such as the [[Münchner Klaviersommer]] – where musical guests coming to perform over the years with him, included [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Joe Zawinul]], and [[Chick Corea]].

In 1980, he wrote his ''Concerto for Cello and Wind Orchestra'', which has been called "as moving as it is lighthearted", in five movements "involving jazz, a minuet, rock, a smidgen of polka, a march and a cadenza with two spots where a star cellist must improvise."&lt;ref&gt;''Seattle Times'': [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/musicnightlife/2016127705_roman16.html Tom Keogh, "Cellist Joshua Roman returns to Seattle Symphony for opening night," 15 September 2011], accessed 17 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Gulda teamed up with jazz pianist [[Chick Corea]], who was between the breakup of [[Return to Forever]] and the formation of his [[Chick Corea Elektric Band|Elektric Band]]. Issued on ''The Meeting'' (Philips, 1984), Gulda and Corea communicate in lengthy improvisations mixing jazz ("[[Some Day My Prince Will Come]]" and the lesser known, adapted by [[Miles Davis]] song "Put Your Foot Out") and classical music (Brahms' [[Brahms's Lullaby|"Wiegenlied"]] ["Cradle song"]).

Gulda and Corea continued their musical relationship and recorded [[Piano Concerto No. 10 (Mozart)|Mozart's Double Piano Concerto]] with the Concertgebouw Orchestra with [[Nikolaus Harnoncourt]] (conductor). They also played jazz piano duets of Gulda's "Fantasy For Two Pianos" and Corea's "Ping Pong For Two Pianos."

In the late 1980s and 1990s, organist/MIDI keyboardist [[Barbara Dennerlein]] also studied with and performed with Gulda (Reference: DVD "I Love Mozart, I Love Barbara" [http://www.naxos.com/catalogue/item.asp?item_code=101635 ].

In the late 1990s, Gulda organised [[rave|rave parties]], where he performed with the support of several DJs and Go-Go dancers.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

These unorthodox practices along with his refusal to sometimes follow clothing conventions (he was notoriously described as resembling, in one South German concert, "a Serbian pimp") or announce the program of his concerts in advance earned him the nickname "terrorist pianist".&lt;ref name=all&gt;Chris Woodstra, Gerald Brennan, Allen Schrott, eds., ''All Music Guide to Classical Music: The Definitive Guide to Classical Music'' (San Francisco: Backbeat Books, 2005), 538&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, he cancelled a performance after officials of the [[Salzburg Festival]] objected to his including jazz musician [[Joe Zawinul]] on the program.&lt;ref name=all /&gt; When the [[Vienna Music Academy]] awarded him its Beethoven Ring in recognition of his performances, he accepted it but then later reconsidered and returned it.&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt; To promote a concert in 1999, he announced his own death in a press release so that the concert at the Vienna [[Konzerthaus, Vienna|Konzerthaus]] could serve as a resurrection party.&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt;

[[File:Friedrich gulda grab.jpg|thumb|300px|Friedrich Gulda's grave in Steinbach am Attersee]]

Phillips Records included Gulda in its [[Great Pianists of the 20th Century]] CD box set, which came out in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classicalnotes.net/columns/pianoweb.html Peter Gutmann, "Great Pianists of the Twentieth Century,"] ClassicalNotes.net&lt;/ref&gt; His piano students included [[Martha Argerich]], who called Gulda "my most important influence,"&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/25/arts/an-enigmatic-pianist-reclaims-her-stardom.html?

Gulda died of heart failure at the age of 69 on 27 January 2000 at his home in [[Steinbach am Attersee|Weissenbach]], Austria.&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/29/arts/friedrich-gulda-69-classical-music-rebel.html Allan Kozinn, "Friedrich Gulda, 69, Classical-Music Rebel," 29 January 2000], accessed 17 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Gulda is buried in the cemetery of [[Steinbach am Attersee]], Austria.

==Personal life==
Gulda was married twice, firstly to actress [[Paola Loew]] (1956&amp;ndash;1966) with whom he had two sons, David Wolfgang and Paul, and secondly to Yuko Wakiyama (1967&amp;ndash;1973) with whom he had another son, [[Rico Gulda|Rico]]. Both Paul and Rico became accomplished pianists. In 1975 Gulda began a relationship with the oratorio singer Ursula Anders which lasted until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Gulda 1930&amp;ndash;2000 [http://www.gulda.at/english/biographie/text.htm] &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 a documentary film for television was made about his life, ''So what?! – Friedrich Gulda''.&lt;ref&gt;Internet Movie Database: [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1235444/ "So what?! – Friedrich Gulda (TV 2007)"], accessed 17 September 2011; ''New York Times'': [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/420390/Friedrich-Gulda-So-What-A-Portrait/overview "Friedrich Gulda: So What – A Portrait"], accessed 17 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Love sidebar|types}}
'''Friendship''' is a relationship of mutual [[affection]] between people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford Dictionary Press |title=Definition for friend |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/friend |accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friendship is a stronger form of [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal bond]] than an association. Friendship has been studied in academic fields such as [[Communication studies|communication]], [[sociology]], [[social psychology]], [[anthropology]], and [[philosophy]]. Various academic theories of friendship have been proposed, including [[social exchange theory]], [[equity theory]], [[relational dialectics]], and [[attachment styles]].

Although there are many forms of friendship, some of which may vary from place to place, certain characteristics are present in many types of such bonds. Such characteristics include affection; [[kindness]], [[love]], [[virtue]], [[sympathy]], [[empathy]], [[honesty]], [[altruism]], [[loyalty]], mutual [[understanding]] and [[compassion]], enjoyment of each other's company, [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], and the ability to be oneself, express one's feelings to others, and make mistakes without fear of judgment from the friend.

==Developmental psychology==
===Childhood===
[[Image:Childhood friends at a carnival.jpg|thumb|Childhood friends]]
The understanding of friendship in children tends to be more heavily focused on areas such as common activities, physical proximity, and shared expectations.&lt;ref name="bremner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bremner|first1=J. Gavin|title=An Introduction to Developmental Psychology|date=May 8, 2017|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781405186520|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-YGCwAAQBAJ|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|498}}{{efn|In comparison to older respondents, who tend to describe friendship in terms of psychological rather than mostly physical aspects.&lt;ref name="bremner"/&gt;{{rp|498}}}} These friendships provide opportunity for [[Play (activity)|playing]] and practicing [[Emotional self-regulation|self-regulation]].&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|246}} Most children tend to describe friendship in terms of things like [[sharing]], and children are more likely to share with someone they consider to be a friend.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|246}}&lt;ref name="Newman, B. M. 2012"&gt;Newman, B. M. &amp; Newman, P.R. (2012). Development Through Life: A Psychosocial Approach. Stanford, CT.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elitedaily.com/life/culture/childhood-friends-most-important-friends/1063153/|title=Your Childhood Friendships Are The Best Friendships You'll Ever Have|last=|first=|date=17 Jun 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As children mature, they become less individualized and are more aware of others. They gain the ability to empathize with their friends, and enjoy playing in groups. They also experience peer rejection as they move through the middle childhood years. Establishing good friendships at a young age helps a child to be better acclimated in society later on in their life.&lt;ref name="Newman, B. M. 2012"/&gt;

Based upon the reports of teachers and mothers, 75% of preschool children had at least one friend. This figure rose to 78% through the [[fifth grade]], as measured by co-nomination as friends, and 55% had a mutual best friend.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|247}} About 15% of children were found to be chronically friendless, reporting periods without mutual friends at least six months.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|250}}

Potential benefits of friendship include the opportunity to learn about empathy and problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy-Moore|first= E. |year=2013|title= What Friends Teach Children|url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201305/what-friends-teach-children}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Coaching from parents can be useful in helping children to make friends. [[Eileen Kennedy-Moore]] describes three key ingredients of children's friendship formation: (1) openness, (2) similarity, and (3) shared fun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy-Moore|first= E. |year=2012|title= How children make friends (part 1)|url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201209/how-children-make-friends-part-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy-Moore|first= E. |year=2012|title= How children make friends (part 2)|url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201209/how-children-make-friends-part-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy-Moore|first= E. |year=2012|title= How children make friends (part 3)|url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201209/how-children-make-friends-part-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents can also help children understand social guidelines they haven't learned on their own.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, N. M. &amp; Kennedy-Moore, E. (2003). The Unwritten Rules of Friendship: Simple Strategies to Help Your Child Make Friends. New York: Little, Brown.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing from research by Robert Selman&lt;ref&gt;Selman, R. L. (1980). ''The Growth of Interpersonal Understanding: Developmental and Clinical Analyses''. Academic Press: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and others, Kennedy-Moore outlines developmental stages in children's friendship, reflecting an increasing capacity to understand others' perspectives: "I Want It My Way", "What's In It For Me?", "By the Rules", "Caring and Sharing", and "Friends Through Thick and Thin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy-Moore|first= E. |year=2012|title= Children's Growing Friendships|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201202/childrens-growing-friendships}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adolescence===
[[File:Bhutan, Friends - Flickr - babasteve.jpg|thumb|Two friends in Bhutan]]
In adolescence, friendships become "more giving, sharing, frank, supportive, and spontaneous." Adolescents tend to seek out peers who can provide such qualities in a [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocal relationship]], and to avoid peers whose problematic behavior suggest they may not be able to satisfy these needs.&lt;ref name="reisman"/&gt; Relationships begin to maintain a focus on shared values, [[loyalty]], and common interests, rather than physical concerns like proximity and access to play things that more characterize childhood.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|246}}

A study performed at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] examined over 9,000 American adolescents to determine how their engagement in problematic behavior (such as stealing, fighting, and truancy) was related to their friendships. Findings indicated that adolescents were less likely to engage in problem behavior when their friends did well in school, participated in school activities, avoided drinking, and had good [[mental health]]. The opposite was found regarding adolescents who did engage in problematic behavior. Whether adolescents were influenced by their friends to engage in problem behavior depended on how much they were exposed to those friends, and whether they and their friendship groups "fit in" at school.&lt;ref&gt;Crosnoe, R., &amp; Needham, B. (2004) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15015689 Holism, contextual variability, and the study of friendships in adolescent development]. [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by researchers from [[Purdue University]] found that friendships formed during [[Higher education|post-secondary education]] last longer than friendships formed earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, Glenn (August 7, 2007). [http://news.uns.purdue.edu/x/2007b/070807SparksFriendship.html Study shows what makes college buddies lifelong friends]. [[Purdue University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adulthood===
[[File:3 barefoot females smiling and sitting on a bench.jpg|thumb|Friendships in adulthood]]
Friendship in adulthood provides companionship, affection, as well as emotional support, and contributes positively to mental well-being and improved physical health.&lt;ref name="enc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schulz|first1=Richard|title=The Encyclopedia of Aging: Fourth Edition, 2-Volume Set|date=2006|publisher=[[Springer Publishing|Springer Publishing Company]]|isbn=9780826148445|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tgS29D0Mr4gC|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|426}}

Adults may find it particularly difficult to maintain meaningful friendships in the workplace. "The workplace can crackle with competition, so people learn to hide vulnerabilities and quirks from colleagues. Work friendships often take on a transactional feel; it is difficult to say where networking ends and real friendship begins."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Alex|title=Friends of a Certain Age: Why Is It Hard To Make Friends Over 30?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html?pagewanted=all|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 25, 2012|date=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most adults value the financial security of their jobs more than friendship with coworkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Susan|title=Workplace Friendships: Asset or Liability?|url=http://career-advice.monster.com/in-the-office/workplace-issues/workplace-friendships-asset-or-liab/article.aspx|website=[[Monster.com]]|accessdate=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of adults have an average of two close friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/8876376/Most-adults-have-only-two-close-friends.html|title=Most adults have 'only two close friends'|date=November 8, 2011|last=Willis|first=Amy|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=August 11, 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies with adults suggest that friendships and other supportive relationships do enhance self-esteem.&lt;ref name="www2.psych.purdue.edu"&gt;Berndt, T. J. (2002). [http://www2.psych.purdue.edu/~berndt/Friendship%20quality%20and%20social%20development.pdf Friendship Quality and Social Development]. American Psychological Society. [[Purdue University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Older adults===
[[Old age|Older adults]] continue to report high levels of personal satisfaction in their friendships as they age, and even as the overall number of friends tends to decline. This satisfaction is associated with an increased ability to accomplish [[activities of daily living]], as well as a reduced decline in [[Cognition|cognitive abilities]], decreased instances of hospitalization, and better outcomes related to [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]].&lt;ref name="enc"/&gt;{{rp|427}} The overall number of reported friends in later life may be mediated by increased lucidity, better speech and vision, and marital status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blieszner|first1=Rosemary|last2=Adams|first2=Rebecca G.|title=Adult Friendship|date=Jun 10, 1992|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9780803936737|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oGs5DQAAQBAJ|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53}}

As on review phrased it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Research within the past four decades has now consistently found that older adults reporting the highest levels of happiness and general well being also report strong, close ties to numerous friends.&lt;ref name="brain"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Jon F.|last2=Federowicz|first2=Molly|last3=Nussbaum|first3=Paul D.|title=Brain Health and Optimal Engagement for Older Adults|date=February 9, 2010|publisher=Editorial Aresta S.C.|isbn=9788493744007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JwxrMe5Fo6QC|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As family responsibilities and vocational pressures lessen, friendships become more important. Among the elderly, friendships can provide links to the larger community, serve as a protective factor against depression and loneliness, and compensate for potential losses in social support previously given by family members.&lt;ref name="yearbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burleson|first1=Brant R.|title=Communication Yearbook 19|date=Mar 22, 2012|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9780415873178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8mMAgAAQBAJ|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32-3}} Especially for people who cannot go out as often, interactions with friends allow for continued societal interaction. Additionally, older adults in declining health who remain in contact with friends show improved psychological well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Exploring-Lifespan-Development-3E/9780205957385.page|title=Pearson – Exploring Lifespan Development, 3/E|author=Laura E. Berk|year=2014|pages=696|isbn=9780205957385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developmental issues==

===Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder===
Children with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) may have difficulty forming and maintaining friendships, due to a limited ability to build [[social skills]] through [[observational learning]], difficulties attending to [[social cues]], and because of the social impacts of [[impulsive behavior]] and a greater tendency to engage in behavior that may be seen as disruptive by their peers.&lt;ref name="hoza"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiener|first1=Judith|last2=Schneider|first2=Barry H.|title=A multisource exploration of the friendship patterns of children with and without learning disabilities|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|date=2002|volume=30|issue=2|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11369370|pages=127–41|accessdate=26 September 2017|pmid=12002394}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 review, no treatment was identified which effectively address peer functioning in children with ADHD, and treatments which addressed other aspects of the disorder were not found to eliminate issues related to peer functioning.&lt;ref name="hoza"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoza|first1=Betsy|title=Peer Functioning in Children With ADHD|journal=''Journal of Pediatric Psychology''|date=June 7, 2007|volume=32|issue=6|pages=101–106|doi=10.1016/j.ambp.2006.04.011|pmid=17261489|pmc=2572031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autism===
Certain symptoms of [[autism spectrum]] disorders can interfere with the formation of interpersonal relations, such as a preference for routine actions, resistance to change, obsession with particular interests or rituals, and a lack of [[social skills]]. Children with autism have been found to be more likely to be close friends of one person, rather than having groups of friends. Additionally, they are more likely to be close friends of other children with some sort of a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauminger|first1=Nirit|last2=Solomon |first2=Marjorie |last3=Aviezer|first3=Anat|last4=Heung|first4=Kelly|last5=Gazit|first5=Lilach|last6=Brown|first6=John|last7=Rogers|first7=Sally J.|title=Children with Autism and Their Friends: A Multidimensional Study of Friendship in High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|date=3 January 2008|volume=36|issue=2|pages=135–150|doi=10.1007/s10802-007-9156-x|pmid=18172754}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sense of parental attachment aids in the quality of friendships in children with autism spectrum disorders; a sense of attachment with one's parents compensates for a lack of social skills that would usually inhibit friendships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauminger|first1=Nirit|last2=Solomon|first2=Marjorie|last3=Rogers|first3=Sally J.|title=Predicting Friendship Quality in Autism Spectrum Disorders and Typical Development|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|date=29 December 2009|volume=40|issue=6|pages=751–761|doi=10.1007/s10803-009-0928-8|pmid=20039110|pmc=2864904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done by Frankel et al. showed that parental intervention and instruction plays an important role in such children developing friendships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frankel|first1=Fred|last2=Myatt|first2=Robert|last3=Sugar|first3=Catherine|author3-link=Catherine Sugar|last4=Whitham|first4= Cynthia|last5=Gorospe|first5=Clarissa M.|last6=Laugeson|first6=Elizabeth|title=A Randomized Controlled Study of Parent-assisted Children's Friendship Training with Children having Autism Spectrum Disorders|journal= Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|date=8 January 2010|volume=40|issue=7|pages=827–842|doi=10.1007/s10803-009-0932-z|pmid=20058059|pmc=2890979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with parental intervention, school professionals play an important role in teaching social skills and peer interaction. Paraprofessionals, specifically one-on-one aides and classroom aides, are often placed with children with autism spectrum disorders in order to facilitate friendships and guide the child in making and maintaining substantial friendships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rossetti|first1=Zachary|first2=Deborah|last2=Goessling|title=Paraeducators' Roles in Facilitating Friendships Between Secondary Students With and Without Autism Spectrum Disorders or Developmental Disabilities|journal=Teaching Exceptional Children|date=July–August 2010|volume=42|series=6|pages=64–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although lessons and training may help peers of children with autism, bullying is still a major concern in social situations. According to Anahad O'Connor of ''[[The New York Times]]'', bullying is most likely to occur against children with [[autism spectrum disorder]]s who have the most potential to live independently. Such children are more at risk because they have as many of the rituals and lack of social skills as children with full autism, but they are more likely to be [[Mainstreaming (education)|mainstreamed]] in school, since they are on the higher-functioning end of the autism spectrum. Children with autism have more difficulty attending to [[social cue]]s, and so may not always recognize when they are being bullied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Connor|first=Anahad|title=School Bullies Prey on Children With Autism|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/03/school-bullies-prey-on-children-with-autism/|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Down syndrome===
Children with [[Down syndrome]] have increased difficulty forming friendships. They experience a [[language delay]] causing them to have a harder time playing with other children. Most children with Down syndrome may prefer to watch other students and play ''alongside'' a friend but not ''with'' them, mostly because they understand more than they can outwardly express. In preschool years, children with Down syndrome can benefit from the classroom setting, surrounded by other children and less dependent on adult aid. Children with this disability benefit from a variety of interactions with both adults and children. At school, ensuring an inclusive environment in the classroom can be difficult, but proximity to close friends can be crucial for social development.&lt;ref&gt;"Recreation &amp; Friendship."

==Health==
Studies have found that strong social supports improve a persons's prospects for good health and longevity. Conversely, loneliness and a lack of social supports have been linked to an increased risk of [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]], viral [[infection]]s, and [[cancer]], as well as higher mortality rates overall. Two researchers have even termed friendship networks a "behavioral [[vaccine]]" that boosts both physical and mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Friendship, social support, and health. 2007 Sias, Patricia M; Bartoo, Heidi. In L'Abate, Luciano. ''Low-cost approaches to promote physical and mental health: Theory, research, and practice''. (pp. 455–472). xxii, 526 pp. New York, NY, US: Springer Science + Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is a large body of research linking friendship and health, but the precise reasons for the connection remain unclear. Most of the studies in this area are large [[Prospective cohort study|prospective studies]] that follow people over time, and while there may be a [[Correlation does not imply causation|correlation]] between the two variables (friendship and health status), researchers still do not know if there is a cause and effect relationship, such as the notion that good friendships actually improve health. A number of theories have attempted to explain this link. These theories have included that good friends encourage their friends to lead more healthy lifestyles; that good friends encourage their friends to seek help and access services when needed; that good friends enhance their friends' coping skills in dealing with illness and other health problems; and that good friends actually affect physiological pathways that are protective of health.&lt;ref&gt;Social networks and health: It's time for an intervention trial. 2005. Jorm, Anthony F. Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health. Vol 59(7) Jul 2005, 537–538.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health===
The lack of friendship has been found to play a role in increasing risk of [[suicidal ideation]] among female adolescents, including having more friends who were not themselves friends with one another. However, no similar effect was observed for males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Friendships play key role in suicidal thoughts of girls, but not boys|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2004-01/osu-fpk010604.php|website=EurekAlert!|publisher=[[Ohio State University]]|accessdate=26 September 2017|date=January 6, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bearman|first1=Peter S.|last2=Moody|first2=James|title=Suicide and Friendships Among American Adolescents|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=January 1, 2004|volume=94|issue=1|pages=89–95|doi=10.2105/AJPH.94.1.89|pmid=14713704|pmc=1449832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having few or no friends is a major indicator in the diagnosis of a range of [[mental disorders]].&lt;ref name="reisman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reisman|first1=John M.|title=Friendship and its Implications for Mental Health or Social Competence|journal=The Journal of Early Adolescence|date=September 1, 1985|volume=5|issue=3|pages=383–91|doi=10.1177/0272431685053010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher friendship quality directly contributes to self-esteem, self-confidence, and social development.&lt;ref name="www2.psych.purdue.edu"/&gt; A [[World Database of Happiness|World Happiness Database]] study found that people with close friendships are happier, although the absolute number of friends did not increase happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23097143 | work=BBC News | title=Can we make ourselves happier? | date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;Other studies have suggested that children who have friendships of a high quality may be protected against the development of certain disorders, such as anxiety and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brendgen | first1 = M. | last2 = Vitaro | first2 = F. | last3 = Bukowski | first3 = W.

==Dissolution==
The dissolution of a friendship may be viewed as a personal rejection, or may be the result of natural changes over time, as friends grow more distant both physically and emotionally. The disruption of friendships has been associated with increased [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[anger]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and may be highly stressful events, especially in childhood. However, potential negative effects can be mitigated if the dissolution of a friendship is replaced with another close relationship.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|248}}

==Demographics==
Friends tend to be more similar to one another in terms of age, gender, behavior, [[substance abuse]], personal disposition, and academic performance.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|248}}&lt;ref name="enc"/&gt;{{rp|426}}&lt;ref name="brain"/&gt;{{rp|55–6}} In [[Multiculturalism|ethnically diverse]] countries, there is broad evidence that children and adolescents tend to form friendships with others of the same race or ethnicity, beginning in [[preschool]], and peaking in middle or late childhood.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zelazo|first1=Philip David|title=The Oxford Handbook of Developmental Psychology, Vol. 2: Self and Other|date=Mar 14, 2013|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=9780199958474|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5m_D4NYVRI8C|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|264}}

===Gender differences===
In general, female-female friendship interactions among children tend to be more focused on interpersonal connections and [[social support|mutual support]], while male-male interaction tends to be more focused on [[social status]], and may actively discourage the expression of emotional needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Margaret|title=Developmental Psychology: A Student's Handbook|date=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781841691923|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7yLl11fWXr8C|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|320-2}} Females report more anxiety, jealousy, and relational victimization and less stability related to their friendships, and males report higher levels of physical victimization. Although males and females tend to report comparative levels of satisfaction with their friendships.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|249–50}}

Among older adults, women tend to be more socially adept than their male peers, and many older men may rely upon a female companion, such as a spouse, in order to compensate for their comparative lack of social skills.&lt;ref name="brain"/&gt;{{rp|55}}

==In animals==
{{see also|Ethology|Altruism in animals|Sociobiology}}
[[File:CUTE FRIENDSHIP.JPG|thumb|A man with a squirrel]]
Friendship is also found among animals of higher intelligence, such as higher [[mammal]]s and some [[bird]]s. Cross-species friendships are common between humans and [[domestic animal]]s. Cross-species friendships may also occur between two non-human animals, such as [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s. Research by McLennan measured the heart rates of [[cattle]], and showed that the cows were more stressed when alone or with an unfamiliar cow than they were with friends, lending support to the idea that cows are social animals, capable of forming close bonds with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heifer so lonely: How cows have best friends and get stressed when they are separated|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2011124/Cows-best-friends-stressed-separated.html|accessdate=19 March 2012|newspaper=Mail Online|date=5 July 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GenoCAD''' is one of the earliest [[computer assisted design]] tools for [[synthetic biology]].&lt;ref name="High-level"/&gt; The software is a bioinformatics tool developed and maintained by [http://www.genofab.com GenoFAB]. GenoCAD facilitates the design of protein expression vectors, artificial gene networks and other genetic constructs for [[genetic engineering]] and is based on the theory of [[formal languages]].&lt;ref name="orig"/&gt; GenoCAD can be used online at [http://www.genocad.com www.genocad.com].

==History==
GenoCAD originated as an offshoot of an attempt to formalize functional constraints of genetic constructs using the theory of [[formal languages]]. In 2007, the website genocad.org (now retired) was set up as a proof of concept by researchers at [[Virginia Bioinformatics Institute]], [[Virginia Tech]]. Using the website, users could design genes by repeatedly replacing high-level genetic constructs with lower level genetic constructs, and eventually with actual [[DNA]] sequences.&lt;ref name="orig"/&gt;

On August 31, 2009, the [[National Science Foundation]] granted a three-year $1,421,725 grant to Dr. Jean Peccoud, an associate professor at the [[Virginia Bioinformatics Institute]] at [[Virginia Tech]], for the development of GenoCAD.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; GenoCAD was and continues to be developed by GenoFAB, a company founded by Peccoud (currently [[Chief science officer|CSO]] and acting [[CEO]]), who was also one of the authors of the originating study.&lt;ref name="orig"/&gt;

Source code for GenoCAD was originally released on [[Sourceforge]] in December 2009.&lt;ref name=commit&gt;{{cite web|title=GenoCAD Code|url=http://sourceforge.net/p/genocad/code/commit_browser|work=Sourceforge|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GenoCAD version 2.0 was released in November 2011 and included the ability to simulate the behavior of the designed genetic code. This feature was a result of a collaboration with the team behind [[COPASI]].&lt;ref name="release notes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson |first=Mandy |title=GenoCAD Release Notes |url=http://peccoud.vbi.vt.edu/genocad-release-notes/ |work=Peccoud Lab |accessdate=8 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013161353/http://peccoud.vbi.vt.edu/genocad-release-notes/ |archivedate=13 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, 2015, Peccoud and colleagues published a library of biological parts, called GenoLIB, that can be incorporated into the GenoCAD platform.&lt;ref&gt;

==Features==
The main features of GenoCAD can be organized into three main categories.&lt;ref name="A step-by-step"&gt;

[[File:GenoCAD workflow.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Workflow of GenoCAD]]
 
* '''Management of genetic sequences''': The purpose of this group of features is to help users identify, within large collections of genetic parts, the parts needed for a project and to organize them in project-specific libraries.
** ''Genetic parts'': Parts have a unique identifier, a name and a more general description. They also have a [[DNA sequence]]. Parts are associated with a [[formal grammar|grammar]] and assigned to a parts category such a [[promoter (biology)|promoter]], [[gene]], etc.
** ''Parts libraries'': Collections of parts are organized in libraries. In some cases part libraries correspond to parts imported from a single source such as another [[sequence database]]. In other cases, libraries correspond to the parts used for a particular design project. Parts can be moved from one library to another through a temporary storage area called the cart (analogous to e-commerce shopping carts).
** ''Searching parts'': Users can search the parts database using the [[Lucene]] search engine. Basic and advanced search modes are available. Users can develop complex queries and save them for future reuse.
** ''Importing/Exporting parts'': Parts can be imported and exported individually or as entire libraries using standard file formats (e.g., [[tab delimited]], [[FASTA]], [[SBML]]).
* '''Combining sequences into genetic constructs''': The purpose of this group of features is to streamline the process of combining genetic parts into designs compliant with a specific design strategy.
** ''Point-and-click design tool'': This [[Wizard (software)|wizard]] guides the user through a series of design decisions that determine the design structure and the selection of parts included in the design.
** ''Design management'': Designs can be saved in the user [[workspace]]. Design statuses are regularly updated to warn users of the consequences of editing parts on previously saved designs.
** ''Exporting designs'': Designs can be exported using standard file formats (e.g., [[GenBank]], [[tab delimited]], [[FASTA]]).
** ''Design safety'': Designs are protected from some types of errors by forcing the user to follow the appropriate design strategy. 
** ''Simulation'': Sequences designed in GenoCAD can be simulated to display chemical production in the resulting cell.&lt;ref name="Cai"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cai | first1 = Y. | last2 = Lux | first2 = M.

* '''User workspace''': Users can personalize their [[workspace]] by adding parts to the GenoCAD database, creating specialized libraries corresponding to specific design projects, and saving designs at different stages of development.

==Theoretical foundation==
GenoCAD is rooted in the theory of [[formal languages]]; in particular, the design rules describing how to combine different kinds of parts and form [[context-free grammar]]s.
&lt;ref name="orig"&gt;
{{cite journal 
|author1=Cai Y |author2=Hartnett B |author3=Gustafsson C |author4=Peccoud J. |title=A syntactic model to design and verify synthetic genetic constructs derived from standard biological parts.

|pmc=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A context free grammar can be defined by its terminals, variables, start variable and substitution rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation, Third edition|year=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Boston, MA, USA|isbn=978-1-133-18779-0|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In GenoCAD, the terminals of the grammar are sequences of [[DNA]] that perform a particular biological purpose (e.g. a [[promoter (genetics)|promoter]]). The variables are less homogeneous: they can represent longer sequences that have multiple functions or can represent a section of DNA that can contain one of multiple different sequences of DNA but perform the same function (e.g. a variable represents the set of promoters). GenoCAD includes built in substitution rules to ensure that the DNA sequence is biologically viable. Users can also define their own sets of rules for other purposes.

Designing a sequence of DNA in GenoCAD is much like creating a derivation in a context free grammar. The user starts with the start variable and repeatedly selects a variable and a substitution for it until only terminals are left.&lt;ref name="orig"/&gt;

'''HMS ''C21''''' was one of 38 [[British C-class submarine|C-class submarine]]s built for the [[Royal Navy]] in the first decade of the 20th century.

==Design and description==
The C-class boats of the 1907–08 and subsequent Naval Programmes were modified to improve their speed, both above and below the surface. The submarine had a length of {{convert|142|ft|3|in|m|1}} [[length overall|overall]], a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|13|ft|7|in|m|1}} and a mean [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|11|ft|6|in|m|1}}. They [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|290|LT|t}} on the surface and {{convert|320|LT|t}} submerged. The C-class submarines had a crew of two officers and fourteen [[naval rating|ratings]].&lt;ref name=gg9&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

For surface running, the boats were powered by a single 12-cylinder&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Chapter 25&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|600|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[Vickers]] [[petrol engine]] that drove one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged the propeller was driven by a {{convert|300|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]].&lt;ref name=gg9/&gt; They could reach {{convert|13|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|8|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the C class had a range of {{convert|910|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn}}.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Chapters 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The boats were armed with two [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch (45&amp;nbsp;cm)]] [[torpedo tube]]s in the bow. They could carry a pair of reload torpedoes, but generally did not as they would have to remove an equal weight of fuel in compensation.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Chapter 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
HMS ''C29'' was built by [[Vickers]], [[Barrow-in-Furness|Barrow]]. She was laid down on 4 June 1908 and was commissioned on 17 September 1909. The boat sank a [[merchant ship]] while patrolling the [[Gulf of Riga]] in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]].

''C29'' was involved in the use of the [[U-boat]] trap tactic. The tactic was to use a decoy trawler to tow a [[submarine]]. When a U-boat was sighted, the tow line and communication line was slipped and the submarine would attack the U-boat. The tactic was partly successful, but was abandoned after the loss of two C-class submarines. In both cases, all the crew were lost. ''C29'' was one of the two C-class submarines sunk while attempting to employ the tactic; she was [[Naval mine|mined]] when her trawler ''Ariadne'' strayed into a minefield in the [[Humber Estuary]] on 29 August 1915.&lt;ref name=britsubs&gt;{{cite book|last=Kemp|first=Paul J.|title=British Submarines of World War One|year=1990|publisher=Arms and Armour Press|location=London|isbn=9781854090102|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure at left holds the severed head of the figure at right, who spouts blood in the form of serpents from his neck]]
During the [[pre-Columbian era]], '''human sacrifice in Maya culture''' was the ritual offering of nourishment to the [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|gods]]. Blood was viewed as a potent source of nourishment for the Maya deities, and the [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrifice]] of a living creature was a powerful [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|blood offering]]. By extension, the sacrifice of a human life was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in [[human sacrifice]]. Generally only high status prisoners of [[Maya warfare|war]] were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p751"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 751.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human sacrifice among the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] is evident from at least the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Classic Era|Classic period]] (c.&amp;nbsp;AD&amp;nbsp;250–900) right through to the final stages of the [[Spanish conquest of Petén|Spanish conquest]] in the 17th century. Human sacrifice is depicted in Classic [[Ancient Maya art|Maya art]], is mentioned in Classic period [[Maya script|hieroglyphic texts]] and has been verified archaeologically by analysis of skeletal remains from the Classic and [[Mesoamerican chronology#Postclassic Era|Postclassic]] (c.&amp;nbsp;AD&amp;nbsp;900–1524) periods. Additionally, human sacrifice is described in a number of late Maya and early Spanish colonial texts, including the ''[[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid Codex]]'', the [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] epic ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', the K'iche' ''[[Título de Totonicapán]]'', the [[K'iche' language]] ''[[Rabinal Achi]]'', the ''[[Annals of the Kaqchikels]]'', the [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec]] ''[[Songs of Dzitbalche]]'' and [[Diego de Landa]]'s ''[[Relación de las cosas de Yucatán]]''.

A number of methods were employed by the Maya, the most common being decapitation and heart extraction. Additional forms of sacrifice included ritually shooting the victim with arrows, hurling sacrifices into a deep [[sinkhole]], entombing alive to accompany a noble burial, tying the sacrifice into a ball for a ritual reenactment of the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] and disembowelment.

==Methods==
A variety of methods were used by the ancient Maya to perform human sacrifice, such as:

===Decapitation===
{{Maya civilization}}
Important rituals such as the dedication of major building projects or the enthronement of a new ruler required a human sacrificial offering. The sacrifice of an enemy king was the most prized offering, and such a sacrifice involved decapitation of the captive ruler in a ritual reenactment of the decapitation of the [[Maya maize god]] by the [[Maya death gods]].&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p751"/&gt; In AD 738, the vassal king [[K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat]] of [[Quiriguá]] captured his overlord, [[Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil]] of [[Copán]] and a few days later he ritually decapitated him;&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, pp.134–35. Looper 2003, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; such royal sacrifices were often recorded in [[Maya script]] with the "ax event" [[glyph]]. The decapitation of an enemy king may have been performed as part of a ritual [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballgame]] reenacting the victory of the [[Maya Hero Twins]] over the gods of the [[Xibalba|underworld]].&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p751"/&gt;

Sacrifice by decapitation is depicted in Classic period Maya art, and sometimes took place after the victim was tortured, being variously beaten, scalped, burnt or [[Disembowelment|disembowelled]].&lt;ref name="MillerTaube9303p96"&gt;Miller and Taube 1993, 2003, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Sacrifice by decapitation is depicted on [[relief]]s at [[Chichen Itza]] in two of the [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]] (the Great Ballcourt and the Monjas Ballcourt).&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie 1991, pp. 321–322.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hero Twins myth recounted in the Popol Vuh relates how one of each pair of twins (the Hero Twins themselves and their father and uncle) was decapitated by their ballgame opponents.&lt;ref name="Gillespie91p322-323"&gt;Gillespie 1991, pp. 322–323.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heart removal===
During the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic period]] (c. 900–1524) the most common form of human sacrifice was heart extraction, influenced by the method used by the [[Aztec]]s in the [[Valley of Mexico]];&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p751"/&gt; this usually took place in the courtyard of a temple, or upon the summit of the [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramid-temple]].&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p752"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 752.&lt;/ref&gt; The sacrifice was stripped and [[Maya Blue|painted blue]], which was the colour representing sacrifice, and was made to wear a peaked headdress.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler2006p752ReadGonzalex2000p139"/&gt;

Four blue-painted attendants representing the four [[Chaac]]s of the cardinal directions stretched the sacrifice out over a convex stone that pushed the victim's chest upwards;&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler2006p752ReadGonzalex2000p139"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 752. Read and Gonzalez 2000, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; An official referred to as a ''nacom'' in [[Diego de Landa|Landa]]'s ''[[Relación de las cosas de Yucatán]]'' used a sacrificial knife made from [[flint]] to cut into the ribs just below the victim's left breast and pull out the still-beating heart.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 752. Wild 2008, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''nacom'' then passed the heart to the officiating priest, or ''chilan'', who smeared blood upon the image of the temple's deity.

Depending upon the exact ritual, sometimes the four Chaacs would throw the corpse down the pyramid steps to the courtyard below, where it would be skinned by assistant priests, except for the hands and feet. The ''chilan'' would then remove his ritual attire and dress himself in the skin of the sacrificial victim before performing a ritual dance that symbolised the rebirth of life. If it was a notably courageous warrior who had been sacrificed, then the corpse would be cut into portions and parts would be [[Cannibalism in pre-Columbian America|eaten]] by attending warriors and other bystanders. The hands and feet were given to the ''chilan'' who, if they had belonged to a war captive, wore the bones as a trophy.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p752"/&gt; Archaeological investigations indicate that heart sacrifice was practised as early as the Classic period.&lt;ref name="TieslerCucina06p493"&gt;Tiesler and Cucina 2006, p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrow sacrifice===
Some rituals involved the sacrifice being killed with bow and arrows. The sacrificial victim was stripped and painted blue and made to wear a peaked cap, in a similar manner to the preparation for heart sacrifice. The victim was bound to a stake during a ritual dance, and blood was drawn from the genitals and smeared onto the image of the presiding deity. A white symbol was painted over the victim's heart, which served as a target for the archers. The dancers then passed in front of the sacrificial victim, shooting arrows in turn at the target until the whole chest was filled with arrows. Sacrifice with bow and arrow is recorded as far back as the Classic Period (c. 250-900), and was depicted with graffiti upon the walls of [[Tikal Temple II]].&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p752"/&gt; The ''[[Songs of Dzitbalche]]'' are a collection of Yucatec Maya poems written down in the mid-18th century; two poems deal with arrow sacrifice and they are believed to be copies of poems dating to the 15th century, during the Postclassic period.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonson 1982, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; The first, called ''Little Arrow'', is a song calling upon the sacrifice to be brave and take comfort.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonson 1982, pp. 201–202.&lt;/ref&gt; The second is entitled ''Dance of the Archer'' and is a ritual dedicated to the rising sun; it includes instructions to the archer; the archer is instructed upon how to prepare his arrows and to dance three times around the sacrifice. The archer is instructed not to shoot until the second circuit, and to be careful to make sure that the sacrifice dies slowly. On the third circuit, whilst still dancing, the archer is instructed to shoot twice.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonson 1982, pp. 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar scene is described in the [[Annals of the Kaqchikels]], where an important prisoner is bound to a scaffold; the Kaqchikel warriors begin a ritual "blood dance" and proceed to shoot him full of arrows.&lt;ref name="Akkeren99p283"/&gt; In the Late Postclassic [[K'iche' language]] drama ''[[Rabinal Achi]]'', an important war captive is tied to a stake representing the mythological Maize Tree and is sacrificed by being shot with arrows; the text compares the archers to hunters and the sacrifice to game.&lt;ref&gt;van Akkeren 1999, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other methods===
Late Classic graffiti from a structure buried under Group G in Tikal depicts a sacrifice bound to a stake with his hands tied behind his head; the victim was disembowelled.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p753"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 753.&lt;/ref&gt; At the Classic period city of [[Palenque]], a woman in her twenties was entombed alive to accompany a deceased nobleman as a funerary offering.&lt;ref name="MillerTaube9303p97"&gt;Miller and Taube 1993, 2003, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Sacred Cenote]] in Chichen Itza, people were hurled into the [[cenote]] during times of drought, famine or disease. The Sacred Cenote is a naturally occurring [[sinkhole]] eroded from the local [[limestone]]; it is approximately {{convert|50|m|ft}} wide and drops {{convert|20|m|ft}} to the water surface, with the water another {{convert|20|m|ft}} deep. The sides of the cenote are sheer. Human sacrifice was practiced right up until the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]], well after the decline of the city.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p753"/&gt;

At times sacrifices were tightly bound into a ball and were bounced in a ritual reenactment of the ballgame.&lt;ref name="MillerTaube9303p97"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Maya vessel with sacrificial scene DMA 2005-26.jpg|thumb|right|Classic period Maya vessel with a scene of human sacrifice]]

===Classic period (250–900)===
Human sacrifice is depicted in Late Classic artwork and sometimes involved torture; sacrifice was generally via decapitation. At times the sacrificial victim was dressed as a deer. The intended sacrifice may have been publicly displayed and paraded before the act of sacrifice itself. Images of human sacrifice were often sculpted into the steps of [[Maya architecture]] and such stairways may have been the site of periodic sacrifice.&lt;ref name="MillerTaube9303p96"/&gt; Ritual decapitation is well attested from [[Maya script|Maya hieroglyphic texts]] throughout the Classic period.&lt;ref&gt;Schele and Freidel 1991, pp. 311–312n6.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of mass sacrifice during the Classic period has not been recovered archaeologically.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube 1993, 2003, pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological excavations at a number of sites, including [[Palenque]], [[Calakmul]] and [[Becan]], have uncovered skeletons that bear marks to the vertebrae and ribs consistent with heart extraction at the time of death using a long-bladed flint knife.&lt;ref&gt;Tiesler and Cucina 2006, pp. 493, 501, 503.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Classic period, the sacrifice of companions to accompany high-ranking burials is likely to have been widespread and performed using the heart extraction method, leaving little evidence on skeletal remains. Analysis of those remains that do bear marks suggestive of heart sacrifice indicates that during the Classic period the Maya used a method involving cutting across the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] immediately below the ribcage and cutting the heart free.&lt;ref&gt;Tiesler and Cucina 2006, p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postclassic period (900–1524)===
A Postclassic mass burial in [[Champotón, Campeche|Champotón]] in [[Campeche]], Mexico, included skeletons bearing evidence of violent blows to the sternum that have been interpreted as evidence of heart sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Tiesler and Cucina 2006, p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid Codex]], a Postclassic hieroglyphic Maya book, has an illustration of sacrifice by heart extraction, with the victim stretched over an arched stone.&lt;ref&gt;Vail et al. December 2003, p. S108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj|K'iche']] of highland Guatemala, human sacrifice was performed to the K'iche' gods. Writing at the end of the 17th century, [[Francisco Ximénez]] described the tradition that upon the temple of [[Tohil]], human sacrifices were tied before the representation of the deity, where the priest would open the victim's chest and cut out his heart.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001, pp.356-357.&lt;/ref&gt; After sacrifice, the victim's body was probably hurled down the front stairway of the temple where his head would be severed to be placed on a [[Tzompantli|skull rack]] that was located in front of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001, p.360.&lt;/ref&gt; In the K'iche' epic [[Popol Vuh]], the god Tohil demands his right to suckle from his people, as an infant to its mother, but Tohil suckled upon human blood from the chest of the sacrificial victim.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube 1993, 2003, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Popol Vuh'' also describes how the Hero Twin Hunahpu was sacrificed with both the removal of his heart and his head.&lt;ref name="Gillespie91p322-323"/&gt; Human sacrifice was probably also performed to the K'iche' mountain god [[Jacawitz]].&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001, pp. 369–370.&lt;/ref&gt; Human sacrifice is also mentioned in the K'iche' document ''[[Título de Totonicapán]]'' ("Title of Totonicapán"). A long passage describing human sacrifice is difficult to interpret but features heart and arrow sacrifice, the flaying of the victim and wearing of his skin in a manner similar to the Aztec rituals associated with their god [[Xipe Totec]], and mention of the sacrificial knife of Tohil.&lt;ref&gt;van Akkeren 1999, pp. 284–285.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Madrid Codex sacrifice scene p76.jpg|thumb|right|A section of page 76 of the Madrid Codex, depicting sacrifice by heart extraction]]
The [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] Maya, neighbours of the K'iche', also practised human sacrifice. Ample evidence of human sacrifice has been excavated at [[Iximche]], their capital. Human sacrifice is evidenced at the site by the altar upon Structure 2, of a type used in heart sacrifice, and by a cylindrical cache of skulls taken from decapitated victims accompanied by obsidian knives.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p30"&gt;Guillemin 1965, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic]] flute crafted from a child's [[femur]] was recovered from one of the temples and is also indicative of human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Guillemín 1965, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt; A sacrificial flint knife was also recovered from Structure 3,&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p30"/&gt; and a circular altar at the site is very similar to those used for so-called "[[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|gladiatorial sacrifice]]" by the Aztecs and it may have served this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Guillemín 1965, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Annals of the Kaqchikels]]'' record that around 1491 the rulers of Iximche captured the rulers of the K'iche', as well as the image of Tohil. The captured king and his co-ruler were sacrificed together with the son and grandson of the king, other noblemen and high-ranking warriors.&lt;ref&gt;Schele and Mathews 1998, 1999, pp. 295, 297.&lt;/ref&gt; The same text describes how the Kaqchikel captured a powerful lord, called Tolk'om, who was tied to a scaffold and was shot with arrows during a ritual dance.&lt;ref name="Akkeren99p283"&gt;van Akkeren 1999, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human sacrifice during the Spanish conquest (1511–1697)===
In 1511 the Spanish caravel ''Santa María de la Barca'' set sail along the Central American coast to [[Santo Domingo]] from [[Darién Province|Darien]] under the command of [[Pedro de Valdivia (captain of the Santa María de la Barca)|Pedro de Valdivia]].&lt;ref name="deDíosGonzález08p25GómezMartínJune13p56"&gt;de Díos González 2008, p. 25. Gómez Martín June 2013, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was wrecked upon a reef somewhere off [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref name="deDíosGonzález08p25GómezMartínJune13p56"/&gt; There were just twenty survivors from the wreck, including Captain Valdivia, [[Gerónimo de Aguilar]] and [[Gonzalo Guerrero]].&lt;ref&gt;de Díos González 2008, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; The survivors set themselves adrift in one of the ship's boats, with bad oars and no sail; after thirteen days during which half of the survivors died, they made landfall upon the coast of Yucatán.&lt;ref name="deDíosGonzález08p25GómezMartínJune13p56"/&gt; There they were seized by the Maya Lord Halach Uinik.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Halach Uinik is actually a title rather than a personal name, meaning "real man" and referring to the ruler of a province. Clendinnen 2003, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Valdivia was sacrificed with four of his companions, and their flesh was served at a feast. The other prisoners were fattened for killing, although Aguilar and Guerrero managed to escape.&lt;ref&gt;de Díos González 2008, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the disastrous Spanish-led assault on [[Uspantán]] in 1529, captives taken by the [[Uspantek people|Uspanteks]] were sacrificed to Exbalamquen, one of the Hero Twins.&lt;ref&gt;Lovell 2005, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1555 the [[Acala Ch'ol|Acala]] and their [[Lakandon Ch'ol|Lacandon]] allies killed the Spanish friar [[Domingo de Vico]].&lt;ref&gt;Caso Barrera and Aliphat 2007, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; De Vico, who had established a small missionary church in San Marcos (in [[Alta Verapaz]], Guatemala), had offended a local Maya ruler;&lt;ref&gt;Salazar 1620 2000, pp. 38, 52. ITMB 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; the indigenous leader shot the friar through the throat with an arrow; the angry natives then sacrificed him by cutting open his chest and extracting his heart. His corpse was then decapitated;&lt;ref&gt;Salazar 1620, 2000, p.39.&lt;/ref&gt; the natives carried off his head as a trophy, which was never recovered by the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Salazar 1620, 2000, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1620s a Spanish party received permission to visit the still independent [[Itza people|Itza]] capital at [[Nojpetén]], headed by friar Diego Delgado who was accompanied by 13 Spanish soldiers and 80 Christianised Maya guides from [[Tipu, Belize|Tipu]], now in [[Belize]]. The party was seized when they arrived at Nojpetén and sacrificed with their hearts cut out. They were then decapitated and their heads displayed on stakes around the city; Delgado was dismembered.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 774. Means 1917, pp. 79-81. Jones 1998, pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; The main Spanish party was ambushed at Sakalum in January 1624 and slaughtered. The Spanish Captain Francisco de Mirones and a Franciscan priest were sacrificed using the heart extraction method after being bound to the forked posts of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 774. Jones 1998, p. 48. Thompson 1977, 2014, loc. 857.&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the Spanish party were also sacrificed, and their bodies impaled on stakes at the village entrance.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1977, 2014, loc. 857.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1684 three [[Franciscan]] friars were killed, probably by heart sacrifice, at the [[Manche Ch'ol]] settlement of Paliac on the Caribbean coast of Belize. They included Francisco Custodio, Marcos de Muros, and an unnamed lay brother.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1988, p. 35. Bracamonte y Sosa 2001, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of additional Spanish missionaries were sacrificed at Nojpetén. In February 1696 Franciscan friar Juan de San Buenaventura and an unspecified Franciscan companion were taken to Nojpetén during a skirmish between the Yucatec Spanish and the Itza on the west shore of Lake Petén Itzá. The Itza high priest AjKin Kan Ek' later related that he had the Franciscans bound in the form of crosses and then cut out their hearts.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1998, pp. 227–228, 303.&lt;/ref&gt; About a month later a Guatemalan Spanish expedition was ambushed and slaughtered; [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars Cristóbal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas were taken across to the island of Nojpetén and were similarly bound to X-shaped crosses before having their hearts cut out.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1998, pp. 233, 479n59.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ivan Ivanovich Safronov''' ({{lang-ru|Иван Иванович Сафронов}}) (16 January 1956 &amp;ndash; 2 March 2007) was a [[Russia]]n journalist and [[columnist]] who covered [[Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|military affairs]] for the daily newspaper ''[[Kommersant]]''. He died after falling from the fifth floor of his [[Moscow]] apartment building. His apartment was on the third floor. There are speculations that he may have been killed for his critical reporting: the [[Tagansky District|Taganka District]] prosecutor's office in Moscow initiated a criminal investigation into Safronov's death, and in September 2007, officially ruled his death a suicide.&lt;ref name=closedinvest&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?docsid=803536 Prosecutors rule the case a suicide], [[Kommersant]], 12 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Safronov was born in 1956 in [[Moscow]]. In 1979, he graduated with a major in computer engineering from the Engineering Faculty at the [[Dzerzhinsky Military Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;Today, this institution is called Peter the Great's Military Academy of Strategic Missile Troops&lt;/ref&gt; He served as a military engineer in the 15th Command near [[Ussuriysk]] in the [[Russian Far East]].&lt;ref&gt;Jury Kirillov, Peter the Great's Military academy RVSN, 3 March 2003 (http://www.arvsn.mil.ru {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524062933/http://www.arvsn.mil.ru/ |date=2009-05-24 }})&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Safronov was transferred to the [[Titov Main Test and Space Systems Control Centre|Titov Space Center]] (Главный испытательный центр испытаний и управления космическими средствами) in [[Krasnoznamensk, Moscow Oblast|Krasnoznamensk]], a [[closed town]] in [[Moscow Oblast]]. In January 1993 he began working in the press-service at the [[Russian Space Troops]]. On 2 October 1997, Safronov retired from active duty and was transferred to the army reserve as a [[lieutenant colonel]]. In December 1997, he became a military columnist at the newspaper ''Kommersant'' in Moscow. In December 2002, Safronov was made a [[colonel]] in the army reserve.&lt;ref&gt;Памяти Ивана Иваныча.&amp;nbsp;— Газета.Ru, 3 March 2007 ([http://www.gazeta.ru  Gazeta]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sergey Dyupin and Yevgeny Fyodorov, Ивана Сафронова довели до смерти, in ''Kommersant'', 6 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Last reporting==
Safronov wrote about changes in the defense leadership and problems in military training as well as about defense technology and military testing failures that often went unacknowledged and unreported by the army.

In December 2006, Safronov wrote about the third consecutive launch failure of the [[Bulava (missile)|Bulava intercontinental ballistic missile]]. The military did not acknowledge the failure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2331992.ece Russian reporter dies in fall from window] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308093342/http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2331992.ece |date=2007-03-08 }}, by Vladimir Isachenkov, Associated Press, retrieved 2007-03-06.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been further allegations that Safronov disclosed classified information in his articles. FSB agents questioned him in 2006 over a story about the [[Samara, Russia|Samara]]-based [[TsSKB-Progress]], the manufacturer of the [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz rocket]]. The agents wanted to know where the columnist had unearthed some sensitive data, but once Safronov showed them the website where he got his facts, the FSB dropped its case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2007/03/05/002.html Journalist Plummets to His Death] The Moscow Times, 5 March 2007, Retrieved. 2007-03-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Safronov had returned in late February from a reporting trip to [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates]], where he covered the annual [[International Defence Exhibition|IDEX 2007]] arms exhibition's gathering of defense manufacturers. He had stated that he would check information that he had received on possible new deliveries of Russian weapons to the [[Middle East]] while at the arms exhibition in the United Arab Emirates. Safronov was interested in a possible sale of [[Sukhoi Su-30|Su-30]] fighter jets to [[Syria]] and [[S-300 (missile)|S-300V]] missiles to [[Iran]]. He had information that those deals would be concluded through a third party, in order for Moscow to avoid accusations in the West of selling weapons to pariah states. Safronov called the editorial office at ''Kommersant'' from Abu Dhabi to say that he had found confirmation of his facts. On 27 February he attended a press conference held by the head of the Federal Service of Military and Technical Cooperation Mikhail Dmitriev at [[Information Telegraph Agency of Russia|ITAR-TASS]]. There he told colleagues that he had found information that more contracts had been signed between Russia and Syria for the sale of [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29]] jets and [[SA-22|Pantsir-S1]] and [[9K720 Iskander|Iskander-E]] missiles. He added that he would not write about those deals, however, because he had been warned that doing so would cause an international scandal and the FSB would make charges against him of revealing state secrets stick. He did not say who had warned him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.com/p747802/r_530/Ivan_Safronov_arms_trading/ Ivan Safronov was killed: Prosecutor begins an investigation of "incitement to suicide"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308094124/http://www.kommersant.com/p747802/r_530/Ivan_Safronov_arms_trading/ |date=2007-03-08 }} kommersant.ru, 6 March 2007, retrieved: 2007-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
He died after falling from the fifth floor of the Moscow building where he lived. Prosecutors say suicide is the likeliest explanation for his death. Although Safronov's colleagues and neighbors are skeptical he would take his own life, arguing that he was in a good frame of mind,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=21250 Kommersant deputy editor says reporter’s death should not be politicised] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713180122/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=21250 |date=2007-07-13 }} Reporters sans frontières. 8 March 2007. Retrieved: 2007-03-08&lt;/ref&gt; many witnesses reported he had an unusually depressed state of mind several days before the incident.&lt;ref name="kommersant.ru"&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=747802 Ъ - Ивана Сафронова довели до смерти&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently discovered major health problems (Peptic Ulcer) might be also a contributing factor.&lt;ref name="kommersant.ru"/&gt;

Safronov fell out of the staircase window between the fourth and the fifth floors of his apartment building at 9 Nizhny Novgorod Street (Нижегородская улица) around 4 p.m. on 2 March. Two university students living in a nearby building saw Safronov on the ground with the window open above, and called emergency workers. Safronov was alive immediately after the fall, but at least a half-hour passed before help arrived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.html?docId=747469 Ivan Safronov] www.Kommersant.ru, retrieved: 2007-03-06&lt;/ref&gt; Safronov was lying on his stomach, and it seemed to the students that he had tried to get up on his feet. Noticing the open window on the stairway between the fourth and fifth floors and the fact that the Safronov's shoes had come off and his jacket and sweater were pulled up to his armpits, the students called for an ambulance. Their call was not accepted, however. "We cannot collect all the drunks in Moscow on Friday night," the first responders told psychology student Lena, who had witnessed the fall. She should call back if he was still there in half an hour, Kommersant reported on 6 March 2007.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930171805/http://www.kommersant.com/p747802/Ivan_Safronov_arms_trading/] During that time Safronov stopped moving altogether. The students told [[Kommersant|the daily]] that they did not see anyone near Safronov, nor anyone in the windows of the stairway or leaving through the front door. At least three of his neighbors on the fourth and fifth floors were home at the time. They did not hear any suspicious noises on the stairway.

Safronov had taken sick leave on Friday and gone to a clinic in the Arbat district. He left the clinic at 2 PM and returned home. He had bought oranges which were found scattered on the stairway along with his cap between the fourth and fifth floors. Since Safronov was tall and solidly built, it would not have been easy to throw him from the small window, which was usually left open for smokers who gathered around it. However, footprints were found on the windowsill and ledge outside the window. The snow on top of the canopy over the entrance was disturbed where he fell onto it before rolling off and onto the ground below. An autopsy revealed multiple fractures and injuries to internal organs consistent with a fall from a great height. No drugs or alcohol were found in Safronov's blood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.html?docId=747469 Иваныч погиб] Kommersant, 2007-03-05&lt;/ref&gt;

"The suicide theory has become dominant in the investigation, but all those who knew Ivan Safronov categorically reject it," ''Kommersant'' said in an article on 5 March [http://www.nysun.com/article/49888].

Ivan Safronov was buried on 7 March at the [[Khovanskoye Cemetery]], Moscow.

===Public reaction===
General [[Vladimir Sergeyevich Mikhaylov|Vladimir Mikhaylov]], Commander of the [[Russian Air Force]], expressed in a statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt; "[Safronov] was one of those people who is remembered for his bright creative talent.

'''James Arcene''' (c. 1862 – June 18, 1885) was the youngest person sentenced to death, who was subsequently executed for the crime,&lt;ref name="streib"&gt;Streib, Victor L. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3mdHAAAAMAAJ ''Death Penalty for Juveniles''.] Indiana University Press, 1987. p.72.&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United States]]. Arcene, a [[Cherokee]], was [[hanging|hanged]] by the [[Federal Government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] in [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]], for his role in a robbery and murder committed thirteen years earlier, when he was 10 years old.&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;Scott, Charles L., MD. [http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/content/full/33/4/547 "''Roper v. Simmons'': Can Juvenile Offenders be Executed?"] ''Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law''. 33:4:547-552 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

He and a Cherokee man named William Parchmeal noticed William Feigel, a Swedish national, making a purchase in a store. They followed him when he left, heading for [[Fort Gibson]], and caught up with him about two miles outside of the fort. With robbery as a motive, they shot Fiegel six times before crushing his skull with a rock. Arcene and Parchmeal then divested Fiegel's corpse of its boots and money, totalling only 25 cents (${{inflation|US|0.25|1872|r=2}} today).

Arcene was arrested and tried for the robbery and murder of his victim, but escaped and eluded capture until he was apprehended and executed at the age of 23.&lt;ref name="streib"/&gt; He and Parchmeal were ultimately brought to justice by Deputy Marshal Andrews, after the case had lain cold for more than ten years. "[[Hanging judge]]" [[Isaac Parker]] presided over the executions, which were held at [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]].

It is difficult to verify James Arcene's age with complete certainty because there are few surviving census records for Indian Territory in the 1870s and 1880s.  Primary documents confirm that, after he was captured, James Arcene claimed to have been a child in 1872 when the crime was committed. He did not revise that statement when it became clear that that status would not help him in sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times [www.nytimes.org], "Hanged on the Gallows". The New York Times. June 27, 1885.  Accessed June 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arcene's case is frequently brought up in discussions of the [[death penalty]] for children, and to a lesser degree in discussions of the unfair treatment [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] received from the United States government.&lt;ref name="scott"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/askamnesty/dp200311_4.html "Questions on the Death Penalty."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121022304/http://www.amnestyusa.org/askamnesty/dp200311_4.html |date=2008-11-21 }} ''Ask Amnesty''.

'''John Banner''' (born '''Johann Banner''', 28 January 1910&amp;nbsp;– 28 January 1973) was an [[Austrians|Austrian]]-born American film and television actor. He is best known for his role as [[Hogan's Heroes#Sergeant Schultz|Master Sergeant Schultz]] in the [[situation comedy]] ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]'' (1965&amp;ndash;1971). Schultz, constantly encountering evidence that the inmates of his [[stalag]] were planning mayhem, frequently feigned ignorance with the [[catchphrase]], "I see nothing! I hear nothing! I know nothing!" (or, more commonly as the series went on, "I know nothing, ''nothing!''").

==Early years==
Banner was born to [[Jewish]] parents in [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]]. He studied for a [[Juris Doctor|law]] degree at the [[University of Vienna]], but decided instead to become an actor.&lt;ref name=Bee&gt;{{cite news |title=Ex-Villain John Banner Turns 'Good Guy' |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1005397/john_banner_interview/? |newspaper=[[Fresno Bee]] |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |author=Charles Witbeck |page=96 |date=April 16, 1967 |accessdate=September 12, 2014}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, when he was performing with an acting troupe in [[Switzerland]], [[Adolf Hitler]] [[Anschluss|annexed Austria to Nazi Germany]]. Banner emigrated to the [[United States]], where he rapidly picked up English.

==World War II==
In 1942, he enlisted in the [[United States Army Air Force]], underwent basic training in [[Atlantic City]] and became a supply sergeant.&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt;&lt;ref name=NAT&gt;{{cite news|title=Meet John Banner, He Ate His Way to New Character |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1002563/this_is_for_banners_wikipedia_bio/? |newspaper=[[North Adams Transcript]] |author=Erskine Johnson |via=Newspapers.com |date=October 2, 1965 |page=11 |accessdate=September 12, 2014}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He even posed for a [[recruiting poster]].&lt;ref name=NAT/&gt; He served until 1945.&lt;ref name="LBI"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1002568/john_banners_obituary/?|title=Actor John Banner (Sgt.

According to fellow ''Hogan's Heroes'' actor [[Robert Clary]], "John lost a lot of his family" to [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Robert Clary a survivor in life and entertainment |author=Susan King |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 24, 2013 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/24/entertainment/la-et-mn-classic-hollywood-robert-clary20130325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banner appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] three times&amp;nbsp;— in a musical revue called ''From Vienna'', which ran for two months in 1939; and in two comic plays, ''Pastoral'', in which he had a leading role,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Pastoral,' a Comedy by Victor Wolfson: Ruth Weston and John Banner Head Cast at Henry Miller's Theater |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1002565/john_banner_starring_in_a_broadway/? |newspaper=[[Brooklyn Eagle|Brooklyn Daily Eagle]] |author=Arthur Pollock |page=10 |date=November 2, 1939 |via=Newspapers.com |accessdate=September 11, 2014}} {{Open access}} Note his photo at the bottom left of the article.&lt;/ref&gt; but which had a very brief run in November 1939; and ''The Big Two'', which also ran briefly in January 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{IBDB name|117241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, before he became fluent in English, he had to learn his lines phonetically.&lt;ref name=LBI/&gt;

===Films===
Banner appeared in over 40 [[feature film]]s. His first credited role was a German captain in ''[[Once Upon a Honeymoon]]'' (1942), starring [[Cary Grant]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]. He played a ''[[Gestapo]]'' agent in [[20th Century Fox]]'s ''[[Chetniks! The Fighting Guerrillas]]'' (1943). His [[typecasting (acting)|typecasting]] did not please him &amp;ndash; he later learnt that his family members who had remained in Vienna all perished in [[Nazi concentration camps]]{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} &amp;ndash; but it was the only work he was offered.

===From the 1950s and ''Hogan's Heroes''===
Banner made more than 70 television appearances between 1950 and 1970, including the ''[[Lone Ranger]]'' (episode "Damsels In Distress", 1950), ''[[Sky King]]'' (premiere episode "Operation Urgent", 1952), ''[[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle]]'' ("The Renegades", 1955), ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' ("The Man Who Made Dreams Come True", 1957), ''[[Father Knows Best]]'' ("Brief Holiday", 1957), ''[[Mister Ed]]'', ''[[Thriller (U.S. TV series)|Thriller]]'' (episode "Portrait Without a Face", 1961), ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'' ("Takeover", 1962), ''[[My Sister Eileen (TV series)|My Sister Eileen]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'', ''[[The Partridge Family]]'', ''[[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series)|Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea]]'' ("Hot Line", 1964), ''[[Alias Smith and Jones]]'', ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' ("The Neptune Affair", 1964), and ''[[Hazel (TV series)|Hazel]]'' ("The Investor", 1965).

In the late 1950s, a still slim Banner portrayed [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Peter Tchaikovsky]]'s supervisor on a [[Disneyland]] anthology series about the composer's life. This followed a scene with fellow ''Hogan's Heroes'' actor [[Leon Askin]] (General Burkhalter) as [[Nikolai Rubinstein]]. In 1953, he had a bit part in the [[Kirk Douglas]] movie ''[[The Juggler (film)|The Juggler]]'' as a witness of an attack on an Israeli policeman by a disturbed concentration camp survivor.

In 1954, he had a regular role as Bavarro in the children's series ''[[Rocky Jones, Space Ranger]]''. Two years later, he played a train conductor in the episode "Safe Conduct" of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', appearing with future co-star [[Werner Klemperer]] (Colonel Klink), who played a spy.  He played Nazi villains in several later films: the German town mayor in ''[[The Young Lions]]'' (1958); [[Rudolf Höss]] in ''Operation Eichmann'' (1961); and [[Gregor Strasser]] in ''[[Hitler (1962 film)|Hitler]]'' (1962).  The year before the premiere of ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]'', Banner portrayed a soldier in the World War II German "home guard" in ''[[36 Hours (1965 film)|36 Hours]]'' (1964).  Although it was a serious role in a war drama, Banner still displayed some of the affable nature that became the defining trait of the character he would create for television the following year. By coincidence, during the final moments of ''36 Hours'', John Banner's character meets up with a border guard played by [[Sig Ruman]], who had portrayed another prisoner-of-war camp chief guard named Sergeant Schulz, in the 1953 film ''[[Stalag 17]]'', starring [[William Holden]].

The comedy series ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]'', in which Banner played Sergeant Schultz, the role for which he is most often remembered, debuted on American network television in 1965. According to Banner, before he met and married his French wife Christine, he weighed {{convert|178|lb|kg}}; he claimed her good cooking was responsible for his weight gain to {{convert|260|lb|kg}}, which helped him land the part. Schultz is that of a bumbling, but ultimately lovable German guard at a World War II prisoner-of-war camp. The camp is used by the prisoners as a secret staging area for sabotage and intelligence-gathering. Schultz is forever becoming indebted to the prisoners, which they use for their ends. His main goal is to avoid trouble from his superiors, which often leads him to ignore the clandestine activities of the prisoners. (On those occasions he would often say his [[catchphrase]] "I hear nothing, I see nothing, I know nothing!" As the series went on this became simply "I know nothing. Nothing!!"). Banner was loved not only by the viewers, but also by the cast, as recalled by cast members on the ''Hogan's Heroes'' [[DVD]] commentary. The Jewish Banner defended his character, telling ''[[TV Guide]]'' in 1967, "Schultz is not a Nazi. I see Schultz as the representative of some kind of goodness in any generation." Banner appeared in almost every episode of the series, which ran for six years.

In 1968, Banner co-starred with ''Hogan's Heroes'' alumni [[Werner Klemperer]], [[Leon Askin]] and [[Bob Crane]] in the Cold War comedy ''[[The Wicked Dreams of Paula Schultz]]'', starring [[Elke Sommer]] in the title role. After ''Hogan's Heroes'' was cancelled in 1971, Banner starred as the inept gangster Uncle Latzi in a short-lived television [[situation comedy]], ''[[The Chicago Teddy Bears]]''. His last acting appearance was in the March 17, 1972, episode of ''[[The Partridge Family]]''.  He then retired to France with his Paris-born second wife.

==Death==
Less than one year after moving back to Europe, while visiting friends in Vienna, John Banner died on his 63rd birthday, following an abdominal [[hemorrhage]].&lt;ref name=LBI/&gt;&lt;ref name="Broadcasting-Feb1973"&gt;{{cite news|title=In Brief / Obit|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1973/1973-02-05-BC.pdf|work=Broadcasting|date=February 5, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his wife Christine.&lt;ref name=LBI/&gt;&lt;ref name="Broadcasting-Feb1973"/&gt;

'''Louis IV''' (September 920 / September 921&lt;ref&gt;The precise date of birth of Louis IV is unknown. The Annals of [[Flodoard]] indicate that he was fifteen in 936 and that he was born in the region of Laon-Reims.&lt;/ref&gt; – 10 September 954), called '''''d'Outremer''''' or '''''Transmarinus''''' (both meaning "from overseas"), reigned as king of [[West Francia]] from 936 to 954. A member of the [[Carolingian]] dynasty, he was the only son of king [[Charles the Simple]] and his second wife [[Eadgifu of Wessex]], daughter of King [[Edward the Elder]] of [[Kingdom of Wessex|Wessex]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald A. Bullough, ''Carolingian Renewal: Sources and Heritage'', (Manchester University Press, 1991), 286&lt;/ref&gt; His reign is mostly known thanks to the Annals of [[Flodoard]] and the later ''Historiae'' of [[Richerus]].

== Childhood ==
Louis was born in the heartlands of West Francia's Carolingian lands between [[Laon]] and [[Reims]] in 920 or 921.&lt;ref name="Hartley 2003"&gt;{{cite book | last=Hartley | first=C. | title=A Historical Dictionary of British Women | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Books Limited | series=Routledge history online | year=2003 | isbn=978-1-85743-228-2 | url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=pDtEe4FKolUC&amp;pg=PA147 | access-date=2 August 2018 | page=147 |quote=The daughter of King Edward the Elder, Eadgifu became the second wife of the beleaguered Carolingian King of West Frankia, Charles the Simple. In September 920 or 921 she gave birth to Louis, the future Louis IV, called 'd'Outremer' on ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; From his father's first marriage with [[Frederuna]] (d. 917) he had six half-sisters. He was the only male heir to the throne.

After the dethronement and capture of Charles the Simple in 923, following his defeat at the [[Battle of Soissons (923)|Battle of Soissons]], queen Eadgifu and her infant son took refuge in Wessex (for this he received the nickname of ''d'Outremer'') at the court of her father King Edward, and after Edward's death, of her brother King [[Æthelstan]]. Young Louis was raised in the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] court until his teens. During this time he enjoyed legendary stories about [[Edmund the Martyr]], [[Kingdom of East Anglia|King of East Anglia]], an ancestor of his maternal family who had heroically fought against the Vikings.&lt;ref&gt;Poly 1990, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis became the heir to the western branch of the Carolingian dynasty after the death of his captive father in 929, and in 936 was recalled from Wessex by the powerful [[Hugh the Great]], [[Marches of Neustria|Margrave of Neustria]], to succeed the [[Robertians|Robertian]] king [[Rudolph of France|Rudolph]] who had died.

Once he took the throne, Louis wanted to free himself from the tutelage of Hugh the Great, who, with his title of [[Duke of the Franks]] was the second most powerful man after the King.

In 939, the young monarch attempted to conquer [[Lotharingia]]; however, the expedition was a failure and his brother-in-law, king [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] of [[East Francia]] counterattacked and besieged the city of [[Reims]] in 940. In 945, following the death of [[William I Longsword]], [[Duke of Normandy]], Louis tried to conquer his lands, but was kidnapped by the men of Hugh the Great.

The [[Synod of Ingelheim]] in 948 allowed the excommunication of Hugh the Great and released Louis from his long tutelage. From 950 Louis gradually imposed his rule in the northeast of the kingdom, building many alliances (especially with the Counts of [[Vermandois]]) and under the protection of the [[Ottonian]] kingdom of [[East Francia]].

== Assumption of crown ==
In spring of 936 [[Hugh the Great]] sent an embassy to Wessex inviting Louis to "come and take the head of the kingdom" (Flodoard). King [[Æthelstan]], his uncle, after forcing the embassy to swear that the future king will have the homage of all his vassals, permitted him the return home with his mother Eadgifu, some bishops and faithful servants.&lt;ref&gt;Sot 1988, p. 724.&lt;/ref&gt; After a few hours of sea journey, Louis received the homage of Hugh and some Frankish nobles on the beach of [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]], who kissed his hands. Chronicler Richerus gives us an anecdote about this first encounter:

::Then the Duke hastily brought a horse decorated with the royal insignia. By the time he wanted to put the King in the saddle, the horse ran in all directions; but Louis, an agile young man, jumped suddenly, without stirrups, and tamed the animal. This pleased all those presented and caused recognition from all.&lt;ref name="Sot1988"&gt;Sot 1988, p. 727&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis and his court then began the trip to [[Laon]] where the coronation ceremony was to take place. Louis IV was crowned King by [[Artald, Archbishop of Rheims]] on Sunday, 19 June 936,&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Riche, ''The Carolingians'', Transl. Michael Idomir Allen, (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993), 256.&lt;/ref&gt; probably at the Abbey of Notre-Dame and Saint-Jean in [[Laon]],&lt;ref&gt;Michel Bur: ''La Champagne médiévale'', 2005, p. 657.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The chroniclers Aimon de Fleury recorded in his ''Gestis francorum'' that Louis IV was crowned in the Abbey of Saint-Vincent in Laon.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps at the request of the King since it was a symbolic Carolingian town and he was probably born there.

The chronicler [[Flodoard]] records the events as follows:
{|
| ''Brittones a transmarinis regionibus, Alstani regis praesidio, revertentes terram suam repetunt. Hugo comes trans mare mittit pro accersiendo ad apicem regni suscipiendum Ludowico, Karoli filio, quem rex Alstanus avunculus ipsius, accepto prius jurejurando a Francorum legatis, in Franciam cum quibusdam episcopis et aliis fidelibus suis dirigit, cui Hugo et cetero Francorum proceres obviam profecti, mox navim egresso, in ipsis littoreis harenis apud Bononiam, sese committunt, ut erant utrinque depactum. Indeque ab ipsis Laudunum deductus ac regali benedictione didatus ungitur atque coronatur a domno Artoldo archiepiscopo, praesentibus regni principibus cum episcopis xx et amplius.''&lt;ref&gt;Flodoard, ''Annales'' 936, ed. P. Lauer.&lt;/ref&gt;
| "The Bretons, returning from the lands across the sea with the support of [[Athelstan of England|King Athelstan]], came back to their country. Duke Hugh sent across the sea to summon Louis, son of Charles, to be received as king, and King Athelstan, his uncle, first taking oaths from the legates of the Franks, sent him to the Frankish kingdom with some of his bishops, and other followers. Hugh and the other nobles of the Franks went to meet him and committed themselves to him[;] immediately he disembarked on the sands of Boulogne, as had been agreed on both sides. From there he was conducted by them to [[Laon]], and, endowed with the royal benediction, he was anointed and crowned by the lord Archbishop Artold, in the presence of the chief men of his kingdom, with 20 bishops."&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Whitelock (tr.), ''English Historical Documents c. 500–1042''. 2nd ed. London, 1979. p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

During the ritual, Hugh the Great acted as squire bearing the King's arms. Almost nothing is known about the coronation ceremony of Louis IV. It seems certain that the King would wear the crown and sceptre of his predecessor. He must have promised before the bishops of France to respect the privileges of the Church. Maybe he received the ring (a religious symbol), the sword and the stick of [[Saint Remigius]] (referring to the baptism of [[Clovis I]]). Finally, the new King (perhaps like his ancestor [[Charles the Bald]]) used a blue silk coat called ''Orbis Terrarum'' with cosmic allusions (referring to the ''[[Vulgate]]'') and the purple robe with precious stones and gold incrustations also used by Odo in 888) and his own son [[Lothair of France|Lothair]] during his coronation in 954.&lt;ref&gt;Isaïa 2009, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinoteau 1992, pp. 76-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have wondered why the powerful Hugh the Great called the young Carolingian prince to throne instead of taking it himself, as his father had done fifteen years earlier. First, he had many rivals, especially [[Hugh, Duke of Burgundy]] (King Rudolph's brother) and [[Herbert II, Count of Vermandois]] who probably would have challenged his election. But above all, it seems that he was shocked by the early death of his father. Richerus explains that Hugh the Great remembered his father who had died for his "pretentions" and this was the cause of his short and turbulent reign. It was then that "the Gauls, anxious to appear free to elect their King, assembled under the leadership of Hugh to deliberate about the choice of a new King".&lt;ref name="Sot1988" /&gt; According to Richerus, Hugh the Great delivered the following speech:

::King Charles died miserably. If my father and us, we hurt your Majesty by some of our actions, we must use all our efforts to erase the trace. Although following your unanimous desire my father committed a great crime reigning, since only one had the right to rule and was alive, he deserved to be imprisoned. This, believe me, wasn't the will of God. Also I never had to take the place of my father.&lt;ref name="Sot1988" /&gt;

Hugh the Great knew that the [[Robertians|Robertian]] dynasty had not achieved much; his uncle Odo had died after a few years of reign, abandoned by the nobles. Hugh's father, Robert I, was killed during the battle of Soissons after only months of reign and his brother-in-law Rudolph couldn't stop the troubles that multiplied in the Kingdom during his reign. Finally, Hugh didn't have a legitimate male heir: his first wife Judith (daughter of Count Roger of Maine and Princess Rothilde) died in 925 after eleven years of childless union; in 926 he married Princess [[Eadhild]] of Wessex, sister of Queen Eadgifu, who also didn't bear him any children.&lt;ref&gt;Depreux 2002, pp. 136-137.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the marriage with Eadhild, actively promoted by Eadgifu, was made in order to sever an eventual dangerous link between families of Hugh and Count Heribert II of Vermandois.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Foot: ''Dynastic Strategies: The West Saxon Royal Family in Europe''. In: David Rollason, Conrad Leyser, Hannah Williams: ''England and the Continent in the Tenth Century: Studies in Honour of Wilhelm Levison (1876–1947)''. Brepols, 2010, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regency of Hugh the Great ===
Having arrived on the continent, Louis IV was a young man of fifteen, who spoke neither Latin nor [[Old French]], but probably spoke [[Old English]]. He knew nothing about his new kingdom. Hugh the Great, after negotiating with the most powerful nobles of the Kingdom – ([[William I Longsword]] of Normandy, [[Herbert II of Vermandois]] and [[Arnulf I, Count of Flanders|Arnulf of Flanders]]) – was appointed guardian of the new King.&lt;ref name="Theis1990"&gt;Theis 1990, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The young King quickly became a puppet of Hugh the Great, who had reigned ''de facto'' since the death of his father Robert in 923. Territorially, Louis IV was quite helpless since he possessed few lands around the ancient Carolingian domains ([[Compiègne]], [[Quierzy]], [[Verberie]], [[Ver-lès-Chartres]] and [[Ponthion]]), and some abbeys (Saint-Jean in Laon, Saint-Corneille in Compiègne, [[Corbie]] and [[Fleury-sur-Loire]]) and collected the revenues from the province of [[Reims]]. We know that king had the power to appoint the suffragants of the Archbishopric of Reims. During this time Laon became the centre of the small Carolingian heartland, compared with the possessions in the [[Loire Valley]] of the Robertians.&lt;ref name="Theis1990" /&gt;

Hugh the Great's power came from the extraordinary title of ''Dux Francorum'' ([[Duke of the Franks]])&lt;ref&gt;Title held by [[Charles Martel]] and [[Pepin the Short]] when they were [[Mayor of the Palace|Mayors of the Palace]] for the last Merovingian Kings.&lt;/ref&gt; that Louis IV repeatedly confirmed in 936, 943 and 954; and his rule over the [[Marches of Neustria]], where he reigned as ''princeps'' (territorial prince). This title was for the first time formalized by the Royal Chancery.&lt;ref&gt;Guillot, Sassier 2003, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theis 1990, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus the royal edicts of the second half of 936 confirm the pervasiveness of Hugh the Great: it is said that Duke of the Franks "in all but reigned over us".&lt;ref&gt;It's understood that the Duke of the Franks is now the first person in the kingdom after the king. Charter of Louis IV, n° 4, 26 December 936. Guillot, Sassier 2003, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugh also denied the rights to the principality of Burgundy that [[Hugh the Black]] thought he had acquired after the death of his brother King Rudolph.&lt;ref&gt;In fact, in the kingdom of the Franks during the 9th century, there can be only one Duke. If Hugh the Great proclaimed himself Duke of all the Franks and over all the kingdoms (Burgundy and Aquitaine included) this means that he doesn't recognize the legitimacy of Hugh the Black as Duke of Burgundy. This quarrel ended in 936-937 when the two enemies agreed to share Burgundy.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of 937 Louis IV, called by some "The King of the Duke" ({{lang|fr|le roi du duc}})&lt;ref&gt;Quote of Laurent Theis. C. Bonnet, ''Les Carolingiens (741-987),'' Paris, Colin, 2001, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; tried to halt the virtual regency of the Duke of the Franks; in the contemporary charters, Hugh the Great appears only as "Count" as if the ducal title was taken from him by the King. But Louis IV hesitated about this move, because the ducal title was already given to Hugh the Great by Charles the Simple in 914. But a serious misconduct probably took place at that time, because Louis IV removed the title from him.&lt;ref&gt;Guillot, Sassier 2003, pp. 170-171&lt;/ref&gt; For his part, Hugh the Great continued to claim to be the Duke of the Franks. In a letter from 938 the Pope called him Duke of the Franks, three years later (941) he presided a meeting in Paris during which he raised personally, in the manner of a King, his viscounts to the rank of counts. Finally, Hugh the Great had the decisive respect of the entire episcopate of France.&lt;ref name="Guillot2003"&gt;Guillot, Sassier 2003, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Difficulties during the early years, 938–945 ==
=== Louis IV and his supporters, 938–939 ===
The rivalries between the nobility appeared as the only hope for the Louis IV to free himself from the regency of Hugh the Great. In 937 Louis IV began to rely more on his Chancellor [[Artald of Reims|Artald, Archbishop of Reims]], [[Hugh the Black]] and [[William I Longsword]], all enemies of Hugh the Great. He also received the homage of other important nobles like [[Alan II, Duke of Brittany]] (who also spent part of his life in England) and [[Sunyer, Count of Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;In fact, until the 10th century, the Catalan nobles go to the royal palace in Laon to confirm privileges for their churches and ensure their loyalty to the King. And Wilfred, brother of the Count of Barcelona, received a charter from Louis IV renewing his rights in the [[Abbey of Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa]] (937).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the support for the young king was still limited, until the Pope clearly favored him after he forced the French nobles to renew their homage to the king in 942.&lt;ref name="Guillot2003" /&gt; King's power in the south was symbolic since the death of the last Count of the [[Marca Hispanica|Spanish March]] in 878.&lt;ref&gt;Theis 1990, pp. 155-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugh the Great's response to the King's alliances approximating Herbert II of Vermandois, a very present ruler in minor France:&lt;ref&gt;The minor France is the region between Loire and Meuse.&lt;/ref&gt; it possessed a tower, called château Gaillot in the city of Laon.&lt;ref&gt;Theis 1990, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the King seized the tower but Herbert II conquered the fortresses of Reims. Flodoard related the events as follows:

::But Louis, called by the archbishop Artaud returned and besieged Laon where a new citadel was built by Herbert. He undermines and overthrows many machines walls and finally took it with great difficulty.&lt;ref name="T1990b"&gt;Theis 1990, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== War over Lotharingia ===
Louis IV then looked to the [[Lotharingia]], the land of his ancestors and began attempts to conquer it. In 939 [[Gilbert, Duke of Lorraine]] rebelled against King [[Otto I]] of East Francia and offered the crown to Louis IV, who received homage of the Lotharingian aristocracy in [[Verdun]] on his way to [[Aachen]]. In 2 October 939 Gilbert drowned in [[Rhine]] while escaping from the forces of Otto I after the defeat at the [[Battle of Andernach]]. Louis IV used this opportunity to strengthen his domain over Lotharingia by marrying Giselbert's widow, [[Gerberga of Saxony]] (end 939), without the consent of her brother King Otto I. The wedding did not stop Otto I who, after alliance with Hugh the Great, Herbert II of Vermandois and William I Longsword, resumed his invasion of Lotharingia and advanced towards Reims.&lt;ref name="T1990"&gt;Theis 1990, pp. 171-172.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crisis of the royal power, 940–941 ===
In 940 the East Frankish invaders finally conquered the city of Reims, where archbishop Artald was expelled and replaced by [[Hugh of Vermandois (bishop)|Hugh of Vermandois]], younger son of Herbert II, who also seized the patrimony of Saint-Remi. About this, Flodoard wrote:

::These are the same Franks who want this King, who crossed the sea at their request, the same ones who sworn loyalty to him and lied to God and that King?&lt;ref name="T1990b" /&gt;

Flodoard also publishes at the end of his ''Annals'' the testimony of a girl from Reims (the ''Visions of Flothilde'') who predicted the expulsion of Artald from Reims. Flothilde mentioned that the saints are alarmed about the disloyalty of the nobles against the King. This testimony was widely believed, especially among the population of Reims, who believed that the internal order and peace come from the oaths of loyalty to the King, while Artald was blamed of having forsaken divine service.&lt;ref&gt;Isaïa 2009, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Christian tradition affirmed that Saint Martin attended the coronation of 936. Now the two royal patron saints, Saint Remi and Saint Denis, seem to have turned back to the King's rule. To soften the anger of the saints, in the middle of the siege of Reims by Hugh the Great and William I Longsword, Louis IV went to Saint Remi Basilica and promised to the saint to pay him a pound of silver every year.&lt;ref&gt;Isaïa 2009, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meanwhile, Hugh the Great and his vassals had sworn allegiance to Otto I, who moved to the Carolingian Palace of [[Attigny, Ardennes|Attigny]] before his unsuccessful siege of Laon. In 941 the royal army, which tried to oppose Otto's invasion, was defeated and Artald was forced to submit to the rebels. Now Louis IV was surrendered in the only property that remained in his hands: the city of Laon. Otto I believed that the power Louis IV was sufficiently diminished and proposed a reconciliation with the Duke of the Franks and the Count of Vermandois. From that point on, Otto I was the new arbitrator in the West Francia.&lt;ref name="T1990" /&gt;

=== Intervention in Normandy, 943–946 ===
On 17 December 942 [[William I Longsword]] was ambushed and killed by men of [[Arnulf I, Count of Flanders]] at [[Picquigny]] and on 23 February 943 [[Herbert II, Count of Vermandois]] died of natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;According to contemporary sources (Dudon of Saint-Quentin and Flodoard of Reims), the murder was an act of revenge of the Count of Flanders who had just lost in favor of William I the city of Montreuil because the count of the Normans had approached King Louis IV to the detriment of Arnold and his lord Otto I of Germany. Dudon of Saint-Quentin: ''De Moribus et actis primorum Normanniae ducum'', ed. [[Jules Lair]], Caen, 1865, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The heir of [[Duchy of Normandy]] was [[Richard I of Normandy|Richard I]], the ten-year-old son of William born from his Breton concubine, while Herbert II leave as heirs four adult sons.

Louis IV took advantage of the internal disorder in the Duchy of Normandy and entered [[Rouen]], where he received the homage from part of the Norman aristocracy and offered his protection to the infant Richard I with the help of Hugh the Great.&lt;ref&gt;Riché 1999, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; The regency of Normandy was entrusted to the faithful Herluin, Count of Montreuil (who was also a vassal of Hugh the Great), while Richard I was imprisoned first in Laon and then in [[Château de Coucy]].&lt;ref&gt;Although the history of the minority of Richard I is very confusing, it seems that this really happened. Dudon of Saint-Quentin, ''op. cit.'', pp.  86-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vermandois, the King also took measures to diminish the power of Herbert II's sons by dividing their lands between them: Eudes (as [[Count of Amiens]]), [[Herbert III of Omois|Herbert III]] (as Count of Château-Thierry), [[Robert of Vermandois|Robert]] (as [[Count of Meaux]]) and [[Adalbert I, Count of Vermandois|Albert]] (as Count of Saint-Quentin). Albert of Vermandois took the side of the King and paid homage to him, while the Abbey of Saint-Crépin in Soissons was finally given to [[Renaud of Roucy]].&lt;ref&gt;Theis 1990, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 943, during the homage given to the King, Hugh the Great recovered the ''ducatus Franciae'' (Duchy of France) title and the rule over Burgundy.&lt;ref&gt;Guillot, Sassier 2003, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 945 Louis IV went to Normandy after being called by his faithful Herluin, who was a victim of a serious revolt. While the two were riding, they were ambushed near [[Bayeux]].&lt;ref&gt;The Normans had never accepted the regency of Herluin. Dudo of Saint-Quentin, ''op. cit.'', p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Herluin was killed, but Louis IV managed to escape to Rouen; where he was finally captured by the Normans. The kidnappers demanded from Queen Gerberga that she send her two sons Lothair and Charles as hostages in exchange for the release of her husband. The Queen only sent her youngest son Charles, with Bishop Guy of Soissons taking the place of Lothair, the eldest son and heir.&lt;ref&gt;It seems that Richard I was returned to the Normans at the same time. Dudon of Saint-Quentin, ''op. cit.'', p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Like his father, Louis IV was kept in captivity, then sent to Hugh the Great. On his orders, the king was placed under the custody of [[Theobald I, Count of Blois]] for several months.&lt;ref name="Sassier1987"&gt;Sassier 1987, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The ambush and capture of the King were probably ordered by Hugh the Great, who wanted to permanently end his attempts of political independence.&lt;ref name="T1990c"&gt;Theis 1990, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, probably by the pressure of the Frankish nobles and Kings Otto I and [[Edmund I]] of England, Hugh the Great decided to release Louis IV.&lt;ref name="Sassier1987" /&gt; Flodoard recorded this event as follows:

::Hugh the Great restored King Louis to his functions, at least in name.&lt;ref name="T1990c" /&gt;

Hugh was the only one who would decide if Louis IV could be restored or deposed. In return for the release of the King, he demanded the surrender of Laon,&lt;ref&gt;Richer de Reims: ''Gallica Histoire de son temps'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20140722043904/http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1022235.zoom.f314.langFR.pagination Book II, p. 203] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927231718/http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark%3A/12148/bpt6k1022235.zoom.f314.langFR.pagination |date=27 September 2015 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; which was entrusted to his vassal Thibaud.&lt;ref name="Sassier1987" /&gt; The Carolingian kinship was in the abyss, because it no longer held or controlled anything.

In June 946, a royal charter called optimistically the "eleventh year of the reign of Louis when he had recovered the ''Francia''". This charter is the first official text who identified only the Western Frankish kingdom (sometimes called West Francia by some historians).&lt;ref name="Pinoteau"&gt;Hervé Pinoteau: ''La symbolique royale française, ve ‑ xviiie siècles'', PSR, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; This statement is consistent with the fact that the title of King of the Franks, used since 911 by Charles the Simple&lt;ref name="Pinoteau" /&gt; was thereafter continuously claimed by the Kings of the Western Kingdom after the [[Treaty of Verdun]], including the non-Carolingians ones. Among the Kings of the East, sometimes called Germanic Kings, this claim was occasional and disappeared completely after the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hervé Pinoteau: ''La symbolique royale française, ve ‑ xviiie siècles'', PSR, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Otto I was not satisfied with the growing power of Hugh the Great who, although not accepted by the whole kingdom, respected the division of powers. In 946 Otto I and [[Conrad I of Burgundy]] raised an army and tried to take Laon and then [[Senlis]].&lt;ref&gt;Sassier 1987, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; They invaded Reims with a large army, according to Flodoard. Archbishop [[Hugh of Vermandois (bishop)|Hugh of Vermandois]] escaped and Artald was restored. "Robert, Archbishop of Trier and [[Frederick (archbishop of Mainz)|Frederick]], Archbishop of Mainz take everyone by the hand" (Flodoard). A few months later, Louis IV joined the fight against Hugh the Great and his allies at the Battle of Rouen. In the spring of 947, Louis and his wife Gerberga spent the Easter holidays in Aachen at the court of Otto I, asking him for help in their war against Hugh the Great.&lt;ref&gt;Régine Le Jan: ''Femmes, pouvoir et société dans le haut Moyen Âge'', 2001, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between late 947 and late 948, four imperial synods were held by Otto I between Meuse and Rhine to settle the fate of the Archbishopric of Reims and Hugh the Great.&lt;ref&gt;Theis 1990, pp. 174-175.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Synod of Ingelheim]] (June 948) participated the apostolic legate, thirty German and Burgundian bishops and finally Artald and his suffragants of Laon among the Frankish clerics. Louis IV presented his claims against Hugh the Great at the synod. The surviving final acts determined: "Anybody had the right to undermine the royal power or treacherously revolted against their King. We therefore decide that Hugh was the invasor and abductor of Louis, and he will be struck with the sword of the excommunication unless he presents himself and give a satisfaction to us for his perversity".&lt;ref&gt;Theis 1990, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

But the Duke of the Franks, not paying attention to the sentence, devastated [[Soissons]], Reims and profaned dozens of churches. In the meanwhile, his vassal and relative [[Theobald I, Count of Blois]] (nicknamed "the Trickster") who had married [[Luitgarde of Vermandois]], daughter of Herbert II of Vermandois and widow of William I Longsword, had built a fortress in [[Montaigu, Aisne|Montaigu]] in Laon to humiliate the king, and seized the lordship of [[Coucy-le-Château-Auffrique]] in Reims. The Synod of Trier (September 948) decided to excommunicate him for his actions. Guy I, [[Count of Soissons]], who ordained Hugh of Vermandois, must repent, while Thibaud of Amiens and Yves of Senlis, who both consecrated Hugh, were excommunicated. The King, with the help of Arnold, deposed Thibaud from the seat of Amiens and placed the faithful Raimbaud in his place (949).&lt;ref&gt;Theis 1990, p. 177, 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return of the balance ===
The last step in the emancipation of Louis IV shows that his reign wasn't entirely negative. In 949 he entered Laon, where by command of Hugh the Great, Theobald I of Blois surrendered to him the fortress he had built a few months earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Sassier 1987, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The King recovered, at the expense of Herbert II's vassals, the château of [[Corbeny]] which his father had given to Saint-Remi of Reims and also authorized archbishop Artald to mint coins in his city.&lt;ref&gt;Flodoard: ''Histoire de l'Église de Reims'', pp. 548-549.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 950 Louis IV and Hugh the Great finally reconciled. After the death of [[Hugh the Black]] in 952, Hugh the Great captured his half of Burgundy. Louis IV, now allied with Arnulf I of Flanders and [[Adalbert I, Count of Vermandois]], exercised real authority only north of the river [[Loire]]. He also rewarded Liétald II of Mâcon and [[Charles Constantine of Vienne]] for their loyalty. For a long time Louis IV and his son [[Lothair of France|Lothair]] were the last kings to venture south of the river Loire.

In 951 Louis IV fell seriously ill during a stay in [[Auvergne]] and decided to associate to the throne his eldest son and heir, the ten-year-old Lothair.&lt;ref&gt;Isaïa 2009, pp. 190-191.&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay, he received homage of Bishop Étienne II, brother of the viscount of Clermont. Louis IV recovered from his disease thanks to the care of his wife Gerberga, who during the reign of her husband had a key role. The royal couple had seven children, of whom only three survived infancy: Lothair, the eldest son and future King – that Flodoard cites not to be confused with the son of [[Louis the Pious]]: ''Lotharius puer, filius Ludowici'' (infant Lothair, son of Louis)–, [[Matilda of France|Mathilde]] – who in 964 married King [[Conrad I of Burgundy]] – and [[Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine|Charles]] – who was invested as Duke of Lower Lorraine by his cousin [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] in 977–.&lt;ref&gt;Flodoard: ''Histoire de l'Église de Reims'', p. 550.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 950s, the royal power network was entrenched by construction of several palaces in the towns that were recovered by the King. Under Louis IV (and also during the reign of his son), there is a geographical tightening of royal lands around Compiègne, Laon and Reims which eventually gave Laon an incontestable primacy. Thus, through the charters issued by the Royal Chancery, can be followed the stays of Louis IV. The King spent mostly of his time in the palaces of Reims (21% of the charters), Laon (15%), Compiègne and Soissons (2% for each of them).&lt;ref&gt;Renoux 1992, p. 181, 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flodoard records in 951 that Queen Eadgifu (''Ottogeba regina mater Ludowici regis''), who since her return with her son to France retired to the Abbey of Notre Dame in Laon (''abbatiam sanctæ Mariæ...Lauduni''), where she became the Abbess, was abducted from there by [[Herbert III of Omois|Herbert III of Vermandois]], Count of Château-Thierry (''Heriberti...Adalberti fratris''), who married her shortly after; the King, furious about this (''rex Ludowicus iratus'') confiscated the Abbey of Notre Dame from his mother and donated it to his wife Gerberga (''Gerbergæ uxori suæ'').&lt;ref&gt;Flodoard: ''Annals'', Monumenta Germaniæ Historica Scriptorum III, p. 401.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean nDunba: ''West Francia: The Kingdom''. In: Timothy Reuter. The New Cambridge Medieval History III. Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death of Louis IV and the Legend of the Wolf ==
In the early 950s, Queen Gerberga developed an increased [[Eschatology|eschatological]] fear, and began to consult [[Adso of Montier-en-Der]]; being highly educated, she commissioned to him the ''De ortu et tempore antichristi'' (Birth of the era of the Antichrist). There worries of the Queen assuring her that the arrival of the [[Antichrist]] will not take place before the end of the Kingdoms of France and Germany, the two ''Imperia'' fundamentals of the universe. In consequence, the Frankish King can continue his reign without fear, because Heaven was the door of legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Sassier 2002, pp. 188-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the summer of 954, Louis IV went riding with his companions on the road from Laon to Reims. As he crossed the forest of Voas (near to his palace in [[Corbeny]]), he saw a wolf and attempted to capture it. Flodoard, from whom these details are known, said that the King [[List of horse accidents|fell from his horse]]. Urgently carried to Reims, he eventually died from his injuries on 10 September. For the Reims canons, the wolf whom the king tried to hunt wasn't an animal but a fantastic creature, a divine supernatural intervention.

Flodoard recalled indeed that in 938 Louis IV had captured Corbeny in extreme brutality and without respecting the donations to the monks made by his father. Thus God could punish the King and his descendants with the curse of the wolf as a "plague". The later events are disturbing. According to Flodoard Louis reportedly died from [[tuberculosis]] (then called ''pesta elephantis''); in 986 his son Lothair died by a "plague"&lt;ref&gt;Richer de Reims: [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k102231r.image.f141 ''Histoire de son temps – La mort de Lothaire''], Book III, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; after he besieged [[Verdun]], and finally his grandson [[Louis V of France|Louis V]] died in 987 from injuries received when falling from his horse while hunting, a few months after he besieged Reims for the trial of archbishop [[Adalbero (archbishop of Reims)|Adalberon]].&lt;ref&gt;Poly 1990, pp. 292-294.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dynastic memorial and burial ==
Gerberga, a dynamic and devoted wife, supported the burial of her late husband at the [[Abbey of Saint-Remi]].&lt;ref name="Bradbury41"&gt;Jim Bradbury, ''The Capetians: Kings of France 987-1328'', (Hambledon Continuum, 2007), 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Unusually for the Carolingians, she took care of the dynastic memorial (''mémoire dynastique'') of Louis IV. The Queen, from Ottonian descent, was constantly at the side of her husband, supporting him and being active in the defence of Laon (941) and of Reims (946), accompanied him on the military expeditions to Aquitaine (944) and Burgundy (949), and was also active during his period of imprisonment in 945-946.&lt;ref name="Isaïa"&gt;Isaïa 2009, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; By France and Germany, the role of queens was different: the memorial mostly was a task of males. Written shortly after 956, perhaps by Adso of Montier-en-Der (according to [[Karl Ferdinand Werner]]) the ''Life of Clotilde''&lt;ref&gt;Michel Rouche: ''Clovis, histoire et mémoire'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ll2sF5OPRH8C&amp;pg=PA147#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false online], 1997, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; proposes to Queen Gerberga to build a church destined to be burial place of members of the Carolingian dynasty: the Abbey of Saint-Remi; moreover in a charter dated 955, King Lothair, following the desires of his mother, confirmed the immunity of Saint-Remi as the place of coronations and royal necropolis.

The tomb of Louis IV was later destroyed during the [[French Revolution]]. At that time, the two tombs of Louis IV and his son Lothair were in the centre of the Abbey, the side of the Epistle reserved to Louis IV and the side of the gospel to Lothair. Both remains were moved in the middle of the 18th century and transported to the right and left of the mausoleum of [[Carloman I]] first under the first arch of the collateral nave towards the sacristy of Saint-Remi Abbey. The statues placed on the original graves were left there. Both statues were painted and the golden [[Fleur-de-lis]] on each of the Kings' capes was easily visible. A graphic description of the tombs was made by [[Bernard de Montfaucon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard de Montfaucon]]: ''Les monuments de la monarchie française'', vol. I, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prosper Tarbé: ''Les sépultures de l'église Saint-Remi de Reims'', 1842.&lt;/ref&gt; Louis IV was shown seated on a throne with a double-dossier. He was depicted as full-bearded, wearing a [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]] and dressed with a [[chlamys]] and also was holding a sceptre who ended with a pine cone. The throne of Louis IV was similar to a bench placed on a pedestal of the same material. The seat had a back that was above the royal head he was home with a gable roof, three arches decorated the underside of the roof. The base on which rested his feet was decorated at the corners with figures of children or lions.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Settipani: ''La Préhistoire des Capétiens'', ed. Patrick Van Kerrebrouck, 1993, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Children ==
Louis IV and Gerberga had seven children:&lt;ref&gt;Christian Settipani: ''La Préhistoire des Capétiens'', éd. Patrick Van Kerrebrouck, 1993, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lothair of France|Lothair]] (end 941 – 2 March 986), successor of his father.
* [[Matilda of France|Mathilde]] (end 943 – 27 January 992), married on 964 to King [[Conrad I of Burgundy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Burgundy and Provence, 879-1032'', Constance Brittain Bourchard, '''The New Cambridge Medieval History: Volume 3, C.900-c.1024''', ed. Rosamond McKitterick and Timothy Reuter, (Cambridge University Press, 1999), 342.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Charles (January 945 – [[Rouen]], before 953). Guillaume de Jumièges records that a son of Louis IV hostage of the Normans after 13 July 945 to secure the release of his father,&lt;ref&gt;''Willelmi Gemmetencis Historiæ'' (Du Chesne, 1619), Book IV, chap. VIII, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; although it's unknown whether this son was Charles, who would have been a baby at the time, normally too young to have been used as a hostage according to then current practice.
* Daughter (947 / early 948 – died young). Flodoard records that ''Chonradus...dux'' baptised ''filiam Ludowici regis'' in the middle of his passage dealing with 948.&lt;ref&gt;Flodoard: ''Annals'', Monumenta Germaniæ Historica Scriptorum III, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; She must have been born in the previous year, or very early in the same year, if the timing of the birth of King Louis's son Louis is correctly dated to the end of 948.
* Louis (December 948 – before 10 September 954). The ''Genealogica Arnulfi Comitis'' names (in order) ''Hlotharium Karolum Ludovicum et Mathildim'' as children of ''Hludovicum ex regina Gerberga''. Flodoard records the birth of ''regi Ludowico filius...patris ei nomen imponens'' at the end of his passage concerning 948.&lt;ref&gt;Flodoard: ''Annals'', Monumenta Germaniæ Historica Scriptorum III, p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine|Charles]] (summer 953 – 12 June 991), invested as [[Duke of Lower Lorraine]] by Emperor Otto II in May 977 at Diedenhofen.
* Henry (summer 953 – died shortly after his baptism). Flodoard records the birth of twins to ''Gerberga regina'' in 953 ''unus Karolus, later Heinricus, sed Henricus mox post baptismum defunctus est''.&lt;ref&gt;Flodoard: ''Annals'', Monumenta Germaniæ Historica Scriptorum III, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Succession ==
Immediately after Louis IV died, his widow Gerberga was forced to obtain the approval of Hugh the Great for the coronation of her son Lothair, which took place on 12 November 954 at the Abbey of Saint-Remi in Reims.&lt;ref&gt;Guillot, Sassier 2003, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

The regency of the Kingdom was held firstly by Hugh the Great, and after his death in 956 by Gerberga's brother [[Bruno the Great]], [[Archbishop of Cologne]] and [[Duke of Lotharingia]] until 965, marking the Ottonian influence over France during all the second half of the 10th century.&lt;ref name="Isaïa" /&gt; Thus, the end of Louis IV's reign and the beginning of the rule of Lothair, wasn't the "''dark century of iron and lead'' [...] ''but rather'' [...] ''the last century of the Carolingian Europe''".&lt;ref&gt;Riché 1999, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis IV's youngest surviving son Charles, known as ''Charles of Lower Lorraine'', settled on an island in the [[Zenne]] river in the primitive ''[[pagus]]'' of Brabant, where he erected a [[Castra|castrum]] in the town called ''Bruoc Sella'' or ''Broek Zele'', which later became [[Brussels]].

'''Whole brain emulation''' ('''WBE'''), '''mind upload''' or '''brain upload''' (sometimes called "'''mind copying'''" or "'''mind transfer'''") is the hypothetical futuristic process of [[brain scanning|scanning]] the mental state (including long-term memory and "self") of a particular brain substrate and copying it to a computer. The computer could then run a [[computer simulation|simulation]] model of the brain's information processing, such that it responds in essentially the same way as the original brain (i.e., indistinguishable from the brain for all relevant purposes) and experiences having a conscious [[mind]].&lt;ref name="sim.me.uk"&gt;[http://www.sim.me.uk/neural/JournalArticles/Bamford2012IJMC.pdf A framework for approaches to transfer of a mind's substrate], Sim Bamford&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Introduction|journal=International Journal of Machine Consciousness|volume=04|pages=1–3|doi=10.1142/S1793843012020015|year = 2012|last1 = Goertzel|first1 = BEN|last2=Ikle'|first2=Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kajsotala.fi"&gt;[http://kajsotala.fi/Papers/CoalescingMinds.pdf Coalescing minds: brain uploading-related group mind scenarios]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mind uploading may potentially be accomplished by either of two methods: Copy-and-transfer or gradual replacement of neurons. In the case of the former method, mind uploading would be achieved by [[brain scanning|scanning]] and [[Brain mapping|mapping]] the salient features of a biological brain, and then by copying, transferring, and storing that information state into a computer system or another computational device. The biological brain may not survive the copying process. The simulated mind could be within a virtual reality or [[simulated reality|simulated world]], supported by an anatomic 3D body simulation model. Alternatively the simulated mind could reside in a computer that is inside (or connected to) a (not necessarily [[humanoid]]) [[robot]] or a biological body.&lt;ref name=Roadmap&gt;

Among some futurists and within the [[Transhumanism|transhumanist]] movement, mind uploading is treated as an important proposed [[life extension]] technology. Some believe mind uploading is humanity's current best option for preserving the identity of the species, as opposed to [[cryonics]].  Another aim of mind uploading is to provide a permanent backup to our "mind-file", to enable interstellar space travels, and a means for human culture to survive a global disaster by making a functional copy of a human society in a [[Matrioshka brain]], i.e. a computing device that consumes all energy from  a star. Whole brain emulation is discussed by some [[futurist]]s as a "logical endpoint"&lt;ref name=Roadmap/&gt; of the topical [[computational neuroscience]] and [[neuroinformatics]] fields, both about brain simulation for medical research purposes. It is discussed in [[artificial intelligence]] research publications as an approach to [[computational theory of mind|strong AI]]. Computer-based intelligence such as an upload could think much faster than a biological human even if it were no more intelligent. A large-scale society of uploads might, according to futurists, give rise to a [[technological singularity]], meaning a sudden time constant decrease in the exponential development of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |last=Goertzel|first=Ben|authorlink=Ben Goertzel|date=December 2007|title=Human-level artificial general intelligence and the possibility of a technological singularity: a reaction to Ray Kurzweil's The Singularity Is Near, and McDermott's critique of Kurzweil|journal=Artificial Intelligence|volume=171|issue=18, Special Review Issue|pages=1161–1173|doi=10.1016/j.artint.2007.10.011|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4599202374830957934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mind uploading is a central conceptual feature of [[Mind uploading in fiction|numerous science fiction novels and films]].

Substantial mainstream research in related areas is being conducted in animal brain mapping and simulation, development of faster supercomputers, virtual reality, [[brain–computer interface]]s, [[connectomics]] and information extraction from dynamically functioning brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kay KN, Naselaris T, Prenger RJ, Gallant JL |title=Identifying natural images from human brain activity |journal=Nature |volume=452 |issue=7185 |pages=352–5 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18322462 |doi=10.1038/nature06713|bibcode = 2008Natur.452..352K |pmc=3556484}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to supporters, many of the tools and ideas needed to achieve mind uploading already exist or are currently under active development; however, they will admit that others are, as yet, very speculative, but still in the realm of engineering possibility. Neuroscientist [[Randal A. Koene|Randal Koene]] has formed a nonprofit organization called Carbon Copies to promote mind uploading research.

==Overview==
[[File:Dendrite (PSF).svg|thumb|right|Neuron anatomical model]]
[[File:Neural network.svg|thumb|right|Simple artificial [[neural network]]]]

The human [[brain]] contains, on average, about 86 billion nerve cells called [[neurons]], each individually linked to other neurons by way of connectors called [[axon]]s and [[dendrite]]s. Signals at the junctures ([[synapse]]s) of these connections are transmitted by the release and [[Receptor (biochemistry)|detection]] of chemicals known as [[neurotransmitters]]. The established neuroscientific consensus is that the human [[mind]] is largely an [[Emergence|emergent]] property of the information processing of this [[neuronal network|neural network]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Neuroscientists have stated that important functions performed by the mind, such as learning, memory, and consciousness, are due to purely physical and electrochemical processes in the brain and are governed by applicable laws. For example, [[Christof Koch]] and [[Giulio Tononi]] wrote in ''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'':

{{Quote|Consciousness is part of the natural world. It depends, we believe, only on mathematics and logic and on the imperfectly known laws of physics, chemistry, and biology; it does not arise from some magical or otherworldly quality.&lt;ref name="ieee_conscious"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/MSPEC.2008.4531463 |title=Can machines be conscious? |year=2008 |last1=Koch |first1=Christof |authorlink1=Giulio Tononi |last2=Tononi |first2=Giulio|journal=IEEE Spectrum |volume=45 |pages=55 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The concept of mind uploading is based on this [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] view of the mind, and denies the [[vitalism|vitalist]] view of human life and consciousness.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Eminent [[computer scientists]] and neuroscientists have predicted that specially programmed{{clarify|date=September 2018}} [[computers]] will be capable of thought and even attain consciousness, including Koch and Tononi,&lt;ref name="ieee_conscious"/&gt; [[Douglas Hofstadter]],&lt;ref name="spectrum.ieee.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/jun08/6277|title=Tech Luminaries Address Singularity|author=null|work=ieee.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeff Hawkins]],&lt;ref name="spectrum.ieee.org"/&gt; [[Marvin Minsky]],&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Minsky, Conscious Machines, in 'Machinery of Consciousness', Proceedings, National Research Council of Canada, 75th Anniversary Symposium on Science in Society, June 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Randal A.

However, even though uploading is dependent upon such a general capability, it is conceptually distinct from general forms of AI in that it results from dynamic reanimation of information derived from a specific human mind so that the mind retains a sense of historical identity (other forms are possible but would compromise or eliminate the life-extension feature generally associated with uploading). The transferred and reanimated information would become a form of artificial intelligence, sometimes called an [[infomorph]] or ''"noömorph"''.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Many theorists have presented models of the brain and have established a range of estimates of the amount of computing power needed for partial and complete simulations.&lt;ref name=Roadmap/&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=citations also needed for Boahen, Modha, Izhikevich,  others|date=September 2011}} Using these models, some have estimated that uploading may become possible within decades if trends such as [[Moore's law]] continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ray Kurzweil|author-link=Ray Kurzweil|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/live-forever-uploading-the-human-braincloser-than-you-think|title=Live Forever–Uploading The Human Brain...Closer Than You Think|work=Psychology Today|date=February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical benefits and applications==

==="Immortality" or backup===
{{Main|Digital immortality}}
In theory, if the information and processes of the mind can be disassociated from the biological body, they are no longer tied to the individual limits and lifespan of that body. Furthermore, information within a brain could be partly or wholly copied or transferred to one or more other substrates (including digital storage or another brain), thereby – from a purely mechanistic perspective – reducing or eliminating "mortality risk" of such information. This general proposal was discussed in 1971 by [[biomedical gerontology|biogerontologist]] [[George M. Martin]] of the [[University of Washington]].&lt;ref name="Martin 1971 339"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Martin GM |title=Brief proposal on immortality: an interim solution |journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=339 |year=1971 |pmid=5546258 |doi=10.1353/pbm.1971.0015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space exploration===
An “uploaded astronaut” could be used instead of a "live" astronaut in [[human spaceflight]], avoiding the perils of [[zero gravity]], the [[vacuum]] of space, and [[cosmic radiation]] to the [[human body]]. It would allow for the use of smaller spacecraft, such as the proposed [[StarChip (spacecraft)|StarChip]], and it would enable virtually unlimited [[interstellar travel]] distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prisco|first1=Giulio|title=Uploaded e-crews for interstellar missions|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/uploaded-e-crews-for-interstellar-missions|website=kurzweilai.net|accessdate=31 July 2015|date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevant technologies and techniques==
The focus of mind uploading, in the case of copy-and-transfer, is on data acquisition, rather than data maintenance of the brain. A set of approaches known as loosely coupled off-loading (LCOL) may be used in the attempt to characterize and copy the mental contents of a brain.&lt;ref name=SIM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carboncopies.org/substrate-independent-minds|title=Substrate-Independent Minds - Carboncopies.org Foundation|work=carboncopies.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LCOL approach may take advantage of self-reports, life-logs and video recordings that can be analyzed by artificial intelligence. A bottom-up approach may focus on the specific resolution and morphology of neurons, the spike times of neurons, the times at which neurons produce action potential responses.

===Computational complexity===
[[File:Estimations of Human Brain Emulation Required Performance.svg|thumb|right|400px|Estimates of how much processing power is needed to emulate a human brain at various levels (from [[Ray Kurzweil]] and the chart to the left), along with the fastest supercomputer from [[TOP500]] mapped by year. Note the logarithmic scale and exponential trendline, which assumes the computational capacity doubles every 1.1 years. Kurzweil believes that mind uploading will be possible at neural simulation, while the Sandberg, Bostrom report is less certain about where consciousness arises.&lt;ref&gt;Roadmap p.11 "Given the complexities and conceptual issues of consciousness we will not examine criteria 
6abc, but mainly examine achieving criteria 1‐5."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Advocates of mind uploading point to Moore's law to support the notion that the necessary computing power is expected to become available within a few decades. However, the actual computational requirements for running an uploaded human mind are very difficult to quantify, potentially rendering such an argument specious.

Regardless of the techniques used to capture or recreate the function of a human mind, the processing demands are likely to be immense, due to the large number of neurons in the human brain along with the considerable complexity of each neuron.

In 2004, [[Henry Markram]], lead researcher of the "[[Blue Brain Project]]", stated that "it is not [their] goal to build an intelligent neural network", based solely on the computational demands such a project would have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluebrainproject.epfl.ch/FAQs.htm|title=Bluebrain - EPFL|date=19 May 2015|work=epfl.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It will be very difficult because, in the brain, every molecule is a powerful computer and we would need to simulate the structure and function of trillions upon trillions of molecules as well as all the rules that govern how they interact. You would literally need computers that are trillions of times bigger and faster than anything existing today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/page18924.html Blue Brain Project FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127195551/http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/page18924.html |date=2007-01-27 }}, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Five years later, after successful simulation of part of a rat brain, Markram was much more bold and optimistic. In 2009, as director of the Blue Brain Project, he claimed that “A detailed, functional artificial human brain can be built within the next 10 years.”&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8164060.stm Artificial brain '10 years away']&lt;/ref&gt;

Required computational capacity strongly depend on the chosen level of simulation model scale:&lt;ref name=Roadmap/&gt;

===Simulation model scale===
[[File:IDA Cognitive Architecture.jpg|thumb|right|A high-level cognitive AI model of the brain architecture is not required for brain emulation]]
[[File:ArtificialNeuronModel_english.png|thumb|right|Simple neuron model: Black-box dynamic non-linear signal processing system]]
[[File:Action potential propagation animation.gif|thumb|right|Metabolism model: The movement of positively charged ions through the ion channels controls the membrane electrical [[action potential]] in an axon.]]

Since the function of the human mind and how it might arise from the working of the brain's [[neural network]], are poorly understood issues, mind uploading relies on the idea of neural network [[emulator|emulation]]. Rather than having to understand the high-level psychological processes and large-scale structures of the brain, and model them using classical [[artificial intelligence]] methods and [[cognitive psychology]] models, the low-level structure of the underlying neural network is captured, mapped and emulated with a computer system. In computer science terminology,{{dubious|date=February 2013}} rather than analyzing and [[reverse engineering]] the behavior of the algorithms and data structures that resides in the brain, a blueprint of its source code is translated to another programming language. The human mind and the personal identity then, theoretically, is generated by the emulated neural network in an identical fashion to it being generated by the biological neural network.

On the other hand, a molecule-scale simulation of the brain is not expected to be required, provided that the functioning of the neurons is not affected by [[quantum mechanical]] processes. The neural network emulation approach only requires that the functioning and interaction of neurons and synapses are understood. It is expected that it is sufficient with a [[black-box]] [[signal processing]] model of how the neurons respond to [[nerve impulse]]s ([[Electrical synapse|electrical]] as well as [[Chemical synapse|chemical synaptic transmission]]).

A sufficiently complex and accurate model of the neurons is required. A traditional [[artificial neural network]] model, for example [[multi-layer perceptron]] network model, is not considered as sufficient. A dynamic [[spiking neural network]] model is required, which reflects that the neuron fires only when a membrane potential reaches a certain level. It is likely that the model must include delays, non-linear functions and differential equations describing the relation between electrophysical parameters such as electrical currents, voltages, membrane states ([[ion channel]] states) and [[neuromodulators]].

Since learning and [[long-term memory]] are believed to result from strengthening or weakening the synapses via a mechanism known as [[synaptic plasticity]] or synaptic adaptation, the model should include this mechanism. The response of [[sensory receptor]]s to various stimuli must also be modelled.

Furthermore, the model may have to include [[metabolism]], i.e. how the neurons are affected by [[hormone]]s and other chemical substances that may cross the blood–brain barrier. It is considered likely that the model must include currently unknown [[neuromodulators]], [[neurotransmitters]] and ion channels. It is considered unlikely that the simulation model has to include [[protein interaction]], which would make it computationally complex.&lt;ref name=Roadmap/&gt;

A digital computer simulation model of an analog system such as the brain is an approximation that introduces random [[quantization error]]s and [[distortion]]. However, the biological neurons also suffer from randomness and limited precision, for example due to [[background noise]]. The errors of the discrete model can be made smaller than the randomness of the biological brain by choosing a sufficiently high variable resolution and sample rate, and sufficiently accurate models of non-linearities. The [[computational power]] and computer memory must however be sufficient to run such large simulations, preferably in [[Real-time computing|real time]].

===Scanning and mapping scale of an individual===
When modelling and simulating the brain of a specific individual, a brain map or connectivity database showing the connections between the neurons must be extracted from an anatomic model of the brain. For whole brain simulation, this network map should show the connectivity of the whole [[nervous system]], including the [[spinal cord]], [[sensory receptor]]s, and [[muscle cells]].  Destructive scanning of a small sample of tissue from a mouse brain including synaptic details is possible as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New imaging method developed at Stanford reveals stunning details of brain connections|url=http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2010/11/new-imaging-method-developed-at-stanford-reveals-stunning-details-of-brain-connections.html|publisher=Stanford Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, if [[short-term memory]] and [[working memory]] include prolonged or repeated firing of neurons, as well as intra-neural dynamic processes, the electrical and chemical signal state of the synapses and neurons may be hard to extract. The uploaded mind may then perceive a [[memory loss]] of the events and mental processes immediately before the time of brain scanning.&lt;ref name=Roadmap/&gt;

A full brain map has been estimated to occupy less than 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; bytes (20,000 TB) and would store the addresses of the connected neurons, the synapse type and the synapse "weight" for each of the brains' 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; synapses.&lt;ref name=Roadmap/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2012}}  However, the biological complexities of true brain function (e.g. the epigenetic states of neurons, protein components with multiple functional states, etc.) may preclude an accurate prediction of the volume of binary data required to faithfully represent a functioning human mind.

===Serial sectioning===
[[File:User-FastFission-brain.gif|thumb|right|Serial sectioning of a brain]]
A possible method for mind uploading is serial sectioning, in which the brain tissue and perhaps other parts of the nervous system are frozen and then scanned and analyzed layer by layer, which for frozen samples at nano-scale requires a cryo-[[ultramicrotome]], thus capturing the structure of the neurons and their interconnections.&lt;ref name ="Merkle 1989"&gt;Merkle, R., 1989, [http://www.merkle.com/merkleDir/brainAnalysis.html Large scale analysis of neural structures], CSL-89-10 November 1989, [P89-00173]&lt;/ref&gt; The exposed surface of frozen nerve tissue would be scanned and recorded, and then the surface layer of tissue removed. While this would be a very slow and labor-intensive process, research is currently underway to automate the collection and microscopy of serial sections.&lt;ref name="ATLUM Project"&gt;[http://www.mcb.harvard.edu/lichtman/ATLUM/ATLUM_web.htm ATLUM Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201055512/http://www.mcb.harvard.edu/lichtman/ATLUM/ATLUM_web.htm |date=2008-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scans would then be analyzed, and a model of the neural net recreated in the system that the mind was being uploaded into.

There are uncertainties with this approach using current microscopy techniques. If it is possible to replicate neuron function from its visible structure alone, then the resolution afforded by a [[scanning electron microscope]] would suffice for such a technique.&lt;ref name ="ATLUM Project"/&gt; However, as the function of brain tissue is partially determined by molecular events (particularly at [[synapse]]s, but also at [[Ion channel|other]] places on the neuron's cell [[Membrane potential|membrane]]), this may not suffice for capturing and simulating neuron functions. It may be possible to extend the techniques of serial sectioning and to capture the internal molecular makeup of neurons, through the use of sophisticated [[immunohistochemistry]] staining methods that could then be read via [[confocal laser scanning microscopy]]. However, as the physiological genesis of 'mind' is not currently known, this method may not be able to access all of the necessary biochemical information to recreate a human brain with sufficient fidelity.

===Brain imaging===
[[File:Connectome extraction procedure.jpg|thumb|right|Process from MRI acquisition to whole brain structural network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060159 |title=Mapping the Structural Core of Human Cerebral Cortex |year=2008 |last1=Hagmann |first1=Patric |last2=Cammoun |editor1-first=Karl J. |first2=Leila |last3=Gigandet |first3=Xavier |last4=Meuli |editor1-last=Friston |first4=Reto |last5=Honey |first5=Christopher J. |last6=Wedeen |first6=Van J. |last7=Sporns |first7=Olaf |last8=Friston |first8=Karl J. |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=6 |pages=e159 |pmid=18597554 |issue=7 |pmc=2443193}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Magnetoencephalography.png|thumb|right|[[Magnetoencephalography]]]]

It may be possible to create functional 3D maps of the brain activity, using advanced [[neuroimaging]] technology, such as [[functional MRI]] (fMRI, for mapping change in blood flow), [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG, for mapping of electrical currents), or combinations of multiple methods, to build a detailed three-dimensional model of the brain using non-invasive and non-destructive methods. Today, fMRI is often combined with MEG for creating functional maps of human cortex during more complex cognitive tasks, as the methods complement each other. Even though current imaging technology lacks the spatial resolution needed to gather the information needed for such a scan, important recent and future developments are predicted to substantially improve both spatial and temporal resolutions of existing technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/457971a |title=Medical imaging: MRI rides the wave |year=2009 |last1=Glover |first1=Paul |last2=Bowtell |first2=Richard |journal=Nature |volume=457 |pages=971–2 |pmid=19225512 |issue=7232|bibcode = 2009Natur.457..971G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

===Philosophical issues===
Underlying the concept of "mind uploading" (more accurately "mind transferring") is the broad philosophy that consciousness lies within the brain's information processing and is in essence an [[emergence|emergent]] feature that arises from large neural network high-level patterns of organization, and that the same patterns of organization can be realized in other processing devices. Mind uploading also relies on the idea that the human mind (the "self" and the long-term memory), just like non-human minds, is represented by the current neural network paths and the weights of the brain synapses rather than by a [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualistic]] and mystic soul and spirit. The mind or "soul" can be defined as the information state of the brain, and is immaterial only in the same sense as the information content of a data file or the state of a computer software currently residing in the work-space memory of the computer. Data specifying the information state of the neural network can be captured and copied as a "computer file" from the brain and re-implemented into a different physical form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hplusmagazine.com/2013/06/17/clearing-up-misconceptions-about-mind-uploading/|title=Clearing Up Misconceptions About Mind Uploading|work=h+ Media|date=June 17, 2013 |author= Franco Cortese}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to deny that minds are richly adapted to their substrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/choe/ftp/publications/choe-ijmc12-preprint.pdf|title=Time, Consciousness, and Mind Uploading|journal=International Journal of Machine Consciousness|year=2012|doi=10.1142/S179384301240015X|volume=04|issue=01|pages=257 |author1=Yoonsuck Choe |author2= Jaerock Kwon |author3= Ji Ryang Chung }}&lt;/ref&gt; An analogy to the idea of mind uploading is to copy the temporary information state (the variable values) of a computer program from the computer memory to another computer and continue its execution. The other computer may perhaps have different hardware architecture but [[computer emulator|emulates]] the hardware of the first computer.

These issues have a long history. In 1775 [[Thomas Reid]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benbest.com/philo/doubles.html|title=The Duplicates Paradox (The Duplicates Problem)|work=benbest.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; “I would be glad to know... whether when my brain has lost its original structure, and when some hundred years after the same materials are fabricated so curiously as to become an intelligent being, whether, I say that being will be me; or, if, two or three such beings should be formed out of my brain; whether they will all be me, and consequently one and the same intelligent being.”

A considerable portion of [[transhumanists]] and [[singularitarians]] place great hope into the belief that they may become immortal, by creating one or many non-biological functional copies of their brains, thereby leaving their "biological shell". However, the philosopher and transhumanist [[Susan Schneider (philosopher)|Susan Schneider]] claims that at best, uploading would create a copy of the original person's mind.&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schneider|first=Susan|title=The Philosophy of 'Her'|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/the-philosophy-of-her/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0|accessdate=May 7, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Susan Schneider (philosopher)|Susan Schneider]] agrees that consciousness has a computational basis, but this does not mean we can upload and survive.  According to her views, "uploading" would probably result in the death of the original person's brain, while only outside observers can maintain the illusion of the original person still being alive.  For it is implausible to think that one's consciousness would leave one's brain and travel to a remote location; ordinary physical objects do not behave this way. Ordinary objects (rocks, tables, etc.) are not simultaneously here, and elsewhere. At best, a copy of the original mind is created.&lt;ref name="Schneider"/&gt; [[Neural correlates of consciousness]], a sub-branch of neuroscience, states that consciousness may be thought of as a state-dependent property of some undefined [[Complex systems|complex]], adaptive, and highly interconnected biological system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/190867431|title=Fundamental neuroscience|date=2008|publisher=Elsevier / Academic Press|others=Squire, Larry R.|isbn=9780123740199|edition= 3rd|location=Amsterdam|oclc=190867431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued against such conclusions. For example, Buddhist transhumanist James Hughes has pointed out that this consideration only goes so far: if one believes the self is an illusion, worries about survival are not reasons to avoid uploading,&lt;ref name="The Transhumanist Reader"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=James|title=Transhumanism and Personal Identity|date=2013|publisher=Wiley|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118334299.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Keith Wiley has presented an argument wherein all resulting minds of an uploading procedure are granted equal primacy in their claim to the original identity, such that survival of the self is determined retroactively from a strictly subjective position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wiley|first=Keith|title=Response to Susan Schneider's "Philosophy of 'Her"|url=http://hplusmagazine.com/2014/03/26/response-to-susan-schneiders-the-philosophy-of-her/|accessdate=7 May 2014|newspaper=H+Magazine|date=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WileyK_Taxonomy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiley|first1=Keith|title=A Taxonomy and Metaphysics of Mind-Uploading|date=Sep 2014|publisher=Humanity+ Press and Alautun Press|isbn=978-0692279847|edition= 1st|url=http://alautunpress.com|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have also asserted that consciousness is a part of an extra-biological system that is yet to be discovered and cannot be fully understood under the present constraints of neurobiology. Without the transference of consciousness, true mind-upload or perpetual immortality cannot be practically achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@anthrobot/on-achieving-immortality-3ed1d567f7a2|title=On Achieving Immortality|last=Ruparel|first=Bhavik|date=2018-07-30|website=Bhavik Ruparel|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another potential consequence of mind uploading is that the decision to "upload" may then create a mindless symbol manipulator instead of a conscious mind (see [[philosophical zombie]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1246312/My_Brain_my_Mind_and_I_Some_Philosophical_Problems_of_Mind-Uploading|title=My Brain, my Mind, and I: Some Philosophical Problems of Mind-Uploading|author=Michael Hauskeller|work=academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/you-ll-probably-never-upload-your-mind-into-a-computer-474941498|title=You Might Never Upload Your Brain Into a Computer|author=George Dvorsky|work=io9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Are we to assume that an upload is conscious if it displays behaviors that are highly indicative of consciousness? Are we to assume that an upload is conscious if it verbally insists that it is conscious?&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://degreesofclarity.com/writing/oto_mind_uploading.pdf|title=Seeking normative guidelines for novel future forms of consciousness|author=Brandon Oto|publisher=University of California, Santa Cruz|year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Could there be an absolute upper limit in processing speed above which consciousness cannot be sustained? The mystery of consciousness precludes a definitive answer to this question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goertzel.org/Goertzel_IJMC_Special_Issue.pdf|title=When Should Two Minds Be Considered Versions of One Another?|author=Ben Goertzel |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous scientists, including Kurzweil, strongly believe that determining whether a separate entity is conscious  (with 100% confidence) is fundamentally unknowable, since consciousness is inherently subjective (see [[solipsism]]). Regardless, some scientists strongly believe consciousness is the consequence of computational processes which are substrate-neutral. On the contrary, numerous scientists believe consciousness may be the result of some form of quantum computation dependent on substrate (see [[quantum mind]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hplusmagazine.com/2013/04/21/goertzel-contra-dvorsky-on-mind-uploading/|title=Goertzel Contra Dvorsky on Mind Uploading|date=April 21, 2013|author=Sally Morem|work=h+ Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.terasemcentral.org/docs/Terasem%20Mind%20Uploading%20Experiment%20IJMC.pdf|title=The Terasem Mind Uploading Experiment|author=Martine Rothblatt|pages=141–158|year=2012|journal=International Journal of Machine Consciousness|volume=4|issue=1|doi=10.1142/S1793843012400070|publisher=World Scientific Publishing Company|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827213457/http://www.terasemcentral.org/docs/Terasem%20Mind%20Uploading%20Experiment%20IJMC.pdf|archivedate=2013-08-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://home.millsaps.edu/hopkipd/IJMC-Preprint-HopkinsUploading.pdf|title=Why Uploading Will Not Work, or, the Ghosts Haunting Transhumanism|author=Patrick D.

In light of uncertainty on whether to regard uploads as conscious, Sandberg proposes a cautious approach:&lt;ref name=SandbergEthics2014 /&gt; {{Quote|Principle of assuming the most (PAM): Assume that any emulated system could have the same mental properties as the original system and treat it correspondingly.}}

===Verification issues===
It is argued that if a computational copy of one's mind did exist, it would be impossible for one to verify this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/ta/2015/00000013/00000003/art00006|title=A computational mind cannot recognize itself|author=Jack McKay Fletcher|journal=Technoetic Arts|volume=13|number=3|date=December 2015|pp=261–267(7)|doi=10.1386/tear.13.3.261_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The argument for this stance is the following: for a computational mind to recognize an emulation of itself, it must be capable of deciding whether two [[Turing machine]]s (namely, itself and the proposed emulation) are functionally equivalent. This task is uncomputable due to the [[Lambda calculus#Undecidability of equivalence|undecidability of equivalence]], thus there cannot exist a computational procedure in the mind that is capable of recognizing an emulation of itself.

===Ethical and legal implications===

The process of developing emulation technology raises ethical issues related to [[animal welfare]] and [[artificial consciousness]].&lt;ref name=SandbergEthics2014&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Anders Sandberg|title=Ethics of brain emulations|journal=Journal of Experimental &amp; Theoretical Artificial Intelligence|date=14 Apr 2014|volume=26|issue=3|pages=439–457|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0952813X.2014.895113|doi=10.1080/0952813X.2014.895113|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neuroscience required to develop brain emulation would require animal experimentation, first on invertebrates and then on small mammals before moving on to humans. Sometimes the animals would just need to be euthanized in order to extract, slice, and scan their brains, but sometimes behavioral and ''in vivo'' measures would be required, which might cause pain to living animals.&lt;ref name=SandbergEthics2014 /&gt;

In addition, the resulting animal emulations themselves might suffer, depending on one's views about consciousness.&lt;ref name=SandbergEthics2014 /&gt; Bancroft argues for the plausibility of consciousness in brain simulations on the basis of the "[[Qualia#David Chalmers|fading qualia]]" thought experiment of [[David Chalmers]]. He then concludes:&lt;ref name=Bancroft2013&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Tyler D. Bancroft|title=Ethical Aspects of Computational Neuroscience|journal=Neuroethics|date=Aug 2013|volume=6|issue=2|pages=415–418|doi=10.1007/s12152-012-9163-7|issn=1874-5504}}&lt;/ref&gt; “If, as I argue above, a sufficiently detailed computational simulation of the brain is potentially operationally equivalent to an organic brain, it follows that we must consider extending protections against suffering to simulations.”

It might help reduce emulation suffering to develop virtual equivalents of anaesthesia, as well as to omit processing related to pain and/or consciousness. However, some experiments might require a fully functioning and suffering animal emulation. Animals might also suffer by accident due to flaws and lack of insight into what parts of their brains are suffering.&lt;ref name=SandbergEthics2014 /&gt; Questions also arise regarding the moral status of ''partial'' brain emulations, as well as creating neuromorphic emulations that draw inspiration from biological brains but are built somewhat differently.&lt;ref name=Bancroft2013 /&gt;

Brain emulations could be erased by computer viruses or malware, without need to destroy the underlying hardware. This may make assassination easier than for physical humans. The attacker might take the computing power for its own use.&lt;ref name=EckersleySandberg2013&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Peter Eckersley|author2=Anders Sandberg|title=Is Brain Emulation Dangerous?|journal=Journal of Artificial General Intelligence|date=Dec 2013|volume=4|issue=3|pages=170–194|doi=10.2478/jagi-2013-0011|url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/jagi.2013.4.issue-3/jagi-2013-0011/jagi-2013-0011.xml|issn=1946-0163|bibcode=2013JAGI....4..170E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many questions arise regarding the legal personhood of emulations.&lt;ref name=Muzyka2013 /&gt; Would they be given the rights of biological humans? If a person makes an emulated copy of themselves and then dies, does the emulation inherit their property and official positions? Could the emulation ask to "pull the plug" when its biological version was terminally ill or in a coma? Would it help to treat emulations as adolescents for a few years so that the biological creator would maintain temporary control? Would criminal emulations receive the death penalty, or would they be given forced data modification as a form of "rehabilitation"? Could an upload have marriage and child-care rights?&lt;ref name=Muzyka2013&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kamil Muzyka|title=The Outline of Personhood Law Regarding Artificial Intelligences and Emulated Human Entities|journal=Journal of Artificial General Intelligence|date=Dec 2013|volume=4|issue=3|pages=164–169|doi=10.2478/jagi-2013-0010|url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/jagi.2013.4.issue-3/jagi-2013-0010/jagi-2013-0010.xml|issn=1946-0163|bibcode=2013JAGI....4..164M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If simulated minds would come true and if they were assigned rights of their own, it may be difficult to ensure the protection of "digital human rights".  For example, social science researchers might be tempted to secretly expose simulated minds, or whole isolated societies of simulated minds, to controlled experiments in which many copies of the same minds are exposed (serially or simultaneously) to different test conditions.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Political and economic implications===

Emulations could create a number of conditions that might increase risk of war, including inequality, changes of power dynamics, a possible technological arms race to build emulations first, [[First-mover advantage|first-strike advantages]], strong loyalty and willingness to "die" among emulations, and triggers for racist, xenophobic, and religious prejudice.&lt;ref name=EckersleySandberg2013 /&gt; If emulations run much faster than humans, there might not be enough time for human leaders to make wise decisions or negotiate. It is possible that humans would react violently against growing power of emulations, especially if they depress human wages. Emulations may not trust each other, and even well-intentioned defensive measures [[security dilemma|might be interpreted as offense]].&lt;ref name=EckersleySandberg2013 /&gt;

===Emulation timelines and AI risk===

There are very few feasible technologies that humans have refrained from developing. The neuroscience and computer-hardware technologies that may make brain emulation possible are widely desired for other reasons, and logically their development will continue into the future. Assuming that emulation technology will arrive, a question becomes whether we should accelerate or slow its advance.&lt;ref name=EckersleySandberg2013 /&gt;

Arguments for speeding up brain-emulation research:
* If neuroscience is the bottleneck on brain emulation rather than computing power, emulation advances may be more erratic and unpredictable based on when new scientific discoveries happen.&lt;ref name=EckersleySandberg2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ShulmanSandberg2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shulman|first=Carl|author2=Anders Sandberg|title=Implications of a Software-Limited Singularity|journal=ECAP10: VIII European Conference on Computing and Philosophy|year=2010|url=http://intelligence.org/files/SoftwareLimited.pdf|accessdate=17 May 2014|editor1-first=Klaus|editor1-last=Mainzer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hanson2009 /&gt; Limited computing power would mean the first emulations would run slower and so would be easier to adapt to, and there would be more time for the technology to transition through society.&lt;ref name=Hanson2009&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hanson|first1=Robin|title=Bad Emulation Advance|url=http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/11/bad-emulation-advance.html|website=Overcoming Bias|accessdate=28 June 2014|date=26 Nov 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Improvements in manufacturing, 3D printing, and nanotechnology may accelerate hardware production,&lt;ref name=EckersleySandberg2013 /&gt; which could increase the "computing overhang"&lt;ref name=MuehlhauserSalamon2012&gt;{{cite book|last=Muehlhauser|first=Luke|title=Singularity Hypotheses: A Scientific and Philosophical Assessment|year=2012|publisher=Springer|url=http://intelligence.org/files/IE-EI.pdf|author2=Anna Salamon|editor=Amnon Eden |editor2=Johnny Søraker |editor3=James H. Moor |editor4= Eric Steinhart|chapter=Intelligence Explosion: Evidence and Import}}&lt;/ref&gt; from excess hardware relative to neuroscience.
* If one AI-development group had a lead in emulation technology, it would have more subjective time to win an arms race to build the first superhuman AI. Because it would be less rushed, it would have more freedom to consider AI risks.&lt;ref name=SalamonMuehlhauser2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bostrom2014 /&gt;

Arguments for slowing down brain-emulation research:
* Greater investment in brain emulation and associated cognitive science might enhance the ability of artificial intelligence (AI) researchers to create "neuromorphic" (brain-inspired) algorithms, such as neural networks, reinforcement learning, and hierarchical perception. This could accelerate [[Existential risk from artificial general intelligence|risks from uncontrolled AI]].&lt;ref name=EckersleySandberg2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bostrom2014&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|title=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|chapter=Ch. 14: The strategic picture|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199678112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants at a 2011 AI workshop estimated an 85% probability that neuromorphic AI would arrive before brain emulation. This was based on the idea that brain emulation would require understanding some brain components, and it would be easier to tinker with these than to reconstruct the entire brain in its original form. By a very narrow margin, the participants on balance leaned toward the view that accelerating brain emulation would increase expected AI risk.&lt;ref name=SalamonMuehlhauser2012&gt;{{cite web|author1=Anna Salamon|author2=Luke Muehlhauser|title=Singularity Summit 2011 Workshop Report|url=https://intelligence.org/files/SS11Workshop.pdf|website=Machine Intelligence Research Institute|accessdate=28 June 2014|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Waiting might give society more time to think about the consequences of brain emulation and develop institutions to improve cooperation.&lt;ref name=EckersleySandberg2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bostrom2014 /&gt;

Emulation research would also speed up neuroscience as a whole, which might accelerate medical advances, cognitive enhancement, lie detectors, and capability for [[psychological manipulation]].&lt;ref name=Bostrom2014 /&gt;

Emulations might be easier to control than ''de novo'' AI because

# We understand better human abilities, behavioral tendencies, and vulnerabilities, so control measures might be more intuitive and easier to plan for.&lt;ref name=SalamonMuehlhauser2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bostrom2014 /&gt;
# Emulations could more easily inherit human motivations.&lt;ref name=Bostrom2014 /&gt;
# Emulations are harder to manipulate than ''de novo'' AI, because brains are messy and complicated; this could reduce risks of their rapid takeoff.&lt;ref name=EckersleySandberg2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bostrom2014 /&gt; Also, emulations may be bulkier and require more hardware than AI, which would also slow the speed of a transition.&lt;ref name=Bostrom2014 /&gt; Unlike AI, an emulation wouldn't be able to rapidly expand beyond the size of a human brain.&lt;ref name=Bostrom2014 /&gt; Emulations running at digital speeds would have less intelligence differential vis-à-vis AI and so might more easily control AI.&lt;ref name=Bostrom2014 /&gt;
As counterpoint to these considerations, Bostrom notes some downsides:
# Even if we better understand human behavior, the ''evolution'' of emulation behavior under self-improvement might be much less predictable than the evolution of safe ''de novo'' AI under self-improvement.&lt;ref name=Bostrom2014 /&gt;
# Emulations may not inherit all human motivations. Perhaps they would inherit our darker motivations or would behave abnormally in the unfamiliar environment of cyberspace.&lt;ref name=Bostrom2014 /&gt;
# Even if there's a slow takeoff toward emulations, there would still be a second transition to ''de novo'' AI later on. Two intelligence explosions may mean more total risk.&lt;ref name=Bostrom2014 /&gt;

==Advocates==
[[Ray Kurzweil]], director of engineering at [[Google]], claims to know and foresee that people will be able to "upload" their entire brains to computers and become "digitally immortal" by 2045. Kurzweil made this claim for many years, e.g. during his speech in 2013 at the [[2045 Initiative|Global Futures 2045]] International Congress in New York, which claims to subscribe to a similar set of beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/huffington-post-mind-uploading-digital-immortality-may-be-reality-by-2045-futurists-say|title=Mind uploading &amp; digital immortality may be reality by 2045, futurists say - KurzweilAI|work=kurzweilai.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mind uploading is also advocated by a number of researchers in [[neuroscience]] and [[artificial intelligence]], such as [[Marvin Minsky]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} while he was still alive. In 1993, Joe Strout created a small web site called the Mind Uploading Home Page, and began advocating the idea in [[cryonics]] circles and elsewhere on the net. That site has not been actively updated in recent years, but it has spawned other sites including MindUploading.org, run by [[Randal A. Koene]], who also moderates a mailing list on the topic. These advocates see mind uploading as a medical procedure which could eventually save countless lives.

Many transhumanists look forward to the development and deployment of mind uploading technology, with transhumanists such as [[Nick Bostrom]] predicting that it will become possible within the 21st century due to technological trends such as Moore's law.&lt;ref name=Roadmap/&gt;

[[Michio Kaku]], in collaboration with [[Science (TV network)|Science]], hosted a documentary, ''[[Sci Fi Science: Physics of the Impossible]]'', based on his book ''[[Physics of the Impossible]]''.&amp;nbsp; Episode four, titled "How to Teleport", mentions that mind uploading ''via'' techniques such as [[quantum entanglement]] and whole brain emulation using an advanced [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI machine]] may enable people to be transported to vast distances at near light-speed.

The book ''Beyond Humanity: CyberEvolution and Future Minds'' by [[Gregory S. Paul]] &amp; Earl D. Cox, is about the eventual (and, to the authors, almost inevitable) evolution of computers into [[sentience|sentient]] beings, but also deals with human mind transfer. [[Richard Doyle (actor)|Richard Doyle]]'s ''Wetwares: Experiments in PostVital Living'' deals extensively with uploading from the perspective of distributed embodiment, arguing for example that humans are currently part of the "[[artificial life]] [[phenotype]]". Doyle's vision reverses the polarity on uploading, with artificial life forms such as uploads actively seeking out biological embodiment as part of their reproductive strategy.

== Skeptics == 
Kenneth D. Miller, a professor of neuroscience at Columbia and a co-director of the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, raised doubts about the practicality of mind uploading. His major argument is that reconstructing neurons and their connections is in itself a formidable task, but it is far from being sufficient. Operation of the brain depends on the dynamics of electrical and biochemical signal exchange between neurons; therefore, capturing them in a single "frozen" state may prove insufficient. In addition, the nature of these signals may require modeling down to the molecular level and beyond. Therefore, while not rejecting the idea in principle, Miller believes that the complexity of the "absolute" duplication of an individual mind is insurmountable for the nearest hundreds of years.&lt;ref name="abondonallhopetoupload"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/opinion/sunday/will-you-ever-be-able-to-upload-your-brain.html?_r=2  Will You Ever Be Able to Upload Your Brain?], www.nytimes.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Monster Rancher DS''''', known as {{nihongo|'''''Monster Farm DS 2: Yomigaeru! Master Breeder Densetsu'''''|モンスターファーム DS 2: よみがえる! マースター ブリーダー 伝説}} in Japan, is a [[Life simulation game|life simulation]] [[video game]] developed by [[Cing]] and published by [[UFO Interactive Games]] for the [[Nintendo DS]]. It was released in Japan on August 7, 2008 and in North America on August 3, 2010. The game was not released in Europe.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Monster Rancher DS Gameplay.png|thumb|left|212px|Two monsters fighting against each other in a tournament]]
The game, taking place in the BOMBA region, involves raising, fighting, and breeding monsters. The main character is never seen on screen, but always talks to his apprentice, Cleo, directly. The player chooses his actions and choices through menu options.

===Creating Monsters===
There are two primary methods for creating monsters: drawing pictures in the Magic Field using the touchscreen, and reciting an Incantation using the microphone. Other methods include combining two existing monsters to create a new monster as well as an additional unrevealed method.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

New to the combination process is the "-ish" or "modoki" monster, a [[glitch]] monster whose purpose is to give you a monster when you attempt combinations that are not in the game, and appear as a light blue untextured version of the normal model, and appear as the last monster in each monster's entries in the monster encyclopedia, using the ???-subtype normally used by special monsters.

===Fighting Monsters===
The way you make money, and gain ranks, is by having your monster fight in tournaments. In a fight, your monster starts with a fixed amount of guts, which is basically energy to spend on the moves they know. You can control the monster yourself, or let them fight on their own as they do when they get into a battle in the wild.

Moves can be done in one of three ranges. You can move forward or backward on the battlefield to toggle between the ranges. If you get in very close, you can also push the opponent away from you.&lt;ref name="US Announce"/&gt; A major change from the previous games is that you are able to use the touchscreen to move your monster forward or backwards, as well as to order it to attack.

===Monsters===
Various monsters which have been left out of previous games since ''[[Monster Rancher 2]]'' will be making a return including Monol and Gali.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} There are currently 272 monsters known in the game, including the glitch type monsters.

The main breeds are Abyss, Beaclon, Baku, Centaur, Color Pandora, Dragon, Ducken, Durahan, Falco, Gali, Golem, Hare, Henger, Joker, Lesione, Mew, Mocchi, Monol, Naga, Ogyo, Pancho, Phoenix, Piroro, Pixie, Plant, Suezo, Tiger, Xenon, and Zan.

==Development==
The game was announced on May 23, 2008 and would be released in Japan as ''Monster Farm DS 2: Yomigaeru! Master Breeder Densetsu''. At that time no localization for the first game, ''Monster Farm DS'' had been announced for North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/05/23/monster-rancher-ds-2-announced |title=Monster Rancher DS 2 Announced |author=John Tanaka |date=May 23, 2008 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gave rise to speculation that both games would not be localized in North America at all which would be a first for the series since every past game in the series had been localized with all of the past portable titles: ''[[Monster Rancher Advance]]'' and ''[[Monster Rancher Advance 2]]'' being released in North America. However, on November 10, 2009 this speculation was proven untrue when it was announced that ''Monster Farm DS 2'' would be released in North America as ''Monster Rancher DS'' with the first DS game, ''Monster Farm DS'' not being localized in favor of its sequel. This announcement came a year after its original Japanese release and came as a surprise to many fans who had lost hope.&lt;ref name="US Announce"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4282">On 10 December 2008, Andrew Cunningham was murdered in his caravan in Riverside Road, [[Earlsfield]] in the [[London Borough of Wandsworth]]. Cunningham, a 52-year-old convicted sex offender, was stabbed to death in an attack described as "frenzied" by Deputy Coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe and "sadistic" by Detective Inspector Alison Hepworth of the Homicide and Major Crime Command. 

The crime remains unsolved and the [[Metropolitan Police]] offer a reward of £20,000 for information leading to the identification, arrest and prosecution of those responsible.&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/the-murder-nobody-wants-to-help-solve-1726198.html |title=The murder nobody wants to help solve |author=Mark Hughes |date=1 July 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Cunningham, a father of five, was imprisoned in 2001 for [[statutory rape|unlawful sex]] with a 15-year-old girl. At the time of his murder, he was working as a lorry driver and was living in a caravan outside the haulage company he worked for. 

==Murder==
Police believe Cunningham let his killer into his caravan as there was no sign of forced entry or a struggle. Cunningham was repeatedly stabbed in the chest, throat and neck. His body was found naked with his genitals mutilated. [[pound sterling|£]]6,000 in cash was stolen from the caravan.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;

Police have identified a revenge [[vigilante]] killing as the most likely motive whilst not ruling out a robbery with the possibility the genital mutilation was a ruse. 

The murder took place less than 50 metres from The Corner Pin public house on a night with a Champions League football match and a short distance from a greyhound track that was host to a race that evening. Despite that all witnesses interviewed by police reported having seen or heard no suspicious activity. This led to suggestions in ''[[The Independent]]'' that the crime was "the murder nobody wants to help solve". Detective Chief Inspector Nick Scola told the paper that "There may be people who know something but are refusing to tell us, and are using Mr Cunningham's background, the paedophile tag, to justify it to themselves". Detective Chief Inspector Scola also stated that "...even in a situation like this...taking someone's life is wrong, regardless of that person's background. I would also remind people that there is a killer still out there and a killer is a killer no matter which way you look at it."&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;

After Cunningham's death, his ex-wife told a [[tabloid newspaper]] that "He had what was coming to him. No one should feel sorry for him." One of his daughters stated that she wanted to spit on his grave.

==Coroner's inquest==
In November 2012, Dr Shirley Radcliffe, sitting at the [[Westminster Coroner's Court]], ruled that Cunningham had been unlawfully killed.&lt;ref name=wandsworth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wandsworthguardian.co.uk/news/10039098.Paedophile_was_entertaining_girls_day_before_he_was_murdered/|title=Paedophile was entertaining girls day before he was murdered|website=Wandsworth Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inquest heard that despite interviewing 800 people police had failed to locate his killers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wandsworthguardian.co.uk/news/11641439.Police_renew_appeal_to_find_paedophile_s_killer/|title=Police renew appeal to find paedophile's killer|website=Wandsworth Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court also heard allegations that Cunningham had been seen with three underage girls the day prior to his murder. Rumours had also been spread in the area that Cunningham had sexually assaulted a two-year-old girl, which police found no evidence to support.

Cunningham's sister told the inquest the area in which Cunningham was murdered was "swamped" with [[CCTV]] and she was "dubious as to why they were switched off."&lt;ref name=wandsworth/&gt;

The '''National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI)''' is a [[NASA]]-funded [[consortium]] of institutions studying the health risks related to long-duration [[spaceflight]] and developing solutions to reduce those risks. The NSBRI was founded in 1997. NSBRI's 16,400-square-foot headquarters facility is located in the [[BioScience Research Collaborative]] in [[Houston, Texas]]. The Institute shares the facility with [[Baylor College of Medicine]]'s Center for Space Medicine. The official opening was held March 19, 2012.

Currently, NSBRI has seven teams conducting research at more than 60 institutions around the [[United States]]. [[NASA]] announced in March 2012 a five-year extension of its cooperative agreement with NSBRI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Joshua|first1=Buck|title=CONTRACT RELEASE : C12-013, NASA Extends Cooperative Agreement With NSBRI|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2012/mar/HQ_C12-013_NSBRI_Extended.html|accessdate=28 September 2016|agency=National Aeronautic and Space Administration|date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research programs==
In 2010 and 2011, NSBRI was the only U.S. organization to participate in the [[Mars-500]] Project's 520-day mission simulations with an experiment that monitored the six crew members' rest-activity cycles, performance and psychological responses to determine the extent to which sleep loss, fatigue, stress, mood changes and conflicts occurred during the mission.

===Research Teams===
* Cardiovascular Alterations
* Human Factors and Performance
* Musculoskeletal Alterations
* Neurobehavioral and Psychosocial Factors
* Radiation Effects
* Sensorimotor Adaptation
* Smart Medical Systems and Technology

===Outreach===
NSBRI also has a robust [[education]] and [[outreach]] program. The NSBRI Education and Outreach team won a Stellar Award from the Rotary National Award for Space Achievement Foundation in 2007 for "performance as a nationally recognized, top-tier program that is pioneering new models for exemplary teaching, training and public outreach in support of the Vision for Space Exploration."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rnasa.org/stellar/stellarwinners2007.html |title=2007 Stellar Awards Winners |publisher=Rotary National Award for Space Achievement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pioneer Awards==
During the opening ceremonies, NSBRI President and CEO Dr. Jeffrey P. Sutton and NSBRI Chairman of the Board of Directors Dr. Bobby R. Alford presented U.S. Senator [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]] with the Pioneer Award, the Institute's highest honor, for her support of human spaceflight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nsbri.org/newsflash/indivArticle.asp?id=454&amp;articleID=160 |title=Space research institute honors Senator Hutchison with Pioneer Award |date=19 March 2012 |location=Houston |publisher=NSBRI |first=Brad |last=Thomas |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702134654/http://www.nsbri.org/newsflash/indivArticle.asp?id=454&amp;articleID=160 |archivedate=2 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- another source: http://www.nsbri.org/default/Newsletters/sept2012.html --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10160">'''Nontheist Quakers''' (also known as '''nontheist Friends''' or '''NtFs''') are those who affiliate with, identify with, engage in, or affirm [[Quakers|Quaker]] practices and processes, but who do not necessarily believe in a theistic [[God]], a Supreme Being, the [[divinity|divine]], the [[soul]] or the [[supernatural]]. Like traditional Friends, nontheist Friends are interested in realizing centered [[peace]], simplicity, integrity, community, equality, [[love]], joy, and [[social justice]] in the [[Quakers|Society of Friends]] and beyond.

== Beliefs ==
Quakers in the unprogrammed tradition have recently begun to examine the significance of nontheistic beliefs in the Society of Friends, in the tradition of seeking truth. Non-theism among Quakers probably dates to the 1930s, when some Quakers in California branched off to form the Humanist Society of Friends (today part of the [[American Humanist Association]]), and when [[Henry Cadbury]] professed agnosticism in a 1936 lecture to [[Harvard Divinity School]] students.&lt;ref name=cadbury&gt;Cadbury, Henry, 1936. "[http://www.universalistfriends.org/UF035.html#Cadbury My Personal Religion]." Accessed online: July 17, 2007. Unpublished manuscript in the Quaker Collection at Haverford College; lecture given to Harvard divinity students in 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "non-theistic" was first written in a Quaker publication in 1952 on conscientious objection.&lt;ref name=tatum&gt;Tatum, Lyle (ed.). 1952. "Handbook for Conscientious Objectors." Philadelphia, PA: Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors.&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=June 2018}} As early as 1976, a [[Friends General Conference]] Gathering hosted a well-attended Workshop for Nontheistic Friends (Quakers).&lt;ref name=morgan&gt;Morgan, Robert. 1976. "Report from the Workshop for Non-Theistic Friends – Friends General Conference, Ithaca, NY, June, 1976." (Note at end of report reads: "The author of this report is 'Workshop for Non-Theistic Friends'. The workshop was led by Robert Morgan (1916–1993), a Friend from Pittsburgh PA." Morgan was therefore "recording clerk" for this report).&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a nontheist Friends' website and there are nontheist Quaker study groups.&lt;ref name="nontheistfriends.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nontheistfriends.org/|title=NontheistFriends.org|website=www.nontheistfriends.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Os Cresson began a recent consideration of this issue from [[behaviorist]], [[natural history]], [[materialist]] and [[environmentalist]] perspectives. ''Roots and Flowers of Quaker Nontheism'' is one history. Friendly nontheism also draws on Quaker humanist and universalist traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Cresson, Os [http://www.nontheistfriends.org/article/roots-and-flowers-of-quaker-nontheism/ Roots and Flowers of Quaker Nontheism] NontheistFriends.org, September 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''Godless for God's Sake: Nontheism in Contemporary Quakerism'' offers recent, critical contributions by Quakers.&lt;ref name=boulton&gt;Boulton, David (ed.). 2006. ''Godless for God's Sake: Nontheism in Contemporary Quakerism.'' Dent, UK: Dales Historical Monographs. {{ISBN|0-9511578-6-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Friends engage the implications of [[human evolution]], [[cognitive anthropology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[bodymind]] questions (esp. the "relaxation response"&lt;ref name=benson72&gt;Benson MD, Herbert and Miriam Z. Klipper. 2000 [1972]. The Relaxation Response. Expanded updated edition. Harper. {{ISBN|0-380-81595-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=benson76&gt;Benson MD, Herbert. 1976. [http://www.relaxationresponse.org/steps/ Steps to Elicit the Relaxation Response.] RelaxationResponse.org. From "The Relaxation Response." HarperTorch.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[primatology]], evolutionary [[history]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[biology]] and [[consensus decision-making]], online especially, in terms of Quaker [[nontheism]].

Nontheist Friends tend to share the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (RSOF) historic Quaker peace testimony and support for war resistance and conscientious objection.

There are currently three main nontheist Quakers' web sites, including the Nontheist Friends' Official Website,&lt;ref name="nontheistfriends.org"/&gt; Nontheist Friends Network Website (a listed informal group of Britain Yearly Meeting),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nontheist-quakers.org.uk/|title=Non-theist Friends Network|website=Non-theist Friends Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Nontheist Friends' wiki subject/school at World University and School,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worlduniversity.wikia.com/wiki/Nontheist_Friends_(atheist_Quakers%3F)|title=Nontheist Friends' wiki school at World University and School|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was founded by Scott MacLeod.

Nontheist Friends are a group of individuals, many of whom are affiliated or involved in the unprogrammed tradition in Quakerism. F/friendly nontheists are attempting sympathetically to generate conversation with others who are more comfortable with the traditional and often reiterated language of Quakerism. Some nontheistic f/Friends see significance in this lower-case / upper-case distinction in terms of inclusiveness and friendliness, welcoming both to the ongoing NTF email list conversations. Questioning theism, they wish to examine whether the experience of direct and ongoing inspiration from God ("waiting in the Light") – "So wait upon God in that which is pure. ..."&lt;ref&gt;Royce, Josiah. 1913. "George Fox as a Mystic" Cambridge, MA: The Harvard Theological Review. 6:1:31-59. {{JSTOR|1506970}}.&lt;/ref&gt; – which traditional Quakers understand as informing Silent Meeting and Meeting for Business, might be understood and embraced with different metaphors, language and discourse.

{{Homicide}}

'''Parricide''' ({{lang-la|parricida}}, killer of parents or another close relative) is defined as:
* The act of killing one's father ([[patricide]]),&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd. ed.: parricide: ... killing a near relative (now usually a father)&lt;/ref&gt; or less usually one's mother ([[matricide]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/matricide|title=Definition of MATRICIDE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; or some other close relative, but usually not children ([[infanticide]] or [[filicide]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/infanticide|title=Definition of INFANTICIDE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The act of killing a person (such as the ruler of one's country) who stands in a relationship resembling that of a father&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd. ed.: parricide: ... fig.: the action or crime of killing the ruler of or betraying one's country&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sixth century CE collection of earlier juristical sayings, the [[Digest (Roman law)|''Digest'']], a precise enumeration of the victims' possible relations to the parricide is given by the 3rd century CE lawyer [[Modestinus]]:
{{quote|By the ''lex Pompeia'' on parricides it is laid down that if anyone kills his father, his mother, his grandfather, his grandmother, his brother, his sister, first cousin on his father's side, first cousin on his mother's side, paternal or maternal uncle, paternal (or maternal) aunt, first cousin (male or female) by mother's sister, wife, husband, father-in-law, son-in-law, mother-in-law, (daughter-in-law), stepfather, stepson, stepdaughter, patron, or patroness, or with malicious intent brings this about, shall be liable to the same penalty as that of the ''lex Cornelia'' on murderers. And a mother who kills her son or daughter suffers the penalty of the same statute, as does a grandfather who kills a grandson; and in addition, a person who buys poison to give to his father, even though he is unable to administer it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watson|first1=Alan (ed.)|last2=Robinson|first2=Olivia (tr.)|url=|title=The Digest of Justinian, Volume 4, Book 48|page=335|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=1998|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-8122-2036-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Peter Sellers''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (born '''Richard Henry Sellers'''; 8 September 1925 – 24 July 1980) was an English film actor, comedian and singer. He performed in the BBC Radio comedy series ''[[The Goon Show]]'', featured on a number of hit comic songs and became known to a worldwide audience through his many film characterisations, among them [[Inspector Clouseau|Chief Inspector Clouseau]] in ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|The Pink Panther]]'' series of films.

Born in [[Portsmouth]], Sellers made his stage debut at the [[Kings Theatre, Southsea]], when he was two weeks old. He began accompanying his parents in a variety act that toured the provincial theatres. He first worked as a drummer and toured around England as a member of the [[Entertainments National Service Association]] (ENSA). He developed his mimicry and improvisational skills during a spell in [[Ralph Reader]]'s wartime [[Gang Show]] entertainment troupe, which toured Britain and the Far East. After the war, Sellers made his radio debut in ''ShowTime'', and eventually became a regular performer on various [[BBC radio]] shows. During the early 1950s, Sellers, along with [[Spike Milligan]], [[Harry Secombe]] and [[Michael Bentine]], took part in the successful radio series ''The Goon Show'', which ended in 1960.

Sellers began his film career during the 1950s. Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often [[parody]]ing characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include ''[[I'm All Right Jack]]'' (1959), [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' (1962) and ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964), ''[[What's New, Pussycat?]]'' (1965), ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (1967), ''[[The Party (1968 film)|The Party]]'' (1968), ''[[Being There]]'' (1979) and five films of the ''Pink Panther'' series (1963–78). Sellers's versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. [[Satire]] and [[black comedy|black humour]] were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an [[Academy Award]], twice for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], for his performances in ''Dr. Strangelove'' and ''Being There'', and once for the [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film]] for ''[[The Running Jumping &amp; Standing Still Film]]'' (1959). He won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role]] twice, for ''I'm All Right Jack'' and for the original Pink Panther film, ''The Pink Panther'' (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor&amp;nbsp;– Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] for his role in ''Being There'', and was previously nominated three times in the same category. [[Turner Classic Movies]] calls Sellers "one of the most accomplished comic actors of the late 20th century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Sellers |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/173984%7C124304/Peter-Sellers/biography.html |work=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] |accessdate=14 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024213758/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/173984%7C124304/Peter-Sellers/biography.html |archivedate=24 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his personal life, Sellers struggled with depression and insecurities. An enigmatic figure, he often claimed to have no identity outside the roles that he played. His behaviour was often erratic and compulsive, and he frequently clashed with his directors and co-stars, especially in the mid-1970s when his physical and mental health, together with his alcohol and drug problems, were at their worst. Sellers was married four times, and had three children from his first two marriages. He died as a result of a heart attack in 1980, aged 54. English filmmakers the [[Boulting brothers]] described Sellers as "the greatest comic genius this country has produced since [[Charlie Chaplin|Charles Chaplin]]."&lt;ref name="Boulting" /&gt;

===Early life (1925–35)===

Sellers was born on 8 September 1925, in [[Southsea]], a suburb of [[Portsmouth]]. His parents were [[Yorkshire]]-born William "Bill" Sellers (1900–62) and Agnes Doreen "Peg" (née Marks, 1892–1967). Both were variety entertainers; Peg was in the Ray Sisters troupe.&lt;ref name="Milligan (DNB)" /&gt; Although christened Richard Henry, his parents called him Peter, after his elder [[stillbirth|stillborn]] brother.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=5}} Sellers remained an only child.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=690}} Peg Sellers was related to the [[pugilist]] [[Daniel Mendoza]] (1764–1836), whom Sellers greatly revered, and whose engraving later hung in his office. At one time Sellers planned to use Mendoza's image for his production company's logo.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=9}}

Sellers was two weeks old when he was carried on stage by Dick Henderson, the headline act at the [[Kings Theatre, Southsea|Kings Theatre]] in Southsea: the crowd sang "[[For He's a Jolly Good Fellow]]", which caused the infant to cry.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=25}} The family constantly toured, causing much upheaval and unhappiness in the young Sellers' life.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=9}}

Sellers maintained a very close relationship with his mother, which his friend [[Spike Milligan]] later considered unhealthy for a grown man.{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=45}} Sellers's agent, Dennis Selinger, recalled his first meeting with Peg and Peter Sellers, noting that "Sellers was an immensely shy young man, inclined to be dominated by his mother, but without resentment or objection".{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=57}} As an only child though, he spent much time alone.&lt;ref name="WT1002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-92800508.html |author=Gibson, Eric |title=Behind Inspector Clouseau; The funny, often elusive Peter Sellers and his wives. |work=[[The Washington Times]] |date=13 October 2002 |accessdate=4 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107202958/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-92800508.html |archivedate= 7 November 2012 |df= }} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935 the Sellers family moved to North London and settled in [[Muswell Hill]].{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|p=24}} Although Bill Sellers was Protestant and Peg was Jewish, Sellers attended the North London [[Catholic school|Roman Catholic school]] [[St Aloysius College, London|St. Aloysius College]], run by the [[Brothers of Mercy of Our Lady of Perpetual Help|Brothers of Our Lady of Mercy]].&lt;ref name="Milligan (DNB)" /&gt; The family was not rich, but Peg insisted on an expensive private schooling for her son.{{sfn|Starr|1991|p=84}} According to biographer Peter Evans, Sellers was fascinated, puzzled, and worried by religion from a young age,{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=194}} particularly Catholicism, while [[Roger Lewis]] believed that soon after entering Catholic school, Sellers "discovered he was a Jew—he was someone on the outside of the mysteries of faith".{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=44}} Later in his life, Sellers observed that while his father's faith was according to the [[Church of England]], his mother was [[Jewish]], "and Jews take the faith of their mother."{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=44}} According to Milligan, Sellers held a guilt complex about being Jewish and recalls that Sellers was once reduced to tears when he presented him with a candlestick from a synagogue for Christmas, believing the gesture to be an anti-Jewish slur.{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=194}}
Sellers became a top student at the school, excelling in drawing in particular. However, he was prone to laziness, but his natural talents shielded him from criticism by his teachers.{{sfn|Moritz|1961|p=371}} Sellers recalled that a teacher scolded the other boys for not studying, saying: "The Jewish boy knows his [[catechism]] better than the rest of you!"{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=12}}{{efn|The film critic [[Kenneth Tynan]] noted that Sellers's ambition as an actor was fuelled mainly by "his hatred of [[anti-Semitism]]." This may have spurred his determination to become a great actor or director.{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=11}}}}

===Early performances (1935–39)===
Accompanying his family on the variety show circuit,{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=8}} Sellers learned [[stagecraft]], but received conflicting encouragement from his parents and developed mixed feelings about show business. His father doubted Sellers's abilities in the entertainment field, even suggesting that his son's talents were only enough to become a road sweeper, while Sellers's mother encouraged him continuously.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=18}}

While at St Aloysius College, Sellers began to develop his improvisational skills. He and his closest friend at the time, Bryan Connon, both enjoyed listening to early radio comedy shows. Connon remembers that "Peter got endless pleasure imitating the people in ''[[Monday Night at Eight]]''. He had a gift for improvising dialogue. Sketches, too. I'd be the 'straight man', the 'feed',&amp;nbsp;... I'd cue Peter and he'd do all the radio personalities and chuck in a few voices of his own invention as well."{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=28}}

===Second World War (1939–45)===
With the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in 1939, St Aloysius College was [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]] to [[Cambridgeshire]]. Because his mother did not allow Sellers to go,{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=32}} his formal education ended at fourteen.&lt;ref name="Milligan (DNB)" /&gt; Early in 1940, the family moved to the north [[Devon]] town of [[Ilfracombe]], where Sellers's maternal uncle managed the Victoria Palace Theatre;{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=32}} Sellers got his first job at the theatre, aged fifteen, starting as a caretaker.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=19}} He was steadily promoted, becoming a box office clerk, usher, assistant stage manager and lighting operator. He was also offered some small acting parts.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=19}} Working backstage gave him a chance to study actors such as [[Paul Scofield]]. He became close friends with Derek Altman, and together they launched Sellers's first stage act under the name "Altman and Sellers", consisting of playing [[ukulele]]s, singing, and telling jokes.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=19}}

During his backstage theatre job, Sellers began practising on a set of drums that belonged to the band [[Joe Daniels (jazz drummer)|Joe Daniels]] and his Hot Shots. Daniels noticed his efforts and gave him practical instructions. The instrument greatly suited Sellers's temperament and artistic skills.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=20}} Spike Milligan later noted that Sellers was very proficient on the drums and might have remained a jazz drummer, had he lacked his skills in mimicry and improvisation.&lt;ref name="Milligan (DNB)" /&gt; As the war progressed, Sellers continued to develop his drumming skills, and played with a series of touring bands, including those of [[Oscar Rabin]], [[Henry Hall (bandleader)|Henry Hall]] and [[Waldini]],{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=45}} as well as his father's quartet, before he left and joined a band from [[Blackpool]].{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=22}} Sellers became a member of the [[Entertainments National Service Association]] (ENSA), which provided entertainment for British forces and factory workers during the war.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=22}} Sellers also performed comedy routines at these concerts, including impersonations of [[George Formby]], with Sellers accompanying his own singing on ukulele.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=85}}

In September 1943, he joined the [[Royal Air Force]], although it is unclear whether he volunteered or was conscripted;{{sfnm|1a1=Walker|1y=1981|1p=40|2a1=Sikov|2y=2002|2p=25}} his mother unsuccessfully tried to have him deferred on medical grounds.&lt;ref name="Milligan (DNB)" /&gt; Sellers wanted to become a pilot, but his poor eyesight restricted him to ground staff duties.{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|p=32}} He found these duties dull, so auditioned for Squadron Leader [[Ralph Reader]]'s RAF ''[[Gang Show]]'' entertainment troupe: Reader accepted him and Sellers toured the UK before the troupe was transferred to India.{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=42}} His tour also included [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] and [[Myanmar|Burma]], although the duration of his stay in Asia is unknown, and Sellers may have exaggerated its length.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=26}} He also served in Germany and France after the war.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=26}}
According to [[David Lodge (actor)|David Lodge]], who became friends with Sellers, he was "one of the best performers ever" on the drums and developed a fine ability to impersonate military officers during this period.{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=46}}

=== Early post-war career and ''The Goon Show'' (1946–55) ===
In 1946, Sellers made his final show with ENSA starring in the pantomime ''Jack and the Beanstalk'' at the [[Théâtre Marigny]] in Paris.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=132}} He was posted back to England shortly afterwards to work at the Air Ministry,{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=32}} and [[Demobilisation of the British Armed Forces after the Second World War|demobilised]] later that year.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=132}} On resuming his theatrical career, Sellers could get only sporadic work.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=38}} He was fired after one performance of a comedy routine in [[Peterborough]]; the headline act, Welsh vocalist [[Dorothy Squires]], however, persuaded the management to reinstate him.{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=57}} Sellers also continued his drumming and was billed on his appearance at [[The Hippodrome, Aldershot|The Hippodrome]] in [[Aldershot]] as "Britain's answer to [[Gene Krupa]]".{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=38}} In March 1948 Sellers gained a six-week run at the [[Windmill Theatre]] in London, which predominantly staged [[revue]] acts: he provided the comedy turns in between the nude shows on offer.{{sfnm|1a1=Walker|1y=1981|1p=58|2a1=Sikov|2y=2002|2p=40}}

Sellers wrote to the [[BBC]] in 1948, and was subsequently auditioned. As a result, he made his television debut on 18 March 1948 in ''New To You''. His act, largely based on impressions, was well received, and he returned the following week.{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|p=45}} Frustrated with the slow pace of his career, Sellers telephoned BBC radio producer Roy Speer, pretending to be [[Kenneth Horne]], star of the radio show ''[[Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh]]''. Speer called Sellers a "cheeky young sod" for his efforts, but gave him an audition. This led to his brief appearance on 1 July 1948 on ''ShowTime''{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|pp=47–48}} and subsequently to work on ''Ray's a Laugh'' with comedian [[Ted Ray (comedian)|Ted Ray]].{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=164}} In October 1948, Sellers was a regular radio performer, appearing in ''Starlight Hour'', ''The Gang Show'', ''Henry Hall's Guest Night'' and ''It's Fine To Be Young''.{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|p=48}}

By the end of 1948, the [[BBC Third Programme]] began to broadcast the comedy series ''Third Division'', which starred, among others, [[Harry Secombe]], [[Michael Bentine]] and Sellers.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=46}} One evening, Sellers and Bentine visited the [[Hackney Empire]], where Secombe was performing, and Bentine introduced Sellers to Spike Milligan.{{sfn|Carpenter|2003|p=90}} The four would meet up at Grafton's public house near Victoria, owned by [[Jimmy Grafton]], who was also a BBC script writer. The four comedians dubbed him ''KOGVOS'' (Keeper of Goons and Voice of Sanity){{efn|The meaning of the acronym KOGVOS was flexible: it has also been defined as "King of Goons and Voice of Sanity"&lt;ref name="Barker (DNB)" /&gt; and "King of the Goons Voices Society".{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=55}}}} Grafton later edited some of the first [[The Goon Show|''Goon Shows'']].{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=55}}

In 1949, Sellers started to date Anne Howe,{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=230}}{{efn|Her maiden name was Anne Howe, while her professional name was Anne Hayes.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=231}}}} an Australian actress who lived in London.{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=68}} He proposed to her in April 1950{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=56}} and the couple were married in London on 15 September 1951;{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=57}} their son, [[Michael Sellers (actor)|Michael]], was born on 2 April 1954,{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=71}} and their daughter, Sarah, followed in 1958.{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=98}} Sellers's introduction to film work came in 1950, where he dubbed the voice of [[Alfonso Bedoya]] in ''[[The Black Rose]]''.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=284}} He continued to work with Bentine, Milligan, and Secombe. On 3 February 1951, he made a trial tape entitled ''The Goons'', and sent it to the BBC producer Pat Dixon, who eventually accepted it.

The first ''Goon Show''&lt;ref name="Barker (DNB)" /&gt; was broadcast on 28 May 1951.{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|p=177}} Against their wishes, they appeared under the name ''Crazy People''.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=690}} Sellers appeared in ''The Goons'' until the last programme of the ten-series run, broadcast on 28 January 1960.&lt;ref name="Barker (DNB)" /&gt; Sellers played four main characters—[[Major Bloodnok]], [[Hercules Grytpype-Thynne]], [[Bluebottle (character)|Bluebottle]] and [[Henry Crun and Minnie Bannister|Henry Crun]]—and seventeen minor ones.{{sfn|Wilmut|Grafton|1981|p=116}} Starting with 370,000 listeners, the show eventually reached up to seven million people in Britain,&lt;ref name="Barker (DNB)" /&gt; and was described by one newspaper as "probably the most influential comedy show of all time".&lt;ref name="Cook 27 April 1993"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cook|first=William|title=Radio: Landmarks in radio comedy|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=27 April 1993|location=London|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Sellers, the BBC considers it had the effect of launching his career "on the road to stardom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comedy: The Goon Show |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thegoonshow/ |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=12 August 2012 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111103340/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thegoonshow/ |archivedate=11 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951 the Goons made their feature film debut in ''[[Penny Points to Paradise]]''.&lt;ref name="Brown 26 July 2009"&gt;{{cite web|author=Brown, Mark |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jul/26/goons-film-sellers-milligan-secombe |title=Forgotten film of Goons restored by BFI |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 July 2009 |accessdate=4 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116115623/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jul/26/goons-film-sellers-milligan-secombe |archivedate=16 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sellers and Milligan then penned the script to ''[[Let's Go Crazy (film)|Let's Go Crazy]]'', the earliest film to showcase Sellers's ability to portray a series of different characters within the same film, and he made another appearance opposite his Goons co-stars in the 1952 flop, ''[[Down Among the Z Men]]''.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=72}} In 1954, Sellers was cast opposite [[Sid James]], [[Tony Hancock]], [[Raymond Huntley]], [[Donald Pleasence]] and [[Eric Sykes]] in the [[British Lion Film Corporation]] comedy production, ''[[Orders Are Orders]]''.

After the first day's shooting, Sellers sprained his ankle while leaving a restaurant and could no longer work in the cramped cockpit set.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|pp=192–193}} Kubrick then re-cast Slim Pickens as Kong.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=193}} The three roles Sellers undertook were distinct, "variegated, complex and refined",{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=197}} and critic Alexander Walker considered that these roles "showed his genius at full stretch".{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=119}} Sellers played Muffley as a bland, placid intellectual in the mould of [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]];{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=195}} he played Mandrake as an unflappable Englishman;{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=197}} and Dr. Strangelove, a character influenced by pre-war German cinema, as a wheelchair-bound fanatic.{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=120}} The critic for ''[[The Times]]'' wrote that the film includes, "three remarkable performances from Mr. Peter Sellers, masterly as the President, diverting as a revue-sketch ex-Nazi US Scientist&amp;nbsp;... and acceptable as an RAF officer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Film Comedy about the End of the World|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=30 January 1964|location=London|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the critic from ''The Guardian'' thought his portrayal of the RAF officer alone was, "worth the price of an admission ticket".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Intelligent, subtle, funny 'Dr Strangelove': At the cinema|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=2 March 1964|location=London|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his performance in all three roles, Sellers was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] at the [[37th Academy Awards]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 37th Academy Awards (1965) Nominees and Winners |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1965 |work=Oscar Legacy |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |accessdate=9 July 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031093059/http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1965 |archivedate=31 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Best British Actor award at the 18th British Academy Film Awards.&lt;ref name="BAFTA 64" /&gt;

Between November 1963 and February 1964, Sellers began filming ''[[A Shot in the Dark (1964 film)|A Shot in the Dark]]'',{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=206}} an adaptation of a French play, ''[[L'Idiote]]'' by [[Marcel Achard]].{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=205}} Sellers found the part and the director, [[Anatole Litvak]], uninspiring; the producers brought in Blake Edwards to replace Litvak. Together with writer [[William Peter Blatty]], they turned the script into a Clouseau comedy, also adding Herbert Lom as [[The Pink Panther (film series)|Commissioner Dreyfus]] and [[Burt Kwouk]] as [[The Pink Panther (film series)|Cato]]. During filming, Sellers's relationship with Edwards became strained; the two would often stop speaking to each other during filming, communicating only by the passing of notes.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=210}} Sellers's personality was described by others as difficult and demanding, and he often clashed with fellow actors and directors.&lt;ref name="Milne (1980)" /&gt; Upon its release in late June 1964, [[Bosley Crowther]] noted the "joyously free and facile way" in which Sellers had developed his comedy technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C02E2DB163BE633A25757C2A9609C946591D6CF |author=Crowther, Bosley |title=A Shot in the Dark (1964) |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=24 June 1964 |accessdate=3 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210054953/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C02E2DB163BE633A25757C2A9609C946591D6CF |archivedate=10 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sellers became a close friend of [[Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon]], a photographer who was then married to [[Princess Margaret]].

Following the commercial success of ''What's New Pussycat?'', Charles Feldman again brought together Sellers and Woody Allen for his next project, ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'', which also starred [[Orson Welles]];{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=238}} Sellers signed a $1&amp;nbsp;million contract for the film{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=143}} (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1967}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).{{inflation-fn|US|df=yes}} Seven screenwriters worked on the project,{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=238}} and filming was chaotic.{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=146}} To make matters worse, according to Ekland, Sellers was "so insecure, he won't trust anyone".{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=127}} A poor working relationship quickly developed between Sellers and Welles: Sellers eventually demanded that the two should not share the same set.{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=148}} Sellers left the film before his part was complete.

Sellers's first film appearance of 1968 was a reunion with Blake Edwards for the [[wikt:fish out of water|fish-out-of-water]] comedy [[The Party (1968 film)|''The Party'']], in which he starred alongside [[Claudine Longet]] and [[Denny Miller]]. He appears as Hrundi V. Bakshi, a bungling Indian actor who accidentally receives an invitation to a lavish Hollywood dinner party.

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three stars, remarking that Sellers was "back doing what he does best", although he also said that in Sellers's previous films he had "been at his worst recently".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/i-love-you-alice-b-toklas-1968 |author=Ebert, Roger |title=I Love You, Alice B.

In 1969 Sellers starred opposite [[Ringo Starr]] in the [[Joseph McGrath (film director)|Joseph McGrath]]-directed film ''[[The Magic Christian (film)|The Magic Christian]]''. Sellers portrayed Sir Guy Grand, an eccentric billionaire who plays elaborate [[practical joke]]s on people. The critic Irv Slifkin remarked that the film was a reflection of the cynicism of Peter Sellers, describing the film as a "proto-[[Monty Python|Pythonesque]] adaption of Terry Southern's semi-free-form short novel", and "one of the strangest films to be shown at a gala premiere for Britain's royal family".{{sfn|Slifkin|2004|p=447}} The film, a satire on human nature,{{sfn|Ginibre|Lithgow|Cady|2005|p=296}} was in general viewed negatively by critics.

When he was told he could come on as someone else, he appeared dressed as a member of the [[Gestapo]].{{sfn|Parkinson|2009|p=255}} After a few lines in keeping with his assumed character, he stepped out of the role and settled down and, according to Parkinson himself, "was brilliant, giving the audience an astonishing display of his virtuosity".{{sfn|Parkinson|2009|p=256}} In 1974, Sellers again claimed to have communicated with the long-dead music hall comic Dan Leno, who advised him to return to the role of Clouseau.{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=236}}

In 1974, Sellers portrayed a "sexually voracious" [[Queen Victoria]] in [[Joseph McGrath (film director)|Joseph McGrath]]'s comedic biographical film of the Scottish poet [[William McGonagall]], ''[[The Great McGonagall (film)|The Great McGonagall]]'', starring opposite Milligan and [[Julia Foster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/20706/The-Great-McGonagall/overview |title=The Great McGonagall (1975) |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107122359/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/20706/The-Great-McGonagall/overview |archivedate= 7 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the film was a critical failure, and Sellers's career and life reached an all-time low. As a result, by 1974 he agreed to accept salaries of £100,000 and 10 per cent of the gross to appear in TV productions and advertisements, well below the £1 million he had once commanded per film.{{sfn|Upton|2004|p=56}} In 1973, he appeared in a [[Benson &amp; Hedges]] cinema commercial; in 1975, he appeared in a series of advertisements for [[Trans World Airlines]], in which he played several eccentric characters, including Thrifty McTravel, Jeremy "Piggy" Peak Thyme and an Italian singer, Vito.{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|p=176}} Biographer Michael Starr asserts that Sellers showed enthusiasm towards these roles, {{sfn|Starr|1991|p=185}} although the airline campaign failed commercially.{{sfn|Segrave|2005|p=161}}

A turning point in Sellers's flailing career came in 1974, when he teamed up with Blake Edwards to make ''[[The Return of the Pink Panther]]'', starring alongside [[Christopher Plummer]], Herbert Lom and [[Catherine Schell]].{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=469}} The film was shot on a budget of £3 million and earned $33 million at the box office upon release in May 1975, reinvigorating Sellers's career as an A-list film star and restoring his millionaire status.&lt;ref name="Milligan (DNB)" /&gt;{{sfnm|1a1=Barnes&amp;Noble|1y=2004|1p=828|2a1=Upton|2y=2004|2p=56}} The film earned Sellers a nomination for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor&amp;nbsp;– Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor&amp;nbsp;– Musical or Comedy]] award at the [[33rd Golden Globe Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 22nd Annual Golden Globe Awards (1976)|url=http://cdn.goldenglobes.org/browse/year/1975|work=Golden Globe Awards|publisher=[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]]|accessdate=9 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414205751/http://cdn.goldenglobes.org/browse/year/1975|archivedate=14 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, he followed it with ''[[The Pink Panther Strikes Again]]''. During the filming from February to June 1976, the already fraught relationship between Sellers and Blake Edwards had seriously deteriorated.

His behaviour was regarded as unprofessional and childish, and he frequently threw tantrums, often threatening to abandon projects.{{sfn|Upton|2004|p=56}} Peter Evans mentioned that Sellers was a "volatile and perplexing character [who] left a trail of misery in his private life".&lt;ref name="Evans Dynamite" /&gt; He also noted that Sellers had a "compulsive personality and [was] an eccentric hypochondriac" who became addicted to various medicines aside from his recreational drug habits during this period.&lt;ref name="Evans Dynamite" /&gt; His difficult behaviour during productions was widely reported and made it more difficult for Sellers to get employment in the industry at a time when he most needed the work.&lt;ref name="WT1002" /&gt; Despite Sellers's deep personal problems, ''The Pink Panther Strikes Again'' was well received critically. Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said of Sellers in the film, "There is, too, something most winningly seedy about Mr. Sellers' Clouseau, a fellow who, when he attempts to tear off his clothes in the heat of passion, gets tangled up in his necktie, and who, when he masquerades—for reasons never gone into—as Quasimodo, overinflates his hump with helium."&lt;ref name="NYT76" /&gt; Sellers's performance earned him a further nomination at the [[34th Golden Globe Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 23rd Annual Golden Globe Awards (1977)|url=http://cdn.goldenglobes.org/browse/year/1976|work=Golden Globe Awards|publisher=[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]]|accessdate=9 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414215627/http://cdn.goldenglobes.org/browse/year/1976|archivedate=14 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1976 Sellers began dating actress [[Lynne Frederick]], whom he married on 18 February 1977.{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=192}} Biographer Roger Lewis documents that of all of Sellers's wives, Frederick was the most poorly treated; Julian Upton likened it to a boxing match between a heavyweight and a featherweight, a relationship that "oscillated from ardour to hatred, reconciliation and remorse."{{sfn|Upton|2004|p=58}} Peter Evans claims that Milligan detested his friend's choice of partner and believed she was to blame for his increasing alcohol and cocaine dependency.&lt;ref name="Evans Dynamite" /&gt; On 20 March 1977, Sellers suffered a second major heart attack during a flight from Paris to London; he was subsequently fitted with a [[Artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]].{{sfn|Upton|2004|p=58}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buchan|first=David|title=Sellers 'op'|newspaper=[[Daily Express]]|date=29 March 1977|location=London|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sellers returned from his illness to undertake ''[[Revenge of the Pink Panther]]''; although it was a commercial success, the critics were tiring of Inspector Clouseau.

=== ''Being There'', ''Fu Manchu'' and marital problems (1979–80) ===
In 1979, Sellers starred alongside Lynne Frederick, [[Lionel Jeffries]] and [[Elke Sommer]] in [[Richard Quine]]'s ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda (1979 film)|The Prisoner of Zenda]]''. He portrayed three roles, including King Rudolf IV and King Rudolf V—rulers of the fictional small nation of Ruritania—and Syd Frewin, Rudolf V's half-brother. Upon its release in May 1979, the film was well received; [[Janet Maslin]] of ''The New York Times'' observed how Sellers divided "his energies between a serious character and a funny one, but that it was his serious performance which was more impressive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maslin|first=Janet|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9506EED61439E732A25756C2A9639C946890D6CF|title=The Prisoner of Zenda (1979)|authorlink=Janet Maslin|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=25 May 1979|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Philip French]], for ''The Observer'', was unimpressed by the film, describing it as "a mess of porridge" and stating that "Sellers reveals that he cannot draw the line between the sincere and the sentimental".&lt;ref name="French Zenda" /&gt;

Later in 1979, Sellers starred opposite [[Shirley MacLaine]], [[Melvyn Douglas]] and [[Jack Warden]] in the [[black comedy]] ''[[Being There]]'' as Chance, a simple-minded gardener addicted to watching TV who is regarded as a sage by the rich and powerful.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=357}} In a BBC interview in 1971, Sellers had said that more than anything else, he wanted to play the role, and successfully persuaded the author of the book, [[Jerzy Kosinski]], to allow him and director [[Hal Ashby]] to make the film, provided Kosinski could write the script.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{sfn|Dawson|2009|p=211}} During filming, to remain in character, Sellers refused most interview requests and kept his distance from the other actors.{{sfn|Dawson|2009|p=211}} Sellers considered Chance's walking and voice the character's most important attributes, and in preparing for the role worked alone with a tape recorder or with his wife, and then with Ashby, to perfect the clear enunciation and flat delivery needed to reveal "the childlike mind behind the words".{{sfn|Dawson|2009|p=211}} Sellers described his experience of working on the film as "so humbling, so powerful", and co-star Shirley MacLaine found Sellers "a dream" to work with.{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=204}} Sellers's performance was universally lauded by critics and is considered by critic Danny Smith to be the "crowning triumph of Peter Sellers's remarkable career".&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; Critic [[Frank Rich]] wrote that the acting skill required for this sort of role, with a "schismatic personality that Peter had to convey with strenuous vocal and gestural technique&amp;nbsp;... A lesser actor would have made the character's mental dysfunction flamboyant and drastic&amp;nbsp;... [His] intelligence was always deeper, his onscreen confidence greater, his technique much more finely honed":&lt;ref name="Rich" /&gt; in achieving this, Sellers "makes the film's fantastic premise credible".&lt;ref name="Rich" /&gt; The film earned Sellers a [[National Board of Review Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] award at the [[National Board of Review Awards 1979|51st National Board of Review Awards]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards for 1979 |url=http://www.nbrmp.org/awards/past.cfm?year=1979 |work=NBR Awards |publisher=[[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]] |accessdate=9 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912143237/http://www.nbrmp.org/awards/past.cfm?year=1979 |archivedate=12 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[London Critics Circle Film Awards]] Special Achievement Award, the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] award at the [[1979 New York Film Critics Circle Awards|45th New York Film Critics Circle Awards]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Sellers: The Official Site |url=http://www.petersellers.com/about/awards.html |work=Peter Sellers: Awards |publisher=The Estate of Peter Sellers |accessdate=9 July 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314030303/http://www.petersellers.com/about/awards.html |archivedate=14 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor&amp;nbsp;– Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor&amp;nbsp;– Musical or Comedy]] award at the [[37th Golden Globe Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 37th Annual Golden Globe Awards (1980)|url=http://cdn.goldenglobes.org/browse/year/1979|work=Golden Globe Awards|publisher=[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]]|accessdate=9 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414203800/http://cdn.goldenglobes.org/browse/year/1979|archivedate=14 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Sellers was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] award at the [[52nd Academy Awards]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 52nd Academy Awards (1980) Nominees and Winners |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1980 |work=Oscar Legacy |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |accessdate=9 July 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110134116/http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1980 |archivedate=10 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] award at the [[34th British Academy Film Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BAFTA Awards 1980 |url=http://www.bafta.org/awards-database.html?year=1980&amp;category=false&amp;award=false |work=BAFTA Awards Database |publisher=[[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] |accessdate=9 July 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923113635/http://www.bafta.org/awards-database.html?year=1980&amp;category=false&amp;award=false |archivedate=23 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1980 Sellers asked his fifteen-year-old daughter Victoria what she thought about ''Being There'': she reported later that, "I said yes, I thought it was great. But then I said, 'You looked like a little fat old man'.&amp;nbsp;... he went mad. He threw his drink over me and told me to get the next plane home."{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=374}} His other daughter Sarah told Sellers her thoughts about the incident and he sent her a telegram that read "After what happened this morning with Victoria, I shall be happy if I never hear from you again. I won't tell you what I think of you. It must be obvious. Goodbye, Your Father."{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=374}}

Sellers's last film was ''[[The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu]]'', a comedic re-imagining of the [[Fu Manchu|eponymous adventure novels]] by [[Sax Rohmer]]; Sellers played both police inspector Nayland Smith and Fu Manchu, alongside [[Helen Mirren]] and [[David Tomlinson]]. The production of the film was troublesome before filming started, with two directors—[[Richard Quine]] and [[John Avildsen]]—fired before the script had been completed.{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=242}} Sellers also expressed dissatisfaction with his own portrayal of Manchu{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=212}} with his ill-health often causing delays.{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=213}} Arguments between Sellers and director [[Piers Haggard]] led to Haggard's firing at Sellers's instigation and Sellers took over direction, using his long-time friend David Lodge to direct some sequences.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|pp=370–371}} [[Tom Shales]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described the film as "an indefensibly inept comedy",&lt;ref name="Shales" /&gt; adding that "it is hard to name another good actor who ever made so many bad movies as Sellers, a comedian of great gifts but ferociously faulty judgment. "Manchu" will take its rightful place alongside such colossally ill-advised washouts as ''Tell Me Where It Hurts'', ''The Bobo'' and ''The Prisoner of Zenda''".&lt;ref name="Shales" /&gt;

Sellers's final performances were a series of advertisements for [[Barclays Bank]]. Filmed in April 1980 in Ireland, he played Monty Casino, a Jewish con-man.{{efn|According to biographer Peter Evans, Sellers received criticism for his portrayal of characters interpreted to be Jewish right from ''The Goon Show'' days and the show received complaints accusing them of anti-Semitism. The Monty Casino character was similarly criticised, and Barclays made the decision to immediately cancel the commercial, although, according to them, as a mark of respect upon his death.{{sfnm|1a1=Evans|1y=1980|1pp=194–195|2a1=Lewis|2y=1995|2p=47|3a1=Rigelsford|3y=2004|3p=176}}}} Four adverts were scheduled, but only three were filmed as Sellers collapsed in Dublin, again with heart problems.{{sfnm|1a1=Walker|1y=1981|1p=215|2a1=Sikov|2y=2002|2p=375}} After two days in care—and against the advice of his doctors—he travelled to the [[Cannes Film Festival]], where ''Being There'' was in competition.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|pp=375–376}} Sellers was again ill in Cannes, returning to his residence in [[Gstaad]] to work on the script for his next project, ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|Romance of the Pink Panther]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Evans|1y=1980|1p=246|2a1=Walker|2y=1981|2p=217}} He agreed to undergo an [[Angiography|angiogram]] at the [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in Los Angeles, to see if he was able to undergo open-heart surgery.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=379}} Spike Milligan later considered that Sellers's heart condition had lasted fifteen years and had "made life difficult for him and had a debilitating effect on his personality."&lt;ref name="Milligan (DNB)" /&gt; Sellers's fourth marriage to Frederick collapsed soon after.{{sfnm|1a1=Sellers|1y=1981|1p=222|2a1=Sikov|2y=2002|2p=379}}

Sellers had recently started to rebuild his relationship with his son Michael after the failure of the latter's marriage. Michael later said that "it marked the beginning of an all-too-brief closeness between us."&lt;ref name="Sellers-MoS" /&gt; Sellers admitted to his son that "he hated so many things he had done," including leaving his first wife, Anne, and his infatuation with Sophia Loren.&lt;ref name="Sellers-MoS" /&gt;  In lighter moments, Sellers had joked that his epitaph should read "Star of stage, screen and alimony."{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=336}}

=== Death and subsequent family issues ===
[[File:Peter Sellers ashes, Golders Green - geograph.org.uk - 825499.jpg|thumb|Plaque commemorating Sellers at [[Golders Green Crematorium]]]]

On 21 July 1980 Sellers arrived in London from Geneva. He checked into [[the Dorchester]] hotel, before visiting [[Golders Green Crematorium]] for the first time to see the location of his parents' ashes.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=380}} He had plans to attend a reunion dinner with his ''Goon Show'' partners Spike Milligan and Harry Secombe, scheduled for the evening of 22 July.{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=246}} On the day of the dinner, Sellers took lunch in his hotel suite and shortly afterwards collapsed from a heart attack. He was taken to the [[Middlesex Hospital]], London, and died just after midnight on 24 July 1980, aged 54.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|pp=381–382}}

Following Sellers's death, fellow actor Richard Attenborough said that Sellers "had the genius comparable to Chaplin",&lt;ref name="Penny (1980)" /&gt; while the Boulting brothers considered Sellers as "a man of enormous gifts; and these gifts he gave to the world. For them, he is assured of a place in the history of art as entertainment."&lt;ref name="Boulting" /&gt; Burt Kwouk, who appeared as Cato in the ''Pink Panther'' films, stated that "Peter was a well-loved actor in Britain&amp;nbsp;... the day he died, it seemed that the whole country came to a stop. Everywhere you went, the fact that Peter had died seemed like an umbrella over everything".{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=382}} Director Blake Edwards thought that "Peter was brilliant. He had an enormous facility for finding really unusual, unique facets of the character he was playing".&lt;ref name="D Mirror (1980)" /&gt; Sellers's friend and ''Goon Show'' colleague Spike Milligan was too upset to speak to the press at the time of Sellers's death,&lt;ref name="Merrin (1980)" /&gt; while fellow Goon Harry Secombe said "I'm shattered. Peter was such a tremendous artist. He had so much talent, it just oozed out of him";&lt;ref name="Mason (1980)" /&gt; in dark humour, referring to the missed dinner the Goons had planned, he added, "Anything to avoid paying for dinner".{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=382}} Secombe later declared to journalists "Bluebottle is deaded now".{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=225}} Milligan later said that "it's hard to say this, but he died at the right time."{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=382}} The ''Daily Mail'' described Sellers as "the greatest comic talent of his generation as well as a womanising drug-taker who married four times in a fruitless search for happiness", a "flawed genius" who, once he latched on to a comic idea, "loved nothing more than to carry it to extremes".&lt;ref name=Forbes /&gt;

A private funeral service was held at Golders Green Crematorium on 26 July, conducted by Sellers's old friend, Canon John Hester.{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=246}} Sellers's final joke was the playing of "[[In the Mood]]" by [[Glenn Miller]], a tune he hated.{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|p=7}} His body was cremated and his ashes were interred at the Crematorium. After her death in 1994, the ashes of his widow Lynne Frederick were co-interred with his.&lt;ref name="mail will" /&gt; A memorial service was held at [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] on 8 September 1980—what would have been Sellers's 55th birthday.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=383}} Close friend [[Anthony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon|Lord Snowdon]] read the twenty-third Psalm, Harry Secombe sang "[[Bread of Heaven]]" and the eulogy was read by David Niven.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=383}}

Although Sellers was reportedly in the process of excluding Frederick from his will a week before he died, she inherited almost his entire estate worth an estimated £4.5 million (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|4.5|1980|r=1}}}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} pounds){{inflation-fn|UK|df=yes}} while his children received £800 each&lt;ref name="mail will" /&gt; (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|800|1980}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} pounds).{{inflation-fn|UK|df=yes}} Spike Milligan appealed to her on behalf of Sellers's three children, but she refused to increase the amount.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=384}}{{efn|Frederick subsequently married [[David Frost]]; she divorced him and married a cardiologist, Dr Barry Unger: she died in 1994 after struggling with drug and alcohol dependency.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=384}}}} Sellers's only son, Michael, died of a heart attack at 52 during surgery on 24 July 2006, twenty-six years to the day after his father's death.{{sfn|Sellers|Morecambe|2000|p=}}

After his death, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] tried to continue with ''Romance of the Pink Panther'' and offered the role of Clouseau to [[Dudley Moore]], who turned it down. The studio subsequently returned to Blake Edwards, who was adamant not to recast the character, feeling certain that no one could adequately replace Sellers. In 1982 Edwards released ''[[Trail of the Pink Panther]]'', which was composed entirely of deleted scenes from his past three ''Panther'' films.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=385}} Frederick sued, claiming the use of the clips was a breach of contract; the court awarded her $1{{nbsp}}million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1|1982|r=1}}}} million today), plus 3.15 per cent of the film's profits and 1.36 per cent of its gross revenue.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|pp=385–386}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=$1m damages awarded to widow of Peter Sellers over 'Pink Panther' film|work=[[The Times]]|issue=62147|date=25 May 1985|location=London|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The man you play begins to exist."|source=—Sellers describing how he prepared for his wide range of roles in an October 1962 interview for ''[[Playboy]]''.&lt;ref name="Playboy" /&gt; }}

Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said of the Pink Panther films, "I'm not sure why Mr. Sellers and Mr. Lom are such a hilarious team, though it may be because each is a fine comic actor with a special talent for portraying the sort of all-consuming, epic self-absorption that makes slapstick farce initially acceptable—instead of alarming—and finally so funny."&lt;ref name="NYT76"&gt;{{cite web|author=Canby, Vincent|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C04E3DD133FE334BC4E52DFB467838D669EDE|title=The Pink Panther Strikes Again (1976)|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=16 December 1976|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic [[Elvis Mitchell]] has said that Sellers was one of the few comic geniuses who was able to truly hide behind his characters, giving the audience no sense of what he was really like in real life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Simon, Scott |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-103117053.html |title=Profile: Movie on HBO examines the life of Peter Sellers |publisher=NPR Weekend Edition&amp;nbsp;– Saturday |date=4 December 2004 |accessdate=4 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107203015/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-103117053.html |archivedate= 7 November 2012 |df= }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; A feature of the characterisations undertaken by Sellers is that, regardless of how clumsy or idiotic they are, he ensured that they always retain their dignity.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=164}} On his playing of Clouseau, Sellers said: "I set out to play Clouseau with great dignity because I feel that he thinks he is probably one of the greatest detectives in the world. The original script makes him out to be a complete idiot. I thought a forgivable vanity would humanise him and make him kind of touching."{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|p=97}} 

His [[biographer]], Ed Sikov, notes that because of this retained dignity, Sellers is "the master of playing men who have no idea how ridiculous they are."{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=270}} Social historian Sam Wasson notes the complexity in Sellers's performances in the ''Pink Panther'' films, which has the effect of alienating Clouseau from his environment. Wesson considers that "As 'low' and 'high' comedy rolled into one, it's the performative counterpoint to [[Nineteenth-century theatre#Naturalism and Realism|Edwardian sophisticated naturalism]]".{{sfn|Wasson|2009|p=86}} This combination of "high" and "low", exemplified by Clouseau's attempting to retain dignity after a fall, means that within the film Clouseau was "the sole representative of humanity".{{sfn|Wasson|2009|p=87}} Film critic Dilys Powell also saw the inherent dignity in the parts and wrote that Sellers had a "balance between character and absurdity".&lt;ref name="Powell (1980)" /&gt; Richard Attenborough also thought that because of his sympathy, Sellers could "inject into his characterisations the frailty and substance of a human being".&lt;ref name="Penny (1980)" /&gt;

Author Aaron Sultanik observed that in Sellers's early films, such as ''I'm All Right Jack'', he displays "deft, technical interpretations [that] pinpoint the mechanical nature of his comic characterization", which "...&amp;nbsp;reduces each of his characters to a series of gross, awkward tics".{{sfn|Sultanik|1986|p=86}} Academic Cynthia Baron observed that Sellers's external characterisations led to doubt with reviewers as to whether Sellers's work was "true" acting.{{sfn|Baron|2012|p=138}}{{efn|Baron goes on to note that much of the "true acting" question was due to the "polemical publicity" of [[Lee Strasberg]] that British characterisation led to artificial performances in contrast to method acting.{{sfn|Baron|2012|p=138}}}} Critic [[Tom Milne]] saw a change over Sellers's career and thought that his "comic genius as a character actor was&amp;nbsp;... stifled by his elevation to leading man" and his later films suffered as a result.&lt;ref name="Milne (1980)" /&gt; Sultanik agreed, commenting that Sellers's "exceptional vocal and physical technique" was under-used during his career in the US.{{sfn|Sultanik|1986|p=86}}

Academics Maria Pramaggiore and Tom Wallis remarked that Sellers fits the mould of a technical actor because he displays a mastery of physical characterisation, such as accent or physical trait.{{sfn|Pramaggiore|Wallis|2005|p=86}} Writer and playwright [[John Mortimer]] saw the process for himself when Sellers was about to undertake filming on Mortimer's ''[[The Dock Brief]]'' and could not decide how to play the character of the barrister. By chance he ordered [[Cockle (bivalve)|cockles]] for lunch and the smell brought back a memory of the seaside town of [[Morecambe]]: this gave him "the idea of a faded North Country accent and the suggestion of a scrappy moustache".&lt;ref name="Mortimer (1980)" /&gt; So important was the voice as the starting point for character development, that Sellers would walk around London with a [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape recorder]], recording voices to study at home.{{sfn|Rigelsford|2004|p=72}}

Cohen was considered for the role of Sellers in the biographical film ''[[The Life and Death of Peter Sellers]]''.{{sfn|Saunders|2009|p=22}} The three members of [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]]—[[Michael McKean]], [[Christopher Guest]] and [[Harry Shearer]]—have also cited Sellers as being an influence on them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Molitorisz|first=Sacha|title=Hard rock troubadours turn folk for larks|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=22 July 2003|location=Sydney|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; as has the American talk-show host [[Conan O'Brien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Houpt|first=Simon|title=Conan gets creative with his Canadian invasion|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=7 February 2004|location=Toronto|page=R1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Schwimmer]] is another whose approach was influenced by Sellers: "he could do anything, from Dr Strangelove to Inspector Clouseau.

The stage play ''Being Sellers'' premiered in Australia in 1998, three years after the release of the biography by [[Roger Lewis]], ''The Life and Death of Peter Sellers''.  In 2004, the book was turned into an [[HBO]] [[The Life and Death of Peter Sellers|film with the same title]], starring [[Geoffrey Rush]].

He may have been a brilliant actor, but as a human being he had no saving graces at all".&lt;ref name="BBB - mail" /&gt; Snowdon disagreed with Ekland's verdict, and with the film, and stated that Sellers "had a light touch, a sense of humour, I can't bear to see him portrayed as somebody who was apparently without either&amp;nbsp;... The man on the screen is charmless, humourless and boring—the one thing you could never say about Peter."&lt;ref name="BBB - mail" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3573">{{About|a suspected hoax of a Peruvian gang trafficking in human fat|the South American mythological figure|Pishtaco}}

'''Pishtacos''' is a term [[National Police of Peru|Peruvian police]] has used to refer to alleged Peruvian [[gangsters]] who were suspected of murdering up to 60 people for [[human fat|their fat]], and sold it to intermediaries in [[Lima]], who are thought to have then sold the [[adipose tissue|fat]] to laboratories in [[Europe]] for suspected use in [[cosmetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|title=Gang Killed People For Their Fat: Peruvian Police|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/20/gang-killed-people-for-th_n_364783.html|first=Andrew|last=Whalen|date=November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, General Felix Murga, chief of police forces in Peru, had to take leave from his job when Peruvian ministries reported that the whole story was a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Time Magazine|URL=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1943539,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hoax was apparently passed on to prevent further investigations on [[extrajudicial killing]]s by police forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.20min.ch/news/kreuz_und_quer/story/28472211|title="Körperfett-Morde" stürzen Polizeichef|date=2 December 2009|accessdate=3 December 2009|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details of the hoax==
According to the police, the first suspected gang member, Serapio Marcos, was arrested on November 3, 2009. Three others, Elmer Segundo Castillejos Aguero, Enedina Estela Claudio and ring leader Hilario Cudena Simon, were arrested on November 20. The gang was given the name for the mythological figure, the [[Pishtaco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/americas/11/20/fat.dead.humans.peru/index.html|title=Arrests made in ring that sold human fat, Peru says|publisher=CNN|date=November 21, 2009|accessdate=November 21, 2009|first=Arthur|last=Brice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/20/peru-gang-killing-human-fat|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=November 20, 2009|title=Gang 'killed victims to extract their fat'|first=Rory|last=Carroll}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The police claimed that the suspects told them that they sold the fat at a price of $15,000 per liter, but medical experts cast doubt on that, saying that so much body fat is extracted in routine medical procedures such as [[liposuction]], that there should not be such a high demand for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/11/21/world/main5727429.shtml|title=A Peruvian Black Market in Human Fat? Medical Experts Dispute Lima Police Claims That Gang Murdered Victims, Drained Fat From Bodies to Sell to Cosmetic Makers|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story was that the gang members severed victims' heads, arms and legs, removed organs and suspend torsos from hooks above [[candles]], which warmed the flesh as the fat dripped into tubs below.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

Peruvian police also claimed that they were searching for six additional members of the gang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Peru police: Gang killed people for fat|authorlink=|coauthors=|date=November 20, 2009|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|first=Andrew|last=Whalen|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/L/LT_PERU_MURDER_RING?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT|accessdate=November 21, 2009}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1313">'''Plithotaxis''', from the Greek, πλήΘος, denoting crowd, swarm, or throng. In collective [[cellular migration]], plithotaxis is the tendency for each individual cell within a monolayer to migrate along the local orientation of the maximal [[principal stress]], or equivalently, minimal intercellular [[shear stress]].&lt;ref&gt;Tambe, D.T., Hardin, C., Angelini, T.E., Rajendran, K., Park, C.Y., Serra-Picamal, X., Zhou, E.H., Zaman, M.H., Butler, J.P., Weitz, D.A., Fredberg JJ, Trepat, X, Collective cell guidance by cooperative intercellular forces.

'''''Trends in Cell Biology''''' - 23 July 2011, {{doi|10.1016/j.tcb.2011.06.006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Plithotaxis requires force transmission across many cell-cell junctions and therefore is an [[emergent property]] of the cell group.

'''Pope Saint Paul VI''' ({{lang-la|Paulus VI}}; {{lang-it|Paolo VI}}; born '''Giovanni Battista Enrico Antonio Maria Montini''' ({{IPA-it|dʒoˈvanːi baˈtːista enˈriːko anˈtɔːnjo maˈriːa monˈtiːni}}); 26 September 1897 – 6 August 1978) served as [[Pope]] from 21 June 1963 to his death in 1978.  Succeeding [[John XXIII]], he continued the [[Second Vatican Council]] which he closed in 1965, implementing its numerous reforms, and fostered improved ecumenical relations with [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Protestant churches|Protestants]], which resulted in many historic meetings and agreements.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catholic Church and ecumenism#Since the Second Vatican Council]]&lt;/ref&gt; Montini served in the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Holy See's Secretariat of State]] from 1922 to 1954. While in the Secretariat of State, Montini and [[Domenico Tardini]] were considered as the closest and most influential advisors of [[Pius XII]], who in 1954 named him [[Archbishop of Milan]], the largest Italian diocese. Montini later became the Secretary of the Italian Bishops' Conference. John XXIII elevated him to the [[College of Cardinals]] in 1958, and after the death of John XXIII, Montini was considered one of his most likely successors.{{Sfn| Hebblethwaite|1993|pp=322–23}}

Upon his election to the papacy, Montini took the name Paul VI. He re-convened the Second Vatican Council, which had automatically closed with the death of John XXIII. After the Council had concluded its work, Paul VI took charge of the interpretation and implementation of its mandates, often walking a thin line between the conflicting expectations of various groups within Catholicism. The magnitude and depth of the reforms affecting all fields of Church life during his pontificate exceeded similar reform programmes of his predecessors and successors. Paul VI spoke repeatedly to Marian conventions and [[Mariology of the Catholic Church|mariological]] meetings, visited Marian shrines and issued three [[Mariology of Pope Paul VI|Marian encyclicals]]. Following his famous predecessor [[Ambrose of Milan|Saint Ambrose of Milan]], he named Mary as the [[Mother of the Church]] during the Second Vatican Council.&lt;ref name=InterCom&gt;{{cite book | title=International Theological Commission, Vol II: 1986-2007 | editor-first1=Michael | editor-last1=Sharkey  | editor-first2=Thomas | editor-last2=Weinandy | date=21 August 2009 | isbn=1586172263 | page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul VI described himself as a humble servant for a suffering humanity and demanded significant changes from the rich in North America and Europe in favour of the poor in the Third World.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url= http://storico.radiovaticana.org/en1/storico/2009-11/332896_it_s_not_easy_being_a_christian_says_pope.html|title='It's not Easy Being a Christian', says Pope|publisher=Vatican Radio|place=Rome, [[Italy|IT]]|date=11 August 2009|accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His positions on [[birth control]], promulgated famously in the 1968 encyclical ''[[Humanae vitae]]'' were often contested, especially in Western Europe and North America. The same opposition emerged in reaction to the political aspects of some of his teaching.

Following the standard procedures that lead to sainthood, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] declared that the late pontiff had lived a life of [[heroic virtue]] and conferred the title of [[Venerable]] upon him on 20 December 2012. [[Pope Francis]] beatified him on 19 October 2014 after the recognition of a miracle attributed to his intercession. His liturgical feast is celebrated on the date of his birth on 26 September. Pope Francis canonised Paul VI on 14 October 2018.

==Early life==
[[File:Montinifather.jpg|135px|thumb|left|His father, Giorgio Montini]]
Giovanni Battista Montini was born in the village of [[Concesio]], in the [[province of Brescia]], [[Lombardy]], [[Italy]], in 1897. His father Giorgio Montini was a lawyer, journalist, director of the [[Catholic Action]] and member of the Italian Parliament. His mother was Giudetta Alghisi, from a family of rural nobility. He had two brothers, Francesco Montini, who became a physician, and Lodovico Montini, who became a lawyer and politician.{{Sfn| Lazzarini|1964|pp=20–21}}  On 30 September 1897, he was baptised with the name Giovanni Battista Enrico Antonio Maria Montini.{{Sfn|Lazzarini|1964|p=19}} He attended the ''Cesare Arici'' school, run by the [[Jesuits]], and in 1916 received a diploma from the ''[[Arnaldo da Brescia]]'' public school in [[Brescia]]. His education was often interrupted by bouts of illness.

In 1916, he entered the [[seminary]] to become a Catholic priest. He was ordained priest on 29 May 1920 in Brescia and celebrated his first [[Holy Mass]] in Brescia in the [[Santa Maria delle Grazie, Brescia|Basilica of Santa Maria delle Grazie]].{{Sfn|Lazzarini|1964|p=26}} Montini concluded his studies in [[Milan]] with a doctorate in [[Canon Law]] in the same year.{{Sfn|Franzen|1988|p=419}} Afterwards he studied at the [[Gregorian University]], the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]] and, at the request of [[Giuseppe Pizzardo]] at the ''[[Accademia dei Nobili Ecclesiastici]]''. In 1922, at the age of twenty-five, again at the request of Giuseppe Pizzardo, Montini entered the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]], where he worked under Pizzardo together with [[Francesco Borgongini-Duca]], [[Alfredo Ottaviani]], [[Carlo Grano]], [[Domenico Tardini]] and [[Francis Spellman]].{{Sfn|Lazzarini|1964|p=31}}  Consequently, he never had an appointment as a parish priest. In 1925 he helped found the publishing house Morcelliana in Brescia, focused on promoting a 'Christian-inspired culture'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.morcelliana.it/eng/MENU_NUOVO/OUR_HISTORY/67551.html|title=Our History|publisher=Morcelliana|place=IT|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403101342/http://www.morcelliana.it/eng/MENU_NUOVO/OUR_HISTORY/67551.html|archivedate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vatican career==

===Diplomatic service===
Montini had just one foreign posting in the diplomatic service of the Holy See as Secretary in the office of the papal nuncio to [[Poland]] in 1923. Of the [[nationalism]] he experienced there he wrote: "This form of nationalism treats foreigners as enemies, especially foreigners with whom one has common frontiers. Then one seeks the expansion of one's own country at the expense of the immediate neighbours. People grow up with a feeling of being hemmed in. Peace becomes a transient compromise between wars."{{Sfn|Fappani|Molinari|Montini|1979 |p=404}} He described his experience in Warsaw as "useful, though not always joyful".{{Sfn|Fappani|Molinari|Montini|1979|p=265}} When he became pope, the Communist government of Poland refused him permission to visit Poland on a Marian pilgrimage.

===Roman Curia===
[[File:MontiniMay291920.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Montini on the day of his ordination in 1920]]
His organisational skills led him to a career in the [[Roman Curia]], the papal civil service. In 1931, Pacelli appointed him to teach history at the Pontifical Academy for Diplomats{{Sfn|Franzen|1988|p=419}} In 1937, after his mentor Giuseppe Pizzardo was named a cardinal and was succeeded by [[Domenico Tardini]], Montini was named Substitute for Ordinary Affairs under Cardinal Pacelli, the Secretary of State. His immediate supervisor was [[Domenico Tardini]], with whom he got along well. Pacelli became Pope Pius XII in 1939 and confirmed Montini's appointment as Substitute under the new Cardinal Secretary of State [[Luigi Maglione]]. In that role, roughly that of a chief of staff, he met the pope every morning until 1954 and developed a rather close relationship with him. Of his service to two popes he wrote:
{{Quote|It is true, my service to the pope was not limited to the political or extraordinary affairs according to Vatican language. The goodness of Pope Pius XII opened to me the opportunity to look into the thoughts, even into the soul of this great pontiff. I could quote many details how Pius XII, always using measured and moderate speech, was hiding, nay revealing a noble position of great strength and fearless courage.{{Sfn| Lazzarini|1964|p=58}}}}

When war broke out, Maglione, Tardini, and Montini were the principal figures in the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]] of the Holy See.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Actes et Documents|language=French|trans-title=Acts &amp; documents|volume=I–XI}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} Montini was in charge of taking care of the "ordinary affairs" of the Secretariat of State, which took much of the mornings of every working day. In the afternoon he moved to the third floor into the Office of the Private Secretary of the Pontiff. Pius XII did not have a personal secretary. As did several popes before him, he delegated the secretarial functions he needed to the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]].{{Sfn|Lazzarini|1964|p=57}}  During the war years, thousands of letters from all parts of the world arrived at the desk of the pope, most of them asking for understanding, prayer, and help. Montini's task was to formulate the replies in the name of Pius XII, expressing his empathy, and understanding and providing help, where possible.{{Sfn|Lazzarini|1964|p=57}}

At the request of the pope, Montini created an information office regarding prisoners of war and refugees, which from 1939 until 1947 received almost ten million requests for information about missing persons and produced over eleven million replies.{{Sfn|Pallenberg|1960|p=71}} Montini was several times attacked by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s government for meddling in politics, but the Holy See consistently defended him.{{Sfn|[[James Hebblethwaite|Hebblethwaite]]|1993|p=155}} When Maglione died in 1944, Pius XII appointed Tardini and Montini together as joint heads of [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]], each with the title of Pro-Secretary of State. Montini's admiration was almost filial when he described Pope Pius XII:
{{Quote|His richly cultivated mind, his unusual capacity for thought and study led him to avoid all distractions and every unnecessary relaxation. He wished to enter fully into the history of his own afflicted time: with a deep understanding, that he was himself a part of that history. He wished to participate fully in it, to share his sufferings in his own heart and soul.{{Sfn|Hebblethwaite|1993|p=195}}}}

As Pro-Secretary of State, Montini coordinated the activities of assistance to the persecuted hidden in convents, parishes, seminaries, and in Catholic schools.&lt;ref&gt;Tagliaferri, Lionello. ''The Pope wants ...'', Piacenza, Berti, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 
At the request of the pope, Montini established together with [[Ferdinando Baldelli]] and [[Otto Faller]] the [[Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza]] (''Pontifical Commission for Assistance''), which aided large number of Romans and refugees from everywhere with shelter, food and other material assistance. In Rome alone this organisation distributed almost two million portions of free food in the year 1944.{{Sfn|Pallenberg|1960|p=72}} The Papal Residence of [[Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo|Castel Gandolfo]] was opened to refugees, as was Vatican City in so far as space allowed. Some 15,000 persons lived in Castel Gandolfo alone, supported by the [[Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza]].{{Sfn|Pallenberg|1960|p=72}} At the request of Pius XII, Montini was also involved in the re-establishment of Church Asylum, providing protection to hundreds of Allied soldiers, who had escaped from Axis prison camps, Jews, anti-Fascists, Socialists, Communists, and after the liberation of Rome, German soldiers, partisans, displaced persons and others.{{Sfn|Pallenberg|1960|pp=72–73}} As pope in 1971, Montini turned the [[Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza]] into ''Caritas Italiana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.caritas.it/home_page/who_we_are/00000964_Who_we_are.html|website=Caritas Italiana|accessdate=8 February 2017|title=Who We Are}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archbishop of Milan==
[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Milano, 1962) - BEIC 6356260.jpg|thumb|Cardinal Montini at the opening of the new building of the [[Riunione Adriatica di Sicurtà|RAS]], Milan, 1962. Photo by [[Paolo Monti]].]]
After the death of the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster]], in 1954, Montini was appointed to succeed him as [[Archbishop of Milan]], which made him the Secretary of the [[Italian Episcopal Conference|Italian Bishops Conference]].&lt;ref name="Franzen 420"&gt;{{Harvnb|Franzen|1988|p=420}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Pius XII presented the new Archbishop Giovanni Battista Montini "as his personal gift to Milan". He was consecrated bishop in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] by Cardinal [[Eugène-Gabriel-Gervais-Laurent Tisserant|Eugène Tisserant]], the Dean of the [[College of Cardinals]], since Pius XII was forced to stay in bed due to his severe illness.

Pius XII delivered an address about Montini's appointment from his sick-bed over radio to those assembled in St. Peter's Basilica on 12 December 1954.{{Sfn|Lazzarini|1964|p=169}} Both Montini and the pope had tears in their eyes when Montini parted for his diocese, with its 1,000 churches, 2,500 priests and 3,500,000 souls.{{Sfn|Hebblethwaite|1993|pp=260–62}} On 5 January 1955, Montini formally took possession of his Cathedral of Milan. After a period of settling in, Montini liked his new tasks as archbishop, connecting to all groups of faithful in Milan. He enjoyed meetings with intellectuals, artists and writers.{{Sfn|Franzen|1988|p=420}}

===Montini's philosophy===
[[File:PaulPeterssquare.jpg|150px|thumb|right| Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini walking in Saint Peter's Square in 1962]]
In his first months Montini showed his interest in working conditions and labour issues by personally contacting unions, associations and giving related speeches. Believing that churches are the only non-utilitarian buildings in modern society and a most necessary place of spiritual rest, he initiated the building of over 100 new churches for service and contemplation.{{Sfn|Hebblethwaite|1993|p=266}}

His public speeches were noticed not only in [[Milan]] but also in Rome and elsewhere. Some considered him a liberal, when he asked lay people to love not only Catholics but also schismatics, Protestants, Anglicans, the indifferent, Muslims, pagans, atheists.{{Sfn|Hebblethwaite|1993|p=273}} He gave a friendly welcome to a group of Anglican clergy visiting Milan in 1957 and a subsequently exchanged letters with the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Geoffrey Fisher]].{{Sfn|Hebblethwaite|1993|pp=714–15}}

Pope Pius XII revealed at the 1952 secret consistory that both Montini and Tardini had declined appointments to the cardinalate&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni|last =Pacelli|author-link=Pope Pius XII|contribution=La Allocuzione nel consistorio Segreto del 12 Gennaio 1953|title=Discorsi e Radiomessagi di Sua Santita|language=it|trans-title=Speeches and radio messages from his Holiness|place=[[Vatican City]]|year=1953|page=455}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Biography|publisher=Vatican| place=Rome, IT|contribution-url= http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/biography/documents/hf_p-vi_bio_16071997_biography_en.html|title=Pope Paul VI: 1963–1978|accessdate=2 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and in fact Montini was never to be made a cardinal by Pius XII, who held no consistory and created no cardinals from the time he appointed Montini to Milan and his own death four years later. After Angelo Roncalli became Pope John XXIII, he made Montini a cardinal in December 1958.

Montini and [[Angelo Roncalli]] were considered to be friends, but when Roncalli, as Pope John XXIII announced a new [[Catholic Ecumenical Councils|Ecumenical Council]], Cardinal Montini reacted with disbelief and said to [[Giulio Bevilacqua]]: "This old boy does not know what a hornets nest he is stirring up."{{Sfn|Hebblethwaite|1993|p=284}} He was appointed to the Central Preparatory Commission in 1961. During the Council, Pope John XXIII asked him to live in the Vatican. He was a member of the Commission for Extraordinary Affairs but did not engage himself much in the floor debates on various issues. His main advisor was Monsignore [[Giovanni Colombo]], whom he later appointed to be his successor in Milan{{Sfn|Hebblethwaite|1993|p=296}} The Commission was greatly overshadowed by the insistence of [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]] that the Council complete all its work in one single session before Christmas 1962, to coincide with the 400th anniversary of the [[Council of Trent]], an insistence which may have also been influenced by the Pope's having recently been told that he had cancer.{{Sfn|Hebblethwaite|1993|p=301}}

===Pastoral progressivism===
During his period in Milan, Montini was widely seen as a progressive member of the Catholic hierarchy. He reformed pastoral care, adopting new approaches. He used his authority to ensure that the liturgical reforms of Pius XII were carried out at the local level and employed innovative methods to reach the people of Milan. For example, huge posters announced throughout the city that 1,000 voices would speak to them from 10 to 24 November 1957. More than 500 priests and many bishops, cardinals and lay people delivered 7,000 sermons in the period not only in churches but in factories, meeting halls, houses, courtyards, schools, offices, military barracks, hospitals, hotels and other places, wherever people congregated.{{Sfn|Hebblethwaite|1993|p=275}} His goal was the re-introduction of faith to a city without much religion. "If only we can say Our Father and know what this means, then we would understand the Christian faith."{{Sfn|Hebblethwaite|1993|p=276}}

[[Pius XII]] asked Archbishop Montini to Rome October 1957, where he gave the main presentation to the Second World Congress of Lay Apostolate. Previously as Pro-Secretary of State, he had worked hard to form a unified worldwide organisation of lay people of 58 nations, representing 42 national organisations. He presented them to Pius XII in Rome in 1951. The second meeting in 1957 gave Montini an opportunity to express the lay apostolate in modern terms: "Apostolate means love. We will love all, but especially those, who need help...  We will love our time, our technology, our art, our sports, our world."{{Sfn|Lazzarini|1964|p=63}}

===Cardinal===
[[File:Cardenal Montini.jpg|thumb|left|195px|Montini as the Archbishop of Milan circa 1956]]
Although some cardinals seem to have viewed him as [[papabile]], a likely candidate to become pope, and although he may consequently have received some votes in the [[Papal conclave, 1958|1958 conclave]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Giancalro|last=Zizola|title=Borla|place=Rome|year=1977|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Montini was not yet a cardinal, which made him an unlikely choice.{{Efn|In theory any male Catholic is eligible for election to the papacy. In fact, his photograph was published in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine with the other potential candidates for the papacy in 1958. However, the cardinals in modern times almost always elect a fellow cardinal to the office.}} [[Pope John XXIII|Angelo Roncalli]] was elected pope on 28 October 1958 and took the name John XXIII. On 17 November 1958, [[L'Osservatore Romano]] announced a consistory for the creation of new cardinals. Montini's name led the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=L'Osservatore Romano|date=17 November 1958|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the pope raised Montini to the cardinalate on 15 December 1958, he became [[Cardinal-Priest]] of [[San Martino ai Monti|Ss. Silvestro e Martino ai Monti]]. He appointed him simultaneously to several Vatican congregations which resulted in many visits by Montini to Rome in the coming years.{{Sfn|Lazzarini|1964|p=92}}

As a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]], Montini journeyed to Africa (1962), where he visited [[Ghana]], [[Sudan]], [[Kenya]], [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Congo]], [[Rhodesia]], South Africa, and Nigeria. After this journey, John XXIII called Montini to a private audience for a debriefing on his trip which lasted for several hours. In fifteen other trips he visited [[Brazil]] (1960) and the USA (1960), including New York City, Washington DC, Chicago, the [[University of Notre Dame]] in Indiana, Boston, [[Philadelphia]], and [[Baltimore]]. While a cardinal, he usually vacationed in [[Engelberg Abbey]], a secluded Benedictine monastery in Switzerland.{{Sfn|Lazzarini|1964|pp=90–92}}

===Papal conclave===
{{Main|Papal conclave, 1963}}
Montini was generally seen as the [[Papabile|most likely successor]] to Pope John XXIII because of his closeness to both Popes [[Pius XII]] and John XXIII, his pastoral and administrative background, and his insight and determination.{{Sfn|Duffy|1997|p=275}} John XXIII was not exactly a newcomer to the Vatican, since he had been an official of the Holy See in Rome and until his appointment to Venice was a papal diplomat, but returning to Rome at the age of 76 he may have felt outflanked by the professional [[Roman Curia]] at times; Montini knew its most inner workings well due to the fact that he had worked there for a generation.{{Sfn|Duffy|1997|p=275}}

Unlike the [[papabile]] cardinals [[Giacomo Lercaro]] of [[Bologna]] and [[Giuseppe Siri]] of [[Genoa]], Montini was not identified with either the left or right, nor was he seen as a radical reformer. He was viewed as most likely to continue the [[Second Vatican Council]],{{Sfn|Duffy| 1997|p=275}} which already, without any tangible results, had lasted longer than John XXIII anticipated. John had a vision but "did not have a clear agenda. His rhetoric seems to have had a note of over-optimism, a confidence in progress, which was characteristic of the 1960s."{{Sfn|Duffy|1997|p=272}} When John XXIII died of [[stomach cancer]] on 3 June 1963, this triggered a conclave to elect a new pope.

Montini was elected pope on the sixth ballot of the [[Papal conclave, 1963|papal conclave]] on 21 June and he took the name of "Paul VI". When the [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]] [[Eugène Tisserant]] asked if he accepted the election, Montini said ''"Accepto, in nomine Domini"'' ("I accept, in the name of the Lord"). At one point during the conclave, it was said, Cardinal [[Gustavo Testa]] lost his temper and demanded that opponents of Montini halt their efforts to thwart his election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| work=Madison Catholic Herald |url=http://www.madisoncatholicherald.org/2005-04-21/columns.html |last=Weigel|first=George|title=Conclaves: Surprises abound in the Sistine Chapel|date=21 April 2005|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montini took the name "Paul" in honour of [[Saint Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.osv.com/OSVNewsweekly/Story/TabId/2672/ArtMID/13567/ArticleID/16219/POPE-AND-PROPHET-The-beatification-of-Paul-VI.aspx |title=POPE AND PROPHET: The beatification of Paul VI Ceremony brings new appreciation of a pontiff who was much maligned after Vatican II, Humanae Vitae |last=Bunson |first=Matthew |date=8 October 2014 |publisher=''Our Sunday Visitor'' |access-date=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The white smoke first rose from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel at 11:22 am, Cardinal [[Alfredo Ottaviani]] in his role as [[Protodeacon]], announced to the public the successful election of Montini. When the new pope appeared on the central loggia, he gave the shorter [[episcopal blessing]] as his first [[Apostolic Blessing]] rather than the longer, traditional ''[[Urbi et Orbi]]''.

Of the papacy, Paul VI wrote in his journal: "The position is unique. It brings great solitude. 'I was solitary before, but now my solitude becomes complete and awesome.'"{{Sfn|Hebblethwaite|1993|p=339}}

Less than two years later, on 2 May 1965, Paul addressed a letter to the dean of the College of Cardinals anticipating that his health might make it impossible to function as pope. He wrote that "In case of infirmity, which is believed to be incurable or is of long duration and which impedes us from sufficiently exercising the functions of our apostolic ministry; or in the case of another serious and prolonged impediment", he would renounce his office "both as bishop of Rome as well as head of the same holy Catholic Church".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wooden |first1=Cindy|title=Pope Paul VI prepared 'resignation letter'|url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/9082/pope-paul-vi-prepared-resignation-letter-| accessdate=16 May 2018|work=The Tablet|agency=Catholic News Service|date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reforms of papal ceremonial===
Paul VI did away with much of the regal splendor of the papacy. He was the last pope to date to be [[coronation|crowned]]; his successor [[Pope John Paul I]] substituted an [[papal inauguration|inauguration]] for the [[papal coronation]] (which Paul had substantially modified, but which he left mandatory in his 1975 [[apostolic constitution]] ''[[Romano Pontifici Eligendo]]''). At his coronation Paul wore a [[papal tiara|tiara]] that was a gift from the Archdiocese of Milan. At the end of the second session of the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1963, Paul VI descended the steps of the papal throne in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] and ascended to the altar, on which he laid the tiara as a sign of the renunciation of human glory and power in keeping with the renewed spirit of the council. It was announced that the tiara would be sold and the money obtained would be given to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doty|first1=Robert C.|title=Pope Paul Donates His Jeweled Tiara To Poor of World|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/11/14/pope-paul-donates-his-jeweled-tiara-to-poor-of-world.html|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=New York Times|date=14 November 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purchasers arranged for it to be displayed as a gift to American Catholics in the crypt of  the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]] in Washington, D.C.

In 1968, with the [[motu proprio]] ''[[Pontificalis Domus]]'', he discontinued most of the ceremonial functions of the old Roman nobility at the [[papal court|court]], save for the [[Prince Assistants to the Papal Throne]]. He also abolished the [[Palatine Guard]] and the [[Noble Guard (Vatican)|Noble Guard]], leaving the [[Swiss Guard]] as the sole military order of the Vatican.

===Completion of the Vatican Council===
{{Main|Second Vatican Council}}
[[File:CardinalBea.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Pope Paul VI fully supported Cardinal [[Augustin Bea]], credited with ecumenical breakthroughs during the Second Vatican Council.]]
Paul VI decided to continue [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] (canon law dictates that a council is suspended at the death of a pope), and brought it to completion in 1965. Faced with conflicting interpretations and controversies, he directed the implementation of its reform goals.

====Ecumenical orientation====
{{Main |Pope Paul VI and Ecumenism}}
During Vatican II, the Council Fathers avoided statements which might anger Christians of other faiths.{{Sfn|Hebblethwaite|1993}}{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} Cardinal [[Augustin Bea]], the President of the Christian Unity Secretariat, always had the full support of Paul VI in his attempts to ensure that the Council language was friendly and open to the sensitivities of Protestant and Orthodox Churches, whom he had invited to all sessions at the request of [[Pope John XXIII]]. Bea also was strongly involved in the passage of ''[[Nostra aetate]]'', which regulates the Church's relations with the Jewish faith and members of other religions.{{Efn|28 October 1965.}}

====Dialogue with the world====
After his election as Bishop of Rome, Paul VI first met with the priests in his new diocese. He told them that in Milan he started a dialogue with the modern world and asked them to seek contact with all people from all walks of life. Six days after his election he announced that he would continue Vatican II and convened the opening to take place on 29 September 1963.&lt;ref name="Franzen 420"/&gt; In a radio address to the world, Paul VI recalled the uniqueness of his predecessors, the strength of [[Pius XI]], the wisdom and intelligence of [[Pius XII]] and the love of [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]]. As "his pontifical goals" he mentioned the continuation and completion of Vatican II, the reform of the [[Canon Law]] and improved social peace and justice in the world. The Unity of Christianity would be central to his activities.&lt;ref name="Franzen 420" /&gt;

====The Council priorities of Paul VI====
The pope re-opened the Ecumenical Council on 29 September 1963 giving it four key priorities:
*A better understanding of the Catholic Church
*Church reforms
*Advancing the unity of Christianity
*Dialogue with the world&lt;ref name="Franzen 420" /&gt;

[[File:MontiniKennedy.jpg|255px|thumb|left|Pope Paul VI after his election with the first and only Catholic U.S. president with whom he visited as pope, [[John F. Kennedy]], 2 July 1963]]
He reminded the council fathers that only a few years earlier Pope Pius XII had issued the encyclical ''[[Mystici corporis]]'' about the mystical body of Christ. He asked them not to repeat or create new dogmatic definitions but to explain in simple words how the Church sees itself. He thanked the representatives of other Christian communities for their attendance and asked for their forgiveness if the Catholic Church is guilty for the separation. He also reminded the Council Fathers that many bishops from the east could not attend because the governments in the East did not permit their journeys.{{Sfn |Franzen|1988|pp=421–22}}

[[File:Konzilseroeffnung 1.jpg|255px|thumb|right|The opening of the second session of Vatican II]]

====Third and fourth sessions====
Paul VI opened the third period on 14 September 1964, telling the Council Fathers that he viewed the text about the Church as the most important document to come out from the Council. As the Council discussed the role of bishops in the papacy, Paul VI issued an [[Nota Praevia|explanatory note]] confirming the primacy of the papacy, a step which was viewed by some as meddling in the affairs of the Council{{Sfn|Franzen|1988|p=423}}   American bishops pushed for a speedy resolution on religious freedom, but Paul VI insisted this to be approved together with related texts such as ecumenism.&lt;ref name="Franzen 424"&gt;{{Sfn|Franzen|1988|p=424}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope concluded the session on 21 November 1964, with the formal pronouncement of Mary as [[Mother of the Church]].{{Sfn|Franzen|1988|p=424}}

Between the third and fourth sessions the pope announced reforms in the areas of [[Roman Curia]], revision of [[Canon Law]], regulations for [[interfaith marriage|mixed marriages]] involving several faiths, and [[birth control]] issues. He opened the final session of the council, concelebrating with bishops from countries where the Church was persecuted. Several texts proposed for his approval had to be changed. But all texts were finally agreed upon. The Council was concluded on 8 December 1965, the Feast of the [[Immaculate Conception]].&lt;ref name="Franzen 424" /&gt;

In the final session of the Council, Paul VI announced that he would open the canonisation processes of his immediate predecessors: Pope Pius XII and Pope John XXIII.

====Universal call to holiness====

According to Pope Paul VI, "the most characteristic and ultimate purpose of the teachings of the Council" is the [[universal call to holiness]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19690319_sanctitas-clarior_it.html Motu Proprio Sanctitas Clarior] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302231450/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19690319_sanctitas-clarior_it.html |date=2 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "all the faithful of Christ of whatever rank or status, are called to the fullness of the Christian life and to the perfection of charity; by this holiness as such a more human manner of living is promoted in this earthly society." This teaching is found in Lumen Gentium, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, promulgated by Paul VI on 21 November 1964.

===Church reforms===
[[File:AmbroseOfMilan.jpg|140px|thumb|right|Following his predecessor [[Ambrose of Milan]], Pope Paul VI named [[Veneration of Mary in the Catholic Church|Mary]] the "[[Mother of the Church]]" during [[Vatican II]].]]

====Synod of Bishops====
On 14 September 1965, he established the [[Synod of Bishops (Catholic)|Synod of Bishops]] as a permanent institution of the Church and an advisory body to the papacy. Several meetings were held on specific issues during his pontificate, such as the Synod of Bishops on evangelisation in the modern world, which started 9 September 1974.&lt;ref name="Franzen 425"&gt;{{Harvnb|Franzen|1988|p=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Curia reform====
{{Main|Pope Paul VI's reform of the Roman Curia}}
Pope Paul VI knew the [[Roman Curia]] well, having worked there for a generation from 1922 to 1954. He implemented his reforms in stages. On 1 March 1968, he issued a regulation, a process that had been initiated by Pius XII and continued by John XXIII. On 28 March, with ''Pontificalis Domus'', and in several additional Apostolic Constitutions in the following years, he revamped the entire Curia, which included reduction of bureaucracy, streamlining of existing congregations and a broader representation of non-Italians in the curial positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|language=it|title=Annuario Pontificio|trans-title=Pontifical annuary|year=2005|chapter= Note Storiche|pages=1820 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Age limits and restrictions====
On 6 August 1966, Paul VI asked all bishops to submit their resignations to the pontiff by their 75th birthday. They were not required to do so but "earnestly requested of their own free will to tender their resignation from office".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Montini|first=Giovanni Battista |author-link=Giovanni Montini| url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19660806_ecclesiae-sanctae_en.html|publisher=Holy See |title=Apostolic Letter: Ecclesiae Sanctae |date=15 June 1966| accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He extended this requirement to all cardinals in ''[[Ingravescentem aetatem]]'' on 21 November 1970, with the further provision that cardinals would relinquish their offices in the [[Roman Curia]] upon reaching their 80th birthday.&lt;ref name=IA&gt;{{cite web| last=Montini |first=Giovanni Battista|author-link=Giovanni Montini | url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/it/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19701120_ingravescentem.html |publisher=Holy See |title=Apostolic Letter: Ingravescentem aetatem |date=21 November 1970| accessdate=9 January 2017 | language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; These retirement rules enabled the Pope to fill several positions with younger prelates and reduce the Italian domination of the Roman Curia.{{Sfn|Franzen|1988|p=425}} His 1970 measures also revolutionised papal elections by restricting the right to vote in [[papal conclave]]s to cardinals who had not yet reached their 80th birthday, a class known since then as "cardinal electors". This reduced the power of the Italians and the Curia in the next conclave. Some senior cardinals objected to losing their voting privilege, without effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work= New York Times| accessdate = 9 January 2017 | date = 27 November 1970 | first= Alfred | last = Friendly Jr. | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/27/archives/ottaviani-deplores-papal-action-barring-vote-of-aged-cardinals.html | title = Ottaviani Deplores Papal Action Barring Vote of Aged Cardinals }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | agency = [[UPI|UP]] | accessdate = 9 January 2017 | language = es | title = Crítica de dos Cardenales contra el Papa Paulo VI | date = 26 November 1970 | url = http://www.geocities.ws/verdadunica/pablo_6/ochenta.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Paul VI's measures also limited the number of cardinal-electors to a maximum of 120,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hofmann|first1=Paul|title=Voting for Popes Is Barred to Cardinals Over 80|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/24/archives/voting-for-popes-is-barred-to-cardinals-over-80-prelates-over-80.html|accessdate=10 January 2017|work=New York Times|date=24 November 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; a rule disregarded on several occasions by his successors.&lt;!-- can add instances of exceeding this limit by JPII, Benedict, and Francis --&gt;

====Mass of Paul VI====
{{Main|Mass of Paul VI}}
Reform of the [[liturgy]] had been a part of the [[liturgical movement]]s in the 20th century mainly in France, and Germany which were officially recognised by Pius XII in his encyclical [[Mediator Dei]]. During the pontificate of Pius XII, the Vatican eased regulations on the use of Latin in Catholic liturgies, permitting some use of vernacular languages during baptisms, funerals and other events. In 1951 and 1955, the Easter liturgies underwent revision, most notably including the reintroduction of the [[Easter Triduum]].{{Sfn|Adam|1985 |pp=47–48}} The [[Second Vatican Council]] made no changes to the [[Roman Missal]], but in the document ''Sacrosanctum Concilium'' mandated that a general revision of it take place.  After the Vatican Council, in April 1969, Paul VI approved the "[[Mass of Paul VI|new Order of Mass]]" promulgated in 1970, as stated in the Acta Apostolica Sedis to "end experimentation" with the Mass and which included the introduction of three new Eucharistic Prayers to what was up to then a single [[Roman Canon]].

The Mass of Paul VI was also in Latin but approval was given for the use of [[vernacular]] languages. There had been other instructions issued by the Pope in 1964, 1967, 1968, 1969 and 1970 which centered on the reform of ''all'' liturgies of the Roman Church.{{Sfn|Adam|1985|p=49}}  These major reforms were not welcomed by all and in all countries. The sudden apparent "outlawing" of the [[Tridentine Mass|400-year-old Mass]], the last typical edition of which being promulgated only a few years earlier in 1962 by Paul's predecessor, Pope John XXIII, was not always explained well. Further experimentation with the new Mass by liturgists, such as the usage of pop/folk music (as opposed to the [[Pope Pius X#Tra le sollecitudini and Gregorian chant|Gregorian Chant advocated by Pope Pius X]]), along with concurrent changes in the order of sanctuaries, was viewed by some as vandalism.{{Sfn|Duffy|1997|p=275}} In 2007, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] clarified that the 1962 [[Tridentine Mass|Mass of John XXIII]] and the 1970 Mass of Paul VI are two forms of the same Roman Rite, the first, which had never been "juridically abrogated", now being an "[[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]]", while the other "obviously is and continues to be the normal Form – the Forma ordinaria – of the Eucharistic Liturgy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joseph Ratzinger |date=7 July 2007 |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070707_lettera-vescovi_en.html |type=letter |author-link=Pope Benedict XVI |title=To the Bishops on the occasion of the publication of the motu proprio 'Summorum Pontificum' |publisher=Vatican |place=Rome, IT |accessdate=12 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929015429/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070707_lettera-vescovi_en.html |archivedate=29 September 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations and dialogues===
[[File:PaulVIaudence 1973.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Pope Paul VI during an October 1973 audience]]
To Paul VI, a dialogue with all of humanity was essential not as an aim but as a means to find the truth. Dialogue according to Paul, is based on full equality of all participants. This equality is rooted in the common search for the truth{{Sfn|Guitton|1967|p=172}} He said: "Those who have the truth, are in a position as not having it, because they are forced to search for it every day in a deeper and more perfect way. Those who do not have it, but search for it with their whole heart, have already found it."{{Sfn|Guitton|1967|p=172}}

====Dialogues====
[[File:Jafar Shahidi and Pope Paul VI.jpg|thumb|Pope Paul VI meets [[Jafar Shahidi]], an Iranian Shia cleric.]]
In 1964, Paul VI created a Secretariat for non-Christians, later renamed the [[Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue]] and a year later a new Secretariat (later Pontifical Council) for Dialogue with Non-Believers. This latter was in 1993 incorporated by Pope John Paul II in the Pontifical Council for Culture, which he had established in 1982. In 1971, Paul VI created a papal office for economic development and catastrophic assistance. To foster common bonds with all persons of good will, he decreed an annual peace day to be celebrated on January first of every year. Trying to improve the condition of Christians behind the Iron Curtain, Paul VI engaged in dialogue with Communist authorities at several levels, receiving Foreign Minister [[Andrei Gromyko]] and [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]] [[Nikolai Podgorny]] in 1966 and 1967 in the Vatican. The situation of the Church in Hungary, Poland and Romania, improved during his pontificate.{{Sfn|Franzen|1988|p=427}}

Pope Paul VI became the first pope to visit six continents. He travelled more widely than any of his predecessors, earning the nickname "the Pilgrim Pope". He visited the [[Holy Land]] in 1964 and participated in Eucharistic Congresses in [[Bombay]], India and [[Bogotá]], Colombia. In 1966, he was twice denied permission to visit [[Poland]] for the 1,000th anniversary of the [[Christianization of Poland|introduction of Christianity in Poland]].

===Attempted assassination of Paul VI===
Shortly after arriving at the airport in Manila, Philippines on 27 November 1970, the Pope, closely followed by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and personal aide [[Pasquale Macchi]], who was private secretary to Pope Paul VI, were encountered suddenly by a crew-cut, cassock-clad man who tried to attack the Pope with a knife. Macchi pushed the man away; police identified the would-be assassin as Benjamin Mendoza y Amor, 35, of La Paz, Bolivia. Mendoza was an artist living in the Philippines. The Pontiff continued with his trip and thanked Marcos and Macchi, who both had moved to protect him during the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/News_Photos/view/upi/c3c63bdf79379c9f4ea490fd44bef1a5/Msgr-Pasquale-Macci-foils-assassination-attempt-on-Pope-Paul-VI-in-Manila/|title=Msgr. Pasquale Macci foils assassination attempt on Pope Paul VI in Manila|website=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New diplomacy===
Like his predecessor [[Pius XII]], Paul VI put much emphasis on the dialogue with all nations of the world through establishing diplomatic relations. The number of foreign embassies accredited to the Vatican doubled during his pontificate.&lt;ref name="Franzen 430"&gt;{{Harvnb|Franzen|1988|p=430}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a reflection of a new understanding between Church and State, which had been formulated first by [[Pius XI]] and Pius XII but decreed by Vatican II. The pastoral constitution ''[[Gaudium et spes]]'' stated that the Catholic Church is not bound to any form of government and willing to co-operate with all forms. The Church maintained its right to select bishops on its own without any interference by the State.{{Sfn|Franzen|1991|p=391}}

Pope Paul VI sent one of 73 [[Apollo 11 Goodwill Messages]] to [[NASA]] for the historic first lunar landing. The message still rests on the lunar surface today. It has the [[Psalms|Psalm]] 8 and the pope wrote, "To the Glory of the name of God who gives such power to men, we ardently pray for this wonderful beginning."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U7F6LpwYq04C&amp;pg=PA113 |pages=112–113 |last=Colgrove |first=Rosemary |title=Eye on the Sparrow: The Remarkable Journey of Father Joseph Nisari, Pakistani Priest |publisher=Hillcrest Publishing Group |year=2010 |isbn=9781936400874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theology===

====Mariology====
{{Main|Mariology of Pope Paul VI}}
[[File:Paolo VI e Luciani.jpg|thumb|right|185px|Paul VI with [[Albino Luciani]] (later John Paul I) in [[Venice]]]]
Pope Paul VI made extensive contributions to [[Mariology]] (theological teaching and devotions) during his pontificate. He attempted to present the Marian teachings of the Church in view of her new ecumenical orientation. In his inaugural encyclical ''Ecclesiam suam'' (section below), the pope called Mary the ideal of Christian perfection. He regards "devotion to the Mother of God as of paramount importance in living the life of the Gospel."&lt;ref&gt;''Ecclesiam suam'', 58&lt;/ref&gt;

====Encyclicals====
Paul VI authored seven encyclicals.

;''Ecclesiam suam''
{{Main|Ecclesiam suam}}
''Ecclesiam suam'' was given at St. Peter's, Rome, on the Feast of the Transfiguration, 6 August 1964, the second year of his Pontificate. It is considered an important document, identifying the Catholic Church with the Body of Christ. A later Council document ''Lumen Gentium'' stated that the Church subsists in the Body of Christ, raising questions as to the difference between "is" and "subsists in". Paul VI appealed to "all people of good will" and discussed necessary dialogues within the Church and between the Churches and with atheism.&lt;ref name="Franzen 425" /&gt;

; ''Mense maio''
{{Main|Mense maio}}
The encyclical ''[[Mense maio]]'' (from 29 April 1965) focused on the Virgin Mary, to whom traditionally the month of May is dedicated as the Mother of God. Paul VI writes that Mary is rightly to be regarded as the way by which people are led to Christ. Therefore, the person who encounters Mary cannot help but encounter Christ.&lt;ref&gt;''Mense maio'', 1&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Mysterium fidei''
{{Main|Mysterium fidei (encyclical)}}
On 3 September 1965, Paul VI issued ''Mysterium fidei'', on the mystery of the faith. He opposed relativistic notions which would have given the [[Eucharist]] a symbolic character only. The Church, according to Paul VI, has no reason to give up the deposit of faith in such a vital matter.&lt;ref name="Franzen 425" /&gt;

;''Christi Matri''
{{Main|Christi Matri}}

;''Populorum progressio''
{{Main|Populorum progressio}}
[[File:Paulaudenece1977.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Paul VI at an audience in October 1977]]
''Populorum progressio'', released on 26 March 1967, dealt with the topic of "the development of peoples" and that the economy of the world should serve mankind and not just the few. It touches on a variety of traditional principles of Catholic social teaching: the right to a just wage; the right to security of employment; the right to fair and reasonable working conditions; the right to join a union and strike as a last resort; and the [[universal destination of resources and goods]].

In addition, ''Populorum progressio'' opines that real peace in the world is conditional on justice. He repeats his demands expressed in Bombay in 1964 for a large-scale World Development Organization, as a matter of international justice and peace. He rejected notions to instigate revolution and force in changing economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Franzen 426&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Sacerdotalis caelibatus''
{{Main|Sacerdotalis caelibatus}}
''Sacerdotalis caelibatus'' (Latin for "Of the celibate priesthood"), promulgated on 24 June 1967, defends the Catholic Church's tradition of priestly celibacy in the West. This encyclical was written in the wake of Vatican II, when the Catholic Church was questioning and revising many long-held practices. Priestly celibacy is considered a [[discipline]] rather than [[dogma]], and some had expected that it might be relaxed. In response to these questions, the Pope reaffirms the discipline as a long-held practice with special importance in the Catholic Church. The encyclical ''Sacerdotalis caelibatus'' from 24 June 1967, confirms the traditional Church teaching, that celibacy is an ideal state and continues to be mandatory for Catholic priests. Celibacy symbolises the reality of the kingdom of God amid modern society. The priestly celibacy is closely linked to the sacramental priesthood.&lt;ref name="Franzen 425" /&gt;  However, during his pontificate Paul VI was considered generous in permitting bishops to grant laicisation of priests who wanted to leave the sacerdotal state, a position which was drastically reversed by [[John Paul II]] in 1980 and cemented in the 1983 [[Canon Law]] that only the pope can in exceptional circumstances grant laicisation.

;''Humanae vitae''
{{Main|Humanae vitae}}
Of his seven encyclicals, Pope Paul VI is best known for his encyclical ''Humanae vitae'' (''Of Human Life'', subtitled ''On the Regulation of Birth''), published on 25 July 1968. In this encyclical he reaffirmed the Catholic Church's traditional view of marriage and marital relations and a continued condemnation of artificial [[contraception|birth control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1968/Pope-Paul-VI/Garbage-Strike/12303153093431-7/|title=1968 Year in Review|publisher=[[United Press International]]|accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were two Papal committees and numerous independent experts looking into the latest advancement of science and medicine on the question of artificial birth control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=38825 ''Germain Grisez on "Humanae Vitae," Then and Now''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041111093922/http://www.zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=38825 |date=11 November 2004 }}. Retrieved 2 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; which were noted by the Pope in his encyclical&lt;ref&gt;''Humanae vitae'', 2–8&lt;/ref&gt; The expressed views of Paul VI reflected the teachings of his predecessors, especially [[Pius XI]],&lt;ref&gt;Pius XI, encyc.letter Divini illius Magistri: AAS 22 (1930), 58–61; encyc. letter Casti connubii: AAS 22 (1930), 545–546&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pius XII]]&lt;ref&gt;Discorsi e radiomessaggi di Pio XII, VI, 191–192; to Italian Association of Catholic Midwives: AAS 43 (1951), 835–854&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]]&lt;ref&gt;John XXIII, encyc. letter ''Mater et magistra'': AAS 53 (1961), 457.&lt;/ref&gt;  and never changed, as he repeatedly stated them in the first few years of his Pontificate.&lt;ref&gt;Herder Korrespondenz, Orbis Catholicus Freiburg, Herder Verlag, 1964–1968&lt;/ref&gt;

To the pope as to all his predecessors, marital relations are much more than a union of two people. They constitute a union of the loving couple with a loving God, in which the two persons create a new person materially, while God completes the creation by adding the soul. For this reason, Paul VI teaches in the first sentence of ''[[Humanae vitae]]'' that the transmission of human life is a most serious role in which married people collaborate freely and responsibly with God the Creator.&lt;ref name="Humanae vitae, 1"&gt;{{Citation|title=Humanae vitae|at=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This divine partnership, according to Paul VI, does not allow for arbitrary human decisions, which may limit divine providence. The Pope does not paint an overly romantic picture of marriage: marital relations are a source of great joy, but also of difficulties and hardships.&lt;ref name="Humanae vitae, 1" /&gt; The question of human procreation exceeds in the view of Paul VI specific disciplines such as [[biology]], [[psychology]], [[demography]] or [[sociology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Humanae vitae|at=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this, according to Paul VI, is that married love takes its origin from God, who "is love". From this basic dignity, he defines his position:
{{quote |Love is total—that very special form of personal friendship in which husband and wife generously share everything, allowing no unreasonable exceptions and not thinking solely of their own convenience. Whoever really loves his partner loves not only for what he receives, but loves that partner for the partner's own sake, content to be able to enrich the other with the gift of himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Humanae vitae | at = 8–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The reaction to the encyclical's continued prohibitions of artificial birth control was very mixed. In Italy, Spain, Portugal and Poland, the encyclical was welcomed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Herder Korrespondenz Orbis Catholicus | year = 1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin America, much support developed for the Pope and his encyclical. As World Bank President [[Robert McNamara]] declared at the 1968 [[Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group|Annual Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group]] that countries permitting birth control practices would get preferential access to resources, doctors in [[La Paz]], Bolivia called it insulting that money should be exchanged for the conscience of a Catholic nation. In Colombia, Cardinal archbishop [[Aníbal Muñoz Duque]] declared, if American conditionality undermines Papal teachings, we prefer not to receive one cent.&lt;ref name="Herder 549"&gt;{{Citation|title=Herder Korrespondenz|publisher=Orbis Catholicus|place= Freiburg|year=1968|at=HK 1968 549}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate of Bolivia passed a resolution stating that ''Humanae vitae'' could be discussed in its implications for individual consciences, but was of greatest significance because the papal document defended the rights of developing nations to determine their own population policies.&lt;ref name="Herder 549" /&gt; The [[Jesuit]] Journal ''Sic'' dedicated one edition to the encyclical with supportive contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Sic |volume=31|issue=308|date=October 1968|pages=359–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul VI was concerned but not surprised by the negative reaction in Western Europe and the United States. He fully anticipated this reaction to be a temporary one: "Don't be afraid", he reportedly told [[Edouard Gagnon]] on the eve of the encyclical, "in twenty years time they'll call me a prophet."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=National Catholic Reporter| date=26 August 1988|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; His biography on the Vatican's website notes of his reaffirmations of priestly celibacy and the traditional teaching on contraception that "[t]he controversies over these two pronouncements tended to overshadow the last years of his pontificate".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|publisher=Vatican|place=Rome, IT|contribution-url= http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/biography/documents/hf_p-vi_bio_16071997_biography_en.html|contribution=Biography|title=Pope Paul VI: 1963–1978|accessdate=2 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope John Paul II]] later reaffirmed and expanded upon ''Humanae vitae'' with the encyclical ''[[Evangelium vitae]]''.

===Evangelism===
By taking the name of Paul, the newly-elected Pope, showed his intention to take the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]] as a model for his papal ministry.&lt;ref name=DullesChurchSociety&gt; {{cite book |last1=[[Avery Dulles|Dulles, SJ]] |first1=Avery |title=Church and Society, The McGinley Lectures, 1988–2007|date=2008 |publisher=Fordham University Press |isbn=978-0-8232-2862-1 |pages=546 |edition=Kindle |url=https://www.amazon.com/Church-Society-Laurence-McGinley-1988-2007/dp/0823228622 |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In 1967, when he reorganised the Roman curia, Pope Paul renamed the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith as the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples]].  Pope Paul was the first pope in history to make apostolic journeys to other continents and visited six continents.&lt;ref name=DullesChurchSociety/&gt;.  The Pope chose the theme of [[Evangelism|evangelism]] for the synod of bishops in 1974.  From materials generated by that synod, he composed the 1975 apostolic exhortation on evangelisation, [[Evangelii nuntiandi]]&lt;ref name=DullesChurchSociety/&gt;.

===Ecumenism and ecumenical relations===
After the Council, Paul VI contributed in two ways to the continued growth of ecumenical dialogue. The [[Separated brethren|separated brothers and sisters]], as he called them, were not able to contribute to the Council as invited observers. After the Council, many of them took initiative to seek out their Catholic counterparts and the Pope in Rome, who welcomed such visits. But the Catholic Church itself recognised from the many previous ecumenical encounters, that much needed to be done within, to be an open partner for ecumenism.{{Sfn|Schmidt|pp=811–12}} To those who are entrusted the highest and deepest truth and therefore, so Paul VI, believed that he had the most difficult part to communicate. Ecumenical dialogue, in the view of Paul VI, requires from a Catholic the whole person: one's entire reason, will, and heart.{{Sfn|Guitton|1967|p=177}} Paul VI, like Pius XII before him, was reluctant to give in on a lowest possible point. And yet, Paul felt compelled to admit his ardent Gospel-based desire to be everything to everybody and to help all people{{Sfn|Guitton|1967|p=181}} Being the successor of Peter, he felt the words of Christ, "Do you love me more" like a sharp knife penetrating to the marrow of his soul. These words meant to Paul VI love without limits,{{Sfn|Guitton|1967|p=185}} and they underscore the Church's fundamental approach to ecumenism.

====Orthodox====
[[Image:Paulus VI and Patriarch Athenagoras 1964 Paraguay stamp.jpg|thumb|right|Athenagoras with Paul VI]]


Paul VI visited the Orthodox Patriarchs of Jerusalem and Constantinople in 1964 and 1967. He was the first pope since the ninth century to visit the East, labelling the Eastern Churches as sister Churches.&lt;ref name="Franzen 429"&gt;{{Harvnb|Franzen|1988|p= 429}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the first pope in centuries to meet the heads of various [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] faiths. Notably, his meeting with [[Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I]] in 1964 in [[Jerusalem]] led to rescinding the [[excommunication]]s of the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]], which took place in 1054.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Michael|title=The Vatican|date=2014|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=London|isbn=9780756689001|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a significant step towards restoring communion between Rome and Constantinople. It produced the [[Catholic-Orthodox Joint declaration of 1965]], which was read out on 7 December 1965, simultaneously at a public meeting of the Second Vatican Council in Rome and at a special ceremony in Istanbul. The declaration did not end the schism, but showed a desire for greater reconciliation between the two churches.&lt;ref name="Franzen 429" /&gt;  In May 1973, the Coptic Patriarch [[Shenouda III]] of Alexandria visited the Vatican, where he met three times with Pope Paul VI. A common declaration and a joint [[Creed]] issued after the visit proclaimed unity in a number of theological issues,&lt;ref name="Franzen 430" /&gt; though also that other theological differences "since the year 451" "cannot be ignored" while both traditions work to a greater unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/anc-orient-ch-docs/rc_pc_christuni_doc_19730510_copti_en.html |title=Common Declaration of Pope Paul VI and of the Pope of Alexandria Shenouda III |last=Paul VI |last2=Shenouda III |date=10 May 1973 |website=Vatican.va |publisher= |access-date=19 September 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050418033834/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/anc-orient-ch-docs/rc_pc_christuni_doc_19730510_copti_en.html |archivedate=18 April 2005  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anglicans====
Paul VI was the first pope to receive an [[Anglican]] [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Michael Ramsey]], in official audience as Head of Church, after the private audience visit of Archbishop [[Geoffrey Fisher]] to [[Pope John XXIII]] on 2 December 1960.{{Sfn | Guitton | 1967 | p  = 198}}  Ramsey met Paul three times during his visit and opened the Anglican Centre in Rome to increase their mutual knowledge.&lt;ref name="Schmidt 813"&gt;Schmidt 813&lt;/ref&gt;  He praised Paul VI{{Efn | And John XXIII.}} and his contributions in the service of unity.&lt;ref name="Schmidt 813" /&gt; Paul replied that "by entering into our house, you are entering your own house, we are happy to open our door and heart to you."&lt;ref name="Schmidt 813" /&gt; The two Church leaders signed a common declaration, which put an end to the disputes of the past and outlined a common agenda for the future.

Cardinal [[Augustin Bea]], the head of the [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity|Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity]], added at the end of the visit, "Let us move forward in Christ. God wants it. Humanity is waiting for it."&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt 814&lt;/ref&gt; Unmoved by a harsh condemnation by the Congregation of Faith on mixed marriages precisely at this time of the visit, Paul VI and Ramsey appointed a preparatory commission which was to put the common agenda into practice on such issues as mixed marriages. This resulted in a joint Malta declaration, the first joint agreement on the [[Creed]] since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt 815&lt;/ref&gt; Paul VI was a good friend of the Anglican Church, which he described as "our beloved sister Church". This description was unique to Paul and not used by later popes.&lt;!--- [[John Paul II]]. In [[Dominus Jesus]] and [[Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070629_responsa-quaestiones_en.html|title=Responses to Some Questions Regarding Certain Aspects of the Doctrine on the Church|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; denied Church character to Anglican and Protestant churches because Catholics do not recognise their [[apostolic succession]].--&gt;

====Protestants====
In 1965, Paul VI decided on the creation of a joint working group with the [[World Council of Churches]] to map all possible avenues of dialogue and co-operation. In the following three years, eight sessions were held which resulted in many joint proposals.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt 822–824&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed to work closely together in areas of social justice and development and Third World Issues such as hunger and poverty. On the religious side, it was agreed to share together in the [[Week of Prayer for Christian Unity]], to be held every year. The joint working group was to prepare texts which were to be used by all Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt 826&lt;/ref&gt;  On 19 July 1968, the meeting of the World Council of Churches took place in [[Uppsala]], Sweden, which Pope Paul called a sign of the times. He sent his blessing in an ecumenical manner: "May the Lord bless everything you do for the case of Christian Unity."&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt 827.&lt;/ref&gt; The World Council of Churches decided on including Catholic theologians in its committees, provided they have the backing of the Vatican.

The [[Lutheran]]s were the first Protestant Church offering a dialogue to the Catholic Church in September 1964 in [[Reykjavík]], Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt 830,&lt;/ref&gt; It resulted in joint study groups of several issues. The dialogue with the [[Methodist Church]] began October 1965, after its representatives officially applauded remarkable changes, friendship and co-operation of the past five years. The [[Reformed Church]]es entered four years later into a dialogue with the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt 831&lt;/ref&gt; The President of the [[Lutheran World Federation]] and member of the central committee of the World Council of Churches [[Fredrik A. Schiotz]] stated during the 450th anniversary of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], that earlier commemorations were viewed almost as a triumph. Reformation should be celebrated as a thanksgiving to God, his truth and his renewed life. He welcomed the announcement of Pope Paul VI to celebrate the 1900th anniversary of the death of the [[Apostle Peter]] and [[Apostle Paul]], and promised the participation and co-operation in the festivities.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt 833&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul VI supported the new-found harmony and co-operation with Protestants on so many levels. When Cardinal [[Augustin Bea]] went to see him for permission for a joint Catholic-Protestant translation of the Bible with Protestant Bible societies, the pope walked towards him and exclaimed, "as far as the cooperation with [[Bible society|Bible societies]] is concerned, I am totally in favour."&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt 835&lt;/ref&gt; He issued a formal approval on [[Pentecost]] 1967, the feast on which the [[Holy Spirit]] descended on the Christians, overcoming all linguistic difficulties, according to Christian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt 837&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beatifications and canonisations===
{{Main|List of people declared venerable by Pope Paul VI|List of people beatified by Pope Paul VI|List of saints canonized by Pope Paul VI}}
Paul VI beatified a total of 38 individuals in his pontificate and he canonised 84 saints in 21 causes. Among the beatifications included [[Maximilian Kolbe]] (1971) and the [[Korean Martyrs]] (1968). He canonised saints such as [[Nikola Tavelić]] (1970) and the [[Ugandan Martyrs]] (1964).

===Consistories===
[[File:Papa Paolo VI consegna l'anello cardinalizio a Joseph Ratzinger.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Paul VI makes Joseph Ratzinger (future [[Pope Benedict XVI]]) a cardinal in 1977.]]
{{Main|Cardinals created by Paul VI}}
Pope Paul VI held six [[Papal consistory|consistories]] between 1965 and 1977 that raised 143 men to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinalate]] in his fifteen years as pope:
* 22 February 1965, 27 cardinals
* 26 June 1967, 27 cardinals
* 28 April 1969, 34 cardinals
* 5 March 1973, 30 cardinals
* 24 May 1976, 20 cardinals
* 27 June 1977, 4 cardinals

The next three popes were created [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] by him. His immediate successor, Albino Luciani, who took the name [[John Paul I]], was created a cardinal in the consistory of 5 March 1973. [[Karol Wojtyła]] (John Paul II) was created a cardinal in the consistory of 26 June 1967. [[Joseph Ratzinger]] (Benedict XVI) was created a cardinal in the small four-appointment consistory of 27 June 1977.{{Sfn|Hebblethwaite|1993|p=669}}

With the six consistories, Paul VI continued the internationalisation policies started by Pius XII in 1946 and continued by John XXIII. In his 1976 consistory, five of twenty cardinals originated from Africa, one of them a son of a tribal chief with fifty wives.{{Sfn|Hebblethwaite|1993|p=669}} Several prominent Latin Americans like [[Eduardo Francisco Pironio]] of Argentina; [[Luis Aponte Martinez]] of [[Puerto Rico]], [[Eugênio de Araújo Sales]] and [[Aloisio Lorscheider]] from Brazil were also elevated by him. There were voices within the Church at the time saying that the European period of the Church was coming to a close, a view shared by Britain's Cardinal [[Basil Hume]].{{Sfn|Hebblethwaite|1993|p=669}} At the same time, the members of the College of Cardinals lost some of their previous influences, after Paul VI decreed, that membership by bishops in committees and other bodies of the Roman Curia would not be limited to cardinals. The age limit of eighty years imposed by the Pope, a numerical increase of Cardinals by almost 100%, and a reform of the formal dress of the "Princes of the Church" further contributed to a service-oriented perception of Cardinals under his pontificate. The increased number of Cardinals from the Third World and the papal emphasis on related issues was nevertheless welcomed by many in Western Europe.{{Sfn|Hebblethwaite|1993|p=669}}

==Final years and death==

===Rumours of homosexuality and denial===
In 1976 Paul VI became the first pontiff in the modern era to deny the accusation of [[Homosexuality and Catholicism|homosexuality]]. On 29 December 1975, the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a document entitled ''Persona Humana: Declaration on Certain Questions concerning Sexual Ethics'', that reaffirmed Church teaching that pre or extra-marital sex, homosexual activity, and masturbation are sinful acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19751229_persona-humana_en.html|title=Persona Humana - Declaration on Certain Questions Concerning Sexual Ethics|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=Christopher Hitchens on the death of Pope Paul VI |work=New Statesman |date=28 February 2013 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/religion/2013/02/christopher-hitchens-death-pope-paul-vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[Roger Peyrefitte]], who had already written in two of his books that Paul VI had a longtime homosexual relationship, repeated his charges in a magazine interview with a French gay magazine that, when reprinted in Italian, brought the rumours to a wider public and caused an uproar. He said that the pope was a hypocrite who had a longtime sexual relationship with an actor.&lt;ref&gt;Peyrefitte, Roger ''Mea culpa?

In a brief address to a crowd of approximately 20,000 in St Peters Square on 18 April, Paul VI called the charges "horrible and slanderous insinuations" and appealed for prayers on his behalf. Special prayers for the pope were said in all Italian Catholic churches in "a day of consolation".&lt;ref name="Observer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Posner" /&gt;{{efn|In 1984, [[Paul Hofmann]], a former correspondent for ''[[The New York Times]]'', repeated the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffman |first= Paul | title=Oh Vatican!

In 1994, Franco Bellegrandi, a former Vatican honour chamberlain and correspondent for the Vatican newspaper ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'', alleged that Paul VI had been blackmailed and had promoted other gay men to positions of power within the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bellegrandi |first= Franco |title=Nichita Roncalli - Controvita di un Papa| location= Rome |publisher= Editizioni Internazionale di Letterature e Scienze | date= 1994 |pages= 85–86, 91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the newspaper ''L'Espresso''  confirmed the blackmail story based on the private papers of police commander General Giorgio Manes.

===Health===
Paul VI had been in good health prior to his pontifical election. His health following his papal election took a turn when he needed to undergo a serious operation to treat an enlarged [[prostate]]. The pope procrastinated in this but relented in November 1967; he was operated on a simple table in an improvised operating theatre in the papal apartments by a team led by Professor Pietro Valdoni. The Vatican was delicate in their description of what the pope underwent and referred to it as "the malaise from which the Holy Father had been suffering for weeks". As a result of the delay in having the operation, the pope had to wear a [[catheter]] for a period following the operation and still was by December.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.americamagazine.org/content/all-things/pope-and-president-paul-vi-and-lyndon-b-johnson|title=Pope and President, Paul VI and Lyndon B. Johnson: Christmas on the Tiber, Texas Style|date=25 September 2015|author=Joseph McAuley|publisher=America Magazine|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pope discussed business from his bed about 48 hours after the operation with Cardinal Amleto Cicognani and at that point was off [[intravenous feeding]] in favour of orange juice and hot broth. Cardinal Cicognani said the pope was "in good general condition" and that he spoke in a "clear and firm voice". The pope's two brothers also visited him at his bedside following a "tranquil night" for the pope. The doctors also reported the pope's condition to have been "excellent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=DS19671106.2.4|title=Desert Sun 6 November 1967 — California Digital Newspaper Collection|website=cdnc.ucr.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of Aldo Moro===

[[File:Negativos_2934.jpg|thumb|200px|Paul VI's body in the Vatican, after his death.]]
On 16 March 1978, his friend from FUCI student days, former [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian prime minister]] [[Aldo Moro]], a Christian Democratic politician, was kidnapped by the [[Red Brigades]], which kept the world and the pope in suspense for 55 days.&lt;ref&gt;Hebblethwaite 699&lt;/ref&gt;  On 20 April, Moro directly appealed to the pope to intervene as [[Pope Pius XII]] had intervened in the case of Professor [[Giuliano Vassalli]] in the same situation.&lt;ref name="Hebblethwaite 700-701"&gt;Hebblethwaite 700–701&lt;/ref&gt; The eighty-year-old Paul VI wrote a letter to the [[Red Brigades]]:

{{quote|I have no mandate to speak to you, and I am not bound by any private interests in his regard. But I love him as a member of the great human family as a friend of student days and by a very special title as a brother in faith and as a son of the Church of Christ. I make an appeal that you will certainly not ignore. On my knees I beg you, free Aldo Moro, simply without conditions, not so much because of my humble and well-meaning intercession, but because he shares with you the common dignity of a brother in humanity. Men of the Red Brigades, leave me, the interpreter of the voices of so many of our fellow citizens, the hope that in your heart feelings of humanity will triumph. In prayer and always loving you I await proof of that."&lt;ref name="Hebblethwaite 700-701"/&gt;}}

Some in the Italian government accused the pope of treating the Red Brigades too kindly. However, he continued looking for ways to pay ransom for Moro  – but to no avail. On 9 May, the bullet-riddled body of Aldo Moro was found in a car in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Hebblethwaite 706&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Paul VI later celebrated his State Funeral Mass.

===Final days===
[[File:Pope Paul VI Tiara 2.jpg|170px|thumb|left|The [[Tiara of Pope Paul VI|Papal Tiara of Paul VI]], now in the Crypt of the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]]]]Pope Paul VI left the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]] to go to the papal summer residence, Castel Gandolfo, on 14 July 1978, visiting on the way the tomb of Cardinal [[Giuseppe Pizzardo]],&lt;ref name="Hebblethwaite 707"&gt;Hebblethwaite 707&lt;/ref&gt; who had introduced him to the Vatican half a century earlier. Although he was sick, he agreed to see the new Italian President [[Sandro Pertini]] for over two hours. In the evening he watched a [[Western (genre)|Western]] on TV, happy only when he saw "horses, the most beautiful animals that God had created."&lt;ref name="Hebblethwaite 707" /&gt; He had breathing problems and needed oxygen. On Sunday, at the Feast of the Transfiguration, he was tired, but wanted to say the [[Angelus]]. He was neither able nor permitted to do so and instead stayed in bed, his temperature rising.

[[File:SanctusPaulusVI.jpg|thumb|left|185px|Tomb of Paul VI following his canonisation in October 2018.]]

===Death===
From his bed he participated in Sunday Mass at 18:00. After communion, the pope suffered a massive heart attack, after which he continued to live for three hours. On 6 August 1978 at 21:41 Paul VI died in Castel Gandolfo.&lt;ref name="Hebblethwaite 707" /&gt; According to the terms of his [[Testament of Pope Paul VI|will]], he was buried in the "true earth" and therefore, he does not have an ornate [[sarcophagus]] but in practice beneath the floor of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]], though in an area of the baslica's crypt near the tombs of other popes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pope Paul VI Is Dead of a Heart Attack at 80; Guided the Church Through Era of Change|url= https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0926.html|author=Kenneth A.

Am I Hamlet? Or [[Don Quixote]]? On the left? On the right? I do not think I have been properly understood. I am filled with 'great joy (Superabundo gaudio)' With all our affliction, I am overjoyed (2 Cor 2:4).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Cathal B|last=Daly|title=Steps on my Pilgrim Journey|publisher=Veritas |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His confessor, the [[Jesuit]] [[Paolo Dezza]], said that "this pope is a man of great joy" {{Sfn| Hebblethwaite|1993|p=339}} and &lt;blockquote&gt;If Paul VI was not a saint, when he was elected Pope, he became one during his pontificate.  I was able to witness not only with what energy and dedication he toiled for Christ and the Church but also and above all, how much he suffered for Christ and the Church. I always admired not only his deep inner resignation but also his constant abandonment to divine providence."{{Sfn|Hebblethwaite|1993|p=600}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Canonization==
[[File:Beatification of Paul VI.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Tapestry of Paul VI on the occasion of his beatification on 19 October 2014.]]
[[File:Ceremonia de Canonización de Monseñor Romero. (44398703435).jpg|thumb|right|225px|Canonization Mass held on 14 October 2018.]]
{{Main|Beatification of Pope Paul VI}}
The diocesan process for beatification for Paul VI - titled then as a [[Servant of God]] - opened in Rome on 11 May 1993 under [[Pope John Paul II]] after the "[[nihil obstat]]" ("nothing against") was declared the previous 18 March. Cardinal [[Camillo Ruini]] opened the diocesan process in Rome. The title of Servant of God is the first of four steps toward possible [[canonisation]]. The diocesan process concluded its business on 18 March 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.microsofttranslator.com/bv.aspx?from=&amp;to=en&amp;a=http%3A%2F%2Fpress.catholica.va%2Fnews_services%2Fbulletin%2Fnews%2F30226.php%3Findex%3D30226%26lang%3Den|title = Catholic Press|publisher = [[Microsoft]]|type = [[Bing Translator|translator]]|accessdate = 23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 December 2012, [[Pope Benedict XVI]], in an audience with the Cardinal Prefect of the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] [[Angelo Amato]], declared that the late pontiff had lived a life of [[heroic virtue]], which means that he could be called "[[Venerable]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.microsofttranslator.com/bv.aspx?from=&amp;to=en&amp;a=http%3A%2F%2Fpress.catholica.va%2Fnews_services%2Fbulletin%2Fnews%2F30226.php%3Findex%3D30226%26lang%3Den|title = translator|publisher = Microsoft|accessdate = 23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 December 2013, Vatican officials comprising a medical panel approved a supposed miracle that was attributed to the intercession of the late pontiff, which was the curing of an unborn child in [[California]], U.S.A in the 1990s. This miracle was investigated in California from 7 July 2003 until 12 July 2004. It was expected that [[Pope Francis]] would approve the miracle in the near future, thus, warranting the beatification of the late pontiff.&lt;ref name="uscatholic"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.uscatholic.org/news/201312/alleged-miracle-puts-pope-paul-vi-one-step-closer-sainthood-28254|work=US Catholic|title=Alleged miracle puts Pope Paul VI one step closer to sainthood|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, it was reported that the consulting Vatican theologians to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints recognised the miracle attributed to the late pontiff on 18 February.&lt;ref name="catholicnewsagency"&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope_benedict_forgoes_waiting_period_begins_john_paul_ii_beatification_process/ "Pope Benedict Forgoes Waiting Period, begins John Paul II Beatification Process"] Catholic News Agency 13 May 2005 Retrieved 1 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 April 2014, it was reported in the Italian magazine ''Credere'' that the late pope could possibly be beatified on 19 October 2014. This report from the magazine further stated that several cardinals and bishops would meet on 5 May to confirm the miracle that had previously been approved, and then present it to Pope Francis who may sign the decree for beatification shortly after that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzettadelsud.it/news/english/89311/Pope-Paul-VI--to-be-beatified-this-year-.html|title=Pope Paul VI 'to be beatified this year'|date=24 April 2014|accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Congregation for the Causes of Saints' cardinal and bishop members held that meeting and positively concluded that the healing was indeed a miracle that could be attributed to the late pope. The matter would then be presented by the Cardinal Prefect to the pope for approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansa.it/english/news/vatican/2014/05/06/paul-vi-set-for-beatification_3a5e964a-f37c-4b28-bf2d-c74498d981ab.html|title=Paul VI set for beatification|publisher=ANSA|date=6 May 2014|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The second miracle required for his canonisation was reported to have occurred in 2014 not long after his beatification occurred. The vice-postulator Antonio Lanzoni suggested that the canonisation could have been approved in the near future which would allow for the canonisation sometime in spring 2016; this did not materialise because the investigations were still ongoing at that stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.italiaoggi.it/giornali/preview_giornali.asp%3Fid%3D1953197%26codiciTestate%3D1&amp;prev=search|title=Paul VI made a miracle|publisher=Italia Oggi|date=14 January 2015|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.rmfonline.it/%3Fp%3D22227&amp;prev=search|title=Saint Paul VI soon|publisher=RMF Online|date=16 January 2015|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com.au/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bresciaoggi.it%2Fstories%2FHome%2F1267970_violista_guarito_da_paolo_vi_la_chiesa_ascolta_e_valuta%2F&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url|title=Violist healed by Paul VI?

His liturgical feast day is celebrated on the date of his birth, 26 September, rather than the day of his death as is usual since the latter falls on the Feast of the Transfiguration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/libretti/2014/20141019-libretto-beatificazione-paolo-vi.pdf |title=Booklet of the Beatification of Paul VI |publisher=Holy See |date=18 October 2014 |accessdate=18 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022045507/http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/libretti/2014/20141019-libretto-beatificazione-paolo-vi.pdf |archivedate=22 October 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final miracle needed for the late pope's canonisation was investigated in [[Verona]] and was closed on 11 March 2017. The miracle in question involves the healing of an unborn girl, Amanda Maria Paola (born 25 December 2014), after her parents (Vanna and Alberto) went to the [[Santa Maria delle Grazie, Brescia|Santuario delle Grazie]] in [[Brescia]] to pray for the late pope's intercession the previous 29 October, just ten days after Paul VI was beatified.&lt;ref name=VPP&gt;{{citeweb|publisher=La Voce del Popolo|date=22 December 2017|title=Paolo VI Santo: una bella notizia|accessdate=27 December 2017|url=http://www.lavocedelpopolo.it/diocesi/paolo-vi-santo-una-bella-notizia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The miracle regarding Amanda was the fact that she had survived for months despite the fact that the [[placenta]] was broken. On 23 September, a month before the beatification, Amanda's mother Vanna Pironato (aged 35) was hospitalised due to the premature rupture of the placenta, with doctors declaring her pregnancy to be at great risk.&lt;ref name=VPP/&gt; The documents regarding the alleged miracle are now in Rome awaiting approval; he shall be canonised should this healing be approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|publisher=Diocesi di Verona|date=March 2017|accessdate=19 July 2017|title=Alcuni incontri del Vescovo|url=http://www.diocesidiverona.it/pls/s2ewdiocesiverona/V3_S2E2_CONSULTAZIONE.mostra_pagina?id_pagina=2527&amp;rifi=guest&amp;rifp=guest}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theologians advising the Congregation for the Causes of Saints voiced their approval to this miracle on 13 December 2017 (following the confirmation of doctors on 26 October) and have this direction on to the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. who must vote on the cause also before taking it to Pope Francis for his approval.

==Legacy and controversies==
{{Social teachings of the popes}}
The pontificate of Paul VI continued the opening and internationalisation of the Church started under [[Pius XII]]. He implemented the reforms of [[John XXIII]] and [[Vatican II]]. Yet, unlike these popes, Paul VI faced criticism throughout his papacy from both traditionalists and liberals for steering a middle course during Vatican II and during the implementation of its reforms thereafter.{{Sfn|Graham|1983|p=75}} He expressed a desire for peace during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shc.edu/theolibrary/resources/handbook_warpeace.htm |title=Pope Paul VI, Address to the United Nations General Assembly |year=1965 |publisher=SHC |website=Handbook of Catholic Social Teaching: War and Peace |accessdate=13 July 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6I5oAEwca?url=http://www.shc.edu/theolibrary/resources/handbook_warpeace.htm |archivedate=13 July 2013 |quote=No more war, war never again! Peace, it is peace which must guide the destinies of people and of all mankind. |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On basic Church teachings, the pope was unwavering. On the tenth anniversary of ''[[Humanae vitae]]'', he reconfirmed this teaching.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;{{Sfn|Graham|1983|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his style and methodology, he was a disciple of Pius XII, whom he deeply revered.&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt; He suffered for the attacks on Pius XII for his alleged silences during the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt; Pope Paul VI was said to have been less intellectually gifted than his predecessors: he was not credited with an encyclopaedic memory, nor a gift for languages, nor the brilliant writing style of Pius XII,{{Sfn|Pallenberg|1960|p=107}} nor did he have the charisma and outpouring love, sense of humor and human warmth of John XXIII. He took on himself the unfinished reform work of these two popes, bringing them diligently with great humility and common sense and without much fanfare to conclusion.{{Sfn|Graham|1983|p=76}} In doing so, Paul VI saw himself following in the footsteps of the Apostle Paul, torn to several directions as Saint Paul, who said,  "I am attracted to two sides at once, because the Cross always divides."{{Sfn|Guitton|1967|p=159}}
[[File:Paul6statue.jpg|thumb|left|160px|A statue of Paul VI in Milan, Italy]]
[[File:GER Bundesverdienstkreuz 7 Grosskreuz.svg|thumb|left|160px|Paul VI received the Grand Cross First Class of the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]].]]

Unlike his predecessors and successors, Paul VI refused to excommunicate opponents. He admonished but did not punish those with other views. The new theological freedoms which he fostered&amp;nbsp;resulted in a pluralism of opinions and uncertainties among the faithful.{{Sfn|Franzen|1991|p=389}}  New demands were voiced, which were taboo at the Council, the reintegration of divorced Catholics, the sacramental character of the confession, and the role of women in the Church and its ministries. Conservatives complained, that "women wanted to be priests, priests wanted to get married, bishops became regional popes and theologians claimed absolute teaching authority. Protestants claimed equality, homosexuals and divorce called for full acceptance."{{Sfn|Martin| 1981|p=277}} Changes such as the [[Mass of Paul VI#Liturgical orientation|reorientation of the liturgy]], [[Mass of Paul VI#Changes in the Order of Mass|alterations to the ordinary of the Mass]], alterations to the [[Calendar of saints|liturgical calendar]] in the motu proprio ''[[Mysterii Paschalis]]'', and the [[Mass of Paul VI#Repositioning of the tabernacle|relocation of the tabernacle]] were controversial among some Catholics.

While the total number of Catholics increased during the pontificate of Paul VI the number of priests did not keep up. In the United States at beginning of Paul's reign there were almost 1,600 priestly ordinations a year while that was nearly 900 a year at his death. The number of seminarians at the same time dropped by three quarters. More pronounced declines were evident in religious life where the number of sisters and brothers declined sharply. Infant baptisms began to decline almost at once after Paul's election and did not begin to recover until 1980. In the same period adult conversions to the Church declined by a third. While marriages increased [[Declaration of nullity|annulments]] also increased but at a much greater rate. There was a 1322% increase in declarations of nullity between 1968 and 1970 alone. While 65% of US catholics went to Sunday Mass in 1965 that had slipped to 40% by the time of Paul's death. Similar collapses occurred in other developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Kenneth C. |title=Index of Leading catholic Indicators |date=2003 |publisher=Oriens Publishing Company |location=St Louis, MO |isbn=0972868801 |pages=13-83 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul VI did renounce many traditional symbols of the papacy and the Catholic Church; some of his changes to the papal dress were reversed by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in the early 21st century. Refusing a Vatican army of colourful military uniforms from centuries, he got rid of them. He became the first pope to visit five continents.&lt;ref name="Josef Schmitz van Vorst, 68"&gt;Josef Schmitz van Vorst, 68&lt;/ref&gt; Paul VI systematically continued and completed the efforts of his predecessors, to turn the Euro-centric Church into a Church of the world, by integrating the bishops from all continents in its government and in the Synods which he convened. His 6 August 1967 [[motu proprio]] ''Pro Comperto Sane'' opened the [[Roman Curia]] to the bishops of the world. Until then, only Cardinals could be leading members of the Curia.&lt;ref name="Josef Schmitz van Vorst, 68" /&gt;

Some critiqued Paul VI's decision; the newly created Synod of Bishops had an advisory role only and could not make decisions on their own, although the Council decided exactly that. During the pontificate of Paul VI, five such synods took place, and he is on record of implementing all their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Simmel, 80&lt;/ref&gt; Related questions were raised about the new National Bishop Conferences, which became mandatory after Vatican II. Others questioned his Ostpolitik and contacts with Communism and the deals he engaged in for the faithful.&lt;ref&gt;Simmel, 82&lt;/ref&gt;

The pope clearly suffered from the responses within the Church to ''Humanae vitae''. While most regions and bishops supported the pontiff, a small but important part of them especially in the Netherlands, Canada, and Germany openly disagreed with the pope, which deeply wounded him for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Simmel, 81&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Patrick O'Boyle]], the Cardinal Archbishop of Washington, DC, disciplined several priests for publicly dissenting from this teaching, the pope encouraged him.

The '''red panda''' (''Ailurus fulgens'') is a [[mammal]] native to the eastern [[Himalayas]] and [[southwestern China]]. It is listed as [[endangered species|Endangered]] on the [[IUCN Red List]], because the wild population is estimated at fewer than 10,000 mature individuals and continues to decline due to [[habitat loss]] and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]], [[poaching]], and [[inbreeding depression]].&lt;ref name="iucn"&gt;{{cite iucn |author=Glatston, A. |author2=Wei, F. |author3=Than Zaw |author4=Sherpa, A. |last-author-amp=yes |title=''Ailurus fulgens'' |journal=[[The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] |publisher=[[IUCN]] |volume=2015 |page=e.T714A110023718 |date=2015 |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/714/110023718 |doi=10.2305/IUCN.UK.2015-4.RLTS.T714A45195924.en |access-date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The red panda has reddish-brown fur, a long, shaggy tail, and a waddling [[gait]] due to its shorter front legs; it is roughly the size of a [[Cat|domestic cat]], though with a longer body and somewhat heavier. It is [[arboreal]], feeds mainly on [[Bamboo shoot|bamboo]], but also eats eggs, [[bird]]s, and [[insect]]s. It is a [[solitary animal]], mainly [[Nocturnality|active from dusk to dawn]], and is largely [[Sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]] during the day. It is also called the '''lesser panda''', the '''red bear-cat''', and the '''red cat-bear'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Glatston, A. R. |title=Red Panda: Biology and Conservation of the First Panda |year=2010 |publisher=William Andrew |isbn=978-1-4377-7813-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The red panda is the only living species of the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''Ailurus'' and the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Ailuridae]]. It has been previously placed in the [[Procyonidae|raccoon]] and [[Ursidae|bear]] families, but the results of [[phylogenetic]] analysis provide strong support for its [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] classification in its own family, Ailuridae, which is part of the superfamily [[Musteloidea]], along with the [[Mustelidae|weasel]], [[Procyonidae|raccoon]] and [[skunk]] families.&lt;ref name="Flynn_2000" /&gt; Two [[subspecies]] are recognized.&lt;ref name=msw3 /&gt; It is not closely related to the [[giant panda]], which is a [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] [[Bear|ursid]].

The head and body length of a red panda measures {{convert|50|to|64|cm|abbr=on}}, and its tail is {{convert|28|to|59|cm|abbr=on}}. Males weigh {{convert|3.7|to|6.2|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and females {{convert|3|to|6.0|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="roberts+gittleman"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Roberts, M. S. |author2=Gittleman, J.

DK Adult (2005), {{ISBN|0-7894-7764-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have long, soft, reddish-brown fur on the upper parts, blackish fur on the lower parts, and a light face with tear markings and [[Robustness (morphology)|robust]] [[cranium|cranio]]-[[teeth|dental]] features. The light face has white [[Territory (animal)#Visual|badges]] similar to those of a raccoon, but each individual can have distinctive markings. Their roundish heads have medium-sized upright ears, black noses, and blackish eyes. Their long, bushy tails with six alternating transverse [[ochre]] rings provide balance and excellent [[camouflage]] against their habitat of [[moss]]- and [[lichen]]-covered trees. The legs are black and short with thick fur on the soles of the paws. This fur serves as thermal insulation on snow-covered or icy surfaces and conceals scent glands, which are also present on the anus.&lt;ref name="pocock41"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pocock, R.I. |year=1941 |title=Fauna of British India, including Ceylon and Burma.

The red panda is [[Specialization (biology)|specialized]] as a bamboo feeder with strong, curved and sharp semi-retractile claws&lt;ref name="roberts+gittleman" /&gt; standing inward for grasping narrow tree branches, leaves, and fruit. Like the giant panda, it has a "false thumb", which is an extension of the [[wrist bone]]. When descending a tree head-first, the red panda rotates its ankle to control its descent, one of the few climbing species to do so.&lt;ref name="Wiley"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fisher, R.

[[File:Tiergarten Schoenbrunn Kleiner Panda 2.jpg|thumb|A red panda sleeping on a tree.|alt=A red panda lies sleeping on a high branch of a tree, with tail stretched out behind and legs dangling on each side of the branch]]
The red panda is [[endemic]] to the [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|temperate forests]] of the [[Himalaya]]s, and ranges from the foothills of western [[Nepal]] to [[China]] in the east.&lt;ref name="glatston_1994_20" /&gt; Its easternmost limit is the [[Qinling Mountains]] of the [[Shaanxi Province]] in China. Its range includes southern [[Tibet]], [[Sikkim]] and [[Assam]] in [[India]], [[Bhutan]], the northern mountains of [[Burma]], and in south-western China, in the [[Hengduan Mountains]] of [[Sichuan]] and the Gongshan Mountains in [[Yunnan]]. It may also live in south-west Tibet and northern [[Arunachal Pradesh]], but this has not been documented. Locations with the highest density of red pandas include an area in the Himalayas that has been proposed as having been a refuge for a variety of endemic species in the [[Pleistocene]]. The distribution range of the red panda should be considered disjunct, rather than continuous.&lt;ref name="roberts+gittleman" /&gt; A disjunct population inhabits the [[Meghalaya subtropical forests|Meghalaya]] Plateau of north-eastern India.&lt;ref name="Choudhury" /&gt;

During a survey in the 1970s, signs of red pandas were found in Nepal's [[Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;Wegge, P. (1976) ''Himalayan shikar reserves: surveys and management proposals.'' Field Document No. 5. FAO/NEP/72/002 Project, Kathmandu.&lt;/ref&gt; Their presence was confirmed in spring 2007 when four red pandas were sighted at elevations ranging from {{convert|3220|to|3610|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sharma, H.P., Belant, J.L.|year=2009|title=Distribution and observations of Red Pandas ''Ailurus fulgens fulgens'' in Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, Nepal|url=http://www.smallcarnivoreconservation.org/sccwiki/images/b/bf/SCC40_Sharma_and_Belant.pdf|journal=Small Carnivore Conservation|volume=40|date=April 2009|pages=33–35|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728031545/http://www.smallcarnivoreconservation.org/sccwiki/images/b/bf/SCC40_Sharma_and_Belant.pdf|archivedate=28 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species' westernmost limit is in [[Rara National Park]] located farther west of the Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve.&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, M. (1976) ''Lake Rara National Park management plan.'' Working Document No. 3. FAO/UNDP National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Project, Nepal&lt;/ref&gt; Their presence was confirmed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, H. P. (2008) ''Distribution and conservation status of Red Panda (''Ailurus fulgens'') in Rara National Park, Nepal''. Final Report to People’s Trust for Endangered Species, London, UK&lt;/ref&gt;

The red panda lives between {{convert|2200|and|4800|m|ft|abbr=on}} altitude, inhabiting areas of moderate temperature between {{convert|10|and|25|C|F}} with little annual change. It prefers mountainous mixed [[deciduous]] and [[conifer]] forests, especially with old trees and dense understories of [[bamboo]].&lt;ref name="roberts+gittleman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="glatston_1994_20" /&gt;

The red panda population in [[Sichuan|Sichuan Province]] is larger and more stable than the Yunnan population, suggesting a southward expansion from Sichuan into Yunnan in the [[Holocene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bing Su |author2=Yunxin Fu |author3=Wang, Y. |author4=Li Jin |author5=Chakraborty, R. |year=2001 |title=Genetic Diversity and Population History of the Red Panda (''Ailurus fulgens'') as Inferred from Mitochondrial DNA Sequence Variations |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=1070–1076 |pmid=11371595 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a003878 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The red panda has become [[Local extinction|extirpated]] from the Chinese provinces of [[Guizhou]], [[Gansu]], Shaanxi, and [[Qinghai]].&lt;ref name="Wei"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wei |first=F. |last2=Feng |first2=Z. |last3=Wang |first3=Z. |last4=Hu |first4=J. |title=Current distribution, status and conservation of wild red pandas ''Ailurus fulgens'' in China |journal=Biological Conservation |doi=10.1016/S0006-3207(98)00156-6 |issue=89 |pages=285–291 |year=1999 |volume=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distribution of subspecies ===
Distribution of the red panda is disjointed, with two [[extant taxon|extant]] subspecies:
* Western red panda ''A. f. fulgens'' ([[Frédéric Cuvier|Cuvier]], 1825) lives in the western part of its range, in [[Nepal]], [[Assam]], [[Sikkim]], and [[Bhutan]].
* Styan's red panda ''A. f. styani'' lives in the east-north-eastern part of its range, in southern China and northern Burma.&lt;ref name="glover1938" /&gt;
''A. f. styani'' has been described by [[Oldfield Thomas|Thomas]] in 1902 based on one skull from a specimen collected in Sichuan.&lt;ref name="thomas_1902"&gt;{{Cite news |author=Thomas, O. |year=1902 |title=On the Panda of Sze-chuen |periodical=Annals and Magazine of Natural History |publisher=Gunther, A.C.L.G., Carruthers, W., Francis, W. |location=London |series=Seventh Series |volume=X |pages=251–252 |url=https://archive.org/stream/s7annalsmagazine10londuoft#page/251/mode/1up |doi=10.1080/00222930208678667}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reginald Innes Pocock|Pocock]] distinguished ''A. f. styani'' from ''A. f. fulgens'' by its longer winter coat and greater blackness of the [[pelage]], bigger skull, more strongly curved forehead, and more robust teeth. His description is based on skulls and skins collected in Sichuan, [[Myitkyina District|Myitkyina]] close to the border of Yunnan, and Upper Burma.&lt;ref name="pocock41" /&gt;

Styan's red panda is supposedly larger and darker in color than the Western member of the species, but with considerable variation in both subspecies, and some individuals may be brown or yellowish brown rather than red.&lt;ref name="glatston_1994_20"&gt;[[#glatston1994|Glatston 1994:20]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brahmaputra]] River is often considered the natural division between the two subspecies, where it makes a curve around the eastern end of the Himalayas, although some authors suggest ''A. f. fulgens'' extends farther eastward, into China.

== Biology and behavior ==

=== Behavior ===
[[File:Red panda twittering.ogg|thumb|Sounds of red panda twittering.]]

The red panda is territorial; it is solitary except during [[mating season]]. The species is generally quiet except for some [[List of animal sounds|twittering]], tweeting, and whistling communication sounds. It has been reported to be both [[nocturnal]] and [[crepuscular]], sleeping on tree branches or in tree hollows during the day and increasing its activity in the late afternoon and early evening hours. It sleeps stretched out on a branch with legs dangling when it is hot, and curled up with its tail over the face when it is cold.&lt;ref name="roberts+gittleman" /&gt; This animal is very heat-sensitive, with an optimal "well-being" temperature between {{convert|17|and|25|C|F|abbr=on}}, and cannot tolerate temperatures over {{convert|25|°C|°F}}{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}.

[[File:Lesser panda standing.jpg|thumb|right|A red panda standing on a stone.]]

Shortly after waking, red pandas clean their fur somewhat like a cat would, licking their front paws and then rubbing their backs, torsos, and sides. They also rub their backs and bellies along the sides of trees or rocks. Then they patrol their territories, [[spraying (animal behavior)|marking with urine]] and a weak [[musk]]-smelling secretion from their [[anal glands]]. They search for food running along the ground or through the trees. Red pandas may use their forepaws alternately to bring food to their mouths or place food directly into their mouths.&lt;ref name="roberts+gittleman" /&gt;

Predators of the red panda include the [[snow leopard]], [[Mustelidae|mustelids]], and humans. If they feel threatened or sense danger, they may try to escape by climbing a rock column or tree. If they can no longer flee, they stand on their hind legs to make themselves appear larger and use the sharp claws on their front paws to defend themselves. A red panda, [[Futa (panda)|Futa]], became a visitor attraction in Japan for his ability to stand upright for ten seconds at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Lesser panda standing on two legs charms Japanese zoo|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-05/20/content_444327.htm|accessdate=2018-08-02|newspaper=[[China Daily]]|date=2005-05-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802115933/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-05/20/content_444327.htm|archivedate=2018-08-02|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also: [[facultative biped]])

=== Diet ===
[[File:Ailurus fulgens 01.ogv|thumb|A red panda gnawing.]]

Red pandas are excellent climbers, and forage largely in trees. They eat mostly [[bamboo]], and may eat small mammals, birds, eggs, flowers, and berries. In captivity, they were observed to eat birds, flowers, [[Acer (genus)|maple]] and [[Morus (plant)|mulberry]] leaves, and bark and fruits of maple, [[beech]], and mulberry.&lt;ref name="roberts+gittleman" /&gt;

Like the giant panda, they cannot digest [[cellulose]], so they must consume a large volume of bamboo to survive. Their diets consist of about two-thirds bamboo, but they also eat mushrooms, roots, acorns, lichens, and grasses. Occasionally, they supplement their diets with fish and insects. They do little more than eat and sleep due to their low-calorie diets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://people.rit.edu/~mpa6360/320/project2/diet.html|title=Red Panda – Diet|publisher=Rochester Institute of Technology|access-date=6 September 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628151749/http://people.rit.edu/~mpa6360/320/project2/diet.html|archivedate=28 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.birminghamzoo.com/animal/red-panda/|title=Red Panda|location=Birmingham Zoo|access-date=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Endangered Red Panda.jpg|thumb|The red panda's herbivore diet.]]

[[Bamboo shoot]]s are more easily digested than leaves, exhibiting the highest digestibility in summer and autumn, intermediate digestibility in the spring, and lowest digestibility in the winter. These variations correlate with the nutrient contents in the bamboo. Red pandas process bamboo poorly, especially the cellulose and [[cell wall]] components. This implies [[microbial digestion]] plays only a minor role in their digestive strategy. To survive on this poor-quality diet, they have to eat the high-quality sections of the bamboo plant, such as the tender leaves and shoots, in large quantities, over {{convert|1.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of fresh leaves and {{convert|4|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of fresh shoots daily. This food passes through the digestive tract fairly rapidly (about 2–4 hr) so as to maximize daily nutrient intake.&lt;ref name="wei_1999"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1999.tb01053.x |author=Wei, F |author2=Feng, Z. |author3=Wang, Z. |author4=Zhou, A. |author5=Hu, J. |year=1999 |title=Use of the nutrients in bamboo by the red panda ''Ailurus fulgens'' |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=248 |pages=535–541 |issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Red pandas can taste [[artificial sweetener]]s, such as [[aspartame]], and are the only non[[primate]]s known to be able to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8002978.stm |title=Pandas opt for low-cal sweeteners |date=16 April 2008 |accessdate=8 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproduction ===
[[File:Dortmund-Zoo-Kleiner Panda151930.jpg|thumb|A red panda tending its cub.]]

Red pandas are able to reproduce at around 18 months of age, and are fully mature at two to three years. Adults rarely interact in the wild except to mate. Both sexes may mate with more than one partner during the mating season from mid-January to early March.&lt;ref name="Nowak"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nowak |first=R. M. |title=Walker’s Mammals of the World |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=1999 |edition=sixth |volume=2 |pages=695–696 |isbn=0-8018-5789-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days before birth, females begin to collect material, such as brushwood, grass, and leaves, to build a nest, which is normally located in a hollow tree or a rock crevice. After a gestation period of 112 to 158 days, the female gives birth in mid-June to late July to one to four (usually 1–2) blind and deaf cubs weighing {{convert|110|to|130|g|oz|abbr=on}} each.&lt;ref name="roberts+gittleman" /&gt;

After birth, the mother cleans the cubs, and can then recognize each by its smell. At first, she spends 60% to 90% of her time with the cubs. After the first week, the mother starts spending more time outside the nest, returning every few hours to nurse and groom the cubs. She moves the young frequently among several nests, all of which she keeps clean. The cubs start to open their eyes at about 18 days of age. By about 90 days, they achieve full adult fur and coloring, and begin to venture out of the nest. They also start eating solid foods at this point, weaning at around six to eight months of age. The cubs stay with their mother until the next litter is born in the following summer. Males rarely help raise the young, and only if they live in pairs or in small groups.&lt;ref name="roberts+gittleman" /&gt;

A red panda's [[average lifespan]] is between eight and 10 years, but individuals have been known to reach 15 years{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}.

== Threats ==
The primary threats to red pandas are direct harvest from the wild, live or dead, competition with domestic livestock resulting in habitat degradation, and [[deforestation]] resulting in habitat loss or fragmentation. The relative importance of these factors is different in each region, and is not well understood.&lt;ref name="glatston_1994_20" /&gt; For instance, in India, the biggest threat seems to be habitat loss followed by [[poaching]], while in China, the biggest threat seems to be hunting and poaching.&lt;ref name="iucn" /&gt; A 40% decrease in red panda populations has been reported in China over the last 50 years, and populations in western Himalayan areas are considered to be lower.&lt;ref name="Wei" /&gt;

Deforestation can inhibit the spread of red pandas and exacerbate the natural population subdivision by [[topography]] and [[ecology]], leading to severe fragmentation of the remaining wild population. Fewer than 40 animals in four separate groups share resources with humans in Nepal's [[Langtang National Park]], where only 6% of {{Convert|1710|km2|abbr=on}} is preferred red panda habitat. Although direct competition for food with domestic livestock is not significant, [[livestock]] can depress bamboo growth by trampling.&lt;ref name="Yonzon"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yonzon, P. B. |author2=Hunter Jr., M. L. |title=Conservation of the red panda ''Ailurus fulgens'' |journal=Biological Conservation |issue=57 |year=1991 |doi=10.1016/0006-3207(91)90046-C |volume=58 |pages=85 |last3=Shobrak |last4=Habibi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small groups of animals with little opportunity for exchange between them face the risk of inbreeding, decreased genetic diversity, and even extinction. In addition, [[clearcutting]] for firewood or agriculture, including hillside terracing, removes old trees that provide maternal dens and decreases the ability of some species of bamboo to regenerate.&lt;ref name="glatston_1994_20" /&gt;

In south-west China, red pandas are hunted for their fur, especially for the highly valued bushy tails, from which hats are produced. In these areas, the fur is often used for local cultural ceremonies. In weddings, the bridegroom traditionally carries the hide. The "good-luck charm" red panda-tail hats are also used by local newly-weds.&lt;ref name="Wei" /&gt; This practice may be quite old, as the red panda seems to be depicted in a 13th-century Chinese pen-and-ink scroll showing a hunting scene. Little or no mention of the red panda is made in the culture and folklore of Nepal.&lt;ref name="glatston_1994_8" /&gt;

In the past, red pandas were captured and sold to [[zoo]]s. In an article appearing in the ''International Zoo News'' in 1969, one reported he personally had handled 350 red pandas in 17 years.&lt;ref name="glatston_1994_11"&gt;[[#glatston1994|Glatston 1994:11]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to [[CITES]], this zoo harvest has decreased substantially in recent years, but poaching continues, and red pandas are often sold to private collectors at exorbitant prices. In some parts of Nepal and India, red pandas are kept as pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=World Wildlife Fund |url=http://www.wwfindia.org/red_panda.cfm |title=I'm a good luck charm. That's my bad luck. |accessdate=26 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217093400/http://www.wwfindia.org/red_panda.cfm |archivedate=17 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The red panda has a naturally low [[birth rate]] (usually one single or twin birth per year), and a high death rate in the wild{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}.

== Conservation ==
[[File:Red Panda (25193861686).jpg|thumb|Closeup look of a red panda.]]
[[File:Ailurus fulgens - 01.jpg|thumb|A red panda resting on a tree.]]

The red panda is listed in [[CITES Appendix I]].&lt;ref name="cites_appendix" /&gt; The species has been classified as [[Endangered species|endangered]] in the [[IUCN Red List]] since 2008 because the global population is estimated at about 10,000 individuals, with a decreasing population trend; only about half of the total area of potential habitat of {{convert|142000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} is actually being used by the species. Due to their shy and secretive nature, and their largely nocturnal habits, observation of red pandas is difficult. Therefore, population figures in the wild are determined by [[population density]] estimates and not direct counts.&lt;ref name="iucn" /&gt;

Worldwide population estimates range from fewer than 2,500&lt;ref name="Nowak" /&gt; to between 16,000 and 20,000 individuals.&lt;ref name="Choudhury"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Choudhury, A. |year=2001 |title=An overview of the status and conservation of the red panda ''Ailurus fulgens'' in India, with reference to its global status |journal=Oryx |publisher=Flora &amp; Fauna International |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=250–259 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-3008.2001.00181.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the total population in China was estimated at between 3,000 and 7,000 individuals.&lt;ref name="Wei" /&gt; In 2001, the wild population in India was estimated at between 5,000 and 6,000 individuals.&lt;ref name="Choudhury" /&gt; Estimates for Nepal indicate only a few hundred individuals.&lt;ref name="Massicot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animalinfo.org/species/carnivor/ailufulg.htm |title=Animal Info: Red Panda |author=Massicot, P. |year=2006 |accessdate=2 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; No records from Bhutan or Burma exist.

Reliable population numbers are hard to find, partly because other animals have been mistaken for the red panda. For instance, one report from [[Burma]] stated that red pandas were still fairly common in some areas; however, the accompanying photographic proof of the "red panda" is in fact a species of [[civet]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#glatston1994|Glatston 1994:viii]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The red panda is protected in all range countries, and hunting is illegal.&lt;ref name="iucn" /&gt; Beyond this, conservation efforts are highly variable between countries:
* China has 35 [[protected areas in China|protected areas]], covering about 42.4% of red panda habitat.&lt;ref name="iucn" /&gt;
* India has 20 protected areas with known or possible red panda populations in [[Sikkim]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], and [[West Bengal]] such as [[Khangchendzonga National Park|Khangchendzonga]], [[Namdapha National Park|Namdapha]] and [[Singalila National Park]]s, and a coordinated conservation policy for the red panda.&lt;ref name="iucn" /&gt;
* In Nepal, known populations occur in [[Langtang National Park|Langtang]], [[Sagarmatha National Park|Sagarmatha]], [[Makalu Barun National Park|Makalu Barun]] and [[Rara National Park]]s, [[Annapurna Conservation Area]], [[Kanchenjunga Conservation Area]], and [[Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;Bhuju, U.R., Shakya, P.R., Basnet, T.B., Shrestha, S.

=== ''In situ'' initiatives ===
A community-managed forest in [[Ilam District]] of eastern Nepal is home to 15 red pandas which generate household income through tourism activities, including [[homestay]]s. Villagers in the high-altitude areas of Arunachal Pradesh have formed the Pangchen Red Panda Conservation Alliance comprising five villages with a community-conserved forest area of {{convert|200|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} at an altitude of {{convert|2500|m|ft|abbr=on}} to over {{convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Ghimire, N.|editor2=Bhatta, S.

=== In captivity ===
[[File:Spinus-red-panda-2014-10-n017050-w.jpg|thumb|left|Red panda at [[Prospect Park Zoo]], New York]]
The red panda is quite adaptable to living in captivity, and is common in zoos worldwide. By 1992, more than 300 [[captive breeding|births had occurred in captivity]], and more than 300 individuals lived in 85 institutions worldwide.&lt;ref name="roberts_1992" /&gt; By 2001, 182 individuals were in North American zoos alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arkive.org/species/GES/mammals/Ailurus_fulgens/more_info.html |title=Red Panda |last=ARKive |year=2008 |accessdate=2 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, the international studbook listed more than 800 individuals in zoos and parks around the world. Of these, 511 individuals of subspecies ''A. f. fulgens'' were kept in 173 institutions&lt;ref name="studbook/fulgens"/&gt; and 306 individuals of subspecies ''A. f. styani'' were kept in 81 institutions.&lt;ref name="studbook/styani"/&gt;

The international [[studbook]] is currently managed at the [[Rotterdam Zoo]] in the [[Netherlands]]. In cooperation with the International Red Panda Management Group, they coordinate the [[Species Survival Plan]] in North America, the [[European Endangered Species Programme]] in Europe, and other [[captive-breeding]] programs in [[Australia]], India, [[Japan]], and China.&lt;ref name="studbook/styani" /&gt;&lt;ref name="india/studbook"&gt;{{cite report|author1=Srivastav, A.|author2=Nigam.

== As pets ==
[[File:Red Panda in a Gingko tree.jpg|thumb|right|A red panda on a [[ginkgo]] tree.]]

The most often cited example of keeping red pandas as pets is the case of former Indian prime minister [[Indira Gandhi]]. Pandas were presented to her family as a gift, and they were then housed in "a special tree house".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Conservation and Society |url=http://www.conservationandsociety.org/text.asp?2009/7/4/299/65175 |title=Striving for a balance: Nature, power, science and India's Indira Gandhi, 1917–1984 |author=Mahesh Rangarajan |year=2009 |issue=4 |volume=7 |pages=299–312 |doi=10.4103/0972-4923.65175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phylogenetics ==
{{Main|Ailuridae}}
The [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] classification of the red panda has been controversial since it was discovered. French zoologist [[Frédéric Cuvier]] initially described the red panda in 1825, and classified it as a close relative of the raccoon ([[Procyonidae]]), though he gave it the genus name ''Ailurus'', (from [[Ancient Greek]] {{linktext|αἴλουρος|lang=grc}}, "cat"), based on superficial similarities with domestic cats. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] is the [[Latin]] adjective ''{{linktext|fulgens|lang=la}}'' ("shining").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Simpson DP |title=Cassell's Latin Dictionary |publisher=Cassell Ltd. |year=1979 |edition=5th |location=London |isbn=0-304-52257-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At various times, it has been placed in the Procyonidae, [[Ursidae]], with ''[[Ailuropoda]]'' (giant panda) in the [[Ailuropodinae]] (until this family was moved into the Ursidae), and into its own family, the [[Ailuridae]]. This uncertainty comes from difficulty in determining whether certain characteristics of ''Ailurus'' are phylogenetically conservative or are derived and convergent with species of similar ecological habits.&lt;ref name="roberts+gittleman" /&gt;

[[File:Red panda gnawing.jpg|thumb|left|Red panda gnawing on an [[exfoliation (botany)|exfoliated]] bamboo bush.]]
Evidence based on the [[fossil record]], [[serology]], [[karyology]], [[behavior]], [[anatomy]], and [[reproduction]] reflect closer affinities with Procyonidae than Ursidae. However, ecological and [[foraging]] specializations and distinct geographical distribution in relation to modern [[procyonids]] support classification in the separate family Ailuridae.&lt;ref name=msw3 /&gt;&lt;ref name="roberts+gittleman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Flynn_2005"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Molecular phylogeny of the carnivora (mammalia): assessing the impact of increased sampling on resolving enigmatic relationships |journal=Systematic Biology |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=317–337 |year=2005 |pmid=16012099 |doi=10.1080/10635150590923326 |author1=Flynn |first1=J.

=== Evolutionary history ===

The red panda is considered a [[living fossil]] and only distantly related to the [[giant panda]] (''Ailuropoda melanoleuca''), as it is naturally more closely related to the other members of the superfamily [[Musteloidea]] to which it belongs. The [[common ancestor]] of both pandas (which also was an ancestor for all living bears; [[pinnipeds]] like seals and walruses; and members of the family [[Musteloidea]] like weasels and otters) can be traced back to the [[Paleogene]] [[Geological period|period]] tens of millions of years ago, with a wide distribution across [[Eurasia]].

[[Fossil]]s of the extinct red panda ''[[Parailurus anglicus]]'' have been unearthed from China in the east to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in the west.&lt;ref name="bristoli"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2008/04/05/red-panda-empire/|title=The once mighty red panda empire|last=Naish|first=Darrin|date=2008-04-05|publisher=Tetrapod Zoology|accessdate=2018-08-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805105943/http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2008/04/05/red-panda-empire/|archivedate=2018-08-05|df=ymd-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, a single tooth of ''[[Parailurus]]'' was discovered in the [[Pliocene]] Ringold Formation of [[Washington (state)|Washington]].

The discovery in Spain of the postcranial remains of ''[[Simocyon batalleri]]'', a [[Miocene]] relative to the red panda, supports a sister-group relationship between red pandas and bears. The discovery suggests the red panda's "false thumb" was an adaptation to arboreal locomotion&amp;nbsp;— independent of the giant panda's adaptation to manipulate bamboo&amp;nbsp;— one of the most dramatic cases of [[convergent evolution]] among vertebrates.&lt;ref name="PNAS-Salesa-2006"&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |last1=Salesa |first1=Manuel J. |last2=Mauricio |first2=Antón |last3=Peigné |first3=Stéphane |last4=Morales |first4=Jorge |title=Evidence of a false thumb in a fossil carnivore clarifies the evolution of pandas |journal=PNAS |year=2006 |volume=103 |pmid=16387860 |issue=2 |pmc=1326154 |pages=379–382 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0504899102 |bibcode=2006PNAS..103..379S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taxonomic history ===
[[File:Red Panda.JPG|thumb|Captive red panda]]
The first known written record of the red panda occurs in a 13th-century Chinese scroll depicting a hunting scene between hunters and the red panda.&lt;ref name="glatston_1994_8"&gt;[[#glatston1994|Glatston 1994]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roberts_1992"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/1992/2/redpandasfirecat.cfm |title=Red Panda: The Fire Cat |last=Roberts |first=M. |year=1992 |accessdate=26 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015182047/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/publications/zoogoer/1992/2/redpandasfirecat.cfm |archivedate=15 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major General [[Thomas Hardwicke]]’s 1821 presentation of an article titled "Description of a new Genus of the Class Mammalia, from the Himalaya Chain of Hills Between Nepaul and the Snowy Mountains" at the [[Linnean Society]] in London is usually regarded as the moment the red panda became a ''bona fide'' species in Western science. Hardwicke proposed the name "wha" and explained: "It is frequently discovered by its loud cry or call, resembling the word ‘Wha’, often repeating the same: hence is derived one of the local names by which it is known. It is also called ''Chitwa''." Hardwicke's paper was not published until 1827, by which time Frédéric Cuvier had published his description and a figure. Hardwicke's originally proposed taxonomic name was removed from the 1827 publication of his paper with his permission, and naming credit is now given to Cuvier.&lt;ref name="hardwicke_1827"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hardwicke, T. |title=Description of a new Genus of the Class Mammalia, from the Himalaya Chain of Hills between Nepaul and the Snowy Mountains |journal=The Transactions of the Linnean Society of London |volume=XV |pages=161–165 |publisher=Linnean Society of London |year=1827 |url=https://archive.org/stream/transactionsofli15182627linn#page/160/mode/2up |language=Latin, English |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.1826.tb00113.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frédéric Cuvier had received the specimen he described from his brother's stepson, [[Alfred Duvaucel]], who had sent it "from the mountains north of India".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cuvier, G. |year=1829 |title=Le règne animal distribué d'après son organisation |volume=Tome 1 |url=https://archive.org/stream/lergneanimaldi01regn#page/138/mode/2up/search/panda |pages=138: ''Le Panda éclatant'' |publisher=Chez Déterville, Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to use both the binomial name ''Ailurus fulgens'' and the vernacular name ''panda'' in his description of the species published in 1825 in ''Histoire naturelle des mammifères''.&lt;ref&gt;Cuvier, F.

Later publications claim the name was adopted from a [[Himalayan languages|Himalayan language]].

In 1847, [[Brian Houghton Hodgson|Hodgson]] described a red panda under the name ''Ailurus ochraceus'', of which Pocock concluded it represents the same [[Type species|type]] as ''Ailurus fulgens'', since the description of the two agree very closely. He subordinated both types to the Himalayan red panda subspecies ''Ailurus fulgens fulgens''.&lt;ref name="pocock41" /&gt;

=== Names in its native range ===

The red panda's local names differ from place to place. The [[Lepcha people|Lepcha]] call it ''sak nam''. In Nepal, it is called ''bhalu biralo'' (bear-cat) and ''habre''. The [[Bhotia language|Sherpa]] people of Nepal and Sikkim call it ''ye niglva ponva'' and ''wah donka''.&lt;ref&gt;Shrestha, T. K.

=== English names ===
In English, the red panda is also called "lesser panda" (since it is smaller than the [[giant panda]]),&lt;ref name=Raccoons/&gt; though "red panda" is more commonly used nowadays. As it was known in the West decades before the giant panda, initially it was the red panda that was simply called "panda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/441037/panda |title=Panda (mammal, ''Ailurus'' species)|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515120439/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/441037/panda |archive-date=2013-05-15 |accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illustrated London News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KKgcAQAAMAAJ|year=1958|publisher=Illustrated London News &amp; Sketch Limited|page=1004|quote= the wide popularity of the giant panda, the claims of the true panda, sometimes called the lesser panda, to distinguish it from its more glamorous rival, are apt to receive less attention than they deserve.

Other English names used in the past include ''fire fox'', ''fire cat'', ''red cat'', ''fox bear'', ''bright panda'', and ''Himalayan raccoon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sûrya India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QntDAAAAYAAJ|year=1985|publisher=A.

=== Names in other languages ===
Many other languages also use "red" or variations of "shining/gold" or "lesser/small" in their names for this species. For instance, {{lang|bg|червена панда}} in Bulgarian, {{lang|fr|panda roux}} in French, {{lang|es|panda rojo}} in Spanish, and {{lang|de|Roter Panda}} in German all mean "red panda". Since at least as far back as 1855, one of its French names has been {{lang|fr|panda éclatant}} (shining panda).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gervais |first=M. Paul |title=Histoire naturelle des mammifères avec l'indication de leurs moeurs et de leurs rapports avec les arts, le commerce et l'agriculture |year=1855 |volume=2 |page=23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RD8AAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |language=French |publisher=L. Curmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], it is called {{lang|fi|kultapanda}} (gold panda).

Variations of "lesser panda" occur in [[French language|French]] {{lang|fr|petit panda}} (small panda), [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|Kleiner Panda}} (small panda), [[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{lang|es|panda menor}} (lesser panda), [[Dutch language|Dutch]] {{lang|nl|kleine panda}} (small panda), [[Russian language|Russian]] {{lang|ru|малая панда}} ({{transl|ru|malaya panda}}, "small panda"), [[Korean language|Korean]] {{lang|ko-Hang|애기판다}} ({{transl|ko|aeki panda}}, "baby panda"), and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] {{lang|ja-Kana|レッサーパンダ}} ({{transl|ja|ressā panda}}, a transliteration of English "lesser panda"){{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}.

As part of the [[Apollo 12]] mission, the camera from the [[Surveyor 3]] probe was brought back from the [[Moon]] to Earth. On analyzing the camera it was found that the common bacterium ''[[Streptococcus mitis]]'' was alive on the camera. This was attributed by NASA to the camera not being sterilized on Earth prior to its launch two and a half years previously.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=June 2015}}. However later study showed that the scientists analysing the camera on return to Earth used procedures that were inadequate to prevent recontamination after return to Earth, for instance with their arms exposed, not covering their entire bodies as modern scientists would do. There may also have been possibilities for contamination during the return mission as the camera was returned in a porous bag rather than the airtight containers used for lunar sample return.&lt;ref name="David"/&gt; As a result the result remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surveyor 3 Streptococcus Mitis|url=https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/scripts/experiment/exper.aspx?exp_index=1651|website=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since the Apollo Program, there has been at least one independent investigation into the validity of the NASA claim.  [[Leonard D. Jaffe]], a [[Surveyor program]] scientist and custodian of the Surveyor 3 parts brought back from the Moon, stated in a letter to the [[Planetary Society]] that a member of his staff reported that a "breach of sterile procedure" took place at just the right time to produce a [[false positive]] result. One of the implements being used to scrape samples off the Surveyor parts was laid down on a non-sterile laboratory bench, and then was used to collect surface samples for culturing.  Jaffe wrote, "It is, therefore, quite possible that the microorganisms were transferred to the camera after its return to Earth, and that they had never been to the Moon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1311.html|title=Apollo 12 Remembered. Lunar Germ Colony or Lab Anomaly?|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831132850/http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1311.html|archivedate=2006-08-31|deadurl=yes|date=2004-11-21|work=Astrobiology Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, [[NASA]] funded an archival study that sought the film of the camera-body microbial sampling, to confirm the report of a breach in sterile technique.

The bacterial test is now non-repeatable because the parts were subsequently taken out of quarantine and fully re-exposed to terrestrial conditions (the Surveyor 3 camera is now on display in the [[Smithsonian Air and Space Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]).

The Surveyor 3 camera was returned from the Moon in a nylon [[duffel bag]], and was not in the type of sealed airtight metal container used to return lunar samples in the early Apollo missions.  It is therefore possible that it was contaminated by the astronauts and the environment in the Apollo 12 capsule itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/scripts/experiment/exper.cfm?exp_index=1651 |title=LSDA - Experiment: Surveyor 3 Streptococcus Mitis (APSTREPMIT) |accessdate=2011-05-15 |work=Life Sciences Data Archive |publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619225547/http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/scripts/experiment/exper.cfm?exp_index=1651 |archivedate=2010-06-19 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 2011, three researchers co-authored a paper, entitled  "A Microbe on the Moon? Surveyor III and Lessons Learned for Future Sample Return Missions" that assessed the validity of claims that the ''S. mitis'' samples found on the camera had indeed survived for nearly three years on the Moon. The paper concluded that the presence of microbes could more likely be attributed to poor [[clean room]] conditions rather than the survival of bacteria for three years in the harsh moon environment. The paper also discussed the implication this incident would have for contamination control in future space missions.&lt;ref name="David"&gt;{{cite news |first=Leonard |last=David |title=Moon Microbe Mystery Finally Solved |date=2 May 2011 |url=http://www.space.com/11536-moon-microbe-mystery-solved-apollo-12.html |work=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=John D.

Countervailing evidence against the secondary contamination hypothesis is the fact that, according to Lieutenant Colonel Fred Mitchell, lead author of the original 1971 paper&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;Mitchell, F. J., &amp; Ellis, W. L. (1971). [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1971LPSC....2.2721M Surveyor III: Bacterium isolated from lunar retrieved TV camera]. In A.A. Levinson (ed.). Proceedings of the second lunar science conference. MIT Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; there was a significant delay before the sampled culture began growing: this is consistent with the sampled bacteria consisting of dormant cells, but not if the sampled culture was the result of fresh contamination. In addition, according to Mitchell, the microbes clung exclusively to the foam during culturing, which would not have happened had there been contamination.&lt;ref name = "David" /&gt; Furthermore, if fresh contamination had occurred, millions of individual bacteria and "a representation of the entire microbial population would be expected"; instead, only a few individual bacteria were sampled, and only from a single species.&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt;

This subject was covered in the 2008 Discovery Channel documentary series, ''[[When We Left Earth]]'' and on episode of the [[Science Channel]] series ''[[Nasa's Unexplained Files]]'' entitled ''Return of the Moon Bugs''.

'''Richard Nicholls''' (1624 in [[Ampthill]], Bedfordshire – 28 May 1672 on the [[North Sea]], off [[Suffolk]]) was the first [[English colonial empire|English colonial]] governor of [[Province of New York|New York province]].

==Early life==
Nicholls was born in 1624 in [[Ampthill]] in [[Bedfordshire]], [[England]].  He was the son of Francis Nicolls (1582–1624), a [[barrister]] and [[Member of Parliament]], and Margaret ([[née]] Bruce) Nicolls (1577–1652),&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; who were married at [[Abbots Langley]] in 1609.  His mother was a daughter of [[George Bruce of Carnock|Sir George Bruce]] of [[Carnock]] (c. 1550–1625), a Scottish merchant who built [[Culross Palace]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Papers on Mining in Scotland, 18th and 19th centuries|publisher =Archives Hub|url =http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/02092505.html|accessdate =17 October 2008|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://archive.is/20120801191243/http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/02092505.html|archivedate =1 August 2012|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a niece of [[Edward Bruce, 1st Lord Kinloss]] (1548–1611).&lt;ref name="BoB"&gt;{{cite book

==Career==
He commanded a royalist troop of horse (i.e., cavalry) during the [[English Civil War]], and on the defeat of the king went into exile. Soon after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] he became [[Groom of the Chamber]] to the [[James II of England|Duke of York]]. 

===Province of New York===
Through the influence of the Duke of York, in 1664 he was appointed on a commission with Sir [[Robert Carr]] (d. 1667), George Cartwright, and [[Samuel Maverick (colonist)|Samuel Maverick]], to conquer [[New Netherlands]] from the Dutch and to regulate the affairs of the New England colonies and settle disputes among them. The expedition set sail from [[Portsmouth]] on 25 May 1664, and arrived in [[New Amsterdam]] on 27 August 1664.&lt;ref name=WDL&gt;{{cite web|title=Articles about the Transfer of New Netherland on the 27th of August, Old Style, Anno 1664|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4062|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Amsterdam was surrendered to Nicolls on 8 September 1664. Under authority of a commission from the Duke (later King James) Nicolls assumed the position of deputy-governor of New Netherlands (New York).&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

He made [[74th Street (Manhattan)|74th Street]], beginning at the [[East River]], the southern border patent line (which was called the "Harlem Line") of the village of Nieuw Haarlem (later, the village of [[History of Harlem|Harlem]]); the English also renamed the village "Lancaster".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t0gj61QSgk8C&amp;pg=PA521&amp;dq=%2274th+street%22+harlem+british&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=X95pUdv1DePi4APfvYHgCw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%2274th%20street%22%20harlem%20british&amp;f=false |title=AIA Guide to New York City |author=Elliot Willensky and Fran Leadon |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2010 |accessdate=April 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_8Rds6AN-fYC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=%2274th+street%22+harlem+british&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=X95pUdv1DePi4APfvYHgCw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%2274th%20street%22%20harlem%20british&amp;f=false |title=Manhattanville: Old Heart of West Harlem |author=Eric K.

His policy was vigorous but tactful, and the transition to the new regime was made smoothly and with due regard to the interests of the conquered people. The formerly Dutch colonists were guaranteed in the possession of their property rights, their laws of inheritance, and the enjoyment of religious freedom. The [[English law|English system of law]] and administration was at once introduced into [[Long Island]], [[Staten Island]] and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], where the English element already predominated, but the change was made much more slowly in the Dutch sections. A code of laws, known as the "Duke's Laws", drafted by the governor with the help of his secretary, and nephew, [[Matthias Nicolls]] (c. 1630–1687), and dated 12 March, was proclaimed at [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead]], [[Long Island]], on 1 March 1665 and continued in force until 1683; the code was compiled from the codes of the [[New England]] colonies, and it provided for trial by jury, for proportional taxation on property, for the issuance of new patents for land and for land tenure only by licence from the duke. 

===Return to England===
Nicolls returned to England in the summer of 1668 and continued in the service of the [[Duke of York]] and was replaced by [[Francis Lovelace]] as governor. He was killed in the naval [[Battle of Solebay|battle of Southwold Bay]] on 28 May 1672. His monument at [[Ampthill]] incorporates the cannonball that killed him.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Richard Nicolls {{!}} English governor|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Nicolls|website=britannica.com|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=29 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''skull and crossbones''' is a [[symbol]] consisting of a [[human skull]] and two [[long bone]]s crossed together under or behind the skull.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/skull%2520and%2520crossbones|title=Dictionary and Thesaurus {{!}} Merriam-Webster|website=Merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The design originates in the [[Late Middle Ages]] as a symbol of [[death]] and especially as a ''[[memento mori]]'' on tombstones.

In modern contexts, it is generally used as a [[hazard symbol]] that warns of danger, usually in regard to [[poison]]ous substances,  such as deadly chemicals.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[Unicode]] uses {{unichar|2620|SKULL AND CROSSBONES}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emojipedia.org/skull-and-crossbones/ |title=Skull and Crossbones Emoji |website=[[Emojipedia]]|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the symbol.

==History of the symbol==
[[File:Skeletal Arrangements, Sedlec Ossuary (6282842433).jpg|thumb|170px|The skull-and-crossbone symbol depicts the typical arrangement of skulls and [[humerus|humeri]] in [[ossuary|ossuaries]], as in the example above from [[Sedlec Ossuary|Sedlec]] (Czech Republic).]] 
The symbol is an ancient one, becoming widespread with the medieval ''[[Danse Macabre]]'' symbolism. From at least the 12th century, it has been used for military flags or insignia and as a warning of the ferocity of the unit displaying it. It became [[Jolly Roger|associated with piracy]] from the 14th century onwards, possibly even earlier. By the 15th century, the symbol had developed into its familiar form.

The [[Knights Templar]] organisation, active from the 12th century until their demise in 1307, adopted a skull-and-crossbones flag to identify ships belonging to their vast fleet. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_skullbones06.htm|title=Symbolism of the Skull and Crossbones - Otherwise Known as the Deaths Head|website=Bibliotecapleyades.net|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skull and crossbones as a pirate's flag could well predate the [[Knights Templar]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysafetysign.com/poison-symbol-history|title=History of the Skull &amp; Crossbones Symbol Used in Poison Warning Signs and Labels|website=Mysafetysign.com|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbol came to be used to mark the entrances of many graveyards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~dicummings/ABCM/Religious%20Items.html|title=BLESSED IF I KNOW|website=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly [[Skull and crossbones (Spanish cemetery)|Spanish cemeteries]] and also as an easily identifiable warning on poison and other dangerous liquid and powder containers since the 19th century.
The skull and crossbones were also popular on crucifixes made in Northern Europe during the 18th and 19th century, worn on rosaries or as larger wall hangings in religious orders [[Memento Mori]] and symbolising Christ's victory over death. These crucifixes were also placed on coffins during a funeral and then later given to the deceased's family &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosaryworkshop.com/MUSEUM-CRUCIFIXES-MB-European.htm|title=Rosary Workshop: Rosary - Museum Crucifixes Europe  -  (Early Latin American) Skulls|first=Margot|last=Blair|website=Rosaryworkshop.com|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military use==
{{main article|Skull and crossbones (military)}}
{{further|Totenkopf|Jolly Roger#Military use}}
The skull and bones are often used in military insignia, e.g. in coats of arms of some military regiments.

==Symbol for poison==
In 1829, [[New York State]] required the labeling of all containers of poisonous substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=N4N9bsxc2LYC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=skull+and+crossbones+symbol+of+poison&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhi4jak8vXAhUBJFAKHWuTBqIQuwUIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=History of Drug Containers and Their Labels|first1=George B.|last1=Griffenhagen|first2=Mary|last2=Bogard|date=19 November 1999|publisher=Amer. Inst. History of Pharmacy|accessdate=19 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skull and crossbones symbol appears to have been used for that purpose since the 1850s. Previously a variety of motifs had been used, including the [[Denmark|Danish]] "+ + +" and drawings of [[skeleton]]s.

In the 1870s poison manufacturers around the world began using bright [[Cobalt glass|cobalt]] bottles with a variety of raised bumps and designs (to enable easy recognition in the dark) to indicate poison, but by the 1880s the skull and cross bones had become ubiquitous, and the brightly coloured bottles lost their association.

As the skull-and-crossbones symbol has also entered popular culture in the context of [[Pirates in popular culture|piracy]] and is undoubtedly its most well known icon, and since cartoonish pirates have become popular characters with children, there have been concerns that the "poison" symbol might have the effect of attracting the curiosity of small children familiar with "pirates" as depicted as a toy or play theme.
For this reason, in the United States there has been a proposal to replace the skull and crossbones by the "[[Mr. Yuk]]" symbol. However,  Mr. Yuk and his graphic rendering are [[Trademark|registered trademark]]s and [[service mark]]s of his creator, the [[UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh]], and the rendering itself is additionally protected by copyright. This means that the name and graphic image cannot be used without a license from the owner&amp;mdash;unlike the Skull and crossbones, which is in the public domain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3170">'''Stenospermocarpy''' is the biological mechanism that produces [[parthenocarpy]] (seedlessness) in some fruits, notably many [[table grapes]].

In stenospermocarpic fruits, normal [[pollination]] and [[fertilization]] are still required to ensure that the fruit 'sets', i.e. continues to develop on the plant; however subsequent abortion of the [[embryo]] that began growing following fertilization leads to a near seedless condition. The remains of the undeveloped seed are visible in the fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Soule |first=J. |year=1985 |title=Glossary for Horticultural Crops |publication-place=New York |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-471-88499-6 }}, cited in {{Citation |last1=Huang|first1=Jing-Hao|last2=Ma|first2=Wei-Hong|last3=Liang|first3=Guo-Lu|last4=Zhang|first4=Ling-Yuan|last5=Wang|first5=Wei-Xing|last6=Cai|first6=Zi-Jian|last7=Wen|first7=Shou-Xing|year=2010 |title=Effects of low temperatures on sexual reproduction of 'Tainong 1' mango (''Mangifera indica'') |journal=Scientia Horticulturae |volume=126 |issue=2 |pages=109–119 |doi=10.1016/j.scienta.2010.06.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fruit of seedless grapes is smaller than normal because seeds produce the [[plant hormone]] [[gibberellin]], which causes fruit enlargement. Most commercial seedless grapes are sprayed with [[gibberellin]] to increase the size of the fruit and also to make the fruit clusters less tightly packed. A new cultivar, 'Melissa', has naturally larger fruit so does not require gibberellin sprays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ars.usda.gov/is/pr/1999/990618.htm Ramming, D.W. 1999. New grape trio. ''Agricultural Research'' 47(10): 23.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Grape breeders have developed some new seedless grape [[cultivar]]s by using the embryo rescue technique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/aug97/fruit.pdf Wood, M. 1997. Mouth-watering new fruits ''Agricultural Research'' 45(8): 9-10.]&lt;/ref&gt; Before the tiny embryo aborts, it is removed from the developing fruit and grown in [[tissue culture]] until it is large enough to survive on its own. Embryo rescue allows the crossing of two seedless grape cultivars.

==Seedless grape cultivars==
Seedless grapes are divided into white, red and black types based roughly on fruit color. The most popular seedless grape is known in the United States as '[[Thompson Seedless]]', but was originally known as 'Sultana'. It is believed to be of ancient origin. It is considered a white grape, but is actually a pale green. Other white cultivars are 'Perlette', 'Menindee Seedless', 'Interlaken', 'Himrod', 'Romulanus', 'Lakemont', 'Fayez', and 'Remailey Seedless.' The most popular red seedless in the U.S. is 'Flame Seedless'. Other red cultivars are 'Crimson Seedless', 'Ruby Seedless', 'Suffolk Red', 'Saturn' and 'Pink Reliance'. Some black cultivars are 'Black Beauty', 'Black Monukka', 'Concord Seedless', 'Glenora' and '[[Thomcord (grape)|Thomcord]].'

'''Synchronicity''' ({{lang-de|Synchronizität}}) is a concept, first introduced by [[Analytical psychology|analytical psychologist]] [[Carl Jung]], which holds that events are "meaningful coincidences" if they occur with no [[Causality|causal relationship]] yet seem to be meaningfully related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Cosmos and Psyche |last=Tarnas |first=Richard |year= 2006 |publisher=Penguin Group  |location=New York|isbn=0-670-03292-1 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his career, Jung furnished several different definitions of it.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard D. Beitman (2009) "Coincidence Studies: A Freudian Perspective..."&lt;/ref&gt; Jung defined synchronicity as an "acausal connecting (togetherness) principle," "meaningful coincidence", and "acausal parallelism." He introduced the concept as early as the 1920s but gave a full statement of it only in 1951 in an [[Eranos]] lecture.&lt;ref&gt;Casement, Ann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0g8chpSOI3AC&amp;printsec=frontcover "Who Owns Jung?"], Karnac Books, 2007. {{ISBN|1-85575-403-7}}. Cf. page 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 Jung published a paper "Synchronizität als ein Prinzip akausaler Zusammenhänge" (Synchronicity&amp;nbsp;– An Acausal Connecting Principle)&lt;ref name=Synchronicity&gt;{{cite book |author=Jung, Carl G.|title=Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle|year=1993|publisher=Bollingen Foundation|location=Bollingen, Switzerland|origyear=1952 |isbn=978-0-691-01794-5}} Since included in his ''Collected Works'' volume 8.&lt;/ref&gt; in a volume which also contained a related study by the physicist and Nobel laureate [[Wolfgang Pauli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/centres/psycho/publications/RMpapers.htm|title=Religion, Science, and Synchronicity|author=Roderick Main|year=2000|work=Harvest: Journal for Jungian Studies|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208041508/http://www.essex.ac.uk/centres/psycho/publications/RMpapers.htm|archivedate=2006-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was sometimes critical of Jung's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Metanexus Institute]] Charlene P. E. Burns (2011) [http://www.metanexus.net/essay/wolfgang-pauli-carl-jung-and-acausal-connecting-principle-case-study-transdisciplinarity Wolfgang Pauli, Carl Jung, and the Acausal Connecting Principle: A Case Study in Transdisciplinarity]&lt;/ref&gt; Jung's belief was that, just as events may be connected by causality, they may also be connected by [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. Events connected by meaning need not have an explanation in terms of causality, which does not generally contradict the [[Axiom of Causality]].

Jung used the concept in arguing for the existence of the [[paranormal]].&lt;ref name=Roderick /&gt; A believer in the paranormal, [[Arthur Koestler]] wrote extensively on synchronicity in his 1972 book ''[[The Roots of Coincidence]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Koestler, Arthur (1973). ''The Roots of Coincidence''. Vintage. {{ISBN|0-394-71934-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of synchronicity as extending beyond mere coincidence (as well as the paranormal generally) is widely rejected in the academic and scientific community.

==Description==
[[File:Schéma synchronicité in English.png|thumb|400px|Diagram illustrating Carl Jung's concept of synchronicity]]
Jung coined the word "synchronicity" to describe "temporally coincident occurrences of acausal events." In his book ''[[Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle]]'', Jung wrote:&lt;ref name="Jung 1973 8"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jung |first=Carl |edition=first Princeton/Bollingen paperback|date=1973 |title=Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle |page=8|location=Princeton, New Jersey |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-15050-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation| How are we to recognize acausal combinations of events, since it is obviously impossible to examine all chance happenings for their causality? The answer to this is that acausal events may be expected most readily where, on closer reflection, a causal connection appears to be inconceivable.}}

In the introduction to his book, ''Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal'', Roderick Main wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Main|first1=Roderick|title=Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal|date=1997|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|The culmination of Jung's lifelong engagement with the paranormal is his theory of synchronicity, the view that the structure of reality includes a principle of acausal connection which manifests itself most conspicuously in the form of meaningful coincidences. Difficult, flawed, prone to misrepresentation, this theory none the less remains one of the most suggestive attempts yet made to bring the [[paranormal]] within the bounds of intelligibility.  It has been found relevant by psychotherapists, parapsychologists, researchers of spiritual experience and a growing number of non-specialists. Indeed, Jung's writings in this area form an excellent general introduction to the whole field of the paranormal.}}

In his book ''Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle'', Jung wrote:&lt;ref name="Jung 1973 8"/&gt;
{{quotation|...it is impossible, with our present resources, to explain [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]], or the fact of meaningful coincidence, as a phenomenon of energy. This makes an end of the causal explanation as well, for "effect" cannot be understood as anything except a phenomenon of energy. Therefore it cannot be a question of cause and effect, but of a falling together in time, a kind of simultaneity. Because of this quality of simultaneity, I have picked on the term "synchronicity" to designate a hypothetical factor equal in rank to causality as a principle of explanation.}}

Synchronicity was a principle which, Jung felt, gave conclusive evidence for his concepts of [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]] and the [[collective unconscious]].&lt;ref&gt;Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.&lt;/ref&gt; It described a governing dynamic which underlies the whole of human experience and history — social, emotional, psychological, and spiritual. The emergence of the synchronistic [[paradigm]] was a significant move away from [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]] towards an underlying philosophy of [[double-aspect theory]]. Some argue this shift was essential to bringing theoretical coherence to Jung's earlier work.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, R.S. (2014). Evolving Attitudes. ''International Journal of Jungian Studies'', 6.3, 243–253.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this [[phenomenon]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Even at Jung's presentation of his work on synchronicity in 1951 at an [[Eranos]] lecture, his ideas on synchronicity were evolving.  On Feb. 25, 1953, in a letter to Carl Seelig, the Swiss author and journalist who wrote a biography of Albert Einstein, Jung wrote, "Professor Einstein was my guest on several occasions at dinner. . . These were very early days when Einstein was developing his first theory of relativity [and] It was he who first started me on thinking about a possible relativity of time as well as space, and their psychic conditionality. More than 30 years later the stimulus led to my relation with the physicist professor W. Pauli and to my thesis of psychic synchronicity."&lt;ref name=Synchronicity /&gt; 

Following discussions with both [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Wolfgang Pauli]], Jung believed there were parallels between synchronicity and aspects of [[relativity theory]] and [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Igor V. Limar |title=Carl G. Jung’s Synchronicity and Quantum Entanglement: Schrödinger’s Cat ‘Wanders’ Between Chromosomes |url=http://www.neuroquantology.com/index.php/journal/article/view/376  |journal=NeuroQuantology |volume= 09 |page=313 |year=2011 |archiveurl = https://www.academia.edu/1248055/Carl_G._Jung_s_Synchronicity_and_Quantum_Entanglement_Schrodinger_s_Cat_Wanders_Between_Chromosomes |archivedate = 2011-06-30| issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=December 2018}} 

Jung believed life was not a series of random events but rather an expression of a deeper order, which he and Pauli referred to as ''[[Unus mundus]]''. This deeper order led to the insights that a person was both embedded in a universal wholeness and that the realisation of this was more than just an intellectual exercise, but also had elements of a spiritual awakening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Main|first1=Roderick|title=Revelations of Chance: Synchronicity as Spiritual Experience|date=2007|publisher=The State University of New York Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the religious perspective, synchronicity shares similar characteristics of an "intervention of grace". Jung also believed that in a person's life, synchronicity served a role similar to that of dreams, with the purpose of shifting a person's egocentric conscious thinking to greater wholeness.

==Examples==
[[File:Cetonia-aurata.jpg|thumb|''[[Cetonia aurata]]'']]
In his book ''Synchronicity'' Jung tells the following story as an example of a synchronistic event:
{{Quote|text=My example concerns a young woman patient who, in spite of efforts made on both sides, proved to be psychologically inaccessible. The difficulty lay in the fact that she always knew better about everything. Her excellent education had provided her with a weapon ideally suited to this purpose, namely a highly polished Cartesian rationalism with an impeccably "geometrical" idea of reality. After several fruitless attempts to sweeten her rationalism with a somewhat more human understanding, I had to confine myself to the hope that something unexpected and irrational would turn up, something that would burst the intellectual retort into which she had sealed herself. Well, I was sitting opposite her one day, with my back to the window, listening to her flow of rhetoric. She had an impressive dream the night before, in which someone had given her a golden scarab — a costly piece of jewellery. While she was still telling me this dream, I heard something behind me gently tapping on the window. I turned round and saw that it was a fairly large flying insect that was knocking against the window-pane from outside in the obvious effort to get into the dark room. This seemed to me very strange. I opened the window immediately and caught the insect in the air as it flew in. It was a scarabaeid beetle, or common rose-chafer (''Cetonia aurata''), whose gold-green colour most nearly resembles that of a golden scarab. I handed the beetle to my patient with the words, "Here is your scarab." This experience punctured the desired hole in her rationalism and broke the ice of her intellectual resistance. The treatment could now be continued with satisfactory results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jung |first=C.G. |title=Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle|year=1969 |publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-691-15050-5 |pages=109–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The French writer [[Émile Deschamps]] claims in his memoirs that, in 1805, he was treated to some plum pudding by a stranger named Monsieur de Fontgibu. Ten years later, the writer encountered plum pudding on the menu of a Paris restaurant and wanted to order some, but the waiter told him that the last dish had already been served to another customer, who turned out to be de Fontgibu. Many years later, in 1832, Deschamps was at a dinner and once again ordered plum pudding. He recalled the earlier incident and told his friends that only de Fontgibu was missing to make the setting complete – and in the same instant, the now-senile de Fontgibu entered the room, having got the wrong address.&lt;ref&gt;Emile Deschamps, Oeuvres completes : Tomes I–VI, Reimpr. de l'ed. de Paris 1872–74&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung wrote, after describing some examples, "When coincidences pile up in this way, one cannot help being impressed by them – for the greater the number of terms in such a series, or the more unusual its character, the more improbable it becomes."&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung  Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wolfgang Pauli young.jpg|left|thumb|Wolfgang Pauli]]In his book ''Thirty Years That Shook Physics – The Story of Quantum Theory'' (1966), George Gamow writes about [[Wolfgang Pauli]], who was apparently considered a person particularly associated with synchronicity events. Gamow whimsically refers to the "[[Pauli effect]]", a mysterious phenomenon which is not understood on a purely materialistic basis, and probably never will be. The following anecdote is told:
{{Quotation|It is well known that theoretical physicists cannot handle experimental equipment; it breaks whenever they touch it. Pauli was such a good theoretical physicist that something usually broke in the lab whenever he merely stepped across the threshold. A mysterious event that did not seem at first to be connected with Pauli's presence once occurred in Professor J. Franck's laboratory in Göttingen. Early one afternoon, without apparent cause, a complicated apparatus for the study of atomic phenomena collapsed. Franck wrote humorously about this to Pauli at his Zürich address and, after some delay, received an answer in an envelope with a Danish stamp. Pauli wrote that he had gone to visit Bohr and at the time of the mishap in Franck's laboratory his train was stopped for a few minutes at the Göttingen railroad station. You may believe this anecdote or not, but there are many other observations concerning the reality of the Pauli Effect! &lt;ref&gt;Thirty Years That Shook Physics – The Story of Quantum Theory, George Gamow, p. 64, Doubleday &amp; Co. Inc. New York, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Relationship with causality==
[[Causality]], when defined expansively (as for instance in the "mystic psychology" book ''[[The Kybalion]]'', or in the [[plato]]nic [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]-style [[Axiom of Causality]]), states that "nothing can happen without being caused." Such an understanding of causality may be incompatible with synchronicity. Other definitions of causality (for example, the [[David Hume#Causation|neo-Humean]] definition) are concerned only with the relation of cause to effect. As such, they are compatible with synchronicity. There are also opinions which hold that, where there is no external observable cause, the cause can be internal.&lt;ref&gt;Psychologies of Mind: The Collected Papers of [[John Maze]], edited by Rachael Henry&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also pointed out that, since Jung took into consideration only the narrow definition of causality – only the [[Four causes#Efficient cause|efficient cause]] – his notion of "''acausality''" is also narrow and so is not applicable to [[Four causes#Final cause|final]] and [[Four causes#Formal cause|formal]] causes as understood in [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] or [[Thomism|Thomist]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;James Arraj (1996) ''The Mystery of Matter: Nonlocality, Morphic Resonance, Synchronicity and the Philosophy of Nature of St. Thomas Aquinas, [http://www.innerexplorations.com/catchmeta/mys8.htm ch. 8. Synchronicity and Formal Causality]''&lt;/ref&gt; The final causality is inherent&lt;ref&gt;Victor Mansfield, (1995), ''Synchronicity, Science and Soul-Making: Understanding Jungian Synchronicity Through Physics, Buddhism, and Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; in synchronicity (because it leads to [[individuation]]) or synchronicity can be a kind of replacement for final causality; however, such [[finalism]] or [[teleology]] is considered to be outside the domain of modern science.

==Explanations==

===Religion===

Many people believe that the Universe or God causes synchronicities. Among the general public, divine intervention is the most widely accepted explanation for meaningful coincidences.&lt;ref name=Roderick&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rushnell|first1=S.|title=When God winks|date=2006|publisher=Atria Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Mathematics===

Jung and his followers (e.g., Marie-Louise von Franz) share in common the belief that numbers are the archetypes of order, and the major participants in synchronicity creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Number and Time: Reflections Leading toward a Unification of Depth Psychology and Physics. |last=Von Franz |first=M.L. |year= 1974 |publisher=Northwestern University Press|}}&lt;/ref&gt;This hypothesis has implications that are relevant to some of the “chaotic” phenomena in nonlinear dynamics. [[Dynamical systems theory]] has provided a new context from which to speculate about synchronicity because it gives predictions about the transitions between emergent states of order and nonlocality.&lt;ref&gt;Hogenson, G. B. (2005). The self, the symbolic and synchronicity: Virtual realities and the emergence of the psyche. ''Journal of Analytical Psychology'', 50, 271–284. https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0021-8774.2005.00531.x&lt;/ref&gt; This view, however, is not part of mainstream mathematical thought.

===Quantum Physics===

According to a certain view, synchronicity serves as a way of making sense of or describing some aspects of quantum mechanics. It argues that quantum experiments demonstrate that, at least in the microworld of subatomic particles, there is an instantaneous connection between particles no matter how far away they are from one another. Known as quantum non-locality or [[Quantum_entanglement|entanglement]], the proponents of this view argue that this points to a unified field that precedes physical reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Mind, Matter and Quantum Mechanics.|last=Stapp |first=H.P. |year= 2015 |publisher=Springer Verlag  |location=Berlin, Heidelberg|}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with archetypal reasoning, the proponents argue that two events can correspond to each other (e.g. particle with particle, or person with person) in a meaningful way. 

Synchronicity can also be seen in [[David Bohm]]'s theory of [[implicate order]]. According to Bohm's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Wholeness and the implicate order.|last=Bohm |first=David |year= 1980 |publisher=Routledge   |location=London, UK|}}&lt;/ref&gt; theory, there are three major realms of existence: the explicate (unfolded) order, the implicate (enfolded) order, and a source or ground beyond both. The flowing movement of the whole can thus be understood as a process of continuous enfolding and unfolding of order or structure. From moment to moment there is a rhythmic pulse between implicate and explicate realities. Therefore, synchronicity would literally take place as the bridge between implicate and explicate orders, whose complementary nature define the undivided totality.

===Probability theory===

Mainstream mathematics argues that statistics and probability theory (exemplified in, e.g., [[Littlewood's law]] or the [[law of truly large numbers]]) suffice to explain any purported synchronistic events as mere [[coincidence]]s.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;John Navin, interview with [[David Hand (statistician)|David Hand]], (2014), [https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnnavin/2014/02/18/why-coincidences-miracles-and-rare-events-happen-every-day/3/ Why Coincidences, Miracles And Rare Events Happen Every Day], [[Forbes]].com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Lane &amp; Andrea Diem Lane, 2010, [http://www.integralworld.net/lane15.html DESULTORY DECUSSATION Where Littlewood’s Law of Miracles meets Jung’s Synchronicity], www.integralworld.net&lt;/ref&gt; The law of large numbers, for instance, states that in large enough populations, any strange event is arbitrarily likely to happen by mere chance. However, some proponents of synchronicity question whether it is even sensible in principle to try to evaluate synchronicity statistically. Jung himself and von Franz argued that statistics work precisely by ignoring what is unique about the individual case, whereas synchronicity tries to investigate that uniqueness.  

Among some psychologists, Jung's works, such as ''The Interpretation of Nature and the Psyche'', were received as problematic. Fritz Levi, in his 1952 review in ''Neue Schweizer Rundschau'' (New Swiss Observations), critiqued Jung's theory of synchronicity as vague in determinability of synchronistic events, saying that Jung never specifically explained his rejection of "magic causality" to which such an acausal principle as synchronicity would be related. He also questioned the theory's usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Bishop|first = Paul|title = Synchronicity and Intellectual Intuition in Kant, Swedenborg, and Jung| publisher = The Edwin Mellen Press
|year = 2000| pages = 59–62| isbn = 0-7734-7593-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===

In [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]], [[confirmation bias]] is a tendency to search for or interpret new information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions, and avoids information and interpretations that contradict prior beliefs. It is a type of [[cognitive bias]] and represents an error of [[inductive inference]], or is a form of [[selection bias]] toward confirmation of the hypothesis under study, or disconfirmation of an alternative hypothesis. Confirmation bias is of interest in the teaching of [[critical thinking]], as the skill is misused if rigorous critical scrutiny is applied only to evidence that challenges a preconceived idea, but not to evidence that supports it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/timvangelder/publications-1/heads-i-win-tails-you-lose-desire-s-hold-over-reason/HeadsIWin.pdf Tim van Gelder, "Heads I win, tails you lose": A Foray Into the Psychology of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, in psychology and sociology, the term [[apophenia]] is used for the mistaken detection of a pattern or meaning in random or meaningless data.&lt;ref&gt;Brugger, Peter. "From Haunted Brain to Haunted Science: A Cognitive Neuroscience View of Paranormal and Pseudoscientific Thought", ''Hauntings and Poltergeists: Multidisciplinary Perspectives'', edited by J. Houran and R. Lange (North Carolina: [[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland &amp; Company, Inc. Publishers]], 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptics, such as Robert Todd Carroll of the Skeptic's Dictionary, argue that the perception of synchronicity is better explained as apophenia. Primates use pattern detection in their form of intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03201828 Pattern recognition of behavioral events in the nonhuman primate]&lt;/ref&gt; and this can lead to erroneous identification of non-existent patterns. A famous example of this is the fact that human face recognition is so robust, and based on such a basic archetype (essentially two dots and a line contained in a circle), that human beings are very prone to identify faces in random data all through their environment, like the "man in the moon", or faces in wood grain, an example of the visual form of apophenia known as [[pareidolia]].&lt;ref name="faces"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/13/health/psychology/13face.html|title=Facial Recognition – Brain – Faces, Faces Everywhere|publisher=New York Times|first=Elizabeth | last=Svoboda | date= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Charles Tart]] sees danger in synchronistic thinking: 'This danger is the temptation to mental laziness. [...] it would be very tempting to say, "Well, it's synchronistic, it's forever beyond my understanding," and so (prematurely) give up trying to find a causal explanation.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Tart]],  [http://www.roma1.infn.it/rog/group/frasca/b/synchtart.html Causality and Synchronicity – Steps Toward Clarification], (1981), [[Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research]], vol. 75, pp. 121–141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyway, synchronicity cannot be attained to by mere intellectual means. It is an autonomous phenomenon that is not invented by the intellect, but rather, experienced. synchronicity is a self produced image spontaneously blossoming from the psyche as a whole that simultaneously reflects and effects what is going on within the very psyche that produced it. It has also been argued that [[Analytical psychology|Jungian psychology's]] theory of synchronicity is equivalent to intellectual [[Intuition (psychology)|intuition]].&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, pp. 17–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vitalik Buterin''' ({{lang-ru|Виталий Дмитриевич Бутерин}}; born January 31, 1994) is a [[Russia]]n-[[Canada|Canadian]] [[computer programming|programmer]] and writer primarily known as a co-founder of [[Ethereum]] and as a co-founder of ''[[Bitcoin Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=finley2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=melendez2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=delcastillo2013/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Buterin was born in [[Kolomna]], [[Moscow Oblast]], [[Russia]], to Dmitry Buterin, a computer scientist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://business.financialpost.com/feature/the-cryptocurrency-prophet|title=Vitalik Buterin: The cryptocurrency prophet|last=Brownell|first=Claire|date=2017-06-27|work=Financial Post|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Natalia Ameline (née Chistyakova). He lived in the area until the age of six when his parents emigrated to [[Canada]] in search of better employment opportunities.&lt;ref name="Uncanny" /&gt; While in grade three of elementary school in Canada, Buterin was placed into a class for gifted children&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/22/meet-vitalik-buterin-the-founder-of-bitcoin-rival-ethereum.html|title=Meet Vitalik Buterin, the 23-year-old founder of bitcoin rival ethereum|last=Snyder|first=Benjamin|date=2017-06-23|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started to understand that he was drawn to math, programming, and economics. He also had the ability to add three-digit numbers in his head at twice the speed of his peers.&lt;ref name="Uncanny"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/06/the-uncanny-mind-that-built-ethereum/|title=The Uncanny Mind That Built Ethereum|last=Peck|first=Morgen|date=2016-06-13|work=Backchannel|accessdate=2016-06-15|publisher=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buterin attended the [[The Abelard School|Abelard School]], a private high school in Toronto, for four years,&lt;ref name="Stu" /&gt; which he said, "proved to be among the most interesting and productive years of my life; the closer connection between students and teachers [&amp;] the level of depth at which the material was taught, made me want to learn, and to focus on learning as my primary goal".&lt;ref name="Stu"&gt;{{cite web |title= Students |url= https://www.abelardschool.org/students |website= Abelard School |accessdate=7 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buterin has written that although he was "never particularly inspired by the traditional education system",&lt;ref name="Stu" /&gt; when subjects were presented with "dedication and focus on intellectual inquiry", he said:
: "I noticed my attitude and my results almost immediately and drastically change. Education is ultimately much more than simply memorizing individual facts, or even learning individual concepts. [What] matters most: learning how to think, learning how to reason and learning how to learn."&lt;ref name=Stu/&gt;

Buterin learned about Bitcoin, from his father, at age 17.&lt;ref name=Uncanny/&gt; In 2012, he obtained a bronze medal in the International Olympiad in Informatics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.ioi2012.org/competition/results-2/ |title= Results {{!}} IOI 2012 |website= www.ioi2012.org |access-date= 2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, he visited developers in other countries who shared his enthusiasm for code. He returned to Toronto later that year and published a [[white paper]] proposing Ethereum.&lt;ref name="CanadianBusiness_Vit"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.canadianbusiness.com/innovation/change-agent/vitalik-buterin-ethereum |title= Change Agents 2016: Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum |last= Braga |first= Matthew |date= 13 Oct 2016 |publisher= Canadian Business |accessdate= 6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[University of Waterloo]] but dropped out in 2014, when he received the [[Thiel Fellowship]] in the amount of $100,000,&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; and went to work on Ethereum full-time.&lt;ref name="Elliot"&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://canadaam.ctvnews.ca/why-a-20-year-old-toronto-drop-out-accepted-100-000-to-stay-out-of-school-1.1895631 |title= Why a 20-year-old Toronto drop-out accepted $100,000 to stay out of school |date= July 2, 2014 |accessdate= 25 April 2016 |website= CTV |last= Elliot |first= Josh }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 25, 2017, Buterin was the subject of a [[death hoax]] originating from [[4chan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.bitsonline.com/ethereum-vitalik-death-hoax/ |title= 4chan’s Vitalik Buterin Death Hoax Crashes Ethereum Price |date= 2017-06-25 |website= Bitsonline |language= en-US |access-date= 2017-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
=== Beginnings at ''Bitcoin Magazine'' ===
{{main|Bitcoin Magazine}}
Buterin met a person on a bitcoin chat forum trying to start a bitcoin blog. The owner offered five bitcoin (about $3.50) to anyone who would write an article for him. Buterin wrote for the site until its website shut down soon thereafter due to Bitcoin's lack of mainstream attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Vitalik Buterin|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkeCapBOQQ0|publisher=Bitcorati, Inc.|date=January 10, 2014|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, another person reached out to Buterin about a new publication called ''[[Bitcoin Magazine]]'', a position which Buterin would accept as the first co-founder, and contribute as a leading writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stankovic|first1=Stefan|title=Who is Vitalik Buterin, The Mastermind Behind Ethereum?|url=https://unblock.net/who-is-vitalik-buterin/|accessdate=19 April 2018|work=Unblock|date=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition Buterin wrote about bitcoin-related topics for other publications, including ''Bitcoin Weekly''.&lt;ref name=finley2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=bm-about/&gt; ''Bitcoin Magazine'' in 2012 later began publishing a print edition and has been referred to as the first serious publication dedicated to cryptocurrencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHbCBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=Vitalik+Buterin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwih0oXUn6nMAhVssIMKHSZUDysQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Vitalik%20Buterin&amp;f=false|title=The Age of Cryptocurrency: How Bitcoin and the Blockchain Are Challenging ...|last2=Casey|first2=Michael J.|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|year=2015|isbn=9781250065636|location=|page=88|pages=|chapter=Community|last1=Vigna|first1=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bitcoin Magazine'' was then purchased by [[BTC Media]], where Buterin continued to write until mid-2014.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In addition, he held a position on the editorial board of ''[[Ledger (journal)|Ledger]]'', a peer-reviewed scholarly journal that publishes full-length original research articles on the subjects of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.&lt;ref name=ledger2016/&gt;

=== Ethereum ===
{{main|Ethereum}}
Buterin is a co-founder and inventor of Ethereum, described as a "decentralised mining network and software development platform rolled into one"&lt;ref name=haj2014/&gt; that facilitates the creation of new cryptocurrencies and programs that share a single [[Bitcoin#Blockchain|blockchain]] (a cryptographic transaction ledger).&lt;ref name=aron2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://futurethinkers.org/vitalik-buterin-ethereum-decentralized-future/|title=Vitalik Buterin on Ethereum and The Decentralized Future|date=2015-04-21|website=Future Thinkers Podcast|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buterin first described Ethereum in a white paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper |title=White Paper· ethereum/wiki Wiki · GitHub |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328054135/https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper |archivedate=28 March 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in late 2013. Buterin argued that bitcoin needed a scripting language for application development. But when he failed to gain agreement, he proposed development of a new platform with a more general scripting language.&lt;ref name=tapscott2016&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tapscott |first1=Don |last2=Tapscott |first2=Alex |title=The Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin is Changing Money, Business, and the World |date=2016-05-07 |publisher=Portfolio |isbn=978-0670069972}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|88}} About the Ethereum Project, Buterin has said: "I am truly grateful to have the opportunity to work in such an interesting and interdisciplinary area of industry, where I have the chance to interact with cryptographers, mathematicians and economists prominent in their fields, to help build software and tools that already affect tens of thousands of people around the world, and to work on advanced problems in computer science, economics and philosophy every week."&lt;ref name=Stu/&gt;

=== Open source software ===
Buterin has contributed as a developer to other open source software projects.&lt;ref name=finley2014/&gt; Some early examples are: Kryptokit, pybitcointools, multisig.info, and btckeysplit.&lt;ref name="Pedigree"&gt;{{cite web |last= Southurst |first=Jon |work=[[CoinDesk]]|url=http://www.coindesk.com/ver-buterin-join-bitcoin-browser-wallet-kryptokit/ |title= Roger Ver and Erik Voorhees Back Bitcoin Wallet KryptoKit |date= 7 January 2014 |accessdate= 25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also contributed to DarkWallet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OHbCBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=Vitalik+Buterin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwih0oXUn6nMAhVssIMKHSZUDysQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Vitalik%20Buterin&amp;f=false |title= The Bitcoin Big Bang: How Alternative Currencies Are About to Change the World |date=2015 |publisher= [[Wiley Publishing]] |year= |isbn= 978-1118963661 |location= |page=156 |chapter= Smart Money, set it and forget it |last1=Kelly |first1= Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Cody Wilson]], [[Bitcoin]] [[Python (software)|Python]] libraries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mastering Bitcoin: Unlocking Digital Cryptocurrencies |last1= Antonopoulos |first1=Andreas M. |chapter=#4. Keys, Addresses, and Wallets |page=82 |isbn= 978-1449374044 |date= December 20, 2014 |publisher= [[O'Reilly Media]] |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IXmrBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=Vitalik+Buterin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwis7O7gsKnMAhUU72MKHak3Ajk4ChDoAQggMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Vitalik%20Buterin&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[cryptocurrency]] marketplace site Egora.&lt;ref name=melendez2014/&gt;

=== Ethereum Russia ===
As Buterin was recognizing the economic and political relevance of the Ethereum enterprise for his native Russia, he talked shortly with [[Vladimir Putin]] on June 2nd 2017, at the [[St. Petersburg International Economic Forum]] (SPIEF) event. The president of Russia stated that he "supported the idea of establishing ties with possible Russian partners".&lt;ref&gt;
