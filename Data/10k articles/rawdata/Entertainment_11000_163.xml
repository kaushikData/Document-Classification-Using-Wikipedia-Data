[[File:Antoine Watteau - Actors from the Comédie Française - WGA25475.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Actors from the [[Comédie-Française]], {{Circa|1720}}.]]
An '''actor''' is a person who portrays a [[Character (arts)|character]] in a performance (also '''actress'''; [[#The term actress|see below]]).&lt;ref&gt;"The dramatic world can be extended to include the 'author', the 'audience' and even the 'theatre'; but these remain 'possible' surrogates, not the 'actual' referents as such" (Elam 1980, 110).&lt;/ref&gt; The actor performs "in the flesh" in the traditional medium of the [[theatre]] or in modern mediums such as [[film]], [[radio]], and [[television]]. The analogous Greek term is {{wikt-lang|grc|ὑποκριτής|italic=yes}} ({{grc-transl|ὑποκριτής}}), literally "one who answers".&lt;ref name="hypocrite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/actor?q=actor|title=Definition of actor}}''Hypokrites'' (related to our word for [[Hypocrisy|hypocrite]]) also means, less often, "to answer" the [[Tragedy|tragic]] [[Greek chorus|chorus]]. See Weimann (1978, 2); see also Csapo and Slater, who offer translations of classical source material using the term ''hypocrisis'' ([[acting]]) (1994, 257, 265–267).&lt;/ref&gt; The actor's interpretation of their role—the art of [[acting]]—pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is "playing themselves", as in some forms of experimental [[performance art]].

Formerly, in [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]], the [[Middle Ages|medieval world]], and the time of [[William Shakespeare]], only men could become actors, and women's roles were generally played by men or boys.&lt;ref name="Neziroski 2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/narrativelyricdrama.htm|title=narrative, lyric, drama|last=Neziroski |first=Lirim|year=2003|work=Theories of Media :: Keywords Glossary :: multimedia|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=2009-03-14|quote=For example, until the late 1600s, audiences were opposed to seeing women on stage, because of the belief stage performance reduced them to the status of showgirls and prostitutes. Even Shakespeare's plays were performed by boys dressed in drag.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[English Restoration]] of 1660, women began to appear on stage in England. In modern times, particularly in pantomime and some operas, women occasionally play the roles of boys or young men.&lt;ref name="PDF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s-sj.org/pdfs/St-Dusinberre-web.pdf|format=PDF|title=Boys Becoming Women in Shakespeare’s Plays|author=JULIET DUSINBERRE|website=S-sj.org\accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The term actress==
After 1660 in [[Kingdom of England|England]], when women first started to appear on stage, the terms ''actor'' or ''actress'' were initially used interchangeably for female performers, but later, influenced by the French {{wikt-lang|fr|actrice}}, ''actress'' became the commonly used term for women in theater and film. The [[etymology]] is a simple derivation from ''actor'' with {{Wikt-lang|en|-ess}} added.&lt;ref name="OED2010"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|edition=3|date=November 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|chapter=actress, n.|quote=Although ''actor'' refers to a person who acts regardless of gender, where this term "is increasingly preferred", actress remains in general use; actor is increasingly preferred for performers of both sexes as a gender-neutral term.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When referring to groups of performers of both sexes, ''actors'' is preferred.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/sep/25/readers-editor-actor-or-actress|title=The readers' editor on... Actor or actress?|first=Stephen|last=Pritchard|date=24 September 2011|accessdate=22 October 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Actor'' is also used before the full name of a performer as a gender-specific term.

Within the profession, the re-adoption of the neutral term dates to the [[post-war]] period of the 1950 and '60s, when the contributions of women to cultural life in general were being reviewed.&lt;ref name="De GayGoodman1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goodman|first1=Lizbeth|authorlink1=Lizbeth Goodman|last2=Holledge|first2=Julie|title=The Routledge reader in gender and performance|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-16583-0|pages=8; 93}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''The Observer'' and ''The Guardian'' published their new joint style guide in 2010, it stated "Use ['actor'] for both male and female actors; do not use actress except when in name of award, e.g. Oscar for best actress."&lt;ref name="theguardian.com" /&gt; The guide's authors stated that "actress comes into the same category as authoress, comedienne, manageress, 'lady doctor', 'male nurse' and similar obsolete terms that date from a time when professions were largely the preserve of one sex (usually men)." (See ''[[male as norm]]''). "As [[Whoopi Goldberg]] put it in an interview with the paper: 'An actress can only play a woman. I'm an actor – I can play anything.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="theguardian.com" /&gt; The UK performers' union [[Equity (British trade union)|Equity]] has no policy on the use of "actor" or "actress". An Equity spokesperson said that the union does not believe that there is a consensus on the matter and stated that the "...subject divides the profession".&lt;ref name="theguardian.com" /&gt; In 2009, the ''Los Angeles Times'' stated that "Actress" remains the common term used in major [[acting]] awards given to female recipients&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/18/entertainment/ca-actress18|title=From actor to actress and back again|last=Linden|first=Sheri|date=18 January 2009 |work=Entertainment|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2009-03-14|quote=It would be several decades before the word "actress" appeared – 1700, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, more than a century after the word "actor" was first used to denote a theatrical performer, supplanting the less professional-sounding "player."}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]).

With regard to the [[cinema of the United States]], the gender-neutral term "player" was common in film in the [[silent film]] era and the early days of the [[Motion Picture Production Code]], but in the 2000s in a film context, it is generally deemed [[archaism|archaic]]. However, "player" remains in use in the [[theatre]], often incorporated into the name of a theatre group or company, such as the [[American Players Theatre|American Players]], the [[East West Players]], etc. Also, actors in [[improvisational theatre]] may be referred to as "players".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spolin|first1=Viola|title=Improvisation for the Theater: A Handbook of Teaching and Directing Techniques|date=1999|publisher=Northwestern Univ Press|location=Evanston, Ill|ISBN=0810140004|pages=Introduction to the 3rd Edition|edition=3rd|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/improvisation-for-the-theater-a-handbook-of-teaching-and-directing-techniques/oclc/41176682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first recorded case of a performing actor occurred in 534 BC (though the changes in calendar over the years make it hard to determine exactly) when the [[Greece|Greek]] performer [[Thespis]] stepped onto the stage at the ''Theatre Dionysus'' to become the first known person to speak words as a character in a play or story. Prior to Thespis' act, Grecian stories were only expressed in [[song]], dance, and in [[Perspective (storytelling)|third person]] narrative. In honor of Thespis, actors are commonly called ''Thespians''. The exclusively male actors in the [[theatre of ancient Greece]] performed in three types of [[drama]]: [[tragedy]], [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], and the [[satyr play]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–19).&lt;/ref&gt; Western theatre developed and expanded considerably under the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The [[theatre of ancient Rome]] was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from [[Roman festival|festival]] performances of [[street theatre]], nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of situation [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]], to [[high culture|high-style]], verbally elaborate [[Tragedy|tragedies]].

As the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell into decay through the 4th and 5th centuries, the seat of Roman power shifted to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Records show that [[mime]], [[pantomime]], scenes or recitations from [[tragedy|tragedies]] and [[comedy|comedies]], [[dance]]s, and other entertainments were very popular. From the 5th century, [[Western Europe]] was plunged into a period of general disorder. Small nomadic bands of actors traveled around Europe throughout the period, performing wherever they could find an audience; there is no evidence that they produced anything but crude scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 75)&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, actors were not of high status; therefore, in the [[Early Middle Ages]], traveling acting troupes were often viewed with distrust. Early Middle Ages actors were denounced by the [[Catholic Church|Church]] during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], as they were viewed as dangerous, immoral, and [[pagan]]. In many parts of Europe, traditional beliefs of the region and time period meant actors could not receive a Christian burial.

In the [[Early Middle Ages]], churches in [[Europe]] began staging dramatized versions of biblical events. By the middle of the 11th century, [[liturgical drama]] had spread from [[Russia]] to [[Scandinavia]] to [[Italy]]. The [[Feast of Fools]] encouraged the development of comedy. In the [[Late Middle Ages]], plays were produced in 127 towns. These vernacular [[Mystery plays]] often contained [[comedy]], with actors playing [[devil]]s, [[villain]]s, and [[clown]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 86)&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of actors in these plays were drawn from the local population. Amateur performers in England were exclusively male, but other countries had female performers.

There were a number of secular plays staged in the Middle Ages, the earliest of which is ''The Play of the Greenwood'' by [[Adam de la Halle]] in 1276. It contains satirical scenes and [[Folk culture|folk]] material such as [[faeries]] and other supernatural occurrences. [[Farce]]s also rose dramatically in popularity after the 13th century. At the end of the [[Late Middle Ages]], professional actors began to appear in [[England]] and [[Europe]]. [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] and [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] both maintained small companies of professional actors. Beginning in the mid-16th century, [[Commedia dell'arte]] troupes performed lively improvisational playlets across Europe for centuries. Commedia dell'arte was an actor-centred theatre, requiring little scenery and very few props. Plays were loose frameworks that provided situations, complications, and outcome of the action, around which the actors improvised. The plays utilised [[stock character]]s. A troupe typically consisted of 13 to 14 members. Most actors were paid a share of the play's profits roughly equivalent to the sizes of their roles.

[[File:The Swan cropped.png|thumb|A 1596 sketch of a performance in progress on the [[thrust stage]] of [[The Swan (theatre)|The Swan]], a typical [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan]] open-roof playhouse.]]

Renaissance theatre derived from several medieval theatre traditions, such as the [[mystery plays]], "[[morality play]]s", and the "university drama" that attempted to recreate Athenian tragedy. The Italian tradition of [[Commedia dell'arte]], as well as the elaborate [[masque]]s frequently presented at court, also contributed to the shaping of public theatre. Since before the reign of Elizabeth I, [[Playing company|companies of players]] were attached to households of leading aristocrats and performed seasonally in various locations. These became the foundation for the professional players that performed on the [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan stage]].

The development of the theatre and opportunities for acting ceased when [[Puritan]] opposition to the stage banned the performance of all plays within London. Puritans viewed the theatre as immoral. The re-opening of the theatres in 1660 signaled a renaissance of English drama. English [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]] written and performed in the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period from 1660 to 1710 are collectively called "Restoration comedy". Restoration comedy is notorious for its [[human sexual behavior|sexual]] explicitness. At this point, women were allowed for the first time to appear on the English stage, exclusively in female roles. This period saw the introduction of the first professional actresses and the rise of the first celebrity actors.

===19th century===
[[File:Henry Irving Vanity Fair.jpg|thumb|Henry Irving in ''[[The Bells (play)|The Bells]]'', 1874.]]

In the 19th century, the negative reputation of actors was largely reversed, and acting became an honored, popular profession and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Wilmeth, Don B. |author2=Bigsby, C.W.E. | title=The Cambridge history of American theatre | year=1998 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge, UK | isbn=978-0-521-65179-0 | pages=449–450}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the actor as celebrity provided the transition, as audiences flocked to their favorite "stars". A new role emerged for the [[actor-manager]]s, who formed their own companies and controlled the actors, the productions, and the financing.&lt;ref&gt;James Eli Adams, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the Victorian era'' (2004) 1:2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; When successful, they built up a permanent clientele that flocked to their productions. They could enlarge their audience by going on tour across the country, performing a repertoire of well-known plays, such as those by Shakespeare. The newspapers, private clubs, pubs, and coffee shops rang with lively debates evaluating the relative merits of the stars and the productions. [[Henry Irving]] (1838-1905) was the most successful of the British actor-managers.&lt;ref&gt;George Rowell, ''Theatre in the Age of Irving'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; Irving was renowned for his Shakespearean roles, and for such innovations as turning out the house lights so that attention could focus more on the stage and less on the audience. His company toured across Britain, as well as Europe and the United States, demonstrating the power of star actors and celebrated roles to attract enthusiastic audiences. His knighthood in 1895 indicated full acceptance into the higher circles of British society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Richards|title=Sir Henry Irving: A Victorian Actor and His World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=22Xp03gBd-MC&amp;pg=PA109|year=2007|publisher=A&amp;C Black|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
[[File:The_Shubert_Theatre00.jpg|border|right|frameless]]
By the early 20th century, the economics of large-scale productions displaced the actor-manager model. It was too hard to find people who combined a genius at acting as well as management, so specialization divided the roles as [[Stage management|stage managers]] and later [[theatre director]]s emerged. Financially, much larger capital was required to operate out of a major city. The solution was corporate ownership of chains of theatres, such as by the [[Theatrical Syndicate]], [[Edward Laurillard]], and especially [[The Shubert Organization]]. By catering to tourists, theaters in large cities increasingly favored long runs of highly popular plays, especially musicals. Big name stars became even more essential.&lt;ref&gt;Foster Hirsch, ''The Boys from Syracuse: The Shuberts' Theatrical Empire'' (Cooper Square Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
{{Main|List of acting techniques}}
* [[Classical acting]] is an umbrella term for a philosophy of acting that integrates the expression of the body, voice, imagination, personalizing, improvisation, external stimuli, and script analysis. It is based on the theories and systems of select classical actors and directors including [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and [[Michel Saint-Denis]]. 
* In [[Stanislavski's system]], also known as Stanislavski's method, actors draw upon their own feelings and experiences to convey the "truth" of the character they portray. Actors puts themselves in the mindset of the character, finding things in common to give a more genuine portrayal of the character.
* [[Method acting]] is a range of techniques based on for training actors to achieve better characterizations of the characters they play, as formulated by [[Lee Strasberg]]. Strasberg's method is based upon the idea that to develop an emotional and cognitive understanding of their roles, actors should use their own experiences to identify personally with their characters. It is based on aspects of Stanislavski's system. Other acting techniques are also based on Stanislavski's ideas, such as those of [[Stella Adler]] and [[Sanford Meisner]], but these are not considered "method acting".&lt;ref&gt;Guerrasio, Jason. (2014-12-19) [https://tribecafilminstitute.org/blog/detail/what_it_means_to_be_method What It Means To Be ‘Method’]. Tribecafilminstitute.org. Retrieved on 2016-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Meisner technique]] requires the actor to focus totally on the other actor as though he or she is real and they only exist in that moment. This is a method that makes the actors in the scene seem more authentic to the audience. It is based on the principle that acting finds its expression in people's response to other people and circumstances. Is it based on Stanislavski's system.

==As opposite sex==
Formerly, in some societies, only men could become actors. In [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/2002_52_fri_04.shtml|title=BBC - Radio 4 - Woman's Hour -Women Actors in Ancient Rome|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Middle Ages|medieval world]], it was considered disgraceful for a woman to go on stage; this belief persisted until the 17th century in [[Venice]]. In the time of [[William Shakespeare]], women's roles were generally played by men or boys.&lt;ref name="Neziroski 2003"/&gt;

When an eighteen-year [[Puritan]] prohibition of [[Restoration drama|drama]] was lifted after the [[English Restoration]] of 1660, women began to appear on stage in England. [[Margaret Hughes]] is oft credited as the first professional actress on the English stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1534673,00.html |title=Smallweed |last=Smallweed |date=23 July 2005 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2009-03-14 |quote="Whereas women's parts in plays have hitherto been acted by men in the habits of women ... we do permit and give leave for the time to come that all women's parts be acted by women," Charles II ordained in 1662. According to Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, the first actress to exploit this new freedom was Margaret Hughes, as Desdemona in Othello on December 8, 1660. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422150043/http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0%2C%2C1534673%2C00.html |archivedate=22 April 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prohibition ended during the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in part because he enjoyed watching actresses on stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1885/10/18/103638994.pdf |title=Women as actresses |date=18 October 1885 |work=Notes and Queries |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=2009-03-14 |quote=There seems no doubt that actresses did not perform on the stage till the Restoration, in the earliest years of which Pepys says for the first time he saw an actress upon the stage.

"The Restoration Actress". In Owen, Susan J. ''A companion to restoration drama'', pg. 73, (1. publ. ed.). Oxford [u.a.]: Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-0631219231}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first occurrence of the term ''actress'' was in 1608 according to the [[OED]] and is ascribed to [[Thomas Middleton|Middleton]]. In the 19th century many viewed women in acting negatively, as actresses were often [[courtesans]] and associated with promiscuity. Despite these prejudices, the 19th century also saw the first female acting "stars", most notably [[Sarah Bernhardt]].&lt;ref&gt;‘Studies in hysteria’: actress and courtesan, Sarah Bernhardt and Mrs Patrick Campbell&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], ''[[onnagata]]'', men taking on female roles, were used in ''[[kabuki]]'' theatre when women were banned from performing on stage during the [[Edo period]]. This convention continues. By contrast, some forms of [[Culture of China|Chinese]] drama involve women playing all roles.

In modern times, women occasionally played the roles of boys or young men. For example, the stage role of [[Peter Pan]] is traditionally played by a woman, as are most [[principal boy]]s in British [[pantomime]]. [[Opera]] has several "[[breeches role]]s" traditionally sung by women, usually [[mezzo-soprano]]s. Examples are Hansel in ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'', [[The Marriage of Figaro#Characters|Cherubino]] in ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' and Octavian in ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]''.

Women playing male roles are uncommon in film, with notable exceptions. In 1982, [[Stina Ekblad]] played the mysterious Ismael Retzinsky in ''[[Fanny and Alexander]]'', and [[Linda Hunt]] received the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for playing Billy Kwan in ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]''. In 2007, [[Cate Blanchett]] was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for playing Jude Quinn, a fictionalized representation of [[Bob Dylan]] in the 1960s, in ''[[I'm Not There]]''.

In the 2000s, women playing men in live theatre is particularly common in presentations of older plays, such as Shakespearean works with large numbers of male characters in roles where gender is inconsequential.&lt;ref name="PDF"/&gt;

Having an actor dress as the opposite sex for comic effect is also a long-standing tradition in [[comic theatre]] and film. Most of Shakespeare's comedies include instances of overt [[cross-dressing]], such as [[Francis Flute]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. The movie ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' stars [[Jack Gilford]] dressing as a young bride. [[Tony Curtis]] and [[Jack Lemmon]] famously posed as women to escape gangsters in the [[Billy Wilder]] film ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''. Cross-dressing for comic effect was a frequently used device in most of the [[Carry On films]]. [[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Robin Williams]] have each appeared in a hit comedy film (''[[Tootsie]]'' and ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'', respectively) in which they played most scenes dressed as a woman.

Occasionally, the issue is further complicated, for example, by a woman playing a woman acting as a man—who then pretends to be a woman, such as [[Julie Andrews]] in ''[[Victor/Victoria]]'', or [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] in ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]''. In ''[[It's Pat: The Movie]]'', filmwatchers never learn the gender of the androgynous main characters [[Pat (Saturday Night Live)|Pat]] and Chris (played by [[Julia Sweeney]] and [[Dave Foley]]). Similarly, in the aforementioned example of The Marriage of Figaro, there is a scene in which Cherubino (a male character portrayed by a woman) dresses up and acts as a woman; the other characters in the scene are aware of a single level of gender role obfuscation, while the audience is aware of two levels.

A few modern roles are played by a member of the opposite sex in order to emphasize the gender fluidity of the role. Edna Turnblad in ''Hairspray'' was played by [[Divine (actor)|Divine]] in the [[Hairspray (1988 film)|1988 original film]], [[Harvey Fierstein]] in the [[Hairspray (musical)|Broadway musical]], and [[John Travolta]] in the [[Hairspray (2007 film)|2007 movie musical]]. [[Felicity Huffman]] was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for playing Bree Osbourne (a [[male-to-female transsexual]]) in 2005's ''[[Transamerica (film)|Transamerica]]''.

==Types==
Actors working in theatre, film, television and radio have to learn specific skills. Techniques that work well in one type of acting may not work well in another type of acting.

===In theatre===
To act on stage, actors need to learn the stage directions that appear in the script, such as "Stage Left" and "Stage Right". These directions are based on the actor's point of view as he or she stands on the stage facing the audience. Actors also have to learn the meaning of the stage directions "Upstage" (away from the audience) and "Downstage" (towards the audience)&lt;ref name="sft.edu"&gt;{{cite web |title= Industry Tips |url=http://www.sft.edu/tips/stage-acting.html |accessdate=April 4, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326100456/http://www.sft.edu/tips/stage-acting.html |archivedate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theatre actors need to learn blocking, which is "...where and how an actor moves on the stage during a play". Most scripts specify some blocking. The Director also gives instructions on blocking, such as crossing the stage or picking up and using a prop.&lt;ref name="sft.edu"/&gt;

Some theater actors need to learn [[stage combat]], which is simulated fighting on stage. Actors may have to simulate hand-to-hand [fighting] or sword[-fighting]. Actors are coached by [[fight director]]s, who help them learn the [[choreography|choreographed sequence]] of fight actions.
&lt;ref name="sft.edu"/&gt;

===In film===
====Silent films====
From 1894 to the late 1920s, movies were [[silent film]]s. Silent film actors emphasized [[body language]] and [[facial expression]], so that the audience could better understand what an actor was feeling and portraying on screen. Much silent film acting is apt to strike modern-day audiences as simplistic or [[camp (style)|campy]]. The melodramatic acting style was in some cases a habit actors transferred from their former stage experience. [[Vaudeville]] theatre was an especially popular origin for many American silent film actors.&lt;ref name=textbook&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=John|title=American Film: A History|date=2008|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-393-97922-0|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pervading presence of [[stage actor]]s in film was the cause of this outburst from director [[Marshall Neilan]] in 1917: "The sooner the stage people who have come into pictures get out, the better for the pictures." In other cases, directors such as John Griffith Wray required their actors to deliver larger-than-life expressions for emphasis. As early as 1914, American viewers had begun to make known their preference for greater naturalness on screen.{{sfn|brownlow|1968|pages=344-353}}

Pioneering film directors in Europe and the United States recognized the different limitations and freedoms of the mediums of stage and screen by the early 1910s. Silent films became less vaudevillian in the mid 1910s, as the differences between stage and screen became apparent. Due to the work of directors such as [[D W Griffith]], cinematography became less stage-like, and the then-revolutionary [[close up]] shot allowed subtle and naturalistic acting. In America, D.W. Griffith's company [[Biograph Studios]], became known for its innovative direction and acting, conducted suit the cinema rather than the stage. Griffith realized that theatrical acting did not look good on film and required his actors and actresses to go through weeks of film acting training.&lt;ref name="infoplease.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/cig/movies-flicks-film/film-acting-vs-theater-acting.html|title=Movies and Film|publisher=infoplease.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lillian Gish]] has been called film's "first true actress" for her work in the period, as she pioneered new film performing techniques, recognizing the crucial differences between [[Stage acting|stage]] and [[screen acting]]. Directors such as [[Albert Capellani]] and [[Maurice Tourneur]] began to insist on naturalism in their films. By the mid-1920s many American silent films had adopted a more naturalistic acting style, though not all actors and directors accepted naturalistic, low-key acting straight away; as late as 1927, films featuring expressionistic acting styles, such as ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', were still being released. {{sfn|Brownlow|1968|pages=344–353}}

According to Anton Kaes, a silent film scholar from the University of Wisconsin, American silent cinema began to see a shift in acting techniques between 1913 and 1921, influenced by techniques found in German silent film. This is mainly attributed to the influx of emigrants from the [[Weimar Republic]], "including film directors, producers, cameramen, lighting and stage technicians, as well as actors and actresses".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Silent Cinema|last = Kaes|first = Anton|date = 1990|journal = Monatshefte|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advent of sound in film====
Film actors have to learn to get used to and be comfortable with a camera being in front of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ace-your-audition.com/auditions-for-film.html|title=Auditions for Film: Movie Acting Tips and Techniques|website=Ace-your-audition.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Film actors need to learn to find and stay on their "mark." This is a position on the floor marked with tape. This position is where the lights and camera focus are optimized. Film actors also need to learn how to prepare well and perform well on [[screen test]]s. Screen tests are a filmed audition of part of the script.

Unlike theater actors, who develop characters for repeat performances, film actors lack continuity, forcing them to come to all scenes (sometimes shot in reverse of the order in which they ultimately appear) with a fully developed character already.&lt;ref name="infoplease.com"/&gt;

"Since film captures even the smallest gesture and magnifies it..., cinema demands a less flamboyant and stylized bodily performance from the actor than does the theater." "The performance of emotion is the most difficult aspect of film acting to master: ...the film actor must rely on subtle facial ticks, quivers, and tiny lifts of the eyebrow to create a believable character."&lt;ref name="infoplease.com"/&gt; Some theatre stars "...have made the theater-to-cinema transition quite successfully ([[Laurence Olivier]], [[Glenn Close]], and [[Julie Andrews]], for instance), others have not..."&lt;ref name="infoplease.com"/&gt;

===In television===
"On a television set, there are typically several cameras angled at the set. Actors who are new to on-screen acting can get confused about which camera to look into."&lt;ref name="sft.edu" /&gt; TV actors need to learn to use lav mics ([[Lavaliere microphone]]s).&lt;ref name="sft.edu" /&gt; TV actors need to understand the concept of "frame". "The term frame refers to the area that the camera's lens is capturing."&lt;ref name="sft.edu" /&gt;
Within the acting industry, there are four types of television roles one could land on a show. Each type varies in prominence, frequency of appearance, and pay. The first is known as a ''series regular''—the main actors on the show as part of the permanent cast. Actors in ''recurring'' roles are under contract to appear in multiple episodes of a series. A ''co-star'' role is a small speaking role that usually only appears in one episode. A ''guest star'' is a larger role than a ''co-star'' role, and the character is often the central focus of the episode or integral to the plot.

===In radio===
[[File:Opname van een hoorspel Recording a radio play.jpg|thumb|Recording a radio play in the Netherlands (1949; [[Spaarnestad Photo]]).]]
Radio drama is a dramatized, purely acoustic [[performance]], broadcast on [[radio]] or published on audio media, such as tape or CD. With no visual component, radio [[drama]] depends on dialogue, music and sound effects to help the listener imagine the characters and story: "It is auditory in the physical dimension but equally powerful as a visual force in the psychological dimension."&lt;ref&gt;Tim Crook: [http://www.coffeetheater.com/usr/down/2_93.pdf ''Radio drama. Theory and practice''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701103558/http://www.coffeetheater.com/usr/down/2_93.pdf |date=July 1, 2014 }}. London; New York: Routledge, 1999, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio drama achieved widespread popularity within a decade of its initial development in the 1920s. By the 1940s, it was a leading international popular entertainment. With the advent of television in the 1950s, however, radio drama lost some of its popularity, and in some countries has never regained large audiences. However, recordings of OTR ([[old-time radio]]) survive today in the audio archives of collectors and museums, as well as several online sites such as [[Internet Archive]].

{{as of|2011}}, radio drama has a minimal presence on terrestrial radio in the United States. Much of American radio drama is restricted to rebroadcasts or [[podcast]]s of programs from previous decades. However, other nations still have thriving traditions of radio drama. In the United Kingdom, for example, the [[BBC]] produces and broadcasts hundreds of new radio plays each year on [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]], [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]], and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|Radio 4 Extra]]. Podcasting has also offered the means of creating new radio dramas, in addition to the distribution of vintage programs.

The terms "audio drama"&lt;ref&gt;Compare the entry to ''Hörspiel'' e.g. in: [http://www.dict.cc/deutsch-englisch/H%C3%B6rspiel.html dict.cc – Deutsch-Englisch-Wörterbuch]&lt;/ref&gt; or "audio theatre" are sometimes used synonymously with "radio drama" with one possible distinction: audio drama or audio theatre may not necessarily be intended specifically for broadcast on radio. Audio drama, whether newly produced or OTR classics, can be found on [[CD]]s, [[cassette tape]]s, [[podcast]]s, [[webcast]]s and conventional broadcast radio.

Thanks to advances in digital recording and Internet distribution, radio drama is experiencing a revival.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news | author = Newman, Barry |date = 2010-02-25 | title = Return With Us to the Thrilling Days Of Yesteryear — Via the Internet  | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704240004575085313479028540 | publisher = Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5107">'''Alan Hughes''' is an [[Irish people|Irish]] television star in his mid 50s. He works for [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] and appears on ''[[Ireland AM]]''. He is the host of ''[[Family Fortunes (TV3)|Family Fortunes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tv3.ie/shows.php?request=familyfortunes&amp;tv3_preview=6umM5XcMzS6u |title=Family Fortunes |work=TV3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123190148/http://www.tv3.ie/shows.php?request=familyfortunes&amp;tv3_preview=6umM5XcMzS6u |archivedate=2011-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first break was in a television advertisement for [[ESB Electric Ireland]] in the 1970s.

In the 1990s, RTÉ gave him his big break hosting prime time quiz show ''Talk About'' for 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/2012/0221/alanhughesfamilyfortunes.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120908113725/http://www.rte.ie/ten/2012/0221/alanhughesfamilyfortunes.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 8 September 2012 |title=Alan Hughes talks Family Fortunes |date=21 February 2012 |accessdate=21 February 2012 |work=RTÉ Ten |publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann |quote=Looking at Alan's slick new image for the show, is it likely that his signature deckchair jackets from his RTÉ Talkabout days will resurface?

Alan is also known as Sammy Sausages, a hugely popular character in The Cheerios Panto which has been an annual smash hit since 1988.

'''Angelfood McSpade''' is a comic book character created and drawn by the 1960s [[counterculture|counter culture]] figure and [[underground comix]] artist [[Robert Crumb]]. The character first appeared in the Philadelphia-based underground newspaper ''[[Yarrowstalks]]'' #2 in July 1967, making her comics debut in the second issue of ''[[Zap Comix]]'' (June 1968).

==Characterization==
Angelfood McSpade is a [[satirical]] portrayal of a [[stereotypical]] black [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] woman.&lt;ref name='dh2006'&gt;Dowd; Hignite 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='ch1995'&gt;Crumb; Holm 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; She is depicted as a large, bare-breasted tribeswoman, dressed in nothing but a [[skirt]] made out of [[palm tree]] leaves.&lt;ref name='cro1995'&gt;Crowley 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; She is drawn with big lips, golden rings around her neck and in her ears, huge [[breasts]], large round [[buttocks]] and speaks [[jive (dialect)|jive]]. Her name references [[angelfood cake]] and the racial slur "spade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/96/S0599600.html |publisher=American Heritage Dictionary |title=Spade |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212145544/http://www.bartleby.com/61/96/S0599600.html |archive-date=12 December 2007 |access-date=1 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the second issue of ''[[Zap Comix]]'', she has been confined to "the wilds of darkest [[Africa]]", because "[[civilization]] would be threatened if she were allowed to do whatever she pleased!"&lt;ref name=Zap2&gt;Crumb, R. "Angelfood McSpade: She's Sock-a-Delic — She's All Heart," ''Zap Comix'' #2 (July 1968).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not clear whether she was born in Africa or born in the U.S.A. and then sent to Africa. Her type of clothing suggests she is African, but her [[jive (dialect)|jive]] talk suggests she's from the U.S.A.&lt;ref name='est1993'&gt;Estren 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Angelfood is depicted as a [[Hypersexuality|nymphomaniac]] and open to [[sexual intercourse]].&lt;ref name='har1996'&gt;Harvey 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In many of her stories she is accompanied by [[Snoid]], another of Crumb's characters who is portrayed as "a short-statured asshole" known for "his fetishes, sex cravings, and disdain for materialism."&lt;ref&gt;Fox, M. Steven. [http://comixjoint.com/snoidcomics-1st.html "Snoid Comics,"] ComixJoint. Accessed 16 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Policemen prevent other sexually aroused men from meeting Angelfood.&lt;ref name=Zap2 /&gt; In a later story three men bring her to the United States and promise to "civilize" her. There she is told to lick toilets clean in order to gain success. While she does this, the men push her head inside the toilet and violate her.&lt;ref name='dh2006'/&gt;&lt;ref name='jn2003'&gt;Jahraus; Neuhaus 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crumb, R. Untitled ("There she is, fellows! Ah! She'll be so grateful to us!"), ''East Village Other'' (18 October 1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

She is very naïve and easily [[physical abuse|abused]] or even [[rape]]d by the horny men who surround her, though, being a nymphomaniac, she is not bothered by this. Often, she is vulnerable to assault while being asleep or unconscious. Angelfood has a tendency to walk barebreasted, even in cities. However, no one seems to stop her from walking around half-naked. In another story she saves two boys, Chuck and Bob, from being eaten by members of her own [[tribe]].&lt;ref name='dh2006'/&gt;&lt;ref name='hel2004'&gt;Heller 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; They flee from the tribe to the U.S., where she spends a night with the boys and afterwards goes to the hairdresser. When she returns, she has bleached her skin, changed her hair and clothing and learned fluent English, much to the disappointment of the two boys.&lt;ref&gt;Crumb, R. "Ups and Downs," ''Yellow Dog'' vol. 2, #2 [issue #13/14] (Print Mint, July 1969).&lt;/ref&gt; In another story she asked [[Hugh Hefner]] if she could become a [[Playboy Bunny]], but when Hefner saw her in the outfit he couldn't resist laughing. This made her so angry that she attacked him. In the last panel she and [[Mr. Natural (comics)|Mr. Natural]] (who accompanied her) are kicked out of Hefner's office.&lt;ref&gt; "Angelfood McSpade," ''[[Playboy]]'' vol. 17, #7 (July 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

The character was featured regularly during Crumb's late 1960s and early 1970s output.&lt;ref name='ch1995'/&gt; In later comics her appearances became less frequent, and finally after 1971 Crumb stopped using the character in his comics altogether.

==Controversy==
Angelfood McSpade is one of Crumb's most notorious targets for accusations of [[sexism]] and [[racism]].&lt;ref name='sor2005'&gt;Sorensen 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Crumb has responded that he did not invent racist caricatures like Angelfood, but that they used to be part of the American culture in which he was raised.&lt;ref name='ch1995'/&gt;&lt;ref name='hux2001'&gt;Huxley 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the character as a criticism of the racist stereotype itself and assumed that the young [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[hippie]]/intellectual audience who read his work were not racists and would understand his intentions for the character.&lt;ref name='ch1995'/&gt;&lt;ref name='lo2009'&gt;Lopes 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
{{Tone|section|date=September 2018}}
Plastro, the nefarious General of the Tan Army, has enlisted the help of the villainous Baron Von Beige to help him set a trap for Captain Blade!

Join forces with Capt. William Blade, leader of the Alpha Wolf Squadron once again the game 'takes to the skies' with an onslaught of new missions, improved helicopters, and more pyrotechnic weaponry than ever before. Join the Air Cavalry as they face a host of challenging foes in their efforts to stop the General's evil plans.

Battle Plastro's air force, which is led by ace pilot Baron von Beige. As players battle through 22 missions, they'll encounter such environments as a Japanese garden, Halloween night, the wild west, a flowerbed, and a backyard. Choppers include King Cobra, Chinook, Osprey, and Apache types, each of which has its unique weapons. Plastic-collection system unlocks secret toy abilities and hidden chopper weaponry. Real-time cutscenes, in-game voice-overs, and cinematic sequences keep players in the action. Go head-to-head, or try cooperative missions in Army Men: Air Attack 2's multiplayer modes. This game had many more cut scenes than the last.

==Characters Include==
This game had new co-pilots, and some old ones with a new look. In this game each co-pilot has a special secondary weapon and can only be used with that co-pilot as opposed to the first one where any secondary weapon was available. It should be noted that all the co pilots change in this game i.e. 'Woodstock' is no longer a 1960s Vietnam- drafted type soldier, he is a Jamaican guy, 'Hardcore' now becomes more like Hard-core who is now a punk British man. 'Rawhide' disappears altogether. Also all choppers have a special weapon. The game also introduces a new antagonist Baron von Beige a.k.a. the "Tan Baron" who also acts a rival to Blade. He is based on the "Red Baron" and flies a plane similar to his and also uses Zeppelins like the Germans did.

* Sarge Hawk: He is seemingly given command of large factions of the Green Army and idolized as a super trooper commanding entire battle fronts with his elite squad of soldiers and combat engineers from Bravo Company. Sgt. Hawk is an E-5 Sergeant. He is the main protagonist in the storyline.
* General Plastro: The main antagonist in the Army Men series, General Plastro is the general of the Tan Republic, as well as Dictator of the Tan Nation. Throughout the series, Plastro evolved from a nameless menace who was only mentioned once, to a comical villain who tries what seem to be more and more desperate plans to defeat the Greens and other nations.
* Colonel Grimm: "Happy Jack" is the commanding officer of Bravo Company, thusly Sergeant Hawk's direct commanding officer. Col. He makes minor appearances in the Sarge's Heroes series. Depicted as a sympathetic officer who has probably seen combat in some forgotten war.
* Baron von Beige: "Tan Baron" flies a [[Fokker Dr.I]], like The Red Baron. He wears a cape, a mask that covers his entire face except his eyes, and oxygen mask, even when on the ground. He is the main antagonist.  His voice sounds as though it is a machine which may hint at a possible wound. He is based on the real-life German fighter pilot [[Manfred von Richthofen]].
* Captain William Blade: A Green helicopter pilot and the leader of the Alpha Wolf Battalion. He was the main character in the games Army Men: Air Tactics, Captain Blade sports a cowboy hat bearing the mark of the Union Cavalry. A member of the Airborne Cavalry, Blade is the main protagonist of all the helicopter games. Main duties involving either transporting or providing aerial fire support.
* Lieutenant Tyrone Livingston: "Woodstock", is a Jamaican styled pilot his special ability is the ability to call in Paratroopers who drop from the sky and suicide bomb any Tan vehicles, troops, or structures. He is indeed of Jamaican descent. Woodstock's name is Tyrone Livingston. It is unknown, but more likely, that the original Woodstock was replaced with the Air Attack 2 version at some point before the events of Air Attack.
* Lieutenant Jason Larkin: "Hardcore 2" is a Green Nation helicopter pilot who has a southern accent. An ex-biker who can be a wrestler, but prefers to do hardware combat. He has a resemblance to Rawhide, but has no relation. He only appears in Air Attack 2. His special ability is the swarm rockets.
* Lt. Felicity Wannamaker, "Bombshell", is the main love interest of Captain William Blade. She is first introduced in Army Men: Air Combat: Her special skill is napalm. Also during the events of Air Attack 2/Air Combat - The Elite Missions after destroying the last Tan Factory, she is captured by the Tan Baron Baron von Beige and then rescued by Sgt. Hawk.
* Vikki Grimm: She is the daughter of Colonel Grimm, and the main love interest of Sgt. Hawk. She is also a reporter for Green Army News. She is a common character to the series of Army Men games. Covering most of the war time stories. She is partially fleshed toned with clothing.
* Lt. John Lawless, “Hooligan” is an English punk rocker styled Green Nation pilot whose special ability is the air strike attack.  He was also the original “Hardcore” in the first Army Men:  Air Attack game.

'''Artificial seawater''' ([[abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''ASW''') is a mixture of dissolved [[salt (chemistry)|mineral salts]] (and sometimes [[vitamin]]s) that simulates [[seawater]]. Artificial seawater is primarily used in [[marine biology]] and in [[marine aquarium|marine]] and [[reef aquarium|reef aquaria]], and allows the easy preparation of [[growth medium|media]] appropriate for marine [[organism]]s (including [[algae]], [[bacteria]], [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s). From a [[scientific method|scientific perspective]], artificial seawater has the advantage of [[reproducibility]] over natural seawater since it is a standardized formula. Synthetic seawater is also known as artificial seawater and substitute ocean water. 

==Example==
The tables below present an example of an artificial seawater (35.00[[Per mille|‰]] of salinity) preparation devised by Kester, Duedall, Connors and Pytkowicz (1967).&lt;ref&gt;Kester, D. R., Duedall, I. W., Connors, D. N. and Pytkowicz, R. M. (1967).

''Limnology &amp; Oceanography'' '''12''', 176—179.&lt;/ref&gt;  The recipe consists of two lists of mineral salts, the first of [[anhydrous]] salts that can be weighed out, the second of [[hydrate|hydrous]] salts that should be added to the artificial seawater as a solution.

==Uses==
There are various applications for ASTM D1141-98 synthetic seawater including [[corrosion]] studies, ocean [[Calibration#Instrument calibration|instrument calibration]] and chemical processing.

'''Bayko''' was an English [[building model]] construction [[toy]] invented by [[Charles Plimpton]], an early plastics engineer and entrepreneur in Liverpool. First marketed in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] it was soon exported throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] and became a world wide brand between 1934 and 1967. The name derived from [[Bakelite]], one of the world's first commercial [[plastic]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.acs.org/portal/acs/corg/content?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=PP_ARTICLEMAIN&amp;node_id=924&amp;content_id=WPCP_007586&amp;use_sec=true&amp;sec_url_var=region1&amp;__uuid=d51cb5fc-66c0-4fb1-82c6-6c8660810203%7c#P22_3092 |title=The Development of Bakelite |work=American Chemical Society |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bayko.org.uk/index.html?http://www.baykoman.com/Plastic/BAKELITE.htm&amp;mainFrame |title=Bakelite |first=Pete |last=Bradley |work=Bayko by BaykoMan |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was originally used to manufacture many of the parts. Bayko was one of the world's earliest plastic toys to be marketed.&lt;ref name=melright&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.melright.com/bayko/ |title=The Bayko system |work=Bayko Building Site |first=Melvyn |last=Wright |accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bayko system==
[[File:BuildingWithBayko.jpeg|thumb|300px|right|Basic construction elements: base, rods and bricks, from a Plimpton era Bayko set.]]
Bayko was primarily intended for the construction of model buildings.  The rectangular [[Bakelite]] bases had a square grid of holes, spaced at 3/8 inch  centres, into which thin metal rods, 75 thou [1.905 mm] in diameter, of various lengths, could be placed vertically.  In order to make larger models, two or more bases could be joined together by means of metal links secured by screws through holes in the bases. Bakelite bricks, windows and other parts could then be slotted between pairs of rods in order to create the walls of the building.  Other commonly used parts included floors (thin sheets of resin bonded paper with the same square pattern grid of holes as bases), and roofs of various types.  There were also a large number of other more specialised parts.&lt;ref name="BM-basics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baykoman.com/BAYKO%20Basics/BAYKO%20Basics.htm|title=BAYKO Basics|last=Bradley|first=Pete|work=Bayko by BaykoMan|accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the original sets bases were large, and coloured brown; walls were brown/maroon and cream; roofs were deep maroon; and windows were a very dark green, but by 1937 the 'true' colours of red or white walls, green windows and red roofs were established, though bases were still large and brown.

A period of radical change was heralded in 1938 with the introduction of the [now] much sought after 20s series, through which a number of new parts were introduced.  Then, in 1939, the 'New Series' retooling programme added to the range of new parts and changed the bases to the more familiar, smaller version, initially in a mottled green.  Post war the standard colours were red and white walls, red roofs, green widows and green bases, and, despite some experiments with 'rogue' colours in the years immediately after the war, these remained in play until 1959 when Meccano took over, changing the colours to orange red and cream bricks with yellow windows and grey bases.

Plimpton began the move to polystyrene parts, gradually, from the mid 1950s onwards, a change which Meccano subsequently took up with enthusiasm, it being so much cheaper to produce.  Ironically perhaps, in the last days of Bayko, they began to reverse this change, of both materials and colour scheme, with the introduction of the so-called 'Flanged' or 'Minimalist' parts.

[[File:BaykoModelHouse.jpeg|thumb|300px|right|Example model house, built with a Plimpton era Bayko set.]]
[[File:Bayko Empire State Building.JPG|thumb|Bayko model of the [[Empire State Building]] in the [[Museum of Liverpool]], built by Leo Janssen, 1999–2003.]]
The main advantage of Bayko over its rivals is generally regarded as the high standard of realism of the models constructed with it.  The main disadvantage often quoted is the fragility of Bakelite which frequently led to bases and window parts breaking.  Some safety concerns can also be recognised {{by whom|date=September 2009}} regarding the dangers of using thin metal rods in a toy for children; however, had the product survived into the health and safety years, an alternative plastic version, probably 'crimped' every 3/8 inch to make a 'mechanical fuse', would have allayed these fears.

==History==

===Plimpton era===
:''See [[Charles Plimpton]] for early Bayko history.''
The Bayko system was invented and [[patent]]ed by [[Charles Plimpton]] in 1933, following a long period of convalescence in Ruthin in North Wales.  Plimpton set up [[Charles Plimpton|Plimpton Engineering]] in [[Liverpool]], [[England]], to manufacture the components, the majority of which were made from [[Bakelite]], a new synthetic [[plastic]] developed in the early 1900s.  The sets were called "Bayko Light Construction Sets" (the term "Bayko Light" coming from the name "Bakelite") and went on sale nationally towards the end of 1934. There had been, however, limited production, with sets literally packed on the kitchen table, 12 months earlier, presumably for a restricted, local market.  The Bakelite material was sourced from Bakelite Limited, a [[Birmingham]] supplier, and for the first few years of its life, Bayko was marketed by both Plimpton Engineering and Bakelite Limited.

Initially five sets were produced, "Set 1" (the smallest, entry level) through to "Set 5" (the largest). The bricks were brown and cream, the bases brown, the windows dark green, and the roofs dark maroon. Plimpton began advertising Bayko in [[Meccano Ltd]]'s ''[[Meccano Magazine]]'' in September 1935, unaware that 25 years later, Meccano itself would own and manufacture Bayko.  Regular advertisements appeared in the magazine over those next 25 years.

In 1935 three Ornamental Sets A, B and C were introduced that contained decorative parts to supplement the existing sets, including pillars, arches and mottled green roofs.  In 1936 a "Set 6" was introduced, a much larger set than "Set 5" that included all the new ornamental parts. All the bricks in this set, initially, were 'Oak', a mottled brown colour made by the addition of sawdust to the resin, and sets like this were, and indeed remain, much cherished.  In 1937 the familiar, long-lived colour scheme of red and white bricks with green windows was implemented for the standard sets.  In late 1937, or early 1938, "Set 6" was also changed to the new standard colours and a conversion set, "set 5A", was introduced.  However, until wartime austerity interrupted, any set could still be ordered in 'Oak'.

By 1938, the Bayko sets were described as "Bayko Building Sets", as a period of change began.  The 20s series, updated Ornamental sets, were introduced, in which curved bricks and windows and orange turrets were perhaps the most noteworthy introductions.  In 1939 all the existing sets were relaunched and replaced by a 'New Series' of six sets that incorporated new parts, still in the red, white and green colour scheme.

Production was interrupted in 1942 by [[World War II]] when the company switched to manufacturing for the [[war effort]]. When production resumed in 1946, the set range was reduced to three, "Set 0" to "Set 2", set "0" being a new, much smaller, entry level set, appropriate to these austere times. A "Set 3" was introduced in 1947.

Charles Plimpton died of [[tuberculosis]] in December 1948 and his wife, Audrey Plimpton took over the running of Plimpton Engineering.

Further new parts were added to the sets in 1949 and 1950, probably from Charles Plimpton's innovation stream, were introduced to increase the realism and flexibility of the system.  Although the initial plans had been for a further two sets, the range was completed in 1952 when "set 4" was introduced, which included all the parts except turrets.

By the late 1950s, suffering from a chronic lack of investment in new parts, Bayko came under great pressure from other construction toys that appeared on the market, and Audrey Plimpton retired in 1959.  She sold the company to [[Meccano Ltd]] in 1959, though Brittains had also been in the frame.&lt;ref name=melright/&gt;&lt;ref name="BM-Plimpton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baykoman.com/Company/BAYKO%20Plimpton%20Era%20Summary.htm|title=Plimpton Era Summary|last=Bradley|first=Pete|work=Bayko by BaykoMan |accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meccano era===
Having acquired the rights to manufacture Bayko in 1959, [[Meccano Ltd]] moved production to its [[Meccano]] factory in [[Speke]], Liverpool.  To rationalise and simplify the system, all the Bayko sets were redesigned. Most of the decorative parts were dropped and the cumbersome one-piece roofs were replaced by flat-roof pieces.  The colour scheme was changed to grey bases, light green roofs, yellow windows and doors, and orange-red and beige bricks.  In order to reduce production costs, [[polystyrene]] was used for all the plastic parts instead of Bakelite.

After an unfortunately long gestation period, four Meccano Bayko sets went on sale from the end of 1960 into 1961, numbered 11 to 14 to avoid being confused with the Plimpton sets.  The Bayko adverts continued in ''[[Meccano Magazine]]'', and — due to the success of the cost-cutting measures — the new sets were sold at a significantly lower price than the Plimpton sets.  In 1962 Meccano introduced its own decorative pieces, including opening French windows, large shop windows and pantile roofs, together with a new "Set 15" which included them all.

By 1963 Meccano Ltd also began feeling the pressure of competing toys, even though the models Bayko produced were more realistic architectural constructions, and advertising was increasingly scarce, even in Meccano Magazine, their own publication. By 1964, now under the Tri-ang ownership, all advertising for Bayko was stopped, although Meccano continued manufacturing Bayko sets and spares until 1967.

Strangely, as Bayko was being 'milked' as it struggled, unsupported in the market place, another re-tooling programme was begun.  This comprised the introduction of the 'Flanged' or 'Minimalist' bricks and related parts, reverting to red and white bricks, but this programme of change was stopped halfway through.  Eventually the 'milking' led to a deterioration of standards as mixed colour sets were churned out.

Over its lifespan, both Plimpton and Meccano Bayko was exported across the world, and, besides being a toy, it attracted a modest adult following that still exists today. A healthy trade in original Bayko sets and parts also exists today, with some enthusiasts even casting their own Bayko pieces.&lt;ref name=melright/&gt;&lt;ref name="BM-Meccano"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baykoman.com/Company/MECCANO%20Era%20Summary.htm|title=Meccano Era Summary|last=Bradley|first=Pete|work=Bayko by BaykoMan |accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Blues in the Night''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] [[revue]] conceived by [[Sheldon Epps]]. It was produced by Mitchell Maxwell, Alan J. Schuster, Fred H. Krones and M Squared Entertainment, Inc., and Joshua Silver (Associate Producer).

Set in a rundown [[Chicago]] hotel in 1938, the dialogue-free show focuses on three women's relationships with the same [[Womanizing|snake]] of a man, their interweaving stories told through the [[torch song]]s and [[blues]] of [[Duke Ellington]], [[Bessie Smith]], [[Johnny Mercer]], [[Harold Arlen]], [[Vernon Duke]], [[Gordon Jenkins]], and [[Alberta Hunter]], among others.

==Productions==
The revue originally was staged by Epps and [[Gregory Hines]] under the supervision of [[Norman René]] at the [[off-Broadway]] Playhouse 46, where it ran for 51 performances between March 26 and May 11, 1980. The original cast consisted of David Brunetti, Rise Collins, Suzanne M. Henry, and [[Gwen Shepherd]].&lt;ref&gt;Otis L. Guernsey, ''The Best Plays of 1979-1980''

After thirteen previews, the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, directed by Epps, opened on June 2, 1982 at the Rialto Theatre, where it ran for 53 performances. Jean Du Shon, [[Debbie Shapiro]], [[Leslie Uggams]], and Charles Coleman comprised the cast. The show was nominated for the [[Tony Award]] for Best Musical.

The [[West End theatre|West End]] production, staged by Steve Whately, opened on June 9, 1987 at the [[Donmar Warehouse]], where it ran through July 19, 1987. [[Maria Friedman]], [[Debby Bishop]], [[Carol Woods]], and [[Clarke Peters]] comprised the cast. With Peter Straker replacing Peters, it transferred to the [[Piccadilly Theatre]], opening on September 23 and running through July 28, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutmaria.com/bluesinthenight.html |title=Sheldon Epps' musical Blues in the Night at the Donmar Warehouse - About Maria Friedman |publisher=Aboutmaria.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisistheatre.com/shows/donmar211.html |title=Blues in The Night London theatre stage show |publisher=Thisistheatre.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219184134/http://www.thisistheatre.com/shows/donmar211.html |archivedate=2012-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cast featured [[Carol Woods]], Brenda Pressley, [[Kathleen Rowe McAllen]] and Lawrence Hamilton. In the early 1990s, Clarke Peters directed a touring production, starting at the Churchill Theatre in Bromley, South London, England. It featured [[Ricco Ross]] and [[Claire Martin (singer)|Claire Martin]].

The revue was presented at the Post Street Theatre, [[San Francisco]], for eight weeks in July through September 2007. [[Maurice Hines]] played the role of "The Man in the Saloon", with Carol Woods, [[Freda Payne]] and Paulette Ivory as the three women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://article/Review_Keeping_Cool_with_Blues_in_the_Night_20070820] {{dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
[[Frank Rich]] in his ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' review of the 1982 revival, wrote: "The sad truth is that not even the plainest theatrical formulas are as easy as they look - and ''Blues in the Night,'' the new revue at the Rialto, is the not-so-living proof. The 25 blues numbers in this show...are often first-rate. The stars - Leslie Uggams, Jean Du Shon and Debbie Shapiro - are talented. The format - no dialogue, a minimum of dancing - is a model of economy. Yet ''Blues in the Night'' proves a bland evening that mainly serves to remind us just how much imagination went into its seemingly similar, far more fiery predecessors.  Sheldon Epps, who "conceived" the revue and directed it, may well be responsible for what's gone wrong, but his basic notion isn't bad: ''Blues'' is set in a cheap hotel in 1938 Chicago (modestly designed by John Falabella) where the three stars occupy separate, shabby rooms. Yet the women remain anonymous throughout - they are called simply Woman No. 1 and so on in the Playbill - and, even when they sing together, they don't interact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rich, Frank|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/03/theater/revue-3-women-sing-the-blues-in-the-night.html|title= "Revue: 3 Women Sing The 'Blues In The Night'"|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 3, 1982|accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bread and puppet puppets glover vermont.jpg|thumb|240px|Puppets found in the Bread &amp; Puppet Museum in Glover, Vermont]]

The '''Bread and Puppet Theater''' (often known simply as '''Bread &amp; Puppet''') is a [[Political radicalism|politically radical]] [[puppet theater]], active since the 1960s, currently based in [[Glover, Vermont]].  Its founder and director is [[Peter Schumann]].

The name '''Bread &amp; Puppet''' is derived from the theater's practice of sharing its own fresh bread, served for free with [[aïoli]], with the audience of each performance to create community, and from its central principle art should be as basic as bread to life.  Some have heard echoes of the Roman phrase "[[bread and circuses]]" or the labor slogan "[[Bread and Roses]]" in the theater's name as well, though these are not often mentioned in Bread &amp; Puppet's own explanations of its name.

The Bread and Puppet Theater participates in parades including [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebrations, notably in [[Cabot, Vermont]], with many effigies including a satirical [[Uncle Sam]] on stilts.

==History==
[[Peter Schumann]] began The Bread &amp; Puppet Theater in 1962–1963 in [[New York City]]. It was active during the [[Vietnam War]] in [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war]] protests, primarily in New York City, prompting ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reviewer T.E. Kalem to remark in 1971, "This virtual dumb show is as contemporary as tomorrow's bombing raid."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Gary Botting]], ''The Theatre of Protest in America'' (Edmonton: Harden House, 1972), 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; Many people remember it as central to the political spectacle of the time, as its enormous puppets (often ten to fifteen feet tall) were a fixture of many demonstrations. A Sicilian puppet show had inspired Schumann, and TB&amp;PT inspired other groups across the continent, including [[Gary Botting]]'s Edmonton-based People &amp; Puppets Incorporated, which in the early 1970s also used effigies yards-high to depict political themes and social commentary in radical street theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Tihemme Gagnon, "Introduction", ''Streaking! The Collected Poems of [[Gary Botting]]'' (Miami: Strategic, 2014) xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 the Theater moved to [[Vermont]], first to [[Goddard College]] in [[Plainfield, Vermont|Plainfield]], and then to a [[farm]] in Glover where it remains. The farm is home to a cow, several pigs, chickens, and puppeteers, as well as indoor and outdoor performance spaces, a printshop, store, and large museum showcasing over four decades of the company's work. TB&amp;PT has received [[National Endowment for the Arts]] grants, awards from the [[Puppeteers of America]], and other organizations.

In 1984 and 1985 they toured colleges with an indoor play, ''The Door'', which told the story of "the massacre of Guatemalan and El Salvadorian Indians and the plight of refugees trying to escape through a diabolically opening and closing door to the North."&lt;ref&gt;Van Erven, Eugène: 
''Radical People's Theatre'' Indiana University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  With "only minimal use of the spoken word", the play made its points "with great simplicity and beauty."&lt;ref&gt;Jaques, Damien ''Play says a lot by saying little'' Milwaukee Journal, May 5, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bread and Puppet Circus.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Our Domestic Resurrection Circus - Mid-1980s]]
Until 1998, Bread &amp; Puppet hosted its annual Pageant and [[Circus]] (in full, ''Our Domestic Resurrection Circus''), in and around a natural [[amphitheater]] on its Glover grounds. In the 1990s, the festival began drawing crowds of tens of thousands, who camped on nearby farmers' land over the summer week long of the pageant. The event became unmanageable, and concerned itself less with the theater's performance. In 1998, a man was killed by accident in a fight while camping overnight for the festival, forcing director Peter Schumann to cancel the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chelseagreen.com/2004/items/rehearsingwithgods/Reviews|title=Reviews and awards for Ecology on Milkweed Edition's site - Chelsea Green Publishing|website=chelseagreen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the theater offers smaller weekend performances all summer, and traveled around [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New England]], with occasional tours around the U.S. and abroad. The theater runs a program where apprentices help produce and act in performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breadandpuppet.org/apprenticeship-and-workshops|title=Apprenticeship - Bread and Puppet Theater|website=www.breadandpuppet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York City, Bread &amp; Puppet performs at [[Theater for the New City]] during the holiday season each year.

==Conflicts==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}

===2000 Republican National Convention===
Bread &amp; Puppet volunteers were among the seventy-nine people arrested at a warehouse in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] during the [[2000 Republican National Convention]]. The [[Associated Press]] reported the scene of the "SWAT-style" raid was broadcast live by news helicopters. Years later, the AP explained there "was tense talk (later proved unfounded) of terrorist plots being hatched in the 'puppetista' headquarters, of bomb building and anarchist-fueled mayhem." Its report did not include the police's side of the story.

"A couple of our folks were down there, helping to build puppets", said Linda Elbow, company manager for Bread &amp; Puppet. "The cops went into the studio...arrested people, and took the puppets. So, now, puppets are criminals."

===2001 Halloween Parade===
The Bread &amp; Puppet Theater is a regular participant in [[New York's Village Halloween Parade]], noted for its use of giant puppets.  In 2001, Bread &amp; Puppet did not march in the parade.  The Theater's plans that year included a presentation protesting the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2014)|War in Afghanistan]].  The Halloween parade was to occur fifty days after and 1.5 miles away from the September 11, 2001 [[September 11 attacks|attack on the World Trade Center]].  It was this attack which was the pretext for starting the war which Bread &amp; Puppet Theater was protesting, and the company's "anti-war stance" reportedly "...already placed it at odds with some New Yorkers",  according to Dan Bacalzo of TheaterMania.com.  Many of the parade's macabre elements were suspended that year by its director [[Jeanne Fleming]].  It was not known until October 25 whether it would even take place.

Linda Elbow commented, "We certainly weren't saying 'Hooray for the terrorists.'  We were saying, 'Look what you're doing to the people of Afghanistan.'"  An unattributed quote in Bacalzo's report — "What you're bringing, we don't want" — suggests it was the group's selection of material that was unwelcome, not the group itself.  The report did not make it clear how the decision was made, or who made it; the incident was included as secondary background material in a piece publicizing an upcoming Bread and Puppet show.  Fleming, who was not interviewed by Bacalzo (but is quoted as if she was), says that Bread and Puppet was not "disinvited", adding that it was she who first invited the company to march in the parade when she took over as organizer.

In December 2001 the Theater returned to New York with ''The Insurrection Mass with Funeral March for a Rotten Idea: A Special Mass for the Aftermath of the Events of September 11th''.  It was presented at Theater for the New City, and billed as "a nonreligious service in the presence of several papier-mâché gods."  The "Insurrection Masses" are a common format for the Bread &amp; Puppet Theater, as are such "Funerals", though the "rotten" ideas change.

==Bread &amp; Puppet Press==
In addition to the theater, some of the Bread &amp; Puppet puppeteers operate the '''Bread &amp; Puppet Press''', directed by Elka Schumann, who is Peter Schumann's wife (and granddaughter of [[Scott Nearing]]).  The press produces posters, cards and books on the Theater's themes as well as other forms of "cheap art."  The broadsheet ''Why Cheap Art? Manifesto'' is among the press's best-known products.

==Critics' comments==
[[File:Bread and Puppet bus on tour.jpeg|thumb]]
Notable writers and performers have participated in the theater, including [[children's theater]] performer [[Paul Zaloom]] and writer [[Grace Paley]].

Other writers to have praised Bread &amp; Puppet include historian [[Howard Zinn]], who cited its "magic, beauty, and power", and poet and [[National Public Radio|NPR]] commentator [[Andrei Codrescu]], who wrote: "The Bread &amp; Puppet Theater has been so long a part of America's conscious struggle for our better selves, that it has become, paradoxically, a fixture of our subconscious."

==Reference in popular media==
The Bread &amp; Puppet Theater has a visual reference in the 2007 [[Julie Taymor]] film ''[[Across the Universe (film)|Across the Universe]]''. The movie replicated characters such as Uncle Fatso, Washer Women, White Ladies, and the many armed Mother head. The Bread &amp; Puppet Circus Band also has a reference in the costumes of the circus band during "[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]]". The difference between the real life costumes and the ones made for the movie is the real life ones are red and black, whereas in the movie they are white and black. The Bread &amp; Puppet Theater is in the film's credits.&lt;ref&gt;''Across the Universe.'' DVD. Directed by Julie Taymor. (Revolution Studios, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2008 memoir "A Freewheelin' Time: A Memoir of Greenwich Village In The Sixties", New York painter and illustrator, [[Suze Rotolo]], notes she worked a fabrication job with TB&amp;PT early in 1963 near Delancy Street on the lower east side of Manhattan. Rotolo, at the time, was the girlfriend and muse of [[Bob Dylan]] and was the inspiration for the songs "Suze (The Cough Song)", "Don't Think Twice, It's Alright", "Tomorrow Is a Long Time", "One Too Many Mornings", and "Boots of Spanish Leather".

After seeing the [[amusement park]] [[Knott's Berry Farm]] in southern California he was inspired in 1954 to open his own park in [[Queensbury, New York]], which he named [[The Great Escape &amp; Splashwater Kingdom|Storytown USA]]. In order to do this, he needed some loans from local banks.  With $500 in his pocket at the time, he walked into a bank, applied for the necessary loans, and was denied. To this, he replied to the bank manager "One day sir, I will be able to buy and sell you." Success followed this [[Mother Goose]] themed park and in 1959 he opened a second amusement park in the village of [[Lake George (village), New York|Lake George, New York]], this one named [[Gaslight Village]], which closed in 1989. Storytown USA changed its name to The Great Escape in 1983 and was eventually sold to new owners, finally winding up under the [[Six Flags]] park umbrella. Wood purchased [[Fantasy Island (US amusement park)|Fantasy Island]] in 1983 and owned it until 1989. He would later own the park again from 1992 through 1994.

'''''Cosmo the Merry Martian''''' was a comic book published by [[Archie Comics]] in the late 1950s. The comic was created by [[Bob White (comics)|Bob White]] as a way to provide a family-appropriate comic for children with an interest in the then-current [[space race]]. The title character was the first Martian to visit the Earth. The title only lasted for six issues. Every issue, including the last one, had a [[cliffhanger]] ending.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/cosmomar.htm Cosmo the Merry Martian], Toonopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the title character, other characters are '''Orbi''' (Cosmo's astronaut companion), '''Professor Thimk''' (the scientist who invented the Martian spaceship, but was not on it when it took off from Mars), and '''Astra''' (Cosmo's girlfriend). In the first issue, while they are traveling toward their intended destination of Earth, a meteor damages their spaceship, and they crash land on Earth's moon. The moon turns out to be inhabited by beings named Oogs, who live underground.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Scott. [http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/oddball/index.cgi?date=2002-07-11 "Oddball,"] Comic Book Resources (July 11, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

A reboot of the series, simply titled '''''Cosmo''''', began publication in January 2018. The new series is written by [[Ian Flynn]] with art by [[Tracy Yardley]] and Matt Herms, all of whom previously collaborated on Archie's [[Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'' comic series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/excl-archie-comics-sonic-team-reuniting-on-cosmo-revival/|title=EXCL: Archie Comics' Sonic Team Reuniting on Cosmo Revival|date=20 September 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6307">'''Edward Addison Favor''' (August 29, 1856 &amp;ndash; January 10, 1936), who was billed as '''Edward M. Favor''' or '''Ed. M. Favor''', was an [[United States|American]] [[vaudeville]] [[comedian]], singer, [[musical theatre]] performer and pioneer recording artist, who was one of the most popular stars of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.[[File:Edward_M._Favor.jpg|thumb|Edward M. Favor, ca. 1900]]

==Biography==
He was born in [[New York City]], the son of Franklin Cushman Favor and his wife Lydia, née Lowe.  Suggestions that the family name was originally LeFevre have been proved to be incorrect, as the family bible states his last name as Favor.&lt;ref name="gracyk"&gt;[http://www.gracyk.com/favor.shtml Tim Gracyk, ''Edward M. Favor'', excerpted from ''Popular American Recording Pioneers: 1895-1925'', The Haworth Press, NY, 2000.] {{ISBN|1-56024-993-5}}.  Retrieved 25 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

He began working in vaudeville as a light comedian in about 1876, and in or before 1877 married Edith Sinclair (1857-1942), who had been a successful child actress.  Billed as Favor and Sinclair, the couple worked together as a duo and in [[musical comedy|musical comedies]].  In 1887 they appeared together as members of the Edith Sinclair Comedy Company in ''A Box of Cash'', in which he played an [[Irish-American]] character.  Despite the popularity of his [[Irish people|Irish]] character roles, there is no evidence that he had any Irish ancestry.  In 1893 he and his wife appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in [[Edward E. Rice]]'s long-running [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] ''[[1492 Up To Date]]''.&lt;ref name="gracyk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="allmusic"&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/edward-m-favor-mn0000172531 Biography by Rovi at Allmusic.com]. Retrieved 25 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/jukebox/artists/detail/id/6224/ Library of Congress, Edward M. Favor]. Retrieved 25 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

He made one of his first recordings in 1893, of "The Commodore Song", taken from his previous show, ''Ship Ahoy''.  Among his other early successes were "Say Au Revoir, But Not Goodbye" (North American, 1894), "[[Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two)]]" ([[Edison Records|Edison]], 1894), and "My Best Girl's A New Yorker" ([[Columbia Records|Columbia]], 1895).&lt;ref name="allmusic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="whitburn memories"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Whitburn | first1 = Joel| title = Pop Memories 1890-1954: The History of American Popular Music| location = Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin| publisher = Record Research, Inc. | year= 1986| pages = 153| isbn = 0-89820-083-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the late 1890s, Favor had recorded for most of the major recording companies, in between his vaudeville commitments.  In 1899, he was one of the first to record on the [[Zonophone Records|Zonophone]] label, and in 1900 recorded for the first time for Eldridge R. Johnson's "Improved" record label, later to become [[Victor Records]] the next year.  He continued to appear on stage and, in 1900, was described in ''Broadway'' magazine as "one of the best light comedians on the stage" and, with his wife, as "one of the big attractions in vaudeville."&lt;ref name="gracyk" /&gt;[[File:Peck's Bad Girl (1918) - Ad.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Ad for ''[[Peck's Bad Girl]]'' (1918) with [[Mabel Normand]] and Edward M. Favor]]

He continued to make successful recordings for the next decade, sung in his "Irish-American piping [[tenor]]".&lt;ref name="loc" /&gt;  These included comic numbers for Edison, Columbia and other companies, such as "Hamlet Was A Melancholy Dane", "[[Who Threw the Overalls in Mrs. Murphy's Chowder]]?" (1901), "On a Sunday Afternoon" (1902), "Bedelia (The Irish Coon Song Serenade)" (1903), "I Think I Hear A Woodpecker Knocking At My Family Tree", and "Pocahontas" (1906).&lt;ref name="gracyk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="whitburn memories" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huntingtonhistoricalsociety.com/1901-edward-m-favor-and-mrs-murphys-chowder Huntington Historical Society, ''1901 – Edward M. Favor And Mrs. Murphy’s Chowder'', 2007]. Retrieved 25 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  He also made recordings with his wife, [[Steve Porter (singer)|Steve Porter]], and the [[American Quartet (ensemble)|American Quartet]].&lt;ref name="allmusic" /&gt;

He and his wife toured in [[South Africa]] and [[Australia]] in 1906.&lt;ref name="allmusic" /&gt;  He continued to appear in shows thereafter; the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' stated that "While [Favor and Sinclair] were rehearsing with ''The Blue Moon'' in New York City they were appearing in one of the vaudeville houses in a sketch called 'The Maguires', which they have played at least 10,000 times."  However, his career as a recording artist was in decline by 1908.  He made his final recordings for Victor in 1911, and for Edison in 1914 when he recorded "On The 7:28" and "Indoor Sports".&lt;ref name="gracyk" /&gt;

Favor continued to appear in theatrical shows through the 1920s and into the early 1930s.  In 1933, he appeared in the Broadway productions of ''John Ferguson'' and ''[[Merton of the Movies (play)|Merton of the Movies]]'', and in 1934 in ''America - Very Early''.&lt;ref name=gracyk/&gt;&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;

He died at the age of 79 in [[Brooklyn]] in 1936, of [[peritonitis]].&lt;ref name=gracyk/&gt;

'''Erotic art''' covers any [[Work of art|artistic work]] that is intended to evoke [[Sexual arousal|erotic arousal]] or that depicts scenes of [[human sexuality|sexual activity]]. It is a type of [[erotica]] and includes drawings, engravings, films, paintings, photographs, and sculptures, and writing.

==Definition==
{{details|Erotic literature}}
The definition of erotic art is somewhat subjective, and dependent on context, since perceptions of both what is ''erotic'' and what is ''art'' vary. For example, a sculpture of a [[phallus]] in some cultures may be considered a traditional symbol of potency rather than overtly erotic. Material that is produced to illustrate [[sex education]] may be perceived by others as inappropriately erotic.

A distinction is often made between erotic art and [[pornography]], which also depicts scenes of sexual activity and is intended to evoke erotic arousal, but is not usually considered [[fine art]]. Some draw a distinction based on the work's intent and message: erotic art would be works intended for purposes in addition to arousal, which could be appreciated as art by someone uninterested in their erotic content. [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] Justice [[Potter Stewart]] famously wrote that the distinction was intuitive, saying about hard-core pornography which would not be legally protected as erotic art, "I know it when I see it"&lt;ref&gt;''Jacobellis v. Ohio'', 378 U.S. 184, 197 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical==
{{details|History of erotic depictions#Early depictions|Erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum}}
Among the oldest surviving examples of erotic depictions are [[Paleolithic]] cave paintings and carvings, but many cultures have created erotic art. Artifacts have been discovered from ancient Mesopotamia depicting explicit heterosexual sex.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=Jeremy|first2=Anthony|last2=Green|title=Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=05LXAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Inana|publisher=The British Museum Press|year=1992|isbn=0-7141-1705-6|pages=150-152|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NemetNejat"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nemet-Nejat|first=Karen Rhea|date=1998|title=Daily Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|location=Santa Barbara, California|publisher=Greenwood|series=Daily Life|isbn=978-0313294976|page=137|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glyptic art from the [[Sumer]]ian [[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|Early Dynastic Period]] frequently shows scenes of frontal sex in the [[missionary position]].&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; In Mesopotamian [[Ex-voto|votive plaques]] from the early second millennium BC, the man is usually shown entering the woman from behind while she bends over, drinking [[beer]] through a straw.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; [[Assyria|Middle Assyrian]] lead votive [[figurine]]s often represent the man standing and penetrating the woman as she rests on top of an altar.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; Scholars have traditionally interpreted all these depictions as scenes of [[Hieros gamos|ritual sex]],&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; but they are more likely to be associated with the cult of [[Inanna]], the goddess of sex and prostitution.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; Many sexually explicit images were found in the temple of Inanna at [[Assur]],&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; which also contained models of male and female sexual organs,&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; including stone [[phallus|phalli]], which may have been worn around the neck as an amulet or used to decorate [[Cult image|cult statues]],&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; and clay models of the female [[vulva]].&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt;

Depictions of sexual intercourse were not part of the general repertory of ancient Egyptian formal art,&lt;ref name="Gay1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robins|first1=Gay|title=Women in Ancient Egypt|date=1993|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-95469-6|pages=189-190|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UTSA88SVHCMC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=Turin+erotic+papyrus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMmKPkn8HYAhXLQt8KHePuB48Q6AEIRTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Turin%20erotic%20papyrus&amp;f=false|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rudimentary sketches of heterosexual intercourse have been found on pottery fragments and in graffiti.&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; The [[Turin Erotic Papyrus]] (Papyrus 55001) is a {{convert|8.5|ft|m}} by {{convert|10|in|cm}} Egyptian papyrus scroll discovered at [[Deir el-Medina]],&lt;ref name=oconnor2001&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connor|first=David|title=Eros in Egypt|url=http://fontes.lstc.edu/~rklein/Documents/eros_in_egypt.htm|website=Archaeology Odyssey|date=September–October 2001|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; the last two-thirds of which consist of a series of twelve [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]]s showing men and women in various [[sexual position]]s.&lt;ref name=oconnor2001/&gt; The men in the illustrations are "scruffy, balding, short, and paunchy" with exaggeratedly large genitalia&lt;ref name=schmidt2000&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmidt|first1=Robert A.|last2=Voss|first2=Barbara L.|date=2000|title=Archaeologies of Sexuality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eSBVQpifqhkC&amp;lpg=PA254&amp;pg=PA254#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Turin%20Papyrus%22&amp;f=false|location=Abingdon-on-Thames, England|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-22366-9|page=254|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not conform to Egyptian standards of physical attractiveness,&lt;ref name=schmidt2000/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; but the women are [[nubile]]&lt;ref name=schmidt2000/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; and they are shown with objects from traditional erotic [[iconography]], such as [[convolvulus]] leaves and, in some scenes, they are even holding items traditionally associated with [[Hathor]], the goddess of love, such as [[lotus flower]]s, monkeys, and [[sistra]].&lt;ref name=schmidt2000/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; The scroll was probably painted in the Ramesside period (1292-1075 BC)&lt;ref name=oconnor2001/&gt; and its high artistic quality indicates that was produced for a wealthy audience.&lt;ref name=oconnor2001/&gt; No other similar scrolls have yet been discovered.&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt;

The ancient [[Greeks]] painted sexual scenes on their ceramics, many of them famous for being some of the earliest depictions of same-sex relations and pederasty, and there are numerous sexually explicit paintings on the walls of ruined Roman buildings in [[Pompeii]]. The [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] of [[Peru]] in [[South America]] are another ancient people that sculpted explicit scenes of sex into their pottery.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, M., Leslie, J. &amp; Butts, S. (2005) ''Pornography: the Secret History of Civilization'' [DVD], Koch Vision.&lt;/ref&gt; There is an entire gallery devoted to pre-Columbian erotic ceramics ([[Moche (culture)|Moche]] culture) in [[Lima]] at the [[Larco Museum]].

Additionally, there has been a long tradition of erotic painting in Eastern cultures. In [[Japan]], for example, [[Shunga (art)|shunga]] appeared in the 13th century and continued to grow in popularity until the late 19th century when photography was invented.&lt;ref name = shunga&gt;{{cite web| title = Shunga| publisher = Japanese art net and architecture users system| year = 2001| url = http://www.aisf.or.jp/%7Ejaanus/deta/s/shunga.htm| accessdate = 2006-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the erotic art of [[China]] reached its popular peak during the latter part of the [[Ming Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Bertholet, L.

[[File:Fellatiomoche.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Moche (culture)|Moche]] ceramic depicting fellatio, ca. 200 AD, [[Larco Museum]] Collection]]
In Europe, starting with the [[Renaissance]], there was a tradition of producing [[erotica]] for the amusement of the aristocracy. In the early 16th century, the text ''[[I Modi]]'' was a [[woodcut]] album created by the designer [[Giulio Romano]], the engraver [[Marcantonio Raimondi]] and the poet [[Pietro Aretino]]. In 1601 [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]] painted the "[[Amor Vincit Omnia (Caravaggio)|Amor Vincit Omnia]]," for the collection of the Marquis Vincenzo Giustiniani.

An erotic cabinet, ordered by [[Catherine the Great]], seems to have been adjacent to her suite of rooms in the [[Gatchina Palace]]. The furniture was highly eccentric with tables that had large penises for legs. Penises and vaginas were carved on the furniture. The walls were covered in erotic art. The rooms and the furniture were seen in 1941 by two Wehrmacht-officers but they seem to have vanished since then.&lt;ref&gt;Igorʹ Semenovich Kon and James Riordan, ''Sex and Russian Society'' page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4512/Cultuur/archief/article/detail/1775415/2003/12/06/Het-Geheim-van-Catherina-de-Grote.dhtml|title=Het Geheim van Catherina de Grote|newspaper=Trouw|author=Peter Dekkers|date=6 December 2003|trans-title=The Secret of Catherine the Great|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; A documentary by Peter Woditsch suggests that the cabinet was in the [[Peterhof Palace]] and not in Gatchina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Secret of Catherine the Great|url=http://www.deproductie.nl/en/films/het-geheim-van-catherina-de-grote/|last=Woditsch|first=Peter|website=De Productie|accessdate=8 July 2014}} Includes trailer of the documentary by Peter Woditsch.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition was continued by other, more modern painters, such as [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]], [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]], [[Jean-François Millet|Millet]], [[Balthus]], [[Picasso]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Egon Schiele]]. Schiele served time in jail and had several works destroyed by the authorities for offending contemporary mores with his depictions of nude girls.

By the 20th century, photography became the most common medium for erotic art. Publishers like [[Taschen]] mass-produced erotic illustrations and [[erotic photography]].

==Modern==
[[File:Ciągliński Symbolic dance.jpg|thumb|150px|left|''Symbolic dance'' by [[Jan Ciągliński]], late 19th-century subtle [[lesbian]] erotica ([[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]).]]
Today, erotic artists thrive, although in some circles, much of the genre is still not as well accepted as the more standard genres of art such as portraiture and landscape. During the last few centuries, society has broadened its view of what can be considered as art and several new styles developed during the 19th century such as [[Impressionism]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]]. This has given today's artists a broad variety of genres from which to choose, including; [[Fantasy art|fantasy]], [[Pinup art|pinup]], [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[Fetish art|fetish]], [[Adult comics|comics]], [[anime]], [[hentai]], and many other niche genres all with erotic elements.

Classic "war-era" pin-ups like the works of [[Alberto Vargas]], [[Gil Elvgren]] and [[Baron Von Lind]], are still as popular as their contemporaries: [[Bunny Yeager]], [[Greg Hildebrandt]], [[Olivia De Berardinis]], [[Hajime Sorayama]], [[Aslan (artist)|Alain Aslan]], and [[List of pin-up artists|others]].

The acceptance and popularity of erotic art has pushed the genre into mainstream pop-culture and has created many famous icons. [[Frank Frazetta]], [[Luis Royo]], [[Boris Vallejo]], [[Chris Achilleos]], and [[Clyde Caldwell]] are among the artists whose work has been widely distributed.  The Guild of Erotic Artists were formed in 2002 to bring together a body of like minded individuals whose sole purpose was to express themselves and promote the sensual art of erotica for the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview, see Eberhard and Phyllis Kronhausen: ''Erotic Art.'' Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers, [[New York City|New York]] 1993, {{ISBN|0-88184-970-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2010 and 2015 [[sexologist]] and [[gallerist]] [[Laura Henkel]], curator of the [[Erotic Heritage Museum]] and the Sin City Gallery, organised 12 Inches of Sin, an exhibition focussing on art that expresses a diverse view of sexuality and challenging ideas of high and low art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/las-vegas-sexologist-art|title=One Sexologist’s Quest to Stimulate Las Vegas’ Art Scene|website=The Creators Project|author=Alyssa Buffenstein|date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Henkel collaborated with former [[MoMA]] curator and art historian Rosa JH Berland to create the Modern Provocateur Manifesto, that describes artwork that is about human sexuality.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Legal standards==
Whether or not an instance of erotic art is [[obscene]] depends on the standards of the jurisdisction and community in which it is displayed.

In the [[United States]], the 1973 ruling of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Miller v. California]]'' established a three-tiered [[Miller test|test]] to determine what was obscene—and thus not protected, versus what was merely erotic and thus protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

Delivering the opinion of the court, Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;
The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether 'the average person, applying contemporary community standards' would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.&lt;ref&gt;''Miller v. California'', 413 U.S. 15, 24 (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As this is still much more vague than other judicial tests within U.S. jurisprudence, it has not reduced the conflicts that often result, especially from the ambiguities concerning what the "contemporary community standards" are. Similar difficulties in distinguishing between erotica and obscenity have been found in other legal systems.

'''Feminist revisionist mythology''' is [[feminist literature]] informed by [[feminist literary criticism]], or by the politics of [[feminism]] more broadly and that engages with [[mythology]], [[fairy tales]], [[religion]], or other areas.

==Overview==
[[Lisa Tuttle]] has defined feminist theory as asking "new questions of old texts".&lt;ref name="EncycFeminism-p184"&gt;Tuttle, Lisa. ''Encyclopedia of Feminism''. Harlow: Longman 1986, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; She cites the goals of feminist criticism as (1) developing and uncovering a female tradition of writing, (2) interpreting symbolism of women's writing so that it will not be lost or ignored by the male point of view, (3) rediscovering old texts, (4) analyzing women writers and their writings from a female perspective, (5) resisting sexism in literature, and (6) increasing awareness of the sexual politics of language and style.&lt;ref name="EncycFeminism-p184" /&gt; Feminist revisionist mythology tends to fulfill at least one of these goals. Instead of just studying prior works though, it is the revision of old texts to create new ones.

Revision Mythmaking is a strategic revisionist use of [[gender]] imagery and is a means of exploring and attempting to transform the self and the culture or, in other words, to "subvert and transform the life and literature women poets inherit".&lt;ref&gt;Ostriker, Alicia. ''Stealing the Language: The Emergence of Women's Poetry in America''. Women's Press, 1987. pp. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alicia Ostriker]] states in her essay "[[Stealing the Language]]" that "we cannot measure the work of women poets, past or present, without a thorough--and if possible demystified-- awareness of the critical context in which they have composed and continued to compose their work. We need to recognize that our customary literary language is systematically gendered in ways that influence what we approve and disapprove of, making it extremely difficult for us to acknowledge certain kinds of originality--of difference--in women poets".&lt;ref&gt;Ostriker, Alicia, ''Stealing the Language: The Emergence of Women's Poetry in America''. Women's Press, 1987. pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; "The belief that true poetry is genderless—which is a disguised form of believing that true poetry is masculine—means that we have not learned to see women poets generically, to recognize the tradition they belong to, or discuss either the limitation or the strengths of that tradition".&lt;ref&gt;Ostriker, Alicia, ''Stealing the Language: The Emergence of Women's Poetry in America''. Women's Press, 1987. pp. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Authors have used multiple methods of revising myths, including retelling them entirely from the point of view of the main female character, recreating the story in a way that attempts to break down the treatment of women as inactive objects, and telling the story with a feminist narrator who satirically pokes fun at the flawed view of women in the original text.

"Fables are centuries old and were devised to carry a moral lesson, such as Aesop's Fables. Suniti Namjoshi's eloquent and knowledgeable 'Blue Donkey' stories draw on this classic tradition of having beasts or mythical birds able to speak and act like humans but the 'Blue Donkey' provides ironic comment rather than a moral lesson. Angela Carter has rewritten fairy tales from the point of view of the heroine. In her collection, ''The Bloody Chamber'', she examines the messages about adolescent sexuality in stories like 'Beauty and the Beast' and 'Snow White' overturning the sexual mythology of simple fairy stories."&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, Pearlie. ''Fairy Tales.'' ''Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge''. 3. New York: Rutledge, 2000. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Beauty and the Beast]], a fairy tale first published in 1740 and later analyzed by Angela Carter}}{{Efn|[[Snow White]], a German fairy tale later analyzed by Angela Carter}}

Since the core of [[historical revisionism|revisionist mythmaking]] for feminist poets lies in the challenging of [[gender stereotypes]] embodied in myth, revisionism in its most obvious form consists of hit-and-run attacks on familiar images and the social and literary conventions supporting them. The poems dismantle the literary convention to reveal the social ones and invert both, usually by the simple device of making "the Other" into the primary subject.&lt;ref&gt;Ostriker, Alicia, ''Stealing the Language: The Emergence of Women's Poetry in America''. Women's Press, 1987. pp. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelly, Jr., "A New Interpretation of Information Rate", ''Bell System Technical Journal'', Vol. 35, July 1956, pp. 917-26&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kelly Betting ==
{{main|Kelly criterion}}
'''Kelly betting''' or '''proportional betting''' is an application of [[information theory]] to [[investing]] and [[gambling]]. Its discoverer was [[John Larry Kelly, Jr]].

Part of Kelly's insight was to have the gambler maximize the expectation of the ''logarithm'' of his capital, rather than the expected profit from each bet.  This is important, since in the latter case, one would be led to gamble all he had when presented with a favorable bet, and if he lost, would have no capital with which to place subsequent bets.  Kelly realized that it was the logarithm of the gambler's capital which is additive in sequential bets, and "to which the law of large numbers applies."

===Side information===
A '''[[bit]]''' is the amount of '''[[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]]''' in a bettable event with two possible outcomes and even odds.  Obviously we could double our money if we knew beforehand for certain what the outcome of that event would be.  Kelly's insight was that no matter how complicated the betting scenario is, we can use an optimum betting strategy, called the '''[[Kelly criterion]]''', to make our money grow exponentially with whatever side information we are able to obtain.  The value of this "illicit" side information is measured as '''[[mutual information]]''' relative to the outcome of the betable event:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}I(X;Y) &amp; = \mathbb{E}_Y \{D_{\mathrm{KL}}\big(P(X|Y) \| P(X|I) \big) \} \\
&amp; = \mathbb{E}_Y \{D_{\mathrm{KL}}\big(P(X|\textrm{side\ information\ } Y) \| P(X|\textrm{stated\ odds\ }I) \big) 
\}, \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
 
where ''Y'' is the side information, ''X'' is the outcome of the betable event, and ''I'' is the state of the bookmaker's knowledge.  This is the average [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]], or '''information gain''', of the [[posterior probability|''a posteriori'']] probability distribution of ''X'' given the value of ''Y'' relative to the [[prior probability|''a priori'']] distribution, or stated odds, on ''X''.  Notice that the expectation is taken over ''Y'' rather than ''X'':  we need to evaluate how accurate, in the long term, our side information ''Y'' is before we start betting real money on ''X''.  This is a straightforward application of '''[[Bayesian inference]].'''  Note that the side information ''Y'' might affect not just our knowledge of the event ''X'' but also the event itself.  For example, ''Y'' might be a horse that had too many oats or not enough water.  The same mathematics applies in this case, because from the bookmaker's point of view, the occasional race fixing is already taken into account when he makes his odds.

The nature of side information is extremely finicky.  We have already seen that it can affect the actual event as well as our knowledge of the outcome.  Suppose we have an informer, who tells us that a certain horse is going to win.  We certainly do not want to bet all our money on that horse just upon a rumor:  that informer may be betting on another horse, and may be spreading rumors just so he can get better odds himself.  Instead, as we have indicated, we need to evaluate our side information in the long term to see how it correlates with the outcomes of the races.  This way we can determine exactly how reliable our informer is, and place our bets precisely to maximize the expected logarithm of our capital according to the Kelly criterion.  Even if our informer is lying to us, we can still profit from his lies if we can find some reverse correlation between his tips and the actual race results.

===Doubling rate===
Doubling rate in gambling on a [[horse racing|horse race]] is &lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas M. Cover]], Joy A. Thomas. ''Elements of information theory'', 1st Edition.  New York: Wiley-Interscience, 1991. {{ISBN|0-471-06259-6}}, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; W(b,p) = \mathbb E[\log_2 S(X)] = \sum_{i=1}^m p_i \log_2 b_i o_i &lt;/math&gt;

where there are &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; horses, the probability of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th horse winning being &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;, the proportion of wealth bet on the horse being &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[odds]] (payoff) being &lt;math&gt;o_i&lt;/math&gt; (e.g., &lt;math&gt;o_i=2&lt;/math&gt; if the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th horse winning pays double the amount bet).  This quantity is maximized by proportional (Kelly) gambling:

: &lt;math&gt; b = p \,&lt;/math&gt;

for which

: &lt;math&gt; \max_b W(b,p) = \sum_i p_i \log_2 o_i - H(p) \, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;H(p)&lt;/math&gt; is [[information entropy]].

===Expected gains===
An important but simple relation exists between the amount of side information a gambler obtains and the expected exponential growth of his capital (Kelly):

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbb E \log K_t = \log K_0 + \sum_{i=1}^t H_i &lt;/math&gt;

for an optimal betting strategy, where &lt;math&gt;K_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial capital, &lt;math&gt;K_t&lt;/math&gt; is the capital after the ''t''th bet, and &lt;math&gt;H_i&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of side information obtained concerning the ''i''th bet (in particular, the [[mutual information]] relative to the outcome of each betable event). This equation applies in the absence of any transaction costs or minimum bets. When these constraints apply (as they invariably do in real life), another important gambling concept comes into play: the gambler (or unscrupulous investor) must face a certain probability of ultimate ruin, which is known as the [[gambler's ruin]] scenario. Note that even food, clothing, and shelter can be considered fixed transaction costs and thus contribute to the gambler's probability of ultimate ruin.

This equation was the first application of Shannon's theory of information outside its prevailing paradigm of data communications (Pierce).

==Applications for self-information==

[[Image:Sandebits.png|thumb|256px|right|Surprisal and evidence in bits, as logarithmic measures of probability and odds respectively.]]

The logarithmic probability measure [[self-information]] or surprisal,&lt;ref&gt;Tribus, Myron (1961) ''Thermodynamics and Thermostatics: An Introduction to Energy, Information and States of Matter, with Engineering Applications'' (D. Van Nostrand Company Inc., 24 West 40 Street, New York 18, New York, U.S.A) ASIN: B000ARSH5S.&lt;/ref&gt; whose average is [[information entropy]]/uncertainty and whose average difference is [[Kullback–Leibler divergence|KL-divergence]], has applications to odds-analysis all by itself.  Its two primary strengths are that surprisals: (i) reduce minuscule probabilities to numbers of manageable size, and (ii) add whenever probabilities multiply.

For example, one might say that "the number of states equals two to the number of bits" i.e. #states = 2&lt;sup&gt;#bits&lt;/sup&gt;.  Here the quantity that's measured in bits is the logarithmic information measure mentioned above.  Hence there are N bits of surprisal in landing all heads on one's first toss of N coins.

The additive nature of surprisals, and one's ability to get a feel for their meaning with a handful of coins, can help one put improbable events (like winning the lottery, or having an accident) into context.  For example if one out of 17 million tickets is a winner, then the surprisal of winning from a single random selection is about 24 bits.  Tossing 24 coins a few times might give you a feel for the surprisal of getting all heads on the first try.

The additive nature of this measure also comes in handy when weighing alternatives.  For example, imagine that the surprisal of harm from a vaccination is 20 bits.  If the surprisal of catching a disease without it is 16 bits, but the surprisal of harm from the disease if you catch it is 2 bits, then the surprisal of harm from NOT getting the vaccination is only 16+2=18 bits.  Whether or not you decide to get the vaccination (e.g. the monetary cost of paying for it is not included in this discussion), you can in that way at least take responsibility for a decision informed to the fact that not getting the vaccination involves more than one bit of additional risk.

More generally, one can relate probability p to bits of surprisal ''sbits'' as probability = 1/2&lt;sup&gt;sbits&lt;/sup&gt;.  As suggested above, this is mainly useful with small probabilities.  However, Jaynes pointed out that with true-false assertions one can also define bits of evidence ''ebits'' as the surprisal against minus the surprisal for.  This evidence in bits relates simply to the odds ratio = p/(1-p) = 2&lt;sup&gt;ebits&lt;/sup&gt;, and has advantages similar to those of self-information itself.

==Applications in games of chance==

Information theory can be thought of as a way of quantifying information so as to make the best decision in the face of imperfect information. That is, how to make the best decision using only the information you have available. The point of betting is to rationally assess all relevant variables of an uncertain game/race/match, then compare them to the bookmaker's assessments, which usually comes in the form of odds or spreads and 
place the proper bet if the assessments differ sufficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Kristen Brinch. (2006) [http://pure.au.dk/portal/files/1627/000145742-145742.pdf ''Sports Betting from a Behavioral Finance Point of View''] (Arhus School of Business).&lt;/ref&gt; The area of gambling where this has the most use is sports betting. Sports handicapping lends itself to information theory extremely well because of the availability of statistics.  For many years noted economists have tested different mathematical theories using sports as their laboratory, with vastly differing results.

One theory regarding sports betting is that it is a [[random walk]]. Random walk is a scenario where new information, prices and returns will fluctuate by chance, this is part of the efficient market hypothesis. The underlying belief of the efficient market hypothesis is that the market will always make adjustments for any new information. Therefore no one can beat the market because they are trading on the same information from which the market adjusted. However, according to Fama,&lt;ref&gt;Fama, E.F. (1970) "Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Independent Work", ''Journal of Financial Economics'' Volume 25, 383-417&lt;/ref&gt; to have an efficient market three qualities need to be met:

* There are no transaction costs in trading securities
* All available information is costlessly available to all market participants
* All agree on the implications of the current information for the current price and distributions of future prices of each security

Statisticians have shown that it's the third condition which allows for information theory to be useful in sports handicapping. When everyone doesn't agree on how information will affect the outcome of the event, we get differing opinions.

The following is a glossary of traditional English-language terms used in the three overarching [[cue sports]] disciplines: ''[[carom billiards|carom (or carambole) billiards]]'' referring to the various {{gli|carom}} games played on a [[billiard table]] without {{gli|pockets}}; ''[[Pool (cue sports)|pool (pocket billiards)]]'', which denotes a host of games played on a table with six pockets; and ''[[snooker]]'', played on a large pocket table, and which has a sport culture unto itself distinct from pool. There are also hybrid pocket/carom games such as [[English billiards]].
{{Horizontal TOC|nonum=y}}

==Definitions and language==
The term "{{gli|billiards}}" is sometimes used to refer to all of the cue sports, to a specific class of them, or to specific ones such as English billiards; this article uses the term in its most generic sense unless otherwise noted.

The labels "[[British English|British]]" and "[[United Kingdom|UK]]" as applied to entries in this glossary refer to terms originating in the UK and also used in countries that were fairly recently part of the [[British Empire]] and/or are part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], as opposed to [[US English|US]] (and, often, [[Canadian English|Canadian]]) terminology.  The terms "American" or "US" as applied here refer generally to North American usage.  However, due to the predominance of US-originating terminology in most internationally competitive pool (as opposed to snooker), US terms are also common in the pool context in other countries in which English is at least a minority language, and US (and borrowed French) terms predominate in carom billiards. Similarly, British terms predominate in the world of snooker, English billiards and blackball, regardless of the players' nationalities.

The term "blackball" is used in this glossary to refer to both [[Blackball (pool)|blackball and eight-ball pool]] as played in the Commonwealth, as a shorthand.  Blackball was chosen because it is less ambiguous ("eight-ball pool" is too easily confused with the related "[[eight-ball]]"), and blackball is globally standardized by an [[International Olympic Committee]]-recognized [[Sports governing body|governing body]], the [[World Pool-Billiard Association]] (WPA); meanwhile, its ancestor, eight-ball pool, is largely a folk game, like North American {{gli|bar pool}}, and to the extent that its rules have been codified, they have been done so by competing authorities with different rulesets.  (For the same reason, the glossary's information on eight-ball and [[nine-ball]] draws principally on the stable WPA rules, because there are many competing amateur leagues and even professional tours with divergent rules for these games.)

Foreign-language terms are generally not within the scope of this list, unless they have become an integral part of billiards terminology in English (e.g. {{gli|massé|{{lang|fr|massé|nocat=y}}}}), or they are crucial to meaningful discussion of a game not widely known in the English-speaking world.

&lt;dd&gt; ''Also '''ahead session'''.''
A {{gli|match}} format in which a player has to establish a lead of an agreed number of {{gli|frame|frames}} ({{gli|game|games}}) in order to win (e.g. in a ten ahead race a player wins when she/he has won ten more {{gli|rack (noun)|racks}} than the opponent).&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt; ''Contrast {{gli|race|race [to]}}.'' &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| anchor }}
&lt;dd&gt; To {{gli|frozen|freeze}} a ball to a {{gli|cushion}}; such a ball may be said to be '''anchored''' (British: {{gli|tight}}).  This term is largely obsolete [[Balkline and straight rail|balkline billiards]] jargon.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt;{{rp|9}} &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| anchor nurse }}

With one {{gli|object ball}} being {{gli|anchor|anchored}} ({{gli|frozen}}, British: {{gli|tight}}) to a {{gli|cushion}} and the second object ball just slightly away from the cushion, the {{gli|cue ball}} is gently grazed across the face of both balls, freezing the away ball to the rail and moving the frozen ball away the same distance its partner was previously, in an identical but reversed configuration, in position to be struck again by the cue ball from the opposite side to repeat this pattern, back and forth.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt;{{rp|9}} ''Compare {{gli|cradle cannon}}.'' &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| anchor space }}
&lt;dd&gt; A {{convert|7|in|adj=on}} square box drawn on [[Billiard table|the table]] in [[Balkline and straight rail|balkline billiards]], from the termination of a {{gli|balkline}} with the {{gli|cushion}}, thus defining a restricted space in which only 3 {{gli|point|points}} may be scored before one ball must be driven from the area. It developed to curtail the effectiveness of the {{gli|chuck nurse}}, which in turn had been invented to thwart the effectiveness of {{gli|Parker's box}} in stopping long, repetitive runs using the {{gli|anchor nurse}}.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt; &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| angle of incidence }}
&lt;dd&gt; The angle at which a ball approaches a {{gli|cushion}}, as measured from the [[perpendicular]] to the cushion.&lt;ref name="Knuchell"/&gt;{{rp|120}}  The phrase has been in use since as early as 1653.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt; &lt;/dd&gt;

The ball placed at the front of a group of {{gli|rack|racked}} {{gli|object ball|object balls}} (i.e., toward the {{gli|break|breaker}} and furthest from the racker), and in most games situated over the table's {{gli|foot spot}}.&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt;{{rp|32}} &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| around the table }}
&lt;dd&gt; In carom games, a shot in which in attempting to score, the cue ball contacts three or more {{gli|cushion|cushions}}, usually including both {{gli|short rail|short rails}}.&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt; &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term|term= ball return |content=ball return {{anchor|ball-return|ball return mechanism|ball-return mechanism}}}}
&lt;dd&gt;A collection bin mounted below the foot end of a table, to which balls potted in any pocket will return by means of gravity-assisted gutters or troughs running from each pocket opening to the bin; these are the '''ball-return mechanism''', which may be internal to the table or an external gutter system. Ball returns have been in use since at least the 1700s. Pockets which simply collect balls are known as {{gli|drop pockets}}.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt; A table without a ball return may be called a "drop pocket table", while a table featuring a ball return may be called a "gully table".&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt;{{rp|37, 39}} Coin-operated {{gli|bar table|bar tables}} have ball-return mechanisms that separate the {{gli|cue ball}} from the {{gli|object ball|object balls}} so that the object balls are captured when pocketed until the game ends, then released when paid for again, while the cue ball is continually returned for continued play after {{gli|scratch|scratches}}. This type of table can use a variety of methods to distinguish the cue ball from object balls including the {{gli|Magnetic cue ball}}, the dense ceramic "{{gli|rock}}" and the oversized "{{gli|grapefruit}}" ball. Ball return mechanisms have also been devised that use a smaller, lighter cue ball, instead of a magnetic or heavier one. There are tables that use optical sensors to distinguish a standard cue ball from object balls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.diamondbilliards.com/CommercialTables/SmartTable.aspx |title=The Smart Table Coin-op |publisher=Diamond Billiard Products |work=DiamondBilliards.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term|term= bank-the-8 |content=bank-the-8 {{anchor|bank the 8|bank-the-eight|bank the eight}}}}
&lt;dd&gt; A rule variant common in {{gli|bar pool}} versions of [[eight-ball]], in which the 8-ball must be pocketed on a {{gli|bank shot}} (generally this would either be accomplished via a bank shot proper or a {{gli|kick shot}}); shooting the 8 straight in is a loss of game. Players may agree before the game begins to invoke this rule, or one player may challenge another player (who might accept or refuse) to conclude the game in this manner after it is already under way. Playing bank-the-8 can be considered rude if many other players are waiting to use the table, since it often makes the game last considerably longer. Often on bar tables three scratches determines a loss. The same with last-pocket.&lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term|term= bar player |content=bar player {{anchor|bar players|bar league|bar league player}}}}
&lt;dd&gt; ''Also '''bar league player'''.''

{{Term|term= bar pool |content=bar pool {{anchor|bar rules|pub pool|pub rules|tavern pool}}}}
&lt;dd&gt; {{ghat|Also '''bar rules''', '''pub pool''', '''tavern pool'''.}}
[[Pool (cue sports)|Pool]], almost always a variant of [[eight-ball]], that is played by {{gli|bar player|bar players}} on a {{gli|bar table}}. Bar pool has rules that vary from region to region, sometimes even from venue to venue in the same city, especially in the U.S. Wise players thus ensure understanding of and agreement to the rules before engaging in a {{gli|money game}} under bar rules. Typical differences between bar pool and tournament eight-ball are the lack of {{gli|ball-in-hand}} after a {{gli|foul}}, the elimination of a number of fouls, and (with numbered ball sets) the requirement that most aspects of a shot be {{gli|call shot|called}} (including {{gli|cushion|cushions}} and other {{gli|object ball|object balls}} to be contacted) not just the {{gli|target ball}} and {{gli|pocket}}. Bar pool has evolved into this "nitpicky" version principally to make the games last longer, since bar pool is typically played on coin-operated tables that cost money per-game rather than per-hour. Competitive league pool played on bar tables, however, usually uses international, national or local/regional league rules, and is not what is usually meant by "bar pool". ''Not to be confused with the game of [[bar billiards]].'' &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term|term= bar table |content=bar table {{anchor|pub table|tavern table|coin-operated table|coin operated table|coin-op table|coinop table|bar box|barbox}}}}
&lt;dd&gt; {{ghat|Also '''bar box''', '''pub table''', '''tavern table''', '''coin-operated table''', '''coin-op table'''.}}
A distinctive size of pool table found in [[bar (establishment)|bars]]/[[Public house|pubs]]/[[tavern]]s as well as various other venues such as [[family entertainment center]]s and [[Video arcade|arcade rooms]] at [[bowling alley]]s. These are smaller than the full-size tables found in [[pool halls]]. While typical professional and competition tables are {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=on}} × {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}} or {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} × {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=on}}, bar boxes are typically {{convert|7|ft|m|abbr=on}} × {{convert|3.5|ft|m|abbr=on}}. However, 4×8 and even 3×6 examples can sometimes be found. In bars they are almost always coin-operated. Most North American brands of bar tables have pocket proportions opposite those of regular tables in that the side pockets are remarkably tight while the corners are more generous and are therefore considered irregular. Another factor is the cue ball; these tables capture {{gli|object balls}} to minimize replays, but selectively return the cue ball by identifying it mechanically to allow complete games. To do this they employ one of two mechanisms to return a {{gli|scratch|scratched}} cue ball; these are oversized or extra-dense. Because these cue balls do not play as competition cue balls (especially with regard to {{gli|cut shot|cut}} (due to their larger size) and {{gli|stop shot|stop}}/{{gli|draw shot|draw}} shots (due to their larger mass) respectively, they change the characteristics of the cue ball and are therefore deprecated by aficionados. {{gli|smash-through}}). However, modern bar tables make use of a magnetic core with a regulation or near-regulation size and weight paired with a magnet mechanism within the table's {{gli|ball return}} system that separates out the cue ball without requiring cue ball characteristics that affect play.&lt;ref name="RGivens"&gt;{{cite book

{{Term| big ball }}
&lt;dd&gt; A [[carom billiards]] metaphor, it refers to an object ball positioned and being approached in such a manner that a near miss will rebound off a cushion and still score. It is ''as if'' the ball were larger than normal, making it easier to contact. Normally a ball a couple inches from a rail is a big ball, but only if being approached from an angle and if all the prerequisite rails have already been contacted. A ball near a corner can effectively be a foot wide.

{{Term| big pocket }}
&lt;dd&gt; A [[pocket billiards]] and occasionally [[snooker]] term (inherited from carom billiards by way of "{{gli|big ball}}", above), it is a metaphor for a shot that is very difficult to miss pocketing for any of a number of reasons, most commonly either because the object ball is positioned such that a near miss on one side of it will likely cause the cue ball to rebound into the object ball off the rail and pocket it anyway, or another ball is positioned such that if the target ball does not go straight in, it is still likely to go in off the other ball in a {{gli|kiss}}. It is ''as if'' the pocket, for this one shot, had become larger. The term can also refer to the angle of shot toward a pocket, especially a side pocket; the pocket is said to be "bigger", for example, on a shot that is only a 5-degree angle away from straight on, than on a 45-degree angle shot which is much more likely to hit one of the cushion points and bounce away. &lt;/dd&gt;

In [[European Pocket Billiard Federation]] (EPBF) [[nine-ball]], the break box is a zone in the "{{gli|kitchen}}" of the {{gli|head}} (British: {{gli|bottom}}) of the [[Billiard table|table]], from which the {{gli|break|break shot}} must be taken with the {{gli|cue ball}},&lt;ref name="Jewett BD 2008-02"&gt;{{BDMag|first=Bob|last=Jewett|date=February 2008|title=Killing Me Softly?: The Outbreak of the Soft Break Threatens the Game of 9-ball|volume=30|issue=3|pages= 34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Panozzo BD 2008-02"&gt;{{BDMag|first=Mike|last=Panozzo|date=February 2008|title=Long Live the Cup!|volume=30|issue=3|pages= 34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; not unlike {{gli|"D", the|the "D"}} zone used in [[snooker]], [[English billiards]] and [[Blackball (pool)|blackball]].

This departure from [[World Pool-Billiard Association|WPA]] World Standardised Rules defeats the common break-from-the-side-rail technique for pocketing the 9 ball to win the game on the break; while 9 ball breaks are still possible, they are much more difficult under this rule.&lt;ref name="Jewett BD 2008-02"/&gt; This EPBF Euro-Tour requirement was added in 2008 to the Europe vs. US [[all-star]] team event, the [[Mosconi Cup]], but has not otherwise been seen much by non-Europeans {{as of|lc=y|2011|post=.}} &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| calcutta }}
&lt;dd&gt; A player's auction at a pool tournament. Each player is called and players and spectators bid on the player. The highest bidder(s) pays their bid to the calcutta, and by doing so invest in that player's success. If a player wins or places in the tournament, those who "bought" the player receive a percentage of the total calcutta payout, usually tracking the percentage payout of the tournament prize fund. Typically, players have the option of purchasing half of themselves when the high bid is won by a third party.

{{Term| call }}
&lt;dd&gt; Any instance of a player having to say what they are about to do. For example, in [[straight pool]] a player must ''call'' the pocket in which a ball is intended to be potted.

Applies specifically to games that enforce "{{cuegloss|call-pocket}}/call-safe" rules, which require the player to either call the ball and pocket, or call a {{cuegloss|safety}} on every shot.  After a legal shot, where a called ball is not pocketed as designated, the incoming player has the option to pass the shot back to the player who missed the called shot.  If a player calls "safe", then after a legal shot, the incoming player must accept the next shot, and may not pass the shot back to the player who called "safe".&lt;ref name="ABC rulebook"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rulebook: Guidelines for American Rotation (AR)|url= http://AmericanBilliardClub.com/play/rulebook/ |work=AmericanBilliardClub.com  |publisher=American Billiard Club |first=Joe |last=Tucker|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A call-shot/call-safe [[nine-ball]] example: Player A calls the {{cuegloss|ball-on}}, the 3 ball in this case, in the corner pocket but misses the shot.

&lt;dd&gt; To aim at an object ball such that it will enter one side or the other, rather than the center, of a pocket. This permits the cue ball to strike the object ball at a different contact point than the most obvious one. Cheating the pocket is employed for {{gli|position play}}, to allow a ball to pass another partially obscuring the path to the pocket, and to prevent {{gli|scratch|scratches}} on dead-straight shots in cases where draw is not desirable (or may not be dependable, e.g. because of distance from the pocket or {{gli|smash-through}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Capelle|first=Philip B.|title=Play Your Best Pool|publisher=Billiards Press|year=1995|page=17|isbn=978-0-9649204-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| clearance }}
&lt;dd&gt; In [[snooker]] and British [[Pocket billiards|pool]], the successful {{gli|pot|potting}} of all object {{gli|ball-on|balls-on}} in a single {{gli|frame}}. A player is said to have "cleared up" or to have "cleared the table". Also, if a snooker player compiles a {{gli|break}} consisting of all 15 {{gli|red ball|reds}} with {{gli|colour ball|colours}}, then the colours in sequence, this is known as a "total clearance".  ''Compare {{gli|break and run}}.'' &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| cling }}
&lt;dd&gt; Phenomenon where two balls, (usually the {{gli|cue ball}} and an {{gli|object ball}}) have some foreign material (often residual {{gli|chalk}} or dirt picked up from unbrushed cloth) between them at the point of contact, resulting in the struck object ball being thrown offline from the expected trajectory, and often also affecting the post-impact path of the cue ball. A typical precaution against cling is to ask for the cue ball and/or object ball to be cleaned by the referee in order to remove chalk that is already on the ball prior to the shot. The table cloth should also be clean. However, no precaution can ward against cling resulting from chalk transferred from the cue tip to the cue ball during a single shot. Coincidental cling can therefore cause unpredictable play and occasionally lead to rudimentary shots being missed at even the highest levels of the game.&lt;ref name="BBC4304501"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/video_and_audio/help_guide/4304501.stm BBC Sport video] investigating the cause of {{gli|cling}} (a.k.a. {{gli|kick|kicks}} or {{gli|skid}}); retrieved 4 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  "Cling" (and derived words like "clung", "clinger", "clinging", etc.) may be used as a mass noun, less commonly as a count noun, as a verb, and rarely as an adjective ("cling is annoying", "two clings in one frame", "they clung", "unintentional cling shot", respectively).

{{Term| cloth }}
&lt;dd&gt; The [[baize]] cloth covering the tables playing surface and rails, usually made from wool or a wool-nylon blend. In use since the 15th century, cloth is traditionally green-colored, chosen for its evocation of grass. Sometimes cloth is improperly referred to as "felt." The properties of the cloth used to cover a table, as well as environmental conditions that can affect it—notably humidity, the degree it has been stretched when installed, and its level of cleanness—have a profound effect on play.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt;{{rp|53}} ''See also {{gli|fast}}.'' &lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dd&gt; ''Also '''combination shot''', '''combo'''.''
Any shot in which the cue ball contacts an object ball, which in turn hits one or more additional object balls (which in turn may hit yet further object balls) to send the last-hit object ball to an intended place, usually a pocket.&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt; In the UK this is often referred to as a {{gli|plant}}. &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| cradle cannon }}
&lt;dd&gt; A type of {{gli|nurse}} shot used in [[English billiards]] in which two coloured balls are positioned on either side of the mouth of a snooker table pocket but not touching and, thus placed, can be  successively contacted and scored off over and over by the cue ball without moving them. The cradle cannon's first known use was by Walter Lovejoy in 1907. The unofficial record using the shot is held by [[Tom Reece]] who in 1907, over the course of a month, scored 499,135 points using the cradle cannon before stopping without missing. This feat prompted the Billiards Association to outlaw the shot.

{{Term| draw }}
{{Defn|1= Also known as {{gli|back spin}}, a type of spin applied to the {{gli|cue ball}} by hitting it below its {{gli|equator}}, causing it to spin backwards even as it slides forward on the cloth.

There are several variant terms for this, including "bottom" and "bottom spin" in the US and "screw" in the UK.

{{Term| eight-ball |content=eight-ball {{anchor|eight-ball|eightball|eight ball}}}}
{{Defn|1= One of several games ultimately derived from a game called B.B.C. Company pool, promulgated by the [[Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company]] from around 1900 to the 1920s. They have in common the use of a {{gli|rack}} of fifteen {{gli|object ball|object balls}} and a single {{gli|cue ball}}, a hard {{gli|break}} from behind the {{gli|head string}} or {{gli|baulk line}}, and a goal of {{gli|pocket|pocketing}} ({{gli|pot|potting}}) all of one's own {{gli|suit}} of balls then finally the black 8 ball.  There are three general types of this game:
* [[eight-ball]], an originally American and now internationally standardized professional version, also subject to competitive team play in numerous leagues. It is the most-played form of competition pool in the world, though not for professionals, among whom [[nine-ball]] dominates.  Uses a set of {{gli|stripes|striped}} and {{gli|solids|solid}} numbered balls. Ball-and-pocket are {{gli|call pocket|called}} for each shot, with {{gli|foul|fouls}} ({{gli|fault|faults}}) resulting in {{gli|ball-in-hand|cue ball in-hand}} for the opponent, anywhere on the table.
* [[Blackball (pool)|blackball]] a.k.a. eightball pool, an originally British variant, also favoured in many Commonwealth countries, and parts of Continental Europe, with amateur and professional leagues.  The two names reflect slightly variant rulesets, which differ primarily in handling of {{gli|fault|faults}} ({{gli|foul|fouls}}). Shots are not {{gli|call shot|called}}. Uses a set of {{gli|yellows|yellow}} and {{gli|reds|red}} balls. {{gli|Pub pool}} usually consists of minor local variations on one of these two standardised rule sets.
* "straight eight" a.k.a. {{gli|bar pool}}, a widely divergent set of variations on standard eight-ball, and also using the stripes-and-solids ball set.  Usually requires a very strict version of {{gli|called-shot}} play, in which every aspect of a shot must be pre-specified, including {{gli|kiss|kisses}}, {{gli|carom|caroms}}, {{gli|kick|kicks}}, and {{gli|bank|banks}}, with loss of turn resulting from any deviation. Outright {{gli|foul|fouls}} ({{gli|fault|faults}}) result in {{gli|ball-in-hand|cue ball in-hand}} for the opponent, behind the {{gli|head string}} only. Rules may vary from venue to venue even within the same city.  These variants arose primarily to drag out the game on coin-operated tables ("{{gli|bar box|bar boxes}}").  In North America, many casual recreational players are unaware any other form of pool exists beyond bar pool.

{{Term| foul }}
{{Defn|1=
{{ghat|Sometimes interchangeable with {{gli|scratch}}, though the latter is often used only to refer to the foul of pocketing the cue ball.}}
A violation of a particular game's rules for which a set penalty is imposed. In many pool games the penalty for a foul is ball-in-hand anywhere on the table for the opponent. In some games such as straight pool, a foul results in a loss of one or more points. In one-pocket, in which a set number of balls must be made in a specific pocket, upon a foul the player must return a ball to the table. In some games, three successive fouls in a row is a loss of game. In straight pool, a third successive foul results in a loss of 16 points (15 plus one for the foul).&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt;

{{Defn|1= ''Also '''free shot'''.''
[[File:Snooker Freeball.png|thumb|right|200px|Freeball situation. Red is snookered, Blue can be called.]]
A situation where a player has {{gli|foul|fouled}}, leaving the opponent {{gli|snooker|snookered}}. In [[Eight-ball#UK|UK eight-ball]] this would normally give the opponent the option of one of two plays: (1) {{gli|ball-in-hand}} with {{gli|two shots}}; (2) being allowed to contact, or even {{gli|pot}}, a ball other than one from his/her set from the snookered position (although the black may not be potted), with the loss of the first shot.  In addition, some variations of the game allow the player to pot one of the opposition's balls, on the first visit only, without the loss of a "free shot".

In [[snooker]] it allows a player to call any ball as the ball she/he would have wanted to play, potting it for the same number of points, or the opponent can be put back in without the same privilege, having to play the ball snookered on. The definition of ''snooker'' on this occasion means the opponent cannot strike both extreme edges of the {{gli|object ball}} (or a cluster of touching balls).&lt;!-- Not sure this agrees with what is said at [[#two shots]] and [[#two-shot carry]]. --&gt; }}

For situations in which the {{gli|cue ball}} is frozen to an {{gli|object ball}}, different rule sets have different approaches. In some, the cue ball must be addressed with the [[Cue stick|cue]] at an angle at least 45 degrees divergent from an imaginary line running through the center of the balls, to minimize chances of a {{gli|push shot}}.

Any shot where the {{gli|cue ball}} is intentionally jumped into the air to clear an obstacle&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt; (usually an {{gli|object ball}}, even in games with non-ball objects, e.g. [[bottle pool]]). Jump shots must be performed by hitting the {{gli|cue ball}} into the table's surface so that it rebounds from the {{gli|cloth}}.

Some [[billiard hall]]s and even entire leagues prohibit all jump (and usually also {{gli|massé|{{lang|fr|massé|nocat=y}}}}) shots, out of fears of damage to the equipment, especially the cloth.  Specialized {{gli|jump cue|jump cues}} exist to better facilitate jump shots; they are usually shorter and lighter, and with harder tips, than normal cues.

{{Term| kitchen }}
{{Defn|1= The area on the table behind the {{gli|head string}}.&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt; The origin of the term has been the subject of some speculation but the best explanation known is that in the 1800s, many homes did not have room for both a billiard table and a dining room table. The solution was a billiards table that had a cover converting it into a dining table. Kept in the dining room, play on such a table was often restricted by the size of the room, so it would be placed so that the head rail would face the connected kitchen door, thus affording a player room for the backswing without hitting a wall.

{{Defn|1= Also '''the lag''' (as a noun) '''lagging''', '''lag for the break''' and '''lagging for the break'''. 
To determine the order of play, players (representing only themselves, or sometimes teams) each near simultaneously shoot a ball from the {{gli|kitchen}} (or in British games, from the {{gli|baulk line}}) to the {{gli|end rail}} and back toward the {{gli|bottom rail}}. Whichever shooter's ball comes to rest closest to the bottom rail gets to choose who {{gli|break|breaks}}.&lt;ref name="Shamos 1999"/&gt;{{Rp|139}} It is permissible but not required for the lagged ball to touch or rebound from the bottom rail, but not to touch the side rails. Lagging is usually a two-party activity, though there are games such as [[cutthroat (pool)|cutthroat]] in which three players might lag. In the case of a tie, the tying shooters re-lag. The lag is most often used in tournament play or other competitions.
In hard-break games like [[nine-ball]] and [[eight-ball]] the winner of the lag would normally take the break, while in soft-break games like [[straight pool]] would likely require the loser of the lag to break, since breaking would be a disadvantage.  ''See also {{gli|string-off}}.'' }}

{{Term| league }}
{{Defn|1= An organization that promotes competitive, usually team, amateur cue sports, most commonly [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]], especially [[eight-ball]] and [[nine-ball]], although there are also well-established [[snooker league]]s.  Some leagues, many of which are decades old, are entirely local and either informal or [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]], and may use their own local rules or may have adopted more widely published rulesets, such as those of the [[World Pool-Billiard Association|WPA]].  Other leagues are organized on a multi-regional or even international level, and may be non-profit or for-profit enterprises, usually with their own fine-tuned rule books. Despite differences, the largest leagues are increasingly converging toward the WPA rules, with the exception of the [[American Poolplayers Association|APA/CPA]], which retains rules much closer to [[United States|US]]-style {{gli|bar pool}}.  At least four major pool leagues hold international championships in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] annually (APA/CPA, [[Billiard Congress of America|BCAPL]], [[Valley National 8-Ball League Association|VNEA]] and [[American CueSports Alliance|ACS/CCS]]).

A legal ''shot'' is one in which no foul of any kind was involved (e.g. there was not a {{gli|double hit}} by the cue, the player's {{gli|bridge}} hand did not move a ball, etc.).  A legal ''stroke'' is one in which the [[Cue stick|cue]] {{gli|stroke}} obeyed the rules (e.g. the shooter did not perform an illegal {{gli|jump shot}} by scooping under the cue ball with the cue {{gli|cue tip|tip}}).

{{Term| miss }}
{{Defn|1= In [[snooker]], a shot where a player {{gli|foul|fouls}} by missing the ball on altogether.

A miss usually occurs when a player makes an unsuccessful attempt at escaping from a snooker. It is a controversial rule aimed at formally discouraging {{gli|deliberate foul|deliberate fouls}}. In professional snooker, a referee will almost always call a miss on any foul where the player misses the ball on altogether, regardless of how close the player comes to hitting it. If a player is called for a miss three times in a single visit while not snookered, he forfeits the frame; to avoid this, players almost always play an easy hit on their third attempt, even if it is likely to leave a chance for the opponent. }}

In carom games such as [[Balkline and straight rail|straight rail]], [[Balkline and straight rail|balkline]] and [[cushion caroms]], where all the balls are kept near each other and a cushion, and with very soft shots, can be "nursed" down a rail on multiple successful shots that effectively replicate the same ball setup so that the nurse shot can be repeated again (and again, etc.).

Excessive use of nurse shots by players skilled enough to set them up and pull them off repeatedly at will is what led to the development of the [[Balkline and straight rail|balkline]] [[carom billiards]] game variations, and repetitive shot limitation rules in [[English billiards]].

{{Defn|1= {{ghat|Also '''pro side of the pocket'''; sometimes "of the pocket" is left off the phrase.}}
The {{gli|long rail|long-rail}} side of a {{gli|corner pocket}}.  To "aim for the profession side of the pocket" is to slightly {{gli|overcut}} a difficult corner-pocket {{cuegloss|cut shot}}, to {{cuegloss|cheat the pocket}}, rather than {{gli|undercut|undercutting}}, especially in [[nine-ball]]. Erring too much in this direction is "missing on the professional side of the pocket."  It is so called because experienced players understand that on a thin cut, overcutting the object ball to a corner pocket will far more often leave the object ball in an unfavorable position, i.e. along the {{gli|short rail}} for the incoming opponent than will an undercut, which often leaves the object ball sitting in front of or nearby the pocket it had been intended for on a miss.&lt;ref&gt;[[ESPN]] broadcast of 2007 WPBA Great Lakes Classic, second semi-final.

By contrast, in [[eight-ball]], except when both players are shooting at the {{cuegloss|8 ball}}, the incoming player after a miss is shooting for different object balls, so this maxim does not apply, and the opposite may be good strategy as, if the object ball stays near the pocket through an undercut, it is advantageously positioned for a subsequent turn and may block the opponent's use of the pocket.&lt;ref name="RGivens"/&gt;}}

{{Defn|1= ''As an adjective or compound noun: '''push-out'''.''
A rule in many games (most notably [[nine-ball]], after and only after the break shot), allowing a player to "push out" the cue ball to a new position without having to contact any ball, much less pocket one or drive it to a {{gli|cushion}}, but not counting any pocketed ball as valid (other foul rules apply, such as {{gli|double hit|double hits}}, {{gli|scratch|scratching}} the cue ball, etc.), with the caveat that the opponent may shoot from the new cue ball position or give the shot back to the pusher who must shoot from the new position.  In nine-ball particularly, and derived games such as [[seven-ball]] and [[ten-ball]], pocketing the {{gli|money ball}} on a push-out results in that ball being {{gli|spot (verb)|respotted}} (which can be used to strategic advantage in certain circumstances, such as when the break leaves no shot on the {{gli|ball-on}}, and failure to hit it would give the incoming player an instant-win {{gli|combination|combination shot}} on the money ball).{{Clarify|date=January 2009}}&lt;!--If in nine-ball I pocket the 5 ball on a push-out, does it also get respotted, in Intl.

{{Defn|1= The three-foul rule describes a situation in which a player is assessed a defined penalty after committing a third successive foul. The exact penalty, its prerequisites and whether it is in place at all, vary depending on the games. In [[nine-ball]] and [[straight pool]], a player must be the told he is on two fouls in order to transgress the rule, and if violated, results in a loss of game for the former and a special point penalty of a loss of fifteen points (plus one for the foul itself) in the latter together with the ability to require the violator to rerack and rebreak. In [[Irish standard pool]] and [[English billiards]], it is a loss of game if a player commits a third foul while shooting at {{gli|black ball|the black}}. In [[snooker]], three successive fouls from a non-{{gli|snooker|snookered}} position result in forfeiting the frame.

{{Defn|1= This technique involves all three balls being grouped in close proximity at the top end of the table and scoring with a succession of short range pots and cannons.  A typical starting point is with the red placed on its spot, object white on or near the centreline somewhere between the spot and the top cushion, and the cueball posed nearby to pot the red or make a gentle cannon.  If the pot, then it should be played so as to leave the cueball in a good position for the next shot.  If the cannon, then the purpose is to disturb the object white as little as possible and finish clear to pot the red which has been left near the corner pocket.  Then in potting the red the cueball must again be left in a good position for the next shot, and so on.  This form of play makes it possible to compile really big breaks in relatively short time. }}

The {{gli|maximum break}} is 147 (barring a foul by the opponent immediately before the break began). }}

{{Term| total snooker }}
{{Defn|1= In [[Blackball (pool)|blackball]],&lt;ref name="WEPFRules"/&gt; a situation where the player cannot {{gli|see}} any of the balls she/he wants to hit due to obstruction by other balls or the {{gli|knuckle}} of a {{gli|pocket}}. The player must {{gli|call}} "total snooker" to the {{gli|referee}}, which allows a dispensation to the player from having to hit a {{gli|cushion}} after contacting the {{gli|object ball}}, which is otherwise a {{gli|foul}}. }}

{{Term| touching ball }}
{{Defn|1= [[File:Snooker Touching Ball Red.png|thumb|right|Touching ball with red ball]]
In [[snooker]], the situation in which the {{gli|cue ball}} is resting in contact with an {{gli|object ball}}. If the object ball is a ball that may legally be hit, then it is allowable to simply hit away from it and it counts as having hit it in the shot. If that ball moves, then a {{gli|push shot}} must have occurred, in which case it is a {{gli|foul}}. This rule is sometimes applies to British [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]] as well as snooker.  In American-style pool, and in [[carom billiards]], a less stringent definition of a push shot applies; ''see {{gli|frozen}}.''}}

{{Term| training template }}
{{Defn|1= [[File:Training template.png|thumb|right|Training template]]
A thin sheet of rigid material in the size and shape of a [[Rack (billiards)|physical ball rack]] (e.g. a {{gli|diamond}} for [[nine-ball]]), with holes drilled though it, which is used to make permanent {{gli|divot|divots}} in the [[Baize|cloth]] of the [[Billiard table|table]], one at a time for each [[Billiard ball|ball]] in the {{gli|rack|racking}} pattern, by placing a ball in one of the holes in the carefully placed template and tapping it sharply from above to create the cloth indentation.  The holes are spaced slightly closer than the regulation ball width of 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;inch (57.15&amp;nbsp;mm) apart, so that when the balls settle partially into their divots, the outer sides of these indentations create ball-on-ball pressure, pushing the balls together tightly.  The purpose of the template is to do away with using a physical rack, with racking instead being performed simply by placing the balls into position, and the divots aligning them into the tightest possible formation automatically. This prevents accidental loose racks, and also thwarts the possibility of cheating by carefully manipulating the ball positions while racking. The [[European Pocket Billiard Federation]] (EPBF, Europe's [[World Pool-Billiard Association|WPA]] affiliate organization) has adopted this racking technique for its professional Euro-Tour event series.&lt;ref name="Varner BD 2008-02"&gt;{{BDMag|first=Nick|last=Varner|date=February 2008|title=Killing Me Softly?: The Outbreak of the Soft Break Threatens the Game of 9-ball|volume=30|issue=3|pages= 34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also {{gli|racking template}}, {{gli|pocket template}}.'' }}

{{Term| umbrella shot }}
{{Defn|1= A [[three cushion billiards]] shot in which the cue ball first strikes two cushions before hitting the first object ball then hits a third cushion before hitting the second object ball.

==Plot==
&lt;!--per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be kept between 400 to 700 words! --&gt;
In 1988, following his mother's death, a young [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill]] is abducted from Earth by the Ravagers, a group of space pirates led by [[Yondu|Yondu Udonta]]. Twenty-six years later on the planet Morag, Quill steals a mysterious orb but is attacked by [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]], a subordinate to the fanatical [[Kree]], [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]]. Although Quill escapes with the orb, Yondu discovers his theft and issues a bounty for his capture, while Ronan sends the assassin [[Gamora]] after the orb.

When Quill attempts to sell the orb on [[Xandar]], capital of the Nova Empire, Gamora ambushes him and steals it. A fight ensues, drawing in a pair of bounty hunters: the genetically and cybernetically modified raccoon [[Rocket Raccoon|Rocket]], and the tree-like humanoid [[Groot]]. [[Nova Corps]] officers capture the four, detaining them in the Kyln prison. A powerful inmate there, [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]], attempts to kill Gamora due to her association with Ronan and [[Thanos]], who killed his family. Quill convinces Drax that Gamora can bring Ronan to him, though Gamora reveals that she has betrayed Ronan, unwilling to let him use the orb's power. Learning that Gamora has a buyer for the orb, Quill, Rocket, Groot, and Drax work with her to escape the Kyln in Quill's ship, the ''Milano''.

Ronan meets with Gamora's adoptive father, Thanos, to discuss her betrayal. Quill's group flee to [[Knowhere]], a remote criminal outpost in space built in the giant severed head of a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]]. A drunken Drax summons Ronan while the rest of the group meet Gamora's contact, the collector [[Collector (comics)|Taneleer Tivan]]. Tivan opens the orb, revealing an [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stone]], an item of immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings who wield it. Tivan's slave Carina grabs the Stone, triggering an explosion that engulfs Tivan's archive.

Ronan arrives and easily defeats Drax, while the others flee by ship, pursued by Ronan's followers and Gamora's adoptive sister [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]]. Nebula destroys Gamora's ship, leaving her floating in space, and Ronan's fighters capture the orb. Quill contacts Yondu before following Gamora into space, giving her his helmet to survive; Yondu arrives and retrieves the pair. Rocket, Drax, and Groot threaten to attack Yondu's ship to rescue them, but Quill negotiates a truce, promising the orb to Yondu. Quill's group agrees that facing Ronan means certain death, but that they cannot let him use the Infinity Stone to destroy the galaxy. On Ronan's flagship, the ''Dark Aster'', Ronan embeds the Stone in his warhammer, taking its power for himself. He contacts Thanos, threatening to kill him after first destroying Xandar; hateful of her adoptive father, Nebula allies with Ronan.

The Ravagers and Quill's group join with the Nova Corps to confront the ''Dark Aster'' at Xandar, with Quill's group breaching the ''Dark Aster'' with the ''Milano''. Ronan uses his empowered warhammer to destroy the Nova Corps fleet. Drax and Gamora defeat Korath and Nebula, the latter escaping, but the group find themselves outmatched by Ronan's power until Rocket crashes a Ravager ship through the ''Dark Aster''. The damaged ''Dark Aster'' crash-lands on Xandar, with Groot sacrificing himself to shield the group. Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar, but Quill distracts him, allowing Drax and Rocket to destroy Ronan's warhammer. Quill grabs the freed Stone, and with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket sharing its burden, they use it to destroy Ronan.

In the aftermath, Quill tricks Yondu into taking a container supposedly containing the Stone, and gives the real Stone to the Nova Corps. As the Ravagers leave Xandar, Yondu remarks that it turned out well that they did not deliver Quill to his father per their contract. Quill's group, now known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, have their criminal records expunged, and Quill learns that he is only half-human, his father being part of an ancient, unknown species. Quill finally opens the last present he received from his mother: a cassette tape filled with her favorite songs. The Guardians leave in the rebuilt ''Milano'' along with a sapling [[Cutting (plant)|cut]] from Groot.

In a [[post-credits scene]], Tivan sits in his destroyed archive with two of his living exhibits: a canine cosmonaut and an anthropomorphic duck.{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|Identified offscreen as [[Cosmo the Spacedog]] and [[Howard the Duck]].&lt;ref name="StitchKingdom2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt;}}

* [[Chris Pratt]] as [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill / Star-Lord]]: {{Cast list break|The half-human, half-alien&lt;ref name="SuperheroHypePg1" /&gt; leader of the Guardians who was abducted from [[Missouri]] as a child in 1988 and raised by a group of alien thieves and smugglers called the Ravagers.&lt;ref name="StitchKingdom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USATodayFeb2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SlashFilmApr2014" /&gt; About the character, Pratt said, "He had a hard time as a kid, and now he goes around space, making out with hot alien girls and just being a rogue and a bit of a jerk, and through teaming up with these guys, finds a higher purpose for himself."&lt;ref name="LATimes" /&gt; He also added that the character is a mix of [[Han Solo]] and [[Marty McFly]].&lt;ref name="SuperheroHypePg1" /&gt; Pratt, who was mostly known for playing supporting characters, including [[Andy Dwyer]] on the television series ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'', initially turned down the role. Pratt had lost weight to portray fit characters in films such as ''[[Moneyball (film)|Moneyball]]'' and ''[[Zero Dark Thirty]]'', and had given up ambitions to play the lead role in action films after humbling auditions for ''[[Star Trek (2009 film)|Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Avatar (2009)|Avatar]]''. Casting director Sarah Finn suggested Pratt to Gunn, who dismissed the idea despite struggling to cast that role. Despite this, Finn arranged for a meeting between the two, at which point Gunn was immediately convinced that Pratt was perfect for the role. Pratt also won over Feige, despite having gained weight again for ''[[Delivery Man (film)|Delivery Man]]''.&lt;ref name="EWJuly2014" /&gt; Prior to filming, Pratt underwent a strict diet and training regimen to lose {{convert|60|lb}} in six months.&lt;ref name="PrattWeight" /&gt; Pratt signed a multi-film contract with Marvel,&lt;ref name="HuffingtonPostNov2013" /&gt; and was granted a temporary leave from his work on ''Parks and Recreation'' in order to accommodate his participation in the film.&lt;ref name="ParksandRec" /&gt; [[Wyatt Oleff]] portrays a young Quill.&lt;ref name="TimeReview" /&gt;}}
* [[Zoe Saldana]] as [[Gamora]]: {{Cast list break|An orphan from an alien world who seeks redemption for her past crimes. She was trained by [[Thanos]] to be his personal [[assassin]].&lt;ref name="StitchKingdom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AICN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Empire" /&gt; Saldana said that she became Gamora through make-up rather than [[computer-generated imagery|computer generated imagery (CGI)]] or [[Motion capture|performance capture]].&lt;ref name="2013MaySaldana" /&gt; On taking the role, Saldana said, "I was just excited to be asked to join by James Gunn and to also play someone green. I've been blue before [in ''Avatar'']."&lt;ref name="2013MayMTV" /&gt; Saldana described Gamora as "... a warrior, she's an assassin and she's very lethal but what saves her is the same thing that can doom her. She has a sense of righteousness. She's a very righteous individual."&lt;ref name="SuperheroHypePg1" /&gt;}}
* [[Dave Bautista]] as [[Drax the Destroyer]]: {{Cast list break|A warrior who seeks to avenge his family's death at the hands of Ronan.&lt;ref name="AICN" /&gt; On relating to the character, Bautista said, "I can just relate to Drax so much it's not even funny. Just the simple things that we have in common. Simple things like the tattoos, the tragedy—because, you know, I had a bit of tragedy in my life as well. So it's really easy for me to pull from that." Bautista also said that there was "a lot of comic relief to Drax", but the character was not aware of it. Bautista stated that he did not do much preparation for the role, because "Luckily, for me, I'm a lifelong athlete and I adapted real quick."&lt;ref name="2014Bautista" /&gt; Bautista's makeup took approximately four hours to apply, though it could be removed in just 90 minutes.&lt;ref name="ColliderMay2014" /&gt; Drax has various scarring patterns on his body, which replace the simple tattoos from the comics, each having a specific story. Additionally, his skin tone was changed from the bright green in the comics to a muddier grey, to avoid visual similarities to the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].&lt;ref name="CBRSetVisit" /&gt;}}
* [[Vin Diesel]] as [[Groot]]: {{Cast list break|A tree-like humanoid&lt;ref name="MarvelSynopsis" /&gt; who is the accomplice of Rocket. Diesel stated that he provided the voice and [[motion capture]] for Groot, after originally being in talks to star in a new Phase Three Marvel film.&lt;ref name="DieselTHR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DieselDeadline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DieselConfirm" /&gt; Diesel also provided Groot's voice for several foreign-language releases of the film.&lt;ref name="DieselForeignVoices" /&gt; Krystian Godlewski portrayed the character on set, though his acting was not used in the final character CGI.&lt;ref name="SeanGunnThanos" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RocketGrootBI" /&gt; On the character, which Gunn based on his dog,&lt;ref name="RocketGrootInfluence" /&gt; Gunn said, "All the Guardians start out the movie as bastards—except Groot. He's an innocent. He's a hundred percent deadly and a hundred percent sweet. He's caught up in Rocket's life, really." Gunn added that the design and movement of Groot took "the better part of a year" to create.&lt;ref name="TotalFilmTrailer3" /&gt; Gunn added, "The ways in which Vin Diesel says, 'I am Groot,' I am astounded. All of the 'I am Groots' that were earlier voices didn't sound very good at all ... Vin came in and in one day, laid down all these 'I am Groot' tracks, and he's a perfectionist. He made me explain to him with ever {{sic}} 'I am Groot,' exactly what he was saying ... It was amazing when we first put that voice in there how much the character changed and how much he influenced the character."&lt;ref name="GunnIGNFeb2014" /&gt; Regarding the limited words used by Groot, Diesel said in many ways this was, "... the most challenging thing to ask an actor to do."&lt;ref name="TheMovieNetwork"/&gt; Diesel found an emotional note in his performance, invoking the death of his friend and ''[[The Fast and the Furious|Fast and Furious]]'' co-star [[Paul Walker]], saying, "This was in December [2013], and the first time I came back to dealing with human beings after dealing with death, so playing a character who celebrates life in the way Groot does was very nice."&lt;ref name="DieselGrootDeath" /&gt; Groot's form and size-changing abilities are seen, with Gunn stating that he has the ability to grow in the film.&lt;ref name="SuperheroHypePg2" /&gt;}}
* [[Bradley Cooper]] as [[Rocket Raccoon|Rocket&lt;!-- CREDITED ONLY AS "Rocket" PER OFFICIAL SYNOPSIS! --&gt;]]: {{Cast list break|A genetically engineered [[raccoon]]-like bounty hunter and mercenary who is a master of weapons and battle tactics.&lt;ref name="StitchKingdom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MarvelSynopsis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CooperOfficial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; Gunn worked with live raccoons to get the correct feel for the character, and to make sure it was "not a cartoon character", saying, "It's not [[Bugs Bunny]] in the middle of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], it's a real, little, somewhat mangled beast that's alone. There's no one else in the universe quite like him, he's been created by these guys to be a mean-ass fighting machine."&lt;ref name="GunnRocket" /&gt; Gunn also based the character on himself.&lt;ref name="RocketGrootInfluence" /&gt; Describing Rocket in relation to the rest of the Guardians, Cooper said, "I think Rocket is dynamic. He's the sort of [[Joe Pesci]] in ''[[Goodfellas]]'' guy."&lt;ref name="Cooper2" /&gt; Cooper voiced Rocket, while [[Sean Gunn]] (James' younger brother) stood in for the character during filming.&lt;ref name="RocketStandIn" /&gt; James Gunn said that for the role of Rocket, some physical movement from Cooper, including facial expressions and hand movements, was recorded as potential reference for the animators,&lt;ref name="2013NovDelToro" /&gt; though much of Sean Gunn's acting is used throughout the film.&lt;ref name="SeanGunnThanos" /&gt; Sean noted they "kind of stumbled" into the process of him performing on set since they "weren't sure how we were going to create that character". The same process would continue to be used for all subsequent appearances of Rocket.&lt;ref name="SeanGunnSept2018" /&gt; Before Cooper was cast, James Gunn said that it was a challenge finding a voice for Rocket, that he was looking for someone that could balance "the fast-talking speech patterns that Rocket has, but also can be funny, because he is really funny. But also has the heart that Rocket has. Because there are actually some pretty dramatic scenes with Rocket."&lt;ref name="IGNRocketJun2014" /&gt;}}
* [[Lee Pace]] as [[Ronan the Accuser]]: {{Cast list break|A [[Kree]] radical who agrees to retrieve an artifact for Thanos in exchange for eradicating his mortal enemies, the Xandarians. Ronan and his [[Planet Hulk|Sakaaran]] army&lt;ref name="SuperheroHypePg3" /&gt; hunt down the Guardians when they interfere with his goals.&lt;ref name="StitchKingdom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AMCYoutube" /&gt; Describing Ronan, Gunn said, "He is the primary villain, and he is a really twisted guy, he has a really religious bent in this film. He has a very sick and twisted view of what morality is; strength is virtue and weakness is sin and that is what he lives by, and I think he is very scary because of his beliefs, which are real to him."&lt;ref name="DigitalSpy" /&gt; Pace, who originally auditioned for Peter Quill,&lt;ref name="2012DecPace" /&gt; described Ronan as a "psycho" and a "monster".&lt;ref name="PaceOctober2013" /&gt;}}
* [[Michael Rooker]] as [[Yondu|Yondu Udonta]]: {{Cast list break|A blue-skinned bandit who is the leader of the Ravagers and a paternal figure to Quill.&lt;ref name="StitchKingdom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2013AprilRooker" /&gt; Yondu helps Quill to steal the orb before Quill betrays him, leaving Yondu and the Ravagers to chase the Guardians. On the character, Rooker said, he has "some interesting issues—not a good guy, not a bad guy. There's hope and there's a heart inside Yondu." Gunn created the film's version of the character specifically with Rooker in mind, while borrowing the character's mohawk and use of a whistle-controlled arrow from the comics. Rooker fully committed to the role once he knew his role on the TV series ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' would be ending.&lt;ref name="RookerUSAToday" /&gt; Rooker's makeup took approximately four hours to apply.&lt;ref name="RookerMakeup" /&gt;}}
* [[Karen Gillan]] as [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]]: {{Cast list break|An adopted daughter of Thanos who was raised with Gamora as siblings and is a loyal lieutenant in the employ of Ronan and Thanos.&lt;ref name="StitchKingdom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SlashFilmApr2014" /&gt; About the character, Gillan said, "She is the female villain of the film ... She is very sadistic and evil, but I like to think for a very valid reason."&lt;ref name="2013NovGillan" /&gt; She also added, "I think she's a really interesting character. What I like to play around with is how jealous she is. She's Gamora's sister, and there's a lot of [[sibling rivalry]]. That's the most interesting aspect to me, because jealousy can consume you and turn you bitter, and ugly. And she's a total sadist, so that's fun too."&lt;ref name="GillanCBR" /&gt; Gillan researched the ancient [[Sparta]]ns, shaved off her hair, and trained for two months for the role.&lt;ref name="GillanCBR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2013JulyComicCon" /&gt; The character's makeup took approximately four-and-a-half hours to be applied.&lt;ref name="GillanCBR" /&gt;}}
* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]]: {{Cast list break|A Kree&lt;ref name="SuperheroHypePg3" /&gt; ally of Ronan who is a feared intergalactic hunter.&lt;ref name="StitchKingdom" /&gt; As to why he took the role Hounsou said, "I have a four-year old son who loves superheroes from [[Spider-Man]] to [[Iron Man]] to [[Batman]]. He's got all the costumes. One day he looks at me and says 'Dad, I want to be light-skinned so I could be Spider-Man. Spider-Man has light skin.' That was sort of a shock. This is why I am excited to be a part of the Marvel Universe, so I could hopefully provide that diversity in the role of the superhero."&lt;ref name="2013JulyHounsou" /&gt;}}
* [[John C. Reilly]] as [[Rhomann Dey]]: A corpsman in the [[Nova Corps]], the Nova Empire's military and police force.&lt;ref name="StitchKingdom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2013JuneReilly" /&gt;
* [[Glenn Close]] as [[Irani Rael]]: {{Cast list break|The leader of the Nova Corps, known as Nova Prime, whose mission is to protect the citizens of the Nova Empire and keep peace.&lt;ref name="StitchKingdom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2013JulyMarvel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2013MayClose" /&gt; Close stated that she "had always wanted to be in a movie like [''Guardians of the Galaxy''], and that it would be "the most fun to play something like the [[Judi Dench]] [as [[M (James Bond)|M]] or] [[Samuel L. Jackson]] [as [[Nick Fury]]] role".&lt;ref name="VultureClose" /&gt; She said that she took the role because she "love[s] to do stuff that's different" and wanted to show that she "[has] always been up for anything."&lt;ref name="USAClose" /&gt; She also stated that her contract has "several" films on it, and that she would be open to working on other Marvel Studios films in addition to returning for ''Guardians'' sequels.&lt;ref name="VultureClose" /&gt;}}
* [[Benicio del Toro]] as [[Collector (comics)|Taneleer Tivan / The Collector]]: {{Cast list break|An obsessive keeper of the largest collection of interstellar fauna, relics, and species in the galaxy who operates out of a place in space named [[Knowhere]].&lt;ref name="StitchKingdom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2013JulyMarvel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2013MayDelToro" /&gt; Describing del Toro's performance, Gunn said, "He's like an outer-space [[Liberace]]. That's what it says in the script, which he's kind of doing."&lt;ref name="2013NovDelToro" /&gt; On bringing the character to life, del Toro said, "What James [Gunn] wanted, that I found out little by little as I was doing it, is that he wanted me to explore and just keep pushing the character and keep creating [him] as I was in front of the camera."&lt;ref name="2014JulDelToro" /&gt;}}

[[Marvel Studios]] President [[Kevin Feige]] first mentioned ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' as a potential film at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], stating, "There are some obscure titles, too, like ''Guardians of the Galaxy''. I think they've been revamped recently in a fun way in the [comic] book."&lt;ref name="2010SDCCFeige" /&gt; Feige reiterated that sentiment in a September 2011 issue of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', saying, "There's an opportunity to do a big space epic, which ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' sort of hints at, in the cosmic side" of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. Feige added, should the film be made, it would feature an ensemble of characters, similar to ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'' and ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.&lt;ref name="2011SeptEW" /&gt;

Feige announced that the film was in active development at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International during the Marvel Studios panel, with an intended release date of August 1, 2014. He stated that the film's titular team would consist of the characters [[Star-Lord]], [[Drax the Destroyer]], [[Gamora]], [[Groot]], and [[Rocket Raccoon]].&lt;ref name="2012SDCCPanel" /&gt; Two pieces of concept art were also displayed, one of Rocket Raccoon, and one featuring the entire team.&lt;ref name="2012SDCCArt" /&gt; In August 2012, [[James Gunn]] entered talks to direct the film, beating out other contenders, including [[Peyton Reed]] and the duo [[Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck]].&lt;ref name="2012AugGunn" /&gt; ''The Avengers'' director [[Joss Whedon]], who signed a deal to creatively consult on all of the films leading up to [[Avengers: Age of Ultron|''The Avengers'' sequel]],&lt;ref name="2012AugWhedon" /&gt; was enthusiastic about the selection of Gunn to direct, saying "James [Gunn] is what makes me think it will work ... He is so off the wall, and so crazy, but so smart, such a craftsman and he builds from his heart. He loves the raccoon. Needs the raccoon ... He has a very twisted take on it, but it all comes from a real love for the material. It's going to be hard for [the human characters] to keep up."&lt;ref name="2012SepWhedon" /&gt;

====Writing====
[[Nicole Perlman]], who was enrolled in Marvel's screenwriting program in 2009,&lt;ref name="Screenplay" /&gt; was offered several of their lesser known properties to base a screenplay on.&lt;ref name="Perlman3" /&gt; Out of those, Perlman chose [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Andy Lanning]]'s ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', due to her interest in space and science fiction,&lt;ref name="Perlman3" /&gt; adding, "I think [Marvel] were a little taken aback when I chose ''Guardians'', because there were ones that would make a lot more sense if you were a romantic-comedy writer or something like that." Perlman spent two years writing a draft, immersing herself in the ''Guardians'' universe, and was asked in late 2011 to create another draft, before Gunn was brought in&lt;!--not a mistake--&gt; in early 2012 to contribute to the script.&lt;ref name="Perlman" /&gt; Gunn eventually rewrote the script entirely because "it didn't work" for him; he would use the film ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' as a reference to convey his ideas of the film to Marvel.&lt;ref name="2014JulGunn" /&gt; Gunn later explained that Perlman's draft was very different from the script he used during filming, including a different story, character arcs and no [[Walkman]]; he stated, "In Nicole's script everything is pretty different ... it's not about the same stuff. But that's how the [[Writers Guild of America, West|WGA]] works. They like first writers an awful lot."&lt;ref name="GunnFilmDivider" /&gt; In August 2012, Marvel Studios hired writer Chris McCoy to rewrite Perlman's script,&lt;ref name="2012AugMcCoy" /&gt; however, it is unclear what contribution he had to the final script, since he did not receive production credit.&lt;ref name="2013JulyMarvel" /&gt;

Gunn revealed that character introductions were the "hardest scenes to crack", with [[Thanos]]' introduction being the most difficult. He felt that "having Thanos be in that scene was more helpful to the [MCU] than it was to ''Guardians of the Galaxy''," yet he still wanted Thanos in the film, without "[belittling] the actual antagonist of the film, which is Ronan." To solve his dilemma, Gunn chose to have Ronan kill "The Other", Thanos' vizier, saying, "I thought that was interesting, because we've had the Other, who's obviously very powerful even in comparison to [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]], and then we see Ronan wipe his ass with him. So that I liked, but even that was sort of difficult, because it played as funnier when I first wrote it, and the humor didn't work so much."&lt;ref name="GunnVultureThanos" /&gt;

===Pre-production===
In September 2012, Gunn confirmed that he had signed on to direct the film and rewrite the script.&lt;ref name="2012SepGunn" /&gt; By the end of November, [[Joel Edgerton]], [[Jack Huston]], [[Jim Sturgess]], and [[Eddie Redmayne]] signed deals to test for the role of [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill]], as did [[Lee Pace]],&lt;ref name="2012NovTestDeals" /&gt; which he confirmed a week later in early December.&lt;ref name="2012DecPace" /&gt; Other actors who were considered for the role included ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''{{'}}s [[Zachary Levi]],&lt;ref name="2012Dec21Quill" /&gt; [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]],&lt;ref name="2013JanJGL" /&gt; [[Michael Rosenbaum]],&lt;ref name="2013JanRosenbaum" /&gt; and [[John Gallagher Jr.]]&lt;ref name="GallagherStarLord" /&gt; [[Chris Pratt]] was cast in the role in February 2013, as part of a multi-film deal that he signed with Marvel.&lt;ref name="HuffingtonPostNov2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2013FebPratt" /&gt;

[[File:James Gunn by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Gunn promoting the film at 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]]]
In January 2013, filming was scheduled to take place at [[Shepperton Studios]] in London, United Kingdom,&lt;ref name="2013JanShepperton" /&gt; and Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released in [[3D film|3D]].&lt;ref name="2013Jan3D" /&gt; Victoria Alonso, an executive producer on the film, said that filming would begin in June. She also said that both Rocket Raccoon and Groot would be created through a combination of CGI and motion capture, going on to say that "You can't do any motion capture with a raccoon—they won't let you put the suit on. But we will do [[rotoscoping|rotomation]], probably, for some of the behavior ... we definitely will have performers to emulate what James Gunn will lead to be, the behavior and the performance. He's very clear on where he wants to take the characters."&lt;ref name="2013FebAlonso" /&gt; In March 2013, Feige discussed ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' in relation to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, "It's much more of a [[Sequel#Stand-alone sequels|standalone]] film. It takes place in the same universe. And when we've been on the other side of that universe in other movies, you might see those characteristics in Guardians, but the Avengers are not involved with what's happening out there at this time." Feige also stated that 95% of the film would take place in space.&lt;ref name="2013MarchSFX" /&gt; In mid-March, [[Dave Bautista]] was signed to play [[Drax the Destroyer]].&lt;ref name="2013MarchBautista" /&gt; Other actors who had been considered for the role included [[Isaiah Mustafa]], [[Brian Patrick Wade]], and [[Jason Momoa]].&lt;ref name="2013MarchBautista" /&gt; By the following week, sculptor [[Brian Muir (sculptor)|Brian Muir]], who sculpted [[Darth Vader]]'s mask for the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, was revealed to be working on the film.&lt;ref name="2013MarchMuir" /&gt;

In early April 2013, [[Zoe Saldana]] entered into negotiations to star as [[Gamora]] in the film, and it was confirmed she had been cast later that month.&lt;ref name="2013AprilLovibond" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2013AprilSaldana" /&gt; Also in April, [[Michael Rooker]] joined the film's cast as [[Yondu]],&lt;ref name="2013AprilRooker" /&gt; and it was announced that [[Ophelia Lovibond]] had been cast in a supporting role.&lt;ref name="2013AprilLovibond" /&gt; By this point in time, [[Lee Pace]] was in final negotiations to play the villain of the film.&lt;ref name="2013AprilPace" /&gt; In May, Marvel offered [[John C. Reilly]] the role of [[Rhomann Dey]].&lt;ref name="2013MayHitFix" /&gt; At the same time, it was disclosed that filmmakers were looking at actors including [[Hugh Laurie]], [[Alan Rickman]], and [[Ken Watanabe]], for another role, and that [[Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely]] were providing finishing touches to the script.&lt;ref name="2013MayHitFix" /&gt; A few days later, [[Glenn Close]] was cast as the head of the [[Nova Corps]] in the film,&lt;ref name="2013MayClose" /&gt; followed shortly by the casting of [[Karen Gillan]] as the film's lead female villain.&lt;ref name="2013MayGillan" /&gt; By June 2013, [[Benicio del Toro]] was cast in the film, as part of a multi-film deal with Marvel Studios.&lt;ref name="2013MayDelToro" /&gt; Later in the month, it was confirmed that Reilly had been cast as Rhomann Dey.&lt;ref name="2013JuneReilly" /&gt;

Special effects makeup designer David White took head and body casts of actors, such as Bautista, to experiment with materials used to create the characters. White said, "James always pushed for practical and makeup effects. He wanted, like me, to see the real deal there on set." White was careful not to use "modern" creature designs to ensure they did not fall short in Gunn's uniquely envisioned world. White and his team created upwards of 1,000 prosthetic makeup applications and 2,000 molds of different-colored aliens.&lt;ref name="WhiteMakeup" /&gt; For the specific aesthetic look to the film, Gunn wanted to create "a colorful science-fiction world", and include elements of 1950s and '60s pulp movies, citing the Ravagers' spaceships, which he compared to muscle cars, as an example of the latter.&lt;ref name="GunnDesign" /&gt; Science fiction artist [[Chris Foss]] inspired and helped design the final look of some of the spacecrafts that appear in the film.&lt;ref name="ChrisFoss" /&gt; The ''[[Mass Effect]]'' video game series, [[Flash Gordon]], ''[[Farscape]]'', and ''[[Star Wars]]'' were primary inspirations for Gunn on the film.&lt;ref name="GunnInspirations" /&gt;

===Filming===
Principal photography began around July 6, 2013 in [[London]], United Kingdom,&lt;ref name="2013JulyComicCon" /&gt; under the working title of ''Full Tilt''.&lt;ref name="SuperheroHypePg1" /&gt; Filming took place at Shepperton Studios and [[Longcross Studios]].&lt;ref name="2013JanShepperton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DavisInterview" /&gt; Later in July, Gunn and the film's cast flew from London to attend San Diego Comic-Con International, where it was revealed that Pace would play Ronan the Accuser, Gillan would be [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]], del Toro as [[Collector (comics)|The Collector]], and that [[Djimon Hounsou]] had been cast as [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]].&lt;ref name="2013JulyComicCon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2013JulyMarvel" /&gt; Close was later revealed to play [[Nova Corps#Known members|Nova Prime Irani Rael]].&lt;ref name="StitchKingdom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2013JulyMarvel" /&gt; Also at San Diego Comic-Con, Feige stated that Thanos would be a part of the film as the "mastermind".&lt;ref name="2013JulyFeige" /&gt; On August 11, 2013, filming began at London's [[Millennium Bridge, London|Millennium Bridge]],&lt;ref name="Entertainmentwise" /&gt; which was selected as a double for [[Xandar]].&lt;ref name="CBRSetVisit" /&gt; In August 2013, Marvel announced that [[Bradley Cooper]] would voice Rocket.&lt;ref name="CooperOfficial" /&gt; On September 3, 2013, Gunn said that filming was "a little over half[way]" complete.&lt;ref name="2013SeptMTV" /&gt; Also in September, [[Vin Diesel]] stated that he was voicing Groot.&lt;ref name="DieselConfirm" /&gt; However, Marvel did not confirm Diesel's involvement in the film at the time.&lt;ref name="RocketStandIn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2013NovDelToro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffingtonPostOct2013" /&gt; On October 12, 2013, Gunn announced on social media that filming had completed.&lt;ref name="FilmingEnding" /&gt;

[[Director of photography]] [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] used [[Arri Alexa#Alexa XT|Arri Alexa XT]] cameras for the film, saying, "I'm traditionally a photochemical fan, but going with the digital format was the right way for this movie ... the Alexa [provided] the right look for this particular film." During the opening scenes in the 1980s, Davis chose JDC Cooke Xtal (Crystal) Express anamorphic prime lenses because they "had more anamorphic artifacts and aberrations, which [he] felt added something." Davis used spherical [[Panavision]] Primos for the rest of the film. Additionally, Davis worked closely with production designer Charles Wood in order to achieve the correct lighting looks for each scene.&lt;ref name="DavisInterview" /&gt; Dealing with two fully CGI characters forced Davis to shoot scenes multiple times, usually once with the references for the characters and once without them in the shot.&lt;ref name="DavisInterview2" /&gt;

Gunn revealed that his brother, Sean Gunn, took on multiple roles during the filming process, such as standing in for Rocket, which he noted was beneficial for the other actors, including Saldana, Pratt, and Bautista, who responded positively to Sean and his on-set performances.&lt;ref name="SeanGunnThanos" /&gt; Special effects makeup designer David White made two life-size versions of Rocket and a bust of Groot as aids for visual effects, with White saying, "it gives [the filmmakers] a good indication of where visual effects needs to pick up and whether Rocket can actually reach certain things or use certain devices."&lt;ref name="RocketGrootBI" /&gt; These busts were also used to see how the on-set lighting would affect the characters, to assist with the visual effects lighting process.&lt;ref name="RocketGrootBI" /&gt;

In January 2015, Disney revealed that the film came in "slightly over the agreed budget" at $232.3 million, with Disney receiving a rebate of $36.4 million from the British government.&lt;ref name="ActualBudget" /&gt; It was previously estimated to have had a $170 million budget.&lt;ref name="Tracking" /&gt;

===Post-production===
In November 2013, Gunn stated that he attempted to use as many practical effects as possible while filming to aid the use of CGI and motion capture during post-production, saying, "Our sets are enormous. We have a prison that is 350,000 pounds of steel. Anybody who knows me knows I love the mix of practical and CGI effects ... I can't wait for people to see it, because it's astonishingly beautiful."&lt;ref name="GunnEffects" /&gt; After the release of ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', Feige stated that the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stones]] would be a focus in the film, as well as going forward into the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Phase Three|Phase Three]] slate of films within the MCU.&lt;ref name="InfinityStones" /&gt; In a separate interview for ''The Dark World'' in November, Feige added that a third, unknown Infinity Stone would be seen in the film,&lt;ref name="SlashFilmNov2013" /&gt; referred to as the "Power Stone" by the Collector.&lt;ref name="VultureThanos" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IBPowerStone" /&gt; The [[mid-credits scene]] in ''The Dark World'' revealed Lovibond's role as the Collector's slave, later named Carina.&lt;ref name="2014AprilLovibond" /&gt; In December 2013, Marvel confirmed that Diesel would voice Groot.&lt;ref name="DieselMarvelOfficial" /&gt;

A few weeks of additional filming, involving the film's main cast and crew, occurred in March 2014 at [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California]].&lt;ref name="GunnAddnlFilming" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GunnAddnlFilming2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SaldanaAddnlFilming" /&gt; In April 2014, Gunn described Thanos as the "head of the snake" in the film, and confirmed he would appear via performance capture.&lt;ref name="SlashFilmApr2014" /&gt; In May 2014, Gunn stated that the film features an "enormous" amount of smaller and minor characters from the Marvel Universe, adding that he felt the film had the most characters overall of any Marvel Studios film to date.&lt;ref name="IGNMay2014" /&gt; Costume supervisor Dan Grace added to this by saying, "We really, really get the feeling of the scale and scope of the galaxy. We visit five planets, we see a hundred different races." The film introduces the alien race [[Planet Hulk|Sakaaran]], who act as Ronan's mercenaries, as a replacement to the [[Badoon]], as the Badoon film rights belonged to [[20th Century Fox]].&lt;ref name="SuperheroHypePg3" /&gt;

By the end of May, [[Josh Brolin]] was revealed as the voice of Thanos,&lt;ref name="ThanosCast" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BrolinThanos" /&gt; with Feige confirming in July that Brolin also provided the performance capture for the character.&lt;ref name="BrolinPerformance" /&gt; Thanos communicates via hologram for much of the film, though he does appear in a scene with Ronan and Nebula.&lt;ref name="VultureThanos" /&gt; In June 2014, Feige added that Thanos and his followers are "the biggest piece of connective tissue that will eventually lead us back into ''Avengers'' films in the future."&lt;ref name="FeigeTotalFilm" /&gt; On casting Brolin, Feige said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;We reached out to him and it was one of those things that does not happen all the time but when it does it's very nice, where he was totally intrigued. He was a fan of what we did, he met with Jeremy Latcham in a hotel in London and learned about the characters a little bit. I spoke to him on the phone a few times. We ran it by James who loved it, ran it by Joss [Whedon] who loved it because Thanos is in this universe because of ''Avengers''. Then we shot him and recorded for it.&lt;ref name="BrolinPerformance" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On July 7, 2014, Gunn announced on social media that he had completed work on the film.&lt;ref name="GotGComplete" /&gt; In August, regarding the post-credit scene, Gunn revealed that the scene did not involve Howard the Duck when it was originally filmed, rather he was added during post-production,&lt;ref name="GunnHowardDuck" /&gt; a decision made by "some combination of [Gunn] and the editor Fred Raskin".&lt;ref name="GunnHowardDuck2" /&gt; As the decision to add the character was made late in the post-production process, he had to be designed that day, before being handed off to Sony Pictures Imageworks to animate.&lt;ref name="GunnHowardDuck2" /&gt; Also in August, regarding the pre-credit scene of Groot dancing, Gunn stated that he himself danced to provide motion reference for the animators, and that the decision was made to place the scene before the credits, rather than during or after them, because of positive responses from a test audience, which made Marvel and Gunn feel that they did not want "people walking out and missing this thing".&lt;ref name="GrootDancing" /&gt; Marvel used design firm Sarofsky once again for the film's title sequences, after liking their work for ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''. Sarofsky developed a custom [[typeface]] based on the font used in the teaser posters for the opening credits, which was tinted orange to offer a better contrast to the film's blue and grey imagery. One of the typography solutions offered before the final product wound up being repurposed as the locator cards seen throughout the film.&lt;ref name="Sarofsky" /&gt;

The film featured 2,750 visual effects shots,&lt;ref name="VFXShots" /&gt; which make up approximately 90% of the film.&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt; The visual effects were created by: [[Moving Picture Company]] (MPC), who worked on creating Groot, as well as Morag, Xandar, the ''Dark Aster'' and the final battle on Xandar;&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt; [[Framestore]], who worked on creating Rocket, extending the Kyln prison set and constructing Knowhere;&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FramestoreRocket" /&gt; [[Luma Pictures]], who worked on Thanos;&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt; [[Method Studios]], who worked on creating the Orb opening and revealing its powers, as well as the holographic displays at the Nova Corps command center;&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt; Lola VFX; Cantina Creative; [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]], who worked on Howard the Duck and creating the ''Dark Aster'' shots with MPC;&lt;ref name="GunnHowardDuck2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt; CoSA VFX; Secret Lab; Rise Visual Effects Studios; and Technicolor VFX.&lt;ref name="VarietyReview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MethodVFX" /&gt; Pre- and post-visualizations were done by Proof and The Third Floor, with Proof also contributing to the creation of Rocket and Groot.&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt;

Producer Nik Korda noted how helpful it was to have Sean Gunn and Krystian Godlewski portray Rocket and Groot on set, as it provided references for lighting and on-set performances to the animators.&lt;ref name="RocketGrootBI" /&gt; When creating Groot, MPC realized early on that his eyes would be essential in maintaining the character's human qualities, as his face couldn't move in the way that humans' do. MPC visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi explained that, "When you look at humans what makes the eyes interesting is the imperfections—trying to make these two irises not aimed at the same place—trying to make them strange and look more human."&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt; Textures for Groot came from a number of sources, including inspiration from a botanical garden in London, and the character was modeled as individual branches, rigged individually, to simulate a muscle system for the character.&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt;

One of the major challenges for Framestore in creating Rocket was his fur. Framestore's Rachel Williams explained that, since "raccoon fur is made up from a layer of short fine hair and a layer of longer thicker hairs", these layers were separated and animated individually, removing the need to use "guide hairs" to control the movements of thick sections of fur.&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt; Framestore and MPC worked closely sharing assets, to ensure shots of Rocket at MPC would match the Rocket created by Framestore, and vice versa for when Groot was needed by the other studio.&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt;

In order to give Thanos "the performance and the weight that he deserved", Luma Pictures created a new facial animation system to re-create Josh Brolin as a fully CG character, using his "eyes, some of his cheek, how his muscles move when he talks". The character's large jaw, and the deep groves that run down his face, had "to be carefully planned out with the movement of his face."&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt;

==Music==
{{main|Guardians of the Galaxy (soundtrack)}}
In August 2013, Gunn revealed that [[Tyler Bates]] would be composing the film's score. Gunn stated that Bates would write some of the score first so that he can film to the music, as opposed to scoring to the film.&lt;ref name="Bates" /&gt; In February 2014, Gunn revealed that the film would incorporate songs from the 1960s and 1970s, such as "[[Hooked on a Feeling]]", on a mixtape in Quill's [[Walkman]], which acts as a way for him to stay connected to the Earth, home, and family he lost.&lt;ref name="TotalFilmTrailer6" /&gt; In May 2014, Gunn added that using the songs from the '60s and '70s were "cultural reference points", saying, "It's striking the balance throughout the whole movie, through something that is very unique, but also something that is easily accessible to people at the same time. The music and the Earth stuff is one of those touchstones that we have to remind us that, yeah, [Quill] is a real person from planet Earth who's just like you and me. Except that he's in this big outer space adventure."&lt;ref name="IGNMay2014" /&gt;

When choosing the songs, Gunn revealed he "started the process by reading the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts for all of the top hits of the '70s", downloading "a few hundred" songs that were "semi-familiar—ones you recognize but might not be able to name off the top of your head" and creating a playlist for all the songs that would fit the film tonally. He added that he "would listen to the playlist on my speakers around the house—sometimes I would be inspired to create a scene around a song, and other times I had a scene that needed music and I would listen through the playlist, visualizing various songs, figuring out which would work the best."&lt;ref name="VultureMusic" /&gt; Most of the songs were played on set to help "the actors and the camera operators find the perfect groove for the shot", with [[David Bowie]]'s "[[Moonage Daydream]]" the only song chosen and added during post-production. Gunn also said that the opening scenes were designed with "Hooked on a Feeling" in mind; however, once Gunn discovered "[[Come and Get Your Love]]", the song used in the sequence, Gunn felt it was a "better fit."&lt;ref name="VultureMusic" /&gt;

Three albums were released by [[Hollywood Records]] on July 29, 2014: The film's score, ''Guardians of the Galaxy (Original Score)'', which features the music composed by Bates for the film;&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt; ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (soundtrack)|Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)]]'', which comprises the twelve songs from Quill's mixtape; and a deluxe edition featuring both albums.&lt;ref name="Soundtracks" /&gt; By August 2014, the album which mirrored Quill's mixtape had reached the top of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, becoming the first soundtrack album in history consisting entirely of previously released songs to top the chart.&lt;ref name="AwesomeMixChart" /&gt; Hollywood Records also released a cassette version of the ''Awesome Mix Vol. 1'' soundtrack on November 28, 2014, as an exclusive to [[Record Store Day]] participants. The cassette, which is the first cassette [[Disney Music Group]] has released since 2003, comes with a digital download version of the album.&lt;ref name="AwesomeMixCassette" /&gt;

At Disney's [[Disney D23|D23]] Expo in August 2013, Feige presented footage first revealed at the San Diego Comic-Con in July 2013.&lt;ref name="D23" /&gt; The first trailer for the film debuted on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' on February 18, 2014, with a special introduction by Chris Pratt.&lt;ref name="USATodayFeb2014" /&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said the trailer delivered "some spirited alien action, with exploding spaceships and muscled bad guys, not to mention a few purely comedic moments," while spotlighting "a number of the offbeat characters."&lt;ref name="LATimesTrailer" /&gt; ''[[Total Film]]'' noted the similarity of the trailer's opening clip to the 1981 film, ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', which Gunn stated was a big influence for ''Guardians'',&lt;ref name="TotalFilmTrailer1" /&gt; and made note of the "edgy" humor used throughout.&lt;ref name="TotalFilmTrailer5" /&gt; ''Total Film'' also noted the similarity of the trailer to the one debuted at Comic-Con and D23, with a few new shots featuring Nebula and the Collector.&lt;ref name="TotalFilmTrailer9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TotalFilmTrailer10" /&gt; Social media response to the trailer was strong, with 88,000 mentions across [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and various blogs in a 12-hour period. Those numbers were comparable to trailers for other superhero films like ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'', and noteworthy for the late night-time period in which it premiered.&lt;ref name="TheWrapTrailer" /&gt; The trailer received 22.8 million views in the 24 hours after it debuted.&lt;ref name="TrailerViews" /&gt; After the debut of the trailer, [[Blue Swede]]'s version of "[[Hooked on a Feeling]]", which was prominently used throughout the trailer, went up 700% in sales the following day.&lt;ref name="HookedOnAFeelingSales" /&gt; The line from Serafinowicz's character, "What a bunch of a-holes", was only intended to be featured in the trailers, but due to its positive reception, was included in the final cut of the film.&lt;ref name="A-holesLine" /&gt; Gunn noted that a different teaser was almost released "that was very cheesy [and] sold the movie as something different than what it was", as it tested better than the version that was ultimately released. Gunn credited the marketing teams at Marvel and Disney for having faith in the latter version, despite how it tested, over choosing the version that would have mis-marketed the film.&lt;ref name="CheesyTrailer" /&gt;

In March 2014, the ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' episode "[[T.A.H.I.T.I.]]" introduced the Kree race to the MCU, which began a storyline that recurs throughout the series and involves finding a hidden Kree city.&lt;ref name="BennetKree" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BennetBellKree" /&gt; Also in March, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] aired a one-hour [[television special]] titled, ''[[Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe]]'', which included a sneak peek of ''Guardians of the Galaxy''.&lt;ref name="TVSpecial" /&gt; Starting in April 2014, a two-part comic was released, titled ''[[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics#Guardians of the Galaxy Prelude (2014)|Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Prelude]]''. Written by [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Andy Lanning]], with art by Wellington Alves, the first issue focused on the background of Nebula and her bond with Thanos; the second issue featured the adventures of Rocket and Groot before they join forces with the other Guardians.&lt;ref name="PreludeComic" /&gt; In June 2014, Mike Pasciullo, senior VP of Marvel Studios, described the marketing approach for ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' by saying that Marvel had "built a robust marketing program for the theatrical release that carefully integrates traditional advertising, social media, digital marketing, strategic promotional partnerships, organic entertainment integrations [and] publicity."&lt;ref name="VarietyMarketingJun2014" /&gt;

In July 2014, Marvel launched a [[viral marketing]] campaign for the film called "Galaxy Getaways", a fictional [[travel website]] that allows users to book passage to some of the planets depicted in the film, including [[Xandar]], Morag, and Knowhere.&lt;ref name="GalaxyGetaways" /&gt; Beginning July 4, 2014, a sneak peek of the film was presented at [[Disneyland]] and [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] in the [[Captain EO|Magic Eye]] and [[Sounds Dangerous!|ABC Sound Studio]] theaters, respectively.&lt;ref name="DisneyParksSneakPeek" /&gt; Approximately 14&lt;!--PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE TO 17. IF YOU CONTINUE READING AND LOOK AT THE NEWSARAMA SOURCE, THE MATERIAL WAS 14 MINUTES, WITH TRAILERS ADDED TO THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE CLIP TO MAKE UP THE TOTAL 17 MINUTES OF THE SCREENING. THANK YOU.--&gt; minutes of the film was screened on July 7, 2014, in IMAX 3D in the United States, and 3D theaters and IMAX 3D in Canada, along with two trailers.&lt;ref name="IMAXScreening" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RamaScreening" /&gt; The screening was met with positive reviews, praising the humor, the 3D and IMAX conversion, and Cooper's portrayal of Rocket.&lt;ref name="RamaScreening" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ColliderEarlyReaction" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CinemaBlendScreening" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBRScreening" /&gt; However, it was criticized for beginning partway through the film, not allowing viewers to easily acclimate to the film's tone,&lt;ref name="ColliderEarlyReaction" /&gt;&lt;ref name="/FilmScreening" /&gt; and for how the general audience might respond to a film within the MCU without established characters making appearances.&lt;ref name="/FilmScreening" /&gt;

On July 12, 2014, Gunn and the actors from the film promoted ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' at the [[Shaw House and Centre|Lido 8 Cineplex]] in Singapore.&lt;ref name="SingaporePremiere" /&gt; On July 17, 2014, [[Disney Interactive]] released an action [[role playing game|RPG]] [[video game]] titled ''Guardians of the Galaxy: The Universal Weapon'' for [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] devices.&lt;ref name="MobileGame" /&gt; The game's original story was written by [[Dan Abnett]], and was meant to complement the film.&lt;ref name="MobileGame2" /&gt; On July 21, Pratt, Saldana, Bautista, Diesel and Cooper appeared on ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'' to promote the film and debut some additional exclusive content.&lt;ref name="KimmelPremiere" /&gt; On July 29, Pratt and Saldana rang the opening bell of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] as part of the film's marketing strategy.&lt;ref name="NYSE" /&gt;

On August 14, Marvel released the scene of Groot dancing,&lt;ref name="BabyGroot" /&gt; which was shortly followed by an announcement from Funko that they were releasing a toy "Dancing Groot". ''The Hollywood Reporter'' noted that the quick release of the scene from Marvel two weeks after the film's theatrical release, along with the rush announcement from Funko, indicated the popularity of both the character and the scene.&lt;ref name="THRBabyGroot" /&gt; The scene also produced the word "grooting", coined by Michael Rooker, in which a person dances similar to Groot, with the word entering the social media [[lexicon]].&lt;ref name="Grooting" /&gt; Also in August, Marvel held a special screening of the film at [[Children's Hospital Los Angeles]], where Pratt dressed as Star-Lord to entertain the patients.&lt;ref name="ChildrensHospitalScreening" /&gt;

===Merchandise===
In June 2012, Marvel filed eleven [[trademark]] applications for ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', covering a variety of [[consumer product]]s, from [[video game]]s to [[cosmetics]].&lt;ref name="2012TMApps" /&gt; [[Disney Consumer Products]] partnered with Mad Engine, C-Life, [[New Era Cap Company|New Era]], [[Hasbro]], Disguise, Rubies, [[Sideshow Collectibles]], [[Lego]], KIDdesigns, [[iHome]], [[Funko]], Freeze, Fast Forward, and Innovative Designs to produce merchandise for the film, with releases starting in June 2014.&lt;ref name="VarietyMarketingJun2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2013AugVariety" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LegoSets" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LegoSets2" /&gt; Mad Engine and C-Life were partnered as the core apparel outfitters, producing a line of T-shirts and fleece jackets, while New Era produced headwear and hats.&lt;ref name="2013AugVariety" /&gt; Hasbro produced toys for the film; Disguise and Rubies produced the costumes; and [[Sideshow Collectibles]] was given charge of the collectibles.&lt;ref name="VarietyMarketingJun2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2013AugVariety" /&gt; Lego announced three toy sets based on scenes from the film,&lt;ref name="LegoSets" /&gt; while iHome created character speakers, Funko made vinyl [[bobblehead]]s, Freeze crafted 1980s-inspired apparel, and backpacks and stationery were made by Fast Forward and Innovative Designs.&lt;ref name="VarietyMarketingJun2014" /&gt; Despite first films in a potential new franchise usually being off-limits to licensees, Marvel used ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]''{{'}}s success as evidence of unknown characters becoming hits with audiences to attract partnerships. Licensees embraced Rocket as the film's potential breakout character, with Drax and Gamora being used for older demographics; Star-Lord's obsession with 1980s nostalgia, including his "Awesome Mix Vo. 1" cassette, has also served as a basis for tie-in products.&lt;ref name="VarietyMarketingJun2014" /&gt; In August 2014, Funko announced a toy based on "Dancing Groot",&lt;ref name="THRBabyGroot" /&gt; while in October 2014, Marvel and KID designs announced a replica of dancing Groot, for release in December 2014.&lt;ref name="KIDDancingGroot" /&gt;

In December 2014, Disney made a second marketing push, to coincide with the film's home media release with additional merchandise. Merchandise partners included: KID designs with its replica dancing Groot; Funko's Fabrikations line with a plush Rocket; Mattel's Hot Wheels character cars; C-Life, Hybrid-Jem Sportswear, Freeze, MZ Berger, Accutime, AME and Her Universe with apparel; ThinkGeek with jewelry and watches; American Greetings with cards; Jay Franco with homegoods; and Vandor with drinkware. Additional partners included Mad Engine, Just Play, and Dragon Models. Paul Gitter, senior vice-president of Marvel licensing at Disney Consumer Products said, "The demand for ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' merchandise has been truly out of this world. Our merchandising and retail partners are doing a tremendous job of providing creative and innovative ways for fans to continue interacting with these popular characters and showcase their fandom year round."&lt;ref name="Dec2014Marketing" /&gt;

===Theatrical===
[[File:Karen Gillan - Guardians of the Galaxy London premiere.jpg|thumb|Karen Gillan at the London premiere of ''Guardians of the Galaxy''.]]
The world premiere of ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' was held on July 21, 2014, at the [[Dolby Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref name="WorldPremiere" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KimmelPremiere" /&gt; The film was released theatrically in the United Kingdom on July 31, 2014,&lt;ref name="IGNMay2014" /&gt; and in the United States on August 1,&lt;ref name="2012SDCCPanel" /&gt; in 3D and IMAX 3D.&lt;ref name="2013Jan3D" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IMAX3D" /&gt; The film was released in 4,080 theaters in the United States, making it the widest August release, breaking the five-year record held by ''[[G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra]]'' (4,007 theatres). The breakdown of venues was: 354 [[IMAX]] screens, 3,200 3D screens, 350 [[Large format (photography)|large format]] screens and 240 [[D-Box Technologies|D-Box]] screens.&lt;ref name="DeadlineReleaseFormats" /&gt; In its sixth weekend, ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' was playing in 69 territories, its most.&lt;ref name="DeadlineIntWeek6" /&gt;

In June 2014, Gunn stated that the film had always been planned as a 3D film, and "Unlike many directors, I've been actively involved with converting every shot to 3D, making sure it works perfectly for the story and the film, making sure it's spectacular and immersive without being silly, distracting, or overly showy." Gunn also revealed that the IMAX 3D version would include shifting aspect ratios, to make the viewing experience "even fuller and more encompassing. I've personally chosen all the places where the changes occur ... The changing aspect ratios in this case are actually a part of the storytelling."&lt;ref name="Gunn3D" /&gt; In July 2014, Gunn revealed that there were multiple scenes he had cut from the film, and he was investigating how to release them, either in an extended cut of the film, or as bonus features on the film's home media release.&lt;ref name="BrolinPerformance" /&gt;

===Home media===
''Guardians of the Galaxy'' was released for [[Digital distribution|digital download]] by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on November 18, 2014 and on [[Blu-ray]], [[Blu-ray Disc#Blu-ray 3D|Blu-ray 3D]], and [[DVD]] on November 24, 2014, in the United Kingdom and on December 9 in the United States.&lt;ref name="UKBlu-ray" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blu-ray" /&gt; The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, a blooper reel, and an exclusive preview of ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''.&lt;ref name="Blu-ray" /&gt; {{as of|2015|10|4|df=US}}, the film has earned over $118 million in sales in the US.&lt;ref name="HomeSales" /&gt;

The film was also included in the 13-disc [[box set]], titled "[[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Home media|Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two Collection]]", which includes all of the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Phase Two|Phase Two]] films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was released on December 8, 2015.&lt;ref name="Boxset" /&gt;

==Reception==

===Box office===
''Guardians of the Galaxy'' earned $333.2 million in North America and an estimated $440.2 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $773.3 million.&lt;ref name="Mojo"/&gt; The film became the third-highest-grossing film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, behind ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[Iron Man 3]]''.&lt;ref name="DeadlineIntWeek12"/&gt; It was the third-highest-grossing [[2014 in film|2014 film]] (behind ''[[Transformers: Age of Extinction]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'') and the highest-grossing superhero film of 2014.&lt;ref name="ActualBudget" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeadlineIntWeek13" /&gt; It had a worldwide opening weekend of $160.7 million.&lt;ref name="DeadlineIntWeek1" /&gt; ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' calculated the net profit for the film to be $204.2 million, when factoring together "production budgets, P&amp;A, talent participations and other costs, with box office grosses, and ancillary revenues from VOD to DVD and TV," placing it fifth on their list of 2014's "Most Valuable Blockbusters".&lt;ref name="DeadlineNetProfit" /&gt;

====North America====
''Guardians of the Galaxy'' earned $11.2 million on its Thursday night pre-opening, surpassing ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier''{{'}}s gross ($10.2 million) for the biggest Thursday evening start for a movie in 2014.&lt;ref name="VarietyThursdayEarningPlusIntl" /&gt; IMAX accounted for 17% of the total gross ($1.9 million), which was the biggest August pre-release in IMAX format.&lt;ref name="DeadlineReleaseFormats" /&gt; On its opening day, the film earned $37.8 million, including the Thursday night earnings.&lt;ref name="OpeningDayTotal" /&gt; ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' was the number one movie during its opening weekend and grossed $94.3 million, setting an August weekend record.&lt;ref name="OpeningWeekendBoxOffice" /&gt; During the opening weekend, IMAX earnings amounted to $11.7 million and 3-D showings accounted for 45% of ticket sales. The film's success was partially attributed to its appeal to both genders: the opening-weekend audience was 44% female, which is the biggest proportion ever for a MCU film; 55% of the opening-weekend audience was over the age of 25.&lt;ref name="OpeningWeekendBoxOffice" /&gt;

Although the film fell to second place in its second and third weekends, behind ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'',&lt;ref name="Forbes2ndWknd" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes3rdWknd" /&gt; the film was number one in its fourth, fifth, and sixth weekend.&lt;ref name="Variety4thWknd" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety5thWkndFinal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety6thWknd" /&gt; By doing so, it became the first film in 2014 to top the domestic box office in non-consecutive weeks,&lt;ref name="Variety4thWknd" /&gt; the first film of the summer (May–August) to be the number one film in three weekends&lt;ref name="ThreeWkndNum1" /&gt; and the first MCU film to be the top film for four weeks, surpassing ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' and ''The Avengers'', both of which were number one for three weeks, and tied ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' for the most weeks at number one among comic book-based films.&lt;ref name="MostMarvelNo1" /&gt; Phil Contrino, vice president and chief analyst of ''[[Boxoffice (magazine)|BoxOffice.com]]'' felt ''Guardians'' success was "unconventional" and was "shattering expectations".&lt;ref name="Variety5thWkndFinal" /&gt; The film remained in the top 10 for ten weekends.&lt;ref name="Deadline10thWknd" /&gt;

The film was the top-grossing film of summer 2014 (ahead of ''[[Transformers: Age of Extinction]]''),&lt;ref name="Mojo4thWknd" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeadlineTopSummer" /&gt; first of 2014 to pass $300 million for its domestic gross,&lt;ref name="Variety300milDomestic" /&gt; and was the third-highest-grossing domestic film of 2014 (behind ''[[American Sniper]]'' and ''[[The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1]]'').&lt;ref name="BOM-Highest-2014" /&gt; The film was said to have "injected life" into an otherwise lower-than-normal summer box office.&lt;ref name="Variety5thWkndFinal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeadlineTopSummer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="InjectLife" /&gt;

====Outside North America====
''Guardians of the Galaxy'' was released in 42 international markets and grossed $66.4 million on its opening weekend. The biggest debuts came from [[Russia]] ($13 million), the [[United Kingdom]] ($10.8 million), [[Mexico]] ($6.5 million), [[Brazil]] ($6.5 million), and [[South Korea]] ($4.7 million).&lt;ref name="DeadlineIntWeek1"/&gt; The film topped the weekend box office two times, in its first and second weekends.&lt;ref name="DeadlineIntWeek1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeadlineIntWeek2" /&gt; In its eleventh weekend, the film opened in China, earning $29.8 million, its largest, and became the third-highest opening in the country for any Disney release, behind ''Iron Man 3'' and ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', and was an all-time industry record opening in October.&lt;ref name="DeadlineIntWeek11" /&gt; The following weekend saw an additional $21.3 million from China, making China the highest-grossing market with $69 million.&lt;ref name="DeadlineIntWeek12" /&gt; The film's three biggest markets in total earnings were: China ($96.5 million), the UK ($47.4 million), and Russia ($37.5 million).&lt;ref name="BOM-intl" /&gt;

===Critical response===
The review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 91% approval rating with an average rating of 7.7/10 based on 305 reviews. The website's consensus reads, "''Guardians of the Galaxy'' is just as irreverent as fans of the frequently zany Marvel comic would expect—as well as funny, thrilling, full of heart, and packed with visual splendor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/guardians_of_the_galaxy/|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 76 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/guardians-of-the-galaxy|title=Guardians of the Galaxy|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CinemaScore]] audiences gave ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' an "A" grade rating on an A+ to F scale,&lt;ref name="CinemaScore" /&gt; while earning an "A+" among under-18 and 25- to 34-year-old viewers.&lt;ref name="ForbesMendelson" /&gt;

Scott Foundas of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said "James Gunn's presumptive franchise-starter is overlong, overstuffed and sometimes too eager to please, but the cheeky comic tone keeps things buoyant—as does Chris Pratt's winning performance", and praised the film's look created by cinematographer [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]], production designer Charles Wood, and special effects makeup designer David White.&lt;ref name="VarietyReview" /&gt; Justin Lowe of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' also praised the film's look, and felt "A well-matched ensemble rises to the challenge of launching a heroic origin film with distinctive style, abundant thrills and no shortage of humor."&lt;ref name="THRReview" /&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''{{'}}s Robbie Collin said, "A brand new summer family blockbuster this may be, but it plays by old, half-forgotten rules; trimming out the clutter and cross-referencing for snappy, streamlined, Saturday-cartoon fun".&lt;ref name="TelegraphReview" /&gt; Kenneth Turan of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said, "Blessed with a loose, anarchic B-picture soul that encourages you to enjoy yourself even when you're not quite sure what's going on, the scruffy ''Guardians'' is irreverent in a way that can bring the first ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' to mind, in part because it has some of the most unconventional heroes this side of the [[Mos Eisley]] cantina."&lt;ref name="LATimesReview" /&gt; Manohla Dargis of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "While ''Guardians'' takes you down one after another crazy narrative turn, it also pulls you into—and, for the most part, keeps you in—a fully realized other world."&lt;ref name="NYTimesReview" /&gt; [[Richard Roeper]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' said, "''Guardians of the Galaxy'' is a late summer treat—a mostly lighthearted and self-referential comic-book movie with loads of whiz-bang action, some laugh-out-loud moments and a couple of surprisingly beautiful and touching scenes as well," calling it "a refreshing confection of entertainment."&lt;ref name="ChicagoTimesReview" /&gt; [[Jim Starlin]], creator of Drax the Destroyer, Gamora, and Thanos, said it "might be Marvel's best movie yet".&lt;ref name="Starlin" /&gt;

Jake Coyle of the [[Associated Press]] was more critical of the film, calling it "terribly overstuffed and many of the jokes get drowned out by the special effects ... The pervasive movie references detract from the stab at freshness, and ''Guardians'' depends all too much on the whimsy of '70s anthems for an original beat." He also felt that Close, Reilly and del Toro were underused in the film.&lt;ref name="APReview" /&gt; [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' said, "In place of wit, ''Guardians'' offers a sort of generalized willingness to be amusing, an atmosphere of high spirits that feels like lots of people pumping air into a tire that has a hole in it. Everyone is clearly working, but nothing is really happening–and yet the effort is so evident that there's an impulse to reward it."&lt;ref name="SFChronicleReview" /&gt; Kyle Smith of the ''[[New York Post]]'' also had a negative response to the film, comparing it to ''[[Howard the Duck (film)|Howard the Duck]]'' and ''[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]'', and criticizing the dialogue, villains, soundtrack, lack of suspense, and the characters of Quill, Rocket, and Drax.&lt;ref name="NYPostReview" /&gt; The film received mixed reviews in China, where viewers complained that the film's "poor subtitle translation not only spoiled the fun of watching it, but also made it difficult to understand its humor."&lt;ref name="ChinaDaily" /&gt;

''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'' was released on May 5, 2017, again written and directed by James Gunn.&lt;ref name="VarietyVol2" /&gt; Pratt, Saldana, Bautista, Diesel, Cooper, Rooker, Gillan, and Sean Gunn all reprise their roles in the film,&lt;ref name="GotG2Cast" /&gt; and are joined by [[Pom Klementieff]] as [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]],&lt;ref name="Vol1Title2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KlementieffGotG2" /&gt; [[Elizabeth Debicki]] as [[Kismet (Marvel Comics)|Ayesha]], [[Chris Sullivan (actor)|Chris Sullivan]] as [[Taserface]], and [[Kurt Russell]] as Quill's father [[Ego the Living Planet|Ego]].&lt;ref name="Vol1Title2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GotG2Cast" /&gt;

In April 2017, Gunn announced he would return to write and direct ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3''.&lt;ref name="GunnVol3Confirm" /&gt; However, in July 2018, Disney and Marvel severed ties with Gunn following the resurfacing of old controversial tweets surrounding topics such as rape and pedophilia.&lt;ref name="GunnFiredTHR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GunnFiredDeadline" /&gt; Production was put on hold a month later.&lt;ref name="Vol3Postponement" /&gt; ''Vol. 3'' had been expected to be released in 2020.&lt;ref name="Vol32020Release" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GunnFiredTHR" /&gt;

'''''Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs''''' is a 2009 American [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] [[comedy film|comedy]] [[adventure film]] produced by [[Blue Sky Studios]] and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]. It is the third installment in the [[Ice Age (franchise)#Films|''Ice Age'' series]] and the sequel to ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'' (2006). It was directed by [[Carlos Saldanha]] and co-directed by [[Mike Thurmeier]]. [[Ray Romano]], [[John Leguizamo]], [[Denis Leary]]  reprise their roles from the first two films and [[Queen Latifah]], [[Seann William Scott]], and [[Josh Peck]] reprise their roles from ''The Meltdown'', with [[Simon Pegg]] joining them in the role of a weasel named Buck. The story has [[Sid (Ice Age)|Sid]] the Sloth being taken by a female ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' after stealing her eggs, leading the rest of the herd to rescue him in a tropical lost world inhabited by [[dinosaur]]s beneath the ice.

The film was released on July 1, 2009, becoming the first ''Ice Age'' film and the first 20th Century Fox film to be released in 3D.&lt;ref name="LATFoxBuy3DGlasses"/&gt; Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, it ranked at the time as the second-highest-grossing animated film of all time, and the highest-grossing ''Ice Age'' film&lt;ref name=NJHoboken /&gt;&lt;ref name=ChinaTopFive3D /&gt; earning $886.7 million worldwide. A sequel, titled ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'', was released in 2012, and another film, titled ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'', was released in 2016.

==Plot==
[[List of Ice Age characters#Ellie|Ellie]] and [[Manny (Ice Age)|Manny]], the two [[woolly mammoth]]s, are expecting their first child, and Manny struggles to make life perfect and safe for the family. At the same time, [[Diego (Ice Age)|Diego]] the [[Smilodon|saber-toothed cat]] finds himself unable to catch a cocky [[gazelle]] he has been stalking and decides to leave The Herd, believing that he is losing his predatory nature as a tiger. [[Sid (Ice Age)|Sid]] the [[Megalonyx|ground sloth]] begins to wish for a family of his own and takes three apparently abandoned eggs that he finds in an icy underground cavern and calls them Egbert, Shelly, and Yoko. Manny tells him to put them back, but Sid ignores Manny and looks after the eggs, which hatch into baby ''[[Tyrannosaurus Rex]]'' the next morning.

Although Sid tries his best to raise the three dinosaurs, their rambunctious behavior scares away all the younger animals and ruins a playground Manny built for his child. Not long after, a female ''Tyrannosaurus Rex'', whose eggs Sid stole, soon returns and carries both Sid and her young underground, with Diego in pursuit. Manny, Ellie, [[List of Ice Age characters#Crash and Eddie|Crash and Eddie]] the [[opossums]] follow as well and discover that the icy cavern leads to a vast subterranean jungle populated by dinosaurs thought to be extinct. Here, an angry ''[[Ankylosaurus]]'' threatens The Herd despite Diego's efforts to fend it off; they are saved from a further crowd of angry reptiles by a deranged one-eyed [[weasel]] named [[List of Ice Age characters#Buck|Buck]].

Buck has been living in this jungle for quite some time and is fighting [[List of Ice Age characters#Rudy|Rudy]], a huge [[albino]] ''[[Baryonyx]]'', intending to avenge the eye he lost to it when he was young with a knife he carved from one of Rudy's teeth. He agrees to lead The Herd through the jungle's perils to Lava Falls, where the dinosaur has taken Sid and her babies. In the meantime, Sid and the mother dinosaur try to outdo each other in feeding the offspring; he loses this contest, but is reluctantly welcomed into the family regardless. The next day, however, Sid is separated from the family and attacked by Rudy. Sid is knocked onto a loose rock slab that is floating on a river of lava and about to plummet over the falls.

As The Herd moves toward Lava Falls, Ellie goes into labor and a ''[[Guanlong]]'' pack strikes, causing a rock slide that separates her from Manny and Diego. Manny doubles back to protect her and Diego fends off further attacks, while Buck takes Crash and Eddie ahead to rescue Sid. Just as he goes over the falls, the trio swoops in on a commandeered ''[[Harpactognathus]]'' only to be chased by a flock of ''[[Pterodactylus]]'' on the way and saves his life. Manny reaches Ellie just in time to hear the cry of a newborn baby girl. Ellie names her [[List of Ice Age characters#Peaches|Peaches]] after the fruit. Sid is saddened at the fact that he never had a chance to say goodbye to "his" children as he returns to The Herd and learns of Peaches' birth.

Before they can leave the jungle, they are ambushed by Rudy, who begins to attack them at full force; working together Manny, Sid, Diego, and Buck manage to trap Rudy by ensnaring him in vines. However, he quickly breaks free and resumes his onslaught. The Herd is saved by the timely arrival of the mother dinosaur, who charges at Rudy and knocks him off a cliff. As she and her children wish Sid well, Buck, now without a purpose in life since Rudy is gone, decides to join The Herd and live on the surface. However, a distant roar tells him that Rudy is still alive; he changes his mind and sends The Herd home, blocking off the path to the underground jungle at the same time. Manny and Ellie welcome Peaches into their frozen world and admit that Sid did a good job looking after Momma's children. Diego decides to remain with The Herd, while Buck stays underground, happily battling it out with Rudy.

==Production==
Blue Sky decided to do "more of a what-if adventure" in the third ''Ice Age'' installment, titled ''Ice Age: A New Beginning'', "like finding the giant ape in ''[[King Kong]]'' or a [[Shangri-la]] in the middle of snow," and added the dinosaurs to the story. Character designer Peter de Sève welcomed the new plot addition, since he could not think of any other giant mammal to put into the story. The "lost world" approach led to colorful dinosaurs, because "the dinosaurs didn't have to be just brown, and you can take liberties because no one knows what color they were", according to de Sève. Rudy's design was inspired by the ''[[Baryonyx]]'' because of his crocodile-like look, which de Sève considered even more menacing than the ''T. rex''.&lt;ref name="Wloszczyna"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2009-06-29-ice-age-dinosaurs_N.htm|title='Ice Age' warms up to dinosaurs in third installment|work=[[USA Today]]|date=June 30, 2009|accessdate=August 20, 2009 | first=Susan | last=Wloszczyna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was released in [[RealD Cinema]] where available. The release sparked some controversy when Fox announced that it would no longer pay to supply 3D glasses to theaters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Sperling| first = Nicole| title = 'Ice Age 3' at the center of a struggle over 3-D exhibition| work = Entertainment Weekly| date = April 1, 2009| url = http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2009/04/01/theater-chains/| accessdate = June 15, 2009| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120709234937/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2009/04/01/theater-chains/| archivedate = July 9, 2012| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to a number of exhibitors threatening to only show the film in standard 2D projection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Taylor| first = Dawn| title = Regal to Fox: No 3D Glasses?

The film's original trailer debuted with the film ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' on March 14, 2008, then online on April 7, 2008. There are three others that have been released, with the third and fourth (which shows Buck) being the most closely resembling each other. [[Queen Latifah]] recorded a cover of the song "[[Walk the Dinosaur]]".

A review aggregator, [[Rotten Tomatoes]], reported that 45% of critics gave positive reviews based on 159 reviews with an average score of 5.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads "''Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs'' boasts some excellent animation—in particular, the dinosaurs are wonderfully realized—but its story is tired and monotonous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1194515-ice_age_dawn_of_the_dinosaurs/ | title=Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs Movie Reviews, Pictures | work=Rotten Tomatoes | accessdate=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film an average score of 50 based on 25 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/iceage3 | title=Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs (2009): Reviews | publisher=Metacritic | accessdate=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A-" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Subers|first1=Ray|title=Weekend Report: 'Ice Age' Doesn't Melt in Fourth Outing|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=3488&amp;p=.htm|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=April 23, 2017|date=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three and a half stars out of four claiming that "''Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs'' is the best of the three films about our friends in the inter-species herd of plucky prehistoric heroes. And it involves some of the best use of 3-D I've seen in an animated feature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090629/REVIEWS/906299995 | title=Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs Review | author=Roger Ebert | website=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date=June 29, 2009 | accessdate=July 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lou Lumenik of the ''[[New York Post]]'' awarded the film 3 stars stating that the film is "much more of an emphasis on action in this nicely crafted, fast-paced sequel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/07012009/entertainment/movies/nice_age__176999.htm | title='Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs' Will Melt Your Heart - New York Post | date=July 1, 2009 | accessdate=July 4, 2009 | website=New York Post | first=Lou | last=Lumenick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith Phipps of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' graded the film a C+ claiming the sequel "throws its commitment to the era away with movie number three, a ploy sure to anger ''Ice Age'' purists everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/ice-age-dawn-of-the-dinosaurs,29880/ | title=Ice Age: Dawn Of The Dinosaurs - A.V.

Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrie Rickey of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' enjoyed the "film's animation art is Seuss-imaginative", but panned "the flatness of the story and indifferent voicework all the more obvious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/movies/20090630_Ice_Age__Dawn_of_the_Dinosaurs.html | title='Ice Age': The search for a plot | website=The Philadelphia Inquirer | date=June 30, 2009 | accessdate=July 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Space and Telecommunications Law''' ('''IDEST''') was founded in 2000 under the initiative of professionals in the space and telecommunication sectors. The institute is attached to the Interdiscliplinary College of Research at the [[Paris-Sud 11 University|University of Paris-Sud]]. IDEST is made up of a number of lecturers, professors, PhD students, and researchers under the control of a scientific counsel composed of renowned professors and key figures in the sectors involved.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idest-paris.org/fr/équipe-pédagogique-52&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dual expertise ==

IDEST addresses all legal aspects linked to the use of outer space and space applications. The Institute also focuses on industrial cooperation, project finance, and the analysis of national space politics on the civil, commercial and military levels. IDEST also exercises its competences in the law of electronic communications domain, notably in terms of market regulation, the use of limited resources, the normalization of equipment and applications. Furthermore, the Institute also addresses issues related to the aforementioned key sectors: information law, [[media law]], defense and security.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idest-paris.org/fr/présentation-45&lt;/ref&gt;

== A policy of international research ==

The institute regroups researchers from more than ten countries, and has the capacity to produce research in several languages, including: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Iranian, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish.  The Institute has overseas representatives who travel in relation with the Parisian unit. Since its creation, IDEST has concluded numerous research contracts &lt;ref&gt;Research contracts IDEST-ANFR: http://www.idest-paris.org/fr/signature-du-contrat-de-recherche-anfr-idest-71&lt;/ref&gt; with the main spatial and telecommunication institutions. Its members publish in referenced journals&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120709165945/http://editions.larcier.com/auteurs/33184/philippe-achilleas.html Philippe Achilleas]. Editions.larcier.com. Retrieved on 2014-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt; and participate in all the major scientific events worldwide.&lt;ref name="World Telecommunication and Information Society Day 2011"&gt;http://jmt2011.fr/philippeachilleas.php{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute supervises [[Ph D]], much of which is undertaken in co-direction with foreign establishments.

== An established educational expertise ==

IDEST is involved in the management of the master's degree in Space Activities and Telecommunications Law at the [[Paris-Sud 11 University|University of Paris-Sud]]. Its members partake as speakers at numerous other universities and [[grandes écoles]] in France and overseas, notably at the [[Institut Supérieur de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace]] (ISAE), [[Supélec]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supelec.fr/fi/c_127563/droit-des-activites-spatiales-et-des-telecommunications.html Supelec - Formation initiale - Droit des activités spatiales et des télécommunications - Supelec FI].

IDEST has also trained professors in the space and telecommunication law lecturing both in France and overseas.

In 2011, a convention was signed between the [[Institut Supérieur de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace]] and the [[Paris-Sud 11 University|University of Paris-Sud]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.idest-paris.org/fr/signature-d’une-convention-entre-l’université-paris-sud-11-et-l’isae-supaéro-260&lt;/ref&gt; for the development and cooperation between the two establishments in space law.

== Meetings and encounters with IDEST ==

=== European Days ===

With its international network of researchers and former students, IDEST regularly organizes European days within the [[European Union]]. These European days reunite universities and local French practitioners in the same town over two years in order to reinforce academic and professional cooperation by a combination of national legal experiences and the cultural approaches in [[law]].

IDEST's first European days took place at [[Sibiu]] in Romania concerning Europe in the information society (2007) and the Regulation of the telecommunication market (2009). The second IDEST European days took place at Budapest, Hungary on Competition and the regulation of the telecommunication market (2010) and Competition in the network industries (2011).

=== World Telecommunication and Information Society Day conferences ===

[http://www.itu.int/wtisd/index-fr.html World Telecommunication and Information Society Day] was created by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) with the goal of increasing public awareness about the use of information technology in the economic and social domains, as ways to reduce the digital divide.

17 May marks the anniversary of the signing of the first International Telegraph Convention&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/wtisd/index-fr.html Journée mondiale des télécommunications et de la société de l'information de 2012, 17 mai]. Itu.int (2012-04-03). Retrieved on 2014-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt; and the creation of the International Telecommunication Union, the reason for this date being chosen as World Telecommunication and Information Society Day. In this framework, IDEST organizes every year legal conferences reuniting the most renowned specialists in telecommunication law with lawyers and other legal practitioners to confront often highly complex questions in relation to the development of electronic communications networks and services.

In 2010, the conference’s chosen theme was ''The New Regulatory Framework of Telecommunications'' after the 2009 Review in regards to the European Regulation’s transposition into French law. The 2011 conference was on ''High Speed Broadband for All''.

== Contracts and Research ==

=== National Contracts ===

Since its creation, IDEST has obtained several national research contracts, notably from the [[CNES|National Center for Space Studies]] (CNES) in the framework of the elaboration of a Bill on space operations, in which IDEST was strongly involved. IDEST equally signed a major contract with the Ile de France region to develop the mobility of students and researchers in the telecommunications law between the University of Paris-Sud and universities in the town of [[Budapest]]. In 2011, following the signing of two contracts, one for the French National Frequencies Agency (ANFR), the other for the [[CNES|National Center for Space Studies]], IDEST is currently working on a fact-finding mission based on the law of frequencies. IDEST is also currently working on an assessment of spatial governance in Europe for the French strategic analysis center, linked to the French Prime Minister.

=== European contracts ===

Following two research contracts with the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) in the domain of planetary protection and space-based solar power stations, IDEST won two major projects for the European Union: The European Twinning Project UA/06/PCA/OT/05 Boosting Ukrainian Space Cooperation with the European Union, resulting in a series of meetings organized in Kiev between June 2008 and February 2010; and the Collaborative Project Consent (the 7th Framework Programme) relating to the protection of personal data in social networks. IDEST has also worked in close collaboration with the Romanian authorities in the transposition of the European law of telecommunications into Romanian national law.

=== International Contracts ===

Amongst its international research contracts, IDEST has carried out research for [[Lockheed Martin]] (USA) on the protection of spatial assets, and for the State of [[Singapore]] on [[space tourism]].

== Partnerships ==

=== Universities/Research Centers ===

IDEST has developed strategic partnerships with several universities in France and overseas: [[Institut Supérieur de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace]] (Toulouse, France), Space Policy Institute (Washington, USA), the International Centre of Space Law (Kiev, Ukraine), [[Pázmány Péter Catholic University]] (Budapest, Hungary), [[University of Jaén]] (Jaén, Spain), [[Harbin Institute of Technology]] (Harbin, China) and [[University La Sapienza]] (Rome, Italy).

=== The Professional Environment ===

Since its creation, IDEST has formed solid relations in the space and telecommunication professional milieus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idest-paris.org/fr/partenaires-m2-droit-des-activités-spatiales-et-des-télécommunications-idest-61&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute was created under the impetus of the [[CNES|National Center for Space Studies]] and the [[European Space Agency]], and its activities are supported by many prestigious operators, including [[Eutelsat]], [[EADS]], Marsh and [[Thales Group|Thales]]. In the domain of telecommunications, the French Regulator of the Electronic Communications and Postal Sectors (ARCEP) and the French Regulatory Authority for Frequencies (ANFr) also participated in defining the research activities of the Institute which today benefits from privileged links with the France Télécom Group. Finally, several law firms work in collaboration with IDEST, including [[Bird &amp; Bird]], [[Ernst &amp; Young]], [[Gide Loyrette Nouel]], Iteanu &amp; Associés, and YGMA.

== Master's degree in Space Activities and Telecommunications Law ==

Being the first qualification in the world to link the study of the [[Space law|space activities law]] with the telecommunications law, this degree was set up with the support of professional bodies to meet the needs of rapidly expanding industries looking for highly qualified graduates. The content of the Master was developed in partnership with the major companies and institutions in the space/aeronautical and telecommunication sectors.

Every year a steering committee agrees on the curriculum to be covered in order to respond to the evolving needs of the space and telecommunications markets. Core subjects are complemented by practical seminars and a long-term work placement (in [[France]] or overseas).  Regular and lasting contact with the labor market is gained through an educational team consisting mainly of practitioners (70% of the teaching body), lectures run by future potential employers, lectures given on the premises of companies (50%) and prestigious institutions, visits and professional voyages both in France and overseas, and through an international network of alumni and the course’s partners.

=== An International Degree ===

The course encompasses [[Europe]] and the wider world through teaching which combines both national and transnational approaches to issues. Lessons are held in French and English by a multicultural team of lecturers (9 nationalities). Classes consist of 50% overseas students (since 2002, the Master has welcomed 264 students coming from 61 different nationalities) all of whom participate in a large number of international events.&lt;ref name="World Telecommunication and Information Society Day 2011"/&gt;

=== An Interdisciplinary Degree ===

The course has been designed for future career prospects in mind, by linking law to other disciplines – the sciences, economics, management, and [[political sciences]]. The interdisciplinary character of the Master’s teaching staff and students facilitates the graduates’ integration within businesses and public institutions through their complete and in-depth understanding of the issues to be tackled and their real ability to communicate with all departments and parties concerned, and notably with the technical departments.

=== Sponsoring every year ===
Every class has a sponsor who assists the students all year round. The class is named after the sponsor.

The '''Joropo''' or '''Música llanera''' is a  [[musical style]] resembling the [[fandango]], and an accompanying [[dance]]. It has [[African music|African]], Native South American and [[Culture of Europe#Art|European]] influences and originated in the [[orinoco]] plains called [[Los Llanos (South America)|"Los Llanos"]] of what is now [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, John and Horn, David.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=liV8AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA400 Bloomsbury Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World, Volume 9: Genres: Caribbean and Latin]'', pp. 400-402 (Bloomsbury Publishing 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=y su música: Canciones y fiestas llaneras |author=José Portaccio Fontalvo |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TcVaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=origen+del+joropo+venezuela&amp;dq=origen+del+joropo+venezuela}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a fundamental [[genre]] of ''música criolla'' ([[creole language|creole]] music). It is also the most popular "folk rhythm": the well-known song "[[Alma Llanera]]" is a joropo, considered the unofficial national anthem of Venezuela.

In 1882 it became Venezuela's national dance. Formerly, the Spanish word '''joropo''' meant "a party", but now it has come to mean a type of music and dance that identifies Venezuelans. In the 18th century the [[llanero]]s started using the word “joropo” instead of the word "fandango", which was the word used at the time for party and dance.

== Venezuela ==

=== Central Joropo ===

Propio of the central states of Venezuelay, like Aragua and Miranda, Carabobo eastern and northern Guarico. The central joropo or tuyero (by practiced on the banks of the Tuy River) is sung accompanied by harp (sometimes replaced by guitar) and maracas. Unlike strings náilon the llanera harp, harp central joropo also uses metal strings, which gived her uniquena sound. The singer central joropo is the same as playing the maracas, dancing so they put just two performers: the harpist (or rather "arpisto", as they like to call themselves), and the maw (singer-maraquero). The central joropo him the same considerations are applied around the passage and hit burrowing joropo, except speed, which is slightly lower. Another important caveat is that the central joropo revolt, kind of colonial origin is present, basically consists of a chain of musical sections of fixed forms, in the same tone, as a Baroque suite, without interruption, but with twists surprising. The movements of revolt are called passage; input or call Yaguazo, Yaguazo, and Marisela Guabina input. Sometimes they can call Marisela added to them, and even a small coda. The revolt is thus equivalent to the batch or shift dance, and its extension is probably the reason for his gradual disuse, being replaced by the execution of the parts in isolation. The arrangement of these sections is of sequential nature, unlike blows Llanero Joropo, having a cyclic condition. The most characteristic part of tuyero joropo, the Tuyera Revuelta consists of four sections: the exhibition (passage), development (yaguazo and guabina), the instrumental coda named Marisela, and an end known as "monkey call." They are central joropo own beats flowers and quitapesares.Los most famous passages tuyeros are The Hermit Mario Diaz, Dawn tuyero of Cipriano Moreno and Pablo Hidalgo, and The Cat enmochilado Fulgencio Aquino. Caraquenos and central musicians adopted the central joropo as inspiration for his works, as in the case of Marisela Sebastián Díaz Peña, the Alma Llanera, Pedro Elias Gutierrez, valse Quitapesares Carlos Bonet and even Creole Sonatina Juan Bautista Square. The central joropo lyrics are sly, sardonic nature, in contrast to the forceful and violent own burrowing joropo, whose contrapunteos end up not infrequently in sets and fights.

=== East joropo ===
Characteristic of the northeastern region of Venezuela, specifically of Sucre, Nueva Esparta and Anzoategui and Monagas Northern states. In this particular type of joropo melodic instrument par excellence is the [[mandolin]]. However, the eastern mandolin (eight nylon strings), violin, harmonica and a small accordion called "cuereta" also have a major role in the oriental musical folklore. The so-called "joropo with refrain" consists of two sections: the first section or "hit" is traditionally a fixed melody in {{music|time|3|4}} rhythm that is repeated two or more times; the second section or "chorus" is an improvised melody over a fixed harmonic rhythm cycle is {{music|time|6|8}}. Note that in the eastern joropo, cuatro and maracas are executed in a much freer and more complex than in the rest of Venezuelans joropos way. Likewise, it is important to mention that the musical tradition of the eastern region of Venezuela has many other forms besides the eastern joropo.

=== Guayanés joropo ===
Product of the interaction of llaneros and eastern Bolivar state in Venezuela , specifically in Ciudad Bolivar. It is executed with the Guayanese mandolin (eight metal strings) , cuatro and maracas. Six Guayanés , the Josa and Rompeluto highlight among the most famous Guyanese joropos.

=== Joropo tucuyero ===
Characteristic from Aragua and Miranda , and Carabobo eastern and northern Guárico (Venezuela) . While burrowing joropo is intoned with llanera harp or mandolin, cuatro and maracas , the tuyero is sung with harp, maracas and crop. At the same time , while the harp tuyera uses metal and nylon strings, the harp burrowing joropo all strings are nylon . Another distinguishing point between the tuyero and burrowing joropo is the fact that in the first, singing is the same as running the maracas. The most characteristic of tuyero folklore piece, "The tuyera revolt", it consists of four sections : the exhibition (passage) , development (yaguaso and guabina) , the instrumental coda (called "Marisela") and an end known as "the call monkey". The most famous passages are tuyeros "El ermitaño" of Mario Diaz, "Amanecer tuyero" of Cipriano Moreno and Pablo Hidalgo and "El gato enmochilado" of Fulgencio Aquino.

=== Golpe Tocuyano or larense joropo ===
Hailing from the West Central region of Venezuela , mainly states Lara, Portuguesa (Portuguese saw) and Yaracuy . Played by a variety of stringed instruments (Four , Middle Five , Five and Six) together with Tambora and Maracas produce a very particular and unique sound among other Venezuelans joropos . Celebrity tocuyanos hits are "Amalia Rosa" , "Montilla" , "Gavilan Tocuyano" and "Ah mundo! Barquisimeto" , "Los Dos Gavilanes" , "The Fright" , "Pajarillo Tocuyano" , "Garrote Encabullao" , "Fire Fire", among many others. Dancing in the number of members is six couples.

=== Quirpa ===
Legend says that this type of joropo is named after Jose Antonio Oquendo , who was nicknamed "Quirpa" . Burrowing harpist of the late nineteenth century who died of a stab wound . The quirpa uses ternary and tertiary bars and sometimes combined, with shifts of rhythm and musical accents .

=== Joropo llanero ===
Until the mid-twentieth century, and with regard to the region of the plains of Venezuela, the joropo word referring to a social event almost a fair- for a period that could vary from a few hours and even a full week. There participating local people or coming from various places, generally attracted by trade, where the central event it was the music, dance and contrapunteos. Burrowing joropo music was provided by a basic set consisting of harp, cuatro, maracas and singing. If there was no harp, it was replaced by a [[mandolin]] or violin The genera of burrowing joropo are two: Passage: the more sedate, and generally known author. Its speed is approximately 152 [[beats per minute|bpm]], and harmonic structure free, usually in two parts; Y Hit:. Anonymous author, although many of these strokes are attributed to composers of the early twentieth century The coup complies with certain recognizable melodic turns on fixed characteristic harmonic patterns that define its type. Singing is syllabic, that is, to each note of the melody corresponds to a syllable. The verses are octosyllabic and sometimes five syllables, all under contrafactum, ie the replacement of new texts in existing melodies. The stroke speed is greater than the passage (176–192 bpm). When the song is a story of an event or fantasy called the RAN, equivalent to the old Spanish romance. The blows are the basis for the buzzes or hums contrapunteo that between two or more opponents. The most common are the six law (major key), the bird (in a minor key), six numbering or six numerao (with transport augmentations in fourth grade), the Kirpa or quirpa, Gavan (in modes major and minor), the San Rafael, carnival, Chipola, the catira, the buzz buzzing, among the best known. The entreverao is the aggregation of two strokes, with a modulation of each other, usually to sing two people with different tessitura voice (baritone and tenor). As for the steps of the most frequent dance are valsiao, escobillao and footwork, in which, unlike the central joropo, feet off the floor rise. Family tree of performers llanera harp in Venezuela since the late nineteenth century to the present

== Bailando ==
The Joropo is played with the ''arpa llanera'' ([[harp]]), ''[[bandola]]'', ''[[Cuatro (instrument)|cuatro]]'', and ''[[maraca]]s'' (ibid), making use of [[polyrhythmic]] patterns, especially of [[hemiola]], and alternation of {{music|time|3|4}} and {{music|time|6|8}} [[meter (music)|meter]]s. It was originally played, most often also sung, by the ''llaneros'', the Venezuelan ''[[Los Llanos, Venezuela|Llanos]]'', (plains), and thus also called '''música llanera''' (ibid).

The [[singer]] and the [[harp]] or bandola may perform the main [[melody]] while a cuatro performs the [[accompaniment]], adding its characteristic rhythmic, sharp percussive effect. The cuatro and the bandola are four-stringed instruments which are descendants of the Spanish [[guitar]]. The only real percussion instruments used are the [[maraca]]s. Besides the genre and dance, the name ''joropo'' also means the performance, the event or occasion of performance.

==Dancing==
The Joropo is the most famous dance in Venezuela and is also the national dance. It is adopted and still uses the hand turn, the movement of the feet, and waltz turns. First, the partners dance a type of waltz holding each other tightly. Then they stand facing each other and make small steps forward and backward as if sweeping the floor. Lastly they hold each other's arms, and the woman does sweeping steps while the man stomps his feet along with the music’s rhythm.

==Evolution and more refined forms==
In modern times, several other instruments have been added to playing various parts in Joropo performances, for instance, guitar, [[flute]], [[clarinet]], [[piano]], and up to a complete symphony [[orchestra]] playing Joropo arrangements.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Coronation Street'' home video releases}}
{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}
Many selected episodes, specially produced episodes, and [[feature length]] spin-offs of the [[British television]] soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]'' have been released on video and DVD.

==1980s==

===''The Magic of Coronation Street''===
In 1982, a VHS video entitled ''The Magic of Coronation Street – Distant Memories 1960 -1964'' was released by [[Granada]] Video. Its running time was 172 minutes and it featured six episodes of the programme, together with specially shot sequences featuring [[Annie Walker (Coronation Street)|Annie Walker]], [[Elsie Tanner]] and [[Len Fairclough]]. Later, ''The Magic of Coronation Street'' was released as two separate packages, each containing three episodes, by [[Vestron Video]].

Episodes featured:

''Part one:'' Episode 1 (9 December 1960); Gas Main Leak (9 February 1961); Christmas Day 1961

''Part two:'' Elsie discovers that Bill Gregory is married (11 July 1962); ''This is Your Life'' (12 December 1962); Cinderella (23 December 1964)

===''The Jubilee Years''===
In 1985, to celebrate the serial's 25th anniversary, two video tapes were released (again on [[Vestron Video]]), entitled ''The Jubilee Years – Part One'' and ''The Jubilee Years – Part Two''. These featured a previously unseen character Alice Hughes revisiting the Street to recall characters like Ena and Elsie and catch up on 'current happenings' with Ken and Deirdre Barlow, Betty Turpin and Hilda Ogden.

===''The Life and Loves of Elsie Tanner''===
In 1987, ''The Life and Loves of Elsie Tanner'' was released, with the characters of Mike Baldwin, Emily Bishop and Elsie's daughter, Linda, recalling Elsie's time on the Street. In this production it is hinted that Elsie has died, an event not referred to in the series proper until 2011, when her son [[Dennis Tanner]] said she and her husband Bill Gregory died in 2004 after a car crash in Portugal (Emily tells Linda that she was "sorry to hear about her mother"). [[Pat Phoenix]], who played Elsie, had died the previous year.  So many may infer that this one off special is not at all a part of the series canon.

==1990s==

===30th-anniversary set===
In 1990, as a celebration for the serial's 30th anniversary, 10 video tapes were released by Windsong Video Productions, each featuring four episodes from a specific year and introduced by someone who was close to the stories that year (for example, Betty Turpin's husband Cyril died in 1974, therefore [[Betty Driver]] hosted the 1974 tape). These tapes were initially distributed by Granada Video for viewing in the UK only, but were reissued on NTSC tape (a year later) for viewing in the US and Canada.

===''The Cruise''===
In 1995, ''Coronation Street – The Cruise'' was released on VHS to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the show. ''The Cruise'' was the first [[straight-to-video]] tape, released in 1995 and featured a storyline aboard the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2|QE2]]. The spin-off proved controversial as although the cover claimed that the special was exclusive-to-video, only a few months after it was released it was shown on ITV on 24 March 1996. This provoked many complaints which resulted in Granada (who had not sanctioned the airing of the special but were over-ruled by ITV) being ordered by the [[Independent Television Commission]] to make a public apology as well as sending a letter of apology along with a free paperback book as a gesture of goodwill to each complainant. Subsequent releases have included carefully worded statements concerning future television broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0000575WH|title=Coronation Street: Feature Length Special [VHS] [1995]

===''Viva Las Vegas''===
A United States-set special, ''[[Coronation Street: Viva Las Vegas!]]'' follows Jack and Vera and other characters to America. It was released on [[VHS]] in 1999 and screened on ITV the following year. Written by [[Russell T Davies]], the special featured a guest cameo by actor [[Neville Buswell]], who was then living in America, who briefly reprised his role as [[Ray Langton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00004CUYU?keywords=coronation+street+viva+las+vegas|title=Coronation Street: Viva Las Vegas!

===Time-Life releases===
Many VHS tapes were made in the 1990s for the British market, from mail-order company [[Time-Life]] Distribution, with each tape consisting of a compilation of footage featuring a particular character (for example, Gail, Rita, the Duckworths). They were made only in [[PAL]] format and not distributed in the United States or Canada.

There were 20 videos in total and they each came with a printed signed postcard with the characters featured.

'''''Major Dad''''' is an American sitcom created by Richard C. Okie and John G. Stephens, developed by [[Earl Pomerantz]], that originally ran from 1989 to 1993 on [[CBS]], starring [[Gerald McRaney]] as Major John D. MacGillis and [[Shanna Reed]] as his wife Polly. The cast also includes [[Beverly Archer]], [[Matt Mulhern]], [[Jon Cypher]], [[Marisa Ryan]], [[Nicole Dubuc]], and Chelsea Hertford.

==Synopsis==
The first season is set at the fictional Camp Singleton (meant to represent [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton]]),{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} where hard-charging [[United States Marine Corps]] Major John D. "Mac" MacGillis is commander of the infantry training school's acquisition division. MacGillis's life is changed when he falls in love with a liberal journalist, Polly Cooper. The show follows Mac in his work life, where he deals with Lt. Eugene Holowachuk (Matt Mulhern), Sgt. Byron James (Marlon Archey), and Merilee Gunderson ([[Whitney Kershaw]]), as well as his home life, as he learns to live with Polly's three daughters, Elizabeth, Robin, and Casey.

At the beginning of the second season, the MacGillis family moves to Camp Hollister (based on [[Marine Corps Base Quantico]]), where Mac must adapt to the role of staff secretary (or, "staff weenie") and the crazy antics of Commanding General Marcus C. Craig, Aide-de-Camp 1st Lt. Eugene Holowachuk (who transferred with Major MacGillis from Camp Singleton), and Gunnery Sgt. Alva "Gunny" Bricker, the General's secretary, a no-nonsense woman, who despite her brusque nature and unprepossessing physical appearance, is the target of many enthusiastic (and [[Unseen Character|unseen]]) suitors.

Character development increased during the second season, such as the revelation that MacGillis is a former member of the [[United States Marine Corps Silent Drill Platoon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13249">'''Meta-reference''' is a special type of [[self-reference]] that can occur in all media or medial artefacts, for instance literature, film, painting, TV series, comic strips, or video games. It includes all references to, or comments on, a specific medium, medial artefact, or the media in general. These references and comments originate from a logically higher level (a 'meta-level') within any given artefact, and draw attention to -- or invite reflection about -- media-related issues (e.g. the production, performance, or reception) of said artefact, specific other artefacts (as in [[parody]]), or to parts, or the entirety, of the medial system. It is, therefore, the recipient's awareness of an artefact's medial quality that distinguishes meta-reference from more general forms of [[self-reference]]. Thus, meta-reference triggers media-awareness within the recipient, who, in turn "becomes conscious of both the medial (or 'fictional' in the sense of artificial and, sometimes in addition, 'invented') status of the work" as well as "the fact that media-related phenomena are at issue, rather than (hetero-)references to the world outside the media."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies.|last=Wolf|first=Werner|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although certain devices, such as [[Mise en abyme (in literature and other media)|mise en abyme]], may be conducive to meta-reference, they are not necessarily metareferential themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies|last=Wolf|first=Werner|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, innately metareferential devices, such as [[metalepsis]], are to be seen as special cases of meta-reference. The terms meta-reference and [[metalepsis]] can, therefore, not be used synonymously.

== History of the concept and the term ==
While meta-reference as a concept is not a new phenomenon and can be observed in very early works of art and media not tied to specific purposes (e.g. Homer's invocation of the muses at the beginning of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' in order to deliver the epic better), the term itself is relatively new.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies|last=Werner|first=Wolf|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier discussions of metareferential issues often opt for more specific terminology tied to the respective discipline. Notable discussions of meta-reference include, but are not limited to, William H. Gass's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fiction and the Figures of Life|last=Gass|first=William|publisher=Knopf|year=1970|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert Scholes's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scholes|first=Robert|date=1970|title=Metafiction|url=|journal=Iowa Review|volume=1|pages=100-115|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; exploration of [[metafiction]], Victor Stoichita's examination of early modern meta-painting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Self-Aware Image. An Insight into Early Modern Meta-Painting|last=Stoichita|first=Victor|publisher=Studies in Baroque Art|year=2015|isbn=978-1909400115|location=Antwerp|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lionel Abel's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metatheatre. A New View of Dramatic Form.|last=Abel|first=Lionel|publisher=Hill &amp; Wang|year=1963|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigation of [[metatheatre]]. In the context of drama, meta-reference has also become colloquially known as the breaking of the [[fourth wall]]. The first study to underscore the problem resulting from the lack of cohesive terminology, as well as the necessity to acknowledge metareference as transmedial and trans-generic phenomenon, was published in 2007 by Hauthal et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/155834217|title=Metaisierung in Literatur und anderen Medien : theoretische Grundlagen, historische Perspektiven, Metagattungen, Funktionen|date=2007|publisher=De Gruyter|others=Hauthal, Janine.|isbn=3110199459|location=Berlin|oclc=155834217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publications by Nöth and Bishara&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/471132600|title=Self-reference in the media|date=2007|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|others=Bishara, Nina, 1977-, Nöth, Winfried.|isbn=3110194643|location=Berlin|oclc=471132600}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Wolf&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/436342321|title=Metareference across media : theory and case studies|date=2009|publisher=Rodopi|others=Wolf, Werner, 1955-, Bantleon, Katharina., Thoss, Jeff., Bernhart, Walter.|isbn=9789042026704|location=Amsterdam|oclc=436342321}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed suit, raised similar concerns, included case studies from various media, coined and helped establish the more uniform umbrella term meta-reference as define above.

== Examples ==
While every medium has the potential for meta-reference, some media can transport meta-reference more easily than others. Media that can easily realise its meta-referential potential includes, for instance, literature, painting, and film. Although music can be meta-referential even outside the confines of lyrics, meta-reference in music is much harder to create or detect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies|last=Michaelsen|first=René|date=|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|editor-last=Wolf|editor-first=Werner|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=235-259|chapter=Exploring Metareference in Instrumental Music -- The Case of Robert Schumann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Self-Reference in the Media|last=Wolf|first=Werner|date=|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|year=2007|isbn=978-3-11-019464-7|editor-last=Nöth|editor-first=Winfried|location=Berlin|pages=303-325|chapter=Metafiction and Metamusic: Exploring the Limits of Metareference}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music, therefore, would be a less typical medium for the occurrence of meta-reference. Nöth argues in this context that although non-verbal media can be the home of meta-reference, the contained meta-reference can only be implicit because non-verbal media can only show similarites, but never point directly (or explicitly) to meta-referential elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies|last=Nöth|first=Winfried|date=|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|editor-last=Wolf|editor-first=Werner|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=889-121|chapter=Metareference from a Semiotic Perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, argue that meta-reference is explicit as long as it is clear.

=== Literature ===
John Fowles begins chapter 13 of his novel ''The French Lieutenant's Woman'' with the words&lt;blockquote&gt;This ''story'' I am ''telling'' is all ''imagination''. These ''characters'' I create never existed outside my own mind. If I have pretended until now to know my ''characters''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' mind and innermost thoughts, it is because I am ''writing'' in [...] a ''convention'' universally accepted at the time of my ''story'': that the ''novelist'' stands next to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The French Lieutenant's Woman|last=Fowels|first=John|publisher=Vintage|year=2005|isbn=978-0-099-49707-3|location=London|pages=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; [emphases added]&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is an example of explicit meta-reference because the text draws attention to the fact that the novel the recipient is reading is merely a fiction created by the author. It also foregrounds the convention that readers of realist fiction accept the presence of an all-knowing narrator, and breaks it by allowing the narrator to take centre stage which invites meta-reflections by the recipient.

=== Film ===
''[[The Truman Show]]'' is a movie that contains a high degree of meta-reference. Truman, the protagonist, is unaware that he is part of a reality TV show, but the audience knows about the artificiality of both Truman's life and, by extension, the movie that is being watched. This is underscored by putting emphasis on the production process of the fictional reality TV show, which makes the audience aware of the same features being used in the movie at the time of watching. Further examples of meta-reference in the movie include spotlights falling from the sky seemingly out of the blue, or a raincloud which is curiously only raining on Truman following him around on Seahaven Beach. Both instances point to the artificiality of Truman's life as well as the film itself.

=== Painting ===
[[File:Edouard Manet - The Balcony - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|214x214px|
Manet, ''The Balcony''
]]
An example of meta-reference in painting is ''Manet's Balcony'' by [[René Magritte]]. It comments on another painting, [[The Balcony (painting)|''The Balcony'']] by [[Édouard Manet]], by mimicking both the setting of the balcony as well as the poses of the depicted people, but places them in coffins. Thus, the recipient's attention is drawn to the fact that not only are the people in the painting long dead and only still 'alive' in the representation, but arguably also that the artist ([[Édouard Manet|Manet]]) and the [[Impressionism|impressionist]] painting style are just as dead as the portrayed individuals. Furthermore, it is foregrounded that the [[Impressionism|impressionist]] painting style is just a style that may be copied, which further emphasises the fact that both works are only paintings created in a specific way.

A [[skill toy]] of Asian origin, the '''meteor''' consists of a [[rope]], usually between 5 and 8 feet long, with weights attached to either end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|quote=The Meteor hammer often referred to simply as 'meteor', is an ancient Chinese weapon, consisting at its most basic level of two weights connected by a rope or chain. One of the flexible or 'soft' weapons, it is referred to by many different names worldwide, dependent upon region, construction and intended use. Other names in use include liu xing chui, dai chui, flying hammer or dragon's fist. It belongs to the broader class of chain weapons.
|url=http://www.dube.com/meteor/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225032104/http://www.dube.com/meteor/ |archivedate=2010-02-25 |title=Meteors}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tricks are performed by swinging, wrapping and throwing the meteor about the body.

== Origins ==
{{expand section|date=August 2014}}
The meteor is based on the Chinese [[meteor hammer]], a bolo-like weapon made from stones and rope. Approximately 1500 years ago, this hunting weapon began its transition into a performing art. The Chinese circus tradition has featured meteors with brightly colored balls, glass bowls filled with colored water, or pans of flaming oil in place of the stone weights.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Rhys (1999). ''The Meteor Book''. Flaming Sparrow. {{ISBN|9780943292267}}.{{verify source|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Shaolin schools, the water meteor made a useful training aid once a student had gained a certain level of skill. These water meteors consisted of a length of chain with two inward facing bowls for heads. These bowls were then filled with water (or occasionally, sand), in order to train a smooth technique and gain control over the weapon. When the meteor was spinning fast enough, the water would be held in the bowls, with the intention being not to spill any. In China where this technique was originally developed, once a student had practiced for several years and gained mastery of the meteor, then they could progress to fire meteors. Cirque du Soleil's Varekai features water meteors as an act.

== Fire meteor ==
The traditional fire meteors were essentially the same as the water meteors, except that instead of containing water, the bowls were instead filled with fuel. This fuel was then lit, and the meteor spun exactly as before, looking like a pair of real harnessed meteors. It is also a dangerous weapon to behold, because one slight mistake could send flaming fuel around in a radius in excess of 20 feet.

Modern fire meteors are commonly made similar to the monkey fist meteors, which is made of kevlar, cotton or other natural fiber rope, then connected by chains or rope; also made of kevlar, cotton or natural fiber. The natural fiber or kevlar rope is necessary as synthetic ropes will melt rapidly, and the natural fiber ropes will also need to be replaced often as well. The kevlar rope works much better as it is designed to take stress and resist high temperatures.

== Freestyle meteor ==
Freestyle Meteor refers to the use of the meteor weapon (used in martial arts) in a more visually stunning manner, rather than a combative way. This makes freestyle meteor one of the flow arts.

"'''Miss Atomic Bomb'''" is a song from American [[Rock music|rock]] band [[The Killers]]. The track was sent to mainstream radio on October 23, 2012 as the second single taken from the band's fourth studio album, ''[[Battle Born (album)|Battle Born]]''.  It topped the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' Readers' Poll for The Best Song of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-the-best-songs-of-2012-20121219/1-the-killers-miss-atomic-bomb-0724465 |title=1. The Killers - 'Miss Atomic Bomb' &amp;#124; Readers' Poll: The Best Songs of 2012 |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2012-12-19 |accessdate=2017-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been remixed by [[The Chainsmokers]].&lt;ref&gt;https://soundcloud.com/thechainsmokers/miss-atomic-bomb-the/sets&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
The band released two music videos for "Miss Atomic Bomb", with a tour video directed by Giorgio Testi released on November 2, which captures footage of the band performing in the UK while on their Battle Born World Tour.  The second, and official video was released over one month later, on December 11.  The video was directed by [[Warren Fu]], who had directed ''Battle Born'''s first single, "Runaways". 

Part live action and part animation, "Miss Atomic Bomb" has been dubbed "the epic companion to Mr. Brightside", and the video continues the love triangle depicted in the 2004 hit "[[Mr. Brightside]]" music video.  "Miss Atomic Bomb" sees actress [[Izabella Miko]] and actor [[Eric Roberts]] reprise their roles from the "Mr. Brightside" video. As "Miss Atomic Bomb" is considered to be a companion to "Mr. Brightside", the premise of the music video is similar but broader.

===Synopsis===
The music video begins with an elderly man sitting alone in his trailer home, reflecting on his past when he notices a letter on his doormat. The memories take form in animation, featuring the man in his youth, depicted as an animated [[Brandon Flowers]], in the company of his band (animated versions of [[Dave Keuning|Keuning]], [[Mark Stoermer|Stoermer]], and [[Ronnie Vannucci Jr.|Vannucci]]). He is watching a young girl's ([[Izabella Miko]]) dance recital from his garage when she notices him observing her, before they are interrupted by her teacher who draws the curtains. However, he later seeks her out at her home, and it is presumed that they fall in love with each other.

One night, the young woman has finished a performance but grows tired of her teacher and runs off from the stage to seek out Flowers. He is happy to see her when she finds him; and, he takes her through a motorbike ride through the desert. However, the paranoid jealousy that Flowers bears begins to surface as he catches sight of a faceless stranger in the desert, which is likely to be a figment of his imagination. Later, when the woman is shown to have won the Miss Atomic Bomb pageant alongside her dance partner ([[Eric Roberts]]), a surly Flowers who is performing at the pageant with his band, becomes more resentful and believes that the man is in love with his girlfriend. Akin to the events in "Mr Brightside", the imaginary stranger in the desert forms its identity as the dance partner and Flowers makes his way towards the young woman's house in a troubled state. He arrives there on New Year's Eve in Las Vegas to propose to her, but he catches sight of the car that her dance partner owns and becomes certain that she is having an affair with him. He leaves the engagement ring on the ground and walks away. As he walks through Las Vegas, he has hallucinations of women who are kissing other men as his girlfriend kissing her dance partner. Flowers then ages visibly and heads for his trailer home in the desert as he is plagued by visions of what would have been his future with the young woman.

The video then transitions to real-life acting, showing the elderly man in the present opening a letter from his then-girlfriend. Glimpses of the writing reveal that she was uncertain about what had happened the night that he had walked away from her on New Year's Eve. The memories then repeat in live acting, with the young woman tearfully holding up the engagement ring that he had left behind and recalling the night that she had found him in the desert. The young woman is shown to be dancing with her partner in her apartment, although Flowers imagines him kissing her behind the curtains. It is revealed that all the events which occurred from Flowers' point of view were fictional and that it was indeed his paranoid jealousy which overcame him. As the New Year's countdown ends, the young woman rushes out onto her balcony in excitement, only to see Flowers on the floor and the man walking away bitterly, leaving her in confusion. The last shots of the music video show the letter disintegrating and the elderly man looking at a faded photo of the young woman on his shelf.

[[Image:ilsashewolf.jpg|right|thumb|150px|''[[Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS]]''   is considered the quintessential ''Nazisploitation'' film.]]
'''Nazi exploitation''' (also '''Nazisploitation''') is a subgenre of [[exploitation film]] and [[sexploitation|sexploitation film]] that involves [[Nazism|Nazis]] committing sex crimes, often as camp or prison overseers during [[World War II]]. Most follow the [[Women in prison film|women in prison formula]], only relocated to a concentration camp, extermination camp, or Nazi [[brothel]], and with an added emphasis on [[Sadomasochism|sadism]], gore, and degradation. The most infamous and influential title (which set the standards of the genre) is a Canadian production, ''[[Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS]]'' (1974). Its surprise success and sequels led European filmmakers, mostly in [[Italy]], to produce dozens of similar films. While the ''Ilsa'' series were profitable, the other films were mostly box-office flops, and the genre all but vanished by the mid-1980s.

In Italy, these films are known as part of the "il sadiconazista" cycle, which were inspired by such [[art-house]] films as [[Liliana Cavani]]'s ''[[The Night Porter]]'' (1974), [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s ''[[Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom]]'' (1975), and [[Tinto Brass]]'s ''[[Salon Kitty (film)|Salon Kitty]]'' (1976).&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Howard ''Cinema Italiano'' I. B. Tauris; First Edition (August 30, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent directors of the genre include [[Paolo Solvay]] (''[[La Bestia in Calore]]'', also known as ''The Beast in Heat'' and ''SS Hell Camp''), [[Cesare Canevari]] (''[[Last Orgy of the Third Reich]]'', also known as ''L'ultima orgia del III Reich'', ''Gestapo's Last Orgy'' and ''Caligula Reincarnated as Hitler''), and [[Alain Payet]] (''[[Train spécial pour SS]]'', also known as ''Special Train for Hitler'' and ''Helltrain''), all from 1977.

==History==
Italian directors pioneered a blend of sexual imagery and Nazi themes. This can be found as early as 1945 in ''[[Rome, Open City]]'' by [[Roberto Rossellini]]. Another Rossellini film, ''[[Germany, Year Zero]]'' (1948), connects Nazism with homosexuality and pedophilia.  The controversial art-house production ''[[The Damned (1969 film)|The Damned]]'' (1969), directed by [[Luchino Visconti]], about the rise and fall of a German industrialist family in the Third Reich, is also a major influence on the genre. The film features an orgy of homosexual SA-Men and depicts one of the main characters as a troubled multiple pervert posing in a transvestite outfit, molesting little girls, and committing incest with his own mother. 

Other early examples that combine sexual themes and Nazism include the West German productions ''[[Des Teufels General]]'' (''The Devil's General'') (1955) by [[Helmut Käutner]] and ''[[Lebensborn (film)|Lebensborn]]'' (''[[Ordered to Love]]'') (1961). The French art-house film ''[[Vice and Virtue]]'' (1963), directed by [[Roger Vadim]], is a stylized retelling of the [[Marquis de Sade]]'s ''[[Justine (de Sade novel)|Justine]]'' set during the Nazi occupation of France. This is a subtle and satirical rendering that only hints at the sexual depravity explicit in the original novel.

The critically acclaimed 1964 film ''[[The Pawnbroker (film)|The Pawnbroker]]'' includes a [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]
scene showing nude women kept in a concentration camp brothel. The Italian [[Giallo]] thriller ''[[In the Folds of the Flesh]]'' (also known as ''Nelle pieghe della carne'', 1970) has a similar flashback sequence with unrealistically attractive nude women being herded into a Nazi gas chamber. However, the earliest full-blown [[sexploitation]] film set in a Nazi camp was ''[[Love Camp 7]]'' (1969). The film can also be viewed as a precursor to the similarly themed [[women in prison film|women in prison]] genre which was initially popularized by [[Roger Corman]]'s ''[[The Big Doll House]]'' (1971).

''Love Camp 7'' established the pattern for the many films that followed.  The story resembles a "true adventure" pulp yarn from a [[men's adventure]] magazine of the period (''Man's Story, Men Today, World of Men'', ''Man's Epic'', et al.).  In order to rescue a Jewish scientist, two female agents infiltrate a Nazi [[Joy Division (WWII)|Joy Division]] camp, where prisoners are kept as sex slaves for German officers.  There are scenes of boot-licking humiliation, whipping, torture, lesbianism, and near-rape, culminating in a violent and bloody escape.  The stock characters include a cruel and perverse commandant, a lesbian doctor, sadistic guards who freely abuse the prisoners, and a sympathetic German who tries to help the captive women. 

The theme of Nazi sexual abuse continued in the sleazy, violent drive-in programmer ''The Cut-Throats'' (1969) and ''Torture Me, Kiss Me'' (1970), a low-budget, black-and-white B-movie about sadistic Nazi officers tormenting female civilians (including fetishistic flogging scenes) in occupied France. 

===The ''Ilsa'' influence===

Producer [[David F. Friedman]] had a small acting role in ''Love Camp 7''.  He went on to produce ''Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS'' in 1974.  ''Ilsa'' was unique in that the camp commandant was a sexy, sex-crazed woman played by the busty and frequently nude [[Dyanne Thorne]].  Between sex scenes, Ilsa subjects her male and female inmates to horrific scientific tests, much like [[Josef Mengele]]'s notorious [[Nazi human experimentation]] at [[Auschwitz]]. Some of the tests on hypothermia and pressure-chamber endurance were factual. Others were pure fantasy. For example, to prove her theory that women can endure more pain than men, Ilsa has a male and female prisoner flogged to death.

The character is also loosely based on "The Witch of Buchenwald", [[Ilse Koch]], the wife of the commandant of the Buchenwald concentration camp.  Koch was known for having perverse sexual dalliances with the prisoners and was rumored to have had [[lampshades made from human skin]].

''Ilsa'' includes the standard elements of sadism, degradation, whipping, sexual slavery, graphic torture, and a bloody finale with Ilsa shot dead and the camp set ablaze. The film was a surprise hit on the drive-in theater and [[grindhouse]] circuit.  Ilsa was resurrected for three profitable sequels that ignored her Nazi origins and are closer to the women-in-prison genre.  As a freelance mistress-for-hire, she became ''[[Ilsa, Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks]]'' (1976), commander of a 1953 gulag in ''[[Ilsa, the Tigress of Siberia]]'' (1977), and the warden of a corrupt Latin-American prison in ''[[Ilsa, the Wicked Warden]]'' (1977).

===Nazi films from Italy and France===

Meanwhile, European filmmakers were creating their own lurid Nazi movies with Ilsa-type villains.  In 1977, [[Malisa Longo]] starred in ''Helga, She Wolf of Stilberg'' as a black-booted, leather-clad, sexually sadistic commander of a prison camp for women. That year, Longo also starred in the ''Salon Kitty''-inspired ''[[Fräulein Devil]]'' (also known as ''Elsa: Fraulein SS'') as Elsa, a former hooker with a penchant for S&amp;M, who manages a Nazi brothel train. This was filmed [[Back to back film production|back-to-back]] with ''Hitler's Last Train'' (also known as ''Special Train for the SS'', ''Helltrain'' and ''Love Train for the SS'', 1977). These films, plus ''Nathalie: Escape from Hell'' (1978), were produced by the French studio Eurociné.

One of the most notorious films in this genre is ''[[La Bestia in Calore]]'' (also known as ''SS Hell Camp'' and ''The Beast In Heat''), produced in Italy in 1977.  German actress Macha Magall played Dr. Ellen Kratsch, another icy blond Nazi who is sexy, yet thoroughly evil.  This film, with its extensive and graphic scenes of torture, brutality and rape, was initially banned in England.  A milder, edited version was released in the U.S. as ''SS Experiment Camp 2''.  Magall was also in ''[[SS Girls]]'' (1977), another story set in a Nazi brothel.

The Nazi exploitation subgenre presented an opportunity for Italian studios to make very low-cost horror pictures whilst tapping a previously ignored market; the exploitation war film. The Italian films are different from "Ilsa" in many ways, for instance, they focus on far more extreme aspects of human abuse.

The films of 1976 include: Sergio Garrone's ''[[SS Experiment Camp]]'' (also known as ''SS Experiment Love Camp''), depicting soft-core sex scenes and the castration of an SS officer. ''SS Hell Camp'', Luigi Batzella's second Nazi film, featured a sexually-crazed mutant created by an Ilsa-like Nazi scientist. ''[[SS Girls]]'', directed by [[Bruno Mattei]], is a blatant copy of ''Salon Kitty''. Mattei also made ''Women's Camp 119'' starring [[Lorraine De Selle]]. This film depicts horrific scientific experiments performed on prisoners based on actual documents. ''[[SS Special Section Women]]'' stars [[John Steiner]] as a sex-crazed SS Commandant whose love for a Jewish girl costs him his manhood. ''Achtung! The Desert Tigers'', from [[Luigi Batzella]], is interwoven with stock footage and scenes at a Nazi camp in the desert where tortures abound.

1977 saw the release of ''[[Last Orgy of the Third Reich|Gestapo's Last Orgy]]'' (also known as ''Last Orgy of the Third Reich'' and ''Caligula Reincarnated as Hitler''), which depicts a love affair between a camp Commandant and a prisoner. ''SS Camp 5: Women’s Hell'' is ''SS Experiment Camp'''s sister film featuring the same cast and crew. ''[[Red Nights of the Gestapo]]'' is a soft-core sex film with SS soldiers abusing women in a castle. ''[[Nazi Love Camp 27]]'', starring [[Sirpa Lane]] as a Jewish girl forced into a brothel, is notable for its hardcore sex scenes and for being written by famed scripter [[Gianfanco Clerici]].

By the end of the decade the genre had run its course.

===Nazi pornography===

Adult films also exploited Nazi scenarios in a string of sadomasochistic "roughie" pornographic films in the 1970s and early 1980s.  Examples include the [[Mitchell brothers]]' ''Hot Nazis'', ''Hitler's Harlot'' (1973), and 1980's ''Nazi Love Island'' (a.k.a. ''Prisoner of Paradise'') with [[John Holmes (pornographic actor)|John Holmes]] and [[Seka]].  One of the last entries, ''Stalag 69'' (1982), starred [[Angelique Pettyjohn]] as an Ilsa-type SS officer.  The story was largely a remake of ''Love Camp 7'', bringing the cycle back to its origins.  The genre remained mostly dormant for the next two decades. In 2006, Mood Pictures, a Hungarian producer of S&amp;M films, released ''Gestapo'', ''Gestapo 2'', and ''Dr. Mengele'' in 2008, all of which are set in a Nazi prison camp and pay homage to ''Ilsa'' and the Italian exploitation films.

===Present===

In 2007, as part of [[Robert Rodriguez]] and [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s tribute to exploitation cinema, ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'', director [[Rob Zombie]] created a trailer for a fake film called [[Grindhouse (film)#Werewolf Women of the SS|''Werewolf Women of the SS'']], starring [[Nicolas Cage]] and [[Udo Kier]]. According to Zombie, "Basically, I had two ideas. It was either going to be a Nazi movie or a [[women in prison film|women-in-prison film]], and I went with the Nazis. There's all those movies like ''[[Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS]]''; ''[[Fräulein Devil]]''; and ''[[Love Camp 7]]''—I've always found that to be the most bizarre genre." On December 18, 2007, Zombie posted an entry on his [[MySpace]] page, asking if people would want to see a [[feature-length]] version of ''Werewolf Women of the SS''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myspace.com/robzombie |title=A Werewolf Women question |accessdate=2007-12-21 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=[[MySpace]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Iron Sky]]'' and ''[[Nazis at the Center of the Earth]]'' (both released in 2012) are in a similar vein.

==Themes==
Most of the Nazi exploitation films have [[stalag]] settings with young female inmates like ''[[Women's Camp 119]]''. Their tormentors are female or male [[Nazi]] officers in [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] uniforms, usually speaking with a fake German accent and irrelevant or mispronounced [[German language|German]] words, who often use "experiments" as excuses to implement sadistic physical violence (perhaps inspired by the work of people like [[Josef Mengele]], who performed [[Nazi human experimentation|medical experiments]] that often killed people). There are scenes of sexual conduct or, more routinely, exposed nude bodies of the victimised inmates. The level of violence depicted in these films may often reach the [[Splatter film|gore]] level.

This genre mainly focused on female SS officers. It presented them as lusty as well as buxom women, such as Dyanne Thorne's Ilsa, who also sexually abused their male prisoners (mainly in [[non-statutory female-on-male rape]] fashion). As the setting is a Stalag ([[prisoner-of-war camp]]), not a concentration camp, the prisoners are mainly Allied soldiers, not Jewish civilians.

There are also many films that do not follow the conventions of Nazi exploitation, such as ''Bordel SS'' (1978) of [[José Bénazéraf]] (one of the very few Nazi exploitation films to hold the dubious honor of having actual [[hardcore sex]]) and ''[[Salon Kitty (film)|Salon Kitty]]'' (1976) of [[Tinto Brass]]. These films are not usually considered as "prototypical" Nazi exploitation films and qualify more for the "[[Art film|art house]]" subgenre. However, because of the vague term, even the film ''Il portiere di notte'' (''[[The Night Porter]]'') (1974) by [[Liliana Cavani]] that (in the opinion of many) lacks the exploitation motive, may be deemed one such film.

Laura Frost's book ''Sex Drives: Fantasies of Fascism in Literary Modernism'' (2002) ({{ISBN|0801487641}}) says that the genre is part of a problematic attempt to link political deviance (i.e. [[fascism]], [[militarism]], [[genocide]]) with sexual deviance (i.e. [[sadomasochism]], [[homosexuality]], [[transvestism]], [[pedophilia]]).

==Legal status in Britain==
Sometime in the early 1980s, Nazi exploitation films made their way onto the [[United Kingdom|British]] market, made popular by the growing [[VHS]] home video technology. With major [[Hollywood]] studios steering clear of the new format, it was left to small, domestic companies to populate the shelves with tapes. A small company from [[England]], [[GO Video]], purchased the rights to an Italian film named  ''SS Experiment Camp''. The company ran a marketing campaign with full-page ads showing a naked woman hanging from her feet, a [[swastika]] dangling from her wrist and an [[SS]] commander looming in the background. Advertisements for the film in [[video rental]] stores became a target for protestors, who picketed such stores and petitioned for the film to be banned. After the [[Video Recordings Act 1984|Video Recordings Act]], most of the Nazi exploitation films (labelled 'Nazi [[Video nasty|Nasties]]') were denied [[BBFC]] classifications. The following Nazi exploitation films were taken off the shelves:

* ''[[SS Experiment Camp]]'' (''SS Experiment''/''Lager SSadis Kastrat Kommandantur'')
* ''[[La Bestia in Calore|The Beast In Heat]]'' (''SS Hell Camp''/''La Bestia in Calore'')
* ''[[Last Orgy of the Third Reich|Gestapo's Last Orgy]]'' (''Last Orgy of The Third Reich''/''Caligula Reincarnated as Hitler''/''L'ultima orgia del III Reich'')
* ''[[Love Camp 7]]''
* ''[[Deported Women of the SS Special Section]]'' (''Le Deportate della sezione speciale SS'')

Of the above films, only ''SS Experiment Camp'' is now available in the [[U.K.]].

==Israeli literature==
[[Literature of Israel|In Israel]] specifically, during the 1960s, "[[Stalag fiction]]" was pocket books whose stories focused on the unique features of this genre. The phenomena took ground in parallel to the 1961 [[Eichmann Trial#Trial|Eichmann trial]]. Sales of this pornographic literature broke all records in Israel as hundreds of thousands of copies were sold at kiosks.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/06/world/middleeast/06stalags.html |title=Israel’s Unexpected Spinoff From a Holocaust Trial |first=Isabel |last=Kershner |newspaper=New York Times |date=September 6, 2007 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They were inspired by [[Ka-tzetnik 135633]]'s ''[[House of Dolls]]'', the experiences of a Jewish girl prostituted in the "Joy Division" ([[Block 24]]) of the [[Auschwitz]] camp, the factuality of which is disputed.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;

'''''Nothing's Sacred''''' is the [[autobiography]] of comedian [[Lewis Black]]. It was published in 2005, and republished in 2006 (paperback edition). The 2006 publication contains new material and one of the plays he wrote during his career as a [[playwright]]. The book has also been released in unabridged audio CD format, narrated by Black himself. The book is narrated in the same fashion as Black's [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]] routines, with explicit language, [[sarcasm]], and constant fits of [[rage (emotion)|rage]].

The book primarily accounts Lewis' admiration for his seemingly eccentric family, his disregard for authority, his education, past habitual drug use, his perspectives on current issues, and other real-life events such as his [[hitchhiking]] trip in Europe or his late pet dog, John-John. The book's layout is in semi-chronological order. The book has no [[table of contents]] and a lengthy page of acknowledgments.

== Excerpts from the book ==

'''''Pan''''' is a 2015 American [[fantasy film]]&lt;ref name=bfi/&gt;&lt;ref name="afi"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/70601?sid=840123e4-4280-40d8-8eb9-524defa39522&amp;sr=8.336397&amp;cp=1&amp;pos=0&amp;cxt=Filmography1|title=Pan (2015)|publisher=American Film Institute|accessdate=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Joe Wright]] and written by [[Jason Fuchs]]. The film serves as a prequel to ''[[Peter and Wendy]]'' from Scottish author [[J. M. Barrie]], which was first staged in 1904, and focuses on an alternative [[origin story]] for [[Peter Pan]] and [[Captain Hook]]. It stars [[Levi Miller]] as the title character, along with [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Garrett Hedlund]], [[Rooney Mara]], and [[Amanda Seyfried]].

''Pan'''s world premiere was held in [[London]] on September 20, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTSPZa4pKMo|title=Pan – World Premiere - Official Warner Bros. UK|date=September 21, 2015|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was theatrically released in the United States on October 9, 2015, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. ''Pan'' grossed $128.4 million against a production budget of $150 million and was widely considered a [[box office bomb]], resulting in significant loss for the studio. The film received generally negative reviews, with criticism calling the plot formulaic and the action heavily-reliant on [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]].

==Plot==
{{long plot|section|date=May 2016|reason=Per WP:FILMPLOT, this section should be 400 to 700 words. As of this note, the plot summary is 772 words.}}
Newborn [[Peter Pan|Peter]] ([[Levi Miller]]), who has a mysterious [[pan flute]] pendant, is left by his mother Mary ([[Amanda Seyfried]]) on the steps of an orphanage in London, an establishment under the care of the [[Abuse|abusive]] [[Nun|Mother]] Barnabas ([[Kathy Burke]]). Several years later, during [[World War II]], upon learning that Mother Barnabas is hoarding food for herself, Peter and his best friend Nibs ([[Lewis MacDougall]]) try to steal it to distribute among themselves and the other orphans but they are caught. In the process, Peter finds a letter written by his mother, declaring her love and assuring Peter they will meet again "in this world or another".

In retaliation for the boys' mischief, Mother Barnabas summons [[Air pirate|pirates]] who kidnap Peter, Nibs and several others. Nibs manages to escape but Peter does not. He is captured and taken aboard a flying pirate ship. Following an aerial battle with several [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] the ship takes Peter to Neverland, a magical realm beyond space and time, where he is forced to become a slave laborer and mine for Pixum (crystallized Fairy Dust) on behalf of the terrible pirate [[Blackbeard]] ([[Hugh Jackman]]) who uses it to prevent himself from aging. Peter befriends another miner, named [[Captain Hook|James Hook]] ([[Garrett Hedlund]]). After insulting Blackbeard's men, Peter is forced to [[Walking the plank|walk the plank]] over the deep mine, but survives by flying. Blackbeard then tells Peter about an old prophecy involving a boy who could fly who would one day kill him, but Peter refuses to believe he is that boy.

Peter joins Hook and his accomplice, [[Mr. Smee|Sam "Smee" Smiegel]] ([[Adeel Akhtar]]), stealing one of Blackbeard's flying ships and escapes into the forest. There they are found by the native chief's daughter [[Tiger Lily (Peter Pan)|Tiger Lily]] ([[Rooney Mara]]) and nearly executed but then Chief Great Little Panther ([[Jack Charles (actor)|Jack Charles]]) notices Peter's [[pan flute]] pendant, left to him by Mary, which is said to belong to their people's greatest hero, the legendary Pan. Using the Memory Tree, Tiger Lily tells Peter that many years ago when the natives and the fairies united to fight together against the pirates under Blackbeard, the Fairy Prince and the love of Blackbeard's life, Mary, fell in love, but when Blackbeard discovered them, the Prince took human form to rescue Mary. But as fairies could live in human form for only one day, the Prince sacrificed his life for Mary. Mary was then forced to hide their newborn son Peter in the other world on Earth and seek shelter in the Fairy Kingdom when she and the fairies had to retreat. As part of his half-fairy heritage, Peter has the ability to fly, but is unable to do so because of his lack of faith.

Fearful of Blackbeard's punishment, Smee betrays the natives' location to him, and in the ensuing battle, Chief Great Little Panther is murdered by Blackbeard, who also reveals that he killed Peter's mother. Peter is hurt to learn that Tiger Lily had lied to Peter, telling him his mother is still alive, but she explains that he would have walked away from his destiny if he knew the truth.

Peter, Hook, and Tiger Lily escape in a raft and head to the Fairy Kingdom to enlist their help in defeating the pirates. Along the way, Peter falls into the river and is nearly eaten by giant [[crocodile]]s before being rescued by the [[mermaid]]s, after which he has a vision of Blackbeard accidentally killing Mary as she defended the Fairy Kingdom from his offensive. Despondent over their chances, Hook leaves while Peter and Tiger Lily arrive at the Fairy Kingdom alone, only to be ambushed by Blackbeard who plans to use the fairies' vast amount of Pixum to live forever. Blackbeard takes Peter's pan flute pendant, which is the key to the fairy kingdom, opens their gates and launches an attack.

Peter escapes and befriends one of the fairies, named [[Tinker Bell]]. Together, they rally the rest of the Neverland fairies to fight the pirates while Tiger Lily duels Blackbeard. Hook returns on the stolen ship and fights Blackbeard's right-hand man Bishop ([[Nonso Anozie]]) until the ship tips over, sending both falling to their deaths. Peter conquers his fears and flies to save Hook, while Blackbeard and his men are overpowered by the fairies. Forced into an abyss, they subsequently fall to their deaths. Smee is the sole survivor having fled during the battle. Peter then sees a vision of Mary, who reaffirms him to be Neverland's savior: Peter Pan.

Shortly afterwards, Peter and Hook, now the captain of the ''Jolly Roger'', return to London to rescue Nibs and the other orphans, who become part of Peter's crew, the [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)|Lost Boys]]. Peter and Hook reaffirm their friendship, certain that nothing will ever go wrong between them.

According to critics of the casting there are very few main roles for Native American women in Hollywood, and that the choice not only took one away from a Native American actress, but also perpetuated the invisibility of Native Americans in film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garcia|first1=Alma|title=Contested Images: Women of Colour in Popular Culture|date=2012|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=0759119635|page=45|url=https://webcat.mtroyal.ca/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=720&amp;recCount=15&amp;recPointer=0&amp;bibId=1371721|accessdate=December 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[TheWrap]], director Joe Wright was trying to create a "very international and multi-racial" world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thewrap.com/rooney-mara-negotiations-play-tiger-lily-warner-bros-pan/ | title=Rooney Mara in Negotiations to Play Tiger Lily in Warner Bros.'

Critics of the casting in ''Pan'' suggested that Warner Bros. may have wanted to avoid repeating the alleged racism of previous ''Peter Pan'' stories, by altering the ethnicity of the Piccaninnies, rather than using a stereotypical portrayal of the source material.&lt;ref name="less native" /&gt; Many also felt that native actresses and actors were never given an opportunity to make it to mainstream films, with native roles being traditionally given to non-natives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xojane.com/issues/hollywood-|title=Hollywood Wants To Cast Rooney Mara As A Native American, We Native Americans Want Hollywood To Give Us A Chance|date=March 19, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Filming===
On April 28, 2014, the film's [[principal photography]] began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssninsider.com/on-the-set-for-5514-hugh-jackman-starrer-pan-starts-for-warner-bros-new-line-cinemas-crawlspace-wraps/ |title=On The Set For 5/5/14: Hugh Jackman Starrer 'Pan' Starts For Warner Bros., New Line Cinema's 'Crawlspace' Wraps |publisher=SSN Insider |date=2014-05-05 |accessdate=2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many natural scenes in the film were from [[Son Doong Cave]], [[Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park]] and [[Ninh Bình Province]] in [[Vietnam]]. The captured scenes were then graphically edited into the film.

==Soundtrack==
The film's soundtrack was released in 2015. It was composed by [[John Powell (film composer)|John Powell]], and additional music by Anthony Willis, Batu Sener, Paul Mounsey. [[Dario Marianelli]], a frequent collaborator with Wright, had composed a score for the film, but Warner Bros. later replaced him with Powell after test screenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savas|first=Kaya|date=October 11, 2015|url=http://www.filmmusicmedia.com/reviews/panbyjohnpowellreview|title=Pan by John Powell (Review)|work=Film.Music.Media|accessdate=January 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new release date also gave the producers more time to work on editing and visual effects during post-production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/hugh-jackmans-pan-moves-summer-790308|title=Hugh Jackman's 'Pan' Moves From Summer to Fall|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=April 20, 2015|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was first released in Australia, on September 25, 2015. It was then released in key markets two weeks later, including Germany, Russia, Korea, and Brazil, on October 8. That was followed by Mexico and Spain the next day.

The film opened in the United Kingdom on October 16, 2015, and France on October 21, 2015, followed by China on October 22, 2015, Japan on October 31, 2015, and Italy on November 12, 2015.&lt;ref name="Overseas9thOpening"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/09/hotel-transylvania-2-the-intern-pan-sicario-lost-in-hong-kong-box-office-international-1201553347/|title='Hotel Transylvania 2,' 'The Intern' Bow Amidst Holdovers 'Everest' And 'Scorch Trials' – Intl Box Office|author=Anita Busch|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=([[Penske Media Corporation]])|date=September 27, 2015|accessdate=September 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pan'' was originally planned for an [[IMAX]] release, as evident in early posters, trailers, and press,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/trailers/612919-new-pan-featurette-goes-in-depth-on-the-films-colorful-3d-worlds#/slide/50|title=New Pan Featurette Goes in Depth on the Film's Colorful 3D Worlds - ComingSoon.net|date=September 15, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=June 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was cancelled and only received non-IMAX presentations.

===Home media===
''Pan'' was released on DVD and [[Blu-ray]] on December 22, 2015, by [[Warner Home Video]], two-and-a-half months after the film's release. ''Pan'' was one of the first Ultra HD Blu-ray released on March 1, 2016.

==Reception==
===Box office===
''Pan'' was financially unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/time-warner-reports-mixed-quarterly-results-due-to-movie-flops-1201702038/|title=Time Warner Reports Mixed Quarterly Results Due to Movie Flops|author=Brent Lang|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=February 10, 2016|accessdate=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It grossed $35.1 million in North America and $93.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $128.3 million. In comparison, its production budget was reported to be $150 million, and the total spent on marketing was estimated at $100–125 million.&lt;ref name=BOM /&gt;&lt;ref name="boom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/warner-bros-pan-could-lead-831412|title=Warner Bros.'

In the United States and Canada, the film grossed $5.2 million on its opening day. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $15.3 million, below the studio's $20 million projection, and finished third at the box office.&lt;ref name="fuel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/10/martian-pan-the-walk-weekend-box-office-1201572119/|title='Martian' Still Has Fuel In Its Second Frame; 'Pan' Walks Plank; 'Steve Jobs' Popular In NY &amp; LA – Monday Postmortem |author=Anthony D'Alessandro|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=October 12, 2015|accessdate=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several factors have been attributed to the financial failure of ''Pan''. ''[[Forbes]]'' blogger Scott Mendelson attributed this to the absence of notable movie stars. Despite the presence of Jackman, "like any number of would-be big stars who are best known for a certain franchise, his opening weekend strength dips when he's not playing his trademark character." Outside of the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' franchise]], his biggest openings are ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]]'' ($51 million) and the $27 million debuts of ''[[Real Steel]]'' and ''[[Les Misérables (2012 film)|Les Misérables]]''.&lt;ref name="bomb"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2015/10/12/box-office-4-reasons-pan-bombed/|title=Box Office: 4 Reasons 'Pan' Bombed|author=Scott Mendelson|work=[[Forbes]]|date=October 12, 2015|accessdate=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the departure of the film in tone and writings that made earlier Peter Pan stories and films a success; from Jackman's role as [[Blackbeard]] to the inclusion of contemporary pop songs from [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and the [[Ramones]] which is peculiar for a children's film adaptation. "Without the Disney seal of approval, audiences are a bit wary of these fairy tale adaptations," said Jeff Bock, a box office analyst with Exhibitor Relations.

''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' estimated that the film cost $275 million to produce and market worldwide—while ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported at least $250 million—and noted that the financial losses by Warner Bros. could finish anywhere between $130 to $150 million.&lt;ref name="boom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bomb3"/&gt; The site suggested that if the film overperformed in China—the world's second largest movie market—the losses could have been lower.&lt;ref name="boom"/&gt; Opening in China on October 22, 2015, it failed to meet expectations.&lt;ref name="panned" /&gt; Based on its production cost and factoring in the percentage of ticket sales kept by theater owners, analysts estimated that ''Pan'' needed to take in at least $400–500 million worldwide to [[break even]].&lt;ref name="bomb3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/10/12/movies/pan-bombs-at-the-box-office.html |title='Pan' Bombs at the Box Office|author=Brooks Barnes|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 11, 2015|accessdate=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="panned"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-china-is-panning-pan-835052|title=Why China Is Panning 'Pan'|author=Patrick Brzeski|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=([[Prometheus Global Media]])|date=October 28, 2015|accessdate=October 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The financial loss incurred by ''Pan'' puts it alongside ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]'' and ''[[Jupiter Ascending]]'' as one of the biggest box office failures of 2015.&lt;ref name="bomb2"/&gt;

===Critical response===
On review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 27%, based on 184 reviews, and an average rating of 4.6/10.&lt;ref name="RT" /&gt; The website's critical consensus reads, "''Pan'' finds a few bursts of magic in its prequel treatment of classic characters, though not enough to offset the rushed plot and shrill, CGI-fueled action."&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pan_2015/|title=Pan (2015) |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film a score of 36 out of 100 based on reviews from 35 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/pan|title=Pan Reviews |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |work=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=October 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A.O. Scott of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the action scenes "murky and chaotic" and stated, "The dominant emotion in ''Pan'' is the desperation of the filmmakers, who frantically try to pander to a young audience they don’t seem to respect, understand or trust."&lt;ref name="Review-NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/movies/review-pan-proposes-peter-and-captain-hooks-origin-stories.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss|title=Review: ‘Pan’ Proposes Peter and Captain Hook’s Origin Stories|last=Scott|first=A.O.|date=October 8, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main characters lacked chemistry and depth according to Todd McCarthy of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', who added that with the exception of Levi Miller's Pan, "the characters don't reasonably comport with one's pre-existing images of them".&lt;ref name="Review-THR" /&gt; He also called a good portion of the film "a seriously extended chase that possesses hefty CGI-propelled dynamics but absolutely no suspense and a very limited sense of fun".&lt;ref name="Review-THR"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/pan-film-review-824864|title='Pan': Film Review|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|date=September 19, 2015|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Barker of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised the film's technical achievements and action sequences but found it depressing overall: "''Pan'' swaps puckish mischief and innocence for doses of [[Steampunk]] design, anachronistic music, a stock “chosen one” narrative and themes of child labor, warfare and unsustainable mineral mining exchanges".&lt;ref name="Review-Variety"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/film-review-pan-1201596436/|title=Film Review: 'Pan' |author=Andrew Barker|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=September 19, 2015|accessdate=September 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more positive review, Bill Zwecker of ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, calling Levi Miller "a truly wonderful cinematic discovery" and adding that the film is "chock-full with thrilling action sequences, vivid costumes and well-executed special effects".&lt;ref name="Review-ChicagoSun"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pressreader.com/usa/chicago-sun-times/20151009/283270276606347/TextView|title=From Boy to 'Pan': Jaunty Jackman, talented newcomer star in prequel pulsating with action|last=Zwecker|first=Bill|date=October 9, 2015|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, while [[PostTrak]] reported filmgoers gave it a 78% overall positive score.&lt;ref name=fuel/&gt;

[[File:Idiot's Delight lobby card.jpg|thumb|245px|&lt;center&gt;[[Clark Gable]]'s deliberately corny performance of the song in ''[[Idiot's Delight (film)|Idiot's Delight]]'' (1939), his only musical performance.]]
"'''Puttin' On the Ritz'''" is a song written by [[Irving Berlin]]. He wrote it in May 1927 and first published it on December 2, 1929.{{sfn|Kimball|Emmet|2001|p=262}} It was registered as an unpublished song August 24, 1927 and again on July 27, 1928.{{sfn|Kimball|Emmet|2001|p=262}} It was introduced by [[Harry Richman]] and chorus in the musical film ''[[Puttin' On the Ritz (film)|Puttin' On the Ritz]]'' (1930). According to ''The Complete Lyrics of Irving Berlin'', this was the first song in film to be sung by an interracial ensemble.{{sfn|Kimball|Emmet|2001|p=262}} The title derives from the [[slang]] expression "to put on the Ritz", meaning to dress very fashionably. The expression was inspired by the opulent [[The Ritz Hotel, London|Ritz Hotel]].

Hit [[gramophone record|phonograph records]] of the tune in its original period of popularity of 1929–1930 were recorded by [[Harry Richman]] and by [[Fred Astaire]], with whom the song is particularly associated.  Every other record label had their own version of this popular song (Columbia, Brunswick, Victor, and all of the dime store labels). Richman's Brunswick version of the song became the number-one selling record in America.{{sfn|Kimball|Emmet|2001|p=262}}

The song received renewed popularity and became known to a new generation of fans in 1983 when [[Taco (musician)|Taco]], a Dutch musician, recorded and released a new version of the song. Taco's version was accompanied by a music video, which aired on [[MTV]] and other music video networks and programs.

==Musical structure==
The song is in [[Thirty-two-bar form|AABA form]], with a verse.{{sfn|Mueller|1986|p=267}} According to [[John Mueller]], the central device in the A section is the "use of delayed rhythmic resolution: a staggering, off-balance passage, emphasized by the unorthodox stresses in the lyric, suddenly resolves satisfyingly on a held note, followed by the forceful assertion of the title phrase." The marchlike B section, which is only barely [[Syncopation|syncopated]], acts as a contrast to the previous rhythmic complexities.{{sfn|Mueller|1986|p=267}} According to [[Alec Wilder]], in his study of American popular song, for him, the rhythmic pattern in "Puttin' On the Ritz" is "the most complex and provocative I have ever come upon."{{sfn|Mueller|1986|p=267}}

==Lyrics and race==
The original version of Berlin's song included references to the then-popular fad of flashily-dressed but poor [[Black people|black]] [[Harlem]]ites parading up and down [[Lenox Avenue]], "Spending ev'ry dime / For a wonderful time". In the United Kingdom, the song was popularized through the BBC's radio broadcasts of [[Joe Kaye's Band]] performing it at [[The Ritz Hotel, London]] restaurant in the 1930s.{{sfn|Montgomery-Massingberd|Watkin|Collie|p=97}} The song was featured with the original lyrics in the 1939 film ''[[Idiot's Delight (film)|Idiot's Delight]]'', where it was performed by [[Clark Gable]] and chorus, and this routine was selected for inclusion in ''[[That's Entertainment!|That's Entertainment]]'' (1974). Columbia released a [[Gramophone record#78 rpm disc developments|78 recording]] of [[Fred Astaire]] singing the original lyrics in May 1930&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Puttin' On the Ritz / Crazy Feet |publisher= [[Rate Your Music]] |url= http://rateyourmusic.com/release/single/fred_astaire/puttin_on_the_ritz___crazy_feet/ |accessdate= May 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (B-side – "Crazy Feet", both recorded on March 26, 1930). For the film ''[[Blue Skies (1946 film)|Blue Skies]]'' (1946), where it was performed by Fred Astaire, Berlin revised the lyrics to apply to affluent whites strutting "up and down [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]]".{{sfn|Kimball|Emmet|2001|p=262}}{{efn-ua|"In the original version it told of the ritzy airs of Harlemites parading up and down Lenox Avenue. For the 1946 film, the strutters became well-to-do whites on Park Avenue. The patronizing, yet admiring satire of the song is shifted, then, and mellowed in the process. The change may have had to do with changing attitudes towards race and with Hollywood's dawning wariness about offending blacks."{{sfn|Mueller|1986|p=267}}}} This second version was published after being registered for copyright on August 28, 1946.{{sfn|Kimball|Emmet|2001|p=262}}

In 1982, singer [[Taco (musician)|Taco]] released a [[synth-pop]] [[cover version]] of "Puttin' On the Ritz" as a single from his album ''After Eight'', released on [[Polydor Records|Polydor]] of Germany. The single was accompanied by a music video, the original version of which contains characters in [[blackface]] and has since been banned from many networks. An alternative version eliminates many shots of the blackface characters, though some remain.

The single was a global hit, reaching No. 1 in ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]''&lt;ref name="Cashbox"/&gt; as well as No. 4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart,&lt;ref name="awards"/&gt; making Irving Berlin, then 95, the oldest ever living songwriter to have one of his compositions enter the top ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Irving Berlin |publisher= Russian Heritage Museum |url= http://russianheritagemuseum.com/en/RHM_Irving_Berlin/ |accessdate= May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was certified [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for selling over one million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= RIAA – Gold &amp; Platinum Searchable Database – Puttin' On the Ritz |url= https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&amp;ar=Taco&amp;ti=Puttin%27+On+the+Ritz#search_section |publisher= [[Recording Industry Association of America]] |accessdate= May 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Taco's only hit in the United States.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; This version of the song was ranked No. 53 in [[VH1]]'s ''[[The Greatest (TV series)|100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the 80s]]'' special.

The song topped the charts in Sweden and New Zealand, and it entered the Top 5 in numerous countries including Australia, Norway, Austria and Canada.&lt;ref name="AUS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BEL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CAN"/&gt;

The Taco cover of the song was used in ''[[Baby Geniuses]]'' (1999) and ''[[The Call (2013 film)|The Call]]'' (2013). [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]] covered Taco's version of the song for "Don't Be a Vidiot", a 1984 episode of ''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks (1983 TV series)|Alvin and the Chipmunks]]''.

'''Quantic Dream SA''' is a French [[video game developer]] based in Paris. Founded in June 1997, Quantic Dream has developed five video games: ''[[The Nomad Soul]]'' (1999), ''[[Fahrenheit (2005 video game)|Fahrenheit]]'' (2005), ''[[Heavy Rain]]'' (2010), ''[[Beyond: Two Souls]]'' (2013), and ''[[Detroit: Become Human]]'' (2018). Quantic Dream is known for promoting [[interactive storytelling]], with founder [[David Cage]] as the primary creative force.

== History ==
[[David Cage]], after fifteen years as a composer, started writing the concept and story of ''[[The Nomad Soul]]'' in 1994. He ended up with a 200-page document and sent it to contacts he had acquired during his time making music, who noted that its execution would not be technically feasible. To prove them wrong, Cage hired a team of friends and made an office out of a [[Recording studio|sound booth]], with a financial deadline of six months to come up with a [[game engine]] and [[prototype]]. In the final week, Cage travelled to [[London]] and met with publisher [[Eidos Interactive]].{{efn|The year this occurred has both been reported as 1997 and 1998.&lt;ref name="MCV-Sep2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Edge-Sep2013" /&gt;}} With the project funded and a publisher secured, ''The Nomad Soul'' was in full development; musician [[David Bowie]] played two characters and created ten original songs. On 3 June 1997, Cage founded the company as Quantic Dream [[S.A. (corporation)|SA]]; the name draws influence from the term "[[quantum physics]]".&lt;ref name="MCV-Sep2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilms-May2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Batchelor-Oct2016" /&gt; The game released in November 1999, selling more than 600,000 copies.&lt;ref name="Edge-Sep2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gibson-Mar2005" /&gt;

[[File:David Cage 20080927 Festival du jeu video 04.jpg|thumb|David Cage in 2008]]
In 2004, Quantic Dream provided [[motion capture]] for the film ''[[Immortal (2004 film)|Immortal]]''.&lt;ref name="Murphy-Oct2013" /&gt; They followed ''The Nomad Soul'' with ''[[Fahrenheit (2005 video game)|Fahrenheit]]'', published by [[Atari, Inc. (Atari, SA subsidiary)|Atari, Inc.]] in September 2005, introducing elements that would endure in their later games—[[ethical]] ambiguity, [[Romance (love)|romance]], the inability to perish, and [[interactive storytelling]]. It received multiple awards and sold over one million copies.&lt;ref name="MCV-Sep2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Quantic Dream" /&gt; The same year, Quantic Dream revealed ''The Casting'', a [[technology demonstration]] of what could be accomplished on [[PlayStation 3]].&lt;ref name="Wilms-May2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson-Mar2012" /&gt; This preceded the partnership with [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] to bring ''[[Heavy Rain]]'' into existence, marking "something more personal" for Cage.&lt;ref name="MCV-Sep2011" /&gt; ''Heavy Rain'' launched in 2010 to critical acclaim,&lt;ref name="MCPS3-A" /&gt; winning three awards at the [[7th British Academy Games Awards]] and selling a total of 5.3 million copies.&lt;ref name="Dutton-Mar2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Audureau-Jan2018" /&gt; By late 2011, another deal had been established with Sony.&lt;ref name="MCV-Sep2011" /&gt; The following year, Quantic Dream showed another PlayStation 3 tech demo, ''Kara'', taking advantage of new investments in motion capture facilities.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Mar2012" /&gt; The second title with Sony was 2013's ''[[Beyond: Two Souls]]'', starring actress [[Ellen Page]] and actor [[Willem Dafoe]],&lt;ref name="Batchelor-Oct2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brightman-Jul2012" /&gt; which received mixed reviews from critics and managed to sell 2.8 million copies.&lt;ref name="MCPS3-B" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caballero-Jul2018" /&gt; It was the second video game to be shown at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in 2013,&lt;ref name="Gaston-Mar2013" /&gt; the same year that ''The Dark Sorcerer'', a tech demo running on [[PlayStation 4]], was unveiled at [[E3]].&lt;ref name="Funk-Jun2013" /&gt;

In 2014, Quantic Dream doubled their investment in Vicon, whose motion capture technology was previously used in ''Heavy Rain'' and ''Beyond: Two Souls''.&lt;ref name="Vicon-Apr2014" /&gt; The company's fifth video game and third published by Sony, ''[[Detroit: Become Human]]'', was announced the year after. Based on the ''Kara'' tech demo,&lt;ref name="Goldfarb-Oct2015" /&gt; it spent four years in development before releasing in May 2018.&lt;ref name="deFondaumiere-Apr2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cage-Mar2018" /&gt; Quantic Dream's most successful launch to date,&lt;ref name="Grubb-Jun2018" /&gt; it has sold 1.5 million copies.&lt;ref name="Harradence-Aug2018" /&gt; Around that time, Quantic Dream employed 180 staff members,&lt;ref name="Purchese-Jan2018" /&gt; five fewer than were reported in 2016.&lt;ref name="InsidePlayStation-Aug2016" /&gt;

== Controversy ==
In January 2018, three French news outlets—''[[Le Monde]]'',&lt;ref name="Audureau-Jan2018" /&gt; ''[[Mediapart]]'',&lt;ref name="GoanecIsrael-Jan2018" /&gt; and ''[[Canard PC]]''&lt;ref name="Kalash-Jan2018" /&gt;—published the results of a joint investigation into the company's business practices, alleging a harmful studio culture, overwork, and sexist or racist behaviour by employees. The reports named Cage and chief operating officer [[Guillaume de Fondaumière]] as perpetrators of inappropriate behaviour and overworking the staff. Controversial images exchanged by email and posted around the office included photos of studio collaborators and employees digitally edited to appear as Nazis and porn stars.&lt;ref name="Phillips-Jul2018" /&gt; Cage said the allegations were "ridiculous, absurd and grotesque"; de Fondaumière stated, "I will be extremely clear: it's absolutely false".&lt;ref name="Purchese-Jan2018" /&gt; As a result, Quantic Dream levied a [[lawsuit]] against ''Le Monde'' and ''Mediapart'', while ''Canard PC'' received two "threatening letters".&lt;ref name="Schreier-Apr2018" /&gt; That July, Quantic Dream lost one court case against an employee who left due to the scandal.&lt;ref name="Phillips-Jul2018" /&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Quantic Dream's video games are written and directed by Cage and [[brand]]ed accordingly, with the purpose of making new [[intellectual properties]].&lt;ref name="MCV-Sep2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gibson-Mar2013" /&gt; Cage has declared that his mission is to evoke [[emotion]] through interactive storytelling, highlighting [[empathy]], [[sadness]], and [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] in opposition to [[frustration]], [[competition]], and [[anger]]. As such, he described purchasing ''Heavy Rain'' as a "political act" that others like it could be made.&lt;ref name="Welsh-Feb2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ingham-Mar2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Edge-Jul2012" /&gt; The developer strives to appeal to gamers and non-gamers alike,&lt;ref name="Gallagher-Mar2011" /&gt; considering video games to be the same as any artform.&lt;ref name="Batchelor-Oct2016" /&gt; It is customary at Quantic Dream to develop an engine for each new game, hardware, or platform; Cage believes that, while an engine's methodology can be [[Porting|ported]], its code cannot.&lt;ref name="MCV-Sep2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Edge-Jul2012" /&gt; Tech demos have likewise become tradition.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Mar2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Funk-Jun2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanson-Sep2013" /&gt; In France, Quantic Dream is afforded a 20% [[tax break]] on production costs, without which Cage would move the company to [[Canada]] to keep up with the competition.&lt;ref name="MCV-Sep2011" /&gt;

'''''Shanghai Express''''' is a 1932 American [[Pre-Code Hollywood|pre-Code]] film directed by [[Josef von Sternberg]] and starring [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Clive Brook]], [[Anna May Wong]], and [[Warner Oland]]. It was written by [[Jules Furthman]], based on a 1931 story by [[Harry Hervey]]. ''Shanghai Express'' was the fourth of seven films von Sternberg and Dietrich made together.

''Shanghai Express'' was released during the midst of the [[Great Depression]]. The film was a huge hit with the public, grossing $3.7 million in its initial screenings in the United States alone, becoming the biggest financial success of the Dietrich-von Sternberg collaborations, and was the highest-grossing movie of 1932, surpassing the all-star ''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]''.

''Shanghai Express'' was remade as ''[[Night Plane from Chungking]]'' (1942) and ''[[Peking Express (film)|Peking Express]]'' (1951).

==Plot==
[[File:Shanghai Express (film) 1932 Josef von Sternberg, dir - (L-R) Marlene Dietrich, Clive Brook.jpg|left|thumb|(L-R) Marlene Dietrich (Madeleine/Shanghai Lily) and Clive Brook (Donald "Doc" Harvey)]]
In 1931, China is embroiled in a [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]]. Friends of British Captain Donald "Doc" Harvey ([[Clive Brook]]) envy him because the fabulously notorious Shanghai Lily ([[Marlene Dietrich]]) is a fellow passenger on the express train from [[Beijing|Peking]] to [[Shanghai]]. Because the name means nothing to him, they inform him that she is a "coaster" or "woman who lives by her wits along the China coast" – in other words, a [[courtesan]]. On the journey, Harvey encounters Lily, who turns out to be his former lover, Madeline. Five years earlier, she had played a trick on Harvey to gauge his love for her, but it backfired and he left her. She frankly informs him that, in the interim, "It took more than one man to change my name to Shanghai Lily." When Lily makes it clear that she still cares deeply for him, it becomes apparent that his feelings also have not changed when she inadvertently sees the watch she gave him with her photograph still in it.

Among the other passengers are fellow coaster Hui Fei ([[Anna May Wong]]), Lily's companion; Christian missionary Mr. Carmichael ([[Lawrence Grant]]), who at first condemns the two "fallen women"; inveterate gambler Sam Salt ([[Eugene Pallette]]); [[opium]] dealer Eric Baum ([[Gustav von Seyffertitz]]); [[boarding house]] keeper Mrs. Haggerty ([[Louise Closser Hale]]); French officer Major Lenard ([[Emile Chautard]]) and a mysterious [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]], Henry Chang ([[Warner Oland]]).

Chinese government soldiers board and search the train and apprehend a high-ranking rebel agent. Chang then makes his way to a telegraph office and sends a coded message. Later, the train is stopped and taken over by the rebel army and its powerful warlord, who turns out to be Chang. Chang begins to question the passengers, looking for someone important enough to exchange for his valued aide. He finds what he wants in Harvey, who is on his way to perform brain surgery on the Governor-General of Shanghai. Chang offers to take Shanghai Lily to his palace, but she claims she has reformed. When Chang refuses to accept her answer, Harvey breaks in and knocks him down. Because Chang needs Harvey alive, he swallows (but does not forget) the insult. Chang then has Hui Fei brought to him in his quarters, where he forces himself on her.

The government releases Chang's man, but Chang decides to blind Harvey for his insolence. Out of love, Lily offers herself in return for Harvey's safe release. Harvey remains unaware of the danger that he is in and of Lily's reason for going with Chang. Chang is stabbed to death by Hui Fei who tells Harvey what has transpired. Finding Lily, the trio boards the train and departs before the body is discovered. The missionary Carmichael, trusting his instincts, gets Lily to reveal the truth about saving Harvey. She insists that he not enlighten Harvey because love must go hand in hand with faith. When the train finally reaches Shanghai safely, Lily offers Harvey her love unconditionally but demands the same in return. Harvey finally breaks down and embraces her.

==Production==

Based on Henry Hervey's story ("Sky Over China," also known as "China Pass"), ''Shanghai Express'' was, in turn, loosely based on the May 6, 1923, incident in which a Shandong warlord captured the Shanghai to Beijing express train, where 25 westerners and 300 Chinese were taken hostage. All of the hostages captured in the [[Lincheng Outrage]] were successfully ransomed,&lt;ref name="CCOCH"&gt;French 2006 {{page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OaL"&gt;Nozinski 1990 {{page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Lucy Aldrich]]. [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount studio]] heads were concerned that the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Hays Office]] kept a close watch on the film due to the portrayal of the Reverend Carmichael and the depiction of the Chinese revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/89803/Shanghai-Express/notes.html "Notes: 'Shanghai Express'."] ''Turner Classic Movies''. Retrieved: July 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story also echoes elements of [[Guy de Maupassant]]'s short story "[[Boule de Suif]]" in the setting of travellers stopped in a country at war and a woman called upon to sleep with the commander in charge. However the denouement is altered, and while the travellers are released, the woman murders the commander and her fellow travelling companions change their attitude towards her.

==Reception==
[[File:Marlene Dietrich in Shanghai Express (1932) by Don English.png|thumb|left|Marlene Dietrich in ''Shanghai Express'']]

''Shanghai Express'' was dubbed "''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'' on wheels". Critically reviewed, the film was praised by Mordaunt Hall of ''[[The New York Times]]'' as a star vehicle for [[Marlene Dietrich]]. "Miss Dietrich gives an impressive performance. She is langourous but fearless as Lily." Other characters are also singled out, "Clive Brooks's performance is also noteworthy ..." "... Warner Oland is excellent as Mr. Chang and [[Anna May Wong]] makes the most of the rôle of the brave Chinese girl. Eugene Pallette serves splendidly as Sam Salt."&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Mordaunt. [https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C04E6DD1E3EE333A2575BC1A9649C946394D6CF "'Shanghai Express' (1932): Marlene Dietrich in a brilliantly directed melodrama set aboard a train running from Peiping to Shanghai."] ''The New York Times'', February 18, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Spence]], writing about the film's usefulness as a piece of history says that the real events of 1923 Lincheng Incident were far more dramatic but says that nonetheless it is "a wonderful film, with great performances by Dietrich – 'it took more than one man to change my name to Shanghai Lily' – and Anna May Wong." {{sfnb|Spence|1996| p =210}}

The critic for ''[[Senses of Cinema]]'' called ''Shanghai Express'', (a) "riotous exercise in excess in every area; the visuals are overpowering and sumptuous; the costumes ornate and extravagant; the sets a riot of fabrics, light and space; and all of it captured in the most delectable black-and-white cinematography that one can find anywhere." He discusses the film's interest in the questions of race and colonialism and notes the "peculiar bifurcation" of the film's view of race; most of the respectable "white" characters in the film are seen as both flawed and racist. Only Dietrich, Wong, and to some extent "Doc" Harvey, have any "real moral agency." He calls the film "surprisingly feminist," with Dietrich being a "strong, dominating presence" and Wong's character her equal.{{sfnb|Dixon|2012}} {{page needed|date=July 2015}}

''Shanghai Express'' is memorable for its stylistic black-and-white [[chiaroscuro]] cinematography. Even though [[Lee Garmes]] was awarded the [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]], according to Dietrich, it was von Sternberg who was responsible for most of it.&lt;ref name="Landazuri"&gt;Landazuri, Margarita.

'''Shutdown Day''' was an [[Internet]] campaign active between 2007 and 2009 which promoted the idea of a [[holiday]] when people would go without a [[computer]] for the entire day. The benefits attributed to not using a computer for 24 hours range from electricity savings to getting back in touch with friends and [[nature]].

== Establishment ==

===Founders===
Denis Bystrov and Nikolay Kudrevatykh were the co-founders of Shutdown Day; Bystrov originally conceived the idea of Shutdown Day, and the co-founders developed the concept in 2007, while living in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="sdd-about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shutdownday.org/about.php|title=Can you survive for 24 hours without your computer ?|date=2008|publisher=Shutdown Day|accessdate=2009-02-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122192243/http://shutdownday.org/about.php|archivedate=2009-01-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael Taylor, an original partner in the idea of shutting down one's [[computer]] down for a day, said:

{{quote|I certainly could not and would not want to live without my computer. However, I am often drawn into spending hours chatting on MSN, simply because my friends are online instead of socialising face to face. I am often too busy to cook a proper dinner, because I want to see the latest news on digg.com or the latest YouTube video. I know parents who are so addicted to the computer that they spend little time with their children, and I also know children who do not spend time with their parents because they are always using the computer. We are not preaching to anyone to turn off their computers. We are just suggesting that people might like to take part in this experiment, and see what happens.}}

Many thanks to our friend Andrei Dryzgalovich who designed, developed and technically supported our project.

== Purpose and goals ==
Shutdown Day is a global Internet experiment whose purpose is to get people to think about how their lives have changed with the increasing use of the home computer, and whether or not any good things are being lost because of this.&lt;ref name="sdd-about" /&gt; The concept of the ''Shutdown Day'' project is to simply shutdown one's computer for one whole day each year, and become involved in other activities: outdoors, nature, sports, fun stuff with friends and family, just to remind yourself that there is a real world beyond the computer screen.

== History ==

Shutdown Day started in early 2007, when Denis Bystrov realized that he spent too much time with his computer and wanted to spend more time with his family. Bystrov teamed up with his friends Nikolay Kudrevatykh, Michael Taylor (former trade floor occupant in stock markets in London, [[England]]) and David Bridle (part-time film maker from Cardiff, Wales), to present a challenge on the Internet, through the website shutdownday.org, challenging people to avoid their computers for 24 hours. The idea was simple:

{{quote|Do you think you can stay away from your computers for at least 24 hours a day, and if yes, can you pledge to do so?}}

What began as an innocent question, gathered an Internet chain reaction following, which drew millions of viewers from across the world. Here is a summary of the results from the Shutdown Day 2007 campaign:

* The Shutdown Day website received more than 1.6 million visitors in the first month of the campaign.
* More than 65,000 people participated in the campaign by actually shutting down their computers for 24 hours on the 24th of March, 2007.
* The Shutdown Day promotional clip was broadcast on YouTube and received more than 1.1 million hits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8OMijrTVBU|title=Shutdown Day 2007 Official Video on Youtube)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 450,000 visitors signed up for country locater on Shutdown Day website.
* The idea of Shutdown Day featured on more than 200,000 online forums discussions, television interviews, and popular media.  Services that covered Shutdown Day included Globe and Mail, CNN, Fox News,&lt;ref name="Fox  News 07"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,253373,00.html|title=Get Ready for Shutdown Day|last=Hughes|first=Spencer|date=20 February 2007|work=The News According to Hughes|publisher=Fox News Radio|accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and TV5.{{Where|date=July 2011}}

Later in 2007, as Bystrov was discussing the future of Shutdown Day with another friend, Ashutosh Rajekar, also a victim of excessive technology use, he realized that both had some interesting ideas to share regarding the future direction of Shutdown Day. Eventually, Denis, Nikolay and Ashutosh decided to team up to register as a non-profit organization in the province of Quebec.

In 2008, ''Shutdown Day'' was held on May 3. The message to turn off computers and engage in a day without technology was carried by Reuters wire services two days prior to the second annual event. Rajekar's message was now indicating that computers, televisions, and technology in general was having a negative effect on society.&lt;ref name="Reuters 2008"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSN3044340220080501|title=Shutdown Day advocates say go offline, get outside|last=Mollins|first=Julie|date=May 1, 2008|publisher= Thomson Reuters|accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly prior to the event, Reuters carried a story encouraging users to step away from their technology for 24 hours.  The estimated that the inaugural 2007 event had garnered over 50,000 participants. Many of the group had plans to visit parks, engage in cleaning up public areas, enjoy hiking, camping, and outdoor photography.&lt;ref name="Reuters-2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSN3044340220080501|title=Shutdown Day advocates say go offline, get outside|date=May 1, 2008|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2009 ===
Shutdown day 2009 was held on May 2.&lt;ref name="Shutdown day - home"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shutdownday.org/|title=Shutdown Day|publisher=shutdownday.org|accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The campaign started on March 1 and lasted through May 2, 2009. IT Wire reported that media organizations such as [[Fox News]], [[CNN]], [[The Toronto Sun]], The [[Washington Post]] were now carrying stories about Shutdown Day.&lt;ref name="ITWire 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itwire.com/content/view/24587/545/|title=Shutdown Day 2009 |date=April 22, 2009|publisher=IT Wire|accessdate=2009-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  C|Net reported that by April 23, almost 55,000 people had agreed to turn off their computers for 24 hours by going to shutdownday.org and clicking on the "yes, I can do it" link.&lt;ref name="cnet 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-6169942-7.html|title=Shutdown Day dares you to turn off your computer this Saturday|last=McCarthy|first=Caroline |work=C{{!}}Net|date=April 23, 2009|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc|accessdate=2009-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company information==

===Finances===
In 2009, the company, under president Chie Sugawara (菅原 千恵), had 128 employees (27 male and 101 female) and a capital of 100 million yen (about US$1.1 million). For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009, SOD had total sales of 14.9 billion yen (about US$165 million) and a profit of 670 million yen (about US$7.4 million). For 2007 the figures were sales of 13.5 billion yen (about US$120 million) and profit of 900 million yen (about US$8 million). SOD has been a fast-growing company since its foundation, going from sales of 300 million yen in 1996 to 1.5 billion in 1998 to 4.1 billion in 2000, 7.8 billion in 2003, and 9 billion in 2005.&lt;ref name="sodcorp"/&gt; In spite of its rapid growth, it was overtaken in sales volume in the early 2000s by rival AV producer [[Hokuto Corporation|Hokuto]], which also absorbed some of SOD's former companies. After peaking in 2008, Hokuto sales have plunged while annual income at SOD has stayed level at about 15 billion yen (about US$150 million) for the 2008-2010 period allowing it to become once again the largest adult video group in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2012/02/26/national/av-stars-out-to-play-despite-hard-times/#.Ui9Rxn9ZiFy|title=AV stars out to play despite hard times|last=Bull|first=Brett|date=February 26, 2012|publisher=[[Japan Times]]|accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Products===
One director has described their product this way: "SOD's porno is ridiculous. There's nothing really sordid about it" and "different to anything else in the porno world". Some of its most notable approaches have been quiz shows that tested the knowledge of [[AV idol|AV (adult video) actresses]] with challenging questions, CFNM ([[clothed female, naked male]]) videos that have women studying a man's penis (the "Uniforms, Undies and All Naked School Multi-Story" series), and plots where women are put under hypnosis. There have also been nude sports series, the senior citizen epic "All Naked Nursing Home for the Elderly", Company Sex Parties, Summer Festivals (a festival focused on penises and not to be confused with the actual Shinto festival dealing with fertility) and Sex Camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Offbeat erotica pumps porno-maker into big time|last=Connell|first=Ryann|url=http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2001/06/20010605p2g00m0dm999000c.html|work=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|date=June 5, 2001|accessdate=2007-03-06}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} This source is no longer available but a copy of the article can be accessed at http://cid-88684d2bf683ba51.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/mainichi/moto/2001/2001.06/Offbeat%20erotica%20pumps%20porno-maker%20into%20big%20time.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

One of their releases from May 2006, ''[[500 Person Sex]]'' (''500人SEX''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/mono/dvd/-/detail/=/cid=1open0604/|title=人類史上初！！超ヤリまくり！イキまくり！500人SEX！！|accessdate=2008-12-10|language=Japanese|publisher=DMM|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122030447/http://www.dmm.co.jp/mono/dvd/-/detail/%3D/cid%3D1open0604|archivedate=2009-01-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; features 250 couples having sex (apart from each other but in the same room) in an impressive synchronized way, and thus got some raised eyebrows from occidental adult sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethnorotica.com/article/129/500-person-japanese-orgy|title=500 Person Japanese Orgy|accessdate=2007-03-06|date=June 13, 2006|work=ethnorotica.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223230940/http://ethnorotica.com/article/129/500-person-japanese-orgy|archivedate=February 23, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video received a special jury award at the 2006 [[AV Open]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allabout.co.jp/entertainment/adultvideo/closeup/CU20060712A/index2.htm|title=速報！AV OPEN結果発表 (Preliminary AV Open results Page 2)|publisher=All About|last=Otsubo|first=Kemuta|date=July 12, 2006|accessdate=2008-12-09|language=Japanese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129145455/http://allabout.co.jp/entertainment/adultvideo/closeup/CU20060712A/index2.htm|archivedate=January 29, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2003, SOD was releasing more than 1,000 adult video titles per year.&lt;ref name="japaninc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japaninc.com/article.php?articleID=1188|title=The Ray Kroc of Adult Video|publisher=Japan Inc|accessdate=2009-04-01|last=McNeill|first=David|date=September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; SOD also works with a number of companies in other areas and has thus become a group ([[zaibatsu]]) of companies mainly in the area of producing adult videos. Besides producing videos the company also produces condoms and lubricant lotions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.sod.co.jp/ec/goods/f_main.jsp|title=Tenga|publisher=SOD|accessdate=2008-12-11|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jbox.com/SEARCH/cure_rock|title=SOD Lotion ~ Emotion Type|publisher=JBOX|accessdate=2008-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; PC games (aka [[hentai games]]), and adult [[anime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208082312/http://www.37c-binetsu.com/|archivedate=February 8, 2010|url=http://anime.sod.co.jp/index2.html|title=Anime On Demand|publisher=anime.sod.co.jp|accessdate=2015-11-16|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of the adult area, SOD is also involved in producing softcore and genre movies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/company/co0097320/|title=Soft on Demand [jp]|publisher=[[IMdB]]|accessdate=2008-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; idol videos and TV programs. Among their mainstream movies, some have featured SOD AV actresses including the 2008 horror film ''[[Yoroi Samurai Zombie]]'' with [[Nana Natsume]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1298724/|title=Yoroi (2008)|accessdate=2008-10-20|publisher=[[IMDb]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2006 comedy-drama ''[[Tokyo Daigaku Monogatari]]'', directed by [[Tatsuya Egawa]] and featuring Sasa Handa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0781085/|title=Tôkyô Daigaku monogatari|accessdate=2009-04-29|publisher=[[IMDb]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third entry was the 2014 science fiction film ''[[Danger Dolls]]'', with SOD star [[Mana Sakura]] making an appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2014/05/14/godzilla-filmmaker-shusuke-kaneko-to-debut-sci-fi-action-film-danger-dolls-at-cannes/|title=Godzilla Filmmaker Shusuke Kaneko to Debut Sci-Fi Action Film DANGER DOLLS at Cannes|publisher=SciFi Japan|accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the company announced plans to produce an adaptation of the [[Shougakukan]] ''[[Big Comic Original]]'' [[manga]] series ''Ajisai no Uta'' (''Song of Hydrangea'') as an [[original video animation]] (OAV) for a general audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animaxis.com/en/zine/newsletter/view.asp?id=N001249|title=Major Adult Film Company to Produce Children's Anime|publisher=Animaxis.com|accessdate=2009-04-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527013737/http://www.animaxis.com/en/zine/newsletter/view.asp?id=N001249|archivedate=2008-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2004-07-15/ajisai-no-uta-oav|title=Ajisai no Uta OAV|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2009-04-04|date=July 15, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Volume 1 of the series was released in August 2004 and the fourth and final volume came out in December of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sod.co.jp/demand/anime/index.html|script-title=ja:あじさいの唄|publisher=SOD|accessdate=2009-04-04|language=Japanese|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110100714/http://www.sod.co.jp/demand/anime/index.html|archive-date=2009-01-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SOD Create===
Internally, SOD outsources work to its individual units, original video production being done by SOD Create Inc. ({{nihongo2|SODクリエイト株式会社}}) headed by Daisuke Kasai ({{nihongo2|葛西　大祐}}).&lt;ref name="sodcorp"/&gt; This affiliate, founded in March 1999, was originally called {{nihongo|Hamlet|ハムレット|Hamuretto}} and changed its name to SOD Create in 2001.&lt;ref name="sodcorp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1999.htm|title=1999|accessdate=2010-06-21|publisher=AV Research Laboratory|language=Japanese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318200334/http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1999.htm|archivedate=2007-03-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===STOP! STD===
For the past several years, SOD has run a campaign to bring attention to the rise of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STD) in Japan and to increase the use of condoms. The program, called STOP! STD, has used former SOD star [[Nana Natsume]] as a spokeswoman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sod.co.jp/stopstd/|title=STOP! STD|publisher=SOD]|accessdate=2008-12-11|language=Japanese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20050617041556/http://www.sod.co.jp/stopstd/|archivedate=2005-06-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SOD AV Awards &amp; the AV Open===
From 2002 to 2006, the company held the [[Japanese Adult Video Awards#SOD AV Awards (2002–2006)|SOD AV Awards]], an annual ceremony to present a series of awards to honor actresses, directors, and staff of companies in the SOD group. In 2006, the company also sponsored, along with [[Tokyo Sports]], a wider award contest called the [[AV Open]]. Sixteen companies competed for a total prize pool of 25 Million yen with the winner being decided by sales of the videos entered in the contest.&lt;ref name="javnews"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513052400/http://www.superjav.com/blog/?p=95|archivedate=May 13, 2009|url=http://www.superjav.com/blog/?p=95|title=JAV News - Are There Japanese Adult Video Awards Like AVN Awards in USA?|publisher=JAV News|date=August 26, 2008|accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second year of the AV Open competition, 19 companies participated and the SOD entry won by a large margin. But it was subsequently discovered that SOD had used company funds to buy thousands of their own videos. SOD was disqualified and the discredited AV Open was replaced the next year by the [[Hokuto Corporation]] sponsored [[AV Grand Prix]].&lt;ref name="javnews"/&gt;

==Content Soft Association==

The Japanese AV industry has several different "ethics groups", which are voluntary organizations to assure adherence with Japanese pornography laws and to regulate content and copyrights. The earliest of these organizations was founded by the major AV companies in 1972 and is known in English as the [[Nihon Ethics of Video Association]] (NEVA) or in Japanese, Nippon Video Rinri Kyōkai (日本ビデオ倫理協会 "Japan Video Morality Association"), usually abbreviated as "Biderin" or "Viderin" (ビデ倫).&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2004/04/63009?currentPage=all |title=Fix for Japan Pop-Culture Addicts |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=2009-02-08 |date=April 12, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viderin.jp/|title=Nihon Ethics of Video Association|publisher=[[Nihon Ethics of Video Association]] |accessdate=2009-02-08|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, SOD in 1996 began its own regulatory group known as the Media Ethics Association (Media Rinri Kyōkai or メディア倫理協会), usually abbreviated as Medirin(メディ倫). Medirin was composed of "indie" companies, independent AV studios which explored porn themes forbidden by NEVA rules and which used a smaller-pixeled censorship mosaic for their videos.&lt;ref Name="wired"/&gt; Medirin was re-organized in 2005 to form the Content Soft Association (CSA), called in Japanese Content Soft Kyōdō Kumiai (コンテンツ・ソフト協同組合 "Software Content Association"), to review and regulate adult videos and adult game software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.contents-soft.or.jp/index.html |title=コンテンツ・ソフト協同組合 (Content Soft Association) |publisher=CSA |accessdate=2009-02-17 |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225110445/http://contents-soft.or.jp/index.html |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSA has more than 65 members among AV producers comprising most of the SOD group and some other major companies.

A '''switcheroo''' is a sudden unexpected variation or reversal,&lt;ref name="AmericanHeritageDictionary "&gt;{{cite book |title= The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition= Third |year= 1992 |publisher= [[Houghton Mifflin]] Company |isbn= 0-395-44895-6|page=1816| author = executive editor, Anne H. Soukhanov}}&lt;/ref&gt; often for a humorous purpose.&lt;ref name="TimeMagazine"&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine= Time Magazine |issue=  |page=25 |title= Woody Allen: Rabbit Running |last= Kanfer |first= Vedi S. |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,877848,00.html |accessdate= 2010-05-24 |date= 1972-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is colloquially used in reference to an act of intentionally or unintentionally swapping two objects.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

As a [[comedic device]], this was a favorite of [[Woody Allen]]; for a time, he used so many switcheroos that friends referred to him as "Allen Woody."&lt;ref name="TimeMagazine" /&gt;  Some of Allen's switcheroo gags include:
*Carrying a sword on the street; in case of an attack it turned into a cane, so people would feel sorry for him
*Carrying a bullet in his breast pocket; he claimed someone once threw a Bible at him and the bullet saved his life.

Another example comes from the film ''[[The Aristocrats (film)|The Aristocrats]]'', wherein [[Wendy Liebman]] pulls "the old switcheroo".  Whereas the joke normally is narrated as a vulgar series of actions followed by the clean punch line, Liebman narrates a very aristocratic series of actions followed by a very vulgar punch line.&lt;ref name="Aristocrats"&gt;{{cite book
| title = The Aristocrats| last = Provenza| first =Paul | coauthors = | year = 2005| publisher = Mighty Cheese Productions| id = IMDB tt0436078}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfaKld5ahfw|title=Video of Wendy Liebman's "Aristocrats" contribution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', [[Douglas Hofstadter]] names one of the rules in his version of [[propositional calculus]] the '''Switcheroo Rule''', apparently in honour of an Albanian railroad engineer, name Q. Q. Switcheroo, who "worked in logic on the siding".&lt;ref name="GEB"&gt;{{cite book
| title = Gödel, Escher, Bach | last = Hofstadter | first = Douglas R. | coauthors = | year = 1979 | publisher = Basic Books |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in reality the ''[[Material implication (rule of inference)|material implication]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4902">'''Terence "Terry" Hall''' (20 November 1926 – 3 April 2007) was an English [[ventriloquist]]. He appeared regularly on television with his puppet, '''Lenny the Lion''', whose catchphrase was "Aw, don't embawass me!" Hall is credited with having been one of the first ventriloquists to use a non-human puppet.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,2090807,00.html Obituary], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 30 May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Hall was born in [[Chadderton]], [[Lancashire]], where his parents ran a [[working men's club]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; He was educated at St Patrick's School in [[Oldham]] and at De La Salle College in [[Pendleton, Greater Manchester|Pendleton]], [[County Borough of Salford|Salford]]. Hall initially worked as a ventriloquist with a boy dummy, named Mickey Finn, and won a talent show aged 15.

Hall created Lenny the Lion in 1954 after he visited the zoo while working at the [[summer season]] in [[Blackpool]]. Lenny was made from an old fox fur and [[papier-mâché]], with a golf ball for the nose. He originally had a mouthful of fearsome teeth, but they were removed at the suggestion of singer [[Anne Shelton (singer)|Anne Shelton]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} to avoid scaring children in the audience.

Hall and Lenny first appeared on BBC Television in 1956, in a variety show entitled ''Dress Rehearsal'' that also signalled [[Eric Sykes]]'s television debut. The ''Lenny the Lion Show'' ran on from 1957 to 1960, followed by ''Lenny's Den'' in 1959 to 1961, and the pop music show ''Pops and Lenny'' in 1962 to 1963. In 1958 Bill Mevin created a comic strip based on ''Lenny the Lion''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/m/mevin_bill.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Hall visited the United States in 1958, making his debut on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' with Lenny that year. Throughout the 1960s, Hall and Lenny appeared on stage in Blackpool and on television. [[The Beatles]] made one of their early TV appearances in a 1963 episode of ''Pops and Lenny'', singing "[[From Me to You]]" and "[[Please Please Me (song)|Please, Please Me]]." [[David Bowie]]'s father, Hayward Jones, worked on the show, and launched the Lenny the Lion Fan Club. Lenny advertised [[Cadbury|Trebor]] mints for three years. Hall released a single, "Lenny's Bath Time", in 1963.

In spite of the fact that Hall was a staunch [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] fan, during the 1957–58 English football season, Hall took Lenny to [[The Old Den|the Den (old)]] which was then the home of [[Millwall F.C.]] and allowed Lenny to pose with his "fellow Lions" for publicity shots, much to the delight of all present in the ground.&lt;ref name="Bethel"&gt;Bethel, Chris. ''Millwall Football Club 1940–2001'' Tempus Publishing Ltd. p44. {{ISBN|0-7524-2187-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall and Lenny continued to work in variety through the 1970s, appearing on television in programmes such as ''[[Crackerjack (TV series)|Crackerjack]]''&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; and ''[[3-2-1]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkG9yXKbKmA|title=3-2-1 - 'Hollywood' (1978)|first=|last=gbgameshows|date=31 October 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1977 to 1980, Hall regularly appeared in the educational television programme ''Reading With Lenny''. He wrote the ''Kevin the Kitten'' series of children's reading books which accompanied the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastforschools.co.uk/site/Reading_with_Lenny|title=Reading with Lenny - BroadcastForSchools.co.uk|website=www.broadcastforschools.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall married twice. He had two daughters from his first marriage. He married a second time in 1980, to dance teacher Denise Francis. He suffered from [[Alzheimer's disease]] in later life, and died in 2007 in [[Coventry]] aged 80. [[Dr. Harry Brünjes|Dr Harry Brünjes]], a long-standing family friend, gave the eulogy at the service.

'''''The County Hound 2''''' is the second [[studio album]] by American rapper [[Cashis]], who also served as executive producer. It was released independently on October 15, 2013, by his label Bogish Brand Entertainment. It serves as the sequel to his debut [[Extended Play|EP]] ''[[The County Hound EP]]'', which was released on May 22, 2007 by [[Shady Records]] and [[Interscope Records]]. The album features [[guest appearance]]s by [[Crooked I]] from [[Slaughterhouse (group)|Slaughterhouse]], [[Obie Trice]], [[Mistah F.A.B.]], Kuniva from [[D12]], [[King Los]], K. Young, [[Rostrum Records|Boaz]], and [[Demrick]] among others. [[Hip hop production|Production]] for the album took place during 2013, and was handled primarily by Rikanatti and [[Eminem]] among others. The album was supported by eight singles — "Layin' in the Cut", "Mind on Money", "Imma Hustla", "Look at Me", "Hi", "Take the Pain", "Bright Lights" and "Red". It was also met with positive reviews from [[music critic]]s.

== Background ==
Just prior to the release of his debut album ''The Art of Dying'', [[Cashis]] revealed he had already begun to work on his second studio album ''Euthanasia'', which he claimed was 65% done in September 2012. He also revealed that it would feature production from [[Jake One]] and [[Eminem]], also while projecting a May 2013 release for the project.&lt;ref name="www.hiphopdx.com"&gt;{{cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Cashis Details Album Delay, Relives Moment Eminem Offered To Help Him With Drug Rehab | url = http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.1959/title.cashis-details-album-delay-relives-moment-eminem-offered-to-help-him-with-drug-rehab | publisher = HipHopDX | date =  | accessdate = 27 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the release of the first single in May 2013, the album was renamed ''The County Hound 2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/singles/id.24285/title.Cashis-Layin+In+The+Cut+%5BProd.+Eminem+%26+Rikanatti%5D |title=Cashis - Layin In The Cut [Prod.

''The County Hound 2'' was met with generally positive reviews from [[music critic]]s. Omar Burgess of [[HipHopDX]] gave it a positive review saying, "Ultimately, ''The County Hound 2'' serves as a welcome return for loyal Ca$his fans. Name recognition from his Shady days, production from Eminem and some of the lighter singles will likely draw in newcomers. Repeated listens offer a bottom-heavy album; the first half of which both informs and sometimes detracts from the latter portion with trite subject matter. But there’s enough raw talent here to impress a diverse cross section of fans, and when Ca$his chooses depth over accessibility he’s still scary good in the booth."&lt;ref name="hiphopdxreview"/&gt;

'''Theodoric of York, Medieval Barber''' was a recurring [[comedy|comedic]] [[sketch comedy|sketch]] on the [[United States|American]] television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' during the late 1970s. The title character was  a [[barber surgeon]] played by [[comedian]] [[Steve Martin]], a frequent host of the show. The central gag revolved around Theodoric's insistence on using [[bloodletting]] as a solution to any complaint or illness by his customers. 

In one memorable episode, Theodoric said:
{{quote|You know, medicine is not an exact science, but we are learning all the time. Why, just fifty years ago, they thought a disease like your daughter's was caused by demonic possession or [[witchcraft]]. But nowadays we know that Isabelle is suffering from an imbalance of bodily [[humors]], perhaps caused by a [[toad]] or a small [[dwarfism|dwarf]] living in her stomach.}}

Also, during the sketch he would propose profound, innovative ideas that had the potential to change the course of [[history]], but he would ultimately dismiss them, as in:

{{quote|Wait a minute. Perhaps she's right. Perhaps I've been wrong to blindly follow the medical traditions and superstitions of past centuries. Maybe we barbers should test these assumptions analytically, through experimentation and a "[[scientific method]]". Maybe this scientific method could be extended to other fields of learning: the natural sciences, art, architecture, navigation. Perhaps I could lead the way to a new age, an age of rebirth, a [[Renaissance]]!...Naaaaaahhh!}}

Martin also appeared as Theodoric of York, Medieval Judge, in skits that lampooned both the [[medieval]] and modern judicial systems. In these skits, Martin's character Theodoric would summarily pass judgment based on the outcomes of trials by ordeal, such as throwing the accused, weighted, into a river to see if she would drown, in cases of suspected [[witchcraft]]. If the accused floated, she was determined to be guilty (because only by using her occult powers could she have risen to the surface), and if she sank and drowned, she was innocent. Upon deciding the accused was guilty, Theodoric would refer to the ''Book of Common Wisdom'' (a huge, dusty tome) to decide appropriate punishment. In the case of a man found guilty of [[adultery]], Theodoric could not seem to find an appropriate punishment specified in the Book, so he pondered aloud, putting his hand on his chin and gazing up at the ceiling:  

{{quote|Hmmm....if the punishment for theft is cutting off his hand, and the punishment for bearing false witness is cutting out his tongue....what shall the punishment for adultery be?}}

As with Theodoric of York, Medieval Barber, Martin would end his Medieval Judge skits by proposing modern legal concepts such as [[Trial by jury|trial by a jury of one's peers]], provision of [[defense counsel]], [[Presumption of innocence|innocence until proven guilty]], prohibition of [[cruel and unusual punishment]]s, etc., but end by saying... "Naaaaaaaahhh!"

A similar skit (appearing only once) was aired on ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' around the same time, focusing on a medieval couple living in England in the same era, and was called '''Master Ralph Roister Doister'''.

[[File:Hank Sanicola, Toots Shor Frank Sinatra 1947.jpg|thumb|[[Hank Sanicola]], Toots Shor, and [[Frank Sinatra]] in 1947]]
'''Bernard "Toots" Shor''' (May 6, 1903&amp;nbsp;– January 23, 1977)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Dave|title=Toots Shor, 73, 'Saloonkeeper' and Host, Dies|work=The New York Times|date=24 Jan 1977|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; was best known as the proprietor of a legendary saloon and restaurant, [[Toots Shor's Restaurant]], in [[Manhattan]]. He ran three different establishments under that name, but his first – and most renowned – was located at 51 West 51st Street. He was known as a saloonkeeper, friend, and confidant to some of [[New York City|New York]]'s biggest celebrities during that era.

Shor was born in [[Philadelphia]] to Orthodox Jewish parents&amp;nbsp;– his father of Austrian descent from Germany and his mother from Russia. He and his two older sisters were raised in a home above the family candy store in [[South Philadelphia]]. When Shor was 15 years old, his mother was killed by an automobile while she sat on the stoop outside their home. His father committed suicide five years later. Shor attended the [[Drexel Institute of Technology]] and the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] before working as a traveling shirt-and-underwear [[salesman]].

==First restaurant==

Shor went to [[New York City]] in 1930 and found employment as a bouncer at the Five O'Clock Club, which served as his introduction to celebrities. He later worked at several other nightspots: The Napoleon Club, Lahiff's Tavern, the Ball &amp; Chain, the Madison Royale, and Leon &amp; Eddie's. He became a man about town in Manhattan after opening his own restaurant, [[Toots Shor's]], at 51 West 51st Street. While the food there was known to be "nuttin' fancy"&amp;nbsp;– standard American, sports-bar fare such as shrimp cocktail, steak, baked potato&amp;nbsp;– the establishment became well known for who frequented there and the manner in which Shor interacted with them.

Shor was a raconteur and a master of the "needle," jibes or quips directed at the famous. Celebrity alone was not enough to receive first-class service in Shor's restaurant. According to [[David Halberstam]] in his book ''The Summer of '49'', guests had to observe the unwritten "code" which prevailed in Shor's establishment. [[Charlie Chaplin]], who was not privy to that code, was made to wait in line. When Chaplin complained, Shor told him to entertain the others who were waiting in line. One day, Hollywood boss [[Louis B. Mayer]] complained about waiting twenty minutes for a table and said, "I trust the food will be worth all that waiting." Shor replied: "It'll be better'n some of your crummy pictures I stood in line for." Once while standing outside his restaurant with [[Frank Sinatra]] and a crowd of screaming fans being held back by police, Toots pulled out a dollar bill out of his pocket and said to Frank, "Here, kid, go across the street and buy me a paper." At the Opera with friends during the intermission Toots declared, "I bet I'm the only bum in this joint that doesn't know how this thing ends."

In one incident, Shor outdrank comedian [[Jackie Gleason]], famously leaving Gleason on the floor to prove the point. (At Toots' funeral, the coffin had a spray of red roses with a card which read, "Save a Table for 2," signed: Jackie Gleason.)

Shor cultivated his celebrity following by giving them unqualified admiration, loyal friendship, and a kind of happy, boozy, old-fashioned male privacy. Those whom Shor really liked were called "crum-bums". Shor reputedly said that he didn’t care if he was a millionaire&amp;nbsp;– so long as he could live like one.

==Second restaurant==

In 1959, Shor sold the lease for his [[51st Street (Manhattan)|51st Street]] restaurant for $1.5 million to [[William Zeckendorf]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Toots (film)|Toots]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he opened at a new location at 33 West [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Street]] and tried to emulate the decor and atmosphere of the original. The then–Chief Justice, [[Earl Warren]], considered Toots one of his closest friends. "The Chief" showed up to be photographed with a shovel full of dirt when Toots broke ground on Toots' 52nd street "joint".

==Third restaurant==

In 1971, authorities padlocked the doors of the 52nd Street restaurant for nonpayment of federal, state, and local taxes totaling $269,516. He vowed to open again in three weeks, but 18 months passed before his restaurant at 5 East [[54th Street (Manhattan)|54th Street]] opened. For a variety of reasons, however, his famous clientele never returned with their former regularity.

==Personal life==

Shor and his wife Marion ("Baby") lived for many years in a 12-room double apartment at 480 Park Avenue where they raised their four children named Bari Ellen, Kerry, Rory and Tracey. Tracey, who was Toots' youngest daughter and a late arrival, was taken in and raised by his friends, comedian Bob Hope and his wife Dolores, who was her Godmother at birth and eventually her legal guardian.

During his final years, they lived at the Drake Hotel. He died at age 73, ending a six-week stay in New York University Hospital.

Shor's financial affairs were usually shaky at best thanks to a cavalier attitude toward the IRS, coupled with a generous nature; debts were frequently forgiven for friends who had fallen on hard times, and drinks and meals were comped on a regular basis. Although indigent at the time of death, Shor expressed no regrets, stating that he started out broke and figured it was OK to go out that way as well.

In 1950, Shor was the subject of a three-part biography published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' entitled "Toots's World" and written by John Bainbridge, who later combined them into a book. Twenty years later another biography, ''Toots'', was written by Hearst columnist [[Bob Considine]]. In 2006, the biographical documentary ''[[Toots (documentary film)|Toots]]'', in which his granddaughter Kristi Jacobson profiled his life,&lt;ref name="Barra"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/6/2006_6_16.shtml Allen Barra]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} "Documentary: The Incomparable Toots" ''American Heritage'', Nov./Dec. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]]. It took "Best Film" at the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]]'s first annual film festival on November 12, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.happynews.com/news/11142006/films-recognized-cooperstown-inaugural-baseball-hall-fame-film-festival.htm "Films Recognized at Inaugural Baseball Hall of Fame Film Fest," National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum press release, Wednesday, November 15, 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Toots'' was released to theaters in the fall of 2007.

Bob Broderick, long time friend and Manager of Toots Shor's, was quoted in [[The Record (Troy, NY)|The Record]], NY. 4/20/1968 saying,"Having Toots Shor for a friend and Margaret for a wife is about all a man can ask for out of this life."

From the 1950s-1960s, Shor was an occasional guest on television programs, including twice appearing on the CBS panel show ''[[What's My Line?]]'' as well as on programs such as ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]''.&lt;ref name="tvprograms"&gt;{{IMDb name|1176590|Toots Shor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shor was portrayed by [[Vlasta Vrána]] in ''[[Gleason (2002 film)|Gleason]]'', a 2002 television biopic about the life of [[Jackie Gleason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gallo|first=Phil|title=Gleason|date=10 October 2002|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)]]''|url=https://variety.com/2002/tv/reviews/gleason-1200545545/|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Trapeze Artists in Circus.jpg|thumb|right|Trapeze artists, in lithograph by Calvert Litho. Co., 1890.]]

A '''trapeze''' is a short horizontal bar hung by ropes or metal straps from a support. It is an [[aerialist|aerial]] apparatus commonly found in [[circus (performing arts)|circus performances]].  Trapeze acts may be static, spinning (rigged from a single point), swinging or flying, and may be performed solo, double, triple or as a group act. &lt;ref name=NICA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nica.com.au/dictionary|publisher=National Institute of Circus Arts|title=Circus Dictionary|accessdate=October 1, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719162832/http://www.nica.com.au/dictionary|archivedate=July 19, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The art of trapeze performance was developed by [[Jules Léotard]], a young French [[Acrobatics|acrobat]] and [[aerialist]], in [[Toulouse]] in the mid-1800s. He invented the flying trapeze, practising over his father's swimming pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/j/jules-leotard/|title=Jules Léotard|last=|first=|website=Victoria and Albert Museum|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of trapeze ==

* [[Static trapeze]] refers to a trapeze act in which the performer moves around the bar and ropes, performing a wide range of movements including balances, drops, hangs while the bar itself stays generally static.  The difficulty on a static trapeze is making every move look effortless.  It is like dance, in that most people of a reasonable level of strength can get onto the trapeze bar for the first time and perform some basic tricks, but an experienced artist will do them with much more grace and style.
* [[Swinging trapeze]] (or swinging single trapeze) refers to an act performed on a trapeze swinging in a forward - backward motion.  The performer builds up swing from a still position, and uses the momentum of the swing to execute the tricks.  Usually tricks on a swinging trapeze are thrown on the peaks of the swing and involve dynamic movements that require precise timing.  Most of the tricks begin with the performer sitting or standing on the bar and end with the performer catching the bar in his/her hands or in an ankle hang (hanging by the ankles by bracing them between the rope and the bar). This act requires a great deal of strength, grace, and flexibility.&lt;ref name=NICA /&gt; The trapeze bar is weighted and often has cable inside the supporting ropes for extra strength to withstand the dynamic forces of the swing.
* [[Flying trapeze]] refers to a trapeze act where a performer, or "flyer," grabs the trapeze bar and jumps off a high platform, or pedestal board, so that gravity creates the swing. The swing's parts are the "force out" (sometimes called the "cast out") at the far end of the first swing, the beat back and the rise (also known as "seven") as the performer swings back above the pedestal board, and then the trick is thrown at the far end of the second swing. The performer often releases the bar and is caught by another performer, the "catcher," who hangs by his or her knees on another trapeze, or sometimes on a cradle, which can be either stationary or also swinging. People of any size are able to execute basic trapeze maneuvers. Flying trapeze is generally done over a net, or occasionally over water. 
In the UK, many outdoor education centres offer an activity known as 'leap of faith'. This activity invites participants to climb to the top of a narrow pole and jump, arms outstretched, to grab a trapeze bar. Similar to the flying trapeze, gravity creates the swing. In this type of activity, participants are attached via rope and harness and an added challenge to get your legs over the trapeze can be included.
* [[Washington trapeze]] (also known as head trapeze or heavy trapeze) refers to a variation on static and swinging trapeze where the aerialist performs various headstand skills on the bar, which is typically much heavier than a normal trapeze bar and has a small (about 4-inch round) headstand platform on it.  The trapeze is supported by wire cables rather than ropes, and the apparatus will often be lifted and lowered during the act.&lt;ref name=NICA /&gt;
* [[Dance trapeze]] (also known as [[single-point trapeze]]) refers to a trapeze used by many [[modern dance]] companies in [[aerial dance]]. The ropes of the trapeze are often both attached to a single [[swivel]], allowing the trapeze to spin in either small or large circles.
* [[Double trapeze]] (also known as the French trapeze) is a variation on the static trapeze, and features two performers working together on the same trapeze to perform figures and bear each other's weight.  It can also be performed swinging, in which case the act is called "swinging double trapeze."&lt;ref name=NICA /&gt;
* [[Multiple trapeze]][[File:CJ_triple_trapeze_May.jpg|thumb|300px|Triple trapeze]] refers to a number of different shapes and sizes of trapeze, including double trapeze, [[triple trapeze]] and larger multiples designed for use by multiple simultaneous flyers. Shaped trapezes are apparatuses that can take virtually any shape imaginable.
* Duplex Trapeze refer to any trapeze with two layers of hand bars, one on top of the other such that acrobats can jump from the upper and land (or be caught by a catcher) on the lower.

'''Veyshnoria''' ({{lang-ru|Вейшнория|translit=Veyshnoriya}}, {{lang-be|Вейшнорыя|translit=Viejšnoryja}}) is a fictional state created for [[Zapad 2017 exercise|Zapad 2017]], a joint Russo-Belarusian military training exercise. It neighbors Belarus and is an enemy of the [[Union State]]. Veyshnoria occupies most of the [[Grodno Region]] and the northwestern parts of the [[Minsk]] and [[Vitebsk]] regions.&lt;ref name=nn010917&gt; {{cite news | title=«Вейшнорыя», «Весбарыя» і «Лубенія» нападаюць на Беларусь і Расію — сцэнар вучэнняў «Захад-2017»|trans-title = "Veyshnoria", "Vesbaria" and "Luben" attack on Belarus and Russia - a scenario exercise" Zapad-2017 | url = http://nn.by/?c=ar&amp;i=196541 | work= [[Nasha Niva]] | access-date = 1 September 2017 | language = be|date=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news | title = Belarus at 'war' with imaginary country of Veyshnoria | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-41107540?SThisFB | publisher= [[BBC]] | access-date = 1 September 2017|date=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are two other fictional enemies of the Zapad 2017 participants: Vesbaria and Lubenia.&lt;Ref name=vbl/&gt;
Lubenia straddles the [[Suwalki gap]] and covers parts of northeastern Poland and southwestern Lithuania, while Vesbaria covers the rest of Lithuania and central Latvia.

The "proclamation" of the state caused a response on the Internet, often humorous.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vie.today/?language=eng Republic of Veishnoria: Official page and social network]&lt;/ref&gt; Since September 2017, a web-based Veyshnoria have been proclaimed, which started acquiring the signs of an internet-based [[micronation]] with more than 10 thousand people signing for "citizenship"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://officelife.media/news/as-invented-the-state-has-become-a-business-project |title = Как придуманное государство стало бизнес-проектом| language = ru| trans-title= As invented the state has become a business-project|date = 8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://dev.by/lenta/main/chto-zastavlyaet-belorusov-emigrirovat-v-veyshnoriyu-i-brat-s-soboy-tyurmu |title = Что заставляет белорусов эмигрировать в Вейшнорию и «брать с собой тюрьму»| language = ru| trans-title=What makes Belarusians emigrate to Veyshnoria and "take prison with them"|date = 17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toponomy==
The name "Veyshnoria" comes from the Baltic name of Veisnor (Lithuanian "Vaišnoras", Old Prussian "Waisnor") – "one who willingly treats" (hospitable).&lt;Ref name=vbl&gt; {{cite news | title = Вейшнорыя, Весбарыя, Лубенія: што азначаюць назвы ўмоўных ворагаў Беларусі|trans-title=Veyshnoria, Vesbaria, Lubenia: What are the names of the enemies of Belarus| url = http://nn.by/?c=ar&amp;i=196570 | work= [[Nasha Niva]] | accessdate = 1 September 2017 | language = be|date=29 August 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt; There are several places in Lithuania called Vaišnoriai (plural for "Vaišnoras").&lt;ref&gt;[[:lt:Vaišnoriai (Šiauliai)|Vaišnoriai (Šiauliai)]], [[:lt:Vaišnoriai (Joniškis)|Vaišnoriai (Joniškis)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zapad 2017 scenario==
Zapad 2017 was a joint strategic military exercise of the armed forces of the [[Russian Federation]] and [[Belarus]] (the [[Union State of Russia and Belarus]]) held 14–20 September 2017, in Belarus as well as in Russia′s [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] and other north-western areas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Глава Минобороны Белоруссии: учение "Запад-2017" не направлено против третьих стран|url=http://tass.ru/opinions/interviews/4419507|agency=[[TASS]]|accessdate=1 September 2017|language=ru|trans-title=The head of the Belarusian Defense Ministry: the "Zapad-2017" doctrine is not directed against third-world countries|first=Yuri|last=Shamshur|date=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the scenario a conflict between "The North" (the Union State) and "The West" (a coalition of three aggressor states: Veyshnoria, Vesbaria and Lubenia) developed. "The West" tries to split the union of Belarus and Russia, worsen the socio-economic situation in the Union State, and force a change of leadership, and Veyshnoria is trying to annex parts of Belarus. After that, "the West" sends its troops enter the rest of the territory of Belarus.

In a post on [[Facebook]], Belarusian economic analyst Sergey Chaly noticed a similarity between Veyshnoria and the region of Belarus where a large percentage of voters supported [[Zianon Pazniak]] in the first round of the [[Belarusian presidential election, 1994|1994 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = «Варожая Вейшнорыя» супадае з электаральнай картай Пазняка за 1994 год| trans-title="Enemy Veyshnoria" coincides with the electoral map Pozniak 1994 | url =http://nn.by/?c=ar&amp;i=196590 | work= [[Nasha Niva]]| date= 29 August 2017 | accessdate = 1 September 2017 | language = be}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Leonid Bershidsky]] further pointed out that this territory has a high proportion of Catholic population and a high share of Belarusian-language speakers in the bilingual Russian-Belarusian state with dominant [[Russian Orthodox]] church. In Bershidsky's view these observations may be how the Zapad 2017 scenario was intended to be seen: Veyshnoria seeks destabilizaton of Belarus the same way, in the eyes of the Russian establishment, it happened in Ukraine (by pro-Western national forces, allegedly fomented by "[[Western world|the West]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Belarusian Twitter users are swearing allegiance to a fictional country invented for Moscow's ‘Zapad 2017’ war-games | url =https://meduza.io/en/shapito/2017/08/31/belarusian-twitter-users-are-swearing-allegiance-to-a-fictional-country-invented-for-moscow-s-zapad-2017-war-games | publisher = [[Meduza]] | date= 31 August 2017| accessdate = 26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bershidsky|first1=Leonid|title=The Zapad Military Exercise Reveals Putin's Fear|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-09-15/the-zapad-military-exercise-reveals-putin-s-fear|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=27 September 2017|ref=bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet reaction==
The creation quickly found a humorous response in [[social media]].&lt;ref name=vgolos&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vgolos.com.ua/news/kraina_veyshnoriya_zavoyovuie_zhartivlyvu_populyarnist_v_sotsmerezhah_280539.html|title=Країна Вейшнорія завойовує жартівливу популярність в соцмережах|language=uk|trans-title=The country of Veyshnoria gains humorous popularity in social networks|date=2 September 2017|accessdate=2 September 2017|work=Vgolos}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 August 2017, a satirical [[Twitter]] account of the Foreign Ministry of Veyshnoria appeared, which published political statements on behalf of the state.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; According to the account, the anthem of the state is the song "Niamon" (meaning "[[Neman]]") by the Belarusian band [[Stary Olsa]]. The same account says that the official residences of the state are in [[Grodno]], the parliament and the government (in addition to the Ministry of Culture) in [[Lida]], and the [[cultural capital]] of Veyshnoria is [[Smarhon]].&lt;ref name=vgolos/&gt; Veyshnoria is also present on [[Facebook]],&lt;ref name=vgolos/&gt; and its [[Russian Wikipedia]] article had been noted as "a dry rundown of how Veyshnoria emerged" before the article was deleted and redirected to the article on Zapad 2017.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

Some Belarusian businessmen were quick to monetize Veyshnoria by launching a Veyshnoria website and legally registering it as a gaming service. After Belarusian President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] issued the decree which made [[cryptocurrencies]] a legal method of payment and  the [[Taler (cryptocurrency)|Taler]] cryptocurrency was launched in Belarus, Taler was made the official currency of Veyshnoria. &lt;ref name="DS"&gt;{{cite news|title=Как бы страна.
