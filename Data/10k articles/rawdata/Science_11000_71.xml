      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2859">The '''Academic Word List''' ('''AWL''') was developed by Averil Coxhead at the School of Linguistics and Applied Language Studies at [[Victoria University of Wellington]], New Zealand.  The list contains 570 [[semantic field]]s which were selected because they appear with great frequency in a broad range of academic texts. The list does not include words that are in the most frequent 2000 words of English (the [[A General Service List of English Words|General Service List]]), thus many of the words are specific to academic contexts.  However, a significant percentage of the vocabulary contained within the AWL is of general use; it is simply not of high enough frequency to be contained within the General Service List. Words such as ''area'', ''approach'', ''create'', ''similar'', and ''occur'', for example, are in sublist one, yet are words which one could expect to encounter in everyday life, in newspapers, on television, etc. The AWL was primarily made so that it could be used by teachers (especially teachers of English as a Second Language) as part of a programme preparing learners for tertiary level study or used by students working alone to learn the words most needed to study at colleges and universities.

The 570 words are divided into 10 sublists. The sublists are ordered such that the words in the first sublist are the most frequent words and those in the last sublist are the least frequent.

The [[:simple:wikt:Wiktionary:Academic word list|list]] is available on the [[:simple:wikt:Main Page|Simple English Wiktionary]].

[[File:Advanced Composition Explorer in space.jpg|thumb|ACE in orbit around the Sun–Earth L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; point]]
'''Advanced Composition Explorer''' ('''ACE''') is a [[NASA]] [[Explorers program]] Solar and [[space exploration]] mission to study [[matter]] comprising energetic particles from the [[solar wind]], the [[interplanetary medium]], and other sources.

Real-time data from ACE is used by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] [[Space Weather Prediction Center]] to improve forecasts and warnings of solar storms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = June 24, 1999 | url = https://www.usatoday.com/weather/solar/wswx198.htm | title = Satellite to aid space weather forecasting | accessdate=October 24, 2008 | work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACE [[robotic spacecraft]] was launched August 25, 1997, and entered a [[Lissajous orbit]] close to the {{L1}} [[Lagrangian point]] (which lies between the Sun and the Earth at a distance of some 1.5 million km from the latter) on December 12, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE/ASC/DATA/ace_dly_reprts/HTML/December_text_1997.html&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft is currently operating at that orbit. Because ACE is in a non-Keplerian orbit, and has regular station-keeping maneuvers, the orbital parameters in the adjacent information box are only approximate.

{{as of|2017}}, the spacecraft is still in generally good condition, and is projected to have enough propellant to maintain its orbit until 2024.&lt;ref name = "ACE Home Page"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE/ace_mission.html |title=Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) Mission Overview |publisher=[[California Institute of Technology]] |date=February 10, 2017 |first1=Eric R. |last1=Christian |first2=Andrew J. |last2=Davis |access-date=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NASA [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] managed the development and integration of the ACE spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1997-045A NASA - NSSDC - Spacecraft - Details&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science objectives==

ACE observations allow the investigation of a wide range of fundamental problems in the following four major areas:&lt;ref name=stone98a&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stone|first=E.C.|title=The Advanced Composition Explorer|journal=Space Science Reviews|date=July 1998|volume=86|pages=1–22|doi=10.1023/A:1005082526237|bibcode=1998SSRv...86....1S|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elemental and isotopic composition of matter ===
A major objective is the accurate and comprehensive determination of the elemental and isotopic composition of the various samples of “source material” from which nuclei are accelerated. These observations have been used to:
* Generate a set of solar isotopic abundances based on direct sampling of solar material.
* Determine the coronal elemental and isotopic composition with greatly improved accuracy.
* Establish the pattern of isotopic differences between [[cosmic ray|galactic cosmic ray]] and [[solar system]] matter.
* Measure the elemental and isotopic abundances of [[interstellar medium|interstellar]] and interplanetary “pick–up ions”.
* Determine the isotopic composition of the “anomalous cosmic ray component”, which represents a sample of the local interstellar medium.

===Origin of the elements and subsequent evolutionary processing===
Isotopic “anomalies” in [[meteorites]] indicate that the [[solar system]] was not homogeneous when formed. Similarly, the Galaxy is neither uniform in space nor constant in time due to continuous stellar [[nucleosynthesis]]. 
ACE measurements have been used to:
*Search for differences between the isotopic composition of solar and meteoritic material.
*Determine the contributions of solar–wind and solar energetic particles to lunar and meteoritic material, and to planetary atmospheres and magnetospheres.
*Determine the dominant nucleosynthetic processes that contribute to [[cosmic ray]] source material.
*Determine whether cosmic rays are a sample of freshly synthesized material (e.g., from [[supernovae]]) or of the contemporary [[interstellar medium]].
*Search for isotopic patterns in solar and Galactic material as a test of galactic evolution models.

===Formation of the solar corona and acceleration of the solar wind===
[[Solar energetic particle]], [[solar wind]], and spectroscopic observations show that the elemental composition of the [[corona]] is differentiated from that of the [[photosphere]], although the processes by which this occurs, and by which the [[solar wind]] is subsequently accelerated, are poorly understood. The detailed composition and charge–state data provided by ACE are used to:
*Isolate the dominant coronal formation processes by comparing a broad range of coronal and photospheric abundances.
*Study plasma conditions at the source of [[solar wind]] and [[solar energetic particles]] by measuring and comparing the charge states of these two populations.
*Study [[solar wind]] acceleration processes and any charge or mass–dependent fractionation in various types of [[solar wind]] flows.

===Particle acceleration and transport in nature===
Particle acceleration is ubiquitous in nature and understanding its nature is one of the fundamental problems of space [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] astrophysics. The unique data set obtained by ACE measurements have been used to:
*Make direct measurements of charge and/or mass–dependent fractionation during solar energetic particle and interplanetary acceleration events.
*Constrain [[solar flare]], coronal shock, and interplanetary shock acceleration models with charge, mass, and spectral data spanning up to five decades in energy.
*Test theoretical models for &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He–rich [[solar flare|flares]] and solar γ–ray events.

==Instrumentation==

===Cosmic Ray Isotope Spectrometer (CRIS)===
The Cosmic Ray Isotope Spectrometer covers the highest decade of the Advanced Composition Explorer’s energy interval, from 50 to 500 MeV/nucleon, with isotopic resolution for elements from Z ≈ 2 to 30. The nuclei detected in this energy interval are predominantly [[cosmic rays]] originating in our Galaxy. This sample of galactic matter investigates the [[nucleosynthesis]] of the parent material, as well as fractionation, acceleration, and transport processes that these particles undergo in the Galaxy and in the interplanetary medium. Charge and mass identification with CRIS is based on multiple measurements of dE/dx and total energy in stacks of silicon detectors, and trajectory measurements in a scintillating optical fiber trajectory (SOFT) hodoscope. The instrument has a geometrical factor of 250&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sr for isotope measurements.
&lt;ref name=stone98b&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stone|first=E.C.|title=The Cosmic-Ray Isotope Spectrometer for the Advanced Composition Explorer|journal=Space Science Reviews|date=July 1998|volume=86|pages=285–356|doi=10.1023/A:1005075813033|bibcode=1998SSRv...86..285S|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar Isotope Spectrometer (SIS)===
The Solar Isotope Spectrometer (SIS) provides high resolution measurements of the isotopic
composition of energetic nuclei from He to Zn (Z = 2 to 30) over the energy range from ~10 to ~100 MeV/nucleon. During large solar events SIS measures the isotopic abundances of [[solar energetic particles]] to determine directly the composition of the solar [[corona]] and to
study particle acceleration processes. During solar quiet times SIS measures the isotopes
of low-energy cosmic rays from the Galaxy and isotopes of the anomalous [[cosmic ray]] component, which originates in the nearby interstellar medium. SIS has two telescopes composed of silicon solid-state detectors that provide measurements of the nuclear charge, mass, and
kinetic energy of incident nuclei. Within each telescope, particle trajectories are measured
with a pair of two-dimensional silicon strip detectors instrumented with custom very-large-
scale integrated (VLSI) electronics to provide both position and energy-loss measurements.
SIS was especially designed to achieve excellent mass resolution under the extreme, high flux
conditions encountered in large solar particle events. It provides a geometry factor of 40&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sr, significantly greater than earlier solar particle isotope spectrometers.
&lt;ref name=stone98c&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stone|first=E.C.|title=The Solar Isotope Spectrometer for the Advanced Composition Explorer|journal=Space Science Reviews|date=July 1998|volume=86|pages=357–408|doi=10.1023/A:1005027929871|bibcode=1998SSRv...86..357S|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultra Low Energy Isotope Spectrometer (ULEIS)===

The Ultra Low Energy Isotope Spectrometer (ULEIS) on the ACE spacecraft is an ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometer that measures particle composition and energy spectra of elements He–Ni with energies from ~45 keV/nucleon
to a few MeV/nucleon. ULEIS investigates particles accelerated in [[solar energetic particle]] events, interplanetary shocks, and at the [[solar wind]]
termination shock. By determining energy spectra, mass composition, and their temporal variations
in conjunction with other ACE instruments, ULEIS greatly improves our knowledge of solar
abundances, as well as other reservoirs such as the local [[interstellar medium]]. ULEIS 
combines the high sensitivity required to measure low particle fluxes, along with the capability to
operate in the largest solar particle or interplanetary shock events. In addition to detailed information
for individual ions, ULEIS features a wide range of count rates for different ions and energies that allows accurate determination of particle fluxes and anisotropies over short (few minutes) time scales.
&lt;ref name=mason98&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mason|first=G.M.|title=The Ultra Low Energy Isotope Spectrometer (ULEIS) for the Advanced Composition Explorer|journal=Space Science Reviews|date=July 1998|volume=86|pages=409–448|doi=10.1023/A:1005079930780|bibcode=1998SSRv...86..409M|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar Energetic Particle Ionic Charge Analyzer (SEPICA)===
The Solar Energetic Particle Ionic Charge Analyzer (SEPICA) was the instrument on the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) that determined the ionic charge states of solar and interplanetary energetic particles in the energy range from ≈0.2 MeV nucl-1 to ≈5 MeV charge-1. The charge state of energetic ions contains key information to unravel source temperatures, acceleration, fractionation and transport processes for these particle populations. SEPICA had the ability to resolve individual charge states with a substantially larger geometric factor than its predecessor ULEZEQ on ISEE-1 and -3, on which SEPICA was based. To achieve these two requirements at the same time, SEPICA was composed of one high-charge resolution sensor section and two low- charge resolution, but large geometric factor sections.&lt;ref name=moebius98&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moebius|first=E.|title=The Solar Energetic Particle Ionic Charge Analyzer (SEPICA) and the Data Processing Unit (S3DPU) for SWICS, SWIMS and SEPICA|journal=Space Science Reviews|date=July 1998|volume=86|pages=449–495|doi=10.1023/A:1005084014850|bibcode=1998SSRv...86..449M|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2008, this instrument is no longer functioning due to failed gas valves.&lt;ref name = "ACE Home Page"/&gt;

===Solar Wind Ions Mass Spectrometer (SWIMS) and Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS)===
The Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS) and the Solar Wind Ions Mass Spectrometer (SWIMS) on ACE are instruments optimized for measurements of the chemical and isotopic composition of solar and interstellar matter. SWICS determined uniquely the chemical and ionic-charge composition of the [[solar wind]], the thermal and mean speeds of all major solar wind ions from H through Fe at all solar wind speeds above 300&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (protons) and 170&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (Fe+16), and resolved H and He isotopes of both solar and interstellar sources. SWICS also measured the distribution functions of both the interstellar cloud and dust cloud [[pickup ion]]s up to energies of 100 keV e&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. SWIMS measures the chemical, isotopic and charge state composition of the [[solar wind]] for every element between He and Ni. Each of the two instruments are time-of-flight [[mass spectrometer]]s and use electrostatic analysis followed by the time-of-flight and, as required, an energy measurement.&lt;ref name=gloeckler98&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gloeckler|first=G.|title=Investigation of the composition of solar and interstellar matter using solar wind and pickup ion measurements with SWICS and SWIMS on the ACE spacecraft|journal=Space Science Reviews|date=July 1998|volume=86|pages=497–539|doi=10.1023/A:1005036131689|bibcode=1998SSRv...86..497G|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://solar-heliospheric.engin.umich.edu/ace/ | title = ACE/SWICS &amp; ACE/SWIMS | publisher = The Solar and Heliospheric Research Group | accessdate=June 30, 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060810115838/http://solar-heliospheric.engin.umich.edu/ace/| archivedate=August 10, 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 August 2011, the SWICS time-of-flight electronics experienced an age- and radiation-induced hardware anomaly that increased the level of background in the composition data. To mitigate the effects of this background, the model for identifying ions in the data was adjusted to take advantage of only the ion energy-per-charge as measured by the electrostatic analyzer, and the ion energy as measured by solid state detectors. This has allowed SWICS to continue to deliver a subset of the data products that were provided to the public prior to the hardware anomaly, including ion charge state ratios of oxygen and carbon, and measurements of solar wind iron. The measurements of proton density, speed, and thermal speed by SWICS were not affected by this anomaly and continue to the present day.&lt;ref name = "ACE Home Page"/&gt;

===Electron, Proton, and Alpha-particle Monitor (EPAM)===
The Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor (EPAM) instrument on the ACE spacecraft is designed to measure a broad range of energetic particles over nearly the full unit-sphere at high time resolution.  Such measurements of ions and electrons in the range of a few tens of keV to several MeV are essential to understand the dynamics of [[solar flares]], co-rotating interaction regions (CIR’s), interplanetary shock acceleration, and upstream terrestrial events.  The large dynamic range of EPAM extends from about 50 keV to 5 MeV for ions, and 40 keV to about 350 keV for electrons.  To complement its electron and ion measurements, EPAM is also equipped with a Composition Aperture (CA) which unambiguously identifies ion species reported as species group rates and/or individual pulse-height events.  The instrument achieves its large spatial coverage through five telescopes oriented at various angles to the spacecraft spin axis.  The low-energy particle measurements, obtained as time resolutions between 1.5 and 24 s, and the ability of the instrument to observe particle anisotropies in three dimensions make EPAM an excellent resource to provide the interplanetary context for studies using other instruments on the ACE spacecraft.

===Solar Wind Electron, Proton and Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM)===
The Solar Wind Electron Proton Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM) experiment provides the bulk [[solar wind]] observations for the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE). These observations provide the context for elemental and isotopic composition measurements made on ACE as well as allowing the direct examination of numerous [[solar wind]] phenomena such as [[coronal mass ejection]], interplanetary shocks, and [[solar wind]] fine structure, with advanced, 3-D plasma instrumentation. They also provide an ideal data set for both heliospheric and [[magnetospheric]] multi-spacecraft studies where they can be used in conjunction with other, simultaneous observations from spacecraft such as [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]]. The SWEPAM observations are made simultaneously with independent electron (SWEPAM-e) and ion (SWEPAM-i) instruments. In order to save costs for the ACE project, SWEPAM-e and SWEPAM-i are the recycled flight spares from the joint [[NASA]]/[[ESA]] [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]] mission. Both instruments had selective refurbishment, modification, and modernization required to meet the ACE mission and spacecraft requirements. Both incorporate electrostatic analyzers whose fan-shaped fields of view sweep out all pertinent look directions as the spacecraft spins. 
&lt;ref name=mccomas98&gt;{{cite journal|last=McComas|first=D.J.|title=Solar Wind Electron Proton Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM) for the Advanced Composition Explorer|journal=Space Science Reviews|date=July 1998|volume=86|pages=563–612|doi=10.1023/A:1005040232597|bibcode=1998SSRv...86..563M|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetometer (MAG)===
The magnetic field experiment on ACE provides continuous measurements of the local magnetic field in the interplanetary medium. These measurements are essential in the interpretation of simultaneous ACE observations of energetic and thermal particles distributions. The experiment consists of a pair of twin, boom- mounted, triaxial fluxgate sensors which are located 165 inches (=4.19 m) from the center of the spacecraft on opposing solar panels.  The two triaxial sensors provide a balanced, fully redundant vector instrument and permit some enhanced assessment of the spacecraft's magnetic field.

===ACE Real Time Solar Wind (RTSW)===
The Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) RTSW system is continuously monitoring the [[solar wind]] and producing warnings of impending major geomagnetic activity, up to one hour in advance. Warnings and alerts issued by [[NOAA]] allow those with systems sensitive to such activity to take preventative action. The RTSW system gathers solar wind and energetic particle data at high time resolution from four ACE instruments (MAG, SWEPAM, EPAM, and SIS), packs the data into a low-rate bit stream, and broadcasts the data continuously. NASA sends real-time data to NOAA each day when downloading science data. With a combination of dedicated ground stations (CRL in Japan and RAL in Great Britain), and time on existing ground tracking networks (NASA's DSN and the USAF's AFSCN), the RTSW system can receive data 24 hours per day throughout the year. The raw data are immediately sent from the ground station to the [[Space Weather Prediction Center]] in Boulder, Colorado, processed, and then delivered to its Space Weather Operations Center where they are used in daily operations; the data are also delivered to the CRL Regional Warning Center at Hiraiso, Japan, to the USAF 55th Space Weather Squadron, and placed on the World Wide Web. The data are downloaded, processed and dispersed within 5 min from the time they leave ACE. The RTSW system also uses the low-energy energetic particles to warn of approaching interplanetary shocks, and to help monitor the flux of high-energy particles that can produce radiation damage in satellite systems.

=== The spectra of particles observed by ACE ===
[[File:ACE O Fluence.png|thumbnail|Oxygen fluences observed by ACE]]
The figure shows the particle fluence (total flux over a given period of time) of oxygen at ACE for a time period just after solar minimum, the part of the 11-year solar cycle when solar activity is lowest.&lt;ref name=mewaldt01&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mewaldt|first=R.A.|title=Long-term fluences of energetic particles in the heliosphere|journal=AIP Conf. Proc.|date=2001|volume=86|pages=165–170|doi=10.1063/1.1433995|bibcode=2001AIPC..598..165M|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest-energy particles come from the slow and fast solar wind, with speeds from about 300 to about 800 kilometers per second. Like the solar wind distribution of all ions, that of oxygen has a suprathermal tail of higher-energy particles; that is, in the frame of the bulk solar wind, the plasma has an energy distribution that is approximately a thermal distribution but has a notable excess above about 5 kiloelectron volts, as shown in Figure 1. The ACE team has made contributions to understanding the origins of these tails and their role in injecting particles into additional acceleration processes.

At energies higher than those of the solar wind particles, ACE observes particles from regions known as corotating interaction regions (CIRs). CIRs form because the solar wind is not uniform. Due to solar rotation, high-speed streams collide with preceding slow solar wind, creating shock waves at roughly 2–5 astronomical units (AU, the distance between Earth and the Sun) and forming CIRs. Particles accelerated by these shocks are commonly observed at 1 AU below energies of about 10 megaelectron volts per nucleon. ACE measurements confirm that CIRs include a significant fraction 
of singly charged helium formed when interstellar neutral helium is ionized.&lt;ref name=moebius02&gt;{{cite journal|last=Möbius|first=E.|title=Charge states of energetic (~ 0.5 MeV/n) ions in corotating interaction regions at 1 AU and implications on source populations|journal=Geophys. Res. Lett.|date=2002|volume=29|issue=2|pages=1016|doi=10.1029/2001GL013410|bibcode=2002GeoRL..29.1016M|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At yet higher energies, the major contribution to the measured flux of particles is due to solar energetic particles (SEPs) associated with interplanetary (IP) shocks driven by fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flares. Enriched abundances of helium-3 and helium ions show that the suprathermal tails are the main seed population for these SEPs.&lt;ref name=desai01&gt;{{cite journal|last=Desai|first=M.I.|title=Acceleration of &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He nuclei at interplanetary shocks|journal=Astrophysical Journal|date=2001|volume=553|issue=1|pages=L89–L92|doi=10.1086/320503|bibcode=2001ApJ...553L..89D|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; IP shocks traveling at speeds up to about 2000 kilometers per second accelerate particles from the suprathermal tail to 100 megaelectron volts per nucleon and more. IP shocks are particularly important because they can continue to accelerate particles as they pass over ACE and thus allow shock acceleration processes to be studied in situ.

Other high-energy particles observed by ACE are anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs) that originate with neutral interstellar atoms that are ionized in the inner heliosphere to make “pickup” ions and are later accelerated to energies greater than 10 megaelectron volts per nucleon in the outer heliosphere. ACE also observes pickup ions directly; they are easily identified because they are singly charged. Finally, the highest-energy particles observed by ACE are the galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), thought to be accelerated by shock waves from supernova explosions in our galaxy.

=== Other findings from ACE ===
Shortly after launch, the SEP sensors on ACE detected solar events that had unexpected characteristics. Unlike most large, 
shock-accelerated SEP events, these were highly enriched in iron and helium-3, as are the much smaller, flare-associated impulsive SEP events.&lt;ref name=cohen99&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=C.M.S.|title=Inferred charge states of high energy solar particles from the solar isotope spectrometer on ACE|journal=Geophys. Res. Lett.|date=1999|volume=26|issue=2|pages=149–152|doi=10.1029/1998GL900218|bibcode=1999GeoRL..26..149C|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mason99&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mason|first=G.M.|title=Particle acceleration and sources in the November 1997 solar energetic particle events|journal=Geophys. Res. Lett.|date=1999|volume=26|issue=2|pages=141–144|doi=10.1029/1998GL900235|bibcode=1999GeoRL..26..141M|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the first year of operations, ACE found many of these “hybrid” events, which led to substantial discussion within the community as to what conditions could 
generate them.&lt;ref name=cohen12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=C.M.S.|title=Observations of the longitudinal spread of solar energetic particle events in solar cycle 24|journal=AIP Conf. Proc.|date=2012|volume=1436|pages=103–109|doi=10.1063/1.4723596|bibcode=2012AIPC.1436..103C|display-authors=etal|series=&lt;!-- --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One remarkable recent discovery in heliospheric physics has been the ubiquitous 
presence of suprathermal particles with common spectral shape. This shape unexpectedly occurs in the quiet solar wind; 
in disturbed conditions downstream from shocks, including CIRs; and elsewhere in the heliosphere. These observations have led Fisk and Gloeckler &lt;ref name=fisk08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisk|first=L.A.|title=Acceleration of suprathermal tails in the solar wind|journal=Astrophysical Journal|date=2008|volume=686|issue=2|pages=1466–1473|doi=10.1086/591543|bibcode=2008ApJ...686.1466F|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; to suggest a novel mechanism for the particles’ acceleration.

Another discovery has been that the current solar cycle, as measured by sunspots, CMEs, and SEPs, has been much less magnetically active than the previous cycle. McComas et al.&lt;ref name=mccomas08&gt;{{cite journal|last=McComas|first=D.J.|title=Weaker solar wind from the polar coronal holes and the whole Sun|journal=Geophys. Res. Lett.|date=2008|volume=35|issue=18|pages=L18103|doi=10.1029/2008GL034896|bibcode=2008GeoRL..3518103M|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that the dynamic pressures of the solar wind measured by the Ulysses satellite over all latitudes and by ACE in the ecliptic plane are correlated and were declining in time for about 2 decades. They concluded that the Sun had been undergoing global change that affected the overall heliosphere. Simultaneously, GCR intensities were increasing and in 2009 were the highest recorded during the past 50 years.&lt;ref name=leske11&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leske|first=R.A.|title=Anomalous and galactic cosmic rays at 1 AU during the cycle 23/24 solar minimum|journal=Space Sci. Rev.|date=2011|doi=10.1007/s11214-011-9772-1|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2013SSRv..176..253L|volume=176|issue=1–4|pages=253–263}}&lt;/ref&gt; GCRs have more difficulty reaching Earth when the Sun is more magnetically active, so the high GCR intensity in 2009 is consistent with a globally reduced dynamic pressure of the solar wind.

ACE also measures abundances of cosmic ray nickel-59 and cobalt-59 isotopes; these measurements indicate that a time longer than the half-life of nickel-59 with bound electrons (7.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; years) elapsed between the time nickel-59 was created in a supernova explosion and the time cosmic rays were accelerated.&lt;ref name=wiedenbeck99&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wiedenbeck|first=M.E.|title=Constraints on the time delay between nucleosynthesis and cosmic-ray acceleration from observations of &lt;sup&gt;59&lt;/sup&gt;Ni and &lt;sup&gt;59&lt;/sup&gt;Co|journal=Astrophysical Journal|date=1999|volume=523|issue=1|pages=L61–L64|doi=10.1086/312242|bibcode=1999ApJ...523L..61W|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such long delays indicate that cosmic rays come from the acceleration of old stellar or interstellar material rather than from fresh supernova ejecta. ACE also measures an iron-58/iron-56 ratio that is enriched over the same ratio in solar system material.&lt;ref name=binns05&gt;{{cite journal|last=Binns|first=W.R.|title=Cosmic-ray neon, Wolf-Rayet stars, and the superbubble origin of galactic cosmic rays|journal=Astrophysical Journal|date=2005|volume=634|issue=1|pages=351–364|doi=10.1086/496959|bibcode=2005ApJ...634..351B|display-authors=etal|arxiv = astro-ph/0508398 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These 
and other findings have led to a theory of the origin of cosmic rays in galactic superbubbles, formed in regions where many 
supernovae explode within a few million years. Recent observations of a cocoon of freshly accelerated cosmic rays in the Cygnus superbubble by the Fermi gamma-ray observatory&lt;ref name=ackermann11&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ackermann|first=M.|title=A cocoon of freshly accelerated cosmic rays detected by Fermi in the Cygnus superbubble|journal=Science|date=2011|volume=334|issue=6059|pages=1103–7|doi=10.1126/science.1210311|bibcode=2011Sci...334.1103A|display-authors=etal|pmid=22116880}}&lt;/ref&gt; support this theory.

On February 11, 2015, the [[Deep Space Climate Observatory]] (DSCOVR)—with several similar instruments including a newer and more sensitive instrument to detect Earth-bound [[coronal mass ejection]]s—successfully launched by [[NOAA]] and [[NASA]] aboard a [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon 9 v1.1|Falcon 9]] launch vehicle from Cape Canaveral, Florida.  The spacecraft arrived at L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; by 8 June 2015, just over 100 days after launch.&lt;ref name="noaa20150608"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/news_archives/DSCOVR_L1_orbit.html |title=Nation’s first operational satellite in deep space reaches final orbit |publisher=NOAA |date=8 June 2015 |accessdate=8 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608182042/http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/news_archives/DSCOVR_L1_orbit.html |archivedate=June 8, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with ACE, both will provide space weather data as long as ACE can continue to function.&lt;ref name=nsf20150208&gt;

The '[[Canadian Shield]] and the [[Innuitian region]]
are located to the south of the Arctic Lowland plains. This is a region of tundra, a treeless plain, with a cold, dry climate and poorly drained soil. The Arctic Lowlands region is located in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories. The Arctic Lowlands are plains located in Canada. Plains are extensive areas of level or gently rolling land. In North America there is a large, flat interior Plain. They are also part of an area that is commonly referred to as the Arctic Archipelago, which occupies much of the central Canadian Arctic. They are made up of a series of islands located in Canada's far north, and remain frozen for most of the year. However, the Paleozoic sedimentary rock, from which the Lowlands are formed, contains lignite (a form of coal), oil, and natural gas deposits. Limestone is very abundant as well. The Arctic Lowlands have a small human population. The terrain is mostly ice, snow, rock, and it is full of marshes, especially in the winter. Animals that live in the area include polar bears, char, Arctic hares and Arctic foxes. This region is being affected by global warming. It is very cold and human life may be difficult. Commonly known as the Hudson Bay-Arctic Lowlands, the Hudson Bay contains over 50% water.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2637">In [[economics]], '''average fixed cost''' ('''AFC''') is the [[fixed cost]]s of production (FC) divided by the quantity (Q) of output produced. Fixed costs are those costs that must be incurred in fixed quantity regardless of the level of output produced.

:&lt;math&gt;AFC=\frac{FC}{Q}.&lt;/math&gt;

Average fixed cost is a per-unit-of-output  of fixed costs.  As the total number of units of the good produced increases, the average fixed cost decreases because the same amount of fixed costs is being spread over a larger number of units of output.

[[Average variable cost]] plus average fixed cost equals [[average cost|average total cost]]:

:&lt;math&gt;ATC=AVC+AFC&lt;/math&gt;

== Explanation ==

=== Example 1 ===
Assume a firm produces clothing. When the quantity of the output varies from 5 shirts to 10 shirts, fixed cost would be 30 dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-37434-0_12|title=Microeconomics|last=Dorman|first=Peter|date=2014|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=9783642374333|series=Springer Texts in Business and Economics|pages=249–274|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-37434-0_12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, average fixed cost of producing 5 shirts would be 30 dollars divided by 5 shirts, which is 6 dollars.  In other words, when 5 shirts are produced, 30 dollars of fixed cost would spread and result in 6 dollars per shirt. Similarly, average fixed cost of producing 10 shirts would be 3 dollars derived from 30 dollars divided by 10 shirts.
[[File:Average_fixed_cost.png|thumb|A table and graph of average fixed cost]]

=== Example 2 ===
In Example1, there was no information about average total cost and average variable cost. If the firm knows average total cost and average variable cost, it is possible to find the same result as Example 1. Because average total cost is average variable cost plus average fixed cost, average fixed cost is average total cost minus average variable cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&amp;c=dsp&amp;k=average+fixed+cost|title=AmosWEB is Economics: Encyclonomic WEB*pedia|website=www.amosweb.com|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; If producing 5 shirts generates average total cost of 11 dollars and average variable cost of 5 dollars, fixed cost would be 6 dollars. Similarly, the firm produces 10 shirts and average total cost and average variable cost is 10 dollars and 7 dollars respectively. In this case, average fixed cost would be 3 dollars.

It forms part of the Menai Strait Fault System, with the [[Dinorwic Fault]] and the [[Aber Dinlle Fault]]. It has a long history of movement with early ductile fabrics preserved from a sinistral (left lateral) strike-slip sense [[shear zone]] active at the end of the [[Precambrian]] and into the early [[Cambrian]]. Any Caledonian deformation is unclear but the fault zone was reactivated in the [[Carboniferous]] as a NW-throwing normal fault with [[Reflection seismology|seismic reflection]] data showing the formation of a [[half-graben]] in its hanging wall. There are no indications of inversion during the [[Variscan Orogeny]], but the fault was reactivated in a normal sense during the [[Permian]] and [[Triassic]] and again during the [[Cenozoic]] with a sinistral strike-slip sense.&lt;ref name="Tim"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Needham|first=T.|author2=Morgan R.|year=1997|title=The East Irish Sea and adjacent basins: new faults or old?|journal=Journal of the Geological Society|volume=154|issue=1|pages=145–150|doi=10.1144/gsjgs.154.1.0145|url=http://jgs.lyellcollection.org/cgi/content/abstract/154/1/145|accessdate=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accelerating structures, both longitudinal and transverse, are identified by green blocks on the beam path, while blue blocks represent Power Extraction and Transport Structures (PETS).]]
The facility implemented and demonstrated the feasibility of a scaled version of the [[Compact Linear Collider|CLIC]] Drive Beam: a 1.2&amp;nbsp;μs-long electron beam (bunched at 1.5&amp;nbsp;GHz, and with 4 A mean current) was generated and accelerated up to ~135&amp;nbsp;MeV in a ~80 m-long [[Linear particle accelerator|LINAC]] by using fully loaded accelerating structures powered by ~40 MW, 3&amp;nbsp;GHz RF pulses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heinrich|first=Braun, Hans|last2=Peter|first2=Urschütz,|last3=Steffen|first3=Döbert,|last4=Roberto|first4=Corsini,|last5=A|first5=Tecker, Frank|last6=Erk|first6=Jensen,|date=2006-11-20|title=Efficient long-pulse fully-loaded CTF3 linac operation|url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/999488|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beam was then going through a simplified version of the Drive Beam Recombination Complex (DBRC): a system composed of a delay loop and a combiner ring allowed to recombine different part of the incoming beam to finally produce a 140&amp;nbsp;ns-long train of bunches at 12&amp;nbsp;GHz and with mean current as high as 28 A.

A second electron beam of lower intensity (a few bunches of about 100 pC/bunch), called Probe Beam, was generated and accelerated up to 200 MeV in the so-called "Concept d’Accélerateur Linéaire pour Faisceau d’Electrons Sonde" (CALIFES) injector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Navarro Quirante|first1=Jose Luis|last2=Corsini|first2=Roberto|last3=Grudiev|first3=Alexej|last4=Lefèvre|first4=Thibaut|last5=Mazzoni|first5=Stefano|last6=Pan|first6=Rui|last7=Tecker|first7=Frank|last8=Farabolini|first8=Wilfrid|last9=Peauger|first9=Franck|date=1 December 2014|title=CALIFES: A Multi-Purpose Electron Beam for Accelerator Technology Tests|url=http://inspirehep.net/record/1363325|pages=MOPP030|last10=Gamba|first10=Davide|last11=Khan|first11=Muhammad Asif|last12=Yaqub|first12=Kashif|last13=Ögren|first13=Jim|last14=Ruber|first14=Roger|last15=Vitoratou|first15=Niki}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main purpose of the Probe Beam was to emulate the main, colliding beam of CLIC.

== Experimental program ==
The two electron beams produced at CTF3 were used to demonstrate the two-beam acceleration concept in the Two-Beam-Module installed into the CLEX experimental area: the Drive Beam was decelerated in special Power Extraction and Transfer Structures (PETS), and the power produced used to accelerate the Probe Beam with gradients as high as ~145&amp;nbsp;MeV/m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruber|first=R.|last2=Ziemann|first2=V.|last3=Ekelöf|first3=T.|last4=Palaia|first4=A.|last5=Farabolini|first5=W.|last6=Corsini|first6=R.|title=The CTF3 Two-beam Test Stand|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2013.07.055|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment|language=en|volume=729|pages=546–553|doi=10.1016/j.nima.2013.07.055|bibcode=2013NIMPA.729..546R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution of the facility ==
[[File:CLEAR facility overview.jpg|thumb|View of the CERN Linear Electron Accelerator for Research (CLEAR) [[beamline]] seen from the end of the line [[beam dump]].]]
Thanks to its ease of operation and versatility, the Probe Beam was used also for activities not directly connected to [[Compact Linear Collider|CLIC]]. This triggered the interest of various communities, and a workshop was organised to discuss possible re-use of such a [[beamline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/533052/|title=CALIFES Workshop 2016  (10-12 October 2016) · Indico|website=Indico|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, while CTF3 was ending its operation, it was then decided to transform the Probe Beam in a new general purpose R&amp;D facility under the name of CLEAR.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

CLEAR keeps providing testing capabilities for [[X band|X-band]] accelerator technology, including [[Compact Linear Collider|CLIC]], but it also allows to explore novel concepts as [[plasma acceleration]], [[Terahertz radiation|THz radiation]] production. Furthermore, it provides electron irradiation capabilities to space and medical communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/681488/|title=The CERN Linear Electron Accelerator for Research – CLEAR  (30 November 2017) · Indico|website=Indico|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Central Saint Martins''', often abbreviated to '''CSM''', is a [[public university|public]] [[tertiary education|tertiary]] [[art school]] in London, England. It is a constituent college of the [[University of the Arts London]].{{r|bus|times}} It offers full-time courses at foundation, [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate]] levels, and a variety of short and summer courses.

It was formerly known as '''Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design''', and before that as '''Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design'''.{{r|aim2}}

==History==
Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design was formed in 1989 from the merger of the [[Central School of Art and Design]], founded in 1896, and [[Saint Martin's School of Art]], founded in 1854.{{r|aim2|alex}} Since 1986 both schools had been part of the [[London Institute]], formed by the [[Inner London Education Authority]] to bring together seven London art, design, fashion and media schools.{{r|hist}} The London Institute became a legal entity in 1988, could award taught degrees from 1993, was granted university status in 2003 and was renamed University of the Arts London in 2004.{{r|hist}} It also includes [[Camberwell College of Arts]], [[Chelsea College of Arts]], the [[London College of Communication]], the [[London College of Fashion]] and [[Wimbledon College of Arts]].

The [[Drama Centre London]], founded in 1963, joined Central Saint Martins in 1999 as an integral school, maintaining its name and teaching approaches. The [[Byam Shaw School of Art]], founded in 1910, was merged into Central Saint Martins in 2003.

{{main|Central School of Art and Design}}
The Central School of Art and Design was established as the Central School of Arts and Crafts in 1896 by [[London County Council]]. It grew directly from the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] of [[William Morris]] and [[John Ruskin]]. The first principal, from 1896 until 1911, was [[William Richard Lethaby]]; a [[blue plaque]] in his memory was erected in 1957.{{r|plaque}} The school was at first housed in Morley Hall, rented from the [[Regent Street Polytechnic]]. It moved to purpose-built premises in [[Southampton Row]], in the [[London Borough of Camden]], in 1908.{{r|oxford}} In the same year the [[Royal Female School of Art]], established in 1842, was merged into the school.{{r|aim25b}} Central became part of the London Institute in 1986, and merged with Saint Martin's in 1989.{{r|frieze}}

===Saint Martin's School of Art===
{{main|Saint Martin's School of Art}}
Saint Martin's School of Art was established in 1854 by [[Henry Mackenzie (bishop)|Henry Mackenzie]], [[vicar]] of the church of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]]. It became independent from the church in 1859.{{r|oxford2}} Frank Martin became head of the [[sculpture]] department in 1952; he brought in young sculptors and recent graduates of the department as teachers. Among these, [[Anthony Caro]] was particularly influential. The group around him came to be known as the New Generation of British sculptors and the sculpture department of Saint Martin's became, in the words of [[Tim Scott (artist)|Tim Scott]]: "the most famous in the art world".{{r|mclean}} Saint Martin's became part of the London Institute in 1986, and merged with Central in 1989.

===Drama Centre London===
{{Main|Drama Centre London}}
The [[Drama Centre London]] was founded in 1963 by a breakaway group of teachers and students from the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]], led by John Blatchley, [[Yat Malmgren]] and Christopher Fettes. The school is a member of [[Drama UK]]{{r|dramauk}} and its undergraduate [[Acting]] course is accredited by Drama UK.{{r|dramauk2}} The Drama Centre London merged with Central Saint Martins in 1999.

===Byam Shaw School of Art===
{{main|Byam Shaw School of Art}}

Byam Shaw School of Art was founded by the artists [[Byam Shaw|John Byam Shaw]] and [[Rex Vicat Cole]] in 1910 as a school of [[drawing]] and [[painting]]. It was originally located in Campden Street, [[Kensington]], and moved to larger premises in [[Archway, London|Archway]] in 1990. It was subsumed by Central Saint Martins in 2003.

==Awards and assessment==
In 1998 the London Institute received a [[Queen's Anniversary Prize]] for the "massive contribution" of Central Saint Martins College of Art &amp; Design to the growth of the fashion industry in Britain.{{r|royal}}  The University of the Arts London received a Queen's Anniversary Prize in 2013, for the contribution of CSM industrial and product design graduates to commerce, industry and the design profession.{{r|rat}}

CSM does not receive independent assessment in the ''[[Complete University Guide]]'' league tables, but is ranked as part of the University of the Arts London. In 2014 the university received an overall ranking of 67 out of 124 institutions, with a rank of 102 for graduate prospects and 123 for student satisfaction with teaching.{{r|indepedent|cug}} In 2018 it was placed 83rd out of 129 universities, with a rank of 125 for student satisfaction.{{r|cug2}} 

==Schools and location==
Teaching at Central Saint Martins is organised into nine programmes, which include acting, art, design, fashion, graphics and jewellery and textiles, as well as foundation courses.{{r|programmes}}

Central Saint Martins moved to a converted warehouse complex on [[Granary Square]] at [[King's Cross, London|King's Cross]] in 2011. Most of the college is housed there, but it also uses the former Byam Shaw building in Elthorne Road, [[Archway, London|Archway]], and premises in Richbell Place, [[Holborn]].{{r|locations}}

A '''couple interview''' (or '''joint couple interview''', or more broadly '''conjoint interview''', '''joint interview''' or '''dyadic interview''') is a method of [[qualitative research]] used in the [[social sciences]], where two [[spouse]]s are [[Interview (research)|interviewed]] together.&lt;ref name="B-F-2012" /&gt; Such an interview is typically [[Semi-structured interview|semi-structured]] or [[Unstructured interview|unstructured]]. Couple interviews are important in [[household]] research, often from a [[psychology|psychological]], [[sociology|sociological]], [[social anthropology|anthropological]] or [[Social geography|social geographical]] perspective, and are also frequently used within health research.&lt;ref name="P-G-2015" /&gt; A couple interview is a form of joint interviewing (interviews involving two interviewees), the subject of a growing methodological research literature.&lt;ref name="B-F-2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="P-G-2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Polak |first1=L |last2= Green |first2= J |year= 2015|title=Using Joint Interviews to Add Analytic Value |journal=[[Qualitative Health Research]] |volume=|issue= |pages=|publisher= |doi= 10.1177/1049732315580103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an ongoing methodological controversy over whether couples should ideally be interviewed together or apart.&lt;ref name="B-F-2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bjørnholt |first1=M |last2= Farstad |first2= G.R. |year= 2012|title='Am I rambling?'

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5406">'''Ethnoornithology''' (also ethno-ornithology) is the study of the relationship between [[person|people]] and [[birds]] (from "[[Ethnology|ethno-]]" - relating to people and culture - and "[[ornithology]]" - the study of birds). It is a branch of [[ethnozoology]] and so of the wider field of [[ethnobiology]]. Ethnoornithology is an interdisciplinary subject and combines [[anthropology|anthropological]], [[cognitive science|cognitive]] and [[linguistics|linguistic]] perspectives with [[natural science|natural scientific]] approaches to the description and interpretation of people's knowledge and use of birds. Like [[ethnomethodology|ethnoscience]] and other cognate terms, "ethnoornithology" is sometimes used narrowly to refer to people's practice rather than the study of that practice. The broader focus is on how birds are perceived, used and managed in [[human]] [[society|societies]], including their use for [[food]], [[medicine]] and personal [[beauty|adornment]], as well as their use in [[divination]] and [[ritual]]. Applied ethnoornithological research is also starting to play an increasingly important role in the development of [[conservation biology|conservation]] initiatives.

== History of ethnoornithology ==
The work of [[Ralph Bulmer]] in [[New Guinea]], culminating in his collaboration with Ian Saem Majnep in writing ''Birds of My Kalam Country'' (1977), set a new standard for ethnoornithological research, and this book has deservedly become a classic of modern ethnoornithology.

== Approaches to ethnoornithology ==

== Ethnoornithology and conservation ==
Like other branches of ethnozoology, ethnoornithology has been long undervalued as a resource for [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/endangered-languages/biodiversity-and-linguistic-diversity/ conservation], though this is now beginning to change. Mark Bonta's ''Seven Names for the Bellbird'' (2003), which highlights the importance of local traditions and practices relating to birds for the future of biodiversity conservation in Honduras, and Ricardo Rozzi´s ''Multi-ethnic Bird Guide of the Subantarctic Forests of South America'' (2003), which focuses on the integration of traditional ornithological knowledge and environmental ethics in southern Chile, provide good examples of this trend. Soma (2015) pointed out that ethnoornithological knowledge of falconers contribute to conservation for local avifauna (especially focusing on Kazakh eagle masters). This realisation is the basis for founding the [http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/egi/research-at-the-egi/ethno-ornithology-world-archive-ewa/ Ethno-ornithology World Archive (EWA)], a collaborative project between Oxford University (linking the Department of Zoology and School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography) and [[BirdLife International]].

== Professional associations ==
The [http://ethnobiology.org Society of Ethnobiology], which publishes the ''Journal of Ethnobiology'', provides a general forum for ethnobiological - including ethnoornthological - research. In January 2006 the [http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/ethnoornithology/ Ethnoornithology Research &amp; Study Group (ERSG)] was established "to provide a clearinghouse, information source and discussion point for people interested in the study of, research about and application of indigenous bird knowledge".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7609">'''Fiction Theory''' is a discipline that applies [[possible world]] theory to literature. Fiction theory scholars and critics have articulated various theses rooted in [[Saul Kripke]]’s application of [[modal logic]] to [[semantics]]. Drawing on concepts found in possible world theory, theorists of fiction study the relationships between textual worlds and the world outside the text.  The overarching idea in fiction theory is that the relationships between the imaginary worlds of fiction and the actual world in which we live are complicated, and that one ought not dismiss fiction as simply stories that are not “true.” Theorists of fiction pose challenging questions about, and offer constructive ways of exploring, the often complex relations between the worlds of fiction and the “real” world in which we live. 

== Fundamentals of fiction theory ==
In order to understand fiction theory, one must pose questions about fundamental terms such as text, narrative, literature, fiction, etc.  Literature may be understood as a text that is self-consciously artistic, rather than as a text that is used as a medium through which to convey information, for example a newspaper article. [[Roman Jakobson]], a Russian formalist and linguist, was one of the first individuals to discuss art as a way of communication that is intentionally aesthetic, and applied linguistics to analyses of literary texts. In his well-known communication model, Jakobson breaks apart a communicative act between an addressor and addressee into a message, code, context, and contact, with each part having its own function.  According to Jakobson’s model, art is created when the message itself (which carries the poetic function) is stressed. 

The French scholar [[Roland Barthes]] designed a system of [[five major codes]] that function as tools to analyze narrative texts in ways that move beyond examinations of plot and structure, thereby bringing to the surface the subtle ways a text becomes a literary narrative. 

Jakobson’s model and Barthes’s codes offer critics a way to begin to explore the nature of a literary text through application of [[semiotics]] to [[narrative]].

== The Actual versus the Fictive ==
While Jakobson and Barthes emphasize the intention of the speaker/writer, the philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]] examines the broader question of how we create imaginary worlds and categorizes our “Ways of Worldmaking” (the title of his book on this topic) into composition/decomposition, weighting, ordering, deletion/supplementation, and reformations. The scholar [[Marie-Laure Ryan]] is also concerned less with intention and more with the various ways that fictional worlds are related to the actual world outside the text. Ryan conceptualizes these relations in a framework of accessibility and has developed a typology of accessibility relations that establishes the extent to which fictional worlds are similar to or different from the actual world in which we live. The fictional world that most resembles the actual world is based on the “principle of minimal departure.” This idea was first articulated by [[John Searle]] and refers to the fundamental property of an imaginary world that is minimally different from the familiar world in which we live. Lubomir Dolezel has developed a similar typology based on [[modal operator]]s that determine the narrative world.

[[Frank Kermode]], in his seminal text ''[[The Sense of an Ending: Studies in the Theory of Fiction]]'', argues that ultimate meaning is derived from the end; successive events are predicated on previously established meaning.  He articulates a concept of fiction based on this view of humans’ constant yearning for an ultimate end that will imbue with meaning everything that preceded it. In this discussion, Kermode distinguishes between fiction and myth.  Fiction consists of stories all individuals create about their lives in order to keep on living in a world that makes few guarantees and is full of inexplicable phenomena. Kermode defines myth as a dangerous fiction used for exploitative purposes.  The philosopher [[Hans Vaihinger]] has articulated similar ideas, putting forth the biological argument that human beings use fictions to help survive in a hostile environment, and that these fictions are so useful that it becomes most difficult, if not impossible, for us to stop ourselves from creating fictions.  In Vaihinger’s language, fiction is something we treat “as if” it is true even when we know that it is not true, whereas myth is something we treat as true because we do not know it is false. 

Literary critic [[Thomas Pavel]] argues that the fictional world deserves to be examined on its own terms rather than merely through the lens of [[mimesis]].  His thesis serves as a critique of [[Structuralism]] by its insistence on the idea that narrativity, as a fundamental aspect of fiction, removes the possibility of pure imitation of the actual world.  Pavel’s theory thus departs from the main ideas of other fiction theorists because he separates literature from its referential relationship to the actual world. Following in the footsteps of the Austrian philosopher [[Alexius Meinong]], Pavel asserts that fictional worlds demand tremendous respect for their ability to serve as powerful tools of knowledge rather than for their likeness to the actual world.

'''Hadley''' is an [[impact crater]] in the [[Aeolis quadrangle]] of [[Mars]], located at 19.5°S  latitude and  203.1°W  longitude, and is inside [[Terra Cimmeria]].  It is 119.0&amp;nbsp;km in diameter and was named after [[George Hadley]], and the name was approved in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature {{!}} Hadley|url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/2309|website=usgs.gov|publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]]|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearby prominent craters include [[Graff (Martian crater)|Graff]] to the west-southwest and almost northeast is [[Boeddicker (Martian crater)|Boeddicker]].  Not far from Hadley in the southeast is [[al-Qahira Vallis]].

It owes no relation to a lunar feature known as [[Mons Hadley]] which is named after John Hadley.

Hadley is a triple crater formation whereas a smaller crater is in the middle and the southcentral portion and a small one in the southern part of the smaller one.  Other surrounding craters are inside Hadley including one in the western rim and a tiny one near the first smaller crater inside Hadley.   Southeast of Hadley's rim is a smaller unnamed crater that its depth is almost the same as the third smallest crater inside Hadley. Dunes are present on the floor of the crater and can be seen in the pictures on the left.

'''Henry Nathaniel Andrews, Jr.''' (born June 15, 1910, [[Melrose, Massachusetts]]; d. March 3, 2002 [[Concord, New Hampshire]]) was an American [[paleobotanist]] recognized as an expert in plants of the [[Devonian]] and [[Carboniferous]] periods.  He was a fellow of the [[Geological Society of America]] and the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] and was elected into the U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1975. He was a professor at the [[Washington University in St. Louis]] from 1940 to 1964 and a paleobotanist at the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]] 1947 to 1964. From 1964 until his retirement 1975, Andrews worked at the [[University of Connecticut]], where he served as head of the school's Botany department and later as head of the Systematics and Environmental Section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Phillips, T.

'''''Hubble – 15 Years of Discovery''''' ({{ISBN|0-387-28599-7}}) is a book that formed part of the [[European Space Agency|European Space Agency's]] 15th anniversary celebration activities for the 1990 launch of the NASA/ESA [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. Its main emphasis is on the exquisite Hubble images that have enabled astronomers to gain entirely new insights into the workings of a huge range of different astronomical objects. Hubble has provided the visual overview of the underlying astrophysical processes taking place in these objects, ranging from planets in the [[Solar System]] to galaxies in the young [[Universe]]. This book shows the close relationship between the results of great scientific value and of eye-catching beauty and artistic potential.

The book published by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] has 120 pages, measures 30 x 25&amp;nbsp;cm and is in full-colour. It has been translated into Finnish, Portuguese and German. Some versions include a copy of the '''''Hubble – 15 Years of Discovery''''' documentary (distributed in 860,000 copies). 

The book is authored by [[Lars Lindberg Christensen]] and [[Bob Fosbury]]. It is illustrated by [[Martin Kornmesser]].

'''Huberht Tor Hudson''' (17 September 1886 – 15 June 1942), commonly known as '''Hubert Hudson''' instead of by his actual first name (an Old English version of the name), was a navigating officer in the British [[Royal Navy]], who took part in [[Ernest Shackleton|Ernest Shackleton's]] [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] to Antarctica.

Hudson joined the expedition whilst a 'mate' within the Royal Navy. He earned himself the nickname of 'Buddha', when the rest of the crew successfully tricked him into dressing-up in little more than a bedsheet for a 'fancy dress' party on the whaling station at South Georgia that was in reality anything but.&lt;ref name="coolantarctica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/History/biography/hudson_hubert.php|publisher=coolantarctica.com|title=Huberht Taylor Hudson - Biographical notes|accessdate=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the expedition, Hudson was famed for his ability to catch penguins, which the crew ate as a source of food whilst trapped on the ice. It's also known that towards the end of the expedition, Hudson suffered a severe breakdown of mental morale, possibly due to a massive boil that he developed on his buttocks. His illness caused [[Frank Wild]], the second-in-command, a lot of worry that he would not survive. However, Hudson pulled through and eventually recovered his health.&lt;ref name="enduranceobituaries"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enduranceobituaries.co.uk/hudson.htm|publisher=enduranceobituaries.co.uk|title=Huberht Taylor Hudson &amp;#124; Endurance Obituaries|accessdate=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon return from the expedition, Hudson took part in [[World War I]], serving on [[Q-ship|'mystery ships']].&lt;ref name="enduranceobituaries"/&gt;

He later also took part in [[World War II]] as a Royal Navy Reserve Convoy Commodore. Hudson died on 15 June 1942 on convoy HG84 when his ship, the merchant vessel PELAYO, was torpedoed by U552.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16446">The '''ISO 15926''' is a standard for [[data integration]], sharing, exchange, and hand-over between [[computer system]]s.

The title, "''Industrial automation systems and integration&amp;mdash;Integration of life-cycle data for process plants including oil and gas production facilities''",  is regarded too narrow by the present ISO 15926 developers. Having developed a [[generic data model]] and Reference Data Library for process plants, it turned out that this subject is already so wide, that actually any state information may be modelled with it.

== History ==
In 1991 a European Union [[European Strategic Program on Research in Information Technology|ESPRIT]]-, named ProcessBase, started. The focus of this research project was to develop a [[data model]] for lifecycle information of a facility that would suit the requirements of the process industries. At the time that the project duration had elapsed, a consortium of companies involved in the process industries had been established: [[EPISTLE]] (European Process Industries STEP Technical Liaison Executive). Initially individual companies were members, but later this changed into a situation where three national consortia were the only members: PISTEP (UK), POSC/Caesar (Norway), and USPI-NL (Netherlands). (later PISTEP merged into POSC/Caesar, and USPI-NL was renamed to USPI).

EPISTLE took over the work of the ProcessBase project. Initially this work involved a standard called ISO 10303-221 (referred to as "[[ISO 10303|STEP]] AP221"). In that AP221 we saw, for the first time, an Annex M with a list of standard instances of the AP221 data model, including types of objects. These standard instances would be for reference and would act as a knowledge base with knowledge about the types of objects.
In the early nineties EPISTLE started an activity to extend Annex M to become a library of such object classes and their relationships: STEPlib. In the STEPlib activities a group of approx. 100 domain experts from all three member consortia, spread over the various expertises (e.g. Electrical, Piping, Rotating equipment, etc.), worked together to define the "core classes".

The development of STEPlib was extended with many additional classes and relationships between classes and published as [[Open Source]] data. Furthermore, the concepts and relation types from the AP221 and ISO 15926-2 data models were also added to the STEPlib dictionary. This resulted in the development of [[Gellish English]], whereas STEPlib became the [[Gellish English dictionary]]. Gellish English is a structured subset of natural English and is a [[modeling language]] suitable for [[knowledge modeling]], [[product modeling]] and [[data exchange]]. It differs from conventional modeling languages ([[meta language]]s) as used in information technology as it not only defines generic concepts, but also includes an English dictionary. The semantic expression capability of Gellish English was significantly increased by extending the number of relation types that can be used to express knowledge and information.

For modelling-technical reasons POSC/Caesar proposed another standard than [[ISO 10303]], called ISO 15926. EPISTLE (and ISO) supported that proposal, and continued the modelling work, thereby writing Part 2 of ISO 15926. This Part 2 has official ISO IS (International Standard) status since 2003.

POSC/Caesar started to put together their own RDL (Reference Data Library). They added many specialized classes, for example for [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] (American National Standards Institute) pipe and pipe fittings. Meanwhile, STEPlib continued its existence, mainly driven by some members of USPI. Since it was clear that it was not in the interest of the industry to have two libraries for, in essence, the same set of classes, the Management Board of EPISTLE decided that the core classes of the two libraries shall be merged into Part 4 of ISO 15926. This merging process has been finished. Part 4 should act as reference data for part 2 of ISO 15926 as well as for ISO 10303-221 and replaced its Annex M. On June 5, 2007 ISO 15926-4 was signed off as a TS (Technical Specification).

In 1999 the work on an earlier version of Part 7 started. Initially this was based on [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]] (the only useful W3C Recommendation available then), but when [[Web Ontology Language|Web Ontology Language (OWL)]] became available it was clear that provided a far more suitable environment for Part 7. Part 7 passed the first ISO ballot by the end of 2005, and an implementation project started. A formal ballot for TS (Technical Specification) was planned for December 2007. However, it was decided then to split Part 7 into more than one part, because the scope was too wide.

== The standard ==
{{External links|date=May 2012}}
ISO 15926 has eleven parts (as of June 2009):

* Part 1 [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=29556] - Introduction, information concerning engineering, construction and operation of production facilities is created, used and modified by many different organizations throughout a facility's lifetime. The purpose of ISO 15926 is to facilitate integration of data to support the lifecycle activities and processes of production facilities.
* Part 2 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111019195316/http://www.stanford.edu/group/narratives/classes/08-09/CEE215/ReferenceLibrary/FIATECH%20ISO%2015926/ISO/pack/ISO%2015926%20part2%20pack/ECM4.5/lifecycle_integration_schema.html]- Data Model. a generic 4D model that can support all disciplines, supply chain company types and life cycle stages, regarding information about functional requirements, physical solutions, types of objects and individual objects as well as activities.
* Part 3 - Reference data for geometry and topology.
* Parts 4 [http://data.posccaesar.org/rdl/] - Reference Data, the terms used within facilities for the process industry.
* Part 7 [http://www.15926.org] - Integration of life-cycle data for process plants including oil and gas production facilities - Part 7: Implementation methods for the integration of distributed systems: Template methodology.
* Part 8 [http://www.15926.org] - Integration of life-cycle data for process plants including oil and gas production facilities - Part 8: Implementation methods for the integration of distributed systems: [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL/RDF) implementation.
* Part 9 (in development)- Implementation standards, with the focus on Façades, standard web servers, web services, and security.
* Part 10 (in development)- Test Methods.
* Part 11 (in development)- Industrial Usage Guidelines.
* Part 12 (in development)- Life cycle integration ontology in [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL2).
* Part 13 (in development)- Integrated lifecycle asset planning.

=== Description ===
The model and the library are suitable for representing lifecycle information about technical installations and their components.

They can also be used for defining the terms used in product catalogs in [[e-commerce]]. Another, more limited, use of the standard is as a reference classification for harmonization purposes between shared databases and product catalogues that are not based on ISO 15926.

The purpose of ISO 15926 is to provide a [[Lingua franca|Lingua Franca]] for computer systems, thereby integrating the information produced by them. Although set up for the process industries with large projects involving many parties, and involving plant operations and maintenance lasting decades, the technology can be used by anyone willing to set up a proper vocabulary of reference data in line with Part 4.

In Part 7 the concept of Templates is introduced. These are semantic constructs, using Part 2 entities, that represent a small piece of information. These constructs then are mapped to more efficient classes of n-ary relations that interlink the Nodes that are involved in the represented information.

In Part 8 the data model of Part 2 is mapped to OWL, and so are, in concept, the Reference Data of Part 4 and the templates of Part 7. For validation and reasoning purposes all are represented in First-Order Logic as well.

In Part 9 these Node and Template instances are stored in Façades. A Façade is an RDF [[quad store]], set up to a standard schema and an API. Any Façade only stores the data for which the Façade owner is responsible.

Each participating computer system maps its data from its internal format to such ISO-standard Node and Template instances. These are stored in a System Façade, each system its own Façade.

Data can be "handed over" from one Façade to another in cases where data custodianship is handed over (e.g. from a contractor to a plant owner, or from a manufacturer to the owners of the manufactured goods). Hand-over can be for a part of all data, whilst maintaining full referential integrity.

Façades can be set up for the consolidation of data by handing over data produced by various participating computer systems and stored in their System Façades. Examples are: a Façade for a project discipline, a project, a plant).

Documents are user-definable. They are defined in [[XML Schema]] and they are, in essence, only a structure containing cells that make reference to instances of Templates. This represents a view on all lifecycle data: since the data model is a 4D (space-time) model, it is possible to present the data that was valid at any given point in time, thus providing a true historical record. It is expected that this will be used for Knowledge Mining.

Data can be queried by means of [[SPARQL]]. In any implementation a restricted number of Façades can be involved, with different access rights. This is done by means of creating a CPF Server (= Confederation of Participating Façades). An [[Ontology (computer science)|Ontology]] Browser allows for access to one or more Façades in a given CPF, depending on the access rights.

== Projects and applications ==
{{External links|date=May 2012}}
There are a number of projects working on the extension of the ISO 15926 standard in different application areas.

=== Capital-intensive projects ===

Within the application of Capital Intensive projects, some cooperating implementation projects are running:

* The DEXPI project: The objective of DEXPI is to develop and promote a general standard for the process industry covering all phases of the lifecycle of a (petro-)chemical plant, ranging from specification of functional requirements to assets in operation. See more at [http://www.dexpi.org dexpi.org]

Finalised projects include:

* The EDRC Project of [http://www.fiatech.org FIATECH] [http://www.fiatech.org/images/stories/projects/Project_Resumes/EDRC_Resume_v8_Sept_13_2013.pdf Capturing Equipment Data Requirements Using ISO 15926 and Assessing Conformance]. [http://techinvestlab.ru/EDRCDemo Example data and videos.]
* The ADI Project of [http://www.fiatech.org FIATECH], to build the tools (which will then be made available in the public domain)
** The tools and deliverables can be seen on the ISO 15926 knowledge base: [http://15926.org]
* The IDS Project of [http://www.posccaesar.org POSC Caesar Association], to define product models required for data sheets
* A joint ADI-IDS project is the [[ISO 15926 WIP]]

=== Upstream Oil and Gas industry ===

The [[Norwegian Oil Industry Association]] (OLF) has decided to use ISO 15926 (also known as the [[Oil and Gas Ontology]]) as the instrument for integrating data across disciplines and business domains for the [[Upstream (oil industry)|Upstream Oil and Gas industry]]. It is seen as one of the enablers of what has been called the next (or second) generation of [[Integrated operations]], where a better integration across companies is the goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olf.no/getfile.php/zKonvertert/www.olf.no/Rapporter/Dokumenter/070919%20IO%20and%20Ontology%20-%20Brosjyre.pdf |title=Integrated Operations and the Oil and Gas Ontology |author=The Norwegian Oil Industry Association (OLF) |accessdate=2009-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following projects are currently running (May 2009):

* The [[Integrated Operations in the High North|Integrated Operations in the High North (IOHN)]] project is working on extending ISO 15926 to handle real-time data transmission and (pre-)processing to enable the next generation of [[Integrated operations|Integrated Operations]].
* The [http://trac.posccaesar.org/wiki/EW Environment Web] project to include environmental reporting terms and definitions  as used in [http://www.epim.no EPIM]'s [http://www.epim.no/default.asp?id=945 EnvironmentWeb] in ISO 15926.

Finalised projects include:

* The [http://trac.posccaesar.org/wiki/IIP Integrated Information Platform (IIP)] project working on establishing a real-time information pipeline based on open standards. It worked among others on:
** [http://www.posccaesar.org/wiki/NcsDdr Daily Drilling Report (DDR)] to including all terms and definitions in ISO 15926. This standard became mandatory on February 1, 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npd.no/English/Produkter+og+tjenester/Skjemaer/CDRS_reporting_oct_2007.htm |title=Drilling Reporting to the authorities |author=Norwegian Petroleum Directorate |accessdate=2009-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for reporting on the [[Norwegian Continental Shelf]] by the [[Norwegian Petroleum Directorate|Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD)]] and [http://www.ptil.no/main-page/category9.html Safety Authority Norway (PSA)]. NPD says that the quality of the reports has improved considerably since.
** [http://www.posccaesar.org/wiki/NcsDpr Daily Production Report (DPR)] to including all terms and definitions in ISO 15926. This standard was tested successfully on the [[Valhall oil field|Valhall]] ([[BP]]-operated) and [http://www.statoilhydro.com/en/ouroperations/explorationprod/ncs/aasgard/pages/default.aspx Åsgard] ([[StatoilHydro]]-operated) fields offshore Norway. The terminology and XML schemata developed have also been included in [http://www.Energistics.org Energistics]’ [[PRODML]] standard.

== Some technical background ==
One of the main requirements was (and still is) that the scope of the data model covers the entire lifecycle of a facility (e.g. oil refinery) and its components (e.g. pipes, pumps and their parts, etc.). Since such a facility over such a long time entails many different types of activities on a myriad of different objects it became clear that a generic and data-driven data model would be required.

A simple example will illustrate this. There are thousands of different types of physical objects in a facility (pumps, compressors, pipes, instruments, fluids, etc). Each of these has many properties. If all combinations would be modelled in a "hard-coded" fashion, the number of combinations would be staggering, and unmanageable.

The solution is a "template" that represents the semantics of: "This object has a property of  X yyyy" (where yyyy is the unit of measure). Any instance of that template refers to the applicable reference data:
* physical object (e.g. my Induction Motor)
* indirect property type (e.g. the class "cold locked rotor time")
* base property type (here: time)
* scale (here: seconds)

Without being able to make reference to those classes, via the Internet, it will be impossible to express this information.

'''"Inca Roads"''' is the opening track of the [[Frank Zappa]] and [[The Mothers of Invention]] 1975 album, ''[[One Size Fits All (Frank Zappa album)|One Size Fits All]]''. The song features unusual [[time signatures]], lyrics and vocals. The [[marimba]]-playing of Zappa's [[percussionist]] [[Ruth Underwood]] is featured prominently. The song was played in concert from 1973 to 1976, 1979 and 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/inca-roads-mt0010977420|title=Inca Roads - The Mothers of Invention,Frank Zappa {{!}} Song Info {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

"Inca Roads" for the most part explores the stereotypes of aliens encountering the [[Incan civilization]]. These themes, like the album cover of ''One Size Fits All'' seem to parody the spirituality of many [[progressive rock]] albums around the same era. The lyrics "Did a vehicle come from somewhere out there, just to land in the Andes? Was it round and did it have a motor or was it something different?" imply that a UFO is landing in the [[Andes mountains]]. As the song progresses, the lyrics become sillier and seem to mock the beginning of the song. An example of this is "...or did someone build a place or leave a space for Chester's thing to land (Chester's thing... on Ruth). Did a booger-bear come from somewhere out there..." The non-serious nature of these lyrics and even the music itself seem to be mocking other progressive rock bands and their possibly forced divine depth.&lt;ref name="metrolyrics"&gt;http://www.metrolyrics.com/inca-roads-lyrics-frank-zappa.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lowe2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kelly Fisher Lowe|title=The Words and Music of Frank Zappa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uAYfqgGf4yYC&amp;pg=PA119|year=2007|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-6005-9|pages=119–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lowe2007 120"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kelly Fisher Lowe|title=The Words and Music of Frank Zappa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uAYfqgGf4yYC&amp;pg=PA120|year=2007|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-6005-9|pages=120–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Song Structure==

"Inca Roads" uses [[mixed meter]]. The [[time signature]]s include {{music|time|2|4}}, {{music|time|3|4}}, {{music|time|4|4}}, {{music|time|5|4}}, {{music|time|6|4}}, {{music|time|3|8}}, {{music|time|7|8}}, {{music|time|3|16}}, {{music|time|5|16}}, {{music|time|7|16}}, {{music|time|11|16}}, and possibly others.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The song starts with dominant vocals, drums, and marimba, but soon features a massive, iconic guitar solo performed by Zappa in late September 1974 at a live performance in Helsinki, Finland. An edited version of this solo recording (and part of the bass and drums accompaniment) was "grafted" onto the KCET track{{clarify|date=February 2018}} and forms the backbone of the OSFA version{{clarify|date=February 2018}}. Later, George Duke plays an equally complex solo in {{music|time|7|16}}. On the video, Zappa is seen smiling gleefully, as he plays the backup chords. After a short marimba solo, "Inca Roads" reprises its snappy intro. The song ends with the lyrics "On Ruth, on Ruth, that's Ruth!" acknowledging Underwood for her leading on the marimba.&lt;ref name="metrolyrics" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zappateers.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=11387&amp;sid=4bb4ca88239160d6f15e91eb8472a6f9&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview vocalist and keyboard player [[George Duke]] said that Zappa pushed for him to sing on "Inca Roads" and that beforehand Duke had no intentions of singing professionally and was only there to play keyboards. He went on to explain how Zappa had bought him a synthesizer (an instrument which Duke had disliked) and told him he could play around with it if he wanted. This led to Duke playing the synth part on "Inca Roads" as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twoputttommy.com/2012/12/05/zappadan-2012-day-2-george-duke-and-inca-roads/|title=Zappadan 2012, Day 2: George Duke and Inca Roads|access-date=2016-03-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308042009/http://www.twoputttommy.com/2012/12/05/zappadan-2012-day-2-george-duke-and-inca-roads/|archivedate=2016-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Skip==

Many early LP copies contain a skip during "Inca Roads" at approximately 4:40 into the track (the end of the solo from Helsinki). This error was a manufacturing defect not caught during the test pressing stage. The album was recalled after the mistake was caught, but a significant number had already been sold. The highly complex nature of the music made it difficult to recognize the error without comparing it to the correct version.

An '''isenthalpic process''' or '''isoenthalpic process''' is a process that proceeds without any change in [[enthalpy]], ''H''; or [[Enthalpy#Specific enthalpy|specific enthalpy]], ''h''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Atkins | first = Peter

==Overview==
In a steady-state, steady-flow process, significant changes in pressure and temperature can occur to the fluid, and yet the process will be isenthalpic if there is no transfer of heat to or from the surroundings, no work done on or by the surroundings, and no change in the kinetic energy of the fluid.&lt;ref name="FCT"&gt;G. J. Van Wylen and R. E. Sonntag, ''Fundamentals of Classical Thermodynamics'', Section 5.13 (3rd edition).&lt;/ref&gt;  (If a steady-state, steady-flow process is analysed using a [[control volume]], everything outside the control volume is considered to be the ''surroundings''.&lt;ref&gt;G. J. Van Wylen and R. E. Sonntag, ''Fundamentals of Classical Thermodynamics'', Section 2.1 (3rd edition).&lt;/ref&gt;)

The [[Joule–Thomson effect|throttling process]] is a good example of an isenthalpic process.  Consider the lifting of a relief valve or safety valve on a pressure vessel.  The specific enthalpy of the fluid inside the pressure vessel is the same as the specific enthalpy of the fluid as it escapes from the valve.&lt;ref name="FCT"/&gt;  With a knowledge of the [[Enthalpy#Specific enthalpy|specific enthalpy]] of the fluid and the pressure outside the pressure vessel, it is possible to determine the temperature and speed of the escaping fluid.

In an isenthalpic process:
* &lt;math&gt;h_1 = h_2&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;dh = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Isenthalpic processes on an [[ideal gas]] follow [[isothermal process|isotherms]], since &lt;math&gt;dh = 0 = c_p \,dT&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Boeing X-45-NMUSAF.jpg|thumb|right|Boeing X-45 at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]]]]
'''Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems''', or '''J-UCAS''', was the name for the joint [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[unmanned combat air vehicle]] procurement project. The two vehicles involved in the project were the [[Boeing X-45]] and [[Northrop Grumman X-47A Pegasus|Northrop Grumman X-47]]. J-UCAS was managed by the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]]. In the 2006 [[Quadrennial Defense Review]], it was stated that the J-UCAS program would be terminated and instead a new long-range [[strategic bomber]] program, "''[[Next-Generation Bomber]]''", for the Air Force has been launched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2006/060113-j-ucas-terminated.htm "Pentagon Sets Plan For New Bomber, Terminates J-UCAS Program"], GlobalSecurity.org, 13 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The program was revitalized into a Navy-only program named [[UCAS-D]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/cv-ucavs-the-return-of-ucas-03557/ "Carrier UCAVs: The Return of UCAS"], Defense Industry Daily, 7 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}

It is unusual for DARPA to be involved with advanced development programs; the agency normally performs [[proof-of-concept]] demonstrations and then hands follow-on programs on to interested military services. Apparently this arrangement was driven from the office of the secretary of defense, the idea being that DARPA would be able to keep the development effort on track until advanced demonstrators were available, and then the program would have so much momentum that it would keep on going. The long list of US military UAV programs that have been bungled and dropped after much expense and effort, with some of them like the Hunter ending up effectively reaching operational service in spite of it, provoked the decision.

Of course, the candidates for the J-UCAS program included developments of the follow-ons to the [[Boeing X-45A]] and the [[Northrop Grumman]] [[X-47 Pegasus]]. DARPA and Boeing had been working on the "X-45B", a scaled-up X-45A that was seen as the prototype for an operational machine that would reach service in 2008, and would carry a 1,590 kilogram (3,500 pound) warload to a combat radius of 1,665 kilometers (900 nautical miles). Two were to be built, but before any metal could be bent for the two X-45B prototypes planned, the Air Force redirected the effort to an even more capable machine, the "X-45C".

The X-45C, as currently envisioned, will be a flying wing powered by a single F404-GE-102D turbofan engine. Current specs include:

The payload and range specifications are as defined by J-UCAS requirements. The operational radius specification is for a strike to a predefined target and back home again. A secondary range specification dictates a two-hour loiter capability at a radius of 1,850 kilometers (1,000 NMI).

Partly because of the pressure from Boeing, in the summer of 2003, Northrop Grumman formed an alliance with Lockheed Martin to help develop the "X-47B", a follow-on to the X-47 that would compete against Boeing efforts. The alliance, which repeats the successful teamup that won the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter effort, is focused on building a modular stealthy UCAV that could be adapted to a wide range of missions. It would have a speed of Mach 0.8 at 10,670 meters (35,000 feet) and endurance of up to 12 hours.

The goal of the J-UCAS effort is to select a single contractor to provide from 10 to 12 machines for operational evaluation in the 2007-2008 time frame. Current plans are to obtain two X-45Cs and two X-47Bs to perform a comparative evaluation and then select a winner for development in the 2010 time frame.

Specifications for the J-UCAS are still evolving. Right now, both services envision a stealthy machine with a pricetag of $10 to $15 million USD, which is actually modest for a sophisticated stealthy combat aircraft. The USAF envisions that J-UCAS will feature:

* Stores pylons on the wings for external fuel tanks or additional munitions.
* Mid-air refueling capability.
* A narrow field-of-view SAR-MTI system for targeting and post-strike damage assessment.

The USAF has envisioned an operational UCAV as being stored in broken-down form inside a container that can be airlifted, with the UCAV having a specified "shelf life" of 20 years. It would be removed from the container every few years for inspections and could be checked with an electronic test system. The Air Force would also like to use an operational UCAV as the basis of a "penetrating jammer" platform that would penetrate enemy airspace to blind hostile radars. It would replace the [[Grumman EA-6B Prowler]] manned electronic warfare aircraft in this role. A reconnaissance payload is also being considered. However, the Air Force wants to focus on the strike role first.

Over the long term, the Air Force is interested in using a UCAV as a platform to carry directed-energy weapons, initially a "high power microwave (HPM)" weapon to fry adversary electronic systems. The HPM weapon would be "fired" out an aperture on the front of the aircraft, with electronic steering used to direct the beam over an arc covering about 45 degrees to either side of the UCAV. The HPM weapon could be followed by a high power laser weapon.

The Navy is interested in many of the features on the Air Force wish list, though the Navy has put reconnaissance and jamming at the top of the list and strike at the bottom, and seems to be indifferent to the [[containerization]] concept. Of course, a navalized UCAV would have a stronger airframe and landing gear for carrier takeoffs and landings; an arresting hook; and avionics for automated carrier approach and landing, along with a "relative navigation system" that will tell the UCAV where it is relative to the carrier.

A big concern of program officials is to ensure that widespread use of UCAVs does not increase the number of [[friendly fire]] incidents or collateral damage to civilian targets. The evaluation program will investigate this matter in detail. One of the concepts now being given considerable thought is use of a manned aircraft, such as an F-15E Strike Eagle, as a UCAV "mothership", with the weapons systems officer in the back seat directing one or more UCAVs over high-speed [[datalink]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15268">The '''Knowledge Based Software Assistant (KBSA)''' was a research program funded by the [[United States Air Force]]. The goal of the program was to apply concepts from [[artificial intelligence]] to the problem of designing and implementing [[computer software]]. Software would be described by models in very high level languages (essentially equivalent to [[First Order Logic|first order logic]]) and then [[rule of inference|transformation rules]] would transform the specification into efficient code. The air force hoped to be able to generate the software to control [[Weapon systems|weapons systems]] and other [[command and control]] systems using this method. As software was becoming ever more critical to USAF weapons systems it was realized that improving the quality and productivity of the software development process could have significant benefits for the military, as well as for [[Information Technology|information technology]] in other major US industries.

==History==
In the early 1980s the United States Air Force realized that they had received significant benefits from applying artificial intelligence technologies to solving expert problems such as the diagnosis of faults in aircraft. The air force commissioned a group of researchers from the [[artificial intelligence]] and [[formal methods]] communities to develop a report on how such technologies might be used to aid in the more general problem of software development.

The report described a vision for a new approach to software development. Rather than define specifications with diagrams and manually transform them to code as was the current process, the KBSA vision was to define specifications in very high level languages and then to use transformation rules to gradually refine the specification into efficient code on heterogeneous platforms.

Each step in the design and refinement of the system would be recorded as part of an integrated repository. In addition to the artifacts of software development the processes, the various definitions and transformations, would also be recorded in a way that they could be analyzed and also replayed later as needed. The idea was that each step would be a transformation that took into account various non-functional requirements for the implemented system. For example, requirements to use specific programming languages such as Ada or to harden code for real time mission critical fault tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Green|first=Cordell |author2=D.

The air force decided to fund further research on this vision through their [[Rome Air Development Center]] laboratory at [[Griffiss Air Force Base|Griffiss air force base]] in New York. The majority of the early research was conducted at the Kestrel Institute in Northern California (with [[Stanford University]]) and the [[Information Sciences Institute]] (ISI) in Southern California (with [[University of Southern California|USC]] and [[UCLA]]). The Kestrel Institute focused primarily on the provably correct transformation of logical models to efficient code. ISI focused primarily on the front end of the process on defining specifications that could map to logical formalisms but were in formats that were intuitive and familiar to systems analysts. In addition, Raytheon did a project to investigate informal requirements gathering and Honeywell and Harvard University did work on underlying frameworks, integration, and activity coordination.

Although not primarily funded by the KBSA program the [[MIT]] Programmer's Apprentice project also had many of the same goals and used the same techniques as KBSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rich|first=Charles|author2=Richard C. Waters |title=The Programmer's Apprentice Project: A Research Overview|journal=IEE Expert Special Issue on the Interactions between Expert Systems and Software Engineering|date=November 1987|url=ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/pdf/AIM-1004.pdf|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later stages of the KBSA program (starting in 1991) researchers developed prototypes that were used on medium to large scale software development problems. Also, in these later stages the emphasis shifted from  a pure KBSA approach to more general questions of how to use knowledge-based technology to supplement and augment existing and future [[Computer Aided Software Engineering|computer-aided software engineering]] (CASE) tools. In these later stages there was significant interaction between the KBSA community and the object-oriented and software engineering communities. For example, KBSA concepts and researchers played an important role in the mega-programming and user centered software engineering programs sponsored by the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeBellis|first=Michael|author2=Christine Haapala |title=User-Centric Software Engineering|journal=IEEE Expert|date= February 1995|volume=10|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these later stages the program changed its name to Knowledge-Based Software Engineering (KBSE). The name change reflected the different research goal, no longer to create a totally new all encompassing tool that would cover the complete software life cycle but to gradually work knowledge-based technology into existing tools. Companies such as [[Andersen Consulting]] (one of the largest system integrators and at the time vendor of their own CASE tool) played a major role in the program in these later stages.

==Key concepts==

=== Transformation rules ===
The transformation rules that KBSA used were different than traditional rules for expert systems. Transformation rules matched against specification and implementation languages rather than against facts in the world. It was possible to specify transformations using patterns, wildcards, and recursion on both the right and left hand sides of a rule. The left hand expression would specify patterns in the existing knowledge base to search for. The right hand expression could specify a new pattern to transform the left hand side into. For example, transform a set theoretic data type into code using an Ada set library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Doug|title=Automating Software Design|year=1991|publisher=AAAI/MIT Press|isbn=978-0262620802|pages=483–514|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.54.6955&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=ps|editor=Michael Lowry, Robert McCartney|chapter=KIDS - A Knowledge-Based Software Development System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial purpose for transformation rules was to refine a high level logical specification into well designed code for a specific hardware and software platform. This was inspired by early work on theorem proving and automatic programming. However, researchers at the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) developed the concept of ''evolution transformations''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Lewis|author2=M.S. Feather |title=Using Evolution Transformations to Construct Specifications|journal=Automating Software Design|year=1991|pages=65–92|publisher=AAAI Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Rather than transforming a specification into  code an evolution transformation was meant to automate various stereotypical changes at the specification level, for example developing a new superclass by extracting various capabilities from an existing class that can be shared more generally. Evolution transformations were developed at approximately the same time as the emergence of the software patterns community and the two groups shared concepts and technology. Evolution transformations were essentially what is known as [[refactoring]] in the object-oriented software patterns community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=Martin|title=Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code|year=1999|publisher=Addison Wesley|isbn=0201485672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Knowledge-based repository ===
A key concept of KBSA was that all artifacts: requirements, specifications, transformations, designs, code, process models, etc. were represented as objects in a [[Knowledge base|knowledge-based]] [[Repository (version control)|repository]]. The original KBSA report describes what was called a Wide Spectrum Language. The requirement was for a [[knowledge representation]] framework that could support the entire life cycle: requirements, specification, and code as well as the software process itself. The core representation for the knowledge base was meant to utilize the same framework although various layers could be added to support specific presentations and implementations.

These early knowledge-base frameworks were developed primarily by ISI and Kestrel building on top of Lisp and Lisp machine environments. The Kestrel environment was eventually turned into a commercial product called Refine which was developed and supported by a spin-off company from Kestrel called Reasoning Systems Incorporated.

The Refine language and environment also proved to be applicable to the problem of software reverse engineering: taking legacy code that is critical to the business but that lacks proper documentation and using tools to analyze it and transform it to a more maintainable form. With the growing concern of the [[Y2K problem]] reverse engineering was a major business concern for many large US corporations and it was a focus area for KBSA research in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boehm|first=Barry|author2=Prasanta Bose |title=KBSA Life Cycle Evaluation: Final Technical Report|journal=Contract No: F30602-96-C-0274|date=1998-08-15|volume=I|url=http://csse.usc.edu/csse/event/1999/ARR/volumeI.pdf|accessdate=4 January 2014|publisher=USC Center for Software Engineering|quote=As the program has proceeded toward its ultimate objectives, it has spawned a number of productivity-enhancing spinoffs such as the Refine-based software reengineering and testing tools}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Welty|first=Chris|title=Summary of KBSE-93: The Eighth Annual Knowledge-Based Software Engineering Conference|url=http://ase-conferences.org/ase/past/kbse-8.txt|work=ase-conferences.org|accessdate=4 January 2014|quote=REFINE/COBOL Object Modeling Workbench provides a set of reengineering tools, Refine is the language of the KBSA concept demo.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was significant interaction between the KBSA communities and the [[Frame language]] and [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] communities. The early KBSA knowledge-bases were implemented in [[object-based]] languages rather than [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]]. Objects were represented as classes and sub-classes but it was not possible to define methods on the objects. In later versions of KBSA such as the Andersen Consulting Concept Demo the specification language was expanded to support message passing as well.

=== Intelligent Assistant ===
KBSA took a different approach than traditional expert systems when it came to how to solve problems and work with users. In the traditional expert system approach the user answers a series of interactive questions and the system provides a solution. The KBSA approach left the user in control. Where as an expert system tried to, to some extent replace and remove the need for the expert the intelligent assistant approach in KBSA sought to re-invent the process with technology. This led to a number of innovations at the user interface level.

An example of the collaboration between the object-oriented community and KBSA was the architecture used for KBSA user interfaces. KBSA systems utilized a model-view-controller (MVC) user interface. This was an idea incorporated from Smalltalk environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=Dave|author2=A. Czuchry |title=The Knowledge-Based Requirements Assistant|journal=IEEE Expert|year=1988|volume=3|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The MVC architecture was especially well suited to the KBSA user interface.  KBSA environments featured multiple heterogeneous views of the knowledge-base. It might be useful to look at an emerging model from the standpoint of entities and relations, object interactions, class hierarchies, dataflow, and many other possible views. The MVC architecture facilitated this. With the MVC architecture the underlying model was always the knowledge base which was a [[Metaobject|meta-model]] description of the specification and implementation languages. When an analyst made some change via a particular diagram (e.g. added a class to the class hierarchy) that change was made at the underlying model level and the various views of the model were all automatically updated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Lewis|author2=David R. Harris |author3=Kevin M. Benner |author4=Martin S. Feather |title=Aries: The Requirements/Specification Facet for KBSA|journal=Rome Laboratory Final Technical Report|date=October 1992|volume=RL-TR-92-248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the benefits of using a transformation was that many aspects of the specification and implementation could be modified at once. For small scale prototypes the resulting diagrams were simple enough that basic layout algorithms combined with reliance on users to clean up diagrams was sufficient. However, when a transformation can radically redraw models with tens or even hundreds of nodes and links the constant updating of the various views becomes a task in itself. Researchers at Andersen Consulting incorporated work from the University of Illinois on graph theory to automatically update the various views associated with the knowledge base and to generate graphs that have minimal intersection of links and also take into account domain and user specific layout constraints.

Another concept used to provide intelligent assistance was automatic text generation. Early research at ISI investigated the feasibility of extracting formal specifications from informal natural language text documents. They determined that the approach was not viable. Natural language is by nature simply too ambiguous to serve as a good format for defining a system.  However, natural language generation was seen to be feasible as a way to generate textual descriptions that could be read by managers and non-technical personnel. This was especially appealing to the air force since by law they required all contractors to generate various reports that describe the system from different points of view. Researchers at ISI and later Cogentext and Andersen Consulting demonstrated the viability of the approach by using their own technology to generate the documentation required by their air force contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeBellis|first=Michael|author2=Kanth Miriyala |author3=Sudin Bhat |author4=William C. Sasso |author5=Owen Rambo |title=KBSA Concept Demo: Final Technical Report|journal=USAF Rome Laboratory Technical Report|date=April 1993|volume=RL-TR-93-38|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA267054|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of [[Columbiformes]] species by global population'''. While numbers are estimates, they have been made by the experts in their fields. For more information on how these estimates were ascertained, see Wikipedia's articles on [[population biology]] and [[population ecology]].

This list is not comprehensive, as not all Columbiformes have had their numbers quantified.

==Modelling languages==
*CCSP: A process calculus obtained from [[Calculus of communicating systems|CCS]] by incorporating some operators of [[Communicating sequential processes|CSP]]. It is defined by Olderog&lt;ref name="CCSP1"&gt;[[Ernst-Rüdiger Olderog|E.R. Olderog]]: [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=735293 ''Operational Petri net semantics for CCSP'']&lt;/ref&gt; and by van Glabbeek/Vaandrager.&lt;ref name="CCSP2"&gt;Rob van Glabbeek, Frits Vaandrager: [http://www.springerlink.com/content/6y9cjby2j22t97q0/ ''Bundle Event Structures and CCSP'']&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Communicating sequential processes|CSP]]: Communicating sequential processes; formal language for describing patterns of interaction in concurrent systems. [[FDR2]] is a refinement checking tool for CSP, comparing two models for compatibility.
*DVE input language: a system is described as Network of Extended Finite State Machines communicating via shared variables and unbuffered channels. Does not contain support for buffered channels and for checking the type of message to be received without performing the receive proper.
*FC2: (Common Format V2) Machine-level ASCII representation for synchronized (hierarchical) networks of automata. Defined by the Esprit Basic Research Action CONCUR, 1992. Used as an input and exchange format by a number of verification tools, mainly in the area of process algebras.
*FSP: Finite State Processes language defined at Imperial College.
*[[Java (programming language)|Java]]: Object-oriented programming language.
*LNT: LOTOS New Technology; a specification language inspired by process calculi, functional programming languages, and imperative programming languages; LNT was designed as a modern replacement for [[Language Of Temporal Ordering Specification|LOTOS]] and [[E-LOTOS]].
*[[Language Of Temporal Ordering Specification|LOTOS]]: Language Of Temporal Ordering Specification (ISO standard 8807); formal specification language based on temporal ordering used for protocol specification in ISO OSI standards.
*[[PEPA]]: Performance Evaluation Process Algebra; it is a stochastic process algebra designed for modelling computer and communication systems.
*Plain MC: simple text-file formats used in MRMC and PRISM.
*[[Promela]]: Process or Protocol Meta Language; it is a verification modeling language. The language allows for the dynamic creation of concurrent processes to model, for example, distributed systems.
*[[TLA+]]: General-purpose specification language based on the Temporal Logic of Actions, originally used for distributed and concurrent systems. The language for the specifications and their properties is the same.

==Properties language==
* AFMC: Alternation-Free [[modal μ-calculus]].
*[[Assertion (computing)|Assertions]]: Imperative assertion statements.
*CSL: Continuous Stochastic Logic, characterizes bisimulation of continuous-time Markov processes.
*CSRL: Continuous Stochastic Reward Logic; a logic to specify measures over CTMCs extended with a reward structure (so-called Markov reward models).
*[[Computation tree logic|CTL]]: Computation Tree Logic; a branching-time logic, meaning that its model of time is a tree-like structure in which the future is not determined; there are different paths in the future, any one of which might be an actual path that is realized.
*[[Linear temporal logic|LTL]]: Linear temporal logic; a modal temporal logic with modalities referring to time.
* MCL: Model Checking Language; Alternation-Free [[Modal μ-calculus]] extended with user-friendly regular expressions and value-passing constructs; subsumes [[Computation tree logic|CTL]] and [[Linear temporal logic|LTL]].
* mCRL2 mu-calculus: Kozen's propositional [[modal μ-calculus]] (excluding atomic propositions), extended with: data-depended processes, quantification over data types, multi-actions, time, and regular formulas.
*[[Probabilistic CTL|PCTL]]: Probabilistic [[Computation tree logic|CTL]]; an extension of CTL which allows for probabilistic quantification of described properties.
*PLTL: Probabilistic Linear Temporal Logic.
*PRCTL: Probabilistic Reward Computation Tree Logic; it extends [[Probabilistic CTL|PCTL]] with reward-bounded properties.
*[[Property Specification Language|PSL]]: Property specification language
*XTL: eXtended Temporal Language; a domain-specific language for quickly implementing action-based, explicit-state, value-passing model checkers.

==Comparison of model checking tools==

===Scientific publications===

There exists a few papers that systematically compare various model checkers on a common case study. The comparison usually discusses the modelling tradeoffs faced when using the input languages of each model checker, as well as the comparison of performances of the tools when verifying correctness properties. One can mention:

* In 1999, Judi Romijn compared two model checkers ([[Construction and Analysis of Distributed Processes|CADP]] and [[SPIN model checker|SPIN]]) on the HAVi interoperability audio-video protocol for consumer electronics.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite techreport |last1=Romijn |first1=Judi |title=Model Checking a HAVi Leader Election Protocol |institution=CWI |type=Technical Report |number=SEN-R9915 |location=Amsterdam |date=June 1999 |layurl=http://cadp.inria.fr/case-studies/99-a-havi.html}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2003, Yifei Dong, Xiaoqun Du, Gerard J. Holzmann, and Scott A. Smolka published a comparison of four model checkers (namely: Cospan, Murphi, [[SPIN model checker|SPIN]], and XMC) on a communication protocol, the GNU i-protocol.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last1=Dong |first1=Yifei |last2=Du |first2= Xiaoqun |last3=Holzmann |first3=Gerard |last4=Smolka |first4=Scott |title=Fighting Livelock in the GNU i-Protocol: A Case Study in Explicit-State Model Checking |journal=Software Tool for Technology Transfer |volume=4 |number=4 |pages=505–528 |year=2003}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 2005, Elena M. Bortnik, Nikola Trcka, Anton Wijs, Bas Luttik, J. M. van de Mortel-Fronczak, Jos C. M. Baeten, Wan Fokkink, and J. E. Rooda published a comparison of four model checkers (namely: [[Construction and Analysis of Distributed Processes|CADP]], muCRL, [[SPIN model checker|SPIN]], and [[Uppaal Model Checker|UPPAAL]]) on an industrial manufacturing system, a rotating drilling machine.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last1=Bortnik |first1=Elena M. |last2=Trcka |first2= Nikola |last3=Wijs |first3=Anton |last4=Luttik |first4=Bas |last5=van de Mortel-Fronczak |first5=J. M. |last6=Baeten |first6=Jos C.

&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2018, F. Mazzanti and A. Ferrari published a comparison of ten model checkers (namely: [[Construction and Analysis of Distributed Processes|CADP]], CPN Tools, FDR4, [[NuSMV]]/nuXmv, [[mCRL2]], ProB, [[SPIN model checker|SPIN]], [[TLA+]], UMC, and [[Uppaal Model Checker|UPPAAL]]) on a train supervision problem, taking into account both the user-friendliness of the languages and the performance of the tools.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite conference|last1=Mazzanti |first1=Franco |last2=Ferrari |first2=Alessio |year=2018 |title=Ten Diverse Formal Models for a CBTC Automatic Train Supervision System |booktitle=Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Models for Formal Analysis of Real Systems and 6th International Workshop on Verification and Program Transformation (MARS/VPT’18), Thessaloniki, Greece |series=Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science |volume=268 |publisher=arXiv |pages=104–149 |doi=10.4204/EPTCS.268.4 |arxiv=1803.10324v1}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===International software competitions===

* Since 2007, the [http://fmv.jku.at/hwmcc17/ Hardware Model Checking Competition] (HWMCC) compares the performances of model checking tools oriented towards hardware design.
* Since 2011, the [https://mcc.lip6.fr/ Model Checking Contest] (MCC) compare performances of model checking tools designed to analyze highly concurrent systems.

===Common benchmarks===

* [http://mcc.lip6.fr/models.php MCC] (models of the Model Checking Contest): a collection of hundreds of Petri nets originating from many academic and industrial case studies.
* [http://cadp.inria.fr/resources/vlts/ VLTS] (Very Large Transition Systems): a collection of Labelled Transition Systems of increasing sizes, used in many scientific publications.

'''NOTE''': [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], The 32nd [[President of the United States]], was stricken with a paralytic illness in 1921, at age 39. His main symptoms were fever; symmetric, ascending paralysis; facial paralysis; bowel and bladder dysfunction; numbness and hyperesthesia; and a descending pattern of recovery. He was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down. Roosevelt was diagnosed with "infantile paralysis" ([[Poliomyelitis#Paralytic polio|paralytic polio]]) at the time, but his symptoms are more consistent with [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]], which his doctors failed to consider as a diagnostic possibility.

This table was current {{as of|2018|11|27|lc=y|df=US}}.
The columns are defined as follows:
* '''Inventor''': The name of the inventor.
* '''# of patents''': This is the number of [[utility patent]]s that have been issued. Only utility patents (or the international equivalent) are listed, as a utility patent is a patent for an [[invention]]. Not all patents are for inventions. Other patent types include: [[design patent]]s for the ornamental [[design]] of an object; [[plant patent]]s for plant varieties; and [[Reissue application|reissue patents]], where a correction is made to an already granted patent. This list does not include patent applications ([[patents pending]]) as there is no guarantee that a patent application actually describes a novel invention until the patent is granted.
* '''Country''': This is the country of birth or upbringing of the inventor, where known. If unknown, this is the country of residence identified in the inventor's patent filings.
* '''Active''': The first and last year in which an inventor received a patent issuance, except when activity was prior to digital records, in which case year of birth (b) and death (d) may be substituted. If an inventor's first year is 1976 or a few years after, there may be activity prior to this; earlier dates are not present in the primary source, and would require a secondary source.
* '''Main fields of invention''': These are the main areas that the inventor is or was active in.

==Threshold for inclusion==
As the average number of patents per inventor is around 3, some sources define prolific inventors as five times above the average (in terms of patents), leading to a threshold of 15 patents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1625743 ''Prolific Inventors: Who are They and Where do They Locate?'' International Centre for Economic Research Working Paper No. 14/2010]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this table currently has an arbitrary cut-off limit for inclusion of 200 patents. This is purely for practical reasons – there are tens of thousands of inventors with more than 15 patents. The threshold of 200 patents means that some famous prolific inventors such as [[Nikola Tesla]] are not included in this list, as Tesla had 111 patents.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of Nikola Tesla patents]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspat.com/tesla/ Jim Bieberich's Complete Nikola Tesla U.S. Patent Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of inventions==
This table is a sortable list of the most prolific inventors as measured by utility patents granted. It does not include other types of invention, such as inventions that were never applied for nor granted, for which there is no known source. Nor does the table attempt to measure the significance of an inventor and their inventions. The significance of inventions is often not apparent until many decades after the invention has been made. For recent inventors, it is not yet possible to determine their place in history.

The common symbol for inventiveness, the light bulb, is an example. The first [[incandescent light bulb]] was invented by British [[chemist]] [[Sir Humphry Davy]] in 1802. Many subsequent inventors improved Davy's invention prior to the successful commercialization of electric lighting by [[Thomas Edison]] in 1880, 78 years later. Electric lighting continued to be developed. Edison's carbon filament light bulb was made obsolete by the tungsten filament light bulb, invented in 1904 by [[Sándor Just]] and [[Franjo Hanaman]]. It is this that forms the popular conception of a light bulb, though there are other major forms of lighting. The principle of [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lights]] was known since 1845, and various inventors, including Edison and [[Nikola Tesla]] worked on them without commercial success. Various improvements were made by many other inventors, until [[General Electric]] introduced "fluorescent lumiline lamps" commercially in 1938, first available to the public at the [[1939 World's Fair]]. [[LED lamps]] also have a long history, with the first [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) invented in 1927 by [[Oleg Losev]]. LEDs were initially of low brightness, and have been used as indicator lamps and [[seven-segment display]]s since 1968. It wasn't until the development of high efficiency blue LEDs by [[Shuji Nakamura]] in the 1980s that white LEDs for lighting applications became practical. Although higher cost than incandescent light bulbs, LEDs have higher efficiency and longer life and may finally displace light bulbs in general lighting applications. In each case, more than 50 years passed between the initial invention and commercial success in general lighting applications.

==Various published lists==
Rankings of prolific inventors have been published at various times. However, until the patent records were digitized, these lists were very tedious to prepare, as many thousands of patent records had to be checked manually. Even after digitization, it is still not a simple process. While the [[USPTO]] keeps statistics for annual rankings of inventions assigned to companies, it no longer publishes rankings of individual inventors. The last such list was published by the USPTO in 1998.&lt;ref name="USPTO list 1988-1997"&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/inv_prol.pdf USPTO publication: Prolific Inventors Receiving Utility Patents 1988-1997]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, patents predating 1976 have not yet been digitized in the USPTO records. This means that patents before 1976 will not be included in a USPTO search by inventor name, and the number of patents granted before 1976 must be added to current searches.

==Popular Science (1936)==
In January 1936, ''[[Popular Science]]'' published a list of the "most prolific living inventors to be found in America today".&lt;ref name="Popular Science" /&gt;

This table omitted Rick Allen Hamilton II. The USPTO database shows Hamilton was an inventor or co-inventor of 128 US patents granted in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=0&amp;p=1&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;Query=in%2F%28%22Hamilton%3B+Rick+Allen%22+or+%22Hamilton+II%3B+Rick%22%29+and+apt%2F1+and+isd%2F2012&amp;d=PTXT USPTO Utility Patent Search for Rick Allen Hamilton II for 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; which would place Hamilton at 6th rank for 2012.

==Differences between lists==
Differences in patent numbers between the various lists are due to several reasons:
* The lists were created on different dates. As many of the inventors in the lists are still active, the number of patents they hold are increasing.
* While the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ([[USPTO]]) is the primary source for U.S. patent information, only patents issued since 1976 can be electronically searched by the inventor's name at the USPTO website. For some of the listed inventors, such as [[Thomas Edison]], all of their patents predate 1976, so other sources must be used.
* Often entities list the worldwide total number of patents that they hold. This is not the same as the number of inventions, as a patent in one country may be for the same invention as a patent in another country. The set of patents covering a ''single'' invention in different countries is a [[Patent family]].
* The Time, USA Today and Portfolio lists show the total number of U.S. patents, including patents for designs ([[Design patents]]) as well as patents for inventions ([[Utility patent]]s).
* The annual lists from strutpatent.com list only those patents issued in the particular year to the inventor, not all of the inventor's patents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13532">The '''Matthews correlation coefficient''' is used in [[machine learning]] as a measure of the quality of binary (two-class) [[Binary classification|classifications]], introduced by biochemist [[Brian Matthews (biochemist)|Brian W. Matthews]] in 1975.&lt;ref name="Matthews1975"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matthews|first=B. W.|title=Comparison of the predicted and observed secondary structure of T4 phage lysozyme|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Protein Structure|date=1975|volume=405|issue=2|pages=442–451|doi=10.1016/0005-2795(75)90109-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes into account true and false positives and negatives and is generally regarded as a balanced measure which can be used even if the classes are of very different sizes.&lt;ref name="Boughorbel2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boughorbel|first=S.B |title=Optimal classifier for imbalanced data using Matthews Correlation Coefficient metric|journal=PLOS One|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MCC is in essence a correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted binary classifications; it returns a value between &amp;minus;1 and +1. A coefficient of +1 represents a perfect prediction, 0 no better than random prediction and &amp;minus;1 indicates total disagreement between prediction and observation. The statistic is also known as the [[phi coefficient]]. MCC is related to the [[Pearson's chi-square test|chi-square statistic]] for a 2×2 [[contingency table]]

: &lt;math&gt;|\text{MCC}| = \sqrt{\frac{\chi^2}{n}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the total number of observations.

While there is no perfect way of describing the [[confusion matrix]] of true and false positives and negatives by a single number, the Matthews correlation coefficient is generally regarded as being one of the best such measures.&lt;ref name="Powers2011"/&gt; Other measures, such as the proportion of correct predictions (also termed [[accuracy]]), are not useful when the two classes are of very different sizes. For example, assigning every object to the larger set achieves a high proportion of correct predictions, but is not generally a useful classification.

The MCC can be calculated directly from the [[confusion matrix]] using the formula:

: &lt;math&gt;
\text{MCC} = \frac{ TP \times TN - FP \times FN } {\sqrt{ (TP + FP) ( TP + FN ) ( TN + FP ) ( TN + FN ) } }
&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, ''TP'' is the number of [[true positive]]s, ''TN'' the number of [[true negative]]s, ''FP'' the number of [[false positive]]s and ''FN'' the number of [[false negative]]s. If any of the four sums in the denominator is zero, the denominator can be arbitrarily set to one; this results in a Matthews correlation coefficient of zero, which can be shown to be the correct limiting value.

The original formula as given by Matthews was:&lt;ref name=Matthews1975 /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
\text{N} = TN + TP + FN + FP
&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
\text{S} = \frac{ TP + FN } { N }
&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
\text{P} = \frac{ TP + FP } { N }
&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
\text{MCC} = \frac{ TP / N - S \times P } {\sqrt{ P S  ( 1 - S)  ( 1 - P ) } }
&lt;/math&gt;

This is equal to the formula given above. As a [[Correlation and dependence|correlation coefficient]], the Matthews correlation coefficient is the [[geometric mean]] of the [[regression coefficient]]s of the problem and its [[Dual (mathematics)|dual]]. The component regression coefficients of the Matthews correlation coefficient are [[Markedness]] (Δp) and [[Youden's J statistic]] ([[Informedness]] or Δp').&lt;ref name="Powers2011"&gt;{{cite journal |first=David M W |last=Powers |date=2011 |title=Evaluation: From Precision, Recall and F-Measure  to ROC, Informedness, Markedness &amp; Correlation |journal=Journal of Machine Learning Technologies |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=37–63 |url=http://www.flinders.edu.au/science_engineering/fms/School-CSEM/publications/tech_reps-research_artfcts/TRRA_2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perruchet2004"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=P. |last1=Perruchet |first2=R. |last2=Peereman |year=2004 |title=The exploitation of distributional information in syllable processing |journal=J.

== Confusion matrix ==
{{main article|Confusion matrix}}

{{Confusion matrix terms|recall=}}

Let us define an experiment from '''P''' positive instances and '''N''' negative instances for some condition. The four outcomes can be formulated in a 2×2 ''[[contingency table]]'' or ''[[confusion matrix]]'', as follows:

{{DiagnosticTesting_Diagram}}

== Multiclass case ==
The Matthews correlation coefficient has been generalized to the multiclass case. This generalization was called the  &lt;math&gt;R_K&lt;/math&gt; statistic (for K different classes) by the author, and defined in terms of a &lt;math&gt;K\times K&lt;/math&gt; confusion matrix &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;ref name="gorodkin2004comparing"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gorodkin|first=Jan|title=Comparing two K-category assignments by a K-category correlation coefficient|journal=Computational Biology and Chemistry|date=2004|volume=28|number=5|pages=367–374}}&lt;/ref&gt;
.&lt;ref name="GorodkinRk2006"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gorodkin|first1=Jan|title=The Rk Page|url=http://rk.kvl.dk/introduction/index.html|website=The Rk Page|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\text{MCC} = \frac{\sum_{k}\sum_{l}\sum_{m} C_{kk}C_{lm} - C_{kl}C_{mk}}{
\sqrt{
\sum_{k}(\sum_l C_{kl} )(\sum_{k' | k' \neq k}\sum_{l'} C_{k'l'})
}
\sqrt{
\sum_{k}(\sum_l C_{lk} )(\sum_{k' | k' \neq k}\sum_{l'} C_{l'k'})
}
}
&lt;/math&gt;

When there are more than two labels the MCC will no longer range between -1 and +1. Instead the minimum value will be between -1 and 0 depending on the true distribution. The maximum value is always +1.

&lt;!-- 
TODO: potentially un-comment later, for now just stick with referenced version

This formula can be more easily understood by defining intermediate variables: 
* &lt;math&gt;t_k=\sum_i C_{ik}&lt;/math&gt; the number of times class k truly occurred, 
* &lt;math&gt;p_k=\sum_i C_{ki}&lt;/math&gt; the number of times class k was predicted, 
* &lt;math&gt;c=\sum_{k} C_{kk}&lt;/math&gt; the total number of samples correctly predicted, 
* &lt;math&gt;s=\sum_i \sum_j C_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; the total number of samples. This allows the formula to be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\text{MCC} = \frac{cs - \vec{t} \cdot \vec{p}}{
\sqrt{s^2 - \vec{p} \cdot \vec{p}}
\sqrt{s^2 - \vec{t} \cdot \vec{t}}
}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Advantages of MCC over accuracy and F1 score ==
As explained by Davide Chicco in his paper ''"Ten quick tips for machine learning in computational biology"'' ([[BioData Mining]], 2017), the Matthews correlation coefficient is more informative than other confusion matrix measures (such as F1 score and accuracy) in evaluating binary classification problems, because it takes into account the balance ratios of the four confusion matrix categories (true positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The paper explains, for ''Tip 8'':

{{Quote
|text=In order to have an overall understanding of your prediction, you decide to take advantage of common statistical scores, such as accuracy, and F1 score.
: &lt;math&gt;
\text{accuracy} = \frac{ TP+TN } {TP+TN+FP+FN} 
&lt;/math&gt;
(Equation 1, accuracy: worst value = 0; best value = 1)

: &lt;math&gt;
\text{F1 score} = \frac{ 2 TP } {2 TP+FP+FN}
&lt;/math&gt;
(Equation 2, F1 score: worst value = 0; best value = 1)

However, even if accuracy and F1 score are widely employed in statistics, both can be misleading, since they do not fully consider the size of the four classes of the confusion matrix in their final score computation.

Suppose, for example, you have a very imbalanced validation set made of 100 elements, 95 of which are positive elements, and only 5 are negative elements (as explained in Tip 5). And suppose also you made some mistakes in designing and training your machine learning classifier, and now you have an algorithm which always predicts positive. Imagine that you are not aware of this issue.

By applying your only-positive predictor to your imbalanced validation set, therefore, you obtain values for the confusion matrix categories:

TP = 95, FP = 5; TN = 0, FN = 0.

These values lead to the following performance scores: accuracy = 95%, and F1 score = 97.44%. By reading these over-optimistic scores, then you will be very happy and will think that your machine learning algorithm is doing an excellent job. Obviously, you would be on the wrong track.

On the contrary, to avoid these dangerous misleading illusions, there is another performance score that you can exploit: the Matthews correlation coefficient [40] (MCC).
: &lt;math&gt;
\text{MCC} = \frac{ TP \times TN - FP \times FN } {\sqrt{ (TP + FP) ( TP + FN ) ( TN + FP ) ( TN + FN ) } }
&lt;/math&gt;
(Equation 3, MCC: worst value = −1; best value = +1).

By considering the proportion of each class of the confusion matrix in its formula, its score is high only if your classifier is doing well on both the negative and the positive elements.

In the example above, the MCC score would be undefined (since TN and FN would be 0, therefore the denominator of Equation 3 would be 0). By checking this value, instead of accuracy and F1 score, you would then be able to notice that your classifier is going in the wrong direction, and you would become aware that there are issues you ought to solve before proceeding.

Let us consider this other example. You ran a classification on the same dataset which led to the following values for the confusion matrix categories:

TP = 90, FP = 4; TN = 1, FN = 5.

In this example, the classifier has performed well in classifying positive instances, but was not able to correctly recognize negative data elements. Again, the resulting F1 score and accuracy scores would be extremely high: accuracy = 91%, and F1 score = 95.24%. Similarly to the previous case, if a researcher analyzed only these two score indicators, without considering the MCC, he/she would wrongly think the algorithm is performing quite well in its task, and would have the illusion of being successful.

On the other hand, checking the Matthews correlation coefficient would be pivotal once again. In this example, the value of the MCC would be 0.14 (Equation 3), indicating that the algorithm is performing similarly to random guessing. Acting as an alarm, the MCC would be able to inform the data mining practitioner that the statistical model is performing poorly.

For these reasons, we strongly encourage to evaluate each test performance through the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), instead of the accuracy and the F1 score, for any binary classification problem.

|author=Davide Chicco}}

Note that the F1 score depends on which class is defined as the positive class. In the first example above, the F1 score is high because the majority class is defined as the positive class. Inverting the positive and negative classes results in the following confusion matrix:

TP = 0, FP = 0; TN = 5, FN = 95

This gives an F1 score = 0%.

The MCC doesn't depend on which class is the positive one, which has the advantage over the F1 score to avoid incorrectly defining the positive class.

The '''National Physical Laboratory''' ('''NPL''') is the national [[measurement standards laboratory]] for the United Kingdom, based at [[Bushy Park]] in [[Teddington]], London, England. It comes under the management of the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]].

==History==
[[File:National Physical Laboratory- Science and Technology in Wartime, Teddington, Middlesex, England, UK, 1944 D22641.jpg|thumb|left|The Electricity Division of the National Physical Laboratory in 1944]]
The National Physical Laboratory was established in 1900 at [[Bushy House]] "to bring scientific knowledge to bear practically upon our everyday industrial and commercial life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npl.co.uk/upload/pdf/npl-history.pdf|title=history|publisher=National Physical Laboratory|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It grew to fill a large selection of buildings on the Teddington site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.npl.co.uk/upload/pdf/Development%20of%20the%20NPL%20Site%201900-1970.pdf |title=Development of the NPL Site 1900-1970.pdf |year=2013 |accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; NPL procured a large state-of-the-art laboratory under a [[Private Finance Initiative]] contract in 1998. The construction, which was being undertaken by [[John Laing Group|John Laing]], and the maintenance of this new building, which was being undertaken by [[Serco]], was transferred back to the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|DTI]] in 2004 after the private sector companies involved made losses of over £100m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nao.org.uk/report/the-termination-of-the-pfi-contract-for-the-national-physical-laboratory/ |title=The Termination of the PFI Contract for the National Physical Laboratory &amp;#124;National Audit Office |work=nao.org.uk |year=2013 |accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The laboratory was initially run by the UK government, with members of staff being part of [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|the civil service]]. Administration of the NPL was contracted out in 1995 under a Government Owned Contractor Operated model, with [[Serco]] winning the bid and all staff transferred to their employ. Under this regime, overhead costs halved, third party revenues grew by 16% per annum, and the number of peer-reviewed research papers published doubled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethosjournal.com/home/item/301-labs-under-the-microscope Labs under the microscope – Ethos]. Ethosjournal.com (2 February 2012).

===Computing===
NPL has undertaken computer research since the mid-1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.npl.co.uk/science-technology/mathematics-modelling-and-simulation/history-of-computing/|title=History of NPL Computing|website=National Physical Laboratory|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1945, [[Alan Turing]] led the design of the [[Automatic Computing Engine]] (ACE) computer. The ACE project was overambitious and floundered, leading to Turing's departure.&lt;ref name="MCK"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Martin|last=Cambell-Kelly|title=Pioneer Profiles: Donald Davies|journal=Computer Resurrection|number=44|date=Autumn 2008|ISSN=0958-7403|url=http://www.computerconservationsociety.org/resurrection/res44.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Davies]] took the project over and concentrated on delivering the less ambitious [[Pilot ACE]] computer, which first worked in May 1950. Among those who worked on the project was American computer pioneer [[Harry Huskey]]. A commercial spin-off, [[English Electric DEUCE|DEUCE]] was manufactured by [[English Electric Computers]] and became one of the best-selling machines of the 1950s.&lt;ref name="MCK"/&gt;

===Packet switching===
{{Main|NPL network}}
{{See also|History of the Internet|Internet in the United Kingdom#History}}
Beginning in the mid-1960s, [[Donald Davies]] and his team at the NPL pioneered [[packet switching]], now the dominant basis for data communications in [[computer network]]s worldwide. Davies designed and proposed a national data network based on packet switching in his 1965 ''Proposal for the Development of a National Communications Service for On-line Data Processing''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Davies | first = D. W. | author-link = Donald | title = Proposal for a Digital Communication Network | publisher = National Physical Laboratory | year = 1966 | url = http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~wpc/grcs/Davies05.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the NPL team (Davies, Derek Barber, Roger Scantlebury, Peter Wilkinson, Keith Bartlett, and Brian Aldous)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technology of the Internet|url=http://www.tnmoc.org/explore/npl-technology-internet-gallery|publisher=The National Museum of Computing|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed the concept into a local area network which operated from 1969 to 1986, and carried out work to analyse and simulate the performance of packet switching networks. Their research and practice influenced the [[ARPANET]] in the United States, the forerunner of the [[Internet]], and other researchers in the UK and Europe.&lt;ref name=Gillies2000&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gillies|first1=James|last2=Cailliau|first2=Robert|title=How the Web was Born: The Story of the World Wide Web|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0192862073|page=25|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pIH-JijUNS0C&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;ots=MKZj0F7pJN&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Isaacson2014&gt;{{cite book|last1=Isaacson|first1=Walter|title=The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution|date=2014|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=9781476708690|page=237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4V9koAEACAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA237#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hempstead2005&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ZCNAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA574&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author1=C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3352">"'''Nature Farming'''" was established in 1936 by [[Mokichi Okada]], the founder of the [[Church of World Messianity]], an agricultural system originally called "no fertilizer farming" or {{nihongo|[[:ja:自然農法|自然農法]]|shizen nōhō}} in Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Sustainable Agriculture: Definition and Terms. Special Reference Briefs Series no. SRB 99-02, September 1999. Compiled by: Mary V. Gold, Alternative Farming Systems Information Center, U.S. Department of Agriculture&lt;/ref&gt;

Offshoots such as the Sekai Kyusei Kyo, promoting ‘Kyusei nature farming’, and the Mokichi Okada Association formed after his death to continue promoting the work in Japan and South-East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Setboonsarng, S. and Gilman, J. 1999. Alternative Agriculture in Thailand and Japan. HORIZON Communications, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.&lt;/ref&gt;

ZZ2, a farming conglomerate in South Africa has translated the term to [[Afrikaans]], "Natuurboerdery".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Silent|first=Taurayi,|title=An investigation of natuurboerdery (natural farming) approach : a ZZ2 case study|date=March 2011|publisher=Stellenbosch : University of Stellenbosch|url=http://scholar.sun.ac.za/handle/10019.1/6694|language=en-ZA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the International Nature Farming Research Center in [[Nagano Prefecture|Nagano]], Japan,&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Proof of Mokichi Okada's Nature Farming Theories by Xu, Hui-lian. Agricultural Experiment Station, International Nature Farming Research Center, Nagano&lt;/ref&gt; it is based on the theories that:
* [[Fertilizer]]s pollute the soil and weaken its power of production.
* [[Pest (organism)|Pests]] would break out from the excessive use of fertilizers
* The difference in disease incidence between resistant and susceptible plants is attributed to nutritional conditions inside the body.
* Vegetables and fruits produced by nature farming taste better than those by [[Industrial agriculture|chemical farming]].
The term is sometimes used for an alternative farming philosophy of [[Masanobu Fukuoka]].

==Natural Farming==
{{Main|Natural Farming}}
Another Japanese farmer and philosopher, [[Masanobu Fukuoka]], conceived of an alternative farming system in the 1930s separately from Okada and used the same Japanese characters to describe it.&lt;ref name="NATURE FARMING-Xu1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Xu|first=Hui-Lian|title=NATURE FARMING In Japan|url=http://www.ressign.com/UserBookDetail.aspx?bkid=460&amp;catid=140|accessdate=6 March 2011|type=Monograph|year=2001|publisher=Research Signpost|location=T.

The '''United States's Whetstone nuclear test series'''&lt;ref name=LT_1 /&gt; was a group of 46 [[nuclear test]]s conducted in 1964-1965. These tests &lt;ref group=note&gt;A bomb test may be a salvo test, defined as two or more explosions "where a period of time between successive individual explosions does not exceed 5 seconds and where the burial points of all explosive devices can be connected by segments of straight lines, each of them connecting two burial points and does not exceed 40 kilometers in length". {{cite paper|first=V.

 |-
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | Name &lt;ref group=note&gt;The US, France and Great Britain have code-named their test events, while the USSR and China did not, and therefore have only test numbers (with some exceptions &amp;ndash; Soviet peaceful explosions were named). Word translations into English in parentheses unless the name is a proper noun. A dash followed by a number indicates a member of a salvo event.  The US also sometimes named the individual explosions in such a salvo test, which results in "name1 &amp;ndash; 1(with name2)". If test is canceled or aborted, then the row data like date and location discloses the intended plans, where known.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Date time ([[Universal Time|UT]])
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | Local [[Time Zone|time zone]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;To convert the UT time into standard local, add the number of hours in parentheses to the UT time; for local daylight saving time, add one additional hour. If the result is earlier than 00:00, add 24 hours and subtract 1 from the day; if it is 24:00 or later, subtract 24 hours and add 1 to the day. All historical timezone data are derived from here:&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Timezone Historical Database| publisher=iana.com| url=http://www.ietf.org/timezones/| accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | [[List of nuclear test sites|Location]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Rough place name and a latitude/longitude reference; for rocket-carried tests, the launch location is specified before the detonation location, if known. Some locations are extremely accurate; others (like airdrops and space blasts) may be quite inaccurate. "~" indicates a likely pro-forma rough location, shared with other tests in that same area.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | [[Elevation]] + height &lt;ref group=note&gt;Elevation is the ground level at the point directly below the explosion relative to sea level; height is the additional distance added or subtracted by tower, balloon, shaft, tunnel, air drop or other contrivance. For rocket bursts the ground level is "N/A". In some cases it is not clear if the height is absolute or relative to ground, for example, ''Plumbbob/John''.  No number or units indicates the value is unknown, while "0" means zero. Sorting on this column is by elevation and height added together.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Delivery &lt;ref group=note&gt;Atmospheric, airdrop, balloon, gun, cruise missile, rocket, surface, tower, and barge are all disallowed by the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]]. Sealed shaft and tunnel are underground, and remained useful under the PTBT. Intentional cratering tests are borderline; they occurred under the treaty, were sometimes protested, and generally overlooked if the test was declared to be a peaceful use.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purpose &lt;ref group=note&gt;Include weapons development, weapon effects, safety test, transport safety test, war, science, joint verification and industrial/peaceful, which may be further broken down.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | [[List of nuclear weapons|Device]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Designations for test items where known, "?" indicates some uncertainty about the preceding value, nicknames for particular devices in quotes. This category of information is often not officially disclosed.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | [[Nuclear weapon yield|Yield]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Estimated energy yield in [[TNT equivalent|tons, kilotons, and megatons]]. A ton of TNT equivalent is defined as 4.184&amp;nbsp;gigajoules (1&amp;nbsp;gigacalorie).&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" class="unsortable" | [[Nuclear fallout|Fallout]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Radioactive emission to the atmosphere aside from prompt neutrons, where known.  The measured species is only iodine-131 if mentioned, otherwise it is all species. No entry means unknown, probably none if underground and "all" if not; otherwise notation for whether measured on the site only or off the site, where known, and the measured amount of radioactivity released.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pectin.jpg|thumb|Pectin, a bio polymer of (among other constituents) [[D-galacturonic acid]], shown here in a powder form]]

'''Pectin''' (from {{lang-grc|πηκτικός}} ''{{transl|grc|pēktikós}}'', "congealed, curdled"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2382916 Pektikos, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, "A Greek-English Lexicon", at Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a structural [[heteropolysaccharide]] contained in the primary [[cell wall]]s of [[terrestrial plant]]s. It was first isolated and described in 1825 by [[Henri Braconnot]].&lt;ref&gt;Braconnot, Henri (1825) [https://books.google.com/books?id=1Zg5AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA173#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Recherches sur un nouvel acide universellement répandu dans tous les vegetaux"] (Investigations into a new acid spread throughout all plants), ''Annales de chimie et de physique'', series 2, '''28''' :  173-178.  From page 178:  … ''je propose le nom ''pectique'', de πηχτες, coagulum,'' … ( …  I propose the name ''pectique'', from πηχτες [pectes], coagulum [coagulated material, clot, or curd], … ).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=16407949|year=2006|last1=Keppler|first1=F|last2=Hamilton|first2=JT|last3=Brass|first3=M|last4=Röckmann|first4=T|title=Methane emissions from terrestrial plants under aerobic conditions|volume=439|issue=7073|pages=187–91|doi=10.1038/nature04420|journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is produced commercially as a white to light brown powder, mainly extracted from [[citrus fruit]]s, and is used in food as a [[gelling agent]], particularly in [[jam]]s and jellies. It is also used in dessert fillings, medicines, sweets, as a stabilizer in fruit juices and milk drinks, and as a source of [[dietary fiber]].

==Biology==
In plant biology, pectin consists of a complex set of polysaccharides (see below) that are present in most primary cell walls and are particularly abundant in the non-woody parts of terrestrial plants. Pectin is a major component of the [[middle lamella]], where it helps to bind cells together, but is also found in primary cell walls. Pectin is deposited by exocytosis into the cell wall via vesicles produced in the golgi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Braidwood|first1=Luke|last2=Breuer|first2=Christian|last3=Sugimoto|first3=Keiko|title=My body is a cage: mechanisms and modulation of plant cell growth|journal=New Phytologist|date=1 August 2013|volume=201|page=388-402|doi=10.1111/nph.12473|url=https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nph.12473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount, structure and chemical composition of pectin differs among plants, within a plant over time, and in various parts of a plant. Pectin is an important cell wall polysaccharide that allows primary cell wall extension and plant growth. During fruit [[ripening]], pectin is broken down by the [[enzyme]]s [[pectinase]] and [[pectinesterase]], in which process the fruit becomes softer as the middle lamellae break down and cells become separated from each other.&lt;ref name=Grierson&gt;{{cite journal |first1=D|last1=Grierson|first2=MJ|last2=Maunders|first3=A|last3=Slater|first4=J|last4=Ray|first5=CR|last5=Bird|first6=W|last6=Schuch|first7=MJ|last7=Holdsworth|first8=GA|last8=Tucker|first9=JE|last9=Knapp|year=1986|title=Gene expression during tomato ripening|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B|volume=314|pages=399–410|doi=10.1098/rstb.1986.0061}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar process of cell separation caused by the breakdown of pectin occurs in the [[abscission zone]] of the [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]]s of [[deciduous]] plants at leaf fall.{{Citation needed|date = March 2015}}

Pectin is a natural part of the human [[wikt:diet|diet]], but does not contribute significantly to [[wikt:nutrition|nutrition]]. The daily intake of pectin from fruits and vegetables can be estimated to be around 5&amp;nbsp;g if approximately 500&amp;nbsp;g of fruits and vegetables are consumed per day.

In human digestion, pectin binds to cholesterol in the gastrointestinal tract and slows glucose absorption by trapping carbohydrates. Pectin is thus a soluble [[dietary fiber]]. In [[NOD mice|non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice]] pectin has been shown to increase the incidence of diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25031069 | title=Fermentable fibres condition colon microbiota and promote diabetogenesis in NOD mice. | date=Oct 2014 | journal=Diabetologia | doi=10.1007/s00125-014-3325-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study found that after consumption of fruit the concentration of [[Methanol#Human metabolite|methanol]] in the human body increased by as much as an order of magnitude due to the degradation of natural pectin (which is esterified with methyl alcohol) in the [[Large intestine|colon]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9267548 | volume=21 | title=Endogenous production of methanol after the consumption of fruit. | date=Aug 1997 | journal=Alcohol Clin Exp Res | pages=939–43 | doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.1997.tb03862.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pectin has been observed to have some function in DNA repair of plants. Pectinaceous surface pellicles, which are rich in pectin, create a mucilage layer that holds in dew that helps the cell repair its DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Z.|last2=Boubriak|first2=I.|last3=Osborne|first3=D.

Consumption of pectin has been shown to slightly (3-7%) reduce blood LDL cholesterol levels. The effect depends upon the source of pectin; apple and citrus pectins were more effective than orange pulp fiber pectin.&lt;ref name="BrounsTheuwissen2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brouns|first1=F|last2=Theuwissen|first2=E|last3=Adam|first3=A|last4=Bell|first4=M|last5=Berger|first5=A|last6=Mensink|first6=R P|title=Cholesterol-lowering properties of different pectin types in mildly hyper-cholesterolemic men and women|journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=66|issue=5|year=2011|pages=591–599|issn=0954-3007|doi=10.1038/ejcn.2011.208}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism appears to be an increase of viscosity in the intestinal tract, leading to a reduced absorption of cholesterol from bile or food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.journal.su.ac.th/index.php/suij/article/viewFile/48/48 |author=Sriamornsak, Pornsak |title=Chemistry of Pectin and its Pharmaceutical Uses: A Review |journal=Silpakorn University International Journal |volume=3 |issue=1–2 |year=2003 |page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the large intestine and colon, microorganisms degrade pectin and liberate short-chain fatty acids that have positive influence on health ([[Prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]] effect).&lt;ref name="GómezGullón2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gómez|first1=Belén|last2=Gullón|first2=Beatriz|last3=Remoroza|first3=Connie|last4=Schols|first4=Henk A.|last5=Parajó|first5=Juan C.|last6=Alonso|first6=José L.|title=Purification, Characterization, and Prebiotic Properties of Pectic Oligosaccharides from Orange Peel Wastes|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=62|issue=40|year=2014|pages=9769–9782|issn=0021-8561|doi=10.1021/jf503475b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
Pectins, also known as pectic polysaccharides, are rich in galacturonic acid. Several distinct polysaccharides have been identified and characterised within the pectic group. Homogalacturonans are linear chains of α-(1–4)-linked [[D-galacturonic acid]].&lt;ref name="ccrcgala"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Substituted galacturonans are characterized by the presence of saccharide appendant residues (such as D-[[xylose]] or D-[[apiose]] in the respective cases of xylogalacturonan and apiogalacturonan) branching from a backbone of D-galacturonic acid residues.&lt;ref name="ccrcgala"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buchanan2000"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhamnogalacturonan I pectins (RG-I) contain a backbone of the repeating disaccharide: 4)-α-D-galacturonic acid-(1,2)-α-L-[[rhamnose]]-(1. From many of the rhamnose residues, sidechains of various neutral sugars branch off. The neutral sugars are mainly D-[[galactose]], L-[[arabinose]] and D-xylose, with the types and proportions of neutral sugars varying with the origin of pectin.&lt;ref name="ccrcgala"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buchanan2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccrc.uga.edu/~mao/rg1/rg1.htm RG-I]. Ccrc.uga.edu. Retrieved on 2012-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another structural type of pectin is [[rhamnogalacturonan II]] (RG-II), which is a less frequent, complex, highly branched polysaccharide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccrc.uga.edu/~mao/rg2/intro.htm rhamnogalacturonan II on www.ccrc.uga.edu]. Ccrc.uga.edu. Retrieved on 2012-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rhamnogalacturonan II]] is classified by some authors within the group of substituted galacturonans since the rhamnogalacturonan II backbone is made exclusively of D-galacturonic acid units.&lt;ref name="Buchanan2000"/&gt;

Isolated pectin has a [[molecular weight]] of typically 60,000–130,000 g/mol, varying with origin and extraction conditions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In nature, around 80 percent of [[carboxyl group]]s of galacturonic acid are [[ester]]ified with [[methanol]]. This proportion is decreased to a varying degree during pectin extraction. The ratio of esterified to non-esterified galacturonic acid determines the behavior of pectin in food applications. This is why pectins are classified as high- vs. low-ester pectins (short HM vs. LM-pectins), with more or less than half of all the galacturonic acid esterified.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The non-esterified galacturonic acid units can be either free acids (carboxyl groups) or salts with sodium, potassium, or calcium. The salts of partially esterified pectins are called pectinates, if the degree of esterification is below 5 percent the salts are called pectates, the insoluble acid form, pectic acid.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Some plants, such as [[sugar beet]], [[potato]]es and [[pear]]s, contain pectins with acetylated galacturonic acid in addition to methyl esters. Acetylation prevents gel-formation but increases the stabilising and emulsifying effects of pectin.

Amidated pectin is a modified form of pectin. Here, some of the galacturonic acid is converted with [[ammonia]] to [[carboxylic acid]] [[amide]]. These pectins are more tolerant of varying calcium concentrations that occur in use.&lt;ref&gt;H.-D. Belitz, W. Grosch, P. Schieberle; Food Chemistry; Springer, Berlin; April 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

To prepare a pectin-gel, the ingredients are heated, dissolving the pectin. Upon cooling below gelling temperature, a gel starts to form. If gel formation is too strong, [[syneresis (chemistry)|syneresis]] or a granular texture are the result, while weak gelling leads to excessively soft gels. Pectins gel according to specific parameters, such as sugar, pH and bivalent salts (especially Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name = Migliori &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Migliori | first1 = M. | last2 = Gabriele | first2 = D. | last3 = Checchetti | first3 = A. | last4 = Battipede | first4 = B. | year = | title = Compatibility analysis of pectin at different esterification degree from intrinsic viscosity data of diluted ternary solutions | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1381514810001252 | journal = Reactive and Functional Polymers | volume = 70 | issue = 10| pages = 863–867 | doi = 10.1016/j.reactfunctpolym.2010.07.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In high-ester pectins at soluble solids content above 60% and a pH-value between 2.8 and 3.6, [[hydrogen bonds]] and [[hydrophobic interactions]] bind the individual pectin chains together. These bonds form as water is bound by sugar and forces pectin strands to stick together. These form a 3-dimensional molecular net that creates the macromolecular gel. The gelling-mechanism is called a low-water-activity gel or sugar-acid-pectin gel.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In low-ester pectins, ionic bridges are formed between calcium ions and the ionised carboxyl groups of the galacturonic acid. This is idealised in the  "egg box-model". Low-ester pectins need calcium to form a gel, and can do so at lower soluble solids and higher pH-values than high-ester pectins. Normally low-ester pectins form gels with a range of pH from 2.6 to 7.0 and with a soluble solids content between 10 and 70%.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Amidated pectins behave like low-ester pectins but need less calcium and are more tolerant of excess calcium. Also, gels from amidated pectin are thermo-reversible; they can be heated and after cooling solidify again, whereas conventional pectin-gels will afterwards remain liquid.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

High-ester pectins set at higher temperatures than low-ester pectins. However, gelling reactions with calcium increase as the degree of esterification falls. Similarly, lower pH-values or higher soluble solids (normally sugars) increase gelling speeds. Suitable pectins can therefore be selected for jams and jellies, or for higher-sugar confectionery jellies.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== Sources and production ==
Pears, apples, guavas, [[quince]], plums, gooseberries, and oranges and other citrus fruits contain large amounts of pectin, while soft fruits, like cherries, grapes, and strawberries, contain small amounts of pectin.

Typical levels of pectin in fresh plants are:

*apples, 1–1.5%
*[[apricot]]s, 1%
*cherries, 0.4%
*oranges, 0.5–3.5%
*[[carrot]]s 1.4%
*citrus peels, 30%

The main raw materials for pectin production are dried citrus peels or apple [[pomace]], both by-products of juice production. Pomace from sugar beets is also used to a small extent.

From these materials, pectin is extracted by adding hot dilute acid at pH-values from 1.5 – 3.5. During several hours of extraction, the protopectin loses some of its branching and chain length and goes into solution. After filtering, the extract is concentrated in a vacuum and the pectin is then [[ethanol precipitation|precipitated]] by adding ethanol or isopropanol. An old technique of precipitating pectin with aluminium salts is no longer used (apart from alcohols and polyvalent cations, pectin also precipitates with proteins and detergents).

Alcohol-precipitated pectin is then separated, washed and dried. Treating the initial pectin with dilute acid leads to low-esterified pectins. When this process includes ammonium hydroxide (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(aq)), amidated pectins are obtained. After drying and milling, pectin is usually standardised{{cfn|date=November 2017}} with sugar and sometimes calcium salts or organic acids to have optimum performance in a particular application.&lt;ref&gt;G. Eisenbrand, P. Schreier; RÖMPP Lexikon Lebensmittelchemie; Thieme, Stuttgart; Mai 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The main use for pectin (vegetable agglutinate) is as a gelling agent, thickening agent and stabilizer in food.
The classical application is giving the jelly-like consistency to jams or [[marmalade]]s, which would otherwise be sweet juices. Pectin also reduces syneresis in jams and marmalades and increases the gel strength of low-calorie jams. For household use, pectin is an ingredient in [[gelling sugar]] (also known as "jam sugar") where it is diluted to the right concentration with sugar and some citric acid to adjust pH.
In some countries, pectin is also available as a solution or an extract, or as a blended powder, for home jam making.
For conventional jams and marmalades that contain above 60% sugar and soluble fruit solids, high-ester pectins are used. With low-ester pectins and amidated pectins, less sugar is needed, so that diet products can be made.

Pectin is used in confectionery jellies to give a good gel structure, a clean bite and to confer a good flavour release. Pectin can also be used to stabilize acidic protein drinks, such as drinking yogurt, to improve the mouth-feel and the pulp stability in juice based drinks and as a [[fat substitute]] in baked goods.&lt;ref name = May &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = May | first1 = Colin D. | year = 1990 | title = Industrial pectins: Sources, production and applications | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0144861790901052 | journal = Carbohydrate Polymers | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 79–99 | doi = 10.1016/0144-8617(90)90105-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Typical levels of pectin used as a food additive are between 0.5 and 1.0% – this is about the same amount of pectin as in fresh fruit.&lt;ref name = Thakura &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thakura | first1 = B. R. | last2 = Singha | first2 = R. K. | last3 = Handab | first3 = A. .K | last4 = Raoc | first4 = M.

In medicine, pectin increases [[viscosity]] and volume of [[feces|stool]] so that it is used against [[constipation]] and [[diarrhea]]. Until 2002, it was one of the main ingredients used in [[Kaopectate]] a medication to combat diarrhea, along with [[kaolinite]]. It has been used in gentle heavy metal removal from biological systems.&lt;ref&gt;Zy Z, Liang L, Fan X, Yu Z, Hotchkiss AT, Wilk BJ, Eliaz I."The role of modified citrus pectin as an effective chelator of lead in children hospitalized with toxic lead levels", Altern Ther Health Med. 2008 Jul-Aug;14(4):34-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Pectin is also used in throat lozenges as a [[demulcent]].

In cosmetic products, pectin acts as a stabilizer. Pectin is also used in wound healing preparations and specialty medical adhesives, such as [[colostomy]] devices.

Sriamornsak&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1517/17425247.2011.584867 |author=Sriamornsak, P. |title=Application of pectin in oral drug delivery |journal=Expert Opinion on Drug Delivery |volume=8 |issue=8 |year=2011 |pages=1009–1023 |doi=10.1517/17425247.2011.584867}}&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that pectin could be used in various oral drug delivery platforms, e.g., controlled release systems, gastro-retentive systems, colon-specific delivery systems and mucoadhesive delivery systems, according to its intoxicity and low cost. It was found that pectin from different sources provides different gelling abilities, due to variations in molecular size and chemical composition. Like other natural polymers, a major problem with pectin is inconsistency in reproducibility between samples, which may result in poor reproducibility in drug delivery characteristics.

In [[ruminant]] nutrition, depending on the extent of lignification of the cell wall, pectin is up to 90% digestible by bacterial enzymes. Ruminant nutritionists recommend that the digestibility and energy concentration in forages be improved by increasing pectin concentration in the forage.

In cigars, pectin is considered an excellent substitute for vegetable glue and many cigar smokers and collectors use pectin for repairing damaged tobacco  leaves on their cigars.

Yablokov ''et al.'', writing in ''[[Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment]]'', quote research conducted by the Ukrainian Center of Radiation Medicine and the Belarusian Institute of Radiation Medicine and Endocrinology, concluded, regarding pectin's radioprotective effects, that "adding pectin preparations to the food of inhabitants of the Chernobyl-contaminated regions promotes an effective excretion of incorporated [[radionuclides]]" such as [[cesium-137]]. The authors reported on the positive results of using pectin food additive preparations in a number of clinical studies conducted on children in severely polluted areas, with up to 50% improvement over control groups.&lt;ref&gt;Yablokov, Alexey V. ''Chernobyl Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=g34tNlYOB3AC&amp;pg=PA304 pp. 304–309] {{ISBN|1573317578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War, Allied pilots were provided with [http://www.escape-maps.com/escape_maps/history_of_wwii_british_cloth_escape_maps.htm#_edn22|silk maps] printed on silk, for navigation in escape and evasion efforts. The printing process at first proved nearly impossible because the several layers of ink immediately ran, blurring outlines and rendering place names illegible until the inventor of the maps, [[Christopher Hutton|Clayton Hutton]], mixed a little pectin with the ink and at once the pectin coagulated the ink and prevented it from running, allowing small topographic features to be clearly visible.

==Legal status==
At [[the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee Report on Food Additives]] and in the [[European Union]], no numerical [[acceptable daily intake]] (ADI) has been set, as pectin is considered safe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/ipcs/food/jecfa/en/ Chemical risks in food]. Who.int. Retrieved on 2012-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], pectin is [[generally recognized as safe]] for human consumption.

In the [[International Numbering System]] (INS), pectin has the number 440. In Europe, pectins are differentiated into the [[E number]]s E440(i) for non-amidated pectins and E440(ii) for [[amide|amidated]] pectins. There are specifications in all national and international legislation defining its quality and regulating its use.

==History==
Pectin was first isolated and described in 1825 by [[Henri Braconnot]], though the action of pectin to make jams and marmalades was known long before. To obtain well-set jams from fruits that had little or only poor quality pectin, pectin-rich fruits or their extracts were mixed into the recipe.

During the [[Industrial Revolution]], the makers of fruit preserves turned to producers of apple juice to obtain dried apple [[pomace]] that was cooked to extract pectin.

Later, in the 1920s and 1930s, factories were built that commercially extracted pectin from dried apple pomace and later citrus peel in regions that produced apple juice in both the USA and Europe.

Pectin was first sold as a liquid extract, but is now most often used as dried powder, which is easier than a liquid to store and handle.

'''MDGRAPE-3''' is an ultra-high performance [[petascale]] [[supercomputer]] system developed by the [[RIKEN]] research institute in [[Japan]]. It is a special purpose system built for [[molecular dynamics]] simulations, especially [[protein structure prediction]].&lt;ref name="pop-sci-nov-2006-pg24"&gt;{{Citation | surname=Carey| given=Bjorn | title=Overachievers We Love - Faster | journal=Popular Science |volume=269 |issue=6 | year=2006 | page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MDGRAPE-3 consists of 201 units of 24 custom MDGRAPE-3 chips (4,824 total), plus additional dual-core Intel [[Xeon]] processors (codename [[Xeon#Dual-Core Xeon .2865 nm NetBurst.29|"Dempsey"]]) which serve as host machines.

In June 2006 RIKEN announced its completion,&lt;ref name=RIKEN&gt;RIKEN press release, ''[http://www.riken.jp/~/media/riken/pr/press/2006/20060619_1/20060619_1_en.pdf Completion of a one-petaflops computer system for simulation of molecular dynamics]''&lt;/ref&gt; achieving the [[petaflops|petaFLOPS]] level of [[floating point]] arithmetic performance.&lt;ref name=RIKEN/&gt; This was more than three times faster than the 2006 version of the IBM [[Blue Gene/L]] system, which then led the [[TOP500]] list of supercomputers at 0.28&amp;nbsp;petaFLOPS. Because it's not a general-purpose machine capable of running the [[LINPACK benchmarks]], MDGRAPE-3 does not qualify for the TOP500 list.

'''Salyut 2''' ('''OPS-1''') ({{lang-ru|Салют-2}} meaning ''Salute 2'') was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[space station]] which was launched in 1973 as part of the [[Salyut program]]me. It was the first [[Almaz]] military space station to fly. Within two weeks of launch the station had lost attitude control and depressurised, leaving it unusable. Its orbit decayed and it re-entered the atmosphere on 28 May 1973, without any crews having visited it.

==Spacecraft==
{{main|Almaz}}
Salyut 2 was an Almaz military space station.&lt;ref name=portree1995&gt;
{{cite web|last=Portree|first=David S. F.|title=Mir Hardware Heritage|url=http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/RP1357.pdf|publisher=NASA|date=March 1995|quote=Salyut 2, the first Almaz station, reached orbit on April 3, 1973. Soon after, Salyut 2 lost stability and began tumbling. In 1992, Mikhail Lisun, backup cosmonaut for the Soyuz 24 flight to Almaz station Salyut 5, attributed the loss of Salyut 2 to an electrical fire, followed by depressurization. Salyut 2 broke up on April 14, and all trackable pieces reentered by May 28, 1973. This was a huge discovery|accessdate=4 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5il9QixAg?url=http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/RP1357.pdf|archivedate=3 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It was designated part of the Salyut programme in order to conceal the existence of the two separate space station programmes.&lt;ref name="RSW"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zak|first=Anatoly|title=OPS-1 (Salyut-2) space station|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/almaz_ops1.html|work=RussianSpaceWeb|accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salyut 2 was {{convert|14.55|m}}{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} with a diameter of {{convert|4.15|m}}, and had an internal habitable volume of {{convert|90|m3}}. At launch it had a mass of {{convert|18950|kg}}.&lt;ref name="RSW-Almaz"/&gt; A single aft-mounted docking port was intended for use by [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] spacecraft carrying cosmonauts to work aboard the station. Two [[solar panel|solar arrays]] mounted at the aft end of the station near the docking port provided power to the station, generating a total of 3,120&amp;nbsp;watts of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zak|first=Anatoly|title=Almaz space station technical overview - Transfer section|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/almaz_po.html|work=RussianSpaceWeb|accessdate=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station was equipped with 32 attitude control thrusters, as well as two [[RD-0225]] engines, each capable of generating {{convert|3.9|kN}} of thrust, for orbital manoeuvres.&lt;ref name="RSW-Almaz"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zak|first=Anatoly|title=Almaz space station technical overview|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/almaz_ops.html|work=RussianSpaceWeb|accessdate=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch==
Salyut 2 was launched from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 81|Site 81/23]] at the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]], atop a three-stage [[Proton-K]] rocket, serial number 283-01.&lt;ref name="EA-Proton"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wade|first=Mark|title=Proton-K|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/protonk.htm|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2 January 2011|quote=1973 April 3...Launch Vehicle: Proton-K. LV Configuration: Proton-K 283-01...Salyut 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place at 09:00:00 UTC on 3 April 1973,&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|last=McDowell|first=Jonathan|title=Launch Log|url=http://www.planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|work=Jonathan's Space Page|accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and successfully placed Salyut 2 into [[low Earth orbit]].&lt;ref name="EA-Proton"/&gt; Upon reaching orbit, Salyut 2 was assigned the [[International Designator]] 1973-017A, whilst [[NORAD]] gave it the [[Satellite Catalog Number]] 06398.&lt;ref name=nasa20101008&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1973-017A|title=Salyut 2|publisher=United States National Space Data Center|date=8 October 2010|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[8S812|third stage]] of the Proton-K rocket entered orbit along with Salyut 2. On 4 April, it was catalogued in a {{convert|192|by|238|km|mi}} orbit, inclined at 51.4 degrees.&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|last=McDowell|first=Jonathan|title=Satellite Catalog|url=http://www.planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|work=Jonathan's Space Page|accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failure==
Three days after the launch of Salyut 2, the Proton's spent third stage exploded, due to pressure changes within the tanks. This explosion resulted in a cloud of debris, some of which followed a similar trajectory to the station. Ten days later this debris struck the station, damaging the hull and causing depressurization. Both solar panels were torn free, removing the ability of the station to generate power and control its attitude.&lt;ref name="RSW"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nasa20101008/&gt;

Three pieces of debris from the station were catalogued, and had [[orbital decay|decayed from orbit]] by 13 May.&lt;ref name="satcat"/&gt; The remainder of the station [[Atmospheric reentry|reentered the atmosphere]] on May 28, 1973&lt;ref name=portree1995/&gt;&lt;ref name="satcat"/&gt; over the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name="EA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wade|first=Mark|title=1973.04.03 - Salyut 2|url=http://www.astronautix.com/details/sal21518.htm|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An inquiry into the failure initially determined that a fuel line had burst, burning a hole in the station.&lt;ref name="RSW"/&gt; The damage from the debris collision was only discovered later.

'''Science and technology studies''', or '''science, technology and society''' studies (both abbreviated '''STS''') is the study of how society, politics, and culture affect [[scientific research]] and technological [[innovation]], and how these, in turn, affect [[society]], [[politics]] and [[culture]].

==History==
Like most [[interdisciplinary]] programs, STS emerged from the confluence of a variety of disciplines and disciplinary subfields, all of which had developed an interest—typically, during the 1960s or 1970s—in viewing science and technology as socially embedded enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;Bijker, W. E., Hughes, T. P., Pinch, T. and Douglas, D. G., ''The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology'', [[MIT Press]], Cambridge, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The key disciplinary components of STS took shape independently, beginning in the 1960s, and developed in isolation from each other well into the 1980s, although [[Ludwik Fleck]]'s (1935) monograph ''Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact'' anticipated many of STS's key themes.  In the 1970s [[Elting E. Morison]] founded the STS program at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), which served as a model. By 2011, 111 STS research centres and academic programs were counted worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stswiki.org/index.php?title=Worldwide_directory_of_STS_programs The STS Wiki].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key themes===

*[[History of technology]], that examines technology in its social and historical context. Starting in the 1960s, some historians questioned [[technological determinism]], a doctrine that can induce public passivity to technologic and scientific "natural" development.  At the same time, some historians began to develop similarly contextual approaches to the [[history of medicine]].
* [[History and philosophy of science]] (1960s). After the publication of [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s well-known ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), which attributed changes in scientific theories to changes in underlying intellectual [[paradigm]]s, programs were founded at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and elsewhere that brought [[historians of science]] and philosophers together in unified programs.
*[[Technology and society|Science, technology, and society]]. In the mid- to late-1960s, student and faculty social movements in the U.S., UK, and European universities helped to launch a range of new interdisciplinary fields (such as [[women's studies]]) that were seen to address relevant topics that the traditional curriculum ignored. One such development was the rise of "science, technology, and society" programs, which are also—confusingly—known by the STS acronym. Drawn from a variety of disciplines, including [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[political science]], and [[sociology]], scholars in these programs created undergraduate curricula devoted to exploring the issues raised by [[science]] and [[technology]]. Unlike scholars in [[science studies]], history of technology, or the history and philosophy of science, they were and are more likely to see themselves as activists working for change rather than dispassionate, "[[ivory tower]]" researchers{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. As an example of the activist impulse, feminist scholars in this and other emerging STS areas addressed themselves to the exclusion of [[Women in science|women]] from science and engineering.
*Science, engineering, and public [[policy studies]] emerged in the 1970s from the same concerns that motivated the founders of the science, technology, and society movement:  A sense that science and technology were developing in ways that were increasingly at odds with the public's best interests.{{According to whom|date=November 2013}} The science, technology, and society movement tried to humanize those who would make tomorrow's science and technology, but this discipline took a different approach: It would train students with the professional skills needed to become players in science and technology policy. Some programs came to emphasize quantitative methodologies, and most of these were eventually absorbed into [[systems engineering]]. Others emphasized sociological and qualitative approaches, and found that their closest kin could be found among scholars in science, technology, and society departments.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

During the 1970s and 1980s, leading universities in the US, UK, and Europe began drawing these various components together in new, interdisciplinary programs. For example, in the 1970s, Cornell University developed a new program that united science studies and policy-oriented scholars with historians and philosophers of science and technology. Each of these programs developed unique identities due to variation in the components that were drawn together, as well as their location within the various universities. For example, the University of Virginia's STS program united scholars drawn from a variety of fields (with particular strength in the history of technology); however, the program's teaching responsibilities—it is located within an engineering school and teaches ethics to undergraduate engineering students—means that all of its faculty share a strong interest in [[engineering ethics]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===The "turn to technology" (and beyond)===
{{see also|Social construction of technology}}

A decisive moment in the development of STS was the mid-1980s addition of technology studies to the range of interests reflected in science. During that decade, two works appeared ''en seriatim'' that signaled what [[Steve Woolgar]] was to call the "turn to technology": ''Social Shaping of Technology'' (MacKenzie and Wajcman, 1985) and ''The Social Construction of Technological Systems'' (Bijker, Hughes and Pinch, 1987). MacKenzie and [[Judy Wajcman|Wajcman]] primed the pump by publishing a collection of articles attesting to the influence of society on technological design. In a seminal article, [[Trevor Pinch]] and [[Wiebe Bijker]] attached all the legitimacy of the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge to this development by showing how the sociology of technology could proceed along precisely the theoretical and methodological lines established by the sociology of scientific knowledge. This was the intellectual foundation of the field they called the social construction of technology.

The "turn to technology" helped to cement an already growing awareness of underlying unity among the various emerging STS programs. More recently, there has been an associated turn to ecology, nature, and materiality in general, whereby the socio-technical and natural/material co-produce each other. This is especially evident in work in STS analyses of biomedicine (such as [[Carl May]], [[Annemarie Mol]], Nelly Oudshoorn, and Andrew Webster) and ecological interventions (such as [[Bruno Latour]], [[Sheila Jasanoff]], [[Matthias Gross]], [[S. Lochlann Jain]], and Jens Lachmund).

==Professional associations==
The subject has several professional associations.

Founded in 1975, the [[Society for Social Studies of Science]], initially provided scholarly communication facilities, including a journal (''Science, Technology, and Human Values'') and annual meetings that were mainly attended by science studies scholars. The society has since grown into the most important professional association of science and technology studies scholars worldwide. The Society for Social Studies of Science members also include government and industry officials concerned with research and development as well as science and technology policy; scientists and engineers who wish to better understand the social embeddedness of their professional practice; and citizens concerned about the impact of science and technology in their lives. Proposals have been made to add the word "technology" to the association's name, thereby reflecting its stature as the leading STS professional society, {{According to whom|but there seems to be widespread sentiment|date=November 2013}} that the name is long enough as it is.

In [[Europe]], the European Association for the Study of Science and Technology (EASST)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.easst.net/ European Association for the Study of Science and Technology].&lt;/ref&gt;  was founded in 1981 to "stimulate communication, exchange and collaboration in the field of studies of science and technology". Similarly, the [[European Inter-University Association on Society, Science and Technology]] (ESST) researches and studies science and technology in society, in both historical and contemporary perspectives.

In Asia several STS associations exist.
In [[Japan]], the Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies (JSSTS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://jssts.jp/content/section/14/51/ Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2001. The Asia Pacific Science Technology &amp; Society Network (APSTSN)&lt;ref&gt;[http://apstsn.org/ Asia Pacific Science Technology &amp; Society Network]&lt;/ref&gt; primarily has members from Australasia, Southeast and East Asia and Oceania.

In Latin America ESOCITE (Estudios Sociales de la Ciencia y la Tecnología) is the biggest association of Science and Technology studies. The study of STS (CyT in Spanish, CTS in Portuguese) here was shaped by authors like Amílcar Herrera and Jorge Sabato y Oscar Varsavsky in Argentina, José Leite Lopes in Brazil, Miguel Wionczek in Mexico, Francisco Sagasti in Peru, Máximo Halty Carrere in Uruguay and Marcel Roche in Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;Kreimer, P. (2007). Estudios sociales de la ciencia y la tecnología en América Latina: ¿para qué?, ¿ para quién? Redes, 13(26), 55–64. Retrieved from http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/907/90702603.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1958, the [[Society for the History of Technology]] initially attracted members from the history profession who had interests in the contextual history of technology. After the "turn to technology" in the mid-1980s, the society's well-regarded journal (''Technology and Culture'') and its annual meetings began to attract considerable interest from non-historians with technology studies interests.

Less identified with STS, but also of importance to many STS scholars, are the [[History of Science Society]], the [[Philosophy of Science Association]], and the American Association for the History of Medicine.

Additionally, within the US there are significant STS-oriented special interest groups within major disciplinary associations, including the [[American Anthropological Association]], the [[American Political Science Association]], the [[National Women's Studies Association]], and the [[American Sociological Association]].

==Important concepts==
=== STS social construction ===
{{Main|Social construction of technology}}

Social constructions are human created ideas, objects, or events created by a series of choices and interactions.&lt;ref name="Science Technology and Society"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodhouse|first1=Edward|title=Science Technology and Society|date=2014|publisher=University Readers|location=San Diego|page=255|edition=1st|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These interactions have consequences that change the perception that different groups of people have on these constructs. Some examples of social construction include class, race, money, and citizenship.

The following also alludes to the notion that not everything is set, a circumstance or result could potentially be one way or the other. According to the article "What is Social Construction?" by Laura Flores, "Social construction work is critical of the status quo. Social constructionists about X tend to hold that:
# X need not have existed, or need not be at all as it is. X, or X as it is at present, is not determined by the nature of things; it is not inevitable
Very often they go further, and urge that:
# X is quite as bad as it is.
# We would be much better off if X were done away with, or at least radically transformed." 
In the past, there have been viewpoints that were widely regarded as fact until being called to question due to the introduction of new knowledge. Such viewpoints include the past concept of a correlation between intelligence and the nature of a human's ethnicity or race (X may not be at all as it is).&lt;ref name="The Social Construction of What"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hacking|first1=Ian|title=The Social Construction of What?|date=1999|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard University|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts &amp; London, England|isbn=978-0674004122|page=6|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the evolution and interaction of various social constructions within science and technology can be found in the development of both the high-wheel bicycle, or [[velocipede]], and then of the [[bicycle]].  The velocipede was widely used in the latter half of the 19th century. In the latter half of the 19th century, a social need was first recognized for a more efficient and rapid means of transportation.  Consequently, the velocipede was first developed, which was able to reach higher translational velocities than the smaller non-geared bicycles of the day, by replacing the front wheel with a larger radius wheel. One notable trade-off was a certain decreased stability leading to a greater risk of falling. This trade-off resulted in many riders getting into accidents by losing balance while riding the bicycle or being thrown over the handle bars.

The first "social construction" or progress of the velocipede caused the need for a newer "social construction" to be recognized and developed into a safer bicycle design.  Consequently, the velocipede was then developed into what is now commonly known as the "[[bicycle]]" to fit within society's newer "social construction," the newer standards of higher vehicle safety. Thus the popularity of the modern geared bicycle design came as a response to the first social construction, the original need for greater speed, which had caused the high-wheel bicycle to be designed in the first place.  The popularity of the modern geared bicycle design ultimately ended the widespread use of the velocipede itself, as eventually it was found to best accomplish the social-needs/ social-constructions of both greater speed and of greater safety.&lt;ref name="MIT Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bijker,|first1=Wiebe|title=The Social Construction of Technological System|date=1993|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-52137-7|pages=28–45|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technoscience ===
{{Main|Technoscience}}

Technoscience is a subset of Science, Technology, and Society studies that focuses on the inseparable connection between science and technology. It states that fields are linked and grow together, and scientific knowledge requires an infrastructure of technology in order to remain stationary or move forward. Both technological development and scientific discovery drive one another towards more advancement. Technoscience excels at shaping human thought and behavior by opening up new possibilities that gradually or quickly come to be perceived as necessities.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Lukes, Power: A Radical View (London: Macmillan, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

"Technological action is a social process."&lt;ref name = "Goldman, 1992"&gt;Goldman, S. (1992). No Innovation Without Representation (pp. 148-160). Troy, New York: Rensselaer.&lt;/ref&gt; Social factors and technology are intertwined so that they are dependent upon each other. This includes the aspect that social, political, and economic factors are inherent in technology and that social structure influences what technologies are pursued. In other words, "technoscientific phenomena combined inextricably with social/political/ economic/psychological phenomena, so 'technology' includes a spectrum of artifacts, techniques, organizations, and systems."&lt;ref name = "Woodhouse, 2013"&gt;Woodhouse, E. (2013). In The Future of Technological Civilization (Revised ed., pp. 1-258).&lt;/ref&gt; Winner expands on this idea by saying "in the late twentieth century technology and society, technology and culture, technology and politics are by no means separate."&lt;ref name = "Winner, 1993"&gt;Winner, L.

====Examples====
* Ford Pinto&lt;ref name = "Dowie, 1997"&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/1977/09/pinto-madness?page=2 Dowie, M. (1977, October 1). Pinto Madness. Retrieved February 4, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; – Ford Motor Company sold and produced the Pinto during the 1970s. A flaw in the automobile design of the rear gas tank caused a fiery explosion upon impact. The exploding fuel tank killed and injured hundreds of people. Internal documents of test results, proved Ford CEO Lee Iacocca and engineers were aware of the flaw. The company decided to ignore improving their technology because of profit-driven motives, strict internal control, and competition from foreign competitors such as Volkswagen. Ford Motor Company conducted a cost-benefit analysis to determine if altering the Ford Pinto model was feasible. An analysis conducted by Ford employees argued against a new design because of increased cost. Employees were also under tight control by the CEO who rushed the Pinto through production lines to increase profits. Ford finally changed after public scrutiny. Safety organizations later influenced this technology by requiring stricter safety standards for motor vehicles.
* DDT/toxins&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – DDT was a common and highly effective insecticide used during the 1940s until its ban in the early 1970s. It was utilized during World War 2 to combat insect-borne human disease that plagued military members and civilian populations. People and companies soon realized other benefits of DDT for agricultural purposes. Rachel Carson became worried of wide spread use on public health and the environment. Rachel Carson's book ''Silent Spring'' left an imprint on the industry by claiming linkage of DDT to many serious illness such as cancer. Carson's book drew criticism from chemical companies who felt their reputation and business threatened by such claims.. DDT was eventually banned by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) after a long and arduous process of research on the chemical substance. The main cause for the removal of DDT was the public deciding that any benefits outweighed the potential health risk.
* Autopilots/computer aided tasks (CATs)&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – From a security point of view the effects of making a task more computer driven is in the favor of technological advance because there is less reaction time required and computational error than a human pilot. Due to reduced error and reaction times flights on average, using autopilot, have been shown to be safer. Thus the technology has a direct impact on people by increasing their safety, and society affects the technology because people want to be safer so they are constantly trying to improve the autopilot systems.
* Cell phones&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – Cell phone technology emerged in the early 1920s after advancements were made in radio technology. Engineers at Bell Laboratories, the research and development division of AT&amp;T discovered that cell towers can transmit and receive signals to and from many directions. The discovery by Bell Labs revolutionized the capabilities and outcomes of cellular technology. Technology only improved once mobile phone users could communicate outside of a designated area. First generation mobile phones were first created and sold by Motorola. Their phone was only intended for use in cars. Second generation mobile phone capabilities continued to improve because of the switch to digital. Phones were faster which enhanced communication capabilities of customers. They were also sleeker and weighed less than bulky first generation technology. Technologically advances boosted customer satisfaction and broadened cell phone companies customer base. Third generation technology changed the way people interact with other. Now customers had access to wifi, texting and other applications. Mobile phones are now entering into the fourth generations.  Cellular and mobile phones revolutionized the way people socialize and communicate in order to establish modern social structure. People have affected the development of this technology by demanding features such as larger screens, touch capabilities, and internet accessibility.
* Internet&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; –  The internet arose because of extensive research on ARPANET between various university, corporations, and ARPA (Advanced Research Project Agency), an agency of the Department of Defense. Scientist theorized a network of computers connected to each other. Computing capabilities contributed to developments and the creation of the modern day computer or laptop. The internet has become a normal part of life and business, to such a degree that the United Nations views it as a basic human right. The internet is becoming larger, one way is that more things are being moved into the digital world due to demand, for example online banking. It has drastically changed the way most people go about daily habits.

===Deliberative democracy===
[[Deliberative democracy]] is a reform of [[representative democracy|representative]] or [[direct democracy|direct]] democracies which mandates discussion and debate of popular topics which affect society.  Deliberative Democracy is a tool for making decisions.  Deliberative democracy can be traced back all the way to [[Aristotle’s writings]]. More recently, the term was coined by Joseph Bessette in his 1980 work ''Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government'', where he uses the idea in opposition to the elitist interpretations of the [[United States Constitution]] with emphasis on public discussion.&lt;ref name="Bohman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bohman|first1=James|title=The Coming of Age of Deliberative Democracy|journal=[[The Journal of Political Philosophy]]|date=1998|volume=6|issue=4|pages=400–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deliberative Democracy can lead to more legitimate, credible, and trustworthy outcomes.  Deliberative Democracy allows for "a wider range of public knowledge," and it has been argued that this can lead to "more socially intelligent and robust" science. One major shortcoming of deliberative democracy is that many models insufficiently ensure critical interaction.&lt;ref name="Chilvers"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chilvers|first1=Jason|title=Deliberating Competence, Theoretical and Practitioners Perspectives on Effective Participatory Appraisal Practice|journal=[[Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values]]|date=March 2008|volume=33|issue=2|url=http://sth.sagepub.com|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ryfe, there are five mechanisms that stand out as critical to the successful design of deliberative democracy:
*Rules of equality, civility, and inclusivity may prompt deliberation even when our first impulse is to avoid it.
*Stories anchor reality by organizing experience and instilling a normative commitment to civic identities and values, and function as a medium for framing discussions.
*Leadership provides important cues to individuals in deliberative settings, and can keep groups on a deliberative track when their members slip into routine and habit.
*Individuals are more likely to sustain deliberative reasoning when they have a stake in the outcomes.
*Apprenticeship teaches citizens to deliberate well. We might do well to imagine education as a form of apprenticeship learning, in which individuals learn to deliberate by doing it in concert with others more skilled in the activity.&lt;ref name="Ryfe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryfe|first1=David M.|title=Does Deliberative Democracy Work?|journal=[[Annual Review of Political Science]]|date=March 4, 2005|volume=8|pages=63–64|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.8.032904.154633 |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.polisci.8.032904.154633|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Importance of deliberative democracy in STS====
Recently,{{when|date=January 2018}} there has been a movement towards greater transparency in the fields of policy and technology. Jasanoff comes to the conclusion that there is no longer a question of if there needs to be increased public participation in making decisions about science and technology, but now there needs to be ways to make a more meaningful conversation between the public and those developing the technology.&lt;ref name="Jasanoff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jasanoff|first1=Sheila|title=Technologies of Humility: Citizen Participation in Governing Science|journal=Minerva|date=2003|volume=41|issue=3|pages=223–244 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1025557512320|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deliberative democracy in practice====
Ackerman and Fishkin offer an example of a reform in their paper "Deliberation Day." The deliberation is to enhance public understanding of popular, complex, and controversial issues, through devices such as Fishkin’s Deliberative Polling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ackerman|first1=Bruce|last2=Fishkin|first2=James S.|title=Deliberation Day|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/media/news/2004/03/10/586/deliberation-day/|website=Center for American Progress|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although implementation of these reforms is unlikely in a large government situation such as the United States Federal Government. However, things similar to this have been implemented in small, local, governments like New England towns and villages. New England town hall meetings are a good example of deliberative democracy in a realistic setting.&lt;ref name="Bohman"/&gt;

An ideal Deliberative Democracy balances the voice and influence of all participants. While the main aim is to reach consensus, a deliberative democracy should encourage the voices of those with opposing viewpoints, concerns due to uncertainties, and questions about assumptions made by other participants. It should take its time and ensure that those participating understand the topics on which they debate. Independent managers of debates should also have substantial grasp of the concepts discussed, but must "[remain] independent and impartial as to the outcomes of the process."&lt;ref name="Chilvers"/&gt;

===Tragedy of the commons===
{{see also|Tragedy of the commons}}

In 1968, [[Garrett Hardin]] popularised the phrase "tragedy of the commons." It is an economic theory where rational people act against the best interest of the group by consuming a common resource. Since then, the tragedy of the commons has been used to symbolize the degradation of the environment whenever many individuals use a common resource. Although Garrett Hardin was not an STS scholar, the concept of tragedy of the commons still applies to science, technology and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardin|first1=Garrett|title=The Tragedy of the Commons|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/site/feature/misc/webfeat/sotp/pdfs/162-3859-1243.pdf|website=www.sciencemag.org|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a contemporary setting, the Internet acts as an example of the tragedy of the commons through the exploitation of digital resources and private information. Data and internet passwords can be stolen much more easily than physical documents. Virtual spying is almost free compared to the costs of physical spying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davidow|first1=Bill|title=The Tragedy of the Internet Commons|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/05/the-tragedy-of-the-internet-commons/257290/#disqus_thread|website=theatlantic.com|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[net neutrality]] can be seen as an example of tragedy of the commons in an STS context. The movement for net neutrality argues that the Internet should not be a resource that is dominated by one particular group, specifically those with more money to spend on Internet access.

A counterexample to the tragedy of the commons is offered by Andrew Kahrl. Privatization can be a way to deal with the tragedy of the commons. However, Kahrl suggests that the privatization of beaches on [[Long Island]], in an attempt to combat overuse of Long Island beaches, made the residents of Long Island more susceptible to flood damage from [[Hurricane Sandy]]. The privatization of these beaches took away from the protection offered by the natural landscape. Tidal lands that offer natural protection were drained and developed. This attempt to combat the tragedy of the commons by privatization was counter-productive. Privatization actually destroyed the public good of natural protection from the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kahn|first1=Matthew E.|title=Environmental and Urban Economics|url=http://greeneconomics.blogspot.com/2012/12/a-counter-example-to-tragedy-of-commons.html|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative modernity===
Alternative [[modernity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eisenstadt|first1=Shmuel|title=Multiple Modernities|journal=Dædalus|date=Winter 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feenberg|first1=Andrew|title=Alternative Modernity : The Technical Turn in Philosophy and Social Theory|date=1995|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520089860}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a conceptual tool conventionally used to represent the state of present western society. Modernity represents the political and social structures of the society, the sum of interpersonal discourse, and ultimately a snapshot of society's direction at a point in time. Unfortunately conventional modernity is incapable of modeling alternative directions for further growth within our society. Also, this concept is ineffective at analyzing similar but unique modern societies such as those found in the diverse cultures of the developing world. Problems can be summarized into two elements: inward failure to analyze growth potentials of a given society, and outward failure to model different cultures and social structures and predict their growth potentials.

Previously, modernity carried a connotation of the current state of being modern, and its evolution through European colonialism. The process of becoming "modern" is believed to occur in a linear, pre-determined way, and is seen by Philip Brey as a way of to interpret and evaluate social and cultural formations. This thought ties in with [[modernization theory]], the thought that societies progress from "pre-modern" to "modern" societies.

Within the field of science and technology, there are two main lenses with which to view modernity. The first is as a way for society to quantify what it wants to move towards. In effect, we can discuss the notion of "alternative modernity" (as described by Andrew Feenberg) and which of these we would like to move towards. Alternatively, modernity can be used to analyze the differences in interactions between cultures and individuals. From this perspective, alternative modernities exist simultaneously, based on differing cultural and societal expectations of how a society (or an individual within society) should function. Because of different types of interactions across different cultures, each culture will have a different modernity.

===Pace of innovation===
{{See also|Pace of innovation}}

Pace of Innovation is the speed at which technological innovation or advancement is occurring, with the most apparent instances being too slow or too rapid. Both these rates of innovation are extreme and therefore have effects on the people that get to use this technology.

===No innovation without representation===
{{POV section|date=August 2016}}
{{main|No innovation without representation}}

"No innovation without representation" is a democratic ideal of ensuring that everyone involved gets a chance to be represented fairly in technological developments.

* [[Langdon Winner]] states that groups and social interests likely to be affected by a particular kind of technological change ought to be represented at an early stage in defining exactly what that technology will be. It is the idea that relevant parties have a say in technological developments and are not left in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;Winner, Langdon. "Artifact/Ideas and Political Culture." Technology and the Future (1993): 283-92. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spoken about by [[Massimiano Bucchi]]&lt;ref&gt;Bucchi, Massimiano. "No Innovation without Representation (A Parliament of Things for the New Technical Democracies)." http://www.fondazionebassetti.org/. 20 Dec. 2003. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* This ideal does not require the public to become experts on the topics of science and engineering, it only asks that the opinions and ideas be heard before making drastic decisions, as talked about by [[Steven L. Goldman]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Steven L. "No Innovation Without Representation: Technological Action in a Democratic Society." New Worlds, New Technologies, New Issues (1992): 148-60. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privileged positions of business and science===
{{POV section|date=August 2016}}
{{Main|Privileged positions of business and science}}

The privileged positions of business and science refer to the unique authority that persons in these areas hold in economic, political, and technosocial affairs. Businesses have strong decision-making abilities in the function of society, essentially choosing what technological innovations to develop. Scientists and technologists have valuable knowledge, ability to pursue the technological innovations they want. They proceed largely without public scrutiny and as if they had the consent of those potentially affected by their discoveries and creations.

===Legacy thinking===

Legacy thinking is defined as an inherited method of thinking imposed from an external source without objection by the individual, because it is already widely accepted by society.

Legacy thinking can impair the ability to drive technology for the betterment of society by blinding people to innovations that do not fit into their accepted model of how society works.  By accepting ideas without questioning them, people often see all solutions that contradict these accepted ideas as impossible or impractical.  Legacy thinking tends to advantage the wealthy, who have the means to project their ideas on the public.  It may be used by the wealthy as a vehicle to drive technology in their favor rather than for the greater good.
Examining the role of citizen participation and representation in politics provides an excellent example of legacy thinking in society. The belief that one can spend money freely to gain influence has been popularized, leading to public acceptance of corporate [[lobbying]]. As a result, a self-established role in politics has been cemented where the public does not exercise the power ensured to them by the Constitution to the fullest extent. This can become a barrier to political progress as corporations who have the capital to spend have the potential to wield great influence over policy.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, Bill, and Sarah Harkins. "Fixed Fortunes: Biggest Corporate Political Interests Spend Billions, Get Trillions." Sunlight Foundation Blog. Sunlight Foundation, 17 Nov. 2014. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy thinking however keeps the population from acting to change this, despite polls from Harris Interactive that report over 80% of Americans feel that big business holds too much power in government.&lt;ref&gt;Corso, Regina, SVP. "PACs, Big Companies, Lobbyists, and Banks and Financial Institutions Seen by Strong Majorities as Having Too Much Power and Influence in DC." Harris Interactive: Harris Polls. Harris Interactive, 29 May 2012. Web. 21 Apr. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Americans are beginning to try to steer away this line of thought, rejecting legacy thinking, and demanding less corporate, and more public, participation in political decision making.

Additionally, an examination of [[net neutrality]] functions as a separate example of legacy thinking. Starting with [[dial-up]], the internet has always been viewed as a private luxury good.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Internet today is a vital part of modern-day society members. They use it in and out of life every day.&lt;ref name="Net Neutrality 2015"&gt;"Net Neutrality: A Free and Open Internet." The White House. The White House, 26 Feb. 2015. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations are able to mislabel and greatly overcharge for their internet resources. Since the American public is so dependent upon internet there is little for them to do. Legacy thinking has kept this pattern on track despite growing movements arguing that the internet should be considered a &lt;!--which kind? - human right/..?--&gt;utility. Legacy thinking prevents progress because it was widely accepted by others before us through advertising that the internet is a luxury and not a &lt;!--basic?--&gt;utility. Due to pressure from grassroots movements the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has redefined the requirements for broadband and internet in general as a utility.&lt;ref name="Net Neutrality 2015"/&gt; Now AT&amp;T and other major internet providers are lobbying against this action and are in-large able to delay the onset of this movement due to legacy thinking’s grip on American&lt;!--this article &amp; legacy thinking relates to the global population not just the American--&gt; culture and politics.

For example, those who cannot overcome the barrier of legacy thinking may not consider the [[water privatization|privatization of clean drinking water]] as an issue.&lt;ref&gt;Flow. Oscilloscope Pictures, 2008. DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; This is partially because access to water has become such a given fact of the matter to them. For a person living in such circumstances, it may be widely accepted to not concern themselves with drinking water because they have not needed to be concerned with it in the past. Additionally, a person living within an area that does not need to worry about their water supply or the sanitation of their water supply is less likely to be concerned with the privatization of water.

This notion can be examined through the thought experiment of "[[veil of ignorance]]".&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse, Edward. Science Technology and Society. Spring 2015 ed. N.p.: U Readers, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy thinking causes people to be particularly ignorant about the implications behind the "you get what you pay for" mentality applied to a life necessity. By utilizing the "veil of ignorance", one can overcome the barrier of legacy thinking as it requires a person to imagine that they are unaware of their own circumstances, allowing them to free themselves from externally imposed thoughts or widely accepted ideas.

'''V-weapons''', known in original German as '''''Vergeltungswaffen''''' ({{IPA-de|fɐˈgɛltʊŋsˌvafṇ}}, German: "retaliatory weapons", "reprisal weapons"), were a particular set of long-range artillery weapons designed for [[strategic bombing during World War II]], particularly [[Strategic bombing#Terror bombing|terror bombing]] and/or [[Aerial bombing of cities#European theatre|aerial bombing of cities]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Basil Collier]] (1976) ''The Battle of the V-Weapons''. Morley, The Elmfield Press. p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=V-WEAPONS (CROSSBOW) CAMPAIGN|url=http://www.allworldwars.com/V-Weapons%20Crossbow%20Campaign.html|work=All World Wars|accessdate=2008-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; They comprised the [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]], a [[pulsejet]]-powered [[cruise missile]], the [[V-2 rocket|V-2]], a [[Liquid-propellant rocket|liquid-fuelled]] [[ballistic missile]] (often referred to as V1 and V2), and the [[V-3 cannon]]. All of these weapons were intended for use in a military campaign against Britain, though only the V-1 and V-2 were so used in a campaign conducted 1944–5. After the invasion of Europe by the Allies, these weapons were also employed against targets on the mainland of Europe, mainly France and Belgium. The V-terror bombing killed approximately 18,000 people, mostly civilians. The cities London, Antwerp and Liège were the main targets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pieter Serrien]] (2016) ''Elke dag angst''. Antwerp, Horizon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the V-terror in Belgium|url=https://pieterserrien.be/english/the-terror-of-the-v1-and-v2-in-belgium/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were part of the range of the so-called [[Wunderwaffe]]n ({{lang-en |[[superweapon]]s}} or 'wonderweapons') of [[Nazi Germany]].

==Development==
As early as 28 June 1940, a terror bombing rationale had been advanced for the [[Aggregate series#A4 (V-2 rocket)|A4 (V-2 rocket)]] being developed at a meeting between Army Ordnance Chief [[Emil Leeb]] and Commander-in-Chief of the Wehrmacht, [[Walther von Brauchitsch]].&lt;ref name=Neufeld&gt;{{cite book|last=Neufeld|first=Michael J|title=The Rocket and the Reich: Peenemünde and the Coming of the Ballistic Missile Era|year=1995|publisher=The Free Press|location=New York|language= |isbn=0-02-922895-6|pages=137, 237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the relative failure of the [[Baedeker Raids]] on Britain in 1942, development of both flying bomb and rocket accelerated, with Britain designated as the target.&lt;ref name="Basil Collier 1976"&gt;Basil Collier (1976) ''The Battle of the V-Weapons''. Morley, The Elmfield Press: 15-16&lt;/ref&gt; On September 29, 1943, [[Albert Speer]] publicly promised retribution against the mass bombing of German cities by a "secret weapon".&lt;ref name=Henshall&gt;{{cite book|last=Henshall|first=Philip|title=Hitler's Rocket Sites|year=1985|publisher=St Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn= |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then the official 24 June 1944 [[Propagandaministerium|Reich Propaganda Ministry]] announcement of the "[[V-1 flying bomb|Vergeltungswaffe 1]]" [[guided missile]] implied there would be another such weapon.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=David|title=V-1, V-2: Hitler's Vengeance on London|year=1982|publisher=Stein and Day|isbn=0-8128-2858-5|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the first operational A-4 launch in September 1944, the rocket was renamed the [[V-2]].&lt;ref name=Irving&gt;{{cite book|last=Irving|first=David|authorlink=David Irving|title=The Mare's Nest|year=1964|publisher=William Kimber and Co|location=London|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although no one knows exactly who gave it this name).&lt;ref name=Klee&gt;{{cite book|last=Klee|first=Ernst|author2=Merk, Otto |title=The Birth of the Missile:The Secrets of Peenemünde|origyear=1963|year=001965|publisher=Gerhard Stalling Verlag|location=Hamburg|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the V-2 operations manual distributed to [[Meillerwagen|firing batteries]] continued to use the A-4 name for the rocket.&lt;ref name=McGovern&gt;{{cite book|last=McGovern|first=J|title=Crossbow and Overcast|year=1964|publisher=W.

==V-weapons offensive on Britain 1944–45==

===The V-1===
{{main|V-1 flying bomb}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1973-029A-24A, Marschflugkörper V1 vor Start.jpg|thumb|A V-1 is rolled out]]
Beginning in October 1943, launch sites for the V-1 were constructed in Northern France, along the coast from [[Calais]] to [[Le Havre]]. Aerial bombing attacks on these sites by the Allied airforce were only partially successful and by June 1944 they were ready for action.&lt;ref&gt;Basil Collier (1976) ''The Battle of the V-Weapons''. Morley, The Elmfield Press: 160-3&lt;/ref&gt; Prompted by the [[Normandy Landings]] of June 6, in the early morning of June 13, 1944, the first V-1 flying bomb attack was carried out on London.&lt;ref name="Basil Collier 1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Angus Calder 1971"&gt;Angus Calder (1971) ''The People's War: Britain 1939-1945'': 645&lt;/ref&gt; Ten missiles were launched of which four reached England. The first of these impacted near [[Swanscombe]], causing no casualties. At [[Bethnal Green]], however, a bridge was destroyed and six people killed and nine injured.&lt;ref&gt;Basil Collier (1976) ''The Battle of the V-Weapons''. Morley, The Elmfield Press: 74-5&lt;/ref&gt; After the 15th the attacks became sustained at a rate of about 100 a day.&lt;ref name="Angus Calder 1971"/&gt; With the first attack the British put their pre-planned [[Operation Diver]] (after their codename "Diver" used for the V-1) into action.

The buzzing sound of the V-1's [[pulse jet engine]] was likened by some to "a motor cycle in bad running order". As it reached its target and dived, the sound of the propulsion unit spluttering and cutting out, followed by an eerie hush before impact, was quite terrifying, though the silence was also a warning to seek shelter (later V-1s were corrected to have the originally-intended power dive).&lt;ref&gt;Basil Collier (1976) ''The Battle of the V-Weapons''. Morley, The Elmfield Press: 80&lt;/ref&gt;  At least one business in London advertised how quickly a patron could access a nearby shelter. Despite this, the cloudy and rainy conditions of June and July aided the effectiveness of the weapon and casualties were high. By late August a million and a half people had left London and the rate of work production was affected.&lt;ref&gt;Basil Collier (1976) ''The Battle of the V-Weapons''. Morley, The Elmfield Press: 11-12, 80-1, 125&lt;/ref&gt; By the late summer and autumn, however, increasingly effective [[V1 flying bomb#Countermeasures in England|countermeasures against the V-1]] were taken and people started returning to London.&lt;ref&gt;Angus Calder (1971) The People's War: Britain 1939-1945: 646-7&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 9,251 V-1s were fired at targets in Britain, with the vast majority aimed at London; 2,515 reached the city, killing 6,184 civilians and injuring 17,981. [[Croydon]] to the south, on the flight path of the V1s suffered severely taking 142 hits.&lt;ref&gt;Angus Calder (1971) The People's War: Britain 1939-1945: 647&lt;/ref&gt;

===The V-2===
{{main|V-2 rocket}}
[[File:London V2 Frissell2.jpg|right|thumb|The aftermath of [[V-2]] strike at [[Battersea]], London (27 January 1945)]]
V-2 rocket launching sites were set up by the Germans around [[The Hague]] in the Netherlands on 6 September 1944. The first was launched from here against London on 8 September 1944 and took an estimated 5 minutes to fly the 200 miles from the Hague to London where it struck at 6.43pm on 8 September on [[Chiswick]] causing thirteen casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Basil Collier (1976) ''The Battle of the V-Weapons''. Morley, The Elmfield Press: 113, 170&lt;/ref&gt; As the V2 explosions came without warning, the government initially attempted to conceal their cause by blaming them on defective [[Coal gas|gas]] mains. However, the public was not fooled and soon began sardonically referring to the V-2's as "Flying gas pipes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Impact: The History Of Germany's V Weapons in World War II|publisher=De Capo Press|author=King, Benjamin|year=2009|pages=244|isbn=0786751673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By October the offensive became sustained. A particularly devastating strike was on 25 November 1944 when a V-2 exploded at the [[Woolworths Group|Woolworth's]] store in New Cross Road, killing 168 people and seriously injuring 121.&lt;ref&gt;Basil Collier (1976) ''The Battle of the V-Weapons''. Morley, The Elmfield Press: 129&lt;/ref&gt; Intercepting the supersonic V-2 missiles in flight proved virtually impossible and other counter measures, such as bombing the launch sites, were fairly ineffectual. Sustained bombardment continued until March 1945. The very last missiles arrived on 27 March 1945, with one of them killing 134 people and injuring 49 when it hit a block of flats in [[Stepney]].&lt;ref&gt;Basil Collier (1976) ''The Battle of the V-Weapons''. Morley, The Elmfield Press: 135&lt;/ref&gt;

1,115 V-2s were fired at the United Kingdom. The vast majority of them were aimed at London, though about 40 targeted (and missed) [[Norwich]]. They killed an estimated 2,754 people in London with another 6,523 injured. A further 2,917 service personnel were killed as a result of the V weapon campaign. Since the V-2 was supersonic and could not be heard (and was rarely seen) as it approached the target, its psychological effect "suffered in comparison to the V-1''.''"&lt;ref name=Wade&gt;{{cite web|last=Wade|first=Mark|title=V-2|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/v2.htm|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|publisher= |accessdate=2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The V-weapon offensive ended in March 1945, with the last V-2 landing in Kent on March 27 and the last V-1 two days later. In terms of casualties their effects had been less than their inventors hoped or their victims feared, though the damage to property was extensive, with 20,000 houses a day being damaged at the height of the campaign, causing a massive housing crisis in south-east England in late 1944 and early 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Angus Calder (1971) The People's War: Britain 1939-1945: 646-50&lt;/ref&gt;

The existential horror of the V-2 attack on London is the theme of [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s novel ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomaspynchon.com/gravitys-rainbow/reviews.html Review of Gravity's Rainbow]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The V-3===
The [[V-3 cannon]], also designed to fire on London, was never used for this purpose due to Allied attacks on the launch facilities, specially the [[fortress of Mimoyecques]], and the offensive in northern Europe in 1944, overrunning the launch sites. Consequently, its use was diverted, in the winter of 1944, to bombard [[Luxembourg]], with minimal results.&lt;ref&gt;Max Hastings (2004) ''Armageddon: The Battle for Germany 1944-5'': 196&lt;/ref&gt;{{For|use of the letter V to designate experimental ({{lang-de|Versuchsmuster}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hinsley|first=FH|title=British Intelligence in the Second World War|year=1993|publisher=[[HMSO]]|location=London|isbn=0-11-630956-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[V-2]] rockets|List of V-2 test launches}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1881">'''William Cary''' (1759–16 November 1825) was an English scientific-instrument maker. Trained under [[Jesse Ramsden]], he produced numerous scientific instruments including mechanical calculators, measuring instruments, telescopes, microscopes, navigation and survey equipment.

William Cary was born to George and Mary Cary. He had three brothers, the eldest George (ca. 1753-1830) was a haberdasher while the second brother John, was a mapmaker who also worked with William and the last, Francis (ca. 1756-1836) was an engraver. Cary learnt the skills for producing instruments as an apprentice of [[Jesse Ramsden]] (1735-1800).

The instruments made by William Cary were used around the world including Russia and India. He also made instruments for the English chemist [[William Hyde Wollaston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal= Platinum Metals Rev.|year= 1979| volume= 23| issue=3| pages= 112–123 |title=William Cary arid His Association with William Hyde Wollaston.
