The '''1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre'''  occurred on January 22 of that year, in the western [[Departments of El Salvador|departments]] of [[El Salvador]] when a brief [[peasant]]-led [[rebellion]] was suppressed by the [[Politics of El Salvador|government]], then led by [[Maximiliano Hernández Martínez]]. The Salvadoran army, being vastly superior in terms of weapons and soldiers, executed those who stood against it. The rebellion was a mixture of protest and [[insurrection]] which ended in [[ethnocide]],&lt;ref name="payes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Payés|first=Txanba|url=http://www.loquesomos.org/lacalle/tuopinion/Lainsurreciondeunpueblooprimido.htm|title= El Salvador.

==Background==

Social unrest in [[El Salvador]] had begun to grow in the 1920s, primarily because of the perceived abuses of the [[social class|political class]], and the broad [[social inequality]] between the [[landowner]]s and the [[peasant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.monografias.com/trabajos41/el-salvador/el-salvador.shtml#caracter|title= El Salvador en los años 1920–1932|accessdate=September 14, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080915015116/http://www.monografias.com/trabajos41/el-salvador/el-salvador.shtml| archivedate=September 15, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Army"&gt;{{cite web|author=Armed Forces of El Salvador|author-link=Armed Forces of El Salvador|url= http://www.faes.gob.sv/MdnCCp/heroes-batallas/revolucion-1932.htm|title= Revolución 1932|accessdate=September 14, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080619010925/http://www.faes.gob.sv/MdnCCp/heroes-batallas/revolucion-1932.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = June 19, 2008|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; A U.S. Army officer stated in 1931 that, "there appears to be nothing between these high-priced cars, and the oxcart with its barefoot attendant. There is practically no-middle class."&lt;ref name="LaFeber1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=LaFeber|first=Walter|title=Inevitable Revolutions: The United States in Central America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RqMp5TsWCqkC&amp;pg=PA73|year=1993|publisher=W.W. Norton|isbn=978-0-393-30964-5|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The policies of the [[latifundia]] had left 90 percent of the country's land in the hands of 14 families, 'los catorce', who used the land for the cultivation of the [[cash-crop]] coffee.&lt;ref&gt;[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]] Conflict Encyclopedia, El Salvador, In Depth, Negotiating a settlement to the conflict, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=51&amp;regionSelect=4-Central_Americas#, viewed on May 24, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The Salvadoran economy had largely depended on the coffee bean during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, so much so that this period is known as the "Coffee Republic" era. The national coffee-growing industry had grown with the accumulation of riches of a small group of landowners and [[merchant]]s&lt;ref name="Army" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moreno|first=Israel|date=December 1997|title=El Salvador: Un paisito en peligro de extinción|issue=189|journal=[[Envío|Revista Envío]]|publisher=[[Universidad Centroamericana]]|url=http://www.envio.org.ni/articulo/336|accessdate=September 14, 2008|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had purchased large portions of land and employed a great number of peasants, many of whom were [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=de La Rosa Municio|first=Juan Luis|title=El Salvador: Memoria histórica y organización indígena|url=http://www.nodo50.org/foroporlamemoria/documentos/2006/elsalvador_gen2006.htm|date=January 2006|accessdate=September 14, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081008032635/http://www.nodo50.org/foroporlamemoria/documentos/2006/elsalvador_gen2006.htm| archivedate=October 8, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working conditions at the haciendas were very poor. By 1930, pay consisted of two [[tortilla]]s and two spoonfuls of [[bean]]s at the beginning and end of each day.&lt;ref name="martinez"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diariocolatino.com/trazocultural/detalles.asp?NewsID=97 |title=Las venas abiertas de los indígenas en El Salvador |last=Martínez |first=Néstor |date=January 13, 2007 |website=[[Diario Co Latino]] |access-date=April 22, 2007 |archiveurl=https://archive.li/20071011200823/http://www.diariocolatino.com/es/20070113/trazocultural/trazocultural_20070113_97/ |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |language=es |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, workers were paid in [[scrip]] which could only be redeemed at stores controlled by the plantation owners. This led to local monopolies which drove up the price of food. It is estimated that food costs for laborers were no more than $0.01 per day,&lt;ref name="martinez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="universidaddeelsalvador"&gt;{{cite book| title = Causas y efectos de la Insurrección Campesina de enero de 1932| year = 1995| location = San Salvador| publisher = [[University of El Salvador]]| language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating considerable profits for plantation owners.

[[Image:Planta de café de Cuetzalan.JPG|thumb|left|[[Coffee bean]]s were the main produce of El Salvador]]

In 1932, the head of a U.S. delegation in [[San Salvador]], W.J. McCafferty, wrote a letter to his government explaining the Salvadoran situation, stating that farm animals were worth more than workers as they were in high demand and had better commercial value.&lt;ref name="martinez" /&gt;

The global economic situation caused by the [[Great Depression]] fostered the lack of opportunities in countries such as El Salvador.&lt;ref name="delarosa"&gt;{{cite web|last=de La Rosa Municio|first=Juan Luis|title=El Salvador: Memoria histórica y organización indígena|url=http://www.nodo50.org/foroporlamemoria/documentos/2006/elsalvador_gen2006.htm|date=January 2006|accessdate=April 22, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081008032635/http://www.nodo50.org/foroporlamemoria/documentos/2006/elsalvador_gen2006.htm| archivedate=October 8, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the drop in coffee prices, several [[hacienda]]s were closed and many peasants lost their jobs, creating deep economic turmoil.&lt;ref name="ministerio"&gt;{{Cite book

The policies of presidents [[Pío Romero Bosque]] and [[Arturo Araujo]] had stripped almost all land from the local peasants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.preseleccion.com:80/el_salvador/historia.htm |title=Historia de El Salvador |publisher=Preselección Empresarial |access-date=April 22, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917140016/http://www.preseleccion.com/el_salvador/historia.htm |archivedate=September 17, 2009 |deadurl=yes |language=es |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This area was heavily populated by the indigenous [[Pipil people|Pipils]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.suchitoto-el-salvador.com/historia.htm |title=Historia de Suchitoto |publisher=Oficina Municipal de Turismo de Suchitoto |access-date=April 22, 2007 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indigenous people, separated from the scarce economic progress, sought help from their own leaders. Although the law did not grant any powers or official recognition of the [[cacique]]s, the natives respected and obeyed their authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diariocolatino.com:80/tresmil/detalles.asp?NewsID=23 |title=Imagino a aquellos hombres fuertes |date=March 29, 2003 |website=Diario Co Latino |access-date=April 23, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030428191242/http://www.diariocolatino.com/tresmil/detalles.asp?NewsID=23 |archivedate=April 28, 2003 |deadurl=yes |language=es |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The political class had often sought the approval of the caciques in order to gain support of their people during elections.&lt;ref name="ministerio" /&gt;

[[Image:Arturo Araujo Fajardo.jpg|thumb|Arturo Araujo, elected President of El Salvador in 1931]]

In order to alleviate the economic crisis, the Pipil had organized themselves into cooperative partnerships, through which employment was provided in exchange for their participation in [[Catholicism|Catholic]] festivities. The cacicques led these partnerships, and represented the unemployed before the authorities and supervised their work.&lt;ref name="ministerio" /&gt; [[Feliciano Ama]], for example, was one of the most active caciques and was highly esteemed by the indigenous population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.libros.com.sv/edicion04/feliciano.html |title=José Feliciano Ama es un mártir popular |last=Martínez Peñate |first=Oscar |access-date=April 23, 2007 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070927084108/http://www.libros.com.sv/edicion04/feliciano.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |deadurl=yes |language=es |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ama had arranged for economic assistance from president Romero in exchange for supporting his candidacy. On the other hand, the crisis intensified due to the permanent conflict between the indigenous and non-indigenous populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.libros.com.sv/edicion27/indigena.html |title=La insurrección indígena de 1932 |website=El Periódico Nuevo Enfoque |access-date=April 23, 2007 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070927082622/http://www.libros.com.sv/edicion27/indigena.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |deadurl=yes |language=es |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally, the non-indigenous people had better relations with the government; when riots or fighting occurred, it was indigenous leaders who were arrested and sentenced to death.

The rebellion was also preceded by political instability. El Salvador had been ruled since 1871 by [[Economic liberalism|economic liberal]] elites who had presided over a long period of relative stability. By World War I, the presidency effectively rotated between the Meléndez and Quiñónez families in quasi-dynastic succession. In 1927, [[Pío Romero Bosque]] was elected President and embarked on political liberalisation that led to what was arguably the first free election in Salvadoran history, which was held in [[Salvadoran general election, 1931|1931]].

Arturo Araujo was elected during the 1931 elections, amid a severe economic crisis. After a military coup, vice president [[Maximiliano Hernández Martínez]] assumed control of the country in December 1931, marking the beginning of El Salvador’s military dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nodo50.org/arevolucionaria/masarticulos/septiembre2004/salvador4.htm |title=El Salvador, de la esperanza a la desilusión |last=el Rojo |first=Heródoto |access-date=April 23, 2007 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hernández Martínez’s regime was characterized by the severity of its laws and punishments. For example, [[theft]] was punished with the amputation of a hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diariocolatino.com:80/nacionales/detalles.asp?NewsID=7481 |title="Jornadas de abril y mayo del 44" cumplen hoy 61 años |last=Escobar |first=Iván |date=April 2, 2005 |website=Diario Co Latino |access-date=April 23, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050413211439/http://diariocolatino.com/nacionales/detalles.asp?NewsID=7481 |archivedate=April 13, 2005 |deadurl=yes |language=es |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Martínez strengthened police forces and was especially aggressive in matters of rebellion, issuing the death penalty against anyone who opposed the regime.&lt;ref name="ministerio" /&gt;

Though Martínez's rule may have satisfied the military, popular discontent continued to build and the government's opponents continued to agitate. Within weeks, communists, believing the country was ready for a peasant rebellion, were plotting an insurrection against Martínez.

==Causes of the conflict==
Many incidents and situations directly influenced the conflict. On one side, the [[Salvadoran Army]] was organized to fend off any uprisings. The peasants (indigenous and non-indigenous) were beginning to rise up against the local authorities in an unorganized manner. Finally, the [[Communist Party of El Salvador]] (PCS) became involved in activities which led to the uprising.

===The Salvadoran Army in 1932===
The army was organized into regiments of infantry, artillery, machine guns and cavalry. The most commonly used weapon was the German-made [[Gewehr 98]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faes.gob.sv/MdnCCp/heroes-batallas/revolucion-1932.htm |title=Revolución 1932 |publisher=[[Air Force of El Salvador|Fuerza Aérea de El Salvador]] |access-date=May 5, 2007 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080619010925/http://www.faes.gob.sv/MdnCCp/heroes-batallas/revolucion-1932.htm |archivedate=June 19, 2008 |deadurl=yes |language=es |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The air force did not play a decisive role, as its participation at the time was limited to reconnaissance.

The army was under the direct orders of the President and had the defense of the State as its primary objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exordio.com/1939-1945/paises/Latinoamerica/salvador.html |title=El Salvador: La Segunda Guerra Mundial |date=July 20, 2004 |website=Exordio |access-date=May 5, 2007 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The different security forces included the National Police, the National Guard and the Hacienda Police.

===Preceding peasant rebellions===

Given the circumstances of poverty and inequality, some peasants who were stripped of their land and subjected to poorly paid work began to rebel against the landlords and the authorities.  This began on an individual basis, which made it easier for the authorities to detain or threaten the rebels. The big landlords had close ties to military authorities, so defense of the haciendas was performed by official security forces.&lt;ref name="candelario"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Candelario |first=Sheila |date=January–June 2002 |title= Patología de una Insurrección: La prensa y la Matanza de 1932|url=http://istmo.denison.edu/n03/articulos/patologia.html |language=es |journal=Istmo: Revista virtual de estudios literarios y culturales centroamericanos |volume=3|issn=1535-2315 |access-date=April 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After several arrests, the peasants began to organize in a low profile manner, lacking any hierarchical system. Therefore, efforts remained isolated and disperse and were easily suppressed. Security forces arrested rebels, many of whom were later sentenced to death by [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]] or [[hanging]].&lt;ref name="ministerio" /&gt; There is no data on the number of executions carried out in the weeks prior to the massacre. However, it is known that many peasant leaders were convicted, as were many public officials who collaborated with them in any way.&lt;ref name="ministerio" /&gt;

===The Communist Party of El Salvador===

[[Image:Farabundomarti.jpg|thumb|Agustín Farabundo Martí, leader of the Communist Party of El Salvador]]

At the same time as the conflicts between indigenous people, peasants, landowners and authorities, the Communist Party of El Salvador (PCS) began distributing pamphlets and registering new members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elfaro.net:80/secciones/el_agora/20070122/ElAgora2_20070122.asp |title=1932, las dos caras de una historia por contar |last=Álvarez |first=Joyce |last2=Grégori |first2=Ruth |website=[[El Faro (digital newspaper)|El Faro]] |access-date=May 5, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913100436/http://www.elfaro.net/secciones/el_agora/20070122/ElAgora2_20070122.asp |archivedate=September 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |language=es |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Activities were fuelled by frustration over broken promises by the government and political parties.&lt;ref name="cedema"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cedema.org/ver.php?id=1640 |title=Aproximación a la historia del Partido Comunista Salvadoreño |last=Santacruz |first=Domingo |date=November 12, 2006 |publisher=El Centro de Documentación de los Movimientos Armados |access-date=May 5, 2007 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The communist leaders, led by [[Farabundo Martí]], had built a political organization that managed to obtain the sympathy of the population. After the coup d'état of 1931, the press gained more freedom to express dissenting views, and the PCS increased the spread of their revolutionary message.&lt;ref name="ministerio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="candelario" /&gt;

Although they lacked a definite party platform, the PCS registered candidates for the January 1932 elections. Electoral processes in that era were subject to serious criticism. Votes had to be made publicly with the authorities. This practice broadly favored official candidates by sowing fear among voters and hindering democratic participation.&lt;ref name="ministerio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Galeano2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Galeano|first=Eduardo|authorlink=Eduardo Galeano|title=El siglo del viento|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6mbW3rMyoXYC&amp;pg=PT136|accessdate=October 29, 2017|edition=10th|volume=Volume 3|year=2007|publisher=Siglo XXI de España Editores|language=es|isbn=978-84-323-1531-2|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the elections, accusations of fraud led the communist leadership to abandon faith in the electoral process and take the path of uprising.&lt;ref name="cedema" /&gt;

The uprising was planned for mid-January 1932, and included the support of communist-sympathizers in the military. Before the revolt could take place, police arrested Martí and other communist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Farabundo Martí|url=http://www.avizora.com/publicaciones/biografias/textos/textos_m/0010_marti_farabundo.htm|website=Avizora|accessdate=April 23, 2007|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities seized documents proving the planned insurrection, which were used as evidence in military trials.&lt;ref name="ministerio" /&gt;

Despite the moral and organizational blow suffered by the PCS, the insurrection was not canceled. By the end of January 1932, the national situation had become chaotic. Security forces detained any groups or individuals involved in subversive or revolutionary acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grégori|first1=Ruth|last2=Álvarez|first2=Joyce|title=Las huellas de la muerte en el presente de los indígenas|url=http://www.elfaro.net/secciones/el_agora/20070122/ElAgora1_20070122.asp|website=El Faro|date=January 22, 2007|accessdate=May 5, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926221726/http://www.elfaro.net/secciones/el_agora/20070122/ElAgora1_20070122.asp|archivedate=September 26, 2007|language=es|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the indigenous population in the West began to revolt in protest of poor living conditions. There is no evidence to support the position that the peasant uprising was carried out by the PCS, but due to the dates on which both uprisings occurred, the armed forces responded equally to both movements.

==The uprising==

In the late hours of January 22, 1932, thousands of peasants in the western part of the country rose up in rebellion against the regime. Rebels led by the Communist Party and [[Farabundo Martí|Agustín Farabundo Martí]], Mario Zapata and Alfonso Luna, attacked government forces with support that was largely from the indigenous Pipils. Armed primarily with [[machete]]s,&lt;ref name="payes" /&gt; peasants attacked haciendas and military barracks, gaining control over several towns, including [[Juayúa]], [[Nahuizalco]], [[Izalco]], and [[Tlacopan]]. Barracks in towns such as [[Ahuachapán]], [[Santa Tecla, El Salvador|Santa Tecla]], and [[Sonsonate, El Salvador|Sonsonate]] resisted the attack and remained under government control. It is estimated that peasant rebels killed no more than 100 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Thomas P.|title=Matanza: El Salvador's Communist Revolt of 1932|date=1971|publisher=University of Nebraska|location=Lincoln|isbn=9780803207943|pages=135–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confirmed deaths include about twenty civilians and thirty soldiers.&lt;ref name="cicatriz"&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Carlos Henríquez Consalvi and Jeffrey Gould (Directors) | title =1932, cicatriz de la memoria  | medium =Documentary | language =es | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLZTTxddCZg | publisher =Museo de la Palabra y la Imagen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ching1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ching|first1=Erik|title=Los archivos de Moscú: una nueva apreciación de la insurrección del 32|journal=Tendencias|date=September 1995|volume=3|issue=44|location=San Salvador|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first city to be taken was Juayúa, where landowner Emilio Radaelli was assassinated. His wife was raped and later murdered. Several other military leaders and government officials were also executed.&lt;ref name="Army" /&gt;

Differing accounts of the event exist, and it is difficult to ensure which is correct since there were very few survivors of the rebellion. It is said that indigenous peoples attacked privated property and committed vandalism and other crimes against entire towns. There is evidence to support this claim, though it is possible that these were merely opportunists joining the uprising to carry out criminal acts. The participation of the indigenous peoples and peasants in the looting cannot be conclusively confirmed or denied. The primary motive of the events, however, can be guaranteed.&lt;ref name="cuellar"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cuellar Martinez|first1=Benjamín|title=El Salvador: de genocidio en genocidio|date=October 2004|volume=59|issue=672|pages=1083–1088|publisher=Universidad Centroamericana José Simeón Cañas|location=San Salvador|language=es|issn=0014-1445}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="candelario" /&gt;

The relationship between the peasants and the Communist Party is also controversial. The coincidental timing of both uprisings and the similar causes lead to the conclusion that they were linked, or even coordinated. Some theories contend that the PCS used the economic turmoil to convince the peasants to act together and rise against the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Entrevista a Erik Ching|url=http://www.diariocolatino.com/tresmil/detalles.asp?NewsID=141|website=Diario Co Latino|accessdate=April 11, 2007|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little to nothing is known about the relation between the two groups.&lt;ref name="cuellar" /&gt; Authors such as Erik Ching affirm that the PCS could not possibly have directed the insurrection, as the party held little influence over the peasant population and was hampered by in-fighting.&lt;ref name="ching1995" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ching|first1=Erik|title=In Search of the Party: The Communist Party, the Comintern, and the Peasant Rebellion of 1932 in El Salvador|journal=The Americas|date=1998|volume=55|issue=2|pages=204–239|doi=10.2307/1008053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless, the government made no distinction between either movement.

===Government reaction===

The government reacted swiftly, recovering lost territory by means of a military deployment aimed at suppressing the rebellion.&lt;ref name="payes" /&gt; With their superior training and technology, the government troops needed only a few days to defeat the rebels.

General José Tomás Calderón enjoyed an abundance of troops and weapons:

{{Quote|text=The use of superior armament was the decisive element in the confrontation and the stories speak of “waves of Indians, blown away by machine guns.” This was followed by extreme suppression, executed by units of the Army, Police, and National Guard, as well as volunteers organized into “civil guards.”|source={{cite book|title=Historia de El Salvador|date=1994|publisher=Convenio Cultural México-El Salvador, Ministerio de Educación|page=133}}}}

The civil guards were volunteers who took up service for the security forces to assist in patrolling, and when necessary, fought alongside the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guardia Civil-Historia|url=http://www.guardiacivil.es/coopinternacional/historia_coopint.jsp|publisher=Ministerio del Interior Español|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924021341/http://www.guardiacivil.es/coopinternacional/historia_coopint.jsp|archivedate=September 24, 2011|language=es|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 23, the Canadian warships ''[[HMCS Skeena (D59)|Skeena]]'' and ''[[HMCS Vancouver (F6A)|Vancouver]]'' docked at the Port of [[Acajutla]]. The ships were requested by [[United Kingdom|Britain]], in order to protect any British citizens in the country. [[United States|U.S.]] ships arrived shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Milner|first1=Marc|title=The Invasion Of El Salvador: Navy, Part 14|url=https://legionmagazine.com/en/2006/03/the-invasion-of-el-salvador/|website=Legion Magazine|accessdate=October 31, 2017|date=March 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ships' crews were also prepared to assist the Salvadoran government in quelling the rebellion. However, the chief of operations in El Salvador turned down the offer, stating:&lt;ref name="universidaddeelsalvador" /&gt;

{{Quote|text=The chief of Operation of the Western Zone of the Republic, Major General José Tomás Calderón, presents his compliments on behalf of the government of General Martínez and of himself, to Admiral Smith and Commander Brandeur, of the Rochester, Skeena, and Vancouver, I am pleased to announce that peace in El Salvador is restored, that the communist offensive has been completely suppressed and dispersed, and that complete extermination will be achieved. 4,800 Bolsheviks were wiped out.|source=José Tomás Calderón}}

Although the exact number of deaths in the first 72 hours after the uprising is unknown, several historians agree that it was around 25,000 people.&lt;ref name="cicatriz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.libros.com.sv/edicion62/ama.html |title=Feliciano Ama, líder de la insurrección indígena de 1932 |website=El Periódico Nuevo Enfoque |access-date=April 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |language=es |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318054438/http://www.libros.com.sv/edicion62/ama.html |archivedate=March 18, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Argueta|first1=Ricardo|title=Los grandes debates en la historiografía económica de El Salvador durante el siglo XX|journal=Boletín AFEHC|date=April 4, 2007|issue=29|language=es|issn=1954-3891}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who were captured alive were sent to trial and inevitably sentenced to death.

After the rebellion, peasant leader Francisco Sánchez was hanged. His counterpart, Feliciano Ama, was lynched and his body was later hung in the town square while schoolchildren were forced to attend.&lt;ref name="Galeano2010" /&gt;

In the areas around Izalco, anyone found carrying a machete, and anyone with indigenous features or clothing, was accused of subversion and found guilty.&lt;ref name="delarosa" /&gt; In order to ease the work of the security forces, all those who had not participated in the insurrection were invited to present themselves in order to obtain documents which declared their innocence. Upon arrival they were examined, and those with indigenous features were arrested. They were shot in groups of 50 in front of the wall of the town church, Iglesia de La Asunción. Several were forced to dig mass graves, which they were thrown into after being shot.&lt;ref name="martinez" /&gt; The houses of those found guilty were burned and the surviving inhabitants were shot.

According to the commander of the operacion, 4,800 members of the PCS were killed,&lt;ref name="martinez" /&gt; although this figure is difficult to verify.

After the conflict, survivors attempted to flee to [[Guatemala]]; in response, president [[Jorge Ubico]] ordered the border to be closed, handing over anyone who attempted to cross to the Salvadoran army.&lt;ref name="universidaddeelsalvador" /&gt;

As resolution of the conflict, the [[Legislative Assembly of El Salvador]] issued Legislative Decree No. 121 on July 11, 1932, which granted unconditional amnesty to anyone who committed crimes of any nature in order to "restore order, repress, persecute, punish and capture those accused of the crime of rebellion of this year."&lt;ref name="cuellar" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
Having put down the rebellion, the government of Hernández Martínez began a process of repression of the opposition, and utilized the voter registry to intimidate or execute those who had declared themselves opponents of the government.&lt;ref name="ministerio" /&gt;

As the killings particularly targeted people of indigenous appearance, dress, or language, in the decades that followed, Salvadoran indigenous peoples increasingly abandoned their native dress and traditional languages from fear of further reprisals.&lt;ref name="enemies"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/itvs/enemiesofwar/elsalvador1.html "El Salvador: before the war,"] ''Enemies of War'', [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] companion web site for the documentary film of the same name.

Over the years, the indigenous population has fallen to the point of near extinction in the [[21st century]]. In the decade following the uprising, military presence in the area was persistent with the objective of keeping the peasants under control so that the events did not recur. After the dictatorship of Hernández Martínez, the method of preventing peasant discontent changed from repression to social reforms which benefitted them (at least momentarily).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kohan|first1=Néstor|title=Roque Dalton y Lenin leídos desde el siglo XXI|url=http://raices.com.sv:80/metafora/detalles.asp?NewsID=1059|accessdate=April 22, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016180025/http://raices.com.sv/metafora/detalles.asp?NewsID=1059|archivedate=October 16, 2007|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reforma agraria y desarrollo rural en El Salvador|url=http://www.icarrd.org/en/icard_doc_down/national_Reforma%20Agraria%20en%20El%20Salvador%20VI.doc|website=ICARRD|accessdate=April 22, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006130709/http://www.icarrd.org/en/icard_doc_down/national_Reforma%20Agraria%20en%20El%20Salvador%20VI.doc|archivedate=October 6, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, president [[Mauricio Funes]] apologized to the indigenous communities of El Salvador for the brutal acts of persecution and extermination carried out by previous governments. The statement was made during the inauguration of the First Congress of Indigenous Peoples. "In this context and this spirit, my government wishes to be the first government to, on behalf of the State of El Salvador, of the people of El Salvador, and of the families of El Salvador, make an act of contrition and apologize to the indigenous communities for the persecution and extermination of which they were victims during so many years," said the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presidente Funes pide perdón a comunidades indígenas por persecución y exterminio de otros gobiernos|url=http://www.elsalvadornoticias.net/2010/10/12/presidente-funes-pide-perdon-a-comunidades-indigenas-por-persecucion-y-exterminio-de-otros-gobiernos/|website=El Salvador Noticias|accessdate=October 31, 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120629113907/http://www.elsalvadornoticias.net/2010/10/12/presidente-funes-pide-perdon-a-comunidades-indigenas-por-persecucion-y-exterminio-de-otros-gobiernos/|archivedate=June 29, 2012|date=October 12, 2010|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commemorations===

In the town of Izalco, the uprising is commemorated on every January 22. Media coverage is moderate, but the commemoration is supported by municipal authorities who pay tribute to all who were killed during the event. Speakers include people who lived through the event, and relatives of Feliciano Ama.&lt;ref name="payes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=García Dueñas|first1=Lauri|title=Ancianos de Izalco recuerdan masacre de miles de indígenas|url=http://argentina.indymedia.org/news/2005/01/258611.php|accessdate=April 22, 2007|date=January 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LAX (2815450539).jpg|thumb|Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) was a target of the plots.]]
On or near January 1, 2000, a series of [[Islamic terrorism|Islamist terrorist attacks]] linked to [[al-Qaeda]] were planned to occur in the context of [[millennium celebrations]], including bombing plots against four tourist sites in [[Jordan]], against the [[Los Angeles International Airport]] (LAX) and the {{USS|The Sullivans|DDG-68}}, and the hijacking of [[Indian Airlines Flight 814]].&lt;ref name="post2"&gt;"[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/65601030.html?dids=65601030:65601030&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Dec+24%2C+2000&amp;author=Vernon+Loeb&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.02&amp;desc=Planned+Jan.+2000+Attacks+Failed+or+Were+Thwarted%3B+Plot+Targeted+U.S.%2C+Jordan%2C+American+Warship%2C+Official+Says Planned Jan. 2000 Attacks Failed or Were Thwarted; Plot Targeted U.S., Jordan, American Warship, Official Says]", [[Vernon Loeb]], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', December 24, 2000 {{subscription}} (mirrored at {{cite web |url=http://www.powmadeak47.com/terror/dzterr001224bs.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715111031/http://www.powmadeak47.com/terror/dzterr001224bs.html |archivedate=July 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }})&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Lebanon]], dozens were killed in [[Dinnieh clashes|clashes in the Dinnieh district]] between radical Islamists with connections to the Jordan plots and the Lebanese Army.&lt;ref name="Soufan"/&gt; The plots in Jordan and against LAX were foiled by law enforcement agencies, while the attempted bombing of ''The Sullivans'' only failed because the boat filled with explosives sank before detonating. The revelation of the plot linked to the LAX "Millennium Bomber" [[Ahmed Ressam]] led to unprecedented investigations into possible other terrorist cells in the United States, dubbed Operation "Borderbom", and security measures around millennium celebrations. Other al-Qaeda-linked millennium attack plots may have been planned or foiled around the same time.&lt;ref name="other"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Other Millennium Attacks|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/trail/inside/attacks.html|work=PBS Frontline|date=October 25, 2001|accessdate=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Millennium attack plots==

===Jordan bombing plots===
In Jordan, members of the Islamist terror organization al-Qaeda planned to bomb four sites: a fully booked Radisson hotel in [[Amman]], Jordan; the border between Jordan and [[Israel]]; [[Mount Nebo (Jordan)|Mount Nebo]], a Christian holy site; and a site on the [[Jordan River]] where [[John the Baptist]] is said to have [[Baptism of Jesus|baptized Jesus]].&lt;ref name=abc-us-millenium&gt;{{cite news |title=Amman Radisson Targeted in Foiled Millennium Attack |url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Terrorism/story?id=1296624 |publisher=American Broadcasting Company |accessdate=February 4, 2015 |work=[[ABC News]] |date=November 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; These locations were chosen to target tourists from the United States and Israel.&lt;ref name="other"/&gt; The most active participant was a [[Boston]] taxi driver named [[Raed Hijazi]].&lt;ref name="other"/&gt;

On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a call between [[Abu Zubaydah]], the leader of the plot, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] militant terrorist. In the conversation, Zubaydah stated, "The time for training is over." Sensing that the attack was imminent, Jordanian police arrested Hoshar and fifteen others on December 12, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Dissecting a Terror Plot From Boston to Amman|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/15/world/dissecting-a-terror-plot-from-boston-to-amman.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|date=January 15, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authorities put twenty-eight suspects on trial. Twenty-two of them were quickly found guilty. Six of them, thought to be linked to [[Osama bin Laden]], including Hijazi, were [[sentenced to death]].

[[File:MV COHO.JPG|thumb|Ressam was arrested on the ferry [[MV Coho|MV ''Coho'']] while attempting to cross into the US at Port Angeles.]]
Ahmed Ressam, an [[Algeria]]n citizen living in [[Montreal|Montreal, Canada]] confessed after interrogation to having planned to bomb the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on New Year's Eve. He was arrested by [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP) officer Diana Dean at [[Port Angeles, Washington|Port Angeles]], [[Washington state|Washington]], a U.S. port of entry, on December 14, 1999. Customs officials found a cache of explosives that could have produced "a blast forty times greater than that of a devastating [[car bomb]]" and four timing devices hidden in the spare tire well in the trunk of the rented car in which he had traveled from [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="febninth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/US_v_Ressam_9thcircuitappeals0210.pdf |title=U.S. v.

According to [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] of the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], [[Sandy Berger]], terrorist cells had been disrupted in "eight countries" in the weeks before New Year's Eve, which was said to have "almost certainly" prevented additional attacks.&lt;ref name="other"/&gt; The man behind the LAX plot, Ahmed Ressam, claimed there had been plans by other terrorist cells of millennium attacks "in Europe, in the Gulf, against U.S. and Israel."&lt;ref name="other"/&gt; Major security operations were launched to improve security for the millennium celebrations in [[Times Square]], New York, along with several other cities in the United States and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Federal agents are scrambling to stop a new Y2K worry: terror|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/time/1999/12/27/new.year.html|work=CNN|date=December 27, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Big bang theory haunts the US |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/dec/28/millennium.uk|work=The Guardian|date=December 28, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
===Investigation===
While in prison, Ressam revealed that al-Qaeda [[clandestine cell system|sleeper cells]] existed within the United States. This information was included in the [[President's Daily Brief]] delivered to President [[George W. Bush]] on August 6, 2001, entitled ''[[Bin Laden Determined To Strike in US]]''.&lt;ref name="cnnbinladen"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Transcript: Bin Laden determined to strike in US|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/04/10/august6.memo/|work=CNN|date=April 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bin Laden memo puts Bush on back foot|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/bin-laden-memo-puts-bush-on-back-foot-559687.html|work=The Independent|date=April 12, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FBI special agent and counter-terrorism chief [[John P. O'Neill]], who had been central in the investigation of al-Qaeda in the late 1990s and the millennium plot, and subsequently suspected the existence of sleeper cells in the United States, died in the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 as head of security of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]. O'Neill had started his new job on August 23 less than a month before the attack, after he had been squeezed out of the bureau.&lt;ref name="NewYorker"/&gt;

On July 19, 2004, it was revealed that the [[U.S. Justice Department]] was investigating former National Security Advisor of the Clinton administration, Sandy Berger, for unauthorized removal of [[classified information|classified documents]] in October 2003 from a [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] reading room prior to testifying before the 9/11 Commission.  The documents were five classified copies of a single report commissioned from Richard A. Clarke, covering internal assessments of the Clinton administration's handling of the plots. An associate of Berger said Berger took one copy in September 2003 and four copies in October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/LAW/04/01/berger.plea/ |work=CNN |title=Sandy Berger to plead guilty on documents charge |date=April 1, 2005 |accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks===
After the unsuccessful attack on the USS ''The Sullivans'', al-Qaeda attempted the same type of attack for a second time, again in Aden, Yemen. They [[USS Cole bombing|successfully bombed]] the {{USS|Cole|DDG-67}} on October 12, 2000, in an attack that claimed the lives of seventeen U.S. sailors.&lt;ref name="other"/&gt;

The Radisson SAS hotel in Amman, Jordan, which was the target of a millennium attack plot, was one of three hotels in the city that were [[2005 Amman bombings#Radisson SAS|bombed by al-Qaeda in 2005]]. Thirty-eight people were killed in the bombing, which was the deadliest of the three hotels attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Amman Radisson Targeted in Foiled Millennium Attack|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Terrorism/story?id=1296624|work=ABC News|date=November 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1093">'''[[Capital punishment]]''' in '''[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]''' was completely abolished on the May 1, 2000 when Protocol No. 6 to the [[ECHR]] was signed. Later Georgia also adopted the Second Optional Protocol to the [[ICCPR]]. The death penalty was replaced with [[life imprisonment]].

The last death sentence carried out in Georgia took place in 1997. It was carried out for murder; the prisoner was executed by a single shot to the back of the head.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6045">'''Community health councils''' were established in 1974 to provide a voice for patients and the public in the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) in [[England]] and [[Wales]].

==Statutory Provisions==
Community health councils were obliged to meet in public under the provisions of the Community Health Councils (Access to Information) Act 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Health Councils (Access to Information) Act 1988|url=https://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/health-law/community-health-councils-the-old-rules/community-health-councils-access-to-information-act-1988/|website=Socialist Health Association|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were entitled to be consulted about the provision of local pharmacies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The National Health Service (Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 1992|url=https://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/health-law/community-health-councils-the-old-rules/the-national-health-service-pharmaceutical-services-regulations-1992/|website=Socialist Health Association|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Half the members were appointed by local authorities, a third by local voluntary organisations and a sixth by the [[Regional health authority (UK)|Regional health authority]], which provided the finance to pay staff and costs.  They were entitled to be consulted on any substantial development of the health service  and on any proposals to make any substantial variation in the service.  The question of what constituted a substantial variation was subject to repeated litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Community Health Council Regulations 1996|url=https://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/health-law/community-health-councils-the-old-rules/the-community-health-council-regulations-1996/|website=Socialist Health Association|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolition in England==
They were abolished in 2003 in England as part of the [[NHS Plan 2000]].  Unlike the other proposals in the Plan there was no preceding discussion about this move, nor any clear explanation for this decision, which aroused considerable unhappiness amongst the staff and members. In England a new structure, [[Public and Patient Involvement Forum]]s, was established in 2003. These were replaced by [[local involvement network]]s (LINks) and these have now also been superseded in NHS England by the establishment - as a result of the English NHS reforms in 2012 - by new organisations called [[HealthWatch England|Healthwatch]]. These do not, however, have the same resources, statutory powers or responsibilities as CHCs.

==Wales==

Up until 2010 there were 19 CHCs in Wales. However, as a result of the passing by the Welsh Assembly Government of the Community Health Councils (Constitution, Membership and Procedures) (Wales) Regulations 2010, these were replaced by eight CHCs. These covered larger geographical areas, and were largely co-terminus with the smaller number of health boards which had been established to replace most NHS Trusts in Wales. The community health councils in Wales work to enhance and improve the quality of your local health service.  They are the patients statutory and independent voice in health services provided throughout Wales.

Members are drawn equally from three sources; local authority representatives, nominees from local third-sector bodies and members appointed by the Minister in response to advert. CHCs also have the right to co-opt non-voting members to the council.

The key function of the CHC is to represent the interests of the public in the health service in their district. Each CHC currently monitors and evaluates from the patient's viewpoint the effectiveness of NHS services provided by all NHS establishments, including hospitals, GPs, pharmacies, opticians, care homes, dentists, etc.  Every autumn, the Hospital Patient Environment (HPE) visits take place, this is where all the CHCs collect data on their local district general and a selection of community hospitals and report on their finding. A report is produced on these findings by the Board of Community Health Councils and sent to the Welsh Assembly Government. The Board of Community Health Councils in Wales is the National body for all CHCs in Wales. The CHCs also provide a free, independent and confidential advocacy service to patients who seek advice and support in the process of pursuing a complaint against the NHS.

At the time of the launch of the new CHCs in 2010, the then Health Minister for Wales, Edwina Hart, indicated that they would be reviewed after two years, to evaluate how they were working. In February 2012 the then Minister for Health and Social Services at the Welsh Government, Mrs Lesley Griffiths, formally announced the Terms of Reference for this review, which was led by Professor Marcus Longley, Director of the Welsh Institute for Health and Social Care and reported back to the Minister in June 2012. This was followed in late 2012/early 2013 by a consultation on proposals for modernising and strengthening the role, organisation, accountability and visibility of CHCs in Wales. The proposals were accepted by the new Health Minister, Professor Mark Drakeford, in a report back to a Plenary Session of the National Assembly for Wales Senedd in March 2013, where the Minister confirmed his continuing support for CHCs in Wales. Although legislation will be required to implement some of the proposals, most are likely to be put in place without the need for legislation, with the Board of CHCs in wales taking the lead role in co-ordinating the work.

{{Political corruption sidebar|image=[[File:Flag of Nigeria.svg|150 px]]}}

'''[[Political corruption]]''' is a persistent phenomenon in '''[[Nigeria]]'''. The rise of public administration and the discovery of [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] are two major events believed to have led to the sustained increase in the incidence of corrupt practices in the country.&lt;ref&gt;The Storey Report. The Commission of Inquiry into the administration of Lagos Town Council&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Africa, London, April 1979, p 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts have been made by government to minimize corruption through the enactment of laws and the enforcement of integrity systems but with little success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nigeria Corruption Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/nigeria/show-all.aspx|website=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Nigeria was estimated to have lost over $400 billion to corruption since independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Okoye|first=Rita|url=http://dailypost.ng/2012/08/31/nigeria-lost-400bn-oil-revenue-corruption-since-independence|title=Nigeria has lost $400bn oil revenue to corruption since Independence – Ezekwesili |publisher=Daily Post Nigeria|date=31 August 2012|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greed, ostentatious lifestyle, customs, and people's attitudes are believed to have led to corruption. Another root cause is tribalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Akindola|first=Rufus|date=2017|title=Military Incursion, Tribalism and Poor Governance: The Consequences for Development in Nigeria|url=http://www.mcser.org/journal/index.php/mjss/article/download/10069/9701|journal=Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences|volume=8|pages=151–155|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friends and [[kinship|kinsmen]] seeking favor from officials can impose strains on the ethical disposition of the official as these kinsmen see government officials as holding avenues for their personal survival and gain.&lt;ref&gt;Wraith, R, and E Simpkins, ''Corruption in Developing Countries. Tribalism might as well remain the greatest obstacle to tackling official corruption in Nigeria''. Journal of Modern African Affairs, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and cases==

===Pre-Independence and the First Republic===
Corruption, though prevalent, was kept at manageable levels during the First Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Chinua Achebe. No Longer at ease New York, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chinua Achebe, A Man of the People, New York, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; However, the cases of corruption during the period were sometimes clouded by political infighting. 
*[[Azikiwe]] was the first major political figure investigated for questionable practices. In 1944, a firm belonging to Azikiwe and family bought a Bank in [[Lagos]]. The bank was procured to strengthen local control of the financial industry. Albeit, a report about transactions carried out by the bank showed though Azikiwe had resigned as chairman of the bank, the current chairman was an agent of his. The report wrote that most of the paid-up capital of the African Continental Bank were from the Eastern Regional Financial Corporation.
*In western Nigeria, politician [[Adegoke Adelabu]] was investigated following charges of political corruption leveled against him by the opposition. The report led to demand for his resignation as district council head.
*In the Northern region, against the backdrop of corruption allegations leveled against some native authority officials in [[Borno State|Bornu]]. The Northern Government enacted the Customary Presents order to forestall any further breach of regulations. Later on, it was the British administration that was accused of corrupt practices in the results of elections which enthroned a [[Fulani]] political leadership in [[Kano]], reports later linking the British authorities to electoral irregularities were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Tignor. Political Corruption in Nigeria before Independence, The Journal of Modern African Studies &gt; Vol. 31, No. 2 (Jun., 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gowon Administration (August 1966 – July 1975)===
Corruption for the most part of [[Yakubu Gowon]]'s administration was kept away from public view until 1975. However, informed officials voiced concerns. Critics said Gowon's governors acted like lords overseeing their personal [[fiefdom]]. He was viewed as timid, faced with corrupt elements in his government.

In 1975, a corruption [[scandal]] surrounding the importation of cement engulfed many officials of the defense ministry and the central bank of Nigeria. Officials were later accused of falsifying ships manifestos and inflating the amount of cement to be purchased.&lt;ref&gt;Turner. The Nigerian Cement Racket, Africa Guide, 1976 Pg 6&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Gowon administration, two individuals from the middle belt of the country were accused of corruption. The Nigerian government controlled the newspapers, so the Daily Times and the New Nigerian gave great publicity to denunciations of the administration of Gomwalk, and Federal Commissioner [[Joseph Tarka]] by the two critics. A situation which may signal a cause for exigent action on corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Panter Brick. Soldiers and Oil: The Political Transformation of Nigeria, {{ISBN|0 714630985}} Pg70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murtala administration (1975 – February 1976)===
In 1975, the administration of [[Murtala Mohammed]] made reformist changes. After a military coup brought it to power, the new government sacked a large number of prior government officials and civil servants, many of whom had been criticized for the misuse of power they wielded under the largely uneducated military of Gowon.&lt;ref&gt;Olajide Aluko. Nigeria and Britain after Gowon, African Affairs. Vol. 76, No. 304 Jul., 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obasanjo administration (February 1976 – September 1979)===
The first administration of Olusegun Obasanjo was a continuation of the Muritala Mohammed administration, and was focused on completing the transition program to democracy, as well as implementing the national development plans. Major projects including building new refineries, pipelines, expanding the national shipping and airlines as well as hosting FESTAC was done during the administration. A number of these national projects were conduits to distribute favors and enrich connected politicians. The famous Afrobeat musician, Fela Kuti, sang variously about major scandals involving the international telecommunication firm ITT led by Chief MKO Abiola in Nigeria, which the then Head of State, Gen Olusegun Obasanjo was associated with.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.piie.com/publications/chapters_preview/12/8iie2334.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, the Operation Feed the Nation Program, and the associated land grab under the Land Use Decree implemented by the then Head of State was used as conduits to reward cronies, and his now famous Otta Farm Nigeria (OFN) was supposedly a project borne out of this scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201412070115.html|title=Nigeria: The Gospel According to St. Obasanjo|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shagari Administration (October 1979 – December 1983)===
Corruption was deemed pervasive during the administration of [[Shehu Shagari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1984/01/03/nigerian-leader-promises-crackdown-on-corruption/0c0695f6-2b9b-45ca-9c59-7cf8b484c72f/|title=Nigerian Leader Promises Crackdown on Corruption|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A few federal buildings mysteriously caught fire after investigators started to probe the finances of the officials working in the buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Dash, Mysterious Fires Plague Nigerian Investigations, The Washington Post, February 27, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; 
In late 1985, investigations into the collapse of the defunct Johnson Mathey Bank of [[London]] shed light on some of the abuses carried on during the second republic. The bank acted as a conduit to transfer hard currency for some party members in Nigeria. A few leading officials and politicians had amassed large amounts of money. They sought to transfer the money out of the country with the help of Asian importers by issuing import licenses.&lt;ref&gt;"British banks linked to import swindles", The Globe and Mail (Canada), December 3, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, a rice shortage led to accusations of corruption against the NPN government. Shortages and subsequent allegations were precipitated by [[protectionism]]. After its election the Nigerian government decided to protect local rice farmers from imported commodities. A licensing system was created to limit rice imports. However, accusations of favoritism and government-supported speculation were leveled against many officials.&lt;ref&gt;Juan de Onis, "Rice Shortage in Nigeria Brings Charges of Corruption", The New York Times, January 18, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buhari Administration (December 1983 – August 1985)===
In 1985, a cross section of politicians were convicted of corrupt practices under the government of General [[Muhammadu Buhari]], but the administration itself was only involved in a few instances of lapsed ethical judgment. Some cite the suitcases scandal which also coincidentally involved then customs leader Atiku Abubakar{{who|date=May 2016}}, who later became Vice President in 1999, and was indicted for various acts of corruption. "The 53 suitcases saga arose in 1984 during the currency change exercise ordered by the Buhari junta when it ordered that every case arriving the country should be inspected irrespective of the status of the person behind such. The 53 suitcases were, however, ferried through the [[Murtala Muhammed International Airport|Murtala Muhammed Airport]] without a customs check by soldiers allegedly at the behest of Major Mustapha Jokolo, the then aide-de-camp to Gen. Buhari. Atiku was at that time the Area Comptroller of Customs in charge of the Murtala Muhammed Airport."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/03/53-suitcases-saga-buhari-blasts-atiku-jonathan/|title=53 Suitcases Saga: Buhari blasts Atiku, Jonathan|first=Emmanuel|last=Aziken|date=20 March 2011|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Babangida Administration (August 1985 – August 1993)===
The regime of general [[Ibrahim Babangida]] or IBB, has been seen as the body that legalized corruption. His administration refused to give account of the [[Gulf War]] windfall, which has been estimated to be $12.4 billion. He rigged the only successful election in the history of Nigeria in June 12, 1993.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} He lives in a very exquisite mansion in his home state of Niger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.9jabook.com/profiles/blogs/ibb-the-mess-iah-see-ibbs|title=IBB: The "mess" iah see IBBs Lavish Mansion Pictures Hilltop|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During IBB's tenure, corruption became a policy of state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/262857/1/ibb-shuns-mourning-of-dead-wife-plans-to-commissio.html|title=IBB Shuns mourning of dead wife, Plans to Commission his Hotel in Abuja|first=|last=huhuonline.com|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vehicles and cash gifts were routinely disbursed &lt;!-- if I understand this sentence, and I am not sure I do -- for one thing is n't there just one president? -- isn't it much stronger and clearer without these words?:  by the Presidents irregularly to the rank and file --&gt; to earn loyalty, and the discipline of the military force eroded. The term "IBB Boys" emerged, meaning fronts for the head of state in business realm, someone who will transact dirty deals from drug dealing to money laundering. The President was reportedly deeply involved in drug dealing through the first lady, Maryam Babangida, and Gloria Okon (his girlfriend). The near-revelation of that fact by Dele Giwa triggered the assassination of the journalist by the Presidential death squad using a letter bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naijarchives.com/gloria-okon-the-story-of-nigerias-most-mysterious-drug-pusher/|title=GLORIA OKON, The Story of Nigeria’s Most Mysterious Drug Pusher|date=6 August 2015|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

IBB used various government privatization initiatives to reward friends and cronies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenigerianvoice.com/news/89090/1/oil-bloc-in-nigeria-obasanjo-ibb-atiku-abubakar-ty.html|title=Oil Bloc in Nigeria: Obasanjo, Ibb, Atiku Abubakar, T.Y. Danjuma, David Mark, Dangote and Adenuga are Syndicates of Corruption|first=Kindness Innocent|last=Jonah|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which eventually gave rise to the current class of [[nouveau riche]] in Nigeria. From banking to oil and import licenses, IBB used these favors to raise cash for himself and his family, and is regarded as one of the richest ex-rulers of Nigeria supposedly with significant investment in Globacom&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nigeriavillagesquare.com/articles/omoyele-sowore/mike-adenuga-arrested-detained-by-efcc.html&lt;/ref&gt;—one of the largest telecom operators in Nigeria, regarded as a front for his empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saharareporters.com/2006/08/11/mohammed-babangida-detained-efcc-looks-globacom-and-ibb%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cfront-investments%E2%80%9D|title=Mohammed Babangida detained, EFCC looks into Globacom and IBB’s "front investments"|first=|last=siteadmin|date=12 August 2006|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abacha Administration (Nov 1993 – June 1998)===
The death of the general [[Sani Abacha]] revealed the global nature of graft. [[France|French]] investigations of bribes paid to government officials to ease the award of a gas plant construction in Nigeria revealed the level of official graft in the country. The investigations led to the freezing of accounts containing about $100 million [[United States dollar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hector Igbikiowubo, "TSKJ Saga: Swiss Govt Freezes $ 100M Accounts", Vanguard, Nigeria, December 6, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In 2000, two years after his death, a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] banking commission report indicted Swiss banks for failing to follow compliance process when they allowed Abacha's family and friends of access to his accounts and to deposit amounts totaling $600 million US dollars into them. The same year, a total of more than $1 billion US dollars were found in various accounts throughout [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;David Pallister, "Comment &amp; Analysis: Pennies from heaven: Many of Nigeria's missing millions were laundered through greedy banks in London", The Guardian (London), September 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abdusalami Administration (June 1998 – May 1999)===
The government of Gen. Abdusalami was short and focused on transiting the country quickly to democracy. Albeit, suspicion remains that quite a huge of wealth was acquired by him and his inner circle in such short period, as he lives in quite exquisite mansion of his own adjacent IBB's that exceeds whatever he might have earned in legitimate income. Indeed, the major Halliburton scandal implicated his administration, and this might have financed his opulence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/leaked-files-link-abdulsalami-abubakar-chris-garba-to-182m-halliburton-bribery-scandal/201454/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512194710/http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/leaked-files-link-abdulsalami-abubakar-chris-garba-to-182m-halliburton-bribery-scandal/201454 |archivedate=2015-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obasanjo administration (May 1999 – May 2007)===
Various corruption scandals broke out under Olusegun Obasanjo's presidency, including one of international dimensions when his vice president was caught in cahoots with a US Congressman stashing cold hard cash (literally) in freezers. In addition to this, the KBR and Siemens bribery scandals broke out under his administration, which was serially{{clarify|date=May 2016}} investigated by the FBI and led to international indictments indicating high-level corruption in his administration. According to reports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.punchng.com/politics/offshore-bribery-convictions-and-nigerias-anti-graft-war/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924133041/http://www.punchng.com/politics/offshore-bribery-convictions-and-nigerias-anti-graft-war/ |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "while Nigeria dithered, the United States Department of Justice on January 18, 2012 announced that a Japanese construction firm, [[Marubeni Corporation]], agreed to pay a $54.6 million criminal penalty for allegedly bribing officials of the Nigerian government to facilitate the award of the $6 billion liquefied natural gas contract in Bonny, Nigeria to a multinational consortium, TSKJ".  They paid bribes to Nigerian government officials between 1995 and 2004, in violation of the [[United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]].

Some other acts of corruption tied to Olusegun Obasanjo included the Transcorp shares scandal that violated the code of conduct standards for public officers, and the presidential library donations at the eve of his exit from power that pressured associates to donate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informationng.com/2013/02/things-you-never-knew-about-mike-adenuga-nigerias-second-richest-man.html|title=Things You Never Knew About Mike Adenuga, Nigeria’s Second Richest Man – Information Nigeria|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obasanjo was also said to widely lobby for his failed campaign to alter the constitution to get a third term by actively bribing the legislators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/05/the-third-term-bribery-allegation/|title=The third term bribery allegation - Vanguard News|date=22 May 2011|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; further deepening corruption at the highest levels.

===Umaru Musa Yar'Adua administration (May 2007 – May 2010)===
Yaradua's ascent and time in office was short, although a fair number of corruption scandals from previous administrations came to light under his tenure and went uninvestigated due to lack of political will and poor health. Yaradua's various acts of political corruption using his Attorney-General to frustrate ongoing local and international investigations of his powerful friends like Governor Ibori, Igbinnedion and Odili which led to massive losses to their states. Indeed, AG Aondakaa was legendary in his inability to obtain conviction in Nigeria even as UK and foreign courts successfully tried Nigeria's deeply corrupt governors from the Obasanjo era that helped Yaradua emerge as president. In addition, Wikileaks revealed that the Supreme Court Justices were bribed to legitimize the corrupt elections that saw to his emergence as president through massive rigging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/09/yaradua-knew-aondoakaa-was-corrupt-but-could-not-sack-him-wikileaks/|title=Yar'Adua knew Aondoakaa was corrupt but could not sack him - Wikileaks - Vanguard News|date=8 September 2011|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wikileaks documents also revealed the staying power of corruption under Yaradua, with illegal payments from NNPC to Presidents continuing unabated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/usaafricadialogue/QtWCrbYOKHk|title=Google Groups|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goodluck Jonathan administration (2010–2015)===
In 2014, Nigeria's rank improved from 143rd to the 136th position on [[Transparency International]]'s [[Corruption Perceptions Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/nigeria-records-improvement-ranked-39th-on-corruption-index/195767/ |title=Nigeria Records Improvement, Ranked 39th on Corruption Index |publisher=This Day Live |date=4 December 2014 |accessdate=8 February 2015 |author=Chima, Obinna |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208144949/https://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/nigeria-records-improvement-ranked-39th-on-corruption-index/195767/ |archivedate=8 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2013, Nigeria's then [[Central Bank of Nigeria|Central Bank]] governor [[Sanusi Lamido Sanusi]] informed President Goodluck Jonathan that the state oil company, [[NNPC]], had failed to remit US$20 billion in oil revenues owed to the state. Jonathan however dismissed the claim and replaced Sanusi for his mismanagement of the central bank's budget. A Senate committee also found Sanusi’s account to be lacking in substance.&lt;ref name=reu&gt;{{cite news|author1=Tim Cocks and Joe Brock|title=Special Report: Anatomy of Nigeria's $20 billion "leak"|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/06/us-nigeria-election-banker-specialreport-idUSKBN0LA0X820150206|accessdate=6 February 2015|work=Reuters|date=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the conclusion of the NNPC's account audit, it was announced in January 2015 that NNPC's non-remitted revenue is actually US$1.48 billion, which it needs to refund to the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nigerianbulletin.com/threads/nnpc-audit-no-missing-20-billion-%E2%80%93-bloomberg.107644/ | title=NNPC Audit: No Missing $20 Billion | publisher=Nigerian Bulletin | accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release of both the PwC and Deloitte report by the government at the eve of its exit, it was however determined that truly close to $20 billion was indeed missing or misappropriated or spent without appropriation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aguntasolo.com/2015/04/29/this-yam-this-goat-this-country-part-1/|title=This Yam, This Goat, This Country: PwC on NNPC – Part 1|date=29 April 2015|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these, the government of Goodluck Jonathan had several running scandals including the BMW purchase by his Aviation Minister, $250 million plus security contracts to militants in the Niger Delta,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africaoilgasreport.com/2015/01/kickstarter/looking-beyond-the-diezani-tenure/|title=Looking Beyond the Diezani Tenure - Africa Oil+Gas Report|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; massive corruption and kickbacks in the Ministry of Petroleum, the Malibu Oil International scandal, and several scandals involving the Petroleum Ministry including accusations of sweetheart deals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africaoilgasreport.com/2015/01/kickstarter/looking-beyond-the-diezani-tenure/|title=Looking Beyond the Diezani Tenure - Africa Oil+Gas Report|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with select fronts and business people to divert public wealth. In the dying days of Goodluck Jonathan's administration, the Central Bank scandal of cash tripping of mutilated notes also broke out, where it was revealed that in a four-day period, 8 billion [[naira]] was stolen directly by low-level workers in the CBN. This revelation excluded a crime that is suspected to have gone on for years and went undetected until revealed by whistle-blower. The Central Bank claim the heist undermined its monetary policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.punchng.com/news/cash-assistant-others-have-post-property-in-safrica-efcc/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150604093145/http://www.punchng.com/news/cash-assistant-others-have-post-property-in-safrica-efcc/ |archivedate=2015-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|UNODC]] began an initiative to help combat corruption in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/brussels/en/anti-corruption-in-nigeria.html|title=Anti-Corruption in Nigeria|first=|last=valerie.devuyst|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muhammadu Buhari administration (2015–2019)===
In 2016, the Senate ad-hoc committee on “mounting humanitarian crisis in the North East” led by Senator [[Shehu Sani]] indicted the then Secretary to the Government of the Federation appointed by [[Muhammadu Buhari]], Mr. Babachir Lawal in a N200 million contract scandal for the clearing of “invasive plant species” in Yobe State by Rholavision Nigeria Limited; a company he owns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnewsonline.com/fresh-trouble-for-babachir-lawal/|title=Fresh trouble for Babachir Lawal|date=3 November 2017|publisher=The Sun Newspaper|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 30, 2017, President Buhari sacked Lawal based on the report of a three-man panel led by Vice-President [[Yemi Osinbajo]] that investigated him and one other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://punchng.com/breaking-at-last-buhari-sacks-babachir-appoints-new-sgf/|title=At last, Buhari sacks suspended SGF, NIA boss|date=30 October 2017|publisher=The Punch Newspaper|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdulrasheed Maina was the head of the task force on pension reforms during the President [[Goodluck Jonathan]] led administration but fled Nigeria in 2015 after claims that he embezzled two billion naira ($5.6 million, 4.8 million euros). Despite the fact that an Interpol arrest warrant was issued, he still managed to return to Nigeria, where he was said to have enjoyed protection from the security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://punchng.com/breaking-at-last-buhari-sacks-babachir-appoints-new-sgf/|title=‘Maina has put a big question mark on Buhari’s integrity’|date=27 October 2017|publisher=Vanguard Newspaper|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the senate through its committee on public accounts, 85 government parastatals under the present government under the leadership of [[Muhammadu Buhari]] are yet to submit their report since the inception of this government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kemi |last=Busari |url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/261038-efcc-boi-83-others-never-submitted-audit-reports-since-inception-senate.html |title=EFCC, BOI, 83 others "never submitted their audit reports since inception" – Senate |newspaper=Premium Times |date=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flag bearer of the corruption fight in Nigeria, the EFCC has responded to the senate committee on public account's claim on the non submission of her account report by the institution and 84 others. The Economic and financial crimes commission denied the report issued by the committee claiming it was not true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/261084-senate-claim-efccs-audit-report-incorrect-spokesperson.html |title=Senate claim on EFCC's audit report 'incorrect' – Spokesperson |date=March 7, 2018 |first=QueenEsther |last=Iroanusi |newspaper=Premium Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cricket diplomacy''' consists of using the game of [[cricket]] as a political tool to enhance or worsen the diplomatic relations between two [[List of International Cricket Council members|cricket playing nations]]. Cricket is the second-most widely played game in the world after [[association football|football]], and is thus used as a political tool to bridge the gap in the diplomatic vacuum.

==Australia and England==
{{main|The Ashes}}
The [[Bodyline]] controversy was detrimental to relations between England and Australia. The situation escalated into a diplomatic incident between the countries as the MCC—supported by the British public and still of the opinion that their ''fast leg theory'' tactic was harmless—took serious offence at being branded "unsportsmanlike" and demanded a retraction. Many people saw bodyline as fracturing an international relationship that needed to remain strong.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 241&amp;ndash;259.&lt;/ref&gt; Jardine, and by extension the entire English team, threatened to withdraw from the fourth and fifth Tests unless the Australian Board withdrew the accusation of unsporting behaviour.&lt;ref name="p259"&gt;Pollard, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; Public reaction in both England and Australia was outrage directed at the other nation. The Governor of South Australia, [[Alexander Hore-Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie|Alexander Hore-Ruthven]], who was in England at the time, expressed his concern to British [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs]] [[James Henry Thomas]] that this would cause a significant impact on trade between the nations.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 242&amp;ndash;248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="p2601"/&gt; The standoff was settled only when Australian prime minister [[Joseph Lyons]] met with members of the Australian Board and outlined to them the severe economic hardships that could be caused in Australia if the British public boycotted Australian trade. Given this understanding, the Board withdrew the allegation of unsportsmanlike behaviour two days before the fourth Test, thus saving the tour.&lt;ref name="p2601"&gt;Pollard, pp. 260&amp;ndash;261.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 255&amp;ndash;259.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were significant consequences for Anglo-Australian relations, which remained strained until the outbreak of World War II made cooperation paramount. Business between the two countries was adversely affected as citizens of each country displayed a preference for not buying goods manufactured in the other. Australian commerce also suffered in British colonies in Asia: the ''North China Daily News'' published a pro-bodyline editorial, denouncing Australians as sore losers. An Australian journalist reported that several business deals in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Shanghai]] were lost by Australians because of local reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

English immigrants in Australia found themselves shunned and persecuted by locals, and Australian visitors to England were treated similarly.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934–35 a statue of [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]] in Sydney was vandalised, with an ear being knocked off and the word "BODYLINE" painted on it.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

==India and Pakistan==
{{Main|India–Pakistan cricket rivalry}}
Cricket has also had a hand to play in sporting diplomacy. Following the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], and Soviet pressure on India to deflect the tension they faced, in 1987 Pakistan's president at the time, General [[Zia ul-Haq]], attended a test match between India and Pakistan in Jaipur - a visit that apparently helped cool a flare-up in tensions. Furthermore, in 2004 after a break of fifteen years, India toured Pakistan in the wake of diplomatic initiatives to bury half a century of mutual hostility. Both sides relaxed their tough visa regulations for each other, allowing thousands of fans to travel across the border.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/03/10/business/singh.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to replicate the cricket diplomacy of the past General [[Pervez Musharraf]] came to India in 2005 ostensibly for a cricket match. The trip, however, quickly took on the air of a summit as the sides were urged "to seize a historic chance to end their dispute over Kashmir."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-04/17/content_434859.htm Musharraf visits India amid cricket diplomacy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-04/19/content_435617.htm|title=India, Pakistan cricket diplomacy no game it's real|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often this rivalry has been tinged with a religious-political bent to it. In 1991, the workers of the [[List of political parties in India|Indian political party]] [[Shiv Sena]] dug up the cricket pitch at the [[Wankhede Stadium]] in [[Mumbai]] on the eve of an India-Pakistan [[Test cricket|Test match]] which was to be held there, forcing the entire series between the two nations to be cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/navigation/?type=static&amp;page=flonnet&amp;rdurl=fl1602/16020280.htm|title=Navigation News - Frontline|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20121101/main4.htm|title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India - Main News|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shiv Sena once again used this unique means of protest at the [[Feroz Shah Kotla]] in [[New Delhi]] in 2000 to protest against the Pakistan cricket team's proposed visit.&lt;ref name="update.unu.edu"&gt;[http://update.unu.edu/archive/issue31_2.htm UNU Update: Cricket Diplomacy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821122824/http://update.unu.edu/archive/issue31_2.htm |date=21 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Kargil conflict]], and at various other times, there have also been calls to suspend cricketing ties between the two countries.

During the [[2011 Cricket World Cup]], [[2011 Cricket World Cup Semifinal: India v Pakistan|the semifinal]] is believed to have eased the relationship between India and Pakistan after the polarising 2008 Mumbai attacks. Prime Minister of India [[Manmohan Singh]] used this opportunity and greeted his Pakistani counterpart [[Yousuf Raza Gilani]] to watch the match with him at Mohali.

In 2008, the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]] cancelled [[Zimbabwe cricket team|Zimbabwe]]'s 2009 tour of England, and the [[Government of the United Kingdom]] subsequently suspended all bilateral relations between the two states in response to the situation regarding the [[Zimbabwean presidential election, 2008|2008 Zimbabwean presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=England cut Zimbabwe cricket ties |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/7471238.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 June 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  MPs [[Jack Straw]] and [[Tessa Jowell]] wrote to the [[International Cricket Council]] asking them to ban Zimbabwe from international cricket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/other_international/zimbabwe/4170262.stm | work=BBC News | title=Zimbabwe is facing new ban threat | date=21 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==China and Taiwan==
Extending a form of [[cultural diplomacy]] popularly called [[stadium diplomacy]], China has also joined cricket diplomacy. [[Cross-Strait relations]] have been the impetus for doing so. During the buildup to the [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007 World Cup]], [[Antigua]] received a $55 million grant to build the [[Sir Vivian Richards Stadium]], while Jamaica received $30 million for a new [[Greenfield Stadium (Trelawny)|Trelawny]] stadium. [[St. Lucia]] also built both a cricket and a football stadium courtesy of China. China spent a remarkable $132 million on cricket facilities in the West Indies over the past few years, compared to the [[International Cricket Council]]'s 10-year budget of $70 million to promote cricket globally. The diplomacy paid off in the end as [[Grenada]] and [[Dominica]] derecognized Taiwan as an independent country. Further, "Of the remaining 24 countries that recognize Taiwan, four are in the Caribbean and two of these play cricket."{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} Grenada previously had a stadium built by Taiwan, but saw it flattened by a hurricane. To join the action, China quickly came in to erect another stadium. Consequently, Taiwan took Grenada to a New York City court to force the latter to return the original loan.

Taiwan also used the World Cup to shore up its position among its shrinking West Indian support base. It doled out $21 million to [[St. Kitts and Nevis]] and $12 million to the even smaller [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]] for cricket grounds. China's aggressive ambitions have benefited the [[Caribbean Islands]] as "Strategic analysts say China is laying out more money than is needed to just isolate Taiwan. China, which has built large embassies in each of the islands, now has a bigger diplomatic presence in the Caribbean than the United States, the superpower next door." And that "Mainland China's long-term strategy coincides with its foreign policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/Story?id=2980988&amp;page=1|title=China Outplays Taiwan in Cricket Diplomacy|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9868">A [[cryptographic key]] is a string of data that is used to lock or unlock [[cryptography|cryptographic functions]], including [[authentication]], [[authorization]] and [[encryption]]. Cryptographic keys are grouped into '''cryptographic key types''' according to the functions they perform.&lt;ref name="Reinholm_crypto-key-types"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reinholm|first1=James H.|title=Classification of Cryptographic Keys (Functions &amp; Properties)|url=https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/classification-or-cryptographic-keys|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

Consider a keyring that contains a variety of keys. These keys might be various shapes and sizes, but one thing is certain, each will generally serve a separate purpose. One key might be used to start an automobile, while another might be used to open a safety deposit box. The automobile key will not work to open the safety deposit box and vice versa. This analogy provides some insight on how cryptographic key types work. These keys are categorized in respect to how they are used and what properties they possess. 

A cryptographic key is categorized according to how it will be used and what properties it has. For example, a key might have one of the following properties: Symmetric, Public or Private. Keys may also be grouped into pairs that have one private and one public key, which is referred to as an Asymmetric key pair.

===Asymmetric versus symmetric keys===

Asymmetric keys differ from symmetric keys in that the algorithms use separate keys for encryption and decryption while a symmetric key’s algorithm uses a single key for both processes. Because multiple keys are used with an asymmetric algorithm, the process takes longer to produce than a symmetric key algorithm would. However, the benefits lay in the fact that an asymmetric algorithm is much more secure than a symmetric key algorithm is.

With a symmetric key, the key needs to be transmitted to the receiver where there is always the possibility that the key could be intercepted or tampered with. With an asymmetric key, the message and/or accompanying data can be sent or received by using a public key; however, the receiver or sender would use his or her personal private key to access the message and/or accompanying data. Thus, asymmetric keys are suited for use for transmitting confidential messages and data and when authentication is required for assurance that the message has not been tampered with. Only the receiver, whom is in possession of the public key’s corresponding private key, has the ability to decode the message. A public key can be sent back and forth between recipients, but a private key remains fixed to one location and is not sent back and forth, which keeps it safe from being intercepted during transmission.&lt;ref name="Reinholm_crypto-key-types" /&gt;

===Long term versus single use===

Cryptographic keys may also have keys that designate they can be used for long-term (static, archived) use or used for a single session (ephemeral). The latter generally applies to the use of an Ephemeral Key Agreement Key. Most other key types are designed to last for long crypto-periods from about one to two years. When a shorter crypto-period is designed different key types may be used, such as Data Encryption keys, Symmetric Authentication keys, Private Key-Transport keys, Key-Wrapping keys, Authorization keys or RNG keys.&lt;ref name="Reinholm_crypto-key-types" /&gt;

==Key types==

This page shows the classification of key types from the point of view of key management. In a key management system, each key should be labeled with one such type and that key should never be used for a different purpose.

According to NIST SP 800-57 (Revision 4) the following types of keys exist&lt;ref name="NIST-800-57"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barker|first1=Elaine|title=NIST Special Publication 800-57 Part 1 Revision 4: Recommendation for Key Management|url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r4.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reinholm_crypto-key-types" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spacey-keytypes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spacey|first1=John|title=12 Types of Cryptographic Key|url=http://simplicable.com/new/cryptographic-keys|publisher=Simplicable|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

; Private signature key: Private [[digital signature|signature]] keys are the private keys of asymmetric ([[public-key cryptography|public]]) key pairs that are used by public key algorithms to generate digital signatures with possible long-term implications. When properly handled, private signature keys can be used to provide [[authentication]], [[integrity]] and [[non-repudiation]].
; Public signature verification key: A public signature verification key is the public key of an asymmetric key pair that is used by a public key algorithm to verify digital signatures, either to authenticate a user's identity, to determine the integrity of the data, for non-repudiation, or a combination thereof.
; Symmetric authentication key: [[symmetric key algorithm|Symmetric]] authentication keys are used with symmetric key algorithms to provide assurance of the integrity and source of messages, communication sessions, or stored data.
; Private authentication key: A private authentication key is the private key of an asymmetric key pair that is used with a public key algorithm to provide assurance as to the integrity of information, and the identity of the originating entity or the source of messages, communication sessions, or stored data.
; Public authentication key: A public authentication key is the public key of an asymmetric key pair that is used with a public key algorithm to determine the integrity of information and to authenticate the identity of entities, or the source of messages, communication sessions, or stored data.
; Symmetric data encryption key: These keys are used with symmetric key algorithms to apply confidentiality protection to information.
; Symmetric key wrapping key: Symmetric key wrapping keys are used to encrypt other keys using symmetric key algorithms. Key wrapping keys are also known as key encrypting keys.
; Symmetric and asymmetric random number generation keys: These are keys used to [[Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator|generate random numbers]].
; Symmetric master key: A symmetric master key is used to derive other symmetric keys (e.g., data encryption keys, key wrapping keys, or authentication keys) using symmetric cryptographic methods.
; Private key transport key: Private key transport keys are the private keys of asymmetric key pairs that are used to decrypt keys that have been encrypted with the associated public key using a public key algorithm. Key transport keys are usually used to establish keys (e.g., key wrapping keys, data encryption keys or [[message authentication code|MAC]] keys) and, optionally, other keying material (e.g., [[initialization vector]]s).
; Public key transport key: Public key transport keys are the public keys of asymmetric key pairs that are used to encrypt keys using a public key algorithm. These keys are used to establish keys (e.g., key wrapping keys, data encryption keys or MAC keys) and, optionally, other keying material (e.g., Initialization Vectors).
; Symmetric [[key-agreement protocol|key agreement]] key: These symmetric keys are used to establish keys (e.g., key wrapping keys, data encryption keys, or MAC keys) and, optionally, other keying material (e.g., Initialization Vectors) using a symmetric key agreement algorithm.
; Private static key agreement key: Private [[static key]] agreement keys are the private keys of asymmetric key pairs that are used to establish keys (e.g., key wrapping keys, data encryption keys, or MAC keys) and, optionally, other keying material (e.g., Initialization Vectors).
; Public static key agreement key: Public static key agreement keys are the public keys of asymmetric key pairs that are used to establish keys (e.g., key wrapping keys, data encryption keys, or MAC keys) and, optionally, other keying material (e.g., Initialization Vectors).
; Private ephemeral key agreement key: Private [[ephemeral key]] agreement keys are the private keys of asymmetric key pairs that are used only once to establish one or more keys (e.g., key wrapping keys, data encryption keys, or MAC keys) and, optionally, other keying material (e.g., Initialization Vectors).
; Public ephemeral key agreement key: Public ephemeral key agreement keys are the public keys of asymmetric key pairs that are used in a single key establishment transaction to establish one or more keys (e.g., key wrapping keys, data encryption keys, or MAC keys) and, optionally, other keying material (e.g., Initialization Vectors).
; Symmetric authorization key: Symmetric [[authorization]] keys are used to provide privileges to an entity using a symmetric cryptographic method. The authorization key is known by the entity responsible for monitoring and granting access privileges for authorized entities and by the entity seeking access to resources.
; Private authorization key: A private authorization key is the private key of an asymmetric key pair that is used to provide privileges to an entity.
; Public authorization key: A public authorization key is the public key of an asymmetric key pair that is used to verify privileges for an entity that knows the associated private authorization key.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3919">'''Cryptographic splitting''', also known as cryptographic bit splitting or cryptographic data splitting, is a technique for securing data over a computer network.  The technique involves encrypting data, splitting the encrypted data into smaller data units, distributing those smaller units to different storage locations, and then further encrypting the data at its new location.&lt;ref name=patent&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7391865.html |title=United States Patent 7391865: Secure data parser method and system |publisher=freepatentsonline.com |date=2008-06-24 |accessdate=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With this process, the data is protected from security breaches, because even if an intruder is able to retrieve and decrypt one data unit, the information would be useless unless it can be combined with decrypted data units from the other locations.

==History==
The technology was filed for patent consideration in June 2003, and the patent was granted in June 2008.&lt;ref name=patent/&gt;

==Technology==
Cryptographic splitting utilizes a combination of different algorithms to provide the data protection. A block of data is first encrypted using the [[AES-256]] government encryption standard.  The encrypted bits are then split into different shares and then each share is [[Cryptographic hash function|hashed]] using the [[National Security Agency]]'s [[SHA-256]] algorithm.&lt;ref name=unisys&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snia.org/sites/default/orig/sdc_archives/2009_presentations/wednesday/DavidDodgson_StorageSecurityUsingCryptographicSplitting-BU.pdf |title=Storage Security Using Cryptographic Splitting |first = David|last=Dodgson|publisher=snia.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
One application of cryptographic splitting is to provide security for [[cloud computing]].  The encrypted data subsets can be stored on different clouds, with the information required to restore the data being held on a [[private cloud]] for additional security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7019286/ |title=Enhanced security for multi-cloud storage using cryptographic data splitting with dynamic approach |publisher=ieee.org |date=2015-01-26 |accessdate=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Security vendor [[Security First Corp]] uses this technology for its Secure Parser Extended (SPx) product line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://security.cioreview.com/vendor/2016/security_first_corp. |title=Security First Corp.: SPx Technology|publisher=cioreview.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2009, technology services company [[Unisys]] gave a presentation about using cryptographic splitting with [[storage area networks]].  By splitting the data into different parts of the storage area network, this technique provided data redundancy in addition to security.&lt;ref name=unisys/&gt;

Computer giant [[IBM]] has written about using the technology as part of its Cloud Data Encryption Services (ICDES).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2015/10/a-billion-reasons-you-want-to-encrypt-your-data/?S_TACT=C34409NW&amp;S_TACT=C34409NW&amp;S_TACT=C34409NW&amp;S_TACT=C34409NW |title=Cloud computing news: Security|publisher=ibm.com |date=2015-10-21 |accessdate=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology has also been written about in the context of more effectively using sensitive corporate information, by entrusting different individuals within a company (trustees) with different parts of the information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/86b6/e830cab3e251584ea8057db23b9efc78ba35.pdf |title=Advanced techniques for knowledge management and access to strategic information |last= Ogiela|first= Lidia|publisher=semanticscholar.org|date= |accessdate=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marshal (Brazil)|Marshal]] '''Cândido Mariano da Silva Rondon''' (5 May 1865 – 19 January 1958) was a Brazilian military officer who is most famous for his exploration of [[Mato Grosso]] and the Western [[Amazon Basin]], and his lifelong support of Brazilian indigenous populations. He was the first director of Brazil's [[Fundação Nacional do Índio|Indian Protection Bureau]] (SPI/FUNAI) and supported the creation of the [[Xingu National Park]]. The Brazilian state of [[Rondônia]] is named after him.

==Biography==
===Early life===
He was born on 5 May 1865 in [[Santo Antônio do Leverger|Mimoso]], a small village in [[Mato Grosso]] state. His father, Cândido Mariano da Silva, was of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] ancestry, and his mother was a Native American from the [[Terena people|Terena]] and [[Bororo]]. His father died of smallpox before Cândido was born, and his mother died when he was two years old.&lt;ref&gt;Lucien Bodard,  Green Hell (New York, 1971)  p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  He was raised by his grandparents until they too died while he was still a boy.{{clarify|paternal or maternal?|date=April 2011}} After this, he lived with his mother's brother, who adopted Cândido and gave him his family name, Rondon.  His uncle raised him until he reached sixteen.&lt;ref&gt;Donald F. O'Reilly, "Rondon:  Biography of a Brazilian Republican Army Commander," New York University, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;  

After finishing high school at the age of 16, he taught elementary school for two years, and then joined the Brazilian army. He enrolled in the 3rd Regiment of Horse Artillery in 1881. Among other studies, he studied Mathematics and Physical and Natural Sciences of the [[:pt:Escola Superior de Guerra|Superior School of War]]. On joining the military, he entered officer's school and graduated in 1888 as a second lieutenant. He was also involved with the [[Decline and fall of Pedro II of Brazil#Republican coup|Republican coup]] that overthrew [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], the last [[List of Brazilian monarchs#Empire of Brazil .281822.E2.80.931889.29|Emperor of Brazil]].

===As an army engineer===
[[Image:Cândido Rondon.jpg|thumb|right|Rondon at the age of 24, exploring the [[Amazon basin]] as an army engineer]]
The republican government was worried about the western region of Brazil, very isolated from the great centers and in border regions. In 1890, he was commissioned as an army engineer with the Telegraphic commission, and helped build the first [[telegraph]] line across the state of [[Mato Grosso]]. This telegraph line was finally finished in 1895, and afterwards, Rondon started construction on a road that led from [[Rio de Janeiro]] (then capital of the republic) to [[Cuiabá]], the capital of Mato Grosso. Until this roadway was complete, the only way between these two cities was by river transport. Also during this time, he married his wife, Chiquinha Xavier. Together, they had 7 children. From 1900 to 1906, Rondon was in charge of laying telegraph line from Brazil to [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]]. During this time he opened up new territory, and was in contact with the warlike [[Bororo]] of western Brazil. He was so successful in pacifying the Bororo, that he completed the telegraph line with their help. Throughout his life, Rondon laid over 4,000 miles of telegraph line through the jungles of Brazil.

Marshall Rondon was honored with the title "Patron of the Communications Corps of the Brazilian Army", by Decree No. 51,960, of 26 April 1963.

===Explorations===
As a result of Rondon's competence in constructing telegraph lines, he was put in charge of extending the telegraph line from Mato Grosso to the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]]. In the course of constructing the line, he discovered the [[Juruena]] river, in northern Mato Grosso which is an important tributary of the [[Tapajós]] river along with the discovered the [[Nambikwara|Nambikwara tribe]], which had until then killed all Westerners they had come in contact with.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Daniel ed. Explorers and Discoverers of the World. Detroit: Gale Research, 1993 Pg 483&lt;/ref&gt; He also discovered the ruins of the [[Forte Príncipe da Beira|Real Forte Príncipe da Beira]], the greatest historical relic of [[Rondônia]] and was promoted as [[Major]] of the Corps of Military Engineers, responsible for building the [[Cuiabá]] telegraph line to Santo Antonio do Madeira, the first to reach the Amazon region, which was called the "Rondon Commission". His works developed from 1907 to 1915. At the same time, the ''Madeira-Mamoré railroad'' was being built, which together with the Rondon telegraphic exploration and integration helped to occupy the region of the present state of Rondônia.

In May 1909, Rondon set out on his longest expedition. He set out from the settlement of [[Tapirapuã]] in northern Mato Grosso heading northwest to meet up with the [[Madeira river]], which is a major tributary of the [[Amazon River]]. By August, the party had eaten all of its supplies, and had to subsist on what they could hunt and gather from the forest. By the time they reached the [[Ji-Paraná River]], they had no supplies. During their expedition they discovered a large river between the Juruena, and Ji-Paraná river, which Rondon named the [[River of Doubt]]. To reach the Madeira, they built canoes, and reached the Madeira on Christmas Day, 1909.

When Rondon reached Rio de Janeiro, he was hailed as a hero, because it was believed that he and the expedition had died in the jungle. After the expedition, he became the first director of the Brazilian Government's Indian Protection Agency, or the SPI.

In September 1913, Rondon was struck by a [[poisoned arrow]] from the [[Nambikwara]] Indians. In 1914, with the Rondon Commission, he built 372 km of lines and five more telegraph stations: ''Pimenta Bueno'', ''President Hermes'', ''Presidente Pena'' (later Vila de Rondônia and present Ji-Paraná), ''Jaru'' and ''Ariquemes'', in the area of the present state of Rondônia. On January 1, 1915, he completed his mission with the inauguration of the telegraph station in Santo Antônio do Madeira.

The [[52nd meridian west]] is also a geographical reference for the history of communications in Brazil. Rondon was the second human being to receive in his honor a meridian in his name. He fulfilled missions by opening roads, clearing lands, launching telegraph lines, mapping the land, and establishing cordial relations with the Indians. He maintained contact with several indigenous peoples.

===Expedition with Roosevelt===

[[File:River-doubt-team.jpg|thumb|250px|From left to right (seated): Father Zahm, Rondon, Kermit, Cherrie, Miller, four Brazilians, Roosevelt, Fiala. Photo taken in 1914.]]

In January 1914, Rondon left with [[Theodore Roosevelt]] on the Roosevelt-Rondon Scientific Expedition, whose aims were to explore the River of Doubt. The expedition left the Tapiripuã, and reached the River of Doubt on 27 February 1914. They did not reach the mouth of the river until late April, after the expedition had suffered greatly. During the expedition, the river was renamed the [[Rio Roosevelt]].

The Adventure down the River of Doubt was the most difficult of Roosevelt's life. All the men except Rondon suffered from ailments and constant maladies.

===Later life===
After the expedition of 1914, Rondon worked until 1919 mapping the state of Mato Grosso. During this time he discovered some more rivers, and made contact with several indigenous tribes. In 1919, he became chief of the Brazilian Corp of Engineers, and the head of the Telegraphic Commission.

In 1924 and 1925, he led army forces against a rebellion in the state of São Paulo. From 1927 to 1930, Rondon was put in charge of surveying all of the borders between Brazil and its neighbors. In 1930, he was interrupted by the [[History of Brazil (1930–1945)|Revolution of 1930]], and he resigned from his position as head of [[Serviço de Proteção ao Índio|SPI]]. During 1934–1938, he was in charge of a Diplomatic Mission, to mediate a dispute between Colombia and Peru over the town of [[Leticia, Colombia|Leticia]]. In 1939, he resumed his directorship of SPI, and expanded the service to new territories of Brazil. In the 1950s he supported the [[Villas Boas brothers]] campaign, which faced strong opposition from the government and the ranchers of Mato Grosso and led to the establishment of the [[Xingu National Park|first Brazilian National Park]] for indigenous people along the [[Xingu River]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/xingu/1541 From the first expedition to the creation of the Park], pib.socioambiental.org&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 5 May 1955, the date of his 90th birthday, he was awarded the title of Marshal of the [[Brazilian Army]], granted by the National Congress. 
In 1957, he was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] by the Explorers Club of [[New York (state)|New York]].
He died in 1958 in [[Rio de Janeiro]] at the age of 92.

Marshal Cândido Rondon is considered one of the foremost Brazilian heroes and patriots and has thus been honoured by population and government in many ways. He is the "Father of Brazilian Telecommunications" and 5 May is the National Day of Telecommunications, established in his honour.
Had the glory of having his name written in letters of gold in massive Book of the Geographical Society of New York.

==Positivism/Comtism==
From 1898 onward Rondon was an orthodox member of the ''Igreja Positivista do Brasil'' (Positivist Church of Brazil), which is a [[Religion of Humanity]] based in the thought of [[Auguste Comte]]. The creed he embraced from it emphasized [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], science, and altruism rather than any supernatural forces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vDHZJ433ficC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=%22positivist+church%22+brazil&amp;source=web&amp;ots=hQ8nhytmgT&amp;sig=v_-4WrrWtbHDmHF1tmoDnd1xNj0&amp;hl=en#PPA84,M1 Stringing Together a Nation: Candido Mariano da Silva Rondon and the ... By Todd A. Diacon: pgs 83–84]&lt;/ref&gt;

''"I believe:
That man and the world are governed by natural laws.
That science has integrated man into the universe, enlarging the unity constituted by the woman, thus creating modest and sublime: sympathy for all beings of whom, as poverello, feels brother.
That science, establishing the inattention (born feeling) of love, like that of selfishness, gave man the possession of himself. And the means of transforming and perfecting oneself.
That Science, Art, and Industry will transform the Earth into Paradise, for all men, without distinction of races, beliefs, nations: banished the specters of war, of misery, of disease.
That along with selfish forces - to be reduced to means of preserving the individual and the species - exist in the heart of man: treasures of love that life in society will sublimate more and more.
In the laws of Sociology, founded by Augusto Comte, and why the mission of the intellectuals is, above all, the preparation of the human masses: disadvantaged, so that they rise, so that they can be incorporated into Society.
That, being sometimes incompatible with the interests of the Order with those of Progress, everything must be resolved in the light of Love.
That material order must be maintained, above all, because of women, the best part of all countries and children, the homelands of the future.
That in the current state of anxiety, the solution is to let the thought free as the breath, promote the Religious League,: converging all to Love, the Common Good, set aside the disagreements that will remain in each as intimate forum issues, Without disturbing the splendid unity - which is true happiness."''

{{Politics|expanded=Policy}}
'''Domestic policy''' are administrative decisions that are directly related to all issues and activity within a [[nation]]'s borders. It differs from [[foreign policy]], which refers to the ways a advances its interests in world politics. Domestic policy covers a wide range of areas, including [[business]], education, energy, healthcare, 
[[law enforcement]], money and [[taxes]], [[Natural resource management|natural resources]], social welfare, and personal rights and freedoms.

==Issues==

Many domestic policy debates concern the appropriate level of government involvement in economic and social affairs. Traditionally, conservatives believe that the government should not play a major role in regulating business and managing the economy. Most conservatives also believe that government action cannot solve the problems of [[poverty]] and [[economic inequality]]. Most liberals, however, support government programs that seek to provide economic security, ease human suffering, and reduce inequality. Many liberals also believe that the government should regulate businesses to ensure safe and fair working conditions and to limit environmental pollution.

Certain domestic policy issues are especially controversial among people of different cultures, religions, and personal beliefs. Examples of such issues include [[Abortion-rights movements|abortion rights]], the [[Homosexual rights|rights of homosexuals]], the role of religion in public life, and the place of cultural diversity in education and employment.

==Shaping and implementing domestic policy==

A nation's form of government largely determines how its domestic policy is formed and implemented. Under authoritarian governments, a ruling group may pursue its domestic policy goals without the input or consent of the people being governed. But in democratic societies, the will of the people has a much greater influence.

In a democracy, the formal design of domestic policy is chiefly the responsibility of elected leaders, lawmaking bodies, and specialized government agencies. But a number of other factors also play a role in the process. Voters, for instance, determine which individuals and political parties have the power to determine policy. The mass media distribute, and opine, information about domestic issues and influence the beliefs and opinions of the people. Lobbyists, activist groups, and other organizations also work to influence policy through a variety of methods. Such methods may include monetary donations, promises of support, advertising campaigns, or demonstrations and protests. How many people do we personally know that are involved with domestic policy creation? 

The effectiveness of domestic policy depends on the government bureaucracy (system of agencies) that puts laws and programs into action. In some cases, bureaucracies act slowly or inefficiently, or fail to apply policies as they were originally intended. Domestic policy may also face challenges in the courts. In many countries, courts have the power of judicial review, which allows them to strike down any legislative or executive action that they find in violation of the nation's constitution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11097">'''Download Valley''' is a cluster of software companies in [[Israel]], producing and delivering [[adware]] to be installed alongside downloads of other software.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/06/04/hate-pop-up-ads-microsoft-tries-drawing-line-in-the-sand/ Hate Pop-Up Ads? Microsoft Tries Drawing Line in the Sand ] - Wall Street Journal, 4 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary purpose is to [[Software business|monetize]] shareware and downloads. These software items are commonly browser toolbars, [[adware]],  [[Browser hijacking|browser hijackers]], [[spyware]], and [[malware]]. Another group of products are [[download manager]]s, possibly designed to induce or trick the user to install adware, when downloading a piece of desired software or mobile app from a certain source.

The term does not refer to an actual geographical region or valley, but is a pun based on [[Silicon Valley]], and the common practice of using downloads to deliver bundled software to users. Many of the companies are located in [[Tel Aviv]] and the surrounding region. It has been used by Israeli media,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/business/.premium-1.542896 Game over in Download Valley?] Haaretz, Inbal Orpaz, Orr Hirschauge, August 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in other reports related to IT business.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304547704579563281761548844 Conduit Diversifies Away From 'Download Valley'] Wall Street Journal, Orr Hirschauge, updated May 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Download managers from Download Valley companies have been used by major download portals and software hosts, including [[Download.com]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calcalist.co.il/internet/articles/0,7340,L-3600064,00.html 3. IronSource, Downloads Ltd] Calcalist, Assaf Gilad. April 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; by [[CNET]], [[Softonic.com]] and [[SourceForge]].

==Economy==

The smaller adware companies SweetPacks and SmileBox were purchased by the larger company Perion Networks for $41 million and $32 million. [[iBario]] claimed to be worth $100 million&lt;ref name="iBarioTimesOfIsrael"&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/meet-ibario-israels-100-million-internet-empire/ Meet iBario, Israel's $100 million Internet empire] Times of Israel, David Shamah, May 19, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; in early 2014. Conduit was valued at $1.4 billion by [[JPMorgan Chase|JP Morgan]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="pandoConduitIsraelsFirstBillionDollar"&gt;[http://pando.com/2012/04/09/conduit-israels-first-billion-dollar-internet-company/ Conduit, Israel’s First Billion Dollar Internet Company] Pandodaily, Mick Weinstein, April 9, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Revenues are frequently near $100 million to several $100 million for large companies (Perion: $87 million in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[[Perion Network]] Perion Network on Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt; Conduit: claimed $500 million in 2012&lt;ref name="pandoConduitIsraelsFirstBillionDollar"/&gt;), with much lower operating and net income (Perion: $3.88 million operating, $310.000 net income in 2013).

All these numbers are highly volatile, since technical and legal preconditions quickly change profit opportunities. In 2013 and 2014, changes in web browsers to prevent unwanted toolbar installs and a new policy by Microsoft towards advertising&lt;ref name="wsjHatePopUpAdsMicrosoftDrawingLine"&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/06/04/hate-pop-up-ads-microsoft-tries-drawing-line-in-the-sand/ Hate Pop-Up Ads? Microsoft tries drawing line in the sand] Wall Street Journal, Orr Hirschauge, June 4, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; lead to the expectation that the main profit methods of the companies would soon work no longer. The Perion stock lost roughly two thirds of its value during 2014, from over $13.25 in January to $4.53 on December 29.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perion.com/stock-performance/ Perion stock, chart page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adware==

Many of the products may be designed in a way to install while not being solicited by the user who downloads the desired product, and to create revenue from software usually distributed as free. For this, they may use invasive and harmful techniques.

To achieve installs, such installers may:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DownloadWrappersAndUnwantedSoftwareArePureEvil.aspx Download Wrappers and Unwanted Software are pure evil] Scott Hanselman, February 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://insecure.org/news/download-com-fiasco.html Download.com Caught Adding Malware to Nmap &amp; Other Software] insecure.org&lt;/ref&gt;

* not show information on potentially harmful actions, or hide it in [[fine print]] and [[End-user license agreement|EULAs]], where they are overlooked by most users expecting only their desired program.
* use deceptive menus, suggesting the adware to be the main program or part of it, or pretending to show the main program's EULA, to obtain an "accept" click to install unwanted software.
* request rights for full system access, suggesting to be necessary for the main program's installation.
* install unwanted software without asking or although the user rejected an install.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groovypost.com/howto/avoid-computer-bloatware-from-cnet-download-com-crapware/ CNET Joins the Dark Side, its Download.com Attempts to Fill Your Computer With Crapware] Groovypost, Austin Ruthruff, July 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* use [[Hacker (computer security)|hacks]]&lt;ref name="GenieoMacKeychainMalwBy"&gt;[https://blog.malwarebytes.org/mac/2015/08/genieo-installer-tricks-keychain/ Genieo installer tricks keychain] Malwarebytes unpacked, Thomas Reed, August 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Exploit (computer security)|exploits]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.malwarebytes.org/mac/2015/08/dyld_print_to_file-exploit-found-in-the-wild/ DYLD_PRINT_TO_FILE exploit found in the wild] Malwarebytes unpacked, Thomas Reed, August 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; for unauthorized access to confidential data and system modifications.

Installed adware frequently attempts to hide its identity, prevent disabling, removal or restoring of previous settings, spy on the user's system and browsing habits, download and install further, unwanted software or open [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoors]] for possibly malicious attacks.

Many security software vendors list these products in the category of [[potentially unwanted program]]s&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.malwarebytes.org/fraud-scam/2014/12/potentially-unwanted-program-borrows-tricks-from-malware-authors/ Potentially Unwanted Program borrows tricks from malware authors], Malwarebytes unpacked (blog), Jérôme Segura, December 31, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcafee.com/cn/resources/white-papers/wp-potentially-unwanted-programs-spyware-adware.pdf Potentially Unwanted Programs, Spyware and Adware] McAfee Whitepater, October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; (PUP, also PUS or PUA&lt;ref&gt;[http://kb.eset.com/esetkb/index?page=content&amp;id=SOLN2629 What is a potentially unwanted application?] ESET Home Support, September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;) or [[Malware#Grayware|grayware]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/grayware-casting-shadow-over-mobile-software-marketplace Grayware: Casting a Shadow over the Mobile Software Marketplace] Symantec, Dick O'Brien, February 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and offer detection and removal. This category is distinct from genuine malware and used for software from companies who can, as opposed to criminal underground programmers, threaten with or practice litigation.

In 2013, the Download Valley company iBario was accused, by security software vendor [[Trend Micro]], of distributing the Sefnit/[[Mevade Botnet|Mevade]] malware through an installer and being related to a Ukrainian company considered immediately responsible for the malware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/when-adware-go-bad-the-installbrain-and-sefnit-connection/ When Adware Goes Bad: The InstallBrain and Sefnit connection] Trend Micro, July 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.trendmicro.com/research-ties-sefnitmevade-malware-ukraine-ibario-israel/ Research Ties Sefnit/Mevade Malware To Ukraine/iBario in Israel] Trend Micro, updated August 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security software circumvention===

An unnamed Download Valley executive admitted to the ''Wall Street Journal''&lt;ref name="wsjHatePopUpAdsMicrosoftDrawingLine"/&gt; that some companies employ teams of up to 15 developers to break through security suites that try to block their software.

{{History of Algeria}}

The '''Emirate of Abdelkader''', '''Emir Abdelkader Resistance''', or '''Emir Abdelkader State''', was founded by [[Emir Abdelkader]] with the allegiance of the [[Algerian people]] to resist the [[French conquest of Algeria|French invasion]].

== Government ==

The system of government was simple and analogous to the regime of the [[dey]]s of [[Algiers]].&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Koulakssis and Gilbert Meynier, L'emir Khaled: premier zaʼîm? : identité algérienne et colonialisme français, L'Harmattan, January 1, 1987 ({{ISBN|9782858028597}}, [https://books.google.dz/books?id=mpzfDc9t4PAC&amp;redir_esc=y read online])&lt;/ref&gt; However, it corresponded to a profound revision of the doctrine of power to a more egalitarian basis. The emir was head of the state, and governed with his [[divan]] or council of ministers. He was assisted by a [[majlis]], an advisory council of wise personalities, [[ulama]]s and [[khalifa]]s representing the provinces and presided over by a [[qadi|qâdî al qudât]].&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Koulakssis and Gilbert Meynier, L'emir Khaled: premier zaʼîm? : identité algérienne et colonialisme français, L'Harmattan, 1 January 1987 ({{ISBN|9782858028597}}, 
 [https://books.google.dz/books?id=mpzfDc9t4PAC read online])&lt;/ref&gt; Algeria was divided by the emir into eight khalifalik, themselves subdivided into aghalik which grouped several caïdats. This division took into account local influences and history, especially on the tribal level.&lt;ref&gt;Mahfoud Kaddache, L’Algérie des Algériens, de la Préhistoire à 1954, EDIF, 2000, p. 598&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic policy ==

The emir very early attached importance to the structuring of an economy perceived as necessary, for the perpetuation of his state. He set up a number of factories and industries in Tagdemt, his new capital. Thus, the local production of the necessary goods, especially the war effort,&lt;ref&gt;Mahfoud Kaddache, L’Algérie des Algériens, de la Préhistoire à 1954, EDIF, 2000, p. 603&lt;/ref&gt; was accorded great importance. The cities of [[Tlemcen]], Mascara, [[Miliana]], Medea and [[Tagdemt]] make the necessary powder. [[Tagdemt]] and [[Miliana]] had foundries and weapon factory. There is also a desire to regulate the souks with greater surveillance and security of the sites and the transportation routes to promote [[trade]]. Agriculture was encouraged, with the suppression of the kharadj to encourage the [[fellah]]s and the utilization of periods of truce. Finally, the emir set up a currency struck at Tagdempt to ensure the financial autonomy of the state in 1834 to 1841.&lt;ref&gt;Abdelkader Boutaleb, L'émir Abd-el-Kader et la formation de la nation algérienne: de l'émir Abd-el-Kader à la guerre de libération, Editions Dahlab, 1er janvier 1990 ([https://books.google.dz/books?id=vexAAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y read online])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military structure ==
&lt;!-- unreliable source? &lt;ref&gt;http://emiratedz.blogspot.com/2013/08/military-structure.html&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

The emir realized that the power of the state is reflected in the military strength of the state; also it gives a great image to the state. The Emir used the military to enforce order and security throughout the Emirate in order to stop the chaos that spread in the country after the fall of Turkish rule in Algeria.
When the Emir established the Emirate social organization in Algeria was based mainly on tribes, so the individuals were only attached to their tribes; the idea of nationalism was not known at that time. In war or conflict the tribes gathered together with their men and cavalry then go to war. Afterwards the men immediately returned to their tribes and continue with their daily work; military service was not applied with the tribes. The regular army of the emir was formed by volunteers. Recruitment was meant for young people from all regions and all tribes, called for jihad (Holy War) against the French invaders. Recruitment had no requirements and is for all ages and in all regions of the Emirate.
The emir organized an army to protect the Emirate because he knew that he would confront French armies that were better-trained and better-equipped,commanded by experienced officers and generals. The emir was the first leader to establish a national army in the modern history of Algeria. He also built factories to manufacture weapons using the experience of the French, Spaniards and Italians.

[[File:Military laws of The first Algerian resistance.jpg|thumb|Military laws of the first Algerian resistance]]

He called his army Jaish Al-Mohammadi (Mohammad’s Army) divided into three divisions: infantry, cavalry and artillery. Then he developed military law regarding discipline, recruitment, policies, salaries and weapons. The Jaish Al-Mohammadi was formed of 8,000 soldiers, 2,000 cavalry, 22,40 light cannons and 20 heavy cannons.

*Khayala (Cavalry): soldiers who fought on horseback
*Moushat (Infantry): soldiers fighting on foot
*Tobajiya (Artillery): soldiers who have cannons. The artillery unit soldiers of the Jaish Al-Mohammadi were deserters from the French army, Turks and [[Kouloughlis]]. They were experienced in maintaining light and heavy cannons. Each artillery unit had twelve soldiers.
**Irregular: 10,240

=== Uniform ===
Emir Abdelkader classed a unique uniform for each type of soldier, the cloth was linen and gasket.{{what|date=February 2018}} It consisted of a jacket of grey wool including a hood and trousers also made from wool are in blue also Sedria (vest) are in red. Every three months a soldier was given a shirt and a pair of shoes, yellow leather including a burnous (long cloak made from wool).
The Cavalry uniform consisted of a red jacket with black stripes on the sleeve seams and back, also a red vest decorated with blue hair{{what|date=February 2018}} on it. Each cavalryman was giving a haik which covered his head and shoulders, made from camel’s hair including a turban.

" لَا شَيْء أَكْثَرُ فَائِدَة مِنْ التَّقْوَى وَالشَّجَاعَةَ "
(“Nothing is more beneficial than piety and courage”)

=== Weapons ===
Each soldier had a leather bag which could be worn on a belt over the right shoulder, also a rifle with a bayonet, pistols and a yatagan (curved blade) attached to his belt, the cavalryman is armed with a rifle, yatagan and a pistol.

=== Food ===
For food each soldier received 2 Kesra (Algerian bread) and a kilogram of flour and [[semolina]] to cook [[couscous]] twice a week, also a group of 20 men shared a sheep between them.

=== Wages ===
The wage of a soldier was paid from April to June monthly depending on rank:

* Agha (General) 22 Boudjous
* Sayaf (First Lieutenant) 12 Boudjous
* Rais Sayaf (Lieutenant) 8 Boudjous
* Jaouche (Corporal) 7 Boudjous
* Khaba (Captain) 6 Boudjous

Boudjou: a currency used by the Turks in Algeria
1 Boudjou = 50 Mohammadia

* Katiba (Battalion) – 1000 men – commanded by Agha
* Sariya (Company) – 100 men – commanded by Sayaf
* Fasela (Platoon) – 35 men – commanded by Khaba

He also sought to import weapons from the only country that opposed the French invasion of Algeria, England, but failed. The Emir endeavoured to build an arsenal of ammunition and weapons, both in Mascara and Takdempt with the assistance from foreign expertise so the Emir hired men with industrial experience in making weapons like the Spaniards, Italians and also French, the Emir also choose the best strategic locations that are fully fortified like the city of Miliana which he built an weaponry factory in its suburbs so he can manufacture ammunition and weapons.

The emir’s factory started to manufacture Algerian weapons. The Algerian Army used weapons captured by the Emir’s army from the French. Emir Abdelkader trained his army well and also set up special military combat and tactics, he also benefited from geographical locations like mountains and fields. The Emir always used to ambush the enemy forces and attack them surprisely this tactic which is known today as “guerrilla warfare”.

== Provinces of the Emirate ==

Abdelkader divided his emirate into administrative provinces to facilitate management and ease the burden on the central government.&lt;ref&gt;Provinces of the Emirate [http://emiratedz.blogspot.com/2013/07/establishment-of-emirate.html (read online)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;الأمير يبني الدولة ، ختم كاتب الدوان [http://bayadasouf39.yoo7.com/t1009-topic (read online (arabic)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each province was divided into districts which divides into groups of tribes. The head of a district was called Agha and the Sheikh was the head of a group of tribes.

== Flag and emblem ==

== Administration ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}

=== Education ===
Education was a primary concern of the Emir. He was confident that developing in this field is to take care of books and references whatever the value of it scientific, literary and therefore the Emir was trying his best to collecting books from different subjects like buying, copying or transporting them.

[[File:Manuscripts Emirate of Abdelkader.jpg|right|thumb|Manuscripts Emirate of Abdelkader.]]

The Emir also issued strict orders to his soldiers not to mishandle or disrespect the books and breaking these orders would be punished severely. He also used to encourage by rewarding them for any one that brings a book or the author, to copy one manuscript it would take several months to copy it and this was a long time for the Emir because his Emirate was in war with French invaders.

This policy had great success in bringing books from different fields to his emirate, the Emir also build a library to store and organize these books that he has gathered but he also linked the library with many organizations in the emirate like schools, masjids and Zawiya (religious schools), the library was open to everyone students, scholars and even soldiers. He also used to store a huge number of manuscripts in the Takdempt Fortress where he used to keep not only manuscripts but also classified state documents and diplomatic letters.

[[File:Manuscripts 'Emirate of Abdelkader'.jpg|right|thumb|Manuscripts 'Emirate of Abdelkader']]

The emir took care of books and manuscripts even in war; he transported all the books and manuscripts that had been stored in Takdempt fortress to Smala after the Takdempt fortress fell to French invaders, but in 1843 French soldiers seized the books and manuscripts when Smala fell. The Emir also chose qualified teachers to develop education in the emirate, supported the teachers financially and morally and gave them wages to them depending on their qualification as he also build schools across his emirate in villages, towns and cities.

=== Judicial system ===
After establishing the emirate and dividing it administratively, the emir appointed in every region a [[Qadi]] (religious judge) who would rule in accordance with Islamic religious law (sharia) on the doctrine of [[Imam Malik]]. Justice is the basis of governance, so he set requirements for judges: to be honest, just, chaste and practise Islam. To ensure that the judiciary ran well, the Emir paid each judge a respectable monthly wage of 100 Douro (50 Francs) and additional payments based on the type of case he judged. The Emir separated the civil and military judiciary, then appointed for each department a special judge to decides the issues and cases. The judge could be elected for one year only.

The emir also recruited two clerics for all regional councils. The senior cleric studied [[fatwa]]s (legal judgments) issued by the judge of a particular region then he sent them to Mascara for deeper study. Then the Emir linked all the judges in the regions to review their cases with Supreme Qadi Ahmed ben Al-Hashemi Al-Mrahi.

The Emir was also keen for the provisions of the civil and military judiciary to come under Sharia (Islamic religious law) which the Emir made the main source and the only source for rule in his Emirate. Its provisions derive from the Quran, Sunnah (teachings and practices of Muhammad) and ijtihad (Islamic diligence) and remind the people of the days of Rashidun Caliphate and also wipe out the bad taste from Turkish rule in Algeria. He considered the success of the new established Emirate to have been removing the corruption inherited from the Turks and working to change the old relations and unify the Algerian people. This policy met with a success which united the Algerian people under his Emirate so he later was able to face the French invasion of his country.

Immediately and especially if there was a threat against the homeland, like dealing with an enemy, response to threats intended to deter others, with no appeal. “He who helps the enemy financially will be financially punished (fines) and the one who helps the enemy physically will be punished by cutting off their heads (executions),” he said.

And so in justice and security, people lived peacefully under the flag of a popular national emirate, crime vanished and calm returned after the chaos that had followed the fall of Turkish rule in Algeria. The emir also fought ethical corruption in society, banning prostitution, drinking alcohol and drugs across his emirate, as he also banned the soldiers from playing cards and wearing gold and silver except in their weapons and horses and also ordered them to pray at the masjid.

The Emir said “Know that the only purpose of my acceptance of this position (Emir) only that you will be safe on yourselves and your honour and your wealth assured on your country enjoying your religious duties and I cannot reach that except with your help by money or men.”&lt;ref&gt;Emirate of Abdelkader ,Administration in the Emirate [http://emiratedz.blogspot.com/2013/07/administration-in-emirate.html (read online)]&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliablesource|date=November 2018}}

'''Fascist syndicalism''' (related to [[national syndicalism]]) was a trade syndicate movement (''syndicat'' means trade union in French) that rose out of the pre-World War II provenance of the [[revolutionary syndicalism]] movement led mostly by [[Edmondo Rossoni]], [[Sergio Panunzio]], [[Angelo Oliviero Olivetti| A. O. Olivetti]], [[Michele Bianchi]], [[Alceste De Ambris]], [[Paolo Orano]], Massimo Rocca, and Guido Pighetti, under the influence of French Marxist [[Georges Sorel]],&lt;ref&gt;A. James Gregor, ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton University Press, 1979, p.172&lt;/ref&gt; who was considered the “‘metaphysician’ of syndicalism.”&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Jennings, ''Syndicalism in France: A Study of Ideas'', Palgrave Macmillan, 1990, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Fascist Syndicalists differed from other branches of syndicalism in that they generally favored class struggle, worker-controlled factories and hostility to industrialists, which lead historians to portray them as “leftist fascist idealists” who “differed radically from right fascists.”&lt;ref&gt;David D. Roberts, ''The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism'', University of North Carolina Press, 1979 p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; Generally considered one of the more radical Fascist syndicalists in Italy, Rossoni was the “leading exponent of fascist syndicalism.”&lt;ref&gt;Jabbari, Pierre, ''Laroque and the Welfare State in Postwar France'', Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;, and sought to infuse nationalism with “class struggle.”&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Hugh Adler, ''Italian Industrialists from Liberalism to Fascism: The Political Development of the Industrial Bourgeoisie, 1906-1934'', Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;
 
== Revolutionary syndicalism to national syndicalism ==
 
Sometimes considered the “father” of revolutionary syndicalism or at least “the leading figure amongst the French Syndicalists”,&lt;ref&gt; Spencer M. Di Scala, Emilio Gentile, edits., ''Mussolini 1883-1915: Triumph and Transformation of a Revolutionary Socialist'', New York, NY, Palgrave Macmillan, 2016, Chap. 5,  Marco Gervasoni, “Mussolini and Revolutionary Syndicalism,” p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Ramsay McDonald, ''Syndicalism: A Critical Examination'', London, UK, Constable &amp; Co. Ltd., 1912, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;Georges Sorel supported militant trade unionism to combat the corrupting influences of parliamentary parties and politics, even if the legislators were distinctly socialist. As a French Marxist who supported Lenin, Bolshevism and Mussolini concurrently in the early 1920s,&lt;ref&gt; “For Lenin,” Soviet Russia, Official Organ of The [[Russian Soviet Government Bureau]], Vol. II, New York: NY, January-June 1920 (April 10, 1920), p. 356&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[Jacob L. Talmon]], ''The Myth of the Nation and the Vision of Revolution: The Origins of Ideological Polarization in the 20th Century'', University of California Press (1981) p. 451. Sorel’s March 1921 conversations with Jean Variot, published in Variot’s ''Propos de Georges Sorel'', (1935) Paris, pp. 53-57, 66-86 passim&lt;/ref&gt; Sorel promoted the cause of the proletariat in class struggle, and the “catastrophic polarization” that would arise through social myth-making of general strikes.&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'', Princeton, New Jersey, USA: Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; The intention of syndicalism was to organize strikes to abolish capitalism, not to supplant it with State socialism, but rather to build a society of worker-class producers, which Sorel regarded as “truly true” in Marxism.&lt;ref&gt; Georges Sorel, ''Reflections on Violence'', edited and intro by Jeremy Jennings,  Cambridge Texts of the History of Political Thought, Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In his 1908 book, '' [[Reflections on Violence]]'', Sorel provided the justification for ''syndicats'' as an effort to organize workers in violent uprisings, to convince workers not to be ashamed of acts of violence, and that they should be scornful of “politics, the Republic and patriotism.”&lt;ref&gt; Georges Sorel, ''Reflections on Violence'', edited and intro by Jeremy Jennings, Cambridge Texts of the History of Political Thought, Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. 35, p. viii,&lt;/ref&gt; In this Sorelian sense, the violence associated with Marxist class struggle, could be interpreted as fine, heroic and in the service of the “immemorial interest of civilization.”&lt;ref&gt;Georges Sorel, ''Reflections on Violence'', Free Press, 1950, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Many European socialists joined the ranks of the revolutionary syndicalists, including [[Benito Mussolini]], who claimed that he had succumbed to revolutionary syndicalism by 1904, citing that it occurred during a general strike, although he had been involved with syndicalism earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'', Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;
 
By 1909, Sorel became disappointed over the compromising policies of socialist parliamentarians, the movement towards democratic socialism and the decadence of the proletariat who were seduced by the “mirage of enormous economic benefits.”&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution, Princeton University Press'', 1994, pp. 77-78&lt;/ref&gt; In Sorel’s opinion, the proletariat was neither responding to his expectations of revolutionary change nor the dreams of Marx’s “magnificent epic.”&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'', Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; This reassessment of Marxism led Sorel to adopt [[Benedetto Croce]]’s aphorism that “Socialism is dead.”&lt;ref&gt;John L. Stanley, editor with introduction, ''From Georges Sorel: Essays in Socialism &amp; Philosophy'', New York, NY, Oxford University Press, 1976, Georges Sorel,  chap. 7, “Materials for a Theory of the Proletariat,” p. 227. ''Materials for a Theory of the Proletariat'' was originally published as a book in 1919, Paris: Rivière&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, many of Sorel’s criticisms and writings about socialism were in response to the profound “[[crisis of Marxism]].”&lt;ref&gt; Jan-Werner Müller, ''Contesting Democracy: Political Ideas in Twentieth-Century Europe'', Yale University Press, 2011, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;, where he, according to [[Antonio Labriola]], expounds on it with gusto and converted this “crisis into one of socialism.”&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Labriola, ''Socialism and Philosophy'', Chicago, IL, Charles H. Keer &amp; Company, 1907, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;
 
To Sorel, the integrity and intellectualism of Marxism was decomposing, and the “heroic proletariat” appeared to have been either non-existent or shown to be as “much corrupted by utilitarianism as the bourgeoisie.”&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'', Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sorel, the power of democratic-republican governments was debasing the revolutionary initiative of the worker class which forced him to search for other alternatives, including a nationalism, but one devoid of any  monarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Jennings, ''Syndicalism in France: A Study of Ideas'', Palgrave Macmillan, 1990, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; In order to resolve this crisis of socialism, Sorel turned toward an anti-democratic socialism that encompasses a radical nationalism, while still holding to his support of worker-owned factories, but under a heretic Marxism divested of it “materialistic and rationalistic essence.”&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'', Princeton University Press, 1994, pp. 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1909, Sorel published an article in Enrico Leone’s ''Il Divenire sociale'', an influential journal of revolutionary syndicalism in Italy, which was later reprinted and championed by [[Charles Maurras]] in the ''[[Action française | L’Action française]]'' entitled “Antiparliamentary Socialist.”&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Jennings, ''Syndicalism in France: A Study of Ideas'', Palgrave Macmillan, 1990, pp. 104-105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Georges Sorel, “Socialistes antiparlementaires, Un article de M. Georges Sorel,” ''L’Action Francaise'', Aug. 22, 1909&lt;/ref&gt; Sorel was not the first to drift towards nationalism and syndicalism. During the years of 1902 to 1910 a cadre of Italian revolutionary syndicalists had embarked on a mission to combine Italian nationalism with syndicalism. They were later to become “founders of the Fascist movement,” and “held key posts” in Mussolini's regime.&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'', Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, Italian syndicalism finally coalesced into national syndicalism during World War I and the months following the 1918 armistice.&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'', Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Maurras welcomed Sorel’s support in that they both were concerned over French socialism reaching the path of no return in its rush towards “democratization,” coalescing into a formidable Social Democracy movement.&lt;ref&gt; Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'', Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; To Maurras, the purity of socialism had to abstain from being captured by seduction of democracy, &lt;ref&gt;Charles Maurras, ''L’Action française'', Nov. 15, 1900, p. 863&lt;/ref&gt; declaring that “socialism liberated from the democratic and cosmopolitan element fits nationalism well as a well made glove fits a beautiful hand.”&lt;ref&gt;Douglas R. Holmes, Integral Europe: Fast-Capitalism, Multiculturalism, Neofascism, Princeton University Press, 2000, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; But such thoughts were not unusual for many European socialists during this period, such as [[Philippe Buchez]] and [[Ferdinand Lassalle]] who “despised democracy and exalted the nation.”&lt;ref&gt; François Furet, ''The Passing of an Illusion: The Idea of Communism in the Twentieth Century'', University of Chicago Press (1999) p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his  aversion to democracy, Sorel and the syndicalists rejected political parties and democratic institutions as well as the “Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat,”&lt;ref&gt;Charles F. Delzell, edit., ''Mediterranean Fascism 1919-1945'', New York, NY, Walker and Company, 1971, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;but remained dutiful to [[Karl Marx]]’s opposition to democracy and elections. Earlier, Marx had confessed that his revolutionary activities in the [[Revolution of 1848]] was “nothing but a plan of war against democracy.”&lt;ref&gt; Karl Marx: Letter to Engels, July 13, 1851. Leopold Schwarzschild, ''Karl Marx: The Red Prussian'', New York: NY, The Universal Library, Grosset &amp; Dunlap, 1947, p. 171, pp. 187-188&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In an attempt to save Marxism, Sorel gravitated towards the creation of a synthesis of populism and nationalism that also included “the crudest of anti-Semitism.”&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, ''Neither Right nor Left: Fascist Ideology in France'', Princeton University Press, 1996, pp. 79-80&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Sorel and other syndicalists concluded that proletarian violence was ineffectual since the “proletariat was incapable of fulfilling its revolutionary role,”&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, ''Neither Right nor Left: Fascist Ideology in France'', Princeton University Press, 1996, pp. 80-81&lt;/ref&gt; an assessment that persuaded many to see the nation-state as the best means by which to establish a proletarian-based society, which later congealed into the fascist concept of [[proletarian nation |proletarian nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Talmon, ''The Myth of the Nation and the Vision of Revolution: The Origins of Ideological Polarization'', Berkeley and Los Angeles, California, USA: University of California Press, 1981, p. 484&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Many revolutionary syndicalists followed Sorel and his [[Sorelianism| Sorelian socialism]] towards the allure of a radical nationalism after he praised Maurras and displayed his sympathies for French [[integral nationalism]] in 1909.&lt;ref&gt; Franz Leopold Neumann, ''Behemoth: The Structure and Practice of National Socialism, 1933-1944'', Chicago, IL, Ivan R. Dee, 2009, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'', Princeton, New Jersey, USA: Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal that Charles Maurras presented was his nationalistic approach against bourgeois democracy, the Enlightenment, and “its liberalism, its individualism, and its conception of society as an aggregate of individuals.” &lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'', Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; This trend continued and by 1911, revolutionary syndicalists had acknowledged that two important antirational political currents had come together, forging “a new nationalism and revolutionary socialism.”&lt;ref&gt;A. James Gregor, ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; This coalescence finally surfaced as a major facet of [[Italian Fascism]], where Mussolini himself confessed: “What I am, I owe to Sorel.” The Israeli historian [[Zeev Sternhell]], considered a leading expert on fascism, asserted that this integration of syndicalism with unpatriotic nationalism was a factor in why “Italian revolutionary syndicalism became the backbone of fascist ideology.”&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell, ''Neither Left nor Right: Fascist Ideology in France'', Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;
 
== Fascist syndicalism and productivism ==
 
Mussolini was one of the first to comingle the phrase fascism with syndicalism, remarking in the early 1920s that “Fascist syndicalism is national and productivistic… in a national society in which labor becomes a joy, an object of pride and a title to nobility.”&lt;ref&gt;A. James Gregor, ''The Faces of Janus: Marxism and Fascism in the Twentieth Century'', Yale University Press, 1999, p. 216, footnote 42, Mussolini “Commento” in  ''Opera omnia'', vol. 18, pp. 228-229&lt;/ref&gt; Most Italian syndicalists viewed social revolution as a means for rapid transformation to provide “superior productivity,” and if this economic abundance failed to occur, there could be no meaningful social change.&lt;ref&gt;James Gregor, ''The Faces of Janus: Marxism and Fascism in the Twentieth Century'', Yale University Press, 1999, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;  The emphasis by syndicalists towards the importance of “productivism” had been originally initiated by Sorel in 1907, who argued that  “Marx considers that a revolution by a proletariat of producers who [have] acquired economic capacity.”&lt;ref&gt;A. James Gregor, ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Carlo Cafiero]] developed a compendium for the initial volume of Capital in Italian, Marx reminded his colleague that “material conditions necessary for the emancipation of the proletariat” must be “spontaneously generated by the development of capitalism (''den Gang der kapitalistischen Produktion'').”&lt;ref&gt;A. James Gregor, ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marx to Carlo Cafiero, July 29, 1879, ''Werke'', XXXIV, 384. Compare “Lettera di Marx a Cafiero,” Carlo Cafiero, ''Compendio del capitate'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The support for the theory of productionism expanded among Fascist syndicalists after Lenin expropriated most of the private sector in Soviet Russia, causing the economy to collapse, high unemployment and an environment where “most of the mills and factories were at a standstill; mines and collieries were wrecked and flooded.”&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)'', Chapter Nine: “The Bolshevik Party in the Period of Transition to the Peaceful Work of Economic Restoration (1921-1925)”. This book was commissioned by Stalin in 1935, who considered himself as its editor. The main authors were Vilhelms Knoriņš, Yemelyan Yaroslavsky and Pyotr Pospelov, with the chapter on dialectical materialism written by Stalin, first published in 1938 [https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1939/x01/ch09.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The extraordinary high unemployment rate in Soviet Russia alarmed most syndicalists, who believed that such a condition was impossible under a proletarian state.
 
After the Soviet economy fell and Lenin introduced his [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP), Italian syndicalists continued to move further away from orthodox Marxism, determined to revise it to fit the changing times and to embolden its strategic goals. They argued that the Russian Bolsheviks had failed to adhere to Engels’ 1850 admonition about the dangers of trying to establish a social revolution within an economically backwards environment.&lt;ref&gt;A. James Gregor, ''The Faces of Janus: Marxism and Fascism in the Twentieth Century'', Yale University Press, 1999, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; This drift had emerged years before the economic malaise of Soviet Russia, prompting most Italian syndicalists to transcend the errors and drawbacks that “they believed they found in orthodox Marxism.”&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne, ''Fascism: Comparison and Definition'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1980, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Developed to bring about worker control of the means of production by direct action, the intellectuals of syndicalism came to the realization that Italy’s primitive economy could facilitate neither equality nor abundance for society. Without a mature industry developed by the bourgeois, they came to understand that a successful social revolution required the support of “classless” revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;James Gregor, ''The Faces of Janus: Marxism and Fascism in the Twentieth Century'', Yale University Press, 1999, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini, along with Italian syndicalists, Nationalists and Futurists, contended that those revolutionaries would be Fascists, not Marxists or some other ideology.&lt;ref&gt;James Gregor, ''The Faces of Janus: Marxism and Fascism in the Twentieth Century'', Yale University Press, 1999, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mussolini and other syndicalist theoreticians, Fascism would be “the socialism of ‘proletarian nations.’”&lt;ref&gt;James Gregor, ''The Faces of Janus: Marxism and Fascism in the Twentieth Century'', Yale University Press, 1999, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Fascist syndicalists also became preoccupied with the idea of increasing production instead of simply establishing a redistributive economic structure. [[Sergio Panunzio]], a major theoretician of Italian Fascism and syndicalism, believed that Syndicalists were productivists, rather than distributionists.&lt;ref&gt;A. James Gregor, ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; In his criticism of the Bolsheviks’ handling of their economy, Panunzio also asserted that Russian Soviet state had become a “dictatorship ''over'' the proletariat, and not ''of'' the proletariat.”&lt;ref&gt; Preface by Sergio Panunzio in a book by Amor Bavaj, Il Principio Rappresentativo nello Stato Sovietico (The Representative Principle in the Soviet State), Rome: Anonima Romana, 1933&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Rossoni and the fascist syndicatists==
 
When Rossoni was selected as the secretary-general of the General Confederation of Fascist Syndical Corporations in December 1922, other Italian syndicalists began to affirm the “Fascist syndicalism” catchphrase in their aim at “building and reorganizing political structures… through a synthesis of State and labor.”&lt;ref&gt;Emilio Gentile, ''The Origins of Fascist Ideology 1918-1925'', New York, NY, Enigma Books, 2005, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; Rossoni and his Fascist syndicalist cadre were soon regarded as “radical or leftist elements,” who sought to protect the economic interests of “workers and to preserve their class consciousness.”&lt;ref&gt;David D. Roberts, ''The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism'', University of North Carolina Press, 1979, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; Rossoni strove to build a “collective interest in the economy,” that would subject employers to Fascist discipline while providing a more substantial role for workers to make economic decisions.&lt;ref&gt;David D. Roberts, ''The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism'', University of North Carolina Press, 1979, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In an effort to set the basic revolutionary direction of the Fascist state, Rossoni argued that Fascist syndicalism should be at the forefront, proclaiming in Mussolini’s ''[[Il Popolo d'Italia]]'' newspaper that “only the Fascist syndicates could complete the revolution.”&lt;ref&gt;Martin Blinkhorn, edit., ''Fascists and Conservatives: The Radical Right and the Establishment in Twentieth-Century Europe'', chap. 2: Roland Sarti, “Italian fascism: radical politics and conservative goals,” London/New York, Routledge, 2001, p. 23, ''Il Popolo d'Italia'', Nov. 1922 edition&lt;/ref&gt; In his early anti-capitalist polemics, Rossoni claimed that capitalism “depressed and annulled production rather than stimulating and developing it” and that industrialists were “apathetic, passive, and ignorant.”&lt;ref&gt; Franklin Hugh Adler, ''Italian Industrialists from Liberalism to Fascism: The political development of the industrial bourgeoisie, 1906-1934,'' Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;
 
By early 1923 industrialists and factory owners were becoming alarmed by the Fascist syndicalists’ verbal assaults on the business community and capitalism, provoking a number of them to wonder if it was “now wise to pay the Communists to fight the Fascists!”&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Hugh Adler, ''Italian Industrialists from Liberalism to Fascism: The political development of the industrial bourgeoisie, 1906-1934'', Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; As the unrelenting attack continued, Rossoni by 1926 was steadfast in his accusations that depicted industrialists as “vampires” and “profiteers.”&lt;ref&gt;Lavoro d’Italia, January 6, 1926&lt;/ref&gt; Rossoni not only targeted big industrialists for their collective avarice, but also focused his criticisms against the “offensive greed of small shop-keepers.”&lt;ref&gt;R. J. B. Bosworth, ''Mussolini’s Italy: Life Under the Fascist Dictatorship, 1915-1945,'' Penguin Press, 2006, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In some cases, Rossoni’s pro-labor stances worried industrialists due to his philosophic interpretation of Marx’s “dynamic law of history,” which lead him to support the eventuality of workers’ control of factories.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Hugh Adler, ''Italian Industrialists from Liberalism to Fascism: The Political Development of the Industrial Bourgeoisie, 1906-1934'', Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that industrialists had a legitimate right to assume their positions, but only until “such time as workers, organized into new syndicates, had mastered the requisite competence to take command.”&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Hugh Adler, ''Italian Industrialists from Liberalism to Fascism: The political development of the industrial bourgeoisie, 1906-1934'', Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;
The Fascist syndicalists’ hostility towards employers caused political troubles for Mussolini’s regime before and after he established a one-party dictatorship in early 1925. But despite the controversies, Rossoni held on to his position until he was forced to resign in 1928, probably due to fears over his almost 3 million-strong union membership that had greatly surpassed the [[National Fascist Party]] membership.&lt;ref&gt; Martin Blinkhorn, ''Mussolini and Fascist Italy'', New York, NY, Routledge, 1994, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Although independent labor unions in Italy were not nationalized until April 3, 1926, under [[Alfredo Rocco]]’s Syndical Laws, Fascist syndicates by 1922 had become a “major recruitment competitor for the socialist and Catholic worker organizations.”&lt;ref&gt;A. James Gregor, ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; After peaking to a membership of over 2,000,000 members by 1920, the independent General Confederation of Labor was reduced to 400,000 members by mid-1922. Other unions fared just as poorly. The Catholic syndicates  of the ''Popolari'' had 1.2 million members in 1921, but by the later part of 1922, it was down to 540,000.&lt;ref&gt;A. James Gregor, ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Rossoni was treated as a valuable leader in Mussolini’s administration, becoming a member of the [[Grand Council of Fascism]] from 1930-1943 and other high positions.&lt;ref&gt; Roland Sarti, ''Italy: A Reference Guide from the Renaissance to the Present'', New York, NY, Facts on File, Inc., 2004, p. 534&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Much of the increased membership in Fascist syndicates stemmed from the deteriorating economic conditions that occurred during the long factory strikes in the early 1920s that had been spearheaded by revolutionary socialists. The occupied factories suffered financial problems, a shortage of cash to pay wages, and a slump in productivity levels.”&lt;ref&gt;A. James Gregor, ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p.178&lt;/ref&gt; When factory workers started to abandon factories, “red guards” were employed to keep workers at their work stations, in some cases forcing workers to “work under threat of violence.”&lt;ref&gt;A. James Gregor, ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p.178&lt;/ref&gt; What also contributed to the success of the Fascist union organizations was their strong affiliation to the Fascist party, a policy that was not taken up by the Italian Socialist Party and other labor confederations.&lt;ref&gt;A. James Gregor, ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There were a number of variants of Fascist syndicalism, ranging from the more moderate to the radical. One of the more radical fascist syndicalist was the philosopher [[Ugo Spirito]]. Considered as a “left fascist,” Spirito supported the struggle for a populist type of “corporativism”, a sort of proprietary corporation that provided the features of “collective ownership without undesirable economic centralization.”&lt;ref&gt;David D. Roberts, ''The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism'', University of North Carolina Press, 1979 p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Besides Rossoni, Sergio Panunzio and A. O. Olivetti were considered the “most coherent” Italian syndicalists who have been classified as the “Fascist left” by historians.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne, ''A History of Fascism, 1914–1945, '' Oxon, England: Routledge, 2001, pp. 111- 112&lt;/ref&gt; They identified Fascism and syndicalist ideology as a replacement for parliamentary liberalism so as to modernize the economy and advance the interests of workers and common people as well as “modernize the economy.”&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne, ''A History of Fascism, 1914–1945'', Oxon, England: Routledge, 2001, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;
To Rossoni, corporations were viewed as the best institutions to promote “economic justice and social solidarity” among producers.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Jabbari, ''Pierre Laroque and the Welfare State in Postwar France'', Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 46, E. Rossoni, ''Conférence de Edmondo Rossoni à Berlin'', le 29 avril 1936, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Luigi Razzo, who headed a Fascist trade union confederations (agriculture workers), thought that economy organizations represented the most important political element for the Fascist regime because they would provide workers with a “serious role in decision-making—especially in regulating the economy.”&lt;ref&gt;David D. Roberts, ''The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism, '' University of Northern Carolina Press, 1979, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;
Through this “''fascos corporativism'',” the true economic nation would have the means to govern itself as economics and politics grew closer towards a convergence.&lt;ref&gt;David D. Roberts, ''The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism'', University of Northern Carolina Press, 1979, pp. 256-257&lt;/ref&gt; This unification of politics and economics was the “core of the left-fascist conception” for most fascist syndicalists, who upheld fascism as a political idea and principle, but not as an economic system.&lt;ref&gt;David D. Roberts, ''The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism'', University of Northern Carolina Press, 1979, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; The Fascist state’s duty was to discipline production and economic activities, organized under economic groupings and collective interest, while no longer allowing the economy to operate on its own.
 
== Mussolini and his fascist regime==
 
Mussolini had been responsive to Rossoni in his effort to stop cuts in real wages, maintain the 8-hour week, and create a new “Charter of Labor” that would complete the Fascist labor legislation to guarantee the rights of workers, which resulted in vague gains for labor.&lt;ref&gt;Charles S. Maier, ''Recasting Bourgeois Europe: Stabilization in France, Germany, and Italy in the Decade after World War I'', Princeton University Press, 2016, pp. 568-569&lt;/ref&gt; But Mussolini had been more forceful in similar pro-labor approaches in the past. In the 1919 ''Unione Italiana del Lavoro'' (UIL) strike at the ''Franchi e Gregorini'' metallurgical plant in Dalmine, he supported workers’ occupation of factories. Calling them “creative strikes,” Mussolini insisted that workers “have a right to ‘parity’” with factory owners, and to engage in strikes to achieve it.&lt;ref&gt;A. James Gregor, ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; His main caveat was that the strike should not interrupt production, and that workers show both a willingness to participate as equals in the production process and the competence to discharge obligations in pursuit of the strike.&lt;ref&gt;A. James Gregor, ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Despite the official policy of Mussolini to uphold [[class collaboration]], the “left corporativists” in Italy continued to see class differences as inevitable, believing class-based organizations essential if corporations were to genuinely involve workers.&lt;ref&gt; David D. Roberts, ''The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism'', University of North Carolina Press, 1979 p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini had decided to move in another direction, concluding by late 1917 that orthodox Marxism was largely irrelevant for revolutionaries in industrially backward nations.&lt;ref&gt; A. James Gregor, ''Young Mussolini and the Intellectual Origins of Fascism'', University of California Press, 1979, p.126&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini and Fascist intellectuals reasoned that if the bourgeoisie could not fulfill their historical obligations and advance a nation’s industry infrastructure, then the task had to be relegated to the popular masses and elite vanguard, which would require a commitment to class collaboration so as to serve the community’s productive potential through proletariat and bourgeoisie producers.&lt;ref&gt; A. James Gregor, ''Young Mussolini and the Intellectual Origins of Fascism'', University of California Press, 1979, p.127&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini described this collaboration between classes as a new democracy—“a sane and honest regime of productive classes.”&lt;ref&gt;A. James Gregor, ''Young Mussolini and the Intellectual Origins of Fascism'', University of California Press, 1979, p.126, Mussolini: Quale democrazia, ''Opera'', 10, 417&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini’s opposition to class struggle echoed an earlier sentiment of Marxist reformers and Social Democrats, including [[Eduard Bernstein]], who maintained that “socialists needed to stress cooperation and evolution rather than class conflict and revolution.”&lt;ref&gt;Jackson J. Spielvogel, ''Western Civilization'', Ninth Edition, Vol. C: Since 1789, Stamford: CT, Cengage Learning, p. 713&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheri Berman, ''Social Democracy and the Making of Europe's Twentieth Century'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Some contend that “Mussolini’s far-left syndicalism” had merged with the far-right nationalism of Gabriel D’Annunzo, birthing a new revision of fascism by 1922.&lt;ref&gt; Stephen J. Lee, ''Europe, 1890-1945'', New York and London, Routledge, 2003, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Others assert that up to late 1921, Mussolini still preferred to rename his [[Fascist Revolutionary Party]] (PFR) the “Fascist Labor Party” in an effort to retain his reputation as being loyal to the left-wing tradition of supporting trade unionism,&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne, ''A History of Fascism, 1914-1945'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1995, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; especially if he and his fascist leaders could win the support of the [[Confederazione Generale del Lavoro| General Confederation of Labor]] (CGL).&lt;ref&gt;Charles F. Delzell, edit., ''Mediterranean Fascism 1919-1945'', New York, NY, Walker and Company, 1971, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini abandoned his proposed labor coalition with the socialists at the Third Fascist Congress (Nov. 7-10, 1921) in a conciliatory manner to appease the violent [[Squadrismo| squadistsi]] militias who strove to curtail the power of revolutionary socialists and labor unions. Nonetheless, by 1934, Mussolini began to reverse many of his market-maturity positions and boasted that he had put three-fourths of the Italian economy in the “hands of the state.”&lt;ref&gt;Gianni Toniolo, editor, ''The Oxford Handbook of the Italian Economy Since Unification'', Oxford: UK, Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 59; Mussolini’s speech to the Chamber of Deputies was on May 26, 1934&lt;/ref&gt; After he was confined in Northern Italy as a puppet government for the Nazis in 1943, Mussolini sought to return to his previous left-wing syndicalist roots and promote “socialization,” under the Italian Social Republic. In early 1944, Mussolini’s “socialization law” called for additional nationalization of industry that would pursue a policy where “workers were to participate in factory and business management.”&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Lee, ''European Dictatorships 1918-1945'', 3rd edition, New York: NY, Routledge, 2008, p. 171-172&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14558">The '''Government Security Classifications Policy''' (GSCP) is a new system for classifying [[Classified information in the United Kingdom|sensitive government data]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

==GPMS==
Historically, the [[Government Protective Marking Scheme]] was used by government bodies in the UK; it divides data into UNCLASSIFIED, PROTECT, RESTRICTED, CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET and TOP SECRET. This system was designed for paper-based records; it is not easily adapted to modern government work and is not widely understood.&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to Government Security Classifications. Page 1. Cabinet Office, April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current classifications==
[[File:Government Security Classifications Policy.png|thumb|The criteria for classifications are being adjusted too, so there is not always a perfect map from layer to layer.]]
The GSCP uses three levels of classification: OFFICIAL, SECRET and TOP SECRET.&lt;ref name=HMG_Sec_Class&gt; {{cite book |title=Government Security Classifications |date=April 2014 |publisher=HMG Cabinet Office |edition=Version 1.0 – October 2013 |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/251480/Government-Security-Classifications-April-2014.pdf |accessdate=September 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is simpler than the old model and there is no direct relationship between the old and new classifications. "Unclassified" is deliberately omitted from the new model. Government bodies are not expected to automatically remark existing data, so there may be cases where organisations working under the new system still handle some data marked according to the old system.

Information Asset Owners continue to be responsible for information. The new policy does not specify particular IT security requirements - IT systems should be built and used in accordance with existing guidance from [[Communications-Electronics Security Group|CESG]].&lt;ref&gt;Government Security Classifications FAQ Sheet 2: Managing Information Risk at OFFICIAL. Cabinet Office, April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Everybody who works with government - including contractors and suppliers - is responsible for protecting information they work with, regardless of whether it has a protective marking.

Aggregation does not automatically trigger an increase in protective marking. For instance, a database with thousands of records which are individually OFFICIAL should not be relabeled as a SECRET database. Instead, information owners are expected to make decisions about [[Security controls|controls]] based on a [[risk assessment]], and should consider what the aggregated information is, [[Need to know|who needs to access]] it, and how.

===OFFICIAL===
OFFICIAL includes most public-sector data, including a wide range of information on day-to-day government business. It is not subject to any special risks. Personal data would usually be OFFICIAL.&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to Government Security Classifications, Cabinet Office, April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The data should be protected by [[Security control|controls]] based on commercial best practice instead of expensive, difficult specialist technology and bureaucracy. There is no requirement to mark every document as "OFFICIAL" - it is understood that this is the default for government documents.&lt;ref name=HMG_Work_Off&gt; {{cite book |title=Government Security Classifications FAQ Sheet 1: Working with OFFICIAL Information |date=April 2013 |publisher=HMG Cabinet Office |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/251475/FAQ1-Working-with-Official-Information-v1.2-Apr-2013.pdf}}Government Security Classifications FAQ Sheet 1: Working with OFFICIAL Information. Cabinet Office, April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisations may add "descriptors" to highlight particular types of official data, for instance commercially sensitive information about contracts, or diplomatic data which should not be seen by locally hired embassy staff. These descriptors do not automatically require special controls. "OFFICIAL" will usually include the kinds of data that were previously UNCLASSIFIED, RESTRICTED, or CONFIDENTIAL; but this may vary.

The threat model for OFFICIAL data is similar to typical large private-sector organisations; it anticipates that individual hackers, pressure groups, criminals, and investigative journalists might attempt to get information. The threat model does not guarantee protection against very persistent and skilled attacks, for instance by organised crime groups or by foreign governments; these are possible, but normal controls would make them more difficult, and much stronger controls would be disproportionate. People with routine access to OFFICIAL information should be subject to [[BPSS]] screening.

OFFICIAL may include data which is subject to separate regulatory requirements, such as the [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Act]] (personal data) or [[PCI DSS]] (card payments).

====OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE====
OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE is an additional caveat for OFFICIAL data where it is particularly important to enforce [[need to know]] rules. OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE documents should be marked, but they are not necessarily tracked.

===SECRET===
"Very sensitive information", which might (for example) seriously harm national defense or crime investigations. Data should only be marked as SECRET if the Senior Information Risk Owner (which is a board level position in an organisation) agrees that it is high-impact ''and'' that the data must be protected against very capable attackers. Although some specialist technology might be used to protect the data, there is still strong emphasis on reuse of commercial security tools.

SECRET is a big step up from OFFICIAL; government bodies are warned against being overcautious and applying much stricter rules when OFFICIAL would be sufficient.

People with routine access to SECRET information should usually have [[SC clearance]]. SECRET data may often be exempt from [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|FOIA]] disclosure.

===TOP SECRET===
Data with exceptionally high impact levels; compromise would have very serious impacts - for instance, many deaths. This requires an extremely high level of protection, and controls are expected to be similar to those used on existing "Top Secret" data, including CESG-approved products. Very little risk can be tolerated in TOP SECRET, although no activity is completely risk-free.&lt;ref&gt;Government Security Classifications: Security Controls Framework. Cabinet Office, April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

People with routine access to TOP SECRET information should usually have [[DV clearance]]. TOP SECRET information is assumed to be exempt from [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|FOIA]] disclosure. Disclosure of such information is assumed to be above the threshold for [[Official Secrets Act]] prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Government Security Classifications: Security Controls Framework, page 19. Cabinet Office, April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special handling instructions===
Special handling instructions are additional markings which used in conjunction with a classification marking to indicate the nature or source of its content, limit access to designated groups, and / or to signify the need for enhanced handling measures.  In addition to a paragraph near the start of the document special handling instructions include Descriptors, Codewords, Prefixes and national caveats.&lt;ref name=HMG_Sec_Class/&gt;

====Descriptors====
A DESCRIPTOR is used with the security classification to identify certain categories of sensitive information and indicates the need for common sense precautions to limit access.  The normal descriptors are 'COMMERCIAL’, 'LOCSEN’ and 'PERSONAL’.&lt;ref name=HMG_Sec_Class/&gt;

====Codewords====
A Codeword is a single word expressed in CAPITAL letters that follows the security classification to providing security cover for a particular asset or event. They are usually only applied to SECRET and TOP SECRET assets.&lt;ref name=HMG_Sec_Class/&gt;

====Prefixes and national caveats====
The UK prefix is added to the security classification of all assets sent to foreign governments or international organisations.  This prefix designates the UK as the originating country and that the British Government should be consulted before any possible disclosure.&lt;ref name=HMG_Sec_Class/&gt;

National caveats follow the security classification. Unless explicitly named, information bearing a national caveat is not sent to foreign governments, overseas contractors, international organisations or released to any foreign nationals.&lt;ref name=HMG_Sec_Class/&gt;  Example
::::‘TOP SECRET – UK / US EYES ONLY’
With the exception of British Embassies and Diplomatic Missions or Service units or establishments, assets bearing the UK EYES ONLY national caveat are not sent overseas.&lt;ref name=HMG_Sec_Class/&gt;

==New approach to handling classified information==
As per the previous GPMS model, the choice of classification relates only to the data's confidentiality.
Unlike the old model it replaces however, the GSCP does not consider the consequence of a compromise as the primary factor, but instead is based on the capability and motivation of potential threat actors (attackers) and the acceptability of that risk to the business.

Where a capable and motivated attacker such as a Foreign Intelligence Service, or Serious and Organised Crime are considered to be in scope of the data to be classified, the business must implicitly accept this risk to classify the data as OFFICIAL.
If they do not or cannot accept this risk they must at least initially consider the data to be SECRET, though it may be reduced to OFFICIAL or increased to TOP SECRET later when the consequences of a compromise are also considered.

The implication of this approach and the binary nature of determining if a risk from capable and motivated attackers is acceptable or not, means that data cannot easily progress through the GSCP in a linear fashion as it did through GPMS. 

This is a complexity often lost on Information Asset Owners previously used to the strictly hierarchical tiered rising structure of GPMS  (e.g. UNCLASSIFIED, PROTECT, RESTRICTED, CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET, TOP SECRET).

By contrast GSCP data starts either with an OFFICIAL '''OR''' SECRET classification depending on the nature of threat and its acceptability to the business, and thereafter moves up or down accordingly based on consequence of compromise.

OFFICIAL data may therefore rise to TOP SECRET, but cannot be SECRET unless the risk previously accepted for a capable attacker is revised.

SECRET data may be reduced to OFFICIAL where no serious consequences can be identified from a potential breach, or SECRET can also rise to TOP SECRET if serious consequences could arise. 

Impact levels also consider integrity and availability, but CESG's system of Business Impact Levels (BIL) is under review too and in most practical contexts have now fallen into disuse. 

It is therefore no longer strictly the case that the greater the consequences if the data confidentiality were to be compromised, the higher the classification, since data with a high impact (including material which could result in threat to life) may still be classified as OFFICIAL if the relevant business owner believes it is not necessary to protect this from an attacker who has the capabilities of a Foreign Intelligence Service or Serious and Organised Crime.

Conversely some data with much lower consequences (for example ongoing Police investigations into a criminal group, or intelligence information relating to possible prosecutions) but where the business will not accept compromise from such an attacker could be classified as SECRET.

Guidance issued in April 2014 at the implementation of the GSCP and still available on Gov.UK sources &lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications&lt;/ref&gt;suggested that UK Government information systems would continue to be accredited much as before, normally using CESG [[Information Assurance Standard 1 &amp; 2]]. 
This has however been progressively discarded through GDS and NCSC blog statements since May 2014 and the IS1 &amp; 2 standard itself is no longer maintained or mandated.
Accreditation has also been largely replaced by alternative models of assurance aligned to various commercial practices. 

The NAO report "Protecting Information across Government" (Sep 2016) was somewhat critical of the move to this model and the adoption of GSCP overall &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nao.org.uk/report/protecting-information-across-government/&lt;/ref&gt;  

Existing published guidance continues to suggest that storage media which hold UK government data should still be destroyed or purged according to [[HMG IA Policy No. 5]], however terminology in this guidance and other material has not been updated fully to reflect the changes from GPMS protective markings to GSCP classifications and as such its value is now arguably somewhat reduced as a published standard.

Higher classifications still tend to require stricter [[Security vetting in the United Kingdom|personnel vetting]].

==History==
The Government Security Classifications Policy was completed and published in December 2012; additional guidance and supporting processes were developed over time.

Government bodies (and the armed forces) were expected to start using the GSCP in April 2014.

The '''''Jungmädelbund''''' ([[German language|German]] for "Young Girls' League") was the section of the [[Hitler Youth]] for girls between the ages of 10 and 14. 

It was called the ''Jungmädelbund'' in German, and commonly abbreviated in period and contemporary historical writings as JM. Since this was a girls' organization, it fell under the [[League of German Girls]] (BDM), which was led by the ''BDM-Reichsreferentin'' (National Speaker of the BDM), who reported to the overall head of the Hitler Youth, [[Baldur von Schirach]] (who was later succeeded by [[Artur Axmann]]).

==Background==

After the [[Gleichschaltung]] in 1933, the League of German Girls became the only girls' organization in the Third Reich. All other groups, including church groups and scouting organizations, were either absorbed into the Hitler Youth or banned. In 1936, the First Hitler Youth Law made membership compulsory for all girls aged 10 or older. The same law also made membership in the male Hitler Youth compulsory for all boys above the age of 10.

New members had to register for their service between March 1st and March 10th of every year. Registration was held at a local League of German Girls administrative office. Girls had to have completed fourth grade and meet the following requirements:
* be of racial/ethnic German heritage
* be a German citizen
* be free of hereditary diseases

If a girl met those requirements, she was assigned to a Jungmädel group based on the geographical location she lived at. In order to become a full member, she had to now attend preparatory service which consisted of her participation of one Jungmädel meeting, one sports afternoon which was to include a test of her courage, and a lecture about the tasks of the Jungmädel.

After she fulfilled these requirements, a ceremony was held to introduce new members into the rank of the Jungmädel on April 20th, [[Hitler]]'s birthday. During the ceremony, new members were sworn in, presented with a membership certificate, and personally welcomed by their group leaders.

In order to become a "full" member, however, each girl had to pass the Jungmädel Challenge (''Jungmädelprobe''), which consisted of participation in a one-day trip with the group, and a number of sports requirements. Girls had six months to meet all the requirements of the Jungmädel Challenge and, on October 2nd of each year, those who passed became full members in another ceremony in which they were officially presented with the right to wear the black neckerchief and brown leather knot.

A girl was then a full member of the Jungmädel and remained in the group until the age of 14, at which point she transferred into the League of German Girls (also known as the BDM, or ''Bund Deutscher Mädel'').

[[Image:HannahSnell.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Hannah Snell]] (1723–1792) was a British woman who disguised herself as a man and became a soldier]]

Many people have engaged in [[cross-dressing]] during wartime under various circumstances and for various motives. This has been especially true of women, whether while serving as a soldier in otherwise all-male armies, while protecting themselves or disguising their identity in dangerous circumstances, or for other purposes.

Conversely, men would dress as women to avoid being drafted, the mythological precedent for this being [[Achilles]] hiding at the court of [[Lycomedes]] dressed as a girl to avoid participation in the [[Trojan War]].

== Historical ==

===Antiquity===
* [[Epipole of Carystus]] was a Greek woman described by [[Ptolemaeus Chennus|Chennos]] as having joined the Greek army during the [[Trojan War]].
*[[Achilles]] was a Greek hero in the Trojan War. After hearing from an [[Oracle]] that her son would die in battle, his mother, [[Thetis]], hid him in woman's clothing to prevent him from being taken to war.

===Early Middle Ages===
* [[Hua Mulan]] was, according to a famous Chinese poem, a woman who joined the Chinese army in her father's stead.

===Fourteenth century===
* [[Joanna of Flanders]] (c. 1295–1374) led the Montfortist faction in Brittany in the 1340s after the capture of her husband left her as the titular head of the family. She wore male dress at engagements such as the siege of [[Hennebont]].

===Fifteenth century===
[[File:Scherrer jeanne enters orlean.jpg|thumb|250px|Joan of Arc enters Orléans (painting by J.J. Sherer, 1887)]]

* [[Onorata Rodiani]] (1403–1452) was an Italian mercenary who served as a cavalry soldier, disguised in male clothing and with a male name, under a condottieri (freelance commander) named Oldrado Lampugnano beginning in 1423.
*[[Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut|Jacqueline of Wittelsbach]], Countess of Hainaut, Holland and Zeeland (1401–1436) led the [[Hook and Cod wars|Hoek faction]] (the aristocratic faction) in Holland. Jacqueline and one of her servants disguised themselves as soldiers to escape confinement in Ghent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philip the Good|author=Vaughan, Richard|pages=34–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Joan of Arc]] (1412–1431) is a [[folk hero]]ine of France and a [[Roman Catholic saint]]. A [[peasant]] girl born in what is now eastern France who claimed divine guidance, she led the French army to several important victories during the [[Hundred Years' War]]. After being captured by her enemies, she was [[death by burning|burned at the stake]] for [[heresy]] when she was 19 years old. She journeyed through hostile Burgundian territory disguised as a male soldier.

===Sixteenth century===
* [[Brita Olofsdotter]], widow of soldier Nils Simonsson, dressed as a man and enlisted in the Finnish unit in the [[Swedish cavalry]] in [[Livonia]]. She was killed in battle, and King [[John III of Sweden]] ordered her salary to be paid to her family.

==Australian Greens==

===Western Australian Greens===
In May 1996, following the [[Australian federal election, 1996|1996 election]], the two members of the [[Western Australian Greens]] in the Senate announced they were to be whip and deputy whip of their party. The deputy whip, Christabel Chamarette, had lost her seat at the election, and left the Senate just over a month after the announcement. The party lost its other seat (and its whip) at the [[Australian federal election, 1998|1998 election]], with her leaving office in June 1999. The party only merged with the Australian Greens in 2003, after it lost its senators.

==Pauline Hanson's One Nation==
[[Pauline Hanson's One Nation|One Nation]] first entered the Senate in 1999, but had only one seat and consequently did not elect a whip. The party's senator was defeated in 2004 and left the Senate in 2005. In 2016, four One Nation senators were elected, and the party elected a whip for the first time.

==Nick Xenophon Team==
Senator [[Nick Xenophon]] entered the Senate as an independent in 2008. In 2016 he ran as part of the [[Nick Xenophon Team]], which saw Xenophon and two of his running mates (and a lower house MP) elected, so the Nick Xenophon Team elected a whip.

==Democratic Labour Party==
The [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|Democratic Labour Party]] (until 2013 the Democratic ''Labor'' Party) elected its first whip in 1968, when its membership increased from two to four. The party continued to do so until 1974, when the party lost all its seats at the [[Australian federal election, 1974|double dissolution election]]. The party re-entered the Senate following the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 election]], but did not have a whip as it only had one senator, who left the party in 2014.

| Unclear{{#tag:ref|Chataway's term as a senator ended on 30 June 1913. In June 1913, immediately before the formation of the [[Cook Ministry]], there was speculation Senator Keating would become whip, but this does not appear to have eventuated. The Liberals may have chosen not to appoint a whip because they had only seven (of 36) senators, three of whom were in the ministry. This proposition receives some support from a mocking question asked by Senator Ready, the Labor whip: "I should like the Honorary Minister to inform the Senate who is the Whip of the large party sitting opposite?" The only answer came from a fellow Labor senator, [[James Long (Australian politician)|James Long]], who said, "They are all crackers. I do not know who is Whip." Various Liberals acted as teller during the Cook Government, and while [[Thomas Bakhap]] and [[Charles Oakes]] did so the most, there is no evidence from Hansard that either was the whip. Following the 1914 double dissolution, the Liberals' numbers in the Senate fell to five.|group=d}} || 1 July 1913

The '''Mandela Park Backyarders''' or just '''Backyarders''' is an unfunded [[Khayelitsha]]-based South African [[social movement]] made up of poor and marginalised residents of Mandela Park that is working for housing rights and against evictions.

The focus of the movement is on providing legal support for residents on housing issues, fighting for the rights of its members in relation to government housing policies, as well as conducting workshops and democratic discussions about housing issues.

The movement claims to be a socialist movement that believes in [[direct democracy]] through open mass meetings with all members invited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mpbackyarders.org.za/about/ Mandela Park Backyarders: About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101002151815/http://mpbackyarders.org.za/about/ |date=2 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200908190522.html Mandela Park Backyarders Broker 50/50 Deal With MEC]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign against housing corruption==

Mandela Park Backyarders have alleged widespread corruption in government housing allocation in Mandela Park.  They have been successful in compelling the Provincial Housing Department towards organising a probe into the illegal buying and selling of RDP houses in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://westcapenews.com/?p=2138 Claims of illegal RDP sales in Mandela Park]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyewitnessnews.co.za/articleprog.aspx?id=47790 Khayelitsha dwellers say they have proof of RDP house allocation fraud]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyewitnessnews.co.za/articleprog.aspx?id=39161 Mandela Park residents frustrated over lack of housing]&lt;/ref&gt; Backyarder protests have also forced provincial government to fire corrupt contractors from Mandela Park developments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abahlali.org/node/7323 Construction In Mandela Park still closed but managing agent breaks with MEC and supports the Backyarders]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests and arrests of members==

In September 2009, Mandela Park Backyarders protested against what they called a false promise of 23 houses from MEC for Human Settlements Bonginkosi Madikizela.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abahlali.org/node/5739 Sowetan:MEC under siege over 'false promise']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://westcapenews.com/?p=1080 Backyarders and MEC in dispute over house allocation]&lt;/ref&gt; 23 Backyarders were then arrested for allegedly vandalising government property.  However, Backyarders claim that the 23 members were not involved and that police arrested anyone they could find connected to the Backyarder movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mpbackyarders.org.za/2009/09/21/the-%E2%80%98mandela-park-23%E2%80%B2-to-appear-in-khayelitsha-magistrates-court-tomorrow-at-9am/ The ‘Mandela Park 23′ to appear in Khayelitsha Magistrates court tomorrow at 9am] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120710121323/http://mpbackyarders.org.za/2009/09/21/the-%E2%80%98mandela-park-23%E2%80%B2-to-appear-in-khayelitsha-magistrates-court-tomorrow-at-9am/ |date=10 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abahlali.org/node/5721 Cape Town: 23 Mandela Park Backyarders Arrested]&lt;/ref&gt; The case was dismissed due to lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bushradionews.blogspot.com/2009/09/23-accuse-residents-are-free-again.html 23 accused residents are free again]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy of the movement==

{{Forms of government}}
A '''military dictatorship''' is a form of [[government]] wherein a [[military]] force exerts complete or substantial control over [[political]] authority.

A military dictatorship is different from [[civilian dictatorship]] for a number of reasons: their motivations for seizing power, the institutions through which they organize their rule and the ways in which they leave power. Often viewing itself as saving the nation from the corrupt or myopic civilian politicians, a military dictatorship justifies its position as "neutral" arbiters on the basis of their membership within the armed forces. For example, many [[Junta (governing body)|juntas]] adopt titles such as "Committee of National Restoration", or "National Liberation Committee". Military leaders often rule as a junta, selecting one of themselves as a head.&lt;ref name="Cheibub_etal_2010"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11127-009-9491-2|issn=0048-5829|volume=143|issue=1–2|pages=67–101|last=Cheibub|first=José Antonio|author2=Jennifer Gandhi|author3=James Raymond Vreeland|title=Democracy and dictatorship revisited|journal=Public Choice|accessdate=March 24, 2014|date=April 1, 2010|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-009-9491-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally military dictatorship is called '''''khakistocracy'''''.&lt;ref name="Habila"&gt;{{cite news |author=Dave Gilson |title=Freed from a prison of thought in Nigeria |publisher=[[SFGate]] |date=2003-02-02 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2003/02/02/RV71558.DTL |accessdate=2007-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Nigeria"&gt;{{cite news |author=Ikhenemho Okomilo |title=Another October, More Khakistocracy |publisher=Nigerians in America |date=2005-06-10 |url=http://www.nigeriansinamerica.com/articles/751/1/Letter-From-London-Another-October-More-Khakistocracy/Page1.html |accessdate=2007-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Military-Industrial-Feudal Complex"&gt;{{cite news |author=temporal |title=Khakistocracy: Military-Industrial-Feudal Complex in Pakistan |publisher=[[Desicritics]] |date=2007-08-07 |url=http://desicritics.org/2007/08/07/031115.php |accessdate=2007-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is a [[portmanteau word]] combining ''[[kakistocracy]]'' with ''[[khaki]]'', the tan-green camouflage colour used in most modern army uniforms.

==Creation and evolution==
Most military dictatorships are formed after a ''[[coup d'état]]'' has overthrown the previous government.

Military dictatorships may gradually restore significant components of [[civilian]] government while the senior military commander still maintains executive [[political power]]. In [[Pakistan]], ruling Generals [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] (1977–1988) and [[Pervez Musharraf]] (1999–2008) have held [[referendums]] to elect themselves [[President of Pakistan]] for additional terms forbidden by the [[Constitution of Pakistan|constitution]].

==Justification==
In the past, military juntas have justified their rule as a way of bringing political stability for the nation or rescuing it from the threat of "dangerous ideologies". For example the threat of [[communism]], [[socialism]], and [[Islamism]] was often used. Military regimes tend to portray themselves as non-partisan, as a "neutral" party that can provide interim leadership in times of turmoil, and also tend to portray civilian politicians as corrupt and ineffective. One of the almost universal characteristics of a military government is the institution of [[martial law]] or a permanent [[state of emergency]].

'''Nari Mukti Sangh''' ({{IPA-hns|naːriː mʊkt̪ɪ sŋɡʱ|hi}}) (English: ''Women's Liberation Association'') is a women's organisation in India, with a base of supporters in [[Bihar]] and [[Jharkhand]].&lt;ref name="Sanhati-NMS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Contemporary anti-displacement struggles and women's resistance: a commentary |url=http://sanhati.com/excerpted/2923/ |first=Shoma |last=Sen |date=3 November 2010 |publisher=Sanhati |accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation was founded in March 1990, during a women's conference at Talekocha in [[Giridih]], which was held to organise women to wrestle against the exploitation, oppression and atrocities faced by them. An executive committee of the organisation was also elected at the conference.

The organisation is influenced from "(scientific) [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxism, Leninism]] and [[Maoism]]", and "believes that national problems can be solved through people's struggle and on the basis of independence, [[democracy]], equality, [[women's liberation]] and [[socialism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Indian Political System |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ij_dTJBc2p8C&amp;q=Nari+Mukti+Sangh#v=snippet&amp;q=Nari%20Mukti%20Sangh&amp;f=false |editor1-first=Mahendra Prasad |editor1-last=Singh |editor2-first=Subhendu Ranjan |editor2-last=Raj |publisher=[[Pearson Education]] ([[Dorling Kindersley]]) |year=2012 |isbn=978-81-31761-24-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NMS describes India as a "semi-[[feudal]]" country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Indian Political System |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ij_dTJBc2p8C&amp;q=Nari+Mukti+Sangh#v=snippet&amp;q=Nari%20Mukti%20Sangh&amp;f=false |editor1-first=Mahendra Prasad |editor1-last=Singh |editor2-first=Subhendu Ranjan |editor2-last=Raj |publisher=Pearson Education (Dorling Kindersley) |year=2012 |isbn=978-81-31761-24-3 |quote=In a similar vein, on the eve of International Women's Day on 8 March 1997, the Nari Mukti Sangh, Bihar, argued that India is a semi-feudal nation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and avers that "without a radical transformation of the [[State (polity)|state]], women liberation is not possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dalit Women on the Move: The Bihar Scenario |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_GnaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Nari+Mukti+Sangh |author1=Sachchidananda |author2=Niraj Kumar |publisher=Serials |year=2005 |page=109 |location=New Delhi |isbn=978-81-86771-94-5 |oclc=62733085 |quote=Nari Mukti Sangh recognizes 'State Patriarchy' as the prime contradiction and argues that without a radical transformation of the State, Women Liberation is not possible.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims and activities==
The organisation strives to generate "space to women’s voice" and motivates them to partake in "[[economic]], political and social activity and [[Decision-making processes|decision making processes]]."&lt;ref name="Sanhati-NMS"/&gt; The NMS's volunteers goes from village to village in Bihar and Jharkhand, and with the collaboration of local women, tries to mete out punishment to "perpetrators of sexual violence through people’s courts", and endeavours to cordially straighten out the quarrels amongst family members." It also organises ''"kranti ka paathshaala"'' ''(school of [[revolution]])'' to educate women, and so far has enabled thousands of women to read and write.&lt;ref name="Sanhati-NMS"/&gt;
Shoma Sen writes,
{{quote|"Picketing at health centres where there are no doctors, at schools where teachers are absent, fighting for equitable distribution of food grains, for better wages and better remunerative prices, for equal wages for equal work between men and women, these tribal women’s organizations [Nari Mukti Sangh and [[Krantikari Adivasi Mahila Sangathan]]] are democratizing the processes of women’s political, social and economic activities, thus making development and democracy more meaningful to them."&lt;ref name="Sanhati-NMS"/&gt;}}

The NMS has become a cynosure in Jharkhand for their campaign in [[Pirtand block|Pirtand]] forests of [[Giridih district]] to save the trees. They educate villagers about the significance of trees for humans and wildlife, and make them conscious about the possibilities of future natural disasters if the trees would be continuously cut down ignorantly. They have also alarmed to penalise the offenders with a fine of {{INR}} 1,000 or face physical punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Red women on green rampage |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110831/jsp/jharkhand/story_14445998.jsp |first=Vishvendu |last=Jaipuriar |newspaper=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]] |date=31 August 2011 |accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Security Service''' ([[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] ''Milliy Xavfsizlik Xizmati'', ''MXX''; in [[Russian language|Russian]] ''Служба национальной безопасности'', ''СНБ'', often romanised as ''SNB'') is the national [[intelligence agency]] of the [[government of Uzbekistan]]. It was created as a successor to the [[KGB]] following the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], and retains the same responsibilities and a similar range of functional units, including paramilitary police and [[special forces]]. The SNB was a rival of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Uzbekistan)|Interior Ministry]] until 2005, when it was brought under its control.

The SNB is described by [[Amnesty International]] and the [[Institute for War and Peace Reporting]] as a [[secret police]] force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/secrets-and-lies-forced-confessions-under-torture-in-uzbekistan Secrets and Lies: Forced Confessions Under Torture in Uzbekistan], Amnesty International (April 15, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://iwpr.net/global-voices/uzbek-secret-police-roam-russian-prisons Uzbek Secret Police Roam Russian Prisons], '' News Briefing Central Asia'' ([[Institute for War and Peace Reporting]]) (January 9, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
[[Rustam Inoyatov]] has been the head of the SNB since 1995. &lt;ref&gt;[http://registan.net/2013/07/30/rustam-inoyatov-snb-vs-mvd-2/ Rustam Inoyatov: SNB vs MVD] — Registran.net&lt;/ref&gt;

The deputy director of the SNB was in 2005 appointed Minister of the Interior.&lt;ref name="RFE1"&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/08/970cdfca-adb7-4c9c-856b-526cef00273b.html] [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] on "Tashkent clan"&lt;/ref&gt; A reorganisation of the security and counter-terrorism agencies in the aftermath of the Andijan massacre significantly increased the power and resources of the SNB.&lt;ref name=RFE1/&gt;&lt;ref name=SRSP/&gt;

Some analysts maintain that the SNB is under the control of the [[Tashkent clan]], a powerful faction within the Uzbek elite.&lt;ref name=RFE1/&gt;&lt;ref name="SRSP"&gt;[http://216.109.125.130/search/cache?p=resignation+Karimov+andijan&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;x=wrt&amp;u=www.silkroadstudies.org/new/docs/CEF/Quarterly/February_2007/Burnashev_Chernykh.pdf&amp;w=resignation+karimov+andijan&amp;d=MPllo_mdOfRN&amp;icp=1&amp;.intl=us Changes in Uzbekistan's Military Policy after the Andijan Events]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Central Asia-Institute Silk Road Studies Program&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Activities and human rights abuses==
The SNB has been closely associated with the authoritarian administration of [[President of Uzbekistan|President]] [[Islam Karimov]], and has been accused of involvement in human rights abuses and in sponsoring acts of [[terrorism]] to provide a pretext for repressive policing. [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] has reported claims that the [[1999 Tashkent bombings]] were carried out by the SNB, then led by Rustam Inoyatov of the Tashkent clan, and that the SNB may also have been responsible for a series of [[Terrorism_in_Uzbekistan#2004|bombings in 2004]] in Tashkent and [[Bukhara]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/04/51d08217-f03f-4906-9cc7-6224a3cff08b.html] Radio Free Europe feature on bombings&lt;/ref&gt;

Fear of the SNB is so widespread in Uzbekistan that it is considered dangerous to say its name in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Higgins|first1=Andrew|title='The Ice Is Melting’ as Uzbekistan Moves to Dilute Police State|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/01/world/asia/uzbekistan-reform.html|accessdate=2 April 2018|work=The New York Times|date=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torture===
The [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]]'s 2004 [[Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|Country Report on Human Rights Practices]] in Uzbekistan stated that SNB officials "tortured, beat, and harassed" citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41717.htm 2004 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Uzbekistan], [[United States Department of State]], [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (February 28, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Andijan massacre===
On 13 May 2005 SNB troops, along with military and Interior Ministry forces, killed a large number of protesters in [[Andijan]], in an event that became known as the [[Andijan massacre]].&lt;ref name=OSCE&gt;[http://www.osce.org/documents/odihr/2005/06/15233_en.pdf Preliminary findings on the events in Andijan] [[Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (June 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/publication/10984/documenting_andijan.html#6 Documenting Andijan], Council for Foreign Relations (26 June 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of those killed range widely, from the official figure of 187 to upwards of 1,000.&lt;ref name=OSCE/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060629080856/http://www.turkishweekly.net/comments.php?id=1432 The Turkish Weekly]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://iwpr.net/?p=rca&amp;s=f&amp;o=255969&amp;apc_state=henirca2005 Institute for War and Peace Reporting]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/Former_Uzbek_Spy_Seeks_Asylum/1195372.html Former Uzbek Spy Accuses Government Of Massacres, Seeks Asylum] 1 September 2008, [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]&lt;/ref&gt; The protests related to the arrest of a group of local businessmen, and the massacre was preceded by disorder including, according to [[Pravda]], an attempt to seize the regional headquarters of the SNB.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.pravda.ru/world/20/92/373/15462_Uzbekistan.html The revolution in Uzbekistan's Andijan turns out to be narcotic] ''Pravda''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet censorship===
{{Main|Internet censorship in Uzbekistan}}
The [[OpenNet Initiative]] reports that the SNB is extensively involved in [[Internet censorship]]. The OpenNet Initiative reports that the SNB:

:"monitors the Uzbek sector of the Internet and 'stimulates' [[ISPs]] and [[Internet café]]s to practice [[self-censorship]]. [[Censorship in the Soviet Union|Soviet-style censorship structures]] were replaced by 'monitoring sections' that work under SNB’s guidance. There is no mandatory government prepublication review, but ISPs risk having their licenses revoked if they post 'inappropriate' information. Occasionally, the SNB orders ISPs to block access to opposition or religious Web sites. A survey of internet filtering practices among Uzbek ISPs was conducted by ONI in January 2007. Respondents confirmed that they use filtering applications including [[SquidGuard]] and FortiGuard. The SNB's censorship is selective and often targets articles on [[Corruption in Uzbekistan|government corruption]], [[Human rights in Uzbekistan|violations of human rights]], and organized crime. Usually, it affects URL-specific pages instead of [[top-level domain name]]s. Uzbek ISPs block entire Web sites or individual pages upon SNB's unofficial requests. Accessing a blocked page redirects the user to a search engine or to an error message such as 'You are not authorized to view this page.' The retransmission of blocked channels is also prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;[https://opennet.net/research/profiles/uzbekistan Profile: Uzbekistan], OpenNet Initiative (December 21, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

The SNB is known to have [[spetsnaz|special purpose units]] "Alfa", "Cobra", and "Scorpion" under its direct command. &lt;ref&gt;[http://registan.net/2013/07/30/rustam-inoyatov-snb-vs-mvd-2/]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Uzbekistan Frontier Service|Border Service]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/centralasia/uzbek-army.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Uzbekistan Customs Service|Customs Service]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://registan.net/2013/07/30/rustam-inoyatov-snb-vs-mvd-2/]&lt;/ref&gt; of Uzbekistan answer to the SNB since being placed under its control in 2005. With corruption in the Country being the highest, the organization fully separated itself from the Nation but stays under mafia control.

'''Peace of Philocrates''' is the name given to the peace treaty concluded in 346 BC between  [[Classical Athens|Athens]] and [[Macedon]] under [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]]. Philocrates was the name of the main Athenian negotiator of the Treaty.

==Background==
{{Main|Rise of Macedon|Third Sacred War}}

Athens and Macedon had been at war since 356 BC, after Philip's [[Rise of Macedon#Pydna and Potidea (357–356 BCE)|capture]] of the Athenian colonies of [[Pydna]] and [[Potidea]]. Shortly afterwards, the [[Third Sacred War]] began after the [[Phocis (ancient region)|Phocian]] seizure of the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] in [[Delphi]]. Athens allied herself with Phocis, against the other members of the [[Amphictyonic League]]. In 354 or 353 BCE, the [[Thessaly (ancient region)|Thessalians]], having been defeated by the Phocians, requested that Philip become [[archon]] of Thessaly, to which Philip assented, drawing Macedon into the Sacred War. In 352 BC, Philip's erstwhile ally, the [[Chalkidian League]] (led by [[Olynthos]]), alarmed by Philip's growing power, sought to ally themselves with Athens, in clear breach of their alliance with Philip. In response, Philip attacked [[Chalkidiki]] in 349 BC, and by 348 BC, had completely destroyed the Chalkidian League, razing Olynthos in the process.

The prominent Athenian politician [[Philocrates]] had suggested offering Philip peace in 348 BC, during the Olynthian war.&lt;ref name = Cawk91/&gt; However, the Athenian ''[[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]]'' (assembly) had effectively rejected this proposal by putting Philocrates on trial, and by the time he was cleared of the charges, it was too late to save Olynthos.&lt;ref name = Cawk91&gt;Cawkwell, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The war between Athens and Philip thus continued through 347 BC, as did the Sacred War.&lt;ref name = Cawk91/&gt; In 347 BC, Philip sent [[privateers]] to attack Athenians colonies on various Aegean islands.&lt;ref&gt;Cawkwell, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Buck476/&gt;

Philip had not involved himself in the Sacred War since his victory at the [[Battle of Crocus Field|Crocus Field]] in 352 BC. In the meantime, it became clear that the Sacred War could only be ended by outside intervention.&lt;ref name = Cawk95/&gt; In 347 BC, the [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]] appealed to Philip for aid, and he sent a small force to their assistance.&lt;ref name = Cawk95/&gt; That force was large enough to honour his alliance with Thebes, but not enough to end the war&amp;mdash;he desired the glory of ending the war personally, in the manner of his choosing, and on his terms.&lt;ref name = Buck476&gt;Buckley, p. 476.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Cawk95&gt;Cawkwell, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peace negotiations==
In early 346 BC, Philip let it be known that he intended to march south with the Thessalians, though not where or why.&lt;ref name = Cawk95/&gt; The Phocians thus made plans to defend Thermopylae, and requested assistance from the Spartans and the Athenians, probably around 14 February.&lt;ref name = Cawk95/&gt; The Spartans dispatched [[Archidamus III]] with 1,000 hoplites, and the Athenians ordered everyone eligible for military service under the age of 40 to be sent to the Phocians' aid.&lt;ref name = Cawk95/&gt; However, between the Phocians' appeal and the end of the month, all plans were upset by the return of Phalaikos to power in Phocis; the Athenians and the Spartans were subsequently told that they would not be permitted to defend Thermopylae.&lt;ref name = Cawk95/&gt; It is not clear from the ancient sources why Phalaikos was returned to power, nor why he adopted this dramatic change of policy. Cawkwell suggests, based on remarks of [[Aeschines]], that the Phocian army restored Phalaikos because they had not been properly paid, and further that Phalaikos, realizing that the army could not be paid and that the Phocians could no longer hope to win the war, decided to try to negotiate a peace settlement with Philip.&lt;ref name = Cawk96&gt;Cawkwell, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Athenians received this news, they rapidly changed policy. If Thermopylae could no longer be defended, then Athenian security could no longer be guaranteed.&lt;ref name = Cawk96/&gt; By the end of February, the Athenians had dispatched an embassy, including Philocrates, [[Demosthenes]] and Aeschines, to Philip to discuss peace between Athens and Macedon.&lt;ref name = Cawk96/&gt; The embassy had two audiences with Philip, in which each side presented their proposals for the terms of the peace settlement. In the first meeting with Philip, Demosthenes is said to have spit a fire verse. He then got on a little way into the subject and suddenly stopped speaking and stood helpless, until he collapsed completely.&lt;ref name="Aeschines34"&gt;Aeschines, ''The Speech on the Embassy'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002;query=section%3D%23230;layout=;loc=2.33 34]&lt;/ref&gt; During this meeting, Aeschines made the case that Philip should hand the former Athenian colony of [[Amphipolis]] back to Athens in return for peace.

==Ratification==
The embassy then returned to Athens to present the proposed terms to the ''Ecclesia'', along with a Macedonian embassy to Athens, empowered by Philip to finalize an agreement.&lt;ref name = Cawk98&gt;Cawkwell, pp. 98–101.&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians debated the peace treaty in April and tried to propose that the peace take the form of a "common peace" in which all Greek states could partake (including Phocis). However, Demosthenes (at this point a strong proponent of peace) persuaded the ''Ecclesia'' that Philip would never agree to such a peace, and that Athens's vulnerable position meant that they had little choice but to accept Philip's terms.&lt;ref name = Cawk98/&gt; The treaty was therefore to be bilateral only, between Macedon and Athens (and her allies in the [[Second Athenian League]]. On 23 April, the Athenians swore to the terms of the treaty in the presence of the Macedonian ambassadors.&lt;ref name = Cawk98/&gt; Amongst the principal terms were that Athens become Philip's ally, and that they forever renounce their claim to [[Amphipolis]].&lt;ref name = Cawk98/&gt;

After agreeing to the peace terms with Macedonian ambassadors in April, the Athenians dispatched a second embassy to Macedon, to extract the peace oaths from Philip; this embassy travelled to Pella at a relaxed pace, knowing that Philip was away on campaign against the [[Thrace|Thracian]] king [[Cersobleptes|Kersebleptes]].&lt;ref&gt;Cawkwell, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; When they arrived, the Athenians (again including Demosthenes and Aeschines) were rather surprised to find embassies from all the principal combatants in the Sacred War were also present, in order to discuss a settlement to the war.&lt;ref name = Cawk102&gt;Cawkwell, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Demosthenes became very anxious about these delays, and proposed that an Athenian delegation should sail without delay to any place where they might learn that Philip was to be found, and there receive from him the oath of ratification.&lt;ref name="Crown25-27"&gt;Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0072&amp;query=section%3D%23250&amp;layout=&amp;loc=18.29 25&amp;ndash;27]&lt;/ref&gt; Demosthenes later claimed that he was trying to prevent Philip seizing any more Thracian towns,&lt;ref name="Crown25-27" /&gt; but must have known that there was no chance of saving any of Kersebleptes's kingdom.&lt;ref name = Cawk102/&gt;

Despite his suggestions, the Athenian envoys, including himself and Aeschines, remained in Macedonia for three whole months, until Philip returned from Thrace, having subdued the whole country.&lt;ref name="Crown30"&gt;Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0072&amp;query=section%3D%23250&amp;layout=&amp;loc=18.29 30]&lt;/ref&gt; When Philip returned from Thrace, he received both the Athenian and other embassies.&lt;ref name = Cawk102/&gt; The Thebans and Thessalians requested that he take the leadership of Greece, and punish Phocis; conversely, the Phocians, supported by the Spartans and the Athenian delegations, pleaded with Philip not to attack Phocis.&lt;ref name = Cawk102/&gt; Philip, however, delayed making any decisions; "[he] sought by every means not to reveal how he intended to settle things; both sides were privately encouraged to hope that he would do as they wanted, but both were bidden not to prepare for war; a peacefully arranged concordat was at hand"; he also delayed taking the oaths to the Peace of Philocrates.&lt;ref name = Cawk103&gt;Cawkwell, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Military preparations were ongoing in Pella during this period, but Philip told the ambassadors that they were for a campaign against [[Alos, Greece|Halus]], a small Thessalian city which held out against him.&lt;ref name = Cawk103/&gt; He departed for Halus before making any pronouncements, compelling the Athenian embassy to travel with him; only when they reached Pherae did Philip finally take the oaths, enabling the Athenian ambassadors to return home.&lt;ref name = Cawk103/&gt;

==Settlement of the Sacred War==
{{main article|Third Sacred War#Settlement of the Sacred War}}

The Peace of Philocrates is intimately linked with the final end of the Sacred War. It was in the aftermath of finally ratifying the Peace that Philip applied the ''coup de grace''. He had persuaded the Athenians and other Greeks that he and his army was heading for Halus, but it seems certain that he also sent other units straight to Thermopylae.&lt;ref name = Cawk103/&gt; Thus, when he swore oaths to the Athenian assembly in Pherae, his troops were already very close to Thermopylae; by the time the Athenian ambassadors arrived home (9 July), Philip was already in possession of the pass.&lt;ref name = Cawk103/&gt; By delaying the oaths, and making what was effectively a feint against Halus, he prevented the Athenians from seeing their imminent danger, and from having time to try to garrison Thermopylae.&lt;ref name = Cawk109&gt;Cawkwell, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Buck478&gt;Buckley, p. 478.&lt;/ref&gt;

All of central and southern Greece was now at Philip's mercy,&lt;ref name = Buck478/&gt; and the Athenians could not now save Phocis even if they abandoned the peace.&lt;ref name = Cawk104&gt;Cawkwell, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Athenians were still ignorant of this turn of events when Phocian ambassadors came to Athens to plead for military aid around 9 July.&lt;ref name = Cawk104/&gt; The Athenian council recommended that the peace be rejected, and Thermopylae be occupied in order to help save Phocis; since, as far at the Athenian embassy knew, Philip's troops were still in Pherae, there seemed to be ample time to occupy the pass.&lt;ref name = Cawk104/&gt; By 12 July the news that Philip was "in the gates" arrived in Athens; the Athenians then knew that the situation was hopeless, and instead of acting on the previous recommendation of the council, the Assembly instead passed a motion re-affirming the Peace of Philocrates.&lt;ref name = Cawk104/&gt; Demosthenes was one of those who recommended this stance. His argumentation, exposed in the oration ''On the Peace'', was based on the fact that Athens was not ready for a war against all the other members of the League led by Philip. Thereby, he advised his countrymen to abide by the provisions of the peace, but he opposed Aeschines, who believed in an alliance between Macedon and Athens.

==Breakdown of the Peace==
Although Demosthenes had been a principal architect of the Peace of Philocrates, almost as soon as it was made, he wished to be rid of it.&lt;ref name = Cawk118/&gt; In July 346 BC, he had been a proponent of saving Phocis, but unlike the rest of the Athenian assembly, he had insisted that the Athenians should still go to the Phocians' aid even when it was known that Philip was in control of Thermopylae.&lt;ref name = Cawk105&gt;Cawkwell, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few years, Demosthenes became leader of the "war-party" in Athens, and at every opportunity he sought to undermine the peace: "His method was simple and effective. He kept hammering away at untruths until enough Athenians came to believe them."&lt;ref name = Cawk118&gt;Cawkwell, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Demosthenes believed that all Philip's successes were due to his bribery and corruption of the Greeks, a view which, although there is little evidence for it, became commonplace until re-examined by modern historians.&lt;ref name = Cawk122&gt;Cawkwell, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, there was also a substantial body of feeling in Athens, led by Aeschines, that the peace should be maintained and developed.&lt;ref name = Cawk120&gt;Cawkwell, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The political trials of the time can be used to gauge sentiment in Athens; in 345 BC, Aeschines prosecuted Demosthenes's ally Timarchus, who was duly convicted; conversely, in 343 BC, Demosthenes prosecuted Aeschines, who was acquitted by the barest of margins. Until 343 BC therefore, the majority of the Athenian assembly therefore favoured maintaining the peace, even though they disliked it.&lt;ref name = Cawk120/&gt; Philocrates himself however, seeing that his policy was generally unpopular, had gone into exile before 343 BC.&lt;ref name = Cawk123&gt;Cawkwell, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 344 and 342 BC, Philip tried to strengthen the peace, by converting it into a 'common peace', that all Greek states which chose to could join.&lt;ref name = Cawk123*&gt;Cawkwell, pp. 123–126.&lt;/ref&gt; In 344 BC, the orator Python was sent by Philip to Athens to defend Philip against the attacks of the war-party, and to propose possible changes to the peace. In response, Demosthenes delivered one of his most effective and famous speeches, the so-called [[Second Philippic]], attacking Philip and all his works.&lt;ref name = Cawk123*/&gt; His ally [[Hegesippus (orator)|Hegesippus]] then proposed that the peace should indeed be amended, such that Philip should cede Amphipolis to Athens. The Assembly, stirred by Demosthenes' oratory, passed the motion, leaving the Macedonian embassy speechless&amp;mdash;clearly, Philip could not, and would not give up Amphipolis.&lt;ref name = Cawk123*/&gt; An Athenian embassy sent to Pella to discuss this proposal was given short shrift by Philip.&lt;ref name = Cawk123*/&gt; However, Philip left the offer of a common peace open until 342 BC, when the Athenians again formally rejected the idea.&lt;ref name = Cawk123*/&gt;

From 343 BC onwards, in order to try to disrupt the peace, Demosthenes and his followers used every expedition and action of Philip to argue that he was breaking the peace.&lt;ref name = Cawk119&gt;Cawkwell, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Cawk133&gt;Cawkwell, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in 342 BC, when Philip campaigned against the Cassopaeans, they declared that Philip was campaigning against [[Ambracia]], and an Athenian expedition was duly dispatched&amp;mdash;but to [[Acarnania]], not Ambracia.&lt;ref name = Cawk116/&gt; Philip however seems to have had no intention of attacking Ambracia, and the expedition thus achieved nothing.&lt;ref name = Cawk116&gt;Cawkwell, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 341 BC, matters began to come to a head. Athens sent out new settlers to the cleruchs on the Chersonsese under the command of [[Diopeithes]], who proceeded to ravage the territory of [[Cardia (Thrace)|Cardia]], an ally of Philip.&lt;ref name = Cawk131&gt;Cawkwell, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip therefore wrote to the Athenians to demand that they desist, but in his speech '[[On the Chersonese]]', Demosthenes persuaded the Athenians that since Athens was effectively at war with Philip anyway, there was no need to do what Philip asked; Diopeithes therefore continued to cause trouble in Thrace.&lt;ref name = Cawk131/&gt; Then, in the [[Third Philippic]] of approximately May 341 BC, Demosthenes accused Philip of breaking the peace by intervening in the affairs of Euboea.&lt;ref name = Cawk132&gt;Cawkwell, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Callias of Chalcis now emerged as a potential ally of the Athenians; still intent on unifying the cities of Euboea under his leadership, he had been disturbed by the number of Euboean cities, particularly [[Eretria|Eretrea]] and [[Oreus]], adopting a pro-Macedonian stance.&lt;ref name = Cawk134*&gt;Cawkwell, p. 134&amp;ndash;135&lt;/ref&gt; In June 341 BC, Athens and Chalcis allied themselves, and proceeded to attack Eritrea and Oreus and install suitable governance in those cities. Callias then proceeded to harass the cities and shipping on the Gulf of Pagasae.&lt;ref name = Cawk134*/&gt; Finally, in the [[Fourth Philippic]] delivered later in 341 BC, Demosthenes argued that Athens should send an embassy to the Persian king, requesting money for a forthcoming war with Macedon. The embassy was sent, much to Philip's anger, but was sharply rebuffed by the Persians.&lt;ref name = Cawk134*/&gt;

In 341 BC, Demosthenes travelled to [[Byzantium]], which entered into an alliance with Athens. The Athenian statesman struck a similar deal with [[Abydos, Hellespont|Abydos]], triggering Philip's petulance. The Athenians responded to Philip's grievances, denouncing the terms of the peace treaty, an action entailing the  official declaration of war.

==Aftermath==
{{main article|Rise of Macedon#Final campaign in Greece (339–338 BC)}}

The peace officially collapsed in 338 BC, when Philip passed Thermopylae, attacked the Amphissians, entered Phocis and seized Elateia. Demosthenes convinced the Thebans to enter their alliance against Macedon, when Philip made a final attempt to appease his enemies, proposing a new peace treaty.&lt;ref name="Plutarch"&gt;Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 20&lt;/ref&gt; After his victory at the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]], Philip as the absolute ruler of ancient [[Greece]] imposed a new peace treaty, whose terms were very favorable for the defeated party but not as favorable as in the Peace of Philocrates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5625">'''Pearl Joyce Vardon''' (5 April 1915 in [[Jersey]], [[Channel Islands]] – 1972, [[London]]) was a British broadcaster of [[Nazi propaganda]] during [[World War II]]. In 1946 she was convicted of an offence under the [[Defence Regulations]] and sentenced to nine months' imprisonment.

==Biography==
Pearl Vardon was a school teacher on Jersey when the island fell under the [[German occupation of the Channel Islands]] in 1940. As she spoke German, she found herself ordered by the German administration to work locally as an interpreter for a construction company based in [[Cologne]].

She began a relationship with a [[Wehrmacht]] officer, [[Oberleutnant]] Siegfried Schwatlo, and when he was posted to Germany in 1944 she decided to go with him.

==Propaganda for Nazi Germany==
Vardon began employment as an announcer at [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] for the DES, the Deutsche Europasender. She introduced music and programmes such as ''Ladies First'' which criticised the USA and praised Germany's social security system, and ''Matters of Moment'' which gave news from a German perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/nov/10/freedomofinformation.politics1|title=Love led woman to be Nazi propaganda tool|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 November 2000|accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; More significantly, in ''For the Forces and their Kin'', she read out letters written by British [[POW]]s for their families back home. A German colleague later said of Vardon's attitude that she "simply hated all things English and loved all things German".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7nt8S3fJzSAC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=%22susan+hilton%22+buf&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q37gUJrzN-ub1AXet4HYBA&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pearl%20vardon&amp;f=false|title=Treason of the Heart: From Thomas Paine to Kim Philby|page=173|author=[[David Pryce-Jones]]|publisher=[[Encounter Books]]|year=2011|accessdate=2012-12-30| ISBN=	1-5940-3528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid 1944 she was evacuated to [[Berlin]] and in October 1944 she was working at [[Apen]] in [[Lower Saxony]] until the [[Red Army]] drew close on the advancing [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].

==Arrest and trial==
Vardon fled from Apen to [[Wilhelmshaven]], arriving on 30 April 1945. She was arrested there when she enquired how to obtain new identity papers and she was then held by the [[British Army]] at Esterwegen Internment Camp, the former [[Esterwegen concentration camp]], where she was interrogated.

Vardon was tried at the [[Old Bailey]] in February 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATID=5133986&amp;CATLN=6&amp;accessmethod=5#summary|title=Piece reference CRIM 1/1761|publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]|accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; There she pleaded guilty to the offence of ‘doing an act likely to assist the enemy’ and was given a nine-month prison sentence.

==After release==
Pearl Vardon eventually married Siegfried Schwatlo in 1950 at [[Abergavenny]], [[Monmouthshire]]. Her subsequent life is unknown.

==Declassified files==
The declassified [[MI5]] files on her were released by the [[Public Record Office]] in 2000. They show that British prosecutors were inclined to take a more lenient attitude towards female collaborators such as Vardon and Margaret Joyce, the wife of the traitor [[William Joyce]], than with their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/nov2000.pdf|title=Release of MI5 material relating to the Second World War|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MI5 report on Vardon states, ‘Her motive seems to have been the clear one of avoiding as much as possible separation from the German officer with whom she fell in love’ but added, ‘It is just possible that her motives were not so simple as they appear to have been on the surface’. The [[MI5|Security Service]] file on her is held by The [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]] under reference [http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/browse/r/r/C10907225 KV 2/256] and the [[Home Office]] file on her is held there under reference [http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/browse/r/h/C4769614 HO 45/25811].

'''Ping-pong diplomacy''' ({{zh|乒乓外交}} ''Pīngpāng wàijiāo'') refers to the exchange of [[table tennis]] (ping-pong) players between the [[United States]] and [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) in the early 1970s. The event marked a thaw in [[China–United States relations|Sino-American relations]] that paved the way to a [[1972 Nixon visit to China|visit to Beijing by President Richard Nixon]].

== History ==
=== Background ===
The United States viewed the People's Republic of China as an aggressor nation and enforced an economic containment policy including an embargo on the PRC, following its entry into the [[Korean War]] in 1950. After approximately 20 years of neither diplomatic nor economic relations, both countries finally saw an advantage in opening up to each other: China viewed closer relations with the United States as a beneficial counter to its increasingly tense relationship with the Soviet Union, while the U.S. sought closer relations with China as leverage in its peace negotiations with North Vietnam.

"[T]he thirty-first World Table Tennis Championships, held in Nagoya, Japan, provided an opportunity for both China and the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Turbulent Decade: A History of the Cultural Revolution|last=Jiaqi|first=Yan|last2=Gao|first2=Gao|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8248-1695-7|pages=433|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Process ===
The U.S. Table Tennis team was in [[Nagoya, Japan]] in 1971 for the [[1971 World Table Tennis Championships|31st World Table Tennis Championships]] on April 6 when they received an invitation to visit China. From the early years of the People's Republic, sports had played an important role in diplomacy, often incorporating the slogan "Friendship First, Competition Second". During the isolationist years, athletes were among the few PRC nationals who were allowed to travel overseas.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} On April 10, 1971, the team and accompanying journalists became the first American delegation to set foot in the Chinese capital since 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting was facilitated by the [[National Committee on United States – China Relations]]. Prior to the visit by the American table tennis players, eleven Americans were admitted into the PRC for one week because they all professed affiliation with the [[Black Panther Party]] which followed a [[Maoist]] political line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/usa/workers/black-panthers/|title=History of the Black Panther Party|last=Baggins|first=Brian|date=2002|website=marxists.org|access-date=May 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was unusual, given that high-profile American citizens such as Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] expressed interest in visiting China after the 1968 presidential election, but even he could not have a trip arranged for him despite his office.

According to ''History of U.S. Table Tennis'' by [[Tim Boggan]], who went to China along with the U.S. Table Tennis Team, three incidents may have triggered their invitation from China. [[Wales|Welshman]] [[H. Roy Evans]], then President of the [[International Table Tennis Federation]], claimed that he visited China prior to the 31st World Table Tennis Championship and suggested to non-Chinese sports authorities and Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] that China should take steps to get in contact with the world through international sport events after the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Furthermore, the American player [[Leah Neuberger|Leah "Miss Ping" Neuberger]], the 1956 World Mixed Doubles Champion and nine-time U.S. Open Women's Singles Champion, was traveling at the time with the Canadian Table Tennis Team that had been invited by China to visit the country. China diplomatically extended its approval of Leah Neuberger's application for a visa to the entire American team. The third incident, perhaps the most likely trigger, was the unexpected but dramatic meeting between the flamboyant American player [[Glenn Cowan]] and the Chinese player [[Zhuang Zedong]], a three-time world champion and winner of many other table tennis events. Zhuang Zedong described the incident&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The events leading up to the encounter began when Glenn Cowan missed his team bus one afternoon after his practice in [[Nagoya]] during the 31st World Table Tennis Championship. Cowan had been practicing for 15 minutes with the Chinese player, [[Liang Geliang]], when a Japanese official came and wanted to close the training area. As Cowan looked in vain for his team bus, a Chinese player{{who|date=May 2014}} waved to him to get on his Chinese team bus. Moments after his casual talking through an interpreter to the Chinese players{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}, Zhuang Zedong came up from his back seat to greet him and presented him with a silk-screen portrait of [[Huangshan Mountains]], a famous product from Hangzhou. Cowan wanted to give something back, but all he could find from his bag was a comb. The American hesitantly replied, "I can't give you a comb. I wish I could give you something, but I can't." This World Table Tennis Championships marked the return of China's participation after a six-year absence. When the Chinese team and Cowan walked off the bus, journalists who were following the Chinese team took photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teamusa.org/News/2008/June/12/From-Ping-Pong-Diplomacy-to-the-Beijing-Games|title=From Ping Pong Diplomacy to the Beijing Games|publisher=Team USA|date=Jun 12, 2008|accessdate=May 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the political climate of the 1960s, the sight of an athlete of Communist China with an athlete of the United States was sure to garner attention. Glenn Cowan later bought a T-shirt with a red, white and blue [[peace symbol|peace emblem]] flag and the words "[[Let It Be]]," which he presented to Zhuang Zedong at another chance meeting.

When a journalist asked Cowan, "Mr. Cowan, would you like to visit China?", he answered, "Well, I'd like to see any country I haven't seen before--Argentina, Australia, China, ... Any country I haven't seen before." "But what about China in particular? Would you like to go there?" "Of course," said Glenn Cowan.

During an interview in 2002 with the famous TV personality [[Chen Luyu]], [[Zhuang Zedong]] told more of the story: "The trip on the bus took 15 minutes, and I hesitated for 10 minutes. I grew up with the slogan 'Down with the American imperialism!' And during the [[Cultural Revolution]], the string of class struggle was tightened unprecedentedly, and I was asking myself, 'Is it okay to have anything to do with your No. 1 enemy?'" Zhuang recalled remembering that Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] met [[Edgar Snow]] on the Rostrum of [[Tiananmen]] on the [[National Day]] in 1970 and said to Snow that China should now place its hope on American people.
Zhuang looked in his bag and first went through some pins, [[Chairman Mao badge|badges with Mao's head]], silk handkerchiefs, and fans. But he felt these were not decent enough to be a good gift. He finally picked the silk portrait of Huangshan Mountains. On the following day, many Japanese newspapers carried photographs of Zhuang Zedong and Glenn Cowan.

When the Chinese Department of Foreign Affairs received a report that the U.S. Table Tennis Team hoped to get invited to visit China, the Department declined as usual. [[Zhou Enlai]] and [[Mao Zedong]] initially agreed with the decision, but when [[Mao Zedong]] saw the news in ''[[Dacankao]]'', a newspaper accessible only to high-ranking government officials, he decided to invite the U.S. Table Tennis Team. It was reported that Mao Zedong said, "This Zhuang Zedong not only plays table tennis well, but is good at foreign affairs, and he has a mind for politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 10, 1971, nine American players, four officials, and two spouses stepped across a bridge from [[Hong Kong]] to the Chinese mainland and then spent their time during April 11–17 playing fun matches, touring the [[Great Wall]] and [[Summer Palace]], and watching a [[ballet]].

===Legacy===
*During the week of July 8, 1971, a three-day ping-pong diplomacy event was held at the [[Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum]] in Yorba Linda, California. Original members of both the Chinese and American ping-pong teams from 1971 were present and competed again.
*In 1988, table tennis became an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] sport.
*Ping-pong diplomacy was referenced in the 1994 film ''[[Forrest Gump]]''. After suffering injuries in battle, Forrest develops an aptitude for the sport and joins the U.S. Army team—eventually competing against Chinese teams on a goodwill tour.

==Reactions==
Upon his return to the United States, one of the American players told reporters that the Chinese were very similar to people in the U.S. He said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The people are just like us. They are real, they're genuine, they got feeling. I made friends, I made genuine friends, you see. The country is similar to America, but still very different. It's beautiful. They got the Great Wall, they got plains over there. They got an ancient palace, the parks, there's streams, and they got ghosts that haunt; there's all kinds of, you know, animals. The country changes from the south to the north. The people, they have a, a unity. They really believe in their Maoism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Nixon's visit==
[[File:Nixon at an athletic exhibition in Peking - NARA - 194757.tif|thumb|right|250px|Nixon attending a ping-pong exhibition in Beijing.]]
{{Main|1972 Nixon visit to China}}
Two months after Richard Nixon's visit, [[Zhuang Zedong]] visited the U.S. as the head of a Chinese table-tennis delegation, April 12–30, 1972. Also on the itinerary were [[Canada]], [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]]. However, China's attempts to reach out to countries through "ping-pong diplomacy" were not always successful, such as when the All Indonesia Table Tennis Association (PTMSI) refused China's invitation in October 1971, claiming that accepting the PRC's offer would improve the PRC's reputation. Because neither [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] athletes nor journalists appeared in China following the appearance of the American players and journalists, one speculation is that the act showed the equal scorn of both countries towards the USSR.

== Result ==
Ping-pong diplomacy was successful and resulted in opening the U.S.-PRC relationship, leading the U.S. to lift the embargo against China on June 10, 1971. On February 28, 1972, during President Nixon and Henry Kissinger's visit to Shanghai, the [[Shanghai Communiqué|Shanghai Communique]] was issued between the U.S. and the PRC. The Communique noted that both nations would work towards the normalization of their relations. Furthermore, the U.S. recognized that Taiwan is a part of China and agreed not to interfere in issues between China and Taiwan.

== 1991 united Korean Team ==
Another example of Ping Pong Diplomacy occurred during the [[World Table Tennis Championships|1991 World Table Tennis Championships in Chiba]], Japan, where a unified Korean team played together for the first time since the Korean War.

The diplomatic efforts leading to the formation of this unified team were led by then-[[International Table Tennis Federation|International Table Tennis Federation President]], [[Ichiro Ogimura]].

Prior to the championships, Ogimura visited [[South Korea]] 20 times and traveled to [[North Korea]] 15 times to plead for a unified team from the [[Korean Peninsula|Korean peninsula]]. Ogimura also worked with local Japanese government heads to create joint training camps in the cities of Nagano, Nagaoka and Chiba, and secured agreement from the [[ITTF]] for North Korea and South Korea to compete under the unified name of “Korea”.

The Korean team played under a white flag depicting the Korean peninsula in blue and used the Korean [[Folk music|folksong]], [[Arirang]], rather than the national anthem of either the North or the South.

The competition saw the Korean team win one gold medal, one silver and two bronze medals.

This action has since been repeated. At the 2018 World Team Table Tennis Championships, the two Koreas entered separate teams in the competition but, when they were paired against each other at the quarter-final of the women's event, they negotiated instead to field a joint team for the semi-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nippon.com/en/column/g00550/|title=Table Tennis Diplomacy that Brought the Koreas Together|date=2018-06-12|work=nippon.com|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Piłsudskiite''' ({{Lang-pl|'''Piłsudczyk'''}}) was a supporter of [[Poland]]'s Marshal [[Józef Piłsudski]], founder of the [[World War I]]-era [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]] and the first [[Naczelnik Państwa|Chief of State]] of the [[Second Republic of Poland]]. The Piłsudskiites had a major influence on Polish [[politics]] in the [[interwar period]].

==History==
Piłsudski was the dominant political figure in the [[Interbellum|interwar]] Second Polish Republic. Most of the successive governments favored Pilsudski, who served as [[Naczelnik Panstwa|Chief of State]] from 1918 to 1922 and as Prime Minister in 1926-28 and for several months in 1930. Piłsudski was highly influential and never dropped out of public life, remaining active in Polish politics and exercising considerable influence until his death in May 1935. Piłsudski special position was highlighted by his holding the position of the [[General Inspector of the Armed Forces]], which was created specifically for him and wasn't responsible to the [[Sejm]] (parliament) but only to the [[President of Poland|President]].

In May 1926 Piłsudskiite forces conducted the [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]], deposing the legally elected government and installing their own. The ''[[Sanacja]]'' political camp was formed and Piłsudski's power grew. The ''Sanacja'' began to strengthen its own power and curb the activities of opposition political parties. Many parties in that time became Piłsudskiite to get closer to power and stay safe from potential problems.

When Piłsudski died in May 1935, the Piłsudskiite ''Sanacja'' movement lost its leader. The political situation in Poland became radicalized and the pressure of opposition camps on the ruling ''Sanacja'' (especially from the right-wing [[National Democracy]]) became stronger. In order to unite the Piłsudskiites and hold on to power, the leading Piłsudskiite politicians formed the [[Camp of National Unity]].

In order to gain voters from the opposition National Democracy, the Camp of National Unity radicalized its program and even took some issues from the opposition right-wing camp, and became more nationalist. Still it advocated Piłsudski's points of view and followed his political heritage.

{{Party politics}}
A '''political spectrum''' is a system of classifying different [[politics|political]] positions upon one or more [[geometry|geometric]] [[coordinate axis|axes]] that represent independent political dimensions.

Most long-standing spectra include a [[left wing]] and [[right wing]], which originally  referred to seating arrangements in the French parliament after the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] (1789–1799).&lt;ref name="Knapp5ed"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Knapp, Andrew |author2=Wright, Vincent |title=The Government and Politics of France |date=2006 |publisher=Taylor and Francis |isbn=0-203-40260-X |edition=5 |url=https://s3-euw1-ap-pe-ws4-capi2-distribution-p.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/books/9780203003497/9780203003497_googleScholarPDF.pdf?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%229781134247912_googlepreview.pdf%22&amp;response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&amp;x-amz-security-token=FQoGZXIvYXdzEEYaDC12k9aKSsqdCDcHRiK3A7ovZerStO4eI3M8JICn0VHOfeXavdRNyFaCQlIuQ5xBi06cKJW2fGIAEakKjvbdvEgRkZ9yqrBnywhVrpaLwNEMsZoiJaOfBEDit4h0hmR3XAovZkXWTSF7VKlWpLqJKJZALky1tHPisAdhP%2B1QZAH%2FDrsHx%2F%2FKS6iHqPxR2ogRUvPn4Rw%2BY260GubnNzKAF1bzFFZeMNtiqGa0CtkLXsCMyBbBqGl4tzExr7I2xbkZl6K5jNL9NELR50wfFfzgLqpPScNz%2BStHFJeHr5fkmQa5DtlbDYoHGJ1uA7pAIiPSYXO6K7WcmqYgknkPaRkXN0bS6fVOgsjjeUmR3yYUcsXyw%2FZjziBTM%2F8zddIGDGbJn3B7aUTA1rXfnv2DX9ghCOwKMHuFovGCHZXYR0lPR906GDtv%2BKRT0bk%2F1qiP514Z7AqgDm3aSzr0tg8pBLFHeCkxc8b%2FkIpHdcSr0PC9S6O0fMe0pESFkg3%2Bb0%2FB1OE2HF2fIbQEoPKzjoruhM%2FydSA1xb6vG%2FT8AOJswIoTQkCjNwSh3DyiXQpMdeMwR5GwXp7UHyAw0iK4ElpI7OiF9TNJPeOkSQ0o4anR3gU%3D&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAQFVOSJ57R7TRZPLU&amp;Expires=1541251649&amp;Signature=fslwfmNkm6IhLTDBKMjZjoz3PXg%3D |language=English |format=ebk |chapter=1 French political traditions in a changing context |quote=France invented the terms Left and Right early in the great Revolution of 1789– 94 which first limited the powers of, and then overthrew, the Bourbon monarchy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a [[Left–right politics|left–right]] spectrum, [[communism]] and [[socialism]] are usually regarded internationally as being on the left, whereas [[conservatism]] and [[capitalism]] are on the right. [[Liberalism]] can mean different things in different contexts, sometimes on the left ([[social liberalism]]), sometimes within libertarianism ([[classical liberalism]]). Those with an intermediate outlook are classified as [[Centrism|centrists]] or moderates. Politics that rejects the conventional left–right spectrum is known as [[syncretic politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ssUAQAAIAAJ|title=Fascism|last=Griffin|first=Roger|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-19-289249-2|pages=8,307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tP2wXl5nzboC|title=The fascism reader|last=Eatwell|first=Roger|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=978-0-415-24359-9|editor-last=Kallis|editor-first=Aristotle A.|page=71|chapter=A 'Spectral-Syncretic' Approach to Fascism|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=tP2wXl5nzboC&amp;pg=PA71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Political science|Political scientists]] have frequently noted that a single left–right axis is insufficient for describing the existing variation in political beliefs and often include other axes. Though the descriptive words at polar opposites may vary, often in popular biaxial spectra the axes are split between sociocultural issues and economic issues, each scaling from some form of [[individualism]] (or government for the freedom of the individual) to some form of [[communitarianism]] (or government for the welfare of the community).

== Historical origin of the terms ==
The terms ''right'' and ''left'' refer to political affiliations originating early in the French Revolutionary era of 1789–1799 and referred originally to the seating arrangements in the [[Glossary of the French Revolution#Governmental structures|various legislative bodies]] of [[France]].&lt;ref name="Knapp5ed"/&gt; As seen from the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]]'s seat at the front of the Assembly, the [[aristocracy]] sat on the right (traditionally the seat of honor) and the [[commoner]]s sat on the left, hence the terms [[right-wing politics]] and [[left-wing politics]].&lt;ref name="Knapp5ed"/&gt;

Originally, the defining point on the ideological spectrum was the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' ("old order"). "The Right" thus implied support for aristocratic or royal interests and the church, while "The Left" implied support for [[republicanism]], [[secularism]] and [[civil liberties]].&lt;ref name="Knapp5ed"/&gt; Because the [[political franchise]] at the start of the [[revolution]] was relatively narrow, the original "Left" represented mainly the interests of the [[bourgeoisie]], the rising [[Capitalism|capitalist class]] (with notable exceptions such as the proto-communist [[François-Noël Babeuf|Gracchus Babeuf]]). Support for ''[[laissez-faire]]'' commerce and [[free market]]s were expressed by politicians sitting on the left because these represented policies favorable to capitalists rather than to the aristocracy, but outside parliamentary politics these views are often characterized as being on the Right.

The reason for this apparent contradiction lies in the fact that those "to the left" of the parliamentary left, outside official parliamentary structures (such as the ''[[sans-culottes]]'' of the French Revolution), typically represent much of the working class, poor peasantry and the unemployed. Their political interests in the French Revolution lay with opposition to the aristocracy and so they found themselves allied with the early capitalists. However, this did not mean that their economic interests lay with the ''laissez-faire'' policies of those representing them politically.

As capitalist economies developed, the aristocracy became less relevant and were mostly replaced by capitalist representatives. The size of the working class increased as capitalism expanded and began to find expression partly through trade unionist, socialist, anarchist and communist politics rather than being confined to the capitalist policies expressed by the original "left". This evolution has often pulled parliamentary politicians away from laissez-faire economic policies, although this has happened to different degrees in different countries, especially those with a history of issues with more authoritarian-left countries, such as the [[Soviet Union]] or [[China]] under [[Mao Zedong]].

Thus the word "[[American Left|Left]]" in American political parlance may refer to "liberalism" and be identified with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], whereas in a country such as France these positions would be regarded as relatively more right-wing, or centrist overall, and "left" is more likely to refer to "socialist" or "social-democratic" positions rather than "liberal" ones.

== Academic investigation ==
For almost a century, social scientists have considered the problem of how best to describe political variation.

=== Leonard W. Ferguson ===
In 1950, Leonard W. Ferguson analyzed political values using ten scales measuring attitudes toward: [[birth control]], [[capital punishment]], [[censorship]], [[communism]], [[evolution]], [[law]], [[patriotism]], [[theism]], treatment of [[criminals]] and [[war]]. Submitting the results to [[factor analysis]], he was able to identify three factors, which he named [[religionism]], [[humanitarianism]] and [[nationalism]]. He defined religionism as [[belief in God]] and negative attitudes toward [[evolution]] and [[birth control]]; humanitarianism as being related to attitudes opposing war, capital punishment and harsh [[Criminal justice|treatment of criminals]]; and nationalism as describing variation in opinions on censorship, law, patriotism and communism.

This system was derived empirically, as rather than devising a political model on purely theoretical grounds and testing it, Ferguson's research was exploratory. As a result of this method, care must be taken in the interpretation of Ferguson's three factors, as factor analysis will output an abstract factor whether an objectively real factor exists or not.&lt;ref&gt;SAS(R) 3.11 Users Guide, [http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/stsug/62259/HTML/default/viewer.htm#ugmultfactor.htm Multivariate Analysis: Factor Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt; Although replication of the nationalism factor was inconsistent, the finding of religionism and humanitarianism had a number of replications by Ferguson and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ferguson, L.W. |title=The Stability of the Primary Social Attitudes: I. Religionism and Humanitarianism |journal=Journal of Psychology |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=283–8 |year=1941 |doi=10.1080/00223980.1941.9917075 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00223980.1941.9917075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kirkpatrick, C. |title=Religion and humanitarianism: a study of institutional implications |journal=Psychological Monograph |volume=63 |issue=9 |year=1949 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hans Eysenck ===
[[File:Political spectrum Eysenck.png|thumb|Diagram of the political spectrum according to Hans Eysenck]]
Shortly afterward, [[Hans Eysenck]] began researching political attitudes in [[Great Britain]]. He believed that there was something essentially similar about the National Socialists ([[Nazism|Nazis]]) on the one hand and the communists on the other, despite their opposite positions on the [[Left–right politics|left–right axis]]. As Hans Eysenck described in his 1956 book ''Sense and Nonsense in Psychology'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ditext.com/eysenck/politics.html|title=politics|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eysenck compiled a list of political statements found in newspapers and political tracts and asked subjects to rate their agreement or disagreement with each. Submitting this value questionnaire to the same process of [[factor analysis]] used by Ferguson, Eysenck drew out two factors, which he named "Radicalism" (R-factor) and "Tender-Mindedess" (T-factor).

Such analysis produces a factor whether or not it corresponds to a real-world phenomenon and so caution must be exercised in its interpretation. While Eysenck's R-factor is easily identified as the classical "left–right" dimension, the T-factor (representing a factor drawn at right angles to the R-factor) is less intuitive, as high-scorers favored [[pacifism]], [[racial equality]], [[religious education]] and restrictions on [[abortion]], while low-scorers had attitudes more friendly to [[militarism]], harsh [[punishment]], easier [[divorce]] laws and [[Triangular theory of love|companionate]] [[marriage]].

Despite the difference in [[methodology]], [[location (geography)|location]] and [[theory]], the results attained by Eysenck and Ferguson matched. Simply rotating Eysenck's two factors 45 degrees renders the same factors of religionism and humanitarianism identified by Ferguson in America.&lt;ref name="Eysenck"&gt;{{cite book |author=Eysenck, H.J. |title=Sense and nonsense in psychology |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |year=1956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eysenck's dimensions of R and T were found by factor analyses of values in [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eysenck, H.J. |title=Primary social attitudes: A comparison of attitude patterns in England, Germany, and Sweden |journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=563–8 |year=1953 |doi=10.1037/h0054347 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/abn/48/4/563/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[France]]&lt;ref name="Eysenck" /&gt; and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dator, J.A. |chapter=Measuring attitudes across cultures: A factor analysis of the replies of Japanese judges to Eysenck's inventory of conservative-progressive ideology |editor1-last=Schubert |editor2-first=David Joseph |editor2-last=Danelski |title=Comparative judicial behavior: cross-cultural studies of political decision-making in the East and West |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yz5BAAAAIAAJ |year=1969 |publisher=Oxford University Press |editor1-first=Glendon A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One interesting result Eysenck noted in his 1956 work was that in the [[United States]] and Great Britain, most of the political variance was subsumed by the left/right axis, while in France the T-axis was larger and in the [[Middle East]] the only dimension to be found was the T-axis: "Among mid-Eastern Arabs it has been found that while the tough-minded/tender-minded dimension is still clearly expressed in the relationships observed between different attitudes, there is nothing that corresponds to the [[Political radicalism|radical]]-[[conservative]] continuum".&lt;ref name="Eysenck" /&gt;

==== Relationship between Eysenck's political views and political research ====
Eysenck's political views related to his research: Eysenck was an outspoken opponent of what he perceived as the [[authoritarian]] abuses of the left and right and accordingly he believed that with this T axis he had found the link between [[nazism]] and [[communism]]. According to Eysenck, members of both [[ideologies]] were tough-minded. Central to Eysenck's thesis was the claim that tender-minded ideologies were [[democratic ideologies|democratic]] and friendly to [[liberty|human freedom]]s, while tough-minded ideologies were [[aggressive]] and [[authoritarian]], a claim that is open to political criticism. In this context, Eysenck carried out studies on nazism and communist groups, claiming to find members of both groups to be more "dominant" and more "aggressive" than control groups.&lt;ref name="Eysenck" /&gt;

Eysenck left [[Nazi Germany]] to live in Britain and was not shy in attacking [[Stalinism]], noting the [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] prejudices of the Russian government, the luxurious lifestyles of the [[Soviet Union]] leadership and the [[George Orwell|Orwell]]ian "[[doublethink]]" of [[East Germany]]'s naming itself the [[German Democratic Republic]] despite being "one of the most [[dictatorship|undemocratic]] [[regime]]s in the world today".&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, H.J. (1981). "Left-Wing Authoritarianism: Myth or Reality?, by Hans J. Eysenck" ''Political Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt; While Eysenck was an opponent of Nazism, his relationship with [[Fascism|fascist]] organizations was more complex. Eysenck himself lent theoretical support to the English [[National Party (UK, 1976)|National Party]] (which also opposed "Hitlerite" Nazism) and was interviewed in the first issue of their journal ''The Beacon'' in relation to his controversial views on relative intelligence between different races.&lt;ref&gt;"An Interview with Prof. Hans Eysenck", ''Beacon'' February 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Rose, "Racism" ''Nature'' 14 September 1978, volume 275, page 86&lt;/ref&gt; At one point during the interview, Eysenck was asked whether or not he was of Jewish origin before the interviewer proceeded.&lt;ref&gt;Billig, Micheal. (1979) "Psychology, Racism and Fascism", Chapter 6, footnote #70. Published by A.F. &amp; R. Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; His political allegiances were called into question by other researchers, notably [[Steven Rose]], who alleged that his scientific research was used for political purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Rose, "Racism Refuted", ''Nature'' 24 August 1978, volume 274, page 738&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Rose, "Racism", ''Nature'' 14 September 1978, volume 275, page 86&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Subsequent criticism of Eysenck's research ====
Eysenck's conception of tough-mindedness has been criticized for a number of reasons.
* Virtually no values were found to load only on the tough/tender dimension.
* The interpretation of tough-mindedness as a manifestation of "authoritarian" versus tender-minded "democratic" values was incompatible with the [[Frankfurt school]]'s [[single-axis model]], which conceptualized authoritarianism as being a fundamental manifestation of conservatism and many researchers took issue with the idea of "left-wing authoritarianism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stone, W.F. |title=The myth of left-wing authoritarianism |journal=Political Psychology |volume=2 |issue=3/4 |pages=3–19 |year=1980 |jstor=3790998 |doi=10.2307/3790998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The theory which Eysenck developed to explain individual variation in the observed dimensions, relating tough-mindedness to [[extroversion]] and [[psychoticism]], returned ambiguous research results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ray, J.J. |author2=Bozek, R.S. |title=Authoritarianism and Eysenck's P-scale |journal=Journal of Social Psychology |volume=113 |issue=2 |pages=231–4 |year=1981 |doi=10.1080/00224545.1981.9924374 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224545.1981.9924374}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eysenck's finding that Nazis and communists were more tough-minded than members of mainstream political movements was criticised on technical grounds by [[Milton Rokeach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rokeach, Milton |author2=Hanley, Charles |title=Eysenck's Tender-Mindedness Dimension: A critique |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=169–176 |date=March 1956 |doi=10.1037/h0045968 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/53/2/169/ |pmid=13297921}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eysenck's method of analysis involves the finding of an abstract dimension (a factor) that explains the spread of a given set of data (in this case, scores on a political survey). This abstract dimension may or may not correspond to a real material phenomenon and obvious problems arise when it is applied to human psychology. The second factor in such an analysis (such as Eysenck's T-factor) is the second best explanation for the spread of the data, which is by definition drawn at right angles to the first factor. While the first factor, which describes the bulk of the variation in a set of data, is more likely to represent something objectively real, subsequent factors become more and more abstract. Thus one would expect to find a factor that roughly corresponds to "left" and "right", as this is the dominant framing for politics in our society, but the basis of Eysenck's "tough/tender-minded" thesis (the second, T-factor) may well represent nothing beyond an abstract mathematical construct. Such a construct would be expected to appear in factor analysis whether or not it corresponded to something real, thus rendering Eysenck's thesis [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] through factor analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Wiggins, J.S. (1973) Personality and Prediction: Principles of Personality Assessment. Addison-Wesley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lykken, D. T. (1971) Multiple factor analysis and personality research.

''The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Sociology'' 9(3):11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Milton Rokeach ===
Dissatisfied with Hans J. Eysenck's work, Milton Rokeach developed his own two-axis model of political values in 1973, basing this on the ideas of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] and [[Social equality|equality]], which he described in his book, ''The Nature of Human Values''.&lt;ref name="Rokeach"&gt;{{cite book|first=Milton|last=Rokeach|title=The nature of human values|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfRGAAAAMAAJ|year=1973|publisher=Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milton Rokeach claimed that the defining difference between the left and right was that the left stressed the importance of equality more than the right. Despite his criticisms of Eysenck's tough-tender axis, Rokeach also postulated a basic similarity between communism and nazism, claiming that these groups would not value freedom as greatly as more conventional [[Social democracy|social democratics]], [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialists]] and capitalists would and he wrote that "the two value model presented here most resembles Eysenck's hypothesis".&lt;ref name="Rokeach"/&gt;

To test this model, Milton Rokeach and his colleagues used [[content analysis]] on works exemplifying nazism (written by [[Adolf Hitler]]), [[communism]] (written by [[Vladimir Lenin]]), capitalism (by [[Barry Goldwater]]) and [[socialism]] (written by various socialist authors). This method has been criticized for its reliance on the experimenter's familiarity with the content under analysis and its dependence on the researcher's particular political outlooks.

Multiple raters made frequency counts of sentences containing [[synonyms]] for a number of values identified by Rokeach—including freedom and equality—and Rokeach analyzed these results by comparing the relative frequency rankings of all the values for each of the four texts:
* Socialists (socialism) — freedom ranked 1st, equality ranked 2nd
* Hitler (Nazism) – freedom ranked 16th, equality ranked 17th
* Goldwater (capitalism) — freedom ranked 1st, equality ranked 16th
* Lenin (communism) — freedom ranked 17th, equality ranked 1st

Later studies using samples of [[United States|American]] [[ideologue]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rous, G.L.|author2=Lee, D.E.|title=Freedom and Equality: Two values of political orientation|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=28|pages=45–51|date=Winter 1978|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1978.tb01561.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1978.tb01561.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; and American [[President of the United States|presidential]] [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugural address]]es attempted to apply this model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mahoney, J.|author2=Coogle, C.L.|author3=Banks, P.D.|title=Values in presidential inaugural addresses: A test of Rokeach's two-factor theory of political ideology|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=55|pages=683–6|year=1984|url=http://ammonsscientific.com/link.php?N=7553|doi=10.2466/pr0.1984.55.3.683|issue=3|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514224946/https://ammonsscientific.com/link.php?N=7553|archivedate=14 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later research ===
In further research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eysenck, Hans|title=The structure of social attitudes|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=39|pages=463–6|year=1976|url=http://ammonsscientific.com/link.php?N=20755|doi=10.2466/pr0.1976.39.2.463|issue=2|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514221552/https://ammonsscientific.com/link.php?N=20755|archivedate=14 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hans J. Eysenck refined his [[methodology]] to include more questions on [[Economics|economic issues]]. Doing this, he revealed a split in the left–right axis between [[social policy]] and [[economic policy]], with a previously undiscovered dimension of socialism-capitalism (S-factor).

While factorially distinct from Eysenck's previous R factor, the S-factor did positively [[correlate]] with the R-factor, indicating that a basic left–right or right–left tendency underlies both [[value (ethics)|social values]] and [[value system|economic values]], although S tapped more into items discussing [[economic inequality]] and [[big business]], while R relates more to the treatment of criminals and to [[Human sexuality|sexual]] issues and [[military]] issues.

Most research and [[political theory]] since this time has [[replication (scientific method)|replicated]] the factors shown above.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Another replication came from [[Ronald Inglehart]]'s research into national [[opinions]] based on the [[World Values Survey]], although Inglehart's research described the values of [[Country|countries]] rather than [[individuals]] or [[Group (sociology)|groups]] of individuals within [[nations]]. Inglehart's two-factor solution took the form of Ferguson's original religionism and humanitarianism dimensions; Inglehart labelled them "secularism–traditionalism", which covered issues of tradition and religion, like patriotism, [[abortion]], [[euthanasia]] and the importance of [[Obedience (human behavior)|obeying]] the law and [[authority figure]]s, and "survivalism – self expression", which measured issues like everyday conduct and dress, acceptance of [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] (including [[Alien (law)|foreigners]]) and [[innovation]] and [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] towards people with specific controversial [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]] such as [[homosexuality]] and [[vegetarianism]], as well as willingness to engage in political [[activism]].

== Other double-axis models ==
=== Nolan: economic freedom, personal freedom ===
[[File:Nolan chart.svg|thumb|[[Nolan chart]]]]

{{main article|Nolan chart}}
The [[Nolan chart]] was created by libertarian [[David Nolan (Libertarian Party)|David Nolan]]. This chart shows what he considers as "[[economic freedom]]" (issues like taxation, free trade and free enterprise) on the horizontal axis and what he considers as "personal freedom" (issues like [[drug legalization]], [[abortion]] and the [[Conscription|draft]]) on the vertical axis. This puts [[Left-wing politics|left-winger]]s in the left quadrant, [[libertarianism|libertarian]]s in the top, [[Right-wing politics|right-winger]]s in the right and what Nolan originally named [[populism|populists]] in the bottom.

=== Political compass ===
[[File:Political chart.svg|thumb|A chart proposed by the Political Compass Organization]]
{{main article|Political compass}}
The [[political compass]] has two axes. One represents economic issues as right-vs-left. The other represents issues of freedom, or social issues, as authoritarian-vs-libertarian. One can determine their position on the political compass through an [https://www.politicalcompass.org/test online quiz] by the same name.

=== Greenberg and Jonas: left–right, ideological rigidity ===
In a 2003 ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]'' paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Greenberg, J. |author2=Jonas, E. |author2-link=Eva Jonas |title=Psychological Motives and Political Orientation—The Left, the Right, and the Rigid: Comment on Jost et al. (2003) |journal=[[Psychological Bulletin]] |volume=129 |issue=3 |pages=376–382 |year=2003 |doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.129.3.376|url=http://psychoanalystsopposewar.org/resources_files/ConsevatismAsMotivatedSocialCognition_Critique.pdf |format=PDF |author1-link=Jeff Greenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeff Greenberg]] and [[Eva Jonas]] posit a model comprising the standard left–right axis and an axis representing ideological rigidity. For Greenberg and Jonas, ideological rigidity has "much in common with the related concepts of dogmatism and authoritarianism" and is characterized by "believing in strong leaders and submission, preferring one’s own in-group, ethnocentrism and nationalism, aggression against dissidents, and control with the help of police and military". Greenberg and Jonas posit that high ideological rigidity can be motivated by "particularly strong needs to reduce fear and uncertainty" and is a primary shared characteristic of "people who subscribe to any extreme government or ideology, whether it is right-wing or left-wing".

=== Pournelle: liberty–control, irrationalism–rationalism ===
[[File:Inglehart Values Map.svg|thumb|400x400px|A recreation of the [[Ronald Inglehart|Inglehart]]–[[Christian Welzel|Welzel]] cultural map of the world based on the [[World Values Survey]]]]
{{main article|Pournelle chart}}
This very distinct two-axis model was created by [[Jerry Pournelle]] in 1963 for his doctoral dissertation in political science. The [[Pournelle chart]] has [[liberty]] on one axis, with those on the left seeking freedom from control or protections for [[Deviance (sociology)|social deviance]] and those on the right emphasizing state authority or protections for [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] enforcement (farthest right being state worship, farthest left being the idea of a state as the "ultimate evil").  The other axis is [[rationalism]], defined here as the belief in planned social progress, with those higher up believing that there are problems with society that can be rationally solved and those lower down skeptical of such approaches.

=== Inglehart: traditionalist–secular and self expressionist–survivalist ===
In its 4 January 2003 issue, ''[[The Economist]]'' discussed a chart,&lt;ref name="worldvaluessurvey.org"/&gt; proposed by [[Ronald Inglehart|Dr. Ronald Inglehart]] and supported by the [[World Values Survey]] (associated with the [[University of Michigan]]), to plot cultural ideology onto two dimensions. On the y-axis it covered issues of tradition and religion, like [[patriotism]], [[abortion]], [[euthanasia]] and the importance of [[Obedience (human behavior)|obeying]] the law and authority figures. At the bottom of the chart is the traditionalist position on issues like these (with loyalty to country and family and respect for life considered important), while at the top is the secular position. The x-axis deals with self-expression, issues like everyday conduct and dress, acceptance of [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] (including foreigners) and [[innovation]], and attitudes towards people with specific controversial lifestyles such as [[vegetarianism]], as well as willingness to engage in political [[activism]]. At the right of the chart is the open [[Self-expression Values|self-expressionist]] position, while at the left is its opposite position, which Dr. Inglehart calls survivalist. This chart not only has the power to map the values of individuals, but also to compare the values of people in different countries. Placed on this chart, European Union countries in continental Europe come out on the top right, Anglophone countries on the middle right, Latin American countries on the bottom right, African, Middle Eastern and South Asian countries on the bottom left and ex-Communist countries on the top left.

=== Mitchell: ''Eight Ways to Run the Country'' ===
[[File:Mitchell's Eight Political Americans.png|thumb|Mitchell's Eight Political Americans]]
[[File:Mitchell's Eight Ways.png|thumb|Mitchell's Eight Ways]]In 2006, [[Brian Patrick Mitchell]] identified four main political traditions in Anglo-American history based on their regard for ''kratos'' (defined as the use of force) and ''[[archē]]'' or "archy" (defined as the recognition of rank).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Brian Patrick |last=Mitchell |title=Eight ways to run the country: a new and revealing look at left and right |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hg0epWuFdRcC |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing |isbn=978-0-275-99358-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell grounded the distinction of archy and kratos in the West's historical experience of church and state, crediting the collapse of the Christian consensus on church and state with the appearance of four main divergent traditions in Western political thought:
* [[Republicanism|Republican]] [[constitutionalism]] = pro archy, anti kratos
* [[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] [[individualism]] = anti archy, anti kratos
* [[Democracy|Democratic]] [[progressivism]] = anti archy, pro kratos
* [[Plutocratic]] [[nationalism]] = pro archy, pro kratos

Mitchell charts these traditions graphically using a vertical axis as a scale of kratos/[[akrateia]] and a horizontal axis as a scale of archy/[[anarchy]]. He places democratic progressivism in the lower left, plutocratic nationalism in the lower right, republican constitutionalism in the upper right, and libertarian individualism in the upper left. The political left is therefore distinguished by its rejection of archy, while the political right is distinguished by its acceptance of archy. For Mitchell, anarchy is not the absence of government but the rejection of rank. Thus there can be both anti-government [[anarchists]] (Mitchell’s "libertarian individualists") and pro-government anarchists (Mitchell's "democratic progressives", who favor the use of government force against social hierarchies such as [[patriarchy]]). Mitchell also distinguishes between [[Left anarchism|left-wing anarchists]] and [[Anarcho-capitalism|right-wing anarchists]], whom Mitchell renames "akratists" for their opposition to the government’s use of force.

From the four main political traditions, Mitchell identifies eight distinct political perspectives diverging from a populist center. Four of these perspectives (Progressive, Individualist, Paleoconservative, and Neoconservative) fit squarely within the four traditions; four others (Paleolibertarian, Theoconservative, Communitarian, and Radical) fit between the traditions, being defined by their singular focus on rank or force. [[Anthony Gregory]] of the [[Independent Institute]] credits Mitchell with "the best explanation of the political spectrum", saying he "makes sense of all the major mysteries".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Anthony, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/gregory/gregory220.html “What About the 'Real' Left?”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618072926/http://archive.lewrockwell.com/gregory/gregory220.html |date=18 June 2015 }}, Lewrockwell.com, July 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

One alternative spectrum offered by the conservative ''[[American Federalist Journal]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalistjournal.com/spectrum.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051015030139/http://www.federalistjournal.com/spectrum.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 October 2005|title=American Federalist Journal - News and opinion about politics, culture and current events|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; accounts for only the "degree of [[political authority|government control]]" without consideration for any other social or political variable and thus places "fascism" (totalitarianism) at one extreme and "[[anarchism]]" (no government at all) at the other extreme.

== Other proposed dimensions ==

Other proposed axes include:
* In 1998, political author [[Virginia Postrel]], in her book ''[[The Future and Its Enemies]]'', offered another single-axis spectrum that measures views of the future, contrasting stasists, who allegedly fear the future and wish to control it, and dynamists, who want the future to unfold naturally and without attempts to plan and control. The distinction corresponds to the [[utopian]] versus [[dystopian]] spectrum used in some theoretical assessments of liberalism and the book's title is borrowed from the work of the anti-[[utopian]] [[classical liberalism|classic-liberal]] theorist [[Karl Popper]].
* '''Focus of political concern:''' [[communitarianism]] vs. [[individualism]]. These labels are preferred&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horrell|first1=David|title=Paul Among Liberals and Communitarians|journal=Pacifica|date=2005|volume=18|issue=1|pages=33–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the loaded language of "[[totalitarianism]]" (anti-freedom) vs. "[[libertarianism]]" (pro-freedom), because one can have a political focus on the community without being totalitarian and undemocratic. [[Council communism]] is a [[political philosophy]] that would be counted as [[communitarian]] on this axis, but is not totalitarian or undemocratic.
* '''Responses to conflict:''' according to the political philosopher [[Charles Blattberg]], those who would respond to conflict with conversation should be considered as on the left, with negotiation as in the centre, and with force as on the right. See his essay "Political Philosophies and Political Ideologies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blattberg |first=Charles |authorlink= Charles Blattberg |chapter= Political Philosophies and Political Ideologies |ssrn= 1755117 |title= Patriotic Elaborations: Essays in Practical Philosophy |publisher= McGill-Queen's University Press |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Role of the church:''' [[clericalism]] vs. [[anti-clericalism]]. This axis is less significant in the [[United States]] (where views of the role of [[religion]] tend to be subsumed into the general left–right axis) than in [[Europe]] (where clericalism versus anti-clericalism is much less correlated with the left–right spectrum).
* '''Urban vs. Rural:''' This axis is significant today in the [[politics of Europe]], [[Politics of Australia|Australia]] and [[Politics of Canada|Canada]]. The [[Urban area|urban]] vs. [[rural]] axis was equally prominent in the [[United States]]' political past, but its importance is debatable at present. In the late 18th century and early 19th century in the United States, it would have been described as the conflict between [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamiltonian]] [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalists]] and [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian Republicans]].
* '''Foreign policy:''' [[interventionism (politics)|interventionism]] (the nation should exert power abroad to implement its policy) vs. [[non-interventionism]] (the nation should keep to its own affairs). Similarly, [[multilateralism]] (coordination of policies with other countries) vs. [[isolationism]] and [[unilateralism]]
:* Relations with individual states or groups of states may also be vital to [[party politics]]. During the [[Cold War]], parties often had to choose a position on a scale between pro-American and pro-Soviet Union, although this could at times closely match a left–right spectrum. At other times in history relations with other powerful states has been important. In early [[Canadian history]] relations with [[Great Britain]] were a central theme, although this was not "[[foreign policy]]" but a debate over the proper place of [[Canada]] within the [[British Empire]].
* '''International action:''' [[multilateralism]] (states should cooperate and compromise) versus [[unilateralism]] (states have a strong, even unconditional, right to make their own decisions).
* '''Political violence:''' [[pacifism]] (political views should not be imposed by violent force) vs. militancy (violence is a legitimate or necessary means of political expression). In [[North America]], particularly in the United States, holders of these views are often referred to as "[[War doves|doves]]" and "[[War hawk|hawks]]", respectively.
* '''Foreign trade:''' [[globalization]] (world economic markets should become integrated and interdependent) vs. [[autarky]] (the nation or polity should strive for economic independence). During the early history of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]], this was the major political continuum. At that time it was called [[free trade]] vs. [[protectionism]].
* '''Trade freedom vs. trade equity:''' free trade (businesses should be able trade across borders without regulations) vs. [[fair trade]] (international trade should be regulated on behalf of social justice).
* '''Diversity:''' [[multiculturalism]] (the nation should represent a diversity of cultural ideas) vs. [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilationism]] or [[nationalism]] (the nation should primarily represent, or forge, a majority culture).
* '''Participation:''' [[democracy]] (rule of the majority) vs. [[aristocracy]] (rule by the enlightened, elitism) vs. [[tyranny]] (total degradation of Aristocracy, ancient Greek philosophers such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] recognized tyranny as a state in which the tyrant is ruled by utter [[Stoic passions|passion]], and not reason like the [[philosopher]], resulting in the tyrant pursuing his own desires rather than the common good.)
* '''Freedom:''' [[positive liberty]] (having rights which impose an obligation on others) vs. [[negative liberty]] (having rights which prohibit interference by others).
* '''Social power:''' [[totalitarianism]] vs. [[anarchism]] (control vs. no control) Analyzes the fundamental political interaction among people, and between individuals and their environment. Often posits the existence of a moderate system as existing between the two extremes.
* '''Change:''' [[Political radicalism|radicals]] (who believe in rapid change) and [[progressivism|progressives]] (who believe in measured, incremental change) vs. [[conservatism|conservatives]] (who believe in preserving the status quo) vs. [[Reactionary|reactionaries]] (who believe in changing things to a previous state).
* '''Origin of state authority:''' [[popular sovereignty]] (the state as a creation of the people, with enumerated, delegated powers) vs. various forms of [[Autocracy|absolutism]] and [[organic state]] philosophy (the state as an original and essential authority) vs. the view held in [[anarcho-primitivism]] that "civilization originates in conquest abroad and repression at home".&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Stanley, ''In Search Of The Primitive: A Critique Of Civilization'', (New Brunswick: Transaction Books, 1981), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Levels of sovereignty:''' [[Unitary state|unionism]] vs. [[federalism]] vs. [[separatism]]; or [[centralism]] vs. [[regionalism (politics)|regionalism]]. Especially important in societies where strong regional or ethnic identities are political issues.
** [[European integration]] (in Europe): [[Euroscepticism]] vs. [[European federalism]]; [[nation state]] vs. [[multinational state]].
* '''[[Open–closed political spectrum|Openness]]:''' closed ([[cultural conservative|culturally conservative]] and [[protectionism|protectionist]]) vs. open ([[social liberalism|socially liberal]] and [[globalism|globalist]]). Popularised as a concept by [[Tony Blair]] in 2007 and increasingly dominant in 21st century European and North American politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21702750-farewell-left-versus-right-contest-matters-now-open-against-closed-new|title=The new political divide|date=30 July 2016|accessdate=24 April 2017|newspaper=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/publication/politics-closed-party-vs-open-party/|title=The Closed Party vs. the Open Party|first=James|last=Pethokoukis|date=1 July 2016|accessdate=24 April 2017|website=American Enterprise Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political-spectrum-based forecasts ==
As shown by Russian political scientist Stepan S. Sulakshin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sulakshin, S. |title=A Quantitative Political Spectrum and Forecasting of Social Evolution |journal=International Journal of Interdisciplinary Social Sciences |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=55–66 |year=2010 |url=http://iji.cgpublisher.com/product/pub.88/prod.1091}}&lt;/ref&gt; political spectra can be used as a forecasting tool. Sulakshin offered mathematical evidence that stable development (positive dynamics of the vast number of statistic indices) depends on the width of the political spectrum: if it is too narrow or too wide, stagnation or political disasters will result. Sulakshin also showed that in the short run the political spectrum determines the statistic indices dynamic and not vice versa.

A '''polling place'''&lt;ref name="USAdefinition1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/polling-place|title=polling place - definition of polling place in English|website=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is where [[vote]]rs cast their [[ballot]]s in [[election]]s. 

The phrase '''polling station''' is also used in American English&lt;ref name="USAdefinition1"/&gt; and in British English,&lt;ref name="UKdefinition1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/polling_station|title=polling station - definition of polling station in English|website=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; although '''polling place''' is the building&lt;ref name="hfpss"&gt;[http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.asp?lID=58768&amp;sID=25275 Handbook for polling station staff], Accessed 14 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  and '''polling station''' is the specific room&lt;ref name="hfpss"/&gt; (or part of a room) where voters cast their votes. A polling place can contain one or more polling stations.&lt;ref name="hfpss"/&gt;

Since elections generally take place over a one- or two-day span on a periodic basis, often annual or longer, polling places are usually located in facilities used for other purposes, such as [[school]]s, [[Church (building)|churches]], [[stadium|sports halls]], local government [[office]]s, or even private homes, and may each serve a similar number of people. The area may be known as a [[ward (politics)|ward]], [[precinct]], polling district or [[constituency]]. The polling place is staffed by officials (who may be called [[election judge]]s, [[returning officer]]s or other titles) who monitor the voting procedures and assist voters with the election process. [[Scrutineer]]s (or poll-watchers) are independent or partisan observers who attend the poll to ensure the impartiality of the process.

The facility will be open between specified hours depending on the type of election, and political activity by or on behalf of those standing in the ballot is usually prohibited within the venue and immediately surrounding area.

Inside the polling place will be an area (usually a [[voting booth]]) where the voter may select the candidate or party of their choice in secret. If a ballot paper is used this will be placed into a [[ballot box]] in front of witnesses who cannot see for whom the vote has been cast. [[Voting machine]]s may be employed instead.

Some polling places are temporary structures. A portable cabin may be specially sited for an election and removed afterwards.

There are five types of voting technologies that are currently being used in the United States polling locations. These comprise hand-counted paper ballots, mechanical lever machines, punch cards, [[optical character recognition|optically readable]] paper ballots, and electronic voting machines.&lt;ref name="Matter"/&gt; One of the reasons for a tendency toward witnessed final posting or transacting physical systems yet retaining the secret ballot is to reduce [[electoral fraud]].&lt;ref name="Matter"/&gt;

==History==

The word "poll" means "scalp" or "head".  When votes were taken by gathering people together and counting heads, the place where this was done (sometimes an open field) was called the "polls".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onthemedia.org/story/polling-democracy-uneasy-relationship/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/16/politics-and-the-new-machine&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polling places''' used to gather and count ballots in elections have changed significantly over the past 250 years.&lt;ref name="Before Ballots"/&gt; Advances in technology have played a major role in changing the polling places because as the type of ballot changed, the venue in which the ballots are counted also changed.&lt;ref name="Before Ballots"/&gt; One of the main reasons for advancement was to be able to access the results quicker. First was the word ballot, then came the different types of paper ballots, and today we have the electronic balloting systems.

Before there were paper ballots, people would simply call out their selection at the polling place.  This polling place was typically the county courthouse or town hall.&lt;ref name="Before Ballots"/&gt; Sometimes these polls were taken outside of the venue in a more informal fashion.  When the voters came to the town hall to announce their choice, they would get in line to see the judge and swear in.&lt;ref name="Before Ballots"/&gt; Once the voter put his or her hand on the Bible and swore to the judge, they would be allowed to cast one ballot per election.&lt;ref name="Before Ballots"/&gt; The judge acted as the only form of voter identification and it was up to them to be able to identify individuals that had already voted and exclude them from voting again.&lt;ref name="Before Ballots"/&gt;

The use of paper and electronic ballots have been the most widely used form of capturing votes in recent history.&lt;ref name="Before Ballots"/&gt; When paper or electronic ballots are used, the polling place must be professionally organized in order to ensure that the ballots are not tampered with and are accounted for accurately.&lt;ref name="Before Ballots"/&gt; These polls are held inside a building that has been set up in stations to assist voters.  When the voter arrives he or she will be asked to show a form of voter identification(ID not required in the US).&lt;ref name="Before Ballots"/&gt; Once the voter has been properly identified he or she goes to a voting booth where the votes are captured.&lt;ref name="Before Ballots"/&gt; Once all the votes are captured the voter then verifies his or her voting ticket and then submits the ballot to the poll worker, ballot box, or on the computerized ballot.&lt;ref name="Before Ballots"/&gt;

==Polling location effects==
The building where the polling location is sited can have a significant effect on the results of the poll.&lt;ref name="Voting Influence"/&gt; Research shows that polling location may influence how a voter casts his or her ballot.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; This subtle unknown factor can be significant and can sway a close election.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; Individuals may be influenced to behave in a certain way based on environmental cues,&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; i.e. an object or place that can influence how he or she behaves,&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; for example the condition of the building, the name of the building, the ordinary use of the building, or the building decor.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; Researchers have spent much time considering what makes people vote the way they do; they have found that the smallest of changes can have large effects.

Waiting times at polling places have also been a problem in the USA.&lt;ref name="president"/&gt; This has become such a controversial topic that even President Obama in his [[State of the Union address]] on February 12, 2013 mentioned the need to decrease waiting times.&lt;ref name="president"/&gt; He went on to say that it is the duty of Americans to make sure that everyone has not only the right to vote, but the opportunity to vote, without having to wait several hours in line.&lt;ref name="president"/&gt;

===Building usage===
The building used as the polling place has a significant effect on how an individual votes. For example, voting inside a school building, a citizen might be more likely to vote for those in favor of school systems and education.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; This is especially true if the school building you are voting in is in need of general improvement and/or renovation.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; This environmental cue may give a voter firsthand knowledge of what needs there may be in a particular setting.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; In addition, voting inside a church, a citizen might be less likely to vote in favor of stem cell research.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; These cues give a person a sense of satisfaction for voting one way or another in the moment, regardless if that was the way they intended to vote in the first place.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;

===Distance to voting location===
The cost of voting influences whether or not a person will vote. Research shows that the more expensive voting gets, the less likely a person is to vote.&lt;ref name="Location"/&gt; Distance to the polling location is one of the main reasons cost can become an issue for voters.&lt;ref name="Location"/&gt; Minor changes in distance from voters' homes to polling place can change the turnout of voters, which may change the outcome of a close election.&lt;ref name="Can Affect"/&gt; Distance to the polling place is an issue if not every voter has access to vehicle transportation.&lt;ref name="Location"/&gt; According to the research on distance to the polling location by Haspel and Knotts, "To illustrate the range of the effect of distance, we plot our predicted probabilities at the lower and upper bounds of our continuous vehicle available variable. When no one owns a car (vehicle available = 0), the likelihood of voting drops from .664 at a distance of .01 miles to .418 at the median distance of .69 miles. When automobiles are universally available (vehicle available = 1), voters are much less sensitive to changes in distance: the likelihood of voting drops from .444 to .392 over the same distance range".&lt;ref name="Location"/&gt; Voters ultimately value the convenience of polling locations. If a poll is accessible to the citizen they will make an effort, if the citizen has to travel a long distance then voter turnout decreases dramatically".&lt;ref name="Location"/&gt;

===Redistricting===
If a voter changes precincts due to redistricting then the chances of their continuing to vote in future elections decreases.&lt;ref name="Location"/&gt; The confusion that redistricting causes will deter the voter from looking into the new precinct where he or she should now vote.&lt;ref name="Location"/&gt; In addition, the informational costs associated with alerting voters of their new polling location will also affect the voter turnout because it is highly unlikely that funds will be available to allocate to ensure that every voter knows where to vote.&lt;ref name="Location"/&gt; Redistricting can be beneficial in order to provide a convenient location, but careful consideration should be taken before such a decision is made.

===Openness and centralization===
If voters are allowed to vote at any of a number of different locations in the county or district etc., this will increase voter turnout.&lt;ref name="Matter"/&gt; Sometimes a voter's most convenient voting location is near his or her workplace, not necessarily the closest to their residence.&lt;ref name="Matter"/&gt; Having a more open policy of allowing multiple possible locations for a person to vote would encourage those individuals who cannot feasibly commute back and forth from work to vote.&lt;ref name="Matter"/&gt; Having a large conspicuous polling location will ensure that the voters know where they are supposed to vote.&lt;ref name="Matter"/&gt; This will cut down on unnecessary signage and eliminate clutter and confusion.&lt;ref name="Matter"/&gt;

'''Radical environmentalism''' is a grassroots branch of the larger [[environmental movement]] that emerged from an [[ecocentrism]]-based frustration with the co-option of mainstream environmentalism.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} It is the extremist ideology behind the radical environmental movement.

== As a movement ==

=== Philosophy ===
The radical environmental movement aspires to what scholar Christopher Manes calls "a new kind of environmental activism: iconoclastic, uncompromising, discontented with traditional conservation policy, at times illegal..." Radical environmentalism presupposes a need to reconsider [[Western philosophy|Western]] ideas of religion and philosophy (including [[capitalism]], [[patriarchy]]&lt;ref name = ern/&gt;  and [[globalization]])&lt;ref name = jeff1/&gt; sometimes through "resacralising" and reconnecting with nature.&lt;ref name=ern&gt;Manes, Christopher (1990). ''Green Rage: Radical Environmentalism and the Unmaking of Civilization'', Boston: Little, Brown and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement is typified by [[leaderless resistance]] organizations such as [[Earth First!]], which subscribe to the idea of taking [[direct action]] in defense of [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]] including [[civil disobedience]], [[ecotage]] and [[monkeywrenching]].&lt;ref name=ern/&gt; Movements such as the [[Earth Liberation Front]] (ELF) and [[Earth Liberation Army]] (ELA) also take this form of action, although focusing on economic [[sabotage]], rather than civil disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carkeys.co.uk/features/everything_else/914.asp SUV Armageddon Approaching?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103104619/http://www.carkeys.co.uk/features/everything_else/914.asp |date=3 November 2007 }}, ''Car Keys'', 29 August 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Radical environmentalists include [[earth liberation]]ists as well as [[Anarcho-primitivism|anarcho-primitivists]], [[animal liberation movement|animal liberationists]], [[bioregionalism|bioregionalists]], [[green anarchism|green anarchists]], [[deep ecology|deep ecologists]], [[ecopsychology|ecopsychologists]], [[ecofeminism|ecofeminists]], [[neo-Pagan]]s, [[Wicca]]ns, [[third position|Third Positionists]], [[anti-globalisation]] and [[anti-capitalist]] protesters.&lt;ref name=ern/&gt; However, this does not mean that everyone subscribing to those beliefs and values should be considered a radical environmentalist.

While many people believe that the first significant radical environmentalist group was [[Greenpeace]], which made use of [[direct action]] beginning in the 1970s to confront [[whaling]] ships and [[nuclear weapon]]s testers,&lt;ref name=ern2&gt;[[Rex Weyler|Weyler, Rex]] (2004). ''Greenpeace: How a Group of Journalists, Ecologists and Visionaries Changed the World''. Rodale.&lt;/ref&gt; others within the movement, argues as [[Earth Liberation Front]] (ELF) prisoner [[Jeff Luers|Jeff "Free" Luers]], suggests that the movement was established centuries ago.

The alternative tactic of using explosive and [[incendiary device]]s was then established in 1976, by [[John Hanna (activist)|John Hanna]] and others as the [[Environmental Life Force]] (ELF), also now known as the ''original ELF''. The group conducted a campaign of armed actions in northern [[California]] and [[Oregon]], later disbanding in 1978 following Hanna's arrest for placing incendiary devices on seven crop-dusters at the [[Salinas, California]] airport on [[May Day]], 1977.&lt;ref name=elf&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.originalelf.org/# |title=Original ELF |access-date=8 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415040756/http://www.originalelf.org/# |archive-date=15 April 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until over a decade and a half later that this form of [[guerrilla warfare]] resurfaced as the Earth Liberation Front &lt;ref name="Earth Liberation Front"&gt;[http://www.earth-liberation-front.org  Earth Liberation Front]&lt;/ref&gt; using the same ELF [[acronym]].

Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] several laws were passed increasing the penalty for ecoterrorism, and hearings were held in Congress discussing the activity of groups such as the ELF.

Radical environmentalism has been called a [[new religious movement]] by [[Bron Taylor]] (1998).  Taylor contends that "Radical environmentalism is best understood as a new religious movement that views [[environmental degradation]] as an assault on a sacred, natural world."&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;Bron Taylor. ''Religion, Violence and Radical Environmentalism: From Earth First! to the Unabomber to the Earth Liberation Front'', 1998. 10(4)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Bron, 2005.

=== Offshoots ===

Several philosophies have arisen from ideas in radical environmentalism that include [[deep ecology]], [[ecofeminism]], [[social ecology (theory)|social ecology]] and [[bioregionalism]].

Deep Ecology is attributed to [[Arne Næss|Arne Naess]] and is defined as "a normative, ecophilosophical movement that is inspired and fortified in part by our experience as humans in nature and in part by ecological knowledge."&lt;ref name="Deep"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dunlap |first=Riley E. |authorlink= |editor-last=Dunlap |editor-first=Riley E. |editor2-last=Mertig |editor2-first=Angela G. |contribution=Deep Ecology and Radical Environmentalism |title =American Environmentalism: The U.S. Environmental Movement, 1970-1990 |publisher =Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1992 | location=Philadelphia |page=52 |url= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecofeminism originated in the 1970s and draws a parallel between the oppression of women in patriarchal societies and the oppression of the environment.&lt;ref name="Long"&gt;Long, Douglas (2004). ''Ecoterrorism'' (Library in a Book). New York: Facts on File. pp. 21-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social Ecology is an idea attributed to [[Murray Bookchin]], who argued that in order to save the environment, human society needed to copy the structure of nature and decentralize both socially and economically.&lt;ref name="Long"/&gt;

Bioregionalism is a philosophy that focuses on the practical application of Social Ecology, and theorizes on "building and living in human social communities that are compatible with ecological systems".&lt;ref name="Long"/&gt;

'''Samir Amin''' ({{lang-ar|سمير أمين}}) (3 September 1931 – 12 August 2018) was an Egyptian-French [[Marxian economics|Marxian economist]]&lt;ref name=rp/&gt; and [[political scientist]]. He is noted for his introduction of the term [[Eurocentrism]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-12663251/a-brief-biography-of-samir-amin|title=A Brief Biography of Samir Amin |publisher= ''Monthly Review'', Vol. 44, Issue 4, September 1992 {{!}} Online Research Library: Questia|website=www.questia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Amin was born in [[Cairo]], the son of an Egyptian father and a French mother (both medical doctors). He spent his childhood and youth in [[Port Said]]; there he attended a French high school, leaving in 1947 with a [[Baccalauréat]]. From 1947 to 1957 he studied in Paris, gaining a diploma in [[political science]] (1952) before graduating in statistics (1956) and economics (1957). In his autobiography ''Itinéraire intellectuel'' (1990) he wrote that in order to spend a substantial amount of time in "militant action" he could devote only a minimum of time to preparing for his university exams.

After arriving in Paris, Amin joined the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), but he later distanced himself from [[Soviet Marxism]] and associated himself for some time with [[Maoist]] circles. With other students he published a magazine entitled ''Étudiants Anticolonialistes''. In 1957 he presented his thesis, supervised by [[François Perroux]] among others, originally titled ''The origins of underdevelopment &amp;ndash; capitalist accumulation on a world scale'' but retitled ''The structural effects of the international integration of precapitalist economies. A theoretical study of the mechanism which creates so-called underdeveloped economies''.

After finishing his thesis, Amin went back to Cairo, where he worked from 1957 to 1960 as a research officer for the government's "Institution for Economic Management". Subsequently, Amin left Cairo, to become an adviser to the Ministry of Planning in [[Bamako]] ([[Mali]]) from 1960 to 1963. In 1963 he was offered a fellowship at the ''[[Institut Africain de Développement Économique et de Planification]]'' (IDEP). Until 1970 he worked there as well as being a professor at the university of [[Poitiers]], Dakar and Paris (of Paris VIII, Vincennes). In 1970 he became director of the IDEP, which he managed until 1980. In 1980 Amin left the IDEP and became a director of the [[Third World Forum]] in Dakar.

==Views on world order==
Samir Amin is a convinced adherent of multipolarity: “Yes, I do want to see the construction of a multipolar world, and that obviously means the defeat of Washington’s hegemonic project for military control of the planet.”&lt;ref&gt;Samir Amin, ''Beyond US Hegemony? Assessing the Prospects for a Multipolar World'', (Beirut: World Book Publishing, 2006), p 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he designed the overthrow of what he described as the hegemonic world order:
{{quote|
Here I would make the first priority the construction of a Paris – Berlin – Moscow political and strategic alliance, extended if possible to Beijing and Delhi … to build military strength at a level required by the challenge of the United States... [E]ven the United State pales beside their traditional capacities in the military arena. The American challenge, and Washington’s criminal designs, make such a course necessary … The creation of a front against hegemonism is the number one priority today, as the creation of an [[Allies of World War II|anti-Nazi alliance]] was … yesterday … A rapprochement between the large portions of [[Eurasia]] (Europe, Russia, China and India) involving the rest of the Old World … is necessary and possible, and would put an end once and for all to Washington’s plans to extend the Monroe Doctrine to the entire planet. We must head in this direction … above all with determination.”&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond US Hegemony'', p 17.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The determination, however, is lacking:
{{quote|
The ‘European project’ is not going in the direction that is needed to bring Washington to its senses. Indeed, it remains a basically ‘non-European’ project, scarcely more than the European part of the American project … Russia, China and India are the three strategic opponents of Washington’s project... But they appear to believe that they can maneuver and avoid directly clashing with the United State[s].&lt;ref&gt;Beyond US Hegemony, p 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Hence, Europe must end its “Atlanticist option” and take the course of the “Eurasian rapprochement” with Russia, China, India and the rest of Asia and Africa. This “Eurasian rapprochement” is necessary for the head-on collision with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond US Hegemony'', p 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on political Islam==
According to Samir Amin, [[Islam]] leads its struggle on the terrain of [[culture]], wherein "culture" is intended as "belongingness to one religion".
Islamist militants are not actually interested in the discussion of dogmas which form religion, but on the contrary are concerned about the ritual assertion of membership in the community. Such a [[world view]] is therefore not only distressing, as it conceals an immense poverty of thought, but it also justifies [[Imperialism]]'s strategy of substituting a "conflict of cultures" for a conflict between the liberal, imperialist centres and the backward, dominated peripheries.

This importance attributed to culture allows [[political Islam]] to obscure from every sphere of life the realistic social dichotomy between the working classes and the global capitalist system which oppresses and exploits them.&lt;ref&gt;page 83, "The World We Wish To See; Revolutionary Objectives In The Twenty-First Century", Samir Amin and James Membrez, {{ISBN|1-58367-172-2}}, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-172-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-172-6}}, Publishing Date: Jul 2008, Publisher: Monthly Review Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The militants of political Islam are only present in areas of conflict in order to furnish people with education and health care, through schools and health clinics. However, these are nothing more than works of charity and means of indoctrination, insofar as they are not means of support for the working class struggle against the system which is responsible for its misery.

Besides, beyond being reactionary on definite matters (see the status of [[women in Islam]]) and responsible for fanatical excesses against non-Muslim citizen (such as the [[Copts]] in Egypt), political Islam even defends the sacred character of property and legimitises inequality and all the prerequisites of capitalist reproduction.

One example is the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]'s support in the Egyptian parliament for conservative and reactionary laws which empowers the rights of property owners, to the detriment of the small peasantry.

Political Islam has also always found consent in the bourgeoisie of [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Pakistan]], as the latter abandoned an anti-imperialist perspective and substituted it for an anti-western stance, which only creates an acceptable impasse of cultures and therefore doesn't represent any obstacle to the developing imperialist control over the world system.

Hence, political Islam aligns itself in general with [[capitalism]] and imperialism, without providing the [[working classes]] with an effective and non-reactionary method of struggle against their [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;page 84, "The World We Wish To See; Revolutionary Objectives In The Twenty-First Century", Samir Amin and James Membrez, {{ISBN|1-58367-172-2}}, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-172-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-172-6}}, Publishing Date: Jul 2008, Publisher: Monthly Review Press&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note, however, that Amin is careful to distinguish his analysis of political Islam from [[islamophobia]], thus remaining sensitive to the anti-Muslim attitudes that currently affect Western Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.monthlyreview.org/090330amin.php|title=Comments on Tariq Amin-Khan's text by Samir Amin {{!}} Monthly Review|date=2009-03-21|work=Monthly Review|access-date=2017-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samir Amin is one of the advocates of Marxian dependency theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jal|first=Murzban|date=2018-09-01|title=Remembering Samir Amin (1931–2018)|url=https://www.epw.in/journal/2018/35/commentary/remembering-samir-amin-1931%E2%80%932018.html|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|language=en|volume=53|issue=35|pages=|url-access=subscription|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sociology}}
'''Social construction of technology''' (also referred to as '''SCOT''') is a theory within the field of [[Science and Technology Studies]]. Advocates of SCOT—that is, [[Social constructionism|social constructivists]]—argue that technology does not determine human action, but that rather, human action shapes technology. They also argue that the ways a technology is used cannot be understood without understanding how that technology is embedded in its social context. SCOT is a response to [[technological determinism]] and is sometimes known as technological constructivism.

SCOT draws on work done in the constructivist school of the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]], and its subtopics include [[actor-network theory]]  (a branch of the [[sociology of science and technology]]) and historical analysis of sociotechnical systems, such as the work of historian [[Thomas P. Hughes]]. Its empirical methods are an adaptation of the Empirical Programme of Relativism (EPOR), which outlines a method of analysis to demonstrate the ways in which scientific findings are socially constructed (see [[strong program]]). Leading adherents of SCOT include [[Wiebe Bijker]] and [[Trevor Pinch]].

SCOT holds that those who seek to understand the reasons for acceptance or rejection of a technology should look to the social world. It is not enough, according to SCOT, to explain a technology's success by saying that it is "the best"—researchers must look at how the criteria of being "the best" is defined and what groups and stakeholders participate in defining it. In particular, they must ask who defines the technical criteria success is measured by, why technical criteria are defined this way, and who is included or excluded.  Pinch and Bijker argue that technological determinism is a myth that results when one looks backwards and believes that the path taken to the present was the only possible path.

SCOT is not only a theory, but also a methodology: it formalizes the steps and principles to follow when one wants to analyze the causes of technological failures or successes.

==Legacy of the Strong Programme in the sociology of science==

At the point of its conception, the SCOT approach was partly motivated by the ideas of the [[strong programme]] in the sociology of science (Bloor 1973). In their seminal article, Pinch and Bijker refer to the ''Principle of Symmetry'' as the most influential tenet of the Sociology of Science, which should be applied in historical and sociological investigations of technology as well. It is strongly connected to Bloor's theory of social causation.

===Symmetry===

The ''Principle of Symmetry'' holds that in explaining the origins of scientific beliefs, that is, assessing the success and failure of models, theories, or experiments, the historian/sociologist should deploy the same ''kind'' of explanation in the cases of success as in cases of failure. When investigating beliefs, researchers should be impartial to the (''[[A priori and a posteriori|a posteriori]]'' attributed) truth or falsehood of those beliefs, and the explanations should be unbiased. The strong programme adopts a position of relativism or neutralism regarding the arguments that social actors put forward for the acceptance/rejection of any technology.  All arguments (social, cultural, political, economic, as well as technical) are to be treated equally.&lt;ref&gt;Palacios, EM García, et al. "Introdução aos estudos CTS (Ciência, Tecnologia e Sociedade)." Cadernos de Ibero America (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

The symmetry principle addresses the problem that the historian is tempted to explain the success of successful theories by referring to their "objective truth", or inherent "technical superiority", whereas s/he is more likely to put forward sociological explanations (citing political influence or economic reasons) only in the case of failures. For example, having experienced the obvious success of the chain-driven bicycle for decades, it is tempting to attribute its success to its "advanced technology" compared to the "primitiveness" of the [[Penny farthing|Penny Farthing]], but if we look closely and symmetrically at their history (as Pinch and Bijker do), we can see that at the beginning bicycles were valued according to quite different standards than nowadays. The early adopters (predominantly young, well-to-do gentlemen) valued the speed, the thrill, and the spectacularity of the Penny Farthing – in contrast to the security and stability of the chain-driven [[History of the bicycle|Safety Bicycle]]. Many other social factors (e.g., the contemporary state of urbanism and transport, women's clothing habits and feminism) have influenced and changed the relative valuations of bicycle models.

A weak reading of the ''Principle of Symmetry'' points out that there often are many competing theories or technologies, which all have the potential to provide slightly different solutions to similar problems. In these cases, sociological factors tip the balance between them: that's why we should pay equal attention to them.

A strong, social constructivist reading would add that even the emergence of the questions or problems to be solved are governed by social determinations, so the Principle of Symmetry is applicable even to the apparently purely technical issues.

== Core concepts ==

The following concepts and 'stages' of SCOT are adapted from the Empirical Programme of Relativism (EPOR).&lt;ref&gt;Pinch, Trevor J. and Wiebe E. Bijker.  "The Social Construction of Facts and Artefacts: Or How the Sociology of Science and the Sociology of Technology Might Benefit Each Other."  ''Social Studies of Science'' 14 (August 1984): 399-441.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretative flexibility===
''Interpretative flexibility'' means that each technological artifact has different meanings and interpretations for various groups. Bijker and Pinch show that the air tire of the bicycle meant a more convenient mode of transportation for some people, whereas it meant technical nuisances, traction problems and ugly [[aesthetics]] to others. In racing air tires lent to greater speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/students/envs_5110/bijker2.pdf | title=The Social Constructions of Technological Systems | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | editor1=Wiebe E. Bijker | editor2= Thomas P. Hughes |editor3=Trevor Pinch |year=1987|isbn=0-262-02262-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These alternative interpretations generate different ''problems'' to be solved. How should aesthetics, convenience, and speed be prioritized? What is the "best" tradeoff between traction and speed?

====Relevant social groups====
The most basic relevant groups are the ''users'' and the ''producers'' of the technological artifact, but most often many subgroups can be delineated – users with different socioeconomic status, competing producers, etc. Sometimes there are relevant groups who are neither users, nor producers of the technology, for example, journalists, politicians, and civil organizations. [[Trevor Pinch]] has argued that the salespeople of technology should also be included in the study of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinch|first=Trevor|title=How Users Matter: The Co-Construction of Users and Technology|year=2003|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-15107-3|pages=247–269|authorlink=Trevor Pinch|editor=Nelly Oudshoorn and Trevor Pinch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The groups can be distinguished based on their shared or diverging interpretations of the technology in question.

====Design flexibility====
Just as technologies have different meanings in different social groups, there are always multiple ways of constructing technologies. A particular design is only a single point in the large field of technical possibilities, reflecting the interpretations of certain relevant groups.

====Problems and conflicts====
The different interpretations often give rise to conflicts between criteria that are hard to resolve technologically (e.g., in the case of the bicycle, one such problem was how a woman could ride the bicycle in a skirt while still adhering to standards of decency), or conflicts between the relevant groups (the "Anti-cyclists" lobbied for the banning of the bicycles). Different groups in different societies construct different problems, leading to different designs.

The first stage of the SCOT research methodology is to reconstruct the alternative interpretations of the technology, analyze the problems and conflicts these interpretations give rise to, and connect them to the design features of the technological artifacts. The relations between groups, problems, and designs can be visualized in diagrams.

===Closure&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Closure]] --&gt;===
Over time, as technologies are developed, the interpretative and design flexibility collapse through closure mechanisms. Two examples of closure mechanisms:

#'''Rhetorical closure''': When social groups ''see'' the problem as being solved, the need for alternative designs diminishes. This is often the result of advertising.
#'''Redefinition of the problem''': A design standing in the focus of conflicts can be stabilized by using it to solve a different, new problem, which ends up being solved by this very design. As an example, the aesthetic and technical problems of the air tire diminished, as the technology advanced to the stage where air tire bikes started to win the bike races. Tires were still considered cumbersome and ugly, but they provided a solution to the "speed problem", and this overrode previous concerns.

Closure is not permanent.  New social groups may form and reintroduce interpretative flexibility, causing a new round of debate or conflict about a technology. (For instance, in the 1890s automobiles were seen as the "green" alternative, a cleaner environmentally-friendly technology, to horse-powered vehicles; by the 1960s, new social groups had introduced new interpretations about the environmental effects of the automobile, eliciting the opposite conclusion.)

The second stage of the SCOT methodology is to show how closure is achieved.

===Relating the content of the technological artifact to the wider sociopolitical milieu===
This is the third stage of the SCOT methodology, but the seminal article of Pinch and Bijker does not proceed to this stage. Many other historians and sociologists of technology nevertheless do. For example, Paul N. Edwards shows in his book "The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America | publisher=The MIT Press | author=Paul N. Edwards | year=1997 | isbn=978-0262550284 | series=Inside Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; the strong relations between the political discourse of the Cold War and the computer designs of this era.

==Criticism==
In 1993, [[Langdon Winner]] published an influential critique of SCOT entitled "Upon Opening the Black Box and Finding it Empty: Social Constructivism and the Philosophy of Technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winner|first=Langdon|title=Upon Opening the Black Box and Finding it Empty: Social Constructivism and the Philosophy of Technology|journal=Science, Technology, and Human Values|date=Summer 1993|volume=18|issue=3|pages=362–378|url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/papers/openingblackbox.pdf|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In it, he argues that social constructivism is an overly narrow research program. He identifies the following specific limitations in social constructivism:
# It explains how technologies arise, but ignores the consequences of the technologies after the fact. This results in a sociology that says nothing about how such technologies matter in the broader context.
# It examines social groups and interests that contribute to the construction of technology, but ignores those who have no voice in the process, yet are affected by it. Likewise, when documenting technological contingencies and choices, it fails to account for those options that never made it to the table. According to Winner, this results in conservative and elitist sociology.
# It is superficial in that it focuses on how the immediate needs, interests, problems and solutions of chosen social groups influence technological choice, but disregards any possible deeper cultural, intellectual or economic origins of social choices concerning technology.
# It actively avoids taking any kind of moral stance or passing judgment on the relative merits of the alternative interpretations of a technology. This indifference makes it unhelpful in addressing important debates about the place of technology in human affairs.
Other critics include [[Stewart Russell]] with his letter in the journal "[[Social Studies of Science]]" titled "The Social Construction of Artifacts: A Response to Pinch and Bijker".

A '''spokesman''', '''spokeswoman''' or '''spokesperson'''  is someone engaged or elected to speak on behalf of others.

==Duties and function==
In the present media-sensitive world, many organizations are increasingly likely to employ  professionals who have received formal training in [[journalism]], [[Communication studies|communications]], [[public relations]] and [[Public administration|public affairs]] in this role in order to ensure that public announcements are made in the most appropriate fashion and through the most appropriate channels to maximize the impact of favorable messages, and to minimize the impact of unfavorable messages. Celebrity spokesmen such as popular local and national sports stars (such as [[Michael Jordan]] or [[Bob Uecker]]) or television and film stars (such as [[Beyoncé]] or [[Michael J. Fox]]) are often chosen as spokespeople for commercial advertising. As of August 2017, [[Kayleigh McEnany]] and Michael Tyler (DNC spokesman) served as spokesmen of the RNC and DNC, respectively.

==Responsibilities==
Unlike an individual giving a personal [[testimonial]], it is the job of a spokesperson to faithfully represent and advocate for the organization's positions, even when these conflict with his/her own opinion. As a result, spokespeople are generally selected from experienced, long-time employees or other people who are known to support the organization's goals.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7914-3762-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Goodman, Michael B. |title=Corporate communications for executives |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, N.Y |year=1998 |pages=13 |isbn=0-7914-3762-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity==
A corporation may be represented in public by its [[chief executive officer]], [[chairman]] or [[president (corporate title)|president]], [[chief financial officer]], [[counsel]] or external legal advisor. In addition, on a day-to-day level and for more routine announcements, the job may be delegated to the corporate communications or [[investor relations]] departments (or equivalents), who will act as spokespeople.

In the particle physics community, large collaborations of physicists elect one (or two) spokespeople or leader(s) of the collaboration.  The spokesperson in such cases is the lead scientist of the collaboration, not a public speaker.&lt;ref name="CMS Management"&gt;{{cite web|title=CMS Management on cms.web.cern.ch|url=http://cms.web.cern.ch/content/cms-management|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each collaboration chooses the roles and responsibilities of the spokesperson for internal purposes, but typically spokespeople also have defined roles for liaising with the host laboratory and/or funding agencies.

A '''stabilization policy''' is a package or set of measures introduced to stabilize a [[financial system]] or [[Economics|economy]].
The term can refer to policies in two distinct sets of circumstances: [[business cycle]] stabilization and [[economic crisis]] stabilization. In either case, it is a form of [[discretionary policy]].

==Business cycle stabilization==
“Stabilization” can refer to correcting the normal behavior of the [[business cycle]], thus enhancing [[economic stability]]. In this case the term generally refers to [[demand management]] by [[monetary policy|monetary]] and [[fiscal policy]] to reduce normal fluctuations and output, sometimes referred to as "keeping the economy on an even keel."

The policy changes in these circumstances are usually [[countercyclical]], compensating for the predicted changes in employment and output, to increase short-run and medium run welfare.

==Crisis stabilization==
The term can also refer to measures taken to resolve a specific economic crisis, for instance, an [[Currency crisis|exchange-rate crisis]] or [[stock market crash]], in order to prevent the economy developing [[recession]] or [[inflation]].

The package is usually initiated either by a government or central bank, or by either or both of these institutions acting in concert with international institutions such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) or the [[World Bank]].  Depending on the goals to be achieved, it involves some combination of restrictive fiscal measures (to reduce government borrowing) and monetary tightening (to support the currency).

Recent examples of such packages include [[Argentina]]'s re-scheduling of its international obligations (where central banks and leading international banks re-scheduled Argentina's debt so as to allow it to avoid total default), and IMF interventions in [[South East Asia]] (at the end of the 1990s) when several Asian economies encountered financial turbulence. See examples:

*[[Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)#The recovery|Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002): The recovery]]
*[[Timeline of Brazilian economic stabilization plans]]
*[[Economic Stabilization Plan (Israel 1985)]]
*[[Economy of South Korea#1990s and the Asian Financial Crisis|Economy of South Korea: 1990s and the Asian Financial Crisis]]
*[[Economy of Malaysia#Asian financial crisis and recovery|Economy of Malaysia: Asian financial crisis and recovery]]
*[[United States]]
**[[Troubled Asset Relief Program]]
**[[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]]
**[[Office of Economic Stabilization]]
**[[Economic Stabilization Act of 1970]]

This type of stabilization can be painful, in the short term, for the economy concerned because of lower output and higher unemployment. Unlike a business-cycle stabilization policy, these changes will often be [[pro-cyclical]], reinforcing existing trends. While this is clearly undesirable, the policies are designed to be a platform for successful long-run growth and reform.

It has been argued that, rather than imposing such policies after a crisis, the international financial system architecture needs to be reformed to avoid some of the risks (e.g., [[hot money]] flows and/or [[hedge fund]] activity) that some people hold to destabilize economies and financial markets, and lead to the need for stabilization policies and, e.g., IMF interventions. Proposed measures include for example a global [[Tobin tax]] on currency trades across borders.

'''Stormfront''' is a [[white nationalist]],&lt;ref name="Whitenationalist"/&gt; [[White supremacy|white supremacist]],&lt;ref name="Supremacist"/&gt; [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]], [[Holocaust denial]],&lt;ref&gt;Roberts Jeff John (December 20, 2016) [http://fortune.com/2016/12/20/google-algorithm-update/ "Google Demotes Holocaust Denial and Hate Sites in Update to Algorithm"] ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cadwalladr, Carole (December 17, 2016) [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/17/holocaust-deniers-google-search-top-spot "How to bump Holocaust deniers off Google’s top spot? Pay Google"] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darnell, Scott (Spring 2010) [https:\\sites.hks.harvard.edu\ocpa\pdf\HolocaustDenialPAE.pdf "Policy Analysis Exercise: Measuring Holocaust Denial in the United States"] ''[[Harvard University]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]]&lt;ref name="Neonazi"/&gt; [[Internet forum]], and the [[World Wide Web|Web]]'s first major racial [[hate site]].&lt;ref name="Hate site"/&gt; In addition to its promotion of [[Holocaust denial]], Stormfront has increasingly become active in the propagation of [[xenophobia]].

&lt;!-- Summary of the History section, starting with Early history--&gt;
Stormfront began as an online [[bulletin board system]] in the early 1990s before being established as a [[website]] in 1996 by former [[Ku Klux Klan]] leader and [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] [[Don Black (white supremacist)|Don Black]].&lt;!-- National attention --&gt; It received national attention in the United States in 2000 after being featured as the subject of a documentary, ''Hate.com''.&lt;!-- Controversies --&gt; Stormfront has been the subject of controversy after being removed from [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], and [[Italian language|Italian]] [[Google]] indexes, for targeting an online [[Fox News]] poll on [[racial segregation]], and for having political candidates as members.&lt;!-- Popularity and later history --&gt; Its prominence has grown since the 1990s, attracting attention from [[Watchdog journalism|watchdog organizations]] that oppose [[racism]] and [[antisemitism]]. 

In August 2017, Stormfront was taken offline for just over a month when its [[Domain name registrar|registrar]] seized its domain name due to complaints that it promoted [[hatred]] and that some of its members were linked to [[murder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World's oldest neo-Nazi website Stormfront shut down|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/08/29/worlds-oldest-neo-nazi-website-stormfront-shut/|date=August 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stormfront: 'murder capital of internet' pulled offline after civil rights action|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/29/stormfront-neo-nazi-hate-site-murder-internet-pulled-offline-web-com-civil-rights-action|date=August 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early history===
Stormfront began in 1990 as an online bulletin board for white nationalist [[David Duke]]'s campaign for [[United States Senator]] for [[Louisiana]]. The name "Stormfront" was chosen for its connotations of a political or military [[Front (military)|front]] (such as the German Nazi [[stormtrooper]]s, the [[Sturmabteilung]] or SA) and an analogy with [[weather front]]s that invokes the idea of a tumultuous storm ending in cleansing.&lt;ref name="swain"/&gt; The Stormfront.org website was founded in 1996 by [[Don Black (white supremacist)|Don Black]], a former [[Grand Wizard]] of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1970s and a member of the [[American Nazi Party|National Socialist White People's Party]].&lt;ref name="racistnextdoor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/1998-02-19/news/the-racist-next-door|title=The Racist Next Door|last=Schwab Abel|first=David|date=February 19, 1998|work=New Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="showtime"&gt;{{cite book|title=It's Show Time!|last=Schultz|first=David|publisher=P. Lang|year=2000|isbn=0-8204-4135-X|location=Frankfurt Am Main|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black first received computer training while he was imprisoned for his role in an abortive 1981 attempt to overthrow the government of [[Dominica]].&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9908/12/hate.online|title=Web Trackers Hunt Racist Groups Online|last=Lloyd|first=Robin|date=August 8, 1999|work=CNN|accessdate=September 14, 2007|publisher=Turner Broadcasting System}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USATODAY"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/2001-07-16-kid-hate-sites.htm#more|title=Father and Son Team on Hate Site|last=McKelvey|first=Tara|date=August 16, 2001|work=USA Today|accessdate=January 29, 2008|publisher=Gannett Company|authorlink=Tara McKelvey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Stormfront became the first website associated with white supremacy, its founding as a private cyberspace medium for white supremacy was based on the earlier online [[bulletin board system]] [[Liberty Net]].&lt;ref name="swain3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Liberty Net was implemented in 1984 by Klan [[Grand dragon|Grand Dragon]] [[Louis Beam]] and protected by four password protected computers that took the FBI two years to decrypt.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Liberty Net's code-accessed message board contained personal ads along with recruitment material and information about the white power movement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Liberty Net's success as a computer platform led to Stormfront's establishment and later conversion into a website.

Until this point, attempts at using the [[Internet]] as opposed to bulletin boards for the white pride movement were met with limited success,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Jeffrey|title=The Emergence of a Euro-American Radical Right|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick|year=1998|isbn=0-8135-2564-0|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Stormfront quickly became popular with the growth of the Internet during the 1990s.&lt;ref name="swain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hate.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=Julie|last=Etchingham|authorlink=Julie Etchingham|title=Hate.com expands on the net|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/600876.stm|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=January 12, 2000|accessdate=September 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1999, nearly 2,000 websites associated with white supremacy existed, with the recruitment power of reaching millions across the U.S.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===National attention===
The site has received considerable attention in the [[United States]], in reports such as ''Hate.com'', a 2000 [[CBS]]/[[HBO]] documentary television special which focused on the perceived threat of white nationalist and white supremacist organizations on the Internet.&lt;ref name="swain2"/&gt; Narrated by [[Morris Dees]] of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC), it featured interviews with Black and his son Derek as well as interviews with other white nationalist groups and organizations.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Controversies===
In 2002, Google complied with French and German legislation forbidding links to websites which host white supremacist, [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust-denying]] or [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionist]] material by removing Stormfront.org from their French and German [[Index (search engine)|indexes]].&lt;ref name="McCullagh"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-963132.html|title=Google excluding controversial sites|last=McCullagh|first=Declan|authorlink=Declan McCullagh|date=October 23, 2002|publisher=CNet News|accessdate=July 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stormfront returned to the news in May 2003, when [[Fox News Channel]] host [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] reported on a racially [[segregated prom]] being held in Georgia and posted a poll on his website asking his viewers if they would send their own children to one. The next night O'Reilly announced that he could not report the results of the poll as it appeared Stormfront had urged its members to vote in the poll, thus skewing the numbers.&lt;ref name="FOX"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,86338,00.html|title=Circling the Wagons in Georgia|last=O'Reilly|first=Bill|date=May 8, 2003|work=Talking Points|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doug Hanks, a candidate for the city council of [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], withdrew his nomination in August 2005 after it was revealed that he had posted on Stormfront. Hanks had posted more than 4,000&amp;nbsp;comments over three years, including one in which he described black people as "rabid beasts".&lt;ref name="hanks1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2005/aug/20050806news010.asp|title=Internet postings end politico's shot|date=August 6, 2005|work=Columbia Daily Tribune|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://clclt.com/charlotte/no-really-hes-a-racialist/Content?oid=2360607|title=No Really, He's A Racialist|date=December 7, 2005|work=Creative Loafing|first=Karen|last=Shugart|accessdate=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanks said his postings were designed to gain the trust of Stormfront users to help him write a novel: "I did what I thought I needed to do to establish myself as a credible white nationalist."&lt;ref name="hanks1"/&gt;

In 2012 Italian police blocked the website and arrested four people for allegedly inciting racial hatred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Four race-crime convictions for neo-Nazi website|url=http://www.gazzettadelsud.it/news/english/41782/Four-race-crime-convictions-for-neo-Nazi-website.html|publisher=Gazzetta del Sud|accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measure was taken after the publication of a blacklist of "prominent Jews and people who support Jews and immigrants" on the Italian section of the website. The list included possible targets of violent attacks, including gypsy camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Italian white supremacists arrested for inciting anti-Semitism|url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2012/11/18/3112211/italian-white-supremacists-arrested-for-inciting-anti-semitism|publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent year, Italian police raided the homes of 35 Stormfront posters, in November 2013. One man who was arrested in [[Mantua, Italy|Mantua]] had two loaded weapons, a hand grenade casing, and a flag with a swastika in his possession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/1.558236 Italian police raid homes of suspected online anti-Semites], haaretz.com, November 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2014 two-year study by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC)'s Intelligence Report, registered Stormfront users have been disproportionately responsible for some of the most lethal hate crimes and mass killings since the site was put up in 1995. In the five years leading up to 2014, Stormfront members murdered nearly 100 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White Homicide Worldwide|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/publications/White-Homicide-Worldwide|website=splcenter.org|publisher=SPL|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More than 100 hate-crime murders linked to single website, report finds|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/18/hate-crime-murders-website-stormfront-report|accessdate=September 17, 2014|work=The Guardian|date=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bever|first1=Lindsey|title=A white supremacist Web site frequented by killers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/04/18/posters-on-one-white-supremacist-site-have-killed-almost-100-people-watchdog-says|accessdate=September 17, 2014|work= Washington Post|date=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Newcomb|first1=Alyssa|title=Stormfront Website Posters Have Murdered Almost 100 People, Watchdog Group Says|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/stormfront-website-posters-murdered-100-people-watchdog-group/story?id=23365815|accessdate=September 17, 2014|work=ABC News|date=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, 77 were massacred by one Stormfront user, [[Anders Behring Breivik]], a Norwegian terrorist who perpetrated the [[2011 Norway attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2006, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) reported a discussion on Stormfront in which white nationalists were encouraged to join the U.S. military to learn the skills necessary for winning a [[race war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/news/item.jsp?aid=66|title=A Few Bad Men|last=Holthouse|first=David|date=July 7, 2006|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/07/washington/07recruit.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin|title=Hate Groups Are Infiltrating the Military, Group Asserts|last=Kifner|first=John|date=July 7, 2006|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 United States presidential candidacy]] of African-American [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Barack Obama]] was a cause of significant concern for some Stormfront members:&lt;ref name="wapo"/&gt; the site received 2,000 new members the day after Obama was [[United States presidential election, 2008|elected as President]], and went offline temporarily due to the increase in visitors.&lt;ref name="yahoo!"&gt;{{cite news|first=Eileen|last=Sullivan|author2=Lara Jakes Jordan|author3=Jerry Harkavy|title=Obama threats more than previous presidents-elect|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081114/ap_on_el_pr/obama_threats_1|work=Yahoo News|publisher=Yahoo!|date=November 13, 2008|accessdate=November 15, 2008|archivedate=November 14, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5cKwkrbTe|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stormfront posters saw Obama as representing a new [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] era in the United States replacing "white rule", feared that he would support [[illegal immigration]] and [[affirmative action]], and that he would help make white people a minority group.&lt;ref name="wapo"/&gt;

During the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 primary campaigns]], ''[[The New York Times]]'' mistakenly reported that Stormfront had donated $500 to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential hopeful [[Ron Paul]]; in fact, it was site owner Don Black who had contributed the money to Paul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/26/pageoneplus/corrections.html|date=December 26, 2007|title=Corrections: For the Record|publisher=The New York Times Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[2009 shooting of Pittsburgh police officers|an April 2009 shooting]], Richard Poplawski, a poster on the site, was charged with ambushing and killing three [[Pittsburgh Police]] officers and attempting to kill nine others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/04/05/Poplawski-frequented-right-wing-Web-sites/UPI-66971238977599|title=Poplawski frequented right-wing Web sites|work=UPI.com|date=April 5, 2009|accessdate=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election season]], site founder Don Black said that the site was experiencing huge spikes in traffic corresponding to controversial statements by [[Donald Trump]], who is popular among white supremacists. In response, Black upgraded the site's servers.&lt;ref name="trump"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schrekinger|first1=Ben|title=White supremacist groups see Trump bump|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/donald-trump-white-supremacists-216620|accessdate=December 12, 2015|publisher=''[[Politico]]''|date=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black's son Derek, who was a long-time participant in the site, has disavowed the beliefs held by his father and family and the Stormfront site, according to an article in ''[[The Washington Post]]''. Through his years in college, Derek Black came to feel that white nationalism is not supportable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A 2001 study of recruitment by extremist groups on the Internet noted that Stormfront at that time came close to offering most of the standard services offered by web portals, including an internal search engine, web hosting, and categorized links, and lacking only an Internet search engine and the provision of free email for its members (though a limited email service was available at the price of $30 a month).&lt;ref name="recruitment"/&gt;

===Ideology===
Stormfront presents itself as being engaged in a struggle for unity, identifying culture, speech and free association as its core concerns,&lt;ref name="cyborg"/&gt; though members of Stormfront are especially passionate about racial purity.&lt;ref name="kelso"/&gt; It promotes a [[Lone wolf (trait)|lone wolf]] mentality, which links it to white nationalist theorist [[Louis Beam]]'s influential work on leaderless resistance and offers a sympathetic assessment of [[Benjamin Nathaniel Smith]], a white supremacist who committed [[suicide]] after a racially motivated killing spree in July 1999.&lt;ref name="recruitment"/&gt; Violet Jones {{Who|date=June 2015}} notes that Stormfront credits its mission to "the founding myth of an America created, built, and ideologically grounded by the descendants of white Europeans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Violet|editor=Rossatto, César |editor2=Allen, Ricky.

'''''Suiting Themselves: How Corporations Drive the Global Agenda''''' is a 2006 book by Professor [[Sharon Beder]].  Beder argues that an international [[multinational corporations|corporate elite]] dictate [[global politics]] for their own benefit. She suggests that they created business associations and ‘[[think tank]]s’ in the 1970s to drive [[public policy]], push a free trade agenda, and promote the worldwide [[privatization]] and deregulation of public services in the 1980s and 1990s, and have worked since the late 1990s to rewrite the rules of the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;Welford, Richard.

'''Tenglish''' ({{lang-te|తెంగ్లిష్}}), a [[portmanteau]] of the words [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[English language|English]], is the combined usage of Telugu and English in one sentence.

==Distribution==
This form of [[code-switching]] is more commonly seen in urban and suburban centers of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]], but is slowly spreading into rural and remote areas via television and word of mouth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Many speakers do not realize that they are incorporating English words into Telugu sentences or Telugu words into English sentences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, instead of saying ''dhanyavadhamulu'' for "thank you", most people say ''chala thanks'' literally translating to "a lot of thanks." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This type of Telugu speaking is slowly growing outside of cities like [[Hyderabad]], [[Vizag]], [[Vijayawada]], [[Khammam]] ,[[Guntur]] and [[Warangal]]. As English becomes more and more prevalent, it can be seen in small towns, villages, and even rural areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It may have a slight influence by the Indian language of Dakhani.

With its growing popularity, Tenglish is being used to publish news online.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Young-Hans/2017-01-16/Tenglish-Telugu-plus-English/273782|title=1|last=|first=|date=|website=Tenglish News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of cable television and its pervasive growth has seen the masses exposed to a wide variety of programming from across the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another factor contributing to the spread of Tenglish is the popularity of [[Cinema of Andhra Pradesh|Tollywood]] films and TV channels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Tenglish also appears in Indian crossword puzzles, such as those in the Telugu paper ''[[Sakshi (newspaper)|Sakshi]]''.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/dec/06/crossword-blog-cryptics-india|title=Crossword blog: cryptics in India|first=Alan|last=Connor|date=6 December 2012|website=the Guardian|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Antennas|safety/regulation}}

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has researched [[electromagnetic field]]s (EMFs) and their alleged  effects on public health, concluding that such exposures within recommended limits  do not produce any known adverse health effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.who.int/peh-emf/en/|title= Electromagnetic fields (EMF)|accessdate=2008-01-22|date= |website= |language= |publisher= [[World Health Organization]]}} “Electromagnetic fields of all frequencies represent one of the most common and fastest growing environmental influences, about which anxiety and speculation are spreading. All populations are now exposed to varying degrees of EMF, and the levels will continue to increase as technology advances.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.who.int/peh-emf/research/en/|title= WHO EMF Research|accessdate=2012-03-27|date= |website= |publisher= [[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to public concern, the WHO established the ''International EMF Project'' in 1996 to assess the scientific evidence of possible health effects of EMF in the frequency range from 0 to 300&amp;nbsp;GHz. They have stated that although extensive research has been conducted into possible health effects of exposure to many parts of the frequency spectrum, all reviews conducted so far have indicated that, as long as exposures are below the limits recommended in the [[International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection|ICNIRP]] (1998) EMF guidelines, which cover the full frequency range from 0–300&amp;nbsp;GHz, such exposures do not produce any known adverse health effect.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Stronger or more frequent exposures to EMF can be unhealthy, and in fact serve as the basis for [[Directed-energy weapon|electromagnetic weapon]]ry.

International guidelines on exposure levels to [[microwave]] frequency EMFs such as ICNIRP limit the power levels of wireless devices and it is uncommon for wireless devices to exceed the guidelines. These guidelines only take into account thermal effects, as nonthermal effects have not been conclusively demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Levitt|first= B. Blake|authorlink= |title= Electromagnetic Fields : a consumer's guide to the issues and how to protect ourselves|publisher = [[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt Brace]]|year= 1995|location= San Diego|pages = 29–38|isbn= 978-0-15-628100-3|oclc= 32199261}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official stance of the British [[Health Protection Agency]] is that “[T]here is no consistent evidence to date that WiFi and WLANs adversely affect the health of the general population”, but also that “...it is a sensible precautionary approach...to keep the situation under ongoing review...”.&lt;ref name="HPAWiFi"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&amp;Page&amp;HPAwebAutoListName/Page/1199451940308|title= WiFi Summary|accessdate=2010-01-09|date= |website= |language= |publisher= [[Health Protection Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)]], an agency of the [[World Health Organization]], classified wireless radiation as [[List of IARC Group 2B carcinogens|Group 2B]]&amp;nbsp;– possibly carcinogenic. That means that there "could be some risk" of carcinogenicity, so additional research into the long-term, heavy use of wireless devices needs to be conducted.&lt;ref name="WHO_IARC_110531"&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf |format= PDF|title= IARC classifies radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans|work= [[World Health Organization]] press release N° 208|publisher= [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]]|date= 2011-05-31|accessdate= 2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exposure difference to mobile phones==
{{Main|Mobile phone radiation and health}}
Users of wireless devices are typically exposed for much longer periods than for [[mobile phone]]s and the strength of wireless devices is not significantly less.  Whereas a [[UMTS|Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)]] mobile phone can range from 21 [[dBm]] (125&amp;nbsp;mW) for Power Class 4 to 33 [[dBm]] (2W) for Power class 1, a [[wireless router]] can range from a typical 15 [[dBm]] (30&amp;nbsp;mW) strength to 27 [[dBm]] (500&amp;nbsp;mW) on the high end.&lt;ref&gt;[[dBm]]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, wireless routers are typically located significantly farther away from users' heads than a mobile phone the user is handling, resulting in far less exposure overall.  The [[Health Protection Agency]] (HPA) says that if a person spends one year in a location with a Wi-Fi hotspot, they will receive the same dose of radio waves as if they had made a 20-minute call on a mobile phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Wi-fi health fears are 'unproven'|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6676129.stm|work= [[BBC News]]|publisher= [[BBC]]|date= 2007-05-21|accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HPA also says that due to the mobile phone's adaptive power ability, a DECT cordless phone's radiation could actually exceed the radiation of a mobile phone.  The HPA explains that while the DECT cordless phone's radiation has an average output power of 10&amp;nbsp;mW, it is actually in the form of 100 bursts per second of 250&amp;nbsp;mW, a strength comparable to some mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/Radiation/UnderstandingRadiation/InformationSheets/info_CordlessTelephones/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wireless LAN==
Most [[wireless LAN]] equipment is designed to work within predefined standards. Wireless access points are also often close to humans, but the drop off in power over distance is fast, following the [[inverse-square law]].&lt;ref name="Foster2007"&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Foster|first= Kenneth R|title= Radiofrequency exposure from wireless LANs utilizing Wi-Fi technology|date=March 2007|journal= Health Physics|volume= 92|issue= 3|pages= 280–289|doi= 10.1097/01.HP.0000248117.74843.34|pmid= 17293700}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, wireless laptops are typically used close to humans.  [[WiFi]] had been anecdotally linked to [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2010/08/15/ontario-wifi.html | work=CBC News | title=Ont. parents suspect Wi-Fi making kids sick | date=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; but research into electromagnetic hypersensitivity has found no systematic evidence supporting claims made by sufferers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity: A Systematic Review of Provocation Studies|url = http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00006842-200503000-00010|journal = Psychosomatic Medicine|pages = 224–232|volume = 67|issue = 2|doi = 10.1097/01.psy.0000155664.13300.64|first = G James|last = Rubin|first2 = Jayati Das|last2 = Munshi|first3 = Simon|last3 = Wessely|pmid=15784787|year=2005|citeseerx = 10.1.1.543.1328}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Radiofrequency electromagnetic field exposure and non-specific symptoms of ill health: A systematic review|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935108000601|journal = Environmental Research|date = 2008-06-01|pages = 277–287|volume = 107|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.envres.2008.02.003|first = Martin|last = Röösli|pmid=18359015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Health Protection Agency|HPA's]] position is that “...radio frequency (RF) exposures from WiFi are likely to be lower than those from [[mobile phone]]s.” It also saw “...no reason why schools and others should not use WiFi equipment.”&lt;ref name="HPAWiFi"/&gt; In October 2007, the HPA launched a new “systematic” study into the effects of WiFi networks on behalf of the UK government, in order to calm fears that had appeared in the media in a recent period up to that time".&lt;ref name="HPAWiFiStudy"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&amp;HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1195733726123?p=1171991026241|title= Health Protection Agency announces further research into use of WiFi|accessdate=2008-08-28|date= |website= |language= |publisher= [[Health Protection Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Michael Clark, of the HPA, says published research on [[mobile phones]] and [[radio masts and towers|masts]] does not add up to an indictment of WiFi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/health/article1789149.ece|title=Wi-fi: should we be worried?|author=Nicki Daniels|newspaper=The Times|date=11 December 2006|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bioinitiative Report|url=http://www.bioinitiative.org/|accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other devices==
[[Radio frequency]] in the microwave and radio spectrum is used in a number of practical devices for professional and home use, such as:
* [[Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications|DECT]] and other [[cordless telephone|cordless phones]] operating at a wide  range of frequencies
* [[Remote control]] devices for opening gates, etc.
* Portable two-way [[radio]] communication devices, such as [[walkie-talkies]], etc.
* Wireless [[security]] (alarm) systems
* Wireless security [[video cameras]]
* Radio links between buildings for [[data communication]]
* [[Baby monitor]]s
* [[Smart meter]]s for electric energy
* [[Bluetooth]] and other personal area network devices - e.g., wireless headphones, smart watches.
* Implantable medical devices - pacemakers, implanted defibrillators

In addition, electrical and electronic devices of all kinds emit EM fields around their working circuits, generated by [[alternating current|oscillating currents]]. Humans are in daily contact with [[computer]]s, [[computer monitor|video display monitors]], [[television]] screens, [[microwave oven]]s, [[fluorescent lamps]], [[electric motors]] of several kinds (such as [[washing machines]], kitchen appliances [like electric can openers, blenders, and mixers], water pumps, etc.) and many others. A study of bedroom exposure in 2009 showed the highest [[extremely low frequency|ELF]]-EF from bedside lights and the highest ELF-MF from transformer devices, while the highest RF-ELF came from DECT cordless phones and outside cellphone base stations; all exposures were well below [[International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection]] (ICNIRP) guideline levels.&lt;ref name="Tomitsch2009"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1= Tomitsch|first1= Johannes|last2= Dechant|first2= Engelbert|last3= Frank|first3= Wilhelm|title= Survey of electromagnetic field exposure in bedrooms of residences in lower Austria|date= 2009-09-24|journal= Bioelectromagnetics|issue= 3|doi= 10.1002/bem.20548 |pmid= 19780092|volume=31|pages=200–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest typical daily exposure, according to a study of 2009, came from cellphone base stations, cellphones and DECT cordless phones, with the highest exposure locations in trains, airports and buses.&lt;ref name="Frei2009"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1= Frei|first1= Patrizia|last2= Mohler|first2= Evelyn|last3= Neubauer|first3= Georg|last4= Theis|first4= Gaston|last5= Bürgi|first5= Alfred|last6= Fröhlich|first6= Jürg|last7= Braun-Fahrländer|first7= Charlotte|last8= Bolte|first8= John|last9= Egger|first9= Matthias|last10= Röösli|first10= Martin|title= Temporal and spatial variability of personal exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic fields|date=August 2009|journal= Environmental Research|volume= 109|issue= 6|pages= 779–785|doi= 10.1016/j.envres.2009.04.015 |pmid= 19476932}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical background power of electromagnetic fields in the home can vary from zero to 5 milliwatts per meter squared.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Long-term effects of these electromagnetic fields on human and animal health are still unknown.

Some implanted medical devices use radio frequency communication - both to report status, and to allow changing device behavior.  Emissions from wireless electronic devices can interfere with the functioning of these devices, thereby adversely affecting the health of the user.  Users of such implanted devices are usually cautioned to avoid close exposure to other wireless devices.

'''''X and Others v. Austria 53 ILM 64''''' was a [[human rights]] case that was decided in 2013 by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR). The case concerned whether the [[Government of Austria]] had discriminated against Austrian citizens who were in same-sex relationships because the wording of the [[Austrian Civil Code]] (German: ''Allgermeines Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch'') did not permit unmarried [[same-sex relationship|same-sex couples]] access to legally granted [[second-parent adoption]]s, whereas it was available to unmarried [[heterosexual]] couples.

''X and Others v. Austria'' is viewed by international legal scholars as being the first recognition of the right of unmarried same-sex couples to second-parent adoption in [[States of the European Union|European States]] that are a party to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR).&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen A.

at 620.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the European Court of Human Rights considered the ruling built on discrimination protections that have been established as part of the body of [[LGBT rights in Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen A. Doty Introductory Note to X and Others v. Austria (EUR. CT. H.R.) International Legal Materials Vol 53. No.4 2014 at 650.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background information==

===LGBT adoption rights in the European Union===
[[LGBT rights]] have been established in a number of different countries in a response to a shift in social attitudes towards the [[LGBT community]]. Some of those rights concern [[LGBT parenting]] which encompasses the legal provisions relevant to the paternal rights that can be granted to individuals who identify with the [[LGBT community]].

Adoption is one of the LGBT parental rights that is recognised to exist in some European states. However, the LGBT community has historically had difficulty in being granted the legal rights to adoption and currently only 19 out of the 56 European States have made adoption legal to members of the LGBT community.&lt;ref&gt;see: [[LGBT rights in the European Union]]&lt;/ref&gt; There was widespread public opposition against the idea of LGBT adoption, arising from concern about the developmental health of children raised in LGBT families.&lt;ref&gt;see above&lt;/ref&gt; A pervasive view existed that the biological child needs a parent of either sex to experience healthy development.&lt;ref&gt;X and Others v. Austria 53 ILM 620 at 65.&lt;/ref&gt; This view was seen to justify restricting adoption to same-sex couples. However, as social attitudes towards the LGBT community have begun to shift, the LGBT community have been incrementally granted legal rights. Scientific research into childhood development has concluded that children growing up in same-sex families are not disadvantaged.

Human rights law is a body of law that covers LGBT individuals and their right to live in society. The human rights regime is governed by the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] within the [[European Union]]. Alleged violations of an individual’s human rights by a contracting State within the European Union can be brought before the [[European Court of Human Rights]].

Adoption by same-sex couples had already come before the Court on a number of occasions. In 1999 the ECtHR ruled that in the context of awarding custody to one parent or another, difference in treatment based solely on considerations of sexual orientation was impermissible by the ECHR. The European Court of Human Rights first considered a lesbian or gay individual’s rights to adoption in ''Frette v France''.&lt;ref&gt;X and Others v. Austria 53 ILM 620 at 620&lt;/ref&gt; In that case the ECtHR found that denying a single homosexual man the right to adopt a child did not violate the ECHR. In ''E.B and France'', the ECtHR distinguished the case from ''Frette'' finding that making a distinction based on sexual orientation was impermissible under the ECHR.&lt;ref&gt;above, at 620&lt;/ref&gt; Finally in ''Gas &amp; Dubois v France'' two women living in a same-sex relationship sought an adoption order to allow one of the partner's children to be adopted by the other partner. When the French Government denied their request, they appealed to the ECtHr. However, the ECtHR found that only couples who were married could obtain this form of adoption and because the couple could not form a marriage they could not enjoy its special legal status.&lt;ref&gt;above, at 620&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision of the European Court of Human Rights==

===Prior history of the case===
X and her partner were living together in a stable [[same-sex relationship]]. X’s partner was previously married and had given birth to a child with her husband. X’s partner now had sole custody of the child. X sought court approval of the second-parent adoption such that the relationship with the biological father and his relatives under family law would cease to exist while the relationship with the biological mother would remain fully intact. However, the child’s father still recognised his paternal legal rights and refused to grant his consent to the adoption. The applicants wanted the court to override the father’s refusal for consent as he displayed the utmost antagonism towards the family. &lt;ref&gt;X and Others v. Austria no. 19010/07, 19 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrian law recognised many different forms of adoption, however it prevented second-parent adoptions made by homosexual couples in accordance with s182(2) of the [[Austrian Civil Code]].&lt;ref&gt;X and Others v. Austria 53 ILM 620 at 649.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 182(2) provided for second-parent adoption if the adopting parents had formed a [[marriage]]. Importantly, it did not prevent unmarried heterosexual couples from doing so. X concluded an adoption agreement and sent in to the Austrian District Court for approval, knowing it would be denied. The domestic court argued that the father refused to give his consent and that the adoption requested by them was in any case not possible under Austrian law. Upon that verdict, X and her partner applied to the [[Constitutional Court of Austria]] to have the s179 declared unconstitutional because it discriminated against them on the basis of their sexual orientation. They argued that in the case of an opposite-sex couple, the District Court would have carried out a detailed examination (as to whether override the father’s refusal or not) and would have had to deliver a separate decision on this issue. However, in the applicants’ case it had denied them any inquiry of the facts on the ground that the adoption requested by them was in any case not possible under Austrian law.&lt;ref&gt;X and Others v. Austria no. 19010/07, 19 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitutional Court of Austria]] refused to do so and rendered the request inadmissible.

===Facts===
X, her partner and her biological child appealed to the European Court of Human Rights and appeared as joint applicants.

After argument and deliberation the [[Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights]] held by a 10-7 majority that the Austrian government violated article 8 and article 14 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] when taken together.&lt;ref&gt;X and Others v. Austria 53 ILM 620 at 654&lt;/ref&gt; The Court distinguished ''Gas and Dubois v. France'' finding there was no legitimate and proportionate aim in restricting second-parent adoption to unmarried heterosexual couples.  X and her partner were found to have been discriminated against as they could not obtain a second-parent adoption but unmarried couples living together in a stable heterosexual relationship could.

===articles. 8 and 14 of the European Convention of Human Rights===
The ECtHR observed that the three applicants lived together in a situation that was alike to that of a heterosexual family unit.

The [[European Convention on Human Rights]] provided the human rights framework which the Court examined in relation to Austrian adoption laws. Articles 8 and 14 are relevant to LGBT adoption. Article 8 provides&lt;ref&gt;http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf at 10.&lt;/ref&gt; that “everyone has a right to respect for his family and private life, his home and his correspondence” and Article 14 prevents discrimination based on any grounds such as “sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf at 11.&lt;/ref&gt; While article 8 is a substantive right conferred by the ECHR, article 14 is considered to be dependent on the other articles as it protects the freedoms that have been granted by the other articles in the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen A. Doty Introductory Note to X and Others v. Austria (EUR. CT. H.R.) International Legal Materials Vol 53. No.4 2014 620 at 620.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court noted that the Austrian government did not have to extend second-parent adoptions to unmarried heterosexual couples and because it did, it was required to justify why it didn't extend it to unmarried same-sex couples also. The Austrian government argued that the [[Austrian Civil Code]] was justified on the basis that it aimed to recreate the biological circumstances of the family unit, and the margin of appreciation should be wide in the case of adoption and that no formal consensus in Europe existed on the issue of second-parent adoptions.&lt;ref&gt;X and Others v. Austria 53 ILM 620 at 640&lt;/ref&gt; The '''''margin of appreciation''''' is a legal concept in the EU jurisdiction that takes a relativist stance to issues of human rights in differing European States. It allows for different standards, when European States have not formed a definite consensus on a particular issue.  However, the ECtHR disagreed, finding that not extending the right to same-sex couples discriminated against those couples on the grounds that it violated their Article 8 right to respect for a private and family life when read in conjunction with Article 14.

===Dissenting opinion===
The seven dissenting judges also gave a combined opinion.&lt;ref&gt;X and Others v. Austria 53 ILM 620 at 656.&lt;/ref&gt; They held the denial of second-parent adoption was not a violation of the ECHR as the Court should not have examined the legislation, but rather the particular circumstances in the case, because it was uncertain whether adoption, in this case, was in the child’s best interests.

==Role in subsequent decisions and policy==
Although the decision appears to be important in extending LGBT rights to adoption, the European Court of Human Rights themselves carefully limited the scope of their ruling.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen A. Doty ''Introductory Note to X and Others v. Austria'' (EUR. CT. H.R.) International Legal Materials Vol 53, No.4 (2014) at 650.&lt;/ref&gt; It chose to frame ‘’X and Others v. Austria’’ narrowly, as a matter of alleged discrimination between unmarried heterosexual and homosexual couples, rather than a ruling on the issue of second-parent adoption.&lt;ref&gt;above, at 650.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, subsequent commentators have questioned that interpretation, in effect in being that same as considering ''X and Others v. Austria'' as being the first time in which the European Court of Human Rights has recognised the right to second-parent adoption by same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen A. Doty ''Introductory Note to X and Others v. Austria'' (EUR. CT. H.R.) International Legal Materials Vol 53, No.4 (2014) at 620.&lt;/ref&gt;
