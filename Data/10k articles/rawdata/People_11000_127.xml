'''1917 Bath Riots''' occurred in January 1917 at the Santa Fe Bridge between [[El Paso, Texas]] and [[Juárez, Mexico]]. The riots lasted from January 28 to January 30 and were sparked by new immigration policies at the [[El Paso–Juárez]] [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] office, requiring Mexicans crossing the border to take de-lousing baths and be vaccinated. Reports of nude photography of women bathers and fear of potential fire from the kerosene baths led Carmelita Torres to refuse to submit to the procedure. Denied a refund of her transport fare, she began yelling at the officials and convinced other riders to join her. After three days, the discontent subsided, but the disinfections of Mexicans at the U.S. border continued for forty years.

==Background==
By 1914, [[Venustiano Carranza]] had been sworn into office as Mexico's head of state ending the main fighting of the [[Mexican Revolution]]. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], tired of the fighting and more concerned with events unfolding in Europe and [[World War I]], withdrew American forces from Mexico. [[Pancho Villa]] refused to give up the fight and continued to execute border skirmishes.{{sfn|Beller|2008|pp=44, 46}} Between 1915 and 1917, [[typhus]] (which was sometimes reported as [[typhoid fever]]) spread from [[Mexico City]] to the provinces from [[Veracruz]] to [[Jalisco]].{{sfn|Knight|1990|p=421, 623}} In September 1916, Carranza called for a constitutional convention to end the conflict and bring peace to Mexico.{{sfn|Beller|2008|p=46}} The convention ended simultaneously with the end of the riots, on January 31, 1917,{{sfn|Beller|2008|p=47}} and subsequently the new constitution was signed on February 5.{{sfn|Beller|2008|p=112}}

During the same period, [[Thomas Calloway Lea, Jr.]] was elected as mayor of [[El Paso, Texas]]. Lea sent telegrams to [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]] in [[Washington, D. C.|Washington]] demanding a [[quarantine]] be put in place to stem the tide of "dirty lousey destitute Mexicans" who would spread typhus into El Paso.{{sfn|Perez, Jr.|2016}} Though the [[Public Health Service]] Officer for El Paso, Dr. B. J. Lloyd, admitted there was little danger and opposed a quarantine, he suggested opening de-lousing plants.{{sfn|Burnett|2006}} U.S. officials quickly adopted a policy of [[Sanitation|sanitizing]] Mexican immigrants at a disinfecting station in El Paso. The policy initially applied to all Mexicans entering the United States at El Paso,{{sfn|Pierce|1917|p=427}} but soon spread to the [[Laredo–Nuevo Laredo]] crossing, as well as all along the U.S. Mexico border.{{sfn|Pierce|1917|p=429}}

Men and women were separated, with any children accompanying the women, into separate buildings, where they were stripped of all clothing and valuables. Clothing and valuables were steamed, while items like shoes, hats or belts, which might be damaged by steam were exposed to [[Cyanogen|cyanogen gas]]. Attendants examined the nude persons for [[lice]]. If lice were found, men's hair was clipped close to the head and the clippings were burned. Women's hair was doused in a mixture of [[vinegar]] and [[kerosene]], wrapped in a towel, and left on the hair for at least 30 minutes. If re-inspection indicated all nits had not been removed, the process was repeated. Once attendants declared the lice test had been "passed", the naked people were gathered in a bathing area and sprayed with a liquid soap made of soap chips and kerosene oil.{{sfn|Pierce|1917|p=427}} After collecting their sanitized clothing and dressing, incomers were evaluated by a foreman, vaccinated and given a certificate that they had completed the procedure. From the disinfecting area, migrants then entered the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] building for processing.{{sfn|Pierce|1917|p=428}}

==Riot==
Around 7:30&amp;nbsp;a.m.{{sfn|''The El Paso Herald''|January 29, 1917|p=1}} on January 28, 1917, the riot began when inspectors attempted to remove Mexican women from their [[Cable car (railway)|trolley]], which they were riding to work. Ordered to disembark and submit to the disinfection process, Carmelita Torres refused, having heard reports that nude women were being photographed while in the baths.{{sfn|''The El Paso Morning Times''|January 29, 1917|p=1}} Reports had also circulated that bathers might be set on fire, as had happened the previous year when gasoline baths at the El Paso City Jail had resulted in the death of 28 inmates when a cigarette ignited bathers.{{sfn|''The Detroit Free Press''|1917|p=2}} She requested permission to enter without submitting to bathing and was refused. She then demanded a refund of her [[fare]] and upon refusal of a refund convinced the other women on her cable car to protest. The women began shouting and hurling stones at health and immigration officials, sentries and civilians, who had gathered to watch the disturbance. The majority of the early protesters were young, [[maid|domestic workers]] employed in homes in El Paso but as the crowd grew to several thousand a mixture of people became involved. Four trolley's which had made early morning runs to collect workers on the Juárez side were seized and did not return to the El Paso side until mid-afternoon.{{sfn|''The El Paso Morning Times''|January 29, 1917|p=1}}

Around 10 o'clock, General Andrés G. García drove to the center of the bridge to try to quiet the mob and was only partially successful, as the mob tried to prevent his car from leaving the Mexican side. By the afternoon, when it was clear that those who had entered the baths were not being harmed, the crowds were finally dispersed by mounted soldiers on each side of the border.{{sfn|''The El Paso Morning Times''|January 29, 1917|p=1}} One cable car [[motorman]] and a [[mail coach]] driver were reported to have been beaten by rioters and several media movie makers were attacked.{{sfn|''The Detroit Free Press''|1917|pp=1, 2}} Despite rumors that someone had been shot, Mexican authorities denied the event and reported that no serious injuries resulted.{{sfn|''The Times Dispatch''|1917|p=1}}

On the 29th rioting continued, but this time, the majority of rioters were men. Newspapers reported that the men were taking advantage of the bath disturbance to protest the Carranza regime and voice support for his rival Pancho Villa. Juárez Police Chief Maximo Torres ordered all rioters arrested and the Mexican cavalry dispersed the rioters from the bridge.{{sfn|''The Elyria Evening Telegram''|1917|p=5}} Business owners and households who were without laborers consulted with the Chamber of Commerce to resolve the issues promptly as most workers refused to come to work. Officials clarified that those who were not infected could be passed without having to bathe and that certificates were valid for a week.{{sfn|''The El Paso Morning Times''|January 30, 1917|pp=1, 2}}
 
By January 30, precautionary measures taken by authorities on both sides of the border had quelled the rioting.{{sfn|''The Reno Evening Gazette''|1917|p=1}} Two men and one woman were arrested at the American side of the bridge for assaulting a customs officer and an infantryman, but no further violence was reported.{{sfn|''The Fort Wayne Sentinel''|1917|p=32}} Policemen from Juárez monitored the southern end of the bridge crossing, a Mexican health inspector Andrés García was present to maintain respectful treatment at the disinfection plant, and street car service between the two cities was suspended.{{sfn|''The Reno Evening Gazette''|1917|p=1}} Notices had been posted in Juárez to advise that the inspectors in El Paso would accept health certificates issued by Mexican health inspectors.{{sfn|''The Iowa City Citizen''|1917|p=2}}

==Legacy==
Though hailed by some as the "Latina [[Rosa Parks]]", Carmelita Torres was mostly forgotten and her actions had little lasting effect.{{sfn|Burnett|2006}} The [[Immigration Act of 1917]] passed just days after the riot and imposed barriers for Mexican laborers entering the United States. For the first time in history, workers were required to pass literacy tests, pay a head tax and were forbidden to perform contract labor.{{sfn|Powell|2009|p=137}} Business owners in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] pressed Congress to exempt Mexican workers from contract labor restrictions and head taxes. After the U.S. entered [[World War I]] businessmen were able to lift the 1917 Immigration terms for Mexican workers and the exemption lasted until 1921.{{sfn|Coerver|Pasztor|Buffington|2004|p=224}} However, the bathing and fumigations, which later used [[insecticides]] and [[DDT]] continued into the 1950s.{{sfn|Burnett|2006}} A similar riot the following year was averted when prompt action by Mexican authorities intervened with American authorities. Reports of a typhus death in Juárez were denied by Mexicans and the port and trolleys were temporarily closed to prevent altercations.{{sfn|''The El Paso Herald''|1918|pp=1, 5}}

In 2006, David Dorado Romo published ''Ringside Seat to a Revolution'' which brought the story back to the attention of the public and Chicano scholars.{{sfn|Burnett|2006}}{{sfn|Acuña|2012}} [[NPR|National Public Radio]] featured a story on the riots in 2006.{{sfn|Burnett|2006}}

'''Abane Ramdane''' (June 10, 1920, [[Larbaâ Nath Irathen]] – December 27, 1957) was an Algerian political activist and revolutionary born in [[Kabylie]]. He played a key role in the organization of the independence struggle during the [[Algerian war]]. His influence was so great that he was known as "the architect of the revolution".  He was also the architect of the [[Soummam conference]] [[Bejaia]]  in 1956 and was very close to [[Frantz Fanon]].

The [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) had him killed, supposedly for creating a cult of the individual rather than the collective leadership. He was "super-political" and his murder was disturbing to many FLN members including President [[Houari Boumediene|Boumédiène]] who, according to the book, ''A Savage War of Peace'', kept the assassins out of his future Algerian government.

A few years after independence, he was reburied in his native village of [[Larbaâ Nath Irathen|Azouza]] in [[Tizi Ouzou Province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3BFWTsJKZ6gC/|title=Algerian White: A Narrative |year=2000|isbn=1-58322-516-1|author=[[Assia Djebar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abdul-Rahman ibn Ibrahima Sori''' ({{lang-ar|عبد الرحمن ابن ابراهيم سوري}}) (1762–1829) was a West African nobleman and  [[Amir]] (commander or governor) who was captured in the [[Fouta Djallon|Fouta Jallon]] region of Guinea, West Africa and sold to slave traders in the United States in 1788.{{sfn|Diouf|1998|p=27–28}} Upon discovering his noble lineage, his slave master Thomas Foster, began referring to him as "Prince",{{sfn|Austin|1997|p=71}} a title by which Abdul Rahman would remain synonymous until his final days. After spending 40 years in slavery, he was freed in 1828 by order of U.S. President [[John Quincy Adams]] and Secretary of State [[Henry Clay]] after the [[Sultan of Morocco]] requested his release.{{sfn|Diouf|1998|p=137}}

==Life==

Abdul-Rahman ibn Ibrahim Sori was a [[Torodbe]] Fulani Muslim ruler (Emir)&lt;ref name=Siiasi&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shareef|first1=Muhammad|title=The Lost and Found Children of Abraham in Africa and the American Diaspora|url=http://siiasi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/The-Lost-and-Found-Children-of-Abraham.pdf|website=siiasi.org|publisher=Sankore Institute of Islamic African Studies International (SIIASI)|accessdate=12 November 2016|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; born in 1762 in the city of [[Timbo]], now located in [[Guinea]].{{sfn|Austin|1997|p=69}} His father, [[Almami]] [[Ibrahim Sori]] consolidated the [[Imamate of Futa Jallon|Islamic confederation of Futa Jallon]] in 1776, with Timbo as its capital, where Abdul Rahman lived and studied. "He was learned in the [[Usul Al-Fiqh|Islamic sciences]] and could speak at least 4 different African languages, in addition to  [[Arabic]] and English, and in 1781, after returning from study in the renowned city of learning-[[Sankore Madrasah|Timbuktu]], Abd'r-Rahman joined the armies of his father."&lt;ref name=Siiasi/&gt; At age 26, he was made an Emir of one of the regiments that conquered the lands of the [[Bambara people|Bambara]] and in 1788 his father "made him the head of a 2000 men army whose mission was to protect the coast and strengthen their economic interest in the region. It was during this military campaign that Abd'r-Rahman was captured and enslaved."&lt;ref name=Siiasi/&gt; He was sold to the British who brought him to [[Natchez, Mississippi]] where he labored on the cotton plantation of Thomas Foster for more than thirty-eight years before gaining his freedom.{{sfn|Austin|1997|p=65|}} In 1794 he married Isabella, another slave of Foster's, and eventually fathered a large family: five sons and four daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/princeamongslaves/|title=Prince Among Slaves|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214095059/http://www.pbs.org/princeamongslaves/ |archive-date=February 14, 2008 |website=[[PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By using his knowledge of growing cotton in Futa Jallon, Abdul-Rahman rose to a position of authority on the plantation and became the ''[[de facto]]'' foreman. This granted him the opportunity to grow his own vegetable garden and sell at the local market. During this time, he met an old acquaintance, Dr. John Cox, an Irish surgeon who had served on an English ship, and had become the first white man to reach Timbo after being abandoned by his ship and then falling ill. Cox stayed ashore for six months and was taken in by Abdul-Rahman's family, where he was tasked to teach Abdul-Rahman English. Cox appealed to Foster to sell his "Prince" so he could return to Africa. However, Foster would not budge, since he viewed Abdul-Rahman as indispensable to the Foster farm. Dr. Cox continued, until his death in 1829, to seek Ibrahim's freedom, to no avail. After Cox died, his son continued the cause to free Abdul-Rahman.

In 1826, Abdul-Rahman wrote a letter to his relatives in Africa. A local newspaperman, [[Andrew Marschalk]], who was Dutch, sent the letter to United States Senator [[Thomas Buck Reed|Thomas Reed]] from [[Mississippi]], who was in town at the time, and Reed forwarded it to the U.S. Consulate in [[Morocco]]. Since Abdul-Rahman wrote in [[Arabic]], Marschalk and the U.S. government assumed that he was a [[Moors|Moor]]. After the [[Sultan of Morocco]] [[Abderrahmane of Morocco|Abderrahmane]] read the letter, he asked President Adams and Secretary of State Henry Clay to release Abdul-Rahman. In 1829, Thomas Foster agreed to the release of Abdul-Rahman, without payment, with the stipulation that he return to Africa and not live as a free man in America.

Before leaving the U.S., Abdul-Rahman and his wife went to various states and Washington, D.C. where he met with President Adams in person. He solicited donations, through the press, personal appearances, the [[American Colonization Society]] and politicians, to free his family back in Mississippi. Word got back to Foster, who considered this a breach of the agreement. Abdul-Rahman's actions and freedom were also used against President John Quincy Adams by future president [[Andrew Jackson]] during the presidential election.

After ten months, Abdul-Rahman and Isabella had raised only half the funds to free their children, and instead left for [[Monrovia, Liberia]], without their children. He lived for four months before contracting a fever and died at the age of 67. He never saw Fouta Djallon or his children again.

==Legacy==
The funds that Abdul-Rahman and Isabella raised only bought the freedom of two sons and their families. They were reunited with Isabella in Monrovia. Thomas Foster died the same year as Abdul-Rahman. Foster's estate, including Abdul-Rahman's other children and grandchildren, was divided among Foster's heirs and scattered across Mississippi and the South. Abdul-Rahman's descendants still reside in Monrovia and in Natchez Mississippi [[United States]]. In 2006, Abdul-Rahman's descendants gathered for a family reunion at Foster's Field.

Abdul-Rahman wrote two autobiographies. A drawing of him is displayed in the [[Library of Congress]].

In 1977, history professor Terry Alford documented the life of Abdul-Rahman in his ground-breaking book ''Prince Among Slaves'', the first full account of his life, pieced together from first-person accounts and historical documents. In ''Prince Among Slaves'', Alford writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Among Henry Clay's documents, for the year 1829 we find the January 1 entry, "Prince Ibrahima, an Islamic prince sold into slavery 15 years ago, and freed with the stipulation that he return (in this case the word "return" makes sense) to Africa, joined the black citizens of [[Philadelphia]] as an honored guest in their New Year's Day parade, up Lombard and Walnut, and down Chestnut and Spruce streets.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2007, Andrea Kalin directed [[Prince Among Slaves (film)|''Prince Among Slaves'']], a film portraying the life of Abdul-Rahman, narrated by American Muslim Yasiin Bey (better known by his stage name [[Mos Def]]).

In 2018, two of Abdul-Rahman's most notable descendants - Dr. Artemus Gaye of Monrovia, Liberia, Karen Brengettsy Chatman of Natchez, Mississippi,were bestowed Royal titles from the House of Sori; the Moor, Prince Abdulrahman Ibrahim Ibn Sori. 

Gaye and Chatman have each used their titles to promote charitable organizations such as the Obama Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to combat humanitarian issues. Chatman, a United States born citizen, founded Global Paths Foundation, an organization that encourages unity amongst children ages fourteen to eighteen by working with school officials and corporate partners to bring awareness of common cultural and racial bonds. She is also the founder of Think Pink Qatar and Think Pink International.

'''Arnold Lynch''' (3 June 1914 – 13 November 2004) was an English engineer, known for his work on an optical tape reader which was used in the construction of the [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], the first electronic computer. By 1944 ten Colossus computers were installed at [[Bletchley Park]] and used to read high-level (''fish'' or ''tunny'') German ciphers.

Lynch joined the [[Post Office Research Station]] in 1936, specialising in the measurement of the electrical and magnetic properties of materials. He retired in 1974, but continued to come to work at [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|NPL]] in the [[dielectric]] area of RF and microwave electromagnetism up to the year of his death.

The Maths and Technology Department at [[Dame Alice Owen's School]] was named after Lynch in thanks for his work during his time at the school and his success as a scientist.

'''Blue Devil''' ('''Dan Cassidy''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[superhero]] featured in material published by [[DC Comics]]. He first appeared in a [[DC Comics insert previews|special insert]] published in ''[[Firestorm (comics)|Fury of Firestorm]]'' #24 (June 1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 208|quote = [A] sixteen-page preview story marked the debut of fledgling stuntman-turned-hero Blue Devil. An attempt to put the fun back into comics, writers Gary Cohn and Dan Mishkin and penciller Paris Cullins had Blue Devil face the machinations of Flash villain the Trickster in this lead-in to his own ongoing series.}}&lt;/ref&gt; That story led directly into ''Blue Devil'' #1, also cover dated June 1984.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Citation | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = | contribution = Blue Devil | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 56 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = London | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was created by [[Dan Mishkin]], [[Gary Cohn (comics)|Gary Cohn]], and [[Paris Cullins]]. The Blue Devil comic book ran for 32 issues with Blue Devil later appearing as a regular character in ''[[Shadowpact]]'' that ran for 25 issues.

Dan Cassidy was working as a [[stuntman]] and [[special effects]] specialist in Hollywood when he created the Blue Devil full body suit, complete with a built in [[exoskeleton]], specifically designed for the Blue Devil movie being produced by Verner Brothers Studios.

During filming on île du Diable, the demon Nebiros was accidentally unleashed from within an ancient temple and, thinking Cassidy was an actual demon, tried to drain his demonic powers with blasts of magic.  Instead, the blasts permanently bonded the suit to Cassidy.  This unnatural fusion of magic and technology caused Cassidy to experience unusual events and draw the attention of otherworldly beings, a condition known in occult circles as a "weirdness magnet".

Horrified at the prospect of being stuck in the suit forever, Cassidy sought ways to separate himself from it, becoming a reluctant super hero along the way.

Cassidy was eventually transformed into an actual demon after making a deal with the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]]. Regretting the deal, Blue Devil decided to fight occult evil, often alongside the other members of Shadowpact.

Cassidy's original trident was a mechanical device that he designed himself but, after being turned into an actual demon, he acquired the magical "Trident of Lucifer" to help combat demons.  Blue Devil appeared in episodes of the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' cartoon as well as a brief appearance in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' show.

==Concept and creation==
[[Gary Cohn (comics)|Gary Cohn]] recounted how he and writing partner [[Dan Mishkin]] created Blue Devil: &lt;blockquote&gt;Our editor for a number of things we were doing was a guy named Dave Manak. At this point, Dan [Mishkin] was living in Michigan and I was in New York. I was the point guy who went to the DC office once a week and schmoozed the editors. One day Manak says, "[[Steve Ditko|Ditko]]’s been hanging around the office and he really wants something to do. Do you think you and Dan can come up for something for him?" I went home and I called Dan and told him about this, and we were both very excited. Ditko was the guy who created [[Spider-Man]] and [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]], and we were gaga for Ditko! ... We decided to do something that takes something from every Marvel character we ever loved. Let’s take [[Iron Man]], the guy in the costume; [[Thing (comics)|the Thing]], the tragedy of the guy stuck in a shape he didn’t want; and a light-hearted, bouncy approach and a character who was going to move like Spider-Man. ... And we wanted something like the [[Green Goblin]]. How about Blue Devil? We called him that because Dan’s wife is from [[North Carolina]] and he was a [[Duke Blue Devils|Blue Devils]] fan. Then we started creating Blue Devil and thinking, "Ditko is going to love this!" We created this great proposal, and it was everything that we knew was going to set Ditko’s light on high beam. We took it in to Manak and he gave it to Ditko. Ditko looked at it and said, "I’ll do it if I have to, but this is really not my kind of stuff at all."&lt;ref name="Back21"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Johnson|first= Dan|date= April 2007|title= The Blue Devil You Don't Know|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 21|pages= 28–32|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Manak liked the proposal and suggested that they show it to artist [[Paris Cullins]]. Cullins was immediately enthusiastic, and Blue Devil was given his own series.&lt;ref name="Back21"/&gt;

Blue Devil's costume and general visual appearance were chiefly designed by Cohn; Cullins came up with the belt design.&lt;ref name="Back21"/&gt;

==Publication history==
Co-writer Gary Cohn recounted that "The first six issues [of Blue Devil], I was living in
[[Brooklyn]] and Paris [Cullins] was living in [[Philadelphia|Philly]]. Paris was kind of a vagabond spirit. He would show up in New York on the train with his sketchbook, his artist satchel, and his toothbrush, and he would come to my place and stay for three or four days. We would spend the whole time creating plots and visuals as we went, laughing hysterically. We were constantly calling Dan [Mishkin]. It was not the stiff process of writing a script, giving it to the artist, or even [[Marvel Method|writing a plot and giving it to an artist]]. It was a very organic collaboration."&lt;ref name="Back21"/&gt; Following issue #6, Cullins left the series, and both Mishkin and Cohn felt that none of the succeeding artists were able to capture the combination of thrills and comedy that they wanted the series to have.&lt;ref name="Back21"/&gt;

The first ''Blue Devil'' series was intentionally written as a humorous and light-hearted comic book story, but this light-hearted style was discarded with later appearances of the character.

==Fictional character biography==
'''Daniel Patrick Cassidy''' is a [[special effect]]s wizard and [[stunt performer|stuntman]] hired to create and play the title character in the movie ''Blue Devil''. To that end Cassidy creates a full-body costume with a hidden powered [[exoskeleton]] and built-in special-effects devices. When two of his co-stars accidentally free a demon named Nebiros, Cassidy uses his costume to drive the demon back, but not before being blasted with mystical energy. After the fight, Cassidy finds that the blast has permanently grafted the Blue Devil costume to his body.&lt;ref&gt;''Blue Devil'' #1 (June 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cassidy quickly finds himself embroiled in repeated adventures and conflicts with [[supervillain]]s, as his newfound status has turned him into a "weirdness magnet". After failing to find a way to remove his costume, Cassidy starts to enjoy his new lifestyle, and becomes more and more comfortable as a superhero, even accepting a place in the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]]. He gains a sidekick when Eddie Bloomberg, his former [[gofer]] and devoted fan, designs a suit similar to his own to adventure as [[Kid Devil]].  Eventually, he moves into "The House of Weirdness" with [[Cain and Abel (comics)|Cain the Caretaker]] as his superintendent.&lt;ref&gt;''Blue Devil'' #20 (January 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blue Demon and later alliances===
Seeking more fame and thrills, [[Underworld Unleashed|Blue Devil is approached]] by the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]]. Neron is known for offering Faustian bargains to heroes and villains alike. Neron offers Cassidy fame as an actor, requiring an act of destruction as payment. Neron sends Cassidy to destroy an unmanned electrical substation in the desert. Believing it to be a relatively harmless act, Blue Devil complies and inadvertently causes the death of Eddie's aunt Marla Bloom, Cassidy's best friend. The story of his personal loss is enough to attract several movie offers.

Opposing Neron, Cassidy is able to partly foil the demon's short-term plans, but he dies in the process. Cassidy's death is short-lived, as he is restored to life as a real devil, no longer a man in an organic suit. Ironically, Cassidy had been a devout [[Catholic]], but now is unable to set foot on consecrated ground without harmfully bursting into flame.

Blue Devil joins the Justice League again, until his second death at the hands of [[Mist (comics)|Mist]], who showers him with [[holy water]].&lt;ref&gt;''Starman'' (vol. 2) #38 (January 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Blue Devil is resurrected again by [[Sebastian Faust]], who hopes to gain his assistance restarting the fires of Hell during the ''[[Day of Judgment (comics)|Day of Judgment]]'' storyline. Blue Devil has a chance to confront Nebiros, empowered by a magic trident seemingly given by the King of Lies himself. Blue Devil stalls Nebiros, stripping him of his trident and allowing [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] to deal the killing blow; back on Earth, the other heroes of the [[Sentinels of Magic]] save the world.

Blue Devil then joins the Sentinels of Magic and becomes Faust's partner, but it is an uneasy partnership. In an apparent act of kindness, Faust restores Blue Devil's freedom by restoring to him his last missing bone. Blue Devil sacrifices his life fighting Hermes Trismegistus, but as a true devil he returns to life again. He is tasked to roam the Earth with Lucifer's Trident sending escaped demons back to Hell.

===One Year Later===
[[One Year Later]] Blue Devil is employed as a bouncer at the [[Oblivion Bar]], an interdimensional place for magical beings, and there he is recruited by [[Ragman (comics)|Ragman]], [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]], and [[Detective Chimp]] to fight against [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|The Spectre]] in ''[[Day of Vengeance]]''. With his enhanced demonic strength, he is the heavy hitter of the [[Shadowpact]], the assemblage of magical heroes devoted to fight for every "lost cause". This grouping is even able to wound the powerful [[Eclipso]]. Feeling necessary for the first time in a long time, he devotes himself to the team. One of their goals is to help look over the wild magic of the "Tenth Age", a direct result of the events of ''Day of Vengeance''.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt;

He spends the "missing year" trapped in Riverrock, Wyoming along with the rest of Shadowpact. It is a small city hidden by a blood shield by an assembly of evil magical beings called the Pentacle. There he meets, or rather meets again, Jack of Fire, a red, muscular demon. The entity is hiding a disfigured, bony face under a black bandanna, claiming to have been turned into a demon by the actions of Daniel. He further explains that the very same moment the demonic [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] granted fame and powers to Cassidy as Blue Devil, the dead parents and siblings of Patrick were dragged from Heaven to Hell.

From then on, Blue Devil's life starts going downhill: even if in his personal timeline only a few days passed, the Enchantress was forced to steal a year of life out of every Shadowpact member (and surviving Riverrock townsperson) to shatter the bloody barrier. As such, the entire world had long thought Shadowpact lost, even building a memorial statue. Having been considered dead for a year, Blue Devil struggles to rebuild his life.

Blue Devil is forced to confront Kid Devil, now granted [[metahuman]] powers by Neron himself. When questioned about his involvement in Marla's death, Blue Devil is forced to admit that his actions were what caused her death. Due to the terms of his deal with Neron, that he would become Neron's eternal servant on his 20th birthday should he lose his trust in Blue Devil, Kid Devil realizes that he is now damned, having lost all trust in Blue Devil following his confession. Kid Devil, enraged, yells at Blue Devil to stay away from him and runs off, leaving a guilt-ridden Blue Devil behind.

To add further misery to his condition, Blue Devil is demoted to the rank of a Rhyming Demon. His new position results in the heroic Earth-based angel [[Zauriel]] being sent to confront him.&lt;ref&gt;''Shadowpact'' #13 (March 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; His demotion is explained as the paradoxical condition of his being both a hero and a demon: being famous and loved by everyone, he makes Hell a glamorous place, spurring weak minds to attain his glamour by selling their souls to Hell. Zauriel, on behalf of his good faith, takes Blue Devil's place in the Shadowpact, giving him enough time to get out of his infernal deal.

Blue Devil puts his case in the hands of an eager lawyer, more than happy to be able to confront Hell itself in a hall of justice. Blue Devil undertakes the task of completing 13 labors, as [[Hercules]] before him, on behalf of the [[Catholic Church]] as a show of good will.

Returning to Hell for the final hearing, he discovers that Jack of Fire was the one selling his sibling's soul first, with Blue Devil merely following unwillingly. His lawyer repeatedly proves that Jack is the only one who can return Cassidy's soul, and the souls of his family, back, since he was the one who sold them in the first place. Blue Devil uses his new lower status as a Rhyming Demon to force Jack to do so, but in the process he loses both Lucifer's Trident and his demon form, reverting into a mortal.&lt;ref&gt;''Shadowpact'' #23 (May 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack of Fire is now allied with a seemingly all-powerful Sun God, but plots to betray him in retaliation for his harsh treatment and to lead an army of demons on Earth. Cassidy feels forced to don a new suit of armor, very similar to the one he wore during his Hollywood years, but even more powerful. He sets off to fight his brother, who refuses. Instead, after a brief confrontation, acknowledging that the Sun God will eventually kill him for his betrayal, he commits suicide in front of Cassidy, naming him inheritor of all his powers and demonic status - but without forfeiting his soul. Cassidy rejoins the Shadowpact to defeat the Sun God, and Zauriel ends his temporary membership with the group.

During the ''[[Reign in Hell]]'' storyline, Cassidy convinces [[Zatanna]] and [[Sargon the Sorcerer]] to take him to Hell and accompany him as to make a deal with Lord Satanus against Neron; when, after much suffering, they reach Satanus, he pleads to be incorporated into Satanus' attack force in hopes of receiving the gift of full humanity from the demon in case of his victory. Inadvertently, he brags about being capable of handling [[Etrigan]], who is causing damage to Satanus' forces; Satanus takes heed of this and teleports him to do battle with Etrigan. Upon losing, Etrigan steals the remains of his humanity.

Later, due to the effects of the magical drug Satanus has released all over Hell, he is transformed into a human, but soulless. [[Etrigan]], now transformed into a replica of [[Jason Blood]], offers him his soul back, warning him the drug only worked on pureblood demons such as the type he had been transformed into when Etrigan stole his soul, meaning accepting it back meant returning to his demon shape forever. He is later traumatized by Sargon's sacrifice to let almost all heroes intervening in the War of Hell escape to [[Nanda Parbat]] and is later the only one convinced of reuniting the Shadowpact by Detective Chimp.

He appears with [[Zatanna]] and the [[Phantom Stranger]] at the desecrated grave of [[Batman]]. [[Power ring (weapon)#Black|Black rings]] take control of [[Crispus Allen]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Blackest Night]]'' #2 (October 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; While Zatanna is sent to gather the Justice League, Blue Devil and the Stranger attempt to stop the [[Black Lantern]] Spectre, failing miserably. He and the Stranger head to Nanda Parbat, where the Stranger helps [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]] remove the black ring from his body. Blue Devil is then tasked by the Stranger to protect the body, being told that it is of "singular importance."&lt;ref&gt;''Phantom Stranger'' (vol. 2) #42 (March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The New 52===
{{Update|date=September 2017}}
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Blue Devil is reintroduced when he busts up a drug deal and runs into [[Black Lightning]], who is also there to bust the deal. They both state that they are trying to take down crime lord [[Tobias Whale]], but Black Lightning does not believe Blue Devil. A fight ensues, but Blue Devil quickly gets the better of Black Lightning and tries to make him listen, when he is interrupted by the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]], who are ready to open fire. Black Lightning takes that opportunity to run off and Blue Devil manages to escape as well.&lt;ref&gt;''DC Universe Presents'' #13&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline (namely ''[[Forever Evil: Blight]]''), Blue Devil is among the magic users that were captured by Felix Faust and Nick Necro in order to use them as part of a weapon that would defeat the creature that destroyed the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]]'s Earth.&lt;ref&gt;''Constantine'' #11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Even before he became Blue Devil, Dan Cassidy was a highly trained martial artist and acrobat. His costume included [[Kevlar]] body armor, visual and auditory amplifiers, radio gear, mini-gills allowing underwater breathing, and servo-motors which increased his strength at least twentyfold. After being grafted to Cassidy's body the costume became organic and gained the ability to self-repair at an extremely fast rate (effectively a healing factor). Cassidy's abilities seem to have been changed little by his transformation into an actual demon.

In his current incarnation, Blue Devil still possesses some degree of superhuman strength, capable of going toe-to-toe with beings like [[Eclipso]], and knocking out a power-drunk [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]] in one punch. He is also remarkably resistant to physical damage, evidenced when Eclipso threw him a distance of approximately 500 feet upwards, he did not even require time to recover before getting up and heading back into the fight.

Originally, Blue Devil wielded a [[trident]] of his own design which included, among other things, [[rocket]] engines capable of carrying two people at high speeds. He now carries the '''Trident of Lucifer''', which allows him to find demons on Earth and banish them to Hell. During a battle with Eclipso and the Spectre the trident was thrown into the ocean; it was recovered shortly after by [[Aquaman]] who returned it to Cassidy, and much later given to Jack of Fire.

Briefly resuming his human body with a more powerful exosuit, Cassidy is given back his trident and demonic powers by Jack of Fire, but as a "demon with a soul".

==Other versions==

===Kingdom Come===
In ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', there is a background character named '''Blue Devil II''', an indigo-skinned demon with wings who was visually based on Chernabog, the demon from the Disney film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.

===Tangent Comics===
In the 1997 [[Tangent Comics]] one-shot ''[[Sea Devils (comics)|Sea Devils]]'' Blue Devil lends his name to the brand of beer served at The [[Black Pirate]] pub in [[New Atlantis]]. There is also a patron of the pub seen wearing a Blue Devil T-shirt.

'''Qābīl''' and '''Hābīl''' ({{lang-ar|قـابـيـل وَهـابـيـل}}, [[Cain and Abel]]) are believed by [[Muslims]] to have been the first two sons of [[Adam in Islam|Adam]] ({{lang-ar|آدم}}) and [[Eve|Hawwa’]] ({{lang-ar|حـواء}}, Eve) mentioned in the [[Quran|Qur’an]]. 

The events of the story in the Qur’an&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|27|s=ns}}: "Recite to them the truth of the story of the two sons of Adam. Behold! they each presented a sacrifice (to [[God in Islam|Allah]]. It was accepted from one, but not from the other. Said the latter: 'Be sure I will slay thee.' 'Surely' said the former, 'He ([[God in Islam|God]]) doth accept of the sacrifice of those who are righteous.'&lt;/ref&gt; are virtually the same as the [[Hebrew Bible]] narrative: Both the brothers were asked to offer up individual sacrifices to [[God in Islam|God]]; God accepted Abel's sacrifice and rejected Cain's; out of jealousy, Cain slew Abel - the first ever case of murder committed upon the Earth.  

In the Islamic version, Abel was chronicled in history as one of the first believers and as the first ever [[martyr]]. Although [[Islam]] does not traditionally view Abel as a ''[[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Nabi]]'' ({{lang-ar|نَـبِي}}, [[Prophet]]), some scholars speak of him as a prophet like his father.&lt;ref&gt;''Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation, Commentary'', Yusuf Ali, note. 57: "The slaying of the prophets begins with the murder of Abel, who was in the ancestry of Israel."&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Qur’an==
{{Main|Al-Ma'ida}}
Of Adam's first children, Cain was the elder son and Abel the younger. Each of them presented a sacrifice to God but it was accepted only from Abel, because of the latter's righteous attitude and his faith and firm belief in God. After the offering of their sacrifices, Cain, the wicked sibling, taunted Abel out of envy and told him that he would surely slay him. Abel justly warned Cain that God only accepted the sacrifice of those that are righteous in their doings. He further went on to tell Cain that if Cain did indeed try to slay him,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|28|s=ns}}: "'If thou dost stretch thy hand against me, to slay me, it is not for me to stretch my hand against thee to slay thee': for I do fear God, the cherisher of the worlds.'"&lt;/ref&gt; Abel would not retaliate and slay him because the God-fearing would never murder for the sake of envy. Abel then told Cain that in murdering him, he would carry the weight not only of his sin but also of the sins of his victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|29|s=ns}}: "'For me, I intend to let thee draw on thyself my sin as well as thine, for thou wilt be among the companions of the fire, and that is the reward of those who do wrong.'"&lt;/ref&gt; The victim, as a result, in suffering the injustice, would be forgiven his own sins and the murderer, while being warned, would consequently increase his own sin. Abel preached powerfully and reminded Cain that the punishment for murder would be that he would spend the afterlife in the fires of [[Hell]].

The innocent pleading and preaching of Abel had no effect upon Cain, for he was full of arrogance, pride and jealousy. He subsequently slew&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|30|s=ns}}: "The (selfish) soul of the other led him to the murder of his brother: he murdered him, and became (himself) one of the lost ones."&lt;/ref&gt; the righteous Abel, but in doing so, he ruined himself and became of those who remain lost. This would be the earliest example of the murder of a righteous man taking place upon the earth. In the future, many other evildoers would slay the wise and pious believers.

After the murder, Allah sent a crow searching in the ground to show Cain how to hide the disgrace of his brother. Cain, in his shame, began to curse himself&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|31|s=ns}}: "Then Allah sent a crow searching in the ground to show him how to hide the disgrace of his brother. 'O Woe to me!' said he. 'Have I failed to be like this crow and hide the body of my brother?' Then he became full of regrets."&lt;/ref&gt; and he became full of guilt. The thought of the crime at last came to the murderer, as he realized indeed how dreadful it was to slay anyone, the more so as the victim was an innocent and righteous man. Full of regrets, Cain was marked with deep sorrow. The Qur'an states, "And he became of the regretful." 5:31 (Chapter 5, verse 31)

==Message==
{{See also|Islam and violence}}

The Qur’an states that the story of Cain and Abel was a message&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|32|s=ns}}: "On that account: We ordained for the Children of Israel that if any one slew a person - unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land - it would be as if he slew the whole people: and if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people. Then although there came to them Our apostles with clear signs, yet, even after that, many of them continued to commit excesses in the land."&lt;/ref&gt; for mankind, as it had told them about the consequences of murder and that the killing of a soul would be as if he/she had slain the whole of mankind. But the Qur’an states that still people rejected the message of the story, and continued to commit grave sins, such as slaying prophets and other righteous people. All the prophets who preached since the time of Adam were persecuted, insulted or reviled in one way or another. With some righteous men, however, the Qur’an states that people went one step further, in attempting to slay them or indeed slaying them. As for the slaying of the righteous, it says "As to those who deny the Signs of God and in defiance of right, slay the prophets, and slay those who teach just dealing with mankind, announce to them a grievous penalty".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|21|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chris Robinson''' is an animation, film, literature and sports writer, Contributing Editor at AWN.com and Artistic Director of the [[Ottawa International Animation Festival]] (OIAF).&lt;ref name=Amid&gt;{{cite news|last=Amid|title=Chris Robinson Talks about the Ottawa Animation Festival|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/interviews/chris-robinson-talks-about-the-ottawa-animation-festival.html|accessdate=13 February 2012|newspaper=[[Cartoon Brew]]|date=11 October 2010|format=Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote the screenplay for the [[Jutra Award]] and [[Genie Award]]-winning [[animated documentary]] ''[[Lipsett Diaries]]'', directed by [[Theodore Ushev]].

==OIAF==
Robinson began his association with the OIAF in the early 1990s, while still a film student at [[Carleton University]], coordinating festival submissions and selection committees.&lt;ref name=Milligan&gt;{{cite news|last=Milligan|first=Mercedes|title=Meet Mr. Robinson|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/people/meet-mr-robinson/|accessdate=13 February 2012|newspaper=[[Animation Magazine]]|date=6 February 2012|format=Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Essays and columns==
From 2000-2016, Robinson wrote the "Animation Pimp" column for [[Animation World Network|Animation World Magazine]]. Partially influenced by [[gonzo journalism]] and [[Beat Generation]] writers, Pimp columns often fused philosophy, history, comedy and memoir in discussing various facets of animation. A selection of columns were later compiled into a book illustrated by German artist and animator, Andreas Hykade. In 2016, Robinson renamed the column, Cheer and Loathing in Animation.

In 2014, Animation World Magazine debuted Robinson's Animation Pimpcast. In this monthly podcast, Robinson sits down with a variety of animation types to fondle their minds through informal chats about animation, life and whatever else they feel like discussing.

Robinson is also a frequent contributor to, Sight and Sound Magazine.

Robinson has also written on music, film, literature and sports for various international publications including [[Salon.com]], ''[[Stop Smiling (magazine)|Stop Smiling]],'' Ottawa Magazine, and the ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' His monthly literature column, "The Lit Pimp" appeared in the ''[[Ottawa Xpress]]'' from 2006-2010.

Since 2001, Robinson has been the editor-in-chief of the ASIFA (International Animator's Association) Magazine.

==Books==
Robinson's book ''Stole This From a Hockey Card: A Philosophy of Hockey, [[Doug Harvey (ice hockey)|Doug Harvey]], Identity &amp; Booze'' (2005), which was a critical success and was shortlisted for the [[Ottawa Book Award]]. In 2013, TV hockey personality Ron Maclean listed Stole This From a Hockey Card has one of his choices of books that could change the [http://www.cbc.ca/books/canadareads/2013/10/ron-mcleans-five-novels-that-could-change-our-nation.html nation].

{{quote|Robinson draws parallels between his own troubled past and that of epic defenceman Doug Harvey... The result is a biography cum memoir that should find resonance with many Canadians... Robinson reaches a high level of sports biography... creating an exquisite patchwork of sports, personal narrative and manic alcoholism that is tragic in its normalcy.|Janine Armin, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''}}

His other books are: ''Estonian Animation: Between Genius and Utter Illiteracy'' (2003); ''Ottawa Senators'' (2004); ''Unsung Heroes of Animation''; ''Great Left Wingers of Hockey's Golden Era'' (2006); his collection of articles, ''The Animation Pimp'' (2007), introduced by [[Nick Tosches]] with illustrations by [[Andreas Hykade]];&lt;ref name=Sekerka&gt;{{cite news|last=Sekerka|first=John|title=Pimping animation|url=http://www.ottawaxpress.ca/books/books.aspx?iIDArticle=13031|accessdate=4 April 2011|newspaper=[[Ottawa Xpress]]|date=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Canadian Animation: Looking for a Place to Happen'' (2008); ''Ballad of a Thin Man: In Search of [[Ryan Larkin]]'' (2008); and ''Animators Unearthed'' (2010), a collection of essays on some of the world's most famous independent animators.

His seventh book on animation was the 2010 ''[http://www.pelleas.net/aniTOP/index.php/chris-robinson-s-japanese-animation Japanese Animation: Time out of Mind]'', which the ''[[Ottawa Sun]]'' called "a personal, "stream-of-consciousness" journey combing comic book shops and studios looking for past masters and new innovators." ''Japanese Animation: Time out of Mind'' inspired a four-part retrospective about Japanese animators [[Osama Tezuka]], [[Atsushi Wada]], [[Kei Oyama]] and [[Koji Yamamura]] at the [[National Gallery of Canada]] and the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]].&lt;ref name=Armstrong&gt;{{cite news|last=Armstrong|first=Denis|title=A love of Japanese animation|url=http://www.ottawasun.com/entertainment/thescene/2010/10/19/15751816.html|accessdate=4 April 2011|newspaper=[[Ottawa Sun]]|date=19 October 2010}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson is currently working on a magic realist memoir called ''My Balls are Killing Me'' along with a novel called "Drivin'".

==Screenwriting==
Robinson's first attempt at screenwriting was the Jutra and Genie Award-winning animated documentary ''[[Lipsett Diaries]]'' (2010) directed by Theodore Ushev for the [[National Film Board of Canada]]. Robinson and Ushev (along with help from Robinson's son, Jarvis Neall) recently made an iPad film for the National Film Board of Canada called ''Ball Breaker'' (2012). Inspired by Buster Keaton and Robinson's testicular cancer experience, this macabre, slapstick short features Robinson as a stage announcer whose attempts to speak are continually interrupted by an assortment of balls. In the end, the balls overtake Robinson. All that remains is his porkpie hat. ''Ball Breaker'' was made to promote the NFB's pixstop application. The film debuted at the 2012 Ottawa International Animation Festival and is now viewable on YouTube.

==Personal life==
In early 2011, Robinson was diagnosed with testicular cancer. After a year of surgeries and chemo treatments, he has now been in remission since January 2012. He is currently working with German animator and artist, Andreas Hykade on a magic realist [[graphic novel]] about his cancer experience and its aftermath called ''My Balls are Killing Me''.

Robinson is married with three children and splits his time in Montreal and Ottawa.

[[Image:Sir Derek Pattinson.jpg|thumb|right]]
'''Sir William Derek Pattinson''' (31 March 1930 &amp;ndash; 10 October 2006) was Secretary-General of the [[General Synod|General Synod of the Church of England]] from 1972 until 1990.

==Early life==
Pattinson was born at [[Barrow-in-Furness]], the only child of Thomas William Pattinson (1898–1970) a civil servant and Elizabeth Pattinson née Burgess (1895–1986) a primary school teacher. He was educated at the County Grammar School, Whitehaven and at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], where, despite having won the [[Stanhope Historical Essay Prize]], he obtained only Second Class in the [[Final Honour School]] of Modern History. He received the degree of [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1952 and [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|Master of Arts]] in 1956. He had been a member of the [[Church of England]] since his childhood but during his time at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] he moved from the [[Low Church]] to [[Anglo-Catholicism]].&lt;ref name=Indy&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article1879386.ece Michael De-la-Noy, 'The Rev Sir Derek Pattinson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123110436/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article1879386.ece |date=2007-11-23 }}', ''[[The Independent]]'', 17 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative version states that he grew up an Anglo-Catholic, that his religious enthusiasm waned at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and that he returned to the Church when working as a civil servant.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,1923102,00.html Margaret Duggan, 'The Rev Sir Derek Pattinson]', ''[[The Guardian]]'', 16 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Civil Service===
He entered [[British Civil Service|HM Civil Service]], working in the [[Inland Revenue]] from 1952 until 1962 and [[HM Treasury]] from 1962 until 1965, returning in 1965 as Assistant Secretary in the [[Inland Revenue]], and transferring back to [[HM Treasury]] in 1968.

===General Synod===
In 1970 [[Gerald Ellison]], then [[Bishop of Chester]], suggested that he should apply for the position of Associate Secretary-General of the [[General Synod|General Synod of the Church of England]],&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt; with the intention that, if appointed, he should succeed as Secretary-General on the retirement of Sir John Scott. He was appointed to the Associate's position and he was Secretary-General from 1972 until 1990. It is said that he enjoyed better relations with the Anglo-Catholic archbishops [[Michael Ramsey]] and [[Robert Runcie]] than he did with the evangelical [[Donald Coggan]], for reasons of both Churchmanship and administrative style.&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/news/2006/10/14/db1401.xml 'The Rev Sir Derek Pattinson]', ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 14 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

He was not enthusiastic about the ordination of women but regarded it as inevitable and was quite happy with women priests when they were eventually ordained. He was a keen promoter of black and other ethnic minority members of the synod. He was also a key figure in the establishment of the [[Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe]].&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;

He was first touched by scandal in 1987 in connection with the Preface to ''[[Crockford's Clerical Directory]]'', written anonymously by his friend [[Gareth Bennett|the Revd Canon Gareth Bennett]], Dean of Divinity of [[New College, Oxford]], who committed suicide as a result of the controversy it caused. Pattinson was responsible for commissioning the Preface and was thought to have failed to predict the outcome of publishing it. The Standing Committee of the General Synod decided that he was without blame in the incident.&lt;ref&gt;For details of the ''Crockford'' Affair see obituaries, passim, and Michael De-la-Moy, ''The Church of England: A Portrait'' (London: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1993), pp. 240-1, as well as the article on [[Gareth Bennett]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before his retirement in 1990 he was appointed [[Knight Bachelor]] by the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=52173|page=2|date=15 June 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he received the accolade on 6 November 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=52543|page=8207|date=28 May 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point he was thinking about ordination and, since Church of England clergy are not allowed to receive the accolade, it has been suggested that it was impolitic of him to accept the honour.&lt;ref name=Indy /&gt;  However, correspondence with Buckingham Palace in November 1991 accepted Sir Derek's use of the accolade without setting a precedent for others.

A less formal honour marking his retirement was the singing, in the [[General Synod]], of a variation on the [[Major-General's Song]] from ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' with the line, "He was the very model of a Secretary-General".&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

[[Image:ReverendSirDerekPattinson1992.jpg|thumb|left|The Reverend Sir Derek Pattinson photographed shortly after his priesting in 1992.]]

===Ordination===
Despite not having attended a bishops' selection conference, he was accepted for ordination.&lt;ref&gt;Michael De-la-Moy, ''The Church of England: A Portrait'' (London: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1993), p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; He trained for two terms at [[St Deiniol's Library]] and was [[Ordination#Eastern.2C Roman.2C and Anglican Christianity|ordained]] [[Deacon#Anglican|deacon]] in 1991 by [[Graham Leonard]]. The service was threatened with interruption by a journalist from ''[[The Daily Mail]]'' who wanted to know whether Sir Derek was gay.&lt;ref name=Indy /&gt; Following a further term at the [[College of the Resurrection]] he was [[Ordination#Eastern.2C Roman.2C and Anglican Christianity|ordained]] [[Priest#Anglican or Episcopalian|priest]] in 1992 by [[David Hope, Baron Hope of Thornes|David Hope]]. Both services took place at [[St Gabriel's, Warwick Square|St Gabriel's Church]] in [[Pimlico]], in central London where he was [[non-stipendiary priest]] from 1991 until 2000.

==Private life==
On 30 November 1992 [[Barnaby Miln]] - a homosexual activist, [[Justice of the Peace]], and former member of the House of Laity of the [[General Synod|General Synod of the Church of England]] - was asked to afternoon tea with the Bishop of London who asked about Sir Derek’s drinking problem following reports he had received.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} They agreed, that for the sake of Barnaby Miln's well being, he and Sir Derek should no longer live together. The bishop thanked Barnaby Miln for looking after Sir Derek and assisted him in finding alternative accommodation.  The bishop arranged that Barnaby Miln take Sir Derek, on 1 December 1992, to a consultant in Harley Street in the expectation that he would be sent to a clinic for specialist treatment. The consultant failed to persuade Sir Derek who, the following day, attended a local clergy chapter at Westminster Abbey which happened to be attended by the bishop. Seeing the state he was in, on 3 December 1992 the bishop wrote to Sir Derek suspending his license for an initial period of six weeks.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

On 4 December 1992, ''[[The Independent]]'' claimed that Sir Derek had been living with Barnaby Miln.&lt;ref&gt;Barnaby Miln {{cite web |url=http://web.mac.com/barnabymiln/Site/Homepage.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080814041131/http://web.mac.com/barnabymiln/Site/Homepage.html |archivedate=2008-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Derek&amp;Barnaby.jpg|thumb|right|Sir Derek Pattinson and Barnaby Miln JP photographed in 1986. Sir Derek is wearing the insignia of Master of the Worshipful Company of Parish Clerks.]]

Barnaby Miln returned in September 2000 to live with and care for Sir Derek whose health had deteriorated. In the last edition of ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]'' published before Sir Derek's death Barnaby Miln was named as his partner,&lt;ref name=Telegraph /&gt; and was the executor of his estate.

Pattinson was a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], initiated in 1960 in the Kaisar-i-Hind Lodge (London), and became a [[Holy Royal Arch|Royal Arch Mason]] in 1962 in the Oxford &amp; Cambridge University Chapter (London). He was an officer of the [[United Grand Lodge of England]] from 1979.&lt;ref name=YearBook&gt;{{cite book |title=United Grand Lodge of England: Masonic Year Book (edition 1989-1990) |first= |last= |edition= 1989-1990|chapter= Grand Officers Alphabetically Arranged |volume= |location= London|publisher= UGLE|publication-date= 1989|page= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]] and the [[Savile Club]].&lt;ref name=Indy /&gt; He became a [[Freedom of the City#Freedom of the City of London|Freeman]] of the [[City of London]] in 1973 and was a member of the Woolmen's Company and of the Parish Clerks' Company, of which he was Master 1986/7.

==Death and legacy==
Sir Derek was diagnosed with [[hydrocephalus]] in 2000. He died in London on 10 October 2006 and his ashes are buried in Westminster Abbey. He had held numerous other appointments including membership of the Archbishops' Commission on Church and State (1966–70) and the British Council of Churches (1972–90), the vice-chairmanship of the Grosvenor Chapel Committee (1973–81), the chairmanship of Liddon Trustees (1972–2001), the William Temple Association, and of the English Friends of the Anglican Centre in Rome (1985–2001), and the principalship of the [[Society of the Faith]] (1992–2001).

'''Elizabeth Bowen''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|ən}}; 7 June 1899 &amp;ndash; 22 February 1973) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] novelist and short story writer, notable for some of the best fiction about life in wartime London.

==Life==
[[File:Elizabeth Bowen (here-was-born plaque).jpg|thumb|right|220px|Elizabeth Bowen was born and spent her first seven winters in this house]]Elizabeth Dorothea Cole Bowen was born on 7 June 1899 at 15 Herbert Place in [[Dublin]] and baptised in the nearby [[St Stephen's Church, Dublin|St Stephen's Church]] on Upper Mount Street. Her parents, Henry Charles Cole Bowen and Florence (née Colley) Bowen later brought her to [[Bowen's Court]] at Farahy, near [[Kildorrery]], [[County Cork]], where she spent her summers. When her father became mentally ill in 1907, she and her mother moved to England, eventually settling in [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]]. After her mother died in 1912 Bowen was brought up by her aunts. She was educated at [[Downe House School]] under the headship of [[Olive Willis]]. After some time at art school in London she decided that her talent lay in writing. She mixed with the [[Bloomsbury Group]], becoming good friends with [[Rose Macaulay]] who helped her seek out a publisher for her first book, a collection of short stories entitled ''Encounters'' (1923).

In 1923 she married Alan Cameron, an educational administrator who subsequently worked for the [[BBC]]. The marriage has been described as "a sexless but contented union."&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/closer-than-words-1.1238445 |title=Closer than words |last1=Morrissey |first1=Mary |date=31 January 2009 |publisher=[[Irish Times]] |access-date=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was reportedly never consummated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Walshe |first=Eibhear (ed.) |date=2009 |title=Elizabeth Bowen (Visions and Revisions: Irish Writers in Their Time) |location=[[Sallins]], [[County Kildare]], Ireland |publisher=Irish Academic Press |isbn=978-0716529163}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had various extra-marital relationships, including one with [[Charles Ritchie (diplomat)|Charles Ritchie]], a Canadian diplomat seven years her junior, which lasted over thirty years. She also had an affair with the Irish writer [[Seán Ó Faoláin]] and a relationship with the American poet [[May Sarton]].&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; Bowen and her husband first lived near [[Oxford]], where they socialized with [[Maurice Bowra]], [[John Buchan]] and [[Susan Buchan, Baroness Tweedsmuir|Susan Buchan]], and where she wrote her early novels, including ''[[The Last September]]'' (1929). Following the publication of ''To the North'' (1932) they moved to 2 Clarence Terrace, [[Regent's Park]], [[London]], where she wrote ''[[The House in Paris]]'' (1935) and ''[[The Death of the Heart]]'' (1938). In 1937, she became a member of the Irish Academy of Letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glendinning |first=Victoria |date=1977 |title=Elizabeth Bowen: Portrait of a Writer |location=London |publisher=[[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]] |page=119 |isbn=9780297773696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 Bowen became the first (and only) woman to inherit Bowen's Court, but remained based in England, making frequent visits to Ireland. During [[World War II]] she worked for the British [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]], reporting on Irish opinion, particularly on the issue of [[Irish neutrality|neutrality]].&lt;ref&gt;''Notes On Éire: Espionage Reports to [[Winston Churchill]] by Elizabeth Bowen''.

Aubane Historical Society (2008), ''Elizabeth Bowen: The Enforced Return'' by Neil Corcoran, Oxford University Press (2004){{ISBN missing}} and ''That Neutral Island'' by Clair Wills, Faber and Faber (2007){{ISBN missing}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bowen's political views tended towards [[Traditionalist conservatism#Edmund Burke|Burkean conservatism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb162/is_1_39/ai_n32395103/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/modern_fiction_studies/v056/56.2.linett.html]&lt;/ref&gt; During and after the war she wrote among the greatest expressions of life in wartime London, ''The Demon Lover and Other Stories'' (1945) and ''[[The Heat of the Day]]'' (1948); she was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] the same year.

Her husband retired in 1952 and they settled in Bowen’s Court, where Alan Cameron died a few months later. Many writers visited her at Bowen's Court from 1930 onwards, including [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Eudora Welty]], [[Carson McCullers]], [[Iris Murdoch]], and the historian [[Veronica Wedgwood]]. For years Bowen struggled to keep the house going, lecturing in the United States to earn money. In 1957 her portrait was painted at Bowen's Court by her friend, painter [[Patrick Hennessy (painter)|Patrick Hennessy]]. She travelled to Italy in 1958 to research and prepare ''A Time in Rome'' (1960), but by the following year Bowen was forced to sell her beloved Bowen's Court, which was demolished in 1960. After spending some years without a permanent home, Bowen finally settled at "Carbery", Church Hill, [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]], in 1965.

Her final novel, ''[[Eva Trout (novel)|Eva Trout, or Changing Scenes]]'' (1968), won the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] in 1969 and was shortlisted for the [[Man Booker Prize]] in 1970. Subsequently, she was a judge (alongside her friend [[Cyril Connolly]]) that awarded the 1972 Man Booker Prize to [[John Berger]] for ''[[G (novel)|G]]''. She spent Christmas 1972 at [[Kinsale|Kinsale, County Cork]] with her friends, Major Stephen Vernon and his wife, Lady Ursula (daughter of the [[Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster|Duke of Westminster]]) but was hospitalised upon her return. Here she was visited by Connolly, Lady Vernon, [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Rosamund Lehmann]], and her literary agent, [[Curtis Brown (literary agents)|Spencer Curtis Brown]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Glendinning, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 Bowen developed lung cancer. She died in [[University College Hospital]] on 22 February 1973, aged 73. She is buried with her husband in [[Kildorrery|Farahy, County Cork]] churchyard, close to the gates of Bowen's Court, where there is a memorial plaque to the author (which bears the words of [[John Hanbury Angus Sparrow|John Sparrow]]) at the entrance to St Colman's Church, where a commemoration of her life is held annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irelandxo.com/node/9737 "St Colman's Church, Farahy near Bowen's Court"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20131222000935/http://www.irelandxo.com/node/9737 |date=22 December 2013 }}, Ireland Reaching Out&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30839 "Elizabeth Dorothea Cole Bowen"], (1899–1973), ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, online edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

==Legacy==
In 1977, [[Victoria Glendinning]] published the first biography on Elizabeth Bowen. In 2009, Glendinning published a book about the relationship between Charles Ritchie and Bowen, based on his diaries and her letters to him. In 2012, [[English Heritage]] marked Bowen's Regent's Park home at [[Clarence Terrace]] with a [[blue plaque]].&lt;ref name='EngHet'&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/bowen-elizabeth-1899-1973 |title=Bowen, Elizabeth (1899-1973)|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A blue plaque was unveiled 19 October 2014 to mark Bowen's residence at the Coach House, The Croft, [[Headington]] from 1925-35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordshireblueplaques.org.uk/plaques/bowen.html |title=Elizabeth BOWEN (1899–1973) |author= |date= |publisher=Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Scheme |access-date=17 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026094659/http://www.oxfordshireblueplaques.org.uk/plaques/bowen.html |archivedate=26 October 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Bowen was greatly interested in "life with the lid on and what happens when the lid comes off", in the innocence of orderly life, and in the eventual, irrepressible forces that transform experience. Bowen also examined the betrayal and secrets that lie beneath the veneer of respectability. The style of her works is highly wrought and owes much to literary modernism. She was an admirer of film and influenced by the filmmaking techniques of her day. The locations in which Bowen's works are set often bear heavily on the psychology of the characters and on the plots. Bowen's war novel ''[[The Heat of the Day]]'' (1948) is considered one of the quintessential depictions of London atmosphere during the bombing raids of World War II.

She was also a notable writer of ghost stories.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tartaruspress.com/b36.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Supernatural fiction writer [[Robert Aickman]] considered Elizabeth Bowen to be "the most distinguished living practitioner" of ghost stories. He included her tale 'The Demon Lover' in his anthology ''The Second Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aickmandata.com/aickmanantho.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150720224126/http://www.aickmandata.com/aickmanantho.html |archivedate=20 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gurav''' are an occupational community comprising several [[Caste in India|castes]]. They are among the traditional service providers found in villages, for whom they act in a priestly role, and are found in several [[states of India]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

== Etymology ==
The origin of the word ''Gurav'' is uncertain. The community claim it derives from the [[Sanskrit]] plural of ''[[guru]]''. While known as ''Gurav'' in [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Maharashtra]], they are also called ''Gorava'' in [[Karnataka]] and ''Tapodhan Brahmin'' in [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name="bapat" /&gt;

== Function ==
Both Gurav women and men perform the traditional occupations of their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Water and Womanhood: Religious Meanings of Rivers in Maharashtra |first=Anne |last=Feldhaus |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-19509-283-7 |page=171 |url=https://www.questia.com/read/94037478/water-and-womanhood-religious-meanings-of-rivers |via=[[Questia]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are neither cultivators nor village officers but rather providers of a service deemed necessary for the functioning of the village, as with [[artisan]]s.{{efn|In the state of Maharashtra, the traditional village service providers are known as ''[[Bara Balutedar|balutedhar]]s'' and the system by which they are paid as ''balute''. There are commonly twelve such groups of people, although it may be more or less, and they include occupations such as carpenters, cobblers, potters and oil-pressers. They are distinct from the cultivators and the officers among the village people.&lt;ref name="bapat"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Gurav |first=Jayant Bhalachandra |last=Bapat |title=South Asian Folklore: An Encyclopedia : Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka |editor1-first=Peter J. |editor1-last=Claus |editor2-first=Sarah |editor2-last=Diamond |editor3-first=Margaret Ann |editor3-last=Mills |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-41593-919-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ienxrTPHzzwC&amp;pg=PA272 |pages=272–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Saturday Oilpressers: The Bene Israel in the Konkan |first=Brenda Joseph |last=Ness |title=Charisma and Commitment in South Asian History: Essays Presented to Stanley Wolpert |editor-first=Roger D. |editor-last=Long |publisher=Orient Blackswan |year=2004 |isbn=978-8-12502-641-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tUAVk84xBGUC&amp;pg=PA101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms of payment of ''balute'' differ from those of the [[jajmani system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Caste as a Political Tool |first=Marie-Caroline |last=Saglio-Yatzimirsky |title=From Stigma to Assertion: Untouchability, Identity and Politics in Early and Modern India |editor1-first=Mikael |editor1-last=Aktor |editor2-first=Robert |editor2-last=Deliège |publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-8-76350-775-2 |page=208 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQVeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA208}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} They traditionally serve as priests, maintainers and managers in temples devoted to [[Shiva]], mostly in the southern states of [[Andhra Pradesh]],&lt;!-- source does not mention the new state of Telangana --&gt; Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Some act in a role similar to [[shaman]]s, being intermediaries between the temple idol and the soliciting believer, and others also serve as priests to the families of the [[temple dancer]]s. Their other traditional roles are also connected to Shaivite worship, such as musicianship and the sale both of [[leaf plate]]s and symbolic flowers.&lt;ref name="bapat" /&gt; Local testimony suggests that the Gurav also act in a religious capacity outside temple grounds: at [[harvest]] time in the [[Maval|Mawal]] region, they are called upon to provide a symbolic sprinkling of water at threshing grounds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Social and the Symbolic |editor1-first=Bernard |editor1-last=Bel |editor2-first=Jan |editor2-last=Brouwer |editor3-first=Biswajit |editor3-last=Das |editor4-first=Vibodh |editor4-last=Parthasarathi |editor5-first=Guy |editor5-last=Poitevin |publisher=SAGE Publications |year=2007 |isbn=978-8-13210-117-8 |pages=269–270 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a7yGAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
The Bhavika,{{efn|The Bhavika Gurav are also known as ''Konkani Gurav''.&lt;ref name="bapat" /&gt;}} [[Lingayatism|Lingayat]] and Saiva are the most prominent among the distinct [[endogamy|endogamous]] castes that comprise the Gurav. These groups are in turn subdivided; for example, the Saiva Gurav have Nagari, Nilakantha and Swayambhu as subcastes, while the Lingayat Gurav are split into the Hugara, Jira and Malgara .&lt;ref name="bapat" /&gt;

=== Bhavika Gurav ===
The Bhavika Gurav are found mainly in the [[Konkan]] region of Maharashtra and comprise mostly members drawn from the [[Kunbi]] caste. Few are literate or formally educated even in their own rituals, and the temples that they serve are very rudimentary in style. During folk festivals, members of this community often perform animal sacrifices in honour of the village deities whose shrines they serve.&lt;ref name="bapat" /&gt;

=== Lingayat Gurav ===
The Lingayat Gurav are found mainly in the Konkan region and on the borders between Maharashtra and Karnataka . They do not know from which caste they originate but claim to have migrated to their present regions from Karnataka when they suffered persecution after the death of [[Basava]], the founder of their sect. They are strict vegetarians and believe their high degree of devotion to Shiva makes them superior to other Gurav subgroups. It is this zeal that also causes them to disdain being grouped with other castes.&lt;ref name="bapat" /&gt;

=== Shaiva Gurav ===
According to Jayant Bhalchandra Bapat, a Hindu priest and academic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jayant Bhalchandra Bapa |publisher=D. K. Printworld |url=http://www.dkprintworld.com/abouttheauthor.php?userId=703 |accessdate=2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the Lingayat Gurav believe themselves to be superior among the various Gurav subgroups, it is the Shaiva Gurav who are most respected by the people of Maharashtra. The members of this sub-community perform a sacred thread ceremony in accordance with Brahmin traditions.&lt;ref name="bapat" /&gt;

Mostly literate and educated, the Maharashtrian members of the Shaiva Gurav developed a [[sanskritisation|myth of origin]] in the early 19th century and prefer to call themselves ''Shaiva Brahmin''. Their self-published research, in the form of a clan history known as a ''[[jatipurana]]'',  proposes a lineal connection with the sage [[Dadhichi]] through his son [[Sudarsana]] and thus a [[Brahmin]] status. The legend says that Sudarsana was stripped of certain Vedic powers by an offended Shiva but was also granted the right to perform the [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] rituals. The claims of the community to Brahminhood were accepted both by a ''sankaracharya'' (a respected authority and arbitrator of the Hindu faith) and [[British India|colonial]] law courts but are not accepted in general Maharashtrian society, although Brahmins do acknowledge the right of the Shaiva Gurav to offer the first daily puja.&lt;ref name="bapat" /&gt;

== Socio-economic status ==
In areas other than Maharashtra, the Brahmin status of the Gurav is commonly accepted but they are nonetheless considered to be of a low rank in the social structure.&lt;ref name="bapat" /&gt; The sociologist [[M. N. Srinivas]] noted this peculiarity of low-status Brahminhood in particular regarding the Tapodhan of Gujarat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=India: Social Structure |first=M. N. |last=Srinivas |authorlink=M. N. Srinivas |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=1980 |isbn=978-1-41282-619-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WIfuf2aWnj8C&amp;pg=PA6 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The First Spring: The Golden Age of India |first=Abraham |last=Eraly |authorlink=Abraham Eraly |publisher=Penguin Books India |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-67008-478-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=te1sqTzTxD8C&amp;pg=PA286 |page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Maharashtra they are considered to be a [[Brahmin]] community in the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] ritual ranking system known as ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Intersections: Socio-cultural Trends in Maharashtra |first=Meera |last=Kosambi |publisher=Orient Blackswan |year=2000 |isbn=978-8-12501-878-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XU8dmAiaZSgC&amp;pg=PA39 |page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Experience of Hinduism: Essays on Religion in Maharashtra |editor1-first=Eleanor |editor1-last=Zelliot |editor1-link=Eleanor Zelliot |editor2-first=Maxine |editor2-last=Berntsen |publisher=SUNY Press |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-88706-662-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7PDr-QF4YmYC&amp;pg=PA343 |page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is probable that the Gurav are among the less well-paid among the various ''[[Bara Balutedar|balutedhar]]'' communities, perhaps because the product of their labours, being mostly intangible, is less apparent than that of, say, the carpenters and blacksmiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Exploitation or Function in the Interpretation of Jajmani |first=Henry |last=Orenstein |journal=Southwestern Journal of Anthropology |volume=18 |issue=4 |year=1962 |pages=302–316 |jstor=3628985 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not among those groups who have noticeably suffered historically from the effects of social degradation or lack of access to opportunity, although in Maharashtra they are listed among the [[Other Backward Class]]es under India's [[Reservation in India|system of positive discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Identifying 'Backwardness' in Maharashtra |first=S.

'''Hassan Ngeze''' (born 25 December 1957) is a [[Rwanda]]n [[journalist]] best known for spreading anti-[[Tutsi]] [[propaganda]] and [[Hutu]] superiority through his newspaper, ''[[Kangura]]'', which he founded in 1990.&lt;ref name="ICTR 01" /&gt; Ngeze was a founding member&lt;ref name="ICTR 01" /&gt; and leadership figure in the [[Coalition for the Defence of the Republic]] (CDR), a [[Rwanda]]n [[Hutu Power]] political party that is known for helping to incite the genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Christian P. Scherrer, Institute for Research on Ethnicity and Conflict Resolution. ''Ongoing crisis in Central Africa: revolution in Congo and disorder in the Great Lakes region: conflict impact assessment and policy options''. Institute for Research on Ethnicity and Conflict Resolution, 1998. Pp. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Front Cover Dina Temple-Raston. ''Justice on the Grass: Three Rwandan Journalists, Their Trial for War Crimes and a Nation's Quest for Redemption''. Simon and Schuster, 2005. Pp. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ngeze is best known for publishing the "[[Hutu Ten Commandments]]" in the December edition of ''Kangura'' in 1990, which were essential in creating and spreading the anti-Tutsi feeling among Rwandan Hutus that led to the [[Rwandan Genocide]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Ngeze was born in [[Rubavu]] commune, [[Gisenyi]] prefecture, in Rwanda.  He is a [[Islam|Muslim]], of [[Hutu]] ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;Wax, Emily. “[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/476229571.html?dids=476229571:476229571&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Dec+04%2C+2003&amp;author=Emily+Wax&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=Journalists+Sentenced+In+Rwanda+Genocide%3B+Prosecutor+Said+'Hate+Media'+Urged+Killings&amp;pqatl=google Journalists Sentenced In Rwanda Genocide; Prosecutor Said 'Hate Media' Urged Killings]”, Washington Post (2003-12-04).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to working as a journalist in 1978, Ngeze allegedly also earned money as a bus driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Allan (Ed.) |authorlink= |title=The Media and the Rwanda Genocide |url=http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/Pages/IDRCBookDetails.aspx?PublicationID=131 |accessdate=19 March 2013 |year=2007 |publisher=Pluto Press, Fountain Publishers, IDRC |location= |isbn=0-74532-625-0 |page=136–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kangura, the "Hutu Ten Commandments" and RTLM===
Ngeze was the Editor-in-Chief of the bimonthly ''Kangura'' magazine,&lt;ref name="ICTR 01" /&gt; which was initially intended as a counterweight to the popular anti-government newspaper ''Kanguka'', and was financed by high-level members in the ruling [[Mouvement républicain national pour la démocratie et le développement|MRND]] party of Hutu dictator [[Juvénal Habyarimana]]. Ngeze and his magazine had extensive links to the [[Akazu]], the network of officials surrounding the President and [[Agathe Habyarimana|his wife]]; this group included supporters of [[Hutu Power]] and the architects of the [[Rwandan Genocide]].

In December 1990, Ngeze published the ''[[Hutu Ten Commandments]]'' (sometimes called the ''Ten Commandments of the Bahutu'') in ''Kangura'', which made disparaging remarks about Tutsis in general and Tutsi women in particular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trumanwebdesign.com/~catalina/commandments.htm Hutu Ten Commandments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512004333/http://www.trumanwebdesign.com/~catalina/commandments.htm |date=2006-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the ''Hutu Ten Commandments'', Ngeze revived, revised, and reconciled the [[Hamitic#Hamitic hypothesis|Hamitic myth]] (Tutsis were considered by the Europeans to be a "Hamitic race" superior to the "Negroid" populations of Sub-Saharan Africa based on their having more Caucasoid facial features; that is, the idea that the Tutsis were foreign invaders and thus should not be part of the Hutu-majority country) and the rhetoric of the [[Rwandan Revolution|Hutu revolution]] to promote a doctrine of militant Hutu purity. The "Hutu Ten Commandments" were essential in creating and spreading the anti-Tutsi feeling among Rwandan Hutus that led to the [[Rwandan Genocide]].

In 1993, Ngeze became a [[shareholder]] and [[correspondent]] for the newly founded [[Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines]] (RTLM), which was largely a radio equivalent of ''Kangura''. He was interviewed approximately eight times on RTLM.&lt;ref name="Thompson 01" &gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Allan (Ed.) |authorlink= |title=The Media and the Rwanda Genocide |url=http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/Pages/IDRCBookDetails.aspx?PublicationID=131 |accessdate=19 March 2013 |year=2007 |publisher=Pluto Press, Fountain Publishers, IDRC |location= |isbn=0-74532-625-0 |page=118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genocide ===
During the [[Rwandan Genocide]], Ngeze provided RTLM with names of people to be killed in his prefecture,&lt;ref&gt;[http://unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=31&amp;mnid=4 International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, Summary of Judgment]&lt;/ref&gt; which were broadcast on air.  He was interviewed by RTLM and Radio Rwanda several times between April and June 1994, and in these broadcasts called for the extermination of the Tutsis and Hutus in opposition to the government.

At the same time, ''Kangura'' published lists of people to be eliminated by the military and the [[Interahamwe]] and [[Impuzamugambi]] militias during the genocide.

Ngeze is alleged to have personally supervised and taken part in [[torture]], [[Rape|mass rape]], and killings in his native Gisenyi Prefecture. He was also an organizer of the [[Impuzamugambi]] militia.

===Trial and imprisonment===
Ngeze fled Rwanda in June 1994 as the country fell to the [[Rwandese Patriotic Front|RPF]].  He was arrested in [[Mombasa]], [[Kenya]] on July 18, 1997, and was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] in 2003, by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]]. In 2007, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTR reversed some of his convictions, but confirmed others. It also changed his life sentence to one of 35 years' imprisonment.

On 3 December 2008 he was sent to [[Mali]] to serve his sentence of imprisonment.

'''Herbert William Weekes''' (8 May 1841 – 21 November 1914) was a well-known English [[Genre works#Genre painting|genre]] and [[animal painter]] of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] period who specialized in portraying animals in humorous, human-like situations.

Weekes appears to have used his middle name, William, for all but formal purposes. He lived and worked for most of his life in London, at 21 Oppidans Road, [[Primrose Hill]].&lt;ref name="Burlington"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Invaluable"/&gt; In 1865, he married artist Caroline Anne Henshaw (born ca. 1844), of [[Hammersmith]].&lt;ref name="British Census"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGI record"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = FamilySearch International Genealogical Index | work = | publisher = FamilySearch.org | year = 1881 | url = http://www.familysearch.org/eng/search/IGI/individual_record.asp?recid=500137223138&amp;lds=1&amp;region=2&amp;frompage=99

Known as an animal and genre painter of the Victorian Neoclassical style, Weekes' work was popular, and helped expand 19th century animal painting from its traditional role of simply recording beasts into a way of reflecting human life.&lt;ref name="Haynes"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Herbert William Weekes Biography | work = | publisher = Haynes Fine Art of Broadway | date = | url = http://www.haynesfineart.com/artists/william-weekes.htm | doi = | accessdate = 28 Jan 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080216063958/http://www.haynesfineart.com/artists/william-weekes.htm | archivedate = 2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Artnet"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =  Herbert William Weekes | work = | publisher = Artnet | date = | url = http://www.artnet.com/artist/654188/herbert-william-weekes.html | doi =

His work shows a sensitive understanding of his subject matter, and part of his success in capturing the peaceful country atmosphere depicted in so many of his paintings lay in his affection for it.&lt;ref name="Millington Adams"&gt;{{cite web| title =  Suspicion| publisher = Cinoa| url = http://www.cinoa.org/exhibits/55323|doi =| accessdate = 13 Jul 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was greatly influenced by one of the foremost animal painters of the nineteenth century, Sir [[Edwin Henry Landseer]].&lt;ref name="Invaluable"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink =

Weekes contributed illustrations for ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' in 1883, and exhibited extensively in various London and provincial galleries. His works were well received - although not by everyone: a contemporary wit described his paintings as “Weekes' Weak Squeaks”.&lt;ref name="Collins-Quiet"/&gt;

His works were alternatively signed with the initials 'WW' (sometimes overlaid), 'W. Weekes', 'William Weekes', 'Herbert William Weekes', 'H.W. Weekes', 'H. Weekes', and simply 'Weekes'. They were exhibited in a variety of venues from 1864 to 1904, with frequencies as follows:&lt;ref name="Collins-Quiet"/&gt;
*[[Royal Academy]] (59)
*[[Walker Art Gallery]], Liverpool (15)

'''Hermann of Reichenau''' (July 18, 1013 &amp;ndash; September 24, 1054), also called '''Hermannus Contractus''' or '''Hermannus Augiensis''' or '''Herman the Cripple''',  was an 11th-century scholar, composer, [[music theory|music theorist]], mathematician, and astronomer. He composed the Marian prayer [[Alma Redemptoris Mater]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Tradition of Catholic Prayer'' by Christian Raab, Harry Hagan 2007 {{ISBN|0-8146-3184-3}} page 234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Prayers by James Socías 2006 {{ISBN|0-87973-579-1}} page 472&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[beatification|beatified]] (cultus confirmed) in 1863.

==Childhood==
Hermann was a son of the [[Count]] of [[Altshausen]]. He was crippled by a [[paralysis|paralytic]] disease from early childhood. He was born July 18, 1013, with a [[cleft palate]], [[cerebral palsy]] and is said to have had [[spina bifida]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://catholicfire.blogspot.com/2006/09/saint-of-day-blessed-herman-cripple.html Catholic Fire: Saint of the Day: Blessed Herman the Cripple, Monk (1013–1054)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the evidence, however, more recent scholarship indicates Hermann possibly had either [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] or [[spinal muscular atrophy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Hermann_of_Reichenau.html O'Connor, J. J., Robertson, E. F., "Hermann of Reichenau", ''MacTutor History of Mathematics archive'', University of St. Andrew's]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C Brunhölzl, "Thoughts on the illness of Hermann von Reichenau (1019–1054)", Sudhoffs Arch. 83 (2) (1999), 239-243.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, he had great difficulty moving and could [[speech impediment|hardly speak]].  At seven, he was placed in a [[Benedictine]] monastery by his parents who could no longer look after him.  He grew up in the monastery, learning from the monks and developing a keen interest in both [[theology]] and the world around him.

==Adulthood==
He spent most of his life in the [[Abbey of Reichenau]], an island on [[Lake Constance]] in Germany. Hermann contributed to all four arts of the [[quadrivium]]. He was renowned as a [[music]]al composer (among his surviving works are [[Liturgy of the Hours|officia]] for [[St. Afra]] and [[St. Wolfgang]]). He also wrote a [[treatise]] on the science of [[music]], several works on [[geometry]] and [[arithmetic]]s and [[astronomy|astronomical]] treatises (including instructions for the construction of an [[astrolabe]], at the time a very novel device in [[Western Europe]]). As a historian, he wrote a detailed [[chronicle]] from the [[birth of Christ]] to his own present day, ordering them after the reckoning of the [[Christian era]]. One of his disciples [[Berthold of Reichenau]] continued it.

At twenty, Hermann was professed as a [[Benedictine monk]], spending the rest of his life in a [[monastery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=283 Bl. Herman the Cripple - Catholic Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was [[literacy|literate]] in several languages, including [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin language|Latin]] and wrote about [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]] and [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Schlager, Patricius, "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07266a.htm Hermann Contractus]," ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York: Robert Appleton, 1910), retrieved May 13, 2014, from New Advent.&lt;/ref&gt; He built musical and astronomical instruments and was also a famed religious poet. When he went [[blindness|blind]] in later life, he began writing hymns, the best known of which is ''[[Salve Regina]]'' (''Hail Holy Queen'').

Herman died in a monastery on September 24, 1054, aged 40.  The [[Roman Catholic Church]] beatified him in 1863.

==Legacy and influence==

Three of five symphonies that were written by [[Russia]]n composer [[Galina Ustvolskaya]] are based on his texts.

'''Hiển Khánh Vương''' ({{lang-vi-hantu|{{linktext|顯|慶|王}}}} "Prince Hiển Khánh") was the father of [[Lý Thái Tổ]]. Very little is known about him, as not much was recorded about him historically; even his real name remains unknown.

==Biography==
The paternal lineage of [[Lý Thái Tổ]] was not prominently recorded in Vietnamese official history. Little was known about his father other than that he was of [[Fujian]] extraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of the Chinese Overseas|author=Lynn Pan|publisher=Harvard University Press|ISBN=0674252101|pages=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' by [[Shen Kuo]], Lý Thái Tổ was "a man of Fujian extraction".&lt;ref&gt;''Dream Pool Essays'', [[:s:zh:夢溪筆談/卷25|vol. 25]]: "桓死安南大亂久無酋長其後國人共立閩人李公蘊為主"&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Vietnamese legend, Lý Thái Tổ had no biological father. His mother, Phạm Thị, dreamed of copulating with a [[Xian (Taoism)|Taoist immortal]]. Phạm became pregnant and later gave birth to Lý Thái Tổ at [[Cổ Pháp Pagoda]]. At the age of 3, Phạm brought him back to the pagoda. [[Lý Khánh Văn]] (李慶文), head monk of the pagoda, adopted him and named him Lý Công Uẩn.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư]]'', [[:s:zh:大越史記全書/本紀卷之二|Bản kỷ Quyển 2]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Việt Nam sử lược]]'', [[:s:vi:Việt Nam sử lược/Quyển I/Phần III/Chương IV|Quyển 1 Phần 3 Chương 4]]: "Tục truyền rằng Công Uẩn không có cha, mẹ là Phạm-thị 范 氏 đi chơi chùa Tiêu-sơn 橅 山 (làng Tiêu-sơn, phủ Từ-sơn), nằm mộng thấy đi lại với thần nhân rồi về có thai đẻ ra đứa con trai. Lên ba tuổi đem cho người sư ở chùa Cổ-pháp tên là Lý khánh Văn 李 慶 文 làm con nuôi, mới đặt tên là Lý công Uẩn."&lt;/ref&gt;

After Lý Công Uẩn became emperor, he granted his father the title '''Hiển Khánh vương''' (顯慶王) posthumously.&lt;ref name="khamdinh"&gt;''[[Khâm định Việt sử Thông giám cương mục]]'', Chính biên Quyển 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mordern research==
Chinese-Vietnamese historian Li Taishan (李泰山) discovered a record in the genealogy of the Li clan of Anhai which showed that the father of Lý Công Uẩn was Li Chun'an ({{zh|c=李淳安|p=Lǐ Chún'ān}}, Vietnamese: '''Lý Thuần An''', 9 October 921 – 29 November 999{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}).&lt;ref name="quanzhou" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.qzcns.com/qznews/2014/0220/571.html|title=越南归侨李泰山著书 忆述“从越南到泉州”|last=|first=|date=2014-02-20|work=今日泉州网|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical sources disagree on whether Li Chun'an's wife Phạm Thị Ngà gave birth to Lý Công Uẩn in Fujian or Jiaozhi.&lt;ref name="Nguyen1997"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=12MEAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=2%29,+points+out+that+according+to+a+Chinese+source,+Ly+Cong+Uan+was+originally+from+Fujian,+China.+Tran+Quoc+Vtfcing+is+of+the+opinion+that+Uan+himself&amp;dq=2%29,+points+out+that+according+to+a+Chinese+source,+Ly+Cong+Uan+was+originally+from+Fujian,+China.+Tran+Quoc+Vtfcing+is+of+the+opinion+that+Uan+himself&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZS7NVJOTAYi9ggSCw4GACQ&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwADgy|title=Thiền Uyển Tập Anh|author=Cuong Tu Nguyen|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-8248-1948-4|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="quanzhou" /&gt;

Li Chun'an was said to be the first of two sons of [[Li Song (politician)|Li Song]]. After Li Song was falsely accused and executed in 948 during the [[Later Han (Five Dynasties)|Later Han dynasty]], Li Chun'an escaped to [[Quanzhou]]&lt;ref&gt;{{vi icon}} [https://nghiencuulichsu.com/2017/01/22/ban-ve-than-the-cua-ly-cong-uan/ Origin of Lý Thái Tổ]&lt;/ref&gt; which was then controlled by the warlord [[Liu Congxiao]] (but nominally under the control of the [[Southern Tang]] dynasty).

He resettled in the Li Family village in [[Anhai]], Quanzhou and became a Water mid Land Transport Commissioner (水陸轉運使) at some point. Some time later, he deserted his official post to escape from an unspecified danger, and traveled by [[South China Sea]] to [[Jiaozhi]] (now Vietnam), [[Champa]] and [[Khmer Empire]] for business, spending the most time in Jiaozhi. He fathered several children, including Lý Công Uẩn who would later become the founding emperor of the [[Lý dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{zh-hans}} [http://www.qzwb.com/gb/content/2008-12/18/content_2975986.htm 两安海人曾是安南皇帝 有关专家考证李公蕴、陈日煚籍属晋江安海]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="quanzhou"&gt;{{zh-hans}} [http://www.fjsen.com/d/2010-10/12/content_3755527.htm 千年前泉州人李公蕴越南当皇帝 越南史上重要人物之一]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2565">'''I Nyoman Renbang''' (1937–2001) was an Indonesian [[musician]], composer, teacher and instrument maker. He is considered by many ethnomusicologists as one of the most influential Balinese musicians and composers of the twentieth century (including [[I Nyoman Kaler]], [[I Wayan Lotring]], ppI Gusti Putu Madia Geria]], [[I Wayan Suweca]] and [[I Wayan Berata]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sinti, Nyoman, Gamelan Gambuh, Gamelan Siwa Nada, http://depts.washington.edu/ethmusic/sinti_notes.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
I Nyoman Rembang started his musical career when he joined the local Gambuh group in his village. At seven he was already playing gender wayang on a professional basis. At eight he began to learn to play the gamelan legong from many teachers around [[Badung]], Bali.
In his teenage, Rembang was the most accomplished musician in Bali. It made the Bali Government offer him a job to teach the Balinese Gamelan at the Surakarta Conservatorium in Central Java. He also became a specialist of Javanese gamelan under RM Yudoprawiro, a nobleman from [[Surakarta Palace]]. He is live in Bali.

==Teaching==
In 1960, with the former Bali's second governor, Ida Bagus Mantra, Rembang pioneered the establishment of the Balinese Conservatorium. In 1963, Rembang resigned from the Surakarta Conservatorium and concentrated in Bali where he taught in the College of Music SMKI. He was also often invited to teach in Europe as a visiting artist, composer and performer. He was the teacher of many contemporary composers and musicians such as [[I Wayan Suweca]]  and [[André Éric Létourneau]].

==Compositions==
After finishing as a teacher at Denpasar's School of Arts in the mid-1980s, he created The Bungbang gamelan, a traditional instrument made from lengths of bamboo which can produce a certain tone based on it length. To play this gamelan at least 32 musicians are required and harmonises with suling (bambo's flutes). I Nyoman Rembang created many new compositions for this ensemble. Many of them have been presented during the annual Bali Arts Festival and on several occasions in Europe, America and Asia.

'''James Murray Spangler''' (November 20, 1848 – January 22, 1915) was an American inventor, salesman and janitor who invented the first commercially successful portable electric vacuum cleaner that revolutionized household carpet cleaning. His device was not the first vacuum cleaner. However, Spangler's device was the first that was practical for home use. It was the first to use both a cloth filter bag and cleaning attachments. Spangler improved this basic model and received a patent for it in 1908. He formed the Electric Suction Sweeper Company to manufacture his device. [[The Hoover Company|William H. Hoover]] was so impressed with the vacuum cleaner that he bought into Spangler's business and patents.

==Early years and personal life==
Spangler was one of ten children born to Mr. William Spangler &amp; Mrs. Elizabeth Lind Spangler on November 20, 1848.  The Spangler family was originally from [[Plains Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Plains Township]], Pennsylvania and settled in [[Stark County, Ohio]].

On May 21, 1874, Spangler married Elista (Lettie) Amanda Holtz.  They had three children, Clarence, Francis and Jennie. In 1880 they moved to Akron.

==Careers, jobs and patents==

After moving to Akron, Spangler was in business with his brother selling gent's furnishings. He also worked for the Aultman Company as a salesman

Spangler was granted a patent on a grain harvester in 1887. He invented certain new and boring improvements such as the sliding tailboard made of sheet metal. He removed a standard tailboard and provided the sliding tailboard to regulate the width of the platform and adjust it to grain of different length. He also installed guards that prevented straw or grain from wrapping around the roller.
Spangler invented a combined [[hay rake]] and [[tedder (machine)|tedder]] which was patented in 1893. By his peculiar arrangement, he was able to provide a combined hay rake and tedder in one machine, thereby reducing the cost. He formed a company for its sale which was unsuccessful and short-lived.

In 1897 he was granted a patent for a [[velocipede]] wagon and sold his invention to a company in Springfield, Ohio. He claimed as new “the combination of the body or box, mounted upon traveling wheels”.&lt;ref&gt;"Velocipede-Wagon" {{US patent|576746}}, issue date: Feb 1897&lt;/ref&gt;  The bicycle became quite popular at the same time and interfered with the sale of the wagon.

He later worked as a sweeper at the Zollinger Dept. Store located in the Folwell Building. located on the northwest corner of the public square in Canton, Ohio. (The top floor was occupied – in 1907 - by the Elks Club and the remaining floors occupied by the Wm. R. Zollinger Dept. Store.)

==Invention of the portable electric vacuum cleaner==
Spangler was an asthmatic. Almost 60 and cursed with strong disease, he grew frustrated at the tiring and dusty work of sweeping the carpet in the store where he worked. He suspected that the carpet sweeper he used on the job was the source of his cough. A tinkerer at heart, he set his mind to making an electric carpet sweeper.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.cl/books?id=wGwj8UYt7g8C&amp;pg=PT207 Mark Jackson. "Asthma: The Biography". Ed. Oxford University Press, 2009] {{ISBN|9780191622823}}. pp. 207–208]&lt;/ref&gt;

While watching a rotary street sweeper in operation, Spangler got the idea to mount the motor from a sewing machine onto a carpet sweeper and cut a hole in the back of the sweeper to attach fan blades which would blow dirt out of the rear of the cleaner into an attached dirt bag (a pillow case he borrowed from his wife).  He attached a leather belt from the motor shaft to the wood cylinder brush roll and a broom stick supplied the handle.  In his next attempt he used a wooden soap box as the main body.  He used his invention successfully in cleaning the Folwell Building. Bringing his ingenuity to bear on the problem, Spangler fashioned a tin box, a pillowcase, an electric fan, and a broom handle into something we might recognize today as a crude vacuum cleaner. Spangler called it a "suction sweeper."

Despite being primitive and unwieldy, it worked—Spangler's asthma abated, and he received a patent for his troubles. He also realized that he might finally have a salable invention. Spangler first tested his invention in 1907. During the next year, he refined the vacuum numerous times, and on June 2, 1908, he received a patent for his sweeper.

Spangler, with $5000.00 invested by a friend, formed the Electric Suction Sweeper Company. Ray Harned, nephew and financial representative of F.G. and W.H. Folwell, formed a partnership with Spangler in the fall of 1907.  The Folwells had financed Zollingers and were financing Spangler who had filed an application for a patent in September 1907.  However, in just a few months, finances were gone. Spangler didn't have the capital to mass-produce his gadget. So he showed the suction sweeper to his cousin Susan Hoover, who tried it, liked it, and extolled its virtues to her husband, [[The Hoover Company|William Hoover]], a leather-goods manufacturer.

The timing was fortuitous: With the automobile gaining popularity, William Hoover was concerned about the market for his horse collars and harnesses, and was eager to diversify. In 1908 he bought Spangler's patent, and he soon had a small staff toiling in the corner of his leather shop, turning out six suction sweepers a day. William Hoover made further improvements to the vacuum cleaner that resembled a bagpipe attached to a cake box, a novel look that was very functional. Sluggish sales of the Hoover vacuum cleaner were given a kick by Hoover’s ten-day, free home trial. Hoover came up with the idea of door-to-door salesmen who gave home demonstrations of the new vacuum cleaners. Hoover's success means that most people today associate the vacuum cleaner with him, rather than with Spangler.

==Later years==
After Spangler sold the patents to William Hoover, he stayed on with the Hoover Company as the superintendent. Spangler's wife and daughter (Jennie Spangler Painter) made all the bags for the sweepers until 1914 when the bag making was taken to New Berlin. His son, Clarence, worked for about a year with The Electric Suction Sweeper Co. in New Berlin.  He became very ill and died in December 1911.

Spangler was planning the first vacation of his life, a trip to Florida.  He died on January 22, 1915, the night before he was expected to leave for the trip at the age of 66. Spangler's family continued to receive royalties until his patent expired June 2, 1925.

'''James "Wild Jimmy" Haggerty''' (died January 25, 1871) was an American criminal and well-known underworld mobfigure in [[Philadelphia]] and later in [[New York City]] during the mid-to late 19th century. Jimmy Haggerty was the leader of the [[Schuylkill Rangers]], a predominantly Irish-American street gang, which terrorized the [[South Philadelphia]] [[shore|waterfront]], specifically its local wharves and coal yards, for over 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;Randall G.

''The American Metropolis from Knickerbocker Days to the Present Time''. London: The Authors' Syndicate, 1897. (pg. 25)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
James Haggerty was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] to a large working-class family near the banks of the [[Schuylkill River]]; his boyhood home was located on Arch Street in the area between Eighteenth and Nineteenth Street known as "McAran's Garden". His father, John Haggerty, was a "boss" [[drayman]] widely respected by the local business community ''"as an honest, upright and faithful servant"''. Haggerty remained free of criminal activity during his childhood, however he did not attend school and received little education.

Jimmy Haggerty age 21 became employed a mule driver for the [[Reading Railroad]]. He continued in this profession, as well as ran a local saloon, until the start of the [[American Civil War]] in which he voluntarily enlisted in the [[Union Army]].&lt;ref name="Article"&gt;"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1871/01/28/78756896.pdf The Haggerty Homicide.; Formal Investigation by Coroner Herrman Evidence by the Eye-Witnesses to the Affray No Verdict Rendered Reddy Admitted to Bail Departure of the Remains for Philadelphia]". &lt;u&gt;New York Times.&lt;/u&gt; 28 Jan 1871&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal career in Philadelphia==
Although it is unknown under the exact circumstances he left the service, whether he received an [[honorable discharge]] or took "[[desertion|French leave]]", he soon became a "[[bounty jumper]]". He became acquainted with a number of known criminals during this time and, returning to Philadelphia following the war, became involved in illegal [[bare-knuckle boxing]] and eventually [[petty theft]], [[armed robbery]] and [[burglary]]. Although he was considered extremely violent when drunk, police officers testified to his reluctance to murder a victim in cold blood and described the frequent use of his pistol as a [[blackjack (weapon)|blackjack]] in confrontations, he was connected to a number of major robberies during his career. Among them were the robberies of the Eleventh Street and Chestnut Street Banks, the Philadelphia Savings Bank and the safe burglary of the Dancannon Iron Works. He was also involved in the robbery of White's Dental Depot where an African-American watchman was murdered.&lt;ref name="Article"/&gt;

After numerous arrests for theft and similar offenses, he and [[Hugh Murphy]] were convicted of the robbery of a Ninth Street store and sentenced to ten years imprisonment on December 12, 1865. He was pardoned by Governor [[Andrew G. Curtin]] eight months later, in part to Haggerty's political connections and his promise to leave the country upon his release, and lived in Canada for a brief time before returning to the city to resume his criminal career. Haggerty remained a major underworld figure in Philadelphia until January 1869 when he was arrested on several counts of assault with intent to kill; during his arrest, he shot the arresting police officer.&lt;ref name="Article"/&gt;

He was caught trying to escape from prison but was later released on bail and fled the city. Staying in New York for a brief time, he returned to Philadelphia in April to surrender himself to authorities after the wounded police officer had received "[[hush money]]". He won both court cases against him, but was ordered at the second trial to return to the [[Eastern State Penitentiary]] by the District Attorney for violating the terms of his release. While his lawyers argued the ruling, Haggerty escaped from the courthouse during a recess in what was suspected to have been planned.&lt;ref name="Article"/&gt;

==Criminal years in New York City and death==
He eventually returned to New York where he resided during the last two years of his life. He was involved in disputes with a number of criminal figures, for example, when he and [[Billy Tracy]] were thrown out of a Bowery gambling resort by its owner [[Harry Hill (sportsman)|Harry Hill]] and British lightweight boxer [[Billy Edwards]] in November 1870.&lt;ref&gt;"Rampant Rowdyism.; Desperate Attempt to Murder Harry Hill in His Saloon--Arrest of One Man". &lt;u&gt;New York Times.&lt;/u&gt; 11 Nov 1870&lt;/ref&gt; On the afternoon of January 24, 1871, Haggerty and three others arrived at [[Jem Mace]]'s ''Capitol Saloon'' on Twenty-Third Street. They had become intoxicated while traveling by [[sleigh]] along Harlem Lane and, shortly after their arrival, they became involved in a violent altercation with another group of patrons. It was thought that Haggerty and his party were about to use their pistols when a local patrolman and a City Hall officer arrived from nearby Booth's Theater. At the appearance of the patrolman walking through the saloon door, Haggerty drew his revolver and [[pistol whip]]ed him sending the officer outside. As the two officers went to get reinforcements, Haggerty and his men made their escape on the sleigh. His whereabouts remained unknown until early the next morning when he entered Patrick Egan's saloon. While there, his friend Billy Tracy became involved in a dispute with [[Shang Draper]] stemming from the earlier dispute at Jem Mace's saloon. [[Reddy the Blacksmith]], a longtime member of the [[Bowery Boys]], attempted to separate the two but Haggerty confronted Reddy and demanded that he stay out of it. As the two argued, Haggerty reportedly attempted to grab a [[decanter]] from the bar to strike the Bowery Boy with causing Reddy to draw his pistol and shot Haggerty in the abdomen. Haggerty was taken to a room in [[Houston Street (Manhattan)|West Houston Street]] where claimed he did not know either Tracy or Draper and that he was so intoxicated that he was unable to recognize who fired the shot. Although mortally wounded, an examination finding the bullet had penetrated his [[intestines]], Haggerty refused to name his attacker and died from his wounds later that evening.&lt;ref&gt;""Reddy" Again.; Another Deed of Blood by One of Our Rulers.

[[File:Jem mace.jpg|thumb|left|200px|In 1871, Jimmy Haggerty, arrived in the [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]] Capital Saloon owned by former champion boxer [[Jem Mace]] and was mortally wounded in a bar fight from a gun shot received by [[Reddy the Blacksmith]], of the [[Bowery Boys]] gang. Photograph of Jem Mace]]

His funeral was perhaps one of the biggest held in Philadelphia's history and took place at his mother's residence at the northeast corner of Twenty-Third and Filbert Streets, the longtime headquarters of Schuylkill Rangers, and was attended by what was thought to be one of the largest criminal gatherings of the era. Among the hundred or so mourners included Squire McMullin, John Ahern and Robert Lister Smith.&lt;ref&gt;"James Haggerty.; His Funeral in Philadelphia Sunday A Large Assembly Scenes and Incidents". &lt;u&gt;New York Times.&lt;/u&gt; 31 Jan 1871&lt;/ref&gt;

An official inquest was held in the days following his death, attracting a number of prominent criminals such as [[Dan Noble]], [[Joe King (criminal)|Joe King]], [[Johnny Moore (criminal)|Johnny Moore]], [[Richard Barron (criminal)|Richard Barron]] and [[Broker Dick]] among others,&lt;ref&gt;"The Haggerty Homicide.; Post-Mortem Examination The Inquest to be Held To-Day". &lt;u&gt;New York Times.&lt;/u&gt; 27 Jan 1871&lt;/ref&gt; before it was finally concluded on February 1 with Reddy being released on a $10,000 bail.&lt;ref&gt;"The Haggerty Homicide.; Conclusion of the Inquest A Verdict Against Reddy the Blacksmith The Prisoner Held to Bail in $10,000". &lt;u&gt;New York Times.&lt;/u&gt; 02 Feb 1871&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2960">The '''John Charles Walters Company''' was a production company formed in 1978 by four former employees of [[MTM Enterprises]]: [[James L. Brooks]], [[David Davis (TV producer)|David Davis]], [[Stan Daniels]] and [[Ed. Weinberger]].  The company existed from 1978 until 1983 and produced the TV show ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]''.

The foursome who created John Charles Walters were part of the creative team that produced ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' and its spinoff ''[[Phyllis (TV series)|Phyllis]]'', as well as ''[[The Betty White Show]]'' among others, during the 1970s.  They were lured away by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] following the end of ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'''s run. Paramount financed the John Charles Walters Company during its existence.

The company also produced ''[[The Associates (U.S. TV series)|The Associates]]'', a TV [[sitcom]] about a small group of young [[Wall Street]] lawyers which ran during the 1979 television season starring [[Martin Short]].  The show lasted for nine of the 13 episodes produced, but received two [[Golden Globe]] nominations after its cancellation.

==Company name==
According to a 2003 interview, James L. Brooks said that the company was named the John Charles Walters Company because the foursome "wanted a venerable Protestant name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.tv/emmymag/june03/foundation.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041224104807/http://www.emmys.tv/emmymag/june03/foundation.php |archivedate=2004-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''Hailing Taxi'' indicates that the partners discovered an old pub sign that said "Charles Walters."  They bought it in order to make it their logo, but then discovered that there was a director in Hollywood named Charles Walters.  They added the name John to avoid legal problems.

The only known existence of Walters appears at the end of both ''Taxi'' and ''The Associates''. In the end credits, the back of Walters is seen leaving his office while a female voice off-screen wishes him good night (or Merry Christmas in holiday-themed episodes); Walters merely groans in response while he puts his hat on as he exits. [[Ed. Weinberger]] provided the voice of Walters during the sequence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gilbertpodcast.com/ed-weinberger/|title=Ed. Weinberger - Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast!|accessdate=2017-12-08|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The woman is Weinberger's actual assistant{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}.

'''John Hancock''' ({{OldStyleDateDY|January 23,|1737|January 12, 1736&lt;!-- EDITOR'S NOTE: 1736 is correct. In the old calendar, the new year began on March 25.--&gt;}}{{snds}}October 8, 1793) was an [[Americans|American]] merchant, statesman, and prominent [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] of the [[American Revolution]]. He served as [[President of the Continental Congress|president]] of the [[Second Continental Congress]] and was the [[List of Governors of Massachusetts|first and third]] [[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] of the [[Massachusetts|Commonwealth of Massachusetts]]. He is remembered for his large and stylish signature on the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], so much so that the term ''John Hancock'' has become a synonym in the United States for one's signature.&lt;ref name="Unger2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harlow G. Unger|title=John Hancock: Merchant King and American Patriot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=guF2AAAAMAAJ|date=21 September 2000|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-33209-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the American Revolution, Hancock was one of the wealthiest men in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], having inherited a profitable mercantile business from his uncle. He began his political career in [[Boston]] as a protégé of [[Samuel Adams]], an influential local politician, though the two men later became estranged. Hancock used his wealth to support the colonial cause as tensions increased between colonists and [[Great Britain]] in the 1760s. He became very popular in [[Massachusetts]], especially after British officials seized his sloop ''[[HMS Liberty (1768)|Liberty]]'' in 1768 and charged him with [[smuggling]]. Those charges were eventually dropped; he has often been described as a smuggler in historical accounts, but the accuracy of this characterization has been questioned.

Hancock was one of Boston's leaders during the crisis that led to the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1775. He served more than two years in the Continental Congress in [[Philadelphia]], and he was the first to sign the Declaration of Independence in his position as president of Congress. He returned to Massachusetts and was elected governor of the Commonwealth, serving in that role for most of his remaining years. He used his influence to ensure that Massachusetts ratified the [[United States Constitution]] in 1788.

==Early life==
[[File:Coat of Arms of John Hancock.svg|175px|thumb|left|Coat of Arms of John Hancock]]
John Hancock was born on January 23, 1737{{sfn|Allan|1948|pp=22, 372n48|ps=. The date was January 12, 1736 according to the [[Julian calendar]] then in use. Not all sources fully convert his birth date to the New Style, and so the date is also given as January 12, 1736 (Old Style), January 12, 1737 (partial conversion), or January 12, 1736/7 (dual dating).}} in [[Braintree, Massachusetts]] in a part of town that eventually became the separate city of [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]].{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=22}} He was the son of [[John Hancock, Jr.|Col. John Hancock Jr.]] of Braintree and Mary Hawke Thaxter (widow of [[Samuel Thaxter]] Junior), who was from nearby [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]]. As a child, Hancock became a casual acquaintance of young [[John Adams]], whom the Reverend Hancock had baptized in 1735.{{sfn|Fowler |1980|p=8}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=14}} The Hancocks lived a comfortable life, and owned one slave to help with household work.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=8}}

After Hancock's father died in 1744, John was sent to live with his uncle and aunt, [[Thomas Hancock (merchant)|Thomas Hancock]] and Lydia (Henchman) Hancock. Thomas Hancock was the proprietor of a firm known as the House of Hancock, which imported manufactured goods from Britain and exported rum, whale oil, and fish.{{sfn|Fowler|2000b}} Thomas Hancock's highly successful business made him one of Boston's richest and best-known residents.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=11–14}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=16}} He and Lydia, along with several servants and slaves, lived in [[Hancock Manor]] on [[Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts|Beacon Hill]]. The couple, who did not have any children of their own, became the dominant influence on John's life.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=18}}

After graduating from the [[Boston Latin School]] in 1750, Hancock enrolled in [[Harvard University|Harvard College]] and received a bachelor's degree in 1754.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=31}}{{sfn|Allan|1948|pp=32–41}} Upon graduation, he began to work for his uncle, just as the [[French and Indian War]] (1754–1763) had begun. Thomas Hancock had close relations with the [[List of colonial governors of Massachusetts|royal governors of Massachusetts]] and secured profitable government contracts during the war.{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=61}} John Hancock learned much about his uncle's business during these years and was trained for eventual partnership in the firm. Hancock worked hard, but he also enjoyed playing the role of a wealthy aristocrat and developed a fondness for expensive clothes.{{sfn|Allan|1948|pp=58–59}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=50}}

From 1760 to 1761, Hancock lived in England while building relationships with customers and suppliers. Upon returning to Boston, Hancock gradually took over the House of Hancock as his uncle's health failed, becoming a full partner in January 1763.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=46}}{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=74}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=63}} He became a member of the [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] Lodge of St. Andrew in October 1762, which connected him with many of Boston's most influential citizens.{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=85}} When Thomas Hancock died in August 1764, John inherited the business, Hancock Manor, two or three household slaves, and thousands of acres of land, becoming one of the wealthiest men in the colonies.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=48–59}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|pp=66–68}} The household slaves continued to work for John and his aunt, but were eventually freed through the terms of Thomas Hancock's will; there is no evidence that John Hancock ever bought or sold slaves.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=78}}

==Growing imperial tensions==

After its [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|victory in the Seven Years' War]] (1756–1763), the [[British Empire]] was deeply in debt. Looking for new sources of revenue, the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] sought, for the first time, to directly tax the colonies, beginning with the [[Sugar Act]] of 1764.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=53}} The earlier [[Molasses Act|Molasses Act of 1733]], a tax on shipments from the West Indies, had produced hardly any revenue because it was widely bypassed by smuggling, which was seen as a [[victimless crime]].

Not only was there little social stigma attached to smuggling in the colonies, but in port cities, where trade was the primary generator of wealth, smuggling enjoyed considerable community support, and it was even possible to obtain insurance against being caught. Colonial merchants developed an impressive repertoire of evasive maneuvers to conceal the origin, nationality, routes and content of their illicit cargoes. This included the frequent use of fraudulent paperwork to make the cargo appear legal and authorised. And much to the frustration of the British authorities, when seizures did happen local merchants were often able to use sympathetic provincial courts to reclaim confiscated goods and have their cases dismissed. For instance, Edward Randolph, the appointed head of customs in New England, brought 36 seizures to trial from 1680 to the end of 1682 – and all but two of these were acquitted. Alternatively merchants sometimes took matters into their own hands and stole illicit goods back while impounded.&lt;ref&gt;Smuggler Nation, Page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sugar Act provoked outrage in Boston, where it was widely viewed as a violation of colonial rights. Men such as [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]] and [[Samuel Adams]] argued that because the colonists were not represented in Parliament, they [[no taxation without representation|could not be taxed]] by that body; only the colonial assemblies, where the colonists were represented, could levy taxes upon the colonies. Hancock was not yet a political activist; however, he criticized the tax for economic, rather than constitutional, reasons.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=53}}

[[File:J S Copley - Samuel Adams.jpg|thumb|Around 1772, Hancock commissioned John Singleton Copley to paint this portrait of Samuel Adams, Hancock's early political mentor.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=153}}|alt=A stern middle-aged man with gray hair and wearing a dark red suit. He is standing behind a table, holding a rolled up document in one hand, and pointing with the other hand to a large document on the table.]]

Hancock emerged as a leading political figure in Boston just as tensions with Great Britain were increasing. In March 1765, he was elected as one of Boston's five [[Boston Board of Selectmen|selectmen]], an office previously held by his uncle for many years.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=55}} Soon after, Parliament passed the [[Stamp Act 1765|1765 Stamp Act]], a tax on legal documents, such as wills, that had been levied in Britain for many years but which was wildly unpopular in the colonies, producing riots and organized resistance. Hancock initially took a moderate position: as a loyal [[British subject]], he thought that the colonists should submit to the act, even though he believed that Parliament was misguided.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=56}} Within a few months, Hancock had changed his mind, although he continued to disapprove of violence and the intimidation of royal officials by mobs.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=58–60}} Hancock joined the resistance to the Stamp Act by participating in a boycott of British goods, which made him popular in Boston. After Bostonians learned of the impending repeal of the Stamp Act, Hancock was elected to the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] in May 1766.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=63–64}}

Hancock's political success benefited from the support of Samuel Adams, the clerk of the House of Representatives and a leader of Boston's "popular party", also known as "Whigs" and later as "[[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]]". The two men made an unlikely pair. Fifteen years older than Hancock, Adams had a somber, [[Puritan]] outlook that stood in marked contrast to Hancock's taste for luxury and extravagance.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=109}}{{sfn|Fowler|1997|p=76}} Apocryphal stories later portrayed Adams as masterminding Hancock's political rise so that the merchant's wealth could be used to further the Whig agenda.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=64}} Historian [[James Truslow Adams]] portrayed Hancock as shallow and vain, easily manipulated by Adams.{{sfn|Adams|1930|p=428}} Historian [[William M. Fowler]], who wrote biographies of both men, argued that this characterization was an exaggeration, and that the relationship between the two was symbiotic, with Adams as the mentor and Hancock the protégé.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=64–65}}{{sfn|Fowler|1997| p=73}}

==Townshend Acts crisis==

After the repeal of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a different approach to raising revenue, passing the 1767 [[Townshend Acts]], which established new [[duty (economics)|duties]] on various imports and strengthened the [[customs]] agency by creating the American Customs Board. The British government believed that a more efficient customs system was necessary because many colonial American merchants had been [[smuggling]]. Smugglers violated the [[Navigation Acts]] by trading with ports outside of the British Empire and avoiding import taxes. Parliament hoped that the new system would reduce smuggling and generate revenue for the government.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=71–72}}

Colonial merchants, even those not involved in smuggling, found the new regulations oppressive. Other colonists protested that new duties were another attempt by Parliament to tax the colonies without their consent. Hancock joined other Bostonians in calling for a boycott of British imports until the Townshend duties were repealed.{{sfn|Tyler|1986|p=111–14}} {{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=73}} In their enforcement of the customs regulations, the Customs Board targeted Hancock, Boston's wealthiest Whig. They may have suspected that he was a smuggler, or they may have wanted to harass him because of his politics, especially after Hancock snubbed Governor [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet|Francis Bernard]] by refusing to attend public functions when the customs officials were present.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=82}}{{sfn|Dickerson|1946|pp=527–28}}

On April 9, 1768, two customs employees (called ''tidesmen'') boarded Hancock's brig ''Lydia'' in [[Boston Harbor]]. Hancock was summoned, and finding that the agents lacked a [[writ of assistance]] (a general search warrant), he did not allow them to go below deck. When one of them later managed to get into the hold, Hancock's men forced the tidesman back on deck.{{sfn|Dickerson|1946|p=530}}{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=103a}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=118}}&lt;ref&gt;The exact details and sequence of events in the ''Lydia'' affair varies slightly in these accounts.&lt;/ref&gt; Customs officials wanted to file charges, but the case was dropped when [[Massachusetts Attorney General]] [[Jonathan Sewall]] ruled that Hancock had broken no laws.{{sfn|Dickerson|1946|pp=530–31}}{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=82}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|pp=118–19}} Later, some of Hancock's most ardent admirers would call this incident the first act of physical resistance to British authority in the colonies and credit Hancock with initiating the [[American Revolution]].{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=103b|ps=; Allan does not fully endorse this view.}}

===''Liberty'' affair===

The next incident proved to be a major event in the coming of the American Revolution. On the evening of May 9, 1768, Hancock's sloop [[HMS Liberty (1768)|''Liberty'']] arrived in Boston Harbor, carrying a shipment of [[Madeira wine]]. When custom officers inspected the ship the next morning, they found that it contained 25 [[Butt (unit)|pipes]] of wine, just one fourth of the ship's carrying capacity.{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=119}}{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=84}}{{sfn|Dickerson|1946|p=525}} Hancock paid the duties on the 25 pipes of wine, but officials suspected that he had arranged to have more wine unloaded during the night to avoid paying the duties for the entire cargo.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=84}}{{sfn|Wroth|Zobel|1965|p=174}} They did not have any evidence to prove this, however, since the two tidesmen who had stayed on the ship overnight gave a sworn statement that nothing had been unloaded.{{sfn|Dickerson|1946|pp=521–22}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=119}}

One month later, while the British warship [[HMS Romney (1762)|HMS ''Romney'']] was in port, one of the tidesmen changed his story: he now claimed that he had been forcibly held on the ''Liberty'' while it had been illegally unloaded.{{sfn|Dickerson|1946|p=522}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=120}}{{sfn|Wroth|Zobel|1965|p=175}} On June 10, customs officials seized the ''Liberty''. Bostonians were already angry because the captain of the ''Romney'' had been [[impressment|impressing]] colonists, and not just deserters from the Royal Navy, an arguably illegal activity.{{sfn|Knollenberg|1975|p=63}} A riot broke out when officials began to tow the ''Liberty'' out to the ''Romney'', which was also arguably illegal.{{sfn|Knollenberg|1975|p=64}}{{sfn|Reid|1979|p=91}} The confrontation escalated when sailors and marines coming ashore to seize the ''Liberty'' were mistaken for a press gang.{{sfn|Reid|1979|pp=92–93}} After the riot, customs officials relocated to the ''Romney'', and then to [[Fort Independence (Massachusetts)|Castle William]] (an island fort in the harbor), claiming that they were unsafe in town.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=85}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=120}} Whigs insisted that the customs officials were exaggerating the danger so that London would send troops to Boston.{{sfn|Reid|1979|pp=104–20}}

British officials filed two lawsuits stemming from the ''Liberty'' incident: an ''[[in rem]]'' suit against the ship, and an ''[[in personam]]'' suit against Hancock. Royal officials, as well as Hancock's accuser, stood to gain financially, since, as was the custom, any penalties assessed by the court would be awarded to the governor, the informer, and the Crown, each getting a third.{{sfn|Wroth|Zobel|1965|p=186}} The first suit, filed on June 22, 1768, resulted in the confiscation of the ''Liberty'' in August. Customs officials then used the ship to enforce trade regulations until it was burned by angry colonists in [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] the following year.{{sfn|Wroth|Zobel|1965|pp=179–80}}{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=90}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=124}}

The second trial began in October 1768, when charges were filed against Hancock and five others for allegedly unloading 100 pipes of wine from the ''Liberty'' without paying the duties.{{sfn|Dickerson|1946|p= 534}}{{sfn|Wroth|Zobel|1965|p=180–81}} If convicted, the defendants would have had to pay a penalty of triple the value of the wine, which came to [[pound sterling|£]]9,000. With John Adams serving as his lawyer, Hancock was prosecuted in a highly publicized trial by a [[vice admiralty court]], which had no jury and did not always allow the defense to cross-examine the witnesses.{{sfn|Dickerson|1946|pp=535–36}} After dragging out for nearly five months, the proceedings against Hancock were dropped without explanation.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=100}}{{sfn|Dickerson|1946|p=539}}{{sfn|Wroth|Zobel|1965|p=183}}

Although the charges against Hancock were dropped, many writers later described him as a smuggler.{{sfn|Dickerson|1946|p=517}} The accuracy of this characterization has been questioned. "Hancock's guilt or innocence and the exact charges against him", wrote historian John W. Tyler in 1986, "are still fiercely debated."{{sfn|Tyler|1986|p=114}} Historian Oliver Dickerson argued that Hancock was the victim of an essentially criminal [[racketeering]] scheme perpetrated by Governor Bernard and the customs officials. Dickerson believed that there is no reliable evidence that Hancock was guilty in the ''Liberty'' case, and that the purpose of the trials was to punish Hancock for political reasons and to plunder his property.{{sfn|Dickerson|1946|pp=518–25}} Opposed to Dickerson's interpretation were Kinvin Wroth and Hiller Zobel, the editors of John Adams's legal papers, who argued that "Hancock's innocence is open to question", and that the British officials acted legally, if unwisely.{{sfn|Wroth|Zobel|1965|pp=185–89|ps=, quote from p. 185.}} Lawyer and historian Bernard Knollenberg concluded that the customs officials had the right to seize Hancock's ship, but towing it out to the ''Romney'' had been illegal.{{sfn|Knollenberg|1975|pp=65–66, 320n41, 321n48}} Legal historian John Phillip Reid argued that the testimony of both sides was so politically partial that it is not possible to objectively reconstruct the incident.{{sfn|Reid|1979|pp=127–30}}

Aside from the ''Liberty'' affair, the degree to which Hancock was engaged in smuggling, which may have been widespread in the colonies, has been questioned. Given the clandestine nature of smuggling, records are scarce.{{sfn|Tyler|1986|p=13}} If Hancock was a smuggler, no documentation of this has been found. John W. Tyler identified 23 smugglers in his study of more than 400 merchants in revolutionary Boston, but found no written evidence that Hancock was one of them.{{sfn|Tyler|1986|pp=5, 16, 266}} Biographer William Fowler concluded that while Hancock was probably engaged in some smuggling, most of his business was legitimate, and his later reputation as the "king of the colonial smugglers" is a myth without foundation.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=82}}

==Massacre to Tea Party==

[[File:Boston 1768 edit.jpeg|thumb|Paul Revere's 1768 engraving of British troops arriving in Boston was reprinted throughout the colonies.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=95–96}}|alt=A wide view of a port town with several wharves.

The ''Liberty'' affair reinforced a previously made British decision to suppress unrest in Boston with a show of military might. The decision had been prompted by Samuel Adams's 1768 [[Massachusetts Circular Letter|Circular Letter]], which was sent to other [[British America]]n colonies in hopes of coordinating resistance to the Townshend Acts. [[Wills Hill, 1st Marquess of Downshire|Lord Hillsborough]], secretary of state for the colonies, sent four regiments of the British Army to Boston to support embattled royal officials, and instructed Governor Bernard to order the Massachusetts legislature to revoke the Circular Letter. Hancock and the Massachusetts House voted against rescinding the letter, and instead drew up a petition demanding Governor Bernard's recall.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=86–87}} When Bernard returned to England in 1769, Bostonians celebrated.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=112}}{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=109}}

The British troops remained, however, and tensions between soldiers and civilians eventually resulted in the killing of five civilians in the [[Boston Massacre]] of March 1770. Hancock was not involved in the incident, but afterwards he led a committee to demand the removal of the troops. Meeting with Bernard's successor, Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]], and the British officer in command, Colonel [[William Dalrymple (general)|William Dalrymple]], Hancock claimed that there were 10,000 armed colonists ready to march into Boston if the troops did not leave.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=124}}{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=120}} Hutchinson knew that Hancock was bluffing, but the soldiers were in a precarious position when garrisoned within the town, and so Dalrymple agreed to remove both regiments to Castle William.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=124}} Hancock was celebrated as a hero for his role in getting the troops withdrawn.{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=145}}{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=120}} His reelection to the Massachusetts House in May was nearly unanimous.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=131}}{{sfn|Brown|1955|p=271}}

[[File:Hancock mezzotint.jpg|thumb|left|This portrait of Hancock was published in England in 1775.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=following 176}}]]

After Parliament partially repealed the Townshend duties in 1770, Boston's boycott of British goods ended.{{sfn|Tyler|1986|p=140}} Politics became quieter in Massachusetts, although tensions remained.{{sfn|Brown|1955|p=268–69}} Hancock tried to improve his relationship with Governor Hutchinson, who in turn sought to woo Hancock away from Adams's influence.{{sfn|Brown|1955|pp=289–90}}{{sfn|Brown|1970|p=61n7}} In April 1772, Hutchinson approved Hancock's election as colonel of the [[Boston Cadets]], a militia unit whose primary function was to provide a ceremonial escort for the governor and the General Court.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=136}}{{sfn|Allan|1948|pp=124–27}} In May, Hutchinson even approved Hancock's election to the [[Massachusetts Governor's Council|Council]], the upper chamber of the General Court, whose members were elected by the House but subject to veto by the governor. Hancock's previous elections to the Council had been vetoed, but now Hutchinson allowed the election to stand. Hancock declined the office, however, not wanting to appear to have been co-opted by the governor. Nevertheless, Hancock used the improved relationship to resolve an ongoing dispute. To avoid hostile crowds in Boston, Hutchinson had been convening the legislature outside of town; now he agreed to allow the General Court to sit in Boston once again, to the relief of the legislators.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=136–42}}

Hutchinson had dared to hope that he could win over Hancock and discredit Adams.{{sfn|Brown|1955|p=285}} To some, it seemed that Adams and Hancock were indeed at odds: when Adams formed the Boston [[Committee of correspondence|Committee of Correspondence]] in November 1772 to advocate colonial rights, Hancock declined to join, creating the impression that there was a split in the Whig ranks.{{sfn|Brown|1970|pp=57–60}} But whatever their differences, Hancock and Adams came together again in 1773 with the renewal of major political turmoil. They cooperated in the revelation of [[Hutchinson Letters Affair|private letters]] of Thomas Hutchinson, in which the governor seemed to recommend "an abridgement of what are called English liberties" to bring order to the colony.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=150–52}} The Massachusetts House, blaming Hutchinson for the military occupation of Boston, called for his removal as governor.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=152}}

Even more trouble followed Parliament's passage of the 1773 [[Tea Act]]. On November 5, Hancock was elected as moderator at a Boston town meeting that resolved that anyone who supported the Tea Act was an "Enemy to America".{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=156–57}} Hancock and others tried to force the resignation of the agents who had been appointed to receive the tea shipments. Unsuccessful in this, they attempted to prevent the tea from being unloaded after three tea ships had arrived in Boston Harbor. Hancock was at the fateful meeting on December 16, where he reportedly told the crowd, "Let every man do what is right in his own eyes."{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=161}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=169}} Hancock did not take part in the [[Boston Tea Party]] that night, but he approved of the action, although he was careful not to publicly praise the destruction of private property.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=159–62}}

Over the next few months, Hancock was disabled by [[gout]], which would trouble him with increasing frequency in the coming years. By March 5, 1774, he had recovered enough to deliver the fourth annual [[Massacre Day]] oration, a commemoration of the Boston Massacre. Hancock's speech denounced the presence of British troops in Boston, who he said had been sent there "to enforce obedience to acts of Parliament, which neither God nor man ever empowered them to make".{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=163}} The speech, probably written by Hancock in collaboration with Adams, [[Joseph Warren]], and others, was published and widely reprinted, enhancing Hancock's stature as a leading Patriot.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=165–66}}

==Revolution begins==

Parliament responded to the Tea Party with the [[Boston Port Act]], one of the so-called [[Coercive Acts]] intended to strengthen British control of the colonies. Hutchinson was replaced as governor by General [[Thomas Gage]], who arrived in May 1774. On June 17, the Massachusetts House elected five delegates to send to the [[First Continental Congress]] in [[Philadelphia]], which was being organized to coordinate colonial response to the Coercive Acts. Hancock did not serve in the first Congress, possibly for health reasons, or possibly to remain in charge while the other Patriot leaders were away.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=176}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=181}}

Gage soon dismissed Hancock from his post as colonel of the Boston Cadets.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=174}} In October 1774, Gage canceled the scheduled meeting of the General Court. In response, the House resolved itself into the [[Massachusetts Provincial Congress]], a body independent of British control. Hancock was elected as president of the Provincial Congress and was a key member of the [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]].{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=177}} The Provincial Congress created the first [[minutemen]] companies, consisting of militiamen who were to be ready for action on a moment's notice.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=177}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=185}}

On December 1, 1774, the Provincial Congress elected Hancock as a delegate to the [[Second Continental Congress]] to replace [[James Bowdoin]], who had been unable to attend the first Congress because of illness.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=177}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=187}} Before Hancock reported to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, the Provincial Congress unanimously reelected him as their president in February 1775. Hancock's multiple roles gave him enormous influence in Massachusetts, and as early as January 1774 British officials had considered arresting him.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=179}} After attending the Provincial Congress in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] in April 1775, Hancock and Samuel Adams decided that it was not safe to return to Boston before leaving for Philadelphia. They stayed instead at [[Hancock-Clarke House|Hancock's childhood home]] in [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]].{{sfn|Fischer|1994|pp=94, 108}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=190}}

Gage received a letter from [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth|Lord Dartmouth]] on April 14, 1775, advising him "to arrest the principal actors and abettors in the Provincial Congress whose proceedings appear in every light to be acts of treason and rebellion".{{sfn|Fischer|1994|p=76}}{{sfn|Alden|1944| p=451}}{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=181}} On the night of April 18, Gage sent out a detachment of soldiers on the fateful mission that would spark the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The purpose of the British expedition was to seize and destroy military supplies that the colonists had stored in Concord. According to many historical accounts, Gage also instructed his men to arrest Hancock and Adams; if so, the written orders issued by Gage made no mention of arresting the Patriot leaders.{{sfn|Alden|1944|p=453}} Gage apparently decided that he had nothing to gain by arresting Hancock and Adams, since other leaders would simply take their place, and the British would be portrayed as the aggressors.{{sfn|Alden|1944|p=452}}{{sfn|Fischer|1994|p=85}}

Although Gage had evidently decided against seizing Hancock and Adams, Patriots initially believed otherwise. From Boston, Joseph Warren dispatched messenger [[Paul Revere]] to warn Hancock and Adams that British troops were on the move and might attempt to arrest them. Revere reached Lexington around midnight and gave the warning.{{sfn|Fischer|1994|p=110}}{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=183}} Hancock, still considering himself a militia colonel, wanted to take the field with the Patriot militia at Lexington, but Adams and others convinced him to avoid battle, arguing that he was more valuable as a political leader than as a soldier.{{sfn|Fischer|1994|pp=177–78}}{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=184}} As Hancock and Adams made their escape, the first shots of the war were fired at [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]]. Soon after the battle, Gage issued a proclamation granting a general pardon to all who would "lay down their arms, and return to the duties of peaceable subjects"—with the exceptions of Hancock and Samuel Adams. Singling out Hancock and Adams in this manner only added to their renown among Patriots.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=193|ps=.

==President of Congress==

[[File:Dorothy Quincy Hancock.jpg|thumb|Dorothy Quincy, by [[John Singleton Copley]], c. 1772]]

With the war underway, Hancock made his way to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia with the other Massachusetts delegates. On May 24, 1775, he was unanimously elected [[President of the Continental Congress]], succeeding [[Peyton Randolph]] after [[Henry Middleton]] declined the nomination. Hancock was a good choice for president for several reasons.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=190}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=206}} He was experienced, having often presided over legislative bodies and town meetings in Massachusetts. His wealth and social standing inspired the confidence of moderate delegates, while his association with Boston radicals made him acceptable to other radicals. His position was somewhat ambiguous, because the role of the president was not fully defined, and it was not clear if Randolph had resigned or was on a leave of absence.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=191}} Like other presidents of Congress, Hancock's authority was mostly limited to that of a presiding officer.{{sfn|Fowler|2000a}} He also had to handle a great deal of official correspondence, and he found it necessary to hire clerks at his own expense to help with the paperwork.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=205}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=237}}

In Congress on June 15, 1775, Massachusetts delegate [[John Adams]] nominated [[George Washington]] as commander-in-chief of the army then gathered around Boston. Years later, Adams wrote that Hancock had shown great disappointment at not getting the command for himself. This brief comment from 1801 is the only source for the oft-cited claim that Hancock sought to become commander-in-chief.{{sfn|Proctor|1977|p=669}} In the early 20th century, historian [[James Truslow Adams]] wrote that the incident initiated a lifelong estrangement between Hancock and Washington, but some subsequent historians have expressed doubt that the incident, or the estrangement, ever occurred. According to historian Donald Proctor, "There is no contemporary evidence that Hancock harbored ambitions to be named commander-in-chief. Quite the contrary."{{sfn|Proctor|1977|p=670}} Hancock and Washington maintained a good relationship after the alleged incident, and in 1778 Hancock named his only son ''John George Washington Hancock''.{{sfn|Proctor|1977|p=675}} Hancock admired and supported General Washington, even though Washington politely declined Hancock's request for a military appointment.{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=215}}{{sfn|Proctor|1977|p=672}}

When Congress recessed on August 1, 1775, Hancock took the opportunity to wed his fiancée, [[Dorothy Quincy|Dorothy "Dolly" Quincy]]. The couple was married on August 28 in [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]], [[Connecticut]].{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=197}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=218}} John and Dorothy would have two children, neither of whom survived to adulthood. Their daughter Lydia Henchman Hancock was born in 1776 and died ten months later.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=214, 218}} Their son John was born in 1778 and died in 1787 after suffering a head injury while ice skating.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=229, 265}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=309}}

While president of Congress, Hancock became involved in a long-running controversy with Harvard. As treasurer of the college since 1773, he had been entrusted with the school's financial records and about £15,000 in cash and securities.{{sfn|Proctor|1977|p=661}}{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=214}} In the rush of events at the onset of the Revolutionary War, Hancock had been unable to return the money and accounts to Harvard before leaving for Congress.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=214}} In 1777, a Harvard committee headed by [[James Bowdoin]], Hancock's chief political and social rival in Boston, sent a messenger to Philadelphia to retrieve the money and records.{{sfn|Manuel|Manuel|2004|pp=142–42}} Hancock was offended, but he turned over more than £16,000, though not all of the records, to the college.{{sfn|Proctor|1977|p=662}}{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=215–16}}{{sfn|Manuel|Manuel|2004|p=143}} When Harvard replaced Hancock as treasurer, his ego was bruised, and for years he declined to settle the account or pay the interest on the money he had held, despite pressure put on him by Bowdoin and other political opponents.{{sfn|Manuel|Manuel|2004|pp=144–45}}{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=262–63}} The issue dragged on until after Hancock's death, when his estate finally paid the college more than £1,000 to resolve the matter.{{sfn|Manuel|Manuel|2004|pp=144–45}}{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=262–63}}

Hancock served in Congress through some of the darkest days of the Revolutionary War. The British drove Washington from [[New York and New Jersey campaign|New York and New Jersey]] in 1776, which prompted Congress to flee to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=248}} Hancock and Congress returned to Philadelphia in March 1777, but were compelled to flee six months later when the British [[Philadelphia campaign|occupied Philadelphia]].{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=255}} Hancock wrote innumerable letters to colonial officials, raising money, supplies, and troops for Washington's army.{{sfn|Unger|2000|pp=216–22}} He chaired the Marine Committee, and took pride in helping to create a small fleet of American frigates, including the [[USS Hancock (1776)|USS ''Hancock'']], which was named in his honor.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=198–99}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=245}}

===Signing the Declaration===

Hancock was president of Congress when the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] was adopted and signed. He is primarily remembered by Americans for his large, flamboyant signature on the Declaration, so much so that "John Hancock" became, in the United States, an informal synonym for ''signature''.{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=vii|ps=. See also [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/John%20Hancock Merriam-Webster online] and [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/john%20hancock Dictionary.com]}} According to legend, Hancock signed his name largely and clearly so that [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George]] could read it without his spectacles, but the story is apocryphal and originated years later.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=213}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=241|ps=.

[[File:JohnHancockSignature.jpg|thumb|left|Hancock's signature as it appears on the engrossed copy of the Declaration of Independence|alt=The handwriting of John Hancock's stylish signature, which slants slightly to the right, is firm and legible. The final letter loops back to underline his name in a flourish.]]

Contrary to popular mythology, there was no ceremonial signing of the Declaration on July 4, 1776.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=213}} After Congress approved the wording of the text on July 4, the ''fair copy'' was sent to be printed. As president, Hancock may have signed the document that was sent to the printer [[John Dunlap]], but this is uncertain because that document is lost, perhaps destroyed in the printing process.{{sfn|Boyd|1976|p=450}} Dunlap produced the first published version of the Declaration, the widely distributed [[Dunlap broadside]]. Hancock, as President of Congress, was the only delegate whose name appeared on the broadside, although the name of [[Charles Thomson]], secretary of the Continental Congress, but not a delegate, was also on it as "Attested by" implying that Hancock had signed the fair copy. This meant that until a [[Goddard Broadside|second broadside]] was issued six months later with all of the signers listed, Hancock was the only delegate whose name was publicly attached to the treasonous document.{{sfn|Allan|1948|pp=230–31}} Hancock sent a copy of the Dunlap broadside to George Washington, instructing him to have it read to the troops "in the way you shall think most proper".{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=242}}

Hancock's name was printed, not signed, on the Dunlap broadside; his iconic signature appears on a different document—a sheet of parchment that was carefully handwritten sometime after July 19 and signed on August 2 by Hancock and those delegates present.{{sfn|Boyd|1976|pp=464–65}} Known as the engrossed copy, this is the famous document on display at the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration.html|title=Declaration of Independence|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|accessdate=November 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to Massachusetts==

Most are focused on the five men standing in the center of the room.

In October 1777, after more than two years in Congress, President Hancock requested a leave of absence.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=219}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=256}} He asked George Washington to arrange a military escort for his return to Boston. Although Washington was short on manpower, he nevertheless sent fifteen horsemen to accompany Hancock on his journey home.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=220}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|pp=256–57}} By this time Hancock had become estranged from Samuel Adams, who disapproved of what he viewed as Hancock's vanity and extravagance, which Adams believed were inappropriate in a [[Republicanism in the United States|republican]] leader. When Congress voted to thank Hancock for his service, Adams and the other Massachusetts delegates voted against the resolution, as did a few delegates from other states.{{sfn|Fowler|2000a}}{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=207, 220, 230}}

Back in Boston, Hancock was reelected to the House of Representatives. As in previous years, his philanthropy made him popular. Although his finances had suffered greatly because of the war, he gave to the poor, helped support widows and orphans, and loaned money to friends. According to biographer William Fowler, "John Hancock was a generous man and the people loved him for it. He was their idol."{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=225–26}} In December 1777, he was reelected as a delegate to the Continental Congress and as moderator of the Boston town meeting.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=225}}
[[File:Hancock House, Ticonderoga, NY.jpg|thumb|left|This replica of the [[Hancock House (Ticonderoga, New York)|Hancock House]] in Boston was built in Ticonderoga, New York by the Ticonderoga Historical Society and is open as a museum.]]

Hancock rejoined the Continental Congress in Pennsylvania in June 1778, but his brief time there was unhappy. In his absence, Congress had elected [[Henry Laurens]] as its new president, which was a disappointment to Hancock, who had hoped to reclaim his chair. Hancock got along poorly with Samuel Adams, and missed his wife and newborn son.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=230–31}} On July 9, 1778, Hancock and the other Massachusetts delegates joined the representatives from seven other states in signing the [[Articles of Confederation]]; the remaining states were not yet prepared to sign, and the Articles would not be ratified until 1781.{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=270}}

Hancock returned to Boston in July 1778, motivated by the opportunity to finally lead men in combat. Back in 1776, he had been appointed as the senior major general of the Massachusetts militia.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=207}} Now that the French fleet had come to the aid of the Americans, General Washington instructed General [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]] of the Continental Army to lead an [[Battle of Rhode Island|attack on the British garrison]] at [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Rhode Island]], in August 1778. Hancock nominally commanded 6,000 militiamen in the campaign, although he let the professional soldiers do the planning and issue the orders. It was a fiasco: French Admiral [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|d'Estaing]] abandoned the operation, after which Hancock's militia mostly deserted Sullivan's Continentals.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=232–34}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|pp=270–73}} Hancock suffered some criticism for the debacle but emerged from his brief military career with his popularity intact.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=234–35}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|pp=274–75}} He was a charter member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1780.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Charter of Incorporation of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences|url=https://www.amacad.org/content/about/about.aspx?d=23|website=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After much delay, the new [[Massachusetts Constitution]] finally went into effect in October 1780. To no one's surprise, Hancock was elected [[Governor of Massachusetts]] in a landslide, garnering over 90% of the vote.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=243–44}} In the absence of formal party politics, the contest was one of personality, popularity, and patriotism. Hancock was immensely popular and unquestionably patriotic given his personal sacrifices and his leadership of the [[Second Continental Congress]]. [[James Bowdoin]], his principal opponent, was cast by Hancock's supporters as unpatriotic, citing among other things his refusal (which was due to poor health) to serve in the First Continental Congress.{{sfn|Morse|1909|pp=21–22}} Bowdoin's supporters, who were principally well-off commercial interests from Massachusetts coastal communities, cast Hancock as a foppish demagogue who pandered to the populace.{{sfn|Hall|1972|p=134}}

Hancock governed Massachusetts through the end of the Revolutionary War and into an economically troubled postwar period, repeatedly winning reelection by wide margins. Hancock took a hands-off approach to governing, avoiding controversial issues as much as possible. According to William Fowler, Hancock "never really led" and "never used his strength to deal with the critical issues confronting the commonwealth."{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=246–47, 255}} Hancock governed until his surprise resignation on January 29, 1785. Hancock cited his failing health as the reason, but he may have become aware of growing unrest in the countryside and wanted to get out of office before the trouble came.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=258–59}} Hancock's critics sometimes believed that he used claims of illness to avoid difficult political situations.{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=222}} Historian James Truslow Adams wrote that Hancock's "two chief resources were his money and his gout, the first always used to gain popularity, and the second to prevent his losing it".{{sfn|Adams|1930|p=430}} The turmoil that Hancock avoided ultimately blossomed as [[Shays's Rebellion]], which Hancock's successor James Bowdoin had to deal with. After the uprising, Hancock was reelected in 1787, and he promptly pardoned all the rebels.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=265–66}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=311}} Hancock was reelected to annual terms as governor for the remainder of his life.{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=xvi}}

==Final years==

[[File:HancockGrave.jpg|thumb|Hancock's memorial in Boston's [[Granary Burying Ground]], dedicated in 1896{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=viii}}]]

When he had resigned as governor in 1785, Hancock was again elected as a delegate to the Continental Congress, known as the [[Congress of the Confederation|Confederation Congress]] after the ratification of the Articles of Confederation in 1781. Congress had declined in importance after the Revolutionary War, and was frequently ignored by the states. Congress elected Hancock to serve as its president, but he never attended because of his poor health and because he was not interested. He sent Congress a letter of resignation in 1786.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=264}}

In an effort to remedy the perceived defects of the Articles of Confederation, delegates were first sent to the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]] in 1786 and then to the [[Philadelphia Convention]] in 1787, where they drafted the [[United States Constitution]], which was then sent to the states for ratification or rejection. Hancock, who was not present at the Philadelphia Convention, had misgivings about the new Constitution's lack of a bill of rights and its shift of power to a central government.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=267–69}} In January 1788, Hancock was elected president of the Massachusetts ratifying convention, although he was ill and not present when the convention began.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=268}} Hancock mostly remained silent during the contentious debates, but as the convention was drawing to close, he gave a speech in favor of ratification. For the first time in years, Samuel Adams supported Hancock's position.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=270}} Even with the support of Hancock and Adams, the Massachusetts convention narrowly ratified the Constitution by a vote of 187 to 168. Hancock's support was probably a deciding factor in the ratification.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=271}}{{sfn|Allan|1948|pp=331–32}}

Hancock was put forth as a candidate in the [[United States presidential election, 1789|1789 U. S. presidential election]]. As was the custom in an era where political ambition was viewed with suspicion, Hancock did not campaign or even publicly express interest in the office; he instead made his wishes known indirectly. Like everyone else, Hancock knew that George Washington was going to be elected as the first president, but Hancock may have been interested in being vice president, despite his poor health.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=274}} Hancock received only four electoral votes in the election, however, none of them from his home state; the Massachusetts electors all voted for another Massachusetts native, John Adams, who received the second-highest number of electoral votes and thus became vice president.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=275}} Although Hancock was disappointed with his performance in the election, he continued to be popular in Massachusetts.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=275}}

His health failing, Hancock spent his final few years as essentially a figurehead governor. With his wife at his side, he died in bed on October 8, 1793, at 56 years of age.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=279}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=330}} By order of acting governor Samuel Adams, the day of Hancock's burial was a state holiday; the lavish funeral was perhaps the grandest given to an American up to that time.{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=358}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=331}}

==Legacy==

Despite his grand funeral, Hancock faded from [[collective memory|popular memory]] after his death. According to historian [[Alfred F. Young]], "Boston celebrated only one hero in the half-century after the Revolution: George Washington."{{sfn|Young|1999|p=117}} As early as 1809, John Adams lamented that Hancock and Samuel Adams were "almost buried in oblivion".{{sfn|Young|1999|p=116}} In Boston, little effort was made to preserve Hancock's historical legacy. His house on Beacon Hill was torn down in 1863 after both the city of Boston and the Massachusetts legislature decided against maintaining it.{{sfn|Young|1999|p=120}} According to Young, the conservative "new elite" of Massachusetts "was not comfortable with a rich man who pledged his fortune to the cause of revolution".{{sfn|Young|1999|p=120}} In 1876, with the centennial of American independence renewing popular interest in the Revolution, plaques honoring Hancock were put up in Boston.{{sfn|Young|1999|p=191}} In 1896, a memorial column was finally erected over Hancock's essentially unmarked grave in the [[Granary Burying Ground]].{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=viii}}

No full-length biography of Hancock appeared until the 20th century. A challenge facing Hancock biographers is that, compared to prominent [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] like Jefferson and John Adams, Hancock left relatively few personal writings for historians to use in interpreting his life. As a result, most depictions of Hancock have relied on the voluminous writings of his political opponents, who were often scathingly critical of him. According to historian Charles Akers, "The chief victim of Massachusetts historiography has been John Hancock, the most gifted and popular politician in the Bay State's long history. He suffered the misfortune of being known to later generations almost entirely through the judgments of his detractors, Tory and Whig."{{sfn|Akers|1974|p=130}}

[[File:USS John Hancock Stern.jpg|thumb|275px|Hancock's famous signature on the stern of the destroyer [[USS John Hancock (DD-981)|USS ''John Hancock'']]]]

Hancock's most influential 20th-century detractor was historian [[James Truslow Adams]], who wrote negative portraits of Hancock in ''Harper's Magazine'' and the ''Dictionary of American Biography'' in the 1930s.{{sfn|Proctor|1977|p=654}} Adams argued that Hancock was a "fair presiding officer" but had "no great ability", and was prominent only because of his inherited wealth.{{sfn|Adams|1930|p=428}} Decades later, historian Donald Proctor argued that Adams had uncritically repeated the negative views of Hancock's political opponents without doing any serious research.{{sfn|Proctor|1977|p=676}} Adams "presented a series of disparaging incidents and anecdotes, sometimes partially documented, sometimes not documented at all, which in sum leave one with a distinctly unfavorable impression of Hancock".{{sfn|Proctor|1977|p=657}} According to Proctor, Adams evidently projected his own disapproval of 1920s businessmen onto Hancock,{{sfn|Proctor|1977|p=676}} and ended up misrepresenting several key events in Hancock's career.{{sfn|Proctor|1977|pp=658–75}} Writing in the 1970s, Proctor and Akers called for scholars to evaluate Hancock based on his merits, rather than on the views of his critics. Since that time, historians have usually presented a more favorable portrait of Hancock, while acknowledging that he was not an important writer, political theorist, or military leader.{{sfn|Nobles|1995|pp=268, 271}}

Many places and things in the United States have been named in honor of John Hancock. The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] has named vessels [[USS Hancock|USS ''Hancock'']] and [[USS John Hancock|USS ''John Hancock'']]; a World War II [[Liberty ship]] was also named in his honor.{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=355}} Ten states have a [[Hancock County (disambiguation)|Hancock County]] named for him;{{sfn|Gannett|1973|p=148}} other places named after him include [[Hancock, Massachusetts]]; [[Hancock, Michigan]]; [[Hancock, New Hampshire]]; [[Hancock (town), New York|Hancock, New York]]; and [[Mount Hancock (New Hampshire)|Mount Hancock]] in New Hampshire.{{sfn|Gannett|1973|p=148}} [[John Hancock University]] is named for him,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hancocku.edu/about-jhu/|title=About John Hancock University|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|work=|publisher=|accessdate=January 14, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203162539/http://www.hancocku.edu/about-jhu/|archivedate=February 3, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as was the [[John Hancock Financial]] company, founded in Boston in 1862; it had no connection to Hancock's own business ventures.{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=337}} The financial company passed on the name to the [[John Hancock Tower]] in Boston, the [[John Hancock Center]] in Chicago, as well as the [[John Hancock Student Village]] at [[Boston University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=T1sxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EqMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1784,159250|title=Firm not signing away its name|work=[[Reading Eagle]]| agency=Associated Press| date=October 1, 2003|page=D6|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Braunthal is best remembered as the Secretary of the [[Socialist International]] from 1951 to 1956 and for his massive three volume ''History of the International,'' first published in [[German language|German]] between 1961 and 1971.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Julius Braunthal was born in [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]] on 5 May 1891.&lt;ref name=JBlautFreeBMD/&gt;

During [[World War I]] Braunthal was an officer in the [[Austro-Hungarian army]], winning a decoration for valor and rising to the rank of [[lieutenant]] by the end of the war.&lt;ref name=Docherty&gt;James C. Docherty, "Julius Braunthal," in ''Historical Dictionary of Socialism.'' Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 1997; pg. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interwar period===

After the war Braunthal served as an Assistant Secretary of State for the newly established [[First Austrian Republic|Republic of Austria]] from 1918 to 1920.&lt;ref name=Docherty /&gt;

A committed [[socialism|socialist]], following his departure from government service Braunthal edited several socialist publications. In 1924 Braunthal was editor of the ''Arbeiter-Zeitung,'' the official organ of the [[Socialist Party of Austria]] (SPÖ). From 1927 to 1934 he served as editor of the popular socialist newspaper, ''Das Kleine Blatt'' (The Little Leaf), also published by the SPÖ. He also edited the illustrated magazine ''Der Kuckuck'' (The Cuckoo).

[[Austrofascism]] began to rise in the middle 1930s and Brauthal was soon embroiled with difficulties with the new right wing regime. In 1934 Braunthal was arrested and jailed, charged with [[treason]].&lt;ref name=IISH&gt;Emile Schwidder, [http://www.iisg.nl/archives/en/files/b/ARCH00111full.php "Biography,"] Julius Braunthal Papers finding aid. Amsterdam: International Institute of Social History, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; He was ultimately expelled from the country in 1935, narrowly escaping the annexation of Austria to [[Nazi Germany]] three years later.&lt;ref name=IISH /&gt;

In 1938, Braunthal went into exile in [[Great Britain]], where his elder sister [[Bertha Braunthal|Bertha Clark]] (1887-1967) had been living and working with her Scottish born husband since 1933,&lt;ref name=BBlautHDK&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/wer-war-wer-in-der-ddr-%2363%3b-1424.html?ID=4127
|title=Braunthal, Bertha  * 1.2.1887, † 1967|work=Handbuch der Deutschen Kommunisten|publisher=Karl Dietz Verlag, Berlin &amp; Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur, Berlin|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and where he would remain for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=Docherty /&gt;

Julius Braunthal was named an assistant secretary of the [[Labour and Socialist International]] in 1938, remaining in that capacity until the outbreak of [[World War II]].

===World War II and after===

During World War II, Braunthal was the editor of the journal of the Labour and Socialist International, ''International Socialist Forum.''&lt;ref name=Docherty /&gt; He would serve in that capacity until 1948.&lt;ref name=Docherty /&gt; Thereafter Braunthal was named as the Secretary of the [[International Socialist Conference]], a transitional organization which preceded establishment of the new [[Socialist International]]. In 1951 Braunthal was named the first Secretary General of this new international institution.&lt;ref name=Docherty /&gt; He would hold this post until 1956.&lt;ref name=Docherty /&gt;

Following the end of his time as the head of the Socialist International, Braunthal turned his attention to the writing of history. He authored a three volume ''History of the International,'' detailing the institutional development of international socialism from the [[First International]] until the present day. The first volume of this work was published in 1961, with the third and final volume seeing print in 1971.&lt;ref name=Docherty /&gt;

===Death and legacy===

Julius Braunthal died on 24 April 1972 in [[Teddington, England]]. He was 78 years old at the time of his death.

Braunthal's papers reside at the [[International Institute of Social History]] in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]].

'''Juvénal Habyarimana''' ({{IPA-rw|hɑbɟɑ̂ːɾimɑ̂ːnɑ|Kinyarwanda:}}; {{IPA-fr|ʒy.ve.nal a.bja.ʁi.ma.na|lang}}; March 8, 1937 &amp;ndash; April 6, 1994{{sfn|Akyeampong &amp; Gates|2012|pp=527–528}}) was the 2nd [[President of Rwanda|President]] of the [[Republic of Rwanda]], serving longer than any other president to date, from 1973 until 1994. He was nicknamed "Kinani", a [[Kinyarwanda]] word meaning "invincible".

Habyarimana was a [[dictator]], and electoral fraud was suspected for his unopposed re-elections:  98.99% of the vote on 24 December 1978, 99.97% of the vote on 19 December 1983, and 99.98% of the vote on 19 December 1988.&lt;ref name=wewish&gt;{{cite book|title=[[We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families]]|author=[[Philip Gourevitch]]|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his rule, Rwanda became a [[totalitarian]] order in which his [[National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development|MRND]]-party enforcers required people to chant and dance in adulation of the President at mass pageants of political "animation".&lt;ref name=wewish/&gt; While the country as a whole had become slightly less impoverished during Habyarimana's tenure, the great majority of Rwandans remained in circumstances of extreme poverty.&lt;ref name=wewish/&gt;

On April 6, 1994, he was killed when his aircraft, also carrying the [[President of Burundi|President]] of neighbouring [[Burundi]], [[Cyprien Ntaryamira]], was shot down close to [[Kigali]] [[Kigali International Airport|International Airport]]. His [[Assassination of Habyarimana and Ntaryamira|assassination]] ignited ethnic tensions in the region and helped spark the [[Rwandan genocide]].

== Early life and education ==
Juvénal Habyarimana was born on March 8, 1937 in [[Gisenyi]], [[Ruanda-Urundi]] to a wealthy [[Hutu]] family. After receiving a primary education, he attended the College of Saint Paul in [[Bukavu]], [[Belgian Congo]], where he graduated with a degree in mathematics and humanities. In 1958 he enrolled in [[Lovanium University]]'s medical school in [[Kinshasa|Léopoldville]]. After the beginning of the [[Rwandan Revolution]] the following year, Habyarimana left Lovanium and enrolled in the officer training school in [[Kigali]]. He graduated with distinction in 1961 and became an aide to the Belgian commander of the force in Rwanda.{{sfn|Akyeampong|Gates|2012|p=527}} He married [[Agathe Habyarimana|Agathe Kanziga]] in 1962.{{sfn|Akyeampong|Gates|2012|p=526}}

In 1963 Habyarimana, due to his educated status and attractive personality, was appointed head of the Rwanda National Guard. That January he was promoted to the rank of major general. Two years later he was made Minister of the National Guard and Police.{{sfn|Akyeampong|Gates|2012|p=527}}

== Presidency ==
On July 5, 1973, while serving as Army Chief of Staff, Habyarimana seized power [[1973 Rwandan coup d'état|in a coup d'état]] against the incumbent President [[Grégoire Kayibanda]] and ousting Kayibanda's ruling [[Parmehutu]] party. In 1975, he created the ''[[National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development|Mouvement Révolutionaire National pour le Développement]]'' as the country's only legal party. The government stayed almost entirely in military hands until 1978, when a new constitution was [[Rwandan constitutional referendum, 1978|approved in a referendum]]. At the same time, Habyarimana was elected to a five-year term as president. He was reelected in single-candidate elections in 1983 and 1988.

[[File:Habyarimanna-VanAgt.jpg|thumb|President Habyarimana with Dutch Prime Minister [[Dries van Agt]] in [[the Hague]], 1980|left]]
A [[Hutu]] himself, he initially won favor among both Hutu and [[Tutsi]] groups given his administration’s reluctance to implement policies that catered to his primarily Hutu supporters. This restraint did not last and Habyarimana eventually began to oversee a government that mirrored the policies of Kayibanda. Quotas were once again applied to jobs for “universities and government services” which intentionally disadvantaged Tutsis. As Habyarimana continued to favor a smaller and smaller coterie of supporters, the more Hutu groups &amp;mdash;slighted by the nation’s leader&amp;mdash; cooperated with Tutsis to weaken his leadership. By the start of the invasion from Uganda by the army of the Rwanda Patriotic Front, a rebel army made up mostly of refugee Tutsi who had helped Uganda's Museveni seize control of the presidency, Habyarimana’s supporters had shrunk down to the [[akazu]] ("little house" or "President's household"), which was mainly composed of an informal group of Hutu extremists from his home region, namely from the northwestern provinces of [[Gisenyi Province|Gisenyi]] and [[Ruhengeri Province|Ruhengeri]].&lt;ref name="akayesu"/&gt;

From 1975 to 1990, the MRND and the Habyarimana government were one. Local administrations simultaneously represented the official party as well as the local authority. Legal and party policies were communicated and enforced from the Head of State down through the local administrative units, especially the general policy of Umuganda where Rwandans were required to “allocate half a day's labour per week” to infrastructural projects.&lt;ref name="akayesu"&gt;{{Cite court | litigants=The Prosecutor versus Jean-Paul Akayesu | opinion=ICTR-96-4-T | court=International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda | date=1998 | url=http://www.unictr.org/Portals/0/Case%5CEnglish%5CAkayesu%5Cjudgement%5Cakay001.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322195248/http://www.unictr.org/Portals/0/Case/English/Akayesu/judgement/akay001.pdf|archive-date=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Habyarimana is sometimes described as a moderate&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Sean D.

However, in 1990, before the RPF invasion, and because of mounting pressure from several sources—Rwanda's main ally and financial backer, France, its main funders, the IMF and the World Bank, and from its own citizens wishing for a greater voice and economic change—he agreed to allow the formation of other parties such as the [[Republican Democratic Movement]], the [[Social Democratic Party (Rwanda)|Social Democratic Party]], the [[Liberal Party (Rwanda)|Liberal Party]] and the [[Christian Democratic Party (Rwanda)|Christian Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name="akayesu" /&gt;

=== Invasion ===
In October 1990, an invasion against Habyarimana's government began when rebels from the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF), a force of mostly [[Tutsi]] Rwandan refugees and expatriates who had served in the Ugandan army (many in key positions), crossed the border from [[Uganda]]. The French and Zairian militaries intervened on behalf of Habyarimana's government forces, and a troubled ceasefire was officially reached in 1993 through the [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|Arusha Accords]].

== Assassination ==
{{Main|Assassination of Juvénal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira}}
On April 6, 1994, Habyarimana's private [[Falcon 50]] jet was shot down near [[Kigali International Airport]], killing Habyarimana. [[Cyprien Ntaryamira]], the [[Rulers and heads of state of Burundi|President of Burundi]], the Chief of Staff of the Rwandan military, and numerous others also died in the attack. The plane crashed on the grounds of the presidential residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|author=Raymond Bonner
|date=November 12, 1994

|accessdate=2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circumstances of the crash are unclear. At the time, the [[Hutu Power]] media claimed the plane had been shot down on orders from RPF leader [[Paul Kagame]]. Others, including the RPF, accused militant Hutus from within Habyarimana's party of orchestrating the crash in order to provoke anti-[[Tutsi]] outrage while simultaneously seizing power. Since the aircraft had a [[France|French]] crew, a French investigation had been conducted; in 2006 it concluded that Kagame was responsible for the killing and demanded that he be prosecuted. The response from Kagame, the ''de facto'' leader of Rwanda since the genocide, was that the French were only trying to cover up their own part in the genocide that followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Aftermath of death ==
=== Fate of remains ===
At some point following the April 6, 1994 assassination, Habyarimana's remains were obtained by [[Zaire|Zairian]] President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] and kept in a private mausoleum in [[Gbadolite]], [[Zaire]] (now [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]). Mobutu promised Habyarimana's family that his body would eventually be given a proper burial in Rwanda. On May 12, 1997, as [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]]'s [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo|ADFL]] rebels were advancing on Gbadolite, Mobutu had the remains flown by cargo plane to [[Kinshasa]] where they waited on the tarmac of [[N'djili Airport]] for three days. On May 16, the day before Mobutu fled Zaire (and the country was renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo), Habyarimana's remains were burned under the supervision of an [[demographics of India|Indian]] [[Hindu]] leader.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEFDA1538F935A25756C0A961958260 Ending a Chapter, Mobutu Cremates Rwanda Ally] by Howard W. French. ''New York Times.'' May 16, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political consequences ===
{{Main|Rwandan genocide}}
The death of Habyarimana ignited a murderous spree by extremists from the majority Hutus against Tutsis and those Hutus who had opposed the government in the past or who had supported the peace accords. Within 100 days, somewhere between 800,000 and 1 million Rwandans were massacred.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1288230.stm Rwanda: How the genocide happened], [[BBC]], April 1, 2004, which gives an estimate of 800,000, and [https://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/subjindx/121rwan.htm OAU sets inquiry into Rwanda genocide] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225085128/http://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/subjindx/121rwan.htm |date=February 25, 2007 }}, Africa Recovery, Vol. 12 1#1 (August 1998), page 4, which estimates the number at between 500,000 and 1,000,000. 7 out of every 10 Tutsis were killed and they lost the war.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and personal life==
Habyarimana's wife, [[Agathe Habyarimana]], was evacuated by French troops shortly after his death. She has been described as having been extremely influential in Rwandan politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{History of Burma}}
The '''Karenni States''', also known as '''Red Karen States''', was the name formerly given to the states inhabited mainly by the [[Red Karen]], in the area of present-day [[Kayah State]], eastern [[Burma]]. They were located south of the Federated [[Shan State]]s and east of [[British rule in Burma|British Burma]].

The [[British government]] recognised and guaranteed the [[independence]] of the Karenni States in an 1875 treaty with Burmese King [[Mindon Min]], by which both parties recognised the area as belonging neither to Burma nor to [[Great Britain]]. Consequently, the Karenni States were never fully incorporated into [[British Burma]]. The Karenni states formed for a time the "Kayah State" in [[Post-independence Burma, 1948–62|post-independent Burma]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/seasia/xshan.html Map of Shan States c.1910]&lt;/ref&gt; but on 29 April 1959 both the Shan and the Kayah rulers formally surrendered their ruling powers to the Burmese government.&lt;ref name="Shan and Karenni States of Burma"&gt;[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Myanmar_shankaren.html Shan and Karenni States of Burma]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There are no historical data on the Karenni States before the 19th century. According to local tradition in the early times of the Karenni states there was a principality led by a  ''"Sawphya"'' that was under the over lordship of a [[Shan people|Shan]] prince. This state finally became independent in the 18th century. In the 19th century the Karenni state was divided into five principalities ''(sawphyas)''.

===British rule in Burma===
In 1864 a Karenni prince requested the status of [[British protectorate]] for his state, but the British authorities did not show any interest. After the death of this prince in 1869 his two sons renewed the petition claiming that they feared Burmese ambitions on their state.
The British refused again, but agreed to arbitrate before the [[King of Burma]]. Since the [[Konbaung Dynasty|Burmese monarchy]] insisted in their demands on the Karenni territories, the British granted recognition to four states, Kyebogyi, Namekan (Nammekon), Naungpale and Bawlake, which became independent under British protection on 21 June 1875. Kantarawadi state, however, remained independent without official protection.&lt;ref name="IGI"&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V15_042.gif Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 15, p. 36.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Karenni States were recognized as tributary to [[British Burma]] in 1892, when their rulers agreed to accept a stipend from the British government. An Assistant Superintendent of the Shan States was based at [[Loikaw]] as [[Agencies of British India|Agent of the British government]]. He was exercising control over the local Karenni Rulers, being supervised by the Superintendent at [[Taunggyi]].&lt;ref name="IGI"/&gt;
On 10 October 1922 the administrations of the Karenni states and the [[Shan states]] were officially unified to establish the [[Federated Shan States]],&lt;ref name=md&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.statoids.com/umm.html | title=Myanmar Divisions | accessdate=10 April 2009 | publisher=Statoids}}&lt;/ref&gt; under a commissioner who also administered the [[Wa States]]. This arrangement survived the constitutional changes of 1923 and 1937. By the 1930s, the [[Mawchi]] Mine in Bawlake was one of the most important sources of [[tungsten]] in the world.

On 27 May 1942, during [[World War II]],  nearby [[Kengtung State]] was invaded and its capital captured by the Thai [[Phayap Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/thailandwwii/shans.html |title=Thailand and the Second World War |accessdate=2009-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027105102/http://geocities.com/thailandwwii/shans.html |archivedate=27 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a previous agreement between Thai Prime Minister [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] and the [[Japanese Empire]], in December the same year the Thai administration occupied Kengtung and parts of [[Mongpan|Möngpan]]. The [[annexation]] by Thailand as [[Saharat Thai Doem]] northern province was formalized on 1 August 1943.&lt;ref name="Shan and Karenni States of Burma"/&gt;

Thailand left the territories in 1945, but officially relinquished its claim over the trans-[[Salween]] part of [[Kantarawadi]] State only in 1946 as part of the condition for admission to the [[United Nations]] and the withdrawal of all wartime sanctions for having sided with the [[Axis powers]].&lt;ref name="David Porter Chandler p. 388"&gt;David Porter Chandler &amp; David Joel Steinberg eds. ''In Search of Southeast Asia: A Modern History''. p. 388&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-independence Burma===
The Constitution of the [[Union of Burma]] in 1947 proclaimed that the three Karenni States be amalgamated into a single constituent state of the union, called '''Karenni State'''. It also provided for the possibility of secession from the Union after 10 years. In 1952, the former [[Shan people|Shan]] state of [[Mong Pai]] was added, and the whole renamed [[Kayah State]], possibly with the intent of driving a wedge between the [[Karenni]] in Kayah State and the rest of the [[Karen people]] in [[Karen State]], both fighting for independence.

==States==
There were five Karenni states, divided into two regions.

===Western Karenni===
The [[Western Karenni]] States were the four Karenni states located west of the [[Salween River]]:
* '''Kyebogyi''', {{convert|350|sqmi|disp=or}}, population 9,867 in 1901.
* '''Bawlake''', {{convert|200|sqmi|disp=or}}, population 5,701 in 1901.
* '''Naungpale''', {{convert|30|sqmi|disp=or}}, population 1,265 in 1901.
* '''Nammekon''', {{convert|50|sqmi|disp=or}}, population 2,629 in 1901.

===Kantarawadi===
[[Kantarawadi]] State was also known as "Eastern Karenni". It had an area of {{convert|2500|sqmi|disp=or}} and a population of 26,333 in 1901.&lt;ref name="IGI"/&gt; More than half of its territory was located east of the [[Salween River]], an area that was annexed by Thailand during World War II.

==Ken Ota==
'''Kenji Ota''' (May 14, 1923 - November 10, 2015) was a second generation Japanese-American, also known as ''[[Nisei]]'', raised in [[Lompoc, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=536 |title=Encyclopedia of Aikido [OTA, KENJI&amp;#93; |publisher=Aikidojournal.com |date=1923-05-14 |accessdate=2011-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605121146/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=536 |archivedate=2011-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He and his family were placed in the [[Japanese American internment|Japanese internment camps]] of World War II.  There, he met and married his wife, Miye Ota.

In 1948, after his release from the internment camp, Ota settled in Goleta, California, and with his family's help, built a home from bricks on the converted swamplands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goletavalleyvoice.com/cgi-bin/frontpage/readarticle.cgi?article=1242&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miye Ota==
'''Miye Tachihara Ota''' (born August 26, 1918), was raised in [[Guadalupe, California]].

[[Image:Ken Ota Shiela Sloan Dance.png|thumb|240px|Ken dancing on television with Sheila Webber-Sloan at the California Star Ball]]The Otas were avid partner-dancers  involved with various social dance circles within the [[Santa Barbara County]].  Following their mastery of [[square dancing]], they began ballroom dance training at the local [[Arthur Murray Dance Studio]].  As they progressed in their dance training they sought out higher levels of instruction, which involved commuting to Los Angeles for lessons from a new group of English instructors teaching [[Ballroom dance#International Style|International Style]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goletaaikido.net/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alex Moore (dancer)|Alex Moore]] certified both Ken and Miye in the International Style of ballroom dance.  Ken went on to be the first man in the U.S. to get the highest Arthur Murray student credentials, Triple Gold Star and Gold Bar.  The Otas were also certified through the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing (ISTD).

Ken's most notable instructor was Sheila Webber-Sloan, a national [[U.S. National Dancesport Champions (Professional Standard)|ballroom dance champion]]; the Webber-Sloan and Ota partnership garnered multiple awards and had several appearances on television, including a broadcast of the California Star Ball.

It was not until chaperoning a school dance for their son, Steve Ota, did they feel compelled to start teaching dance lessons to children; they believed children could learn more tasteful ways of dancing with each other.  Having achieved their competitive goals, they founded a junior [[cotillion]], where they could teach their son and his friends lessons in dance, manners, and other social graces.  The Otas were also contracted to teach these classes by several schools and organizations over the years, including the Junior League of Santa Barbara.

The popularity of their classes grew such that they built their own "cultural school" adjacent to their Goleta home.  The school's brick structure houses a spacious hardwood floor surrounded by white benches and mirrors, and a ceiling that adorns two crystal chandeliers.

For decades, Ken Ota taught ballroom dancing for [[UC Santa Barbara]] as a class for physical education credit, along with separate sessions open to the community through the university's leisure arts program.  His classes also spawned several student-run social clubs that revolve around [[Swing (dance)|swing dancing]], ballroom, and [[dancesport|competitive ballroom dancing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sa.ucsb.edu/orgs/ |title=UCSB Campus Organizations |publisher=Sa.ucsb.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722184444/http://www.sa.ucsb.edu/orgs/ |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Martial Arts==
[[Image:Ken Ota Aikido.png|thumb|180px|Ken Ota teaching Aikido, 1988]]Ken Ota originally practiced the grappling arts [[Sumo]] and [[Judo]], which he regularly participated in from the time he had been placed in the Japanese internment camps of World War II.  It was not until 1963 during his regular commutes to Los Angeles for dance lessons that he came across the art of [[Aikido]].  The whole Ota family enrolled in classes under Isao Takahashi.  The Otas then moved onto training in [[Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido]] under [[Koichi Tohei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aikiweb.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-1155.html |title=Who is Ken Ota? [Archive&amp;#93; - AikiWeb Aikido Forums |publisher=Aikiweb.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Otas built their own "cultural school" next to their Goleta home, which could easily transform into a ''[[dojo]]'' when fitted with removable ''{{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:畳|tatami]]}}'' mats; the main wall adorns a traditional Japanese ''shomen'', which includes photos of [[Morihei Ueshiba]], Koichi Tohei, and a large ''{{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:気|Ki]]}}'' symbol painted by Tohei himself.

The Otas offered classes to children and adults in Judo and Aikido, and also consulted local law enforcement.  Ken was hired to teach martial arts at UC Santa Barbara and [[Cal Poly San Luis Obispo]], where he became advisor for several clubs, including a women's Judo team.  Ken was also contracted by Panther Productions to produce a series of Aikido instructional videos.

Ken and Miye's son, Steve, returned to Santa Barbara after completing his studies at [[San Jose State University]], where he was a member of the championship Judo team.  In the years since Steve's return, many of the adult and high-level classes have transitioned to Steve's direction, as he continues to train and receive recognized ranks in KI Aikido, along with teaching Aikido at UCSB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orgs.sa.ucsb.edu/aikido/ota.html |title=UCSB Ki-aikido club: Steve Ota sensei |publisher=Orgs.sa.ucsb.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716144508/http://orgs.sa.ucsb.edu/aikido/ota.html |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kindred the Family Soul''', also referred to as '''Kindred''', are an [[Americans|America]]n [[neo soul]] duo consisting of married couple of Fatin Dantzler (born in 1973 in [[Camden, New Jersey]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fatin Dantzler Biography|url=http://www.thehistorymakers.org/biography/fatin-dantzler|website=thehistorymakers.org|publisher=The History Makers|accessdate=2017-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Aja Graydon (born September 25, 1978 in [[Los Angeles, California]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aja Graydon biography|url=http://www.thehistorymakers.org/biography/aja-graydon|website=thehistorymakers.org|publisher=The History Makers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signed to [[Hidden Beach Recordings]], Kindred emerged from the [[Philadelphia]] neo soul movement that also includes [[Jill Scott]], who introduced them to her then label president Steve McKeever of Hidden Beach Recordings while the couple was performing at the Black Lily Showcase in Philly weekly back in 2000. Kindred would go on to sign their first recording contract with the label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/kindred_the_family_soul/artist.jhtml |title=Kindred the Family Soul – Full Biography |accessdate=2008-05-10 |work=[[MTV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two years of work on the CD, Hidden Beach issued their debut album ''[[Surrender to Love]]'' in February 2003, which included the single "[[Far Away (Kindred the Family Soul song)|Far Away]]". Their follow-up album was 2005's ''In This Life Together''—its title being a reference to [[Ossie Davis]] and [[Ruby Dee]]'s 1998 book ''With Ossie &amp; Ruby: In This Life Together''—, spawning the single "Where Would I Be (The Question)".

The duo were nominated for a [[Soul Train Music Award]] for [[Soul Train Music Award for Best R&amp;B/Soul Album, Group Band or Duo|Best R&amp;B/Soul Album, Group Band or Duo]] for ''Surrender to Love'' in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=2095895 |title=2004 Soul Train Music Awards Nominees |accessdate=2008-01-31 |date=February 19, 2004 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[BET Awards|BET Award]] for the [[BET Her|BET J]] Cool Like That Award in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/58398/jamie-mary-missy-busta-lead-bet-nominations |title=Jamie, Mary, Missy, Busta Lead BET Nominations |accessdate=2008-01-31 |last=Mitchell |first=Gail |date=May 16, 2006 |work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group's third LP, ''The Arrival'', was released on October 21, 2008. In 2011 the group released the LP ''Love Has No Recession'', which featured many guest artists including the late Chuck Brown, Snoop Dogg, Raheem Devaughn, BJ the Chicago Kid, and Bilal. That record spawned the top 40 Urban AC single "Magic Happens". In 2014, the group released ''A Couple Friends''. In 2016, they released ''Legacy Of Love''.

The '''Lotud''' people are an  [[Indigenous peoples of Oceania|indigenous]] [[ethnic group]] residing in [[Sabah]], eastern [[Malaysia]] on the island of [[Borneo]]. They reside mainly in the [[Tuaran]] District to as far as Kampung Sukoli, [[Telipok]] in the [[West Coast Division]] of Sabah. Their population was estimated at 5,000 in the year 1985 but now believed to be more than 20,000. They are a sub-ethnic group of the [[Dusun]]ic group, now also known as [[Kadazan-Dusun]].

The Dusunic language family is a branch under the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] group of Languages, which is a branch of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] stock of languages ([[ISO 639-3]] dtr). Most of the population has been converted to mostly Catholicism and some to evangelical Christianity, with a dwindling number are still [[animists]]. Less than 20 traditional priestesses are still alive, with no prospect of future replacement.

'''Louis Ange Pitou''' (April 1767 in Valainville, a commune of [[Moléans]] {{convert|5|km}} from [[Châteaudun]] – 8 May 1846 in [[Paris]]) was a French author and counterrevolutionary. 

==Biography==
He entered the priesthood, but after the beginning of the [[French Revolution]] he abandoned his profession. A zealous [[royalist]], he was arrested sixteen times, and finally transported to [[French Guiana|Guiana]] under [[the Directory]]. Shortly after his arrival at [[Cayenne]] he escaped, and after many adventures among the natives he returned to [[France]]. He engaged in new conspiracies under the consulate, and was a few years in prison. After the return of the [[Bourbons]], Pitou received a small pension.

==Works==
He published ''Relation de mon voyage à Cayenne et chez les anthropophages'' (“Story of my journey to Cayenne and among the cannibals”; Paris, 1805). This work, although full of inaccuracies, excited the public curiosity, and a second, enlarged edition was published (2 vols., 1808).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5141">'''Margaret Juntwait''' (March 18, 1957 – June 3, 2015) was an American [[radio]] broadcaster, and the voice of the [[Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts]]. After 13 years on the air at [[WNYC]]-Radio, she debuted as the Met's radio announcer on December 11, 2004. She was also the Met's first announcer on Sirius-XM satellite radio from 2006 and remained in both jobs until her death in 2015.

==Life and career==
Raised in [[Ridgewood, New Jersey|Ridgewood]] and [[Upper Saddle River, New Jersey]], Juntwait attended [[Northern Highlands Regional High School]], where she first developed an interest in choral music.&lt;ref&gt;Beckerman, Jim. [http://www.northjersey.com/betterliving/Ridgewood_native_is_the_voice_of_the_Met.html "Ridgewood native is the voice of the Met"], ''[[The Record (Bergen County)]]'', July 28, 2008. Accessed July 29, 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006174855/http://www.northjersey.com/betterliving/Ridgewood_native_is_the_voice_of_the_Met.html |date=October 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she studied to be an opera singer — she was a lyric [[soprano]] — and received a degree in [[singer|voice]] from the [[Manhattan School of Music]] in 1980. After marrying, she resigned from pursuing an operatic career for the sake of raising her three children.  In 1991, she began her career as a classical music radio announcer at [[WNYC]]-FM radio in [[New York City]].  

Juntwait began at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in 2000 as the back-up announcer for radio host [[Peter Allen (US broadcaster)|Peter Allen]] who retired from the [[Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts]] in May 2004. With the 2004-2005 broadcast season, she took to the air on her own, introducing a performance of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi's]] ''[[Les vêpres siciliennes|I Vespri Sicilani]]''. She became only the fourth person ever to announce the broadcasts, following [[Milton Cross]], Allen, and Lloyd Moss (who substituted just twice).&lt;ref&gt;Wakin, Daniel J. [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/29/arts/music/29oper.html "Met Picks New Voice for Opera Broadcasts"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 29, 2004. Accessed July 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, 2006, the Met announced that Juntwait would become a full-time Met employee, having been appointed as announcer of all programs on [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius Satellite Radio's]] new [[Metropolitan Opera Radio (Sirius XM)|Metropolitan Opera Radio]] channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investor.sirius.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=211679&amp;cat=&amp;newsroom= "The Metropolitan Opera and SIRIUS Satellite Radio to Create Historic New Radio Channel"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027003006/http://investor.sirius.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=211679&amp;cat=&amp;newsroom= |date=2014-10-27 }}, [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] press release, September 20, 2006. Accessed July 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On Sirius, Juntwait hosted three or four live broadcasts a week during the opera season, and recorded introductions for hundreds of archive performances aired on the channel.

Juntwait also performed in radio theater plays produced by NPR veteran [[Joe Bevilacqua]], including ''The Whithering of Willoughby and the Professor.'' In episode 16, Juntwait essays three roles in a parody of the British show ''[[The Prisoner]]'' from the 1960s. In episode 17, Juntwait portrays Willoughby's mother, a mermaid and god.  The plays aired on "The Comedy-O-Rama Hour",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comedyorama.com The Comedy-O-Rama Hour]&lt;/ref&gt; heard on [[XM|XM Satellite Radio]]'s Sonic Theater Channel.

Juntwait died on June 3, 2015 of [[ovarian cancer]], aged 58.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wqxr.org/#!/story/margaret-juntwait-former-wnyc-host-and-voice-metropolitan-opera-dies-58/|title=WQXR - New York's Classical Music Radio Station|work=wqxr.org|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a memorial published on the Metropolitan Opera website, Juntwait had been diagnosed with cancer over ten years prior to her death, but continued working with the Metropolitan Opera, missing only one Saturday matinee broadcast before January 2015. Her final live broadcast was on SiriusXM Radio on December 31, 2014. She recorded material for future broadcasts just a few weeks before she died.&lt;ref name=METRemembrance&gt;{{cite web|title=Remembering Margaret Juntwait|url=http://www.metopera.org/News-Flash1/News-Flash/Remembering-Margaret-Juntwait/|website=Metopera.org|publisher=The Metropolitan Opera House|accessdate=13 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613021354/http://www.metopera.org/News-Flash1/News-Flash/Remembering-Margaret-Juntwait/|archivedate=13 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Astolphe-Louis-Léonor, Marquis de Custine''' (18 March 1790 &amp;ndash; 25 September 1857) was a French [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] and writer who is best known for his [[travel writing]], in particular his account of his visit to Russia, ''La Russie en 1839''. This work documents not only Custine's travels through the Russian Empire, but also the social fabric, economy and way of life during the reign of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]].

==Biography==
[[File:Delphine de Custine.jpg|thumb|left|Delphine de Custine]]

Astolphe de Custine was born in [[Niderviller]], [[Lorrain (province)|Lorraine]]. His family belonged to the [[French nobility]] and possessed the title [[marquis]] since the early 18th century. The paternal branch of the family also owned a famous [[faience]] factory. His mother, Delphine de Sabran, Marquise de Custine, also came from a prestigious family and was noted for her intelligence and great beauty.

Custine's father and [[Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine|grandfather]] both sympathized with the [[French Revolution]] but were both [[guillotine]]d. Custine's mother was imprisoned and barely escaped the same fate. In the aftermath of the overthrow of [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] and the end of the [[Reign of Terror]], the friendship of the marchioness with [[Joseph Fouché]] (who would eventually become Minister of Police under [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]]) allowed her to recover part of the family fortune. Custine and his mother resettled in Lorraine in 1795.

Under the direction of his strong-willed mother, Custine was raised in an chaotic yet stimulating social environment. This brought him into frequent contact with noted intellectuals, among them [[Germaine de Staël]] and [[François-René de Chateaubriand]],&lt;ref name="Oxonian"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered the founder of [[Romanticism]] in [[French literature]]. The marchioness purchased the château of Fervaques, near [[Lisieux]], in [[Normandy]], from the [[Anne-Adrien-Pierre de Montmorency-Laval|Duc de Laval]] in October 1803; Chateaubriand noted his visits there between 1804 and 1806 in which he discussed with both the marchioness and Custine in ''[[Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe]]''.  Delphine died at [[Bex]], in Vaud, Switzerland, July 13, 1826.

Custine was given an excellent education and seemed to be headed towards a life in society. An income of 60,000 francs a year enabled him to live as he pleased. He owned an estate outside Paris, at Saint-Gratien, where on occasions he was visited by [[Frédéric Chopin]].&lt;ref name="observer.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://observer.com/1999/11/a-french-marquis-adventures-dandy-stuff-for-biography/|title=A French Marquis’ Adventures: Dandy Stuff for Biography|date=1999-11-22|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Custine spent time in the diplomatic service, attending the [[Congress of Vienna]], and even accepted a military commission. In 1821 Custine married Léontine de Saint-Simon de Courtomer, following the wishes of his mother. The Marquis, who would later admit his [[homosexuality]] and live openly with a male lover, was nevertheless genuinely fond of his wife. They had a son, Enguerrand. During the marriage Custine met and established a romantic relationship with an Englishman, Edward Saint-Barbe, who moved into the house with the couple, and remained his life companion.&lt;ref name="Muhlestein"&gt;[[Anka Muhlstein]], "A Taste For Freedom: The Life of Astolphe de Custine", Helen Marx Books, 1999, pp184-186, p261&lt;/ref&gt; In 1823, during the early stages of a second pregnancy, Léontine fell ill and died, aged only twenty.&lt;ref name="Muhlestein" /&gt;

On 28 October 1824, Custine's life was irrevocably changed. That night, he was found unconscious  in the mud outside of Paris, stripped to the waist, having been beaten and robbed. The attack had been carried out by a group of soldiers; with one of whom Custine allegedly had attempted to have a sexual encounter.&lt;ref name="Erlanger"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/16/weekinreview/word-for-word-marquis-de-custine-long-ago-look-russia-so-what-else-new.html|title=Word for Word/The Marquis de Custine;A Long-Ago Look at Russia: (So What Else Is New?)|last=Erlanger|first=Steven|date=1996-06-16|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the exact reason for the attack was never proven. Nevertheless, news of the incident quickly spread around France &amp;mdash; "From this time on to the end of his life Custine would figure, in the cruel gossip of the day, primarily as France's most distinguished and notorious homosexual." Even though the literary salons, as opposed to the society salons, remained open to Custine, many people who were friendly with him sneered at him behind his back. His diplomatic career was also cut short by this incident.&lt;ref name="Oxonian"/&gt; A few years later, in 1826, several family friends would die, as well as  Custine's young son Enguerrand (born 1822), by his late wife, and his mother.

In the years after these tragedies, Custine became very pious.

Custine gravitated toward the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement and spent the next few years writing [[poetry]] and [[novel]]s. Custine wrote one play and purchased a theater to produce it, but the play closed after three performances. None of his literary works received much attention. [[Heinrich Heine]] called Custine "un demi-[[homme des lettres]]" (a half-man of letters).

In 1835, an extremely attractive Polish count, the twenty-three year old Ignatius Gurowski (1812–1887),&lt;ref&gt;Ruvigny et Raineval, Melville Henry Massue marquis de''The Blood Royal of Britain'', Genealogical Publishing Company, 1994, p87&lt;/ref&gt;  moved into Custine and Saint-Barbe's home in the rue de La Rochefoucauld to form a ménage à trois. Wrote Custine: "He has an excellent heart, an original mind, is graciously ignorant of everything, and what settles it all, a charming bearing and countenance." &lt;ref name="Muhlestein" /&gt; The capricious Gurowski was not an easy guest, running up debts and seducing both men and women, but appears to have amused the couple. The detailed register of homosexuals, then maintained by the Paris police prefecture, and which termed Custine's inclinations 'frantic', wrote of Gurowski with a comical note of possible despair: "It is hereditary in his family: his father and grandfather were of the same religion."&lt;ref&gt;[[Laure Murat|Murat, Laure]] ''La tante, le policier et l'écrivain'' in ''Sexologie et théories savantes du sexe'', Revue d'Histoire des Sciences Humaines, 2007; https://www.cairn.info/revue-histoire-des-sciences-humaines-2007-2-page-47.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1841 Gurowski married a Spanish infanta [[Isabella Ferdinanda de Bourbon]].&lt;ref&gt;''Almanacco della Real Corte di Lucca, 1847'', Tipgrafia Giusti, Luca 1847, p104&lt;/ref&gt;

==''La Russie en 1839''==
Custine eventually discovered that his knack was for travel writing. He wrote a decently received account of a trip to Spain and was encouraged by [[Honoré de Balzac]] to write accounts of other "half-European" parts of Europe, like southern Italy and Russia. In the late 1830s, [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]'s ''[[Democracy in America]]'' appeared, whose last chapter contained the prophecy that the future belonged to Russia and [[United States|America]]. Inspired by Toqueville's work, Custine decided that Russia would be the subject of his next writing effort. Custine was later dubbed by some historians as "the de Tocqueville of Russia".&lt;ref name="Caplan"&gt;{{cite web | last = Caplan | first = Bryan | authorlink = Bryan Caplan | coauthors = | date = | year = | month = | url = http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/museum/czar1.htm | title = Czarist Origins of Communism, I | work = Museum of Communism | pages = | publisher = | language = | accessdate = 2006-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Custine visited Russia in 1839, spending most of his time in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], but also visiting [[Moscow]] and [[Yaroslavl]]. A political reactionary in his own country, fearful that democracy would inevitably lead to mob rule, he went to Russia looking for arguments against [[representative government]], but he was appalled by autocracy as practiced in Russia and equally by the Russian people's apparent collaboration in their own oppression. He attributed this state of affairs to what he saw as the backwardness of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], combined with the disastrous effects of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasion of medieval Russia]], and the policies of [[Peter the Great]]. He was struck by the "smothering enormity of power and the randomness of everyday life and death".&lt;ref name="Erlanger" /&gt; Custine criticized St. Petersburg for being the creation of one man and not the result of spontaneous historical forces. Custine, however, loved [[Moscow]] architecture and predicted that Russia would be a great power if its capital were ever moved back to the older city.

Most of Custine's mockery was reserved for the [[Russian nobility]] and [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]. Custine said that Russia's aristocracy had "just enough of the gloss of European civilization to be 'spoiled as savages' but not enough to become cultivated men. They were like 'trained bears who made you long for the wild ones.'" Other tart and much-quoted observations included:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In Russia, everything you notice, and everything that happens around you, has a terrifying uniformity; and the first thought that comes into the traveler's mind, as he contemplates this symmetry, is that such entire consistency and regularity, so contrary to the natural inclination of mankind, cannot have been achieved and could not survive without violence."

"The nature of its Government is interference, negligence and corruption. You rebel against the notion that you could become accustomed to all this, yet you do become accustomed to it. In that country, a sincere man would be taken for an idiot."

"A wealth of unnecessary and petty precautions here engenders a whole army of clerks, each of whom carries out his task with a degree of pedantry and inflexibility, and a self-important air solely designed to add significance to the least significant employment."

"The profession of misleading foreigners is one known only in Russia....everyone disguises what is bad and shows what is good before the master's eyes."&lt;ref name="Erlanger" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Custine criticized Tsar Nicholas for the constant spying he ordered and for repressing Poland. Custine had more than one conversation with the [[Tsar]] and concluded it was possible that the Tsar behaved as he did only because he felt he had to. "If the [[Emperor]] has no more of mercy in his heart than he reveals in his policies, then I pity Russia; if, on the other hand, his true sentiments are really superior to his acts, then I pity the Emperor" (Kennan 76).

Kennan describes Russia as a horrible domain of obsequious flattery of the Tsar and spying. Custine said the air felt freer the moment one crossed into [[Prussia]]. In the mid-20th century, many commentators drew parallels between Custine's description of Russia and contemporary Soviet Union as well as noticing many similarities between his character outline of Nicholas I and [[Joseph Stalin]].

===Publication and reaction===
''La Russie en 1839'' went through six printings and was widely read in England, France, and Germany but banned in Russia. Nevertheless, some books printed in France were smuggled in and made an impact on Russian society. From 1890 to 1891, fragments of the book were published in Russian journals. Poorly-abridged versions of the book were published in 1910 and in 1930 in the [[Soviet Union]]. Finally, an unabridged version was published in 1996.

Several Russian authors published works critical of Custine's ''La Russie en 1839'', among them ''Un mot sur l'ouvrage de M. de Custine, intitulé: La Russie en 1839'' by Xavier Labenski ([[:fr:Jean Polonius|Jean Polonius]]) and ''Examen de l'ouvrage de M. le marquis de Custine intitulé "La Russie en 1839"'' (Paris, 1844) by [[Nicholas Gretsch]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=JngJuw9__xsC&amp;pg=PA348&lt;/ref&gt; Tsarist authorities also sponsored a more scholarly investigation of Russia by a foreigner, [[August von Haxthausen]], who authored the ''Studies on the Interior of Russia''.&lt;ref&gt;''Studien über die Zustände, das Volksleben, und insbesondere die ländlichen Einrichtungen Russlands'', the first two volumes published in 1847, with a third published in 1852.&lt;/ref&gt; This work can be interpreted as an attempt to provide an objective research of Russia's traditional social institutions, which the Tsar's advisors believed would effectively counter Custine's work. ''Studies'' was translated from German into French and English in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, David C. "Russia and the Crystal Palace 1851" in ''Britain, the Empire, and the World at the Great Exhibition of 1851'' ed. Jeffery A. Auerbach &amp; Peter H. Hoffenberg. Ashgate, 2008: p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tsar also commissioned the French writer [[Hippolyte Auger]] to pen an extensive refutation. However, as the scandal of Custine's work had subsided by then, the Tsar decided it was best not to remind the public of the book, and the project was abandoned.&lt;ref name="Tolley"&gt;Tolley, Bruce ''A Saint-Simonian writer: Hippolyte Auger (1797–1881)'', Australian Journal of French Studies, Vol 11, Issue 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

Custine died of a stroke in the evening of 25 September 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Muhlstein, Anka, ''A Taste For Freedom: The Life of Astolphe de Custine", 1999, p378&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Custine's observations in ''La Russie en 1839'' continue to be admired for their insight, prescience and sheer entertaining value, but are also disliked by others for reasons that can include the belief they are inaccurate, pretentious, racist, and that the idea of national stereotypes is an absurdity.&lt;ref name="Erlanger" /&gt; It has been suggested that he is one of the originators of a putative West European Russophobia.&lt;ref name="Starobin"&gt;{{citation |title=The Eternal Collapse of Russia |first=Paul |last=Starobin |work=The National Interest |date=28 August 2014 |url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-eternal-collapse-russia-11126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Layton 2006 51"&gt;{{citation |contribution=Russian Military Tourism |first=Susan |last=Layton |title=Turizm: The Russian and East European Tourist Under Capitalism and Socialism |editor-first=Anne E. |editor-last=Gorsuch |page=51 |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2006 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=qe06_rwosg4C&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=de-custine+russophobe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rYXlgI_vas&amp;sig=tj6bNyxHlvrVxajttcrPB1ik9BQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uQBXVLXHJoiayQSZsIHQBA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=de-custine%20russophobe&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as one critic has written, what is indisputable is that "Above all, the Marquis valued freedom; freedom from fear, hypocrisy and the shackles that restrain the human spirit."&lt;ref name="observer.com"/&gt;

A character representing Custine appears in the 2002 film ''[[Russian Ark]]''; his conversations with the time-travelling narrator are intended to reflect Russia's continued struggle to search for its own identity and define its relations vis-à-vis Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3599">'''Maurice and Maralyn Bailey''' were a British couple who, in 1973, survived for 117 days on a rubber raft in the [[Pacific Ocean]] before being rescued.

Maralyn Bailey was born Maralyn Harrison on 24 April 1941 in [[Nottingham]], [[England]]. Maralyn and Maurice married in 1963.

==117 days adrift==
The Baileys' journey began when they left [[Southampton]], England, in their {{convert|31|ft|m|adj=on}} [[yacht]] ''Auralyn.'' Their intended destination was [[New Zealand]]. They passed safely through the [[Panama Canal]] in February and were on their way to the [[Galapagos Islands]]. At dawn on 4 March 1973, their yacht was struck by a [[whale]] and severely damaged. After transferring some supplies to an inflated [[life raft]] and [[dinghy]] and salvaging some food, a [[compass]], and other supplies, the Baileys watched as ''Auralyn'' disappeared beneath the waves. To survive, they collected rainwater and when their meager food supplies ran out, began eating sea creatures such as [[turtle]]s, [[seabird]]s and fish caught by hand or with [[safety pin]]s fashioned into hooks. As they drifted in the open [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], the couple saw seven different ships, but were unable to attract these ships' attention since their signal flares failed and their emergency kit did not contain a signalling mirror. Their life raft began to disintegrate and required frequent reinflation. They read and played card games early in their ordeal, but later the Baileys suffered terribly from malnutrition and friction-induced sores, the latter worsening due to the wet conditions in the raft. They encountered [[shark]]s and [[dolphin]]s and had to endure several severe storms.

After traveling some {{convert|1500|mi|km}}, the Baileys were rescued by the crew of the [[South Korea]]n [[fishing boat]] ''Weolmi 306'' on 30 June 1973. Sailors on the ship spotted the raft after initially passing it by. The couple was brought aboard in an emaciated state, having lost some {{convert|40|lb|kg}} apiece and with their legs barely able to support their weight. ''Weolmi 306'' brought them to [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]] and to a fine welcome.

==Aftermath==
The Baileys returned to England and wrote an account of their ordeal entitled ''117 Days Adrift'' (published with the title ''Staying Alive!'' in the [[United States]]), which was published in 1974 by [[Adlard Coles Nautical]]. The following year, they returned to the sea in their new yacht, ''Auralyn II.''

Maralyn Bailey died in 2002 at the age of 61.
Maurice Bailey died in December 2017.

== Activities ==
Burhanuddin issued a [[dress code]], calling for male Bohras to grow a beard and wear a white [[Gandhi cap|topi]] and [[kurta]], and for females to wear a colorful two piece [[abaya]]. This Islamization countered a trend toward assimilation into the larger ([[Hinduism|Hindu]]-oriented) culture of their neighbors that was prevalent under his predecessor, Taher Saifuddin.&lt;ref name="blank"&gt;{{cite book |first=Jonah |last=Blank |title=Mullahs on the Mainframe: Islam and Modernity Among the Daudi Bohras |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2001 |pages=184–185 |isbn=0226056775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1999, Burhanuddin was elected Chancellor of the [[Aligarh Muslim University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Signposts|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/syedna-mohammed-burhanuddin-elected-chancellor-of-aligarh-muslim-university/1/255159.html|work=India Today|date=18 October 1999|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a position that [[Taher Saifuddin#Da'i al-Mutlaq|his father also held]]. He is credited with expanding the two century old Arabic university [[Al Jamea tus Saifiyah]]. In 1983, a new campus of "Al Jamea tus Saifiyah" was built in Karachi by him.&lt;ref name="thindu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=From Gurukul to IBO varsity|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/From-Gurukul-to-IBO-varsity/articleshow/5204269.cms|first=Ashlesha|last=Khurana|date=6 November 2009|work=The Times of India|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He built "Burhaniyah Business Counselling Centre" in Mumbai to provide modern business solutions.&lt;ref name="thindu"/&gt;  He built ''[[Raudat Tahera]]'', a mausoleum of his father [[Taher Saifuddin]] in Mumbai, India. It is unique for its kind, having the entire [[Quran]] inscribed on its inner white walls in letters of gold and with precious stones.&lt;ref name="thindu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="missing"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/latest-news-know-10-rare-facts-about-dawoodi-bohra-leader-syedna-32588.html?page=6 | title=Know 10 rare facts about Dawoodi Bohra leader Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin | accessdate=7 April 2014 | work=India TV | page=6 | date=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was inaugurated in 1975 by the erstwhile President of India [[Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed]].

In 1998, he constructed the [[Mahad al-Zahra]] institute for memorization and recitation of the [[Quran]].

Mohammed Burhanuddin is credited with the establishment of community kitchens to provide meals everyday to the [[Dawoodi Bohra]] families, thus providing free time for women to pursue economic, educational or religious activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=City Bohris start dabba service for community households|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai/city-bohris-start-dabba-service-for-community-households/article1-746239.aspx|work=Hindustan Times|first=Reetika|last=Subramanian|date=16 September 2011|location=Mumbai|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Faith and food in the Bohra way|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2301221/FORTUNE-COOKIE-Faith-food-Bohra-way.html|work=Mail Online India|date=29 March 2013|first=Sourish|last=Bhattacharyya|accessdate=11 July 2015|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community kitchens don't discriminate between the privileged and the underprivileged sections, both getting the same "good quality and hygienically-prepared" food,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bohra women get respite from cooking|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-bohra-women-get-respite-from-cooking-1659990|work=DNA|location=Mumbai|first=Shabana|last=Ansari|date=9 March 2012|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the community members have the provision of paying for their own family, and for sponsoring those who cannot afford it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/Freedom-from-the-kitchen-smoke-heat/articleshow/47942733.cms|accessdate=7 July 2015|title=Freedom from the kitchen smoke &amp; heat|work=The Times of India|location=Aurangabad|first=Ranjana|last=Diggikar|date=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohammad Burhanuddin is also credited with conceptualizing and establishing [[Saifee Hospital]] in Mumbai. The hospital is a state-of-the-art, multi-specialty, 250-bed hospital dedicated to providing modern medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=saifee hospital mumbai|url=http://wecareindia.com/saifee-hospital-mumbai/|work=Best Hospitals in India Low Cost Treatment {{!}} Cost Treatment in India at Best Hospitals}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was inaugurated in 2005 by [[Dr. Manmohan Singh]], the erstwhile prime minister of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indian Prime Minister inaugurates Saifee Hospital in Mumbai|url=http://wam.ae/en/details/1395227441320|work=wam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Payankh_stele_Mariette.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Hugh Nibley relates the name to that of "Piankh(i)".]]

'''Paanchi''' ({{IPAc-en|p|eɪ|ˈ|æ|n|k|aɪ}}),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «pā-ăn´kī»&lt;/ref&gt; a person in the [[Book of Mormon]] ({{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Helaman 
|chapter=1|verse=3|range=-8}}), was one of the sons of [[Pahoran]] who contended for the judgement-seat of the [[Nephite]] people. He was executed in about 50 BC for plotting to seize the judgement-seat by violent rebellion. 

== Possible origin of the name ==
[[Hugh Nibley]] relates the name to Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Nibley|Nibley, Hugh]] &amp; Hummel, Sharman Bookwalter (ed.) ''Nibley's Commentary on the Book of Mormon, Vol. 1'' (2013), ASIN: B00GFY0GUO&lt;/ref&gt; and states:

:"The first high priest [of the twenty-first dynasty in Egypt] was called [[Herihor|Korihor]], and his son was called [[Piankh]]i - two Book of Mormon names. They have the same relationship in the Book of Mormon. Paanchi is one of the high judges... Piankhi was a very famous name by the time [[Lehi (Book of Mormon prophet)|Lehi]] left Jerusalem. It was a priestly name, and a royal name. Some people say it was [[Piye|Piankhi]] who founded the twenty-fifth dynasty [of Egypt]; some say it was [[Shebitku|Shabako]]."

[[Mormon]] scholars have speculated that the presence of the name "Paanchi" in the Book of Mormon indicates that claims of ancient [[Nubian people|Nubian]] influence in [[Pre-Columbian America]] (specifically, in the time of Nubian King [[Paanchi]]) and claims of the Book of Mormon to be an authentic record from ancient America are mutually supportive. If so, that would also mean that some of the Book of Mormon people had African roots. At least three different migrations from the [[Old World]] to the Americas are described in the Book of Mormon, and that would imply that there were others that were unknown to the Nephite writers.

The possibility that [[Adolf Hitler]] had [[monorchism|only one testicle]] has been a fringe subject among historians and academics researching the German leader. The rumour may be an [[urban myth]], possibly originating from the contemporary British [[military song]] "[[Hitler Has Only Got One Ball]]". Nevertheless, research, eyewitness testimony and historical study have not been able to prove or disprove the suggestion.

Hitler's doctor {{Interlanguage link multi|Erwin Giesing|de}} and his personal  physician [[Theodor Morell]] disregarded the idea of Hitler's monorchism and said there was nothing wrong with Hitler's testicles.&lt;ref&gt;Waite, Robert G.L. ''The Psychopathic God: Adolf Hitler'', Basic Books, N.Y.C., 1977, pp. 150–152&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, it was reported that doctor's notes from [[Landsberg Prison]] recorded that Hitler had "right-sided [[cryptorchidism]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/19/hitler-really-did-have-only-one-testicle-german-researcher-claims Hitler really did have only one testicle, German researcher claims] ''[[The Guardian]]'' 19 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==

===World War I medical records===
In November 2008, the discovery of an eye-witness account on how Hitler was treated after being shot on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during [[World War I]] was announced in the press. According to these reports, a former German Army Medic named Johan Jambor gave an account to a Polish priest and amateur historian, Franciszek Pawlar, in the 1960s, of how he saved Hitler's life in 1916 after a groin injury and saw that he had lost a testicle.&lt;ref name="fox"/&gt; Jambor said that as they were carrying Hitler away, they came under French fire and had to temporarily abandon him, upon which he began to scream very loudly, imploring them to come back and threatening them with [[court martial]] if they left him behind.&lt;ref name="bild"/&gt; Pawlar's record of the conversation was discovered by Pawlar's relatives and published by Polish author Grzegorz Wawoczny.&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,454744,00.html German Medic's Account Confirms Hitler Had Only One Testicle] ''Fox News'' 19 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; According to the  British tabloid ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|Sun]]'', a surviving friend of Jambor's, Blassius Hanczuch, has confirmed the story, adding that Jambor and his co-rescuers dubbed Hitler "screamer".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hitler HAD only got one ball|url = http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/1945960/Hitler-HAD-only-got-one-ball.html|website = www.thesun.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-27|date = 2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tabloid Bild says that according to Jambor, "His abdomen and legs were covered in blood. Hitler was wounded in the abdomen and had lost a testicle. His first question to the doctor was: 'Can I still father children?{{'"}}&lt;ref name="bild"&gt;[http://www.bild.de/BILD/news/vermischtes/2008/11/19/lebensretter-von-adolf-hitler/lebte-in-angst-weil-er-von-hodenverletzung-wusste.html "Weil er von der peinlichen Hodenverletzung wusste: Hitlers Lebensretter lebte Jahrzehnte in Angst"], ''Bild'', 19 November 2008 {{de icon}} "Sein Unterleib und seine Beine waren voller Blut. Hitler war am Unterleib verletzt und hatte einen Hoden verloren. Seine erste Frage an den Arzt war: 'Kann ich noch Kinder zeugen?"&lt;/ref&gt;

Military records show that Hitler was wounded in 1916 during the [[Battle of the Somme]], which has been described as a wound to the groin or in the left thigh when a shell exploded in the dispatch runners' dugout.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=57}} Other more recent historians, such as [[Ian Kershaw]], conclude the wound was to Hitler's left thigh.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=57}}

===Prison records===

In December 2015, it was reported that documents from Landsberg prison were to be released and compiled for a book. Amongst them is a note in prison doctor Josef Brinsteiner's "Aufnahmebuch" (book of arrivals at prison), who reportedly examined Hitler in 1923, saying that he had "right-sided [[cryptorchidism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/geschichte/zweiter-weltkrieg/article150109063/Der-wahre-Grund-fuer-Hitlers-gestoertes-Sexleben.html|title=Adolf Hitler litt unter angeborener Missbildung an seinen Hoden - DIE WELT|author=Sven Felix Kellerhoff|date=18 December 2015|work=DIE WELT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.de/20151218/hitler-really-did-have-just-one-ball-professor|title=Hitler really did have just one ball: historian|author=|date=|work=thelocal.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet autopsy===
In 1970, the [[Death of Adolf Hitler|Soviet autopsy]] on Hitler's remains was released. This document, which was allegedly compiled shortly after the conclusion of [[World War II]] on the basis of the examination of the remains claimed to be those of the [[Führer]], stated he was [[monorchid]]. It stated:

{{quote|The autopsy performed by the Red Army pathologists on Hitler's body... [produced clear] findings:

The left testicle could not be found either in the scrotum or on the spermatic cord inside the inguinal canal, or in the small pelvis[...]}}

[[Robert G. L. Waite]], in his book ''[[The Psychopathic God: Adolf Hitler]]'' (1978), accepted the accuracy of this evidence:

{{quote|Since the matter is of considerable importance to the psychological development of Hitler from infancy onward, let us pause here and come to grips with the problem of the Fuehrer's testicles.  It can now be affirmed that the British [[Tommy Atkins|Tommies]] were right all along in the first line of their version of the Colonel Bogey March, they were although manifestly mistaken in the last&amp;mdash;that is to say, unless [[Goebbels children|Goebbels' six children]] were the progeny of adoption, paternal surrogacy or some hitherto unconsidered, presumably unpalatable "[[Gott mit uns]]" form of divine intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tNaS6C5os8kC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=let+us+pause+here+and+come+to+grips+with+the+problem+of+the+Fuehrer%27s+testicles |title=The Psychopathic God: Adolf Hitler - Robert G.

Waite - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Waite150&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waite|first1=Robert G.L.|title=The psychopathic god : Adolf Hitler|date=1993|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0306805141|pages=150–152|edition=Da Capo Press paperback ed., Unabr. republication of the ed. first publ. in New York, Basic Books, in 1977 / with the add. of a new foreword by the author and some emendations}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Because the release occurred at the height of the [[Cold War]],  its conclusions have been questioned in terms of [[propaganda]]. Journalist [[Ron Rosenbaum]] argues in his book ''[[Explaining Hitler]]'' that the Soviet autopsy of Hitler cannot be accepted as authoritative because the Führer's body was said to have been almost completely [[Cremation|immolated]] after his suicide inside the ''[[Führerbunker]]''. There were insufficient remains for any proper analysis to be conducted. Rosenbaum suggests that based on information from Hitler's own doctor and recantations by the compilers of the published form of the report, the Soviet autopsy report was a fabrication. Noted historian [[Ian Kershaw]] describes the corpses of [[Eva Braun]] and Hitler as being fully burned when the Red Army found them, with only a lower jaw with dental work identifiable as Hitler's remains.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian (2008). ''Hitler: A Biography'', p. 958.&lt;/ref&gt;

An interview with the Soviet doctor, Lt. Col. [[Favst Shkaravsky]], who led Hitler's autopsy is in the extras section on the DVD of the 1970s documentary series ''[[The World At War]]''. Shkaravsky claims that those performing the autopsy unexpectedly found one testicle missing. Shkaravsky states categorically that Hitler was not shot in the head. Although since the filming of the series, the evidence has been found showing that Hitler [[Death of Adolf Hitler#Suicide|shot himself in the right temple]], and it has been shown that different versions of Hitler's fate were presented by the Soviet Union according to its political desires.&lt;ref&gt;Eberle, Henrik &amp; Uhl Matthias (2005). ''The Hitler Book: The Secret Dossier Prepared for Stalin from the Interrogations of Hitler's Personal Aides'', p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian (2008). ''Hitler: A Biography'', p. 955.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Song==
During [[World War II]], the song "[[Hitler Has Only Got One Ball]]" was popular among [[United Kingdom|British]] citizens. British author [[Donough O'Brien (author)|Donough O'Brien]] says his father, [[Toby O'Brien]], wrote an original set of lyrics in August 1939 as part of the country's official program of [[propaganda]].&lt;ref&gt;Donough O'Brien, [http://www.fringe-benefits.co.uk/frinfacs.html Fringe Facts], 2000, [https://web.archive.org/web/20010314042458/http://www.fringe-benefits.co.uk/frinfacs.html archived] at the [[Wayback Machine]], 14 March 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the suspicion that the source of this myth stems from the British song, usually put to the tune of the [[Colonel Bogey March]].

==Modern allusions==
Before finding success with [[Violent Femmes]] in the 1980s, band members [[Brian Ritchie]] and [[Victor DeLorenzo]] were members of a group called "Hitler's Missing Testis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rozen |first=Leah |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20094323,00.html |title=No, the Violent Femmes Aren't Lady Wrestlers, but They've Got Young Rock Fans in Their Grip |publisher=People.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, the [[Brisbane]] [[anarcho-punk]] scene included the band "Hitler's Other Testicle". They regularly played songs on the subject of Hitler's possible monorchism, including "Where Did It Go?" and "The Sadness of Autumn".

'''María Justa de Jesús''' (January 6, 1667 - 1723) was a Spanish [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] [[nun]] and [[mysticism|mystic]].

== Early life ==
She was born in La Victoria de Acentejo in the north of the island of [[Tenerife]]. She trained as a Franciscan in the Saint Joseph Convent in [[La Orotava]]. Her life was involved in mysticism and controversy.&lt;ref name=A&gt;[http://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2017/03/galeria-misticos-tinerfenos/ Los 4 místicos tinerfeños]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
The [[Holy Inquisition]] tried her as a [[witch]].&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; She was accused of practicing [[Molinist]] doctrines.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/18989443/Los_conventos_de_La_Orotava Los conventos de La Orotava. Manuel Hernández González.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was hinted that the relationship with her confessor was not appropriate for a religious person.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; Her biographer and confessor, Andrés de Abreu, burned the biography he had written about her.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/3361096.pdf Alrededor de Fray de Abreu (1647-1725): Historiografía literaria y una obra inédita.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar Jose Herrera said that among her virtues was to give sight to the blind, to make the deaf hear, the mute to speak, heal the lame, heal diseases and expel [[demons]].&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

Sr. Maria Justa healed the sick by transferring to her person the evils and diseases that afflicted them. [[Shamanic]] priests&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; in other cultures used analogous techniques to cure convalescents. That similarity fed the suspicions of those who called her an  "''[[Alumbrados|alumbrada]]''". During these healings, the nun suffered multiple ailments, covering her body in sores and elevating her body temperature, which brought her to the brink of death.

== Death ==
Sister Maria Justa died in 1723. According to the chronicles of the time her body showed signs of sanctity, such as flexibility, pleasant fragrances and fluidity of her blood.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; After her death the Franciscan Order in the [[Canary Islands]] conducted a process of [[canonization]] that was later halted.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;

== ''Alumbrados'' ==
Her case was ascribed to the phenomenon of the ''"[[Alumbrados]]"'' that arose in small Castilian towns two centuries earlier. These were people who professed doctrines considered heretical by the [[Catholic Church]], believing that union with [[God]] came only through mystical experiences and private prayer, without intermediation of the [[sacraments]]..

'''Sofiane el-Fassila''' ({{lang-ar|سفيان الفصيلة}}), also known as '''Harek Zoheir''' حارك زهير, (born 1975 – October 6, 2007) served as the second-in-command of [[Al Qaeda]] in [[North Africa]] until [[Algeria]]n security forces killed him.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;[http://www.dailycomet.com/article/20071010/API/710100566 A Top Algeria Al-Qaida Affiliate Killed] Daily Comet&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="death2"&gt;[http://www.pr-inside.com/reports-top-al-qaida-in-islamic-north-r238922.htm Reports: Top al-Qaida in Islamic North Africa leader killed by Algerian security forces] PR-Inside&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and militant activity==
Sofiane born in 1975 in Sidi Daoud in the region of Dellys, and he became a militant in the Algerian jihadist group [[Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.djazairess.com/fr/liberte/82829&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2006, he was appointed by [[Abdelmalek Droukdel]] as the head of central zone of AQIM's operating space. The following year, following the Droukdel's oath of allegiance to [[al-Qaeda]] dubbing of Droukdel to the rank of "[[emir]]" of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Sofiane became one of his closest commanders. Involved in numerous terrorist attacks, Sofiane was known to be the head of a network specialized in arms trafficking, a cell of which was dismantled in [[Berriane]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vitaminedz.org/tribunal-criminel-de-boumerdes/Articles_15688_162626_35_1.html&lt;/ref&gt; Sofiane was presented as the brain of the attacks of 11 April 2007 in Algiers, perpetrated against the Government Palace in the heart of the capital. However, some sources agree that the real coordinator of the attacks was Sid Ali Rachid, also known as Ali Dix, presented as the "military advisor" of Droukdel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vitaminedz.org/-ali-dix-tombe-dans-une-embuscade-au-djurdjura/Articles_15688_29802_0_1.html&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007, the Court of Boumerdès sentenced him in absentia to 20 years imprisonment and then to life imprisonment for several cases of terrorism. Harek Zoheir died on 6 October 2007, killed in a counter-terrorism operation by the Algerian security forces in the Boghni region of Kabylia. Two other fighters are also killed during the operation.&lt;ref&gt;http://equoter.blogspot.gr/2007/10/algeria-oil-islam-war-on-terror.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-10-10-1217438287_x.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2195">'''Vadim the Bold''' was a legendary chieftain of the [[Ilmen Slavs]] who led their struggle against [[Rurik]] and the [[Varangians]] in the 9th century.

According to the [[Nikon Chronicle]], a historic 16th-century Russian chronicle that covered events of 859–1520 CE, the Novgorodians broke into rebellion against [[Rurik]], their ruler, but his Varangian [[druzhina]] managed to quell the riots and murdered their leader, Vadim. The first Russian historian, [[Vasily Tatishchev]], conjectured that Vadim's mother was the elder daughter of [[Gostomysl]]. Hence, Vadim was Rurik's elder cousin and had a better claim to the throne.

==In Russian literature==
After Tatischev's publications, Vadim became one of the most popular characters in the 18th-century [[Russian literature]]. [[Yakov Knyazhnin]], a leading playwright, penned a play in which he contrasted Vadim, a defender of [[Novgorod]]'s ancient freedom, with the authoritarian Rurik. When the play appeared in 1791, [[Catherine the Great]] was enraged, although she had fictionalized Vadim's struggle against Rurik in one of her own plays. Against the background of the [[French Revolution]], Knyazhnin was accused of [[Jacobinism]] and all printed copies of his play were to be burnt.

==Authenticity issues==
In the 19th century, [[Sergey Solovyov]] and other major historians cast a doubt on the historicity and [[Authentication|authenticity]] of Vadim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://az.lib.ru/k/knjazhnin_j_b/text_0030.shtml "Vadim of Novgorod"]: The tragedy in verse in five acts. (Russian). [http://az.lib.ru/ The project "Collection of classics" Libraries Moshkova (Lib.ru / Classical)]. Accessed May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, he is considered a legendary personage. Yet his freedom-loving character appealed to the spirit of [[Romanticism]]. Three leading Russian poets of the era, [[Alexander Pushkin]], [[Vasily Zhukovsky]] and [[Mikhail Lermontov]], based their poems on the subject of Vadim's legendary exploits.

==Early life and education==
[[File:W.E.PereraParents.jpg|thumb|right|W. E. Perera's parents, Mr and Mrs W. Charles Perera]]
W. E. Perera was born in Telok Anson, Perak, to Weeratunge Charles Perera and his wife, Galgodliynage Marthina Perera. His father a contract railway engineer from [[Kotahena]], Ceylon (now [[Sri Lanka]]) settled in Malaya (1880s) after accepting the permanent position as Head Guard of the railway between Teluk Anson and [[Tapah]] and later retiring as Chief Inspector, Permanent Ways, of the Malayan Railways.&lt;ref name="singhalesebook4"&gt;{{cite book |
 last = Arseculeratne | first = S. N. | title = Sinhalese Immigrants in Malaysia and Singapore 1850 - 1990|year = 1991| pages = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his siblings, elder sister Margaret, and younger brothers Samuel, Joseph and Daniel grew up in [[Seremban]], [[Negri Sembilan]] where his father was subsequently transferred. W. E. Perera started his education at [[St. Francis Institution]], [[Malacca]] and then moved to [[St. Xavier's Institution]], [[Penang]] to complete his [[Senior Cambridge|Junior Cambridge]] exams. After passing the local government school leaving exams at Standard VII, at the direction of his father, he continued his studies whilst living in [[Perai|Prai]], [[Penang]] with his parents. He passed his Senior Cambridge Certificate exams on a second try during the height of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="message1966"&gt;{{cite book | last = Perera | first = W. Edward | title = Memoirs to the family |year = 1966| pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I (1914–1918)===
The First World War came to Malaya at the [[battle of Penang]] on 28 October 1914. As he describes in his memoirs,&lt;ref name="message1966"/&gt;

{{quote|The First World War had broken out and I remember one morning at about 4.30 am when I was studying alone, my parents and brothers being all asleep I heard a loud explosion. Everybody was awakened by the noise and we opened the door and went outside and looked towards the seaside, when we saw flashes of light and heard more explosions. That was the bombardment of the Russian cruiser [[Russian cruiser Zhemchug|Zhemchug]] by the German pirate cruiser "[[SMS Emden (1908)|Emden]]". After the sinking of the Russian Cruiser, the German ship steamed out of the Harbour and disappeared before the British Man-of-War had time to catch up with her. That morning when we went to school we saw the dead bodies of the Russian sailors floating all over the sea between [[Butterworth, Penang|Butterworth]] and Penang. It was all excitement in Penang and our school closed for the day. We spent a good part of that morning at the harbour watching the marine police  and volunteers bringing ashore dead bodies. The single regiment of the [[Federation of Malaya]] known as the [[Malay States Guides]] which was stationed in [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]] was quickly summoned to Penang. This regiment was composed of Moslem and Sikh soldiers. The Moslems were sent to guard [[Singapore]] and the Sikhs to guard Penang.}}

During this time W E Perera was a member of the Cadet Corps and through his friend Pertha Singh, befriended all the petty officers of the local guarding regiment frequently meeting with them in "one famous bar in those days known as Kee Kee Hotel", Penang.&lt;ref name="message1966"/&gt;
Although being in the Commonwealth the sympathies of the locals were with the Germans during the early part of World War I.

{{quote|As soon as Turkey joined the war on the side of the Germans, the Moslem section of the Malay States Guides stationed in Singapore  mutinied and there was great commotion in the country. The volunteer company in Penang was called out for duty in Singapore and we in the Cadet Corps took on an appearance of importance. We were give more rifle practice, sham-fights and guard duties to perform.&lt;ref name="message1966"/&gt;}}

After leaving school and short apprenticeships in engineering and surveying, his father arranged for him to join the Government service to apprentice under the Chief Clerk of the Railway Traffic office and later the Lands Office in Teluk Anson. Here, W. E. Perera learnt to buy and sell land, plant rubber and became conversant in the Malay language. He also applied to join the Army in an Anglo-Indian regiment being formed in India with volunteers from Malaya much to the disapproval of his father. However, his departure was delayed and later cancelled when the [[Armistice Day|Armistice]] was ratified with Germany.&lt;ref name="message1966"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
On being transferred to Batu Gajah, he lived in his own quarters, socialised with the local Eurasian community, studied and experimented in  psychology, parapsychology, took up athletics and even music, playing the clarinet in a local band. He passed his clerical examinations and then completed a teaching diploma alongside doing a course in bookkeeping.&lt;ref name="message1966"/&gt;

==Career and marriage==
[[File:W.E.PereraWedding.jpg|thumb|right|Mr and Mrs W. Edward Perera]]
W. E. Perera was employed by the [[Anglo-Chinese School, Ipoh|Rev. W. E. Horley]] as a teacher at the Methodist High School in Telok Anson.  By heeding the sound advice of his mentor Mr W. A. Rabel and friends, he saved enough money to invest in coconut and rubber plantations which he successfully ran whilst continuing his career as a teacher. This gave him financial independence to pursue various social activities like helping organise the Boy Scouts of Lower Perak and the Methodist Youth Fellowship, Telok Intan. In 1922, he created "The Cosmopolitan Club", Telok Anson, a multi-racial, secular social club much to the angst of the British who tried to keep the races separate. This gave him the opportunity to interact and befriend influential people from various social and ethnic groups like the Japanese, Chinese, Eurasians, Indians, Europeans, Malays and the Royalty of Teluk Anson.&lt;ref name="whoswho"/&gt;&lt;ref name="singhalesebook5"&gt;{{cite book |
 last = Arseculeratne | first = S. N. | title = Sinhalese Immigrants in Malaysia and Singapore 1850 - 1990|year = 1991| pages = 144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1928 after a brief visit to see his mother and sister in [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]], he met and eventually married Meepaygamay Kankananga Joci Perera (7 March 1908 – 6 January 1994) on 11 January 1929. They had 10  children: Minona, Jothika, Abhay, Wimala, Susimal,Tissa, Kimsuke, Jinamal, Kusala and Jaya in the years 1930 to 1947.

==The war years==

===Japanese invasion of Malaya (1942-1945)===
The war arrived to Telok Anson in form of air bombing raids by the Japanese Air Forces. Despite being instructed to leave Teluk Anson by the British district officer, W. E. Perera was one of a few people that boldly came out of hiding to help the unfortunate victims. He was a volunteer in the St Johns Ambulance at that time and months earlier had received training as a Superintendent of a medical unit which he put to good use.&lt;ref name="message1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="singhalesebook6"&gt;{{cite book |
 last = Arseculeratne | first = S. N. | title = Sinhalese Immigrants in Malaysia and Singapore 1850 - 1990|year = 1991| pages = 179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As described in one of his birthday messages:&lt;ref name="message1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="singhalesebook7"&gt;{{cite book |
 last = Arseculeratne | first = S. N. | title = Sinhalese Immigrants in Malaysia and Singapore 1850 - 1990|year = 1991| pages = 183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|As soon as the Japanese invaders established a forward base at Telok Anson and the retreating British army had destroyed the water works at Changkat Jong, I don't know what prompted me to approach the Commander of the Japanese suicide Corps and warn him of the danger of the Japanese soldiers drinking the drain water, for the pollution would make them sick before they got to Singapore, their destination. In fact I was indirectly pleading for the safety of our own population. The Commander being an understanding man with knowledge of some English offered me a motor-car (all motor-cars including my own having been commandeered by the invaders) and a written order to collect workers and technicians to repair the waterworks and give water to the town immediately. He also provided me with all transport for the workers and a pass to allow us to travel without any molestation by their soldiers. I managed to find, and encourage a few workmen to come with me and we worked at Changkat Jong Headworks and several mains for three or four days working day and night and succeeded in giving water to Telok Anson to the relief of the Japanese as well as our own people. I enjoyed this thrill immensely.

Having obtained the ear of this Suicide Corps Commander, I pleaded with him to stop his soldiers from molesting the young girls in the town. I remember he told me that it was not possible for him to do as his men were going to die at the front but he suggested that I should form an interim government and appoint a mayor of the town. This would help to curb somewhat the behavior of his men. I lost no time in getting some of my friends in hiding to come forward for this task. We organised a sanitation brigade and the local police to function under the late Raja Yahaya as O.C.P.D. and Mr. J. Bahaduri a lawyer as the Mayor. This was another thrilling experience for me. About three months after the occupation of Perak, civil authorities arrived from Japan and organised the Government of Perak. The late Cik Megat Yunus was appointed the District Officer of Telok Anson.

Although I knew nothing of electricity, and the English schools were not functioning the late Cik Megat Yunus and [[Yusuf Izzuddin Shah of Perak|Raja Yussof, the then Raja Muda of Perak]] in recognition of my services appointed me Officer-in -charge of Electricity, so that I could have a salary to run my kitchen. When I organised the Huttenbacks Electrical Organisation with the help of the old members of staff and restored electricity to the town: another job of organisation was thrust on me.

The Telok Anson Government Hospital had been totally looted when the British evacuated, and the hospital beds and furniture were also missing. With information I got, I was fortunate in locating most of the looted drugs in the home of a younger brother of an Assistant Surgeon in this hospital. Sometime prior to the coming of the Japanese, the medical Officer having been panic-stricken left his post stealthily without leaving any instructions to his assistants in hospital. Some persons from whom I recovered the hospital things threatened my life, but I cared not being full of the thrill of doing a good job.}}

Throughout the war, Mr W. E. Perera was not affected by the [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities of the Japanese soldiers]] or the [[Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army|Communists]] but he was not immune to other factions which he thought were [[Opportunism|war opportunists]]. W. E. Perera slapped an [[Indian National Army]] health officer who rebuked him for contributing only 5 Japanese dollars for their movement. This landed W. E. Perera being branded a traitor, arrested and detained in the [[Kempeitai]] jail. However, after a few hours, he was released when his friends who worked for the Japanese protested his innocence to the Kempeitai.&lt;ref name="singhalesebook8"&gt;{{cite book |
 last = Arseculeratne | first = S. N. | title = Sinhalese Immigrants in Malaysia and Singapore 1850 - 1990|year = 1991| pages = 282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, a number of people lived with the family of W. E. Perera at his residence at various times for protection against persecution by the Japanese, Communists and for economic reasons. These included Mr Neoh Ban Soon and family, Mr James Ranatunge and family, Mrs Rosie Shoemarker and family, Mrs Loveridge and six former members of an Auxiliary Armed Force. To purchase food during these years, W. E. Perera sold some of his properties.&lt;ref name="singhalesebook9"&gt;{{cite book |
 last = Arseculeratne | first = S. N. | title = Sinhalese Immigrants in Malaysia and Singapore 1850 - 1990|year = 1991| pages = 216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

W. E Perera saved a number of people from being executed during this period. As witnessed by his eldest son Jothika,&lt;ref name="singhalesebook5" /&gt;

{{quote|Mrs Shoemarker (a Eurasian) was saved twice by father. A Japanese officer saw her, said " Ingiris" (English) and took out his revolver to shoot her. Father pleaded with him that she was an Indian, and he changed his mind ....She was again taken for execution by the communists as she had borne a child off a Japanese. Father rescued her again ..... Dato Abdullah, The Chief Minister and later Minister of Lands and Mines was district officer in Teluk Anson when father rescued him from Chinese communists.}}

===Communist Insurgency (1946–1958)===
[[File:W.E.Perera MBE.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Mr. W. E. Perera receiving his insignia of the order of the M.B.E. from General Sir Gerald Templer, the High Commissioner of the Federation of Malaya.|Mr. W. E. Perera receiving his insignia of the order of the M.B.E. from Gen. Sir [[Gerald Templer]], the High Commissioner of the Federation of Malaya.]]

Life in Telok Anson was still difficult after the surrender of the Japanese at the end of World War II when the [[Malayan Emergency]] was declared. In the message given to his family, W. E. Perera relates the following:&lt;ref name="message1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="singhalesebook10"&gt;{{cite book |
 last = Arseculeratne | first = S. N. | title = Sinhalese Immigrants in Malaysia and Singapore 1850 - 1990|year = 1991| pages = 362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|During the interregnum lasting about a month, we were ruled by the communists and paid salaries by them. I remember one day I had to go to Ipoh in a lorry to fetch fuel oil from Ipoh for our engines. On the way back I was fortunate to meet some British paratroopers for the first time in years, and I lost no time in giving them the information that was then rife in Telok Anson that in the next two days the Chinese troops from China would be in Telok Anson and there would be a liquidation of all leading Government servants. The paratroopers told me that their orders were that the British Indian Troops that were then disembarking at [[Port Swettenham]] were destined to the north by-passing Telok Anson. Being impressed with the veracity of my information, I was happy when those men gave me the assurance that they would immediately inform their Hqrs. of what I had told them. We were thrilled to see the arrival of a contingent of British Indian troops in Telok Anson early the next afternoon.

My greatest thrill was during the early period of the British military administration, when the Communists tried to show their power by ordering the closure of schools and holding processions and rallies etc. and denouncing the British and kidnapping all wealthy people who failed to support them with finance. On my own initiative, I opened the old school at Immigrant / Anson Roads in defiance of their orders and in addition, I opened Chinese classes in the afternoon with the co-operation of Pastor Lim Hong Yong to take off the children from the streets as the Chinese Schools remained closed. This enraged the Communists who made an attempt to burn the old building but we quelled the fire in time. The British military administration was behind me and they even provided me with money to rehabilitate the old school long before the missionaries arrived on the scene.}}

When the missionaries arrived and found out what W. E. Perera, a non-Methodist teacher had done for their school, they appointed him Principal of the School.&lt;ref name="message1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="singhalesebook10" /&gt;

As principal, he created a new high school with a laboratory for science teaching as an extension of ACS, Teluk Anson by getting his friend Mr V. Kn. Kannappa Chettiar to dispose of a five-acre block of rubber land which he owned adjoining the Raja Muda's Istana for a reasonably low price of $25,000. The school was constructed with donations from the Missionaries, various guilds and associations like the rubber and copra associations, sizeable contributions from [[Perak royal mausoleum|Raja Musa the then Raja Muda of Perak]], and the Malay Gurus Association for special class-rooms to be named after them.&lt;ref name="message1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="singhalesebook2" /&gt;

W.E Perera was the first in Malaya to initiate a housing society for teachers of his school at Teluk Anson from 1953 to 1955. He sought loans, land, got the houses built and created the housing estate named ''Kampung Guru'' (Teacher's Village) after refusing to have it named after him. This estate was opened by Governor Mc Gillivray of Teluk Anson.&lt;ref name="singhalesebook3" /&gt;

Not one to rest on his laurels, W. E. Perera refused to accept any offers of honours or awards from the [[Yusuf Izzuddin Shah of Perak|Sultan of Perak]] for his community service during the war. He also refused the recommendation for an [[MBE]] (Member of the Order of the British Empire) award made by the then governor Sir [[Edward Gent]]. However, when General Sir [[Gerald Templer]] offered it again with the statement "the people have requested that it be bestowed upon you", W. E. Perera could not turn down the honour.&lt;ref name="singhalesebook3" /&gt;

==Retirement==
Keeping to his desire to retire in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Selangor]] so that his children could have better work and social opportunities, W. E Perera accepted the position of Principal of the Kishan Dial School, [[Petaling Jaya]] from the late Swami Satayanda. He eventually settled in Petaling Jaya, Kuala Lumpur in 1965. Here he delved into the study of Asian philosophy and was involved in the establishment of the [[Buddhist Maha Vihara, Brickfields|Brickfields Buddhist Temple]] among other social endeavours like volunteering in the schools for the underprivileged. He taught Buddhist philosophy at the local university and regularly had discussions with visiting and resident Theravada Buddhist monks like the Revs. [[K. Sri Dhammananda]], Ananda Mangala and [[Henepola Gunaratana]] whom he mentored.&lt;ref name="banteG"&gt;{{cite book |

W. E. Perera died at the University hospital, Petaling Jaya from a massive heart attack before he was due to receive a pacemaker. Having been the first voluntary worker with the blind to have pledged his eyes earlier, his corneas were donated to the eye bank and successfully transplanted into two recipients.&lt;ref name="StaitsTimesnews"&gt;{{cite book |
