'''ABET''', incorporated as the '''Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc.''', is a [[non-governmental organization]] that accredits [[post-secondary]] [[education program]]s in [[applied science|applied]] and [[natural science]], [[computing]], [[engineering]] and [[engineering technology]].&lt;ref name="ABETHomePage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abet.org/about-abet/ |title=About ABET |publisher=ABET |accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABETConstitution"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abet.org/constitution/ |title=ABET Constitution |publisher=ABET |accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://issuu.com/auburn_eng_mag/docs/2010-volume-19-issue-2 |title=A Centennial of Auburn Engineering: From Red Clay to Red Satellite |journal=Auburn Engineering |author=Art Slotkin |year=2010 |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=20–27 |publisher=[[Auburn University]] |accessdate=2012-01-08 |quote=(p.24) ...what we know today as ABET, the accrediting body for college and university programs in applied and natural science, computing, engineering, and technology.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Engineering in context |chapter=Chapter 5: Engineering Education in the US and the EU |chapterurl=http://arrow.dit.ie/ahfrcbks/2/ |last1=Bucciarelli |first1=Louis L. |last2=Coyle |first2=Eugene |last3=McGrath |first3=Denis |year=2009 |editor1-last=Christensen |editor1-first=Steen Hyldgaard |editor2-last=Delahousse |editor2-first=Bernard |editor3-last=Meganck |editor3-first=Martin |publisher=[[Academica (Gyldendal)|Academica]] |isbn=978-87-7675-700-7 |page=123 |accessdate=2012-01-08}} See section "Accreditation – ABET".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[educational accreditation|accreditation]] of these programs occurs mainly in the [[United States]] but also internationally. {{As of|2017|10}}, 3,852 programs are accredited, distributed over 776 universities and colleges in 31 countries.&lt;ref name="ABETHomePage"/&gt;

ABET is the recognized U.S. accreditor of college and university programs in applied and natural science, computing, engineering and engineering technology. ABET also provides leadership internationally through workshops, memoranda of understanding, and mutual recognition agreements, such as the [[Washington Accord]]. ABET has been recognized by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA) since 1997. Also, ABET evaluates programs offered in a 100-percent online format.&lt;ref&gt;"ABET Online Accreditation." [http://www.abet.org/accreditation/new-to-accreditation/online-programs/] accessdate=2016-04-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
ABET was established in 1932 as the [[American Engineers' Council for Professional Development|Engineers' Council for Professional Development]] (ECPD) by seven engineering societies:&lt;ref name="ABET History"&gt;[http://www.abet.org/History/] from ABET's website&lt;/ref&gt; 
* the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE), 
* the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers&amp;nbsp;– now the [[American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers]] (AIME),
* the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME), 
* the American Institute of Electrical Engineers&amp;nbsp;– now the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE),
* the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education&amp;nbsp;– now the [[American Society for Engineering Education]] (ASEE), 
* the [[American Institute of Chemical Engineers]] (AIChE), and 
* the National Council of State Boards of Engineering Examiners&amp;nbsp;– now the [[National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying]] (NCEES).

ECPD was founded to provide a "joint program for upbuilding engineering as a profession." However, it almost immediately began developing as an accreditation agency, evaluating its first engineering program in 1936 and its first engineering technology program in 1946. By 1947, 580 programs at 133 institutions had been accredited.&lt;ref name="ABET History"/&gt;

ECPD changed its name to the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc. in 1980, and began doing business as ABET in 2005. In 1985, ABET helped establish the Computing Sciences Accreditation Board ([[CSAB (professional organization)|CSAB]]), which is now one of ABET's largest member societies with over 300 programs, in response to a dramatic rise in interest of computer science education.&lt;ref name="ABETConstitution"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABET History"/&gt;

==Members==
ABET is a [[federation (disambiguation)|federation]] of 35 professional and technical ''member societies'' representing the fields of applied science, computing, engineering and engineering technology.&lt;ref name="soc"&gt;[http://www.abet.org/about-abet/member-societies/ About Member Societies]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ABET accreditation process==
ABET accredits post-secondary degree-granting programs offered by institutions that are regionally accredited in the U.S. and nationally accredited outside of the U.S. Certification, training, or doctoral programs are not accredited.

ABET accreditation is voluntary; the request for accreditation is initiated by the institution seeking accreditation.&lt;ref name="bas"&gt;[http://www.abet.org/the_basics.shtml The Basics of Accreditation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220162139/http://www.abet.org/the_basics.shtml |date=February 20, 2009 }} from the ABET website&lt;/ref&gt; Accreditation is given to individual programs within an institution rather than to the institution as a whole. Accredited programs must request re-evaluation every six years to retain accreditation; if the accreditation criteria are not satisfied, additional evaluations may be required within the six-year interval.&lt;ref name = "bas"/&gt; Programs without previous accreditation can apply for accreditation as long as they have produced at least one program graduate.&lt;ref name = "bas"/&gt;

The first step in securing or retaining ABET accreditation is for an institution to request an evaluation of its program(s) by January 31 of the year in which accreditation is being sought.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;[http://www.abet.org/uploadedFiles/Accreditation/New_To_Accreditation/New%20Program%20FAQ-10-11.pdf Information for Programs Seeking Initial Accreditation: Answers to Frequently Asked Questions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419184345/http://www.abet.org/uploadedFiles/Accreditation/New_To_Accreditation/New%20Program%20FAQ-10-11.pdf |date=April 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The eligibility of the institution must be established, which can be satisfied if the institution is accredited by a regional accreditation agency.  Each program is then assigned to one of four accreditation commissions within ABET:&lt;ref name = "faq"/&gt;
* Applied and Natural Science Accreditation Commission (ANSAC)
* Computing Accreditation Commission (CAC)
* Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC)
* Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission (ETAC)
The program is assigned to a commission based on its title (the program name shown on the transcript).  Each commission has different accreditation criteria.&lt;ref name = "faq"/&gt;

Each program then conducts an internal evaluation and completes a self-study report.&lt;ref name = "bas"/&gt; The self-study documents how well the program is meeting the established accreditation criteria in multiple areas, such as their students, curriculum, faculty, administration, facilities, and institutional support.&lt;ref name = "bas"/&gt;  The self-study report must be provided to ABET by July 1.&lt;ref name = "faq"/&gt;

While the program conducts its self-study, the appropriate ABET commission (Applied and Natural Science, Computing, Engineering or Engineering Technology Commission) will choose a team chair to head the on-campus evaluation visit.  A visit date (generally in the September&amp;nbsp;– December time frame) is negotiated between the team chair and the institution.&lt;ref name = "faq"/&gt;  Once the date is set, the ABET commission will assign program evaluators (generally one per program being evaluated).  The institution is provided the opportunity to reject the team chair or program evaluators if a conflict of interest is perceived.&lt;ref name = "faq"/&gt;  The team chair and evaluators are volunteers from academe, government, industry, and private practice.&lt;ref name = "bas"/&gt;

Once the program evaluators are accepted by the institution, they are provided with the self-study report for their assigned program.  This report forms the basis of their evaluation of the program, and prepares them for the campus visit.

The evaluation team (team chair and program evaluators) will normally arrive on campus on a Saturday or Sunday.&lt;ref name = "faq"/&gt; During the on-campus visit, the evaluation team will review course materials from each program, as well as student projects and sample assignments.&lt;ref name = "bas"/&gt;  Evaluators will also interview students, faculty, and administrators, and tour the facilities to investigate any questions raised by the self-study.  The visit will normally conclude the following Tuesday with an exit interview with the institution's chief executive officer, dean, and other appropriate institution personnel as appropriate.&lt;ref name = "faq"/&gt;   This interview is intended to summarize the results of the evaluation for each program.

Following the campus visit, the institution has 7 days in which to correct perceived errors of fact communicated during the exit interview.&lt;ref name = "faq"/&gt;   Following this period, the team chair will begin preparation of a draft statement to the institution; this statement undergoes extensive editing and will typically be provided to the institution several months after the visit.  On receipt of the draft statement, the institution has 30 days to respond to issues identified in the evaluation.&lt;ref name = "faq"/&gt;   After this response, the team chair prepares a final statement to the institution.

The final statement and recommended accreditation action is reviewed by the large annual meeting of all ABET commission members in July after the campus visit.  Based on the findings, the commission members vote on the final accreditation action, and the school is notified of the decision in August.&lt;ref name = "faq"/&gt;

The information the school receives identifies strengths, concerns, weaknesses, and deficiencies of the program, as well as recommendations for compliance with ABET criteria. Accreditation is granted for a maximum of six years, after which the institution must request another evaluation.&lt;ref name = "bas"/&gt;

==Criteria==

ABET specifies minimum curricula for various engineering programs.  For instance, ABET requires that all engineering graduates of a baccalaureate program receive at least one year of study in the natural or physical sciences and mathematics, and requires some study within general education.&lt;ref name="Accreditation Criteria"&gt;[http://www.abet.org/accreditation-criteria-policies-documents Accreditation criteria] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204140407/http://www.abet.org/accreditation-criteria-policies-documents |date=February 4, 2012 }} from ABET's website&lt;/ref&gt;  ABET also requires that each student complete a capstone project or design class in their education.&lt;ref name = "Accreditation Criteria"/&gt;  Because of ABET's involvement, engineering curricula are somewhat standardized at the bachelor's level, thus ensuring that graduates of any ABET-accredited program have some minimal skill set for entry into the workforce or for future education.

==EC 2000==
For most of its history, ABET's accreditation criteria specifically outlined the major elements that accredited engineering programs must have, including the program curricula, the faculty type, and the facilities.  However, in the mid-1990s, the engineering community began to question the appropriateness of such rigid accreditation requirements.&lt;ref name="ec2000"&gt;[http://www.abet.org/engineering-change Engineering Change:] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329072403/http://www.abet.org/engineering-change |date=March 29, 2012 }} A study of the impact of EC2000 (executive summary)&lt;/ref&gt;

After intense discussion, in 1997, ABET adopted Engineering Criteria 2000 (EC2000).&lt;ref name = "ec2000"/&gt;  The EC2000 criteria shifted the focus away from the inputs (what material is taught) and to the outputs (what students learned).  EC2000 stresses continuous improvement, and accounts for specific missions and goals of the individual institutions and programs.&lt;ref name = "ec2000"/&gt;  The intention of this approach was to enable innovation in engineering programs rather than forcing all programs to conform to a standard, as well as to encourage new assessment processes and program improvements.

== ISO 9000:2015 ==
ABET- Accreditation is certified by the International Organization for Standardization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=International Organization for Standardization|date=2018-08-05|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Organization_for_Standardization&amp;oldid=853572588|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISO 9000 family of  [[quality management system]]s standards is designed to help organizations ensure that they meet the needs of customers and other stakeholders while meeting statutory and regulatory requirements related to a product or service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poksinska|first=Bozena|last2=Jörn Dahlgaard|first2=Jens|last3=Antoni|first3=Marc|date=October 2002|title=The state of ISO 9000 certification: a study of Swedish organizations|url=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/09544780210439734|journal=The TQM Magazine|language=en|volume=14|issue=5|pages=297–306|doi=10.1108/09544780210439734|issn=0954-478X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous==
To become a licensed [[professional engineer]], one common prerequisite is graduation from an EAC of ABET-accredited program. Requirements for professional engineer testing for EAC accredited programs vary from state to state.

The Engineering Credential Evaluation International (ECEI) was established in 1997 as the credential evaluation service of ABET.  ECEI specialized in the evaluation of degrees in engineering, engineering technology, computer science and surveying from outside the U.S.  As of October 30, 2006, ECEI stopped accepting applications for credentials evaluation; a business decision made by the ABET board of directors.&lt;ref name = "eceu"&gt;[http://www.ecei.org/ ECEI FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1435">The '''ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines''' were created by the [[American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages]] in order to provide a means of assessing the [[language proficiency|proficiency]] of a [[foreign language]] speaker.

The guidelines are broken up into different proficiency levels: novice, intermediate, advanced, superior, and distinguished. Additionally, each of these (except superior and distinguished) is further subdivided into low, mid and high.  These proficiency levels are defined separately for ability to listen, speak, read and write. Thus, in those American programs that emphasize written language over spoken, students may reach the advanced level in reading and writing while remaining at a lower level in listening and speaking.

'''''Action Philosophers!''''' was a self-published [[comic book]] series by artist [[Ryan Dunlavey]] and writer [[Fred Van Lente]], which was awarded a [[Xeric Grant]] in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.xericfoundation.org/comicbooks/2004.html |title=Xeric Foundation Comic Book Self-Publishing Grants for 2004 |publisher=Xericfoundation.org |accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to Action Philosophers! # 1's publication in April 2005.

The series focused on a concise biography of some of the most notable [[Philosophy|philosopher]]s and their ideas.  To quote the  book's homepage:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eviltwincomics.com/action/index.php the book's homepage] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022151339/http://www.eviltwincomics.com/action/index.php |date=October 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
ACTION PHILOSOPHERS! is a comic book series detailing the lives and thoughts of history's A-list brain trust in a hip and humorous way that proves that philosophy is not just the province of boring tweed-enveloped college professors.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The series concluded with issue # 9, published in September 2007. The series was also collected into various self-published paperback collections. [[Dark Horse Comics]] published a deluxe hardcover collection of the series with new material in October, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=https://www.darkhorse.com/Books/25-905/Action-Philosophers-HC |title=Action Philosophers! HC |publisher=darkhorse.com |accessdate=2014-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pikas was born in [[Viljandi]], [[Estonia]], and raised in [[Norrköping]] in Sweden. He has been a visiting professor in [[Peace education|Peace Education]] in [[Heidelberg]],  at the [[University of Alberta, Edmonton]], and at [[Gustavus Adolphus College]] in [[Minnesota]], USA.

In the 1960s Pikas’ fields of teaching and research included [[cognitive psychology]] and in the 1970s Peace Education. Since the 1980s, Pikas has been developing his Shared Concern method, SCm, originally aimed at dealing with cases of bullying and hazeing when they occur in high school. More recently, SCm has been used as a basis for [[Peer Mediation]] and treating youth violence and gang activity in cases where therapeutic mediation can be applied. SCm is presented in a class discussion: not to seek guilt but a shared solution. The students are asked to write the names of "those who need help". Private discussions start with those mentioned which reveal the names of the suspected bullies are revealed. First in private and later in group discussion a shared resolution with their probable victim is prepared. If this is considered to be acceptable by the therapeutic mediator, the probable victim is invited and a shared solution obtained. If this is in accordance with the norms of the school, the case is considered to be solved but a surveillance continued until satisfactory co-operation is secured.

'''Anders Selinder''' (4 November 1806, [[Stockholm]] – 6 November 1874, [[Stockholm]]), was a Swedish ballet dancer, choreographer and director.  He was [[Ballet master]] of the [[Royal Swedish Ballet]] in 1833–1856.

==Life==

Anders Selinder was the son of the jeweler A. Selinder in Stockholm. 

Selinder premier dancer at the Royal ballet in the [[Royal Swedish Opera]] in Stockholm in 1829-46.   In 1833, he was appointed ballet master at the age of twenty seven.  He succeeded [[Per Erik Wallqvist]], and worked closely to [[Sophie Daguin]], who had previously shared the position of ballet master with Wallqvist and was principal of the Opera's ballet school.  Together, Selinder and Daguin are considered to have upheld a high standard of the ballet.&lt;ref&gt;Klas Ralf: Operan 200 år. Jubelboken (1973) {{sv icon}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Anders Selinder has been referred to as one of the most noted ballet masters of the royal ballet.&lt;ref&gt;Klas Ralf: Operan 200 år. Jubelboken (1973) {{sv icon}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

During this time, there was a new interest for the old [[Folk dance]], which were at that time disappearing.  Selinder preserved the folk dance by making them into ballets.  He wrote several ballet compositions, and made the choreography to the national opera ''Värmlänningarne'' in 1846. He composed about 40 ballets and 40 opera ballets. Many of his ballets were used by the Folk dance movement where they are still performed, such as ''[[Daldans]]'', ''[[Jössehäradspolska]]'' and ''[[Vingåkersdans]]''.

In 1856, both Selinder and Sophie Daguin lost their positions at the royal ballet.  This has been pointed out as the beginning of a certain decay which affected the Royal Swedish Ballet during the second half of the 19th-century, when ballets where given much less space and often only allowed to be a complement of the opera plays.&lt;ref&gt;Klas Ralf: Operan 200 år. Jubelboken (1973) {{sv icon}} &lt;/ref&gt;  

After having lost his position as ballet master, Anders Selinder formed a ballet company and toured Sweden: this was the first travelling ballet company in Sweden.  The company also performed folk dance and gave lessons in that art. 

Between 1858 and 1866, Selinder managed a children's theatre. In 1870–1871, he was joint director in the theatre ''[[Ladugårdslandsteatern]]''.

Among his famous students were [[Anna de Wahl]], [[Sophie Cysch]], [[Mathilda Hodell]], [[Hilma Bruno]], [[Hilda Bingvall]], [[Zelma Eklund]], Gardt and C. GL Callmén, [[Mina Pettersson]], [[Sophie Dahl (actress)|Sophie Dahl]], [[Gunhild Rosén]], [[Robert Sjöblom]] and [[Gustaf Ullberg]].

The '''breadwinner model''' is a paradigm of [[family]] centered on a [[wikt:breadwinner|breadwinner]], "the member of a family who earns the money to support the others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/breadwinner|title=breadwinner|encyclopedia=Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English|publisher=Pearson ELT}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the earner works outside the home to provide the family with income and benefits such as [[health insurance]], while the non-earner stays at home and takes care of children and the elderly.

Since the 1950s, social scientists and feminist theorists have increasingly criticized the gendered division of work and care and the expectation that the breadwinner role should be fulfilled by men. Norwegian government policy has increasingly targeted men as fathers, as a tool of changing [[gender relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bjørnholt | first1 = Margunn | authorlink1= Margunn Bjørnholt | year =2014 | title = Changing men, changing times; fathers and sons from an experimental gender equality study | url = http://www.margunnbjornholt.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Changing-men-changing-times-fathers-and-sons-from-an-experimental-gender-equality-study.pdf | journal = [[The Sociological Review]] | volume = 62 | issue = 2  | pages = 295–315 | doi = 10.1111/1467-954X.12156 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent years have seen a shift in gender norms for the breadwinner role in the U.S. A 2013 Pew Research study found that women were the sole or primary breadwinners in 40% of heterosexual relationships with children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wang|first1=Wendy|title=Breadwinner Moms|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/29/breadwinner-moms/|website=Pew Research Center Social &amp; Demographic Trends|accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise==
In Britain, the breadwinner model developed among the emerging middle-class towards the end of the [[industrial revolution]] in the mid-nineteenth-century. Prior to this, in low-income families, a subsistence wage was paid based upon the individual worker's output, with all members of the family expected to contribute to the household upkeep.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was another side to the transformation of wage relations in mid-19th-century Britain involving two closely related changes: first, a shift in the prevailing wage form, from a joint to an individual payment; and second, a shift in the predominant subsistence norm of a living wage, from a family group's income to the ideal of an adult male-breadwinner wage. This is the notion that the wage earned by a husband ought to be sufficient to support his family without his wife and young children having to work for pay.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Seccombe |first=Wally |last2= |first2= |date=Jan 1986 |title=Patriarchy Stabilized: The Construction of the Male Breadwinner Wage Norm in Nineteenth-Century Britain |jstor=4285488|journal=Social History |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd. |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=53–76 |doi= 10.1080/03071028608567640}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The increase in wages among skilled labourers and lower-middle-class workers allowed for a far larger number of families being able to support the entire family unit on one wage, and the breadwinner model became an attainable goal for a far wider proportion of society. Within this model, "The division of labour in parenting tasks can also be classified as 'caring about' (breadwinning) and 'caring for' (nurturing) children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Strange |first=Julie-Marie |date=December 2012 |title=Fatherhood, Providing and Attachment in Late Victorian and Edwardian Working-Class Families |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8744490&amp;fileId=S0018246X12000404 |journal=The Historical Journal |publisher=Cambridge University Press |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=1007–1027 |doi= 10.1017/s0018246x12000404|access-date=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
In the United Kingdom, the emergence of the breadwinner norm coincided with and helped to facilitate the removal of children from the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Seccombe&lt;/ref&gt; In 1821, approximately 49% of the nation's workforce was under the age of 20. Throughout the century, multiple items of legislation were written in to law limiting the age at which a child could enter work and ensuring mandatory standards of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/struggle_democracy/childlabour.htm |title=Exhibitions &amp;#124; Citizenship &amp;#124; Struggle for democracy |publisher=The National Archives |date= |accessdate=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, families that rely on the earning power of one parent have had a lower divorce rate than families where both parents are in gainful employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=D'Amico |first=Ronald |last2= |first2= |date=Jun 1983 |title=
Status Maintenance or Status Competition? Wife's Relative Wages as a Determinant of Labor Supply and Marital Instability |jstor=2578286|journal=Social Forces |publisher=Oxford University Press |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=1186–1205 |doi= 10.2307/2578286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==
One associated disadvantage is that 'male breadwinner regimes make women [[dependant|dependent]] within marriage cohabitation especially when they have young children'.&lt;ref name=Pascall&gt;{{citation  | last = Pascall | first = Gillian | contribution = Male breadwinner model | editor-last1 = Pascall | editor-first1 = Gillian | title = International encyclopedia of social policy | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2010 | isbn = 9780415576949 | ref = harv | display-editors=etal}} [http://cw.routledge.com/ref/socialpolicy/male.html Text.]&lt;/ref&gt; In societies where the breadwinner model is present, it is common for the non-earner (predominantly women) to have broken career paths, providing unpaid labour to the family or working part-time. This contributes to the fact that, on average, women obtain lower levels of lifetime earnings than men.&lt;ref name=Pascall/&gt; This [[income disparity]] can often lead to an increase in financial insecurity or poverty – predominantly affecting women – if the [[interpersonal relationship|relationship]] collapses. Another risk that has been identified with this has been a higher exposure to [[domestic violence]], which has been associated with the non-earner's lack of independent resources.&lt;ref name=Pascall/&gt;

==Decline of the male breadwinner==
In 2013 the UK female employment rate reached 67.2 per cent, the highest since the [[Office for National Statistics]]' records began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Dugan | first = Emily | title = Number of women in work in Britain hits record high – but figures show the gender pay gap is growing too | work = [[The Independent]] | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/more-women-have-jobs-in-britain-than-ever-before--but-figures-show-the-gender-pay-gap-is-rising-too-9139154.html | publisher = Independent Print Limited | date = 19 February 2014| accessdate = 30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As women's growing presence in the professional world has risen, as well as support for gender equality, male-female relations in the home have changed, especially the breadwinner paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Crompton | first = Rosemary | title = Restructuring gender relations and employment: the decline of the male breadwinner | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780198296089 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The breadwinner model was most prevalent during the 20-year period directly after [[World War II]]. During this time the economy relied heavily on men to financially support the family and to provide the main source of income, typically relying on women to stay at home and look after the children and undertaking [[domestic work]]. "Women's support for gender specialisation in marriage began to decline rapidly from the late 1970s through to the mid 1980s, this was followed by an interval of stability until the mid 1990s".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Cunningham | first = Mick | title = Changing attitudes toward the male breadwinner, female homemaker family model: Influences of women's employment and education over the lifecourse | journal = [[Social Forces]] | volume = 87 | issue = 1 | pages = 299–323 | publisher = Oxford Journals | doi = 10.1353/sof.0.0097 | date = September 2008  | jstor = 20430858 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; "As increasing proportions of women entered the paid labour market during the latter decades of the 20th century, the family model of a male breadwinner and female homemaker came under significant challenge both as a practice and an [[ideology]]".&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sayer | first1 = Liana C. | last2 = Bianchi | first2 = Suzanne M. | last3 = Robinson | first3 = John P. | title = Are parents investing less in children? Trends in mothers' and fathers' time with children | journal = [[American Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 110 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–43 | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | doi = 10.1086/386270 | jstor = 10.1086/386270 | date = July 2004 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There is now agreement in most literature that the breadwinner model, in which men take primary responsibility for earning and women for the unpaid work of care, has been substantially eroded.&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lewis | first = Jane | title = The decline of the male breadwinner model: The implications for work and care | journal = [[Social Politics]] | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 152–170 | publisher = Oxford Journals | doi = 10.1093/sp/8.2.152 | date = Summer 2001 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Nordic countries]] in particular have begun to adopt the dual-breadwinner model, with high employment rates among men and women, and a very small difference between men's and women's hours of work. With the exception of [[Denmark]], research by the [[World Economic Forum]] has shown that all Nordic countries have closed over 80 percent of the [[Gender pay gap|gender gap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report | last= World Economic Forum | author-link = World Economic Forum | date = 2013 | title = Insight Report: The Global Gender Gap Report 2013 | url = http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GenderGap_Report_2013.pdf | publisher = World Economic Forum, Switzerland | page = 103 | accessdate = 19 October 2014 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breadwinner mothers==
The female breadwinner model, otherwise known as "Breadwinner Moms",&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;{{cite report | last1 = Wang | first1 = Wendy | last2 = Parker | first2 = Kim | last3 = Taylor | first3 = Paul |title= Breadwinner moms, mothers are the sole or primary provider in four-in-ten households with children: Public conflicted about the growing trend | date = 29 May 2013 |journal= [[Pew Research Center]] | location = Washington, DC |url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2013/05/Breadwinner_moms_final.pdf | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; takes place when the female provides the main source of income for the family. Recent data from the US Census stated that "40% of all households with children under the age of 18 include mothers who are either the sole or primary source of income for the family". 37%&lt;ref name=Decline&gt;{{cite report | last = Pew Research Center | author-link = Pew Research Center | title= The decline of marriage and rise of new families |publisher= Pew Research Center|url= http://pewsocialtrends.org/2010/11/18/the-decline-of-marriage-and-rise-of-new-families/ | date = 19 November 2010 |accessdate= 18 October 2014 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; of these "Breadwinner Moms"&lt;ref name=Wang/&gt; are married mothers who have a higher income than their husbands, and 63%&lt;ref name=Decline/&gt; are single mothers.

==Issues with the decline of the breadwinner model==
Although there have been problems identified with the breadwinner model, there have also been issues noted in its decline. The decline of the breadwinner model has been accompanied by an erosion of various dimensions – [[sexual division of labour]], the economic support of family members, and the "distribution of time and regulation of marriage and parenthood".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Creighton | first = Colin | title = The rise and decline of the 'male breadwinner family' in Britain | journal = [[Cambridge Journal of Economics]] | volume = 23 | issue = 5 | pages = 519–541 | publisher = Oxford Journals | doi = 10.1093/cje/23.5.519 | jstor = 23599633 | date = September 1999  | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; With two parents in the workforce, there is a risk that a job could undermine family life, consequently leading to [[breakup|relationship breakdown]] or adversely affecting original family formation.

A recent study has found that "women's gains on the economic front may be contributing to a decline in the formation and stability of marriages". Although one reason for this may be that women with greater earning and [[economic security]] have more freedom to leave bad marriages, another possibility could be that men are more hesitant to this change in [[social norms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Thaler | first = Richard H. | author-link = Richard Thaler | title = Breadwinner wives and nervous husbands | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1 June 2013 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/business/breadwinner-wives-and-nervous-husbands.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; | publisher = [[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.]] | accessdate = 18 October 2014 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business Professionals of America''' ('''BPA''') is a [[career and technical student organization]] that is headquartered in [[Columbus, Ohio]].  BPA aims to develop leadership, academic, and technological skills in the workplace among students and leaders within the community.  BPA's colors are navy blue, tan, and red.&lt;ref name="traditions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bpa.org/information/pledgeetc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901170308/http://www.bpa.org/information/pledgeetc |archivedate=2010-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Officers at National, State, and Chapter Levels==

Every Business Professionals of America chapter has presiding officers for the national organization, state associations, and local chapters. They all share and carry out similar tasks at all levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bpa.org/c/ntckansasbpa/officerduties|title=BPA: Officer Duties {{!}} Northeast Technology Center-Kansas BPA {{!}} BPA.org|website=www.bpa.org|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of awards ==

BPA rewards members in three categories:
*Competitive Events: Members are rewarded for high placement in competitive events using the Workplace Skills Assessment Program (WSAP), preparing students for success in the business world by developing skills in areas such as finance, IT, and computer applications.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ctsos.org/ctsos/business-professionals-of-america/&lt;/ref&gt;
*BPA Cares Awards: Members can apply or nominate others for awards in the areas of Service Learning, Special Recognition, and Professional Awards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bpa.org/service/bpacares&lt;/ref&gt;
*Torch Awards: Members are rewarded for excellence in seven categories such as "Patriotism," "Leadership," "Love, Hope, and Faith," "Knowledge," "Cooperation," and "Friendship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bpa.org/awards/torch |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901170014/http://www.bpa.org/awards/torch |archivedate=2010-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership Conferences==
There are several levels of competition held at conferences and competition advancement is sought at each level in events referred to in the awards section.

*Regional Leadership Conference (RLC) or District Leadership Conference (DLC)
*State Leadership Conference (SLC)
*National Leadership Conference (NLC)

Many regions, districts, or states opt to also arrange Fall Leadership Conferences in which there is no competition. These conferences are usually less formal than at RLC/DLC, SLC, and NLC instead often focusing on workshops over areas such as social media etiquette, proper professional dress, public speaking, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indianabpa.org/flc.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228164358/http://indianabpa.org/flc.html |archivedate=2015-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Leadership Conference ==

Every year BPA hosts a National Leadership Conference (NLC) with nearly 6,000 students from across the nation. At NLC, students compete in over 71 competitive events with students from across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bpa.org/nlc&lt;/ref&gt; The 2017 National Leadership Conference took place in [[Orlando, Florida]]  from May 10 to May 14.
The 2018 National Leadership Conference will take place in [[Dallas, Texas]] on May 9 through May 13.

|1963
|[http://cte.unt.edu/about/cte-history-of-legislation Vocational Education Act] was passed. The need for a student organization for students enrolled in career/technical office/business programs was recognized.
|-
|1964
|American Vocational Association conducted a study of 43 states indicating that 67% of the state vocational education supervisors wanted a career/technical youth group for students in office/business programs.

|In July, the Vocational Office Education Clubs of America (VOECA) was formed by the states of Iowa, Kansas, and Wisconsin. In August, VOECA convened a meeting of youth group representatives to decide the most effective means to implement the office occupations youth group. After intensive effort, [[Articles of Incorporation|articles of incorporation]] were filed for the Office Education Association (OEA). The first three states to affiliate were Iowa, Kansas, and Wisconsin.

'''CARNET''' ('''Croatian Academic and Research Network''', {{lang-hr|Hrvatska akademska i istraživačka mreža}}) is the [[national research and education network]] of [[Croatia]]. It is funded from the government budget and it operates from offices in [[Zagreb]] and five other cities.

CARNet was established in 1991 as a project of [[Ministry of Science, Education and Sports (Croatia)|the Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of Croatia]]. In March 1995 the Government of the Republic of Croatia passed the Decree on founding of the CARNet institution with the purpose of facilitating progress of individuals, as well as of the [[society]] as a whole, through the use of new [[information technologies]].

CARNet's activities can be divided in three basic areas: [[Internet service]] provision, encouragement of [[information society]] development and education for the new era.

==History==

===The institution===
A body responsible for coordinating the establishment of the Croatian educational computer network has been established on 3 October 1991. That was the beginning of the work of the Croatian Academic and Research Network - CARNet, the first [[Internet Service Provider]] (ISP) in Croatia. In the several years that followed CARNet was the only [[Internet service provider]] in Croatia, providing the service [[free of charge]], not only to the [[academic community]], but to all citizens of the Republic of Croatia as well.

In November 1992 the first international communication connection was established, which connected CARNet [[Internet exchange point]] in Zagreb to Austria. By that act Croatia became a part of the world computer network – [[the Internet]].

During 1992, the first equipment was procured and the backbone of the CARNet network was built. Institutions in Croatia were connected at the speed of 19 - 200 kbit/s, while the whole network was connected to the Internet through Austria at the speed of 64 kbit/s.
The first institutions to be connected to the Internet were the University Computing Centre - [[Srce]], the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing in Zagreb, [[Ruđer Bošković Institute|the Ruđer Bošković Institute]], the Faculty of Science, [[Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture, University of Split|the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture in Split]], the Faculty of Engineering in Rijeka, the Faculty of Economics in Osijek and the Ministry of Science and Technology.

During the first months of 1993, CARNet was assigned the administration over the top-level [[.hr]] domain by the [[international organisation]] called the [[Internet Assigned Number Authority|Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA)]].
In October 1994, CARNet started offering the first Internet courses to its users and, in time, user education became one of CARNet’s most important activities.

===Network===
In 1996, the backbone of CARNet network was upgraded by introducing the ATM technology which enables real-time transfer of image and sound at the basic speed of 155 Mbit/s.

In January 1997, the first distance lecture in Croatia was organized through the CARNet ATM core between the Rectorate of the Osijek University and the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing in Zagreb.
[[GÉANT]], the pan-European academic and research network, was put into service on 1 December 2001, and CARNet, among others, connected to it.

In cooperation with the [[Srce|University Computing Centre - Srce]], in 2003 CARNet released the Giga CARNet project in order to use [[gigabit]] technologies to develop a high quality infrastructure for CARNet member institutions, faculties and research institutes. In the framework of the Giga CARNet project, in February 2004 CARNet was enabled, through the connection to the GÉANT network, to have a twice-faster connection to similar academic and research networks in Europe and all over the world (at the speed of 1.2 Gbit/s instead of the former 622 Mbit/s).

As a necessary requirement for further cooperation between CARNet and the world's academic and research communities, in June 2007 the speed of CARNet's connection towards the GÉANT network was increased to 10 Gbit/s.

Chronology &lt;ref name="Chronology1"&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801000000*/http://www.carnet.hr/chronology |date=August 1, 2010 |title=carnet.hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
[[File:CARNetovci.jpg|right|thumb|400px|CARNet employees]]
CARNet operates through services and projects integrated in eight departments:
* Network Infrastructure Department
* Computer and IT Systems and Services Department
* Computer Security Department
* National CERT Department
* User Support Department
* Education Support Department
* General and Financial Activities Department
* Office of the CEO

The [[CEO]] coordinates the activities at the level of the entire institution and outside it, acts on behalf of the institution and represents CARNet in public. CARNet [[Executive committee|Executive Committee]] consists of the CEO, the vice CEO and deputy CEOs (heads of the said departments). The Committee coordinates short- and long-term planning, makes decisions on business organisation and is responsible for the relations with the government bodies, users, partners and the public.

CARNet is run by the Managing Council which represents the interests of CARNet founders, the Government of the Republic of Croatia. Managing Council members are appointed by the Minister of Science, Education and Sports.

The Users Board is CARNet's advisory body consisting of all CARNet coordinators at CARNet member institutions as the representatives of the academic community, heads of county-level computer science councils as the representatives of [[school system]] users, and the CARNet CEO.

The total amount of budget funds allocated to CARNet was over 88.5 million [[Croatian kuna|HRK]] {{as of|2011|lc=on}} (ca. 12 million [[EUR]]).&lt;ref name="budget-2011"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mfin.hr/hr/drzavni-proracun-2011-godina | title = Državni proračun 2011. godina | publisher = [[Ministry of Finance (Croatia)]] | year = 2011 | accessdate = 2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrastructure==
[[File:CARNet infrastructure.png|alt= CARNet infrastructure|thumb|left| CARNet infrastructure]]Basic activities of the Croatian Academic and Research Network - CARNet are network development, building and maintenance. CARNet network is a private network of the Croatian academic, scientific and research community and the primary and secondary school system institutions.

Network infrastructure is owned by the CARNet institution, but cables are rented from a number of [[telecommunication]] providers. CARNet network is an example of a WAN network which enables CARNet members throughout Croatia to be connected into a compact information and [[communication system]].

CARNet network is a [[data network]] whose principal purpose is to transfer data through the TCP/IP protocol. The currently supported version of the TCP/IP protocol in the CARNet network as its integral part is version 4 (IPv4). The key characteristic of every private network is its connection to the global network - the Internet. The CARNet network established this connection through the GÉANT pan-European research network, with the current connection speed of 10 Gbit/s.  The connection to other Internet service providers in Croatia has been implemented through the Croatian Internet Exchange Point – CIX.

In Croatia, the CARNet network connects the major Croatian towns and cities on the [[mainland]] and a number of settlements on the islands.  The larger university centres ([[Dubrovnik]], [[Osijek]], [[Pula]], [[Rijeka]], [[Split, Croatia|Split]], [[Zadar]], Zagreb) have high speed connections (ranging from 155 Mbit/s to 1 Gbit/s), while smaller centres are connected at the speeds ranging from 2 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s. Zagreb has a particularly advanced infrastructure, connecting larger faculties and scientific institutions at the speeds of up to 10 Gbit/s. Thanks to the project "e-Split,", which CARNet has accomplished in cooperation with the City of Split, Split is the first city in which CARNet has its own optical network. Through that optical network 158 CARNet member institutions, in the city area, are connected to CARNet network.

More than 900 institutions from the primary and secondary school systems are also connected to the CARNet network via [[ADSL]] connections, and schools on Croatian islands have been connected to CARNet network in the framework of the e-Islands project.

==International cooperation==
As part of its vision of inclusion of the Republic of Croatia in modern information society, CARNet participates in a series of international activities.

Parallel with the increase of physical link speed on [[GEANT]] network, there is an increased development of CARNet's parallel (human) link towards European and international academic [[Internet community]]. CARNet activities in the sphere of [[Internationalism (politics)|international cooperation]] are forming a stable communication channel towards foreign countries, providing CARNet with an opportunity to present Croatia and its academic research community.

International cooperation includes following the activities of other academic networks in Europe and participating in the work of [[international organisations]] that gather national, educational, academic and research networks. CARNet also promotes the inclusion of the Croatian academic community into international projects in the field of information technologies research and application and coordinates the participation of CARNet [[employees]] in international projects.

CARNet is active member of several international organisations:

* [[TERENA|Trans - European Research and Education Networking Association]]
* [[ICANN|The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]]
* [[Réseaux IP Européens]]
* [[Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries|Council of European National Top-Level Domain Registries]]
* [[Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST)]]
* [[NREN|NREN Consortium]]

==Users==
CARNet users are member institutions and individual users.

CARNet member institutions are institutions belonging to the science and higher [[education system]], as well as those belonging to the primary and secondary school systems.  By obtaining the member status, institutions are connected to the CARNet network and entitled to use the CARNet services. CARNet has 241 member institutions from the academic community connected to the CARNet network at 418 locations. There are 1385 members from the primary and secondary school systems, connected at 1283 locations.

Individual users are higher education students and professors, scientists and persons employed in the academic and higher education community, primary and secondary school students, teachers and employees at primary and secondary schools and student homes.

At their respective central institution individual users obtain electronic identities in the AAI@EduHr system. Electronic identity is a virtual identity on the CARNet network which serves for user authentication and authorisation for different CARNet services and is necessary for the use of CARNet services.

The '''cephalonian method''' is a method of [[active learning]] for [[library instruction | library orientation]]  first made popular in the [[United Kingdom]] at [[Cardiff University]].  Introduced to a wider audience in 2004 by Linda Davies and Nigel Morgan, the method consists of giving the students at a library orientation class cards with prepared questions they are to ask during the session for the instructor to answer. Questions are grouped into categories and colour coded to provide some structure; the order of the questions in any section is based on the order the students choose to stand up which makes the sessions more random and reduces the repetitive nature of library induction / orientation. However, it may be more appropriate for first year students than more senior students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ojs.lboro.ac.uk/ojs/index.php/JIL/article/view/PRA-V3-I1-2009-3 |title= Teaching information skills to large groups with limited time and resources							|work= Journal of Information Literacy, ojs.lboro.ac.uk |accessdate=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is taken from a method used for orientation of tourists at a popular resort in [[Cephalonia]], Greece.

==History==
Code.org was launched in January 2013 by Iranian-American brothers Hadi Partovi and [[Ali Partovi]], as a non-profit focused on making computer programming more accessible. The initial focus was on creating a database of all computer science classrooms in the United States.&lt;ref name=launch-techcrunch&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/22/code-org-launches-to-help-make-computer-programming-accessible-to-everyone/|title=Code.org Launches To Help Make Computer Programming Accessible To Everyone|last = Olanoff|first = Drew|publisher = ''[[TechCrunch]]''|date = January 22, 2013|accessdate = January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Hadi Partovi stated that about ninety percent of US schools do not teach programming, despite it now being a "foundational field".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-225563685.html |title= Several leading names in tech are urging California Governor Jerry Brown to make a meaningful investment in computer science and education |publisher=CBS This Morning |date=May 7, 2014 |author=NORAH O`DONNELL, MICHELLE MILLER, GAYLE KING}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for the organization came from Hadi, who states that he thought of it on the day of [[Steve Jobs]]' death in 2011 while mulling over his own potential legacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-225468893.html |title=Steve Jobs' Death Inspired Goal To Get Kids Coding |publisher=NPR Tell Me More |author=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, Hadi worked full-time to bring the organization to fruition.&lt;ref name=launch-techcrunch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jahandad-memarian/hadi-partovis-american-dr_b_8012066.html |publisher=Huffington Post |author=Jahandad Memarian |title= Hadi Partovi's American Dream: Making Coding Available to All |date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=launch-geekosystem&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geekosystem.com/code-dot-org-launch/|title = Code.org Says "Hello, World" to Get Everybody Coding|last = Tickle|first = Glen|publisher = ''[[Geekosystem]]''|date = January 22, 2013|accessdate = January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, Canadian Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] helped launch the international Hour of Code campaign for 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/12/05/trudeau-joins-campaign-encouraging-youth-to-study-computer-science.html|title=Trudeau joins campaign encouraging youth to study computer science {{!}} Toronto Star|website=thestar.com|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
And in December 2017, Code.org announced the Hour of Code had reached over 500 million hours served.

==Curriculum efforts==
The first step in the organization's efforts as regards the curriculum of schools was to work with US school districts to add computer programming as a class. Most US schools did not have a course code for computer sciences, in order for schools to be able to offer coding as a class. After this, the next step was to create free online teaching and learning materials for schools to use if instituting computer science classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=znnzCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT90 |page=90 |title=Every Gift Matters: How Your Passion Can Change the World |author=Carrie Morgridge |publisher=Greenleaf Book Group |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014, Code.org had launched computer courses in thirty US school districts to reach about 5% of all the students in US public schools (about two million students),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://venturebeat.com/2014/04/24/code-org-is-doing-what-local-governments-arent-bringing-computer-science-into-public-schools/ |publisher=VentureBeat |date=April 24, 2014 |title= Code.org gets serious, launches computer science programs in 30 public school districts |author=KIA KOKALITCHEVA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 2015, Code.org had trained about 15,000 teachers to teach computer sciences, able to reach about 600,000 new students previously unable to learn computer coding, with large percentages of those being either female or minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/09/10/codeorg-hadi-partovi-computer-science-back--school-kids-teachers-women-minorities/71905738/ |publisher=USA Today |date=September 10, 2015 |title= Code.org trains 15,000 teachers in computer science |author=Jessice Guynn}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, Code.org has prepared over 72,000 educators to teach computer science.

That year Code.org was partnered with about seventy of the largest US school districts (including each of the seven largest), representing several million students. The company also partnered with other computer class businesses and private entities to provide additional computer learning materials and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.geekwire.com/2015/code-org-inks-11-new-partnerships-to-help-expand-computer-science-education/ |publisher=Geek Wire |title= Code.org inks 11 new partnerships to help expand computer science education  |author=TAYLOR SOPER |date=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/08/code-org-launches-u-s-teacher-training-program-in-districts-with-highest-diversity/|title=Code.org Launches U.S. Teacher Training Program In Districts With Highest Diversity|author=Sarah Buhr|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, six million students had been enrolled in Code.org curriculum classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2015-09-kids-language-code.html|title=Want your kids to learn another language? Teach them code|work=phys.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Code.org partnered with College Board, in order to develop a slate of advanced placement computer classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/05/14/codeorg-college-board-computer-science-high-school-diversity/27304593/|title=Code.org targets high school computer science|date=14 May 2015|work=USA TODAY}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main platform used in Code.org instruction is Code Studio&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sdtimes.com/code-studio-reaches-milestone-codenow-box-google-cloud-trace-sd-times-news-digest-jan-9-2015/#ixzz3OLzpBszk|title=Code Studio reaches a milestone, CodeNow in a Box, and Google Cloud Trace—SD Times news digest: Jan. 9, 2015|work=SD Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; which according to TechCrunch, "teaches the underlying concepts in programming through the manipulation of blocks of logic that when stacked together in a particular order, move a character around a scene or draw a shape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/11/code-org-launches-code-studio-a-toolset-and-curriculum-for-teaching-kids-programming/|title=Code.org Launches Code Studio, A Toolset And Curriculum For Teaching Kids Programming|author=Kyle Russell|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Code.org celebrated record participation by girls and underrepresented minorities in AP computer science classrooms, driven in large part by students in the Code.org [https://code.org/educate/csp CS Principles] classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2018/08/27/female-minority-students-took-ap-computer-science-record-numbers/1079699002/ |publisher=USA Today |title= Female, minority students took AP computer science in record numbers |author = RYAN SUPPE |date= August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative efforts==
One of the main lobbying efforts of Code.org in state legislatures is to ensure that computer classes are not registered as foreign language classes, but as science classes, in order to ensure that more than coding is taught in computer courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.geekwire.com/2015/code-org-takes-sides-dueling-bills-promoting-computer-science-washington-state/ |publisher=Geek Wire |title= Code.org takes sides on dueling bills promoting computer science in Washington State |author=FRANK CATALANO |date= February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Code.org also focuses specifically on female and minority students, as the organization believes these are the students most at risk of not receiving computer science education before high school or college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://time.com/3595217/frozen-anna-elsa-let-it-code-tech-gender-gap/ |publisher=Time Magazine |title= Frozen's Anna and Elsa 'Let It Code' to Close the Tech Gender Gap |author=Eliana Dockterman  |date=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
According to its website, Code.org has the following goals:&lt;ref name=about/&gt;
* Bringing Computer Science classes to every [[K–12]] school in the United States, especially in urban and rural neighborhoods.
* Demonstrating the successful use of online curriculum in public school classrooms
* Changing policies in all 50 states to categorize C.S. as part of the math/science "core" curriculum
* Harnessing the collective power of the tech community to celebrate and grow C.S. education worldwide
* Increasing the representation of women and students of color in the field of Computer Science.
* Increasing their global outreach by making their courses available in more than 45 languages that are used in over 180 countries.

==Reception==
Writing for ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', Mike Cassidy praised Code.org and the Hour of Code, writing: "A publicity stunt is what we need."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/mike-cassidy/ci_24712130/cassidy-code-org-hour-code-builds-deeper-understanding|title = Hour of Code builds a deeper understanding of the power of computing|last = Cassidy|first = Mike|date = December 12, 2013|accessdate = January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dvorak]] was critical of the Hour of Code in an article for ''[[PC Magazine]]''. Dvorak wrote: "I see it as a ploy to sell more computers in schools."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2428466,00.asp|title = The Hidden Agenda of Code.org|last= Dvorak|first = John C.|date = December 18, 2013|accessdate = January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contingent work''' or '''casual work''' is an [[employment]] relationship which is considered non-permanent. These jobs are typically [[part time]] (typically with variable hours), have limited [[job security]], and result in payment on a [[piece work]] basis. Contingent work is usually not considered to be a [[career]] or part of a career. One of the features of contingent work is that it usually offers little or no opportunity for [[career development]]. Contingent workers are also often called [[freelancer]]s, independent professionals, temporary contract workers, "[[Temporary work|temps]]", [[independent contractor]]s, or consultants.&lt;ref name=InformIT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=437082&amp;seqNum=8 |accessdate=30 November 2016 |title=Workforce Planning and Employment |date=19 December 2005 |website=InformIT |publisher=Pearson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/conemp.nr0.htm |accessdate=30 November 2016 |title=Contingent and Alternative Employment Arrangements, February 2005 |publisher=US Bureau of Labor Statistics |date=July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Contingent work''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10359-gig-economy-trends.html|title=The Growth of the Gig Economy: A Look at American Freelancers|last=Fallon|first=Nicole|date=|work=Business News Daily|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=December 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is not an entirely neutral term as commentators who use the phrase generally consider it to be a [[social injustice|social problem]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} [[Employment agency|Employment agencies]] and [[classified advertising]] media are more likely to use the phrase ''casual work'', particularly to attract [[student]]s who wish to earn money during the [[summer vacation]] but who would not consider the work as part of a long-term career. All casual work is considered to be contingent work, but not all contingent work is casual. In particular, part time jobs, or jobs in organisations that have a high staff turnover, may be considered contingent work but may not be casual.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==History==
===Industrial Revolution===
The concept of what is now considered to be a ''job'', where one attends work at fixed hours was rare until the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Before then, the predominant regular work was in [[agriculture]]. [[Textile]] workers would often work from home, buying raw [[cotton]] from a [[merchant]], [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] it and [[weaving]] it into [[cloth]] at home, before selling it on.

In the 1770s, [[cotton mills]] started to appear in [[Lancashire]], [[England]], using [[Richard Arkwright]]'s [[spinning jenny]] and powered by [[water wheel]]s. Workers would often work in twelve-hour shifts, six days a week. However, they would still often be paid on a [[piece work]] basis, and [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] would be deducted from their pay for damage to [[machinery]]. Employers could [[recruitment|hire]] and [[termination of employment|fire]] pretty much as they pleased, and if employees had any [[grievance]] about this, there was very little that they could do about it.

===Trade union movement===
Individual workers were powerless to prevent exploitation by their employers. However, the realisation that all workers generally want the same things, and the benefits of [[collective bargaining]], led to the formation of the first [[trade union]]s. As trade unions became larger, their [[sphere of influence]] increased, and started to involve [[political]] [[lobbying]], resulting in much of the [[employment law]] that is now taken for granted.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

===20th century decline in manufacture===
[[Manufacture|Manufacturing]] has declined during the 20th century in the [[Western world]]. Many manufacturing organisations that employ large numbers of people have relocated their operations to [[developing nations]]. As a result, whenever they do hire staff in [[Europe]] or [[North America]], they often need to be able to fire them quickly and keep costs as low as possible, to remain [[competitive]]. As a result, some employers may look for [[loophole]]s in employment law, or ways of engaging staff that allows them to circumvent union-negotiated employment law, creating what is now known as contingent work.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Trends==

According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the nontraditional workforce includes "multiple job holders, contingent and [[part-time]] workers, and people in alternative work arrangements".&lt;ref name="Futurework"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/ooq/2000/Summer/art04.pdf |title=Futurework |website=Occupational Outlook Quarterly |publisher=US Bureau of Labor Statistics |date=September 1999 |page=36 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615142248/http://www.bls.gov/opub/ooq/2000/Summer/art04.pdf |archivedate=15 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These workers currently represent a substantial portion of the US workforce, and "nearly four out of five employers, in establishments of all sizes and industries, use some form of nontraditional staffing". "People in alternative work arrangements" includes [[independent contractor]]s, employees of contract companies, workers who are on call, and temporary workers.&lt;ref name="Futurework"/&gt;

===Drivers of growth===

Among several other contributing factors, [[globalization]] has had a large impact on the growth in using contingent labor. Globalization contributes to rapid growth in industries, increased outsourcing, and a need for flexibility and agility to remain competitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innovativeemployeesolutions.com/knowledge/articles_04/04-article-01.html |title=Ten important issues and trends shaping human resources in 2004 |first=Elizabeth |last=Rice |publisher=Innovative Employee Solutions |date=2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322092505/http://www.innovativeemployeesolutions.com/knowledge/articles_04/04-article-01.html |archivedate=22 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By engaging contract workers, organizations are able to be agile and save costs.  The contingent workforce acts as a variable workforce for companies to select from to perform specific projects or complete specialized projects.&lt;ref name=BoA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpsgroup.com/vNews/mpsgroup/presentations/BankofAmerica/BOA_20040601.pdf |title=Banc of America Securities Conference |publisher=[[MPS Group]] |date=July 2004 |page=21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009191308/http://www.mpsgroup.com/vNews/mpsgroup/presentations/BankofAmerica/BOA_20040601.pdf |archivedate=9 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also as organizations make efforts to be more agile and to quickly respond to change in order to be more competitive, they turn to the contingent workforce to have on-demand access to professionals and experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/careers/content/may2007/ca20070523_580432.htm?campaign_id=rss_null |title=The Contingent Workforce |publisher=Business Week |date=23 May 2007 |first=Marshall |last=Goldsmith |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519010225/http://www.businessweek.com/careers/content/may2007/ca20070523_580432.htm?campaign_id=rss_null |archivedate=19 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Organizations also see the opportunity to reduce benefits and retirement costs by engaging the contingent workforce.&lt;ref name=BoA/&gt;  However, there is risk involved in avoiding these costs if an employee is improperly classified as  a contingent worker. Using the contingent workforce is also cost-effective in that using contingent labor allows for adjustments to employment levels and employment costs depending on what kind of expertise and labor is need and at what time it is needed.

Trends in the contingent workforce are also impacted by the economy.  A study conducted by the MPS Group shows the relationship between the contingent labor cycle and the state of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpsgroup.com/vNews/mpsgroup/presentations/BankofAmerica/BOA_20040601.pdf |title=Banc of America Securities Conference |publisher=[[MPS Group]] |date=July 2004 |page=10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009191308/http://www.mpsgroup.com/vNews/mpsgroup/presentations/BankofAmerica/BOA_20040601.pdf |archivedate=9 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[bullish]] economy, the demand for contingent labor is strong.  This is most likely because organizations are trying to grow with the economy, and using contingent workers allows them to work with experts when needed, without the long-term costs of hiring them.

A knowledge-driven economy also contributes to the growth in the use of the contingent workforce because organizations rely more on their specific and expert knowledge and expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humancapitalinstitute.org/hci/tracks_contingent_workforce_management.guid |title=Contingent Workforce Management |publisher=The Human Capital Institute |date=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716015323/http://www.humancapitalinstitute.org/hci/tracks_contingent_workforce_management.guid |archivedate=16 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As demand increases for highly skilled and knowledgeable people, the expertise of contract workers becomes more attractive.

===Occupational safety and health===

Contingent workers are at a high risk of being injured or killed on the job. In 2015, 829 fatal injuries (17% of all occupational fatalities) occurred among contract workers, which only represent a subset of contingent workers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/cfoi_09172015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also shown a higher burden of non-fatal occupational injuries and illnesses among contingent workers compared to those in standard employment arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Virtanen|first=Marianna|last2=Kivimäki|first2=Mika|last3=Joensuu|first3=Matti|last4=Virtanen|first4=Pekka|last5=Elovainio|first5=Marko|last6=Vahtera|first6=Jussi|date=2005-06-01|title=Temporary employment and health: a review|url=https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/34/3/610/682271/Temporary-employment-and-health-a-review|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|volume=34|issue=3|pages=610–622|doi=10.1093/ije/dyi024|issn=0300-5771}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benavides|first=F.

This term was made popular by [[Douglas Coupland]]'s novel [[Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture]], and stems from the notion that jobs in [[McDonald's]] and other [[fast food]] and [[retail]] [[business]]es are frequently insecure.

==Criticisms==
Critics say that it is unfair to tarnish all [[employment agency|employment agencies]] with the brush of contingent work.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Some say that temporary work patterns such as [[self-employment]], [[consultancy]] and [[telecommuting]] can bring benefits of [[labour market flexibility|flexibility]] not just to employers but also employees, can improve work-life balance, and can make it easier for workers to manage [[family]] responsibilities. However, it is argued{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} that such benefits are realised only in [[middle class]] jobs, whose [[entry barrier]]s are too high for most workers with below-average earnings.

'''Edward Niesen''' was born in [[Chicago]] on June 4, 1908 and died March 12, 1974 in [[Delhi]], India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stx.edu.np/more_history.html |title=St. Xavier's School History |publisher=Stx.edu.np |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an American [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Catholic priest|priest]], [[missionary]] in India&lt;ref&gt;http://www.familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/v/o/g/Julie-M.../UHP-0293.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nepal]] where he taught in several schools, amongst them the [[St. Xavier's High School, Patna]], the [[St. Xavier's School, Godavari|Godavari St. Xavier's]], [[Kathmandu]] and [[St. Xavier's School, Delhi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jesuitoralhistory.org/text/70DRESSM.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Joining the [[Society of Jesus]] on 20 September 1926, he arrived in India in 1933. He completed his studies at St. Mary’s, Kurseong. After tertianship, he joined Fr. [[Marshall D. Moran]] in the founding of [[St. Xavier's High School, Patna]], where he initially worked as vice-principal &amp; hostel superintendent. Fr. Niesen could teach several subjects including mathematics and was an able administrator. During his time at St. Xavier's High School, Patna, students performed extremely well academically and won distinctions of various sorts like Rhodes Scholarships.

In 1949, when Fr. Moran went to [[Nepal]], Niesen took charge as principal of [[St. Xavier's High School, Patna]]. Fr. Niesen introduced the house system at St. Xavier's High School, Patna in which the boys were divided into four houses- Lions, Leopards, Tigers &amp; Panthers. The houses competed against each other in sports and other extra-curricular activities. The system exists at St. Xavier's High School, Patna to this very day and was also replicated at [[St. Xavier's School, Godavari|Godavari St. Xavier's]], where Niesen later moved. A great sports man himself, Niesen encouraged his students to participate in sports. He formed leagues in all sports and there were tournaments organised throughout the school year that culminated in Annual Sports Day.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1994"&gt;{{citation |date=Nov 2013 |title=Edward Niesen |accessdate= |url=|periodical=We Band of Brothers- Volume 1'', The Patna Jesuit Society, Patna, 1994, Page 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1954, Godavari St. Xavier's was well established and another school at Jawalakhel had been opened for the primary students. Niesen moved to Nepal to take up the work of principal of Godavari High School and superior of the Jesuits in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucanews.com/story-archive/?post_name=/1996/07/08/jesuits-key-players-in-building-sports-in-nepal&amp;post_id=7787 |title=jesuits key players in building sports in nepal |publisher=ucanews.com |date=1996-07-08 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also continued the task of teaching mathematics in all the senior classes. Later, Fr. Niesen moved to Jawalakhel to take over the junior school and built the "new" building at Jawalakhel, one of the first structures in Nepal using the then novel reinforced concrete pillars and slabs.&lt;ref name="nepaljesuits1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nepaljesuits.org/nepal-jesuit-society/jesuits-in-memory/fr-edward-niesen-sj/ |title=Nepal Jesuit Society » Fr. Edward Niesen, S.J |publisher=Nepaljesuits.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fr. Niesen suffered from asthama, and later emphysema.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1994"/&gt; By 1968 Fr. Niesen’s health had deteriorated, he was asked by the provincial to move to Delhi to take over the junior section of [[St. Xavier's School, Delhi]], where he put all his skills to good use to build up that school, a task he continued until his death in March 1974.&lt;ref name="nepaljesuits1"/&gt;

The '''Euclid Consortium''' is a [[distance learning]] educational consortium created in 2005 by the [[University of Bangui]] ([[Central African Republic]]), the [[Université Libre Internationale]] ([[Belgium]]), and the [[International Organization for Sustainable Development]]. The original name was Euclid University Consortium, but the structure was renamed in December 2008 in order to avoid confusion with [[EUCLID (university)|EUCLID University]], which is a member of the consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euclid.int/legal.asp |title=EUCLID (Euclid University) – Origins and Legal Status |publisher=Euclid.int |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History, membership and programs ==
The Euclid initiative began in June 2004 as a cooperative project between the Human Bioethics Treaty Organization and the Embassy of the Central African Republic in Washington, DC. This led to the formalization of an educational extension project with the University of Bangui and the private Université Libre Internationale of Brussels (Belgium) as co-founders. In January 2006, the agreements were revised and transferred with the formation of IOSD (the [[International Organization for Sustainable Development]]) and the participation of the Université Libre du Burkina alongside ULI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euclidconsortium.eu/euclid/en/essentials.asp |title=Origins and Legal Foundations |publisher=Euclidconsortium.eu |date=11 July 2002 |accessdate=24 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420140235/http://www.euclidconsortium.eu/euclid/en/essentials.asp |archivedate=20 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of N'Djamena]] (UNDT, Chad), became a full member of the consortium in May 2006, adding the institutional recognition of its IAU ([[International Association of Universities]]) member status and the approval of its Ministry of Education to the initiative. In 2007, the [[Gaston Berger University]] of Senegal announced its intention to participate in the consortium and confirmed the same in 2008.

The Consortium organizes online degree programs on behalf of the member schools and manages other joint academic initiatives of interest to the participating universities. The programs are offered in French and English, notably in Diplomacy, Sustainable Development and Religious Studies, which are structured after the [[Bologna Process]] (including [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation|ECTS]] and [[Diploma Supplement]]) in order to follow both [[European Union]] and United States guidelines.

== Structure and organization ==
The consortium's educational programs are managed by 4 academic units called schools:
* The John Jay School of Diplomacy and International Affairs
* The Blaise Pascal School of Computing and Sciences
* The John Locke School of Business and Economics
* The Pavel Florensky School of Theology and Ministry
* The Euclid School of Education Development

Since 2009, the programs are directly managed by EUCLID (University), and the original academic units were absorbed in EUCLID. However, EUCLID University is not a recognised degree-granting institution. 

The Euclid Consortium is headed by a high steward, the ambassador of the [[Central African Republic]] to the United States, His Excellency Emmanuel Touaboye and an executive president, Mr. Syed Zahid Ali, who is also the secretary-general of EUCLID (Euclid University).

Academic oversight is under the responsibility of the oversight council, whose co-chairmen are the rectors of the participating universities.

== Member universities ==
* EUCLID (University), primary institution since 2008
* University of N'Djamena, joint degree-granting institution in some cases
* University of Bangui, joint degree-granting institution in some cases
* ULI (Brussels) +
* Université Libre du Burkina +
* Université Gaston Berger +
* Université des Comores +

+ Consortium members but not joint degree granters

== Accreditation process and institutional evolution ==
This inter-university initiative was originally named "Pôle d'Extension Universitaire Euclide" and the name "Euclid University" was initially used as a short translation of the French name, hence giving the unintentional impression that the extension consortium was intended to be a free-standing, degree-granting institution. This technical and legal issue led to recognition problems in the English-speaking world. In order to correct this situation, the official English name was amended to "Euclid University Consortium" to emphasize the fact that Euclid was originally designed as a consortium, not a free-standing university with its own charter and degrees. In January 2009, the name was further changed to "Euclid Consortium."

Because the international directory of [[UNESCO]] does not list inter-institutional consortia, the registration of the extension initiative was done under the entry for the universities of N'Djamena and Bangui.

Hence, the Consortium's recognition is tied to the recognition of the member universities, two of which are the actual degree granters, since the consortium itself has no direct degree-granting authority.

In December 2006, IOSD signed an agreement with the Islamic Chamber of Commerce and Industry, an affiliated institution of the 57 member-state [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]], establishing the recognition of its programs and applicable accreditations.

In 2008, the need for the consortium to obtain an autonomous charter and direct governmental accreditation led to the introduction of a multilateral [[Memorandum of Understanding]] which was approved by four initial Participating States. This intergovernmental agreement formalized the constitution of [[EUCLID (University)]] as an intergovernmental university framework with legal personality. This initial agreement was succeeded by a revised framework agreement, and both indicated that EUCLID would also become a member of the Euclid Consortium which remains an active partnership.

'''FOSS''' ('''Full-Option Science System''') is a research-based science curriculum for grades K—8 developed at the [[Lawrence Hall of Science]], [[University of California, Berkeley]]. FOSS is also an ongoing research project dedicated to improving the learning and teaching of science.

==History==
The FOSS K–8 program was developed at the [[Lawrence Hall of Science]], [[University of California at Berkeley]], under three separate [[National Science Foundation]] grants (1988&lt;ref&gt;FOSS Grades 3–6, NSF Grant MDR-8751727, July 1988 to March 1992&lt;/ref&gt; 1991,&lt;ref&gt;FOSS Grades K–2, NSF Grant MDR-9150097, July 1991 to Dec. 1994&lt;/ref&gt; 1996.&lt;ref&gt;FOSS for Middle School, NSF Grant ESI-9553600, Sept. 1996 to Aug. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;)  The program was originally developed and trial tested in urban and suburban [[San Francisco Bay Area]] school districts and field-tested and implemented nationally in ten sites.  Twenty-six modules were developed for K–6, and nine courses for middle school. The FOSS K–6 program went through a major revision in 2000 and was then adopted in Texas. The program went through a minor revision in 2005. A new, California specific, edition was developed for the California science adoption (K–5) in 2007. FOSS is currently published by Delta Education, a division of School Specialty Inc.

==Pedagogy==
The FOSS program uses several instructional pedagogies: [[inquiry-based learning]] (each investigation is guided by questions), hands-on learning and active investigation (students work with materials and conduct investigations to attempt to answer questions), student-to-student interaction, writing (students keep careful notes in science notebooks), and research/reading (readings are included to enhance or underscore active investigation—students work with materials prior to doing any reading).

==Components==
Each K–6 module consists of a kit of student materials, a teacher guide, and a student reading book. Each middle school course includes a kit of student materials, a teacher guide, a Science Resources book, a lab notebook, and a course-specific multimedia component. The FOSS website, FOSSweb, contains additional online activities for students and resources for parents and teachers. FOSSweb has two sister sites, FOSSweb CA, for the California 2007 edition, and FOSSweb NYC, for New York City teachers using FOSS.

==Program Use and Adoption==
FOSS is in use in every state in the country with over 100,000 teachers and 2 million students and is in approximately 16% of the nation's school districts.  FOSS was the first non-textbook curriculum to make the California adoption list (1992) and was adopted in California for the 2007 science adoption (FOSS California K–5).  The program is on many state adoption lists and is used in 50 of the 100 largest U.S. school districts.  FOSS is cited as an exemplary program in publications by nationally recognized organizations in the science reform movement, including National Science Resources Center,&lt;ref&gt;Resources for Teaching Elementary Science, 1996; Science for All Children, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Science Teachers Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Pathways to the National Standards, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

FOSS has been approved as a recommended science program in each of the adoption states in which it has been submitted.

[[File:SSJ100 FFS 1 (9318513805).jpg|thumb|A [[Sukhoi SuperJet]] full flight simulator]]
'''Full flight simulator''' (FFS) is a term used by national (civil) aviation authorities (NAA) for a high technical level of [[flight simulator]]. Such authorities include the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) in the United States and the [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] (EASA).

There are currently four levels of full flight simulator, levels A - D, level D being the highest standard and being eligible for zero flight time (ZFT) training of civil pilots when converting from one airliner type to another. In about 2012, these FFS levels will be changed as a result of work by an international working group chaired by the UK Royal Aeronautical Society Flight Simulation Group (RAeS FSG), which rationalised 27 previous categories of flight training device into 7 international ones.  This work has been accepted by ICAO and is published under ICAO document 9625 Issue 3.  The new Type 7 Full Flight Simulator will be the old Level D with enhancements in a number of areas including motion, visual and Communications/air traffic simulations.

A Level D/Type 7 simulator simulates all aircraft systems that are accessible from the flight deck and are critical to training.  For instance, accurate force feedback for the pilot's flight controls is provided through a simulator system called "control loading", and other systems such as avionics, communications and "glass cockpit" displays are also simulated.

This standard of simulator is used both for initial and recurrent training for commercial air transport (CAT) aircraft.  Initial training is for conversion to a new aircraft type, and recurrent training is that which all commercial pilots must carry out at regular intervals (such as every six months) in order to retain their qualification to fly "fare-paying passengers" in CAT aircraft, loosely "airliners".

A Level D/Type 7 FFS also provides motion feedback to the crew through a motion platform upon which the simulator cabin is mounted.  The motion platform must produce accelerations in all of the six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) that can be experienced by a body that is free to move in space, using a principle called [[acceleration onset cueing]], generally using the [[Stewart platform]] design.

==Collimated Cross-Cockpit Displays==

[[File:Collimation - diagram and real sim.jpg|thumb|400px|Diagram of collimated display system and a real flight simulator]]

The display system that shows imagery of the out-the-window (OTW) world to the pilots, is generally designed so that the imagery appears at a distant focus. This is called a [[collimated]] display, a word derived from "co-linear".  The reason is so that each of two pilots, sitting side by side, can see essentially the same OTW imagery without angular errors or distortions.  If a simple projection screen were used instead of a collimated display, each pilot would see the  OTW at different angles.

The error angle (parallax) for a simple, non-collimated projection can be estimated in the following manner:

&lt;math&gt;\varphi\approx\arctan\,(l / R)&lt;/math&gt; , where

'''''l''''' — lateral distance between the pilots,

'''''R''''' — distance from the pilot's head to screen.

So at '''''l''''' =1.5 m and '''''R''''' =5 m angle &lt;math&gt;\varphi\approx17^\circ&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Beirut Universitet Haigazian.jpg|thumb|Part of the Haigazian University campus]]
'''Haigazian University''' ({{lang-hy|Հայկազեան Համալսարան}}, pronounced ''Haygazyan Hamalsaran''; {{lang-ar|جامعة هايكازيان}}) is a higher education institution founded in 1955 in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] as '''Haigazian College'''. For a brief period starting 1992, name was changed to '''Haigazian University College''' before adopting the present name in 1996. It offers programs leading to [[Bachelor's degree]]s in the Arts and Sciences as well as  Business Administration and Economics, in addition to  [[Master's degree]]s in the Arts, Sciences and Business Administration. English is the main language of instruction, although some courses are offered in Armenian and Arabic. All degrees from Haigazian are recognized by the Lebanese government and the Association of International Colleges and Universities. It is supported by the [[Armenian Evangelical Church|Armenian Evangelical]] community, and was established primarily to meet the needs of the large [[Armenians in Lebanon|Lebanese-Armenian]] population. However, the university is open to all students, regardless of race, nationality, or creed, and has professors and student body from all sections of Lebanese society.

== History ==

===Beginnings===
Haigazian University is named in honor of Dr. [[Armenag Haigazian]] ({{lang-hy|Արմենակ Հայկազյան}}), former headmaster of the [[Jenanian Apostolic Institute of Konya]], [[Turkey]]. Dr. Haigazian was a highly respected educator who received his Ph.D. from Yale University and returned to Turkey to serve his Armenian compatriots. When the genocide of the Armenians began, Dr. Haigazian had the opportunity to escape to the United States, but he chose to stay and continue his ministry. Later, he, along with many Armenian intellectuals, was rounded up to be driven into the Syrian desert. Dr. Haigazian died on the way in the prison of Kharpert in 1921 (''New York Times'' article).
Concurrently, eight Armenian colleges were also destroyed in Turkey. Although these aspects of education and service were brought to an end, the dream continued in the minds of Dr. Haigazian's descendants and others. The Mehagian family (Mary Mehagian and Florence Mehagian-Guertmenian) of Phoenix, Arizona, close relatives of Dr. Haigazian, donated capital through the AMAA and worked hand in hand with Stephen Philibosian to get Haigazian College started.
The University was founded on October 17, 1955, by the Union of Armenian Evangelical Churches in the Near East (UAECNE) and the Armenian Missionary Association of America (AMAA) as a liberal arts college to assist in the preparation of teachers and pastors.

Prior to this date, the Armenian Evangelical community of Beirut, to complement its high schools and the Teacher Training needs, had established two post-secondary educational programs: the Teacher's Training Institute, which was housed in the library of the Central High School and operated from 1948–51, and the Armenian Evangelical College, which held a Freshman Arts and Sciences program under the sponsorship of the First Armenian Evangelical Church of Beirut. These two entities merged in 1951 forming a Freshman Arts and Sciences plus a Sophomore Arts program, and they continued to serve the Armenian Community until 1955, when Haigazian College was established.

===Haigazian College (1955-1992)===
Haigazian College was originally designed to function as a junior college offering two years of university-level education. However, a demand for upper-division classes encouraged the institution to develop four year programs.

The university was founded on October 17, 1955, by [[the Union of the Armenian Evangelical Churches in the Near East]] (UAECNE) and the [[Armenian Missionary Association of America]] (AMAA) as a liberal arts college to assist in the preparation of teachers and pastors. When the University opened in 1955, there were 43 students enrolled. Student enrollment reached 740 before the start of the civil disturbances in Lebanon in 1975.

On October 17, 1955 Haigazian University was established in Beirut, Lebanon by the joint endeavors of the Armenian Missionary Association of America (AMAA) and the Union of the Armenian Evangelical Churches in the Near East (UAECNE).

The university was first located in the Webb Building, a ten-room house converted for college use. Later, a seven-story building was added. This building was called the Mehagian Academic Centre in honor of Mr. and Mrs. A. S. Mehagian, whose financial support made its construction possible. A grant from Mr. [[Stephen P. Mugar]] enabled the university to acquire a beautiful historic structure, subsequently named the Mugar Building, to honor the donor’s parents.

Haigazian College was originally designed to function as a junior college offering two years of university-level education. However, a demand for upper-division classes encouraged the institution to develop four-year programs.

Haigazian operated under its original name of "College" until 1991.

===Haigazian University College (1992-1996)===
In keeping with Near Eastern nomenclature, the name was changed to Haigazian University College in 1992.

===Haigazian University (1996-present)=== 
On December 28, 1996, the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education of Lebanon issued decree number 9657, which authorized the institution to change its name to Haigazian University.
Dr. John Markarian, the first president of the University, served until June 1966. During the years 1967 to 1971, Dr. Gilbert Bilezikian held this position; then Dr. Markarian returned to the post until his retirement in June 1982. Subsequently, the presidency was held by Dr. Verne H. Fletcher until February 1985. Miss Wilma Cholakian, the administrative dean, was then responsible for the operation of the University until August 30, 1995. Dr. John Khanjian served as president from September 1, 1995, until August 1, 2002. On September 1, 2002, Rev. Dr. Paul Haidostian became president.
When the University opened in 1955, there were 43 students enrolled. Student enrollment reached 650 before the start of the civil disturbances in Lebanon in 1975. The present enrollment is approximately 750 with a faculty and staff of 150. So far, the university has granted the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Business Administration, Bachelor of Science and Master of Arts, Master of Business Administration degrees in various fields to more than 2,700 students.

Empowered by its newly acquired authorization from the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education to offer graduate programs, since 1995, the institution has started four Masters programs: Educational Administration and Supervision, General Psychology, Clinical Psychology, and Masters in Business Administration. As clearly highlighted during the 50th Anniversary celebratory activities throughout the year 2005, Haigazian University has served Lebanon and the region by empowering valuable human resources for a better life and service.

==Buildings==
The university was first located in the Webb Building the residence of American Missionary Elizabeth Webb, a ten-room house converted for college use. Later, a seven-story building was added. This building was called the Mehagian Academic Center in honor of Mr. and Mrs. A. S. Mehagian, whose financial support made its construction possible. A grant from Mr. Stephen P. Mugar of Boston, MA enabled the university to acquire a beautiful historic structure, a sample of the Lebanese architectural heritage, subsequently named the Mugar Building, to honor the donor's parents.

In 1987, due to the Lebanese war, the University moved to the Christian Medical Center in the Ashrafieh district, and classes continued as usual. On March 27, 1996, the Board of Managers decided that the University should return to its original campus on Rue Mexique, Kantari. On February 16, 1997, the renovation of the former campus began. On October 6, 1997, classes resumed in the renovated and revitalized Kantari campus to the delight of students and the community at large.

Early in July 2001, began the construction of a fourth building on the Mugar property which has a media center, a board room, and faculty offices. This new facility became operational in October 2001. Another addition, a new heritage building on May Ziadeh street will be ready for use early 2010.

== Background ==
Haigazian University is named in honor of Dr. [[Armenag Haigazian]],&lt;ref&gt;Haigazian University, [http://www.haigazian.edu.lb/TheUniversity.jsp The University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607044002/http://www.haigazian.edu.lb/TheUniversity.jsp |date=2007-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; former headmaster of the Jenanian Apostolic Institute of Konya, Turkey. Dr. Haigazian was an educator who received his Ph.D. from Yale University and returned to Turkey to serve his Armenian compatriots. After the law for forced exile of the Armenians passed in the Ottoman Parliament, Dr. Haigazian had the opportunity to escape to the United States, but he chose to stay and continue his ministry.

Later, he, along with the Armenian intellectuals, was rounded up to be driven to the Syrian desert. Dr. Haigazian died on the way in the prison of Kharpert in 1921. Concurrently, eight Armenian colleges were destroyed in Turkey. Although these realities of education and service were brought to an end, the dream continued in the minds of Dr. Haigazian’s descendants and others. The Mehagian family (Mary Mehagian and Florence Mehagian-Guertmenian) of Phoenix, Arizona, relatives of Dr. Haigazian, donated capital through the [[Armenian Missionary Association of America]] (AMAA)&lt;ref&gt;Projects, [http://www.amaa.org/projects.htm#LEB Armenian Missionary Association of America]&lt;/ref&gt; and worked hand in hand with Stephen Philibosian to get Haigazian College started.

Dr. [[John Markarian]], the first president of the University, served until June 1966. From 1966 to 1968, Dr. Joseph Spradley, chair of the division of sciences, served as acting president while on a 3-year leave of absence from Wheaton College in Illinois. During the years 1968 to 1971, Dr. Gilbert Bilezikian, also from Wheaton College, held the presidency; then Dr. Markarian returned to the post until his retirement in June 1982. Subsequently, the presidency was held by Dr. Verne H. Fletcher until February 1985. Miss Wilma Cholakian, the administrative dean, was then responsible for the operation of the University until August 30, 1995. Dr. John Khanjian served as president from September 1, 1995, until August 1, 2002. On September 1, 2002, Rev. Dr. Paul Haidostian became president.

In 1987, due to the war, the university moved to the Christian Medical Center in the [[Achrafieh]] district of Beirut, and classes continued as usual. On March 27, 1996, the Board of Managers decided that the university should return to its original campus on Rue Mexique, Kantari. On February 16, 1997, the renovation of the former campus began.

In July 2001, construction began on a fourth building on the Mugar property which has a media center, a board room, and faculty offices. This new facility became operational in October 2001. In 2003, Haigazian University started to use the whole seven floors of the south wing of the adjacent [[Armenian Evangelical College]] (AEC), according to a non-rent agreement between the administration and the AEC trustees.

Empowered by its newly acquired authorization from the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education to offer graduate programs, since 1995, the institution has started four M.A. programs: Educational Administration and Supervision, General Psychology, Clinical Psychology, and Masters in Business Administration.

== Rocketry ==
{{Main|Lebanese Rocket Society}}
The [[Lebanese Rocket Society]] which was led by [[Manoug Manougian]] and consisted a small group of students from the Haigazian University. The society developed into the wider [[Lebanese space program]] and it produced the first rockets of the Arab World, which were capable of suborbital flight.

In November 1960, a group of Haigazian College students got together under the guidance of [[Manoug Manougian]] (a Math and Physics instructor) to form the Haigazian College Rocket Society (HCRS).

Aspects of the first single-stage rocket were assigned to each student. As a result of the lack of required equipment, the group was obliged to resort to flight testing without any fuel tests in the laboratories. After a number of failures, the project was crowned with success.

In April 1961, a single-stage solid propellant rocket was Launched and reached an altitude of about one kilometer. With further improvements of the solid fuel system, a similar rocket called HCRS-3 was Launched all the way up to 2 000 m.

The Lebanese President, Fouad Chehab, as a result of these experiments, met with the members of HCRS and granted financial assistance for the project (10 thousand LL for 1961 and 15 thousand LL for 1962).

During the academic year 1961-1962, the society worked on two-stage rockets with further improvements of the separation system, solid fuel system, and vehicle design. On May 25, 1962, HCRS-7 Cedar was Launched up to 11,500 m, and the Lebanese Army was responsible for the security of the launch. In the summer of 1962, two more rockets, Cedar ll B and Cedar ll c, Were Launched to a distance of 20&amp;nbsp;km.

Due to the successes of the HCRS new members joined and a new group was formed in 1962, it was called the Lebanese Rocket Society (LRS).

The LRS was directed by a main committee of six members: Mr. M. Manougian of Haigazian College (Director), Dr. P. Mourad of AUB (advisor), Mr. Karamanougian of Haigazian college, Mr.J. Sfeir (Electronic engineer), Mr, E. Kai (Engineer geodesist), and an officer expert in ballistics (granted by the Army). Further tests were planned on design and construction of multistage rockets. Mr. Hart supervised the works of the HCRS while Mr. Manougian was in the U.S.A. Members of the HCRS at the College were: Hampartzum Karaguezian, Hrair Aintablian, Hrair Sahagian, Jirair Zenian, and Jean Jack Guvlekjian.

On November 21, 1962 Cedar-3, a three-stage solid propellant rocket prepared by the Haigazian group was launched. It had a length of 6.80 m and weight of 1250&amp;nbsp;kg.

After several other launchings, an accident occurred during the summer of 1964, which hospitalized 2 students, who later recovered. However, the launchings were ended then, and no "big bang" has taken place since. The outcome of these experiments was not a Haigazian student walking on the moon, but more students walking into Haigazian’s admissions office. One has to realize that nowadays, after the Lebanese civil wars, the idea of a rocket is not very pleasing, but back in the 1960s when both the U.S.and the U.S.S.R. were trying to reach the moon, Haigazian College was also on track.

'''John William Cheever''' (May 27, 1912 – June 18, 1982) was an American novelist and short story writer. He is sometimes called "the [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] of the suburbs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/22/nyregion/home-of-cheever-chekhov-of-the-suburbs-is-for-sale.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title= Home of Cheever, Chekhov of the Suburbs, Is for Sale| first= Lisa W. |last=Foderaro | date= July 21, 2014 |accessdate= November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/john-cheever-master-of-the-short-story/ | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | location= UK| title=John Cheever: 'the Chekhov of the suburbs' | first= Martin |last=Chilton|date= October 15, 2015|accessdate= November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His fiction is mostly set in the [[Upper East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], the [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] suburbs, old [[New England]] villages based on various [[South Shore (Massachusetts)|South Shore]] towns around [[Quincy, Massachusetts]], where he was born, and Italy, especially [[Rome]]. He is "now recognized as one of the most important short fiction writers of the 20th century."&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Literary Criticism'', [http://www.enotes.com/short-story-criticism/cheever-john "John Cheever Criticism"]. Enotes.com. Accessed 20 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; While Cheever is perhaps best remembered for his short stories (including "[[The Enormous Radio]]", "Goodbye, My Brother", "[[The Five-Forty-Eight]]", "The Country Husband", and "[[The Swimmer (short story)|The Swimmer]]"), he also wrote four novels, comprising ''[[The Wapshot Chronicle]]'' ([[National Book Award]], 1958),&lt;ref name=nba1958&gt;

''[[The Wapshot Scandal]]'' ([[William Dean Howells Medal]], 1965), ''[[Bullet Park]]'' (1969), ''[[Falconer (novel)|Falconer]]'' (1977) and a novella ''[[Oh What a Paradise It Seems]]'' (1982).

His main themes include the duality of human nature: sometimes dramatized as the disparity between a character's decorous social persona and inner corruption, and sometimes as a conflict between two characters (often brothers) who embody the salient aspects of both – light and dark, flesh and spirit. Many of his works also express a nostalgia for a vanishing way of life (as evoked by the mythical St. Botolphs in the ''Wapshot'' novels), characterized by abiding cultural traditions and a profound sense of community, as opposed to the alienating nomadism of modern [[suburbia]].

A compilation of his short stories, ''[[The Stories of John Cheever]]'', won the 1979 [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] and a [[National Book Critics Circle Award]], and its first paperback edition won a 1981 National Book Award.&lt;ref name=nba1981&gt;

Cheever's ''Stories'' won the 1981 [[National Book Award for Fiction#1980 to 1989|award for paperback Fiction]]. &lt;br&gt;From 1980 to 1983 in [[National Book Awards#History|National Book Awards history]] there were dual hardcover and paperback awards in most categories. Most of the paperback award-winners were reprints, including this one.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27, 1982, six weeks before his death, Cheever was awarded the National Medal for Literature by the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]]. His work has been included in the [[Library of America]].

==Early life and education==

John William Cheever was born in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]], the second child of Frederick Lincoln Cheever and Mary Liley Cheever. His father was a prosperous shoe salesman, and Cheever spent much of his childhood in a large [[Victorian house]], at 123 Winthrop Avenue,&lt;ref&gt;Susan Cheever, ''Home Before Dark: A Personal Memoir of John Cheever by His Daughter'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1984), 84.&lt;/ref&gt; in the then-genteel suburb of [[Wollaston (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Wollaston, Massachusetts]]. In the mid-1920s, however, as the New England shoe and textile industries began their long decline, Frederick Cheever lost most of his money and began to drink heavily. To pay the bills, Mary Cheever opened a gift shop in downtown Quincy—an "abysmal humiliation" for the family, as John saw it.&lt;ref&gt;From Cheever's unpublished journal, on deposit at Houghton Library, Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, Cheever began attending [[Thayer Academy]], a private day school, but he found the atmosphere stifling and performed poorly, and finally transferred to [[Quincy High School (Massachusetts)|Quincy High]] in 1928. A year later he won a short story contest sponsored by the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' and was invited back to Thayer as a "special student" on academic probation. His grades continued to be poor, however, and, in March 1930, he was either expelled for smoking or (more likely) departed of his own accord when the headmaster delivered an ultimatum to the effect that he must either apply himself or leave. The 18-year-old Cheever wrote a sardonic account of this experience, titled "Expelled", which was subsequently published in ''[[The New Republic]]''. (1930).&lt;ref&gt;Jon [''sic''] Cheever, "Expelled", ''[[The New Republic]]'', October 1, 1930, 171–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time, Cheever's older brother Fred, forced to withdraw from [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] in 1926 because of the family's financial crisis, re-entered Cheever's life "when the situation was most painful and critical," as Cheever later wrote. After the 1932 [[Kreuger crash|crash]] of [[Kreuger &amp; Toll]], in which Frederick Cheever had invested what was left of his money, the Cheever house on Winthrop Avenue was lost to foreclosure.  The parents separated, while John and Fred took an apartment together on [[Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts|Beacon Hill]], in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. In 1933, John wrote to Elizabeth Ames, the director of the [[Yaddo| Yaddo artist's colony]] in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]]: "The idea of leaving the city," he said, "has never been so distant or desirable."&lt;ref&gt;''The Letters of John Cheever'', ed. Benjamin Cheever (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1988), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Ames denied his first application but offered him a place the following year, whereupon Cheever decided to sever his "ungainly attachment" to his brother. Cheever spent the summer of 1934 at Yaddo, which would serve as a second home for much of his life.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Career==

===Early writings===

For the next few years, Cheever divided his time between Manhattan, Saratoga, [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]] (where he was caretaker of the Yaddo-owned Triuna Island), and Quincy, where he continued to visit his parents, who had reconciled and moved to an apartment at 60 Spear Street.  Cheever drove from one place to another in a dilapidated [[Ford Model A (1927)|Model A]] roadster, but had no permanent address. In 1935, [[Katharine Sergeant Angell White|Katharine White]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' bought Cheever's story "Buffalo", for $45—the first of many that Cheever would publish in the magazine.  [[Maxim Lieber]] became his literary agent, 1935–1941.  In 1938, he began work for the [[Federal Writers' Project]] in [[Washington, D. C.]], which he considered an embarrassing boondoggle.  As an editor for the ''WPA Guide to New York City'', Cheever was charged with (as he put it) "twisting into order the sentences written by some incredibly lazy bastards."&lt;ref&gt;''The Letters of John Cheever'', ed. Benjamin Cheever (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1988), 47.&lt;/ref&gt; He quit after less than a year and a few months later he met his future wife, Mary Winternitz, seven years his junior.&lt;ref name="NYT52" /&gt; She was a daughter of Milton Winternitz, dean of [[Yale Medical School]], and granddaughter of [[Thomas A. Watson]], an assistant to Alexander Graham Bell during the invention of the telephone. They married in 1941.

Cheever enlisted in the Army on May 7, 1942. His first collection of short stories, ''The Way Some People Live'', was published in 1943 to mixed reviews. Cheever himself came to despise the book as "embarrassingly immature", and for the rest of his life to destroyed every copy he could lay his hands on. However, the book may have saved his life after falling into the hands of Major [[Leonard Spigelgass]], an [[MGM]] executive and officer in the [[United States Army Signal Corps|Army Signal Corps]], who was struck by Cheever's "childlike sense of wonder".&lt;ref&gt;''Glad Tidings: A Friendship in Letters'', ed. John D. Weaver (New York: Harper Collins, 1993), 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Early that summer, Cheever was transferred to the former [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] studio in [[Astoria, Queens]], New York City, where he commuted via subway from his apartment in [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]], Manhattan, New York City. Meanwhile, most of his old infantry company was killed on a Normandy beach during the [[D-Day|D-Day invasion]]. Cheever's daughter Susan was born on July 31, 1943.

After the war, Cheever moved his family to an apartment building at 400 East 59th Street, near [[York Avenue / Sutton Place|Sutton Place]], Manhattan; almost every morning for the next five years, he would dress in his only suit and take the elevator to a maid's room in the basement, where he stripped to his boxer shorts and wrote until lunchtime.  In 1946, he accepted a $4,800 advance from [[Random House]] to resume work on his novel, ''The Holly Tree'', which he had discontinued during the war. "The Enormous Radio" appeared in the May 17, 1947, issue of ''The New Yorker'' — a Kafkaesque tale about a sinister radio that broadcasts the private conversations of tenants in a New York apartment building.  A startling advance on Cheever's early, more naturalistic work, the story elicited a fan letter from the magazine's irascible editor, [[Harold Ross]]: "It will turn out to be a memorable one, or I am a fish."&lt;ref&gt;''Letters from the Editor: The New Yorker's Harold Ross'', ed. Thomas Kunkel (New York: Modern Library, 2000), 308.&lt;/ref&gt; Cheever's son Benjamin was born on May 4, 1948.

===Mid-career===

Cheever's work became longer and more complex, apparently a protest against the "[[slice of life]]" fiction typical of ''The New Yorker'' in those years.  An early draft of "The Day the Pig Fell into the Well"—a long story with elaborate Chekhovian nuances, meant to "operate something like a [[rondo]]", as Cheever wrote to his friend and ''New Yorker'' editor [[William Keepers Maxwell, Jr.|William Maxwell]]—was completed in 1949, though the magazine did not make space for it until five years later. In 1951, Cheever wrote "Goodbye, My Brother", after a gloomy summer in [[Martha's Vineyard]]. Largely on the strength of these two stories (still in manuscript at the time), Cheever was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]. On May 28, 1951, Cheever moved to [[Beechwood (Vanderlip mansion)|Beechwood]], the suburban estate of Frank A. Vanderlip, a banker,&lt;ref name="NYT52"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/03/nyregion/connecticut/03cheeverCT.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 "How Cheever Really Felt About Living in Suburbia"] by [[Joseph Berger (author)|Joseph Berger]], ''The New York Times'', April 30, 2009 (p. CT1, 5/3/09, CT ed.). Retrieved 5/2/09.&lt;/ref&gt; in the Westchester hamlet of [[Scarborough-on-Hudson]], where he rented a small cottage on the edge of the estate. The house, coincidentally, had been occupied before the Cheevers by another suburban chronicler, [[Richard Yates (novelist)|Richard Yates]]. In Scarborough, he was a casual volunteer for the [[Briarcliff Manor Fire Department]].&lt;ref name="NYT52" /&gt;

Cheever's second collection, ''The Enormous Radio'', was published in 1953. Reviews were mostly positive, though Cheever's reputation continued to suffer because of his close association with ''The New Yorker'' (considered middlebrow by such influential critics as [[Dwight Macdonald]]), and he was particularly pained by the general preference for [[J. D. Salinger]]'s ''[[Nine Stories (Salinger)|Nine Stories]]'', published around the same time. Meanwhile, Random House demanded that Cheever either produce a publishable novel or pay back his advance, whereupon Cheever wrote Mike Bessie at [[Harper &amp; Brothers]] ("These old bones are up for sale"), who bought him out of his Random House contract. In the summer of 1956, Cheever finished ''The Wapshot Chronicle'' while vacationing in Friendship, [[Maine]], and received a congratulatory telegram from William Maxwell: "WELL ROARED LION."&lt;ref&gt;''The Letters of John Cheever'', 179.&lt;/ref&gt; With the proceeds from the sale of film rights to "The Housebreaker of Shady Hill", Cheever and his family spent the following year in Italy, where his son Federico was born on March 9, 1957 ("We wanted to call him Frederick", Cheever wrote, "but there is of course no K in the alphabet here and I gave up after an hour or two").&lt;ref&gt;''The Letters of John Cheever'', 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Wapshot Scandal'' was published in 1964, and received perhaps the best reviews of Cheever's career up to that point (amid quibbles about the novel's episodic structure). Cheever appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's March 27 issue, this for an appreciative profile, "Ovid in Ossining". (In 1961 Cheever had moved to a stately, stone-ended [[Dutch Colonial]] farmhouse in Ossining, on the east bank of the [[Hudson River|Hudson]].) "The Swimmer" appeared in the July 18, 1964 issue of ''The New Yorker''. Cheever noted with chagrin that the story (one of his best) appeared toward the back of the issue—behind a [[John Updike]] story—since, as it happened, Maxwell and other editors at the magazine were a little bewildered by its non-''New Yorker''ish surrealism. In the summer of 1966, a screen adaptation of "The Swimmer", starring [[Burt Lancaster]], was filmed in Westport, Connecticut.  Cheever was a frequent visitor on the set, and made a cameo appearance in the movie.

By then Cheever's alcoholism had become severe, exacerbated by torment concerning his bisexuality. Still, he blamed most of his marital woes on his wife, and in 1966 he consulted a psychiatrist, David C. Hays, about her hostility and "needless darkness". After a session with Mary Cheever, the psychiatrist asked to see the couple jointly; Cheever, heartened, believed his wife's difficult behavior would finally be addressed. At the joint session, however, Hays said
(as Cheever noted in his journal) that Cheever himself was the problem: "a neurotic man, narcissistic, egocentric, friendless, and so deeply involved in [his] own defensive illusions that [he has] invented a manic-depressive wife."&lt;ref&gt;''The Journals of John Cheever'', ed. Robert Gottlieb (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1991), 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Cheever soon terminated therapy.

===Later life and career===

''Bullet Park'' was published in 1969, and received a devastating review from [[Benjamin DeMott]] on the front page of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'': "John Cheever's short stories are and will remain lovely birds...  But in the gluey atmosphere of ''Bullet Park'' no birds sing."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin DeMott, ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'', April 27, 1969, 1, 40–1.&lt;/ref&gt; Cheever's alcoholic depression deepened, and in May he resumed psychiatric treatment (which again proved fruitless). He began an affair with actress [[Hope Lange]] in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="cheever"&gt;{{cite book

On May 12, 1973, Cheever awoke coughing uncontrollably, and learned at the hospital that he had almost died from [[pulmonary edema]] caused by alcoholism. After a month in the hospital, he returned home vowing never to drink again; however, he resumed drinking in August. Despite his precarious health, he spent the fall semester teaching (and drinking, both with fellow writer-teacher, [[Raymond Carver#Writing career|Raymond Carver]]&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{cite news | last = Ebert | first = Roger | coauthors = | title = ''Short Cuts'' | work = | pages = | publisher = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date =   October 22, 1993  | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/classifieds?category=REVIEWS01&amp;TITLESearch=Short%20Cuts&amp;ToDate=20101231 | accessdate = 2010-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) at the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]], where his students included [[T. Coraghessan Boyle|T. C. Boyle]], [[Allan Gurganus]], and [[Ron Hansen (novelist)|Ron Hansen]]. As his marriage continued to deteriorate, Cheever accepted a professorship at [[Boston University]] the following year and moved into a fourth-floor walkup apartment at 71 Bay State Road. Cheever's drinking soon became suicidal and, in March 1975, his brother Fred, now virtually indigent, but sober after his own lifelong bout with alcoholism, drove John back to Ossining. On April 9, Cheever was admitted to the Smithers Alcoholic Rehabilitation Unit in New York, where he shared a bedroom and bath with four other men. Driven home by his wife on May 7, Cheever never drank alcohol again.

In March 1977, Cheever appeared on the cover of ''[[Newsweek]]'' with the caption, "A Great American Novel: John Cheever's ''[[Falconer (novel)|Falconer]].''" The novel was No. 1 on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for three weeks. ''The Stories of John Cheever'' appeared in October 1978, and became one of the most successful collections ever, selling 125,000 copies in hardback and winning universal acclaim.

Cheever was awarded the [[Edward MacDowell Medal]] for outstanding contribution to the arts by the [[MacDowell Colony]] in 1979.

==Illness and death==

In the summer of 1981, a tumor was discovered in Cheever's right lung, and, in late November, he returned to the hospital and learned that the cancer had spread to his femur, pelvis, and bladder. Cheever's last novel, ''[[Oh What a Paradise It Seems]],'' was published in March 1982; only 100 pages long and relatively inferior (as Cheever himself suspected), the book received respectful reviews in part because it was widely known the author was dying of cancer. On April 27, he received the National Medal for Literature at [[Carnegie Hall]], where colleagues were shocked by Cheever's ravaged appearance after months of cancer therapy. "A page of good prose", he declared in his remarks, "remains invincible." As [[John Updike]] remembered, "All the literary acolytes assembled there fell quite silent, astonished by such faith."

Cheever died on June 18, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Michiko|last= Kakutani|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=John Cheever Is Dead At 70.

===Posthumous===

In 1987, Cheever's widow, Mary, signed a contract with a small publisher, Academy Chicago, for the right to publish Cheever's uncollected short stories. The contract led to a long legal battle and a book of 13 stories by the author entitled ''Fall River and Other Uncollected Stories'', published in 1994 by [[Academy Chicago Publishers]].

Two of Cheever's children, [[Susan Cheever|Susan]] and [[Benjamin Cheever|Benjamin]], became writers. Susan's memoir, ''Home Before Dark'' (1984), revealed Cheever's bisexuality, which was confirmed by his posthumously published letters and journals.  This was parodied to comedic effect in [[The Cheever Letters|a 1992 episode of]] the TV sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'', when the character Susan discovers explicit love letters from Cheever to her father.

After [[Blake Bailey]] published his biography of [[Richard Yates (novelist)|Richard Yates]], ''A Tragic Honesty'' (2003), Cheever's son Ben suggested Bailey write an authoritative biography of Cheever. The book was published by [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]] on March 10, 2009 and won that year's [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] in Biography and the [[Francis Parkman Prize]], and was a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]] and [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, Geoffrey.

Also in 2009, Cheever was featured in ''Soul of a People: Writing America's Story'', a 90-minute documentary about the WPA Writers' Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/site/smithsonian/show_soul_people_writers.do |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120912055114/http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/site/smithsonian/show_soul_people_writers.do |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-12 |title='&amp;#39;Soul of a People: Writing America's Story'&amp;#39; |publisher=Smithsonianchannel.com |date=2013-02-06 |accessdate=2013-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His life during the 1930s is also highlighted in the companion book, ''Soul of a People: The WPA Writers' Project Uncovers Depression America''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470403802.html ''Soul of a People: The WPA Writers' Project Uncovers Depression America''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007072915/http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470403802.html |date=2012-10-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheever's name is mentioned in the lyrics of 2017 song  "Carin at the Liquor Store"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The National|title=The National – 'Carin at the Liquor Store'|date=2017-08-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEe_yCVLQSc|accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the American band [[The National (band)|The National]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2044">The '''k.u.k. War College''', also '''k.u.k. Staff College''' ([[German language|Ge:]] ''k.u.k. Kriegsschule'')&lt;ref&gt;Langenscheidt`s Encyclopaedic Dictionary of English and German Language “Der Große Muret-Sander“, Part II, German-English, First Volume A–K, 9th edition 2002, page 955&lt;/ref&gt; was the highest military facility to educate, instruct, train, and develop ''general staff officers'' of the [[Austrian Empire]] and later the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].

It was located in [[Vienna]], and active from 1852 to 1918.

Established in 1852, the ''k.u.k. War College'' was an outgrowth of the previous centers of Austrian military scholarship: the ''Kriegsarchiv'' and the ''Österreichische militärische Zeitschrift'' (Austrian Military Journal).&lt;ref&gt;Rothenburg, G. ''The Army of Francis Joseph.'' West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 1976. p 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Having been earlier suggested by the likes of officers including [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz]],{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=12}} it was organized early in the reign of [[Franz Joseph|Emperor Franz Josef]]. Among its students and faculty were such influential members of the Austro-Hungarian military as [[Count Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf]], who attended the school and later taught tactics there from 1888 to 1892. {{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=143}}&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, L. ''Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf: Architect of the Apocalypse''. (Studies in Central European Histories.) Boston: Humanities Press, 2000. p 37. (Retrieved via Google Books 2/23/11.)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marion Walter''' (born July 30, 1928 in Berlin, [[Weimar Republic|Germany]]) is a mathematician who retired as Professor of Mathematics at [[University of Oregon]] in 1994. There is a theorem named after her, called Marion Walter's theorem.

==Education and early life==
Born in Germany in 1928, she left on a ''[[Kindertransport]]'' to England where she attended a boarding school.&lt;ref name="mwcoll"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mead|first1=Carol|title=Introducing the Marion Walter Collection|url=https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/maa-focus/introducing-the-marion-walter-collection|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After she left school in December 1944 the school's only mathematics teacher resigned and since it was difficult to find a replacement during the war period, she was asked to teach maths, in part because she had earned a mark of distinction on her Cambridge University School Certificate exam. She taught for two terms and found she enjoyed teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruef|first1=Jennifer|title=Celebrating Marion Walter – and other unsung female mathematicians|url=https://theconversation.com/celebrating-marion-walter-and-other-unsung-female-mathematicians-92249|website=The Conversation|publisher=The Conversation Media Group|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She attended college in England for two years before leaving for the United States in 1948. She then attended [[Hunter College]], majoring in mathematics and minoring in education, graduating in 1950.

After graduating, she taught at [[Hunter College High School]] and [[George Washington Educational Campus|George Washington High School]]. She began taking evening classes for a master's degree in mathematics at [[New York University]]. She worked as a research assistant, mainly doing computing work at what became the [[Courant Institute]].

In the summers of 1952 and 1953 she was awarded a [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Bureau of Standards]] summer scholarship to study at the Institute of Numerical Analysis at [[UCLA]].

She earned her master's degree in mathematics from [[New York University]] in 1954.

==Career==
She accepted a teaching assistantship at [[Cornell University]]. In 1956, she took a one-year appointment at [[Simmons College]] in Boston. At the time, the college did not offer a major in mathematics but at the end of the year she was asked to create this major. Disliking the administrative aspects, she stepped down as department chair after four years, remaining there teaching until 1965 when she left to concentrate on her doctorate at [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]], earning an Ed.D. in 1967.

In 1960, she earned a fellowship to attend the National Science Foundation Summer Program at Stanford.

At Harvard, she formed a group called the Boston Area Math Specialists which gives monthly workshops for practicing teachers.&lt;ref name="ams"&gt;{{cite web|title=About BAMS|url=https://www.bostonareamathspecialists.org/about-bams|website=Boston Area Math Specialists|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was a mathematics consultant to the project that became ''[[Sesame Street]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Charlene Morrow and Teri Peri (eds), ''Notable Women in Mathematics'', Greenwood Press, 1998, p 270&lt;/ref&gt;

She worked briefly in Israel as a [[UNESCO]] consultant for mathematics teaching.

In 1977, she accepted a teaching position at [[University of Oregon]] where she remained until her retirement in 1994.&lt;ref name="uocat"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mathematics Faculty|url=http://uocatalog.uoregon.edu/arts_sciences/mathematics/#facultytext|website=University of Oregon Catalog|publisher=University of Oregon|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Marion Walter's Theorem, which deals with the area of the hexagon formed by trisecting the sides of triangles, was named for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cuoco|first=Al|last2=Goldenberg|first2=Paul|last3=Mark|first3=June|date=1993|title=Marion's theorem|jstor=27968561|journal=The Mathematics Teacher|volume=86|issue=8|pages=619–619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She wrote a book on using mirrors to explore symmetry - Make a Bigger Puddle, Make a Smaller Worm (1971), which won an honourable mention from the New York Academy of Science Children's Book Award Program, as did her 1985 book ''The Mirror Puzzle Book''.&lt;ref name="mwcoll"/&gt;

The '''matching person and technology model''' is an organizational framework to assess and recommend successful use of a variety of [[assistive technology|assistive technologies]] for people with [[disability|disabilities]]: [[educational technology]], and those used in the workplace, school, home; for healthcare, for mobility and performing daily activities. Specialized devices for [[hearing loss]], [[speech]], [[eyesight]] and [[cognition]] as well as general or everyday technologies are also included. Research shows that although a technology may appear perfect for a given need, it may be used inappropriately or even go unused when critical [[Personality psychology|personality]] preferences, [[psychosocial]] characteristics or needed environmental support are not considered. The use and non-use of technology as conceptualized in the Matching person and technology model has been validated by many researchers and authors representing the fields of [[occupational therapy]], [[physical therapy]], [[speech language pathology]], [[psychology]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Kormann &amp; Petronko: (2003) Crisis and Revolution in Developmental Disabilities: The Dilemma of Community Based Services. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 3 (4),'' 434–43 [http://www.baojournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The matching person and technology model is [[operationalize]]d by a series of reliable and valid measures that provide a person-centered and individualized approach to matching individuals with the most appropriate technologies for their use.  The matching person &amp; technology model and measures were developed by Marcia J. Scherer beginning in 1986.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Assessment measures==
* Initial worksheet for the matching person and technology (MPT) model—to determine initial goals, potential interventions, and technologies needed to support attainment of the goals. 
* History of support use—identifies supports used in the past and satisfaction with those supports.  
* Specific technology matching:
** General—survey of technology use
** Assistive—assistive technology device predisposition assessment, cognitive support technology predisposition assessment and hearing technology predisposition assessment
** Educational—educational technology device predisposition assessment
** Workplace—workplace technology device predisposition assessment
** Healthcare—healthcare technology device predisposition assessment
* Follow-up versions of the measures to determine degree of use, comparison of expected benefit and realization of benefit and change in functioning and subjective well-being.

'''Murray Seymour Klamkin''' (March 5, 1921 – August 6, 2004) was an American [[mathematician]], known as prolific proposer and editor of professionally challenging mathematical problems.

==Life==
Klamkin was born on March 5, 1921 in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City|New York]]. He received a bachelor's degree from the [[Cooper Union]] in 1942 and, after four years of service in the United States Army, earned a master's degree from the [[Polytechnic University of New York|Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn]] in 1947, where he taught from 1948 until 1957.

After this, Klamkin worked at [[AVCO]], taught at [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|SUNY Buffalo]] (1962&amp;ndash;1964), and served as the principal research scientist at [[Ford Motor Company]] (1965&amp;ndash;1976).  During this period, he was also a visiting professor at the [[University of Minnesota]].  After leaving Ford, he became a professor at the [[University of Waterloo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/mathhorizons/volume/klamkin.htm ''Memorial Celebration of the Life of Murray Seymour Klamkin''], web page at the MAA, accessed 2007-01-11.&lt;/ref&gt; 
From 1976 to 1981 Klamkin was the chairman of the Department of Mathematics at the [[University of Alberta]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ualberta.ca/ARCHIVES/guide/3FACULTY/92.htm ''University of Alberta Archives: Faculty of Science''], web page at the University of Alberta, accessed 2007-01-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1981 he became an [[emeritus]] professor at Alberta.  Klamkin died August 6, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/pubs/nov04.pdf ''Murray Klamkin, 1921-2004''], ''MAA FOCUS''  '''24''' (#8), November 2004, p. 32, accessed 2014-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical problems==
Klamkin was known worldwide as a prolific proposer and editor of professionally challenging mathematical problems.  He served as problem editor for ''[[SIAM Review]]'', the ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'', and many other journals.  He was also known for his work in high-level [[mathematics competitions]], such as the [[United States of America Mathematical Olympiad|USA Mathematical Olympiad]], the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]], and the [[William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition|Putnam Competition]].  
In 1988 the [[Mathematical Association of America]] gave him its Award for Distinguished Service to Mathematics, its highest service award.&lt;ref&gt;"Award for Distinguished Service to Prof. Murray Klamkin", [[Gerald L. Alexanderson]], ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'' '''95''' (#1), January 1988, pp. 1&amp;ndash;4.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1992, the [[World Federation of National Mathematics Competitions]] awarded Klamkin  the [[David Hilbert Award]] for his contributions to mathematics competitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amt.edu.au/wfnmcaw.html ''David Hilbert and Paul Erdös Awards''], web page at the WFNMC, accessed 2014-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2305">A '''Neighbourhood Action Group''', or NAG, is a [[UK]] initiative, set up to deal with key issues identified by a community's first public consultation. The group is coordinated by the [[police]].This may happen in the form of a public meeting, through surveys done face-to-face or by mail, or a combination of methods. 

NAGs are volunteer working groups made up of representatives from the community.They will include residents, the police, local authority and other organisations, such as local businesses and schools. Ideally NAGs represent a cross section of the society they represent, including representatives from groups such as [[neighbourhood watch]] schemes and local councils.

They are key to the success of neighbourhood policing as it is this group which will plan on behalf of the community and organise for tasks to be completed. In effect, they are the 'doers', accountable locally for responding to problems a community wants to tackle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thamesvalley.police.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

== NAG Members ==
The NAG constitution &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/nagterms.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; suggests the following should be invited to join the NAG:
* Residents including young people
* [[Civil parishes in England|Parish]] and [[Wards of the United Kingdom|Ward]] [[Councillor]]s
* Representatives from the business community
* Neighbourhood Watch co-ordinators
* Local policing team including [[Police community support officer]]s (PCSO)

== Priority Profiles ==

Every NAG has three priority profiles - priorities for the neighbourhood policing team to address, with the assistance of NAG members. These are reviewed annually and those outside of the NAG are invited to contribute.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/nagterms.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''objective structured clinical examination''' ('''OSCE''') is a modern&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.5955.447 |title=Assessment of clinical competence using objective structured examination |journal=BMJ |volume=1 |issue=5955 |pages=447–451 |year=1975 |last1=Harden |first1=R M |last2=Stevenson |first2=M |last3=Downie |first3=W W |last4=Wilson |first4=G M }}&lt;/ref&gt; type of examination often used in health sciences (e.g. audiology, midwifery, occupational therapy, optometry, orthoptics,  medicine, physician assistants/associates, physical therapy, radiography, athletic training, rehabilitation medicine, dietetics, nursing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2648.1988.tb01390.x |pmid=3372885 |title=Using the OSCE to measure clinical skills performance in nursing |journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=45–56 |year=1988 |last1=Ross |first1=Margaret |last2=Carroll |first2=Giséle |last3=Knight |first3=Janet |last4=Chamberlain |first4=Marie |last5=Fothergill-Bourbonnais |first5=Francis |last6=Linton |first6=Jeanette }}&lt;/ref&gt; pharmacy, dentistry, chiropractic, paramedicine, podiatry, veterinary medicine, athletic training). It is designed to test clinical skill performance and competence in skills such as [[communication]], [[clinical examination]], medical procedures / prescription, exercise prescription, joint mobilisation / manipulation techniques, radiographic positioning, radiographic image evaluation and interpretation of results. It is a hands-on, real-world approach to learning that keeps examinees engaged, allows them to understand the key factors that drive the medical decision-making process, and challenges the professional to be innovative and reveals their errors in case-handling and provides an open space for improved decision-making, based on evidence-based practice for real-world responsibilities.

==OSCE design==
An OSCE usually comprises a circuit of short (the usual is 5–10 minutes although some use up to 15 minute) stations, in which each candidate is examined on a one-to-one basis with one or two impartial examiner(s) and either real or simulated (actors or electronic patient simulators) [[patient]]s. Each station has a different examiner, as opposed to the traditional method of clinical examinations where a candidate would be assigned to an examiner for the entire examination. Candidates rotate through the stations, completing all the stations on their circuit. In this way, all candidates take the same stations. It is considered to be an improvement over traditional examination methods because the stations can be [[standardisation|standardised]] enabling fairer peer comparison and complex procedures can be assessed without endangering patients health.

As the name suggests, an OSCE is designed to be ''objective'' – all candidates are assessed using exactly the same stations (although if real patients are used, their signs may vary slightly) with the same marking scheme. In an OSCE, candidates get marks for each step on the mark scheme that they perform correctly, which therefore makes the assessment of clinical skills more objective, rather than subjective, ''structured'' – stations in OSCEs have a very specific task. Where simulated patients are used, detailed scripts are provided to ensure that the information that they give is the same to all candidates, including the emotions that the patient should use during the consultation. Instructions are carefully written to ensure that the candidate is given a very specific task to complete. The OSCE is carefully structured to include parts from all elements of the curriculum as well as a wide range of skills. ''A clinical examination'' - the OSCE is designed to apply clinical and theoretical knowledge. Where theoretical knowledge is required, for example, answering questions from the examiner at the end of the station, then the questions are standardized and the candidate is only asked questions that are on the mark sheet and if the candidate is asked any others then there will be no marks for them.

==OSCE marking==
Marking in OSCEs is done by the examiner. Occasionally written stations, for example, writing a prescription chart, are used and these are marked like written examinations, again usually using a standardized mark sheet. One of the ways an OSCE is made objective is by having a detailed mark scheme and standard set of questions. For example, a station concerning the demonstration to a simulated patient on how to use a [[metered dose inhaler]] [MDI] would award points for specific actions which are performed safely and accurately. The examiner can often vary the marks depending on how well the candidate performed the step. At the end of the mark sheet, the examiner often has a small number of marks that they can use to weight the station depending on performance and if a simulated patient is used, then they are often asked to add marks depending on the candidates approach. At the end, the examiner is often asked to give a "global score". This is usually used as a subjective score based on the candidates overall performance, not taking into account how many marks the candidate scored. The examiner is usually asked to rate the candidate as pass/borderline/fail or sometimes as excellent/good/pass/borderline/fail. This is then used to determine the individual pass mark for the station.

Many centres allocate each station an individual pass mark. The sum of the pass marks of all the stations determines the overall pass mark for the OSCE. Many centres also impose a minimum number of stations required to pass which ensures that a consistently poor performance is not compensated by a good performance on a small number of stations.

There are, however, criticisms that the OSCE stations can never be truly standardized and objective in the same way as a written exam. It has been known for different patients / actors to afford more assistance, and for different marking criteria to be applied. Finally, it is not uncommon at certain institutions for members of teaching staff be known to students (and vice versa) as the examiner. This familiarity does not necessarily affect the integrity of the examination process, although there is a deviation from [[anonymous marking]]. However, in OSCEs that use several circuits of the same stations the marking is repeatedly shown to be very consistent which supports the validity that the OSCE is a fair clinical examination. There are arguments for and against quarantining OSCE examinees to prevent sharing of exam information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bma.org.uk/connecting-doctors/community_focus/b/future_docs_news/posts/calls-to-ensure-end-of-year-exam-fairness|title=Calls to ensure end-of-year exam fairness|work=BMA - Connecting doctors|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the data tend to show no improvement in the overall scores in a later OSCE session, the research methodology is flawed and validity of the claim is questionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/10/e012541.responses#sharing-of-information-in-objective-structured-clinical-examinations----does-no-evidence-of-difference-mean-evidence-of-no-difference|title=Sharing of information in objective structured clinical examinations -- does no evidence of difference mean evidence of no difference?|last=Yeung|first=E|date=April 2, 2017|website=BMJ Open|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study suggested that marks do not give a sound inference of student collusion in an OSCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jme.2005.015446 |pmid=17145916 |pmc=2563344 |title=The Objective Structured Clinical Examination and student collusion: Marks do not tell the whole truth |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=32 |issue=12 |pages=734–738 |year=2006 |last1=Parks |first1=R |last2=Warren |first2=P M |last3=Boyd |first3=K M |last4=Cameron |first4=H |last5=Cumming |first5=A |last6=Lloyd-Jones |first6=G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
Preparing for OSCEs is very different from preparing for an examination on  theory. In an OSCE, clinical skills are tested rather than pure theoretical knowledge. It is essential to learn correct clinical methods, and then practice repeatedly until one perfects the methods whilst simultaneously developing an understanding of the underlying theory behind the methods used. Marks are awarded for each step in the method; hence, it is essential to dissect the method into its individual steps, learn the steps, and then learn to perform the steps in a sequence.

Most universities have clinical skills labs where students have the opportunity to practice clinical skills such as taking blood or mobilizing patients in a safe and controlled environment. It is often very helpful to practise in small groups with colleagues, setting a typical OSCE scenario and timing it with one person role playing a patient, one person doing the task and if possible, one person either observing and commenting on technique or even role playing the examiner using a sample mark sheet. Many OSCE textbooks have sample OSCE stations and mark sheets that can be helpful when studying in the manner. In doing this the candidate is able to get a feel of running to time and working under pressure.

In many OSCEs the stations are extended using data interpretation. For example, the candidate may have to take a brief history of chest pain and then interpret an [[electrocardiogram]]. It is also common to be asked for a [[differential diagnosis]], to suggest which medical investigations the candidate would like to do or to suggest a management plan for the patient.

==History==
The development of ''OpenTTD'' was driven by the desire to extend the abilities of ''Transport Tycoon Deluxe'' to support user-made additions to the graphics and gameplay. Also, users wanted to play the game on more modern [[operating system]]s and alternative computer architectures which ''Transport Tycoon Deluxe'' did not support, being released in 1994 for [[DOS]] and programmed in [[assembly language]].

===Prior modifications to ''Transport Tycoon Deluxe''===
There was a prior attempt to modify Transport Tycoon Deluxe to run on more modern operating systems. ''OpenTTD'' was preceded by a commercial conversion of ''Transport Tycoon Deluxe'' to run on [[Windows 95]]. It was created in 1996 by the FISH technology group, but Nola released in 1999 as part of a compilation of older ''Tycoon'' games. This release was still greatly restricted in operating systems and computer architectures it could run on. Similarly, there was an earlier success aiming to open ''Transport Tycoon Deluxe'' to modification by users. ''[[TTDPatch]]'', initially created by [[Josef Drexler]] in 1996–97 and still being developed in 2010, changes the behaviour of ''Transport Tycoon Deluxe'' as it is running, to introduce many new features to the game, such as new graphics, vehicles, industries, etc. ''TTDPatch'' is restricted by the same operating system and computer architecture limits as ''Transport Tycoon Deluxe'' and has limited control over what features of the game can be altered.

===Initial development of ''OpenTTD''===
In 2003, [[Ludvig Strigeus]] announced that he intended to [[reverse engineer]] ''Transport Tycoon Deluxe'' and convert the game to [[C (programming language)|C]]. In 2004, this re-engineered ''Transport Tycoon Deluxe'' was released and named ''OpenTTD''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This release was popular. {{As of|2018}}, ''OpenTTD'' is still under active development.

The early development of ''OpenTTD'' focused on restructuring the code to improve readability and extensibility. This allowed restoring features like sound and music, improving the user interface and introducing new languages for the GUI. Many new gameplay features and possibilities for user modification were also added around this time, aiming to replicate the abilities of TTDPatch. A major improvement was reprogramming multiplayer (network games) to use the [[internet protocol]], allowing multiplayer gaming online and over modern LANs.

By the late 2000s, ''OpenTTD'' was a stable and popular game and development moved toward more substantial changes. 2007 saw the development of support for custom, user-made AIs, which can provide players with more of a challenge than the original AI.&lt;ref&gt;

===Version 1.0.0===
Up until 2010, ''OpenTTD'' relied on the graphics, sound and music files from ''Transport Tycoon Deluxe''. While ''OpenTTD'' was [[free software]], it needed [[copyright]]ed components of a commercial game to work. Starting at the end of 2007, a large community effort worked to generate replacements for the 7000 [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] which make up the graphics of the game. Similar community efforts to create free sound effects and music soon followed. When the graphics and sound effect replacement projects (''OpenGFX'' and ''OpenSFX'', respectively) reached completion at the end of 2009, it was possible, for the first time, to play ''OpenTTD'' completely independently of ''Transport Tycoon Deluxe''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This was celebrated in early 2010 with the release of ''OpenTTD'' 1.0.0, named to reflect its new status as a fully stand-alone game.

===Version 1.1.0===
Released on April 1, 2011, OpenTTD 1.1.0 saw the re-introduction of Mac OS platform support. The 1.1.x series also saw extensions of the NewGRF and NewObject specifications, improvement of GUI loading times and pathfinding, and the introduction of a new command-line administrative interface that can be accessed over a network for remote servers.

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Version 1.2.0===
Released on April 15, 2012, OpenTTD 1.2.0 formally integrated graphics support for 32 bpp, and 2x and 4x zoom levels. These two features allow graphics developers to include graphics that feature higher resolutions and more details. For the first time the game can randomly create rivers automatically on map generation. The introduction of the Game Script feature allows developers to create scripted scenarios, new interactive goals, and achievements within games. Two new features alter the way the game can be played. Infrastructure Maintenance adds a new ongoing costs to owning infrastructure such as roads, rails, and signals. Airport Range implements a limit on how far aircraft can travel before needing to land at another airport facility. In-game documentation for NewGRFs was introduced, allowing developers to provide more information about NewGRF add-ons, including Internet links to external Web sites or other documentation.

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Version 1.3.0===
Released on April 1, 2013, OpenTTD 1.3.0 focused on improving the user interface, including GUI and textboxes. Formerly undocumented features which were unsupported were removed in later releases of the 1.3.x series, and support for new currencies and translations was introduced.

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Version 1.4.0===
Released on April 1, 2014, OpenTTD 1.4.0 saw a significant change in how the game can be played with the formal inclusion of the Cargo Distribution (CargoDist) patch. In the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe and prior versions of OpenTTD, passengers, mail and other cargo were not assigned a destination, and hence could be sent to any destination desired by players (effectively being unloaded at the next station accepting them). With the introduction of CargoDist, cargo are assigned a destination by the game when created, and will transfer as necessary to arrive at their destination. The game also regularly checks for new destinations that players have constructed, allowing cargo to be assigned to new destinations if available. Further improvements to the NoGo and NewObject specifications were included. Users can now create map sizes of up to 4096x4096. Players are now also able to load more NewGRF and NewObject sets, with an increase of up to 255 NewGRF or NewObject sets, and 64,000 different objects with nearly 16 million instances of objects. Later improvements of the 1.4.x series include optimization for building on more obscure operating systems.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Version 1.5.0===

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Version 1.6.0===

==Gameplay==
{{See also|Transport_Tycoon#Gameplay|l1=Transport Tycoon Gameplay}}
''OpenTTD'' gameplay is very similar to ''Transport Tycoon Deluxe'', on which it is based, although there are many improvements in both options within the game and ease of use.&lt;ref name="dpopov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dl.fullcirclemagazine.org/issue9_en.pdf |title=Install Open Transport Tycoon Deluxe (OpenTTD) |date=January 2008 |author=McCullagh, Jonny |journal=Ubuntu Full Circle Magazine |pages=20–21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708182442/http://dl.fullcirclemagazine.org/issue9_en.pdf |archivedate=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A player's aim is to build a transportation network using trucks, buses, trains, airplanes and boats to link together industries and towns on the map and transport the cargo they produce. Every time a vehicle makes a delivery of some cargo, players receive an income, allowing them to build more infrastructure (rails, stations, etc.), build more vehicles, modify the terrain, and interact with towns, via their local authorities. The default game runs from 1950 to 2050, during which a player aims to get as high a performance rating (based on number of vehicles, income, amount of cargo delivered, etc.) as possible.
[[File:OpenTTD industry-commodity flow chart - Temperate.svg|thumb|300px|Chart illustrating flow of commodities between industries and towns in Temperate scenarios in ''OpenTTD''.]]
The world map is dotted with both industries and towns. Cargo for transportation is supplied by both industries (e.g. the coal mine which produces coal) and towns (which produce passengers and mail) and accepted by other industries and/or towns according to their needs (e.g., the power station accepts coal). Placing a station near a source and a receiver of a certain cargo allows transportation between the two. The amount of cargo supplied by a town or industry depends on the quality of transport players provide to move its goods. Payment for delivering cargo depends on the quantity of cargo delivered, how fast it was delivered and how perishable it is. Some cargoes (e.g., passengers) must be delivered faster than others (e.g., coal) to earn a good income.

[[File:OpenTTD difference block path signals.svg|thumb|280px|The introduction of "Path Signal" to ''OpenTTD'', in addition to the traditional "[[Automatic block signaling|Block Signal]]" from the original ''Transport Tycoon'', increases throughput of railway junction-crossing.]]
During the course of the game, players must build and expand their transport infrastructure. The only infrastructure present on the map at the start of the game are roads within towns. All other infrastructure—ports, stations, airports, rail, and depots—must be built by players. The tools for building a rail network are particularly powerful, and players have access to many different signal types to build a complex and interconnected rail network.

During the course of the game, technology improvements give players access to newer, faster and more powerful vehicles. For rail transport, new track technology also becomes available over time, first [[Railway electrification system|electrified rail]], then [[monorail]] and [[maglev]] track. In general, newer vehicles cost more money to buy and run, and players must have earned enough money in earlier stages of the game to be able to afford to upgrade their vehicles. The full course of the default game, from 1950 to 2050, takes around 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;

Note: 2.22 seconds a game day -&gt; 2.22 * 365 (days in year) * 100 (years) / 3,600 (seconds in hour) results in about 22.5 hours
&lt;/ref&gt; Players can optionally start at earlier dates and play on past 2050, although no new technology becomes available.

''OpenTTD'' can be played by one player, against a computer controlled AI, or by many players against each other, over a LAN or the Internet.

===Multiplayer===
''OpenTTD'' supports multiplayer games for up to 255 players between 15 different transport companies, and can be played both over a LAN or over the Internet. Each transport company is in competition with each other transport company, and each transport company can be controlled by more than one player at any time. This allows both co-operative and competitive multiplayer games. Competitive team games (e.g. two transport companies, both controlled by three players) are also possible.

===Mods and online content===
''OpenTTD'' supports extensive [[mod (computer gaming)|modification]] for both single player and multiplayer games. Modifications come in the form of a "NewGRF" (New Graphics Resource File). NewGRFs package both new graphics (2D sprites) and the [[computer code]] which describes how the new graphics should be used. Many aspects of the game can be altered by NewGRFs; a NewGRF can introduce a complete new set of vehicles, new industries and the cargoes they produce, new town buildings, new rail graphics and behaviour, etc. NewGRFs, along with heightmaps, scenarios and custom AIs, can be downloaded and installed using the "BaNaNaS" in-game online content system.&lt;ref name="bananas"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bananas.openttd.org/en/ | title=OpenTTD – BaNaNaS | publisher=OpenTTD Team | year=2011 | accessdate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platforms==
Due to its use of [[Simple DirectMedia Layer]] [[cross-platform]] graphics and sound layers, ''OpenTTD'' can be compiled and run on many different [[operating system]]s. The officially supported operating systems are the 32/64-bit variants of:&lt;ref&gt;

All English-speaking and French-speaking sources call him Mal'''''e'''''vergne;&lt;ref name=tick&gt;[http://tickets.balletsj.org/single/eventDetail.aspx?p=244 Ballet // Paquita]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://classicalballetnews.com/paquita-with-the-paris-national-opera-full-length-ballet/ Paquita with the Paris National Opera]&lt;/ref&gt; all Russian-speaking sources call him Mal'''''a'''''vergne ({{lang-ru|link=no|Малавернь}}) or Mal'''''o'''''vergne ({{lang-ru|link=no|Маловернь}}), {{lang-ru|link=no|Пьер Фредерик Малавернь/Маловернь}}.&lt;ref name=ballet&gt;[http://www.ballet-enc.ru/html/f/frederik.html Фредерик с энциклопедии балета. Источник: Балет. Энциклопедия, СЭ, 1981]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biglib.com.ua/read.php?pg_which=150&amp;dir=0015&amp;f=15_21&amp;book_id=2655 Электронная народная библиотека]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=modernlib&gt;[http://modernlib.ru/books/neizvesten_avtor/russkiy_balet/read_64/ Encyclopedia of Russian ballet]&lt;/ref&gt;

The birth name of the dancer name is unknown, he himself preferred to be called by alias ''Monsieur Frédéric'' or ''Frédéric'' (ru: Фредерик).

Of his youth nothing is known.

Monsieur Frédéric received an invitation from the [[Saint Petersburg Imperial troupe|Russian Imperial troupe]] and arrived to [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1831.&lt;ref name=ballet/&gt;&lt;ref name=modernlib/&gt;

In these years, Russia has laid the base of culture and arts and invited European experts to aid in this, not skimping on the fees and salaries to Europeans. European specialists have not received compensation in Europe and gladfully visited Russia for big money. Russia's policy was justified, and in the middle of the 19th century  Russia already had its own Russian culture, a part of the pan-European culture{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}.

Since the tranvel, Monsieur Frédéric’s whole life was in Russia. He was working in Russia for 42 years.

Monsieur Frédéric became a solo performer of many parties in ballets of choreographers [[Charles Didelot]], [[Alexis-Scipion Blache]], [[Antoine Titus]], [[Marius Petipa]].

He also became a choreographer. His greatest work was ''[[Paquita]]''&lt;ref name=tick/&gt;&lt;ref name=modernlib/&gt;&lt;ref name=vslovar&gt;[http://vslovar.org.ru/cult/4115.html ru: ПАХИТА]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kultobozrevatel.ru/about%20www.balletmoskva.ru ru: Театр «Балет Москва»]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=torrentino&gt;[http://www.torrentino.com/torrents/376750 ru: Пахита (Балет Парижской оперы) / Deldevez and Minkus]&lt;/ref&gt; together with Marius Petipa in 1847, St. Petersburg ([[Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre]]) and 1848, Moscow ([[Bolshoi Theatre]]) with [[Yelena Andreyanova]] in the main party. Another his well-known work is ''[[Le Corsaire]]'' en 1858, after [[Jules Perrot]]'s chorégraphie, Moscow ([[Bolshoi Theatre]])&lt;ref name=modernlib/&gt; with [[Praskovya Lebedeva]] as Medora.

Monsieur Frédéric became the teacher of dance. He taught for many years. Among his students were: [[Lev Ivanov]], [[Timofei Stukolkin]], [[Marfa Muravyova]], [[Lubov Radina]], [[Alexandra Kammerer]] etc.

In Russia there were two Imperial troupes: in Saint Petersburg and in Moscow,  he worked in both, and eventually he was transferred to Moscow. He died in 1872. Some sources&lt;ref name=PleNotreB/&gt; attribute his death place to Moscow while other sources&lt;ref name=ballet/&gt; state that he died in Saint Petersburg.

His death was seen in Russia as a tragedy&amp;mdash;everybody knew him, he had a great value for the Russian ballet. An historian of Russian ballet {{Interlanguage link multi|Alexander Pleshcheyev|ru|3=Плещеев, Александр Алексеевич (журналист)}} wrote (''Our ballet: 1673-1899''): ''The art of Choreography suffered a great loss in the face of the deceased in Moscow as a dance teacher in the school, old man Frederick Malovergne'' (ru: «Хореографическое искусство понесло большую потерю в лице скончавшегося в Москве учителя танцев в школе, старика Фредерика Маловерн»&lt;ref name=PleNotreB&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PXOpasHus6oC&amp;pg=PA210 ru: Александр Плещеев. Наш балет (1673—1896), стр. 206]&lt;/ref&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3712">The '''project method''' is a medium of instruction which was introduced during the 18th century into the schools of architecture and engineering in Europe when graduating students had to apply the skills and knowledge they had learned in the course of their studies to problems they had to solve as practicians of their trade, for example, designing a monument, building a steam engine.&lt;ref&gt; Knoll, Michael (1997): [http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JITE/v34n3/Knoll.html The Project Method: Its Vocational Education Origin and International Development]. ''Journal of Industrial Teacher Education'' 34, 59-80.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th Century, [[William Heard Kilpatrick]]&lt;ref name="project"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kilpatrick|first=William Heard|title=The Project Method |year=1918|publisher=Teachers College Record|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VcVBAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=the+project+method&amp;dq=the+project+method&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_283TISVEILbnAet6tG1Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; expanded the project method into a philosophy of education. His device is child-centred and based in [[progressive education]]. Both approaches are used by teachers worldwide to this day.&lt;ref name="gutek2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gutek|first=Gerald L.|title=New Perspectives on Philosophy and Education|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|isbn=0-205-59433-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike traditional education, proponents of the project method attempt to allow the student to solve problems with as little teacher direction as possible. The teacher is seen more as a facilitator than a deliver of knowledge and information. 

Students in a project method environment should be allowed to explore and experience their environment through their senses and, in a sense, direct their own learning by their individual interests. Very little is taught from textbooks and the emphasis is on experiential learning, rather than rote and memorization. A project method classroom focuses on democracy and collaboration to solve "purposeful" problems.

Kilpatrick devised four classes of projects for his method: construction (such as writing a play), enjoyment (such as experiencing a concert), problem (for instance, discussing a complex social problem like poverty), and specific learning (learning of skills such as swimming).

'''Scholarly communication''' is the process by which [[academia|academics]], scholars, and researchers share and [[Academic publishing|publish their research findings]] so that they are available to the wider academic community and beyond.

== Definition ==
Scholarly communication can be defined as “the system through which research and other scholarly writings are created, evaluated for quality, disseminated to the scholarly community, and preserved for future use. The system includes both formal means of communication, such as publication in peer-reviewed journals, and informal channels, such as electronic listservs.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/acrl/publications/whitepapers/principlesstrategies|title=Principles and Strategies for the Reform of Scholarly Communication 1|last=admin|date=2006-09-01|language=en|access-date=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many issues with scholarly communications, which include [[author rights]], the [[peer review process]], the economics of scholarly resources, new models of publishing (including [[open access]] and [[institutional repository|institutional repositories]]), rights and access to federally funded research and preservation of intellectual assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://becker.wustl.edu/services/scholarly/whatis.html|title=Bernard Becker Medical Library|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
Common methods of scholarly communication include writings in a scholarly [[Academic journal|journal]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, books, E-only journals, reviews, preprints and [[working paper]]s, [[encyclopedia]]s, dictionaries, and annotated content, data, [[blog]]s, [[Internet forum|discussion forums]], professional and scholarly hubs and conference papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maron|first=Nancy L.|last2=Smith|first2=K. Kirby|date=2009-02-15|title=Current Models of Digital Scholarly Communication: Results of an Investigation Conducted by Ithaka Strategic Services for the Association of Research Libraries|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jep/3336451.0012.105?view=text;rgn=main|journal=The Journal of Electronic Publishing|volume=12|issue=1|doi=10.3998/3336451.0012.105|issn=1080-2711}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms, particularly in the [[arts]] and [[humanities]] include multimedia formats such as sound and video recordings. At the outset, the goal of most e-journal editors was the education of those who subscribed to their publication. Through this medium, users had an incentive to access the Internet and to become familiar with navigating the Web. The editors’ goals were similar to those of the library. Both wanted to provide access to journals, in order to help readers and patrons gain the knowledge to conduct further online research independently. Over time the role of the e-journal has transformed from an innovative education tool, to the primary means for delivery of scholarly content.

== Scholarly communication crisis ==
{{main article|Serials crisis}}The term "scholarly communications" has been in common usage at least since the mid-1970s, in recent years there has been widespread belief that the traditional system for disseminating scholarship has reached a state of crisis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.uconn.edu/about/publications/scholarlycommunication.html#Whatis|title=University of Connecticut Libraries|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.iastate.edu/libinfo/reptempl/scholcomm.html|title="The Crisis in Scholarly Communication", Iowa State University Communication|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (often referred to as the "publishing crisis" or "[[serials crisis]]")

The proliferation of new journals and the "twigging" of established journals into smaller sub-specialities, combined with rising prices, especially in the sciences, have dramatically reduced the capacity of research libraries to purchase resources required by their scholarly communities. All disciplines and formats are affected, the humanities and social sciences as well as the sciences, books as well as journals. The proliferation of electronic journals and the various pricing models for this information has further complicated the acquisitions issue, both for libraries and for publishers.

Many groups, including library consortia, research funders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_WTD002766.html|title=Open access policy - Wellcome|website=www.wellcome.ac.uk|accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; academics and universities have been calling for changes to the ways scholarly communication takes place, particularly in light of the Internet creating new and low cost methods to disseminate research, while still maintaining a 'peer review' process to ensure that the quality of research is maintained. To advance research in this area and to produce sustainable publication tools, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has funded a cohort of projects based on university campuses and at academic presses "to change scholarly practice in ways that advance teaching, research, preservation, and publication."&lt;ref&gt;Scholarly Communications | The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. (n.d.). Retrieved May 9, 2017, from https://mellon.org/programs/scholarly-communications/&lt;/ref&gt; Recent technological developments, such as [[open access]] and [[institutional repository|institutional repositories]] at universities are seen as vehicles for changing or improving the scholarly communication process.

Chief among the factors contributing to the perceived crisis is the academic reward system, which emphasizes quantity of publication. There is a consequent demand by scholars for peer-reviewed publication outlets. Another important cause is the commercialization and internationalization of scholarly publishing. The growing dominance of publishing conglomerates in scientific, technical, and medical fields, and to some degree in the social sciences, is of special concern to information professionals. Scholars, often indifferent to rights issues, transfer copyright to for-profit publishers, frequently for reports of research funded wholly or partially at public expense. Commercial publishers have established a highly profitable niche for themselves in the scholarly communication chain.{{see also|Scientific journal#Cost}}

== Scholarly communication and academic reward and reputation ==
{{Main article|Publish or perish}}
Scholarly communication is seen as a crucial part of research, and researchers - many of whom are lecturers and academics at universities - are often judged by their academic output and list of publications. Promotions will normally take into account the number of publications and how prestigious the journals they were published in (e.g. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[The Lancet]]'' are seen as very prestigious journals within the sciences). A researcher's publication list will help them create a positive reputation within their discipline. The proliferation of open access journals has facilitated this process by providing a means for scholars to publish their research regardless of perceived importance, as is the case with traditional journals. Publications such as [[PLOS ONE]] and [[Scientific Reports]] follow an author pay model, where the peer review and publishing service are provided for a one time cost to the writer. The material is then made available at no cost to others, who can then build on this research without limitation. This approach results in the acceptance and publishing of a greater percentage of submissions across a broader subject area.

== Scholarly communication and libraries ==
Libraries and librarians play a critical role in the aggregation, evaluation and dissemination of scholarly communication. The [http://acrl.ala.org/scholcomm/ Scholarly Communication Toolkit] was designed by the Research and Scholarly Environment Committee of the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) to support advocacy efforts designed to transform the scholarly communication landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://acrl.ala.org/scholcomm/|title=ACRL Scholarly Communication Toolkit|website=acrl.ala.org|access-date=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The future of research libraries will be shaped by broader developments at research universities in the areas of creating, sharing, disseminating, and curating knowledge. Universities face fundamental policy choices in all of the areas that have been recast by developments in information technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynch|first=Clifford|last2=Carleton|first2=Don E.|date=2009-04-09|title=Lecture: Impact of Digital Scholarship on Research Libraries|journal=Journal of Library Administration|volume=49|issue=3|pages=227–244|doi=10.1080/01930820902785041|issn=0193-0826}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current trends in digital scholarship practices across the humanities, science, and social science have significant implications for research libraries in academic institutions as a means of framing policy choices. 

Many research libraries have formalized the role of Scholarly Communications Librarian and defined specific responsibilities, including the implementation of outreach programs to increase awareness relative to [[Copyright law of the United States|copyright]] (particularly [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/108 section 108] of the US Copyright Act), [[open access]], and other scholarly communication issues. Through these types of programs, librarians have established their role relative to the structure of the library organization by formalizing the discussion of these issues in research and e-learning activities. They also contribute in teaching copyright literacy by being active in all stages of the research process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nilsson|first=I|year=2016|title=Developing new copyright services in academic libraries.

== Scholarly communication and data publishing ==
The modern research author requires a reliable and standardized method to make research data available to other members of their community. This need has resulted in the development of a new form of scholarly communication known as data publishing. The process involves making data accessible, reusable and citable for long term use and is more elaborate than simply providing access to a data file.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borgman|first=Christine L.|date=2008-01-01|title=Data, disciplines, and scholarly publishing|journal=Learned Publishing|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=29–38|doi=10.1087/095315108X254476|issn=1741-4857}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data is becoming an important element of scholarship as a sharable source to be reused and shared. The same data can be accessed by multiple researchers to ask new questions or to replicate research for verification and augmentation. Categories of data differ among disciplines, as does its accessibility. Many publications have begun to offer incentives to scholarly researchers to publish their data and have developed the necessary infrastructure in support of e-research. Technical, policy, and institutional factors are becoming more established. The next phase will see the integration of the process into a standardized data publishing methodology.

There are several types of data that researchers must to protect when collecting, handling, storing and sharing data to safeguard the confidentiality of contributors. There are three primary types of information. Personally identifiable information includes any data that allows the identity of an individual to whom the information applies to be realistically deduced by either direct or indirect means. Protected health information includes individually identifiable health information transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hipaa.com/|title=HIPAA.com - Compliance Made Easy|website=HIPAA.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sensitive information that should be protected include data that if it were disclosed would have a significant likelihood to cause psychological, social, emotional, physical, or reputation harm. A common approach for data sharing that includes confidential material is through de-identification or anonymization. There are numerous techniques for the de-identification of data including simply removing specific variables or by using statistical techniques such as top-coding, collapsing or combining, sampling, swapping, or disturbing the data. For qualitative data, redaction can be used to hide data elements that cannot be made public. However, it is important that future research requirements be taken into consideration when developing a de-identification or anonymization plan.

== Peer review and quality control ==
A key element of the scholarly communication process is ensuring that research meets a level of quality and is of scholarly merit. This is normally done through a process of [[peer review]], where other researchers in the same discipline review the research write up and decide if it is of sufficient quality. For example, in the case of a journal article, the author(s) of a piece of research will submit their article to a [[Academic journal|journal]], it will then be sent to a number of other academics who specialize in the same area to be peer reviewed. The journal will often receive many more articles than there is space to publish them, and it is in their interest to publish only those of the highest quality (which will over time increase the reputation of the journal). If the reviewers feel the article is of a high enough quality for the journal, they will often request some changes to be made and once these are done, accept the article for publication.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10323">In the United States education system, '''School Psychological Examiners''' assess the needs of students in schools for special education services or other interventions. The post requires a relevant postgraduate qualification and specialist training. This role is distinct within [[school psychology]] from that of the [[psychiatrist]], [[clinical psychologist]] and [[psychometrics|psychometrist]].


== Role of Psychological Examiners in schools ==
School Psychological Examiners are assessors licensed by a State Department of Education to work with students from pre-kindergarten to twelfth grade in public schools, interviewing, observing, and administering and interpreting standardized testing instruments that measure cognitive and academic abilities, or describe behavior, personality characteristics, attitude or aptitude, in order to determine eligibility for special education services, placement, or conduct re-evaluation, or occupational guidance and planning. 

The work of the School Psychological Examiners is both qualitative and quantitative in nature. They prepare psychoeducational evaluation reports based on test results and interpretation. Integrated with case history, the evaluation reports should present an accurate and clear profile of a student’s level of functioning or disability, strengths and weaknesses, compare test results with the standards of the evaluation instruments, analyze potential test biases, and develop appropriate recommendations to help direct educational interventions and services in a most inclusive and least restrictive environment. Evaluation reports are framed by laws and regulations applicable to testing and assessment in special education, and must follow school district policies and the codes of ethics applicable to education, special education, and psychological assessment.

School Psychological Examiners also provide psychoeducational interventions such as consultation services, collaboration in behavior management planning and monitoring, and devising social skills training programs in public schools.

Unless additionally trained and licensed, School Psychological Examiners do not offer or provide psychotherapy or clinical diagnostic/treatment services, which are attributions of licensed psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, as provided by law and professional regulations.

== Qualifications ==
School Psychological Examiners are highly trained and experienced educators who hold a master’s or higher degree in education or school counseling and at least one endorsement in special education. In addition to school district policies, School Psychological Examiners are bound by professional regulations, as well as by the ethical codes of testing and measurement. Other designations for School Psychological Examiners include ‘Educational Examiners’ or ‘Psychoeducational Examiners.’ Designation of this specialty varies among different school districts. 

'Psychometrist,’ from the term [[psychometrics]], is an occupational designation not inclusive of the broader faculties of School Psychological Examiners. Psychometrists deal exclusively with quantitative test administration, do not require coursework beyond the bachelor's level, or licensure by a state department of education. Training of psychometrists is primarily done on-the-job, and their services are valuable in mental health community agencies, assessment and institutional research, or test-producing companies, etc., rather than in K-12 schools.

== Graduate Training and Licensure of School Psychological Examiners ==
Typical training includes coursework beyond the Master of Education, Master of Science in Education, or Master of Arts in Teaching degrees. Currently, School Psychological Examiners complete the courses required by their state department of education rather than by a prescribed self-contained program of studies.  The coursework is equivalent to an entire Specialist or Doctoral Degree; unfortunately just a handful of institutions of higher education offer this kind of self-standing graduate program. Graduate courses of a psychological nature include:

* Special Education Law  
* Advanced Child and Adolescent Growth and Development 
* Psychology of Students with Exceptionalities 
* Abnormal Child and Adult Psychology 
* Advanced Statistics and Research in Education and Psychology
* Tests and measurements
* Assessment and Evaluation of the Individual
* Individual Intelligence quotient 
* Group  Assessment 
* Diagnostics and Remedial Reading 
* Ethical issues in education and psychological measurement and evaluation reporting
* Methods of Instructing Students with Mild/Moderate Disabilities 
* Methods of Instructing Students with Severe to Profound Disabilities 
* Survey of Guidance and Counseling Techniques
* Practicum for School Psychological Examiners (150 supervised contact hours).

Licensure as School Psychological Examiner demands experience in a special education or school counseling setting, satisfactory completion of the required graduate coursework and practicum, plus a passing score on the 'Praxis II Special Education: Knowledge-Based Core Principles'.  Graduate school recommendation and verification of experience by the employing school district complete the requirements. In addition to the practicum, on-the-job mentoring supervision for at least two school years, sometimes four years, allows the transition from initial licensure to standard professional licensure. An annual professional development plan and ongoing performance-based evaluation ensure 'High Quality' professionalism as required by the [[No Child Left Behind]] law and related regulations.

== Competencies ==

'''Sea|mester Global Programs''' is an organization which offers academic, study abroad programs on board two sailing vessels, ''[[Ocean Star (Schooner)|Ocean Star]]'' and ''[[Argo (Yacht)|Argo]]''. Sea|mester began running programs in 1998 as an extension from its sister organization [[ActionQuest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.actionquest.com/meet-aq/our-story-so-far/|title=The Story So Far|work=ActionQuest|access-date=2017-04-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full semester's course load is offered on board including classes in [[Oceanography]], [[Marine Biology]], Professional Skipper Certification Training, Leadership, Basic [[Seamanship]], and an Independent Research Project. Courses are accredited through the [[University of South Florida]] (USF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seamester.com/academics/|title=Discover your passion for learning - Sea{{!}}mester Academics|website=www.seamester.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
Sea|mester is an institution dedicated to the facilitation and development of practical watermanship skills and defining of academic interests in ocean and [[earth science]], while offering college credit and promoting personal growth, teamwork and leadership through a distinctive, experiential educational program based upon active participation and individual support.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seamester.com/aboutus.html?pid=29&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Sea|mester ran its first program in 1998 aboard two [[Beneteau]] [[monohull]]s. In 1999, Sea|mester acquired the [[schooner]] ''[[Ocean Star (Schooner)|Ocean Star]]'' and began running 80-day programs with high school graduates and college students.

''Ocean Star'' sails throughout the [[Caribbean]], from [[Tortola]] to [[Grenada]]. Occasionally, ''Ocean Star'' sails with another [[monohull]] or [[catamaran]], allowing berths for over 25 students.

The steady growth of Sea|mester with [[Ocean Star (schooner)|''Ocean Star'']] allowed for the expansion of its fleet with the design and construction of the schooner ''[[Argo (Yacht)|S/Y Argo]]''. ''[[Argo (Yacht)|Argo]]'' was built in [[Samut Prakan]], [[Thailand]] and completed in June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/the-superyacht-directory/argo--47101|title=ARGO|website=Boat International|language=en|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, [[Argo (Yacht)|''Argo'']] has been making her way around the globe with students. She had completed her first [[circumnavigation]] of the globe in December 2008 and was hoping to start her second during the spring of 2009.Unfortunately,  the vessel was unable to secure an escort from the [[US Navy]] or EU coalition through the [[pirate|pirate-]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;infested waters of the [[Gulf of Aden]] and had to head back to Asia to wait out the [[Monsoon]] season in order to sail south to [[Cape Town]]. Argo has completed her second circumnavigation via [[Cape Town]].

'''Sue Monk Kidd''' (born August 12, 1948) is a writer from Sylvester, Georgia, best known for her 2001 novel ''[[The Secret Life of Bees (novel)|The Secret Life of Bees]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Author/AuthorPage/0,,0_1000034248,00.html?sym=BIO|title=Sue Monk Kidd|publisher=Penguin Group USA|accessdate=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n85-157706|title=Kidd, Sue Monk|publisher=WorldCat Identities|accessdate=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education==
Kidd was born in [[Sylvester, Georgia]], and attended local schools. She graduated from [[Texas Christian University]] with a [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing|B.S. in nursing]] in 1970. She worked in her twenties as a [[Registered Nurse]] and college [[Nursing educator|nursing instructor]] at the [[Medical College of Georgia]].&lt;ref name=south/&gt;

She was influenced in her 20s by the writings of [[Thomas Merton]] to explore her inner life.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; In her 30s, she took writing courses at [[Emory University]] and Anderson College in South Carolina, now [[Anderson University (South Carolina)|Anderson University]], as well as studying at [[Sewanee Writers' Conference|Sewanee]], [[Bread Loaf Writers' Conference|Bread Loaf]], and other writers' conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About the Author |publisher=Sue Monk Kidd| url = http://suemonkkidd.com/author/ | accessdate =April 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
She got her start in writing when a personal essay she wrote for a writing class was published in ''[[Guideposts (magazine)|Guideposts]]'' and reprinted in ''[[Reader's Digest]]''. She went on to become a Contributing Editor at ''Guideposts''.

Her first three books were spiritual memoirs describing her experiences in contemplative [[Christianity]], the last telling the story of her journey from traditional Christianity to [[feminist theology]]. ''God's Joyful Surprise: Finding Yourself Loved'' ([[HarperCollins|Harper SanFrancisco]], 1988) is focused on abandoning a hopeless quest for perfection and accepting one is loved as one is. ''When the Heart Waits: Spiritual Direction for Life's Sacred Questions'' (Harper SanFrancisco, 1990) tells of her painful midlife crisis.  Finally, ''The Dance of the Dissident Daughter: A Woman's Journey from Christian Tradition to the Sacred Feminine'' (Harper SanFrancisco, 1996), discussed her encounter with women's spirituality.

Her first novel, ''[[The Secret Life of Bees (novel)|The Secret Life of Bees]]'' (2002), is set during the [[American Civil Rights Movement|American civil rights movement of 1964]],&lt;ref name=gua/&gt; telling the story of a white girl who runs away from home to live with a woman who now works as an independent bee-keeper and honey-maker with many of her sisters. It has been adapted as a play in New York by [[The American Place Theater]]. The novel was also adapted as a [[The Secret Life of Bees (film)|movie of the same name]] by Fox Searchlight, starring [[Dakota Fanning]], [[Queen Latifah]], [[Jennifer Hudson]], [[Alicia Keys]] and [[Sophie Okonedo]].

Her second novel, ''[[The Mermaid Chair]]'' (2005), won the [[Quill Award#2005 Quill Award winners|2005 Quill Award for General Fiction]]. The story concerns a woman who upon coming home to an island off the coast of South Carolina becomes attracted to a Benedictine monk who is just a few months short of taking his final vows. The title refers to a chair in his monastery carved with mermaids dedicated to a female saint said to be a mermaid before her conversion and who is patroness of the island. 
It was adapted as a 2006 Lifetime movie [[The Mermaid Chair (film)|of the same name]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |title=Giving Voice, and Finding Her Own: Sue Monk Kidd Tackles Race in 'The Invention of Wings' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/books/sue-monk-kidd-tackles-race-in-the-invention-of-wings.html |first=Felicia R. |last=Leejan|newspaper=New York Times |date=January 6, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, ''Firstlight'', a collection of Kidd's early writings, was published in hardcover by Guideposts Books; it was published in paperback by Penguin in 2007.

After traveling with her daughter, Ann Kidd Taylor, to sacred sites in Greece, Turkey, and France, Kidd and Taylor co-authored a memoir, Traveling with Pomegranates: A Mother-Daughter Story. Published by Viking in 2009, it appeared on numerous bestseller lists, including the New York Times list and has been published in several languages.

Her 2014 novel, ''The Invention of Wings'', is set during the antebellum years and based on the life of [[Sarah Grimké]], a 19th-century [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] and women's rights pioneer.&lt;ref name=gua&gt;{{cite web | title = The Invention of Wings by Sue Monk Kidd – review | newspaper= The Observer | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/05/invention-wings-monk-kidd-review|date=January 5, 2014|accessdate =April 23, 2014 | first = Anita | last = Sethi  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SUNDAY BOOK REVIEW: Taking Flight: 'The Invention of Wings,' by Sue Monk Kidd|first=Suzanne |last=Bernejan|date= January 24, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/books/review/the-invention-of-wings-by-sue-monk-kidd.html?_r=0 |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel debuted at No. 1 on [[New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] and was later selected for [[Oprah's Book Club 2.0]].

A '''teacher-librarian (TL)''', '''school librarian''', or '''school library media specialist (SLMS)''', is a certified [[librarian]] who also has training in [[teaching]]. According to the [[American Association of School Librarians]]  (AASL), a division of the [[American Library Association]] (ALA), the official title for a certified librarian who works in a school in the United States is '''school librarian'''.

==The roles of the school librarian== 
The school librarian performs four main leadership roles: teacher, instructional partner, information specialist, and program administrator. 

School librarians may read to children, assist them in selecting books, and assist with schoolwork. Some school librarians see classes on a "flexible schedule". A flexible schedule means that rather than having students come to the library for instruction at a fixed time every week, the classroom teacher schedules library time when the expertise of the school librarian, library and information skills, or materials are needed as part of a learning experience.

In the instructional partner role, school librarians collaborate with classroom teachers to create independent learners by fostering students' [[research]], [[information literacy]], technology, communication, and critical thinking skills. School librarians play a major role in infusing [[Information Literacy]] concepts and skills into secondary school curricula as well as enhances implementation of [[Information Literacy]] knowledge practices and dispositions into the secondary school education system. &lt;ref&gt;Grigas, Vincas; Mierzecka, Anna; Fedosejevaitė, Roma. (2018). School Librarians’ Attitudes Towards Teaching Information Literacy. In: Kurbanoğlu S., Boustany J., Špiranec S., Grassian E., Mizrachi D., Roy L. (eds). Information Literacy in the Workplace. ECIL 2017. Communications in Computer and Information Science, 810, 703-712. Springer, Cham.&lt;/ref&gt;

As information specialists, school librarians develop a resource base for the school by using the curriculum and student interests to identify and obtain library materials, organize and maintain the library collection in order to promote independent reading and lifelong learning. Materials in the library collection can be located using an Online Public Access Catalog ([[OPAC]])

This role also encompasses many activities relating to technology including the integration of resources in a variety of formats: periodical databases; Web sites; digital video segments; podcasts; blog and wiki content; digital images; virtual classrooms, etc.  School librarians are often responsible for audio-visual equipment and are sometimes in charge of school [[computer]]s and [[computer network]]s.  

As program administrators, school librarians define, lead, and manage school library media programs by establishing library policies; overseeing the library budget; planning the physical and virtual library space; and maintaining a welcoming, positive, and innovative learning atmosphere.  Librarians also maintain the collection by adding items to enhance curriculum and entice readers in order to have a good relationships with the patrons, both teachers and students.  Many times, librarians are also responsible for repairing damaged books and periodicals &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ala.org/aasl/sites/ala.org.aasl/files/content/guidelinesandstandards/learning4life/resources/sample_job_description_L4L.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Certification==
In the [[United States]], a teacher-librarian must have a baccalaureate degree and a certificate in [[secondary education|secondary]] or [[elementary education]], and must also complete a school library media program and gain a state certification. Programs in [[library science]] vary between institutions; however, state requirements must be met before a library media specialist is allowed to teach. Some school library media specialists hold the full Master of Library Science (MLS) or [[Master of Library and Information Science]] (MLIS) degree, while others do not.  In many instances, school librarians who have an MLS degree but do not have the requisite teaching credentials must obtain these teaching credentials and classroom teaching experience first before they are permitted to work as teacher-librarians. Often additional library science graduate coursework is required, focused specifically on issues pertaining to school librarianship.

==Professional organizations==
Teacher-librarians rely on the support of local, state, national, and international professional organizations for career and professional development, employment opportunities, and awards/grants/funding.  Groups like the [[International Association of School Librarianship]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iasl-online.org International Association of School Librarianship]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Association of School Librarians]]; the [[School Library Association]] in the United Kingdom and the [[Australian School Library Association]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://asla.org/au Australian School Library Association]&lt;/ref&gt; host websites, publish journals, and sponsor conferences, workshops, and other events which showcase current research and practices in the field.

In the United States, teacher-librarians are also supported by state organizations which advocate for teachers at the district and school level. A comprehensive list is available from the ALA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/aasl/aboutaasl/aaslgovernance/affiliateassembly/regions.cfm American Association for School Librarians (2008). ''AASL Affiliate Assembly Regions''. Retrieved December 6, 2008.]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation ==
In December 2015, school library programs fell under the benefits for the [[Every Student Succeeds Act]], a law that opens the use of federal funding for school library programs &lt;ref&gt;"School Library Legislation", American Library Association, September 11, 2015.  http://www.ala.org/advocacy/advleg/federallegislation/schoollibraries/leg (Accessed April 2, 2018)  Document ID: 8349bb8c-1b2f-e474-3dc0-2e6b0a82053f&lt;/ref&gt;.

Since 2010, it has been publishing annual national&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=URAP Türkiye Özel Bölümü|url=http://tr.urapcenter.org/|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and global&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Ranking|url=http://www.urapcenter.org/2014/world.php?q=MS0yNTA=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[college and university rankings]] for top 2000 institutions.  The [[scientometrics]] measurement of URAP  is based on data  obtained from the [[Institute for Scientific Information]] via [[Web of Science]] and inCites. For global rankings, URAP employs indicators of research performance including the number of articles, citation, total documents, article impact total, citation impact total, and international collaboration. In addition to global rankings, URAP publishes regional rankings for universities in [[Turkey]] using additional indicators such as the number of students and faculty members obtained from Center of Measuring, Selection and Placement [[ÖSYM]].

==Methodology==
URAP gathers data from international bibliometric databases such as [[Web of Science]] and InCites provided by the [[Institute for Scientific Information]]. URAP uses data of 2,500 Higher Education Institutions (HEI) with highest number of articles published. The overall score of each HEI is based on its performance over several indicators. Of 2500 selected HEIs, the top 2000 are included in the rankings published by URAP. Field based rankings are performed on 23 fields based on Australia ERA.&lt;ref name=era&gt;{{cite web|title=ERA 2015, Excellence in Research for Australia|url=http://www.arc.gov.au/era/era_2015/era_2015.htm|accessdate=23 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401065628/http://www.arc.gov.au/era/era_2015/era_2015.htm|archive-date=2015-04-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indicators===

URAP uses 6 main indicator to measure the academic performance. These indicators are number of articles, citation, total documents, article impact total, citation impact total, and international collaboration. The raw bibliometric data underlying URAP's 6 main indicators have highly skewed distribution. To address this issue, the median of the indicators have been used. The Delphi system was conducted with a group of experts to assign weighting scores to the indicators. Total score of 600 is distributed to indicators. URAP uses additional indicators for ranking universities in [[Turkey]] including  the number of students and faculty members.
The following table shows the indicators used for global rankings in URAP as of 2014.

====Number of articles====
Number of articles is used as a measure of current scientific productivity which includes articles indexed by Web of Science. This indicator covers articles, reviews and notes. The weight of this indicator in the overall ranking is %21.

====Citation====

Citation, as an indicator in URAP ranking, is a measure of research impact. It is scored according to the total number of citations received. The weight of this indicator in the overall ranking is %21.

====Total documents====
Total documents is the measure of sustainability and continuity of scientific productivity. The total document count covers all scholarly literature provided by the Web of Science database, including conference papers, reviews, letters, discussions, scripts, and journal articles. The weight of this indicator in the overall ranking is %10.

====Article Impact Total (AIT)====

Article Impact Total (AIT) is a measure of scientific productivity adjusted by the ratio of institution's Citation Per Publication (CPP) to the world CPP in 23 subject areas. The ratio of the institution's CPP and the world CPP indicates whether the institution is performing above or below the world average in that field. This ratio is multiplied by the number of publications in that field and then summed across the 23 fields, as shown in the following formula:

&lt;math&gt; AIT = \sum_{i=1}^{23} \Bigg[ \Bigg( \frac{CPP_i}{CPP\_{World_i}} \Bigg) * Articles_i \Bigg]    &lt;/math&gt;

The weight of this indicator in the overall ranking is %18.

====Citation Impact Total (CIT)====
Citation Impact Total (CIT) is a measure of research impact corrected by the institution's normalized CPP with respect to the world CPP in 23 subject areas. The ratio of the institution's CPP and the world CPP indicates whether the institution is performing above or below the world average in that field. This ratio is multiplied by the number of citations in that field and then summed across the 23 fields, as shown in the following formula:

&lt;math&gt; CIT = \sum_{i=1}^{23} \Bigg[ \Bigg( \frac{CPP_i}{CPP\_{World_i}} \Bigg) * Citations_i \Bigg]  &lt;/math&gt;

The weight of this indicator in the overall ranking is %15.

====International collaboration====

International Collaboration is a measure of global acceptance of the institution.  International collaboration data, which is based on the total number of published studies conducted  in collaboration with foreign universities, is obtained from InCites.  The weight of this indicator in the overall ranking is %15.

==Commentary and reception==

URAP covers considerably more institutions than other major ranking systems. In a section about URAP in  “Where Are the Global Rankings Leading Us? An Analysis of Recent Methodological Changes and New Developments” published in  the [[European Journal of Education]] it is mentioned that ”While it is less well-known than SRG, ARWU, THE, and QS, it is interesting because it published a list of 2000 universities, while the above rankings cover a maximum of 700 universities.”&lt;ref name=where&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rauhvargers|first1=Andrejs|title=Where Are the Global Rankings Leading Us?

It indicates that URAP, along with [[SCImago]] ranking system, “fill an important gap in the rankings market in that their indicators measure the performance of substantially more universities, up to 2000 in the case of URAP and over 3000 in SCImago, compared to only 400 in THE, 500 in SRC ARWU, NTU ranking and CWTS Leiden, and around 700 in QS.”&lt;ref name=eua&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rauhvargers|first1=Andrejs|title=Global university rankings and their impact : report II|date=2013|publisher=European University Association|location=Brussels|isbn=9789078997412|page=65|url=http://kisefront01.ki.se/sites/default/files/eua_global_university_rankings_and_their_impact_report_ii.pdf|accessdate=23 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408052709/http://kisefront01.ki.se/sites/default/files/eua_global_university_rankings_and_their_impact_report_ii.pdf|archive-date=2015-04-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

URAP is mentioned as one the four ranking systems that solely measure the academic performance. The other three are [[Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities]] , [[CWTS Leiden Ranking]], and SCImago Institutions Rankings.&lt;ref name=partial&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jajo|first1=Nethal K.|last2=Harrison|first2=Jen|title=World university ranking systems: an alternative approach using partial least squares path modelling|journal=Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management|date=11 July 2014|volume=36|issue=5|page=473|doi=10.1080/1360080X.2014.936090|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1360080X.2014.936090#.VRAPQN93MjM}}&lt;/ref&gt; URAP excludes teaching indicators, such as student quality and teaching performance, from global rankings and only covers research-oriented indicators.&lt;ref name=where /&gt;&lt;ref name=ireg&gt;{{cite web|title=The URAP Ranking|url=http://www.ireg-observatory.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=307&amp;Itemid=1|website=IREG Observatory on Academic Ranking and Excellence|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the  “International Benchmarking in UK higher Education”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boxall,|first1=Mike|last2=Webb,|first2=Andrew|last3=Ramsden|first3=Brian|title=International Benchmarking in UK Higher Education|date=2011|publisher=PA Consulting Group|location=London|page=11|url=https://www.hesa.ac.uk/pr167|accessdate=23 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330083922/https://www.hesa.ac.uk/pr167|archive-date=2015-03-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; report  of the [[Higher Education Statistics Agency]], URAP is listed among the benchmarking resources  for measuring academic. In the same report, URAP is categorized in the  “whole university rankings” along with [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]] (THE), [[QS World University Rankings]], [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]] (ARWU),  CHE Excellence Rankings, RatER Global University Ranking of World Universities, [[Webometrics Ranking of World Universities]],  2010 World University Ranking, SIR World Report, [[CWTS Leiden Ranking]], U-Multirank,  European Research Ranking, [[Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities]],  Human Resources &amp; Labor Review (HRLR), and Professional Classification of Higher Education Institutions.

===URAP in Research, Books, and Reports===
URAP is mentioned and used in  several studies based on, or referring to,  global rankings. In the “World University Ranking Systems: An Alternative Approach Using Partial Least Squares Path Modeling”&lt;ref name=partial /&gt; article, published in the Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/cjhe20/current#.VRAWCd93MjM|publisher=Taylor and Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urap is incorporated in the suggested model as one of the nine major worldwide university ranking systems along with ARWU, QS, Times, Webometrics, Taiwan. Leiden, SIR, and CWUR. In the same article, URAP is categorized among the ranking systems that are based solely on publication performance. The other ranking systems in the same category are [[Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities]] , [[CWTS Leiden Ranking]], and SCImago Institutions Rankings.

==Criticism==
The indicators used in URAP are absolute values and size-dependent making it biased towards larger institutions.&lt;ref name=eua /&gt;&lt;ref name=ireg /&gt; 
According to the  “EUA report on Ranking for 2013“ published by the [[European University Association]],  URAP disregards books, excludes studies in arts and humanities areas, and under-represents social sciences. Furthermore,  URAP does not employ any compensation for different publication cultures due to the lack of field-normalization of the results of bibliometric indicators. The report further states that “The results of the indicator on citation numbers in particular, as well as those on publication counts, are thus skewed towards the natural sciences and especially medicine.” It also states that excluding teaching indicators by URAP makes its  focus solely on research-oriented institutions.&lt;ref name=eua /&gt;

The “University Ranking Lists: A directory” report  published by the Division for Analysis and Evaluation of the [[University of Gothenburg]] points out  a problem that might arise from including more than 500 institutions in the ranking system. It states that “It [URAP] lists 2000 universities, and the purpose is to provide a ranking that covers not only institutions in the Western elite group. This purpose contrasts starkly with other ranking producers’ decisions not to publish more than the 400-500 top positions of their lists, since they do not consider their methods reliable below that level. [URAP] do not comment this problem.”&lt;ref name=gothenburg /&gt;
