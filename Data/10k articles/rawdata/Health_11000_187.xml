'''Body odor''' ([[American English]]) or '''body odour''' ([[British English]]) is present in [[human]]s and other animals, and its intensity can be influenced by many factors (behavioral patterns, survival strategies). Body odor has a strong genetic basis, but it can be also strongly influenced by various diseases and physiological conditions. Body odor is generally considered to be an unpleasant odor among many human cultures.

==Causes==
{{See also|Biochemistry of body odor}}

In humans, the formation of body odors is caused by factors such as diet, gender, health, and medication, but the major contribution comes from [[bacteria]]l activity on [[skin gland]] [[secretion]]s.&lt;ref name="lund-4"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lundström |first=Johan N. |last2=Olsson |first2=Mats J. |title=Pheromones |year=2010 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-381516-3 |chapter=Functional Neuronal Processing of Human Body Odors|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have three types of sweat glands; [[eccrine sweat glands]], [[apocrine sweat gland]]s and [[sebaceous gland]]s. Eccrine sweat glands are present from birth, while the two latter become activated during puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://greatist.com/health/biology-body-odor|title=The Biology of Body Odor|author=|date=13 March 2012|website=greatist.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the different types of human skin glands, the body odor is primarily the result of the apocrine sweat glands, which secrete the majority of chemical compounds needed for the [[skin flora]] to metabolize it into odorant substances.&lt;ref name="lund-4"/&gt; This happens mostly in the axillary (armpit) region, although the gland can also be found in the [[areola]], anogenital region, and around the [[navel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Turkington| first=Carol| last2=Dover| first2=Jeffrey S.| title=The encyclopedia of skin and skin disorders| year=2007| publisher=Facts on File|location=New York| isbn=978-0-8160-6403-8| pages=363| edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, the [[armpit]] regions seem more important than the genital region for body odor which may be related to human [[bipedalism]]. The genital and armpit regions also contain springy hairs which help diffuse body odors.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007/&gt;

The main components of human axillary odor are [[Saturated fat|unsaturated]] or [[hydroxylated branched fatty acids]] with E-3M2H (E-3-methylhex-2-enoic acid) and HMHA (3-hydroxy-3-methylhexanoic acid), sulfanylalkanols and particularly 3M3SH (3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol), and the odoriferous steroids androstenone (5α-androst-16-en-3-one) and androstenol (5α-androst-16-en-3α-ol).&lt;ref name=martessbio/&gt; E-3M2H is bound and carried by two apocrine secretion odor-binding proteins, ASOB1 and ASOB2, to the skin surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeng|first=C.|author2=Spielman, A.

Body odor is influenced by the actions of the [[skin flora]], including members of ''[[Corynebacterium]]'', which manufacture enzymes called [[lipases]] that break down the lipids in sweat to create smaller molecules like [[butyric acid]]. Greater bacteria populations of ''[[Corynebacterium jeikeium]]'' are for example found more in the armpits of men whereas greater population numbers of ''[[Staphylococcus haemolyticus]]'' are found in the armpits of women. This causes male armpits to give off of a rancid/cheese-like smell whereas female armpits give off a more fruity/onion-like smell.&lt;ref&gt;De microbemens by Remco Kort&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Staphylococcus hominis]]'' is also known for producing thioalcohol compounds that contribute to odors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150330213947.htm|title=Bacterial genetic pathway involved in body odor production discovered|author=|date=|website=sciencedaily.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These smaller molecules smell, and give body odor its characteristic aroma.&lt;ref&gt;Buckman, Robert (2003). Human Wildlife: The Life That Lives On Us. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 93-4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Propionic acid]] (propanoic acid) is present in many sweat samples. This acid is a breakdown product of some [[amino acid]]s by [[propionibacteria]], which thrive in the ducts of adolescent and adult [[sebaceous]] glands. Because propionic acid is chemically similar to [[acetic acid]] with similar characteristics including odor, body odors may be identified as having a vinegar-like smell by certain people.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} [[Isovaleric acid]] (3-methyl butanoic acid) is the other source of body odor as a result of actions of the bacteria ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ara K |title=Foot odor due to microbial metabolism and its control |journal=Can.

Factors such as food, drink, and diseases can affect body odor.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007/&gt; An individual's body odor is also influenced by [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], [[sex]], [[genetics]], and [[medication]]. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Function==
{{See also|Pheromone}}

===Animals===
In many animals, body odor plays an important survival function. Strong body odor can be a [[warning signal]] for predators to stay away (such as [[North American porcupine#Stink|porcupine stink]]), or it can also be a signal that the prey animal is [[unpalatable]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruxton, Graeme D., Thomas N. Sherratt, and Michael P. Speed. 2004. Avoiding attack. The evolutionary ecology of crypsis, warning signals, and mimicry. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some animals species, who feign death to survive (like [[opossum]]s), in this state produce a strong body odor to deceive a predator that the prey animal has been dead for a long time and is already in the advanced stage of decomposing. Some animals with strong body odor are rarely attacked by most predators, although they can still be killed and eaten by birds of prey, which are tolerant of carrion odors.

Body odor is an important feature of animal physiology. It plays a different role in different animal species. For example, in some predator species that hunt by stalking (such as big and small [[cat]]s), the absence of body odor is important, and they spend plenty of time and energy to keep their body free of odor. For other predators, which use endurance running after the visually located prey as a hunting strategy ([[dog]]s, [[Gray wolf|wolves]]), the absence of body odor is not critical. In most animals, body odor intensifies in moments of stress and danger.

===Humans===
[[Sebaceous]] and [[apocrine gland]]s become active at [[puberty]]. This, as well as many apocrine glands being close to the sex organs, points to a role related to mating.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007/&gt; Compared to other primates, humans have extensive axillary hair and have many odor producing sources, in particular many apocrine glands.&lt;ref name=AEP/&gt; In women, the sense of olfaction is strongest around the time of [[ovulation]], significantly stronger than during other phases of the [[menstrual cycle]] and also stronger than the sense in males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Navarrete-Palacios E, Hudson R, Reyes-Guerrero G, Guevara-Guzmán R |title=Lower olfactory threshold during the ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle |journal=Biological Psychology |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=269–79 |date=July 2003 |pmid=12853171 |doi=10.1016/S0301-0511(03)00076-0 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans can olfactorily detect blood-related kin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0031-9384(85)90210-0 |vauthors=Porter RH, Cernoch JM, Balogh RD |year=1985 |title=Odor signatures and kin recognition |url= |journal=Physiol Behav |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=445–48 |pmid=4011726}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers can identify by body odor their biological children, but not their stepchildren. Preadolescent children can olfactorily detect their full siblings, but not half-siblings or step-siblings, and this might explain [[inbreeding avoidance|incest avoidance]] and the [[Westermarck effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12810039 |volume=85 |issue=3 |journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology |date=July 2003 |title=Possible olfaction-based mechanisms in human kin recognition and inbreeding avoidance |pages=279–95 |vauthors=Weisfeld GE, Czilli T, Phillips KA, Gall JA, Lichtman CM |doi=10.1016/S0022-0965(03)00061-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babies can recognize their mothers by smell while mothers, fathers, and other relatives can identify a baby by smell.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007/&gt;

Humans have few olfactory receptor cells compared to dogs and few functional olfactory receptor genes compared to rats. This is in part due to a reduction of the size of the snout in order to achieve [[depth perception]] as well as other changes related to bipedalism. However, it has been argued that humans may have larger brain areas associated with olfactory perception compared to other species.&lt;ref name=AEP&gt;S. Craig Roberts and Jan Havlicek. "Evolutionary psychology and perfume design". In {{Cite book | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S. C. | editor1-last = Roberts | doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586073.001.0001 | editor1-first = S. Craig | title = Applied Evolutionary Psychology | year = 2011 | publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 9780199586073 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have suggested that people might be using odor cues associated with the immune system to select mates. Using a brain-imaging technique, Swedish researchers have shown that [[homosexuality|homosexual]] and [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] males' brains respond in different ways to two odors that may be involved in sexual arousal, and that homosexual men respond in the same way as heterosexual women, though it could not be determined whether this was cause or effect. When the study was expanded to include lesbian women; the results were consistent with previous findings meaning that lesbian women were not as responsive to male-identified odors, while their response to female cues was similar to heterosexual males'.&lt;ref&gt;Savic, I."[http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0600331103v1?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=ivanka&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT Brain response to putative pheromones in lesbian women]." PNAS, May 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the researchers, this research suggests a possible role for human pheromones in the biological basis of [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;Wade, N. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/09/science/09cnd-smell.html Homosexual Men are found to have Different Scent of Attraction]." NY Times, May 9, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==
{{See also|Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection|Body odor and subconscious human sexual attraction}}
Body odor is largely influenced by [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) molecules. These are genetically determined and play an important role in [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] of the organism. The [[vomeronasal organ]] contains cells sensitive to MHC molecules in a genotype-specific way.

Experiments on animals and volunteers have shown that potential sexual partners tend to be perceived more attractive if their MHC composition is substantially different. Married couples are more different regarding MHC genes than would be expected by chance. This behavior pattern promotes variability of the immune system of individuals in the population, thus making the population more robust against new diseases. Another reason may be to prevent [[inbreeding]].&lt;ref name=Oxford2007&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, Edited by Robin Dunbar and Louise Barret, Oxford University Press, 2007, Chapter 22 Body odours and body odour preferences in humans by Claus Wedekind&lt;/ref&gt;

Body odor may be reduced or prevented or even aggravated by using [[deodorant]]s, [[antiperspirant]]s, [[disinfectant]]s, [[underarm liners]], [[triclosan]], special soaps or foams with antiseptic plant extracts such as [[Plantago major|ribwort]] and [[liquorice]], [[chlorophyllin]] ointments and sprays topically, and chlorophyllin supplements internally. Although body odor is commonly associated with [[hygiene]] practices, its presentation can be affected by changes in [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] as well as the other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdhealthnetwork.org/BodyOder.html |title=Learn How to Fight Body Odor |accessdate=2007-07-05 |website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As many as 90% of Americans and 92% of teenagers use antiperspirants or deodorants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2014/08/antiperspirants_alter_your_armpit_bacteria_and_could_actually_make_you_smell_worse.html|title=Antiperspirants Alter Your Armpit Bacteria and Could Actually Make You Smell Worse |author=Ross Pomeroy|publisher=realclearscience.com|access-date=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/even-if-you-dont-smell-you-probably-use-deodorant|title=Genetically, Some of Us Never Have Body Odor, But We Still Think We're Smelly|author=Austin Considine|publisher=motherboard.vice.com|access-date=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the global market for deodorants was estimated at 13.00 billion USD with a compound annual growth rate of 5.62% between 2015 and 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gosreports.com/global-deodorants-market-is-expected-to-reach-usd-17-55-billion-by-2020/|title=Global Deodorants Market is Expected to Reach USD 17.55 Billion by 2020|publisher=gosreports.com|access-date=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical conditions==
The condition can be known medically as bromhidrosis, apocrine bromhidrosis, osmidrosis, ozochrotia, fetid sweat, body smell, or malodorous sweating.&lt;ref&gt;James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). ''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology''. (10th ed.). Saunders. p. 779. {{ISBN|0-7216-2921-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, et al. (2003). ''Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine''. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. p. 707. {{ISBN|0-07-138076-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Osmidrosis or bromhidrosis is defined by a foul odor due to a water-rich environment that supports bacteria, which is caused by an abnormal increase in perspiration ([[hyperhidrosis]]).&lt;ref name=kanlay/&gt; This can be particularly strong when it happens in the axillary region (underarms). In this case, the condition may be referred to an axillary osmidrosis.&lt;ref name=kanlay/&gt;

[[Trimethylaminuria]] (TMAU), also known as fish odor syndrome or fish malodor syndrome, is a rare metabolic disorder where trimethylamine is released in the person's sweat, urine, and breath, giving off a strong fishy odor or strong body odor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/173478.php|title=Body Odor: Causes, Prevention, Treatments|work=Medical News Today|access-date=2017-03-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cannabis in East Timor''' is illegal.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

A 2012 assessment undertaken on behalf of the [[UNFPA]] noted that cannabis was easily available in East Timor, often termed "ganja", with "coklat" appearing to refer to hashish. Cannabis was believed to be grown locally, usually bought and smoked in a pre-rolled joint, while hashish (smoked mixed with tobacco in a cigarette or sometimes a bong) was believed to be smuggled from Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Drug Use in Timor-Leste: An Assessment|year=2012|author=Conducted by: Aardvark Consulting Co.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23177">'''Capital punishment in France''' (French: ''peine de mort en France'') is banned by Article 66-1 of the [[Constitution of France|Constitution of the French Republic]], voted as a [[constitutional amendment]] by the [[Congress of the French Parliament]] on 19 February 2007 and simply stating "No one can be sentenced to death" (French: ''Nul ne peut être condamné à mort''). The death penalty was already declared illegal on 9 October 1981 when President [[François Mitterrand]] signed a law prohibiting the judicial system from using it and commuting the sentences of the six people on death row to life imprisonment. The last [[Capital punishment|execution]] took place by [[guillotine]], being the main legal method since the [[French Revolution]]; [[Hamida Djandoubi]], a Tunisian citizen convicted of torture and murder on French soil, who was put to death in September 1977 in [[Marseille]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bnd.com/living/liv-columns-blogs/answer-man/article133460934.html|title=The guillotine is named after a man who hated capital punishment|work=bnd|access-date=2017-09-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major opponents to the death penalty in French history include philosopher [[Voltaire]], poet [[Victor Hugo]], politicians [[Léon Gambetta]], [[Jean Jaurès]] and [[Aristide Briand]], and writers [[Alphonse de Lamartine]] and [[Albert Camus]].

== History ==
=== Ancien Régime ===
Prior to 1791, under the [[Ancien Régime]], there existed a variety of means of capital punishment in [[France]], depending on the crime and the status of the condemned person.
* [[Hanging]] was the most common punishment. 
* [[Decapitation]] by sword was reserved for nobles.
* [[Burning]] for [[heretics]] and [[arsonists]]. The convict was occasionally discreetly [[Strangling|strangled]].
* [[Breaking wheel]] for [[brigand]]s and [[murder]]ers. The convict could be [[Strangling|strangled]] before having his limbs broken or after, depending on the atrocity of his crime.
* [[Death by boiling]] for [[counterfeiter]]s.
* [[Dismemberment]] for [[high treason]], [[parricide]]s, [[regicide]]s.

=== Adoption of the guillotine ===
[[File:Execution de Robespierre full.jpg|thumb|right|Robespierre and associates executed 1794]]
[[File:France - Public execution on Guillotine 1897.jpg|thumb|right|Public execution by guillotine in [[Lons-le-Saunier]], 1897]]

The first campaign towards the abolition of the death penalty began on 30 May 1791, but on 6 October that year the National Assembly refused to pass a law abolishing the death penalty. However, they did abolish torture, and also declared that there would now be only one method of execution: 'Tout condamné à mort aura la tête tranchée' (All condemned to death will have their heads cut off).{{clarify|date=December 2013}}

The guillotine had been proposed as a means of execution in 1789 by [[Joseph-Ignace Guillotin]]. The French Revolution marked the end of hanging by requiring all executions to be accomplished by means of the blade, rather than reserving it only for nobles. However, as beheading by a hand-held axe or blade was a comparatively inefficient and unreliable method of execution compared with hanging, the mechanical guillotine was adopted; it was also regarded as a more humane way to take the life of the condemned than earlier messy ways of execution. The device was first used on [[Nicolas Jacques Pelletier]] on 25 April 1792.  Guillotine usage then spread to other countries such as Germany (where it had been used since before the revolution), Italy, Sweden (used in a single execution), and French colonies in Africa, [[French Guiana]] and [[French Indochina]].

=== 1939 onwards ===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
Public executions were the norm and continued until 1939. From the mid-19th century, the usual time of day for executions changed from around 3 pm to morning and then to dawn. Executions had been carried out in large central public spaces such as market squares but gradually moved towards the local prison. In the early 20th century, the guillotine was set up just outside the prison gates. The last person to be publicly guillotined was six-time murderer [[Eugen Weidmann]] who was executed on 17 June 1939 outside the St-Pierre prison in Versailles. Photographs of the execution appeared in the press, and apparently this spectacle led the government to stop public executions and to hold them instead in prison courtyards, such as [[La Santé Prison]] in Paris. Following the law, the first to be guillotined inside a prison was Jean Dehaene, who had murdered his estranged wife and father-in-law, executed on 19 July 1939 at [[St-Brieuc]].

The 1940s and the [[Second World War|wartime period]] saw an increase in the number of executions, including the first executions of women since the 19th century.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

[[Marie-Louise Giraud]] was executed on 30 July 1943 for being an abortionist, which was labeled a crime against state security.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

In the 1950s to the 1970s, the number of executions steadily decreased, with for example President [[Georges Pompidou]], between 1969 and 1974, giving clemency to all but three people out of the fifteen sentenced to death.  President [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] oversaw the last executions.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

Up to 1981, the French penal code&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/dossiers/abolition-peine-mort/guillotine.shtml#eztoc20079_5_4 |title=L'application de la peine de mort en France avant 1981 - L'abolition de la peine de mort en France - Dossiers - La Documentation française |publisher=Ladocumentationfrancaise.fr |date=2001-10-08 |accessdate=2015-02-18|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that:
* Article 12: "Any person sentenced to death shall have his head cut off."
* Article 13: "By exception to article 12, when the death penalty is handed down for crimes against the safety of the State, execution shall take place by firing squad."
* Article 14: "If the families of the executed persons wish to reclaim the bodies, they shall have them; it shall then be for them to have them buried without any pomp."
In addition, crimes such as treason, espionage, insurrection, [[piracy]], [[Murder (French law)|aggravated murder]], kidnapping with torture, felonies committed with the use of [[torture]], setting a bomb in a street, arson of a dwelling house, and [[armed robbery]] made their authors liable to the death penalty; moreover, committing some military offenses such as [[mutiny]] or [[desertion]] or being [[accomplice]] or [[attempt]]ing to commit a capital felony were also capital offenses.

==== Clemency ====
The exclusive right to commute the death sentence belonged to the [[President of France|President of the Republic]], as in earlier ages it had belonged to the Monarch.

President [[Charles de Gaulle]], who supported the death penalty, commuted 19 death sentences and during his term of office, 13 people were guillotined, and a few others executed by [[firing squad]] for crimes against the security of the state (the last of those was [[Organisation de l'armée secrète|OAS]] member, Lt. Colonel [[Jean-Marie Bastien-Thiry]], who was an organizer of the famous assassination attempt on de Gaulle in 1962).

There were no executions during two-term Interim President [[Alain Poher]], in 1969 and 1974.

President [[Georges Pompidou]], who was personally a death penalty opponent, commuted all but three death sentences imposed during his term.

President [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]], who, according to his own words, "felt a deep aversion to the death penalty," also commuted all but three death sentences. He was President at the time of the last execution in France.

==== Amnesties ====
One of the examples of general amnesty for all people sentenced to death and awaiting execution took place in 1959 when, after De Gaulle's inauguration, all sentences were commuted&lt;ref&gt;[[Aleksander Hall]], ''Charles de Gaulle'', p. 291, Iskry, [[Warsaw]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; (amnesty is not an executive clemency, rather it is an Act of Parliament).

== Abolition ==
The first official debate on the death penalty in France took place on 30 May 1791, with the presentation of a bill aimed at abolishing it. The advocate was [[Louis-Michel Lepeletier of Saint-Fargeau]] and the bill was supported by [[Maximilien de Robespierre]]. However, the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]], on 6 October 1791, refused to abolish the death penalty.

On 26 October 1795, the National Convention abolished capital punishment, but only to signify the day of general peace. With the arrival of Napoleon Bonaparte, the death penalty was reinstated on 12 February 1810, in the French Imperial Penal Code.

The President of the Republic [[Armand Fallières]], a supporter of abolition, continued to systematically pardon every convict condemned to death over the first three years of his seven-year office.

In 1906 the Commission of the Budget of the Chamber of Deputies voted for withdrawing funding for the guillotine, with the aim of stopping the execution procedure. On 3 July 1908 the [[Garde des Sceaux]], [[Aristide Briand]], submitted a draft law to the Deputies, dated November 1906, on the abolition of the death penalty, but, despite the support of [[Jean Jaurès]], the bill was rejected on 8 December by 330 votes to 201.

Under the pro-[[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Vichy France|Vichy Regime]], [[Philippe Pétain|Marshal Pétain]] refused to pardon five women due to be guillotined (something that had not occurred for more than 50 years). Pétain himself was sentenced to death following the overthrow of the Vichy Regime, but General Charles de Gaulle commuted Pétain's sentence to life imprisonment on the grounds of old age (89). Other Vichy officials, including notably [[Pierre Laval]], were not so fortunate and were shot. Under [[Vincent Auriol]]'s presidency, three more women were beheaded; one in Algeria and two in France. The last Frenchwoman to be beheaded (Germaine Leloy-Godefroy) was executed in [[Angers]] in 1949. In 1963, Lt. Colonel [[Jean-Marie Bastien-Thiry]]  the last person executed by a [[firing squad]].

Having been defended by lawyer [[Robert Badinter]], [[Patrick Henry affair|Patrick Henry]] narrowly escaped being condemned to death on 20 January 1977 for the murder of a child. Numerous newspapers predicted the end of the death penalty. On 10 September 1977, [[Hamida Djandoubi]] was guillotined; he would be the last person executed in France.

Robert Badinter, a longtime opponent of capital punishment and the defending lawyer of some of the last men to be executed, became minister of justice and proposed the final abolition of the death penalty in 1981, which was pushed through the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] with the backing of newly elected president [[François Mitterrand]].

===Abolition process in 1981===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
* 16 March 1981: during the [[French presidential election, 1981|presidential election campaign]], [[François Mitterrand]] declared that he was against the death penalty. This was taken up in the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]]'s [[110 Propositions for France]] electoral program, along with other justice reforms. Mitterrand was elected [[President of the French Republic|President]] on 10 May.
* 25 May: François Mitterrand pardoned Philippe Maurice, the last person condemned to death to be pardoned.
* 26 August: the Council of Ministers approved the bill to abolish the death penalty.
* 17 September: [[Robert Badinter]] presented the bill to the [[National Assembly (France)|Assemblée Nationale]]. It passed on 18 September, by 363 votes to 117.
* 30 September: several amendments were rejected in the [[French Senate|Sénat]]. The law was officially passed by the two chambers.
* 9 October: the law was promulgated. The last Western European country to practise the death penalty abolished it.

==Current status==
Today, although a few French politicians (notably the far-right [[National Front (France)|Front national]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; former leader [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]) declare themselves to be in favour of the death penalty, its re-establishment would not be possible without the unilateral French rejection of several international [[Treaty|treaties]].  Repudiation of international treaties is not unknown to the French system, as France renounced its obligations under the [[NATO]] treaty in 1966, though it rejoined the pact in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/11/AR2009031100547.html |title=After 43 Years, France to Rejoin NATO as Full Member |first=Edward |last=Cody |date=March 12, 2009 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 December 1985, France ratified Additional Protocol number 6 to the [[European Convention on Human Rights|European Convention]] to Safeguard [[Human Rights]] and fundamental [[Liberty|liberties]]. This means that France can no longer re-establish the death penalty, except in times of war or by denouncing the Convention.

On 21 June 2001, [[Jacques Chirac]] sent a letter to the association "Ensemble" saying he was against the death penalty: "It's a fight we have to lead with determination and conviction, Because no justice is infallible and each execution can kill an innocent; because nothing can legitimise the execution of minors or of people suffering from mental deficiencies; because death can never constitute an act of justice." On 3 May 2002, France and 30 other countries signed Protocol number 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights. This forbids the death penalty in all circumstances, even in times of war. It went into effect on 1 July 2003, after having been ratified by 10 states.

Despite the above, in 2004, a law proposition (number 1521&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/dossiers/041521.asp |title=Assemblée nationale - Rétablissement de la peine de mort pour les terroristes |publisher=Assemblee-nationale.fr |date= |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was placed before the [[French National Assembly]], suggesting re-establishment of the death penalty for [[terrorist]] acts.  The bill was not adopted. On 3 January 2006, Jacques Chirac announced a revision of the [[French Constitution|Constitution]] aimed at writing out the death penalty. (On the previous 13 October, the Constitutional Council had deemed the ratification of the Second Optional Protocol to the international pact necessitated such a revision of the Constitution. The protocol concerned civil and political rights aimed at abolishing the death penalty.)

On 19 February 2007, the [[Congress of the French Parliament]] (the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] and the [[Senate (France)|Senate]], reunited for the day) voted overwhelmingly a modification of the Constitution that states that "no one can be sentenced to death." There were 828 votes for the modification, and 26 against. The amendment entered the Constitution on 23 February.

==Variations in French opinion==
During the 20th century, French opinion on the death penalty has greatly changed, as many polls have showed large differences from one time to another.

* In 1908, [[Le Petit Parisien]] published a poll in which 77% of people asked were in favor of the death penalty.
* In 1960, a survey from the [[Institut français d'opinion publique|IFOP]] showed that 50% of the French were against, while 39% were for.
* In 1972, in a survey from the same institute, 27% of those surveyed were for abolition while 63% were for capital punishment.
* In 1981, [[Le Figaro]] carried out a survey the day after the vote for abolition. It indicated that 62% of the French were for maintaining the death penalty.
* In 1998, [[IFOP]]'s and [[France Soir]]'s survey showed that opinions were split in half, with 54% against the death penalty and 44% for it.&lt;ref name="ifop1998"&gt;{{cite web

[[Construction]] work is a hazardous land-based job. Some construction site jobs include:  building houses, roads, tree forts, workplaces and repair and maintain infrastructures. This work includes many hazardous task and conditions such as working with height, excavation, noise, dust, power tools and equipment. The most common fatalities are caused by the fatal four: falls, being struck by an object, electrocutions, and being caught in between two objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OSHA Data &amp; Statistics / Commonly Used Statistics|url=https://www.osha.gov/oshstats/commonstats.html|website=osha.gov|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/construction/|title=CDC - Construction Safety and Health - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Construction work has been increasing in developing and undeveloped countries over the past few years. With an increase in this type of work occupational fatalities have increased. [[Occupational fatality|Occupational]] fatalities are individuals who die while on the job or performing work related tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Das|first=Siddhartha|date=6 June 2015|title=Occupational fatalities in the construction sector: A medico-legal viewpoint|url=|journal=Medicolegal Journal|doi=10.1177/0025817214554869|pmid=|volume=83|pages=93–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the field of construction it is important to have safe construction sites.

In deciding the risk precautions, the employer has to provide different degrees of protection. Where one task happens to be more dangerous than another, a greater degree of care has to be taken, but where the employer cannot eliminate the dangerous task, reasonable precautions are needed to reduce the risk according to Nguyen Van Vinh v Cheung Ying Construction Engineering Ltd (2008). This does not, however, imply that an employer is required to remove every risk. The Lord Oaksey commented in Winter v Cardiff Rural District Council (1950) stated that “but this does not mean that an employer must decide on every detail of the system of work or mode of operation. There is a sphere in which the employer must exercise his discretion and there are other spheres in which foremen and workmen must exercise theirs....With regard to the decision how safety precaution has to be taken frequently, it should be left to the foreman or workmen on the site. Whilst the immediate employer of the employee is liable for safety, Morris v. Breaveglen (1993) ruled that the principal contractor cannot escape from his liability. The general employers argued that they should not be liable for the injuries as they were not exercising direct control over the workers. However, judges invalidated such contention in Rainfield Design &amp; Associates Ltd v Siu Chi Moon (2000), “[t]he purpose of the Regulations was clearly to provide for the safety of workman and the primary responsibility for this must rest with the contractor responsible for the site. Even where a subcontractor had a contractual duty to provide plant and equipment, the contractor responsible for the site would not be relieved from its duty under the Regulations.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rita Yi Man|first=Li|last2=Poon|first2=Sun Wah|title=Workers' compensation for non-fatal accidents: review of HongKong court cases|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304195662_Workers%27_compensation_for_non-fatal_construction_accidents_Review_of_Hong_Kong_court_cases|journal=Asian Social Science|volume=5|issue=11|pages=15-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three generations of construction safety informatics==
Li (2019) proposes that there are three generations of construction safety informatics which are relevant to construction safety enhancement:

1. The first generation of construction safety informatics consisted of technologies that relied completely on control by human beings; for example, structural equation modelling requires the work of an analyst.

2. The second generation of construction safety informatics included smart features such as the Internet of Things which can send information to human operators, without human intervention — from sensors, etc. Yet, these “smart” tools cannot learn and improve on their own capabilities.

3. The third generation of construction safety informatics uses state-of-the-art AI, to mimic human behavior and think, act, learn and improve on its own decision making. All that is required is that the relevant information is fed to these systems, so that they can be ‘taught’ &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rita Yi Man|first=Li|title=Construction safety informatics, 2019, Springer, Singapore|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9789811357602#aboutBook|pages=1-142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction fatality rates ==
In 2014, the [[United States]] had 4,679 fatal occupational injuries, an [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence rate]] of 3.3 per 100,000 full-time employed workers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cfoi.nr0.htm|title=Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries Summary, 2014|website=www.bls.gov|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, fatal work injuries in construction and extraction occupations increased 5%.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  One in five deaths of workers in 2014 were construction related.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;   Construction has about 6% of U.S. workers, but 17% of the fatalities - the largest number of fatalities reported for any industry sector. In the [[United Kingdom]], the construction industry is responsible for 31% of fatalities at work and 10% of major workplace injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/industry/construction/index.htm|title=HSE - Construction Industry Statistics|last=|first=|date=|website=Health and Safety Executive|publisher=|accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[South Africa]] there are 150 fatalities and approximately 400 injuries each year related to construction sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.protectin.co.za/about-safety/33-deaths-and-accidents-in-the-construction-industry-they-can-be-prevented.html|title=Deaths and accidents in the construction industry can be reduced|last=robbie|website=www.protectin.co.za|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Brazil]], the incidence rate for all occupational fatalities is 3.6 per 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendeloff|first=John|date=2015|title=Occupational Safety and Health in Brazil|url=|journal=RAND Labor &amp; Population|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Little to no information regarding construction fatalities could be found in Asia, South American, Africa, and the Antarctic.)

==Nature of hazards==

===Hazards to construction workers===
[[File:Workplace Safety Signs.jpg|thumbnail|right|Various workplace safety signs commonly used at construction sites and industrial work environments]]
The leading safety hazards on construction sites include falls, being caught between objects, electrocutions, and being struck by objects.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cfoi.nr0.htm|title=Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries Summary, 2014|website=www.bls.gov|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These hazards have caused [https://www.mccannwallinjurylaw.com/delaware/construction-site-accidents/ injuries] and deaths on construction sites throughout the world. Failures in hazard identification are often due to limited or improper training and supervision of workers.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kines|first=Pete|last2=Andersen|first2=Lars P. S.|last3=Spangenberg|first3=Soren|last4=Mikkelsen|first4=Kim L.|last5=Dyreborg|first5=Johnny|last6=Zohar|first6=Dov|date=2010-10-01|title=Improving construction site safety through leader-based verbal safety communication|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437510000769|journal=Journal of Safety Research|volume=41|issue=5|pages=399–406|doi=10.1016/j.jsr.2010.06.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas where there is limited training include tasks in design for safety, safety inspection, and monitoring safety.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Failure in any of these areas can result in an increased risk in exposing workers to harm in the construction environment.

Falls are the leading cause of injury in the construction industry, in particularly for elder and untrained construction workers.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dong|first=Xiuwen Sue|last2=Wang|first2=Xuanwen|last3=Daw|first3=Christina|date=2012-06-01|title=Fatal falls among older construction workers|journal=Human Factors|volume=54|issue=3|pages=303–315|issn=0018-7208|pmid=22768635|doi=10.1177/0018720811410057}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) Handbook (29 CFR) used by the United States, fall protection is needed in areas including but not limited to ramps, runways, and other walkways; excavations; hoist areas; holes; form-work; leading edge work; unprotected sides and edges; overhand bricklaying and related work; roofing; precast erection; wall openings; floor openings such as holes; residential construction; and other walking/working surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owasrch.search_form?p_doc_type=STANDARDS&amp;p_toc_level=1&amp;p_keyvalue=Construction|title=Regulations (Standards - 29 CFR)|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other countries have regulations and guidelines for fall protections to prevent injuries and deaths.

Motor vehicle crashes are another major safety hazard on construction sites. It is important to be cautious while operating motor vehicles or equipment on the site. A motor vehicle should have a service brake system, emergency brake system, and a parking brake system. All vehicles must be equipped with an audible warning system if the operator chooses to use it. Vehicles must have windows and doors, power windshield wipers, and a clear view of site from the rear window.  All employees should be properly trained before using motor vehicles and equipment.

Employees on construction sites also need to be aware of dangers on the ground. Cables running across roadways were often seen until cable ramp equipment was invented to protect hoses and other equipment which had to be laid out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/dte/library/electrical/electrical.pdf|title=Electrical|publisher=OSHA|work=OSHA.Gov|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common hazard that workers may face is overexposure to heat and humidity in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://slatergrant.com/wesley-chapel-construction-site-injuries-lawyer/|title=Wesley Chapel Construction Site Injury Lawyer {{!}} Common Construction Site Injuries|last=|first=|date=|website=Slater {{!}} Grant|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overexertion in this type of weather can lead to serious heat-related illnesses such as [[heat stroke]], [[heat exhaustion]], and [[heat cramps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/heatstress/heat_illnesses.html|title=Safety and Health Topics {{!}} Occupational Heat Exposure - Heat-related Illnesses and First Aid {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other hazards found on construction site include [[asbestos]], [[solvents]], [[Noise (environmental)|noise]], and manual handling activities.&lt;ref name="NIOSHblog2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2013/05/13/womens-health-at-work/|title=Women’s Health at Work|last2=Tisdale-Pardi|first2=Julie|date=13 May 2013|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|last3=MacDonald|first3=Leslie|last4=Tiesman|first4=Hope M.|accessdate=21 January 2015|first1=Naomi|last1=Swanson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Image:Temporary Fencing.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Temporary fencing on a building site in Sydney, Australia]]

=== Education and safety  ===
Construction workers need to be properly trained and educated on the task or job before working, which will assist in preventing injuries and deaths. There are many methods of training construction workers. One method is coaching construction site foremen to include safety in their daily verbal exchanges with workers to reduce work-related accidents.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; It is important that the workers use the same language to assure the best communication. In recent years, apart from traditional face to face safety knowledge sharing, mobile apps also make knowledge sharing possible. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-12430-8|title=Rita Yi Man Li, Construction Safety and Waste Management, Springer 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method is ensuring that all workers know how to properly use electronics, conveyors, [[Skid-steer loader|skid-steer]], trucks, [[aerial lift]]s, and other equipment on the construction site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.constructionequipment.com/osha-hazard-alert-scissor-lift-safety|title=OSHA Hazard Alert: Scissor Lift Safety Construction Equipment|website=www.constructionequipment.com|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equipment on the job site must be properly maintained and inspected regularly before and after each shift.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/hsprograms/house.html|title=Workplace Housekeeping - Basic Guide : OSH Answers|last=Safety|first=Government of Canada, Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and|website=www.ccohs.ca|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equipment inspection system will help the operator make sure that a machine is mechanically sound and in safe operating conditions. An employee should be assigned to inspect equipment to insure proper safety. Equipment should have lights and reflectors if intended for night use.  The glass in the cab of the equipment must be safety glass in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10767|title=Equipment. - 1926.600|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zkH2BwAAQBAJ|title=Construction Inspection Handbook: Quality Assurance/Quality Control|last=O'Brien|first=James J.|date=2013-04-17|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781475711912|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equipment must be used for its intended task at all times on the job site to insure workers' safety.

Each construction site should have a construction site manager. This is an occupational health and safety specialist who designs and implements safety regulations to minimize injuries and accidents.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.constructioneducation.com/|title=ConstructionEducation.com|website=www.constructioneducation.com|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He or she also is in charge of conducting daily safety audits and inspections to ensure compliance with government regulations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Most construction site managers have an entry level experience or higher degree.

Before any excavation takes place, the contractor is responsible for notifying all applicable companies that excavation work is being performed. During excavation, the contractor is responsible for providing a safe work environment for employees and pedestrians. 

Access and egress are also important parts of excavation safety.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/construction/trenching/competent_person.html|title=Trenching and Excavation Guide for Daily Inspection of Trenches and Excavations - Competent Person|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramps used by equipment must be designed by a person qualified in structural design.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; No person is allowed to cross underneath or stand underneath any loading or digging equipment. Employees are to remain at a safe distance from all equipment while it is operational. Employees who have training and education in the above areas will benefit their co-workers and themselves on the construction site.

===Road construction safety===
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 created over 12,600 road construction projects, over 10,000 of which are currently in progress.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, Jennifer E., and David E. Fosbroke, [http://www.workzonesafety.org/files/documents/news_events/wz_conference_2010/injury_hazard_Fosbroke_Lincoln.pdf "Injury Hazards in Road and Bridge Construction"], International Bridge Conference Pittsburgh, PA, June 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Workers in highway work zones are exposed to a variety of hazards and face risk of injury and death from construction equipment as well as passing motor vehicles. Workers on foot are exposed to passing traffic, often at high speeds, while workers who operate construction vehicles are at risk of injury due to overturn, collision, or being caught in running equipment. Regardless of the task assigned, [[construction worker]]s work in conditions in poor lighting, poor visibility, inclement weather, congested work areas, high volume traffic and speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2001-128/|title=CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - Building Safer Highway Work Zones: Measures to Prevent Worker Injuries From Vehicles and Equipment (2001-128)|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, there were a total of 119 fatal occupation fatalities in road construction sites.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  In 2010 there were 37,476 injuries in work zones; about 20,000 of those were to construction workers.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.workzonesafety.org/crash_data/occupational_injuries |title=Occupational Injuries in Work Zones {{!}} WorkZoneSafety.org |date=2015-09-07 |access-date=2016-11-21 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907211437/https://www.workzonesafety.org/crash_data/occupational_injuries |archivedate=2015-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Causes of road work site injuries included being struck by objects, trucks or mobile equipment (35%), falls or slips (20%), overexertion (15%), transportation incidents (12%), and exposure to harmful substances or environments (5%). Causes of fatalities included getting hit by trucks (58%), mobile machinery (22%), and automobiles (13%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/wz/resources/facts_stats/injuries_fatalities.htm|title=Work Zone Facts and Statistics|last=[[Federal Highway Administration|FHWA]]|website=www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Media safety campaigns ====
Road construction safety remains a priority among workers.  Several states have implemented campaigns addressing construction zone dangers and encouraging motorists to use caution when driving through work zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=April 2017}}http://tuvizo.com/reflective-vests-for-motorists-effective/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deldot.gov/information/media_gallery/2008/workzone_safety/ |title=Delaware Department of Transportation - Media Gallery |date=2014-07-11 |access-date=2016-11-21 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711183705/http://www.deldot.gov/information/media_gallery/2008/workzone_safety/ |archivedate=2014-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

National Work Zone Safety Awareness Week is held yearly.  The national event began in 1999 and has gained popularity and media attention each year since.  The purpose of the event is to draw national attention to motorist and worker safety issues in work zones.

== Preventing accidents and improving safety ==
[[File:A construction framer talks about protecting his crew from falls.webm|thumb|A video describing how a construction framer implemented a safety program to prevent falls on construction sites]]
Site preparation aids in preventing injury and death on construction sites. Site preparation includes removing debris, leveling the ground, filling holes, cutting tree roots, and marking gas, water, and electric pipelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://civilengineersforum.com/construction-site-preparation-work/|title=Site Preparation Work - How To Prepare a Site For Construction|website=Civil Engineers Forum|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another prevention method on the construction site is to provide a scaffold that is rigid and sufficient to carry its own weight plus four times the maximum intended load without settling or displacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3252/3252.html|title=Worker Safety Series - Construction|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ways to prevent injuries and improve safety include:'''
* Management safety
* Integrate safety as a part of the job
* Create accountability at all levels
* Take safety into account during the project planning process
* Make sure the contractors are pre-qualified for safety
* Make sure the workers are properly trained in appropriate areas
* Have a fall protection system
* Prevent and address substance abuse to employees
* Make safety a part of everyday conversation
* Review accidents and near misses, as well as regular inspections&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safetyproresources.com/blog/11-steps-to-improving-safety-culture-in-the-construction-industry|title=11 Steps to Improving Safety Culture in the Construction Industry|last=Roux|first=Lance|website=www.safetyproresources.com|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Innovative safety training, e.g. adoption of virtual reality in training&lt;ref name="springer.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789811057700#aboutBook|title=An Economics analysis on automated construction safety: Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence and 3D Printing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Replace some of the works by robots (many workers may worry that this will decrease their employment rate)&lt;ref name="springer.com"/&gt;
* Adoption of BIM with three dimensional printing to make the building model first before put into real practice&lt;ref name="springer.com"/&gt;

The employees or employers are responsible for providing fall protection systems and to ensure the use of systems. [[Fall protection]] can be provided by guardrail systems, safety net systems, personal fall arrest systems, positioning device systems, and warning line systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/electric_power/ppe_fallprotectionequipment.html|title=Electric Power eTool: Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) - Fall Protection Equipment|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making sure that [[ladder]]s are long enough to safely reach the work area to prevent injury. Stairway, treads, and walkways must be free of dangerous objects, debris and materials. A  registered professional [[engineer]] should design a protective system for [[trench]]es 20 feet deep or greater for safety reasons. To prevent injury with [[Crane (machine)|crane]]s, they should be inspected for any damage. The operator should know the maximum weight of the load that the crane is to lift. All operators should be trained and certified to ensure that they operate forklifts safely.

'''Operational Excellence Model to improve safety for construction organizations'''

There are 13 safety drivers associated with this model to improve safety for construction organizations:

# Recognition &amp; Reward
# Employee Engagement
# Subcontractor Management
# Training &amp; Competence
# Risk Awareness, Management &amp; Tolerance
# Learning Organization
# Human Performance
# Transformational Leadership
# Shared Values, Beliefs, and Assumptions
# Strategic Safety Communication
# Just &amp; Fair Practices and Procedures
# Worksite Organization
# Owner's Role&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Huang|first1=Liu|title=DEVELOPMENT OF AN OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE MODEL TO IMPROVE SAFETY FOR CONSTRUCTION ORGANIZATIONS|url=https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/52660/items/1.0076355|publisher=The Canadian Society for Civil Engineering’s 5th International/11th Construction Specialty Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each safety driver mentioned above has some sub-elements attributed to it.

=== Personal protective equipment ===

[[Hard hat]]s, [[steel-toe boot]]s and [[reflective safety vests]] are perhaps the most common personal protective equipment worn by construction workers around the world. A [[risk assessment]] may deem that other protective equipment is appropriate, such as [[glove]]s, [[goggles]], or [[high-visibility clothing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=EU Law for the Construction Industry|last=Dalby|first=Joseph|date=1998-02-01|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=0-632-04067-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hazards to non-workers===
Many construction sites cannot completely exclude non-workers. Road construction sites must often allow traffic to pass through. This places non-workers at some degree of risk.

[[Image:Sign Road Work Ahead.jpg|right|thumb|This sign and advisory plate penetrated the wind-shield and roof of a car in a side-impact test crash. A safer sign would have stiffer uprights, no advisory plate and the flashing light would be moved to the point of the sign to spread the impact force.]]

Road construction sites are blocked off and traffic is redirected. The sites and vehicles are protected by signs and barricades. However, sometimes even these signs and barricades can be a hazard to vehicle traffic. For example, improperly designed barricades can cause cars that strike them to roll over or even be thrown into the air. Even a simple safety sign can penetrate the windshield or roof of a car if it strikes from certain angles.

The majority of deaths in construction are caused by hazards relating to construction activity. However, many deaths are also caused by non construction activities, such as electrical hazards. A notable example of this occurred when Andy Roberts, a father of four, was killed in 1988 in New York while changing a light bulb at a construction site when he came into contact with a loose bare wire that was carrying two thousand volts of electricity and died.. Events like this have motivated the passing of further safety laws relating to non construction activities such as electrical work laws.

==Applicable laws==
Under [[European Union Law]], there are [[European Union Directive]]s in place to protect workers, notably Directive 89/391 (the Framework Directive) and Directive 92/57 (the Temporary and Mobile Sites Directive). This legislation is transposed into the Member States and places requirements on employers (and others) to assess and protect workers health and safety.

===Europe===
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) is responsible for standards enforcement, while in [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland]] (HSENI) is responsible. In [[Ireland]], the [[Health and Safety Authority]] (HSA) is responsible for standards and enforcement.

In Europe, the [[European Agency for Safety and Health at Work]] coordinates actions at the EU and national levels and the [[Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion]] is responsible for regulation at the EU level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Actions to improve safety and health in construction|url=https://osha.europa.eu/en/tools-and-publications/publications/magazine/7|work=European Agency for Safety and Health at Work|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the [[United States]], the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) sets and enforces standards concerning workplace safety and health. Efforts have been made in the first decade of the 21st century to improve safety for both road workers and drivers in construction zone. In 2004, Title 23 Part 630 Subpart J of the Code of Federal Regulations was updated by Congress to include new regulations that direct state agencies to systematically create and adopt comprehensive plans to address safety in road construction zones that receive federal funding.&lt;ref name="gpo.gov3"&gt;[[Federal Highway Administration]] [[United States Department of Transportation|DOT]], [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2004-09-09/pdf/04-20340.pdf "Work Zone Safety and Mobility &gt; Final rule"], ''[[Federal Register]] Vol.  69,  No.  174'',  September 9, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

OSHA implemented the Final Rule to Improve Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses, which went into effect January 1, 2017. It requires employers to submit incident data electronically to OSHA. This data will enable OSHA to use enforcement and compliance assistance resources more efficiently. The amount of data required varies by company and industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/recordkeeping/finalrule/|title=Final Rule Issued to Improve Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
DATRI was co-founded by Raghu Rajagopal, Dr. Nezih Cereb, and Dr. Soo Young Yangin 2009.&lt;ref name="thehindu"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ranjani|first1=Rajendra|title=Blood stem cell donor registry DATRI on their journey|url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/blood-stem-cell-donor-registry-datri/article7485582.ece|accessdate=|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hindustantimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mid"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lawate|first1=Kartiki Nitin|title=Sunshine Story: Cured Leukaemia Patient Meets His Stem Cell Donor|url=https://www.mid-day.com/articles/sunshine-story-cured-leukaemia-patient-meets-his-stem-cell-donor/15854179|accessdate=|work=[[mid-day]]|date=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NGO works with a mission to save the lives of those people who are suffering from the [[blood cancer]], [[Aplastic Anemia]], [[Thalassemia]] and other severe blood disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jyoti|first1=Archana|title=Plan to set up central database of marrow donors|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2018/india/plan-to-set-up-central-database-of-marrow-donors.html|accessdate=|work=[[The Pioneer (newspaper)|The Pioneer]]|date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passed out of [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani]], in Engineering Technology, Raghu was a [[software developer]] and consultant in the [[US]]. He was involved in three commercial ventures, a product company, an e-business services company, and a [[Business process outsourcing|BPO]]. He worked with several [[NGOs]] and volunteered in various donors’ drives for the collection of blood [[stem cells]] throughout his 12 years of stay in the [[US]]. Raghu returned to [[India]] with a dream of starting the [[NGO]] for the same purpose. He was set to deal with the challenges faced by patients of life-threatening diseases like [[leukemia]] due to lack of [[stem cells]] in the blood and wanted to encourage healthy Indians for donating the stem cells and create an exhaustive [[Donor registration|Donors Registry]]. Raghu, who returned to [[India]] in 2005, knew that for such a large country there had to be a functional registry. It took a while for the idea of forming a registry in [[India]] to crystallize, mainly because of the costs involved in doing [[Human Leukocyte Antigen]] (HLA) typing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=HLA match likelihoods for Indian patients seeking unrelated donor transplantation grafts: a population-based study|url=https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lanhae/PIIS2352-3026(14)70021-3.pdf|accessdate=|work=[[The Lancet]]|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He teamed up with Dr. Soo Young Yang and Dr. Nezih Cereb, founders of Histogenetics, a laboratory that specialized in HLA typing, for starting a blood [[stem cell]] registry.&lt;ref name="thehindu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yadav|first1=Umesh|title=Stem cell registry startup in Bengaluru connects donor, receiver|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/stem-cell-registry-startup-in-bengaluru-connects-donor-receiver/articleshow/47638336.cms|accessdate=|work=[[The Economic Times]]|date=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nataline Mary Sarkisyan''' ; July 10, 1990 – December 20, 2007) was an American teenager with recurrent [[leukemia]].  Her case became part of the [[health care reform debate in the United States]] in 2007 when [[Cigna HealthCare]] denied coverage for a [[liver transplant]] operation.  The company later reversed its decision after a great deal of media attention to her story, but Sarkisyan died hours later.&lt;ref name="book1"&gt;Flower, Joe. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rtzq6syWSm0C&amp;pg=PA193#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Healthcare Beyond Reform: Doing It Right for Half the Cost], p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2011-nyt-1"&gt;Chen, Pauline W. (6 January 2011). [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/health/views/06chen.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 When Insurers Put Profits Between Doctor and Patient], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Sarkisyan was diagnosed with leukemia at age 14. She was covered under her father's health insurance, through his employer, Mercedez-Benz. The employer plan was administered by Cigna HealthCare.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mercurynews.com/2007/12/28/hundreds-attend-funeral-for-southern-california-teen-who-died-during-transplant-delay/ Hundreds attend funeral for Southern California teen who died during transplant delay], By Associated Press and Noaki Schwartz, Mercury News, December 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; During her treatment for leukemia, her liver deteriorated. 

Sarkisyan's doctors at the UCLA Medical Center told the family and Cigna that they recommended a [[liver transplant]], and patients in similar circumstances have a six-month survival rate of 65%. Different doctors gave different estimates of the likelihood of success. Dr. John Roberts, chief of the transplant service at [[UC San Francisco]] (not the transplant center treating Sarkisyan), said{{When|date=July 2009}} that his center generally does not accept a patient without a 50% or greater five year survival rate. Dr. Goran Klintmalm, chief of the Baylor Regional Transplant Institute in [[Dallas]],  said {{When|date=July 2009}} this particular operation was a "very high-risk transplant," but that he would consider the same operation on a similar patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-transplant22dec22,1,3777077.story?coll=la-headlines-business&amp;track=crosspromo |title=Tough calls in transplant case - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Latimes.com |date=2007-12-22 |accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 11, 2007, Cigna rejected the request for coverage for the liver transplant. Sarkisyan's doctors at UCLA, including the head of its transplant unit, wrote a letter to protest that the treatment proposed was neither experimental nor unproven and called on Cigna to urgently review its decision.

Cigna HealthCare refused to pay for treatment by citing policy provisions which do not cover services considered experimental, investigational and/or unproven to be safe and/or effective for the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cigna.com/customer_care/healthcare_professional/coverage_positions/medical/mm_0355_coveragepositioncriteria_liver_transplant_cadaveric_donor.pdf|title=CIGNA document|publisher=Cigna.com|accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cigna said that it had no financial stake in the decision because it only administered the insurance plan and would not bear the cost of any operation.   The cost of a liver transplant and one year of follow-up care was $450,000 in 2005. UCLA declined two livers while waiting for insurance approval from Cigna.  Ms. Sarkisyan's family was also informed that they could proceed with the transplant if they could make a down-payment of $75,000.

Among the groups who publicly spoke out against Cigna's decision was the [[California Nurses Association/National Nurses Organizing Committee]].&lt;ref name="nurse1"&gt;Prosono, Marvin. [https://books.google.com/books?id=L5BHiqeA-dMC&amp;pg=PA273#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 'Bystander Sociology' and the Sonderbehandlung of the Social] in ''The Shape of Sociology for the 21st Century: Tradition and Renewal'', at  p. 273 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

After public media attention grew, Cigna reversed its decision, but offered to pay for the transplant itself when it made the exception to the policy.&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Fuhrmans &amp; Laura Meckler; [https://web.archive.org/web/20080108022106/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119967240787671395.html "A Medical Case Becomes Political"]; ''The Wall Street Journal'' 2008-01-07, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; Cigna's reversal of its policy, offering to pay for the transplant, came just hours before Sarkisyan's death.&lt;ref name="guard1"&gt;Pilkington, Ed (21 December 2007). [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/22/usa.international Insurer's U-turn too late to save life of transplant teenager], ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

Sarkisyan's family spoke out at a [[New Hampshire]] rally in support of Senator John Edwards' presidential campaign on January 6, 2008 based on his advocacy of reforming and overhauling the US health care system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TomP |url=http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/1/6/103755/8442 |title=Update IV (Video of Sarkisyans at Rally): Family of Nataline Sarkisyan To Join Edwards Today |publisher=Daily Kos |date=2008-01-06 |accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendell Potter [http://wendellpotter.com/deadlyspin/ Deadly Spin: An insurance company insider speaks out how corporate PR is killing health care and deceiving Americans], Bloomsbury Press, November, 2010, chapters 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phill1"&gt;Burling, Stracey (13 January 2008).

==Lawsuit==

The Philippine '''Department of Health''' (abbreviated as '''DOH'''; {{lang-fil|Kagawaran ng Kalusugan}}) is the [[Executive Departments of the Philippines|executive department]] of the [[Politics of the Philippines|Philippine government]] responsible for ensuring access to basic [[public health]] services by all Filipinos through the provision of quality [[health care]] and the regulation of all health services and products. It is the government's over-all technical authority on health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DOH Profile|url=http://www.doh.gov.ph/node/97.html|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has its headquarters at the San Lazaro Compound, along [[Rizal Avenue]] in [[Manila]].

The department is led by the [[Secretary of Health (Philippines)|Secretary of Health]], nominated by the [[President of the Philippines]] and confirmed by the [[Commission on Appointments (Philippines)|Commission on Appointments]]. The Secretary is a member of the [[Cabinet of the Philippines|Cabinet]]. The current Secretary of Health is [[Francisco Duque]].

==History==
Americans assembled a military Board of Health on September 10, 1898, with its formal organization on September 29. Upon its creation, Dr. [[Frank S. Bourns]] is assigned as president while Dr. C. L. Mullins is assigned as assistant surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seventh Annual Report of the Philippine Commission Part 2|date=1907|publisher=Government Printing Office|location=Washington|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this Board of Health was to care for injured American troops but as the hostilities between Filipinos and Americans waned in 1901, a civilian Board of Health was now deemed appropriate with Dr. [[L. M. Maus]] as the first health commissioner.

In the early 1900s, 200,222 lives including 66,000 children were lost; three percent of the population was decimated in the worst epidemic in Philippine health history. In view of this, the Americans organized and erected several institutions, including the Bureau of Governmental Laboratories, which was built in 1901 for medical research and vaccine production.

The Americans, led by [[Dean Worcester]] built the [[University of the Philippines College of Medicine|UP College of Medicine and Surgery]] in 1905, with [[Johns Hopkins University]] serving as a blueprint, at the time, one of the best medical schools in the world. By 1909, nursing instruction was also begun at the [[Philippine Normal University|Philippine Normal School]]. In terms of public health, the Americans improved on the sewer system and provided a safer water supply.

In 1915, the Bureau of Health was reorganized and renamed into the Philippine Health Service. During the succeeding years leadership and a number of health institutions were already being given to Filipinos, in accordance with the Organic Act of 1916. On January 1, 1919, Dr. Vicente De Jesus became the first Filipino to head the Health portfolio.

In 1933, after a reorganization, the Philippine Health Service reverted to being known as the Bureau of Health. It was during this time that it pursued its official journal, ''The Health Messenger'' and established Community Health and Social Centers, precursors to today's [[Barangay Health Center]]s.

By 1936, as Governor-General Frank Murphy was assuming the post of United States [[High Commissioner]], he would remark that the Philippines led all oriental countries in terms of health status.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doh.gov.ph/sphh/1930.htm 1930's: Passing the Torch]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] was inaugurated, Dr. [[Jose Fabella]] was named chief of the Bureau of Health. In 1936, Dr. Fabella reviewed the Bureau of Health’s organization and made an inventory of its existing facilities, which consisted of 11 community and social health centers, 38 hospitals, 215 puericulture centers, 374 sanitary divisions, 1,535 dispensaries and 72 laboratories.

In the 1940s, the Bureau of Health was reorganized into the Department of Health and Public Welfare, still under Fabella. During this time, the major priorities of the agency were [[tuberculosis]], [[malnutrition]], [[malaria]], [[leprosy]], gastrointestinal disease, and the high infant [[mortality rate]].

When the Japanese occupied the Philippines, they dissolved the National Government and replaced it with the Central Administrative Organization of the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]]. Health was relegated to the Department of Education, Health and Public Welfare under Commissioner [[Claro M. Recto]].

In 1944, [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Manuel Roxas]] signed Executive Order (E.O.) No. 94 into law, calling for the creation of the Department of Health. Dr. Antonio C. Villarama as appointed Secretary. A new Bureau of Hospitals and a Bureau of Quarantine was created under DOH. Under E.O. 94, the Institute of Nutrition was created in 1948 to coordinate various nutrition activities of the different agencies.

On February 20, 1958, Executive Order 288 provided for the reorganization of the Department of Health. This entailed a partial decentralization of powers and created eight Regional Health Offices. Under this setup, the Secretary of Health passed on some of responsibilities to the regional offices and directors.

One of the priorities of the [[Ferdinand E. Marcos|Marcos]] administration was health maintenance. From 1975 to the mid-eighties, four specialty hospitals were built in succession. The first three institutions were spearheaded by [[First Lady of the Philippines|First Lady]] [[Imelda Marcos]]. The [[Philippine Heart Center]] was established on February 14, 1975 with Dr. Avelino Aventura as director. Second, the Philippine Children’s Medical Center was built in 1979. Then in 1983, the National Kidney and Transplant Institute was set up. This was soon followed by the [[Lung Center of the Philippines]], which was constructed under the guidance of Health Minister Dr. [[Enrique Garcia]].

With a shift to a parliamentary form of government, the Department of Health was transformed into the Ministry of Health on June 2, 1978 with Dr. [[Clemente S. Gatmaitan]] as the first health minister. On April 13, 1987, the Department of Health was created from the previous Ministry of Health with Dr. [[Alfredo R. A. Bengzon]] as secretary of health.

[[Disability]] rights in Israel are based among the rest upon [[Disability pension|disabillity pensions]], [[Accessibility|accessibility]] [[Regulation|regulations]], [[Therapy|therapy]], [[Special education|special education]], [[Sheltered workshop|sheltered workshop]] and [[Assisted living|assisted living]].

Since the beginning of the [[21st century]], the disabled people in [[Israel]], with a population of 250,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Zeev Klein|url=http://www.israelhayom.co.il/article/531779|title=The Ministerial Committee on Legislation approved: The disabled pension will be raised|website=[[Israel Hayom]]|language=he|date=2017-09-18|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; have managed to equalize the disability pension from the [[Bituah Leumi]] (National Insurance Institute of Israel) to the [[Minimum wage|minimum wage]] level in Israel.

In 2017, a full disability pension was 2,342 [[Israeli new shekel|ILS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Telem Yahav|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5000945,00.html|title=Disabled protest against NIS 2,342 disability benefits|website=[[Ynetnews]]|date=2017-08-09|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum wage in this year was 5,000 ILS, and in December 2017 it went up to 5,300 ILS per month.&lt;ref name=minimum&gt;{{Cite web|author=National Insurance Institute of Israel|url=https://www.btl.gov.il/English%20Homepage/Mediniyut/GeneralInformation/Pages/MinimumWage.aspx|title=General Information – Minimum Wage|website=[[Bituah Leumi]]|date=2018-05-28|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Max Schindler|url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Knesset-votes-to-raise-monthly-minimum-wage-to-NIS-5300-508263|title=Knesset votes to raise monthly minimum wage to NIS 5,300|website=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=2017-10-24|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Amiram Barkat|url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-israels-minimum-monthly-wage-to-rise-to-nis-5300-1001208922|title=The minimum wage will be raised by NIS 300 in December, and will rise 23% in three years|website=[[Globes]]|date=2017-10-24|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Telem Yahav and Gad Lior|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5035109,00.html|title=Minimum wage to rise to NIS 5,300 in December|website=[[Ynetnews]]|date=2017-10-29|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=TOI staff|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/minimum-wage-rising-to-nis-5300-on-december-1/|title=Minimum wage rising to NIS 5,300 on December 1|website=[[The Times of Israel]]|date=2017-10-30|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The General Disability Pension was linked to the national average salary in Israel, as it was determined in the National Insurance Law [combined version], 1995&lt;ref&gt;[[s:he:חוק_הביטוח_הלאומי|the National Insurance Law]] in the Hebrew Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt;, but in an amendment from 2003, it was determined in article 110 of the Law, that the pension will be linked to the Consumer Price Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pensiondevelopment.org/123/israel.htm|title=Knowledge center – Country Database – Israel|website=Pension and Development Network|quote=Benefits are adjusted annually in January according to the increase in the consumer price index in the previous year.|date=2010|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Katz&gt;{{Cite web|author=Amir Alon|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5048224,00.html|title=Plan adds NIS 1.98 billion in funding for disability pensions|website=[[Ynetnews]]|date=2017-11-26|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2000, the minimum wage was 2,797.75 ILS,&lt;ref name=minimum /&gt; and the disability pension in Israel was 2,239 ILS,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Lee Yaron|url=https://www.haaretz.co.il/news/education/.premium-1.4149311|title=The disabled organizations petitioned the High Court of Justice against the state following the postponement of the increase in allowances|website=[[Haaretz]]|quote=In 2000, the monthly disability pension stood at 2,239 ILS.|date=2017-06-06|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Tal Carmon|url=http://www.davar1.co.il/80287/|title=Disability pensions: Burden of proof|website=Davar1 ("In the first place")|language=he|quote=To the petition were attached data according to which in 2000, the monthly disability pension stood at 2,239 ILS.|date=2017-08-09|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 80 [[percent]] of the minimum wage. However, even in 2000 the disabled people demanded to equalize their pension to the minimum wage.

Most of the disabled Israelis who are entitled to a full disability pension and are permanently dependent on it for work incapacity, do not receive any other allowance. Those who receive an additional special allowance, receive it for special needs such as nursing or mobility, and it does not cover the costs to which it is intended. In addition, the designated allowances are not for basic subsistence needs.

The disability pension in Israel was one of the lowest in the [[OECD]] countries: In 2007, Israel was ranked 26th out of 31 countries. An examination conducted by OECD in 2007 also found that the disability benefit per capita in Israel was approximately 80 percent lower than the average allowance per capita in the OECD countries. In 2004, Israel raised the threshold of the sole [[Physiological functional capacity|Medical Disability]] from 40 percent to 60 percent, as the eligibility for Disability pension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Shelly Levy, Senior Research Coordinator|url=http://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/pdf/m02699.pdf|title=General Disability Pension in Israel|website=[[Knesset]]|language=he|publisher=pages 8, 4|date=2010-11-02|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 10, 2018, the [[National Insurance Institute of Israel|National Insurance Institute]] advertised an extensive research which found that the allowances in Israel were one of the lowest in the [[Western world]], and wrote: "Israel's Social Security System is characterized by a very low level of generosity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Amir Alon|url=https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5283551,00.html|title=National Insurance Institute study: Allowances in Israel – one of the lowest in the Western world|website=[[Ynet]]|language=he|date=2018-06-10|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Jacques Bendelac|url=https://www.btl.gov.il/Publications/survey/Documents/seker_296.pdf|title=The Social Protection System in Israel and in OECD Countries, 2017|website=[[National Insurance Institute of Israel|Btl]]|language=he|date=April 2018|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Legislative Initiatives ===
On December 7, 2016, the Knesset approved in a preliminary reading, by a majority of 42 to 39, a law proposal, which had been submitted by [[Member of Knesset|MK]] [[Ilan Gilon]] to equalize the basic disability pension to the minimum wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Moran Azulay|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4890730,00.html|title=Pandemonium in coalition following Knesset vote loss|website=[[Ynetnews]]|date=2016-12-09|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some months earlier, MK [[Nava Boker]] also submitted on February 28, 2016, a bill to link the disability pension to the minimum wage. The difference between her bill and Gilon's bill was that by Boker's bill, payments to the disabled from private insurances would be reduced from the disability allowance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Zvi Zerahia|url=https://www.themarker.com/news/1.2866736|title=Bill: The disability pension would be doubled to 4,650 ILS|website=[[TheMarker]]|language=he|date=2016-02-28|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boker's bill which received 82 signatures of Knesset members, was transferred to the [[Israel Democracy Institute#Legal opinions to the Ministerial Committee on Legislation|Ministerial Committee on Legislation]], but was postponed several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Moran Azulay|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4996832,00.html|title=Disabled pension increase frozen while Knesset on recess|website=[[Ynetnews]]|date=2017-07-31|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Zelekha Committee ===
Following the discussion in the Ministerial Committee on Legislation, in mid-February 2017 the [[Ministry of Finance (Israel)|Minister of Finance]] [[Moshe Kahlon]] appointed Professor [[Yaron Zelekha]], in cooperation with the "Necheh, Lo Hetzi Ben Adam" ([[Disabled, Not Half a Human Being]]) Association led by [[Alex Fridman]], to the head of a special commission to examine raising disability payments. In May 2017, Zelekha recommended an increase in the disability pension to 4,000 ILS per month in three stages, linkage of the pension to the Consumer Price Index plus one percent, raising the disregard (the amount which is allowed to earn) to the Minimum Wage level, equalizing payment of a nursing worker to the minimum wage, pension under a work disability and not only a physical disability, increasing pension of elderly disabled, and broadening the range of the mobility allowance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Lee Yaron|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-monthly-disability-benefits-should-rise-to-over-1-000-panel-says-1.5471677|title=Monthly Disability Benefits Should Rise to Over $1,000, Israeli Panel Recommends|website=[[Haaretz]]|date=2017-05-14|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Simhon Committee ===
In May 2017 the [[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] appointed Professor Avi Simhon,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://departments.agri.huji.ac.il/economics/teachers/simhon_avi/|title=Avi Simhon|website=[[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; chairman of the National Economic Council in the Prime Minister's Office, as a chairman of another committee with representatives from the Ministry of Finance, [[Ministry of Social Affairs and Social Services]], [[Ministry of Health (Israel)|Ministry of Health]] and the National Insurance Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Adrian Filot|url=https://www.calcalist.co.il/local/articles/0,7340,L-3712967,00.html|title=Netanyahu decided: A joint committee will determine the addition to the disabled pension|website=[[Calcalist]]|language=he|date=2017-05-10|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=simhon&gt;{{Cite web|author=Itay Blumenthal|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4964107,00.html|title=Disabled protest blocks major Tel Aviv intersection|website=[[Ynetnews]]|publisher=Length 1:19 minutes|date=2017-05-18|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission's recommendations were submitted after about a month. The allowance for a disabled person under this scheme would be 3,200 ILS and would be given to people with disabilities at the rate of 75% or more who were defined as poor, while the disregard of a salary would be decreased from 5,300 ILS (the minimum wage) to 4,200 ILS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Hamodia Staff|url=https://hamodia.com/2017/06/13/disabled-demonstrate-increased-benefits/|title=Disabled People Demonstrate for Increased Benefits|website=[[Hamodia]]|date=2017-06-13|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Lee Yaron|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israeli-panel-to-recommend-lower-disability-benefits-1.5484016|title=Israeli Panel to Recommend Lower Disability Benefits as Netanyahu Breaks Promise|website=[[Haaretz]]|date=2017-06-14|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 22, 2017, MK [[David Bitan]], [[Coalition government|Coalition]] chairman, convened a [[News conference]] and said that he rejected the recommendation of Simhon Committee to 3,200 ILS, and agreed with the  [[Opposition (politics)|Opposition]] to accept 4,000 ILS recommended by Zelekha Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Globes correspondent|url=http://en.globes.co.il/en/article-coalition-opposition-agree-nis-4000-disabled-allowance-1001193795|title=Coalition, opposition agree: NIS 4,000 disabled allowance|website=[[Globes]]|date=2017-06-22|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the establishment of the Simhon Committee, the disabled people reacted by repeated blockings of major roads in Israel such as the entrance to [[Ben Gurion Airport|Ben Gurion International Airport]] from [[Highway 1 (Israel)|Highway 1]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Omri Efraim|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4978939,00.html|title=Disabled protestors block airport entrance, threaten to set themselves on fire|website=[[Ynetnews]]|date=2017-06-21|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Constructive Criticism 2013|url=https://www.facebook.com/bikoretbona2013/posts/1972107729667836|title=Disabled people blocked the entrance to Ben Gurion Airport for two hours|website=[[Facebook]]|language=he|publisher=Length 7:47 minutes|date=2017-06-21|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Lee Yaron and Yaniv Kubovich|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-disabled-israelis-protest-block-road-to-airport-over-benefits-1.5487202|title=Disabled Israelis Protest Meager Increase in Benefits, Block Road to Airport|website=[[Haaretz]]|date=2017-06-21|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Highway 20 (Israel)|Ayalon Highway]], [[Highway 4 (Israel)|Highway 4]], [[Ra'anana]] Junction, the [[Highway 2 (Israel)|Coastal Road]] and the entrance to Jerusalem, near the [[Chords Bridge]].&lt;ref name=simhon /&gt;&lt;ref name=ofer&gt;{{Cite web|author=Liran Levy|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4959182,00.html|title=Road to Jerusalem opened after disabled demonstrators block access in protest of low government assistance|website=[[Ynetnews]]|date=2017-05-08|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Aharon Rabinovich, Yotam Berger and Lee Yaron|url=https://www.haaretz.co.il/news/education/.premium-1.4210789|title=After approval of the limited benefits outline: The disabled blocked the entrance to Jerusalem|website=[[Haaretz]]|language=he|date=2017-06-27|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Amir Alon and Raanan Ben Zur|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5006389,00.html|title=Disabled protests: demonstrators block coastal highway near Hadera|website=[[Ynetnews]]|date=2017-08-22|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Amir Alon and Raanan Ben Zur|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5007092,00.html|title=Highway 4 blocked from Geha Interchange towards Givat Shmuel due to disabled people's protest|website=[[Ynetnews]]|date=2017-08-24|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Omri Efraim|url=https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4986547,00.html|title=The Struggle of the Disabled: Protesters blocked Highway 4 in the Sharon area and burned tires|website=[[Ynet]]|language=he|publisher=Length 2:26 minutes|date=2017-09-07|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Amir Alon|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5020083,00.html|title=Disabled protestors block Coastal Highway|website=[[Ynetnews]]|date=2017-09-24|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The demonstrators claimed that for decades they had demonstrated in front of the Knesset, the Ministry of Finance and the roads, but the government and the public ignored their demands. Therefore they had to turn to roadblocks. Initially, the [[Israel Police]] did not take proactive enforcement action against roadblocks, but with increasing traffic disturbances, The police began to take a more severe hand, and some of the obstructions included clashes between the police and the handicapped, and several disabled people were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Amir Alon|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5002255,00.html|title=Four disabled protesters arrested after assaulting policemen|website=[[Ynetnews]]|publisher=Length 0:49 minutes, length 0:28 minutes|date=2017-08-13|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Constructive Criticism 2013|url=https://www.facebook.com/bikoretbona2013/posts/2106242439587697|title=The violent arrest of disabled people in the Ashdod area.

In September 2017, the police issued a statement saying that it would no longer allow roadblocks in demonstrations, and that it would begin to fine the demonstrators who blocked roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Yaniv Kubovich|url=https://www.haaretz.co.il/news/politics/.premium-1.4461246|title=The Police to the Disabled organizers of the Demonstrations: We will not allow more roadblocks|website=[[Haaretz]]|language=he|date=2017-09-24|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police added that it "will continue to allow freedom of expression and protest by law, but will not allow a public order to be violated and such a significant violation of the normal fabric of life of Israeli citizens".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Amir Alon|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5021678,00.html|title=Disabled demonstrators clash with police in Herzliya protest|website=[[Ynetnews]]|publisher=Length 1:46 minutes|date=2017-09-27|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A week before the submission of the conclusions of the Simhon Committee, disabled representatives appealed to the High Court following the postponement of allowances increasing.

=== Negotiation in the Histadrut ===
Toward the end of September 2017, Naomi Moravia, chairwoman of the "Israeli Human Rights Organization of People with Disabilities", which was located in the Histadrut building in Tel Aviv, asked for Nissenkorn assistance in opposition to the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Tal Carmon and Nitzan Zvi Cohen|url=http://www.davar1.co.il/87407|title=The struggle for the Disability Pensions: Working with the Disabled|website=Davar1|language=he|date=2017-09-27|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following her request, Nissenkorn convened on the night of September 29, 2017, a night meeting at the Histadrut of representatives of disabled people with him, with MK Ilan Gilon and MK David Bitan, and with Avi Simhon. After 12 hours of negotiations until the morning hours, during which Yehuda Doron, a representative of the [[Poliomyelitis|Polio]] Handicapped Association, retired from the discussion, and Dr. Amichai Tamir of the Disabled Organization remained in the discussion, but opposed the outline, it was agreed to supplement the disability pension in four stages until 2021, so that the final allowance would be 3,800 up to 4,000 ILS for the disabled and 4,050 ILS for 30 thousand individuals with above 80% disability. The sum of the disregard would be raised in two stages to 4,000 ILS in January 2018 and to 4,300 ILS in January 2019. The budgetary cost of the outline was 4.2 billion ILS, and it was agreed that the addition of 340 to 540 ILS for Disabled people, would start in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Amir Alon|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5022695,00.html|title=Agreement reached, disability pensions will be raised|website=[[Ynetnews]]|date=2017-09-29|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=TOI staff|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-protests-state-agrees-to-up-disability-benefits-to-over-nis-4000/|title=After protests, state agrees to up disability benefits to over NIS 4,000|website=[[The Times of Israel]]|date=2017-09-29|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 1, 2017, Simhon claimed that the government could only commit to an addition of 1.3 billion ILS for 2018, and would not commit itself to the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Adrian Filot|url=https://www.calcalist.co.il/local/articles/0,7340,L-3722184,00.html|title=Avi Simhon on the agreement with the disabled: There is no possibility of committing to the rest of the additions for the years to come|website=[[Calcalist]]|language=he|date=2017-10-01|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simhon explained that a computer program (a software agent) which was called Numerator,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Lahav Harkov|url=https://www.jpost.com/International/What-has-the-government-done-for-us-lately-502749|title=What has Israel's Government done for its Citizens lately?|website=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|quote=So, why aren’t a third of government decisions implemented?

== The Responses of the Disabled ==
Simhon's remarks about the inability to commit to 4.2 billion ILS, along with the expected addition in January 2018 of 340 ILS to the disabled and the four stages up to 2021, caused most disabled people to deny the outline which had been reached between the organizations "Israeli Human Rights Organization of People with Disabilities" and "Necheh Lo Hetzi Ben Adam" and the Government, with the assistance of Nissenkorn.

The organizations "The Disabled Panthers" led by Eyal Cohen, "The [[A-team]] Disabled" under the leadership of Ofer Sofer, the organization of the disabled, led by Tamir, and the Polio organization led by Doron, announced that they would continue to block roads until the disability pension would be equal to the minimum wage and would be paid with one stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Sarah Levi|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/The-fight-Minimum-wages-on-The-battle-may-be-won-but-the-war-continues-506422|title=The fight for Minimum Wage: The battle may be won but the war continues|website=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=2017-10-01|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=helman&gt;{{Cite web|author=Amir Alon|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5023107,00.html|title=Disabled Panthers block road over benefits agreement|website=[[Ynetnews]]|date=2017-10-01|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oren Helman, a Vice President of the [[Israel Electric Corporation]], a father of a daughter with a disability, and a former advisor to Netanyahu for a year when Netanyahu was the [[Finance Minister]], also published an article in the newspaper [[Globes]] after advertising the Histadrut outline, and demanded to increase the amount of the disregard to 15,000 ILS.&lt;ref name=helman /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Oren Helman|url=https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001206683|title=We missed the Integration of People with a Disability at Work|website=[[Globes]]|language=he|date=2017-09-29|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 3, 2017, the members of "The Disabled Panthers" and "The A-team" blocked two entrances to the [[Port of Ashdod]] from six in the morning for five hours, causing heavy financial damage.

The "Israeli Human Rights Organization of People with Disabilities" responded to Katz's bill, and rejected the non-linkage to the Average Wage in Israel, the lowering of the total amount from 4.2 billion ILS to less than 2 billion ILS, the absence of further increase of the Disregard in 2019, and the absence of further increase of the disability pension.&lt;ref name=Katz /&gt; On November 26, 2017, a memorandum of law was published,[64] which was the formal beginning of a legislative initiative initiated by the government for several changes in the disability pension following the agreement between the disability organizations and the government. On the same day, the disabled people demonstrated against Katz's bill, and blocked the light rail in Jerusalem for an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Amir Alon|url=https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5048252,00.html|title=The Disabled oppose the new bill: We shall protest in a way which has not yet been looked alike|website=[[Ynet]]|language=he|publisher=Length 0:31 minutes|date=2017-11-27|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Constructive Criticism 2013|url=https://www.facebook.com/bikoretbona2013/videos/2036978066514135|title=Blocking the Light Rail for about an hour: Tough traffic disruptions on Sunday 2018-11-26. the Disabled people demand Disability Pension at the Minimum Wage level now|website=[[Facebook]]|language=he|publisher=Length 4:55 minutes|quote=Ofer Sofer: We demand the Minimum Wage and shall not give up.

At this meeting, MK [[Moti Yogev]] of [[The Jewish Home|the Jewish Home]] said that it was absolutely necessary that the Disability Pension would not be affected due to going out of Disabled people to work, alongside the obligation to shorten the stages. MK [[Abd al-Hakim Hajj Yahya]] of the [[Joint List]] said that disability pensions are a commitment of the state towards its citizens, and the budget of 4.2 billion ILS is not something sacred. He said that the MKs had to check with the [[Treasury]] if there was over [[Government revenue|revenue]]. By Hajj Yahya, if there was money, the stages' number should be reduced. Eyal Cohen from "the Disabled Panthers" said that he had paid to the National Insurance every month without any stages, and his doctor told him a year ago, that he would have four years to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=The Knesset|url=http://fs.knesset.gov.il//20/Committees/20_ptv_395621.doc|title=Protocol No. 650 From the meeting of the Labor, Welfare and Health Committee|website=[[Knesset]]|language=he|date=2017-12-11|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2018, Katz said in the government meeting that the agreement to transfer the National Insurance surplus to the Treasury is canceled. According to article 7 of the agreement, each party may notify the other party in writing, no later than three months prior to the end of a particular financial year, that from the subsequent fiscal year, it is no longer interested in investments under this agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.co.il/embeds/pdf_upload/2018/20180912-203431.pdf|title=The agreement on October 19, 1980, between the Government of Israel and the National Insurance Institute|website=[[Haaretz]]|language=he|publisher=The surpluses would be invested in Israeli governmental bonds – [[Mount Ebal|Ebal]] (5.5% per year) and [[Mount Gerizim|Gerizim]] (5% per year), which would be sold to the National Insurance Institute only|date=2018-09-12|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ministry of Social Affairs and Social Services|Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs]] told the media that the situation in which the money that was supposed to guarantee the future of the allowances and of the National Insurance Institute, served the current state budget – could not continue. In a reaction, MK [[Itzik Shmuli]] said that over the years, the Finance Ministry robbed more than 220 billion ILS from the National Insurance Institute funds. Instead of keeping the money to ensure compliance with obligations, it was burned on the political needs of the governments.

On January 8, 2018, Ravit Ben Baruch, a disabled leader, addressed Simhon in her video in Facebook, and told him:

''"What did you come to tell me? That as long as you could milk me with exorbitant taxes that have no parallel in any civilized country in the world, the arrangement between us worked great. Moreover, I have never earned a minimum wage, so I paid every month very good taxes, assuming naively that it was okay to cut me like it, because it went to families who needed it, but it has not been done. What can I tell you, each one of you? At the moment you would stop being a milking cow, you would have to expect it. This state would strip you of the last dignity which you still had, and would treat you as a beggar at the doorway. From the moment in which he could not suck my blood any longer, I became a burden. A burden on the state coffers. As such, he is sorry to disappoint me, I am not entitled to a pension. I get a handout and I have to thank nicely and shut up. In the sequence of the disgusting nonsense that came out of your mouth, you were right about one thing. There is no university in the world which could teach you what human compassion is. No, sir. You are just a lost cause. And do you know what? I do not need to get excited by you either. Who are you at all?

On October 15, 2018, the Disabled Panthers demonstrated in front of the Knesset, and Amnon Ben-Ataf was pushed to the ground by a police officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Amir Alon|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5372176,00.html|title=Disabled protester pushed to the ground by police|website=[[Ynetnews]]|publisher=Length 0:31 minutes|date=2018-10-16|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 20, 2018, the Disabled Panthers blocked the rail crossing near [[Yakum]], until they were evicted by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Amir Alon, Roi Rubinstein|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5410251,00.html|title=Disabled protesters block train tracks, railway disruptions expected|website=[[Ynetnews]]|date=2018-11-20|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Constructive Criticism 2013|url=https://www.facebook.com/bikoretbona2013/posts/2304779629744205|title=The Disabled Panthers blocked the railway for hours|website=[[Facebook]]|language=he|publisher=Length 11:02 minutes|date=2017-11-21|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Eyal Cohen made a speech and said:

''"Recently a lot of people, the disabled people as well as the general public, have asked me about the blockades and the public support in the struggle of the disabled.''&lt;br&gt;
''Now I turn to you with a question which gives you something to think about. The support which we get, according to what it seems, is: "Sit at home quietly, do not disturb us, we will support you".''&lt;br&gt;
''Let us look back sixteen years. Sixteen years of a struggle, when the last one and a half years have been tougher. What sign did we see? What statement have we seen from the public which supports us? Except a like in Facebook and a siren on the road of folks who pass by. Not the drivers who are blocked. With likes on Facebook, we will not go to the grocery store and shall not buy medicines. Even with a siren of encouragement, we cannot bring food home.''&lt;br&gt;
''The question is what we look for. Do we really want to get results, or just sit quietly at home and being liked? They will like us as poor people, who beg for bread, or they would dislike us and we could go to the grocery store and live in dignity.''&lt;br&gt;
''The upcoming elections have awakened some members of the disabled organizations, who want to run for the Knesset. Their way is to step upon corpses, and they go out against the Panthers, against anyone who acts, because their main reason is the public opinion.''&lt;br&gt;
''So think now, each one with himself, what do you prefer. Being liked by the audience, but remaining in poverty, or being disliked by the audience, but being able to go to the grocery store, buy medicine and live in dignity.''&lt;br&gt;
''If most of the disabled public tells me that it prefers to be liked when it sits at home quietly and does not speak, I will accept it. I will stop the struggle, following the majority. If most of the disabled people tells me that we have to continue to fight and would not care what they think about us, because we care about the disabled and the elderly, not what the healthy people think about us, we will continue to intensify the struggle.''&lt;br&gt;
''Yesterday, on railway, it was a step up. To this day, we have not been evicted forcibly. From now and on, these images would repeat themselves time after time. It depends on you. Have a wonderful day for everyone."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Eyal Cohen|url=https://www.facebook.com/100006583338884/posts/2347067332189355|title=From now, it depends on you|website=[[Facebook]]|language=he|publisher=Length 3:05 minutes|date=2018-11-21|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar words were said in the [[television show]] ''"Talk of the day"'' with [[Lucy Aharish]] on November 21, 2018, and Aharish said her opinion against the lawmakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=The talk of the day with Lucy Aharish|url=https://www.facebook.com/2137029799861259/posts/303436190507822|title=We have to choose whether to buy medicine or pay bills|website=[[Facebook]]|language=he|publisher=Length 11:17 minutes|date=2018-11-21|access-date=2018-11-24|quote=Aharish: I am frustrated more and more because I know that I may be in your situation.

It frustrates me because it is hypocritical. It frustrates me because you have contributed all your life. All your life you gave to the National Insurance Institute. And whoever looks at you, and all the MKs and the ministers who are sitting at home, should be ashamed when they look you in your eyes. (Her voice is choked with tears).}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 26, 2018, Cohen made an additional speech, and talked about the misleading which has been made by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=The Panther Graphic Studio|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP9fuDvAZnI|title=A notice of Eyal Cohen, the leader the Disabled Panthers, to the media|website=[[YouTube]]|language=he|publisher=Length 4:11 minutes|date=2018-11-26|access-date=2018-11-27|quote=The message which the government tries to convey is that the disabled people signed and agreed to the agreement with the government. It has never happened. Only one organization welcomed the agreement, and upset the disabled people. There is no paper, signed by the disabled people. There are not signatures because there was no agreement. Over 16 years of no addition, the disabled got 1.4 billion ILS, although they advertised repeatedly that they added an amount of 4.3 billion ILS. In 2021 the disability pension would be only 3,700 ILS, in spite of the state law said that the minimum sum for living was the minimum wage which was 5,300 ILS today. Can a disabled or an elderly person live by 3.700 ILS? It is not today. It is in 2021! Today, disabled people are living by 3,200 ILS barely. Can a healthy person live with it? When you see us in our protest, please stand with us. Tomorrow, God forbid, it will be a part of you.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Emergency Hospital Service''' (EHS) of Scotland was an intensive, [[Publicly funded health care|publicly funded]] programme of hospital building conducted by the [[Department of Health for Scotland]] during the 1940s. The scale and pace of [[public investment]] in hospital construction and staffing was unprecedented in Europe. 

In a few years the EHS expanded Scottish hospital capacity by 60%, creating 20,500 additional beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gUlAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gVkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3798%2C4833965 |title=National Health Service: Emergency Scheme's Success |work=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |page=2 |date=31 July 1942 |accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, 13,000 of these EHS hospital beds and the accompanying staff, together with the older [[Highlands and Islands Medical Service]] facilities and staff, formed the basis of the [[Scottish National Health Service]], founded in 1948.

==History==
The EHS began in 1939 to cope with the expected high number of civilian casualties from German [[Strategic bombing|air raids]]. Scotland was prioritised as it was seen as the likely refuge for [[Armed resistance|resistance]] if the [[Axis powers]] had invaded England. 

Scottish civil servants had built up experience of directly running public health services since the establishment of the Highlands and Islands Medical Service in 1913, and they focussed their efforts into this new [[public works]] programme.

The expected numbers of civilian casualties never arrived at the new facilities, so [[Tom Johnston (Scottish politician)|Tom Johnston]], the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] (1941–45), decided to use the largely empty buildings to reduce long surgery waiting times, with 33,000 civilian patients treated by EHS facilities by the end of the war in 1945.

Johnston also used the new EHS facilities for a new range of publicly funded specialist health care: [[Orthopaedics|orthopaedic care]], [[plastic surgery]], [[eye injuries]], [[psychoneurosis]], [[neurosurgery]] and other specialities. The EHS also formed the basis of the national [[Pathology as a medical specialty|pathology laboratory]] service, and, in 1940 the [[Scottish National Blood Transfusion Association]] to improve existing transfusion services.

==EHS hospitals==
sites were identified to build hospitals at:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wEdAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=koUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1644%2C4743624 |title=Scottish Medical Services in Wartime:Emergency Facilities Now Permanent |work=The Glasgow Herald |page=9 |date=9 July 1953 |accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EHS construction programme came to the attention of German [[military intelligence]], but they mistook it for a military programme, so the Law and Stracathro hospitals were marked on [[Luftwaffe]] maps as barracks.

In addition to the 7 new hospitals and one clinic, the EHS constructed new annexes at existing hospitals.

Hotels were [[commandeer]]ed to provide [[Convalescent home|convalescent accommodation]]. For example, [[Gleneagles Hotel]] was adapted to care for injured mineworkers.

[[Chile]]'s [[privatization]] of water has led to many [[Environmental policy|environmental]] problems.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Since water tends to flow towards money it is being over-allocated to industries such as [[mining]] and [[agriculture]]. Of course, the [[ecosystem]] itself cannot commit any money to securing [[water rights]] and the DGA has no powers for [[legislation]], all it can do is monitor the worsening situation. This is especially true in the northern [[Atacama Region]].  In some regions of the north the Atacama regional governor has given out water permits totaling 16,000 cubic meters per second where it has been shown that replenishment rates are near 4,000 cubic meters per second.&lt;ref&gt;Derricott, T. "Water Shortage Predicted for Northern Chile". Santiago Times. 24 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  This imbalance causes [[water scarcity]], which combined with warmer temperatures and less [[rainfall]], has stressed local ecosystems immensely.  In the [[Metropolitan Region of Santiago]] there has been an increase in [[wildfire]]s and the country is hard pressed to keep up with mitigation efforts.  In 2009 there were at least 290 fires, up from 143 in 2008, burning about 1035 hectares of land.&lt;ref&gt;Homad-Hamam, G. "Chile Deals With Increased Region V Forest Fires". Santiago Times. 16 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides lowering the amount of water available, mining and other [[Industry|industrial]] activities release a large amount of [[hazardous chemical]]s and [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]] such as [[Chromium|chrome]], [[lead]], [[copper]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[nickel]] into rivers and municipal [[sewage system]]s.  These metals are known to cause [[cancer]]s and other [[Neurological disorder|neurological diseases]].  It is estimated that only between 5 and 15 percent of [[sewage]] is actually treated, while the remainder is pumped raw into streams and the ocean itself.&lt;ref&gt;"Impact Evaluation: Reducing Urban and Industrial Air Pollution in Chile". United States Agency for International Development. December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  Solid [[industrial waste]] is often sent to [[landfill]]s where it is exposed to [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[surface runoff]].  This ultimately ends up in streams, or worse, the [[groundwater]] [[aquifer]] where [[drinking water]] is obtained.&lt;ref&gt;"Impact Evaluation: Reducing Urban and Industrial Air Pollution in Chile". United States Agency for International Development. December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 an assessment determined that a one-time [[investment]] of $1.4 million by the industrial firms would generate an annual savings of $1.9 million and a 32 percent reduction in [[pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;"Impact Evaluation: Reducing Urban and Industrial Air Pollution in Chile". United States Agency for International Development. December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The assessment showed that it is possible to reduce pollution and save money, if the companies are willing or if the government takes stronger action.  It is unlikely companies will take this action their own since the Chilean government is severely lacking in [[environmental regulation]] enforcement.  That it not to say that there are no incentives for companies to [[Industrial wastewater treatment|treat industrial wastewater]], however.  The [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] water and sewage utility – a private company – imposes charges based on the concentration of industrial [[effluent]] and places limits on the maximum amount of major [[pollutant]]s.  It charges the companies a large amount if their waste levels are too high, a stronger incentive to reduce pollution.&lt;ref&gt;"Impact Evaluation: Reducing Urban and Industrial Air Pollution in Chile". United States Agency for International Development. December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  This demonstrates that companies are receptive to [[incentive]]s and [[Sanctions (law)|penalties]] if they are implemented.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  If enough [[social pressure]] is put on the government perhaps legislation can be enacted to reduce the [[Environmental degradation|environmental impact]] from major industries that have been given much leniency thus far.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2942">The '''General Social Care Council''' ('''GSCC''') was a [[non-departmental public body]] of the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] in the [[United Kingdom]] which was the regulator of [[social worker]]s and social work students in England between 2001 and 2012. It set down [[code of conduct|codes of conduct]] for social workers and social work employers and maintained a register of around 100,000 social workers and students, using a conduct model to regulate and discipline registrants.

== Creation and closure ==
The GSCC was set up in 2001 further to the [[Care Standards Act 2000]], which was enacted partly in response to criticisms in the late 1990s of [[social services]] in Britain, in particular the high-profile case of [[Murder of Victoria Climbié|Victoria Climbié]], a young girl who was abused and eventually killed by her relatives in north London despite having been known to local [[social services]]. The GSCC inherited the mantle of the [[Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work]] (CCETSW), a previous body which had responsibility solely for managing and funding Social Work education. The GSCC was given a broader remit to take a lead not only in education but in the strategic development and promotion of the whole [[social care]] sector in Britain.

After the formation of a [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|Coalition government]] in 2010, the General Social Care Council was earmarked for abolition as part of a drive to reduce the number and cost of publicly funded organisations. On 31 July 2012 it closed, and the regulation of social workers was taken over by the [[Health and Care Professions Council|Health Professions Council]], which was renamed the Health and Care Professions Council to reflect its expanded role. The GSCC's sister organisations in the other [[countries of the United Kingdom]] – the [[Scottish Social Services Council]] (SSSC), the [[Care Council for Wales]] (in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''Cyngor Gofal Cymru'') (CCW or CGC), and the [[Northern Ireland Social Care Council]] – continued to exist with their functions intact.

At the time of its closure, the Chair of the General Social Care Council was [[Rosie Varley]], and its Chief Executive was Penny Thompson.

== Name ==
The council has changed its name and is now [[Health and Care Professions Council]] (HCPC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1 = |last1 = |first2 = |last2 = |first3 = |last3 = |first4 = |last4 = |title = HPC website|url = http://www.hpc-uk.org/|date = |publisher = |website = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gigantiform cementoma''' is a rare, [[autosome|autosomal]] [[tooth|dental]] [[tumor]].  It is benign, but without intervention it can result in severe disfigurement of the jaw.  The cause of this tumor is currently unknown. This is an exceedingly rare tumor with only a handful of documented cases worldwide. The most famous case is of [[Novemthree Siahaan]] (who died on September 15, 2005), a young [[Indonesia]]n boy from [[Batam|Batam Island]] who received medical care in Haulien, Taiwan through a Buddhist missionary from the [[Tzu Chi|Tzu Chi Foundation]], which was documented on the [[Discovery Health Channel]]. Another famous case is a young [[Korea]]n girl named Ayun Lee (August 26, 2003~) and her father [[Young-hak Lee]] whose case has shown that the tumor can be heritable. She is currently under treatment, which she may need to continue until her growth stops in her early 20s. 

The term has been used in the past to describe [[cemento-osseous dysplasia|florid cemento-osseous dysplasia]], but it is now reserved for an autosomal dominant condition affecting the [[maxillae]]. It affects mostly Caucasian people under the age of 10. Treatment is difficult. Surgical removal of the affected bone is needed, and has to be followed by reconstruction.

'''Haemozoin''' is a disposal product formed from the digestion of [[blood]] by some blood-feeding [[parasite]]s. These [[hematophagy|hematophagous]] organisms such as [[Malaria]] parasites (''[[Plasmodium]] spp.''), ''[[Rhodnius]]'' and ''[[Schistosoma]]'' digest [[hemoglobin|haemoglobin]] and release high quantities of free [[heme]], which is the non-protein component of [[hemoglobin]]. A heme is a [[prosthetic group]] that consists of an [[iron]] atom contained in the center of a [[heterocyclic]] [[porphyrin]] ring. Free heme is toxic to cells, so the parasites convert it into an insoluble crystalline form called hemozoin. In malaria parasites, hemozoin is often called ''malaria pigment''.

Since the formation of hemozoin is essential to the survival of these parasites, it is an attractive target for [[drug development|developing drugs]] and is much-studied in ''[[Plasmodium]]'' as a way to find drugs to treat [[malaria]] (malaria's [[Achilles' heel]]). Several currently used [[antimalarial drug]]s, such as [[chloroquine]] and [[mefloquine]], are thought to kill malaria parasites by inhibiting haemozoin [[biocrystallization]].

==Discovery==
Black-brown pigment was observed by [[Johann Heinrich Meckel]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1227/01.NEU.0000367997.45720.A6 |vauthors=Janjua RM, Schultka R, Goebbel L, Pait TG, Shields CB |title= The legacy of Johann Friedrich Meckel the Elder (1724-1774): a 4-generation dynasty of anatomists|journal= Neurosurgery|volume=66 |issue=4|pages=758–770|year=2010|pmid = 20305497}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1847, in the blood and spleen of a person suffering from insanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Meckel H|title= Ueber schwarzes Pigment in der Milz und dem Blute einer Geisteskranken |journal=Zeitschrift für Psychiatrie |volume=IV |pages=198–226|year=1847 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until 1849 that the presence of this pigment was connected to infection with malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Virchow R|title= Zur pathologischen Physiologie des Bluts  |journal= Arch pathol Anatomie Physiol Klin Med|volume=2 |pages=587–598|year=1849  |doi =10.1007/BF02114475 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, it was thought that this pigment was produced by the body in response to infection, but [[Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran]] realized in 1880 that "malaria pigment" is, instead, produced by the parasites, as they multiplied within the [[red blood cell]].&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sullivan DJ |title=Theories on malarial pigment formation and quinoline action |journal=Int J Parasitol |volume=32 |issue=13 |pages=1645–53 |date=December 2002 |pmid=12435449 |doi=10.1016/S0020-7519(02)00193-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The link between pigment and malaria parasites was used by [[Ronald Ross]] to identify the stages in the ''Plasmodium'' life cycle that occur within the mosquito, since, although these forms of the parasite are different in appearance to the blood stages, they still contain traces of pigment.

Later, in 1891, T. Carbone and W.H. Brown (1911) published papers linking the degradation of hemoglobin with the production of pigment, describing the malaria pigment as a form of hematin and disproving the widely held idea that it is related to [[melanin]]. Brown observed that all melanins were bleaching rapidly with potassium permanganate, while with this reagent malarial pigment manifests not the slightest sign of a true bleach reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carbone T|title= Sulla natura chimica del pigmento malarico |journal=G R Accad Med Torino |volume=39 |pages=901–906|year=1891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown1911&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brown WH | year = 1911 | title = MALARIAL PIGMENT (SO-CALLED MELANIN): ITS NATURE AND MODE OF PRODUCTION | journal = J Exp Med  | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 290–299 | url = http://jem.rupress.org/cgi/reprint/13/2/290 |pmid = 19867409 | doi = 10.1084/jem.13.2.290 | pmc = 2124860}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "hemozoin" was proposed by [[Louis Westenra Sambon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sinton JA, Ghosh BN |title= Studies of malarial pigment (haemozoin).

This compound is toxic, since it is a [[pro-oxidant]] and catalyzes the production of [[reactive oxygen species]]. [[Oxidative stress]] is believed to be generated during the conversion of heme (ferroprotoporphyrin) to hematin (ferriprotoporphyrin). Free hematin can also bind to and disrupt [[cell membrane]]s, damaging cell structures and causing the lysis of the host erythrocyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fitch CD, Chevli R, Kanjananggulpan P, Dutta P, Chevli K, Chou AC |title=Intracellular ferriprotoporphyrin IX is a lytic agent |journal=Blood |volume=62 |issue=6 |pages=1165–1168 |year= 1983|pmid=6640106 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6640106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The unique reactivity of this molecule has been demonstrated in several ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' experimental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hebbel RP, Eaton JW |title=Pathobiology of heme interaction with the erythrocyte membrane|journal=Semin Hematol |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages= 136–149|date=April 1989 |pmid= 2658089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is in part due to the continued uncertainty over what molecules are involved in producing hemozoin, and partly from the difficulty in measuring the difference between aggregated or precipitated heme, and genuine hemozoin.&lt;ref name="Dorn A, Vippagunta SR, Matile H, Bubendorf A, Vennerstrom JL, Ridley RG 1998 737–47"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dorn A, Vippagunta SR, Matile H, Bubendorf A, Vennerstrom JL, Ridley RG |title=A comparison and analysis of several ways to promote haematin (haem) polymerisation and an assessment of its initiation in vitro |journal=Biochem Pharmacol |volume=55 |issue=6 |pages=737–747 |date=March 1998 |pmid=9586945 |doi=10.1016/S0006-2952(97)00509-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current assays are sensitive and accurate, but require multiple washing steps so are slow and not ideal for [[high-throughput screening]].&lt;ref name="Dorn A, Vippagunta SR, Matile H, Bubendorf A, Vennerstrom JL, Ridley RG 1998 737–47"/&gt; However, some screens have been performed with these assays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tekwani BL, Walker LA |title=Targeting the hemozoin synthesis pathway for new antimalarial drug discovery: technologies for in vitro beta-hematin formation assay |journal=Comb Chem High Throughput Screen |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=63–79 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15720198 |doi=10.2174/1386207053328101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

β-Hematin crystals are made of [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]]s of hematin molecules that are, in turn, joined together by hydrogen bonds to form larger structures. In these dimers, an [[iron]]-[[oxygen]] [[coordinate bond]] links the central iron of one hematin to the oxygen of the [[carboxylate]] side-chain of the adjacent hematin. These reciprocal iron–oxygen bonds are highly unusual and have not been observed in any other porphyrin dimer. β-Hematin can be either a cyclic [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]] or a linear [[polymer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lemberg R, Legge JW |title=Hematin compounds and bile pigments|journal=Interscience, New York|year=1949 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/6453}}&lt;/ref&gt; a polymeric form has never been found in hemozoin, disproving the widely held idea that hemozoin is produced by the [[enzyme]] heme-polymerase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hempelmann E, Marques HM |title=Analysis of malaria pigment from Plasmodium falciparum|journal=J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages= 25–30|date=September 1994 |pmid=7833503 |doi= 10.1016/1056-8719(94)90013-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemozoin crystals have a distinct [[triclinic]] structure and are weakly [[magnetic]]. The difference between [[diamagnetic]] low-spin oxyhemoglobin and [[paramagnetic]] hemozoin can be used for isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paul F, Roath S, Melville D, Warhurst DC, Osisanya JO |title=Separation of malaria-infected erythrocytes from whole blood: use of a selective high-gradient magnetic separation technique|journal= Lancet |volume= 2  |issue= 8237 |pages=70–71 |year=1981 |pmid=6113443 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(81)90414-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim CC, Wilson EB, Derisi JL |title= Improved methods for magnetic purification of malaria parasites and haemozoin|journal= Malar J |volume= 9  |issue= 1 |page=17 |year=2010 |pmid=20074366 |pmc=2817699 |doi=10.1186/1475-2875-9-17 |url =http://www.malariajournal.com/content/pdf/1475-2875-9-17.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also exhibit optical [[dichroism]], which means that they absorb light more strongly along their length than across their width, which allows the automated detection of malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mendelow BV, Lyons C, Nhlangothi P, Tana M, Munster M, Wypkema E, Liebowitz L, Marshall L, Scott S, Coetzer TL |title=Automated malaria detection by depolarization of laser light|journal= Br J Haematol|volume=  104 |issue= 3 |pages= 499–503 |year=1999 |pmid=10086786 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119062356/PDFSTART |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01199.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemozoin is produced in a form that, under the action of an applied [[magnetic field]], gives rise to an induced optical [[dichroism]] characteristic of the hemozoin concentration; and precise measurement of this induced [[dichroism]] may be used to determine the level of malarial infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Newman DM, Heptinstall J, Matelon RJ, Savage L, Wears ML, Beddow J, Cox M, Schallig HD, Mens P |title=A Magneto-Optic Route toward the In Vivo Diagnosis of Malaria: Preliminary Results and Preclinical Trial Data|journal=Biophys J |year=2008 |pmid=18390603 |volume= 95 |pages= 994–1000 |url=http://www.mottest.org/News/A_Magneto_optical__route_to_in-vivo_dianosis_of_malaria_-Biophys.pdf |issue= 2 |doi= 10.1529/biophysj.107.128140 |pmc= 2440472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inhibitors==

[[File:Drug-heme interaction.png|thumb|left|Drug heme interaction]]
Hemozoin formation is an excellent drug target, since it is a process that is essential to the survival of the malaria parasite and absent from the human host. The drug target hematin is host-derived and largely outside the genetic control of the parasite, which makes the development of drug resistance more difficult. Many clinically used drugs are thought to act by inhibiting the formation of hemozoin in the food vacuole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ziegler J, Linck R, Wright DW |title=Heme Aggregation inhibitors: antimalarial drugs targeting an essential biomineralization process |journal=Curr Med Chem |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=171–89 |date=February 2001 |pmid=11172673 |doi=10.2174/0929867013373840}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prevents the detoxification of the heme released in this compartment, and kills the parasite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Coronado LM, Nadovich CT, Spadafora C |title= Malarial hemozoin: From target to tool|journal=Biochim Biophys Acta |volume=1840 |issue=6 |pages=2032–2041 |date=2014 |pmid= 24556123|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304416514000555 |doi=10.1016/j.bbagen.2014.02.009|pmc=4049529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best-understood examples of such hematin [[biocrystallization]] inhibitors are [[quinoline]] drugs such as [[chloroquine]] and [[mefloquine]]. These drugs bind to both free heme and hemozoin crystals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sullivan DJ, Gluzman IY, Russell DG, Goldberg DE |title=On the molecular mechanism of chloroquine's antimalarial action |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=93 |issue=21 |pages=11865–70 |date=October 1996 |pmid=8876229 |pmc=38150 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8876229 |doi=10.1073/pnas.93.21.11865}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore block the addition of new heme units onto the growing crystals. The small, most rapidly growing face is the face to which inhibitors are believed to bind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de Villiers KA, Marques HM, Egan TJ |title=The crystal structure of halofantrine-ferriprotoporphyrin IX and the mechanism of action of arylmethanol antimalarials|journal= J Inorg Biochem|volume= 102 |issue=8 |pages=1660–1667|date=August 2008 |pmid=18508124 |doi=10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2008.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weissbuch I, Leiserowitz L |title=Interplay between malaria, crystalline hemozoin formation, and antimalarial drug action and design|journal= Chem Rev |volume= 108 |issue=11 |pages=4899–4914|year=2008 |pmid=19006402 |doi=10.1021/cr078274t}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in pathophysiology==
Hemozoin is released into the circulation during reinfection and phagocytosed in vivo and in vitro by host phagocytes and alters important functions in those cells.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2126">{{one source|date=October 2017}}'''Horizontal transmission''' is the transmission of infections between members of the same species that are not in a parent-child relationship.  This has been generalized to include transmissions of cultural traits between humans.

Because the evolutionary fate of the agent is not tied to reproductive success of the host, horizontal transmission tends to [[evolution|evolve]] [[virulence]].  It is therefore a critical concept for [[evolutionary medicine]].

In biological, but not cultural, transmissions the carriers (also known as [[Vector_(epidemiology)|vectors]]) may include other species.  The two main biological modes of transmission are ''anterior station'' and ''posterior station''. In anterior station, transmission occurs via the bite of an infected organism (the vector), like in [[malaria]], [[dengue fever]], and [[bubonic plague]]. Posterior station is transmission via contact with infected feces. Examples are [[rickettsiae]] driven diseases (like [[typhus]]), which are contracted by a body louse's fecal material being scratched into the bloodstream.  The vector is not necessarily another species, however.  For example, a dog infected with [[Rabies]] may infect another dog via anterior station transmission.  Moreover, there are other modes of biological transmission, such as generalized bleeding in [[Ebola virus disease|ebola]].

Cultural transmission may also be horizontal which is explicitly [[Reification (statistics)|reified]] in [[Dual inheritance theory|Dual Inheritance Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Cavalli-Sforza, L.L. and M. Feldman. 1981. ''Cultural Transmission and Evolution: A Quantitative Approach''.  Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Horizontal transmission is implicit in the [[Meme|meme theory of cultural evolution]], where the "meme" has been characterized by [[Richard Dawkins]] as a "[[Viruses of the Mind|Virus of the Mind]]".

[[File:Human Fertilization.png|thumb|300px|Fertilization in humans. The sperm and ovum unite through fertilization, creating a conceptus that (over the course of 8-9 days) will implant in the uterine wall, where it will reside over the course of 9 months.]]

In humans, '''implantation''' is the stage of [[pregnancy]] at which the embryo adheres to the wall of the [[uterus]]. At this stage of [[prenatal development]], the [[conceptus]] is called a [[blastocyst]]. It is by this adhesion that the embryo receives oxygen and nutrients from the mother to be able to grow.

In humans, implantation of a [[Human fertilization|fertilized]] [[ovum]] is most likely to occur around 9 days after [[ovulation]], however this can range between 6 and 12 days.&lt;ref name="wilcox"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Wilcox AJ, Baird DD, Weinberg CR | title=Time of implantation of the Conceptus and loss of pregnancy | journal=New England Journal of Medicine | volume=340 | issue=23 | pages=1796–1799 | year=1999 | pmid=10362823 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199906103402304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implantation window==
The reception-ready phase of the [[endometrium]] of the uterus is usually termed the "implantation window" and lasts about 4 days. The implantation window occurs around 6 days after the peak in [[luteinizing hormone]] levels. With some disparity between sources, it has been stated to occur from 7 days after ovulation until 9 days after ovulation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| journal = Fertility and Sterility| title = Leukemia inhibitory factor is dysregulated in the endometrium and uterine flushing fluid of patients with adenomyosis during implantation window | first7 = Y.| last7 = Zhou| volume = 94| issue = 1| doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.03.012| pmid = 19361790| year = 2010| pages = 85–89 | first6 = B.| last6 = Cai| last3 = Yang | first2 = X.| last2 = Sun | first1 = Y. | first3 = X.| last4 = Zhang | first5 = Q.| last5 = Xue | first4 = J.| last1 = Xiao}}&lt;/ref&gt; or days 6-10 postovulation.&lt;ref&gt;Aboubakr M. Elnashar, Gamal I. Aboul-Enein. ''[http://www.bioline.org.br/request?mf04003 Endometrial receptivity]''. Middle East Fertility Society Journal, Vol. 9, No. 1, 2004, pp. 10-24&lt;/ref&gt; On average, it occurs during the 20th to the 23rd day after the [[last menstrual period]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.embryology.ch/anglais/gnidation/etape02.html 6.2 Implantation stages] from embryology.ch at by the universities of Fribourg, Lausanne and Bern (Switzerland). Retrieved May, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The implantation window is characterized by changes to the endometrium cells, which aid in the absorption of the uterine fluid. These changes are collectively known as [[the plasma membrane transformation]] and bring the [[blastocyst]] nearer to the endometrium and immobilize it. During this stage the blastocyst can still be eliminated by being flushed out of the uterus. Scientists have hypothesized that the hormones cause a swelling that fills the flattened out uterine cavity just prior to this stage, which may also help press the blastocyst against the endometrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Implantation stages|url=http://www.embryology.ch/anglais/gnidation/etape02.html|work=Human Embryology|publisher=Online course in embryology for medicine students developed by the universities of Fribourg, Lausanne and Bern (Switzerland) with the support of the Swiss Virtual Campus|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implantation window may also be initiated by other preparations in the endometrium of the uterus, both structurally and in the composition of its secretions.

==Adaptation of uterus==
To enable implantation, the uterus goes through changes in order to be able to receive the conceptus.

===Predecidualization===
The endometrium increases thickness, becomes [[Angiogenesis|vascularized]] and its glands grow to be tortuous and boosted in their secretions. These changes reach their maximum about 7 days after [[ovulation]].

Furthermore, the surface of the endometrium produces a kind of rounded cells, which cover the whole area toward the uterine cavity. This happens about 9 to 10 days after ovulation.&lt;ref name=boron&gt;{{Cite book|first=Walter |last=Boron |authorlink=Walter Boron |author2=[[Emile Boulpaep]]  |title=Medical Physiology: A Cellular And Molecular Approaoch |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |location=[[Oxford]] |year=2004 |isbn=1-4160-2328-3 |oclc=61527528}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cells are called [[decidual cell]]s, which emphasises that the whole layer of them is shed off in every [[menstruation]] if no pregnancy occurs, just as leaves of [[deciduous trees]]. The uterine glands, on the other hand, decrease in activity and degenerate around 8 to 9 days&lt;ref name=boron/&gt; after ovulation in absence of pregnancy.

The [[decidual cell]]s originate from the stromal cells that are always present in the endometrium. However, the decidual cells make up a new layer, the [[decidua]]. The rest of the endometrium, in addition, expresses differences between the luminal and the basal sides. The luminal cells form the [[zona compacta]] of the endometrium, in contrast to the basalolateral [[zona spongiosa]], which consists of the rather spongy stromal cells.&lt;ref name=boron/&gt;

===Decidualization===
Decidualization succeeds predecidualization if pregnancy occurs. This is an expansion of it, further developing the uterine glands, the zona compacta and the epithelium of decidual cells lining it. The decidual cells become filled with lipids and glycogen and take the polyhedral shape characteristic for decidual cells.

====Trigger====
It is likely that the blastocyst itself makes the main contribution to this additional growing and sustaining of the decidua. An indication of this is that decidualization occurs at a higher degree in conception cycles than in nonconception cycles.&lt;ref name=boron/&gt; Furthermore, similar changes are observed when giving stimuli mimicking the natural invasion of the embryo.&lt;ref name=boron/&gt;

====Parts of decidua====
The decidua can be organized into separate sections, although they have the same composition.

*Decidua basalis - This is the part of the decidua which is located basalolateral to the embryo after implantation.
*Decidua capsularis - Decidua capsularis grows over the embryo on the luminal side, enclosing it into the endometrium. It surrounds the embryo together with decidua basalis.
*Decidua parietalis - All other decidua on the uterine surface belongs to decidua parietalis.

===Decidua throughout pregnancy===
After implantation the decidua remains, at least through the first trimester.&lt;ref name=boron/&gt; However, its most prominent time is during the early stages of pregnancy, during implantation. Its function as a surrounding tissue is replaced by the definitive [[placenta]]. However, some elements of the decidualization remain throughout pregnancy.&lt;ref name=boron/&gt;

The compacta and spongiosa layers are still observable beneath the decidua in pregnancy. The glands of the spongiosa layer continue to secrete during the first trimester, when they degenerate. However, before that disappearance, some glands secrete unequally much. This phenomenon of hypersecretion is called the [[Arias-Stella phenomenon]],&lt;ref name=boron/&gt; after the pathologist [[Javier Arias-Stella]].

===Pinopodes===
{{Main|Pinopod}}

Pinopodes are small, finger-like protrusions from the endometrium. They appear between day 19 and day 21&lt;ref name=boron/&gt; of [[gestational age]]. This corresponds to a [[fertilization age]] of approximately 5 to 7 days, which corresponds well with the time of implantation. They only persist for 2 to 3 days.&lt;ref name=boron/&gt; The development of them is enhanced by [[progesterone]] but inhibited by [[estrogens]].

====Function in implantation====
Pinopodes [[endocytosis|endocytose]] uterine fluid and macromolecules in it. By doing so, the volume of the uterus decreases, taking the walls closer to the embryoblast floating in it. Thus, the period of active pinocytes might also limit the implantation window.&lt;ref name=boron/&gt;

====Function during implantation====
Pinopodes continue to absorb fluid, and removes most of it during the early stages of implantation.

Not only the lining of the uterus transforms, but in addition, the secretion from its epithelial glands changes. This change is induced by increased levels of [[progesterone]] from the [[corpus luteum]]. The target of the secretions is the embryoblast, and has several functions on it.

===Nourishment===
The embryoblast spends approximately 72 hours&lt;ref name=boron/&gt; in the uterine cavity before implanting. In that time, it cannot receive nourishment directly from the blood of the mother, and must rely on secreted nutrients into the uterine cavity, e.g. iron&lt;ref name=boron/&gt; and fat-soluble vitamins.&lt;ref name=boron/&gt;

===Growth and implantation===
In addition to nourishment, the endometrium secretes several [[steroid]]-dependent proteins,&lt;ref name=boron/&gt; important for growth and implantation. [[Cholesterol]]&lt;ref name=boron/&gt; and steroids&lt;ref name=boron/&gt; are also secreted. Implantation is further facilitated by synthesis of [[matrix (biology)|matrix]] substances, [[adhesion molecules]] and surface [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] for the matrix substances.

==Mechanism==
Implantation is initiated when the blastocyst comes into contact with the uterine wall.

===Zona hatching===
{{Main|Zona hatching}}
To be able to perform implantation, the blastocyst first needs to get rid of its [[zona pellucida]]. This process can be called "hatching".

====Factors====
Lytic factors in the uterine cavity, as well as factors from the blastocyst itself are essential for this process. Mechanisms in the latter are indicated by that the zona pellucida remains intact if an unfertilized egg is placed in the uterus under the same conditions.&lt;ref name=boron/&gt; A substance probably involved is [[plasmin]]. [[Plasminogen]], the plasmin precursor, is found in the uterine cavity, and blastocyst factors contribute to its conversion to active plasmin. This hypothesis is supported by lytic effects [[in vitro]] by plasmin.&lt;ref name=boron/&gt; Furthermore, plasmin inhibitors also inhibit the entire zona hatching in rat experiments.&lt;ref name=boron/&gt;

===Apposition===
The very first, albeit loose, connection between the blastocyst and the endometrium is called the apposition.&lt;ref name=boron/&gt;

====Location====
On the endometrium, the apposition is usually made where there is a small crypt in it, perhaps because it increases the area of contact with the rather spherical blastocyst.

On the blastocyst, on the other hand, it occurs at a location where there has been enough lysis of the zona pellucida to have created a rupture to enable direct contact between the underlying [[trophoblast]] and the decidua of the endometrium.&lt;ref name=boron/&gt; However, ultimately, the [[inner cell mass]], inside the [[trophoblast]] layer, is aligned closest to the decidua. Nevertheless, the apposition on the blastocyst is not dependent on if it is on the same side of the blastocyst as the inner cell mass. Rather, the inner cell mass rotates inside the trophoblast to align to the apposition.&lt;ref name=boron/&gt; In short, the entire surface of the blastocyst has a potential to form the apposition to the decidua.

====Molecular Mechanism====
The identity of the molecules on the trophoblast and the endometrial epithelia that mediate the initial interaction between the two remain unidentified. However, a number of research groups have proposed that [[MUC1]], a member of the [[Mucin]] family of glycosylated proteins, is involved.&lt;ref name=Margarit1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Margarit|first1=L.|last2=Taylor|first2=A.|last3=Roberts|first3=M. H.|last4=Hopkins|first4=L.|last5=Davies|first5=C.|last6=Brenton|first6=A. G.|last7=Conlan|first7=R. S.|last8=Bunkheila|first8=A.|last9=Joels|first9=L.|last10=White|first10=J.

D.|last2=''et al.,''|title=Trophoblast L-selectin-mediated adhesion at the maternal-fetal interface|journal=Science|date=2003|volume=299|issue=5605|pages=405–8|doi=10.1126/science.1079546|pmid=12532021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adhesion===
Adhesion is a much stronger attachment to the endometrium than the loose apposition.

The trophoblasts adhere by penetrating the endometrium, with protrusions of trophoblast cells.

====Communication====
There is massive communication between the blastocyst and the endometrium at this stage. The blastocyst signals to the endometrium to adapt further to its presence, e.g. by changes in the [[cytoskeleton]] of decidual cells. This, in turn, dislodges the decidual cells from their connection to the underlying [[basal lamina]], which enables the blastocyst to perform the succeeding invasion.&lt;ref name=boron/&gt;

This communication is conveyed by [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]-[[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]]-interactions, both integrin-matrix and proteoglycan ones.

=====Proteoglycan Receptors=====
Another ligand-receptor system involved in adhesion is proteoglycan receptors, found on the surface of the decidua of the uterus. Their counterparts, the proteoglycans, are found around the trophoblast cells of the blastocyst. This ligand-receptor system also is present just at the implantation window.&lt;ref name=boron/&gt;

===Invasion===
Invasion is an even further establishment of the blastocyst in the endometrium.

====Syncytiotrophoblasts====
The protrusions of trophoblast cells that adhere into the endometrium continue to proliferate and penetrate into the endometrium. As these trophoblast cells penetrate, they differentiate to become a new type of cells, [[syncytiotrophoblast]]. The prefix syn- refers to the transformation that occurs as the boundaries between these cells disappear to form a single mass of many [[cell nucleus|cell nuclei]] ([[syncytium|a syncytium]]). The rest of the trophoblasts, surrounding the inner cell mass, are hereafter called [[cytotrophoblast]]s.

Invasion continues with the syncytiotrophoblasts reaching the basal membrane beneath the decidual cells, penetrating it and further invading into the uterine stroma. Finally, the whole embryo is embedded in the endometrium. Eventually, the syncytiotrophoblasts come into contact with maternal blood and form [[chorionic villi]]. This is the initiation of forming the [[placenta]].

====Secretions====
The blastocyst secretes factors for a multitude of purposes during invasion. It secretes several [[autocrine]] factors, targeting itself and stimulating it to further invade the endometrium.&lt;ref name=boron/&gt; Furthermore, secretions loosen decidual cells from each other, prevent the embryo from being rejected by the mother, trigger the final decidualization and prevent menstruation.

=====Autocrine=====
[[Human chorionic gonadotropin]] is an autocrine growth factor for the blastocyst.&lt;ref name=boron/&gt; [[Insulin-like growth factor 2]],&lt;ref name=boron/&gt; on the other hand, stimulates the invasiveness of it.

=====Dislodging=====
The syncytiotrophoblasts dislodges decidual cells in their way, both by degradation of [[cell adhesion molecule]]s linking the decidual cells together as well as degradation of the extracellular matrix between them.

Cell adhesion molecules are degraded by syncytiotrophoblast secretion of [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha]]. This inhibits the expression of [[cadherins]] and [[beta-catenin]].&lt;ref name=boron/&gt; Cadherins are cell adhesion molecules, and beta-catenin helps to anchor them to the cell membrane. Inhibited expression of these molecules thus loosens the connection between decidual cells, permitting the syncytotrophoblasts and the whole embryo with them to invade into the endometrium.

The extracellular matrix is degraded by [[serine endopeptidases]] and [[metalloproteinase]]s. Examples of such metalloproteinases are [[collagenases]], [[gelatinases]] and [[stromelysin]]s.&lt;ref name=boron/&gt; These collagenases digest [[Type-I collagen]], [[Type-II collagen]], [[Type-III collagen]], Type-VII collagen and Type-X collagen.&lt;ref name=boron/&gt; The gelatinases exist in two forms; one digesting [[Type-IV collagen]] and one digesting [[gelatin]].&lt;ref name=boron/&gt;

=====Immunosuppressive=====
The embryo differs from the cells of the mother, and would be rejected as a parasite by the [[immune system]] of the mother if it didn't secrete [[immunosuppressive]] agents. Such agents are [[Platelet-activating factor]], [[human chorionic gonadotropin]], [[early pregnancy factor]], [[immunosuppressive factor]], [[Prostaglandin E]]2, [[Interleukin 1]]-alpha, [[Interleukin 6]], [[interferon]]-alpha, [[leukemia inhibitory factor]] and [[Colony-Stimulating Factor]].

=====Decidualization=====
Factors from the blastocyst also trigger the final formation of decidual cells into their proper form. In contrast, some decidual cells in the proximity of the blastocyst degenerate, providing nutrients for it.&lt;ref name=boron/&gt;

=====Prevention of menstruation=====
[[Human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) not only acts as an immunosuppressive,&lt;ref name=boron/&gt; but also "notifies" the mother's body that she is [[pregnant]], preventing menstruation by sustaining the function of the [[corpus luteum]].

=====Other factors=====
Other factors secreted by the blastocyst are;
*Embryo-derived [[histamine-releasing factor]]
*[[Tissue plasminogen activator]] as well as its inhibitors
*[[Estradiol]]
*β1-[[integrin]]s
*[[Fibroblast growth factor]]
*[[CYTL1]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ai Z., Jing W., Fang L. | year = 2015 | title = Cytokine-Like Protein 1 (Cytl1)  A Potential Molecular Mediator in Embryo Implantation | journal = PLOS One | volume = 11 | issue = 1| page = e0147424 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0147424 | pmid=26800213 | pmc=4723121}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Transforming growth factor alpha]]
*[[inhibin]]

==Failure==
{{visible anchor|Implantation failure}} is considered to be caused by inadequate uterine receptivity in two-thirds of cases, and by problems with the embryo itself in the other third.&lt;ref name="MelfordTaylor2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Melford|first1=S.

Inadequate uterine receptivity may be caused by abnormal [[cytokine]] and hormonal signaling as well as [[epigenetic alteration]]s.&lt;ref name=Cakmak2011/&gt; Recurrent implantation failure is a cause of [[female infertility]]. Therefore, [[pregnancy rate]]s can be improved by optimizing endometrial receptivity for implantation.&lt;ref name=Cakmak2011/&gt; Evaluation of implantation markers may help to predict pregnancy outcome and detect occult implantation deficiency.&lt;ref name=Cakmak2011&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq037 | title = Implantation failure: Molecular mechanisms and clinical treatment | year = 2010 | last1 = Cakmak | first1 = H. | last2 = Taylor | first2 = H.

[[Luteal support]] is the administration of medication, generally [[progestin]]s, for the purpose of increasing the success rate of implantation and early [[Human embryogenesis|embryogenesis]], thereby complementing the function of the [[corpus luteum]].

==Description==
Typically, a parent may take a sick child to a traditional healer, who will look in the child's mouth and attribute the illness to "[[tooth worms]]". The healer will point out the small, white, developing [[Tooth development#The developing tooth bud|tooth buds]] as being "tooth worms", and then dig the "worms" out of the gums without [[anaesthesia]] using a non-sterile tool such as a hot or sharpened nail, a bicycle spoke, or a knitting needle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Harm==
This practice inflicts pain and suffering on a child who may already be sick (or who may be teething), and in some cases it is carried out on a healthy child in a bid to prevent illness. The procedure may lead to shock, and loss of blood may lead to [[anaemia]]. The unhygienic methods can cause [[blood infection]]s, [[tetanus]], pass on [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], and can on occasion be fatal.&lt;ref name="john"&gt;{{Cite journal

The Mexican '''Civil Service Social Security and Services Institute''' ({{lang-es|Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado}}, or '''ISSSTE''')&lt;ref&gt;Also sometimes rendered in English as the "State Workers Social Security Institute"&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[federal government]] organization in [[Mexico]] that administers part of Mexico's [[health care]] and [[social security]] systems, and provides assistance in cases of disability, old age, risks in labor, and death (or IVCM, for ''invalidez, vejez, cesantía en edad avanzada, y muerte'') to federal workers.  Unlike the [[Mexican Social Security Institute]] (or IMSS), which covers workers in the private sector, the ISSSTE is charged with providing benefits for federal government workers only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Gerson  | first = Philip R.  | authorlink =   |author2=Cuevas, Alfredo  | title = Pension Regimes and Saving  | publisher = [[International Monetary Fund]]  | year = 1997  | location = Washington, D.C.  | pages = appendix III  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BAWf5BuQt0sC  | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 1-55775-640-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Together with the IMSS, the ISSSTE provides health coverage for between 55 and 60 percent of the population of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Purcell  | first = Susan Kaufman  | authorlink =   |author2=Rubio-Freidberg, Luis  | title = Mexico Under Zedillo  | publisher = [[Lynne Reinner Publishers]]  | year = 1998  | location =   | pages = 81  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NW8lXlGmsKEC  | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 1-55587-315-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like much of Mexico's health care system, the ISSSTE has been the subject of numerous criticisms and allegations, ranging from [[Political corruption|corruption]] to a heavy regional bias in favor of major cities with well organized labor unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Dawson  | first = Alexander  | authorlink =   | title = First World Dreams: Mexico Since 1989  | publisher = Zed Books  | year = 2006  | location =   | pages = 32, 126  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oC_5C2jhwusC  | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 1-84277-661-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded in 1959 by [[President of Mexico|president]] [[Adolfo López Mateos]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In addition to ISSSTE, which is exclusive for employees of the federal government, states in Mexico have their own separate health and retirement system for government workers within its own state. For example, the state of [[Tabasco]] offers its employees retirement, health, and other similar benefits through an agency called ''Instituto de Seguridad Social del Estado de Tabasco'', or "ISSET".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isset.gob.mx/normatividad/Ley_ISSET.pdf ''Ley del Instituto de Seguridad Social del Estado de Tabasco*.''] State Government of the State of Tabasco.

'''Inversion therapy''' involves being upside down or at an inverted angle while hanging by the legs, ankles, or feet with the intention of therapeutic benefits. The process of doing so is called '''inversion'''.  It is a form of [[spinal decompression]] and is a form of spinal [[traction (orthopedics)|traction]].&lt;ref name="mayo"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Gravity boots are ankle supports designed for inversion therapy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4937754.stm "Brown plays down Code controversy"] [[BBC]]; 24 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Some people use gravity boots to add an extra challenge to workouts, doing inverted [[crunch (exercise)|crunches]] or [[squat (exercise)|squats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hang Ten|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953859,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=2 May 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who have [[heart disease]], [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], eye diseases (such as [[glaucoma]]), or are [[pregnancy|pregnant]] are at higher risk for the dangers related to inversion therapy and should consult their doctors about it first. The first time anyone tries inversion therapy with gravity, they should be sure to have someone standing by, in case assistance is required to get out of the apparatus, or if health problems are experienced.&lt;ref name="mayo" /&gt;

During an episode of [[acid reflux]], small amounts of stomach acid may manage to escape from the stomach and into the [[oesophagus]]. Typically, gravity minimises this upward leakage but combining an inversion table and acid reflux can be a painful, nauseating, and potentially dangerous combination.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake''' was a lottery established in the [[Irish Free State]] in 1930 as the '''Irish Free State Hospitals' Sweepstake''' to finance hospitals. It is generally referred to as the '''Irish Sweepstake''', frequently abbreviated to '''Irish Sweeps''' or '''Irish Sweep'''. The Public Charitable Hospitals (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1930 was the act that established the lottery; as this act expired in 1934, in accordance with its terms, the Public Hospitals Acts were the legislative basis for the scheme thereafter. The main organisers were Richard Duggan, Captain Spencer Freeman and [[Joseph McGrath (Irish politician)|Joe McGrath]]. Duggan was a well known Dublin [[bookmaker]] who had organised a number of sweepstakes in the decade prior to setting up the Hospitals' Sweepstake. Captain Freeman was a Welsh-born engineer and former captain in the British Army. After the [[Constitution of Ireland]] was enacted in 1937, the name ''Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake'' was adopted.

==History==
The sweepstake was established because there was a need for investment in hospitals and medical services and the public finances were unable to meet this expense at the time. As the population of Ireland was unable to raise sufficient funds, because of its low population, a significant amount of the funds were raised in the United Kingdom and United States, often among the emigrant Irish. Potentially winning tickets were drawn from rotating drums, usually by nurses in uniform. Each such ticket was assigned to a horse expected to run in one of several [[horse racing|horse races]], including the [[Cambridgeshire Handicap]], [[Epsom Derby|Derby]] and [[Grand National]].&lt;ref&gt;Coleman 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Tickets that drew the favourite horses thus stood a higher likelihood of winning and a series of winning horses had to be chosen on the [[Parlay (gambling)|accumulator]] system, allowing for enormous prizes.

[[File:FF Warren engineer, Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|F. F. Warren, the engineer who designed the mixing drums from which sweepstake tickets were drawn]]
The original sweepstake draws were held at [[Mansion House, Dublin|The Mansion House]], Dublin on 19 May 1939 under the supervision of the Chief Commissioner of Police, and were moved to the more permanent fixture at the [[Royal Dublin Society]] (RDS) in [[Ballsbridge]] later in 1940.

The [[Adelaide Hospital (Dublin)|Adelaide Hospital]] in Dublin was the only hospital at the time not to accept money from the Hospitals Trust, as the governors disapproved of sweepstakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Report | first= | title=Irish Hospitals |newspaper=[[The Irish Times]] | page= 36 | date=25 July 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1960s onwards, revenues declined. Although giving the appearance of a public charitable lottery, with nurses featured prominently in the advertising and drawings, the Sweepstake was in fact a private for-profit lottery company, and the owners were paid substantial dividends from the profits. ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune Magazine]]'' described it as "a private company run for profit and its handful of stockholders have used their earnings from the sweepstakes to build a group of industrial enterprises that loom quite large in the modest Irish economy. [[Waterford Crystal|Waterford Glass]], Irish Glass Bottle Company and many other new Irish companies were financed by money from this enterprise and up to 5,000 people were given jobs."&lt;ref&gt;''Fortune Magazine'', November 1966&lt;/ref&gt; By his death in 1966, [[Joseph McGrath (Irish politician)|Joe McGrath]] had interests in the racing industry, and held the [[Renault]] dealership for Ireland besides large financial and property assets. He was known throughout Ireland for his tough business attitude but also by his generous spirit. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} At that time, Ireland was still one of the poorer countries in Europe; he believed in investment in Ireland. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} His home, Cabinteely House, was donated to the state in 1986. The house and the surrounding park are now in the ownership of [[Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council]] who have invested in restoring and maintaining the house and grounds as a public park.

In 1986, the Irish government created a [[National Lottery (Ireland)|new public lottery]], and the company failed to secure the new contract to manage it. The final sweepstake was held in January 1986 and the company was unsuccessful for a licence bid for the [[Irish National Lottery]], which was won by [[An Post]] later that year. The company went into voluntary liquidation in March 1987. The majority of workers did not have a pension scheme but the sweepstake had fed many families during lean times and was regarded as a safe job. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The Public Hospitals (Amendment) Act, 1990 was enacted for the orderly winding up of the scheme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Public Hospitals (Amendment) Act, 1990 |work=Acts of the Oireachtas |publisher=[[Attorney General of Ireland]] |date=1990 |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1990/act/30/enacted/en/print |accessdate=2016-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which had by then almost [[Irish pound|£]]500,000 in unclaimed prizes and accrued interest.

A collection of advertising material relating to the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes is among the Special Collections of [[National Irish Visual Arts Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=All Special Collections |publisher=National Irish Visual Arts Library |url=http://www.nival.ie/collections/all-special-collections/ |accessdate=20 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===In the United Kingdom and North America===
At the time of the Sweepstake's inception, lotteries were generally illegal in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. In the absence of other readily available lotteries, the Irish Sweeps became popular. Even though tickets were illegal outside Ireland, millions were sold in the US and Great Britain. How many of these tickets failed to make it back for the drawing is unknown. The United States Customs Service alone confiscated and destroyed several million [[Wiktionary:counterfoil|counterfoil]]s from shipments being returned to Ireland.

In the UK, the sweepstakes caused some strain in [[Anglo-Irish]] relations, and the Betting and Lotteries Act 1934 was passed by the parliament of the UK to prevent export and import of lottery related materials.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Congress]] had outlawed the use of the [[United States Postal Service|US Postal Service]] for lottery purposes in 1890. A thriving [[black market]] sprang up for tickets in both jurisdictions.

From the 1950s onwards, as the American, British and Canadian governments relaxed their attitudes towards this form of gambling, and went into the lottery business themselves, the Irish Sweeps, never legal in the United States,&lt;ref name="Coleman Irish Historical Studies"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Coleman |first=M |authorlink= |title=The Irish Hospitals Sweepstake in the United States of America, 1930-39. |journal= Irish Historical Studies |volume=35 |issue=138 |pages= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |date=2006 |language= |url= |jstor=20547430 |issn= |doi= |id= }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|227}} declined in popularity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2057">{{Distinguish|Lead time bias}}

'''Length time bias''' is a form of [[selection bias]], a statistical distortion of results that can lead to incorrect conclusions about the data. Length time bias can occur when the lengths of intervals are analysed by selecting intervals that occupy randomly chosen points in time or space.{{Clarify | date = December 2018 | text = that occupy randomly chosen points in time or space}} That process favors longer intervals and so skews the data.

Length time bias is often discussed in the context of the benefits of [[cancer]] screening, and it can lead to the perception that screening leads to better outcomes when in reality it has no effect. Fast-growing [[tumors]] generally have a shorter [[asymptomatic]] phase than slower-growing tumors. Thus, there is a shorter period of time during which the cancer is present in the body (and so might be detected by screening) but not yet large enough to cause symptoms, that would cause the patient to seek medical care and be diagnosed without screening.

As a result, if the same number of slow-growing and fast-growing tumors appear in a year, the screening test detects more slow-growers than fast-growers. If the slow growing tumors are less likely to be fatal than the fast growers, the people whose cancer is detected by screening do better, on average, than the people whose tumors are detected from symptoms (or at autopsy) even if there is no real benefit to catching the cancer earlier. That can give the impression that detecting cancers by screening causes cancers to be less dangerous even if less dangerous cancers are simply more likely to be detected by screening.[http://www.fpnotebook.com/Prevent/Epi/LngthBs.htm]

'''Mammaplasty''' (also called '''mammoplasty'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=mammoplasty|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/mammoplasty|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''mastoplasty''') refers to a group of [[surgery|surgical procedures]], the goal of which is to reshape or otherwise modify the appearance of the [[breast]]. There are two main types of mammoplasty:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horndeski|first1=Gary|title=mammaplasty (mammoplasty) surgical procedures|url=http://horndeski.com/mammaplasty-surgical-procedures/|publisher=Horndeski Method|accessdate=10 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210213447/http://horndeski.com/mammaplasty-surgical-procedures/|archivedate=10 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breast Procedures|url=http://www.wakehealth.edu/School/Plastic-and-Reconstructive-Surgery/Breast-Procedures.htm|publisher=Wake Forest School of Medicine|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[breast augmentation|Augmentation mammaplasty]] is commonly performed to increase the size, change the shape, and/or alter the texture of the breasts. This usually involves the surgical [[Implant (medicine)|implantation]] of [[breast implant|breast implant devices]].
#[[breast reduction|Reduction mammaplasty]] is commonly performed to reduce the size, change the shape, and/or alter the texture of the breasts. This involves the removal of breast tissue.

== Social context ==
Mammaplasty started out a surgical procedure to help relieve women of the excess weight of their [[Breast|breasts]], it was only later that it was used for cosmetic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lalardrie|first=J. P.|last2=Mouly|first2=R.|date=December 1978|title=History of mammaplasty|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01577951|journal=Aesthetic Plastic Surgery|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=167–176|doi=10.1007/bf01577951|issn=0364-216X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is immense pressure on women to subscribe to socially prescribed beauty standards of their bodies must be, a part of this is the pressure on women to have 'perfect breasts'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/photo-stories/this-is-the-perfect-breast-shape/photostory/59986823.cms|title=This is the perfect breast shape  {{!}} The Times of India|website=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/julia-hartleybrewer/women-double-standards_b_6696882.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer_us=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_cs=ojh_XZIz6oZ7Jxvux65Rfw|title=The Pressure to Be Perfect|date=2015-02-17|work=HuffPost UK|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier records of such surgery were either for medical purposes or to make a person fit in more easily with a certain social group. It was in the beginning of the 20th century that Hippolyte Morestin and Eugene Hollander started breast reduction (reduction mammoplasty) for beauty purposes only. By the 1930s though, breast reduction had majorly become more of aesthetic surgery than reconstructive surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Purohit|first=Shrirang|date=October 2008|title=Reduction mammoplasty|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2825129/|journal=Indian Journal of Plastic Surgery : Official Publication of the Association of Plastic Surgeons of India|volume=41|issue=Suppl|pages=S64–S79|issn=0970-0358|pmc=2825129|pmid=20174545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is still however used for medical purposes and female celebrities vocally getting such surgery has allowed for more to undertake it and speak up openly about it, a recent example of it being [[Ariel Winter|Ariel Winters]], who plays [[Alex Dunphy|Alex]] in [[Modern Family]], undergoing [[breast reduction]] [[surgery]] after years of back and neck pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11801066/Modern-Familys-Ariel-Winter-has-breast-reduction-surgery.html|title=Ariel Winter: Three bottles of wine strapped to your chest? No wonder breast reductions are on the rise|last=Sanghani|first=Radhika|date=2015-08-13|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Breast Cancer and Mammaplasty ==
Research has indicated that breast reduction surgery, for women who are at high risk for [[breast cancer]], may serve as an effective primary prevention strategy for tackling breast cancer and is not shown to increase chances of the breast cancer coming back or making it harder to check this through a [[Mammography screening|mammography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/reconstruction-fact-sheet#q9|title=Breast Reconstruction After Mastectomy|website=National Cancer Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to [[mastectomy]], therapeutic mammoplasty has emerged as way to address breast cancer in women with larger breasts and where early breast cancer is detected, this helps align with the cosmetic needs of the person in question and has positive health benefits as well.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ouh.nhs.uk/patient-guide/leaflets/files/5270Pmammaplasty.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A concern for breast cancer survivors can be the physical appearance of their breasts after the surgical procedures required to cure breast cancer in several cases. Reconstructive mammaplasty is breast reconstruction that is done after mastectomy to give the breasts an appearance that is more normal/familiar. Some factors that are considered before deciding whether such surgery would be apt are the size and shape of the breasts before operation, the amount of tissue remaining after the mastectomy, chance of the cancer returning, and what the mastectomy scar looks like and where it is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/mammaplasty|title=mammaplasty|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mammoplasty has also evolved as a way for women to address physical changes that mastectomy brings about to their bodies. Surgery to reconstruct the breasts can be started along with the mastectomy or after the body has healed from the mastectomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/reconstruction-fact-sheet|title=Breast Reconstruction After Mastectomy|website=National Cancer Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mammograms in general are not performed on reconstructed breasts that have had implants, it is recommended that a woman who has had a breast implant let the radiology technician know of it, before a mammogram, as special steps may be necessary for ensuring correct results and not causing harm to the implant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/reconstruction-fact-sheet#q9|title=Breast Reconstruction After Mastectomy|website=National Cancer Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10183">The '''National Occupational Research Agenda''' (NORA) is a partnership program developed by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH). The program was founded in 1996 to provide a framework for research collaborations among universities, large and small businesses, professional societies, government agencies, and worker organizations. Together these parties identify issues in the field of [[Occupational safety and health|workplace safety and health]] that require immediate attention based on the number of workers affected, the seriousness of the hazard, and the likelihood that new safety information and approaches can effect a change.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/NORA/ National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA)], National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Retrieved on 2008-08-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developing the first research agenda==

Dr. [[Linda Rosenstock]] was appointed director of NIOSH in 1994. At that time many saw the Institute as an agency that yielded strong scientific research, but needed stronger connections to the real-world workforce.&lt;ref name=ucla&gt;[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/magazine/winter2001.pdf "From Washington to Westwood: New Dean Brings Her Public Health Vision to UCLA"], ''UCLA School of Public Health Newsletter'' Volume 21, Number 1, Winter 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; To remedy this, Rosenstock sought to develop stronger relationships with other organizations and agencies. NIOSH moved its headquarters from [[Atlanta]] to [[Washington, D.C.]], where the Institute could enjoy closer contact with labor and industry representatives.&lt;ref name="washam"&gt;Washam, Cynthia. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1469368/pdf/envhper00336-0032-color.pdf "Working Toward a New NIOSH"], ''Environmental Health Perspectives'' Volume 104, Number 5, May 1996. Retrieved on 2008-08-12&lt;/ref&gt;  NIOSH's effort to build partnerships inside and outside of the government culminated in the development of the National Occupational Research Agenda. 

To form the agenda, NIOSH leaders petitioned stakeholders in industry, labor, and health care for input. Organizations including [[General Motors]], [[IBM]], [[Mobil]], the [[United Auto Workers]], and the [[American Public Health Association]] joined NIOSH in developing the agenda. NIOSH sought additional aid through a series of public town meetings held in [[Chicago]], [[Seattle]], and [[Boston]].&lt;ref name=washam/&gt; In total, nearly 500 organizations and individuals provided the input that resulted in the research agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenstock, Linda. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6VT3-3YVDPKC-6/2/6662a6ae1876f9bcc3adabd9778b53bf "Remarks of Dr. Linda Rosenstock, Howard-Fawcett award recipient"], ''Chemical Health and Safety'' Volume 7, Issue 2, March-April 2000, pages 7-9. Retrieved on 2007-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==NORA in practice==

NIOSH announced NORA's 21 priority research areas in 1996. On the strength of industry support and bipartisan backing, [[United States Congress|Congress]] increased funding for NIOSH and investment in NORA grew from $15.4 million in 1996 to $72.3 million in 1999.&lt;ref name=ucla/&gt; Following Rosenstock's resignation in 2000, Dr. John Howard continued to press and expand the NORA approach as NIOSH's new director.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, James. [http://www.occupationalhazards.com/News/Article/35587/John_Howard_Appointed_New_Director_of_NIOSH.aspx "John Howard Appointed New Director of NIOSH"], ''Occupational Hazards'' 2002-06-25. Retrieved on 2008-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Periodically, the structure of the program is evaluated and updated as needed. Since 1996, NORA's projects have covered topics such as [[slip and fall|slip, trip, and fall]] (STF) injuries; [[Green Tobacco Sickness|green tobacco sickness]]; extended work hours; [[latex allergy|latex allergies]]; vehicle and mobile equipment-related injury; [[silicon dioxide|silica]], [[lung cancer]], and [[respiratory disease]]; and biomechanical stress in drywall installation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nora/pastnora.html "Celebrating NORA, 1996-2006"], National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Retrieved on 2008-08-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== NORA's Research Organization: Sectors and Cross-Sectors ==
Since 2006, the program has been organized by industrial sector as defined in the [[North American Industry Classification System]]. NORA sector councils, which head the research for the sectors, help to implement the national research agenda.&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;"About Nora...Partnerships, Research, and Practice." [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nora/about.html NIOSH Website]. 10-21-08.&lt;/ref&gt; The accomplishments of the second decade of NORA are described in a [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2017-146/pdfs/2017-146.pdf report] published in 2017. NORA councils consists of participants from various backgrounds, affiliations and expertise, including stakeholders from universities, large and small businesses, professional associations, government agencies, and worker organizations.  Councils present the opportunity to maximize resources towards improved occupational safety and health nationwide. They help build close partnerships among members and broader collaborations between councils and other organizations. The resulting information sharing and leveraging efforts helps promote widespread adoption of improved workplace practices based on research results. The NORA industry sector councils for the 2016-2026 decade are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2007-118/ "The Nation's Investment in Occupational Safety and Health Research"], DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 2007-118.

===NORA priorities===
To aid with goal-setting, NORA uses specific guidelines to determine which research needs are priorities, by using use concepts of burden, need, and impact criteria to write research goals that go into NORA Sector and Cross-Sector Agendas. These guidelines basically address these aspects:&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;
*number of workers at risk for illness or injury
*severity of the hazard/issue
*probability that new information will help abate the hazard

== NORA results ==
Every ten years, NIOSH reviews the activities, outcomes, and impacts of work completed over the past NORA decade and completes a report of those accomplishments. The first decade report evaluated contributions from 1996-2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2006-121/|title=CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - NORA: The Team Document (2006-121)|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the second decade report reviewed activities from 2006-2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2017-146/|title=National Occupational Research Agenda: Second Decade in Review {{!}} 2006–2016|date=2017-07-18|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; NORA's third decade will occur from 2016-2026.

== NORA symposiums ==
To ensure a continued focus on the practical application of the research, NIOSH cosponsored NORA Symposiums in 1999, 2003, 2006, and 2008.   The 2008 NORA Symposium—"Public Market for Ideas and Partnerships"—was the first not held in the Washington, D.C., area. Instead it was hosted in [[Denver]], reflecting NIOSH's desire to expand occupational research collaborations in the Western United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ohsonline.com/Articles/2008/07/NORA-Symposium-to-Highlight-Safety-Research-Partnerships.aspx "NORA Symposium to Highlight Safety Research Partnerships"], ''Occupational Health &amp; Safety'' Magazine 2008-07-15.

}}The '''New Zealand Blood Service''' (abbrev: NZBS, in [[Māori language|te reo Māori]]: {{lang|mi|Te Ratonga Toto O Aotearoa}}) is the provider of blood services for [[New Zealand]].

NZBS is a Crown entity responsible to [[New Zealand Parliament|New Zealand’s Parliament]].

==History==
New Zealand Blood Service was formed on 1 July 1998, when the Health Amendment Act 1998 was passed by Parliament.  It became the appointed entity for all blood in New Zealand, holding responsibility for all blood from collection to distribution to clinician ('vein-to-vein' for blood), and for other controlled human tissues.

Approximately 29,000 New Zealanders need blood or blood products every year &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nzblood.co.nz/assets/About-NZBS/PDFs/NZBAD1002A-141485-Annual-Report-201516-WEB.pdf|title=New Zealand Blood Service Annual Report 2015/16|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 4% of New Zealanders donate.

==Duties==

New Zealand Blood Service has four key roles:

Blood collection, based on voluntary, unpaid donations;

Processing of [[blood donation]]s, by separating blood donations into [[blood component]]s;

Accreditation testing of blood donations, to minimise risk to the recipients of blood and blood products;

Blood Banking at hospital-based laboratories, where blood products are tested pre-transfusion and matched to each individual patient.

==Blood collection==

New Zealand Blood Service carefully plans and forecasts demand from hospitals and uses this to calculate the number of appointments and donations required for the week, based on blood type. Blood type is key, as donations are matched to the blood types of the patients being treated in hospitals.

Each year New Zealand Blood Service collects approximately 120,000 whole blood donations, 22,000 plasma donations and 18,000 units of platelets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

New Zealand Blood Service has nine Donor Centres around [[New Zealand]] and runs over 300 mobile blood drives each year. The Donor Centres are in [[Auckland]] (Epsom, Manukau and North Shore), [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], [[Tauranga]], [[Palmerston North]], [[Wellington]], [[Christchurch]] and [[Dunedin]]. Mobile blood drives take place in community halls, education centres and workplaces.

In order to minimise risk for recipients of blood and blood products, New Zealand Blood Service has detailed eligibility criteria in place for potential donors. These include a donor’s age, weight, health and travel history.

[[Whole blood]] donors can donate at a mobile blood drive or any of the nine Donor Centres. [[Plasmapheresis|Plasma]] and [[platelet]] donations require an [[apheresis]] machine and so can only be made at eight Donor Centres with these facilities (all except Manukau).

== Processing of blood donations ==
Blood donations are processed at four sites; Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch. These sites collectively process around 160,000 donations each year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Processing involves the separation of blood donations into blood components: red cells, platelets and plasma.

== Accreditation testing of blood donations ==
Accreditation testing is centralised in Auckland and Christchurch. Accreditation testing of all blood donations involves two distinct processes: [[Blood grouping and crossmatching|blood grouping]] and screening for infectious markers.

== Blood Banking ==
[[Blood bank|Blood Banks]] are the pre-transfusion testing laboratories where blood products are matched to suit each individual patient. This includes determining the patient's [[blood type]] and matching this with appropriate products.

Blood Banks are always located at the hospitals and are often staffed after hours to meet any urgent need for blood.

NZBS operates six Blood Banks in six cities from Auckland to Dunedin, and another 28 [[District health board|District Health Board]] (DHB) Blood Bank laboratories also perform pre-transfusion testing in line with defined quality standards.

In [[healthcare]], an '''orderly''' (also known as a '''ward assistant''', '''nurse assistant''' or '''healthcare assistant''') is a [[hospital]] attendant whose job consists of assisting medical and nursing staff with various nursing and medical interventions. The highest role of an orderly is that of an operations assistant. An operations assistant requires people of a higher caliber to be knowledgeable in advanced medical terminology and assisting with specialist surgery set ups, typically an operations assistant understands more about surgical procedures than that of a registered nurse working outside of theatres. An operations assistant is more of a direct assistant to consultant level doctors than that of nurses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/orderly|title=orderly Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These duties are classified as routine tasks involving no risk for the patient.

==Job details==
{{See also|Activities of daily living assistance}}{{Unreferenced|section|date=October 2017}}
Orderlies are often utilized in various hospital departments. Orderly duties can range in scope depending on the area of the health care facility they are employed. For that reason, duties can range from assisting in the physical restraint of combative patients, assisting physicians with the application of casts, transporting patients, shaving patients and providing other similar routine personal care to setting up specialised hospital equipment such as bed traction arrays.

Orderlies are typically found in emergency departments, operating rooms, psychiatry, long term care, and orthopaedics.

Orderlies are described as non licensed hospital assistants that are instructed to perform delegated functions under the direct supervision of a licensed practitioner in the health care setting. While the role of nursing has traditionally been filled by women, most orderlies are men, as they may be asked to assist nurses in physically demanding procedures.

In the US, orderlies have been phased out of health care facilities in recent years and their functions are now replaced by the [[patient care assistant]] and [[Certified Nursing Assistant]]. They remain common in Canada and other countries.

Orderlies in UK hospitals were known as "attendants" (primarily in [[lunatic asylum]]s), but that role has been phased out. The nearest role left to a male hospital assistant is that of porter, but that is more a logistical role, moving patients and equipment around the hospital. This is not to be confused with healthcare assistants (HCAs) who are essentially carers for patients (not qualified or licensed health care professionals), and may be of both sexes.

A common set up among hospitals in Australia is seen at the [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]] in [[Adelaide, South Australia]]. At the RAH the orderly service is contracted to [[Spotless (Australian business)|Spotless]], a national corporation. There are around 80 orderlies employed by Spotless at the Royal Adelaide alone. Here, they are tasked with the movement of patients and equipment between wards and departments, the movement of patients from ambulances in triage, the movement of patients from MedStar retrieval helicopters that land at the hospital, the movement of deceased patients to the [[mortuary]] and various other tasks. They respond to every MET (medical emergency team) call that originates within the hospital to provide extra oxygen and so that the patient is able to be moved to another area (such as the intensive care unit) as soon as is required. The orderlies are dispatched using pager-radio combos. Some orderlies are stationed at particular departments such as radiology and theatre/recovery but most are in the "pool" and are dispatched throughout the hospital. In The Royal Brisbane and Womans Hospital in Queensland, orderlies are called patient support officers or PSOs. Controversially, PSOs are required to do all cleaning within the hospital, leading to an outcry from staff that the practice is unsafe because PSOs have to not only clean, but also take care of the patient handling, leading to a possible increase in the spread of infection.

In Canada, orderlies are called Nursing assistants, PCA (personal care attendants), PSW (personal support workers) and health care aids (HCA).

'''Overgrowth syndromes''' in children constitute a group of rare disorders that are typical of tissue hypertrophy. Individual overgrowth syndromes have been shown to overlap with regard to clinical and radiologic features. The details of the genetic bases of these syndromes are unfolding. Any of the three embryonic tissue layers may be involved.The syndromes may manifest in localized or generalized tissue overgrowth. Latitudinal and longitudinal growth may be affected.&lt;ref&gt;Ko JM (2013). [https://synapse.koreamed.org/DOIx.php?id=10.6065/apem.2013.18.3.101 "Genetic syndromes associated with overgrowth in childhood"]. ''Ann Pediatr Endocrinol Metab''.

'''2014''':947451. {{doi|10.1155/2014/947451}}. {{PMC|4070411}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, the musculoskeletal features are central to the diagnosis of some syndromes such as [[Proteus syndrome]].&lt;ref name=elsobky2015&gt;EL-Sobky TA, Elsayed SM, EL Mikkawy DME (2015). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352187215300164 "Orthopaedic manifestations of Proteus syndrome in a child with literature update"]. ''Bone Rep''. '''3''':104-108. {{doi|10.1016/j.bonr.2015.09.004}}. {{PMC|5365241}}. {{PMID|28377973}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The time of presentation of children with overgrowth syndromes is an important contributor to the differential diagnosis. Children with some overgrowth syndromes such as Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome can be readily detectable at birth.&lt;ref name=Lacerda2014/&gt; In contrast other overgrowth syndromes such as [[Proteus syndrome]] usually present in the postnatal period characteristically between the 2nd and 3rd year of life.&lt;ref name= elsobky2015/&gt; In general, children with overgrowth syndromes are at increased risk of embryonic tumor development.

Examples of overgrowth syndromes include:
* [[Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome]]
* [[Proteus syndrome]]
* [[Sotos syndrome]]
* [[Neurofibromatosis]]
* [[Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome]]
* [[Weaver syndrome]]
* [[Sturge–Weber syndrome]]

The activation process of these enzymes includes the removal of propeptide regions, which serve a variety of functions ''in vivo'' and ''in vitro''. The pro-region is required for the proper folding of the newly synthesised enzyme, the inactivation of the peptidase domain and stabilisation of the enzyme against denaturing at neutral to alkaline pH conditions. Amino acid residues within the pro-region mediate their membrane association, and play a role in the transport of the proenzyme to lysosomes. Among the most notable features of propeptides is their ability to inhibit the activity of their cognate enzymes and that certain propeptides exhibit high selectivity for inhibition of the peptidases from which they originate.&lt;ref name="PUB00015451"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamamoto Y, Takahashi SY, Kurata M, Watabe S, Murakami R |title=Novel cysteine proteinase inhibitors homologous to the proregions of cysteine proteinases |journal=Curr Protein Pept Sci |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=231–238 |year=2002 |pmid=12188906 |doi=10.2174/1389203024605331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The papain precursor protein contains 345 amino acid residues,&lt;ref name="urlPapain precursor - Carica papaya (Papaya)"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P00784 | title = UniProt P00784: Papain precursor - Carica papaya (Papaya) | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = | format = | work = | publisher = UniProtKB | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and consists of a signal sequence (1-18), a [[propeptide]] (19-133) and the mature peptide (134-345). The amino acid numbers are based on the mature peptide. The protein is stabilised by three [[disulfide bond|disulfide bridges]]. Its three-dimensional structure consists of two distinct [[structural domain]]s with a cleft between them. This cleft contains the [[active site]], which contains a catalytic diad that has been likened to the [[catalytic triad]] of [[chymotrypsin]]. The catalytic triad is made up of the amino acids - cysteine-25 (from which it gets its classification) and histidine-159. Aspartate-158 was thought to play a role analogous to the role of aspartate in the [[serine protease]] catalytic triad, but that has since been disproved.&lt;ref name="pmid2397208"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ménard R, Khouri HE, Plouffe C, Dupras R, Ripoll D, Vernet T, Tessier DC, Lalberté F, Thomas DY, Storer AC | title = A protein engineering study of the role of aspartate 158 in the catalytic mechanism of papain | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 29 | issue = 28 | pages = 6706–13 |date=July 1990 | pmid = 2397208 | doi = 10.1021/bi00480a021}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Function==
{{see also|Catalytic triad}}
The mechanism by which papain breaks [[peptide bond]]s involves the use of a [[catalytic triad]] with a deprotonated cysteine. Asn-175 helps to orient the [[imidazole]] ring of His-159 to allow it to deprotonate the catalytic Cys-25. This cysteine then performs a [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]] attack on the carbonyl carbon of a peptide backbone. This forms a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate and frees the amino terminus of the peptide. The enzyme is deacylated by a water molecule and releases the carboxy terminal portion of the peptide. In immunology, papain is known to cleave the Fc (crystallisable) portion of [[immunoglobulins]] (antibodies) from the Fab (antigen-binding) portion.

Papain is a relatively heat-resistant enzyme, with an optimal temperature range of 60 and 70&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biozym.de/datasheets/papain.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Papain prefers to cleave at: (hydrophobic)-([[arginine|Arg]] or [[lysine|Lys]])- cleaves here -(not [[valine|Val]]). Hydrophobic is [[alanine|Ala]], [[valine|Val]], [[leucine|Leu]], [[isoleucine|Ile]], [[phenylalanine|Phe]], [[tryptophan|Trp]], or [[tyrosine|Tyr]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/life-science/biochemicals/biochemical-products.html?TablePage=16410606&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Anthelmintic effect of papain on Heligmosomoides bakeri.ogv|thumb|[[Anthelmintic]] effect of papain on the worm ''[[Heligmosomoides bakeri]]''.]]
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2014}}
Papain breaks down tough meat fibres, and has been used for thousands of years to tenderise meat eaten in its native South America. Meat tenderisers in powder form with papain as an active component are widely sold.

Papain can be used to dissociate cells in the first step of [[cell culture]] preparations. A ten-minute treatment of small tissue pieces (less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm cubed) will allow papain to begin cleaving the extracellular matrix molecules holding the cells together. After ten minutes, the tissue should be treated with a protease inhibitor solution to stop the protease action. Left untreated, papain activity will lead to complete lysis of the cells. The tissue must then be triturated (passed quickly up and down through a [[Pasteur pipette]]) to break up the pieces of tissue into a single cell suspension.

It is also used as an ingredient in various [[enzyme|enzymatic]] [[debridement|debriding]] preparations, notably [[Accuzyme]]. These are used in the care of some chronic wounds to clean up dead tissue.

Papain is added to some toothpastes and mint sweets as a tooth whitener. Its whitening effect is, however, minimal because the papain is present in low concentrations and is quickly diluted by saliva. It would take several months of use to have a noticeable effect.&lt;ref name="pmid23493413"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chakravarthy P, Acharya S | title = Efficacy of extrinsic stain removal by novel dentifrice containing papain and bromelain extracts | journal = J Young Pharm | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 245–9 |date=October 2012 | pmid = 23493413 | pmc = 3573376 | doi = 10.4103/0975-1483.104368 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papain is the main ingredient of Papacarie, a gel used for chemomechanical [[dental caries]] removal. It does not require [[Dental drill|drilling]] and does not interfere in the bond strength of restorative materials to [[dentin]].&lt;ref name="pmid18477426"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lopes MC, Mascarini RC, da Silva BM, Flório FM, Basting RT | title = Effect of a papain-based gel for chemomechanical caries removal on dentin shear bond strength | journal = J Dent Child (Chic) | volume = 74 | issue = 2 | pages = 93–7 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18477426 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papain has been known to interfere with urine [[Psychoactive drug#Recreational use|drug]] tests for [[cannabinoid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Section of Toxicology, Department of Pharmacology |author2 = James H. Quillen College of Medicine, East Tennessee State University |location = Johnson City, 37614, USA. | title = Papain: a novel urine adulterant}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is found in some drug detox products.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that papain can be used to assemble thin films of [[titanium dioxide|titania]] used in [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic cells]].&lt;ref name="doi:10.1039/C8TB00381E"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bawazer LA, Ihli J, Levenstein MA, Jeuken LC, Meldrum FC, McMillan DG | title = Enzymatically-controlled biomimetic synthesis of titania/protein hybrid thin films | journal = J Mater Chem B | volume = 6 | issue = 23 | pages = 3979-3988 | year = 2018 | pmid = | doi = 10.1039/C8TB00381E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immunoglobulins==
[[File:2fab fc.svg|thumb|The papain-digested antibody: two [[Fab fragment]]s and an [[Fc fragment]].]]
An [[antibody]] digested by papain yields three fragments: two 50 kDa [[Fab fragment]]s and one 50kDa [[Fc fragment]].  The papain-digested antibody is unable to promote [[agglutination (biology)|agglutination]], [[protein precipitation|precipitation]], [[opsonization]], and [[lysis]].

==Production==
Papain is usually produced as a crude, dried material by collecting the [[latex]] from the fruit of the papaya tree. The latex is collected after scoring the neck of the fruit, where it may either dry on the fruit or drip into a container. This latex is then further dried. It is now classified as a dried, crude material. A purification step is necessary to remove contaminating substances. This purification consists of the solubilization and extraction of the active papain enzyme system through a government-registered process. This purified papain may be supplied as powder or as liquid.

== US restrictions on marketing ==
{{See also|Proteases (medical and related uses)}}

On September 23, 2008, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) warned companies to stop marketing [[Human eye|ophthalmic]] balanced salt solutions and topical drug products containing papain by November 4, 2008. The FDA said, "Papain-containing drug products in topical form historically have been marketed without approval...".&lt;ref name="urlwww.fda.gov"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98fr/FDA-2008-N-0481-n.pdf | title = Topical Drug Products Containing Papain; Enforcement Action Dates | author = Shuren J | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2008-09-22 | format = | work = | publisher = United States Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health and Human Services | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the FDA's statement on the subject, "These unapproved products have put consumers' health in jeopardy, from reports of permanent vision loss with unapproved balanced salt solutions to a serious drop in blood pressure and increased heart rate from the topical papain products," said [[Janet Woodcock]], M.D., director for the [[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research]].

===Unapproved topical papain products===
Topical drug ointments containing papain are used to remove dead or contaminated tissue in acute and chronic lesions, such as diabetic ulcers, pressure ulcers, varicose ulcers, and traumatic infected wounds. Trade names for these products include Accuzyme, Allanfil, Allanzyme, Ethezyme, Gladase, Kovia, Panafil, Pap Urea, and Ziox. Other products are marketed under the names of the active ingredients, for instance, papain-urea ointment.

In 2008 the FDA announced its intention to take action against these products because it had received reports of serious adverse events in patients using products containing papain. Reports included hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions that lead to hypotension (low blood pressure) and tachycardia (rapid heart rate). In addition, people allergic to latex can also be allergic to papaya, the source of papain, implying that people with latex sensitivity may be at increased risk of suffering an adverse reaction to a topical papain drug product.

FDA recommended that people with concerns about using topical papain preparations contact their health care provider about discontinuing use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3655">'''Partner services''' is a [[public health]] term which refers to the [[health intervention]] given to a client's intimate partners when a client goes to a [[health care provider]] requesting [[health care]].  

'''[[Partner notification]]''' is a type of partner service, wherein if someone has a [[contagious disease]], the health care provider finding the problem will try to notify that person's partners that they have been exposed to infection. It is a form of [[contact tracing]].

Partner services are important because in some cases a person's health problems are partially caused or sustained by other people.  A common example would be that a person visits a doctor because he has an [[infectious disease]].  If that disease is also contagious, then that person's close associates may also have the disease.  If a [[physician]] were to only treat the person who initially requests treatment, then the disease may remain in the community.  Instead, principles of partner services dictate that health care should treat all members of a group which transmits infection.

==Examples==

Partner services are frequently discussed in the treatment of [[sexually transmitted infections]] (STI).  If one person has a sexually transmitted infection, then any sexual partner that person has is at risk to get that infection.  A common practice after identifying a person who has an STI is to ask that person to identify any sexual partners so that the clinic can contact them and arrange for them to receive STI testing, treatment, and counseling.

Another example is the case in which two people are in an [[intimate relationship]], such as a marriage.  One partner may be dissatisfied with the relationship and seek counseling.  In this case, the counselor may advise that if the other partner in the relationship does not also participate in counseling then improvement in the relationship might be difficult.  In this case, the counselor would assist the person making the complaint in arranging partner services.

==List of conditions for which partner services are often used==

Public health offices are often directed to offer partner services for sexually transmitted infections, including the following: 
*[[HIV]]
*[[syphilis]]
*[[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]]
*[[gonorrhea]]
*[[hepatitis A]]
*[[hepatitis B]]

[[Mental health professionals]] often recommend partner services when clients express interest in treatment for many problems, including the following:
*[[substance abuse]], including [[alcoholism]]
*[[Relationship counseling]]
*[[Depression (mood)|depression]]
*and many [[List of mental disorders as defined by the DSM and ICD|other mental disorders]]

The intention is that often a person will benefit from the support of close friends, family, and significant others when getting treatment for a mental problem.

==Benefits==
Partner services help the original client have better health, and improve the health of that client's close associates, and benefit the community by relieving the burden of retaining an infectious reservoir of endemic health problems.&lt;ref name=cdc_fact&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr57e1030a1.htm |title=Recommendations for Partner Services Programs for HIV Infection, Syphilis, Gonorrhea, and Chlamydial Infection |first=Samuel W. |last=Dooley |work=cdc.gov |date=30 October 2008 |publisher=[[DAIDS]] |accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pharmacognosy''' is the study of medicinal drugs derived from plants or other natural sources. The [[American Society of Pharmacognosy]] defines pharmacognosy as "the study of the physical, chemical, [[Biochemistry|biochemical]] and biological properties of drugs, drug substances or potential drugs or drug substances of natural origin as well as the [[Drug discovery|search for new drugs]] from natural sources".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19981201075709/http://www.phcog.org/definition.html The American Society of Pharmacognosy]&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also defined as the study of crude drugs.

==Introduction==
The word "pharmacognosy" is derived from two [[Greek language|Greek]] words: ''φάρμακον'' pharmakon ([[drug]]), and γνῶσις ''[[gnosis]]'' ([[knowledge]]). The term "pharmacognosy" was used for the first time by the Austrian physician Schmidt in 1811 and 1815 by Crr. Anotheus Seydler in  work titled  ''Analecta Pharmacognostica''.

Originally—during the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century—"pharmacognosy" was used to define the branch of [[medicine]] or commodity sciences (''Warenkunde'' in German) which deals with [[drug]]s in their crude, or unprepared, form. [[Crude drugs]] are the dried, unprepared material of plant, animal or mineral origin, used for medicine. The study of these materials under the name ''pharmakognosie'' was first developed in German-speaking areas of Europe, while other language areas often used the older term ''materia medica'' taken from the works of [[Galen]] and [[Dioscorides]]. In German the term ''drogenkunde'' ("science of crude drugs") is also used synonymously.

As late as the beginning of the 20th century, the subject had developed mainly on the botanical side, being particularly concerned with the description and identification of drugs both in their whole state and in powder form. Such branches of pharmacognosy are still of fundamental importance, particularly for pharmacopoeial identification and quality control purposes, but rapid development in other areas has enormously expanded the subject. The advent of the 21st century brought a renaissance of pharmacognosy and its conventional botanical approach has been broadened up to molecular and metabolomic level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dhami, N.|year=2013|title=Trends in Pharmacognosy: A modern science of natural medicines|journal=Journal of Herbal Medicine|volume=3|issue=4|pages=123–131|doi=10.1016/j.hermed.2013.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most pharmacognostic studies focus on plants and medicines derived from plants, other types of organisms are also regarded as pharmacognostically interesting, in particular, various types of microbes (bacteria, fungi, etc.), and, recently, various marine organisms.

In addition to the previously mentioned definition, the [[American Society of Pharmacognosy]] also defines pharmacognosy as "the study of natural product molecules (typically secondary metabolites) that are useful for their medicinal, ecological, gustatory, or other functional properties."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pharmacognosy.us/what-is-pharmacognosy/ |title=About the ASP |publisher=American Society of Pharmacognosy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other definitions are more encompassing, drawing on a broad spectrum of biological subjects, including [[botany]], [[ethnobotany]], [[marine biology]], [[microbiology]], [[herbal medicine]], [[chemistry]], [[biotechnology]], [[phytochemistry]], [[pharmacology]], [[pharmaceutics]], clinical [[pharmacy]] and [[pharmacy practice]].

* medical [[ethnobotany]]: the study of the traditional use of plants for medicinal purposes;
*[[ethnopharmacology]]: the study of the pharmacological qualities of traditional medicinal substances;
* the study of [[phytotherapy]] (the medicinal use of plant extracts); and
*[[phytochemistry]], the study of chemicals derived from plants (including the identification of new drug candidates derived from plant sources).
*[[zoopharmacognosy]], the process by which animals self-medicate, by selecting and using plants, soils, and insects to treat and prevent disease.
*[[marine pharmacognosy]], the study of chemicals derived from marine organisms.

At the 9th congress of Italian society of pharmacognosy it was stated that current return of phyto-therapy was clearly reflected by the increased market of such products. In 1998 the latest figures available for Europe, the total OTC market for herbal medicinal products reached a figure of $6 billion, with consumption for Germany of $2.5 billion, France $1.6 billion and Italy $600 million. In the US, where the use of herbal products has never been as prevalent as in continental Europe, the market for all herb sales reached a peak in 1998 of $700 billion.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} This welcomed the scientific investigation of a rigorous nature.

The plant kingdom still holds many species of plants containing substances of medicinal value which have yet to be discovered. Large numbers of plants are constantly being screened for their possible pharmacological value.

==Biological background==
[[File:Primula aka.jpg|right|thumb|The [[carotenoids]] in [[Primulaceae|primrose]] produce bright red, yellow and orange shades. On average, people consuming diets rich in carotenoids from [[natural foods]], such as fruits and vegetables, are healthier and have lower mortality from a number of [[chronic illnesses]]]]
All plants produce [[chemical compounds]] as part of their normal [[metabolism|metabolic]] activities. These [[phytochemicals]] are divided into (1) [[primary metabolites]] such as [[sugar]]s and [[fat]]s, which are found in all plants; and (2) [[secondary metabolites]]—compounds which are found in a smaller range of plants, serving a more specific function.&lt;ref name="meskin-2002-p123"&gt;{{cite book|author=Meskin, Mark S.|title=Phytochemicals in Nutrition and Health|publisher=CRC Press|year=2002|isbn=9781587160837|page=123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cJHsMALUDj0C&amp;pg=PA123}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some secondary metabolites are [[toxin]]s used to [[Plant defense against herbivory|deter predation]] and others are [[pheromone]]s used to attract insects for [[pollination]]. It is these secondary metabolites and pigments that can have therapeutic actions in humans and which can be refined to produce drugs—examples are [[inulin]] from the roots of [[dahlia]]s, [[quinine]] from the [[cinchona]], [[THC]] and [[Cannabidiol|CBD]] from the flowers of [[cannabis]], [[morphine]] and [[codeine]] from the [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]], and [[digoxin]] from the [[digitalis|foxglove]].&lt;ref name="meskin-2002-p123" /&gt;

Plants synthesize a bewildering variety of [[phytochemical]]s but most are derivatives of a few biochemical motifs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Springbob, Karen &amp; Kutchan, Toni M.|chapter=Introduction to the different classes of natural products|editor=Lanzotti, Virginia|title=Plant-Derived Natural Products: Synthesis, Function, and Application|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=9780387854977|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8SpVXEng4QC&amp;pg=PA3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Alkaloids]] are a class of chemical compounds containing a nitrogen ring. Alkaloids are produced by a large variety of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, and are part of the group of natural products (also called secondary metabolites). Many alkaloids can be purified from crude extracts by acid-base extraction. Many alkaloids are toxic to other organisms. They often have pharmacological effects and are used as medications, as recreational drugs, or in entheogenic rituals. Examples are the local anesthetic and stimulant cocaine; the psychedelic psilocin; the stimulant caffeine; nicotine; the analgesic morphine; the antibacterial berberine; the anticancer compound vincristine; the antihypertension agent reserpine; the cholinomimetic galantamine; the spasmolysis agent atropine; the vasodilator vincamine; the anti-arrhythmia compound quinidine; the anti-asthma therapeutic ephedrine; and the antimalarial drug quinine. Although alkaloids act on a diversity of metabolic systems in humans and other animals, they almost uniformly invoke a bitter taste.
*[[Polyphenol]]s (also known as phenolics) are compounds that contain [[phenol]] rings. The [[anthocyanin]]s that give grapes their purple color, the [[isoflavone]]s, the [[phytoestrogen]]s from [[soy]] and the [[tannin]]s that give tea its astringency are phenolics.
*[[Glycosides]] are molecules in which a sugar is bound to a non-carbohydrate moiety, usually a small organic molecule. Glycosides play numerous important roles in living organisms. Many plants store chemicals in the form of inactive glycosides. These can be activated by enzyme hydrolysis, which causes the sugar part to be broken off, making the chemical available for use. Many such plant glycosides are used as medications. In animals and humans, poisons are often bound to sugar molecules as part of their elimination from the body. An example is the cyanoglycosides in cherry pits that release toxins only when bitten by a [[herbivore]].
* [[Terpenes]] are a large and diverse class of [[organic compounds]], produced by a variety of plants, particularly [[conifers]], which are often strong smelling and thus may have had a protective function. They are the major components of [[resin]], and of [[turpentine]] produced from resin. (The name "terpene" is derived from the word "turpentine"). Terpenes are major biosynthetic building blocks within nearly every living creature. Steroids, for example, are derivatives of the triterpene squalene. When terpenes are modified chemically, such as by oxidation or rearrangement of the carbon skeleton, the resulting compounds are generally referred to as ''[[terpenoids]]''. Terpenes and terpenoids are the primary constituents of the essential oils of many types of plants and flowers. Essential oils are used widely as natural flavor additives for food, as fragrances in perfumery, and in traditional and alternative medicines such as aromatherapy. Synthetic variations and derivatives of natural terpenes and terpenoids also greatly expand the variety of aromas used in perfumery and flavors used in food additives. [[Vitamin A]] is an example of a terpene. The fragrance of [[rose]] and [[lavender]] is due to [[monoterpene]]s. The [[carotenoid]]s  produce the reds, yellows and oranges of [[pumpkin]], [[Maize|corn]] and [[tomato]]es.

A consortium of plant molecular researchers at [[Washington State University]], the [[Donald Danforth Plant Science Center]], the [[National Center for Genome Resources]], and the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] began an NIH-sponsored study of over thirty medicinal plant species late 2009. The initial work, to develop a sequence reference for the [[transcriptome]] of each, has led to the development of the Medicinal Plant Transcriptomics Database.

==Issues in phytotherapy==
The part of pharmacognosy focusing on the use of crude extracts or semi-pure mixtures originating from nature, namely phytotherapy, is probably the best known and also the most debated area in pharmacognosy. Although phytotherapy is sometimes considered as [[alternative medicine]], when critically conducted, it can be considered the scientific study on the effects and clinical use of herbal medicines. Consequently, herbal products might also become officially approved for clinical application as [[botanical drug]]s (e.g., Veregen (sinecatechins), a [[green tea]] leaves extract, approved for use by [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|vauthors=Tang TY, Li FZ, Afseth J|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11655-014-2024-y|title=Review of the regulations for clinical research in herbal medicines in USA|journal=Chin J Integr Med.|date=2014 Dec|volume=20|issue=12|pages=883-93|doi=10.1007/s11655-014-2024-y|pmid=25428336|via=PubMed|type=Review}} Epub 2014 Nov 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constituents and drug synergism===
One characteristic of crude drug material is that constituents may have an opposite, moderating or enhancing effect. Hence, the final effect of any crude drug material will be a product of the interactions between the constituents and the effect of each constituent on its own. To effectively study the existence and effect of such interactions, scientific studies must examine the effect that multiple constituents, given concurrently, have on the system. Herbalists assert that as phytopharmaceuticals rely upon [[synergy#drug synergism|synergy]] for their activities, plants with high levels of active constituents like [[ginsenosides]] or [[hypericin]] may not correlate with the strength of the herbs. In phytopharmaceuticals or [[herbal medicine]], the therapeutic effects of herbs cannot be determined unless its active ingredient or [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] are identified or the herb is administered as a whole. One way to indicate strength is [[standardization]] to one or several [[Biomarker|marker]] compound that are believed to be mainly responsible for the biological effects. However, many herbalists believe that the active ingredient in a plant is the plant itself.&lt;ref&gt;1992, ''American Herbalism'' edited by [[Michael Tierra]] Crossings Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herb and drug interactions===
{{main|Herb-drug interactions}}
A study of herb drug interactions indicated that the vast majority of drug interactions occurred in four classes of drugs, the chief class being blood thinners, but also including [[protease inhibitors]], [[cardiac glycosides]] and the immuno-suppressant [[ciclosporin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butterweck|last2=Derendorf|displayauthors=etal|title=Pharmacokinetic Herb-Drug Interactions: Are Preventive Screenings Necessary and Appropriate?|journal=Planta Medica|year=2004|volume=70|issue=9|pages=784–791|url=https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-2004-827223|doi=10.1055/s-2004-827223|pmid=15386186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural products chemistry===
[[File:Digoxin.svg|thumb|right|[[Digoxin]] is a purified [[cardiac glycoside]] that is extracted from the [[foxglove]] plant, ''[[Digitalis lanata]]''. Digoxin is widely used in the treatment of various heart conditions, namely [[atrial fibrillation]], [[atrial flutter]] and sometimes [[heart failure]] that cannot be controlled by other medication.]]

Most bioactive compounds of natural origin are secondary metabolites, i.e., species-specific chemical agents that can be grouped into various categories.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} A typical protocol to isolate a pure chemical agent from natural origin is bioassay-guided fractionation, meaning step-by-step separation of extracted components based on differences in their physicochemical properties, and assessing the biological activity, followed by next round of separation and assaying. Typically, such work is initiated after a given crude drug formulation (typically prepared by solvent extraction of the natural material) is deemed "active" in a particular ''in vitro'' assay. If the end-goal of the work at hand is to identify which one(s) of the scores or hundreds of compounds are responsible for the observed ''in vitro'' activity, the path to that end is fairly straightforward:
# fractionate the crude extract, e.g. by solvent partitioning or chromatography.
# test the fractions thereby generated with ''in vitro'' assay.
# repeat steps 1) and 2) until pure, active compounds are obtained.
# determine structure(s) of active compound(s), typically by using spectroscopic methods.
''In vitro'' activity does not necessarily translate to activity in humans or other living systems.

The most common means for fractionation are solvent-solvent partitioning and chromatographic techniques such as [[high-performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC), medium-pressure liquid chromatography, "flash" chromatography, open-column chromatography, vacuum-liquid chromatography (VLC), [[thin-layer chromatography]] (TLC), with each technique being most appropriate for a given amount of starting material. Countercurrent chromatography (CCC) is particularly well-suited for bioassay-guided fractionation because, as an all-liquid separation technique, concern about irreversible loss or denaturation of active sample components is minimized. After isolation of a pure substance, the task of elucidating its chemical structure can be addressed. For this purpose, the most powerful methodologies available are [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] (NMR) and [[mass spectrometry]] (MS).{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} In the case of drug discovery efforts, structure elucidation of all components that are active ''in vitro'' is typically the end goal. In the case of phytotherapy research, the investigator may use ''in vitro'' BAGF as a tool to identify pharmacologically interesting or important components of the crude drug. The work does not stop after structural identification of ''in vitro'' actives, however. The task of "dissecting and reassembling" the crude drug one active component at a time, in order to achieve a mechanistic understanding of how it works in phytotherapy, is quite daunting. This is because it is simply too difficult, from cost, time, regulatory, and even scientific perspectives, to study experimental fractions of the crude drug in humans.  ''In vitro'' assays are therefore used to identify chemical components of the crude drug that may rationally be expected to have a given pharmacological effect in humans, and to provide a rational basis for standardization of a crude drug formulation to be tested in [and sold/marketed to] humans.

Farnsworth for example, has found that 25% of all prescriptions dispensed from community pharmacies in the United States from 1959 to 1980 contained active ingredients extracted from higher plants. In some countries in Asia and Africa 80% of the population relies on [[traditional medicine]] (including [[herbal medicine]]) for primary health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Traditional Medicine|publisher=World Health Organization web site|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs134/en/index.html|accessdate=2009-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Native American cultures have also relied on traditional medicine such as ceremonial smoking of tobacco, potlatch ceremonies, and herbalism, to name a few, prior to European colonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Botanists and pharmacologists are racing to learn these ancient practices, {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} which, like the forest plants they employ, are also endangered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Farnsworth, NR|chapter=The role of ethnopharmacology in drug development|editor=Anonymous|title=Bioactive Compounds from Plants|series=Ciba Foundation Symposium 154|publisher=Wiley Interscience|location=New York|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Farnsworth, NR|chapter=Screening plants for new medicines|veditors= Wilson EO, Peters FM|title=Biodiversity|location=Washington DC|publisher=National Academy Press|year=1988|pages=83–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Balick, MJ|chapter=Ethnobotany and the identification of therapeutic agents from the rainforest|editor=Anonymous|title=Bioactive Compounds|series=Ciba Foundation Symposium 154|publisher=Wiley Interscience|location=New York|year=1990|pages=22–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some species loss is [[habitat loss|habitat lost]] due to introduction of [[invasive species]] such ([[kudzu]], [[Japanese knotweed]], [[mimosa]], [[lonicera]], [[St. Johnswort]] and [[purple loosestrife]]) which themselves have medicinal uses.

Species [[extinction]] is not only due to habitat loss. [[Overharvesting]] of medicinal species of plants and animals also contributes to species loss. This is particularly notable in the matter of [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] where [[crude drugs]] of plant and animal origin are used with increasing demand. People with a stake in TCM often seek chemical and biological alternatives to endangered species because they realize that plants and animals lost from the wild are also lost to medicine forever but different cultural attitudes bedevil conservation efforts .{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Still conservation is not a new idea: Chinese advice against [[overexploitation]] of natural medicinal species dates from at least [[Mencius]], a philosopher living in the 4th century BC.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Cooperation between Western conservationists and practitioners have been beset by cultural difficulties. Westerners may emphasise urgency in matters of conservation, while Chinese may wish for the products used in TCM to remain publicly available. One repeated fallacy{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} is that [[rhinoceros]] horn is used as an aphrodisiac in TCM. It is, in fact, prescribed for fevers and convulsions by TCM practitioners. There are no peer-reviewed studies showing that this treatment is effective.&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Herbal Medicine: Materia Medica, Third Edition by Dan Bensky, Steven Clavey, Erich Stoger, and Andrew Gamble. September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 representatives of the oriental medicine communities in Asia met with conservationists at a symposium in Hong Kong, organized by [[TRAFFIC]]. The two groups established a clear willingness to cooperate through dialogue and mutual understanding. This has led to several meetings, including the 1997 First International Symposium on [[Endangered Species]] Used in Traditional East Asian Medicine, where China was among 136 nations to sign a formal resolution recognizing that the uncontrolled use of wild species in traditional medicine threatens their survival and the continuation of these medical practices. The resolution, drawn up by the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ([[CITES]]), aims to initiate new partnerships in conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://seahorse.fisheries.ubc.ca/pdfs/parryjones_and_vincent1998_newscientist.html|title=Can we tame wild medicine?

===Sustainable sources of plant and animal drugs===

As species face [[loss of habitat]] or [[overharvesting]], there have been new issues to deal with in sourcing crude drugs. These include changes to the herb from farming practices, substitution of species or other plants altogether, [[adulteration]] and [[cross-pollination]] issues.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} For instance, ginseng which is field farmed may have significant problems with fungus, making contamination with fungicides an issue. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} This may be remedied with woods grown programs, but they are insufficient to produce enough ginseng to meet demand. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The wildcrafted [[echinacea]], [[black cohosh]] and [[American ginseng]] often rely upon old growth root, often in excess of 50 years of age and it is not clear that younger stock will have the same pharmaceutical effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.rrreading.com/files/Life%20Span%20of%20Medicinal%20Plants.pdf |contribution=Life Span of Medicinal Plants |last=Klein |first=Robyn |title=Planting the Future: Saving Our Medicinal Herbs|year=2000 |publisher=Healing Arts Press|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017061138/http://www.rrreading.com/files/Life%20Span%20of%20Medicinal%20Plants.pdf|archivedate= October 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Black cohosh may be adulterated with the related Chinese [[Actaea (plant)|actea species]], which is not the same. Ginseng may be replaced by ginseniodes from [[Jiaogulan]] which has been stated to have a different effect than the full [[panax]] root.&lt;ref&gt;Jialiu Liu and Michael Blumert.  ''Jiaogulan''. Torchlight Publishing. 1999,&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem may be exacerbated by the growth of pills and capsules as the preferred method of ingesting medication as they are cheaper and more available than traditional, individually tailored prescriptions of raw medicinals but the contents are harder to track. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Seahorses]] are a case in point: Seahorses once had to be of a certain size and quality before they were accepted by practitioners and consumers. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} But declining availability of the preferred large, pale and smooth seahorses has been offset by the shift towards prepackaged medicines, which make it possible for TCM merchants to sell previously unused juvenile, spiny and dark-coloured animals. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Today almost a third of the seahorses sold in China are prepackaged.
&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://seahorse.fisheries.ubc.ca/pdfs/parryjones_and_vincent1998_newscientist.html Project Seahorse | Can we tame wild medicine?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015002358/http://seahorse.fisheries.ubc.ca/pdfs/parryjones_and_vincent1998_newscientist.html |date=2007-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The farming of plant or animal species for medicinal purposes has caused difficulties. Rob Parry Jones and [[Amanda Vincent]] write:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*One solution is to farm medicinal animals and plants. Chinese officials have promoted this as a way of guaranteeing supplies as well as protecting endangered species. And there have been some successes—notably with plant species, such as American ginseng—which is used as a general tonic and for chronic coughs. [[Red deer]], too, have for centuries been farmed for their [[antlers]], which are used to treat impotence and general fatigue. But growing your own is not a universal panacea. Some plants grow so slowly that cultivation in not economically viable. Animals such as [[musk deer]] may be difficult to farm, and so generate little profit. [[Seahorses]] are difficult to feed and plagued by disease in captivity. Other species cannot be cultivated at all. Even when it works, farming usually fails to match the scale of demand. Overall, cultivated TCM plants in China supply less than 20 per cent of the required 1.6 million tonnes per annum. Similarly, China's demand for animal products such as musk and [[pangolin]] scales far exceeds supply from captive-bred sources.
*Farming alone can never resolve conservation concerns, as government authorities and those who use Chinese medicine realise. For a start, consumers often prefer ingredients taken from the wild, believing them to be more potent. This is reflected in the price, with wild oriental ginseng fetching up to 32 times as much as cultivated plants. Then there are welfare concerns. [[Bear farming]] in [[China]] is particularly controversial. Around 7600 captive bears have their bile "milked" through tubes inserted into their [[gall bladders]]. [[World Animal Protection]] states that bear bile farming "causes intense, unjustified suffering to bears".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldanimalprotection.org/our-work/animals-wild/ending-bear-bile-industry Ending the bear bile industry], [[World Animal Protection]]. Retrieved 2014-06-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese officials state that 10,000 wild bears would need to be killed each year to produce as much bile, making bear farming the more desirable option. World Animal Protection, however, states that "it is commonly believed in China that the bile from a wild bear is the most potent, and so farming bears for their bile cannot replace the demand for the product extracted from wild animals".
*One alternative to farming involves replacing medical ingredients from threatened species with manufactured chemical compounds. In general, this sort of substitution is difficult to achieve because the active ingredient is often not known. In addition, most TCM users believe that TCM compounds may act synergistically so several ingredients may interact to give the required effect. Thus TCM users often prefer the wild source. Tauro [[ursodeoxycholic acid]], the active ingredient of [[bear bile]], can be synthesised and is used by some Western doctors to treat [[gallstones]], but many TCM consumers reject it as being inferior to the natural substance from wild animals.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5226">Pregnant patients' rights regarding medical care during the [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]]&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Ammer | first = Christine | title = Pregnant patient's rights | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Women's Health, The | edition = Fifth | pages = 320–321 | publisher = Facts on File, Inc. | location = New York | year = 2005 | ISBN= 0-8160-5790-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are specifically a [[patient]]'s rights within a medical setting and should not be confused with [[pregnancy discrimination]]. A great deal of discussion regarding pregnant patients' rights has taken place in the [[United States]].

==History==
In Western countries, medical services used during labor and delivery have increased since the 1930s. Starting in the 1950s, with the [[natural childbirth]] movement gaining strength, concern increased over typical hospital practices during childbirth. These medical services included medications and procedures that were not always necessary{{snd}} some of which had potential to harm the mother, the baby, or both. Various health-related and [[Consumer organization|consumer]] organization groups began to advocate for a pregnant woman's right to be informed about medical services related to pregnancy and childbirth and for her right to refuse such services.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;

In the [[United States]], the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG) acknowledged the legal obligation of physicians to obtain [[informed consent]] for procedures related to pregnancy and childbirth in 1974.&lt;ref name="aims"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aimsusa.org/ppbr.htm | title = The Pregnant Patient's Bill of Rights | last = Haire | first = Doris | publisher = Alliance for the Improvement of Maternity Services | year = 2000 | accessdate = 2007-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision-making regarding pregnant patients' care===
A 1987 study found that, in the preceding decade, at least 22 hospitals in the United States sought direction from the courts regarding care for pregnant patients. Fifteen court orders were sought, all but one without careful study of the legal facts of the case.&lt;ref name="napw"&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Rights of Pregnant Patients: Carder Case Brings Bold Policy Initiatives | url = http://advocatesforpregnantwomen.org/main/publications/articles_and_reports/the_rights_of_pregnant_patients_carder_case_brings_bold_policy_initiatives.php | journal = HealthSpan | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | year = 1991 | last = Thornton | first = Terry E. |author2=Lynn Paltrow | accessdate = 2007-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a landmark 1990 case, [[George Washington University]] Medical Center (GWUMC) announced a new policy regarding pregnant patients' rights as part of the out-of-court [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] of a case in which a pregnant patient, [[Angela Carder]], died. The new policy stated that decisions regarding medical care for pregnant patients would be made by the patient herself, her doctors, and her family, not by the courts. Although the settlement applied only to GWUMC, the new policy, considered the most comprehensive of its kind at the time, was expected to influence other institutions.&lt;ref name="napw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Greenhouse | first = Linda | publisher = [[The New York Times]] | title = Hospital Sets Policy on Pregnant Patients' Rights | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9C0CE7DE1139F93AA15752C1A966958260 | date = November 29, 1990 | accessdate = 2007-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific rights advocated==
Advocates endorse a pregnant patient's right to participate in medical decisions that may affect her well-being and that of her child. Specifically, these include but are not limited to the right to know the effects and risks to both the woman and the child associated with a drug or procedure, as well as the right to know about additional and alternative treatments.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aims"/&gt;

Some groups, such as the [[American Hospital Association]] in its "Patient's Bill of Rights", advocate additional rights, including rights to the following:&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aims"/&gt;
*To receive medical assistance regardless of where the patient gives birth (whether at home, in a [[hospital]], etc.).
*To refuse drug treatment of any kind.
*To be accompanied during labor and birth by a person or persons she cares for and to whom she looks for emotional support.
*To labor at her own pace without intervention if she chooses.
*To choose her own [[Childbirth positions|birthing position]].
*To keep her baby at her bedside immediately after birth if the baby does not require specialized care, and to feed the baby according to a schedule she decides rather than according to a standard hospital regimen.

'''Sandra Bond Chapman''' is a cognitive neuroscientist, founder and chief director of the [[Center for BrainHealth]], Dee Wyly Distinguished Professor in Brain Health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utdallas.edu/40years/print.html|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas|title=Timeline 40 Years|accessdate=2010-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a professor in the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences at [[The University of Texas at Dallas]].

==Career==

Chapman began her career in the 1970s as a [[speech pathologist]], where she often worked with children diagnosed with severe [[autism]]. During this time, Chapman encountered several children able to solve complex puzzles despite their hindering diagnosis. This contradiction sparked Chapman's interest in the [[brain]]’s potential.&lt;ref name="D magazine"&gt;''Mind Matters: Brain Trust''. D Magazine, Dawn McMullen.2010-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapman's fascination the brain's modifiability later evolved into the idea of a multidisciplinary center housing brain researchers and therapists working collectively to prevent, arrest, and reverse [[brain]] traumas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brainhealth.utdallas.edu/about/facilities.html|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas|title=Center for BrainHealth Facilities|accessdate=2010-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 20 years after it was first conceptualized, Chapman opened the [[Center for BrainHealth]] in Dallas, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Miller.The Dallas Morning News: ''BrainHealth Takes Pleasure in New Center''. Knight Ridder Tribune Business News.2007-01-21&lt;/ref&gt; Chapman continues to serve as the [[Center for BrainHealth]]'s chief director.

== Research ==
Chapman’s cognitive research has laid the theoretical framework and empirical foundation for the development of measurements of higher order reasoning [Test of Strategic Learning] and the development of [[brain]] training programs for children and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utdallas.edu/bbs/staff_faculty/faculty/chapman.html| title=Sandra Bond Chapman|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas.

Chapman's research has resulted in more than 120 publications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.brainhealth.utdallas.edu/research/publications.html|title=Publications|publisher=Center for BrainHealth|accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; nearly 60 funded research grants, and has served as a national public health road for maintaining [[cognitive]] fitness and building critical thinking and reasoning skills in adolescents.&lt;ref name="D magazine"/&gt; Chapman was the principal member writing the first state plan for BrainHealth fitness for adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/health/entries/2010/04/20/state_holding_conference_seeki.html |title=State unveiling first plan for Alzheimer’s ‘epidemic,’ seeking public comment |publisher=Statesman |author=Mary Ann Roser |accessdate=2010-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506075231/http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/health/entries/2010/04/20/state_holding_conference_seeki.html |archivedate=2010-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a core member for [[NIH]]'s selection process of central data elements for nationwide clinical trials on [[acquired brain injury]]. Throughout her career, Chapman has  received major federal, state, and private research support to advance the treatment of veterans, sports-related [[brain injuries]], [[concussion]]s, [[autism]], [[schizophrenia]], adolescent reasoning, and brain development, among others.

[[Image:William Fergusson 1st Baronet.jpg|thumb|right|Sir William Fergusson, 1st Baronet]]
'''Sir William Fergusson, 1st Baronet''' [[Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons|FRCS]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] [[FRSE]] (20 March 1808 – 10 February 1877) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] surgeon.

==Biography==
William Fergusson son of James Fergusson of [[Lochmaben]], [[Dumfriesshire]], was born at [[Prestonpans]], [[East Lothian]] on 20 March 1808, and was educated first at [[Lochmaben]] and afterwards at the high school and [[University of Edinburgh]]. At the age of fifteen he was placed by his own desire in a lawyer's office, but the work proved uncongenial, and at seventeen he exchanged law for medicine, in accordance with his father's original wishes. He became an assiduous pupil of Dr. [[Robert Knox]] the anatomist, who was much pleased with a piece of mechanism which Fergusson constructed, and appointed him at the age of twenty demonstrator to his class of four hundred pupils.{{sfn|Bettany|1889|p=365}}

In 1828 Fergusson became a licentiate, and in 1829 a [[Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons|fellow of the Edinburgh College of Surgeons]]. He continued zealous in anatomy, often spending from twelve to sixteen hours a day in the dissecting-room. Two of his preparations, admirably dissected, are still preserved in the museum of the Edinburgh College of Surgeons. Soon after qualifying Fergusson began to deliver a portion of the lectures on general anatomy, in association with Knox, and to demonstrate surgical anatomy. In 1831 he was elected surgeon to the [[Royal Public Dispensary of Edinburgh|Edinburgh Royal Dispensary]], and in that year tied the subclavian artery, which had then been done in Scotland only twice. On 10 October 1833 he married Helen, daughter and heiress of William Ranken of Spittlehaugh, Peeblesshire. This marriage placed him in easy circumstances, but he did not relax his efforts after success in operative surgery, and by 1836, when he was elected surgeon to the [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh]] and [[fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]], he shared with [[James Syme]] the best surgical practice in Scotland.{{sfn|Bettany|1889|p=365}}

In 1840 Fergusson accepted the professorship of surgery at [[King's College London]], with the surgeoncy to [[King's College Hospital]], and established himself at [[Dover Street]], Piccadilly, whence he removed in 1847 to 16 George Street, now St George's Street, [[Hanover Square, London|Hanover Square]]. He became [[M.R.C.S]]. Engl. in 1840, and fellow in 1844. His practice grew rapidly, and the fame of his operative skill brought many students and visitors to [[King's College Hospital]]. In 1849 he was appointed [[surgeon in ordinary]] to the prince consort, and in 1855 surgeon extraordinary, and in 1867 [[sergeant-surgeon to the queen]].

For many years Fergusson was the leading operator in London. He was elected as President for two years of the [[Pathological Society of London]] in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://archive.org/stream/transactionspat15unkngoog/transactionspat15unkngoog_djvu.txt| title = Transactions of the Pathological Society|accessdate = 2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the council of the [[College of Surgeons]] in 1861, examiner in 1867, and was president of the college in 1870. As professor of human anatomy and surgery he delivered two courses of lectures before the College of Surgeons in 1864 and 1865, which were afterwards published. He was president of the [[British Medical Association]] in 1873. In 1875, he received the honorary degree of LL.D. from [[Edinburgh University]]. He resigned the professorship of surgery at King's College in 1870, but until his death was clinical professor of surgery and senior surgeon to [[King's College Hospital]]. He was also a [[fellow of the Royal Society]]. He was created a [[baronet]] on 23 January 1866,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=23059 |date=12 January 1866 |page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; an honour which led to his receiving a presentation from three hundred old pupils, consisting of a silver dessert service worth £400, at the annual dinner of old King's College men on 21 June 1866.{{sfn|Bettany|1889|pp=365–366}}

[[image:Fergusson.jpg|thumb|Burial vault of William Fergusson in St. Andrews Kirkyard at West Linton]]
He died in London after an exhausting illness, of [[Bright's disease]], on 10 February 1877, and was buried at [[West Linton]], Peeblesshire, where his wife had been buried in 1860.{{sfn|Bettany|1889|p=366}}{{sfn|Waterston||Shearer|2006|p=311}}

A portrait of  Fergusson by Lehmann, painted by subscription, was presented to the London College of Surgeons in 1874, and a replica is in the Edinburgh College of Surgeons.{{sfn|Bettany|1889|p=366}}

==Assessment==
Fergusson's reputation is that of a brilliant operator and a great "conservative" surgeon. The term conservative surgery, first applied by Fergusson in 1852 to operations for the preservation of parts of the body which would otherwise have been sacrificed, does not denote merely operations which he originated or improved, for [[James Syme]] had already been very successful in this line of procedure. But Fergusson extended the principle from the operation of excision of the elbow joint to many others. No portion of the body which could be usefully preserved was too small for him to make efforts to save. Among operations with which his name is specially identified are those for harelip and cleft palate, and operations on the jaws, the excision of joints, notably the hip, knee, and elbow, lithotomy and lithotrity, and amputations of limbs. His skill in dissection, and his careful study of the actions of the muscles which he had to cut through, were of essential importance to his success. In his lectures at the College of Surgeons he was able to speak of three hundred successful operations of his own for harelip. The operation for cleft palate had been largely abandoned till he took it up anew. His manipulative and mechanical skill was shown both in his modes of operating, and in the new instruments he devised. The bulldog forceps, the mouth-gag for cleft palate, and various bent knives attest his ingenuity. A still higher mark of his ability consisted in his perfect planning of every detail of an operation beforehand; no emergency was unprovided for. Thus, when an operation had begun, he proceeded with remarkable speed and silence till the end, himself applying every bandage and plaster, and leaving, as far as possible, no traces of his operation. So silently were most of his operations conducted, that he was often imagined to be on bad terms with his assistants. His punctuality and his hatred of unnecessary waste of time were very marked.{{sfn|Bettany|1889|p=366}}

As a lecturer, out of the operating theatre, Fergusson did not shine, owing to his reticence and his imperfect command of abstract subjects; although on points of practice he gave excellent instruction. In the operating theatre his remarks on the cases before him were valuable and instructive. To students he was most kind and generous. He had to sustain much opposition, especially from Syme, but he did not imitate his opponent's mode of controversy; and if on any occasion he imagined he had said or done something to hurt another's feelings, he never rested till he had made reparation in some form.{{sfn|Bettany|1889|p=366}}

Fergusson was an excellent carpenter, rivalling skilled artisans. When a student he made himself a brass-bound dissecting case, and in 1834 completed a [[lithotrite]], with a novel rack and pinion, which he used throughout life. He was a good violinist, an expert fly-fisher, and very fond of the drama. His endurance was remarkable; he never seemed tired, and scarcely had a day's illness till attacked by Bright's disease. He was tall, dignified, and of good presence, of genial though keen expression, fond of a joke, and very hospitable. He rendered gratuitous aid to large numbers of clergymen, actors, authors, and governesses. He helped many of his pupils in starting in life, a large number of whom attained eminence as surgeons. He never forgot the face of a pupil.{{sfn|Bettany|1889|p=366}}

In some expressions of opinion Fergusson was ill-advised, especially in matters requiring more knowledge of physiology and hygiene than he possessed. His evidence before the royal commission on vivisection, and his relations with [[homeopathic]] practitioners, which he was led to modify, are instances of this. But his faults were faults of sympathy, not of self-conceit or intolerance of criticism.{{sfn|Bettany|1889|p=366}}

==Family==
On 10 October 1833, Fergusson married Helen Hamilton Ranken, daughter and heiress of William Ranken of Spittlehaugh, Peeblesshire. They had two sons: Sir [[James Ranken Fergusson]] (eldest son and heir) and Charles Hamilton (who would eventually rise to the rank of major in the army), and three daughters.{{sfn|Bettany|1889|pp=365–366}}

'''Taxidermy''' is the preserving of an animal's body via mounting (over an armature) or stuffing, for the purpose of display or study. Animals are often, but not always, portrayed in a lifelike state. The word taxidermy describes the process of preserving the animal but the word is also used to describe the end product which are called taxidermy mounts, or referred to simply as "taxidermy". The word taxidermy is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words "taxis" and "derma".&lt;ref name=Harper&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=taxidermy |title=taxidermy |author=Harper, Douglas |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=17 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Taxis means "to move", and  "derma" means "skin" (the [[dermis]]).&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt; The word taxidermy translates to "arrangement of skin".&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt; Taxidermy is practiced primarily on [[vertebrates]]&lt;ref name="RogersSchmidt1989"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen P.

{{Main|History of taxidermy}}

===Tanning and early stuffing techniques===
Preserving animal skins has been practiced for a long time. [[Animal mummy|Embalmed animals]] have been found with Egyptian mummies.
Although [[embalming]] incorporates the use of lifelike poses, it is not considered taxidermy. In the [[Middle Ages]], crude examples of taxidermy were displayed by [[astrologers]] and [[apothecaries]]. The earliest methods of preservation of birds for natural history cabinets were published in 1748 by Reaumur in France. Techniques for mounting were described in 1752 by M. B. Stollas. There were several pioneers of taxidermy in France, Germany, Denmark and England around this time. For a while, clay was used to shape some of the soft parts, but this made specimens heavy.&lt;ref name="Practical Taxidermy"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mantagu Browne|title=Practical Taxidermy - A Manual of Instruction to the Amateur in Collecting, Preserving, and Setting up Natural History Specimens|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hMF9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT152&amp;dq=Taxidermy.+clay.++heavy.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4heeG94fZAhWh1IMKHaLiAdoQ6AEITTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Taxidermy.clay.heavy.&amp;f=false|date=31 July 2015|publisher=Read Country Book|isbn=978-1-4733-7689-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century, almost every town had a [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]] business.&lt;ref name="Authors2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Various Authors|title=Taxidermy Vol.12 Tanning - Outlining the Various Methods of Tanning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Q8lDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT3|date=26 August 2016|publisher=Read Books Limited|isbn=978-1-4733-5355-8|pages=3–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, hunters began bringing their trophies to upholstery shops, where the upholsterers would actually sew up the animal skins and stuff them with rags and cotton. The term "stuffing" or a "stuffed animal" evolved from this crude form of taxidermy.  Professional taxidermists prefer the term "mounting" to "stuffing".  More sophisticated cotton-wrapped [[armature (sculpture)|wire bodies]] supporting sewn-on cured skins soon followed. In France, [[Louis Dufresne]], taxidermist at the [[Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle]] from 1793, popularized [[arsenic]]al soap in an article in ''Nouveau dictionnaire d'histoire naturelle'' (1803–1804). This technique enabled the museum to build the greatest collection of birds in the world.&lt;ref name="Maynard2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. J.

[[Image:Rowland Ward00.jpg|thumb|right|The naturalist [[Rowland Ward]] developed methods of taxidermy.]]
Dufresne's methods spread to England in the early 19th century, where updated and non-toxic methods of preservation were developed by some of the leading naturalists of the day, including [[Rowland Ward]] and Montague Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/13067/11-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-taxidermy|title=11 Things You Probably Didn't Know About Taxidermy|date=2012-11-13|access-date=2017-09-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ward established one of the earliest taxidermy firms, Rowland Ward Ltd. of Piccadilly. However, the art of taxidermy remained relatively undeveloped, and the specimens that were created remained stiff and unconvincing.&lt;ref name="Taxidermy Specimens"&gt;{{cite book|author=Various Authors|title=Taxidermy Vol.10 Collecting Specimens – The Collection and Displaying Taxidermy Specimens|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Kr77DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT3&amp;lpg=PT3&amp;dq=However,+the+art+of+taxidermy+remained+relatively+undeveloped,+and+the+specimens+that+were+created+remained+stiff+and+unconvincing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Fi55yKPKxv&amp;sig=JzCQCSTmlMkhGz3UOFLNd73yiSk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinvoH_9IfZAhWX0YMKHSe9C_YQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=However%2C%20the%20art%20of%20taxidermy%20remained%20relatively%20undeveloped%2C%20and%20the%20specimens%20that%20were%20created%20remained%20stiff%20and%20unconvincing&amp;f=false|date=26 August 2016|publisher= Tobey Press|isbn=978-1-4733-5354-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxidermy as art===
The golden age of taxidermy was during the [[Victorian era]], when mounted animals became a popular part of interior design and decor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Davie, Oliver| title=Methods in the art of taxidermy| publisher=David McKay|place=Philadelphia| year=1900| url=https://archive.org/stream/methodsinartofta00daviuoft#page/n7/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; English [[ornithologist]] [[John Hancock (ornithologist)|John Hancock]] is considered to be the father of modern taxidermy.&lt;ref name="Pray2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leon Pray|title=Taxidermy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h8J9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP8|date=31 July 2015|publisher=Read Books Limited|isbn=978-1-4733-7688-5|pages=8–}}&lt;/ref&gt; An avid collector of birds, which he would shoot himself, he began modelling them with clay and casting in plaster.

For the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851 in [[London]], he mounted a series of stuffed birds as an exhibit. They generated much interest among the public and scientists alike who considered them as superior to earlier models and were regarded as the first lifelike and artistic specimens on display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/news/cms/john-hancock-biography-goddard/|title=John Hancock: A Biography by T. Russell Goddard (1929)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214074009/http://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/news/cms/john-hancock-biography-goddard/|archivedate=2013-12-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A judge remarked that Hancock's exhibit "... will go far towards raising the art of taxidermy to a level with other arts which have hitherto held higher pretensions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taxidermy4cash.com/Articles.html|title=Taxidermy Articles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hancock's display sparked great national interest in taxidermy, and amateur and professional collections for public view proliferated rapidly. Displays of birds were particularly common in middle-class Victorian homes – even [[Queen Victoria]] amassed an impressive bird collection. Taxidermists were also increasingly used by the bereaved owners of dead pets to 'resurrect' them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.morbidoutlook.com/lifestyle/articles/2002_06_memento.html|title=Morbid Outlook – Memento Mori Animalia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthropomorphic taxidermy===
[[File:Potter'sRabbitSchool.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2&lt;!--size for very low image--&gt;|[[Walter Potter]]'s ''Rabbit School'', 1930s]]
In the late 19th century a style known as [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] taxidermy became popular. A 'Victorian whimsy', mounted animals were dressed as people or displayed as if engaged in human activities. An early example of this genre was displayed by Herman Ploucquet, from [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]], at the [[Great Exhibition]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henning|first=Michelle|year=2007| title= Anthropomorphic taxidermy and the death of nature: The curious art of Hermann Ploucquet, Walter Potter and Charles Waterton. |journal=Victorian Literature and Culture| volume= 35|issue=2|pages=663–678|doi=10.1017/S1060150307051704| url=http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/6936/1/Download.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best-known practitioner in this genre was the English taxidermist [[Walter Potter]], whose most famous work was ''The Death and Burial of [[Cock Robin]]''. Among his other scenes were "a rat's den being raided by the local police rats ... [a] village school ... featuring 48 little rabbits busy writing on tiny [[Slate (writing)|slate]]s, while the Kittens' Tea Party displayed feline etiquette and a game of [[croquet]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morris|first=Pat|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=7 December 2007|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/dec/07/art|title=Animal magic|accessdate=2009-02-14|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the simulations of human situations, he had also added examples of bizarrely deformed animals such as two-headed lambs and four-legged chickens. Potter's museum was so popular that an extension was built to the platform at [[Bramber railway station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.steyningmuseum.org.uk/potters.htm | title = Mr Potter of Bramber | last = Ketteman |first = Tony | accessdate = 2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Victorian taxidermists known for their iconic anthropomorphic taxidermy work are William Hart and his Son Edward Hart.&lt;ref name="Kovels"&gt;
{{cite web|url=https://www.kovels.com/news-news-news/stuffed-squirrels-fight-for-high-prices.html|title=Stuffed Squirrels Fight for High Prices|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=|website=www.Kovels.com|publisher=Kovels Auction House|access-date=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They gained recognition with their famous series of [[dioramas]] featuring boxing squirrels. Both William and Edward created multiple sets of these dioramas. One 4-piece set of boxing squirrel dioramas (circa 1850) sold at auction in 2013 for record prices. The four dioramas were created as a set (with each diorama portraying the squirrels at a different stage during their boxing match), however, the set was broken up and each was sold separately at the same auction. The set was one of a number they created over the years featuring boxing squirrels.&lt;ref name="Kovels"/&gt;

Famous examples of modern anthropomorphic taxidermy include the work of artist [[Adele Morse]] who gained international attention with her "[[Stoned Fox]]" sculpture series&lt;ref name="Taxidermy art p. 14"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Marbury|title=Taxidermy Art: A Rogue's Guide to the Work, the Culture, and How to Do It Yourself|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CoJLBAAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Artisan|isbn=978-1-57965-558-7|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the work of artist [[Sarina Brewer]], known for her Siamese twin squirrels and flying monkeys partaking in human activities.&lt;ref name="Crave"/&gt;

===20th century===
[[File:Mother moose and calf diorama - Manitoba Museum (6908025191).jpg|thumb|right| Mother moose and calf diorama, [[Manitoba Museum]]]]
In the early 20th century, taxidermy was taken forward under the leadership of artists such as [[Carl Akeley]], James L. Clark, William T. Hornaday, Coleman Jonas, Fredrick and William Kaempfer, and Leon Pray. These and other taxidermists developed anatomically accurate figures which incorporated every detail in artistically interesting poses, with mounts in realistic settings and poses that were considered more appropriate for the species. This was quite a change from the caricatures popularly offered as hunting trophies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Additional modern uses of Taxidermy have been the use of "Faux Taxidermy" or fake animal heads that draw on the inspiration of traditional taxidermy. Decorating with sculpted fake animal heads that are painted in different colors has become a popular trend in interior design.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/09/faux-taxidermy-decor_n_3245609.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

=== Traditional skin-mount ===
The methods taxidermists practice have been improved over the last century, heightening taxidermic quality and lowering toxicity. The animal is first skinned in a process similar to removing the skin from a chicken prior to cooking.  This can be accomplished without opening the body cavity, so the taxidermist usually does not see internal organs or blood. Depending on the type of skin, preserving chemicals are applied or the skin is tanned. It is then either mounted on a mannequin made from wood, wool and wire, or a polyurethane form.  Clay is used to install glass eyes.  Forms and eyes are commercially available from a number of suppliers.  If not, taxidermists carve or cast their own forms.&lt;ref name="Milgrom2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Melissa Milgrom|title=Still Life: Adventures in Taxidermy|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wr10W1_1C5IC&amp;pg=PA222&amp;dq=taxidermy.+carve+cast+own+forms&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcwsj794fZAhXhzIMKHRZ7CE0Q6AEIPjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=cast%20form&amp;f=false

Taxidermists seek to continually maintain their skills to ensure attractive, lifelike results. Mounting an animal has long been considered an art form, often involving months of work; not all modern taxidermists trap or hunt for prize specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = Morgan Mathews (director) | title = Taxidermy: Stuff the World | medium = documentary film | publisher = Century Films |date = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal specimens can be frozen, then thawed at a later date to be skinned and tanned. Numerous measurements are taken of the body. A traditional method that remains popular today involves retaining the original skull and leg bones of a specimen and using these as the basis to create a mannequin made primarily from wood wool (previously tow or hemp wool was used) and galvanised wire. Another method is to mould the carcass in plaster, and then make a copy of the animal using one of several methods. A final mould is then made of polyester resin and glass cloth, from which a [[polyurethane]] form is made for final production. The carcass is then removed and the mould is used to produce a cast of the animal called a 'form'. Forms can also be made by sculpting the animal first in clay.  Many companies produce stock forms in various sizes. Glass eyes are then usually added to the display, and in some cases, artificial teeth, jaws, tongue, or for some birds, artificial beaks and legs can be used.

===Freeze dried mount===
An increasingly popular trend is to [[freeze dry]] the animal.  For all intents and purposes, a freeze-dried mount is a mummified animal that still has fur on it. The internal organs are removed during preparation; however, all other tissue remains in the body. (The skeleton and all accompanying musculature is still beneath the surface of the fur.) The animal is positioned into the desired pose, then placed into the chamber of a special freeze drying machine designed specifically for this application. The machine freezes the animal and also creates a vacuum in the chamber. Pressure in the chamber helps vaporize moisture in the animal's body, allowing it to dry out. The rate of drying depends on [[vapor pressure]]. (The higher the pressure, the faster the specimen dries.)&lt;ref name="Freezeco"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.freezedryco.com/taxidermy_freeze_drying.html
 |title=Feeze Dry Taxidermy|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=|website= www.freezedryco.com|publisher= www.freezedryco.com|access-date=5 May 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vapor pressure is determined by temperature of the chamber; the higher the temperature, the higher the vapor pressure is at a given [[Vacuum#Outgassing|vacuum]].&lt;ref name="Freezeco"/&gt; The length of the dry-time is important because rapid freezing creates less tissue distortion (i.e.; shrinkage, warping, and wrinkling)&lt;ref name="Freezeco"/&gt; The process can be done with reptiles, birds, and small mammals such as cats, rodents, and some dogs. Large specimens may require up to six months in the freeze dryer before they are completely dry. Freeze drying is the most popular type of pet preservation. This is because it is the least invasive in terms of what is done to the animal's body after death, which is a concern of owners (Most owners do not opt for a traditional skin mount).
In the case of large pets, such as dogs and cats, freeze drying is also the best way to capture the animal's expression as it looked in life (another important concern of owners). Freeze drying equipment is costly and requires much upkeep. The process is also time-consuming; therefore, freeze drying is generally an expensive method to preserve an animal. The drawback to this method is that freeze-dried mounts are extremely susceptible to insect damage. This is because they contain large areas of dried tissue (meat and fat) for insects to feed upon. Traditional mounts are far less susceptible because they contain virtually no residual tissues (or none at all). Regardless of how well a taxidermy mount is prepared, all taxidermy is susceptible to insect damage. Taxidermy mounts are targeted by the same [[Dermestidae|beetles]] and [[Tineola bisselliella|fabric moths]] that destroy wool sweaters and fur coats and that infest grains and flour in pantries.&lt;ref name=bugs&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/03-11.pdf|title= Identifying Museum Insect Pest damage |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=November 2008 |website=|publisher=National Park Service|access-date=7 November 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction mount===
[[File:reproduction_rhino_head.jpg|thumb|Reproduction mount of a rhinoceros made of fiberglass]]
Some methods of creating a trophy mount do not involve preserving the actual body of the animal. Instead, detailed photos and measurements are taken of the animal so a taxidermist can create an exact replica in resin or fiberglass that can be displayed in place of the real animal. No animals are killed in the creation of this type of trophy mount. One situation where this is practiced is in the world of sport fishing where [[catch and release]] is becoming increasingly prevalent. Reproduction mounts are commonly created for (among others) [[trout]], [[bass (fish)|bass]], and large saltwater species such as the [[swordfish]]. Another situation where reproduction trophies are created is when endangered species are involved. Endangered and protected species, such as the [[rhinoceros]], are hunted with rifles loaded with tranquilizer darts rather than real bullets. While the animal is unconscious, the hunter poses for photos with the animal while it is measured for the purpose of creating a replica, or to establish what size of prefabricated fiberglass trophy head can be purchased to most closely approximate the actual animal. The darted animal is not harmed. The hunter then displays the fiberglass head on the wall in lieu of the real animal's head to commemorate the experience of the hunt.

===Re-creation mount===
Re-creation mounts are accurate life-size representations of either [[extant taxon|extant]] or [[extinct]] species that are created using materials not found on the animal being rendered. They utilize the fur, feathers, and skin of another species of animal. According to the National Taxidermy Association:'' "Re-creations, for the purpose of this [competition] category, are defined as renderings which include no natural parts of the animal portrayed. A re-creation may include original carvings and sculptures. A re-creation may use natural parts, provided the parts are not from the species being portrayed. For instance, a re-creation eagle could be constructed using turkey feathers, or a cow hide could be used to simulate African game".''&lt;ref name="competition categories"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taxidermy.net/wtc/categories/|title=World Taxidermy Competition categories|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date=2015|website=www.Taxidermy.net|publisher=Breakthrough Magazine, Inc.|access-date=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A famous example of a re-creation mount is a [[giant panda]] created by taxidermist Ken Walker that he constructed out of dyed and bleached [[American black bear|black bear]] fur.&lt;ref name="Nat Geo Rowell"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://proof.nationalgeographic.com/2014/09/23/exotic-extinct-and-on-display-robert-clarks-take-on-taxidermy/

===Study skins===
A study skin is a taxidermic [[zoological specimen]] prepared in a minimalistic fashion that is concerned only with preserving the animal's skin, not the shape of the animal's body.&lt;ref name="Colchester museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cimuseums.org.uk/article/11001/Study-Skins
|title=Study Skins|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|website=www.ciMuseums.org.uk|publisher=Colchester &amp; Ipswich Museums|access-date=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the name implies, study skins are used for scientific study (research), and are housed mainly by museums. A study skin's sole purpose is to preserve data, not to replicate an animal in a lifelike state.&lt;ref name="Colchester museum"/&gt; Museums keep large collections of study skins in order to conduct comparisons of physical characteristics to other study skins of the same species. Study skins are also kept because DNA can be extracted from them when needed at any point in time.&lt;ref name="NCBI"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Utility of hair shafts from study skins for mitochondrial DNA analysis|last=Kurihara |first=Nozomi|date=11 February 2013|journal=Biolotechnology Information|pmid=24301912|doi=10.4238/2013.November.11.1|volume=12|issue=4|pages=5396–404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study skin's preparation is extremely basic. After the animal is skinned, fat is methodically scraped off the underside of the hide. The underside of the hide is then rubbed with [[borax]] or cedar dust to help it dry faster. The animal is then stuffed with cotton and sewn up. Mammals are laid flat on their belly. Birds are prepared lying on their back. Study skins are dried in these positions to keep the end product as slender and streamlined as possible so large numbers of specimens can be stored side-by-side in flat file drawers, while occupying a minimum amount of space.&lt;ref name="Queensland Museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qm.qld.gov.au/Find+out+about/Behind+the+Scenes/Taxidermy#.Wy0dERSnT8s
|title=Taxidermy|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=|website=Queensland Museum Network|publisher=The State Queensland|access-date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since study skins are not prepared with aesthetics in mind they do not have imitation eyes like other taxidermy, and their cotton filling is visible in their eye openings.&lt;ref name=Rogers&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.museum.lsu.edu/~Remsen/AVECOL-RelaxSkins.htm |title=Relaxing Skins |last=Rogers|first=Steve |date= |website= Bird Collections Bulletin Board|publisher= Museum of Natural Science, Louisiana State University

'''''The Sterilization of Leilani Muir''''' is a 1996 documentary directed by Glynis Whiting about the life and times of [[Leilani Muir]], the first person to file a lawsuit against the [[Alberta]]  provincial government for wrongful sterilization under the [[Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta]].

==Synopsis==
The film runs through the life of [[Leilani Muir]], starting with her early life as a child, her life at the [[Provincial Training School]] (Michener Centre) in Red Deer, Alberta, her experience of the sterilization itself, and her lawsuit that ensued years later. Along the way in the film, professors, legal scholars, and other people of interest are interviewed and offer their knowledge of specific eugenic topics. Also, brief explanations of the theory of eugenics, IQ tests and their relation to eugenics, and a history of eugenics in Alberta and Germany are provided. 
	
[[Leilani Muir]] was born July 15, 1944, in Calgary, Alberta and grew up on a farm. She experienced a rough childhood as her mother often beat her and didn’t provide her with regular meals. As a result, Leilani often went hungry and began to steal classmates' lunches at school. The teachers were quick to notice this and would often bring lunches for her. Teachers also began to question Leilani’s parents but in order to avoid answering these questions, her family would move away. Many neighbors did not even know Leilani existed as she was often locked away on the farm, hidden for no one to see.&lt;ref name="Whiting"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.nfb.ca/film/sterilization_of_leilani_muir/|last=Whiting|first=Glynis|title=The Sterilization of Leilani Muir (film)|year=1996|publisher=National Film Board of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before Leilani’s 11th birthday, July 12, 1955, Leilani was taken to the [[Provincial Training School]] for Mental Defectives (also called the Michener Center) located in Red Deer, Alberta.&lt;ref name="Whiting"/&gt; Leilani, not knowing at the time why she was placed in the centre, believed that she had been taken to an orphanage, since her mother had told her that she had never wanted a girl. During the next couple years Leilani played with the other girls, received a clean bed and clean clothes, was fed three meals a day, went to school and “kicked butt if she felt like it.”&lt;ref name="Whiting"/&gt;
During her time at the Michener Center, Leilani was given a single IQ test in which she scored a 64. She was termed a moron and brought up before the [[Alberta Eugenics Board]]. They had asked her questions such as “At what age does a baby begin to walk and talk?” for roughly 5 minutes. Leilani had known the answer to this question as she had had a younger brother growing up. However, she still was deemed a danger of transmitting mental defects to progeny and incapable of intelligent parenthood. In 1957, at the age of 14 years, Leilani was told that she was undergoing a surgery to have her appendix removed. The surgeons and staff did not mention that she was being sterilized by having her fallopian tubes removed.&lt;ref name="Whiting"/&gt;

In 1965, at the age of 21, Leilani left the Michener Centre and began to support herself. She got married at the age of 24 and wanted to have a family. After going to the doctor, it was revealed that Leilani had been sterilized and could no longer have children. She married again, not having told her husband of her past, and when an adoption fell through, quickly became depressed.&lt;ref name="Whiting"/&gt;

On June 12, 1995 with the Honorable Madame Joanne B. Viet presiding, Leilani, sued the Alberta Government for wrongful sterilization and damages, with her lawyers Jon Faulds and Sandra Anderson. On January 25, 1996, Viet ruled in favor of Muir and awarded her $750,000 CAD in damages. Leilani wishes her story to be made known so that what happened to her and many others may never happen in Canada again.&lt;ref name="Whiting"/&gt;

'''Urban Health Resource Centre''' (UHRC) is a [[non-government organization]] that works towards socio-economic empowerment, improved quality of life, health, nutrition, well-being and empowered social organization among disadvantaged urban communities through – (i) demand-supply improvement, community-provider linkages, and demonstration programs that use a consultative and partnership based approach, (ii) technical support to government and non-government agencies and (iii) research, advocacy and knowledge dissemination. The UHRC’s demonstration programs utilize community organizing to establish women’s community groups consisting of slum-dwelling women who advocate for community-level infrastructure improvements.

== History and outline of UHRC operations ==

UHRC was established in 2005 as a registered non-profit company under India’s [[Companies Act, 1956]] with the aim of working towards socio-economic empowerment, improved quality of life, health, nutrition, and general well-being for urban disadvantaged families. Its startup was supported by [[USAID]] between 2004 and 2005, but as of 2009, the UHRC no longer receives USAID financial support.

UHRC implements demonstration programs among slum-dwelling populations in cities ([[Indore]], [[Agra]], and more recently North-East Delhi) with the intention that they be adapted, replicated and up-scaled by other government and non-government agencies. These demonstration programs focus simultaneously on community empowerment to enhance demand for services and on working with the service providers to improve supply side responsiveness to meet the increased demand. Since slum-dwellers are usually not connected to the mainstream population, part of the UHRC’s ground work involves proactive community mobilization, encouragement and outreach to identify vulnerable populations and facilitate their connection to social and economic sector service providers such as healthcare, living environment services, house improvement services and employment programs.

UHRC programs facilitate the formation of women's and children's groups to strengthen the social cohesion in slums and to address gender inequity. The program works toward building their capacity to take charge of processes that affect family economics, health, education, nutrition, housing improvement and overall social wellbeing. UHRC provides targeted trainings and workshops to community groups on topics such as (a) acquiring knowledge, (b) building negotiations skills (such as sending collective application to civic authorities) and, (c) interfacing with diverse government agencies to improve slum living environments and access to health, nutrition and social entitlements. Slum communities in UHRC program cities participate in health education and promotion sessions facilitated by UHRC field workers on topics such as maternal and child health, nutrition, hygiene, and environmental health.

As the number of community groups in a local region reaches a critical mass, they are networked into a larger congress called a “federation” or cluster-team of women's groups, consisting of democratically agreed-upon representatives from each group. Cluster-level congresses of women's groups and slum-level groups receive regular supervision, mentoring support and materials (such as steel containers to store registers, charts, behaviour promotion materials, floor mats to sit during meetings) from UHRC teams to carry out meetings and activities working towards improved health and well-being. UHRC partners with participating community groups and federations to help them access available services, schemes and resources. Groups and cluster-team members are also coached on negotiation skills and provided trainings on how to effectively negotiate with healthcare providers and other civic authorities through dialogue and formal applications to obtain health services and environmental services such as road paving, drain installation, sanitation/water infrastructure, garbage removal, and other entitlements.

Along with running the demonstration programs, UHRC also provides technical support to the government (at national, provincial, and city levels) and non-government agencies in the form of research, advocacy, and knowledge dissemination. Additionally, the UHRC central and field offices provides trainings, internships,and volunteer options for students from different universities in India and abroad. All interns and volunteers, whoin the past eight years have included Masters and PhD students, have learnt from field based participatory action research in UHRC's program sites.

== UHRC programs ==
=== Health outreach, service access, and behavior promotion ===

Some of the first activities the UHRC encourages slum women to discuss and analyze health, well-being challenges faced by their families and the community as a whole. UHRC helps a new slum women’s group with are health activism training and advocacy of healthy household practices. Through workshops and training sessions, women’s groups are encouraged to begin promoting healthy practices and health seeking behaviors in their communities, such as going to the hospital when a woman goes into labor. This process involves training women’s group members to become social health activists so they can conduct preventive and promotive health workshops and sessions for their peers. An aspect of this training is encouraging women’s group members to promote cultural and religious traditions that are relevant to their communities, while incorporating educational curriculums surrounding proper hygiene and healthy behaviors for new mothers. One example is that UHRC women’s groups often hold group [[Annaprashan]] ceremonies (a ceremony wherein a child is first fed food other than milk), incorporating curriculums surrounding ante-natal child care.

UHRC also trains group members on reaching out to private and public healthcare providers such as [[Auxiliary nurse midwife|Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs)]] and [[Anganwadi]] centers to run health camps in their communities. At the 13th World Congress on Public Health, the UHRC reported improvements in slum residents’ access to health services and information and adoption of healthy behaviors in intervention areas. Furthermore, they noted that as of 2009, 70% of children in intervention areas were completely immunized as opposed to 28% in areas that had not yet developed UHRC programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://wfpha.confex.com/wfpha/2012/webprogram/Paper10702.html|title=Community Driven and Managed Slum Well-Being Programme in Agra City, India|first=Ali,|last=Naushad|date=27 April 2012|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to advocacy and education, UHRC women's groups also play a direct role in linking women in urban slums to health services. Women's group members frequently escort married adolescent migrant girls to hospitals for safer deliveries when they go into labor, and to ante-natal services which they may not otherwise be familiar with.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-7282-2_26|title=International Handbook of Migration and Population Distribution|last=Montgomery|first=Mark R.|last2=Balk|first2=Deborah|last3=Liu|first3=Zhen|last4=Agarwal|first4=Siddharth|last5=Jones|first5=Eleri|last6=Adamo|first6=Susana|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789401772815|editor-last=White|editor-first=Michael J.|series=International Handbooks of Population|pages=573–604|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-017-7282-2_26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collective savings/social resilience funds ===

Once groups have developed a regular meeting schedule and have undertaken some basic health outreach activities, the UHRC proposes to groups that they could form a collective savings fund. These collective savings funds are essentially a method of risk pooling. Groups decide upon a certain monthly or weekly contribution that each member needs to make to grow their fund. All contributions to the pool are recorded by a treasurer who is elected by the group. The women are facilitated to establish standards for mutual accountability. The UHRC aids in establishing a record keeping system and in training the women to keep these records up to date – trainings cover how to track and record collective savings, loans given from the savings pool, interest received along with the principal amount, and essential elements of managing savings and loans. When a member or even a non-member family is in need of a loan, women’s groups can provide low to zero interest loans (for example one group in Agra, Saraswati Mahila Swasth Samiti, has adopted a 2% interest rate). Collecting payments, managing the fund, and administering all loans is facilitated by women’s group members with support from UHRC's team members. These funds play a crucial role in reducing the burden of health care costs on poor families, particularly during health emergencies. Loans are given for a variety of needs: a) Maternal and Child Health, b) Health emergencies, c) Prevention of school drop-outs, d) House improvements, e) Food insecurity, f) Expansion of small enterprises, g) Repaying debts from money-lender, and h) Social and family expenditures.

=== Petition writing and infrastructure improvement ===

Based on its initial experience with the program in Indore, and Agra, beginning November 2009, UHRC program strategies have evolved towards a broader development of the urban slums/vulnerable populations goal. UHRC has found educating communities about government resources and services to be particularly effective. As groups bring municipal problems forward, the UHRC will suggest that communities begin writing applications and letters to service providers, and holds trainings and workshops where group members can practice writing applications and learn about the importance of making and filing copies of all applications and letters that submitted. Field workers encourage groups to write highly specific, concrete requests that focus on a single issue rather than multiple issues to increase chances of success. They are also encouraged to have all members sign each request or petition to show consensus.

Usually the first few petitions or letters written are followed by a period of struggle or stagnancy. Municipal service providers and government officials tend to be initially unresponsive and uncooperative. Group members are therefore trained to write reminders following up on requests and to seek formal receipts from civic authorities for any communications sent. For example, group members are trained to send reminders through the government postal system, which automatically provides receipts to senders.

Women’s groups also learn to recruit the support of democratically elected ward representatives who can help in interfacing with municipal corporations. Field workers guide group members to start by pursuing simple tasks, such as getting a street drain cleaned, before moving on to more ambitious projects such as road paving and water supply installation.

=== Social awareness and advocacy ===

UHRC women’s groups have also begun organizing rallies around community needs, such as ousting alcohol vendors to disincentivize alcoholism, demonstrating against gambling to protect household finances, advocating against domestic violence, or organizing public health advocacy campaigns. Groups have also orchestrated sit ins at government offices to urge them to be responsive to community needs and requests by providing services, such as slum street paving, drain installation, water supply and sewage system installation, health and nutrition services, food security services, widows pensions.

=== Government scheme awareness and application support ===

Through engagement with its target populations in Indore, Agra, and Delhi, the UHRC began focusing its efforts on helping slum residents attain proper identification documentation. Slum residents, and particularly migrant adolescents living within urban slums, who do not have proper documentation face barriers such as ineligibility for government welfare programs and education scholarships as well as housing insecurity. The UHRC assists women's group members to learn about and apply for various forms of picture ID, voter ID, proof-of-address, and other documentation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Research and Knowledge Sharing==

Another of the UHRC's key roles is producing knowledge about urban slum poverty. One area of research for the UHRC has been aimed at catalyzing local urban governments to recognize yet unlisted [[slum]]s. Censuses often exclude the homeless and informal urban settlements as such settlements are often built on land that is not legally owned by the residents.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elsey|first=H.|last2=Thomson|first2=D.

Such activities and relationship building allow UHRC community groups to document additional information such as income flows, and make decisions about which slum-improvement initiatives to prioritize.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Datasets and analyses of existing data generated by the UHRC have been used by [[United Nations|UN]] organizations including the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and [[UN-HABITAT|UN-Habitat]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The UHRC's disaggregation and analysis of [[Demographic and Health Surveys|Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)]] was highlighted in the WHO's "Hidden Cities" report.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, UN Habitat . Hidden cities: unmasking and overcoming health inequities in urban settings. Nairobi, Kenya: UN Habitat and World Health Organisation; 2013. Pp 84 Accessed on 23-9-2016 at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.who.int/kobe_centre/publications/hiddencities_media/who_un_habitat_hidden_cities_web.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Using India's National Family Health Survey (NFHS) dataset (an adaptation of [[Demographic and Health Surveys|DHS]]), the UHRC conducted an analysis of the poorest quartile of urban residents as compared to the rest of the urban population in Indian cities. David Satterthwaite in his [http://eau.sagepub.com/content/23/1/5.full.pdf Editorial in Environment and Urbanization 2011] highlights the significance of UHRC's research. He states that UHRC's research provides "evidence of the lack of attention to the health of the urban poor. For instance, in 2004–2005, the under-five mortality rate of the poorest urban quartile in many states in India was two to three times that of the rest of the urban population. The evidence also points to considerable differences between states in this regard. The poorest urban quartile in Uttar Pradesh, for instance, had an under-five mortality rate more than double that of the poorest urban quartile in Maharashtra. The analysis revealed that the [[Child mortality|under-five mortality]] rate among the poorest quartile of urban residents in many provinces in India was nearly three times higher than for the rest of the urban population. Inter-provincial disparities also exist with [[Uttar Pradesh]]'s under-five mortality more than twice as high as that of [[Maharashtra]]. The analysis also showed that among the poorest quartile: 60% of children had not completed immunization regiments and around 50% suffered from [[undernutrition]], about half of all births were not assisted by health workers, less than 20% had a direct water supply, and more than half did not use a flush or pit toilet to dispose of waste.Sattherthwaite also stresses that UHRC's research exposes the "scale of health disadvantages experienced by the poorest quartile of India’s urban population and the large disparities in provision of health care, water and sanitation and in housing conditions in the urban population of seven states, between the poorest quartile and the rest of the population."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Satterthwaite|first=David|date=2011-04-01|title=Editorial: Why is urban health so poor even in many successful cities?|url=http://eau.sagepub.com/content/23/1/5|journal=Environment and Urbanization|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|pages=5–11|doi=10.1177/0956247811401521|issn=0956-2478}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work has been referenced in numerous publications including [[UNICEF|UNICEF's]] State of the World's Children 2012 report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Unicef|first=United Nations Children's Fund|date=2012-03-01|title=The State of the World's Children 2012: Children in an Urban World|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:4823|publisher=eSocialSciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UHRC also has a history of collaboration with Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health to generate research on maternal and newborn health in slums and to assess the efficacy/implementation of existing interventions. One such collaboration revealed that factors affecting mothers' compliance with birth preparedness and complication readiness (BPACR) include maternal literacy and the use of antenatal services. Evidence from trials in Nepal, India, and countries in Africa have shown that promoting BPACR leads to more care-seeking behaviors among pregnant women. The research concluded that antenatal outreach sessions can be used to promote BPACR, especially if one of the focuses is enhancing the competency of traditional slum-based birth attendants.&lt;ref name="Agarwal 383–391"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Agarwal|first=Siddharth|last2=Sethi|first2=Vani|last3=Srivastava|first3=Karishma|last4=Jha|first4=Prabhat K.|last5=Baqui|first5=Abdullah H.|date=2010-08-01|title=Birth Preparedness and Complication Readiness among Slum Women in Indore City, India|journal=Journal of Health, Population, and Nutrition|volume=28|issue=4|pages=383–391|issn=1606-0997|pmc=2965330|pmid=20824982|doi=10.3329/jhpn.v28i4.6045}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another collaboration demonstrated the significance of the "human touch method" (HT) to detect hypothermia in neonates in Indian slum dwellings. The HT method was compared to axillary digital thermometry (ADT) and the results showed that while HT had moderate diagnostic accuracy when compared with ADT, it was simpler and more programmatically feasible as an early assessment of newborn sickness, freeing up field workers to focus on counseling mothers rather than managing technology.&lt;ref name="Agarwal 383–391" /&gt; A third collaboration research with Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and King George Medical University, India surveyed women who gave birth in the three years preceding the survey. Results showed that 60% of pregnancies were registered with a health facility, and of these, only one quarter were registered with a government facility. Early registration facilitates early and frequent checkups during pregnancy and immediately after pregnancy and allows timely screening for complications. The survey showed that the low rate of government registrations was likely a result of poor-functioning public facilities, short-staffing of female doctors, poor referral systems, long queues, and impolite treatment towards slum women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.technologyreview.com/p/pub/legacy/tr_07_10_01_low_res.pdf|title=MIT Technology Review: India Edition|last=|first=|date=July 2010|work=|access-date=28 September 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy advocacy &amp; technical support to government/NGOs ==

In 2004, prior to its renaming from USAID-EHP to the Urban Health Resource Centre, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare designated UHRC as “the nodal technical agency for ‘Urban Health Programme’”. In this capacity, the UHRC’s role has been to “provide further assistance to State Governments in formulating urban health proposals and to provide concrete examples for planning of health care delivery to the urban poor in different categories of cities”.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Government of India. Guidelines for developing city level urban health projects, New Delhi: Government of India: 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;MoHFW [Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare]. 2009. Draft final report of the task force to advise the National Rural Health Mission on "Strategies for Urban Health Care". New Delhi: Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare; 2006. Available at: http://nrhm.gov.in/images/pdf/communitisation/task-group-reports/report-uhtf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This technical assistance included recommendations for goals and objectives of the Urban Health Program, coverage criteria, and a workflow for the development of urban health proposals by cities eligible for support from the Ministry of Health &lt;ref&gt;Singh, Anju Dadhwal, Shivani Taneja, and Siddharth Agarwal. "Technical Assistance to the Government of India for Urban Health Planning and National Guidelines." (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The UHRC also played a key role in shaping the National Urban Health Mission (NUHM), a sub-mission to the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) launched in 2013, intended to consolidate, focus, and expand the Government of India’s initiatives for addressing the needs of the urban poor which were formerly operated under the NRHM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Corburn | first1 = Jason | last2 = Cohen | first2 = Alison K. | year = 2012 | title = Why we need urban health equity indicators: integrating science, policy, and community | url = | journal = PLoS Med | volume = 9 | issue = 8| page = e1001285 | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its renaming to the UHRC, the organization has continued in its capacity of providing technical assistance to State Governments within India as they propose and execute urban health projects.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

An example of the UHRC’s role in supporting state governments is its role in helping the Uttrakhand Health &amp; Family Welfare Society to develop its Program Implementation Plan (PIP) under the National Rural Health Mission. Under the PIP, the UHRC’s New Delhi location was selected to run Urban Health Centres (UHCs) aimed at providing health care and support in slum communities and regularized outreach camps to vulnerable urban populations. The UHRC’s functions include coordinating NGO functionaries and collaborators and providing training to their staffs to help run UHCs, conducting GIS mapping of cities and slums to determine the most effective locations to place UHCs, and developing and piloting guidelines for women’s group programs through its experience in its other program cities such as Indore and Agra. Key activities of UHCs include providing maternal and child healthcare, providing antenatal and postnatal care, providing immunizations for newborns and children, care coordination through collaboration with other NGOs, behavior change education with regards to health and sanitation, resource awareness education for slum-dwelling families, and community capacity building through collective action initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Uttrakhand Health &amp; Family Welfare Society.

'''Water supply and sanitation in Indonesia''' is characterized by poor levels of access and service quality. Over 40 million people lack access to an [[improved water source]] and more than 110 million of the country’s 240 million population has no access to [[improved sanitation]].&lt;ref name="JMP"/&gt; Only about 2% of people have access to [[sewerage]] in urban areas; this is one of the lowest in the world among middle-income countries. [[Water pollution]] is widespread on Bali and Java. Women in Jakarta report spending US$11 per month on boiling water, implying a significant burden for the poor.

The estimated level of public investment of only US$2 per capita a year in 2005 was insufficient to expand services significantly and to properly maintain assets. Furthermore, policy responsibilities are fragmented between different Ministries. 
Since [[decentralization]] was introduced in Indonesia in 2001 local governments (districts) have gained responsibility for water supply and sanitation. However, this has so far not translated into an improvement of access or service quality, mainly because devolution of responsibilities has not been followed by adequate fund channeling mechanisms to carry out this responsibility. Local utilities remain weak. 

The provision of clean drinking water has unfortunately not yet been taken up as a development priority, particularly at the provincial government level.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"&gt;[[UNICEF]]:[http://www.unicef.org/indonesia/wes.html UNICEF Indonesia-Overview-Water &amp; Environmental Sanitation]. Retrieved February 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of access to clean water and sanitation remains a serious challenge, especially in slums and rural areas. This is a major concern because lack of clean water reduces the level of hygiene in the communities and it also raises the probability of people contracting skin diseases or other [[waterborne diseases]]. A failure to aggressively promote [[Behavior change (public health)|behaviour change]], particularly among low-income families and slum dwellers, has further worsened the health impact of Indonesia’s water and sanitation situation.&lt;ref name="UNICEF" /&gt;

== Water resources and use ==
[[IMage:Serayu River, Central Java.jpg|thumb|250px|Most rivers in Indonesia, such as the [[Serayu River]] in Central Java shown here, are relatively short, seasonal and carry a high sediment load]]
Indonesia has over 5,590 rivers, most of them short and steep. Because of high rainfall intensities most rivers carry large quantities of sediment.&lt;ref name="Anshori"/&gt; Average rainfall is above 2,000&amp;nbsp;mm on most islands, except for the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]] where it is 1,500&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="Aquastat"&gt;[[FAO]] Aquastat:[http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries/indonesia/index.stm Indonesia], version 1999, retrieved on October 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 80% of rain falls during the rainy season (October to April). While water resources are quite abundant in [[Sumatra]], [[Kalimantan]], [[Sulawesi]], [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] and [[Irian]], water shortages occur during the dry season in parts of [[Java]], [[Bali]] and the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]. In particular in Java, the dry season flows are inadequate to meet the demand, leading to irrigation shortages.&lt;ref name="Anshori"/&gt; Irrigation accounts for 93% of water use.&lt;ref name="Aquastat"/&gt; The total storage capacity amounts to only 5% to 6% of the river flows. Construction of reservoirs is constrained by lack of good reservoir sites, high density of population at possible reservoir sites and expected short reservoir lifetimes due to [[siltation]]. Groundwater potential in Indonesia is very limited. However, much of the eastern islands depend on groundwater because of surface water scarcity.&lt;ref name="Anshori"/&gt; Groundwater overexploitation occurs in heavily populated coastal areas of Java, including in [[Jakarta]] and [[Semarang]]. In Jakarta it has caused seawater intrusion up to 10&amp;nbsp;km from the coast and land subsidence at a rate of 2–34&amp;nbsp;cm/year in east Jakarta.&lt;ref name="Aquastat"/&gt; In Semarang land subsidence occurs at a rate of 9&amp;nbsp;cm/year.&lt;ref name="Hadipuro"/&gt;

Water utilities abstract water from rivers and lakes (60%), springs (25%) and groundwater (15%). For example, the main water source for Jakarta is the Jatiluhur Dam on the [[Citarum River]] 70&amp;nbsp;km southeast of the city. For those who are self-supplied or receive water from community-based organizations, shallow groundwater and springs are by far the main sources of water on most islands. On Sumatra and Irian, however, [[rainwater harvesting]] is also an important water source.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrayanto, Bogor Agricultural University:[http://www.nourin.tsukuba.ac.jp/~tasae/2004/Indonesia.pdf Watershed and Water Resources Management in Indonesia: AnOverview of Forest Degradation and Present Situation of Water Resources Supply and Efficient Utilization for Human Survival and Bioproduction], 2004, p. 7-8, quoting BPS-Statistic Indonesia figures for 2002, retrieved on October 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pollution.''' Domestic sewage, industrial effluents, agricultural runoff, and mismanaged solid waste are polluting surface and groundwater, especially in Java. Indonesia ranks among the worst countries in Asia in sewerage and sanitation coverage. Few Indonesian cities possess even minimal sanitation systems. The absence of an established sanitation network forces many households to rely upon private septic tanks or to dispose of their waste directly into rivers and canals. The commonality of the latter practice, together with the prevalence of polluted shallow wells used for drinking water supply in urban areas, has led to repeated epidemics of gastrointestinal infections.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank:[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTINDONESIA/Resources/Publication/03-Publication/indo_monitor.pdf Indonesia Environment Monitor 2003, Special focus: Reducing pollution], p. 20-32, retrieved on October 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Domestic Waste'''.
According to Water Environment Partnership in Asia (WEPA), only 42.8 percent from 51,372,661 houses in Indonesia have domestic waste treatment. More than half of households dispose their domestic waste directly to the river body.&lt;ref name="WEPA"&gt;WEPA:[http://www.wepa-db.net/policies/state/indonesia/indonesia.htm State of Water Environmental Issues in Indonesia]. Retrieved on February 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Data from the [[World Bank]] shows that in 2008, only 52% of Indonesian population has an adequate access to excreta disposal facilities. Such facilities are important as they can help to minimize human, animal, and insect contact with excreta, thereby increasing the hygiene level and enhancing the living conditions for the slum-dwellers. Without proper construction and maintenance of these facilities, domestic wastes are disposed ineffectively and increases the rate of water resources degradation.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank:[http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.STA.ACSN Improved sanitation facilities (% of population with access)]. Retrieved on February 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Industrial Waste'''.
Industrial activities wastes such as small-scale industries, agriculture, textile, pulp and paper, petrochemical, mining and oil and gas also contribute to the degradation of water quality in Indonesia.  Water quality in locations near to the mining areas is potentially contaminated by heavy metal such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]] (Hg). According to WEPA, some level of mercury (Hg) concentration has been detected at 9 out of 16 sampling points and the highest level of dissolved mercury in one of the area reach 2.78&amp;nbsp;ug/l.&lt;ref name="WEPA"/&gt;

Therefore, the result of water quality monitoring in 30 rivers&lt;ref name="WEPA"/&gt; in Indonesia indicates that most of river water quality do not meet water criteria class 1, i.e. water that can be used for standard water, drinking water, and or other usage that requires the same water quality with such usage, due to pollution by domestic and industrial wastes (drinking water raw based on Government Regulation Number 82, 2001, Water Quality Management and Wastewater Controlling).&lt;ref&gt;MOHA-SEMAC:[http://www.moha-semac.com/en/html/GR-EN/GR%2082%202001_EN.pdf GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA NUMBER: 82 OF 2001 REGARDING WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT AND WATER POLLUTION CONTROL]. p.4-5.

Data on access to water and sanitation in Indonesia vary depending on the source consulted and the definition of access. According to the Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation by WHO and UNICEF (see table above) access to an [[improved water source]] stood at 82% and access to [[improved sanitation]] at 54% in 2010.&lt;ref name="JMP"/&gt;

Indonesia has one of the lowest sewerage coverage levels in Asia with only 2 percent access in urban areas. Most excreta and wastewater are discharged untreated or semi-treated into local drains or water bodies, causing massive environmental pollution. Dense housing, severe seasonal flooding and the choking of drains with uncollected solid waste exacerbate the problem.&lt;ref name="WSP 2011"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeremy Colin|title=Lessons in Urban Sanitation Development Indonesia Sanitation Sector Development Program 2006-2010|url=http://www.wsp.org/wsp/sites/wsp.org/files/publications/WSP-lessons-urban-sanitation-indonesia.pdf|publisher=Water and Sanitation Program Field Note, May 2011|accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the World Bank, urban sanitation is the least well addressed of major policy issues in Indonesia.&lt;ref name="World Bank, Annex 1"&gt;[[World Bank]]:[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/06/08/000090341_20060608110102/Rendered/INDEX/35503.txt PROJECT APPRAISAL DOCUMENT ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A THIRD WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES (PAMSJMAS) PROJECT], June 1, 2006, Annex 1.

==Service quality==
No data is available on the average continuity of water supply in Indonesian cities. However, in [[Jakarta]] 92% of users received continuous water supply in 2001.&lt;ref name="Jakarta ADB 2001"&gt;[[Asian Development Bank]]:[http://www.adb.org/Water/Indicators/Profiles/Jakarta_city.pdf City Profile:Jakarta Water Supply], Data as of 2001.

==Health impact of inadequate water supply and sanitation==
Unsafe drinking water is a major cause of [[diarrhea]], which is the second leading killer of children under five in the country and accounts for about 20% of child deaths each year. Every year, at least 300 out of 1,000 Indonesians suffer from water-borne diseases, including [[cholera]], [[dysentery]], and [[typhoid]] fever, according to the Ministry of Health.&lt;ref name="adb.org"&gt;[[Asian Development Bank]]:[https://www.scribd.com/doc/110969046/Indonesia-Water-Action-Simple-Solution-for-Drinking-Water-Makes-Big-Difference Country Water Action: Indonesia Simple Solution for Drinking Water Makes Big Difference], March 2006. Retrieved March 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Bank]]’s [[Water and sanitation program]] (WSP) in 2008 revealed that poor sanitation, including poor hygiene causes at least 120 million disease episodes and also 50,000 premature deaths annually.&lt;ref name="WSP"&gt;[http://www.wsp.org/wsp/content/east-asia-economic-impacts-sanitation#Indonesia East Asia: Economics of Sanitation Initiative]. Retrieved on 11 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Significant damage to the country's future potential in terms of infant mortality and child [[malnutrition]] in low-income areas of Indonesia is greatly associated with inadequate access to safe water and basic sanitation.&lt;ref name="World Bank, Annex 1"/&gt;

==Household-level drinking water treatment==
People in Jakarta spend significant resources on boiling water to make it drinkable. Indonesian women report spending more than 100,000 rupiahs or 11 US dollars a month on kerosene for boiling water.&lt;ref name="adb.org" /&gt; However, a new system to treat drinking water at the household level without boiling has cut down on these costs and reduces health risks among women and children. The system, called “Air RahMat” or “gift water,” is produced by a private-public partnership called Aman Tirta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aman Tirta, Safe Water Systems|url =http://www.jhuccp.org/whatwedo/projects/aman-tirta-safe-water-systems-sws}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of Aman Tirta include the [[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]] International Indonesia. The brand name refers to a liquid 1.25% [[sodium hypochlorite]] (bleach) solution which is effective in deactivating micro-organisms such as [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]] in water. The solution was originally developed as part of the Safe Water Systems program of the U.S.-based [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]. When used correctly in conjunction with proper storage, the water treatment solution has been shown to reduce the risk of diarrhea up to 85%. Air RahMat is also able to protect water for two to three days from recontamination.
The solution is easy to use by adding three milliliters of Air Rahmat for every 20 liters of water, shaking or stirring for 30 seconds, and waiting for at least 30 minutes until the water is ready to drink.&lt;ref name="adb.org"/&gt;

==Economic impact of inadequate water supply and sanitation==
The economic costs associated with inadequate water supply and unsanitary conditions represent formidable obstacles to the improvement of living standard. The enormous economic costs resulting from chronic ill health can contribute to poor nutrition, poor school performance, reduced productivity, and permanent disability and thus represent a drag on economic development.

One of the key findings from the ''Economics of Sanitation Initiative'' with a [[Water and sanitation program]] study from [[Southeast Asia]] revealed that in 2006, [[Indonesia]] lost an estimated US$6.3 billion due to poor sanitation and hygiene, equivalent to approximately 2.3% of its gross domestic product ([[GDP]]). Of the impacts evaluated, health and water resources contribute most to the overall economic losses estimated in the study. These impacts are expected to cause financial losses to populations who have to pay for health services or who pay more to access clean water supplies, or who may lose income due to poor health. Poor sanitation also contributes up to $1.2 billion
per year in population welfare losses due to additional time required to access unimproved sanitation, $166 million per year in tourism losses, and $96 million in environmental losses due to loss of productive land.&lt;ref&gt;Economics of Sanitation Initiative:[http://www.wsp.org/wsp/content/east-asia-economic-impacts-sanitation#Indonesia Economic impacts of sanitation in Indonesia by Napitupulu L and Hutton G World Bank (Water and Sanitation Program) 2008], Retrieved on February 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to provide adequate water supply and sanitation facilities in Indonesia is also challenged by the country's population increase that led to postponement of investment in the infrastructure required for the provision of urban water and sanitation. Such challenge can lead to greater costs in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Economics of Sanitation Initiative:[http://www.wsp.org/wsp/content/east-asia-economic-impacts-sanitation#Indonesia Economic impacts of sanitation in Indonesia by Napitupulu L and Hutton G World Bank (Water and Sanitation Program) 2008], p.14, Retrieved on February 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibility for water and sanitation==

=== Policy and regulation ===

Policy and regulatory responsibilities for the water and sanitation sector are shared among several ministries. While the Ministry of Health is responsible for water quality-related aspects, and to a certain extent rural services, responsibility for the urban sector is shared between the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Public Works. The National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) has a role in planning investments. The Ministry of Industry and Trade also has some responsibilities for the regulation of bottled water. A National Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation Working Group (Pokja AMPL) coordinates between departments and with donors and other stakeholders. The working group does not have a legal basis, nor secure funding.

'''Strategies and policies'''. Most strategies for the sector are formulated at the national level. Capacity problems, funding constraints and political factors at the sub-national level often mean national strategies are not well implemented. Furthermore, law enforcement is weak, especially for environmental sanitation. In 2009 the Ministry of Public Works and the National Development Planning Agency, Bappenas, launched a roadmap called “Acceleration of Sanitation Development in Human Settlements” (PPSP) 2010-2014. The roadmap targets 330 cities that have sanitation problems, and aims at abolishing open defecation, improving solid waste management and reducing flooding. It foresees the construction of new and expanded sewerage networks in 16 cities, covering 5 million people, and of community-based decentralized wastewater management systems in every city, covering 6 millions people. The latter systems, called ''Sanitasi oleh Masyarakat'' (Sanitation by Communities), include neighborhood-level sewer systems with small wastewater treatment plants, typically using the [[Anaerobic digestion|Anaerobic Batch Reactor]] technology. The systems are completely operated by community-based organizations that collect user fees.&lt;ref name="WSP 2011"/&gt; According to research conducted in 2011, community-based organizations operate the systems fairly well, but are unable to undertake major maintenance such as removal of sludge from the wastewater treatment plants or repairs after natural disasters. In addition to decentralized sewer systems, the government also supports the construction of community toilets, although people prefer to have their individual toilets. Community toilets are a good alternative where individual toilets are not feasible, especially in areas subject to frequent flooding, where most residents are tenants or where there are severe space constraints and very densely populated slum areas.&lt;ref&gt;Isabel Blackett, Water and Sanitation Program East Asia: [http://www.worldwaterweek.org/documents/WWW_PDF/2012/Tue/Sanitation-Urban/Blackett-DEWATS-lessons-learned.pdf Community-Managed Decentralized Wastewater Treatment Systems in Indonesia, Findings &amp; Lessons Learned], Presentation at World Water Week 2012, Stockholm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the Health Ministry launched a National Strategy for [[Community-Led Total Sanitation]], emphasizing peer pressure and shame as drivers for rural sanitation instead of public investment. The Government’s National Program for Community Empowerment (PNPM—''Program Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat'') also has the potential to improve water and sanitation services through block grants, technical assistance and training to communities. However, similar broad programs have in the past only allocated around five per cent of funds to water and sanitation.&lt;ref name="AusAID Evaluation"/&gt;

'''Legal framework'''. Relevant laws include Law No. 7/2004 on water resources; Law No. 22/1999 on local government; Law No.32/2004 on Regional Government; and Law No.33/2004 on Fiscal Balance between the Center and the Regions. The water resource law aims at integrated and sustainable water resources management and clarifies the responsibilities of the central government as well as provincial and district governments in terms of water resources management, such as the granting of water abstraction licenses. The local government law was a landmark in terms of decentralization in Indonesia after the fall of [[Suharto]], making the previous rhetorical commitment to decentralization a reality by transferring all powers except certain specifically enumerated powers to local government.&lt;ref&gt;Embassy of Indonesia in Ottawa:[http://www.indonesia-ottawa.org/page.php?s=2010background Decentralization in Indonesia since 1999 - An Overview], retrieved on October 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The fiscal balance law greatly increased the revenue base for local government.&lt;ref name="Anshori"&gt;Imam Anshori, Chief of Sub Directorate of River Basin Management, Directorate General of Water Resources, Ministry of Public Works:[http://www.adb.org/water/narbo/2005/training-program/paper-anshori-narbo-training.pdf Basin Water Resources Management and Organization in Indonesia], ca. 2005, retrieved on October 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Relevant implementing regulations include Government Act No.16/2005 "on the development of the water supply system", which allows private sector participation in water supply; two decrees by the Ministry of Public Works from 2006 and 2007 to establish a National Water Board; and the Ministry of Home Affairs Decree No. 23/2006 on guidelines for water tariff setting. The latter stipulates that tariffs should fully recover costs including a rate of return of 10 percent. The decree No.47/1999 of the Ministry of Home Affairs on guidelines for evaluating the performance of water service providers (benchmarking) has now lost some of its teeth because of the subsequent decentralization policy. Decrees by the Ministry of Health as well as the Ministry of Industry and Trade regulate the quality of bottled water, as well as for water kiosks that refill large water bottles.&lt;ref name="Hadipuro"/&gt;

===Service provision===

==== Urban areas ====
The provision of water services in urban areas is the responsibility of PDAMs (Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum), Local Government Owned Water Utilities. There are 319 PDAMs in Indonesia. Two (Jakarta and North Sumatra) operate at provincial government level. All others operate at district government level, meaning at the level of a regency (of which there are 349) or a city (of which there are 91) (see [[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia]])&lt;ref&gt;Amrta Institute for Water Literacy, Indonesia:[http://www.waterjustice.org/uploads/attachments/104pdf.pdf Public-Public Partnerships in Indonesia], ca. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Most PDAM are very small, with less than 10 000 connections: only four per cent have more than 50 000 connections.&lt;ref name="AusAID Evaluation"/&gt; Institutional responsibility for wastewater and sewerage is at the district government level; departmental responsibility varies between districts. Very few urban utilities provide sanitation services. Sanitation utilities are called PD-PAL or Local Government Owned Wastewater Utilities.

Some smaller PDAMs have associated themselves under Public-Private Partnerships. The first such partnership was created under the provincial government of North Sumatra in 1999, involving six PDAMs led by the utility in Tirtanadi. Another partnership of 11 PDAMs was established in Eastern Indonesia together with the Dutch water company WMD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Amrta Institute for Water Literacy  Indonesia|title=Public-Public Partnerships in Indonesia|url=http://www.waterjustice.org/uploads/attachments/104pdf.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2012|date=c. 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, 29 localities had signed contracts with private companies to operate, and sometimes also to finance, their water infrastructure. The largest contracts are two concession contracts in Jakarta (see [[Water privatization in Jakarta]]). Most other contracts are relatively small with water sales of less than 100,000 cubic meter per day. In some cases they are management contracts without investment responsibilities, such as in Panaikang-Massakar in Sulawesi. In many cases, the private companies also partly finance infrastructure, such as a water treatment plant, under [[Build Operate Transfer]] contracts. This is the case in Medan in North Sumatra and Bandung in West Java. The private partners are mostly Indonesian companies, such as the property developer Bakrieland or the water company Acuatico, or foreign companies such as the Singapore-based engineering company Moya Asia. The central government promotes public-private partnerships in water supply through guarantees and partial subsidies. However, as of 2011 many PPP projects had to be cancelled because of the difficulty of negotiating the terms between the central, regional and local governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Global Water Intelligence|title=Reading Indonesia’s split-level PPP market|url=http://www.globalwaterintel.com/archive/13/4/general/reading-indonesias-split-level-ppp-market.html|work=Vol 13, Issue 4|accessdate=21 April 2012|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utilities are associated in Perpamsi, the national association of water utilities created in 1972. The association has 394 member companies that serve 24% of the population of Indonesia. In 2003 Perpamsi initiated a performance [[benchmarking]] program with support from the [[World Bank]]. The data base currently contains 115 Water Utilities (PDAM) in Indonesia, including most of the larger ones.&lt;ref name="Perpamsi Benchmarking"&gt;{{cite web|last=Perpamsi|title=Indonesian Water Supply Association Perpamsi - Profile|url=http://perpamsi.or.id/gallery/document/PROFIL%20FOR%20WEB.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rural areas====
[[Image:Air bersih.jpg|thumb|250px|Springs, such as this one in Batu Karut in the Sukabumi regency on Java, are an important source of water in rural areas of Indonesia]]
Rural Indonesia has a long history of community-managed water supply services using naturally occurring springs, rainwater and groundwater sources. However, community capacities to sustain such water systems over long periods have tended to be limited. Past rural water supply and sanitation projects have often not invested sufficiently in building community capacity to plan, implement, operate and maintain services in ways that benefit and satisfy all sections of rural societies, conditions necessary for service sustainability. Rural consumers have not consistently been offered voice and choice in decisions related to establishing and managing services and paying for them. Services have often been provided in a top-down manner by agencies external to the community, using public sector or donor funds and contractors answerable to government agencies rather than to the users of services. This has led to mismatches between what the users want and get, a lack of community ownership of rural water supply and sanitation facilities and unclear responsibilities for maintenance.&lt;ref name="World Bank, Annex 1"/&gt;

In 2003 the government endorsed, but did not adopt a National Policy for the Development of Community-Managed Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation Facilities and Services that provides a  road map for sector reform, by:
* Changing the policy goals for the sector, from achieving "coverage targets" counted in terms of construction of systems facilities, to the twin goals of sustainability and effective use of water supply and sanitation services;
* Espousing strategies such as empowerment of communities to choose, co-finance, construct and manage and own their water systems;
* Requiring the use of [[gender]]-and poverty-sensitive approaches in working with and empowering user communities to ensure poverty targeting and impact on local poverty;
* Building stakeholders' understanding at all levels concerning service sustainability;
* Measuring success in terms of sustained population access to services, and effective use of those  services, i.e. hygienic and health - promoting use of services by all sections of communities and improved sanitation and hygiene behaviors among various age-sex groups of the population.&lt;ref name="World Bank, Annex 1"/&gt;

The community participation and cost recovery under the new approach has led to greater sustainability of services. For example, an evaluation of a Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project supported by the Asian Development Bank that did not yet use the new approach revealed that less than four years after project completion, only 30 per cent of the water supply facilities and 30 per cent of sanitation facilities constructed by the project were still functioning. However, according to a Ministry of Health report that reviewed the functionality of water infrastructure in five districts that had implemented the World Bank-supported WSLIC project from 2001 to 2006, the average functionality of public taps was 72 per cent. The significant differences in functionality between the ADB and WSLIC activities has been largely attributed to the participation of communities in the construction of infrastructure and the communities recovering monthly fees to cover maintenance costs of water and sanitation systems.&lt;ref name="AusAID Evaluation"/&gt;

However, in peri-urban areas or rural areas that are increasingly absorbed in urban conglomerations, community management alone may not be an adequate arrangement. According to the World Bank, newer models of support and responsibility sharing between user communities and local governments or local private sector agencies are needed.&lt;ref name="World Bank, Annex 1"/&gt;

=== Civil society ===

Civil society groups, both local and international, play a vital role in the sector. Some are implementing water and sanitation programs in districts that have not yet received any form of government support in the sector. Despite their diversity, most are harmonised in their approach. Very few, however, work through government systems. Other civil society groups, including religious leaders in village communities, play a significant role in the success of community-based approaches. Religious leaders support community cohesion and influence and encourage clean and healthy behaviours to complement water and sanitation infrastructure.&lt;ref name="AusAID Evaluation"/&gt;

==History and recent developments==
[[Image: Central Jakarta.JPG|thumb|250px|The water supply of Jakarta has been privatized since 1997 through two 25-year concession contracts]]

The first water utilities in Indonesia, called PDAM after their Indonesian acronym, were set up during the colonial period at the beginning of the 20th century. Following independence in 1945 they became part of local government. In the 1970s the central government became more involved in their financing and management. In 1987 a government act nominally handed water supply back to local governments, but in reality central government remained very involved. Only after the fall of [[Suharto]] in 1998 a serious effort at decentralization was made with the local government law of 1999 that effectively handed over responsibility for water supply to local governments.&lt;ref name="Hadipuro"/&gt;

{{See also|Water privatization in Indonesia}}

'''Jakarta privatization'''. In June 1997 two 25-year water [[concession (contract)|concession]]s were awarded without bidding to serve the city of [[Jakarta]] beginning in February 1998. A subsidiary of The French firm Ondeo (now [[Suez (company)|Suez]]), called Palyja, was awarded the concession for the western part of the city and a subsidiary of the British firm [[Thames Water]] International called TPJ was awarded a concession for the eastern part.

'''Policy for rural water supply and sanitation'''. In 2003 the government adopted a National Policy for the Development of Community-Managed Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation Facilities and Services that provides a clear route map for sector reform (for details see above).

==Efficiency==
[[Non-revenue water]] (NRW) in Indonesia’s best utilities stands at only 20%, while the worst quartile of utilities participating in Perpamsi’s benchmarking exercise have NRW of 43%. However, NRW data is generally unreliable as many PDAMs do not have meters installed to accurately measure NRW. In terms of labor productivity, the best performing utilities have a staff ratio of 4 per 1000 connections, while utilities in the worst quartile have more than 9 staff per 1000 connections.&lt;ref name="Perpamsi Benchmarking"/&gt; Labor productivity for water utilities is considered to be at acceptable levels if it is below 5 per 1000 connections. In Jakarta the level of non-revenue water was 51% in 2001, one of the highest levels in Indonesia. However, in terms of labor productivity the two utilities in Jakarta fare relatively well with only 5.3 employees per 1000 connections.&lt;ref name="Jakarta ADB 2001"/&gt;

==Cost recovery and tariffs==
The Ministry of Home Affairs Decree No. 23/2006 sets out a policy of full cost recovery through tariff revenues for water utilities. The decree prescribes an increasing-block [[water tariff]] with a first subsidized tariff block for a consumption of up to 10 cubic meters per household, and a break-even tariff for higher consumption. Commercial and industrial users can be charged higher tariffs with higher blocks at the full-cost tariff. However, in reality, few utilities recover their costs. According to a 2005 study by the Department of Public Works, most PDAMs faced financial problems. Only about a third increased tariffs between 1998 and 2005. One third of utilities had foreign debt, whose value in local currency increased substantially due to the devaluation of the rupeeh in the 1998 financial crisis.&lt;ref name="Hadipuro"/&gt; Many PDAMs defaulted on loans they had received from the Ministry of Finance. As of 2009 renegotiation of these loans (principal, interest and penalties) was still underway, thus cutting off the utilities from new government loans.&lt;ref name="Woodman"&gt;USAID Environmental Services Program / Development Alternatives Inc. , by David Woodward :[http://www.esp.or.id/wp-content/uploads/pdf/report/water-financing-in-indonesia.pdf Water Sector Financing in Indonesia:The Policy Environment and Legal Framework], December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Indonesia bike11.JPG|thumb|250px|Water sold by vendors is much more expensive than piped water. Sometimes water is transported by bike]]
According to the Asian Development Bank, in Jakarta the average tariff in 2001 (average of residential and commercial users) was US$ 0.29/m3, compared to production costs estimated at only US$ 0.11/m3. 98% of revenues billed were collected. According to these figures, at least the Jakarta utility managed to recover its costs.&lt;ref name="Jakarta ADB 2001"/&gt; Since then tariffs have been increased several times and, according to the International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities, reached US$ 0.77/m3.&lt;ref name="IBNET Tariff"&gt;International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities:[http://www.ib-net.org/en/tariffs_map.php World Tariffs Map:Jakarta], accessed on October 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

As in many other countries, those not connected to water supply networks pay the most for water. A survey in North [[Jakarta]] found the price of water in the early 1990s was $2.62/m3 for vendor customers, $1.26/m3 for standpipe customers, $1.08/m3 for household resales customers, and only $0.18/m3 for connected households.&lt;ref&gt;Crane, Randall, "Water Markets, Water Reform, and the Urban Poor: Results from Jakarta, Indonesia", World Development, Vol. 22, No. 1, (1994). P. 71-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investment and Financing==

The water and sanitation sector is not given a high priority at the national or sub-national level, partly because of competing priorities from other sectors such as health and education. Few local governments use their own resources to implement water and sanitation activities and when given funding through open-menu infrastructure programs, local governments and communities rarely choose water and sanitation as the main activity. Most funding for the sector comes from the national level and the level of sub-national funding is often hidden as it occurs in several government departments. Funding estimates for the sector in 2008 were around one to two per cent of local government budgets.&lt;ref name="AusAID Evaluation"/&gt;

'''Public investment'''. Total infrastructure spending in Indonesia was 55 trillion Rupiah in 2005 (US$ 5.7 billion). These expenditures were financed mainly by the local (23 trillion Rupiah) and central government (also 23 trillion Rupiah), followed by the provincial government (9 trillion Rupiah). Infrastructure investment stood at 10% of total government expenditures, as shown in the Table below.

While it is not entirely clear how much of this sum has been invested in water supply and sanitation, the ADB estimates that only US$ 124m per year (average of 2004-2005) from the regular national budget were allocated to water supply and sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.org/Documents/Events/2006/WFP-Conference/Country-Highlights-INO.pdf ADB] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216095034/http://www.adb.org/Documents/Events/2006/WFP-Conference/Country-Highlights-INO.pdf |date=December 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since decentralization in the year 2001, local Governments have typically invested less than 2% of their annual budgets on water supply, even less on sanitation and almost nothing on improving hygiene practices.&lt;ref name="World Bank, Annex 1"/&gt; Assuming that 2% of local government (provincial and district) budgets are spent on water and sanitation, local government investments in water and sanitation were 3.6 trillion Rupiah or US$375m or about three times higher than the US$124m financed through the central budget. Total investments thus can be very tentatively estimated at about US$500m, or slightly more than what has been estimated by one source as the required investments to meet the [[MDG]]s, or US$450 million per year&lt;ref name="US Embassy"&gt;US Embassy in Indonesia:[http://www.usembassyjakarta.org/press_rel/US_PDAM.html The U.S. and Indonesia to Collaborate on Water Utility Financing], September 22, 2006. Retrieved March 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; At about US$2 per capita and year these investments still remain far lower than investments in water and sanitation in other middle-income countries.

The economic crisis of the late 1990s had severely curtailed investment in infrastructure. Central government spending on development dropped from US$14 billion in 1994 to US$5 billion in 2002, within which the share of infrastructure spending further declined from 57 to 30% over the same period. Moreover, according to the World Bank, poor institutional and regulatory frameworks and rampant corruption in the infrastructure sector, which were prevalent even before the crisis, continued without serious sector reform efforts by the government until today.&lt;ref name="World Bank, Annex 1"/&gt;

'''Utility financing'''. Loan financing to PDAMs faces numerous challenges. For example, the Ministry of Finance requires its loans to be channeled through regional governments whose legislatures have to pledge future central government transfers as collateral. Since regional legislatures are reluctant to do so, central government lending to utilities is not likely to re-emerge even after the issue of old debt would be settled. Two efforts at promoting the issuing of corporate bonds by creditworthy utilities, one supported by partial guarantees by [[USAID]] and the other by [[KfW]], have failed "because of the risk-averse culture which is so pervasive in Indonesian central and regional governments", according to a USAID report. Under a 2009 Presidential decree, however, state banks can provide partial credit guarantees of 70% of loans to creditworthy PDAMs plus an interest subsidy. As for direct lending by the Ministry of Finance, regional governments have to provide partial guarantees for these loans, which they are reluctant to provide.&lt;ref name="Woodman"/&gt;

Thus PDAMs are likely to be limited in their access to finance largely to grants, which are scarce. In 2009 there were three primary sources of national government grant funding for water supply:
* Matching grants (hibah) to regional governments. Water supply is expected to receive Rp 3 trillion of hibah from the national budget between 2010 and 2014, complemented by funds from external donors.
* a Special Allocations Fund (DAK), which accounted for 2.4% of the national budget in 2009, of which about 5% were directed towards the water supply sector, especially village community-based systems.
* Grants by the Ministry of Public Works for raw water supply and treatment.&lt;ref name="Woodman"/&gt;

'''Microfinance'''. [[Bank Negara Indonesia]] provides small loans to community-based organizations (CBOs) engaged in water supply in Java. The pilot project is part of a national program called Kredit Usaha Rakyat that provides  loans for community and small scale enterprises. The World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program in collaboration with the [[AusAID]]-funded Indonesia Infrastructure Initiative (INDII), the Ministry of Public Works, and Directorate of Public Private Partnership Development of the National Development Planning Agency provide technical assistance to the CBOs.

==External cooperation==
External support to the water and sanitation sector in Indonesia is provided through multilateral (World Bank, Asian Development Bank and UN) as well as bilateral cooperation with individual countries. Most external partners have focused their cooperation on rural areas, or work exclusively there. Most of the support for urban areas comes from Japan, the Netherlands and the United States.&lt;ref name="AusAID Evaluation"/&gt;

===Multilateral cooperation===
'''Asian Development Bank'''. The Community Water Services and Health Project, approved in 2005, aimed at providing clean water and sanitation facilities to about 1,500 communities of rural Indonesia, including tsunami-affected areas. The Directorate General of Communicable Disease Control and Environmental Health of the Ministry of Health is the executing agency of the project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.org/news/adb-bringing-clean-water-and-sanitation-rural-indonesia-and-tsunami-affected-areas ADB Bringing Clean Water and Sanitation to Rural Indonesia and Tsunami-Affected Areas], 7 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

'''UNICEF'''. [[UNICEF]] supports the Indonesian government in developing and implementing strategies that improve drinking water and sanitation conditions across the country. UNICEF also assists the government in improving relevant planning mechanisms, monitoring systems and databases.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF:[http://www.unicef.org/indonesia/wes_2880.html Our response - Water &amp; Environmental Sanitation]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Bank'''. The [[World Bank]]'s Third Water Supply and Sanitation for Low Income communities Project, approved in 2006, aims to increase the number of low-income rural and peri-urban populations accessing improved water and sanitation facilities and practicing improved hygiene behaviors. The project supports community driven development (CDD) planning and management of water, sanitation and hygiene improvement programs, builds stakeholder commitment and aims to expand the capacity of central, provincial and district government agencies. It provides participating communities with a menu of technical options for rural water supply and public sanitation infrastructure. The project is implemented by the Ministry of Health.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank:
[http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&amp;piPK=73230&amp;theSitePK=40941&amp;menuPK=228424&amp;Projectid=P085375 Third Water Supply and Sanitation for Low Income Communities Project], approved on 27 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) focuses particularly on knowledge management and strategy development in sanitation. Between 2006 and 2010 WSP, with funding from Sweden and the Netherlands, generated increased political commitment for sanitation and increased the national government's capacity for sanitation planning through the "Indonesia Sanitation Sector Development Program" (ISSDP). This led to a coherent policy framework for urban sanitation, under which substantial investments are being undertaken from 2010 onwards.&lt;ref name="WSP 2011"/&gt;

===Bilateral cooperation===

'''Australia'''. Australia has supported efforts to improve rural water supply and sanitation in Indonesia, particularly Eastern Indonesia, for almost 30 years. [[AusAID]]'s support is in the form of grants for technical assistance to the Water Supply and Sanitation Policy Formulation and Action Planning Project (WASPOL) of the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program (WSP), as well as to the Second Water and Sanitation for Low-Income Communities program (WSLIC2), also funded mainly by the World Bank. A 2009 evaluation by the Australian government concluded that Australian aid to the water sector "has been strategic, flexible and appropriate" and has assisted in "providing sustainable piped-water supply to some 4.6 million people and has dramatically improved sector coordination at national and sub national levels." The evaluation also noted that there has been much less focus on sanitation, although the Government has begun to replicate the innovative [[Community-Led Total Sanitation]] approach in an attempt to achieve open defecation free (ODF) communities. The report also noted that a "national working group established through WASPOLA has strengthened government capacity in research, communications, marketing and public relations", but that these approaches are less well integrated at the sub-national level. It also notes that "despite its relatively low funding for this sector compared to that of some other donors and multilateral agencies, Australia is seen as a lead donor." It also notes that AusAID-supported technical assistance has "relied heavily on external consultants and have not built enough technical capacity into government to ensure sustainability." Female participation at the local level was mandatory in the project, but once project handover occurred women’s participation often dropped. The community-managed approach "enhanced transparency and accountability", but districts are not using this model in their own projects due to lack of capacity and political will.&lt;ref name="AusAID Evaluation"&gt;Australian Government, AusAID, Office of Development Effeciveness, Working Paper 2:[http://www.ode.ausaid.gov.au/publications/pdf/ODEWATSANIndonesiaWorkingPaper.pdf INDONESIA. INDEPENDENT EVALUATION OF AUSTRALIAN AID TO WATER SUPPLY ANDSANITATION SERVICE DELIVERY IN EAST TIMOR AND INDONESIA], December 2009, retrieved on October 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canada'''. [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]] Canada and the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA) support the CARE-Sulawesi Rural Community Development Project (SRCD). CARE uses the "community management approach", by which communities are heavily involved right from the very beginning, from the design through construction, implementation, operation and maintenance. The approach works by establishing a village water committee and a series of sub-committees: for example, sanitation, construction and finance. The village itself decides how it will raise the amount of money needed for its contribution to the project. This is usually done by monthly levy whereby each family contributes a small amount of money over the course of four to six months. The village construction committee also organizes the labour to install the system. All the labour is done manually without the use of heavy machinery, which means a low environmental impact and lower cost. With water close at hand, most households are also building their own simple latrines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acdi-cida.gc.ca/CIDAWEB/acdicida.nsf/En/STE-320162235-T7L CIDA]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Netherlands'''. The public Dutch water company Water Supply Company Drenthe (WMD) and Dutch development aid support various water companies in Eastern Indonesia. Joint venture contracts have been concluded with four companies (Ambon, Bacau ([[Maluku (province)|Maluku]]), [[Biak]], Sorong ([[Irian Jaya]]/Papua). Negotiations are going on with seven other companies in North [[Sulawesi]], [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]] and [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]]. The WMD has reserved 3.4 million euros for the project.&lt;ref&gt;Water Supply Company Drenthe (WMD):[http://www.wmd.nl/english/projects/Indonesia/index.html Water for Indonesia]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United States'''. Since early 2005 [[USAID]] has provided technical assistance to water utilities (PDAMs) in Java and Sumatra on issues related to full cost recovery tariffs and improved technical operation, with the objective of improving their creditworthiness and ability to borrow to meet network expansion needs. USAID is also looking at ways to use its partial credit guarantee mechanism to further increase local water utilities’ access to commercial financing.&lt;ref name="US Embassy"/&gt;
