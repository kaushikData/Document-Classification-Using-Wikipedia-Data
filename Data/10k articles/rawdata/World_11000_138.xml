==Points and prize money==
===Points distribution===
Because the Monte Carlo Masters is the non-mandatory [[Masters 1000]] event, special rules regarding points distribution are in place. The Monte Carlo Masters counts as one of a player's 500 level tournaments, while distributing Masters 1000 points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atpworldtour.com/Rankings/Rankings-FAQ.aspx#requirements Ranking points]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Africa One''' was a privately owned pan-African airline.  It was initially based in [[Entebbe]], [[Uganda]], with aircraft [[wet lease]]d from '''Africa One Holdings''', registered in [[Ireland]]. '''Africa One Congo''' was a subsidiary based in [[Kinshasa]].  It is not clear if the same airline or another of the same name was the operator of the [[An-26]] that crashed with high fatality numbers in the DRC in 2007, but most likely it was operated by the company's Congolese subsidiary, because soon after the incident its operations shut down. '''Africa One''' operated in years 2002-2004 and '''Africa One Congo''' operated in years 2002-2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerotransport.org ''www.aerotransport.org'' World Airline Databank] retrieved 2010-09-06&lt;/ref&gt;

The airline is on the [[List of air carriers banned in the European Union]].

==History==
&lt;!-- 
[[Sudan]]'s New Vision reported that AfricaOne, a Ugandan carrier, suspended operations on the Entebbe-Nairobi route in January 2003, but flights to [[Dar-es-Salaam]], [[Kilimanjaro]] and [[Dubai]], continued.

The AfricaOne country manager for Kenya, Ada Magezi told ''New Vision'' that the flights to Kenya would resume in a week's time.

She said passengers who had booked their flights were passed on to the East Africa Airlines.

AfricaOne was a joint venture between Dairo Air Services (DAS) of Uganda with entrepreneurs from [[Tanzania]] and [[Nigeria]].

&lt;ref&gt;Africaone Stops Flights to Kenya ''Commercial Aviation Today'' 2003-01-31&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

&lt;!-- 
Following paraphrased:
[[Boeing Capital Corporation]] repossessed two McDonnell Douglas DC-9s from AfricaOne in April 2003.  The customer finance arm of the US manufacturer had leased the two aircraft to AfricaOne as well as providing financing for the airline which launched operations in the spring last year. A BCC spokesman says: "From our perspective we have terminated leases for two DC-9s and the aeroplanes have been recovered and we are busy looking for new lessees."  BCC has never revealed its investment in AfricaOne but says that it is "seeking to recover some of the lost revenue" from the airline. The company says it secured its investment into AfricaOne against an aircraft.

The carrier operated flights from Entebbe to Dubai, and to Dar es Salaam and Kilimanjaro with its DC-9s. It had planned to launch flights to Lagos, Nigeria with its McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 aircraft shortly. In February 2003 it suspended service from Entebbe to Nairobi citing losses on the route.  At that time, AfricaOne was owned by a Tanzania investor and Uganda company DAS Air Services.

The aircraft were provided by Ireland registered AfricaOne Holdings to the airline on an ACMI (aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance) basis. UK based businessman and [[DAS Air Cargo]] CEO [[Charles Heather]] took on the CEO role of Africa One Holdings while DAS Air Cargo chairman Capt Joe Roy became chairman of AfricaOne Holdings. Both are also joint shareholders in the holding company.

A "winding up petition" was presented to the High Court in Ireland on 14 March 2003.

DAS Air Cargo CFO David Fisher speaking regarding the concept of Irish service company AfricaOne says: "The AfricaOne concept is a great concept where you have a service company providing aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance to all the African operators. In order for it to succeed, it needs more than one operator and that is why the African One concept failed."  He adds that DAS Air Cargo continues to operate as an independent cargo company serving Africa and that it is separate from AfricaOne.

'''''At the Back of the Black Man's Mind''''' is a book by [[R.E. Dennett|Richard Edward Dennett]] published in 1906.  It provides many details on the [[folklore]], culture, and religion of the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] and [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]].  However, many of its characterizations would today be considered [[colonialism|colonialist]] or [[racism|racist]].  Also, it provides many theories about the facts presented which are incorrect or irrelevant.

The '''Cernavodă culture''', ca. [[4th millennium BC|4000]]—[[32nd century BC|3200]] BC, was a late [[chalcolithic|Copper Age]] [[archaeological culture]]. It was along the lower Eastern [[Southern Bug|Bug River]] and [[Danube]] and along the coast of the [[Black Sea]] and somewhat inland, generally in present-day [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]]. It is named after the Romanian town of [[Cernavodă]].

It is a successor to and occupies much the same area as the earlier [[neolithic]] [[Karanovo culture]], for which a [[destruction layer|destruction horizon]] seems to be evident. It is part of the "''Balkan-Danubian complex''" that stretches up the entire length of the river and into northern Germany via the [[Elbe]] and the [[Baden culture]]; its northeastern portion is thought to be ancestral to the [[Usatovo culture]].

It is characterized by [[hill fort|defensive hilltop settlements]]. The pottery shares traits with that found further east {{which|date=November 2017}} on the south-west [[Eurasian steppe]];{{cn|date=November 2017}}  burials similarly bear a resemblance to those further east.

The '''Codex Wormianus''' or '''AM 242 fol.''' is an Icelandic [[vellum]] [[codex]] dating from the mid-14th century. It contains an edition of the [[Prose Edda]] and some additional material on poetics, including the [[First Grammatical Treatise]]. It is the only manuscript to preserve the [[Rígsþula]].

The manuscript is believed to have been written in the [[Benedictine]] monastery [[Þingeyraklaustur]] in [[Thingeyri|Þingeyrar]] in northern [[Iceland]] around 1350. It was obtained by the runologist [[Ole Worm]] from the Icelandic scholar [[Arngrímur Jónsson]] in 1628, according to an inscription on the first page of the work. In 1706, [[Árni Magnússon]] obtained the document from Ole Worm's nephew, Christian Worm.&lt;ref name="kuepages"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.e-pages.dk/ku/621/ | title=AM 242 fol., Codex Wormianus | publisher=[[University of Copenhagen]] | accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it remains part of the [[Arnamagnæan Manuscript Collection]] at the [[Arnamagnæan Institute]] in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The '''Corteno''' or {{lang|it|'''Pecora di Corteno'''}} is a [[breed]] of [[sheep]] from the [[Val Camonica]], in the [[province of Brescia]] in [[Lombardy]], northern Italy.&lt;ref name=dad/&gt; It is raised in the [[comune]] of [[Corteno Golgi]], from which it takes its name, and in the neighbouring comuni of [[Edolo]], [[Malonno]] and [[Paisco Loveno]], all lying within the [[Comunità Montana di Valle Camonica]].&lt;ref name=rare/&gt;&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt; It is one of the forty-two autochthonous local sheep breeds of limited distribution for which a herdbook is kept by the [[Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia]], the Italian national association of sheep-breeders.&lt;ref name=aspa/&gt;

==History==

The origin of the Corteno breed is unknown, but is probably shared with that of other lop-eared breeds of the Alpine region such as the [[Bergamasca (sheep)|Bergamasca]], the [[Biellese]] and the [[Lamon (sheep)|Lamon]]. Numbers were estimated at 4000 in 1983, and at about 1600 in 1995.&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt; In 2006 the total number was estimated at 1500, of which 131 were registered in the herdbook.&lt;ref name=rare2/&gt; The conservation status of the breed was listed as "critical" by the [[FAO]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=barb/&gt; In 2013 the number registered for the breed was 295.&lt;ref name=aspa2/&gt;

==Use==

The meat of the Corteno is exceptionally fatty. It is traditionally used to produce Cuz, a local type of preserved meat. Whole carcases of [[Domestic sheep|wether]] [[mutton]] are boiled in a cauldron for five or six hours with salt and a little water; the meat is then put up in [[terracotta]] jars with more salt and sealed with the mutton-fat.&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt;

'''David Margolese''' (born October 24, 1957) is an entrepreneur and a founder of [[Sirius XM Radio]],&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Adelson, [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/30/business/media-satellite-radio-s-bet-on-dissatisfied-listeners.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm “Satellite Radio’s Bet on Dissatisfied Listeners,”] ''[[New York Times]]'', July 30, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; serving as chairman and CEO from 1993 to 2002.&lt;ref name="mwolff"&gt;Michael Wolff, [http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/media/columns/medialife/3823/ “Cruise Control,”] ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', September 25, 2000, pp. 30-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Considered "one of the earliest advocates of pay radio,"&lt;ref name="pfarhi"&gt;Paul Farhi, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1997/05/19/music-from-the-spheres/232253c7-c57c-4681-aac7-5ca0ef95dd6a/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.c8616da0b441 “Music From the Spheres,”] ''[[Washington Post]]'', May 19, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; he "effectively created the industry."&lt;ref name="shoupt"&gt;Simon Houpt, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/radio-flyer/article18417805/ "Radio Flyer,"] ''[[Report on Business|Report On Business Magazine]]'', September 2001, pp. 14-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Margolese was born and raised in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="shoupt"/&gt; He attended the [[University of British Columbia]], dropping out after one year.&lt;ref name="shoupt"/&gt; His father, Leonard, also dropped out of college, to sell television sets in the early 1950s, ultimately building a successful television store.&lt;ref name="shoupt"/&gt;

==Cellular==

===Rogers Wireless===
In 1978, at the age of 20, Margolese founded Canadian Telecom, a Vancouver-based radio paging company.&lt;ref name="bmclean"&gt;Bethany McLean, [http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2001/01/22/295563/index.htm “Satellite Killed The Radio Star,”] ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', January 22, 2001, pp. 94-100.&lt;/ref&gt; He struggled in his early years as an entrepreneur.&lt;ref name="shoupt"/&gt; In 1980, he changed his company’s focus to what would become the future cellular market. He prognosticated in his 1980 position paper, years before the commercial introduction of cellular and at a time when computers were in use by less than one percent of the public, that cellular "has the potential to become all pervasive." He also envisioned that it would "be used for much more" than just phone calls.&lt;ref name="cvanhasselt"&gt;Caroline Van Hasselt, [https://books.google.co.il/books?id=Wt8ulI7RV9oC&amp;pg=PT247&amp;lpg=PT247&amp;dq=has+the+potential+to+become+all+pervasive+and+high+wire+act+and+carolyn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0SqsFCreXi&amp;sig=INNHDPze4EOgQnwaxBKs4XHdwcI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiDyMaE7pDeAhURKuwKHeFGBcEQ6AEwAHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=has%20the%20potential%20to%20become%20all%20pervasive%20and%20high%20wire%20act%20and%20carolyn&amp;f=false ''High Wire Act: Ted Rogers and the Empire That Debt Built''], Mississauga, Ontario: [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], 2008, Chapters 12 and 14.&lt;/ref&gt; When cell phones became widely available, it paid big dividends for Margolese.&lt;ref name="kbachman"&gt;Katy Bachman, "Space Invaders: The Next Wave," ''[[Mediaweek]]'', April 12, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wallstreetj"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bary |first1=Andrew |title=Siren Song |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB882600175119294500 |publisher=''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' |date=22 December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; His company joined with [[Rogers Communications]] to form Cantel (a contraction of the name Canadian Telecom). Cantel would ultimately become [[Rogers Wireless]],&lt;ref name="bmclean"/&gt; as of 2012 the largest cellular company in Canada, with over 9.3 million subscribers and revenues over $7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hardy, [http://mobilesyrup.com/2012/07/24/rogers-q2-2012-wireless-subscriber-base-reaches-9351-million-revenue-increases-1/ “Rogers Q2 2012: Wireless subscriber base reaches 9.351 million, revenue increases 1%,”] Mobile Syrup, July 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Thompson, [http://www.digitalhome.ca/2011/02/rogers-reports-year-end-results/ “Rogers reports year end results,”] Digital Home, February 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Margolese cashed out of the company in 1989 to found his next venture.&lt;ref name="bmclean"/&gt;

==Satellite radio==

===Sirius XM Radio===

The primary obstacle faced by CD Radio and then Sirius was resistance from the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), who were under pressure from the [[National Association of Broadcasters]], who felt threatened by the competition.&lt;ref name="pfarhi"/&gt; In 1997, the FCC granted both CD Radio and [[XM Satellite Radio]] licenses to use a part of the [[S band|S-band spectrum]], costing CD Radio $83 million.&lt;ref name="shoupt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bmclean"/&gt;

In 1999, Margolese changed the name of CD Radio to [[Sirius Satellite Radio]], so as not to be identified with the outdated technology of compact discs.&lt;ref name="swarren"&gt;Steve Warren, [https://books.google.com/books?id=s0jSxLqs-TwC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;lpg=PA166&amp;dq=david+margolese+nasa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WpFylu92uc&amp;sig=plcaG60sXIDezHp2OcZs5CR6zbA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=apQmUPbzKeTZ6wGg5oHAAw&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20margolese%20nasa&amp;f=false ''Radio: The Book''], 4th Edition, Burlington, MA: [[Focal Press]], 2005, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Margolese raised $1.8 billion to launch Sirius.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Jordan, [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1452145/ins-outs-satellite-radio.jhtml “For More And More Music Fans, Satellite Radio Is Heaven Sent,”] [[MTV.com]], February 5, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Dillon, [https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-79186364.html “CEO Leaves New York Satellite Radio Company,”] ''[[New York Daily News]]'', October 17, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the money was obtained by gaining exclusive rights from [[Ford]], [[Chrysler]], [[BMW]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]] to feature Sirius in their automobiles.&lt;ref name="mwolff"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Graeber, [https://www.wired.com/2001/02/radio-star-rising/ “Radio Star Rising,”] ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', February 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Deutscher Verband''' was a coalition of bourgeois German speaking  political parties that was formed in [[South Tyrol]] in 1919 after the region was annexed by Italy. It was a merger of the Catholic [[Tiroler Volkspartei]] and the liberal nationalist [[Deutschfreiheitliche Partei]]. The German speaking [[Social Democrats]], for their part, joined with the [[Italian Socialist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Othmar Parteli: ''Südtirol (1918–1970)'', in: ''Geschichte des Landes Tirol.'' Band 4/2. Athesia, Bozen 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Italian general election, 1921]] the coalition won 90% of the vote and  elected all four of the deputies that were allotted to the region. The first leader of the Deutscher Verband was [[Eduard Reut-Nicolussi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.andreas-hofer-bund.de/sandwirtsbrief_1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 he was replaced by the lawyer [[Karl Tinzl]]. The most important press organ of the DV, until its prohibition, was the ''[[Tiroler]]'' (after 1923, ''[[Der Landsmann]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Stefan Lechner|EditorSurname1= [[Hannes Obermair]], Stephanie Risse, [[Carlo Romeo (Historiker, 1962)|Carlo Romeo]]|Periodical=Regionale Zivilgesellschaft in Bewegung.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DV as banned along with the rest of the non-Fascist parties in 1926. After 1945, the political tradition of the DV was continued by the [[South Tyrolean People's Party]], which had the same leaders, and also used the [[edelweiss]] as its election symbol.

In June 2016 Pickett and Blanchflower left, and the remaining members of the Economic Advisory Committee announced they had decided to postpone any further meetings, in the wake of the resignation of numerous members of the [[Shadow Cabinet of Jeremy Corbyn|Shadow Cabinet]] in protest over [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s leadership.

==Membership==
The committee originally consisted of seven members, described by then ''[[BBC News]]'' Economics Editor [[Robert Peston]] as, "some of the world's most influential left-wing economists".&lt;ref name="BBC02"&gt;{{cite web |last=Peston |first=Robert |title=Corbynomics' Thatcher moment |publisher=''[[BBC News]]'' |date=27 September 2015 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34376085 |accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Simon Wren-Lewis]], Professor, [[University of Oxford]]

The inclusion of Piketty and Stilgitz was seen as a particular coup for the Labour Party leadership due to their breakthrough success in mainstream publishing,&lt;ref name="BI01"&gt;{{cite web |last=Williams-Grut |first=Oscar |title=Meet the team shaping the Labour Party's 'New Economics'

Following the formation of the committee, Economics Editors [[Robert Peston]], then of ''[[BBC News]]'', and Chris Giles, of the ''[[Financial Times]]'', confirmed that the seven members were unified in their opposition to the spending cuts of [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[George Osborne]],&lt;ref name="FT01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC02" /&gt; although the latter warned that they had less in common in other areas.&lt;ref name="FT01" /&gt;

==History==

===Formation===
Regarding the formation of the committee, its convener, [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] later stated, as part of a series of public debates to present his Party's "New Economics", that the Economic Advisory Committee had initially been set up to conduct reviews into public institutions including [[HM Treasury]], the [[Monetary Policy Committee]] and [[HM Revenue and Customs]], and that it was due to the surprising number of people at the [[Labour Party (UK) Conference#2015 Brighton|2015 Labour Party Conference in Brighton]]  who felt the Labour Party should be an anti-austerity party that the policy of anti-austerity was set.&lt;ref name="Ind01"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sheffield |first=Hazel |title=Labour's economic policy will rest on two watchwords: democracy and decentralisation, John McDonnell says |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' |date=17 February 2016 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/labours-economic-policy-will-rest-on-two-watchwords-democracy-and-decentralisation-john-mcdonnell-a6878576.html |accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Committee member [[David Blanchflower]], who confirmed he was undertaking an independent review of the Bank of England for the shadow chancellor, had however stated that opposition to austerity on its own was not enough and that it would take some time to produce a coherent new economic strategy that party members share.&lt;ref name="NS02"&gt;{{cite web |last=Blanchflower |first=David |title=Opposing austerity is not enough – Labour’s leaders need lessons in economics, fast |publisher=''[[New Statesman]]'' |date=27 January 2016 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2016/01/opposing-austerity-not-enough-labour-s-leaders-need-lessons-economics-fast |accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the committee, according to [[Robert Peston]], then ''[[BBC News]]'' Economics Editor, went some way to answering the common charge that [[Jeremy Corbyn]] and [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] were "left-wing dinosaurs" and would ensure, "a properly emotional debate" between the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] about, "how to maximise growth and prosperity".&lt;ref name="BBC02" /&gt; Peston went on to contend that this was the first time since [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party Leader]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] had drawn upon the ideas of [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]], that a leading British political party had, "attempted to establish an economic ideology outside the mainstream".&lt;ref name="BBC02" /&gt; Chris Giles, ''[[The Financial Times]]'' Economics Editor, countered this claim by referencing relationships between former [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party Leaders]] and economists, such as [[Neil Kinnock]] with [[John Eatwell]] and [[Piero Sraffa]], and [[Gordon Brown]] with [[Robert Reich]] and [[Richard B. Freeman]], as well as [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[George Osborne]] with [[Alan Budd]] and [[Kenneth Rogoff]].&lt;ref name="FT01" /&gt; Although, as Peston concludes, none of these had formed a similar committee.&lt;ref name="BBC02" /&gt;

===First Meeting===
The first meeting of the committee was convened at 2pm on 12 November 2015, at Labour Party’s Brewers Green headquarters, with [[Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|Shadow Business Secretary]] [[Angela Eagle]], [[Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury|Shadow Chief Secretary]] [[Seema Malhotra]] and the entire Shadow Treasury team in attendance.&lt;ref name="LL02"&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=What’s happening at the first meeting of Labour’s star-studded Economic Advisory Committee? |publisher=''LabourList'' |date=12 November 2015 |url=http://labourlist.org/2015/11/whats-happenening-at-the-first-meeting-of-labours-star-studded-economic-advisory-committee/ |accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting, [[Simon Wren-Lewis]] spoke about fiscal policy, [[Mariana Mazzucato]] about strategic investment, and [[Ann Pettifor]] about the importance of a strong economic narrative.&lt;ref name="LL02" /&gt; Although Anastasia Nesvetailova and [[David Blanchflower]] were also in attendance, the latter via [[Skype]],&lt;ref name="LL02" /&gt; neither of the two most high-profile members, [[Thomas Piketty]] and [[Joseph Stiglitz]], were present at this initial meeting.&lt;ref name="NS03"&gt;{{cite web |last=Chakelian |first=Anoosh |title="Labour must get real about the economy": is Corbyn’s economic advisory board unravelling? |publisher=''[[New Statesman]]'' |date=27 January 2016 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2016/01/labour-must-get-real-about-economy-corbyn-s-economic-advisory-board |accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First "New Economics" Public Debates===
On 26 January 2016, committee member [[Mariana Mazzucato]], gave the first of the ''[[New Economics Tour]]'', which had been announced by [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] with the intention of broadening the political debate.&lt;ref name="LL03"&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=John McDonnell launches ‘New Economics’ public debate tour |publisher=''LabourList'' |date=18 January 2016 |url=http://labourlist.org/2016/01/john-mcdonnell-launches-new-economics-public-debate-tour/ |accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, coinciding with the start of the party's series of public debates presenting their "New Economics", it was reported in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' that the committee had only met once and members had accused the party of having “stupid ideas” about economic policy.&lt;ref name="NS03" /&gt; In the article which the report was based upon [[David Blanchflower]], committee member and ''[[New Statesman]]'' economics editor, confirmed that although the committee had only met once the plan was to convene every quarter from then on and that the "silly stuff" he referred to was companies not being able to pay dividends if they don’t do certain things.&lt;ref name="NS02" /&gt; Blanchflower, who admitted that it was early days and that the new Labour Party still did not have many economic policies to speak of, nonetheless confirmed that economists in the group were smart, left-leaning and credible, and that it was time to start thinking about how Labour could become a credible opposition.&lt;ref name="NS02" /&gt;

===Leadership crisis===
Blanchflower quit the panel and said he would also wind up his review of the role of the [[Bank of England]] on 28 June 2016 following the mass resignations of the Shadow Cabinet, joining them in calling for Corbyn to step down.&lt;ref name="panelshutdown"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Inman|first1=Phillip|title=Former Corbyn adviser Thomas Piketty criticises Labour's 'weak' EU fight|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/29/thomas-piketty-quits-as-adviser-to-jeremy-corbyn|accessdate=27 July 2016|publisher=Guardian|date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piketty revealed that he had also left the panel in June, citing work commitments. He also criticised Labour's "very weak" referendum campaign to remain in the EU but said this was not a factor in his decision.&lt;ref name="panelshutdown" /&gt;

Some other members of the panel, including Mazzucato, Pettifor and Wren-Lewis issued a statement saying the panel had agreed to delay further meetings as a result of mass resignations over the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. They also criticised the Labour leadership over the EU campaign, but said they saw their role as "providing advice to the Labour party as a whole, and not as an endorsement of particular individuals within" and would be "honoured" to serve the party in future after the leadership situation was resolved&lt;ref name="panelshutdown" /&gt; [[Simon Wren-Lewis]] later joined with Blanchflower endorsing [[Owen Smith]] over Corbyn for the leadership on 31 July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mason  |first=Rowena |title=Former economic advisers to Corbyn back rival for Labour leader  |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/31/economic-advisers-jeremy-corbyn-cant-win-next-election-owen-smith |accessdate=1 August 2016 |publisher=Guardian |date=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Policies==
===People's Quantitative Easing===
Shortly after the formation of the committee, [[Robert Peston]] contended that the composition of the panel signalled that [[People's Quantitative Easing]], the policy of requiring the [[Bank of England]] to print money to finance government investment, which had up to that point been considered the cornerstone of [[Corbynomics|Jeremy Corbyn's economic policy]], was probably dead, as he felt that while this particular group of economists would, "back the notion of the government taking advantage of prevailing low interest rates to borrow considerably more for investment in infrastructure," they would not support the ultra formulation of the policy, "for fear that the anti-inflationary credentials of the Bank of England would be destroyed", and that if the policy survived it would be as, "a contingent rainy-day monetary tool, for when the economy is next in direst straits."&lt;ref name="BBC02" /&gt;

[[File:Flag of Alsace.svg|thumb|The official flag of [[Alsace]] 2008–present]]

The '''flag of Alsace''' ([[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]]: '''''{{lang|gsw|Rot un Wiss}}''''' or '''''{{lang|gsw|Rot-un-Wiss}}''''', "red and white") is the original red and white [[flag]] of the region, and can be traced to the red and white [[banner]] of [[Gerard, Duke of Lorraine]] in the 11th century.

Particularly since the introduction of new [[France|French]] region [[Grand Est]], the traditional ''{{lang|gsw|Rot un Wiss}}'' flag of [[Alsace]] has been widely promoted by the advocates of the [[Alsace independence movement|Alsace autonomous movement]].

== History ==

=== ''{{lang|gsw|Rot un Wiss}}'' (from the 11th century) ===
The original flag of Alsace, the ''{{lang|gsw|Rot un Wiss}}'', dates back to the red and white [[banner]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genealogie-bisval.net/Images/Lorraine.gif&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Gerard, Duke of Lorraine]] in the 11th century.

Red and white colours are commonly found on the coat of arms of Alsatian cities such as [[Strasbourg]], [[Mulhouse]] and [[Sélestat]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unserland.org/dossiers/breve-histoire-dun-drapeau-alsacien/&lt;/ref&gt; and additionally of many [[Swiss]] cities, especially in the region of [[Basel-Landschaft]].

=== Departments flag (1949–2008) ===
Perhaps as the ''{{lang|gsw|Rot un Wiss}}'' marks the [[Germany|Germanic]] roots of Alsace, it was replaced in 1949 by a new flag, representing the union of the two ''{{lang|fr|[[département]]s}}'' of {{lang|fr|[[Haut-Rhin]]}} and {{lang|fr|[[Bas-Rhin]]}}, however without real historical relevance. It was subsequently modified to a slightly different appearance, yet also representing the two departments.

== Controversy ==
There is controversy around the recognition of the Alsatian flag.

With the purpose of "Francosizing" the region, the ''{{lang|gsw|Rot un Wiss}}'' has not been recognised by the French government. Some French politicians have erroneously called this a "[[Nazi]] invention" — while the ''{{lang|gsw|Rot un Wiss}}'' is still known as the real historical [[emblem]] of the region by most of the population and the departments' parliaments.

Subsequently, the ''{{lang|gsw|Rot un Wiss}}'' has been widely used during protests against the creation of a new "super-region" [[Grand Est]], gathering [[Champagne-Ardennes]], [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] and Alsace, namely on [[Replicas of the Statue of Liberty#Colmar|Colmar's statue of liberty]].&lt;ref&gt;http://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/alsace/2014/11/16/colmar-une-statu-de-la-liberte-en-rot-und-wiss-593102.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1389">The '''Free Trade Unions''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Freie Gewerkschaften''; sometimes also translated as '''Free Labor Unions''' or '''Free Labour Unions''') comprised the socialist trade union movement in Germany from 1890 to 1933. The term distinguished them from the liberal ("yellow") and Christian labor unions in Germany. Coordinated by the [[General Commission of German Trade Unions]] until 1919 and later by the [[Federal Executive of the German Trade Union Federation]], the Free Trade Unions consisted of forty-six individual labor organizations with a total of 2.5 million members as of 1914.&lt;ref&gt;"Free Trade Unions (Freie Gewerkschaften)". In Campbell, Joan (ed.): ''European labor unions''. 1992, Greenwood Press, Westport, Connecticut&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "free" was to note that these unions were independent worker organizations.  The liberal ("yellow") unions were considered to be controlled by management and the "Christian" trade unions by the Catholic Church. 

Later, the term "free trade unions" also indicated those that were not fronts for the Communist Party.

The '''Hundred Years' War''' was a series of conflicts waged from 1337 to 1453 by the [[House of Plantagenet]], rulers of the [[Kingdom of England]], against the French [[House of Valois]], over the right to rule the [[Kingdom of France]]. Each side drew many allies into the war. It was one of the most notable conflicts of the [[Middle Ages]], in which five generations of kings from two rival [[Dynasty|dynasties]] fought for the throne of the largest kingdom in [[Western Europe]]. The war marked both the height of [[chivalry]] and its subsequent decline, and the development of strong [[National identity|national identities]] in both countries.

Tensions between the crowns of France and England can be traced back to the origins of the English royal family itself, which was French ([[Normandy|Norman]], and later, [[Anjou|Angevin]]) in origin. For this reason, English monarchs had historically held not only the English crown, but also titles and lands within France, the possession of which made them [[vassal]]s to the kings of France. The status of the English king's French [[fief]]s was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages. French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose, particularly whenever England was at war with [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], an [[Auld Alliance|ally of France]]. Over the centuries, English holdings in France had varied in size, at some points dwarfing even the [[Crown lands of France|French royal domain]]; by 1337, however, only [[Gascony]] was left to the English.

In 1316, a principle was established denying women succession to the French throne (later retroactively attributed to the ancient [[Salic law]]). In 1328, [[Charles IV of France]] died without sons or brothers. His [[Proximity of blood|closest male relative]] was his nephew [[Edward III of England]], whose mother, [[Isabella of France]], was sister of the deceased king. Isabella [[English claims to the French throne|claimed the throne of France for her son]], but the French rejected it, maintaining that Isabella [[Nemo dat quod non habet|could not transmit a right she did not possess]]. Furthermore, political sentiment favored a Frenchman for the crown rather than a foreign prince. The throne passed instead to Philip, [[Counts and dukes of Valois|Count of Valois]], a [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] cousin of Charles IV, who would become [[Philip VI of France]], the first king of the House of Valois. The English had not expected their claim to meet with success, and did not press the matter when it was denied. However, disagreements between Philip and Edward induced the former to confiscate the latter's lands in France, and in turn prompted Edward III to reassert his claim to the French throne.

Several overwhelming English victories in the war—especially at [[Battle of Crécy|Crécy]], [[Battle of Poitiers|Poitiers]], and [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]]—raised the prospects of an ultimate English triumph, and convinced the English to continue pouring money and manpower into the war over many decades. However, the greater resources of the French monarchy prevented the English kings from ever completing the conquest of France. Starting in 1429, decisive French victories at [[Siege of Orléans|Orléans]], [[Battle of Patay|Patay]], [[Battle of Formigny|Formigny]], and [[Battle of Castillon|Castillon]] concluded the war in favour of the House of Valois, with England permanently losing most of its possessions on the continent.

Historians commonly divide the war into three phases separated by [[Ceasefire|truces]]: the [[Hundred Years' War (1337–1360)|Edwardian War]] (1337–1360), the [[Hundred Years' War (1369–89)|Caroline War]] (1369–1389), and the [[Hundred Years' War (1415–53)|Lancastrian War]] (1415–1453). Local conflicts in neighbouring areas, which were contemporarily related to the war, including the [[War of the Breton Succession]] (1341–1365), the [[Castilian Civil War]] (1366–1369), the [[War of the Two Peters]] (1356–1369) in [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], and the [[1383–85 crisis]] in [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], were availed by the parties to advance their agendas. Later historians adopted the term "Hundred Years' War" as a historiographical [[periodization]] to encompass all of these events, thus constructing the longest military conflict in [[History of Europe|European history]].

The war owes its historical significance to multiple factors. By its end, feudal armies had been largely replaced by professional troops, and aristocratic dominance had yielded to a democratisation of the manpower and weapons of armies. Although primarily a [[War of succession|dynastic conflict]], the war gave impetus to ideas of [[French nationalism|French]] and [[English nationalism#Medieval|English]] [[nationalism]]. The wider introduction of weapons and tactics supplanted the feudal armies where [[heavy cavalry]] had dominated, and [[artillery]] became important. The war precipitated the creation of the first [[Standing army|standing armies]] in Western Europe since the time of the [[Western Roman Empire]], thus helping to change their role in [[war]]fare. With respect to the belligerents, in France, [[civil war]]s, deadly [[epidemic]]s, [[famine]]s, and bandit [[Free company|free-companies]] of [[Routiers|mercenaries]] reduced the population drastically. In England, political forces over time came to oppose the costly venture. The dissatisfaction of English nobles, resulting from the loss of their continental landholdings, as well as the general shock at losing a war in which investment had been so great, became factors leading to the [[Wars of the Roses]] (1455–1487).

==Origin of the conflict==
The root causes of the conflict can be found in the [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages|demographic, economic and political crises of 14th century Europe]]. The outbreak of war was motivated by a gradual rise in tension between the kings of France and England about [[Gascony]], [[Flanders]] and [[Scotland]]. The dynastic question, which arose due to an interruption of the direct male line of the Capetians, was the official pretext.

{{Main|English claims to the French throne}}
The question of female succession to the French throne was raised after the death of [[Louis X of France|Louis X]] in 1316. Louis X left only [[Joan II of Navarre|a daughter]], and [[John I of France|his posthumous son John I]] lived only a few days. Furthermore, the paternity of his daughter was in question, as her mother, Margaret of Burgundy, had been exposed as an adulterer in the [[Tour de Nesle affair]]. Philip, [[Count of Poitiers]], brother of Louis X, positioned himself to take the crown, advancing the stance that women should be ineligible to succeed to the French throne. Through his political sagacity he won over his adversaries and succeeded to the French throne as [[Philip V of France|Philip V]]. By the same law that he procured, his daughters were denied the succession, which passed to his younger brother, [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]], in 1322.{{sfn|Brissaud|1915|pp=329–330}}

Charles IV died in 1328, leaving a daughter and a pregnant wife. If the unborn child was male, he would become king; if not, Charles left the choice of his successor to the nobles. [[Blanche of France, Duchess of Orléans|A girl]] ended up being born, therefore rendering the main male line of the [[House of Capet]] extinct.

By [[proximity of blood]], the nearest male relative of Charles IV was his nephew [[Edward III of England]]. Edward was the son of [[Isabella of France|Isabella]], the sister of the dead Charles IV, but the question arose whether she should be able to transmit a right to inherit that she did not herself possess. The French nobility, moreover, balked at the prospect of being ruled by Isabelle and her lover [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], who were widely suspected of having murdered the previous English king, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the [[University of Paris]] decided that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded. Thus the nearest [[Agnatic primogeniture|heir through male ancestry]] was Charles IV's first cousin, Philip, [[Counts and dukes of Valois|Count of Valois]], and it was decided that he should be crowned [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]]. In 1340 the [[Avignon papacy]] confirmed that under [[Salic law]] males should not be able to inherit through their mothers.{{sfn|Brissaud|1915|pp=329–330}}{{sfn|Previté-Orton|1978|p=872}}

Eventually, Edward III reluctantly recognized Philip VI and paid him [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] for his French fiefs. He made concessions in [[Guyenne]], but reserved the right to reclaim territories arbitrarily confiscated. After that, he expected to be left undisturbed while he made [[Second War of Scottish Independence|war on Scotland]].

As [[Duke of Aquitaine]], Edward was also a vassal to the French King. Illumination by [[Jean Fouquet]] from the ''[[Grandes Chroniques de France]]'' in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]], Paris.]]
Tensions between the French and English monarchies can be traced back to the 1066 [[Norman conquest of England]], in which the [[Throne of England|English throne]] was seized by the [[Duke of Normandy]], a [[vassal]] of the [[List of French monarchs|King of France]]. As a result, the crown of England was held by a succession of nobles who already owned lands in France, which put them among the most powerful subjects of the French king, as they could now draw upon the economic power of [[England]] to enforce their interests in the mainland. To the kings of France, this dangerously threatened their royal authority, and so they would constantly try to undermine English rule in France, while the [[List of English monarchs|English monarchs]] would struggle to protect and expand their lands. This clash of interests was the root cause of much of the conflict between the French and English monarchies throughout the medieval era.

The [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] [[House of Normandy|dynasty]] that had ruled [[Kingdom of England|England]] since the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] of 1066 was brought to an end when [[Henry II of England|Henry]], the son of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]] and [[Empress Matilda]] and great-grandson of [[William the Conqueror]], became the first of the [[Angevin kings of England]] in 1154 as Henry II.{{sfn|Bartlett|2000|p=22}} The Angevin kings directly ruled over [[Angevin Empire|more French territory]] than the [[List of French monarchs|kings of France]]. However, they still owed [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] for these territories to the French king. From the 11th century onward, the Angevins had autonomy within their French domains, effectively neutralizing the issue.{{sfn|Bartlett|2000|p=17}}

[[John, King of England|King John of England]] inherited the Angevin domains from his brother [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]. However, [[Philip II of France]] acted decisively to exploit the weaknesses of John, both legally and militarily, and [[French invasion of Normandy (1202–1204)|by 1204 had succeeded in taking control of much of the Angevin continental possessions]]. Following John's reign, the [[Battle of Bouvines]] (1214), the [[Saintonge War]] (1242), and finally the [[War of Saint-Sardos]] (1324), the English king's holdings on the continent, as [[Duke of Aquitaine]] (Guyenne), were limited roughly to provinces in Gascony.{{sfn|Gormley|2007}}

The dispute over Guyenne is even more important than the dynastic question in explaining the outbreak of the war. Guyenne posed a significant problem to the kings of France and England: Edward III was a vassal of Philip VI of France because of his French possessions and was required to recognize the [[suzerainty]] of the King of France over them. In practical terms, a judgment in Guyenne might be subject to an appeal to the French royal court. The King of France had the power to revoke all legal decisions made by the King of England in Aquitaine, which was unacceptable to the English. Therefore, sovereignty over Guyenne was a latent conflict between the two monarchies for several generations.

During the War of Saint-Sardos, [[Charles, Count of Valois|Charles of Valois]], father of Philip VI, invaded Aquitaine on behalf of Charles IV and conquered the duchy after a local insurrection, which the French believed had been incited by [[Edward II of England]]. Charles IV grudgingly agreed to return this territory in 1325. To recover his duchy, Edward II had to compromise: he sent his son, the future Edward III, to pay homage.

The King of France agreed to restore Guyenne, minus [[Agenais|Agen]]. But the French delayed the return of the lands, which helped Philip VI. On 6 June 1329, Edward III finally paid homage to the King of France. However, at the ceremony, Philip VI had it recorded that the homage was not due to the fiefs detached from the duchy of Guyenne by Charles IV (especially Agen). For Edward, the homage did not imply the renunciation of his claim to the extorted lands.

===Gascony under the King of England===

{{Legend|#FFB6C1|England and Guyenne/Gascony as of 1330}}
]]
In the 11th century, [[Gascony]] in southwest France had been incorporated into Aquitaine (also known as ''Guyenne'' or ''Guienne'') and formed with it the province of Guyenne and Gascony (French: ''Guyenne-et-Gascogne''). The [[Angevin kings of England]] became [[Dukes of Aquitaine]] after [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] married the former Queen of France, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], in 1152, from which point the lands were held in vassalage to the French crown. By the 13th century the terms Aquitaine, Guyenne and Gascony were virtually synonymous.{{sfn|Harris|1994|p=8}}{{sfn|Prestwich|1988|p=298}} At the beginning of Edward III's reign on 1 February 1327, the only part of Aquitaine that remained in his hands was the Duchy of Gascony. The term Gascony came to be used for the territory held by the Angevin ([[Plantagenet]]) Kings of England in southwest France, although they still used the title Duke of Aquitaine.{{sfn|Prestwich|1988|p=298}}{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=292–293}}

For the first 10 years of Edward III's reign, Gascony had been a major point of friction. The English argued that, as Charles IV had not acted in a proper way towards his tenant, Edward should be able to hold the duchy free of any French [[suzerainty]]. This argument was rejected by the French, so in 1329, the 17-year-old Edward III paid homage to Philip VI. Tradition demanded that vassals approach their liege unarmed with heads bare. Edward protested by attending the ceremony wearing his crown and sword.{{sfn|Wilson|2011|p=194}} Even after this pledge of homage, the French continued to pressure the English administration.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=394}}

Gascony was not the only sore point. One of Edward's influential advisers was [[Robert III of Artois]]. Robert was an exile from the French court, having fallen out with Philip VI over an inheritance claim. He urged Edward to start a war to reclaim France, and was able to provide extensive intelligence on the French court.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=306}}

===Franco-Scot alliance===
{{See also|Auld Alliance}}
France was an ally of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] as English kings had for some time tried to subjugate the area. In 1295, [[Auld Alliance|a treaty]] was signed between France and Scotland during the reign of [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]]. Charles IV formally [[Treaty of Corbeil (1326)|renewed the treaty]] in 1326, promising Scotland that France would support the Scots if England invaded their country. Similarly, France would have Scotland's support if its own kingdom was attacked. Edward could not succeed in his plans for Scotland if the Scots could count on French support.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=304–305}}

Philip VI had assembled a large naval fleet off Marseilles as part of an ambitious plan for a [[crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]]. However, the plan was abandoned and the fleet, including elements of the Scottish Navy, moved to the [[English Channel]] off Normandy in 1336, threatening England.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=306}} To deal with this crisis, Edward proposed that the English raise two armies, one to deal with the Scots "at a suitable time", the other to proceed at once to Gascony. At the same time, ambassadors were to be sent to France with a proposed treaty for the French king.{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=180}}

===End of homage===
At the end of April 1337, Philip of France was invited to meet the delegation from England but refused. The ''[[arrière-ban]]'', literally a call to arms, was proclaimed throughout France starting on 30 April 1337. Then, in May 1337, Philip met with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that the Duchy of Aquitaine, effectively Gascony, should be taken back into the king's hands on the grounds that Edward III was in breach of his obligations as vassal and had sheltered the king's 'mortal enemy' [[Robert III of Artois|Robert d'Artois]].{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=184}} Edward responded to the confiscation of Aquitaine by challenging Philip's right to the French throne. When Charles IV died, Edward had made a claim for the succession of the French throne, through the right of his mother Isabella (Charles IV's sister), daughter of Philip IV. Any claim was considered invalidated by Edward's homage to Philip VI in 1329. Edward revived his claim and in 1340 formally assumed the title 'King of France and the French Royal Arms'.{{sfn|Prestwich|2003|pp=149–150}}

On 26 January 1340, Edward III formally received homage from Guy, half-brother of the Count of [[County of Flanders|Flanders]]. The civic authorities of [[Ghent]], [[Ypres]] and [[Bruges]] proclaimed Edward King of France. Edward's purpose was to strengthen his alliances with the [[Low Countries]]. His supporters would be able to claim that they were loyal to the "true" King of France and were not rebels against Philip. In February 1340, Edward returned to England to try to raise more funds and also deal with political difficulties.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=307–312}}

Relations with Flanders were also tied to the [[Medieval English wool trade|English wool trade]], since Flanders' principal cities relied heavily on textile production and England supplied much of the raw material they needed. Edward III had commanded that his [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]] sit on the [[woolsack]] in council as a symbol of the pre-eminence of the wool trade.{{sfn|Friar|2004|pp=480–481}} At the time there were about 110,000 [[History of Sussex#Wool|sheep in Sussex]] alone.&lt;ref name="darby160"&gt;R.E.Glassock. England circa 1334 ''in'' {{harvnb|Darby|1976|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great medieval English monasteries produced large surpluses of wool that were sold to mainland Europe. Successive governments were able to make large amounts of money by taxing it.{{sfn|Friar|2004|pp=480–481}} France's sea power led to economic disruptions for England, shrinking the wool trade to [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and the wine trade from Gascony.{{sfn|Sumption|1999|pp=188–189}}{{sfn|Sumption|1999|pp=233–234}}

===Outbreak, the English Channel and Brittany===
[[File:BattleofSluys.jpeg|thumb|[[Battle of Sluys]] from a [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|BNF]] [[Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF Fr 2643-6)|manuscript]] of [[Froissart's Chronicles]], Bruges, c.1470.]]

On 22 June 1340, Edward and his fleet sailed from England and arrived off the [[Zwin]] estuary the next day. The French fleet assumed a defensive formation off the port of [[Sluis]]. The English fleet deceived the French into believing they were withdrawing. When the wind turned in the late afternoon, the English attacked with the wind and sun behind them. The French fleet was almost completely destroyed in what became known as the [[Battle of Sluys]]. England dominated the English Channel for the rest of the war, preventing French [[invasions]].{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=307–312}} At this point, Edward's funds ran out and the war probably would have ended were it not for the death of the [[John III, Duke of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] precipitating a succession dispute between the duke's half brother [[John of Montfort]] and [[Charles I, Duke of Brittany|Charles of Blois]], nephew of Philip VI.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=88–89}}

In 1341, conflict over the succession to the [[Duchy of Brittany]] began the [[War of the Breton Succession]], in which Edward backed John of Montfort and Philip backed Charles of Blois. Action for the next few years focused around a back and forth struggle in Brittany. The city of [[Vannes]] in Brittany changed hands several times, while further campaigns in Gascony met with mixed success for both sides.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=88–89}}  The English backed Montfort finally succeeded in taking the duchy but not until 1364.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Auray#ref783089 |title=Auray, France |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica |language=en |access-date=2018-04-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180415064637/https://www.britannica.com/place/Auray#ref783089#ref783089 |archive-date=15 April 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Crécy and the taking of Calais===
[[File:Crécy - Grandes Chroniques de France.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Crécy]], 1346, from the [[Grandes Chroniques de France]]. [[British Library]], London.]]
[[File:Edward III counting the dead on the battlefield of Crécy.jpg|thumb|[[Edward III]] counting the dead on the battlefield of Crécy]]

In July 1346, Edward mounted a major invasion across the channel, landing in Normandy's [[Cotentin]], at St. Vaast. The English army captured the completely unguarded [[Caen]] in just one day, surprising the French. Philip mustered a large army to oppose Edward, who chose to march northward toward the Low Countries, pillaging as he went. He reached the river Seine to find most of the crossings destroyed.  He moved further and further south, worryingly close to Paris, until he found the crossing at Poissy. This had only been partially destroyed, so the carpenters within his army were able to fix it. He then continued on his way to Flanders until he reached the river Somme. The army crossed at a tidal ford at Blanchetaque, leaving Philip's army stranded. Edward, assisted by this head start, continued on his way to Flanders once more, until, finding himself unable to outmanoeuvre Philip, Edward positioned his forces for battle and Philip's army attacked.

The [[Battle of Crécy]] was a complete disaster for the French, largely credited to the [[English longbow|longbowmen]] and the French king, who allowed his army to attack before it was ready.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=318–319}} Philip appealed to his Scottish allies to help with a diversionary attack on England. King [[David II of Scotland]] responded by invading northern England, but his army was defeated and he was captured at the [[Battle of Neville's Cross]], on 17 October 1346. This greatly reduced the threat from Scotland.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=88–89}}{{sfn|Rogers|2010|pp=55–45}} In France, Edward proceeded north unopposed and besieged the city of [[Calais]] on the English Channel, capturing it in 1347. This became an important strategic asset for the English, allowing them to safely keep troops in northern France.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=318–319}} Calais would remain under English control, even after the end of the Hundred Years' War, until the successful [[Siege of Calais (1558)|French siege in 1558]].{{sfn|Grummitt|2008|p=1}}

===Battle of Poitiers===
In 1348, the [[Black Death]], which had just arrived in Paris, began to ravage Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''The Black Death'', transl. &amp; ed. Rosemay Horrox, (Manchester University Press, 1994), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1355, after the plague had passed and England was able to recover financially,{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} King Edward's son and namesake, the [[Prince of Wales]], later known as the [[Edward, the Black Prince|Black Prince]], led a [[Chevauchée]] from Gascony into France, during which he pillaged [[Avignonet]] and [[Castelnaudary]], sacked [[Carcassonne]], and plundered [[Narbonne]]. The next year during another Chevauchée he ravaged [[Auvergne]], [[Limousin]], and [[Berry, France|Berry]]  but failed to take [[Bourges]]. He offered terms of peace to King [[John II of France]] (known as John the Good), who had outflanked him near Poitiers, but refused to surrender himself as the price of their acceptance. This led to the [[Battle of Poitiers]] (19 September 1356) where his army routed the French.{{sfn|Lee|1903|p=388}} During the battle, the Gascon noble [[Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch|Jean de Grailly]], [[captal de Buch]] led a mounted unit that was concealed in a forest. The French advance was contained, at which point de Grailly led a flanking movement with his horsemen cutting off the French retreat and succeeding in capturing King John and many of his nobles.{{sfn|Le Patourel|1984|pp=20–21}}{{sfn|Wilson|2011|p=218}} With John held hostage, his son the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] (later to become [[Charles V of France|Charles V]]) assumed the powers of the king as [[Regency (government)|regent]].{{sfn|Guignebert|1930|loc=Volume 1. pp. 304–307}}

After the Battle of Poitiers, many French nobles and mercenaries rampaged, and chaos ruled. A contemporary report recounted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... all went ill with the kingdom and the State was undone. Thieves and robbers rose up everywhere in the land. The Nobles despised and hated all others and took no thought for usefulness and profit of lord and men. They subjected and despoiled the peasants and the men of the villages. In no wise did they defend their country from its enemies; rather did they trample it underfoot, robbing and pillaging the peasants' goods&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;

=== Reims Campaign and Black Monday ===
{{main|Reims Campaign}}
[[File:Black Monday hailstorm.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Black Monday (1360)|Black Monday]] (1360), hailstorms and lighting ravage the English army at Chartres]]
Edward invaded France, for the third and last time, hoping to capitalise on the discontent and seize the throne. The Dauphin's strategy was that of non-engagement with the English army in the field. However, Edward wanted the crown and chose the cathedral city of [[Reims]] for his coronation (Reims was the traditional coronation city).{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=326}} However, the citizens of Reims built and reinforced the city's defences before Edward and his army arrived.{{sfn|Le Patourel|1984|p=189}} Edward besieged the city for five weeks, but the defences held and there was no coronation.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=326}} Edward moved on to Paris, but retreated after a few skirmishes in the suburbs. Next was the town of [[Chartres]]. Disaster struck in a freak hailstorm on the encamped army, causing over 1,000 English deaths – the so-called [[Black Monday (1360)|Black Monday]] on Easter 1360. This devastated Edward's army and forced him to negotiate when approached by the French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apr 13, 1360: Hail kills English troops |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/hail-kills-english-troops |website=[[History (U.S. TV network)|History.com]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120905150026/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/hail-kills-english-troops |archivedate=5 September 2012 |accessdate=2016-01-22 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A conference was held at Brétigny that resulted in the [[Treaty of Brétigny]] (8 May 1360).{{sfn|Le Patourel|1984|p=32}} The treaty was ratified at Calais in October. In return for increased lands in Aquitaine, Edward renounced Normandy, Touraine, Anjou and Maine and consented to reduce King John's ransom by a million crowns. Edward also abandoned his claim to the crown of France.{{sfn|Le Patourel|1984|pp=20–21}}{{sfn|Guignebert|1930|loc=Volume 1. pp. 304–307}}{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=501}}

==First peace: 1360–1369==
The French king, John II, had been held captive in England. The Treaty of Brétigny set his ransom at 3&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;crowns and allowed for hostages to be held in lieu of John. The hostages included two of his sons, several princes and nobles, four inhabitants of Paris, and two citizens from each of the nineteen principal towns of France. While these hostages were held, John returned to France to try and raise funds to pay the ransom. In 1362 John's son [[Louis I of Anjou|Louis of Anjou]], a hostage in English-held Calais, escaped captivity. So, with his stand-in hostage gone, John felt honor-bound to return to captivity in England.{{sfn|Guignebert|1930|loc=Volume 1. pp. 304–307}}{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=501}}

The French crown had been at odds with [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] (near southern Gascony) since 1354, and in 1363 the Navarrese used the captivity of John II in London and the political weakness of the Dauphin to try to seize power.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|pp=102–103}} Although there was no formal treaty, Edward III supported the Navarrese moves, particularly as there was a prospect that he might gain control over the northern and western provinces as a consequence. With this in mind, Edward deliberately slowed the peace negotiations.{{sfn|Ormrod|2001|p=384}} In 1364, John II died in London, while still in honourable captivity.&lt;ref name=Backman179&gt;{{harvnb|Backman|2003|pp=179–180}} – Nobles captured in battle were held in "Honorable Captivity", which recognised their status as prisoners of war and permitted ransom.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles V succeeded him as king of France.{{sfn|Guignebert|1930|loc=Volume 1. pp. 304–307}}&lt;ref name=britannica1&gt;Britannica.

===Aquitaine and Castile===
[[File:Du Guesclin Dinan.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Bertrand du Guesclin]] in [[Dinan]]]]
[[File:Ofensivas Tovar-Vienne contra Inglaterra 01.jpg|thumb|The Franco-Castilian Navy, led by Admirals
[[Jean de Vienne|de Vienne]] and [[Fernando Sánchez de Tovar|Tovar]], managed to raid the English coasts for the first time since the beginning of the Hundred Years' War.]]

In 1366 there was a civil war of succession in [[Crown of Castile#Ascension of the Trastámara dynasty|Castile]] (part of modern Spain). The forces of the ruler [[Peter of Castile]] were pitched against those of his half-brother [[Henry II of Castile|Henry of Trastámara]]. The English crown supported Peter; the French supported Henry. French forces were led by [[Bertrand du Guesclin]], a Breton, who rose from relatively humble beginnings to prominence as one of France's war leaders. Charles V provided a force of 12,000, with du Guesclin at their head, to support Trastámara in his invasion of Castile.{{sfn|Curry|2002|pp=69–70}}

Peter appealed to England and Aquitaine's [[Black Prince]] for help, but none was forthcoming, forcing Peter into exile in Aquitaine. The Black Prince had previously agreed to support Peter's claims but concerns over the terms of the treaty of Brétigny led him to assist Peter as a representative of Aquitaine, rather than England. He then led an Anglo-Gascon army into Castile. Peter was restored to power after Trastámara's army was defeated at the [[Battle of Nájera]].{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=78}}

Although the Castilians had agreed to fund the Black Prince, they failed to do so. The Prince was suffering from ill health and returned with his army to Aquitaine. To pay off debts incurred during the Castile campaign, the prince instituted a [[hearth tax]]. [[Arnaud Amanieu, Lord of Albret|Arnaud-Amanieu VIII]], Lord of [[Albret]] had fought on the Black Prince's side during the war. Albret, who already had become discontented by the influx of English administrators into the enlarged Aquitaine, refused to allow the tax to be collected in his fief. He then joined a group of Gascon lords who appealed to Charles V for support in their refusal to pay the tax. Charles V summoned one Gascon lord and the Black Prince to hear the case in his High Court in Paris. The Black Prince answered that he would go to Paris with sixty thousand men behind him. War broke out again and Edward III resumed the title of King of France.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=122}} Charles V declared that all the English possessions in France were forfeited, and before the end of 1369 all of Aquitaine was in full revolt.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=122}}{{sfn|Wagner|2006|pp=3–4}}

With the Black Prince gone from Castile, Henry de Trastámara led a second invasion that ended with Peter's death at the [[Battle of Montiel]] in March 1369. The new Castilian regime provided naval support to French campaigns against Aquitaine and England.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=78}}

In 1373, the combined Castilian and French fleets sacked the [[Isle of Wight]]. In 1377, they burned [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]] and [[Hastings]] and sacked [[Lewes]], [[Folkestone]], [[Portsmouth]], [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]], and [[Plymouth]]. In 1378, the Castilian galleys raided [[Cornwall]], burning coastal towns and levying tribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Safeguard of the Sea: A Naval History of Britain 660–1649 |date=2004 |publisher=Penguin UK |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year the Castilians conquered the Castle of La Roche Guyon on the Breton coast. In July 1380, [[Fernando Sánchez de Tovar]] led a Franco-Castilian fleet from [[La Rochelle]] in an attack on [[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]], followed by an August raid into the [[Thames Estuary]]. The raiders burned [[Gravesend]], while the Londoners watched the flames from a distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Medieval Culture and the Mexican American Borderlands |date=2001 |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press |page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1373 campaign of John of Gaunt===
In August 1373, [[John of Gaunt]], accompanied by [[John V, Duke of Brittany|John de Montfort]], Duke of Brittany led a force of 9,000 men out from Calais on a major chevauchée.  While initially successful as French forces were insufficiently concentrated to oppose them, the English began to meet further resistance as they moved south.  French forces began to concentrate around the English force but, under specific orders from [[Charles V of France|King Charles V]], the French avoided a set battle.  Instead, they fell on forces detached from the main body to raid or forage. The French shadowed the English and in October, the English found themselves being trapped against the [[Allier (river)|River Allier]] by four separate French forces.  With some difficulty, the English crossed at the bridge at [[Moulins, Allier|Moulins]] but lost all their baggage and loot.  The English carried on south across the [[Limousin]] plateau but the weather was turning severe.  Men and horses died in great numbers and many soldiers, forced to march on foot, discarded their armour.  At the beginning of December, the army finally entered friendly territory in [[Gascony]].  By the end of December they were in [[Bordeaux]], starving, ill-equipped and having lost over half of the 30,000 horses with which they had left Calais.  Although the march across France had been a remarkable feat, it was a military failure.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|pp=187–196}}

===English turmoil===
With his health continuing to deteriorate, the Black Prince returned to England in January 1371, whereby now his father Edward III was elderly and also in poor health. The prince's illness was debilitating, and he died on 8 June 1376.{{sfn|Barber|2004}}

Edward III died the following year on 21 June 1377;{{sfn|Ormrod|2008}} he was succeeded by the Black Prince's second son [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] ([[Edward of Angoulême|the first son]] had died sometime earlier), who was still a child.{{sfn|Tuck|2004}} The treaty at Brétigny left Edward III and England with enlarged holdings in France; however, a small professional French army under the leadership of du Guesclin pushed the English back and, by the time of Charles V's death in 1380, the English only held Calais and a few other coastal cities.&lt;ref name=vauchez283&gt;Francoise Autrand. Charles V King of France ''in'' {{harvnb|Vauchéz|2000|pp=283–284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was usual to appoint a [[regent]] in the case of a child monarch, but no regent was appointed for Richard II, who nominally exercised the power of kingship from the date of his accession in 1377.{{sfn|Tuck|2004}} However, between 1377 and 1380, actual power was in the hands of a series of councils. The political community preferred this to a regency led by the king's uncle, [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]], although Gaunt remained highly influential.{{sfn|Tuck|2004}}

Richard faced many challenges during his reign, including the [[Peasants' Revolt]] led by [[Wat Tyler]] in 1381 and an Anglo-Scottish war in 1384–1385. His attempts to raise taxes to pay for his Scottish adventure and for the protection of Calais against the French made him increasingly unpopular.{{sfn|Tuck|2004}}

====1380 campaign of the Earl of Buckingham====
In July 1380, the [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Earl of Buckingham]] commanded an expedition to France to aid England's ally, the [[John IV, Duke of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]]. The French refused battle before the walls of [[Troyes]] on 25 August, so Buckingham's forces continued their chevauchée and in November laid siege to [[Nantes]].{{sfn|Sumption|2012|pp=385–390, 396–399}} However, expected support from the Duke of Brittany did not appear and, in the face of heavy losses in both men and horses, was forced to abandon the siege in January 1381.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=409}} In February 1381, now [[Treaty of Guérande (1381)|reconciled to the regime of the new French king]] [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]], Brittany paid 50,000 francs to Buckingham for him to abandon the siege and the campaign.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=411}}

===French turmoil===
After the deaths of Charles V and du Guesclin in 1380, France lost its main leadership and overall momentum in the war. [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] succeeded his father as king of France at the age of 11, and he was thus put under a regency led by his uncles, who managed to maintain an effective grip on government affairs until about 1388, well after Charles had achieved royal majority.

With France facing widespread destruction, plague, and economic recession, high taxation put a heavy burden on the French peasantry and urban communities. The war effort against England largely depended on royal taxation, but the population was increasingly unwilling to pay for it, as would be demonstrated at the [[Harelle]] and Maillotin revolts in 1382. Charles V had abolished many of these taxes on his deathbed, but subsequent attempts to reinstate them stirred up hostility between the French government and populace.

Difficulties in raising taxes and revenue hampered the ability of the French to fight the English. At this point, the war's pace had largely slowed down, and both nations found themselves fighting mainly through [[proxy war]]s, such as during the [[1383–1385 Portuguese interregnum]]. The independence party in the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], which was supported by the English, won against the supporters of the King of Castile's claim to the Portuguese throne, who in turn was backed by the French.

[[File:Apanages.svg|thumb|France in 1388, just before signing a truce. English territories are shown in red, French royal territories are dark blue, papal territories are orange, and French vassals have the other colors.]]
The war became increasingly unpopular with the English public largely due to the high taxes needed to sustain it. These taxes were seen as one of the reasons for the Peasants' revolt.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=6}} Richard's increasing disinterest in the war together with his preferential treatment of a select few close friends and advisors angered an alliance of lords that included [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|one of his uncles]]. This group, known as [[Lords Appellant]], managed to successfully press charges of treason against five of Richard's advisors and friends in the [[Merciless Parliament]]. The Lords Appellant were able to gain control of the council in 1388 and tried, unsuccessfully, to reignite the war in France. Although the will was there, the funds to pay the troops was lacking, so in the autumn of 1388 the Council agreed to resume negotiations with the French crown, beginning on 18 June 1389 with the signing of [[Truce of Leulinghem|a three-year truce at Leulinghem]].{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=6}}{{sfn|Neillands|2001|pp=182–184}}

In 1389, Richard's uncle and supporter, [[John of Gaunt]], returned from Spain and Richard was able to rebuild his power gradually until 1397, when he reasserted his authority and destroyed the principal three among the Lords Appellant. In 1399, after John of Gaunt died, Richard II disinherited Gaunt's son, the exiled [[Henry IV of England|Henry of Bolingbroke]]. Bolingbroke returned to England with his supporters and deposed Richard and had himself crowned Henry IV.{{sfn|Tuck|2004}}{{sfn|Neillands|2001|pp=182–184}}{{sfn|Curry|2002|pp=77–82}}

In Scotland, the problems brought in by the English regime change prompted border raids that were countered by an invasion in 1402 and the defeat of a Scottish army at the [[Battle of Humbleton Hill|Battle of Homildon Hill]].{{sfn|Mortimer|2008|pp=253–254}} A dispute over the spoils between Henry and [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland]], resulted in a long and bloody struggle between the two for control of northern England, resolved only with the almost complete destruction of the [[House of Percy|Percy family]] by 1408.{{sfn|Mortimer|2008|pp=263–264}}{{sfn|Bean|2008}}

In Wales, [[Owain Glyndŵr]] was declared [[Prince of Wales]] on 16 September 1400. He was the leader of the most serious and widespread [[List of Anglo-Welsh wars|rebellion against English authority in Wales]] since [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I of England|the conquest of 1282–1283]]. In 1405, the French allied with Glyndŵr and the Castilians in Spain and a Franco-Welsh army advanced as far as [[Worcester]], while the Spaniards used galleys to raid and burn all the way from [[Cornwall]] to [[Southampton]], before taking refuge in [[Harfleur]] for the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Agincourt: Myth and Reality 1915–2015|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glyndŵr Rising|The rebellion]] was finally put down only in 1415 and resulted in Welsh semi-independence for a number of years.{{sfn|Smith|2008}}

[[File:Assassinat louis orleans.jpg|thumb|[[Assassination of Louis I, Duke of Orléans]]]]
In 1392, [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] suddenly descended into madness, forcing France into a regency dominated by his uncles and his brother. An open conflict for control over the Regency began between his uncle [[Philip the Bold]], Duke of Burgundy, and his brother, [[Louis of Valois, Duke of Orléans]]. After Philip's death, his son and heir [[John the Fearless]] continued the struggle against Louis, but with the disadvantage of having no close personal relation to the king. Finding himself outmaneuvered politically, John ordered the assassination of Louis in retaliation. His involvement in the murder was quickly revealed, and the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnac]] family took political power in opposition to John. By 1410, both sides were bidding for the help of English forces in a civil war.{{sfn|Curry|2002|pp=77–82}} In 1418 Paris was taken by the Burgundians, who were unable to stop the massacre of [[Bernard VII, Count of Armagnac|Count of Armagnac]] and about 2,500 of his followers by a Parisian mob.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sizer|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this period, England confronted repeated raids by [[pirates]] that heavily damaged trade and the navy. There is some evidence that Henry IV used state-legalised piracy as a form of warfare in the English Channel. He used such [[privateer]]ing campaigns to pressure enemies without risking open war.&lt;ref name=hattendorf76&gt;Ian Friel. The English and War at Sea. c.1200-c.1500 ''in'' {{harvnb|Hattendorf|Unger|2003|pp=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French responded in kind and French pirates, under Scottish protection, raided many English coastal towns.&lt;ref name=nolan424&gt;Nolan. The Age of Wars of Religion. p. 424&lt;/ref&gt;

The domestic and dynastic difficulties faced by England and France in this period quieted the war for a decade.&lt;ref name=nolan424 /&gt;

Henry IV of England died in 1413 and was replaced by his eldest son Henry V. The mental illness of Charles VI of France allowed his power to be exercised by royal princes whose rivalries caused deep divisions in France. Henry V was well aware of these divisions and hoped to exploit them. In 1414 while he held court at [[Leicester]], he received ambassadors from Burgundy.{{sfn|Allmand|2010}} Henry accredited envoys to the French king to make clear his territorial claims in France; he also demanded the hand of Charles VI's youngest daughter [[Catherine of Valois]]. The French rejected his demands, leading Henry to prepare for war.{{sfn|Allmand|2010}}

====Battle of Agincourt (1415)====
{{Main|Battle of Agincourt}}
[[File:Agincour.JPG|thumb|Fifteenth-century miniature depicting the [[Battle of Agincourt]] of 1415.]]

In August 1415, [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] sailed from England with a force of about 10,500 and laid siege to [[Harfleur]]. The city resisted for longer than expected, but finally surrendered on 22 September 1415. Because of the unexpected delay, most of the campaign season was gone. Rather than march on Paris directly, Henry elected to make a raiding expedition across France toward English-occupied Calais. In a campaign reminiscent of [[Crécy]], he found himself outmaneuvered and low on supplies and had to fight a much larger French army at the [[Battle of Agincourt]], north of the [[Somme (river)|Somme]]. Despite the problems and having a smaller force, his victory was near-total; the French defeat was catastrophic, costing the lives of many of the Armagnac leaders. About 40% of the French nobility was killed.{{sfn|Turchin|2003|pp=179–180}} Henry was apparently concerned that the large number of prisoners taken were a security risk (there were more French prisoners than there were soldiers in the entire English army) and he ordered their deaths.{{sfn|Allmand|2010}}

====Treaty of Troyes (1420)====
{{Main|Treaty of Troyes}}
[[File:Clan member crest badge - Clan Carmichael.svg|thumb|[[Clan Carmichael]] crest with broken lance commemorating the unseating of the Duke of Clarence.]]

Henry retook much of Normandy, including Caen in 1417, and [[Rouen]] on 19 January 1419, turning Normandy English for the first time in two centuries. A formal alliance was made with the Duchy of Burgundy, which had taken Paris after the assassination of Duke [[John the Fearless]] in 1419. In 1420, Henry met with King Charles VI. They signed the [[Treaty of Troyes]], by which Henry finally married Charles' daughter Catherine of Valois and Henry's heirs would inherit the throne of France. The Dauphin, [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]], was declared illegitimate. Henry formally entered Paris later that year and the agreement was ratified by the [[French States-General|Estates-General]].{{sfn|Allmand|2010}}

====Death of Clarence (1421)====
On 22 March 1421 Henry V's progress in his French campaign experienced an unexpected reverse. Henry had left his brother and presumptive heir [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]] in charge while he returned to England. Clarence engaged a Franco-Scottish force of 5000 men, led by [[Gilbert Motier de La Fayette]] and [[John Stewart, Earl of Buchan]] at the [[Battle of Baugé]]. Clarence, against the advice of his lieutenants, before his army had been fully assembled, attacked with a force of no more than 1500 men-at-arms. He then, during the course of the battle, led a charge of a few hundred men into the main body of the Franco-Scottish army, who quickly enveloped the English. In the ensuing melée, the Scot, John Carmichael of Douglasdale, broke his lance unhorsing the Duke of Clarence. Once on the ground, the duke was slain by [[Sir Alexander Buchanan|Alexander Buchanan]].{{sfn|Allmand|2010}}{{sfn|Wagner|2006|pp=44–45}} The body of the Duke of Clarence was recovered from the field by [[Thomas Montacute, 4th Earl of Salisbury]], who conducted the English retreat.{{sfn|Harriss|2010}}

===English success===
Henry V returned to France and went to Paris, then visiting Chartres and Gâtinais before returning to Paris. From there, he decided to attack the Dauphin-held town of [[Meaux]]. It turned out to be more difficult to overcome than first thought. The siege began about 6 October 1421, and the town held for seven months before finally falling on 11 May 1422.{{sfn|Allmand|2010}}

At the end of May, Henry was joined by his queen and together with the French court, they went to rest at [[Senlis]]. While there, it became apparent that he was ill (possibly [[dysentery]]), and when he set out to the Upper Loire, he diverted to the royal castle at Vincennes, near Paris, where he died on 31 August 1422.{{sfn|Allmand|2010}} The elderly and insane Charles VI of France died two months later on 21 October 1422. Henry left an only child, his nine-month-old son, [[Henry VI of England|Henry]], later to become Henry VI.{{sfn|Griffiths|2015}}

On his deathbed, Henry V had given the Duke of Bedford responsibility for English France (as Henry VI was only an infant). The war in France continued under Bedford's generalship and several battles were won. The English won an emphatic victory at the [[Battle of Verneuil]] (17 August 1424). At the Battle of Baugé, Clarence had rushed into battle without the support of his archers. At Verneuil, the archers fought to devastating effect against the Franco-Scottish army. The effect of the battle was to virtually destroy the Dauphin's field army and to eliminate the Scots as a significant military force for the rest of the war.{{sfn|Griffiths|2015}}{{sfn|Wagner|2006|pp=307–308}}

==French victory: 1429–1453==

===Joan of Arc and French revival===
[[File:Joan of arc miniature graded.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Joan of Arc]] (picture c.1450–1500)]]

The appearance of [[Joan of Arc]] at the [[siege of Orléans]] sparked a revival of French spirit, and the tide began to turn against the English.{{sfn|Griffiths|2015}} The English laid [[siege]] to Orléans in 1428, but their force was insufficient to fully [[investment (military)|invest]] the city. In 1429 Joan convinced the Dauphin to send her to the siege, saying she had received visions from God telling her to drive out the English. She raised the morale of the troops, and they attacked the English [[redoubt]]s, forcing the English to lift the siege. Inspired by Joan, the French took several English strongholds on the Loire.{{sfn|Davis|2003|pp=76–80}}

The English retreated from the Loire Valley, pursued by a French army. Near the village of [[Battle of Patay|Patay]], French cavalry broke through a unit of English longbowmen that had been sent to block the road, then swept through the retreating English army. The English lost 2,200 men, and the commander, [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury]], was taken prisoner. This victory opened the way for the Dauphin to march to [[Reims]] for his coronation as Charles VII, on 16 July 1429.{{sfn|Davis|2003|pp=76–80}}&lt;ref name=nrofast&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.norfolk.gov.uk/view/NCC110270 |title=Sir John Fastolf (MC 2833/1) |publisher=[[Norfolk Record Office]] |place=[[Norwich]] |accessdate=20 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923173236/http://www.archives.norfolk.gov.uk/view/NCC110270# |archive-date=23 September 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the coronation, Charles VII's army fared less well. An attempted French [[Siege of Paris (1429)|siege of Paris]] was defeated on 8 September 1429, and Charles VII withdrew to the Loire Valley.{{sfn|Jaques|2007|p=777}}

===Henry's coronations and the desertion of Burgundy===
[[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] was crowned king of England at Westminster Abbey on 5 November 1429 and king of France at Notre-Dame, in Paris, on 16 December 1431.{{sfn|Griffiths|2015}}

[[File:Siege orleans.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|The first Western image of a battle with cannon: the [[Siege of Orleans|Siege of Orléans]] in 1429.]]

Joan of Arc was captured by the Burgundians at the [[siege of Compiègne]] on 23 May 1430. The Burgundians transferred her to the English, who organised a trial headed by [[Pierre Cauchon]], Bishop of Beauvais and member of the English Council at Rouen. Joan was convicted and burned at the stake on 30 May 1431.{{sfn|Davis|2003|pp=76–80}} (She was rehabilitated 25 years later by [[Pope Callixtus III]].)

After the death of Joan of Arc, the fortunes of war turned dramatically against the English.{{sfn|Lee|1998|pp=145–147}} Most of Henry's royal advisers were against making peace. Among the factions, the Duke of Bedford wanted to defend Normandy, the Duke of Gloucester was committed to just Calais, whereas [[Cardinal Beaufort]] was inclined to peace. Negotiations stalled. It seems that at the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|congress of Arras]], in the summer of 1435, where the duke of Beaufort was mediator, the English were unrealistic in their demands. A few days after the congress ended in September, [[Philip III, duke of Burgundy]], deserted to Charles VII, signing the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|Treaty of Arras]] that returned Paris to the King of France. This was a major blow to English sovereignty in France.{{sfn|Griffiths|2015}} The Duke of Bedford died on 14 September 1435 and was later replaced by [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]].{{sfn|Lee|1998|pp=145–147}}

===French resurgence===
[[File:Vigiles du roi Charles VII 32.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Formigny]] (1450)]]

The allegiance of Burgundy remained fickle, but the English focus on expanding their domains in the Low Countries left them little energy to intervene in the rest of France.{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=562}} The long truces that marked the war gave Charles time to centralise the French state and reorganise his army and government, replacing his feudal levies with a more modern professional army that could put its superior numbers to good use. A castle that once could only be captured after a prolonged siege would now fall after a few days from cannon bombardment. The French artillery developed a reputation as the best in the world.{{sfn|Lee|1998|pp=145–147}}

By 1449, the French had retaken [[Rouen]]. In 1450 the [[Counts of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis|Count of Clermont]] and [[Arthur III, Duke of Brittany|Arthur de Richemont]], Earl of Richmond, of the Montfort family (the future [[Arthur III, Duke of Brittany]]), caught an English army attempting to relieve Caen and defeated it at the [[Battle of Formigny]]. Richemont's force attacked the English army from the flank and rear just as they were on the verge of beating Clermont's army.{{sfn|Nicolle|2012|pp=26–35}}

===Fall of Gascony===
[[File:Charles VII by Jean Fouquet 1445 1450.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charles VII of France|Charles "the Victorious"]] by [[Jean Fouquet]]. [[Louvre]], Paris.]]
After Charles VII's successful Normandy campaign in 1450, he concentrated his efforts on Gascony, the last province held by the English. Bordeaux, Gascony's capital, was besieged and surrendered to the French on 30 June 1451. Largely due to the English sympathies of the Gascon people, this was reversed when John Talbot and his army retook the city on 23 October 1452. However, the English were decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Castillon]] on 17 July 1453. Talbot had been persuaded to engage the French army at Castillon near Bordeaux. During the battle the French appeared to retreat towards their camp. The French camp at Castillon had been laid out by Charles VII's ordnance officer [[Jean Bureau]] and this was instrumental in the French success as when the French cannon opened fire, from their positions in the camp, the English took severe casualties losing both Talbot and his son.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=79}}

===End of the war===
Although the Battle of Castillon is considered the last battle of the Hundred Years' War,{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=79}} England and France remained formally at war for another 20 years, but the English were in no position to carry on the war as they faced unrest at home. Following defeat in the Hundred Years' War, English landowners complained vociferously about the financial losses resulting from the loss of their continental holdings; this is often considered a major cause of the [[Wars of the Roses]], that started in 1455.{{sfn|Lee|1998|pp=145–147}}&lt;ref name=webster39&gt;"Every version of the complaints put forward by the rebels in 1450 harps on the losses in France" {{harv|Webster|1998|pp=39–40}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Campaignbox Burgundian Wars}}
The Hundred Years' War almost resumed in 1474, when the duke [[Charles the Bold|Charles of Burgundy]], counting on English support, [[Burgundian Wars|took up arms]] against [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]]. Louis managed to isolate the Burgundians by buying [[Edward IV of England]] off with a large cash sum and an annual pension, in the [[Treaty of Picquigny]] (1475). The treaty formally ended the Hundred Years' War with Edward renouncing his claim to the throne of France. However, future Kings of England (and later of Great Britain) continued to [[English claims to the French throne|claim the title]] until 1803, when they were dropped in deference to the exiled Count of Provence, titular King [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], who was living in England after the [[French Revolution]].{{sfn|Neillands|2001|pp=290–291}}

==Significance==
[[File:Map France 1477-en.svg|thumb|Burgundian territories (orange/yellow) and limits of France (red) after the Burgundian War]]

===Historical significance===

The French victory marked the end of a long period of instability that had started with the [[Norman Conquest]] (1066), when [[William the Conqueror]] added "King of England" to his titles, becoming both the vassal to (as Duke of Normandy) and the equal of (as king of England) the king of France.{{sfn|Janvrin|Rawlinson|2016|p=15}}

When the war ended, England was bereft of its Continental possessions, leaving it with only Calais on the continent. The war destroyed the English dream of a joint monarchy and led to the rejection in England of all things French, but the [[Anglo-Norman language|French language in England]], which had served as the language of the ruling classes and commerce there from the time of the Norman conquest, left many vestiges in English vocabulary. English became the official language in 1362 and French was no longer used for teaching from 1385.{{sfn|Janvrin|Rawlinson|2016|p=16}}

National feeling that emerged from the war unified both France and England further. Despite the devastation on its soil, the Hundred Years' War accelerated the process of transforming France from a feudal monarchy to a centralised state.{{sfn|Holmes Jr.|Schutz|1948|p=61}} In England the political and financial troubles which emerged from the defeat were a major cause of the [[War of the Roses]] (1455–1487).&lt;ref name=webster39/&gt;

[[File:Bubonic plague map.PNG|thumb|The spread of the [[Black Death]] (with modern borders)]]
Lowe (1997) argued that opposition to the war helped to shape England's early modern political culture. Although anti-war and pro-peace spokesmen generally failed to influence outcomes at the time, they had a long-term impact. England showed decreasing enthusiasm for conflict deemed not in the national interest, yielding only losses in return for high economic burdens. In comparing this English cost-benefit analysis with French attitudes, given that both countries suffered from weak leaders and undisciplined soldiers, Lowe noted that the French understood that warfare was necessary to expel the foreigners occupying their homeland. Furthermore, French kings found alternative ways to finance the war – sales taxes, debasing the coinage – and were less dependent than the English on tax levies passed by national legislatures. English anti-war critics thus had more to work with than the French.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lowe|1997|pp=147–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bubonic [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and warfare reduced population numbers throughout Europe during this period. France lost half its population during the Hundred Years' War.{{sfn|Turchin|2003|pp=179–180}} [[Normandy]] lost three-quarters of its population, and Paris two-thirds.{{sfn|Ladurie|1987|p=[{{google books|VT9rIMQFt2MC|pg=PA32|plainurl=yes}} 32]}} The population of England was reduced by 20 to 33 percent due to plague in the same period.{{sfn|Neillands|2001|pp=110–111}}

===Military significance===

In 1445 the first regular standing army in Western Europe since Roman times was organised in France partly as a solution to marauding free companies. The mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the Royal army as [[compagnies d'ordonnance]] on a permanent basis, or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused. France gained a total standing army of around 6,000 men, which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own. The new standing army had a more disciplined and professional approach to warfare than its predecessors.&lt;ref name="RolandPreston1991"&gt;{{harvnb|Preston|Wise|Werner|1991|pp=84–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hundred Years' War was a time of rapid military evolution. Weapons, tactics, army structure and the social meaning of war all changed, partly in response to the war's costs, partly through advancement in technology and partly through lessons that [[warfare]] taught. The feudal system was slowly disintegrating throughout the hundred years war.

By the war's end, although the heavy cavalry was still considered the most powerful unit in an army, the heavily armored horse had to deal with several tactics developed to deny or mitigate its effective use on a battlefield.{{sfn|Powicke|1962|p=189}} The English began using lightly armoured mounted troops, known as [[hobelar]]s. Hobelars tactics had been developed against the Scots, in the Anglo-Scottish wars of the 14th century. Hobelars rode smaller unarmoured horses, enabling them to move through difficult or boggy terrain where heavier cavalry would struggle. Rather than fight while seated on the horse, they would dismount to engage the enemy.&lt;ref name="RolandPreston1991" /&gt;&lt;ref name=rogers267&gt;Colm McNamee. Hobelars ''in'' {{harvnb|Rogers|2010|pp=267–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Jones|2008|pp=1–17}}

The satellite was successfully launched into space on December 15, 1981, at 23:35 UTC, by means of an [[Atlas-Centaur|Atlas SLV-3D Centaur-D1AR]] vehicle from the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], Florida, United States. It had a launch mass of 1,928&amp;nbsp;kg. The Intelsat 503 was equipped with 4 [[Ku-band]] transponders more 21 [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] [[transponder]]s for 12,000 audio circuits and 2 TV channels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3502">The '''Liechtensteiner Volksblatt''' is the older of the two daily newspapers in [[Liechtenstein]]. It is published by the Liechtensteiner Volksblatt AG, and as of 2015, had a circulation of 9,000 copies. The Thursday edition is distributed as a large print run, with an estimated circulation of 21,000 copies. &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; The editorial office is located in [[Schaan]].

== History ==

The newspaper was first published on 16 August 1878 &lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; as the ''Press Association Liechtensteiner Volksblatt''. The Royal Chaplain Johann Fetz was the founder and first editor, serving in that capacity until 1884.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; Up until 1918, it was published as a weekly newspaper, until it began printing twice weekly until 1919. The company gradually increased its rate of publication, from three editions per week starting in 1927, expanding to four in 1962, and then five times a week in 1978. Since January 1985, the paper has printed every day, except Sunday.

The Oberland newspaper is generally considered to have a conservative outlook, and regularly agrees with the positions of the reigning [[Prince of Liechtenstein]], and the [[Progressive Citizens' Party]]. Since September 2006, the paper has been published by "Liechtensteiner Volksblatt AG", a private publishing house which emerged from the former Press Club. In October 2006, the Vorarlberg media entrepreneur Eugen Russ (Vorarlberger Medienhaus &lt;sup&gt;[4]) also holds a minority stake in the publishing house.&lt;/sup&gt; The majority shares are still in possession of the Royal Family of Liechtenstein.

The ''Liechtensteiner Volksblatt'' is financed through subscriptions and the sale of advertisements. The newspaper is published in the German language, and is primarily covers current affairs in Liechtenstein, though also providing some coverage of Switzerland and Austria.

== Structure ==
The ''Liechtensteiner Volksblatt'' is usually organised into eight sections:
* The title page, with current news
* News in Liechtenstein
* European politics, as well as some global coverage
* Business and financial section
* Sports
* Culture and arts
* Weather and industry advertisements
* Panorama

== Literature  ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8165">This is a '''list of cities in [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN)'''.

==Largest cities==

This list features the most populous cities in ASEAN. Population figures were taken from within the city proper only. See the article on each city for sources. Myanmar data is the least reliable and subject to revision. It is important to note, that the general area of Metro Manila has been divided into its political cities and is not counted as one urban city in this ranking. Therefore the metropolis' true population is not reflected in this ranking (it would otherwise be first or second in population size, depending on the definition of Jakarta's true city area).

'''Marisat 3''' (or '''Marisat F3''') is a [[communications satellite]] operated by [[COMSAT]]. Marisat 3 was the second of a series of COMSAT maritime [[communications]] [[satellite]]s.

== Satellite ==
The satellite was operated at orbital position of 176 degrees east from 1976 to 1991. It was transferred to 182° E (178° W) and operated there until 1996. It was transferred to 326.1° E (33.9° W), Over the Atlantic Ocean, and since 1999 has been providing a broadband data link to the US [[National Antarctic Foundation]] in [[Antarctica]] at the [[South Pole]]'s [[Amundsen-Scott|Amundsen-Scott research station]]. The same was transferred to [[Intelsat]] in 2004. On Wednesday, October 29, 2008, after 32 years of service, the longest for any commercial satellite to date, was removed from active service. Intelsat engineers used the remaining fuel on board to raise the orbit about 125 miles (200&amp;nbsp;km) above the [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] arc and put it into an array orbit.

== Launch ==
Marisat 3 was launched by a [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta]] rocket from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], Florida, at 22:44 UTC on October 14, 1976.&lt;ref name="nssdc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1976-101A|title=Marisat 3|work=NSSDC Master Catalog|accessdate=May 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions''' ({{lang-no|Landsorganisasjonen i Norge}}, LO) is a [[national trade union center]], decidedly the largest and probably the most influential [[umbrella organization]] of [[trade union|labour union]]s in [[Norway]]. The 21 national unions affiliated to the LO have almost 900,000 members of a Norwegian population of 5 million. The majority of affiliated unions organizes traditional blue collar workers, but the largest affiliate is the [[Norwegian Union of Municipal and General Employees]] which makes up more than a third of all members.&lt;ref&gt;Ole Storeng (3 May 2013): [http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kommentarer/Lederskifte-gir-ingen-revolusjon-7193139.html#.UYfdLcrJIgQ Lederskifte gir ingen revolusjon] {{no icon}} ''[[Aftenposten]]'', retrieved 6 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; LO is affiliated to the [[International Trade Union Confederation|ITUC]] and the [[ETUC]]. [[Gerd Kristiansen]] was elected leader on 6 May 2013 for a four-year period.

It was named the Workers' National Trade Union ({{lang-no|Arbeidernes Faglige Landsorganisasjon}}, AFL) from 1899 to 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gran|first=Thorvald|title=The State in the Modernization Process.

[[Ingvald B. Aase]] served as treasurer from 1934 until his death in 1948.&lt;ref name=nsd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsd.uib.no/polsys/index.cfm?urlname=storting&amp;lan=&amp;MenuItem=N1_1&amp;ChildItem=&amp;State=collapse&amp;UttakNr=33&amp;person=10056|title=Ingvald Berentin Aase|publisher=Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD)|language=Norwegian|accessdate=13 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization owns the [[Norwegian Labour Movement Archives and Library]].&lt;ref name=jstor&gt;{{cite journal|last=Halvorsen|first=Solveig|title=The Norwegian Labour Movement Archives And Library|journal=Saothar|year=1995|volume=20|pages=105–107|jstor=23197247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered as being part of the "Labour Sphere" in Norway.

The '''religion in Liechtenstein''' is predominantly [[Catholicism|Catholic]], with a minority of [[Protestants]], non-adherents, and adherents of other religions.&lt;ref name="Enopaedia Britannica Almanac 2009"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopædia Britannica Almanac 2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2nxLkMspauIC&amp;pg=PA392|accessdate=31 July 2012|date=25 March 2009|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|isbn=978-1-59339-839-2|page=392}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liechtenstein has a small Muslim population, composed mainly of immigrants from countries like [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Serbia]], and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="US"/&gt;

[[Liechtenstein]] is a small, landlocked country located in the [[Alpine country|Alpine region]] of [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="WaldmanMason2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carl Waldman|author2=Catherine Mason|title=Encyclopedia of European Peoples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kfv6HKXErqAC&amp;pg=PA486|accessdate=31 July 2012|year=2006|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-2918-1|pages=486–487}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2002, 83.9% of Liechtenstein's population is Christian. In terms of religious demographics, 76% follow Catholicism, 7% follow Protestant Christianity, 4.2% follow [[Islam]], 0.8% follow [[Orthodox Christianity]], and 12% are either nonreligious or adherents of other faiths.&lt;ref name="Enopaedia Britannica Almanac 2009" /&gt; In Liechtenstein, 44% of Muslims, 23% of Catholic Christians, and 24% of non-Catholic Christians regularly participate in weekly religious services.&lt;ref name="US"&gt;{{cite web|title=Liechtenstein|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2009/127320.htm|work=International Religious Freedom Report 2009|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]], as written in the [[Constitution of Liechtenstein]], is the official [[state religion]] of Liechtenstein.

Before 1997, within the Catholic church, the [[principality]] was part of the Swiss [[Diocese of Chur]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="73239">The '''Turks in Europe'''  (sometimes called '''Euro-Turks'''; {{lang-tr|Avrupa'da yaşayan Türkler}} or ''Avrupa Türkleri'') refers to ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks]] living in [[Europe]]. Most Turks in Europe live in [[European Turkey]], but there is also a sizeable [[Turkish diaspora]] in countries such as [[Turks in Germany|Germany]]. This diaspora includes two groups: [[guest workers]] who migrated to western Europe in recent decades, and [[Turkish minorities in the former Ottoman Empire|historic Turkish minorities]] in southeastern Europe who trace their origin back to the Ottoman era.

Turks have had a long history in Europe dating back to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era when they began to conquer and migrate to Eastern Europe during the Ottoman conquests (see the [[Ottoman territories in Europe]]) which, other than Turkey, created significant [[Turkish minorities|Turkish communities]] in [[Turks in Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] ([[Bulgarian Turks]]), [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] ([[Turks in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Turks]]), [[Cyprus]] ([[Turkish Cypriots]]), [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] ([[Meskhetian Turks]]), [[Greece]] ([[Cretan Turks]], [[Turks of the Dodecanese|Dodecanese Turks]], and [[Turks of Western Thrace|Western Thrace Turks]]), [[Kosovo]]{{efn|name=status}} ([[Kosovan Turks]]), [[Serbia]] ([[Turks in Serbia]]), the [[Republic of Macedonia]] ([[Macedonian Turks]]), and [[Romania]] ([[Romanian Turks]]).

Modern immigration of Turks to Western Europe began with [[Turkish Cypriots]] migrating to the [[United Kingdom]] in the early 1920s when the [[British Empire]] annexed Cyprus in 1914 and the residents of Cyprus became subjects of the Crown. However, Turkish Cypriot migration increased significantly in the 1940s and 1950s due to the [[Cyprus conflict]]. Conversely, in 1944, Turks who were forcefully deported from [[Meskheti]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] during the [[Second World War]], known as the [[Meskhetian Turks]], settled in Eastern Europe (especially in [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Russia]], and [[Ukraine]]). By the early 1960s, migration to Western and Northern Europe increased significantly from Turkey when Turkish "[[guest workers]]" arrived under a "Labour Export Agreement" with [[Germany]] in 1961, followed by a similar agreement with the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[Austria]] in 1964; [[France]] in 1965; and [[Sweden]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="Akgündüz 2008 loc=61"&gt;{{Harvnb|Akgündüz|2008|loc=61}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kasaba|2008|loc=192}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Twigg|Schaefer|Austin|Parker|2005|loc=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Bulgarian Turks, Romanian Turks, and Western Thrace Turks have also migrated to Western Europe.

== History ==

=== Ottoman migration ===
[[File:OttomanEmpireIn1683.png|thumb|Ottoman Turks migrated to various parts of Europe during the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]]; thus, large communities have been formed due to Turkish [[colonisation]], especially in [[Bulgaria]], the island of [[Cyprus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (especially in [[Meskheti]]), [[Greece]] (mainly in [[Western Thrace]]), [[Kosovo]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], and [[Romania]].]]
{{see also|Turkish minorities|List of Ottoman Empire territories}}
During the rule of the Ottoman Empire (1299-1923), Turkish settlers began to move into the [[Ottoman territories in Europe]] as part of the Turkish expansion, because these Turkish communities migrated to these countries during the Ottoman rule, they are not considered part of the modern [[Turkish diaspora]]. However, these populations, which have different nationalities, still share the same ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious origins as today's Turkish nationals.

====Balkan Turks====
The conquest of the [[Balkans]] by the Ottomans set in motion important population movements of Turks brought over from [[Anatolia]] and [[Asia Minor]], establishing a firm Turkish base for further conquests in Europe.&lt;ref name="Eminov 1997 loc=27"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eminov|1997|loc=27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Ottomans used colonization as a very effective method to consolidate their position and power in the Balkans. The colonizers that were brought to the Balkans consisted of soldiers, nomads, farmers, artisans and [[merchants]], [[dervishes]], [[preachers]] and other religious functionaries, and administrative personnel. Densely populated Turkish colonies were established in the frontier regions of [[Thrace]], the [[Maritsa]] and the [[Tundzha]] valleys.&lt;ref name="Eminov 1997 loc=27"/&gt; In addition to voluntary migrations, throughout the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries, the Ottoman authorities also used mass [[deportations]] ("sürgün") as a method of control over potentially rebellious individuals.&lt;ref name="Eminov 1997 loc=28"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eminov|1997|loc=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the greatest impacts of the Ottoman colonization process of the Balkans was felt in the urban centres, many towns became major centres for Turkish control and administration, with most [[Christians]] gradually withdrawing to the mountains. The Ottomans embarked on creating new towns and repopulating older towns that had suffered significant population decline and economic dislocation during the wars preceding the Ottoman conquests.&lt;ref name="Eminov 1997 loc=28"/&gt; Major Balkan towns, especially those on or near transportation and communication routes, were the focal point of Ottoman colonization in the Balkans. Most urban centres in the Balkans, especially in Thrace, [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Thessaly]], and [[Moesia]], achieved Muslim/Turkish majorities or substantial minorities soon after the completion of the conquest and remained overwhelmingly Muslim in composition into the eighteenth century, and in some areas such as Macedonia and [[Bulgaria]] well into the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Eminov 1997 loc=31"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eminov|1997|loc=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, many Turks were displaced, most of them fleeing to Anatolia. At present, there are still significant Turkish minorities living in [[Bulgaria]], the province of [[East Macedonia and Thrace]] in [[Northern Greece]], [[Kosovo]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], and [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaser|2010|loc=88}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Meskhetian Turks====
{{main article|Meskhetian Turks}}
The Meskhetian Turks, also known as Ahiska Turks, are the descendants of Turkish colonizers who reside, or used to reside, in [[Meskheti]] which is in the southwestern region of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. The region came under Ottoman rule in the sixteenth century up until 1829. Today, approximately 600 to 1,000 Meskhetian Turks are still living in Georgia,&lt;ref name="Aydıngün 2006 loc=13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aydıngün|Harding|Hoover|Kuznetsov|2006|loc=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the population drastically decreased in 1944 when [[Joseph Stalin]] deported approximately 100,000 of these Turks to Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aydıngün|Harding|Hoover|Kuznetsov|2006|loc=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Turkish Cypriots}}
The Ottoman Turks conquered [[Cyprus]] in 1571 when they began a campaign which led to the fall of [[Nicosia]] in September 1570 and of [[Famagusta]] in August 1571.&lt;ref name="Fisher 2003 loc=250"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fisher|2003|loc=250}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1571, about 30,000 Turkish settlers, which included soldiers who were involved in the conquest and their families, or agricultural colonizers, particularly from the [[Konya]] region, were given land on the island.&lt;ref name="Drury 2003 loc=1981"&gt;{{Harvnb|Drury|1981|loc=290}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fisher 2003 loc=250"/&gt; Additionally, many of the islanders converted to [[Islam]] during the early years of Ottoman rule due significant advantages to being Christian (i.e. taxation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Christians and Muslims in Ottoman Cyprus and the Mediterranean World, 1571-1640|last=Jennings|first=Ronald|publisher=New York University Press|year=1993|isbn=0814741819|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a strong Turkish element was formed in Cyprus’s population, which was later reinforced by immigration from Asia Minor.&lt;ref name="Fisher 2003 loc=250"/&gt;

====Ottoman galley slaves and traders in Western Europe====
As early as the 13th century [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] slaves (Oghuz and Kipchak [[Mameluks]]), from [[Central Asia]] and the [[Pontic Steppe]], had been sold to northern Italian city states by Arab traders.&lt;ref&gt;Iris Origo, The Domestic Enemy: The Eastern Slaves in Tuscany in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries Speculum:A Journal of Mediaeval Studies 30&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the slaves were bought free and mixed in with the local Italian population. At least from the 16th century onwards Ottoman traders settled in western European trading capitols such as Antwerp, Amsterdam&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}}[http://www.nltr400.nl/nl/relatie-turkije-nederland/geschiedenis-betrekkingen/#1568 History of Relations] from NLTR400, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;  and London.&lt;ref&gt;Gilliat-Ray, Sophie (2010), Muslims in Britain: An Introduction, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish traders in the Netherlands had at least two mosques in Amsterdam in the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}}[http://www.radio1.nl/items/41809-liever-turks-dan-paaps Rather Turkish than Papist] Historian [[Herman Pleij]] on Turkish-Dutch relations in 'dit is de dag', EO, Radio 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern migration ===
{{see also|Guest workers|Gastarbeiter}}
According to an estimate in the [[European Union]] there are 3,7 million ethnic Turks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkey's EU accession|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hqR3H5CaW1gC&amp;pg=RA1-PA42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Turkish Cypriot migration to Great Britain (1920s-present)====
{{see also|Turkish Cypriots|Turks in the United Kingdom}}
Turkish Cypriots started to immigrate from Cyprus to the United Kingdom in the early 1920s when the British Empire annexed Cyprus in 1914 and the residents of Cyprus became subjects of the Crown.&lt;ref name="Yilmaz 2005 loc=153"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Yilmaz|2005|loc=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Turkish Cypriots went to the United Kingdom as students and tourists whilst others left the island due to the harsh economic and political life during the [[British Colony]] of Cyprus.&lt;ref name="Sonyel 2000 loc=147"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Sonyel|2000|loc=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emigration to the United Kingdom continued to increase when the [[Great Depression]] of 1929 brought [[economic depression]] to Cyprus, with unemployment and low wages being a significant issue.&lt;ref name="Hüssein 2007 loc=16"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Hüssein|2007|loc=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yilmaz 2005 loc=154"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Yilmaz|2005|loc=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hüssein 2007 loc=16"/&gt; During the [[Second World War]], the number of Turkish run businesses increased which created a demand for more Turkish Cypriot workers.&lt;ref name="Ansari 2004 loc=151"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ansari|2004|loc=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, throughout the 1950s, Turkish Cypriots emigrated to the United Kingdom for economic reasons and by 1958 the number of Turkish Cypriots was estimated to be 8,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ansari|2004|loc=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their numbers increased each year as rumours about immigration restrictions appeared in much of the Cypriot media.&lt;ref name="Yilmaz 2005 loc=154"/&gt;
[[File:Kibrisyur.jpg|thumb|There are about 300,000 to 350,000 [[Turkish Cypriots]], out of a total of 500,000 British Turks, living in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Home Affairs Committee 2011 loc=Ev 34"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hurriyet&gt;{{cite web|title=İngiltere'deki Türkler

Furthermore, the 1950s saw the arrival of many more Turkish Cypriots to the United Kingdom who felt vulnerable as they had cause for concern about the political future of the island.&lt;ref name="Ansari 2004 loc=151"/&gt; This was first evident when the [[Greek Cypriots]] held a referendum in 1950 in which 95.7% of eligible Greek Cypriot voters cast their ballots in supporting a fight aimed at uniting Cyprus with Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Panteli|1990|loc=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, Turkish Cypriots fled to the United Kingdom due to the [[EOKA]] terrorists and its aim of [[Enosis]].&lt;ref name="Sonyel 2000 loc=147"/&gt; By the 1960s, inter-ethnic fighting broke out and by 1964 some 25,000 Turkish Cypriots became internally displaced, accounting to about a fifth of their population;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Cassia|2007|loc=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kliot 2007 loc=59"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Kliot|2007|loc=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; furthermore, approximately 60,000 Turkish Cypriots were forcefully moved into [[Turkish Cypriot enclaves]] within Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Tocci|2004|loc=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period in Cypriot history resulted in an exodus of more Turkish Cypriots to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Sonyel 2000 loc=147"/&gt; Other reasons for the continued migration to the United Kingdom was because of the economic gap which was widening in Cyprus. The Greek Cypriots were increasingly taking control of the country’s major institutions causing the Turkish Cypriots to become economically disadvantaged.&lt;ref name="Ansari 2004 loc=151"/&gt; Thus, the political and economic unrest in Cyprus after 1964 sharply increased the number of Turkish Cypriot immigrants to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Yilmaz 2005 loc=154"/&gt; Many of these early migrants worked in the clothing industry in London, where both men and women could work together- sewing was a skill which the community had already acquired in Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Bridgwood|1995|loc=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish Cypriots were concentrated mainly in the north-east of London and specialised in the heavy-wear sector, such as coats and tailored garments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Panayiotopoulos |Dreef|2002|loc=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=London Evening Standard|title=Turkish and proud to be here |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-931666-turkish-and-proud-to-be-here.do|accessdate=2010-10-02|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5vvnHkkSt |archivedate = 2011-01-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sector offered work opportunities where poor knowledge of the English language was not a problem and where self-employment was a possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Strüder|2003|loc=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|Greek military junta]] rose to power in 1967, Greece staged a [[coup d'état]] in 1974 against the Cypriot President, with the help of [[EOKA B]], to unite the island with Greece.&lt;ref name="Savvides 2004 loc=260"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Savvides|2004|loc=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a military offensive by [[Turkey]] who [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invaded the island]].&lt;ref name="Kliot 2007 loc=59"/&gt; By 1983, the Turkish Cypriots declared their own state, the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] (TRNC), which has since remained internationally unrecognised except by Turkey. The division of the island led to an economic embargo against the Turkish Cypriots by the Greek Cypriot controlled Government of Cyprus. This had the effect of depriving the Turkish Cypriots of foreign investment, aid and export markets; thus, it caused the [[Economy of Northern Cyprus|Turkish Cypriot economy]] to remain stagnant and undeveloped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Tocci|2004|loc=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these economic and political issues, an estimated 130,000 Turkish Cypriots have emigrated from Northern Cyprus since its establishment to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=BBC|title=Turkish today by Viv Edwardss|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/voices/multilingual/turkish.shtml|accessdate=2010-09-26|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5vyuMLzGK |archivedate = 2011-01-24|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Cassia|2007|loc=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the [[House of Commons, Home Affairs Committee]] suggested that there are now about 300,000 Turkish Cypriots living in the UK.&lt;ref name="Home Affairs Committee 2011 loc=Ev 34"&gt;{{Harvnb|Home Affairs Committee|2011|loc=Ev 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Meskhetian Turkish migration within Eastern Europe (1944-present)====
{{see also|Meskhetian Turks|Turks in the former Soviet Union}}
The Meskhetian Turks, originally living in Meskheti (now known as [[Samtskhe-Javakheti]]) which is a part of southern Georgia, are widely dispersed throughout the former [[Soviet Union]] (150,000 live in [[Kazakhstan]], 90,000-110,000 in [[Azerbaijan]], 70,000-90,000 in Russia, 50,000 in [[Kyrgyzstan]], 15,000 in [[Uzbekistan]] and 10,000 in [[Ukraine]]&lt;ref name="Aydıngün 2006 loc=13-14"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aydıngün|Harding|Hoover|Kuznetsov|2006|loc=13-14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) as a result of forced deportations and discrimination which began in 1944. During [[World War II]], the [[Soviet Union]] was preparing to launch a pressure campaign against Turkey and [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], then [[Minister of Foreign Affairs]], formally presented a demand to the Turkish Ambassador in [[Moscow]] for the surrender of three [[Provinces of Turkey|Anatolian provinces]] ([[Kars Province|Kars]], [[Ardahan]] and [[Artvin]]); thus, war against Turkey seemed possible, and [[Joseph Stalin]] wanted to clear the strategic Turkish population (especially those situated in Meskheti) located near the Turkish-Georgian border which were likely to be hostile to Soviet intentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennigsen|Broxup|1983|loc=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, the Meskhetian Turks were forcefully deported from Meskheti in Georgia and accused of smuggling, banditry and espionage in collaboration with their kin across the Turkish border.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tomlinson|2005|loc=107}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nationalistic policies at the time encouraged the slogan: "Georgia for Georgians" and that the Meskhetian Turks should be sent to Turkey "where they belong".&lt;ref name="Kurbanov &amp; Kurbanov 1995 loc=237"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurbanov|Kurbanov|1995|loc=237}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cornell|2001|loc=183}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Stalin]] deported the Meskhetian Turks to [[Central Asia]] (especially to Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan), thousands dying en route in cattle-trucks,&lt;ref name=MRGI&gt;{{cite web |author=Minority Rights Group International|title=Meskhetian Turks|url=http://www.minorityrights.org/2531/russian-federation/meskhetians-or-meskhetian-turks.html|accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were not permitted by the Georgian government of [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] to return to their homeland.&lt;ref name="Kurbanov &amp; Kurbanov 1995 loc=237"/&gt;

In the late 1970s, the [[Stavropol]] and [[Krasnodar]] authorities in Russia visited various regions of Uzbekistan to invite and recruit Meskhetian Turks to work in agriculture enterprises in southern Russia.&lt;ref name="Ryazantsev 2009 loc=168"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ryazantsev|2009|loc=168}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1985, [[Moscow]] issued a proposal inviting more Meskhetian Turks to move to villages in southern Russia that had been abandoned by ethnic Russians who were moving to the cities. However, the Meskhetian Turks response was that they would only leave Uzbekistan if the move were to be to their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goltz|2009|loc=124}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 1989, ethnic [[Uzbeks]] began a series of actions against the Turks, they became the victims of riots in the [[Ferghana valley]] which led to over a hundred deaths. Within days, Decision 503 was announced "inviting" the Turks to occupy the empty farms in southern Russia that they had resisted moving to for years and around 17,000 Meskhetian Turks were evacuated to Russia.&lt;ref name="Ryazantsev 2009 loc=167"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ryazantsev|2009|loc=167}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goltz 2009 loc=125"&gt;{{Harvnb|Goltz|2009|loc=125}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Meskhetian Turks maintain that Moscow had planned the Uzbek riots.&lt;ref name="Goltz 2009 loc=125"/&gt; By the early 1990s, of the 70,000 Meskhetian Turks who were still resident in Uzbekistan, approximately 50,000 Meskhetian Turkish refugees went to Azerbaijan due to continued discrimination&lt;ref name="Azembassy"&gt;{{cite news|author=Embassy of the Republic of Azerbaijan to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|title=Report on mass human rights violation|url=http://www.azembassy.org.uk/sehife.php?lang=eng&amp;page=0205|date=18 December 2007|accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 2003 loc=21"&gt;{{Harvnb|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|2003|loc=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AzerbaijanInternational"&gt;{{cite news|title= Exile of the Meskheti Turks: Still Homesick Half a Century Later|url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/51_folder/51_articles/51_meskheti.html|first=Caleb|last=Daniloff|work=Azerbaijan International|year=1997|accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pentikäinen &amp; Trier 2004 loc=19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pentikäinen|Trier|2004|loc=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; whilst others went to [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] due to fears of continued violence.&lt;ref name="Ryazantsev 2009 loc=167"/&gt;

=====The "gastarbeiters" (guest workers)=====
{{see also|Gastarbeiter|Guest workers}}

The concept of the Gastarbeiter involved the agreements between the host country and Turkey which was bound up with policies of the governments involved, with state bureaucracies on both sides ultimately responsible for the dispatch and settlement of the workers.&lt;ref name="Abadan-Unat 2011 loc=12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Abadan-Unat|2011|loc=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, labor agreements were signed with several European countries- with [[Germany]] in 1961; with [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], and the [[Netherlands]] in 1964; with [[France]] in 1965; and with [[Sweden]] in 1967. The agreements were based on a principle of rotation, and a worker was expected to return home after a year of employment abroad.&lt;ref name="Abadan-Unat 2011 loc=12"/&gt; However, employers wanted to retain workers who had become accustomed to the work; therefore, the rotation principle never became practice. Workers were not permitted to take their families abroad with them, and were housed in group living quarters or dormitories known as "Heim".&lt;ref name="Abadan-Unat 2011 loc=12"/&gt;

=====Family reunifications=====
By the early 1970s, the majority of Turkish emigration to Western Europe was for the purpose of [[family reunification]]. Furthermore, by the 1990s, migration mainly by way of marriage continued to be one of the principal reasons for settling in Western Europe.

====Migration of Western Thrace Turks to Western Europe (1960s-present)====
{{see also|Guest workers|Western Thrace Turks}}
About 25,000 to 40,000 Turks of Western Thrace, who are the ethnic Turks who live in the north-eastern part of Greece, have emigrated to [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Şentürk|2008|loc=420}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Witten Batı Trakya Türkleri Yardımlaşma ve Dayanışma Derneği|title=Batı Trakya`da "Aynı Gökyüzü Altında" bir Güldeste |url=http://www.wittenbttd.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=81&amp;Itemid=35|accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 12,000 and 25,000 moved to Germany in the 1960s and 1970s, when the Thracian tobacco industry was affected by a severe crisis and many tobacco growers lost their income.&lt;ref name="Clogg 2002 loc=84"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clogg|2002|loc=84}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=International Assembly of Western Thrace Turks|title=POLITICAL AND CIVIL ORGANISATION COMMISSION|url=http://www.batitrakya.info/btt/Content.aspx?mID=4;12&amp;l=en-US|accessdate=2010-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Germany, the Netherlands is the most popular destination for Western Thrace Turks, especially in the region of [[Randstad]].&lt;ref name="Şentürk 2008 loc=427"&gt;{{Harvnb|Şentürk|2008|loc=427}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also an estimated 600-700 Western Thrace Turks living in [[London]], although the total number living outside London is unknown.&lt;ref name="Şentürk 2008 loc=427"/&gt;

According to the National Statistical Institute of Bulgaria, Bulgarian Turks make up 12% of short term migrants, 13% of long term migrants, and 12% of the labour migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ivanov|2007|loc=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unlikely that this generalisation shows a true indication of the ethnic make-up of Bulgarian citizens living abroad because Bulgarian citizens of Turkish origin make up entire majorities in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Markova|2010|loc=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, out of the 10,000 to 30,000 people from Bulgaria living in the Netherlands, the majority, of about 80%, are ethnic Turks from Bulgaria who have come from the south-eastern Bulgarian district of [[Kurdzhali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Guentcheva|Kabakchieva|Kolarski|2003|loc=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Bulgarian Turks are the fastest-growing group of immigrants in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="TheSophiaEcho"&gt;{{cite web|author=TheSophiaEcho|title=Turkish Bulgarians fastest-growing group of immigrants in the Netherlands|url=http://www.sofiaecho.com/2009/07/21/758628_turkish-bulgarians-fastest-growing-group-of-immigrants-in-the-netherlands|accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also about 30,000 Bulgarian Turks living in Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Laczko|Stacher|Klekowski von Koppenfels|2003|loc=197}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a growing community in the United Kingdom&lt;ref name="Home Affairs Committee 2011 loc=Ev 34"/&gt; and Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mancheva|2008|loc=161}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,000 in [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Balkan Türkleri Kültür ve Dayanışma Derneği|title=Avusturya'daki Bulgaristan Türkleri hala Bulgar isimlerini neden taşıyor?|url=http://balturk.org.tr/?p=2845|accessdate=2011-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yamal 102''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|'''Ямал-102'''}}) was a [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] [[communications satellite]] operated by [[Gazprom Space Systems|Gazkom]] and built by [[S. P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia|RSC Energia]].&lt;ref name=rsw-yamal /&gt; It was, along with [[Yamal 101]] the first communications satellite of the [[Yamal (satellite constellation)|Yamal]] program and the first iteration of the [[USP (satellite bus)|USP Bus]].&lt;ref name=kosmonavtika-yamalhistorie1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=kosmonavtika-yamalhistorie2 /&gt; It was a {{convert|1360|kg|abbr=on}} satellite with 2200W of power (1300W available for the payload) on an unpressurized bus.&lt;ref name=energia-usp /&gt; It had eight [[SPT-70]] [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric thrusters]] by [[OKB Fakel]] for [[Orbital station-keeping|station keeping]].&lt;ref name=gsp-energiyausp /&gt; Its payload was 12 [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] equivalent [[Transponder (satellite communications)|transponders]] supplied by [[Space Systems Loral]].&lt;ref name=kosmonavtika-yamal101tech /&gt;

==History==
It was launched along [[Yamal 101]] September 6, 1999 at 16:36 UTC from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome|Baikonur]] [[Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 81|Site 81/23]] by a [[Proton-K]]/[[Blok D|Blok-DM-2M]] directly to [[geostationary orbit|GEO]].&lt;ref name=kosmonavtika-yamal101launch /&gt;&lt;ref name=gsp-yamal101 /&gt; While its twin Yamal 101 failed, Yamal 102 successfully deployed and was commissioned into service.&lt;ref name=rsw-yamal /&gt;&lt;ref name=kosmonavtika-yamalhistorie3 /&gt; On August 9, 2010 it was decommissioned and sent to a [[graveyard orbit]]. The satellite lasted 4079 days (11 years 2 months), a bit short of the design life of 12.5 years.&lt;ref name=energia-usp /&gt;&lt;ref name=kosmonavtika-yamal101launch /&gt;

==Rename to Yamal 101==
Right after solar panel deployment [[Yamal 101]] failure irreparably. Thus, [[Gazprom Space Systems|Gazkom]] registered '''Yamal 102''' as '''Yamal 101'''. This has caused significant confusion but the records are clear that the satellite that failed was, in fact, the original Yamal 101.&lt;ref name=kosmonavtika-yamalhistorie3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=satbeams-yamal101 /&gt;
