'''''Antique Woodworking Tools: Their Craftsmanship from Earliest Times to the Twentieth Century''''' is [[David R. Russell|David Russell]]'s account of the history of woodworking tools illustrated profusely with items from his extensive collection of British, continental European and North American hand tools. 
Planes are given special attention and British makers, among them [[Holtzapffel]], [[T. Norris &amp; Son|Norris]], [[Alexander Mathieson &amp; Sons|Mathieson]] and [[Stewart Spiers|Spiers]], are discussed in depth.

==Summary==
A wide array of edge and boring tools provides a broad survey of hand tool-making from prehistory to today. Writing in ''[[The Times]]'', Huon Mallalieu encapsulated the function of the book: "Over the past 35 years [David Russell] has amassed probably the world’s largest collection of antique woodworking tools from the Stone Age to the 20th century ... The catalogue not only lists and lavishly illustrates 1556 items, but also makers’ stamps and associated material ..."&lt;ref&gt;Huon Mallalieu, "The heft of a hammer, the balance of an axe or the certainty of a saw are the links between man and material", ''The Times'', November 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
After looking at a range of tools from prehistory to the Romans, the book examines in detail more recent hand tools by function: from saws to drills and braces; from rules and gauges to bevels, squares and levels. Much of the book, however, is devoted to an extensive selection of wooden and metal planes and highlights their manifold functions. These planes are arranged within chapters on continental European, British and American models, with some of the great British makers from the eighteenth to the early twentieth century discussed in depth. A short chapter focuses on spurious and altered items, drawing the reader's attention to some of the pitfalls of collecting vintage tools.

==Critical reception==
The book has been widely acclaimed in both the general and specialized press. According to the ''[[Sheffield Telegraph]]'', "the book not only celebrates the collection but is considered the most serious work of reference of its kind to date and destined to become a 'bible' in its field".&lt;ref&gt;''Sheffield Telegraph'', December 9, 2010. [http://www.sheffieldtelegraph.co.uk/whats-on/arts/days-when-sheffielders-produced-tools-for-every-job-1-2842972 See full article].&lt;/ref&gt;
Looking at the book from another angle, Eve Kahn in the ''[[New York Times]]'' stated that the book was "intended to glamorize unsung innovations".&lt;ref&gt;Eve M. Kahn, "A Craftsman's Wares", ''New York Times'', September 13, 2013, p. C26. [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/arts/design/works-from-earliest-photographers-are-on-display-and-on-sale.html?_r=0 See full article].&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Duguay, writing in ''Canadian Woodworking &amp; Home Improvement'', declared that the book was "Lavish, stunning, outstanding, magnificent ... superlatives just don't do justice to [it]."&lt;ref&gt;Carl Duguay, "A 'must-have' for anyone who loves woodworking tools", ''Canadian Woodworking &amp; Home Improvement''  [https://www.canadianwoodworking.com/antique-woodworking-tools See full article].&lt;/ref&gt;

Journals of some of the leading tool societies have been generous in their praise. "David Russell’s book is a vehicle for sharing his fabulous collection with the world," enthused John Wells in the ''Chronicle'', the journal of the [[Early American Industries Association]]. "His unerring eye has sought out the most interesting tools available over the past 40 years, resulting in one of the world’s greatest collections of antique woodworking tools."&lt;ref&gt;John Wells, "A Bounty of Tools in an Outstanding Collector's Book", ''Chronicle'', vol. 64, no. 3, September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;   The late Frank Ham, writing in the Australian journal ''Tool Chest'', declared the book to be "the most impressive record of tools" he had ever seen.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Ham, ''Tool Chest'' (Journal of the Hand Tool Preservation Association of Australia), no. 108, May, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Focusing on the illustrations, Mark Bridge commented in ''[[Antiques Trade Gazette]]'' on how [[James Austin (photographer)|James Austin]], the book's photographer, had "managed to capture the elusive qualities of balance, texture and patina which make the finest tools a pleasure to handle, frequently lifting them into the realm of folk art".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bridge, "The young apprentice cabinetmaker who became a connoisseur", ''Antiques Trade Gazette'', October 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Portal|Software Testing}}
The '''Association for Software Testing''', commonly referred to as the '''AST''', is dedicated to advancing the understanding of the science and practice of [[software testing]] according to [http://www.context-driven-testing.com context-driven principles].  '''AST''''s membership consists of scholars, students and practitioners who are interested in the advancement of the field of [[software testing]].  The group was founded in the United States in 2004 by [[Cem Kaner]].  

AST has multiple objectives including:
* Fostering cross-pollination of ideas between scholars, students and practitioners.
* Hosting an annual conference focused on cross-community information sharing.
* Promoting ethical behavior for all software testers.
* Supporting peer workshops related to [[software testing]].

== Conference ==
The AST's first conference, named "CAST" for the Conference of the Association for Software Testing, was held in Indianapolis, Indiana in 2006 and had the theme "Influencing the Practice".

* CAST 2007 had a theme of "Testing Techniques: Innovations and Applications" and was held in Bellevue, Washington, USA
* CAST 2008 had a theme of "Beyond the Boundaries: Interdisciplinary Approaches to Software Testing" and was held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada
* CAST 2009 had a theme of  "Serving Our Stakeholders" and was held in Colorado Springs, Colorado
* CAST 2010 had a theme of "Skills in Testing" and was held in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
* CAST 2011 had a theme of "Context-Driven Testing" and was held in Seattle, Washington.
* CAST 2012 had a theme of "The Thinking Tester" and was held in San Jose, California.
* CAST 2013 had a theme of "Lessons Learned" and was held in Madison, Wisconsin.
* CAST 2014 had a theme of "The Art and Science of Testing" and was held in New York City, New York.
* CAST 2015 had a theme of "Moving Testing Forward" and was held in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
* CAST 2016 had a theme of "Testing: Software Development Catalyst" and was held in Vancouver, Canada
* CAST 2017 had a theme of "What the heck do testers really do?" and was held in Nashville, Tennessee, USA

== Training ==
The AST offers a series of online training courses in black box software testing (BBST), based on videos from Florida Institute of Technology's Center for Software Testing Education &amp; Research (CSTER) with additional study aids and support from live instructors. 

The initial set of courses enhances materials developed under a series of grants from the National Science Foundation. These materials are used in traditional university courses and in courses for practitioners, such as those offered by AST. The AST courses run 4 weeks each and focus on a single topic or test technique. AST is planning new courses by additional instructors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12837">'''Avionics software''' is [[embedded system|embedded software]] with legally mandated [[avionics safety|safety]] and [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] concerns used in [[avionics]].  The main difference between avionic software and conventional embedded software is that the [[software development model|development process]] is ''required by law'' and is ''optimized for safety.''
It is claimed that the [[Software development process|process]] described below is only slightly slower and more costly (perhaps 15 percent) than the normal ''ad hoc'' processes used for commercial [[Computer software|software]]. Since most software fails because of mistakes, eliminating the mistakes at the earliest possible step is also a relatively inexpensive, and reliable way to produce software. In some projects however, mistakes in the specifications may not be detected until deployment.  At that point, they can be very expensive to fix.

The basic idea of any software development model is that each step of the design process has outputs called "deliverables." {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}  If the deliverables are tested for correctness and fixed, then normal human mistakes can not easily grow into dangerous or expensive problems.  Most manufacturers{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} follow the [[waterfall model]] to coordinate the design product, but almost all explicitly permit earlier work to be revised.  The result is more often closer to a [[spiral model]].

For an overview of embedded software see [[embedded system]] and [[software development model]]s.  The rest of this article assumes familiarity with that information, and discusses differences between commercial embedded systems and commercial development models.

==General overview==
Since most avionics manufacturers see software as a way to add value without adding weight, the importance of embedded software in avionic systems is increasing.

Most modern commercial aircraft with auto-pilots use flight computers and so called flight management systems(FMS) that can fly the aircraft without the pilot's active intervention during certain phases of flight. Also under development or in production are unmanned vehicles: missiles and drones which can take off, cruise and land without airborne pilot intervention.

In many of these systems, failure is unacceptable. The reliability of the software running in airborne vehicles (civil or military) is shown by the fact that most air borne accidents occur due to manual errors.  Unfortunately reliable software is not necessarily easy to use or intuitive, poor user interface design has been a contributing cause of many aerospace accidents and deaths.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Regulatory issues==
Due to safety requirements, most nations regulate avionics, or at least adopt standards in use by a group of allies or a customs union.  The three regulatory organizations that most affect international aviation development are the U.S, the E.U. and Russia.

In the [[United States|U.S.]], avionic and other aircraft components have safety and reliability standards mandated by the Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 25 for Transport Airplanes, Part 23 for Small Airplanes, and Parts 27 and 29 for Rotorcraft.  These standards are enforced by "designated engineering representatives" of the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] who are usually paid by a manufacturer and certified by the FAA.

In the [[European Union]] the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] describes "recommended" requirements for safety-critical systems, which are usually adopted without change by governments.  A safe, reliable piece of avionics has a "CE Mark."  The regulatory arrangement is remarkably similar to fire safety in the U.S. and Canada.  The government certifies testing laboratories, and the laboratories certify both manufactured items and organizations.  Essentially, the oversight of the engineering is outsourced from the government and manufacturer to the testing laboratory.

To assure safety and reliability, national regulatory authorities (e.g. the [[FAA]], [[Civil Aeronautics Administration (United States)|CAA]], or [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]]) require software development standards.  Some representative standards include [[MIL-STD-2167]] for military systems, or RTCA [[DO-178B]] and its successor [[DO-178C]] for civil aircraft.

The regulatory requirements for this software can be expensive compared to other software, but they are usually the minimum that is required to produce the necessary safety.

==Development process==
The main difference between avionics software and other [[embedded system]]s is that the actual standards are often far more detailed and rigorous than commercial standards, usually described by documents with hundreds of pages. It is usually runs on a real time operating system.

Since the process is legally required, most processes have documents or software to trace requirements from numbered paragraphs in the specifications and designs to exact pieces of code, with exact tests for each, and a box on the final certification checklist.  This is specifically to prove conformance to the legally mandated standard.

Deviations from a specific project to the processes described here can occur due to usage of alternative methods or low safety level requirements.

Almost all software development standards describe how to perform and improve specifications, designs, coding, and testing (See [[software development model]]). However avionics software development standards add some steps to the development for safety and certification:

===Human interfaces===
Projects with substantial human interfaces are usually prototyped or simulated. The videotape is usually retained, but the prototype retired immediately after testing, because otherwise senior management and customers can believe the system is complete.  A major goal is to find human-interface issues that can affect safety and usability.

===Hazard analysis===
Safety-critical avionics usually have a [[hazard analysis]].  The early stages of the project, already have at least a vague idea of the main parts of the project.  An engineer then takes each block of a block diagram and considers the things that could go wrong with that block, and how they affect the system as a whole.  Subsequently, the severity and probability of the hazards are estimated.  The problems then become requirements that feed into the design's specifications.

Projects involving military cryptographic security usually include a security analysis, using methods very like the hazard analysis.

===Maintenance manual===
As soon as the engineering specification is complete, writing the maintenance manual can start.  A maintenance manual is essential to repairs, and of course, if the system can't be fixed, it will not be safe.

There are several levels to most standards.  A low-safety product such as an in-flight entertainment unit (a flying TV) may escape with a schematic and procedures for installation and adjustment.  A navigation system, autopilot or engine may have thousands of pages of procedures, inspections and rigging instructions.  Documents are now (2003) routinely delivered on CD-ROM, in standard formats that include text and pictures.

One of the odder documentation requirements is that most commercial contracts require an assurance that system documentation will be available indefinitely.  The normal commercial method of providing this assurance is to form and fund a small foundation or trust.  The trust then maintains a mailbox and deposits copies (usually in [[ultrafiche]]) in a secure location, such as rented space in a university's library (managed as a special collection), or (more rarely now) buried in a cave or a desert location.&lt;ref&gt;Personal Information, Robert Yablonsky, Engineering manager, B.E. Aerospace, Irvine, CA, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design and specification documents===
These are usually much like those in other [[software development model]]s.  A crucial difference is that requirements are usually traced as described above.  In large projects, requirements-traceability is such a large expensive task that it requires large, expensive computer programs to manage it.

===Code production and review===
The code is written, then usually reviewed by a programmer (or group of programmers, usually independently) that did not write it originally (another legal requirement). Special organizations also usually conduct code reviews with a checklist of possible mistakes. When a new type of mistake is found it is added to the checklist, and fixed throughout the code.

The code is also often examined by special programs that analyze correctness ([[Static code analysis]]), such as SPARK examiner for the [[SPARK programming language|SPARK]] (a subset of the Ada programming language) or [[Lint programming tool|lint]] for the C-family of programming languages (primarily C, though).
The [[compiler]]s or special checking programs like "lint" check to see if types of data are compatible with the operations on them, also such tools are regularly used to enforce strict usage of valid programming language subsets and programming styles.
Another set of programs measure [[software metric]]s, to look for parts of the code that are likely to have mistakes.
All the problems are fixed, or at least understood and double-checked.

Some code, such as [[digital filter]]s, [[graphical user interface]]s and [[inertial navigation system]]s, are so well understood that software tools have been developed to write the software.  In these cases, specifications are developed and reliable software is produced automatically.

===Unit testing===
"Unit test" code is written to exercise every instruction of the code at least once to get 100% [[code coverage]].  A "coverage" tool is often used to verify that every instruction is executed, and then the test coverage is documented as well, for legal reasons.

This test is among the most powerful.  It forces detailed review of the program logic, and detects most coding, compiler and some design errors.  Some organizations write the unit tests ''before'' writing the code, using the software design as a module specification.  The unit test code is executed, and all the problems are fixed.

===Integration testing===
As pieces of code become available, they are added to a skeleton of code, and tested in place to make sure each interface works.  Usually the built-in-tests of the electronics should be finished first, to begin burn-in and radio emissions tests of the electronics.

Next, the most valuable features of the software are integrated.  It is very convenient for the integrators to have a way to run small selected pieces of code, perhaps from a simple menu system.

Some program managers try to arrange this integration process so that after some minimal level of function is achieved, the system becomes deliverable at any following date, with increasing numbers of features as time passes.

===Black box and acceptance testing===
Meanwhile, the test engineers usually begin assembling a test rig, and releasing preliminary tests for use by the software engineers.  At some point, the tests cover all of the functions of the engineering specification.  At this point, testing of the entire avionic unit begins.  The object of the acceptance testing is to prove that the unit is safe and reliable in operation.

The first test of the software, and one of the most difficult to meet in a tight schedule, is a realistic test of the unit's radio emissions.  This usually must be started early in the project to assure that there is time to make any necessary changes to the design of the electronics.
The software is also subjected to a structural coverage analysis, where test's are run and code coverage is collected and analysed.

===Certification===
Each step produces a deliverable, either a document, code, or a test report.  When the software passes all of its tests (or enough to be sold safely), these are bound into a certification report, that can literally have thousands of pages.  The designated engineering representative, who has been striving for completion, then decides if the result is acceptable.  If it is, he signs it, and the avionic software is certified.

'''William H.''' ('''Bill''') '''Inmon''' (born 1945) is an American [[computer scientist]], recognized by many as the father of the [[data warehouse]].&lt;ref&gt;Jill Dyché (2000). ''e-Data: turning data into information with data warehousing''. Addison-Wesley. p.323.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Factor (2001). ''Analyzing Application Service Providers''. Prentice Hall PTR. p.290.&lt;/ref&gt; Inmon wrote the first book, held the first conference (with [[Arnie Barnett]]), wrote the first column in a magazine and was the first to offer classes in [[data warehousing]]. Inmon created the accepted definition of what a data warehouse is - a subject oriented, nonvolatile, integrated, time variant collection of data in support of management's decisions. Compared with the approach of the other pioneering architect of data warehousing, [[Ralph Kimball]], Inmon's approach is often characterized as a top-down approach.

== Biography ==
William H. Inmon was born July 20, 1945 in [[San Diego, California]]. He received his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[mathematics]] from [[Yale University]], and his [[Master of Science]] degree in [[computer science]] from [[New Mexico State University]].

He worked for [[American Management Systems]] and [[Coopers &amp; Lybrand]] before 1991, when he founded the company Prism Solutions, which he took public. In 1995 he founded Pine Cone Systems, which was renamed Ambeo later on. In 1999, he created a corporate information factory web site for his consulting business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inmoncif.com/about/ About Bill : William H. Inmon, "The Father of Data Warehousing"]. Inmon Consulting Services 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Inmon coined terms such as the government information factory, as well as data warehousing 2.0.  Inmon promotes building, usage, and maintenance of data warehouses and related topics. His books include "Building the Data Warehouse" (1992, with later editions) and "DW 2.0: The Architecture for the Next Generation of Data Warehousing" (2008).

In July 2007, Inmon was named by [[Computerworld]] as one of the ten people that most influenced the first 40 years of the computer industry.&lt;ref&gt;Computer World Magazine's July 2007 issue.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inmon's association with data warehousing stems from the fact that he wrote the first{{cn|date=December 2015}} book on data warehousing he held the first conference on data warehousing (with Arnie Barnett), he wrote the first column in a magazine on data warehousing, he has written over 1,000 articles on data warehousing in journals and newsletters, he created the first fold out wall chart for data warehousing and he conducted the first classes on data warehousing. 

In 2012, Inmon developed and made public technology known as "textual disambiguation". Textual disambiguation applies context to raw text and reformats the raw text and context into a standard data base format. Once raw text is passed through textual disambiguation, it can easily and efficiently be accessed and analyzed by standard business intelligence technology. Textual disambiguation is accomplished through the execution of textual ETL.

In 2017, KDNuggets, a leading Data Science platform, published his article on "Hearing the Voices of your Customer". He was also interviewed in "Data Podcast" by Rajib Bahar, &amp; Shabnam Khan about his latest work and how Big Data fits in the world of Data-warehousing.

'''Billingham Bags''' (M Billingham &amp; Co Ltd) is a British brand of professional bags and vests for carrying cameras, lenses, laptops and photography accessories. The company's headquarters are in [[Cradley Heath]], England.&lt;ref name="Professional Photographer"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anker|first1=Kathrine|title=Cool Britannia: Billingham Bags|url=http://www.kathrineanker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Cool-Britannia-Billingham-Bags-Marchsmallpdf.com_.pdf|accessdate=1 August 2016|work=Professional Photographer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History == 

Billingham Bags (M Billingham &amp; Co Ltd) was founded in 1973 by Martin Billingham,&lt;ref name=Pedlars&gt;{{cite web|title=An Interview with Harry Billingham|url=http://www.pedlars.co.uk/pedlarsworld/stories/an-interview-with-harry-billingham/|work=Pedlars|date=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is still owned and run by the Billingham family. Originally a manufacturer of fishing bags, in 1978 Billingham discovered that a large number of their bags were being sold to a [[photographer]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=Pedlars/&gt;&lt;ref name="Digital Trends"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Montgomery|first1=Kelly|title=Billingham Classic 550 Camera Bag defies time, elements|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/home/billingham-classic-550-camera-bag-defies-time-elements/|website=Digital Trends|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a year production had switched almost entirely to specialist camera bags. Billingham Bags have worldwide distribution and are still hand made in [[Cradley Heath]], [[England]]. Billingham bags are notable for their process of bonding the fabric of the bag to [[butyl rubber]] for [[waterproofing|water resistance]]. Billingham have had partnerships with well known camera manufacturers [[Leica_Camera|Leica]] and [[Hasselblad]], making custom camera bags for both companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web||title=Billingham Combination Bag For The Leica M Review|url=http://findingrange.com/2011/10/03/billingham-combination-bag-for-the-leica-m-review/|work=Finding Range|date=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web||title=Billingham produces exclusive bag for the Hasselblad X1D|url=https://www.ephotozine.com/article/hasselblad-x1d---medium-format-mirrorless-camera-announced-29505|work=ePhotoZine|date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also had a number of collaborations with British fashion and design house Pedlars.&lt;ref name=Pedlars/&gt; The company celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web||title=Billingham marks 40 years of history|url=http://www.dpreview.com/articles/4340088218/billingham-marks-40-years-of-histor|work=DPReview|date=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bitmessage''' is a [[Decentralization|decentralized]], [[encryption|encrypted]], [[peer-to-peer]], trustless communications protocol that can be used by one person to send encrypted messages to another person, or to multiple subscribers. Bitmessage encrypts each user's message inbox using [[public-key cryptography]] and replicates it inside its [[Anonymous P2P|P2P]] [[Mix network|network, mixing]] it with inboxes of other users in order to conceal user's identity, prevent eavesdropping and allow the network to operate in a decentralized manner. The Bitmessage [[communications protocol]] avoids sender-spoofing through [[authentication]], and hides [[metadata]] from wiretapping systems.{{Citation needed|date = January 2015}}

In June 2013, the software experienced a surge of new adoptions after news reports of email surveillance by the US [[National Security Agency]].&lt;ref name="busweek"/&gt;

{{As of|June 2014}}, the network processes several thousand private messages per day.{{Citation needed|date = January 2015}}

==Operation==
Bitmessage works by encrypting all the incoming and outgoing messages using [[public-key cryptography]] so that only the receiver of the message is capable of decrypting it. In order to achieve anonymity:

* Bitmessage replicates all the messages inside its own [[anonymous P2P]] network, therefore mixing all the encrypted messages of a given user with all the encrypted messages of all other users of the network, thus making it difficult to track which particular computer is the actual originator of the message and which computer is the recipient of the message.
* Bitmessage uses  cryptographically generated addresses (for example, ''BM-BcbRqcFFSQUUmXFKsPJgVQPSiFA3Xash'').&lt;ref name="timebroadcast"&gt;{{cite web|date=July 15, 2013|url=https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Timeservice_Broadcast|title=Bitmessage Timeservice Broadcast|accessdate=2013-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bitmessage addresses resemble [[bitcoin]] addresses, and its keys are compatible with bitcoin keys.
* Bitmessage uses [[public-key cryptography]], designed such that only a recipient of a message is capable of decrypting it. This encryption algorithm works in such a way that even the original sender is not able to decrypt their own message due to different keys being used for encryption and decryption. More specifically, Bitmessage uses 256-bit [[Elliptic curve cryptography|ECC]] keys and [[OpenSSL]] for cryptographic functions. 
* Outgoing messages do not contain the explicit address of the recipient of the message. Therefore, every network participant attempts decryption of every message passing through the network even if the message was not originally intended for that network participant. Since only the actual recipient can successfully decrypt the messages intended for them, all network participants know that if they fail to decrypt the message then the message was not intended for them.
* The original sender knows whether the recipient received the message or not (through an acknowledgement system), but the sender cannot discover which network participant is the actual recipient since all the network participants will have this encrypted message stored on their computer irrespective of whether the message was intended for them or not.
* Bitmessage [[Node (networking)|nodes]] store the encrypted messages only for two days before erasing them, therefore, messages are not archived in the network. New nodes joining the network can only download and broadcast the pool's messages from the last two days. Any messages which did not result in a receipt acknowledgement can be re-sent by the originator of the message after the two-day period.
* Bitmessage uses a [[proof-of-work system]] to protect the network from [[Denial-of-service attack|flooding]].

Bitmessage can be accessed via [[Tor (network)|Tor]] or via [[I2P]]&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite news|title=BMG FAQ|url=https://bitmessage.ch/faq.html|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chans===
Starting from version 0.3.5, Bitmessage introduced an additional feature called a ''chan'', a decentralized anonymous mailing list. Unlike traditional [[Electronic mailing list|mailing lists]] used via [[email]]:
* a chan cannot be shut down by taking down any server or a group of servers due to decentralized nature of chans.

==Development==
The concept for Bitmessage was conceived by software developer Jonathan Warren, who based its design on the decentralized [[digital currency]], [[bitcoin]]. The software was released in November 2012 under the [[MIT License|MIT license]].&lt;ref name="busweek"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bitmessage's NSA-Proof E-Mail|author=Max Raskin| newspaper=Business Week |date=2013-06-27 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-06-27/bitmessages-nsa-proof-e-mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The source code is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and uses the [[Qt (software)|Qt]] cross-platform [[application framework]] as well as [[OpenSSL]] for cryptographic functions. It is available for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], and [[Linux]].

==Public reception==
Bitmessage has gained a reputation for being out of reach of warrantless wiretapping conducted by the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) due to the decentralized nature of the protocol, and its encryption being difficult to crack. As a result, downloads of the Bitmessage program increased fivefold during June 2013 after news broke of classified email surveillance activities conducted by the NSA.&lt;ref name="busweek"/&gt;

Bitmessage has also been mentioned as an experimental alternative to email by ''[[Popular Science]]''&lt;ref name="popsci"&gt;{{cite news|title=What Are Your Options Now For Secure Email?|author=Dan Nosowitz| newspaper=Popular Science|date=2013-08-09|url=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-08/what-are-your-options-secure-email}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[CNET]].&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gmail: You weren't really expecting privacy, were you?|author=Molly Wood|newspaper=CNet|date=2013-08-13|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31322_3-57598424-256/gmail-you-werent-really-expecting-privacy-were-you}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cinema Products Corporation''' was an American manufacturer of motion picture camera equipment.

==History==
The company was formed in 1968 by Ed DiGiulio, a former director and vice-president of the [[Mitchell Camera Corporation]].  Their first product was a Silent Pellicle Reflex conversion of the Mitchell BNC 35&amp;nbsp;mm Motion picture camera.

The company expanded into the 16-millimeter news camera market with the introduction of the [[CP-16]].
[[File:Curtis Choy with a CP-15 16mm camera.jpg|thumb| Documentary director Curtis Choy films with a CP-16.]] The CP16 was based on the film advance mechanism used in the older "[[Auricon 16mm Sound on Film|Bach-Auricon]]" sound-on-film cameras, but reconfigured in a lighter, more ergonomic self-blimped body configuration. It became one of the most widely used sound-on-film cameras in the TV news industry until it began to be superseded by the color professional video formats of the late 1970s.  (3/4&amp;nbsp;inch field decks and the early Betacam and M-format component analog tape systems.)

==Academy Award==
In the [[50th Academy Awards]], [[Garrett Brown]] and the Cinema Products Corporation Engineering Staff under the supervision of John Jurgens received a Scientific or Technical Award, Class I for the invention and development of the [[Steadicam]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_O12cKayx0 50th Academy Awards Ceremony excerpt&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
===XR35===
In motion picture equipment, the Mitchell BNC conversion to reflex was followed by the studio quiet XR35. The Cinema Products XR35 had a Mitchell NC camera inside a lightweight housing or blimp. The blimp was so close in size to the original camera, it looked small compared to the blimps made for Mitchell or Arriflex cameras. The XR35 was a crystal-controlled 35mm motion picture camera considerably lighter than the Hollywood studio–owned blimped Mitchells. The X stood for crystal, the R for reflex. The reflex system was based on a spinning mirror shutter. During the mirrors' revolution at one point the film would be exposed, then the operator would view the image in the mirror as the film was advanced to the next frame, at 24 times a second. Cinema Products did their best to buy up all available 35mm Mitchell NC cameras on the market as the XR went into production. Later, Cinema Products sold their remaining Mitchell inventory to a Japanese company {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} when the XR35 was challenged by competitors but still selling well.

In 1972 Panavision and Arriflex came to market with their lighter-weight 35mm cameras. Panavision's Panaflex and the German Arriflex 35BL-I. These cameras were not blimped in the sense they had a camera in a housing; these cameras were designed from the ground up to be quiet. 

The light and ergonomic Arri 35BL-I gave European film makers (and eventually the American "Brats"), the ability to shoot studio-quality  (double system) sync sound movies, but faster, on real locations – and even handheld – and with smaller crews and support equipment. (Due to the limited resources of the 1940s and 1950s  the Italian Neo realists and French New Wave had evolved around the approach of shooting wild synch or "Noisy-synch" and then completely post-replacing all sound and dialog.)  In America, The Panaflex became the industry standard motion picture camera, displacing the Mitchell legacy.
 
===GSMO===
The studio quiet 16mm Cinema Products GSMO was introduced in the mid-1970s. It had quick loading coaxial magazines, an 'in camera' light meter viewable in the eyepiece and an on-camera battery. The GSMO stood for "gun sight man operated". (Cinema Products would often develop products under government contracts, then adapt them for industry wide marketing.)

The GSMO was popular among documentarians and low-budget independent producers.  [[Jon Jost]] produced feature films shot with the GSMO.  The PBS documentary film [[Post No Bills (1992 film)|Post No Bills]] was also shot by [[Clay Walker (filmmaker)|Clay Walker]] using Jost's GSMO camera.

The GSMO had crystal speeds of 12, 16, 24, 25, 32, 48, 64 FPS. Besides the standard 400-foot magazine, the GSMO offered a novel and rare 100-foot magazine. The 100-foot mag was the height of the camera, so the camera with mag would be only 5&amp;nbsp;inches tall. The GSMO did not have video assist, a way of viewing what the cameraman was seeing on a video screen. TV commercial producers and directors wanted video assist, and the GSMO fell behind the competition in that feature. (After-market video assist is now available for the GSMO).

===Rare lens===
During pre-production for the 1975 film "[[Barry Lyndon]]", director-producer [[Stanley Kubrick]] had a requirement for a large aperture "high speed" cine lens to facilitate shooting scenes by candlelight. At the time, the largest aperture "fastest" cine lenses available for reflex 35mm cine cameras had a f1.4 aperture. High Speed (also called "Super Speed") f1.2 prime lenses were not available at the time.

Kubrick sourced a [[Carl Zeiss]] Planar f0.7/50mm lens, an aperture two f-stops larger than f1.4. This was a still camera lens originally developed by Carl Zeiss for NASA's [[Apollo]] program. Ed DiGulio reluctantly agreed to take on the very difficult process of adapting this lens to a cine camera, which required modifying the lens and permanently modifying a Mitchell BNC camera to work with this lens. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/ac/len/page1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Director of photography John Alcott was honored at the [[48th Academy Awards]] with the Best Cinematography award for his work on Barry Lyndon. One of the modified Mitchell BNC cameras, and two of the modified f0.7 lenses are on display with the Stanley Kubrick Exhibition.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanleykubrick.de/eng.php?img=img-l-1&amp;kubrick=sichten-eng |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320015546/http://www.stanleykubrick.de/eng.php?img=img-l-1&amp;kubrick=sichten-eng |archivedate=2011-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CP35===
In the early 1980s, Cinema Products introduced the CP35, a nonquiet 35mm camera. With a BNCR lens mount, it was to partner with the studio quiet XR35 that had the same BNCR mount. The CP35 had video assist, but it was not as integrally designed as the competition's. The CP35 had multiple crystal speeds like the GSMO ranging from 6 to 120FPS.

===FX35===
The FX35 was introduced in 1987. It had a wider body but resembled the CP35. They shared magazines. The FX35 had integral video assist. It used the PL lens mount Arriflex had introduced. The camera's electronics were cutting edge for the day with special effects and motion control underlining the electronics design. From the switch-mode power supply to the 36-pin computer interface, the FX35 offered features unavailable on cameras at that time. The speeds were thumb-wheel selected in .01 increments. A CRT computer monitor with 72.06 hertz could be filmed with no roll bar, the black bar visible when a 24 or 25 FPS camera records a TV or computer monitor due to the difference in refresh rates. The FX35 was originally designed for a motion picture and video camera rental company in Great Britain. The production rights and remaining inventory of the CP35 and FX35 were sold to Redicam in 1992.

In its last years, Cinema Products was still innovative. A film to HD video transfer machine was introduced, novel in that the HD camera was not part of the transfer machine but mounted on it. An upgrade would be easy, just change the HD camera, the film transport deck stayed the same. A fiber optic–based 35&amp;nbsp;mm ground glass to video chip reducer was patented and sold to a competitor. A consumer-oriented Steadicam unit designed for small mini DV cameras was added to the Steadicam line. The Steadicam Jr. incorporated an 8-layer non-glare LCD video monitor comparable to the professional Steadicam rigs. The Steadicam line became the company's leading marketable product. [[Tiffen]] Filter bought the rights to make the [[Steadicam]] when Cinema Products Corporation went out of business in 2000.

'''Coalbed methane''' ('''CBM''' or '''coal-bed methane'''),&lt;ref name="bg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bg-group.com/Careers/graduates/howtoapply/Pages/JargonBuster.aspx|title=Jargon Buster|publisher=BG Group|accessdate=18 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''coalbed gas''', '''coal seam gas''' ('''CSG'''&lt;ref name="bg"/&gt;), or '''coal-mine methane''' ('''CMM''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarke-energy.com/gas-type/coal-gas/working-mine-methane/|title=Coal Mine Methane|publisher=Clark Energy|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of [[natural gas]] extracted from [[coal]] beds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarke-energy.com/gas-type/coal-gas/ Coal Gas], www.clarke-energy.com, retrieved 25.11.2011&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades it has become an important source of energy in United States, Canada, Australia, and other countries.

The term refers to [[methane]] [[adsorption|adsorbed]] into the solid matrix of the coal. It is called 'sweet gas' because of its lack of [[hydrogen sulfide]]. The presence of this gas is well known from [[Firedamp|its occurrence]] in underground coal mining, where it presents a serious safety risk. Coalbed methane is distinct from a typical [[sandstone]] or other conventional gas reservoir, as the methane is stored within the coal by a process called [[adsorption]]. The methane is in a near-liquid state, lining the inside of pores within the coal (called the matrix). The open fractures in the coal (called the cleats) can also contain free gas or can be saturated with water.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Unlike much natural gas from conventional reservoirs, coalbed methane contains very little heavier hydrocarbons such as [[propane]] or [[butane]], and no [[natural-gas condensate]]. It often contains up to a few percent [[carbon dioxide]].

==History==
Coalbed methane grew out of venting methane from coal seams. Some coal beds have long been known to be "gassy," and as a safety measure, boreholes were drilled into the seams from the surface, and the methane allowed to vent before mining.

Coalbed methane as a natural-gas resource received a major push from the US federal government in the late 1970s. Federal price controls were discouraging natural gas drilling by keeping natural gas prices below market levels; at the same time, the government wanted to encourage more gas production. The US Department of Energy funded research into a number of unconventional gas sources, including coalbed methane. Coalbed methane was exempted from federal price controls, and was also given a federal tax credit.

In Australia, commercial extraction of coal seam gas began in 1996 in the [[Bowen Basin]] of [[Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoscience Australia, [http://www.ga.gov.au/energy/petroleum-resources/coal-seam-gas.html Coal seam gas], accessed 10 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reservoir properties==
Gas contained in coal bed methane is mainly methane and trace quantities of [[ethane]], [[nitrogen]], [[carbon dioxide]] and few other gases. Intrinsic properties of coal as found in nature determine the amount of gas that can be recovered.

===Porosity===
Coalbed methane reservoirs are considered as a dual-porosity reservoirs. Dual porosity reservoirs are reservoirs in which porosity related to cleats (natural fractures) are responsible for flow behavior and reservoir porosity of the matrix is responsible for the storage of gas. The [[porosity]] of a coalbed methane reservoir can vary from 10%-20 %; However, the cleat porosity of the reservoir is estimated to be in the range of 0.1%-1 % &lt;ref&gt;C.R. Clarkson, Production data analysis of unconventional gas wells: Review of theory and best practices, International Journal of Coal Geology, Volume 109, 2013, Pages 101-146, ISSN 0166-5162, https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coal.2013.01.002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adsorption capacity===
Adsorption capacity of coal is defined as the volume of gas adsorbed per unit mass of coal usually expressed in SCF (''standard cubic feet'', the volume at standard pressure and temperature conditions) gas/ton of coal. The capacity to adsorb depends on the rank and quality of coal. The range is usually between 100 and 800 SCF/ton for most coal seams found in the US. Most of the gas in coal beds is in the adsorbed form. When the reservoir is put into production, water in the fracture spaces is pumped off first. This leads to a reduction of pressure enhancing desorption of gas from the matrix.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Fracture permeability===
As discussed before, the fracture permeability acts as the major channel for the gas to flow. The higher the permeability, the higher the gas production. For most coal seams found in the US, the permeability lies in the range of 0.1–50 milliDarcys. The permeability of fractured reservoirs changes with the stress applied to them. Coal displays a stress-sensitive permeability and this process plays an important role during stimulation and production operations&lt;ref&gt;McKee, C. R., Bumb, A. C., &amp; Koenig, R. A. (1988, March 1). Stress-Dependent Permeability and Porosity of Coal and Other Geologic Formations. Society of Petroleum Engineers. doi:10.2118/12858-PA&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;S. Saurabh, S. Harpalani, V.K. Singh, Implications of stress re-distribution and rock failure with continued gas depletion in coalbed methane reservoirs, International Journal of Coal Geology, Volume 162, 2016, Pages 183-192, ISSN 0166-5162, https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coal.2016.06.006.&lt;/ref&gt; Fracture permeability in Coalbed methane reservoir tends to increase with depletion of gas; in contrast to conventional reservoirs. This unique behavior is because of shrinking of coal, when methane is released from its matrix, which results in opening up of fractures and increased permeability.&lt;ref&gt;Sevket Durucan, Mustafa Ahsanb, Ji-Quan Shia, Matrix shrinkage and swelling characteristics of European coals, Energy Procedia, Volume 1, Issue 1, 2009, Pages 3055-3062, ISSN 1876-6102, https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2009.02.084.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed that due to shrinkage of coal matrix at lower reservoir pressures, there is a loss of horizontal stress in the reservoir which induces in-situ failure of coal. Such a failure has been attributed to sudden decrease in the fracture permeability of the reservoir&lt;ref&gt;Okotie, V. U., &amp; Moore, R. L. (2011, May 1). Well-Production Challenges and Solutions in a Mature, Very-Low-Pressure Coalbed-Methane Reservoir. Society of Petroleum Engineers. doi:10.2118/137317-PA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt;

===Thickness of formation and initial reservoir pressure===
The thickness of the formation may not be directly proportional to the volume of gas produced in some areas.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

For example, it has been observed in the [[Geology of Kansas#Subsurface geology|Cherokee Basin]] in Southeast Kansas that a well with a single zone of {{convert|1|to|2|ft|m|1}} of pay can produce excellent gas rates, whereas an alternative formation with twice the thickness can produce next to nothing. Some coal (and shale) formations may have high gas concentrations regardless of the formation's thickness, probably due to other factors of the area's geology.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The pressure difference between the well block and the sand face should be as high as possible as is the case with any producing reservoir in general.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Other properties===
Other affecting parameters include coal density, initial gas-phase concentration, critical gas saturation, irreducible water saturation, relative permeability to water and gas at conditions of Sw = 1.0 and Sg = 1-Swirreducible respectively.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Extraction==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
[[File:CBM Well.png|thumb|Diagram of a coalbed methane well (US DOE)]]
[[File:CBM Production Curve.png|thumb|Typical production profile of a coalbed methane well (USGS)]]

{{Main|Coal bed methane extraction}}

To extract the gas, a steel-encased hole is drilled into the coal seam {{convert|100|to|1500|m|ft}} below ground. As the pressure within the coal seam declines due to natural production or the pumping of water from the coalbed, both gas and ''produced water'' come to the surface through tubing. Then the gas is sent to a compressor station and into natural gas pipelines. The produced water is either reinjected into isolated formations, released into streams, used for irrigation, or sent to evaporation ponds. The water typically contains dissolved solids such as [[sodium bicarbonate]] and [[chloride]] but varies depending on the formation geology.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Coalbed methane wells often produce at lower gas rates than conventional reservoirs, typically peaking at near {{convert|300000|cuft|m3}} per day (about 0.100 m³/s), and can have large initial costs. The production profiles of CBM wells are typically characterized by a "[[negative decline]]" in which the gas production rate initially increases as the water is pumped off and gas begins to desorb and flow. A dry CBM well is similar to a standard gas well.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The methane desorption process follows a curve (of gas content vs. reservoir pressure) called a [[Adsorption#Langmuir|Langmuir isotherm]]. The isotherm can be analytically described by a maximum gas content (at infinite pressure), and the pressure at which half that gas exists within the coal. These parameters (called the Langmuir volume and Langmuir pressure, respectively) are properties of the coal, and vary widely. A coal in [[Alabama]] and a coal in [[Colorado]] may have radically different Langmuir parameters, despite otherwise similar coal properties.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

As production occurs from a coal reservoir, the changes in pressure are believed to cause changes in the porosity and permeability of the coal. This is commonly known as matrix shrinkage/swelling. As the gas is desorbed, the pressure exerted by the gas inside the pores decreases, causing them to shrink in size and restricting gas flow through the coal. As the pores shrink, the overall matrix shrinks as well, which may eventually increase the space the gas can travel through (the cleats), increasing gas flow.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The potential of a particular coalbed as a CBM source depends on the following criteria. Cleat density/intensity: cleats are joints confined within coal sheets. They impart permeability to the coal seam. A high cleat density is required for profitable exploitation of CBM. Also important is the maceral composition: [[maceral]] is a microscopic, homogeneous, petrographic entity of a corresponding sedimentary rock. A high vitrinite composition is ideal for CBM extraction, while inertinite hampers the same.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The rank of coal has also been linked to CBM content: a vitrinite reflectance of 0.8–1.5% has been found to imply higher productivity of the coalbed.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The gas composition must be considered, because natural gas appliances are designed for gas with a heating value of about 1,000 BTU ([[British thermal unit]]s) per cubic foot, or nearly pure methane. If the gas contains more than a few percent non-flammable gases such as [[nitrogen]] or [[carbon dioxide]], either these will have to be removed or it will have to be blended with higher-BTU gas to achieve ''pipeline quality''. If the methane composition of the coalbed gas is less than 92%, it may not be commercially marketable.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Environmental impacts==

===Methane===
As with all carbon based fossil fuels, burning coalbed methane releases carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) into the atmosphere. Its effect as greenhouse gas was firstly analyzed by chemist and physicist [[Svante Arrhenius]]. CBM production also entails leaks of fugitive methane into the atmosphere. Methane is rated as having 72 times the effect on global warming per unit of mass than CO&lt;sub&gt;2.&lt;/sub&gt; over 20 years, reducing to 25 times over 100 years and 7.5 times over 500 years.&lt;ref name="TableOfWarmingPotentials"&gt;[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] Fourth Assessment Report, [http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter2.pdf Table 2.14, Chap.&amp;nbsp;2, p.&amp;nbsp;212]&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of [[life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of energy sources]] indicates that generating electricity from CBM, as with conventional natural gas, has less than half the greenhouse gas effect of coal.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy J. Skone, [http://www.marcellus.psu.edu/resources/PDFs/NETLlifecycle.pdf Life-cycle analysis], 12 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, methane escaping from coal during mining amounts to 10 percent of total [[methane emissions]]. Recovery of coal mine methane in advance of mining is seen as a major opportunity to reduce methane emissions. {{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Infrastructure===
CBM wells are connected by a network of roads, pipelines, and compressor stations. Over time, wells may be spaced more closely in order to extract the remaining methane.

===Produced water===
The [[produced water]] brought to the surface as a byproduct of gas extraction varies greatly in quality from area to area, but may contain undesirable concentrations of dissolved substances such as [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]], naturally present chemicals, [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]] and [[radionuclide]]s.&lt;ref name=ABC-CSGbyNumbers&gt;{{cite web

====Powder River Basin====
Not all coalbed methane produced water is saline or otherwise undesirable. Water from coalbed methane wells in the [[Powder River Basin]] of Wyoming, US, commonly meets federal drinking water standards, and is widely used in the area to water livestock.&lt;ref&gt;US EPA, [Evaluation of Impacts to Underground Sources of Drinking Water by Hydraulic Fracturing of Coalbed Methane Reservoirs, The Powder River Basin], June 2004, EPA 816-R-04-003 Attachment 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Its use for irrigation is limited by its relatively high [[sodium adsorption ratio]].

===Groundwater===
Depending on aquifer connectivity, water withdrawal may depress aquifers over a large area and affect groundwater flows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://waterquality.montana.edu/docs/methane/cbmfaq.shtml Montana State University; Frequently Asked Questions; Coal Bed Methane (CBM)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224103534/http://waterquality.montana.edu/docs/methane/cbmfaq.shtml |date=24 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the CBM industry estimates extraction of {{convert|126000|e6L|USgal|abbr=off}} to {{convert|280000|e6L|USgal|abbr=off}} of groundwater per year; while the [[National Water Commission]] estimates extraction above {{convert|300000|e6L|USgal|abbr=off}} a year.&lt;ref name=ABC-CSGbyNumbers /&gt;

==Coalbed methane producing areas==

===Australia===
{{see also|Coal in Australia}}
Coal Seam Gas resources are in the major coal basins in Queensland and New South Wales, with further potential resources in South Australia. Commercial recovery of coal seam gas (CSG) began in Australia in 1996. As of 2014, coal seam gas, from Queensland and New South Wales, made up about ten percent of Australia's gas production. Demonstrated reserves were estimated to be 33 trillion cubic feet (35 905 petajoules) as of January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Geoscience Australia, Australian Energy Resource Assessment, 2014. http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/energy/resources/australian-energy-resource-assessment&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Bowen Basin]]
* [[Surat Basin]]
* [[Sydney Basin]]

===Canada===
In Canada, [[British Columbia]] is estimated to have approximately {{convert|90|e12cuft|abbr=off}} of coalbed gas. [[Alberta]], in 2013, was the only province with commercial coalbed methane wells and is estimated to have approximately {{convert|170|e12cuft|abbr=off}} of economically recoverable coalbed methane, with overall reserves totaling up to {{convert|500|e12cuft|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;John Squarek and Mike Dawson, ''Coalbed methane expands in Canada'', Oil &amp; Gas Journal, 24 July 2006, p.37-40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.albertacanada.com/business/industries/og-natural-gas-and-coal-bed-methane.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Coalbed methane is considered a [[non-renewable resource]], although the [[Alberta Research Council]], [[Alberta Geological Survey]] and others have argued coalbed methane is a [[renewable resource]] because the bacterial action that formed the methane is ongoing.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} This is subject to debate since it has also been shown that the dewatering that accompanies CBM production destroys the conditions needed for the bacteria to produce methane&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2004/11/renewable_natur.html |title=Renewable Natural Gas? The Discovery of Active Methane Biogenesis in Coalbeds |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=16 November 2004 |accessdate=2011-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rate of formation of additional methane is undetermined.  This debate is currently causing a [[right of ownership]] issue in the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Alberta]], as only non-renewable resources can legally be owned by the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mytelus.com/ncp_news/article.en.do?pn=tech&amp;articleID=2970245 |title=TELUS, news, headlines, stories, breaking, canada, canadian, national |publisher=Mytelus.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin]]

===United Kingdom===
Although gas in place in Britain's coal fields has been estimated to be 2,900 billion cubic meters, it may be that as little as one percent might be economically recoverable. Britain's CBM potential is largely untested. Some methane is extracted by coal mine venting operations, and burned to generate electricity. Assessment by private industry of coalbed methane wells independent of mining began in 2008, when 55 onshore exploration licences were issued, covering 7,000 square kilometers of potential coalbed methane areas. [[IGas Energy]] became the first in the UK to commercially extract coalbed methane separate from mine venting; as of 2012, the Igas coalbed methane wells at Doe Green, extracting gas for electrical generation, were the only commercial CBM wells in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;DECC, [https://www.og.decc.gov.uk/UKpromote/onshore_paper/Promote_UK_CBM.pdf The Unconventional Hydrocarbon  Resources of Britain's Onshore Basins - Coalbed Methane] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511105757/https://www.og.decc.gov.uk/UKpromote/onshore_paper/Promote_UK_CBM.pdf |date=11 May 2015 }}, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|Coalbed methane in the United States}}

United States coalbed methane production in 2011 was 1.76 trillion cubic feet (TCF), 7.3 percent of all US dry gas production that year.  The 2011 production was down from the peak of 1.97 TCF in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_prod_coalbed_s1_a.htm Coalbed methane production], accessed 9 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Most CBM production came from the Rocky Mountain states of Colorado, Wyoming, and New Mexico.

===Kazakhstan===
Kazakhstan could witness the development of a large coalbed methane (CBM) sector over the coming decades, according to industry professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coal bed methane in Kazakhstan|url=http://www.worldcoal.com/news/cbm/articles/Developing-the-coalbed-methane-industry-in-Kazakhstan-CBM83.aspx|date=July 23, 2014|publisher=worldcoal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary research suggests there may be as much as 900 billion m3 of gas in Kazakhstan’s main coalfields – 85% of all reserves in Kazakhstan.

===India===
With the completion of the drilling of 23 vertical production wells by [[Great Eastern Energy]] (GEECL), coalbed methane would be available in India for commercial sale purpose from 14 July 2007 priced at ₹ 30 per kg for CNG. Initially 90% of the CBM would be distributed among vehicles as CNG gas.
GEECL is also setting up the first CBM station in Southeast Asia and the same will be located in India in the city of Asansol in West Bengal. GEECL is the first company whose first field development plan has been approved.Essar is also producing and investing in CBM.

Prashant Modi, President and Chief Operating Officer of GEECL, said, "We are proud to be India’s first private sector company that has ventured into Coal Bed Methane exploration, production, marketing and distribution. With the nation requiring higher energy sources to sustain its development pace, we are confident that CBM will play an important role as one of the prime energy source for the future generations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.methanetomarketsindia.com/news/GEECL.pdf|title=Coal Bed Methane in India|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Conversion marketing example.svg|thumb|A seller wants to optimize the conversion rate from "saw the advertisement" to "clicked the advertisement", as well as the conversion rate from "clicked the advertisement" to "bought the product".]]
In [[internet marketing]], '''conversion optimization''', or '''conversion rate optimization (CRO)''' is a system for increasing the percentage of visitors to a website that [[conversion (marketing)|convert]] into customers,&lt;ref&gt;Kahled, Saleh and Shukairy, Ayat (2011). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=USIKL4celYcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Conversion Optimization: The Art and Science of Converting Prospects into Customers]'', p. 2. O'Reilly Media, Sebastopol. {{ISBN|978-1-449-37756-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or more generally, take any desired action on a webpage.&lt;ref&gt;Ash, Tim and Page, Rich and Ginty, Maura (2012). ''Landing Page Optimization'', p. 13. Wiley &amp; Sons, Indianapolis. {{ISBN|9780470610121}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly referred to as CRO.

== History ==
Online conversion rate optimization (or website optimization) was born out of the need of e-commerce marketers to improve their website's performance in the aftermath of the [[dot-com bubble]]. As competition grew on the web during the early 2000s, website analysis tools and an awareness of website usability prompted internet marketers to produce measurables for their tactics and improve their website's [[user experience]]. 

In 2004, new tools enabled internet marketers to experiment with [[Web design|website design]] and content variations to determine which layouts, copy text, offers, and images perform best. This form of optimization accelerated in 2007 with the introduction of the free [[Google Website Optimizer]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Page, Rich (2012). ''Website Optimization: An Hour a Day'', Wiley &amp; Sons, Indianapolis. {{ISBN|978-1-118-19651-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Today optimization and conversion are key aspects of many digital marketing campaigns. A research study conducted among internet marketers in 2014, for example, showed that 59% of respondents thought that CRO was "crucial to their overall digital marketing strategy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Conversion Rate Optimization Report 2014 |url=https://econsultancy.com/reports/conversion-rate-optimization-report/ |location=London |publisher=Econsultancy |date=2014 |access-date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversion rate optimization shares many principles with [[Direct marketing#Direct response marketing|direct response marketing]] – a marketing approach that emphasizes tracking, testing, and on-going improvement. [[Direct marketing]] was popularized in the early twentieth century and supported by the formation of industry groups such as the Direct Marketing Association, which formed in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmaresponsibility.org/aboutdma/index.shtml|title=About the Direct Marketing Association|author=dma|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like modern day conversion rate optimization, direct response marketers also practice A/B split-testing, response tracking, and audience testing to optimize mail, radio, and print campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0cBfQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=tested+advertising&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5ZtnVZr4FdD68QXR-YKYAg&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAg|title=Tested Advertising Methods|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistical significance==
Frequently, when marketers study a lift in an [[Advertising campaign|ad campaign]], they discover customer behavior is not consistent. [[Online marketing]] [[response rate (survey)|response rates]] fluctuate widely from hour to hour, segment to segment, and offer to offer &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dvir|first=Nim|last2=Gagni|first2=Ruti|date=2018|title=When Less Is More: Empirical Study of the Relation Between Consumer Behavior and Information Provision on Commercial Landing Pages|url=https://doi.org/10.28945/4015|journal=Informing Science: The International Journal of an Emerging Transdiscipline|language=en|volume=21|pages=019–039|doi=10.28945/4015|issn=1547-9684|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

This phenomenon can be traced to the difficulty humans have separating chance events from real effects.  Using the haystack process, at any given time, marketers are limited to examining and drawing conclusions from small data samples. However, psychologists (led by [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]]) have documented tendencies to find spurious patterns in small samples to explain why poor decisions are made. Statistical methodologies can be leveraged to study large samples, mitigating the urge to see patterns where none exist.

These methodologies, or "conversion optimization" methods, are then taken a step further to run in a real-time environment.{{cn|date=February 2016}} The [[real-time data]] collection and subsequent messaging increases the scale and effectiveness of the online campaign.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

Reaching a statistically significant result in itself is not enough. Conversion optimization practitioners must ensure that their sample size accounts for important variables. For example, a test may appear statistically significant well before seasonal factors (time of day, day of week, time of year) have been adequately reflected in the data sample. One variation may appeal to one season more than others and ultimately misguide the result.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

It is equally important to understand how various segments affect tests and results. Different user segments (e.g. device type, location, new vs. returning visitor) will respond differently to each variation.{{cn|date=February 2016}}. Analyzing results without accounting for different segments can cause a significant improvement for one segment; or many variations can offset poor results for another segment. For example, uplift in desktop conversion-rate could offset a decreased conversion-rate on mobile devices. In this instance, only the desktop version should be declared a ‘winning’ test.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

== Methodology ==
Conversion rate optimization seeks to increase the percentage of website visitors that take a specific action (often submitting a web form, making a purchase, signing up for a trial, etc.) by methodically testing alternate versions of a page or process.{{cn|date=February 2016}} In doing so, businesses are able to generate more leads or sales without investing more money on website traffic, hence increasing their marketing return on investment and overall profitability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=2N1DwBhcMTkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=conversion-rate+optimization&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NJ9nVdHXBIiF8gX8nIDoAQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=conversion-rate%20optimization&amp;f=false|title=You Should Test That|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A conversion rate is defined as the percentage of visitors who complete a goal, as set by the site owner. Some test methods, such as split testing or [[A/B testing]], enable one to monitor which headlines, copy, images, social proof elements,{{cn|date=February 2016}} and content help convert visitors into customers.

There are several approaches to conversion optimization with two main schools of thought prevailing in the last few years.{{cn|date=February 2016}} One school is more focused on testing to discover the best way to increase website, campaign, or [[landing page]] conversion rates. The other school is focused on the pretesting stage of the optimization process.{{cn|date=February 2016}} In this second approach, the optimization company will invest a considerable amount of time understanding the audience and then creating a targeted message that appeals to that particular audience. Only then would it be willing to deploy testing mechanisms to increase conversion rates.

==Elements of the test focused approach==
Conversion optimization platforms for content, campaigns, and delivery consist of the following elements:

===Data collection and processing===
The platform must process hundreds of variables and automatically discover which [[subset]]s have the greatest [[predictive power]], including any [[multivariate testing in marketing|multivariate]] relationship.  A combination of pre- and post-screening methods is employed, dropping irrelevant or redundant data as appropriate.  A flexible [[data warehouse]] environment accepts customer data as well as data aggregated by third parties.

This means it's essential to ensure the data is as 'clean' as possible, before undertaking any data analysis. For example, eliminating activity from bots, staging websites, or incorrect configurations of tools such as Google Analytics.

Data can be [[numeric data|numeric]] or [[text-based]], [[nominal data|nominal]] or [[ordinal data|ordinal]].  Bad or missing values are handled gracefully.

Data may be geographic, contextual, frequential, demographic, behavioral, customer based, etc.

===Hypothesis===
After data collection, forming a hypothesis is the next step. This process forms the foundation of why changes are made. Hypotheses are made based on observation and deduction. It is important that each hypothetical situation be measurable. Without these no conclusions can be derived.

===Optimization goals===
The official definition of "optimization" is the discipline of applying advanced analytical methods to make better decisions.  Under this framework, business goals are explicitly defined and then decisions are calibrated to optimize those goals.  The methodologies  have a long record of success in a wide variety of industries, such as airline scheduling, [[supply chain management]], financial planning, [[military logistics]] and telecommunications routing.  Goals should include maximization of conversions, revenues, profits, [[Loan-to-value ratio|LTV]] or any combination thereof.

===Business rules===
Arbitrary business rules must be handled under one optimization framework. Using such a platform entails that one should understand these and other business rules, then adapt targeting rules accordingly.

===Real-time decision making===
Once [[mathematical model]]s have been built, ad/content servers use an [[audience screen]] method to place visitors into segments and select the best offers, in real time.  Business goals are optimized while business rules are enforced simultaneously.  Mathematical models can be refreshed at any time to reflect changes in business goals or rules.

===Statistical learning===
Ensuring results are repeatable by employing a wide array of statistical methodologies.  Variable selection, validation testing, simulation, [[Scientific control|control groups]] and other techniques together help to distinguish true effects from chance events.  A champion/challenger framework ensures that the best mathematical models are deployed always.  In addition, performance is enhanced by the ability to analyze huge datasets and to retain historical learning.

'''Dicing tape''' is a backing tape used during [[wafer dicing]], the cutting apart of pieces of [[semiconductor]] material following [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]] [[microfabrication]]. The tape holds the pieces of semiconductor, known as dice, together during the cutting process, mounting them to a thin metal frame. The dice are removed from the dicing tape later on in the [[electronics]] manufacturing process.

Dicing tape can be made of [[PVC]], [[polyolefin]], or [[polyethylene]] backing material with an adhesive to hold the dice in place. In some cases dicing tape will have a release liner that will be removed prior to mounting the tape to the backside of the wafer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lintec-usa.com/di_t.cfm#anc01"Products Dicing Tape." ''LINTEC of AMERICA'' Accessed 11 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It is available in a variety of thicknesses, from 75 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.semicorp.com/products/item/standard-dicing-tape "Standard Dicing Tape." ''Semiconductor Equipment Corp.'' Accessed 23 July 2010, l;ink updated 9/27/2016&lt;/ref&gt; to 150 micrometers, with a variety of adhesive strengths, designed for various chip sizes and materials. UV tapes are dicing tapes in which the adhesive bond is broken by exposure to UV light after dicing, allowing the adhesive to be stronger during cutting while still allowing clean and easy removal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semiconductortapes.com/products/difference2.html "UV Tape vs Non-UV Tape." ''Semiconductor Tapes and Materials.'' Accessed 23 July 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; UV equipment can range from low power (a few mW/cm2) to high power (more than 200&amp;nbsp;mW/cm2). Higher power results in a more complete cure, lower adhesion and reduced adhesive residue. .&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lintec-usa.com/di_uv.cfm

'''Dimefox''' was an [[organophosphate]] [[pesticide]]. In its pure form it is a colourless  liquid with a fishy odour.&lt;ref name=IAI&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sitem.herts.ac.uk/aeru/iupac/236.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-04-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722134430/http://sitem.herts.ac.uk/aeru/iupac/236.htm |archive-date=2011-07-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dimefox was first produced in 1940 by the group of [[Gerhard Schrader]] in Germany. It was historically used as a pesticide, but has been deemed obsolete or discontinued for use by the [[World Health Organization]]. However, they do not guarantee that all commercial use of this compound ceased. But in most countries it is no longer registered for use as a pesticide.&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;the WHO recommended classification of pesticides by hazard and guidelines to classification 2009, http://www.who.int/ipcs/publications/pesticides_hazard_2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered an [[List of extremely hazardous substances|extremely hazardous substance]] as defined by the United States [[Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act]].

'''Esko''', formerly called ''EskoArtwork'', is a [[graphic arts]] company producing [[prepress]] [[Computer software|software]] and [[computer hardware|hardware]]  for the packaging and labels, sign and display and publishing industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.i-grafix.com/contributed/andrew-tribute/a-business-model-for-the-future/ |title=A business model for the future - Print News &amp;#124; Packaging News &amp;#124; Wide Format news &amp;#124; Print &amp;#124; i-grafix &amp;#124; Australia, New Zealand and Asia |website=I-grafix.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Esko was the result of a [[merger]] between ''[[Barco (manufacturer)|Barco]] Graphics'' and ''[[Purup-Eskofot A/S]]'' in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barco.com/en/News/Press-releases/barco-graphics-and-purup-eskofot-to-merge.aspx |title=Graphics and Purup-Eskofot to merge |website=Barco.com |date=2001-09-07 |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The merged company was called Esko-Graphics but was renamed Esko in 2006. In the fall of 2005, Esko became fully owned by [[Axcel A/S]], a [[Denmark|Danish]] private [[equity investment]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.axcel.dk/content/dk/presse/2005/esko-graphics_continues_packaging_growth_strategy |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409145158/http://www.axcel.dk/content/dk/presse/2005/esko-graphics_continues_packaging_growth_strategy |archivedate=2010-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007 Esko announced that it was 'joining forces' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.packagedesignmag.com/content/esko-and-artwork-systems-join-forces-consolidate-packaging-strengths |title=Esko and Artwork Systems to Join Forces to Consolidate Packaging Strengths &amp;#124; Package Design |website=Packagedesignmag.com |date=2009-10-19 |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Artwork Systems Group NV (AWS), its chief competitor in the packaging prepress market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.i-grafix.com/contributed/andrew-tribute/package-deal/ |title=Package deal - Print News &amp;#124; Packaging News &amp;#124; Wide Format news &amp;#124; Print &amp;#124; i-grafix &amp;#124; Australia, New Zealand and Asia |website=I-grafix.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Esko initially bought 76.69% of AWS shares for €196 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labelandnarrowweb.com/contents/view_breaking-news/2007-08-02/esko-acquires-artwork-systems/ |title=Esko Acquires Artwork Systems |publisher=Label and Narrow Web |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enfocus, a brand of [[PDF]] pre-flighting and workflow software originally acquired by Artwork Systems in 2000, became a subsidiary of the combined EskoArtwork company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetpdf.com/mainpage.asp?webpageid=736 |title=Classic PitStop developer Enfocus Software acquired by Artwork Systems |website=Planetpdf.com |date=2016-04-11 |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting the merger, Esko changed its name to EskoArtwork. It also introduced a new logo, though it is visually very close to the Esko original.

In January 2011, 100% of EskoArtwork shares have been transferred to [[Danaher Corporation|Danaher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Will Daley |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-20/danaher-agrees-to-buy-belgian-software-maker-eskoartwork-for-470-million.html |title=Danaher to Acquire EskoArtwork for 350 Million Euros |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2011-01-20 |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, the name changed back to Esko, the logo was also updated. Esko acquired CAPE Systems&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flexography.org/industry-news/esko-buys-cape-systems/&lt;/ref&gt; (a palletization software vendor) in 2013, MediaBeacon&lt;ref&gt;http://whattheythink.com/news/72839-esko-acquire-mediabeacon/&lt;/ref&gt; (a [[Digital Asset Management]] vendor) in 2015 and Blue Software, LLC&lt;ref&gt;https://graphicartsmag.com/news/2018/07/esko-acquires-blue-software/&lt;/ref&gt; (a label and artwork management software vendor) in 2018.

Esko is headquartered in [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]].

Femtech was coined by [[Ida Tin]], a [[Danish people|Danish]] entrepreneur who founded Clue, a period- and fertility-tracking app.&lt;ref name="VBRise"&gt;{{cite news | last=Magistretti| first=Bérénice| title =The rise of femtech: women, technology, and Trump | publisher =[[VentureBeat]]| date =5 February 2017 | url =https://venturebeat.com/2017/02/05/the-rise-of-femtech-women-technology-and-trump/| accessdate =12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MashWhy"&gt;{{cite news | last=Hinchliffe| first=Emma| title =Why 2016 was a huge year for women's health tech | publisher =[[Mashable]]| date =29 December 2016 | url =http://mashable.com/2016/12/29/femtech-2016-womens-health/#0Vku79whCsqa| accessdate =12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an industry, femtech largely encompasses any [[Digital health|digital]] or standard health tools aimed at women's health, including [[Wearable technology|wearables]], internet-connected medical devices, mobile apps, hygiene products, and others.&lt;ref name="VBRise"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SVBJ"&gt;{{cite news | last=Parker| first=Leia| title =Will the "femtech" revolution really offer a "digital contraceptive" and detect diseases through a phone? | newspaper =[[Silicon Valley Business Journal]]| date =13 September 2016 | url =http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2016/09/13/will-the-femtech-revolution-really-offer-a-digital.html| accessdate =12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a digital women's health category is relatively new.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VBRise"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MashWhy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dive"&gt;{{cite news | last=Caspi| first=Heather| title =Rise of 'femtech' promises health solutions for women  | publisher =Healthcare Dive| date =15 September 2016 | url =http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/rise-of-femtech-promises-health-solutions-for-women/426341/| accessdate =12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mobi02"&gt;{{cite news | last=Mack| first=Heather| title =Digital health tools for women a growing, necessary and wanted market | publisher =MobiHealthNews| date =16 September 2016 | url =http://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/digital-health-tools-women-growing-necessary-and-wanted-market| accessdate =12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Femtech startups raised around $82 million in funding from investment firms.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dive"/&gt; In March 2017, the total amount of funding raised by femtech companies since 2014 had reached $1.1 billion.&lt;ref name="Blatt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VBRise"/&gt; In March 2018, Frost &amp; Sullivan released new data, predicting a market potential of $50 billion by 2025 &lt;ref&gt;https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/08/frost-sullivan-femtech-could-become-a-50-billion-market-by-2025/&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates suggest that around $200 billion is being spent on femtech products each year.&lt;ref name="MashWhy"/&gt;

==Companies and products==

There are numerous femtech companies offering a variety of different products throughout the world. Companies that produce period- and/or fertility-tracking mobile apps include, [[Clue (mobile app)|Clue]], Glow, &lt;ref name="TechonomyGlow"&gt;{{cite news | last=Burke| first=Adrienne Jane| title =When the Quantified Self Wants to Conceive a Child | publisher =[[Techonomy Media]]| date =17 October 2013 | url = http://techonomy.com/2013/10/when-the-quantified-self-wants-to-conceive-a-child/| accessdate =6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eve, Cycles, My Calendar, Life,&lt;ref name="VBRise"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TC"&gt;{{cite news | last=Buhr| first=Sarah| title =Period tracking app Clue pulls in $20 million Series B from Nokia Growth Partners | publisher =[[TechCrunch]]| date =30 November 2016 | url =https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/30/period-tracking-app-clue-pulls-in-20-million-series-b-from-nokia-growth-partners/| accessdate =12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; FertilityIQ, Extend Fertility, Forte Medical and others.&lt;ref name="MashWhy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mobi02"/&gt; Companies that offer services like [[IVF]], [[egg freezing]], and medical treatments include Univfy, &lt;ref name="Techonomy"&gt;{{cite news | last=Burke| first=Adrienne Jane| title =Startup’s Data Helps Women Succeed with In Vitro Fertilization | publisher =[[Techonomy Media]]| date =4 March 2013 | url = http://techonomy.com/2013/03/startups-data-helps-women-succeed-with-in-vitro-fertilization/| accessdate =6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Progyny and Prelude Fertility.&lt;ref name="MashWhy"/&gt; Similarly, the fertility company, Ava, produces a wearable that tracks fertility.&lt;ref name="MashAva"&gt;{{cite news | last=Hinchliffe| first=Emma| title =The next frontier in wearables is helping couples conceive | publisher =[[Mashable]]| date =19 November 2016 | url =http://mashable.com/2016/11/19/ava-fertility-wearable-series-a/#Tpf0T9Cbqmqm| accessdate =12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Nurx provides a telemedicine service where women can get birth control prescribed via an app, and have the pills delivered.&lt;ref name="MashWhy"/&gt;

Several companies also produce [[Internet of things|internet-connected]] medical devices that are often paired with mobile apps to track specific data. For instance, Naya Health produces a connected [[breast pump]]&lt;ref name="VBRise"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mobi02"/&gt; while Elvie offers a [[Kegel exercise|kegel]] tracking device.&lt;ref name="VBElvie"&gt;{{cite news | last=Magistretti| first=Bérénice| title =Femtech startup Elvie raises $6 million for its kegel tracker | publisher =[[VentureBeat]]| date =22 March 2017 | url =https://venturebeat.com/2017/03/22/femtech-startup-elvie-raises-6-million-for-its-kegel-tracker/| accessdate =12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lioness produces a smart [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]].&lt;ref name="Blatt"/&gt; Other medical devices and implements produced in the femtech category may or may not use an internet connection. Joylux, Inc. is a global women’s health technology company creating innovative medical and feminine wellness devices under the vSculpt and vFit brands.Willow Pump produces a hands-free breast pump that works automatically.&lt;ref name="Blatt"/&gt; Companies like L. and Flex offer alternatives to standard [[tampon]] and [[condom]] products.&lt;ref name="VBRise"/&gt; Thinx sells reusable [[underwear]] that absorbs menstrual blood.&lt;ref name="Blatt"/&gt;

As its name suggests, it is the '''first oil well''' in the Arabian side of the [[Persian Gulf]] and is located in [[Bahrain]]. The [[Oil well|well]] is situated below [[Mountain of Smoke|Jebel Dukhan]]. It was discovered and operated by [[Bahrain Petroleum Company|Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO)]], established in 1929 in [[Canada]] by [[Standard Oil Company of California]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bBvz_YxlB-AC&amp;pg=PA71|title=Historical dictionary of the petroleum industry|last=Vassiliou|first=Marius|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]|year=2009|isbn=9780810859937|series=Historical dictionaries of professions and industries|volume=3|location=|pages=71–72|author-link=Marius Vassiliou}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNKfJ-cEXiMC&amp;pg=PA146|title=Foreign Direct Investment in Bahrain|author=Lobna Ali Al-Khalifa|publisher=[[Universal-Publishers]]|year=2010|isbn=9781599423210|location=|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Petroleum|Oil]] first spurted from this well on 16 October 1931, and the well finally began to blow heads of oil on the morning of 2 June 1932. The initial oil flow rate was {{convert|9600|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}; by the 1970s the well produced {{convert|70000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}, and after that it stabilized at about {{convert|35000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Bahrain was the first place on the Arabian side of the [[Persian Gulf]] where oil was discovered, and it coincided with the collapse of the world [[pearl]] market.

{{for|the television series|Ghost Mine (TV series)}}

A '''ghost mine''' is a [[pyrotechnic]] device which projects a large, ethereal-looking colored fireball into the sky. The effect is produced by mixing [[methyl alcohol]] with a [[pyrotechnic colorant]]. Since alcohol burns with a nearly invisible flame, all that is seen by the audience is a cloud of glowing color (the colorant) taking the shape of the invisible fireball.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skylighter.com/specialOffer.asp?offer=2ES07BR1BM How to make fireball ghost mines], Skylighter inc, 2007 (accessed 22 January 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; It was invented by Chris Spurrell, a research chemist from Hawthorne, California.

'''Gottlieb Wilhelm Daimler''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡɔtliːp ˈdaɪmlɐ|lang}}; 17 March 1834 – 6 March 1900)&lt;ref&gt;[http://global.britannica.com/biography/Gottlieb-Daimler "Gottlieb Daimler"]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[engineer]], [[industrial design]]er and [[industrialist]] born in [[Schorndorf]] ([[Kingdom of Württemberg]], a federal state of the [[German Confederation]]), in what is now Germany. He was a pioneer of [[internal-combustion engine]]s and [[automobile]] development. He invented the high-speed liquid petroleum fueled engine.

Daimler and his lifelong business partner [[Wilhelm Maybach]] were two inventors whose goal was to create small, high-speed engines to be mounted in any kind of locomotion device. In 1883 they designed a horizontal cylinder layout compressed charge liquid petroleum engine that fulfilled Daimler's desire for a high speed engine which could be [[throttle]]d, making it useful in transportation applications. This engine was called Daimler's Dream.&lt;ref name=Haug /&gt;

In 1885 they designed a vertical cylinder version of this engine which they subsequently fitted to a two-wheeler, the first [[internal combustion]] [[motorcycle]] which was named the [[Reitwagen|Petroleum Reitwagen]] (Riding Car) and, in the next year, to a [[Coach (carriage)|coach]], and a boat. Daimler called this engine the grandfather clock engine (''Standuhr'') because of its resemblance to a large pendulum clock.

In 1890, they converted their partnership into a stock company [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft]] (DMG, in English—Daimler Motors Corporation). They sold their first automobile in 1892. Daimler fell ill and took a break from the business. Upon his return he experienced difficulty with the other stockholders that led to his resignation in 1893. This was reversed in 1894. Maybach resigned at the same time, and also returned. In 1900 Daimler died and Wilhelm Maybach quit DMG in 1907.

==Early life and education: 1834–1862==

[[File:Gottlieb-Daimler-Geburtshaus.jpg|thumb|200px|Daimler's birthplace in Schorndorf, now a small museum.]]

Gottlieb Wilhelm Daimler was the son of a baker named Johannes Däumler (Daimler) and his wife Frederika, from the town of [[Schorndorf]] near [[Stuttgart]], Württemberg. By the age of 13 (1847), he had completed six years of primary studies in [[Lateinschule]] and became interested in engineering.

After completing secondary school in 1848, Daimler had trained as a gunsmith under Master Gunsmith Hermann Raithel. In 1852 he ended the training with the trade examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mb-w124.de/blog/2010/02/16/gottlieb-wilhelm-daimler/ |title=1834: Gottlieb Wilhelm Daimler wird geboren |trans-title=1834: Gottlieb Wilhelm Daimler was born |date=16 February 2010 |accessdate=16 July 2016 |publisher=Car Design Schacht |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wise481&gt;{{cite book |author=Wise, David Burgess |year=1974 |title=Daimler: Founder of the Four-Wheeler |editor=Northey, Tom |work=World of Automobiles |location=London |publisher=Orbis |volume=5 |page=481}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1852, passing the craft test with a pair of [[Engraving|engraved]] double-[[gun barrel|barreled]] [[pistol]]s.&lt;ref name=Wise481 /&gt; The same year, at eighteen, Daimler decided to take up [[mechanical engineering]], abandoning gunsmithing,&lt;ref name=Wise481 /&gt; and left his hometown.

Signing up at Stuttgart's School for Advanced Training in the Industrial Arts, under the tutelage of [[:de:Ferdinand Von Steinbeis|Ferdinand von Steinbeis]]. Daimler was studious, even taking extra Sunday morning classes. In 1853, Daimler, with Steinbeis' assistance, got work at "the factory college", ''[[Elsässische Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Grafenstaden|Rollé und Schwilque]]'' (R&amp;S) in [[Grafenstaden]], so-called because its manager, Friedrich Messmer, had been an instructor at the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology|University of Karlsruhe]].&lt;ref name=Wise481 /&gt; Daimler performed well, and when Rollé und Schwilque began making railway [[locomotive]]s in 1856, Daimler, then 22, was named foreman.&lt;ref name=Wise481 /&gt;

Instead of staying, Daimler took two years at [[University of Stuttgart#History|Stuttgart's Polytechnic Institute]] to hone his skills, gaining in-depth grasp of steam locomotives, as well as "a profound conviction" steam was destined to be superseded.&lt;ref name=Wise481 /&gt; He conceived small, cheap, simple engines for light industrial use, possibly inspired by the newly developed gas engines of that era.&lt;ref name=Wise481 /&gt;

In 1861, he resigned from R&amp;S, visiting Paris, then went on to England, working with the country's top engineering firms, becoming knowledgeable with [[machine tools]]. He spent from autumn 1861 to summer 1863 in England, then regarded as "the motherland of technology",&lt;ref&gt;Press Kit: Mercedes-Benz in the UK. Stuttgart, 13 June 2007; Daimler Global Media&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Beyer, Peacock and Company]] of Gorton, Manchester. Beyer was from Saxony.&lt;ref&gt;Ehland, Christoph ed. (2007) ''Thinking Northern: Textures of Identity in the North of England''. Editions Rodopi, Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt; While in London, he visited the [[1862 International Exhibition]], where one of the exhibits was a [[Steam bus|steam carriage]].&lt;ref name=Wise481 /&gt; These carriages did not evidently inspire him, however, for his wish was to produce machine tools and woodworking machinery.&lt;ref name=Wise481 /&gt;

==Career through 1882==
Daimler went to work for Maschinenfabrik Daniel Straub,&lt;ref&gt;[[WMF Group|See WMF Group]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geislingen an der Steige]], where he designed tools, mills, and turbines. In 1863, he joined the ''Bruderhaus Reutlingen'', a [[Christian Socialist]] toolmaker, as inspector and later executive. While there, he met [[Wilhelm Maybach]], then a 15-year-old orphan.&lt;ref name=Wise481 /&gt;{{rp|482}} Thanks to Daimler's organizational skills, the factory managed to show a profit, but he quit in frustration in 1869, joining [[Maschinenbau Gesellschaft Karlsruhe]] in July.&lt;ref name=Wise481 /&gt;{{rp|482}}

When in 1872 N.A. Otto and Cie&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deutz.com/press/press_container/deutz_remembers_its_founder_na_otto.en.html |title=DEUTZ remembers its founder N.A.

==The Otto four-stroke engine (1876)==
In 1872 at age 38, Daimler and Maybach moved to work at the world's largest manufacturer of stationary engines at the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bnh9JXkXojEC&amp;pg=PA385 |chapter=Gottlieb Daimler: The Otto four-stroke engine |title=Cars: The Best Book on Cars Ever |editor-last=Brain |editor-first=Adriana |page=385 |publisher=Pedia Press |isbn= |year=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Deutz AG|Deutz-AG-Gasmotorenfabrik]] in [[Cologne]]. It was half-owned by [[Nikolaus Otto]], who was looking for a new technical director. As directors, both Daimler and Otto focused on gas-engine development while Maybach was chief designer.

In 1876, Otto developed a gaseous fuel, compressed charge [[four-stroke cycle]], (also known as the Otto Cycle) engine after 14 years of effort, a system characterized by four piston strokes (intake, compression, power, and exhaust). Otto intended that his invention would replace the steam engines predominant in those years, even though his engine was still primitive and inefficient.

Otto's engine was patented in 1877, but one of his 25 patents was soon challenged and overturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blotto.htm |title=Biography of Nicolaus Otto and the Modern Engine |publisher=Thought Co. |date=18 June 2018 |last=Bellis |first=Mary |accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daimler who wanted to make his own engine, feared Otto's patent would prevent it. Daimler hired an attorney who found that a "previous art" patent for a four stroke engine had been issued in Paris in 1862 to [[Alphonse Beau de Rochas|Beau De Rochas]], a French public works engineer.

Meanwhile, serious personal differences arose between Daimler and Otto, reportedly with Otto being jealous of Daimler, because of his university background and knowledge. Daimler wanted to build small engines that could be applied to transportation but Otto had no interest in this. When Otto excluded Daimler from his engine patents there was great animosity between the two. Daimler was fired in 1880, receiving 112,000 [[German gold mark|Gold marks]] in Deutz-AG shares in compensation for the patents of both Daimler and Maybach. Maybach resigned later and followed Daimler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://real-economics.blogspot.com/2015/06/cool-spring-power-musuem-june-2015.html |title=Cool Spring Power Museum, June 2015: The first internal combustion engines |last=Wikrent |first=Tony |work=Real Economics |date=27 June 2015 |accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independent inventor of small, high speed engines, 1882==
&lt;!-- this text is covered twice in this article, now all is together. Needs rewrite for one consistent section on Gottlieb's move to invent and design on his own, at age 48, using the strongest references --&gt;

[[File:Stuttgart-cannstatt-daimler-gewaechshaus.jpg|thumb|Daimler's summer house (Cannstatt)]]
[[File:Wilhelm-maybach-1900.jpg|thumb|Wilhelm Maybach ca 1900]]
At [[Bad Cannstatt|Cannstatt]], Daimler and the more creative thinking Maybach&lt;ref name=Wise481 /&gt;{{rp|482}} devised their engine. At Daimler's insistence, it eliminated "the clumsy, complicated slide-valve ignition",&lt;ref name=Wise481 /&gt;{{rp|483}} in favor of a hot tube system invented by an Englishman named Watson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emercedesbenz.com/autos/mercedes-benz/classic/mercedes-benz-history-the-route-to-the-riding-car/attachment/mercedes-benz-history-451858_759091_3592_2422_647106c38343a/ |title=Mercedes-Benz History: The Route to the Riding Car |accessdate=16 July 2016 |author=Clark, John |date=10 August 2010 |publisher=Mercedes Benz}}&lt;/ref&gt; since electrical systems functioned too slowly.&lt;ref name=Wise481 /&gt;{{rp|483}}

In the summer of 1882 Daimler moved to Cannstatt just outside of Stuttgart at that time, purchasing a cottage in Cannstatt's Taubenheimstrasse, with 75,000 Gold marks from the compensation from Deutz-AG. Maybach followed in September of that year. In the garden, they added a brick extension to the roomy glass-fronted summer house and this became their workshop. Their activities alarmed the neighbors who reported them to the police as suspected counterfeiters. The police obtained a key from the gardener and raided the house in their absence, but found only engines.&lt;ref name="Dreams to Automobiles"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Larson |first1=Len |title=Dreams to Automobiles |date=December 4, 2008 |publisher=Xlibris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zSCLAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT181&amp;lpg=PT181&amp;dq=1883+daimler+dream+engine&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ozZOxUz61V&amp;sig=9SZzmYPfopvX5JAQRjtRZB-TNlU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjv2dnQsN7NAhUMzIMKHavGB58Q6AEILDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=1883%20daimler%20dream%20engine&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name=Haug&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haug|first1=Gunter|title=Gottlieb Daimler - Der Traum vom Fahren: Historischer Roman|date=August 15, 2010|publisher=Masken-Verlag Friedrich Willmann;|isbn=3939500275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daimler and Maybach spent long hours debating how best to fuel Otto's four-stroke design, and turned to a commonly available [[petroleum]] fraction. The main distillates of petroleum at the time were lubricating oil, [[kerosene]] (burned as lamp fuel), and [[ligroin]] (Petroleum Naptha), which up to then was used mainly as a cleaner and was sold in pharmacies. "Leichtbenzin, wie es damals üblich und in der Apotheke zu bekommen war", blickt Oldtimer-Experte Michael Plag zurück. "Das ist ein verbrennungsfähiger Kraftstoff - Hexan N." [English]"Mineral spirits were common and easy to get at the pharmacy", recalls classic car expert Michael Plag. "This is a combustion-efficient fuel - hexane N."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/auto/jahre-daimler-reitwagen-hoelzerner-feuerstuhl-1.984679-10 |title=125 Jahre Daimler Reitwagen - Hölzerner Feuerstuhl |trans-title=125 years Daimler riding car - Wooden Bottom |journal=SZ Magazin Newsletter |date=6 August 2010 |accessdate=16 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Dream engine 1883==

In late 1883, Daimler and Maybach patented the first of their engines fueled by [[ligroin]]. This engine was patented on December 16, 1883. It achieved Daimler's goal of being small and running fast enough to be useful at 750 rpm.&lt;ref name="Dreams to Automobiles" /&gt; Improved designs in the next four years brought that up to 900 rpm.&lt;ref name="Dreams to Automobiles" /&gt; Daimler had three engines built to this design early in 1884, and a flywheel was included in one of the engines. This design was smaller and lighter than engines by other inventors of the time. Daimler relied on hot tube ignition, until 1897, when he adopted the electrical ignition designed by [[Robert Bosch|Bosch]].&lt;ref name="Dreams to Automobiles" /&gt;

==The 1885 Grandfather clock engine==

[[File:Daimler Standuhr engine 2 Mercedes-Benz Museum.jpg|thumb|The 1885 Grandfather Clock Engine]]
The engine with the flywheel included was built into a light vehicle, called the [[Reitwagen]], the first vehicle powered by an internal combustion engine.&lt;ref name="Dreams to Automobiles"/&gt;

It took considerable effort and experimentation, but eventually, the duo perfected a {{convert|.5|hp|kW PS|abbr=on|lk=on}} vertical single, which was fitted in the ''Reitwagen'', a purpose-built two-wheeler [[chassis]] with two spring-loaded [[Training wheels|stabilizers]]s.&lt;ref name=Wise481 /&gt;{{rp|483}}

* height of {{convert|76|cm|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="Georgano, p.13"/&gt;

In 1885, they created a [[carburetor]] which mixed [[gasoline]] with air allowing its use as fuel. In the same year Daimler and Maybach assembled a larger version of their engine, still relatively compact, but now with a vertical cylinder of 100&amp;nbsp;cc displacement and an output of 1 [[horsepower|hp]] at 600 rpm (patent DRP-28-022: "non-cooled, heat insulated engine with unregulated hot-tube ignition"). It was baptized the ''Standuhr'' ([[Longcase clock|"grandfather clock"]]), because Daimler thought it resembled an old pendulum clock.

In November 1885, Daimler installed a smaller version of this engine in a wooden two wheeler frame with two outrigger wheels, creating the first internal combustion motorcycle (Patent 36-423impff &amp; Sohn "Vehicle with gas or petroleum drive machine"). It was named the ''[[Daimler Reitwagen|Reitwagen]]'' (riding car). Maybach rode it for three kilometers (two miles) alongside the river [[Neckar]], from Cannstatt to [[Untertürkheim]], reaching {{convert|12|km/h|0}}.

==First automobile 1886==
Independently of each other, Karl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler each produced an automobile in 1886, both in Germany, about 60 miles apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.daimler.com/company/at-a-glance.html |title=Daimler at a Glance |year=2016 |publisher=Daimler AG |accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
About sixty miles away in Mannheim, Karl Benz built an [[automobile]] using an integral design for a motorized vehicle with one of his own engines. He was granted a [[patent]] for his ''motorwagen'' on 29 January 1886.

When this proved the engine capable of driving a vehicle, Daimler devised a {{convert|1.1|hp|kW PS|abbr=on|lk=on}} single and ordered a Wimpff und Soehne four-seater [[Phaeton (carriage)|phaeton]] to house it.&lt;ref name=Wise481 /&gt;{{rp|483}} Daimler's engine was installed by [[Maschinenfabrik Esslingen]] and drove the rear wheels through a dual-ratio [[belt drive]].&lt;ref name=Wise481 /&gt;{{rp|483}}

On 8 March 1886, Daimler and Maybach secretly brought an American Model coach made by Wilhelm Wimpff and Sohn into the house, telling the neighbors it was a birthday gift for Mrs. Daimler. Maybach supervised the installation of a larger 1.1&amp;nbsp;hp&lt;ref name="Georgano, p.13"/&gt; {{convert|462|cc|cuin|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="Georgano, p.13"/&gt; ({{convert|70|x|120|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=comma}})&lt;ref name="Georgano, p.13"/&gt; version of the Grandfather Clock engine into this stagecoach and it became the first four-wheeled vehicle to reach {{convert|16|km/h|0}}. The engine power was transmitted by a set of belts. As with the motorcycle, it was tested on the road to Untertürkheim where nowadays the [[Mercedes-Benz Arena (Stuttgart)|Mercedes-Benz Arena]], formerly called the Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion, is situated.

Driven by Daimler's desire to use the engine as many ways as possible,&lt;ref name="Georgano, p.13"/&gt; Daimler and Maybach used the engine in other types of transport including:
* on water (1886), by mounting it in a {{convert|4.5|m|abbr=on}} long boat and achieving a speed of {{convert|6|kn}}. The boat was called ''[[Neckar]]'' after the river where it was tested. (patent DRP 39-367). This was the first [[motorboat]] and boat engines soon would become Daimler's main product for several years. The first customers expressed fear the petrol engine could explode, so Daimler hid the engine with a ceramic cover and told them it was "oil-electrical".
* street-cars and trolleys.
* in the air in Daimler's balloon, usually regarded as the first airship, where it replaced a hand-operated engine designed by Dr. [[Friedrich Hermann Wölfert]] of [[Leipzig]]. With the new engine, Daimler successfully flew over Seelberg on 10 August 1888.

They sold their first foreign licenses for engines in 1887 and Maybach went as their representative to the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 Paris Exposition]] to show their achievements.

Engine sales increased, mostly for use in boats, and in June 1887, Daimler bought another property at Seelberg hill, Cannstatt. It was located some distance from the town on Ludwigstraße 67 because Cannstatt's mayor did not approve of the workshop. Built at a cost 30,200 goldmarks, the new premises had room for 23 employees. Daimler managed the commercial issues while Maybach ran the engine design department.

In 1889, Daimler and Maybach built the ''[[Daimler Stahlradwagen|Stahlradwagen]]'', their first automobile that did not involve adapting a horse-drawn carriage with their engine, but which was somewhat influenced by bicycle designs. There was no production in Germany, but it was licensed to be built in France and presented to the public in Paris in October 1889 by both engineers. The same year, Daimler's wife, Emma Kunz, died.

==Daimler Motors and the ''Phönix'' engine (1890 to 1900)==
[[File:DMG-lastwagen-cannstatt-1896.jpg|thumb|right|Model of a DMG Lastwagen, 1896, first gasoline [[truck]]]]
With demand for engines growing, for uses in everything from motorboats to railcars,&lt;ref name=Wise481 /&gt;{{rp|483}} Maybach and Daimler expanded. With funding from [[gunpowder]] maker [[Max Duttenhofer]], industrialist, and banker [[Kilian von Steiner]], and munitions manufactuer [[:de:Wilhelm Lorenz]], ''Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft'' was founded 28 November 1890, with Maybach as chief designer. Its purpose was the construction of small, high-speed engines for use on land, water, and air transport. The three uses were expressed by Daimler in a sketch that became the basis for a logo with a three-pointed star.

==Pact with the devil==
From 1882 until 1890 Daimler had resisted making his company into an incorporation or stock company.{{cn|date=July 2018}} He had seen what happened to too many engineers who had pioneered a capital invention as he had. Many of them were forced out of their own companies by stock holders who "knew better" about how to run the company that they had just purchased than the man who created it. This is a very common occurrence in the business world. It happened to Henry Ford, Ransom E. Olds, Karl Benz, August Horch (Audi), Gottlieb Daimler and many others.&lt;!--editorializing--&gt;

Many German historians consider this Daimler's "pact with the devil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Etscheit, Georg |url=http://zeus.zeit.de/text/2004/15/M-Daimler |title=Der Tόftler im Glashaus |publisher=Zeus.zeit.de |date= |accessdate=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daimler hated having to incorporate his company. Unable to obtain majority control, he sold out and then resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hendrickson III|first1=Kenneth E |title=Product Details |work=The Encyclopedia of the Industrial Revolution in World History: 3 Volumes |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=0810888874 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; DMG expanded, but it changed. The newcomers, not believing in automobile production, ordered the creation of additional stationary engine building capacity, and considered merging DMG with Otto's ''Deutz-AG''.

Daimler and Maybach preferred plans to produce automobiles and reacted against Duttenhofer and Lorenz. Maybach was denied a seat on the board and on 11 February 1891, he left the business. He continued his design work as a freelance in Cannstatt from his own house, with Daimler's support, moving to the closed Hermann Hotel in the autumn of 1892. He used its ballroom and winter garden as workshops, employing twelve workers and five apprentices.

The new company developed the high-speed inline-two ''Phönix'', for which Maybach invented a spray [[Carburetor|carburettor]].&lt;ref name=Wise481 /&gt;{{rp|483}} This was fitted in a singularly ugly car,&lt;ref name=Wise481 /&gt;{{rp|483}} which entered production in 1895 after a cessation of hostilities between Daimler, Maybach, and the DMG board.&lt;ref name=Wise481 /&gt;{{rp|483}}

==First automobile sold (1892)==
In 1892, DMG finally sold its first automobile. Gottlieb Daimler, aged 58, had heart problems and suffered a collapse in the winter of 1892–1893. His doctor prescribed a trip to [[Florence]], where he met Lina Hartmann, a widow 22 years his junior who was the owner of the hotel where he was staying. They married on 8 July 1893, honeymooning in [[Chicago]] during its World Fair.&lt;ref name=Hendrickson /&gt;

Returning from the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago with his new wife, Daimler had vowed to purchase enough shares of DMG to regain control. This effort failed. Daimler sold all his shares and patents and resigned from the Company. Maybach had left earlier.&lt;ref name=Hendrickson&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EdwsCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq=daimler+fired+from+dmg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SDkyo91Put&amp;sig=U5sxB6SJbIp9m8xQXxI_1xhHhac&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjw5o7mhNjNAhVMbj4KHTQ8BVYQ6AEIUTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=daimler%20fired%20from%20dmg&amp;f=false |title=Daimler, Gottlieb (1834-1900) |work=The Encyclopedia of the Industrial Revolution in World History |volume=3 |editor=Hendrickson III, Kenneth E. |page=236 |year=2014 |location=London |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-0810888883 |accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disputes with Lorenz continued. Daimler attempted to buy 102 extra shares to get a majority holding, but was forced out of his post as technical director. The corporation was 400,000 Gold marks in debt. The other directors threatened to declare bankruptcy if Daimler didn't sell them all his shares and all his personal patent rights from the previous thirty years. Daimler accepted the offer, receiving 66,666 Gold Marks, and resigned in 1893.

In 1894 at the Hermann Hotel, Maybach together with Daimler and his son Paul designed a third engine called the "Phoenix" and had DMG make it. It featured:
* four cylinders cast in one block arranged vertically and parallel
* camshaft operated exhaust valves
* a spray nozzle carburetor, patented by Maybach in 1893
* an improved belt drive system

This is probably the same internal-combustion engine referred to by the American author and historian [[Henry Brooks Adams]], who describes the "Daimler motor" and its great speed from his visit to the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 Paris Exposition]] in his autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, H. |title=The Education of Henry Adams |chapter=Ch XXV |year=1918 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2044/2044-h/2044-h.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daimler and Maybach continued to work together. They built a four-cylinder engine with Maybach' spray nozzle carburetor. It was in the first organized automobile race, the "Paris to Rouen" and defeated all the entries from DMG. [[Frederick Simms]], German-born long-time friend of Gottlieb Daimler insisted that Daimler be brought back into the company&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nndb.com/people/288/000174763/&lt;/ref&gt; making it a condition of his payment of  £17,500 for the transfer of his Daimler licenses to the British [[Daimler Company]] which would stabilize the corporation's finances, that Daimler, now aged sixty, should return to DMG.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Gottlieb Daimler received 200,000 goldmarks in shares, plus a 100,000&lt;!--marks or shares?--&gt; bonus. Simms received the right to use the name "Daimler" as his brand name for Daimler Company products.{{cn|date=July 2018}} In 1895, the year DMG assembled its 1,000th engine, Maybach returned as  [[Inspector General|General Inspector]], receiving 30,000 shares.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

During this period, they agreed to licenses to build Daimler engines around the world, which included:
* France, from 1890, by [[Panhard|Panhard et Levassor]] and [[Peugeot]]
* the United States, from 1891, under [[Daimler Manufacturing Company|Daimler Motor Company]] of [[Long Island City, Queens|Long Island City]] in a partnership with American and German piano maker [[Steinway &amp; Sons]]&lt;ref name="DaimlerAG-Steinway-Sep2013"&gt;{{cite news|title=125 years ago: Daimler and Steinway founded the Daimler Motor Company in New York|url=http://media.daimler.com/dcmedia/0-921-614822-1-1634310-1-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-0.html|accessdate=17 April 2016|work=[[Daimler AG]]|date=September 26, 2013|location=[[Stuttgart]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MusicTrades-SteinwayMercedes-Mar2004"&gt;{{cite news|title=Steinway Gallery And Mercedes-Benz Celebrate Joint Anniversary|url=http://www.laguardiawagnerarchive.lagcc.cuny.edu/FILES_DOC/STEINWAY_FILES/04.010.0085.11.45.PDF|accessdate=17 April 2016|work=[[The Music Trades (magazine)|The Music Trades]]|publisher=[[La Guardia and Wagner Archives]], [[LaGuardia Community College]]|date=March 2004|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bindelglass|first1=Evan|title=Parsing The Steinway Mansion's Rich Past &amp; Uncertain Future|url=http://ny.curbed.com/2014/3/21/10128800/parsing-the-steinway-mansions-rich-past-uncertain-future|accessdate=2 March 2016|work=[[Curbed]]|date=March 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barron|first1=James|title=Today's Pianos Have Prelude In Yesterday's; Steinway Family Legacy Pervades Factory in Queens|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/19/nyregion/today-s-pianos-have-prelude-yesterday-s-steinway-family-legacy-pervades-factory.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=2 March 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobs2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=A.

Daimler died in 1900, and in 1907 Maybach resigned from DMG.

==Founding of Daimler-Benz==

Daimler had developed the first liquid petroleum vehicle in 1885 and [[Karl Benz]] had developed the first purpose built automobile using a 2 cycle engine of his own design a few months later. Daimler never met Karl Benz during the period of invention. In 1896 Daimler (DMG) sued [[Benz &amp; Cie]] for violating his 1883 patent on hot tube ignition. Daimler won and Benz had to pay royalties to DMG. Daimler did not meet Karl Benz while they were in court in Mannheim. Later at the founding of the Central European Motor Car Association Daimler and Benz still did not speak to each other.

Years after Daimler died, the two companies did cooperate in many ways. After many years of cooperation, on June 28, 1926 representatives of Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (DMG) and [[Benz &amp; Cie]] signed the agreement for the merger of the two oldest automobile manufacturers in the world. The resulting new company was named '''Daimler-Benz'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Merger-in-the-Year-1926-DMG-and-Benz--Cie-merge-to-become-Da.xhtml?oid=12358477 |title=Merger in the Year 1926: DMG and Benz &amp; Cie. merge to become Daimler-Benz AG: Together for the best for 90 years |work=Daimler |accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
Gottlieb Daimler was accepted into the [[Automotive Hall of Fame]] in 1978. Between 1993 and July 2008 Daimler had a stadium named after him in Stuttgart, Germany. The [[Mercedes-Benz Arena (Stuttgart)|Mercedes-Benz Arena]] was the venue for six matches in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany.

Gottlieb Daimler's motto was ''Das Beste oder nichts'' ("The best or nothing at all"; "Nothing but the best").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nitske|first=W Robert |title=The complete Mercedes story: the thrilling seventy-year history of Daimler|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|year=1955|page=9|oclc=59017729}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mercedes-Benz]] adopted this motto as their slogan in 2010.

The '''history of [[tram]]s, streetcars or trolleys''' began in early nineteenth century. It can be divided up into several discrete periods defined by the principal means of motive power used.

==Horse-drawn==
{{Main|Horsecar}}
[[File:Horsetrain 1870.jpg|thumb|The Welsh [[Swansea and Mumbles Railway]] ran the world's first passenger tram service in 1807]]
[[File:MuleDrawn1870s.jpg|thumb|right|Mule-drawn streetcar, [[Houston]], USA, 1870s]]

[[File:Douglas-IOM-horse-tram1.jpg|thumb|The Douglas Bay Horse Tramway in [[Douglas, Isle of Man]] was still operating as of 2017]]

The world's first passenger tram was the [[Swansea and Mumbles Railway]], in [[Wales]], UK. The Mumbles Railway Act was passed by the British Parliament in 1804, and this first horse-drawn passenger tramway started operating in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.welshwales.co.uk/mumbles_railway_swansea.htm |title=The Swansea and Mumbles Railway – the world's first railway service |publisher=Welshwales.co.uk |accessdate=2015-03-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626140319/http://www.welshwales.co.uk/mumbles_railway_swansea.htm |archivedate=26 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was worked by steam from 1877, and then, from 1929, by very large (106-seater) electric tramcars, until closure in 1961.

The first streetcar in America, developed by [[John Stephenson (coachbuilder)|John Stephenson]], began service in the year 1832.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.midcontinent.org/rollingstock/builders/stephenson1.htm The John Stephenson Car Co]. Retrieved 25 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the [[New York and Harlem Railroad]]'s [[Fourth Avenue Line (Manhattan surface)|Fourth Avenue Line]] which ran along the [[Bowery]] and [[Fourth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fourth Avenue]] in New York City. These trams were an animal railway, usually using [[horse]]s and sometimes [[mule]]s to haul the cars, usually two as a team. Rarely, other animals were tried, including humans in emergency circumstances. It was followed in 1835 by [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], which is the oldest continuously operating street railway system in the world, according to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.&lt;!--what line?--&gt;&lt;ref name="Bellis"&gt;{{cite web|last = Bellis|first = Mary|title =  History of Streetcars and Cable Cars|url = http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blstreetcars.htm|accessdate = 2007-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first tram in Continental Europe opened in France in 1839 between [[Montbrison, Loire|Montbrison]] and [[Montrond-les-Bains|Montrond]], on the streets inside the towns, and on the roadside outside town. It had permission for steam traction, but was entirely run with horse traction. In 1848, it was closed down after repeated economic failure.  The tram developed in numerous cities of Europe (some of the most extensive systems were found in Berlin, [[Budapest]], [[Birmingham Corporation Tramways|Birmingham]], [[Leningrad]], [[Lisbon]], [[London County Council Tramways|London]],  [[Manchester Corporation Tramways|Manchester]], [[Tramways in Paris#History|Paris]]).

The first tram in South America opened in 1858 in [[List of town tramway systems in Chile|Santiago, Chile]]. The first trams in Australia opened in 1860 in [[Trams in Sydney|Sydney]]. Africa's first tram service started in [[Trams in Alexandria|Alexandria]] on 8 January 1863. The first trams in Asia opened in 1869 in [[Trams in Asia|Batavia (now Jakarta), Netherlands East Indies (now Indonesia)]].

Problems with horsecars included the fact that any given animal could only work so many hours on a given day, had to be housed, groomed, fed and cared for day in and day out, and produced prodigious amounts of manure, which the streetcar company was charged with storing and then disposing. Since a typical horse pulled a streetcar for about a dozen miles a day and worked for four or five hours, many systems needed ten or more horses in stable for each horsecar.

Horsecars were largely replaced by electric-powered trams following the improvement of an overhead trolley system on trams for collecting electricity from [[overhead wire]]s by [[Frank J. Sprague]]. His spring-loaded [[trolley pole]] used a wheel to travel along the wire. In late 1887 and early 1888, using his trolley system, Sprague installed the first successful large electric street railway system in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. Within a year, the economy of electric power had replaced more costly horsecars in many cities. By 1889, 110 electric railways incorporating Sprague's equipment had been begun or planned on several continents.&lt;ref name="siemens.com"&gt;http://www.siemens.com/history/en/innovations/transportation.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses continued to be used for light shunting well into the 20th century. Many large metropolitan lines lasted well into the early twentieth century. New York City had a regular horsecar service on the [[Bleecker Street Line]] until its closure in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cable-car-guy.com/html/ccmiscnpart.html#nylasthc "New York Loses its Last Horse Car"] ''New York Times'' Friday, July 29, 1917. Page 12 (Cable Car Lines in New York and New Jersey)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pittsburgh]], had its Sarah Street line drawn by horses until 1923. The last regular mule-drawn cars in the US ran in [[Sulphur Rock, Arkansas]], until 1926 and were commemorated by a [[U.S. postage stamp]] issued in 1983.&lt;ref name="encyclopediaofarkansas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=3727|title=Sulphur Rock Street Car; Encyclopedia of Arkansas History &amp; Culture|accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last mule tram service in [[Mexico City]] ended in 1932, and a mule tram in [[Celaya, Mexico]], survived until 1954.&lt;ref name="morrison_celaya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tramz.com/mx/ce/ce.html|title=The Indomitable Tramways of Celaya|author=Allen Morrison|accessdate=2008-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last horse-drawn tram to be withdrawn from public service in the UK took passengers from [[Fintona]] railway station to Fintona Junction one mile away on the main Omagh to Enniskillen railway in Northern Ireland. The tram made its last journey on 30 September 1957 when the Omagh to Enniskillen line closed. The "van" now lies at the Ulster Transport Museum.

Horse-drawn trams still operate on the 1876-built [[Douglas Bay Horse Tramway]] in the [[Isle of Man]], and at the 1894-built [[Victor Harbor Horse Drawn Tram]], in Adelaide, South Australia. New horse-drawn systems have been established at the [[Hokkaidō]] Museum in Japan and also in [[Disneyland]].

The first mechanical trams were powered by [[steam engine|steam]]. Generally, there were two types of steam tram. The first and most common had a small [[steam locomotive]] (called a [[tram engine]] in the UK) at the head of a line of one or more carriages, similar to a small train. Systems with such steam trams included [[Christchurch]], New Zealand; [[Trams in Adelaide|Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]; Sydney, Australia and other city systems in [[New South Wales]]; [[Munich]], Germany (from August 1883 on),&lt;ref name=Muenchen1964&gt;

Steam tramways also were used on the suburban tramway lines around [[Milan]] and [[Padua]]; the last ''Gamba de Legn'' ("Peg-Leg") tramway ran on the Milan-[[Magenta]]-Castano Primo route in late 1958.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The other style of steam tram had the steam engine in the body of the tram, referred to as a [[tram engine]] (UK) or [[steam dummy]] (US). The most notable system to adopt such trams was in Paris. French-designed steam trams also operated in [[Rockhampton, Queensland|Rockhampton]], in the Australian state of [[Queensland]] between 1909 and 1939. [[Stockholm]], Sweden, had a steam tram line at the island of [[Södermalm]] between 1887 and 1901.

Tram engines usually had modifications to make them suitable for street running in residential areas. The wheels, and other moving parts of the machinery, were usually enclosed for safety reasons and to make the engines quieter. Measures were often taken to prevent the engines from emitting visible smoke or steam. Usually the engines used [[coke (fuel)|coke]] rather than coal as fuel to avoid emitting smoke; [[Condensing steam locomotive|condensers]] or [[Superheater|superheating]] were used to avoid emitting visible steam. A major drawback of this style of tram was the limited space for the engine, so that these trams were usually underpowered. Steam tram engines faded out around 1890s to 1900s, being replaced by electric trams.

==Cable-hauled==
{{Main|Cable car (railway)}}

Another motive system for trams was the cable car, which was pulled along a [[rail track|fixed track]] by a moving steel cable. The power to move the cable was normally provided at a "powerhouse" site a distance away from the actual vehicle.

The [[London and Blackwall Railway]], which opened for passengers in east London, England, in 1840 used such a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robertson|first=Andrew|date=March 1848|title=Blackwall Railway Machinery|journal=The Civil engineer and architect's journal|publisher=Wiley &amp; Putnam|location=New York|volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first practical cable car line was tested in [[San Francisco cable car system|San Francisco]], in 1873. Part of its success is attributed to the development of an effective and reliable [[cable grip]] mechanism, to grab and release the moving cable without damage. The second city to operate cable trams was [[Dunedin cable tramway system|Dunedin]] in New Zealand, from 1881 to 1957.

The most extensive cable system in the US was built in [[Chicago City Railway|Chicago]] between 1882 and 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Borzo|first=Greg|title=Chicago Cable Cars|year=2012|publisher=The History Press|lccn=|isbn=978-1-60949-327-1|pages=15–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{when|date=March 2013}} New York City developed at least seven cable car lines.{{when|date=March 2013}} Los Angeles also had several cable car lines, including the Second Street Cable Railroad, which operated from 1885 to 1889, and the Temple Street Cable Railway, which operated from 1886 to 1898.

[[File:Melbourne cable tram 1905.jpg|thumb|Cable tram dummy and trailer on the [[Melbourne tram route 96|St. Kilda Line]] in Melbourne in 1905.]]
From 1885 to 1940, the city of [[Melbourne cable tramway system|Melbourne]], Victoria, Australia operated one of the largest cable systems in the world, at its peak running 592 trams on {{convert|75|km|mi}} of track. There were also two isolated cable lines in [[Sydney]], New South Wales, Australia; the North Sydney line from 1886 to 1900,&lt;ref&gt;[[Trams in Sydney]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the King Street line from 1892 to 1905.

In [[Dresden]], Germany, in 1901 an elevated [[suspension railway|suspended]] cable car following the ''Eugen Langen one-railed floating tram system'' started operating. Cable cars operated on [[Highgate Hill]] in North London and [[Kennington]] to [[Brixton]] Hill In South London.{{when|date=March 2013}} They also worked around "Upper Douglas" in the [[Isle of Man]] from 1897 to 1929 (cable car 72/73 is the sole survivor of the fleet).

Cable cars suffered from high [[infrastructure]] costs, since an expensive system of [[Wire rope|cables]], [[pulley]]s, [[stationary engine]]s and lengthy underground vault structures beneath the rails had to be provided. They also required physical strength and skill to operate, and alert operators to avoid obstructions and other cable cars. The cable had to be disconnected ("dropped") at designated locations to allow the cars to coast by inertia, for example when crossing another cable line. The cable would then have to be "picked up" to resume progress, the whole operation requiring precise timing to avoid damage to the cable and the grip mechanism. Breaks and frays in the cable, which occurred frequently, required the complete cessation of services over a cable route while the cable was repaired. Due to overall wear, the entire length of cable (typically several kilometres) would have to be replaced on a regular schedule. After the development of reliable electrically powered trams, the costly high-maintenance cable car systems were rapidly replaced in most locations.

Cable cars remained especially effective in hilly cities, since their nondriven wheels would not [[rail adhesion|lose traction]] as they climbed or descended a steep hill. The moving cable would physically pull the car up the hill at a steady pace, unlike a low-powered steam or horse-drawn car. Cable cars do have wheel brakes and [[track brake]]s, but the cable also helps restrain the car to going downhill at a constant speed. Performance in steep terrain partially explains the survival of cable cars in San Francisco.

The [[San Francisco cable car system|San Francisco cable cars]], though significantly reduced in number, continue to perform a regular transportation function, in addition to being a well-known [[tourist attraction]]. A single cable line also survives in [[Wellington]], New Zealand (rebuilt in 1979 as a [[funicular]] but still called the "[[Wellington Cable Car]]"). Another system, actually two separate cable lines with a shared power station in the middle, operates from the Welsh town of [[Llandudno]] up to the top of the [[Great Orme]] hill in [[North Wales]], UK.

==Gas==
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries a number of systems in various parts of the world employed trams powered by gas, [[naphtha]] gas or [[coal gas]] in particular. Gas trams are known to have operated between [[Alphington, Victoria|Alphington]] and [[Clifton Hill, Victoria|Clifton Hill]] in the northern suburbs of [[Melbourne]], Australia (1886–1888); in Berlin and [[Dresden]], Germany; in [[Estonia]] (1920s–1930); between [[Jelenia Góra]], [[Jelenia Góra|Cieplice]], and [[Sobieszów]] in Poland (from 1897); and in the UK at [[Lytham St Annes]], [[Neath]] (1896–1920), and [[Trafford Park]], Manchester (1897–1908).

On 29 December 1886 the Melbourne newspaper ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'' reprinted a report from the [[San Francisco Bulletin]] that Mr Noble had demonstrated a new 'motor car' for tramways 'with success'. The tramcar 'exactly similar in size, shape, and capacity to a cable grip car' had the 'motive power' of gas 'with which the reservoir is to be charged once a day at power stations by means of a rubber hose'. The car also carried an electricity generator for 'lighting up the tram and also for driving the engine on steep grades and effecting a start'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11584473 |title=WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1886. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=29 December 1886 |accessdate=10 March 2013 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparatively little has been published about gas trams. However, research on the subject was carried out for an article in the October 2011 edition of "The Times", the historical journal of the Australian Association of Timetable Collectors, now the Australian Timetable Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdn.timetable.org.au/thetimes201110issue.pdf|title=Australian Timetable Association|last=Isaacs|first=Albert|date=2012-08-10|website=|publisher=austta.org.au|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://markthefitter.blogspot.com/2008_11_01_archive.html |title=mark the fitter: November 2008 |publisher=Markthefitter.blogspot.com |date=2008-11-17 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22gas+tram%22+Northcote+history&amp;rls=com.microsoft:en-au:IE-SearchBox&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sourceid=ie7&amp;rlz=1I7GGLL_en-GB&amp;redir_esc=&amp;ei=R1MvTpXqGamdmQW4ofga]{{Dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ceti&gt;

The world's first experimental electric tramway was built by Russian inventor Fyodor Pirotsky near St Petersburg in 1880. The first commercially-successful electric tram line operated in [[Lichterfelde (Berlin)|Lichterfelde]] near Berlin, Germany, in 1881. It was built by [[Werner von Siemens]] (see [[Berlin Straßenbahn]]). It initially drew current from the rails, with overhead wire being installed in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wN4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA750&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1930+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fxBvTp7pAoyhtwfhqq33CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "This is how some of the world's familiar..."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101185206/https://books.google.com/books?id=wN4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA750&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1930+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fxBvTp7pAoyhtwfhqq33CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBzgU |date=1 January 2016 }} ''Popular Mechanics'', May 1929, pg. 750. via Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, Volk's electric railway was opened in 1883 in Brighton (see [[Volk's Electric Railway]]). This two kilometer line, re-gauged to {{convert|2|ft|9|in|mm}} in 1884, remains in service to this day, and is the oldest operating electric tramway in the world. Also in 1883, [[Mödling and Hinterbrühl Tram]] was opened near [[Vienna]] in Austria. It was the first tram in the world in regular service that was run with electricity served by an overhead line with pantograph current collectors. The [[Blackpool Tramway]], was opened in Blackpool, UK on 29 September 1885 using conduit collection along Blackpool Promenade. This system is still in operation in a modernised form.

Earliest tram system in Canada was by [[John Joseph Wright]], brother of the famous mining entrepreneur [[Whitaker Wright]], in [[Toronto]] in 1883. In the US, multiple functioning experimental [[Tram#Electric (trolley cars)|electric trams]] were exhibited at the 1884 [[World Cotton Centennial]] World's Fair in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], but they were not deemed good enough to replace the [[Emile Lamm|Lamm]] fireless engines then propelling the [[St. Charles Avenue Streetcar]] in that city. The first commercial installation of an electric streetcar in the United States was built in 1884 in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and operated for a period of one year by the East Cleveland Street Railway Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=American Public Transportation Association |title=Milestones in U.S. Public Transportation History |url=http://apta.com/research/stats/history/mileston.cfm |accessdate=2013-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303212350/http://apta.com/research/stats/history/mileston.cfm |archivedate=3 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trams were operated in  [[Richmond, Virginia]], in 1888, on the [[Richmond Union Passenger Railway]] built by [[Frank J. Sprague]]. Sprague later developed [[multiple unit]] control, first demonstrated in Chicago in 1897, allowing multiple cars to be coupled together and operated by a single motorman. This gave birth to the modern subway train. Following the improvement of an overhead trolley system on streetcars for collecting electricity from [[overhead wire]]s by [[Frank J. Sprague]], electric tram systems were rapidly adopted across the world.

Earlier installations proved difficult or unreliable. Siemens' line, for example, provided power through a live rail and a return rail, like a [[model train]], limiting the [[voltage]] that could be used, and providing electric shocks to people and animals crossing the tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Wood|first = E.

While this line proved quite versatile as one of the earliest fully functional electric streetcar installations, it required horse-drawn support while climbing the [[Niagara Escarpment]] and for two months of the winter when [[hydroelectricity]] was not available. It continued in service in its original form into the 1950s.

[[Sidney Howe Short]] designed and produced the first [[electric motor]] that operated a streetcar without gears. The motor had its [[armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] direct-connected to the [[streetcar]]'s [[axle]] for the driving force.{{sfn|Kaempffert|Martin|1924|pages=122-123}}{{sfn|Hammond|2011|p=142}}&lt;ref name=FtWorth1894&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Professor Sidney Howe Short experiments with motors |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9450242// | work=[[Fort Worth Daily Gazette]] |location=Fort Worth, Texas |date= November 11, 1894 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grace"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Sidney_Howe_Short |title=Sidney Howe Short |work=Grace's Guide to British Industrial History |publisher=Grace's Guide Ltd. |accessdate=March 10, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312062123/http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Sidney_Howe_Short |archivedate=12 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Topeka1894&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Street Railways his hobby |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9450668// | work=[[Topeka Daily Capital]] |location=Topeka, Kansas |date=November 14, 1894 |via=[[newspapers.com]] {{open access}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short pioneered "use of a conduit system of concealed feed" thereby eliminating the necessity of [[Overhead line|overhead wire]], [[trolley pole]]s and a [[Trolleybus|trolley]] for street cars and railways.{{sfn|Malone|1928|p=128}}{{sfn|Kaempffert|Martin|1924|pages=122-123}}{{sfn|Hammond|2011|p=142}} While at the University of Denver he conducted important experiments which established that [[multiple unit]] powered cars were a better way to operate trains and trolleys.{{sfn|Kaempffert|Martin|1924|pages=122-123}}{{sfn|Hammond|2011|p=142}}

The first electric tramway in Australia was a Sprague system demonstrated at the 1888 [[Melbourne Centennial Exhibition]] in [[Trams in Melbourne|Melbourne]]; afterwards, this was installed as a commercial venture operating between the outer Melbourne suburbs of [[Box Hill, Victoria|Box Hill]] and [[Doncaster, Victoria|Doncaster]] from 1889 to 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Robert|title=The first electric road : a history of the Box Hill and Doncaster tramway|date=1989|publisher=John Mason Press|location=East Brighton, Victoria|isbn=0731667158}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, electric systems were built in [[Trams in Adelaide|Adelaide]], [[Trams in Ballarat|Ballarat]], [[Trams in Bendigo|Bendigo]], [[Trams in Brisbane|Brisbane]], [[Trams in Fremantle|Fremantle]], [[Trams in Geelong|Geelong]], [[Trams in Hobart|Hobart]], [[Trams in Kalgoorlie|Kalgoorlie]], [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]], [[Leonora, Western Australia|Leonora]], [[Trams in Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[Trams in Perth|Perth]],  and [[Trams in Sydney|Sydney]]. By the 1970s, the only tramway system remaining in Australia was the Melbourne tram system other than a few single lines remaining elsewhere: the [[Glenelg Tram]], connecting Adelaide to the beachside suburb of [[Glenelg, South Australia|Glenelg]], and tourist trams in the Victorian [[Goldfields region of Victoria|Goldfields]] cities of Bendigo and Ballarat. In recent years the Melbourne system, generally recognised as one of the largest in the world, has been considerably modernised and expanded. The Adelaide line has also been extended to the Entertainment Centre, and there are plans to expand further.

In Japan, the Kyoto Electric railroad was the first tram system, starting operation in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city.kyoto.jp/koho/eng/historical/first/04.html Kyoto Tram from Kyoto City Web]. Retrieved 12 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1932, the network had grown to 82 railway companies in 65 cities, with a total network length of {{convert|1,479|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japanfs.org/en/mailmagazine/newsletter/pages/027840.html The Rebirth of Trams from the JFS Newsletter, December 2007]. Retrieved 12 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1960s the tram had generally died out in Japan.

Two rare but significant alternatives were [[conduit current collection]], which was widely used in London, Washington, D.C. and New York City, and the [[Stud contact system|surface contact collection]] method, used in [[Wolverhampton]] (the Lorain system), [[Torquay Tramways|Torquay]] and [[Hastings]] in the UK (the Dolter stud system), and currently in [[Tramway de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], France (the [[ground-level power supply]] system).

The convenience and economy of electricity resulted in its rapid adoption once the technical problems of production and transmission of electricity were solved. Electric trams largely replaced animal power and other forms of motive power including cable and steam, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

There is one particular hazard associated with trams powered from a trolley off an overhead line. Since the tram relies on contact with the rails for the current return path, a problem arises if the tram is derailed or (more usually) if it halts on a section of track that has been particularly heavily sanded by a previous tram, and the tram loses electrical contact with the rails. In this event, the underframe of the tram, by virtue of a circuit path through ancillary loads (such as saloon lighting), is live at the full supply voltage, typically 600 volts. In British terminology such a tram was said to be ‘grounded’—not to be confused with the US English use of the term, which means the exact opposite. Any person stepping off the tram completed the earth return circuit and could receive a nasty electric shock. In such an event the driver was required to jump off the tram (avoiding simultaneous contact with the tram and the ground) and pull down the trolley before allowing passengers off the tram. Unless derailed, the tram could usually be recovered by running water down the running rails from a point higher than the tram. The water providing a conducting bridge between the tram and the rails.

In the 2000s, two companies introduced catenary-free designs. Alstom's Citadis line uses a third rail, and Bombardier's PRIMOVE LRV is charged by contactless induction plates embedded in the trackway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetransportpolitic.wordpress.com/2009/01/22/bombardier-presents-new-catenary-free-streetcar/ Wordpress.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129082418/http://thetransportpolitic.wordpress.com/2009/01/22/bombardier-presents-new-catenary-free-streetcar/ |date=29 January 2009 }}, "The transport politic"&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1834, [[Thomas Davenport (inventor)|Thomas Davenport]], a Vermont blacksmith, had invented a battery-powered electric motor which he later patented.

Attempts to use [[Lead-acid battery|batteries]] as a source of electricity were made from the 1880s and 1890s, with unsuccessful trials conducted in among other places [[Bendigo]] and [[Adelaide]] in Australia, and for about 14 years as The [[Hague]] ''accutram'' of [[HTM Personenvervoer|HTM]] in the Netherlands. The first trams in [[Bendigo]], Australia, in 1892, were battery-powered but within as little as three months they were replaced with horse-drawn trams. In New York City some minor lines also used storage batteries. Then, comparatively recently, during the 1950s, a longer battery-operated tramway line ran from Milan to [[Bergamo]]. In China there is a [[Trams in Nanjing|Nanjing battery Tram line]] and has been running since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/urban/single-view/view/battery-trams-running-in-nanjing.html?sword_list%255B%255D=nanjing&amp;sword_list%255B%255D=tram&amp;no_cache=1|title=Battery trams running in Nanjing|last=UK|first=DVV Media|website=Railway Gazette|access-date=2016-06-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114232814/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/urban/single-view/view/battery-trams-running-in-nanjing.html?sword_list%255B%255D=nanjing&amp;sword_list%255B%255D=tram&amp;no_cache=1|archivedate=14 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some places, other forms of power were used to power the tram.

[[Hastings]] and some other tramways, for example [[Stockholms Spårvägar]] in Sweden and some lines in [[Karachi]], used [[Petrol engine|petrol]] trams. Paris operated trams that were powered by [[Pneumatics|compressed air]] using the [[Mekarski system]].

[[Galveston Island Trolley]] in Texas operated [[Galveston Island Trolley|diesel trams]] due to the city's hurricane-prone location, which would result in frequent damage to an electrical supply system. Although [[Portland, Victoria]] promotes its tourist tram&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com.au/search?q=Portland+Tram&amp;rls=com.microsoft:en-au:IE-SearchBox&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sourceid=ie7&amp;rlz=1I7GGLL_en-GB&amp;redir_esc=&amp;ei=RPExTqDCHKzzmAWQuZTxCg|title=Portland Tram – Google Search|work=Google.com.au|accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; as being a cable car it actually operates using a hidden diesel motor. The tram, which runs on a circular route around the town of Portland, uses dummies and salons formerly used on the extensive [[Melbourne cable tramway system]] and now beautifully restored.

In March 2015, [[CSR Corporation Limited|China South Rail Corporation]] (CSR) demonstrated the world's first hydrogen [[fuel cell vehicle]] tramcar at an assembly facility in Qingdao. The chief engineer of the CSR subsidiary [[CSR Sifang Co Ltd.]], Liang Jianying, said that the company is studying how to reduce the running costs of the tram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://en.yibada.com/articles/21142/20150321/china-worlds-first-hydrogen-fueled-tram.htm#|title=China Presents the World's First Hydrogen-Fueled Tram}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iflscience.com/technology/china-develops-worlds-first-hydrogen-powered-tram|title=China Develops World's First Hydrogen-Powered Tram|work=IFLScience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hybrid systems==
[[File:Tram Trieste 2009 11.JPG|thumb|A cable tractor assisting a tramcar on the cable section of the [[Opicina Tramway]] in [[Trieste]], Italy.]]

The [[Trieste–Opicina tramway]] in [[Trieste]] operates a hybrid funicular tramway system. Conventional electric trams are operated in [[street running]] and on [[reserved track]] for most of their route. However, on one steep segment of track, they are assisted by cable tractors, which push the trams uphill and act as brakes for the downhill run. For safety, the cable tractors are always deployed on the downhill side of the tram vehicle.

Similar systems were used elsewhere in the past, notably on the Queen Anne Counterbalance in Seattle and the [[Darling Street]] wharf line in Sydney.

==Rail profile==
At first the [[Rail profile|rails]] protruded above street level, causing accidents and problems for pedestrians. They were supplanted in 1852 by [[Tramway track#Grooved rail|grooved rails]] or [[Tramway track#Grooved rail|girder rails]], invented by [[Alphonse Loubat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valdeseinevert.net/spip.php?article84 Conférence sur Alphonse LOUBAT, inventeur du tramway] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922173813/http://www.valdeseinevert.net/spip.php?article84 |date=22 September 2008 }}. In French. Retrieved 11 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Loubat, inspired by Stephenson, built the first tramline in Paris, France. The {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} line was inaugurated on 21 November 1853, in connection with the  [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|1855 World Fair]], running on a trial basis from [[Place de la Concorde]] to [[Pont de Sèvres]] and later to the village of [[Boulogne-Billancourt|Boulogne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tramwayinfo.com/Tramframe.htm?http://www.tramwayinfo.com/tramways/Articles/Origins.htm John Prentice: Tramway Origins and Pioneers]. Retrieved 11 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Toronto streetcar system]] is one of the few in North America still operating in the classic style on street trackage shared with car traffic, where streetcars stop on demand at frequent stops like buses rather than having fixed stations. Known as Red Rockets because of their colour, they have been operating since the mid-19th century – [[horsecar]] service started in 1856 and electric service in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toronto.ca/ttc/history.htm Toronto Transport Commission – History].

[[File:København Kopenhagen KS SL 621094.jpg|thumb|right|[[Trams in Copenhagen|Copenhagen tram]], January 1969. (Grossraumtriebwagen 524) The then obsolete tram model would soon be phased out, and the entire system closed.]]

The advent of personal motor vehicles and the improvements in motorized buses caused the rapid disappearance of the tram from most western and Asian countries by the end of the 1950s (for example the first major UK city to completely abandon its trams was [[Manchester Corporation Tramways|Manchester]] by January 1949). Continuing technical and reliability improvements in buses made them a serious competitor to trams because they did not require the construction of costly infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070702205035/http://www.lava.net/cslater/TQOrigin.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the demise of the streetcar came when lines were torn out of the major cities by "bus manufacturing or oil marketing companies for the specific purpose of replacing rail service with buses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.heritagetrolley.org/articleTennyson.htm | title=Transit Ridership – Rail vs. Bus | publisher=APTA Streetcar and Heritage Trolley Site | accessdate=4 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases postwar buses were cited as providing a smoother ride and a faster journey than the older, prewar trams. For example, the tram network survived in Budapest but for a considerable period of time bus fares were higher to recognize the superior quality of the buses. However, many riders protested against the replacement of streetcars arguing that buses weren't as smooth or efficient and polluted the air. In the United States, there have been allegations that the [[Great American streetcar scandal]] was responsible for the replacement of trains with buses, but critics of this theory point to evidence that larger economic forces were driving conversion before General Motors' actions and outside of its reach. Certainly the oldest system of all, the [[Swansea and Mumbles Railway]] of 1807, was purchased by The South Wales Transport Company (which operated a large motor bus fleet in the area) and despite vociferous local opposition, closed down in 1960.

Governments thus put investment principally into bus networks. Indeed, infrastructure for roads and highways meant for the automobile were perceived as a mark of progress. The priority given to roads is illustrated in the proposal of French president [[Georges Pompidou]] who declared in 1971 that "the city must adapt to the car". Tram networks were no longer maintained or modernized, a state of affairs that served to discredit them in the eyes of the public. Old lines, considered archaic, were then gradually replaced by buses.

Tram networks disappeared almost completely from France, the UK, and altogether from Ireland, Denmark, Spain, as well as being completely removed from cities such as [[Trams in Sydney|Sydney]], which had one of the largest networks in the world with route length {{convert|291|mi|km|abbr=on}} and [[Trams in Brisbane|Brisbane]]. The vast majority of tram networks also disappeared in North America, but American cities [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[San Francisco]], [[New Orleans]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Cleveland]], Canadian [[Toronto]] and [[Mexico City]] still retained trams. This situation occurred in Italy and Netherlands, too. There are preserved system in [[Milan]], [[Rome]], [[Naples]], [[Turin]], [[Ritten]] and between [[Trieste–Opicina tramway|Trieste and Opicina]], and in [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[The Hague]]. On the other hand, tram systems were generally retained or modernized in most [[communism|communist]] countries, as well as Switzerland, West Germany, Austria, Belgium, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Japan etc. though cuts and closures of entire systems also happened there as the example of Hamburg shows. In France, only the networks in [[Lille]], [[Saint-Étienne]] and [[Marseille]], survive from this period, but they all suffered significant reduction from their original size. In Great Britain, only the [[Blackpool Tramway]] kept running, with an extensive system which includes some street running in Blackpool, and a long stretch of segregated track to nearby Fleetwood.

==Modern development==
While many networks closed down during the postwar decades, the rolling stock on remaining systems kept developing, with multi-car trains (or [[articulated vehicles|articulated trams]]) with double-end designs and automatic control systems, allowing a single driver to serve more passengers. Passenger and driver comfort have improved with stuffed seats and cabin heating. Advertising on trams, including all-over striping, became common.

With the resurgence in the late 20th and 21st century, [[low-floor tram]]s, with [[regenerative braking]] have been developed.

==Resurgences==
[[File:Eurotram Strasbourg Langstross tram A (2004).jpg|thumb|Tram in [[Strasbourg]], 2004]]
[[File:GVB Combino (Amsterdam tram) on route 10.jpg|thumb|A [[Siemens]] [[Combino]] tram in [[Amsterdam]], 2004]]
[[File:M32tram.jpg|thumb|An Italian produced [[Sirio]] tram in [[Gothenburg]], 2006]]
The priority given to personal vehicles and notably to the automobile led to a loss in quality of life, particularly in large cities where [[smog]], [[traffic congestion]], [[Noise pollution|sound pollution]] and [[parking]] became problematic. Acknowledging this, some authorities saw fit to redefine their transport policies. [[Rapid transit]] required a heavy investment and presented problems in terms of subterranean spaces that required constant security. For rapid transit, the investment was mainly in underground construction, which made it impossible in some cities (with underground water reserves, archaeological remains, etc.). Metro construction thus was not a universal panacea.

The advantages of the tram thus became once again visible. At the end of the 1970s, some governments studied, and then built new tram lines. The renaissance of light rail in North America began in 1978 when the Canadian city of [[Edmonton, Alberta]] adopted the German [[Siemens-Duewag U2]] system, followed three years later by [[Calgary, Alberta]] and [[San Diego, California]].

Britain began replacing its run-down local railways with light rail in the 1980s, starting with the [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] in [[Tyneside]] and followed by the [[Docklands Light Railway]] in London. The trend to light rail in the United Kingdom was firmly established with the success of the [[Manchester Metrolink]] system and [[Sheffield Supertram]] in 1992, followed by [[Midland Metro]] in Birmingham in 1999, and [[Tramlink]] in London in 2000.

In France, [[Nantes]] and [[Grenoble]] lead the way in terms of the modern tram, and new systems were inaugurated in 1985 and 1988. In 1994 [[Strasbourg]] opened a system with novel British-built trams, specified by the city, with the goal of breaking with the archaic conceptual image that was held by the public.

A great example of this shift in ideology is the city of [[Munich]], which began replacing its tram network with a [[rapid transit|metro]] a few years before the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]. When the metro network was finished in the 1990s the city began to tear out the tram network (which had become rather old and decrepit), but now faced opposition from many citizens who enjoyed the enhanced mobility of the mixed network—the metro lines deviate from the tram lines to a significant degree. New [[rolling stock]] was purchased and the system was modernized, and a new line was proposed in 2003.

The Olympic Games of 2004 that prompted the redevelopment of trams as part of the [[Athens Mass Transit System]]. The [[Athens Tram|tramways in Athens]] are integrated with the revived [[Athens Metro]] system, as well as the buses, trolleybuses and suburban trains.

In [[Melbourne]], Australia, the already extensive tramway system continues to be extended. In 2004 the Mont Albert line was extended several kilometres to Box Hill, whilst in 2005 the Burwood East line was extended several kilometres to Vermont South. In Sydney, trams returned in the form of [[Light rail in Sydney|light rail]] with the opening of the [[Inner West Light Rail]] line in 1997, which has seen extensions and now covers {{convert|7.2|mi|abbr=on}}.

In Scotland, [[Edinburgh]] relaunched its [[Edinburgh Trams|tram network]] on 31 May 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-27250311 | title=Edinburgh tram starting date revealed as 31 May | publisher=BBC | date=2 May 2014 | accessdate=4 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after delayed development which began in 2008. Edinburgh previously had an extensive tram network which began closure in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grantonhistory.org/transport/edinburgh_tram_maps.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The new network is significantly smaller, 8.7 miles, compared to the previous tram network, 47.25 miles.

Systems such as [[tram-train]]s are bringing rail based transit to areas that never had it and would not otherwise have gotten it. The [[Karlsruhe model]] was one of the first in the modern era and provided one seat rides where several connections would have been necessary before, increasing ridership by significant amounts upon opening of service compared to prior bus or local train routes.

'''IPC''', the '''Association Connecting Electronics Industries''', is a [[trade association]] whose aim is to standardize the assembly and production requirements of [[Electronics|electronic]] equipment and assemblies. It was founded in 1957 as the Institute for Printed Circuits. Its name was later changed to the Institute for Interconnecting and Packaging Electronic Circuits to highlight the expansion from bare boards to packaging and electronic assemblies. In 1999, the organization formally changed its name to IPC with the accompanying tagline, ''Association Connecting Electronics Industries''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipc.org/ContentPage.aspx?pageid=IPCs-Name |title=History of IPC's Name |work=IPC |accessdate=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IPC is accredited by the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) as a [[Standards organization#Standards Developing Organizations .28SDOs.29|standards developing organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.standardsportal.org/usa_en/resources/sdo.aspx |title=Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs) |work=ANSI |accessdate=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is known globally for its standards.

'''Joan Ball''' was a [[computer dating]] pioneer who started the first computer dating service in England, in 1964. Ball's computer dating service also pre-dated the earliest American computer dating services, like Operation Match at Harvard.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Just Me|last=Ball|first=Joan|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=1312560142|location=|pages=318|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hicks|first=Marie|date=1 November 2016|title=Computer Love: Replicating Social Order Through Early Computer Dating Systems

== Early life ==
Joan Ball was born in 1934 and was the 6th child in her family.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was an unwanted child born to a poor, working-class family. She was briefly abandoned by her mother when she was very young. [[World War II]] started when she was only five years old, resulting in her being evacuated from London to the countryside to escape the aerial bombardments of London three times during the war. Although this may have saved her life, each foster family differed greatly and she was sexually harassed by one of the foster families with whom she lived.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When the war was over she was able to go home to her family in London again.

Joan Ball was dyslexic and struggled in school. She went through most of her life suffering from [[dyslexia]], before it was known as such. She was not officially diagnosed until 1973, at the age of 39.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a coping mechanism she became the class clown when she was in school, so that she could make sure people "laughed with [her]"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://logicmag.io/02-the-mother-of-all-swipes/|title=The Mother of All Swipes|date=2017-09-18|work=Logic Magazine|access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not at her. During her school years she had a difficult home life: her mother often called her "a pig-headed bitch",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and blamed Joan for her failing marriage. In 1949, Ball finished her last year of school and got a job as a shop assistant at The [[London Co-operative Society]]. Because of her dyslexia she had problems with writing and counting money.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Career and later life ==
In 1953, Ball was hospitalized after a suicide attempt and when she got out she went to live with her aunt Maud and uncle Ted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The same year, at the age of 19, she got hired at [[Bourne &amp; Hollingsworth]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1954, she left and started working in a store's dress department.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She found this string of jobs unfulfilling and difficult: at the time, the most interesting parts of the fashion industry—in Ball's view—were still a man's world and she could not do the kind of work she was interested in, like design. Shortly thereafter, however, she was able to start working for Berkertex, a leading fashion house in London.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Eros Friendship Bureau Ltd ===
In 1961, when she was 27, she decided to leave Berkertex.  Though she had intended to manage a shop in Cambridge she found herself out of a job until the shop was ready to open. Needing to pay rent, she took a job at a marriage bureau.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was here that she decided to start her own marriage bureau. She founded the Eros Friendship Bureau Ltd in 1962 and discovered she had a knack for helping people make connections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though her company would go on to be successful for a decade, she had trouble advertising her service early on because of the fact marriage bureaus were seen as slightly suspect at the time: There was a widespread belief that marriage bureaus were actually fronts for prostitution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Because she could not advertise in print easily Ball relied on placing radio ads with the "[[Pirate radio in the United Kingdom|Pop Pirates]]"—the pirate radio stations that operated just off the coast of Britain in the 1960s playing rock and roll music that the BBC had banned.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://logicmag.io/02-the-mother-of-all-swipes/|title=The Mother of All Swipes|date=2017-09-18|work=Logic Magazine|access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ball's company focused on long term match-ups and relationships—primarily trying to achieve marriages for clients—and catered to an older crowd who were looking to settle down or who had been previously divorced.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1961, she met a man she refers to in her memoir as Kenneth. Kenneth would later become her sexual partner and would help her in her business, though they were never married.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== St. James Computer Dating Service ===
Joan changed the name of her marriage bureau to the St. James Computer Dating Service in 1964 and the bureau ran its first set of computer match ups in 1964. This made Ball's service the first commercially successful computer dating service in either the UK or the US, as historian Marie Hicks points out in a recent article on the history of computer dating.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://logicmag.io/02-the-mother-of-all-swipes/|title=The Mother of All Swipes|date=2017-09-18|work=Logic Magazine|access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

=== Com-Pat ===
In 1965, Ball merged her company with another marriage bureau run by a woman and together they formed Com-Pat, or Computer Dating Services Ltd. Shortly after the merger, the owner of the other marriage bureau sold out her share in the company to Joan and Joan became the sole proprietor of Com-Pat.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Competition from rival companies ===
Dateline, founded by [[John Richard Patterson]] in 1966, was a rival to Com-Pat. With this new rivalry, Ball saw the greater need for more advertising. Looking at questionnaires from Dateline and Operation Match in the USA, she learned that they emphasized questions about sex, which she and her employees thought would not lead to good matches. By 1969, her company was receiving a good response to their ads in News of the World, but Ball still felt she had to overcome the mindset that people had about computer dating being slightly odd or untoward. Newspapers at the time implied the people who used these services were lonely, sad or dysfunctional. Joan believed that this type of computer dating service was, on the contrary, a fun and intelligent way to meet people. Though newspapers sometimes painted a negative picture, Joan's company was generally well received by the public. This led her to advertise in The Sunday Express, Evening Standard, and The Observer—all major British newspapers at the time. At this time, Ball was running both Com-Pat and Eros. Soon she decided to sell Eros and focus on Com-Pat. She realized how important the future of computerized dating was and saw the potential growth of a service like Com-Pat.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Com-Pat II ===
In 1970, Com-Pat Two was launched. Joan and her company were ahead of the game, because they were using the most advanced matching system created at the time. They were able to change the whole system with 50,000 members in a single weekend without any problems. The system used a questionnaire, and gave a list of four of the top matches at the end.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Though Joan had success with Com-Pat Two, she and her partner Ken began to run into economic and personal problems. Because Joan and Ken weren't married, Ball felt she had no sense of security with him. She eventually moved into her own flat after living with Ken for eight years. This new place gave her a sense of independence, security, and pride because of what she had needed to accomplish to get it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Problems with advertisements ====
Unfortunately troubled times were ahead for her company. Ball realized that their telephone number and address had been printed incorrectly in one of her major advertisements. Their telephone number had also been removed from the directory. This forced her to get a new phone number. At the same time, Dateline was becoming more and more successful and was able to leverage the fact the newspapers already took Com-Pat's advertisements to place its own ads in the same papers without the difficulties that Ball had faced earlier. In 1971, there was a Post Office strike which halted all mail. It lasted almost eight weeks and Ball's business couldn't do anything during that time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Everything hit an all time low when the Daily Telegraph, the company's most successful advertising venue, refused to continue printing ads for Com-Pat because the paper had changed their advertising policy. Joan became depressed and felt unable to cope. At the same time, the UK was wracked with major strikes and economic problems: The miners' strike was causing chaos nationwide by disrupting the country's ability to produce electricity and power the government, businesses and industries that kept the economy functioning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Sale of Com-Pat to Dateline ===
In 1973, when she was 39, she was finally diagnosed with dyslexia. Not many people knew the word, so she stopped using it when no one else knew what she was talking about. She had trouble coming to terms with her own illness. By this time, the recession had worsened. She had been fighting to keep her company afloat but by 1974 she was in debt and decided to sell her company. She called John Paterson of Dateline and offered Com-Pat to him, if her would agree to pay all of the company's debts as part of the purchase.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Seeing that this was a way to monopolize the computer dating market in the UK by doing away with Dateline's only major competitor, Patterson quickly agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://logicmag.io/02-the-mother-of-all-swipes/|title=The Mother of All Swipes|date=2017-09-18|work=Logic Magazine|access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==
After a series of personal difficulties, Ball converted to Buddhism and began to come to terms with her illnesses and setbacks. Ball found herself with many regrets and came to the conclusion that she had locked herself away in her own emotional dungeon even though she had run a company focused on making new emotional connections between other people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Impact and importance in the history of technology ==

Ball was a successful entrepreneur who was the first person of any gender to run a commercially viable [[Computer dating|computer dating service]] in either the UK or the USA.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her company predated Harvard's "[[Operation Match]]" by a year and preceded the other major British computer dating company, [[Dateline]] (run by [[John Richard Patterson|John Patterson]]). Com-Pat operated under Ball's management for nearly a decade, until she was eventually bought out by Dateline in 1974.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ball's experience shows that, contrary to popular narratives on the web, women were in fact early pioneers in the field of computer [[dating]] and [[social networking]] by computer. The fact that Ball has remained mostly unknown until now also reflects how [[Gender stereotypes|gendered stereotypes]] have resulted in the historical submersion of [[Women in computing|women's contributions in computing]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Janet Abbate]], a historian of computing and professor at Virginia Tech, theorized in her book [[Recoding Gender]]--a history of women in computing—that "women who did make significant contributions were not always inclined, by temperament or socialization, to trumpet their accomplishments".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Recoding Gender|last=Abbate|first=Janet|publisher=MIT Press|year=2012|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/recoding-gender}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians Nathan Ensmenger&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Computer Boys Take Over|last=Ensmenger|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Marie Hicks (historian)|Marie Hicks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Programmed Inequality: How Britain Discarded Women Technologists and Lost Its Edge in Computing|last=Hicks|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Margot Lee Shetterly]], and [[Jennifer S. Light|Jennifer Light]] have all shown, in their scholarship on gender in the history of computing, how structural inequality in both the present and the past has altered our view of historical reality when it comes to computing. The existence of these social dynamics in both the past and present has left many parts of computing history untold. Currently, historians are beginning to correct these oversights and to show how women like Joan Ball were important in the history of [[computer dating]], and [[computing]] more generally.

'''Media Standard Print''' is a publication of the Bundesverband Druck und Medien (bvdm, German Printing and Media Industries Federation, [[Berlin]]), available on its website. The standard contains instructions on how to produce data and proofs that are to be sent to a printer. It is based on ProcessStandard Offset and therefore on the [[ISO|ISO Standards]] [[ISO 12647]] and [[ISO 15930]]. As such, it serves as the foundation for smooth cooperation between customer, [[prepress]] service provider and [[Printer (publishing)|printer]] during media production, covering [[Content format|data formats]], [[Color space|colour formats]], printing conditions, [[workflow]]s, means of proofing, standards, black composition and much more.

Only those printing conditions adopted in ISO 12647-2 to -6 are permitted. In terms of data formats, only PDF files (ideally [[PDF/X|PDF/X-4 or PDF/X-1a]]) and [[TIFF]]s should be used for the delivery of individual images. Open files should be avoided. [[ICC profile]]s and the reference printing condition must be embedded with media neutral data or made available to the recipient.

A Media Standard Print conforming [[Prepress proofing|contract proof]] must contain the FOGRA media wedge, the measurement record, the colour profiles used, the time and date of the proof. The print of the media wedge should be measured. Colour measurement should be carried out in accordance with [[ISO 13655|ISO 13655:2009]] in measurement mode M1 on a white backing and the visual evaluation of the proof including its comparison with printed copies should be under a standard illuminant in accordance with [[ISO 3664|ISO 3664:2009]] (confirmed 2015).

Media Standard Print proposes three possible workflows: a 'media neutral' one, a 'media specific' one and a 'classic media specific' one. The media neutral workflow ([[RGB color model|RGB colours]], [[Lab color space#CIELAB|Lab colours]] and so on; PDF/X-4) offers advantages if it has not yet been decided what press will be used for printing, allowing the black composition to be adjusted. The disadvantage of the ‘media neutral’ workflow is a degree of rendering uncertainty, since the gamut mapping should be carried out using the unstandardized perceptual [[Color management#Rendering intent|Rendering intent]]. However, in practice this has turned out to be of little relevance. The media specific workflow ([[CMYK color model|CMYK]] and spot colours; PDF/X-1a) offers a degree of production security, especially against unexpected conversions (RGB black in [[Vector graphics|vector elements]] to CMYK deep black). Experts do not currently agree over which variant to prefer. As experience is gained, the majority of users are opting for the media neutral workflow, which entails considerably less effort during the design process. What remains to be seen is how fast this switch will take place.

== Important changes in the 2016 edition ==
The eighth German edition was published in August 2016 and supersedes the 2010 edition. Media Standard Print 2016 – the English translation of the new German edition – was published in February 2017. Inter alia, it covers the switch to the new standard printing conditions for offset printing that were defined in 2013 and that for the first time take the effect of [[optical brightener]]s into account and so improve production quality. It therefore lists old printing conditions or ones that are valid for the time being in parallel with the new ones. Part 7 ([[Prepress proofing|Proofs]]) of the ISO 12647 standard is treated in greater detail than previously and in October 2016 use of the [[Color difference#CIEDE2000|CIEDE2000 colour difference formula]] was made obligatory for proofs. The change in colour difference formula, which offers a better description of the visual uniformity of the [[Color space|colour space]], also changes the previous figures for aim values and [[Engineering tolerance|tolerances]]. However, in practice, the room for manoeuvre remains largely the same.

The description of the standard printing conditions for the various printing methods of [[Offset printing|offset]], [[Printing#Gravure|gravure]], [[Flexography|flexo]], [[Offset printing#Coldset web offset|newspaper]] and [[Screen printing|screen]] has been expanded through the addition of five typical [[digital printing]] applications.

Furthermore, Media Standard Print refers to [[ISO 15937]] and this is the first such reference to a standard that covers the key values for paper-based substrates. The standardized listing and communication of paper parameters had been neglected for many years but the standard adopted in 2014 should now be disseminated more widely and become indispensable for professional communication in printed product planning.

Media Standard print is also being produced in a new format. In response to the current prevalence of [[Mobile device|mobile end devices]] the 78 page PDF document has been produced in [[Page orientation|landscape format]] in order to fit [[Computer monitor|display screens]], whilst internal [[Hyperlink|hypertext links]] simplify navigation through the document. References to the corresponding chapter of ProcessStandard Offset or its revision published in July 2016 direct the reader to more detailed information.

Media Standard Print 2016 is the first English language translation of the German Medienstandard Druck since 2006. Regrettably, the bvdm is not planning to publish an English translation of the German edition of Process Standard Offset 2012/2016, which is recognized beyond the borders of Germany and Europe. This makes the English language edition of Media Standard Print 2016 all the more important for technical communication, since it refers to the same ISO Standards.

== Additions in the 2018 edition ==
The 2018 edition (substituted the 2016 edition in March, 2018) promptly responds to changes in the ongoing standardization process. For the first time, standards and means for special colour and multi-colour applications are described.

Specifically, the following additions have been made:
* New [[European Color Initiative]] (ECI) working colour space (i.e. the eciCMYK [[CMYK]] exchange [[colour space]])
* SCTV Tone value (increase) curves]] for [[spot colour|spot colours]] in accordance with [[ISO 20654]]
* CxF/X-4 generation and exchange of spot colour data in accordance with [[ISO 17972]]
* Separate 6-B [[Offset_printing#Web-fed_offset|standard printing condition]] with the PSO [[Calender#Supercalender|SC-B paper]] v3 (FOGRA54) ECI profile
* New ECI-PSR profiles for [[Rotogravure|publication gravure]]
* [[PDF/X]] for variable digital print content in accordance with ISO 16612-2 [[PDF/VT]] and ISO 16613-1 [[PDF/VCR]]-1
* Fogra MultiColor MediaWedge
* New values for the white measurement backing and more precise M0 and M1 measurement modes in accordance with the 2017 revision of [[ISO 13655]]:2009, because [[optical brightener]]s are calling for defined [[Electromagnetic radiation#Ultraviolet|UV-portions]] in lighting and measuring during high quality production processes

'''Milène Guermont''' (born 1981 in France) is an artist.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Zawisza,  "The revenge of the female sculptors" [http://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2013/09/26/la-revanche-des-sculptrices_3485498_3246.html], ''LE MONDE,'' 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

She has diplomas in both art and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Florian Loisy, "Milène Guermont, the artist of the concrete for Nuit Blanche", ''LE PARISIEN'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt; To materialize her ideas, she has developed several innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Milène Guermont has different patents and received the OSEO EMERGENCES PRIZE from the Ministry of Superior Research and Industry of France in 2009 [http://cache.media.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/file/2009/46/1/5-97Emergence_62461.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Camille Larher, "Milène immortalizes the sand of Utah beach" [http://www.ouest-france.fr/normandie/milene-immortalise-le-sable-dutah-beach-1997300], ''OUEST FRANCE'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1970 survey, ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested a consensus definition of a minicomputer as a machine costing less than {{USD|25000}} ({{Inflation|US|25000|1970|fmt=eq|r=-3}}), with an input-output device such as a teleprinter and at least four thousand words of memory, that is capable of running programs in a higher level language, such as [[Fortran]] or [[BASIC]].&lt;ref name="Smith 1970"&gt;{{cite news | title=Maxi Computers Face Mini Conflict: Mini Trend Reaching Computers | last=Smith |first=William D. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 5, 1970|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/05/archives/maxi-computers-face-mini-conflict-mini-trend-reaching-computers.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The class formed a distinct group with its own software architectures and operating systems. Minis were designed for control, instrumentation, human interaction, and communication switching as distinct from calculation and record keeping. Many were sold indirectly to [[original equipment manufacturer]]s (OEMs) for final end use application. During the two decade lifetime of the minicomputer class (1965–1985), almost 100 companies formed and only a half dozen remained.&lt;ref name="Bell 2013"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bell|first1=Gordon|authorlink1=Gordon Bell|title=Rise and Fall of Minicomputers|url=http://ethw.org/STARS:Rise_and_Fall_of_Minicomputers#Introduction|website=Engineering and Technology History Wiki|accessdate=28 January 2017|language=en|date=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When single-chip [[CPU]] [[microprocessor]]s appeared, beginning with the [[Intel 4004]] in 1971, the term "minicomputer" came to mean a machine that lies in the middle range of the computing spectrum, in between the smallest [[mainframe computer]]s and the [[microcomputer]]s. The term "minicomputer" is little used today; the contemporary term for this class of system is "[[midrange computer]]", such as the higher-end [[SPARC]], [[Power Architecture]] and [[Itanium]]-based systems from [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[IBM]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]].

=== 1960s: the first minicomputers arrive ===
&lt;!--- Left this in since the edit might be disputed
The first minicomputer was created in the USSR in 1958–1962. The computer, designated UM-1NKh, was produced at the Leningrad Electromechanical Plant (LEMZ) from 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Magazine: Control Electronics, 1966, vol. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malinovsky|first=Boris|title=История вычислительной техники в лицах|trans-title=Pioneers of Soviet Computing|year=1995|pages=300–305|chapter=6.

The definition of minicomputer is vague with the consequence that there are a number of candidates for the ''first'' minicomputer.&lt;ref&gt;Ranging from the CDC 160 circa 1960 to the DEC PDP 8 circa 1965{{cite web

|accessdate=24 January 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  An early and highly successful minicomputer was [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s (DEC) 12-bit [[PDP-8]], which was built using discrete transistors and cost from {{nowrap|[[United States dollar|US$]]16,000}} upwards when launched in 1964. Later versions of the PDP-8 took advantage of small-scale [[integrated circuit]]s. The important precursors of the PDP-8 include the [[PDP-5]], [[LINC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The LINC: An Early "Personal Computer" |work=DrDobbs.com
|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/the-linc-an-early-personal-computer/184404067}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[TX-0]], the [[TX-2]], and the [[PDP-1]]. DEC gave rise to a number of minicomputer companies along [[Massachusetts Route 128]], including [[Data General]], [[Wang Laboratories]], [[Apollo Computer]], and [[Prime Computer]].

Minicomputers were also known as midrange computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-is-the-difference-between-a-microcomputer-a-minicomputer
|title=What Is the Difference Between a Microcomputer &amp; a Minicomputer}}&lt;/ref&gt; They grew to have relatively high processing power and capacity. They were used in manufacturing process control, telephone switching and to control laboratory equipment. In the 1970s, they were the hardware that was used to launch the [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www6.dict.cc/wp_examples.php?lp_id=1%26lang=en%26s=computer%2520aided%2520design |title=Computer-aided design}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other similar industries where a smaller dedicated system was needed.

The [[7400 series]] of [[transistor-transistor logic|TTL]] [[integrated circuit]]s started appearing in minicomputers in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.radio-electronics.com/info/data/semicond/logic-ic-families-technologies/7400-series-ttl.php |title=7400 Series TTL
|website=Radio-Electronics.Com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[74181]] [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU) was commonly used in the [[central processing unit|CPU]] data paths. Each 74181 had a bus width of four bits, hence the popularity of ''bit-slice'' architecture. Some scientific computers, such as the [[Nicolet 1080]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.versci.com/pdffiles/nic80um.pdf |title=Nicolette 1080 Series, Data Acquisition and Processing System, Description and Specifications |access-date=May 28, 2016 |author=Nicolette Instruments Corporation |date=February 1, 1972 |publisher= |language=english |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; would use the 7400 series in groups of five ICs (parallel) for their uncommon twenty bits architecture. The 7400 series offered data-selectors, [[multiplexer]]s, three-state buffers, memories, etc. in [[dual in-line package]]s with one-tenth inch spacing, making major system components and architecture evident to the naked eye. Starting in the 1980s, many minicomputers used [[VLSI]] circuits.

At the launch of the [[MITS Altair 8800]] in 1975, ''[[Radio Electronics]]'' magazine referred to the system as a "minicomputer", although the term [[microcomputer]] soon became usual for personal computers based on single-chip [[microprocessor]]s. At the time, microcomputers were 8-bit single-user, relatively simple machines running simple program-launcher operating systems like [[CP/M]] or [[MS-DOS]], while minis were much more powerful systems that ran full multi-user, [[multitasking]] operating systems, such as [[OpenVMS|VMS]] and [[Unix]], and although the classical mini was a [[16-bit]] computer, the emerging higher performance [[superminicomputer|supermini]]s were [[32-bit]].

===Mid-1980s, 1990s: The minis give way to the micros===
The decline of the minis happened due to the lower cost of microprocessor-based [[computer hardware|hardware]], the emergence of inexpensive and easily deployable [[local area network]] systems, the emergence of the [[68020]], [[80286]] and the [[80386]] microprocessors, and the desire of end-users to be less reliant on inflexible minicomputer manufacturers and IT departments or "data centers". The result was that minicomputers and [[computer terminal]]s were replaced by networked [[workstation]]s, [[server (computing)|file server]]s and [[IBM PC compatible|PC]]s in some installations, beginning in the latter half of the 1980s.

During the 1990s, the change from minicomputers to inexpensive PC networks was cemented by the development of several versions of [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems that ran on the [[Intel]] [[x86]] microprocessor [[computer architecture|architecture]], including [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]] and [[OpenBSD]]. Also, the Microsoft Windows series of operating systems, beginning with [Windows NT], now included server versions that supported [[Preemption_(computing)#Preemptive_multitasking|preemptive multitasking]] and other features required for servers.

As [[microprocessor]]s have become more powerful, the [[central processing unit|CPUs]] built up from multiple components&amp;nbsp;– once the distinguishing feature differentiating mainframes and midrange systems from microcomputers&amp;nbsp;– have become increasingly obsolete, even in the largest [[mainframe computer]]s.

[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) was once the leading minicomputer manufacturer, at one time the second-largest computer company after [[IBM]]. But as the minicomputer declined in the face of generic Unix servers and Intel-based PCs, not only DEC, but almost every other minicomputer company including [[Data General]], [[Prime Computer|Prime]], [[Computervision]], [[Honeywell]] and [[Wang Laboratories]], many based in [[New England]] (hence the end of the [[Massachusetts Miracle]]), also collapsed or merged. DEC was sold to [[Compaq]] in 1998, while Data General was acquired by [[EMC Corporation]].

Today only a few proprietary minicomputer architectures survive. The [[IBM System/38]] operating system, which introduced many advanced concepts, lives on with IBM's AS/400.  Realising the importance of the myriad lines of 'legacy code' (programs) written, 'AS' stands for 'Application System'.  Great efforts were made by IBM to enable programs originally written for the [[IBM System/34|System/34]] and System/36 to be moved to the AS/400. The AS/400 was replaced by the [[iSeries]], which was subsequently replaced by the System i.  In 2008, the System i was replaced by the [[IBM Power Systems]]. By contrast, competing proprietary computing architectures from the early 1980s, such as DEC's [[VAX]], [[Wang VS]] and Hewlett Packard's [[HP3000]] have long been discontinued without a compatible upgrade path. [[OpenVMS]] runs HP Alpha and Intel IA64 ([[Itanium]]) CPU architectures.

[[Tandem Computers]], which specialized in reliable large-scale computing, was acquired by [[Compaq]], and a few years afterward the combined entity merged with [[Hewlett Packard]]. The NSK-based [[NonStop]] product line was re-ported from MIPS processors to Itanium-based processors branded as '[[HP Integrity]] NonStop Servers'. As in the earlier migration from stack machines to MIPS microprocessors, all customer software was carried forward without source changes. Integrity NonStop continues to be HP's answer for the extreme scaling needs of its very largest customers.  The NSK operating system, now termed [[NonStop OS]], continues as the base software environment for the NonStop Servers, and has been extended to include support for [[Java (Sun)|Java]] and integration with popular development tools like [[Microsoft Visual Studio|Visual Studio]] and [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]].

===The minicomputer's industrial impact and heritage===
A variety of companies emerged that built [[turnkey]] systems around minicomputers with specialized software and, in many cases, custom peripherals that addressed specialized problems such as [[computer-aided design]], [[computer-aided manufacturing]], [[process control]], [[manufacturing resource planning]], and so on. Many if not most minicomputers were sold through these [[original equipment manufacturer]]s and [[value-added reseller]]s.

Several pioneering computer companies first built minicomputers, such as [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]], [[Data General]], and [[Hewlett-Packard|Hewlett-Packard (HP)]] (who now refers to its [[HP3000]] minicomputers as "servers" rather than "minicomputers"). And although today's PCs and servers are clearly microcomputers physically, architecturally their CPUs and operating systems have developed largely by integrating features from minicomputers.{{citation_needed|date=January 2016}}

In the software context, the relatively simple OSs for early microcomputers were usually inspired by minicomputer OSs (such as [[CP/M]]'s similarity to Digital's single user [[OS/8]] and [[RT-11]] and multi-user [[RSTS/E|RSTS]] time-sharing system). Also, the multiuser OSs of today are often either inspired by, or directly descended from, minicomputer OSs.{{citation_needed|date=January 2016}} [[Unix|UNIX]] was originally a minicomputer OS, while [[Architecture of Windows NT|Windows NT kernel]]&lt;!-- namely the kernel, not a huge heap of M$ usermode crap --&gt;—the foundation for all current versions of [[Microsoft Windows]]-borrowed design ideas liberally from [[OpenVMS|VMS]]. Many of the first generation of PC programmers were educated on minicomputer systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Mining archaeology is a specific field well-developed in the [[British Isles]] during recent decades. A reason of ongoing interest in this field is the particular bond between regional history and the exploitation of metals. References to mines in the area exist in [[Strabo]]'s works. However the first accomplished study on the topic was attempted by Oliver Davies in 1935. Other momentous researches were that of geologist [[John S. Jackson]] about mines in Ireland and Lewis, Jones in [[Dolaucothi]] goldmine in [[Wales]], and the pioneering work of [[Ronald F. Tylecote]]. Moreover, in the 1980s and 1990s a new generation of amateurs and scientists began investigations in different locations in the British Isles, including Duncan James on the [[Great Orme]]'s Head, Simon Timberlake with the Early Mines Research Group at sites in Wales and William O'Brien in Ireland.

== Prehistoric Period ==

[[Image:hammerstones by Roeder.jpg|Hammerstones|thumb]]
Signs of [[Bronze Age]] metal extraction have been identified from several locations in the British Isles; this has been certified with carbon-14 analysis. Oliver Davies has accomplished the most intensive archaeological investigation in central Wales at [[Cwmystwyth]]. The first investigation conducted in 1935, however in 1986 a group of scientists instituted the Early Mines Research Group and reinvestigate the Copa Hill region including Cwmystwyth.&lt;ref&gt;Timberlake 2003a, 24&lt;/ref&gt; Even though lead deposits are the main concentration the first metal extracted in the area was copper. The main lead lode is at "Comet lode" where a large opencast was excavated. At the walls of the opencast, revealed entrances of tunnels, which were constructed to follow smaller veins. At one of them, a wooden "pipe" was found. Moreover, in the same area a considerable amount of dump was exposed including stone hammers and lead ores. Charcoal samples from the site give several different dates from 2000–1900 BC to 1400 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Graddock 1995; O'Brien 1996; Timberlake 1990a; Timberlake 2003a; Timberlake 2003b&lt;/ref&gt;

Other two significant sites are Parys Mountain and Nantyreira mine located in mid-Wales. Copper was the reason for their early exploitation even if Nantyreira's main lode contained predominantly lead ores. S.Timberlake and the Early Mines Research Group in 1986 explored them. The excavations had as a result the discovery of dump in both sites. Charcoal and stonehammers were found inside the tip. The [[C14 dating|C14]] samples place both areas at the [[Early Bronze Age]] 2000–1500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien 1996; Timberlake 1990b; Timberlake 2003b&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Orme mine exploitation, on the North Wales coast began in the Bronze Age and continued until the nineteenth century. According to remains, mine workings have been traced in the Bryniau, Poethion and Pyllau valley. The [[dolomitised]] limestone deposits are rich in copper which early miners must extract mostly by [[malachite]]. Because of ground composition, the extraction was sufficiently easy, this explains also the scale of the operations.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan 1990; Graddock 1995 ,60–61; Lewis 1990,5;O'Brien 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1976 Duncan James revealed in Great Orme a shaft which included a firesetting in connection with stone hammers, bone tools and rock dump. The deposit was placed by radiocarbon-dating to 1395–935 BC. Andy Lewis continued the research in the area at the late 1980s. It is believed that the operations in the location ended shortly after 1000 BC.
Extractions techniques with visible remains are the opencasts at the surface and group of shafts and caverns underground. The underground complex system was accessible by many different openings which simultaneously used as a ventilation system for the tunnels. The tools in the site constitute mainly by pointed bone tools and stonehammers. Other stone tools revealed at the locations were stone mortars and pestles, which indicate another stage in the ores exploitation. Moreover, a unique find for British Isles were the giant hammers.&lt;ref&gt;Graddock 1995, 60–61; James 1988, 115–121; O'Brien 1996, 19,24–25, 49–51&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for early quarrying was also discovered in [[Alderley Edge]] though industrial operations in the 19th century destroyed a big part of the earlier deposits.&lt;ref&gt;The Institute of Metals 1991, pg13; Timberlake and Prag 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Ireland also has many areas related with mining activities from the prehistoric period (O'Brien 2003). However, the two important mines are Mount Gabriel and Ross Island mines.
Ross Island lies near Killarney. Inside its area they have been exposed two primitive mines. O'Brien excavate "Danish mines" and revealed a mine cave and a huge spoil concentration nearby thus after the excavation of the latter, another unknown mine also appeared. Furthermore, he investigates pits and dips in the bedrock, which also considered primitive. The feature that differentiates this site is the discovery of a Beaker settlement very close with metallurgical pits, hammers and rock waste. This finds in combination with an early phase in 2400 BC makes the site and the settlement very important for mining Archaeology in the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien 1996; O'Brien et al. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Mount Gabriel located close to west Cork provides useful evidence for the exploitation of copper ore in the Early Bronze Age about 1700 BC. Through research thirty-two areas of activity were underlined. Shallow concaves and significant amount of dump with charcoal and tools are the evidences of Bronze Age copper extraction in the region. Mount Gabriel constitute until now the only locations, where primitive assemblages remained undisturbed by 19th century deeds due to the low quality of its veins.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien 1994; O'Brien 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

With the beginning of the Iron Age about 700 BC operations associated with ore exploitations spread around the British Isles. A representative example of the period are [[Puzzlewood]]'s surface mines. The site prospered especially in the Romano-British period and the late Middle Ages. The [[limonite]] ores represent a small part of the local Carboniferous Limestone. The archaeological remains of mining which can be detected in the area are opencasts, known as Scowles Holes. It's important to underline the discovery of habitations areas in close proximity, dated around 100–400 AD.&lt;ref&gt;The Institute of Metals 1991, 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roman Period ==

During the [[Roman Britain|Roman period]] massive veins exploitation took part in the Mendips and Dolaucothi . Further metallic lead pigs originate from [[Peak District]] in Derbyshire has been discovered but the exact position of the mines remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd 1980,219; The Institute of Metals 1991, 14; Tylecote 1964, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that the Mendip sources were already exploited in Late Bronze Age and some evidence earthworks are associated with [[British Iron Age]] activity, but the peak of production is linked with Roman era. Even if we do not have many actual evidences about the mines, through the examination of the archaeological sites in the area is known to us that the [[Charterhouse Roman Town]] were guarded by a fort and similar conditions may occurred in Green mines also at least for a period.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis 1992, 32; Tylecote 1964,26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dolaucothi===
[[File:Aqueduct1.jpg|thumb|left|The aqueducts at Dolaucothi]]
Though the most acquainted site is the [[Dolaucothi]] Gold Mines near [[Pumpsaint]] in Wales. The gold mines were investigated by Jones and Lewis in 1969. The mines were in use until nowadays and their utilisation is obvious towards the surface of the site but also underground.  The Roman presence in the area is dated from the beginning of their establishment in Great Britain and for a period of 300 years. The remains of mine workings former than 19th century are concentrated in five areas Ogofau, Niagara, Allt Cwmhenog, Pen-lan-wen and Cwrt-y-Cillion trenches. Furthermore, in the Ogofau region a number of pits came to light. Despite the concentrations of dump and posterior workings the opencasts of Roman period are visible and well preserved. The main one had preserved a depth of 24 metres at least other two opencasts are dated in the same period the co-called "Roman pit" and the "Mitchell pit". Likewise a second location with possible Roman dated exploration is Pen-lan-wen where a group of [[adit]]s was found, traces of chisels and picks were obvious at the surfaces of the ambit's walls but the evidence are tenuous.&lt;ref&gt;The Institute of Metals 1991, 38–40; Shepherd 1980, 218&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dolaucothimap2.jpg|thumb|Map of the gold mine]] Undoubtedly the most striking feature of Dolaucothi mines is the constructions linked with [[hushing]]. Through the excavations by Lewis and Jones four main [[leat]]s, a complex group of tanks and reservoirs were revealed in different areas either in direct vicinity with the mines or nearby water sources. Another crucial discovery was the fragment of a "drainage wheel", suggesting the existence of an underground wheel system similar to the well-known system of [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;The Institute of Metals 1991, 38–40; Graddock 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medieval Period ==

The [[Middle Ages]] was a flourishing period for the exploitations of metal in general, a prime mover for this was the inference of monasteries in extraction of minerals.&lt;ref&gt;Gerrard 2000; The Institute of Metals 1991; O'Brien 2004&lt;/ref&gt; A famous archaeological site of this period is the northern [[Pennines]] at [[Brownhill]], Cumbria, where lead ores were extracted from argentiferous lopes. The mine was under the jurisdiction of the Crown. The lead ores were obtained by opencasts that took a semi-ellipsoid shape thus they called "bell-pits". Evidences of medieval exploitation are preserved also at Copa hill were small parts of a leat system came to light. Further Ross Island excavations displayed a smelting site connected with a settlement nearby the local mines but the contemporary workings are untraceable. As far as tin industry concerns "lode back pits" at Godolphin have identified as medieval.

== The contribution of other fields in Mining Archaeology ==

To shape an overall image for mines in antiquity we have to consider in mind many different factors not only the architectural remains. Social context is one of these factors. The term includes the social status of the miners, their way of life, the relationships with adjoined communities due to archaeological record, the symbolic value of the ore which was reflected also at the finished objects and in general to recreate the past society in which these operations took part. Yet in collaboration with [[experimental archaeology]] important observations have occur as far as primitive techniques of extraction and their traceable residues or ways in which mining tools were used their properties and the distinctive marks of their usages. Moreover, scientific analytical methods can submit important data about chemical composition of minerals, slag and artefacts allowing archaeologists to build correlations or identify provenance. Further the science of geology and pollen analysis can give us an image of landscape per eras.  Finally documents and inscriptions as well offer valuable help for the historical periods.&lt;ref&gt;Craddock 1990; Grabbock 1990; Graw 1990; Hall 1990; Henderson 2000; Pinckin 1990; Richardson 1974; Timberlake 1990c; Topping and Lynott 2005; Tuck and Topping 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OpenLearn''' is an [[educational website]]. It is the [[UK]]'s [[Open University]]'s contribution to the [[Open educational resources]] (OER) project and the home of free, open learning from The Open University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/jul/04/open-educational-resources-and-economic-growth|title=Are open educational resources the key to global economic growth?|last1=Daniel|first1=John|last2=Killion|first2=David|date=4 July 2012|work=The Guardian|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original project was part-funded by the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn/about-us/our-story.php "Our story – How OpenLearn started"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014081930/http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn/about-us/our-story.php |date=14 October 2007 }} – Open University&lt;/ref&gt;

OpenLearn is a member of the [[OpenCourseWare|OpenCourseWare Consortium]] (OCWC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oeconsortium.org/members/ Open Education Consortium Members]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
OpenLearn dates back to 1999, when [[Open2.net]], an Open University-[[BBC]] collaboration, gave a first home to free learning resources that the public could interact with without the need to sign up to study a university course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Looking For Open2.net?|url=http://www.open.edu/openlearn/about-openlearn/frequently-asked-questions/looking-open2net|website=OpenLearn|publisher=The Open University|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The OpenLearn team|url=http://www.open.edu/openlearn/profiles/ld3623|website=OpenLearn|publisher=The Open University|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Open University launched the OpenLearn brand with the LearningSpace website in October 2006 to provide free access to extracts of educational materials generated as part of course production. The publication of such structured learning materials, designed for [[distance education]], is unique in the field of [[open educational resources]].

LearningSpace and Open2.net came together under the same OpenLearn brand in 2010, creating a single home for all free learning from The Open University.

It also aggregates videos and audio made available via other Open University channels, such as iTunesU, YouTube and AudioBoo.

Since 2014, it has also been republishing The Open University's courses from [[FutureLearn]], providing a space where learners unwilling or unable to commit to FutureLearn's weekly learning model can follow courses to their own timetable.

==Fundamentals of the program==
Open Education materials make three contributions. They make new knowledge available to all (not just the few who can pay for it). They allow users to download, modify, translate and adapt to their culture to the material to enhance its usefulness. They provide the opportunity for people to work together to co-modify, co-produce, test and co-produce again, retesting derivative material which generates a cycle of rapid continuous improvement. Using technology Open Educational Resources aim to remove access barriers to knowledge and educational opportunities around the world.

Through the [[Moodle]]-based virtual learning environment, learners are offered over 600 structured media-rich study units, supported by a number of learning and communication tools in the Free Courses area. Personal profiles, learning journals and rating options empower learners to become self publishers and reviewers, tagging their entries to provide a means by which others can find and connect with their ideas. Knowledge mapping software enables learners to visually represent resources and the links between them, to construct arguments and frame [[debate]]s. By publishing their work online, they share their own pathways through the material with other visitors to the website.

The OpenLearn website also provides a standalone experience for the learner, but is also one that can be taken apart and remixed to take on a new form. The [[Web 2.0]] approach to an open and collaborative LearningSpace primarily for learners, is complemented by OpenLearn Create(formerly Labspace and OpenLearnWorks), an area for experimentation, where educational practitioners are encouraged to download, amend and adapt both current and archived course materials. Published under an Attribution-ShareAlike-NonCommercial Creative Commons license, the Open University media-rich materials can be reused in alternative educational settings, repurposed for a local context, translated and built upon to form a larger open repository of derivative educational materials. Collaborators are encouraged to form their own areas within the LabSpace to personalise the materials, increasing the relevance of the content for specific learning communities and to test out course ideas and develop materials based on user feedback.

==Viral content==
OpenLearn enables viral content not just through its licensing model, but also through a commitment to open technologies. The use of an open source virtual learning environment, along with the ability for people to download and upload materials in various formats (from an [[RSS]] to a print to an IMS Common Cartridge) encourages replication of the content and enables interoperability with other provider's content management systems. Innovators have already re-published OpenLearn materials in new environments by implementing a variety of freely available technologies. The materials have been replicated in offline desktop libraries to provide access for remote communities around the world. RSS feeds enable the content to be easily embedded in web based widgets and RSS readers, allowing the engagement with the content to happen away from OpenLearn.

==OpenLearn Create==
By the end of the first phase of funding (30 April 2008), OpenLearn hosted more than five thousand hours of core OU materials and additional user generated content in the LabSpace area of the site.

In 2012, the LabSpace area was overhauled to give a better user experience and a tighter focus on collaboration with partners. The area was rebranded OpenLearn Works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.open.edu/openlearnworks/|website=OpenLearn Works|title=OpenLearnWorks|publisher=The Open University|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site has since been further developed and redesigned, changing its name to OpenLearn Create in 2017. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/about/open-educational-resources/openlearn-create|title=OpenLearnCreate|publisher=The Open University|accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Open Mobile Terminal Platform''' ('''OMTP''') was a forum created by mobile network operators to discuss standards with manufacturers of [[mobile phones]] and other mobile devices.  During its lifetime, the OMTP included manufacturers such as [[Huawei]], [[LG Electronics]], [[Motorola]], [[Nokia]], [[Samsung]] and [[Sony Ericsson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com/2100-1041_3-6209247.html |title=Pros seem to outdo cons in new phone charger standard |publisher=news.com |date=September 20, 2007 |accessdate=November 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
OMTP was originally set up by leading mobile operators.  At the time it transitioned into the [[Wholesale Applications Community]] at the end of June 2010, there were nine full members: [[AT&amp;T Mobility|AT&amp;T]], [[Deutsche Telekom AG]], [[KT (telecommunication company)|KT]], [[Orange SA|Orange]], [[Smart Communications]], [[Telecom Italia]], [[Telefónica]], [[Telenor]] and [[Vodafone]]. OMTP also had the support of two sponsors, [[Ericsson]] and [[Nokia]].

==Activities==
OMTP recommendations have hugely helped to standardise mobile operator terminal requirements, and its work has gone towards helping to defragment and deoptionalise operators' recommendations. OMTP’s focus was on gathering and driving mobile terminal requirements, and publishing their findings in their Recommendations. OMTP was technology neutral, with its recommendations intended for deployment across the range of technology platforms, operating systems (OS) and middleware layers.

OMTP is perhaps best known for its work in the field of mobile security, but its work encompassed the full range of mobile device capabilities. OMTP published recommendations in 2007 and early 2008 on areas such as Positioning Enablers, Advanced Device Management, IMS and Mobile VoIP. Later, the Advanced Trusted Environment: OMTP TR1 and its supporting document, 'Security Threats on Embedded Consumer Devices'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsma.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/omtpsecuritythreatsonembeddedconsumerdevicesv11.pdf OMTP Security Threats on Embedded Consumer Devices] at gsma.com&lt;/ref&gt; were released, with the endorsement of the UK Home Secretary, [[Jacqui Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telecoms.com/9012/crime-fighters-welcome-mobile-security-requirements |title=Crime fighters welcome mobile security requirements |publisher=telecoms.com |date=May 22, 2008 |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OMTP also published requirements document addressing support for advanced [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM]] cards. This document defines also advanced profiles for Smart Card Web Server, High Speed Protocol, Mobile TV and Contactless.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsma.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/omtpuiccusimv20.pdf OMTP UICC v2.0] at gsma.com&lt;/ref&gt;

OMTP has also made significant progress in getting support for the use of [[micro-USB]] as a standard connector for data and power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsma.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/omtplocaldataconnectivityv10.pdf OMTP Local Data Connectivity] at gsma.com&lt;/ref&gt; A full list of their recommendations can be found at http://www.gsma.com/newsroom/technical-documents/omtp-documents/

===BONDI===
In 2008, OMTP launched a new initiative called [[BONDI (OMTP)|BONDI]] (named after [[Bondi Beach, New South Wales|the Australian beach]]); the initiative defined new interfaces ([[Javascript]] APIs) and a security framework (based on [[XACML]] policy description) to enable the access to mobile phone functionalities (Application Invocation, Application Settings, Camera, Communications Log, Gallery, Location, Messaging, Persistent Data, Personal Information, Phone Status, User Interaction) from browser and widget engine in a secure way. The [[BONDI (OMTP)|BONDI]] initiative also had an open source Reference Implementation at https://web.archive.org/web/20130509121758/https://web.archive.org/web/20130509121758/http://bondi.omtp.org//. An Approved Release 1.0 of BONDI was issued in June 2009.
An open source project for a comprehensive BONDI SDK was started at http://bondisdk.org.

===Universal Charging System===
In February 2009, OMTP expanded its Local Connectivity specification (based on [[micro-USB]]) to describe requirements for a common charger and common connector to enable sharing the same battery charger through different phones. The OMTP Common Charging and Local Data Connectivity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsma.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/omtpcommonchargingandlocaldataconnectivityv1.1.pdf OMTP Common Charging and Local Data Connectivity]&lt;/ref&gt; was adopted by [[GSM Association]] in the Universal Charging System (UCS) initiative. This has been further endorsed by the [[CTIA - The Wireless Association|CTIA]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctia.org/media/press/body.cfm/prid/1817 CTIA–The Wireless Association Announces One Universal Charger Solution to Celebrate Earth Day] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214154849/http://ctia.org/media/press/body.cfm/PRID/1817 |date=2010-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[ITU]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/newsroom/press_releases/2009/49.html|title=Press Release: Universal phone charger standard approved - One-size-fits-all solution will dramatically cut waste and GHG emissions|author=pressinfo|work=itu.int|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, 2009 the [[European Commission]] reached an agreement with several major mobile phone providers on requirements for a [[common External Power Supply]] (EPS) to be compatible with new data-enabled phones sold in the [[European Union]].  The EPS shares most of the key attributes of the UCS charger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/rtte/chargers.htm? |title=Harmonisation of chargers for mobile telephones |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023232430/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/rtte/chargers.htm |archivedate=2009-10-23 |deadurl=yes |work=ec.europa.eu |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/rtte/files/chargers/chargers_annex_ii_to_mou_january_12_2010_en.pdf |title=Annex II, Technical Annex to MoU regarding the Harmonisation of a Charging Capability for Mobile Phones |format=PDF |date=2010-01-12 |accessdate=2011-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128141113/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/rtte/files/chargers/chargers_annex_ii_to_mou_january_12_2010_en.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wholesale Applications Community===
In June 2010, the OMTP transitioned itself into the new Wholesale Applications Community. All OMTP activities ceased at that time and were either taken over within the WAC organisation or other standards or industry associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobileeurope.co.uk/Press-Wire/omtp-announces-final-documents-prior-to-transition-into-wholesale-application-community|title=OMTP announces final documents prior to transition into Wholesale Application Community|author=Keith Dyer|work=mobileeurope.co.uk|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, in July 2012 WAC itself was closed, with the OMTP standards being transferred to [[GSMA]], and other assets and personnel transferring to [[Apigee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/17/wac-whacked-telecom-backed-alliance-merges-into-gsma-assets-acquired-by-api-management-service-apigee/|title=WAC Whacked: Telecom-Backed Alliance Merges Into GSMA, Assets Acquired By API Management Service Apigee|author=Sarah Perez|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''operational amplifier''' (often '''op-amp''' or '''opamp''') is a [[direct coupling|DC-coupled]] high-[[gain (electronics)|gain]] electronic voltage [[electronic amplifier|amplifier]] with a [[differential input]] and, usually, a [[Single-ended signaling|single-ended]] output.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/an_pk/1108 Maxim Application Note 1108: Understanding Single-Ended, Pseudo-Differential and {{Sic|hide=y|Fully|-}}Differential ADC Inputs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626153413/http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/an_pk/1108 |date=2007-06-26 }} – Retrieved November 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In this configuration, an op-amp produces an output potential (relative to circuit ground) that is typically hundreds of thousands of times larger than the potential difference between its input terminals.
Operational amplifiers had their origins in [[analog computers]], where they were used to perform mathematical operations in many linear, non-linear, and frequency-dependent circuits. 

The popularity of the op-amp as a building block in [[analog circuit]]s is due to its versatility. By using [[negative feedback]], the characteristics of an op-amp circuit, its gain, input and [[output impedance]], [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] etc. are determined by external components and have little dependence on [[temperature coefficient]]s or [[engineering tolerance]] in the op-amp itself.

Op-amps are among the most widely used electronic devices today, being used in a vast array of consumer, industrial, and scientific devices. Many standard IC op-amps cost only a few cents in moderate production volume; however, some integrated or hybrid operational amplifiers with special performance specifications may cost over {{Currency|amount=100|code=US}} in small quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apex OP PA98|url=http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/PA98/598-1337-ND/1761961|accessdate=8 November 2015|quote=APEX PA98 Op Amp Modules, Selling Price: $207.51|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101094650/http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/PA98/598-1337-ND/1761961|archivedate=1 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Op-amps may be packaged as components or used as elements of more complex integrated circuits.

The op-amp is one type of [[differential amplifier]]. Other types of differential amplifier include the [[fully differential amplifier]] (similar to the op-amp, but with two outputs), the [[instrumentation amplifier]] (usually built from three op-amps), the [[isolation amplifier]] (similar to the instrumentation amplifier, but with tolerance to [[Common-mode signal|common-mode voltages]] that would destroy an ordinary op-amp), and [[negative-feedback amplifier]] (usually built from one or more op-amps and a resistive feedback network).

==Operation==
[[Image:Op-amp open-loop 1.svg|thumb|An op-amp without negative feedback (a comparator)]]
The amplifier's differential inputs consist of a non-inverting input (+) with voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; and an inverting input (–) with voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt;; ideally the op-amp amplifies only the difference in voltage between the two, which is called the ''differential input voltage''. The output voltage of the op-amp ''V''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; is given by the equation
:&lt;math&gt;V_\text{out} = A_\text{OL} (V_+ - V_-),&lt;/math&gt;
where ''A''&lt;sub&gt;OL&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Electronic feedback loops|open-loop]] gain of the amplifier (the term "open-loop" refers to the absence of a feedback loop from the output to the input).

=== Open-loop amplifier  ===
The magnitude of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;OL&lt;/sub&gt; is typically very  large (100,000 or more for integrated circuit op-amps), and therefore even a quite small difference between ''V''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; drives the amplifier output nearly to the supply voltage. Situations in which the output voltage is equal to or greater than the supply voltage are referred to as ''saturation'' of the amplifier.  The magnitude of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;OL&lt;/sub&gt; is not well controlled by the manufacturing process, and so it is impractical to use an open-loop amplifier as a stand-alone [[differential amplifier]].

Without [[negative feedback amplifier|negative feedback]], and perhaps with [[positive feedback]] for [[Regenerative circuit|regeneration]], an op-amp acts as a [[comparator]]. If the inverting input is held at ground (0&amp;nbsp;V) directly or by a resistor ''R''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;, and the input voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; applied to the non-inverting input is positive, the output will be maximum positive; if ''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; is negative, the output will be maximum negative. Since there is no feedback from the output to either input, this is an ''[[Electronic feedback loops|open-loop]]'' circuit acting as a [[comparator]].

=== Closed-loop amplifier ===
[[Image:Operational amplifier noninverting.svg|thumb|An op-amp with negative feedback (a non-inverting amplifier)]]
If predictable operation is desired, negative feedback is used, by applying a portion of the output voltage to the inverting input. The ''closed-loop'' feedback greatly reduces the gain of the circuit.  When negative feedback is used, the circuit's overall gain and response becomes determined mostly by the feedback network, rather than by the op-amp characteristics. If the feedback network is made of components with values small relative to the op amp's input impedance, the value of the op-amp's open-loop response ''A''&lt;sub&gt;OL&lt;/sub&gt; does not seriously affect the circuit's performance. The response of the op-amp circuit with its input, output, and feedback circuits to an input is characterized mathematically by a [[transfer function]]; designing an op-amp circuit to have a desired transfer function is in the realm of [[electrical engineering]].  The transfer functions are important in most applications of op-amps, such as in [[analog computers]]. High input [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] at the input terminals and low output impedance at the output terminal(s) are particularly useful features of an op-amp.

In the non-inverting amplifier on the right, the presence of negative feedback via the [[voltage divider]] ''R''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; determines the ''closed-loop gain'' ''A''&lt;sub&gt;CL&lt;/sub&gt; = ''V''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;. Equilibrium will be established when ''V''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; is just sufficient to "reach around and pull" the inverting input to the same voltage as ''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;. The voltage gain of the entire circuit is thus 1 + ''R''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;/''R''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;. As a simple example, if ''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; = 1&amp;nbsp;V and R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; = ''R''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; will be 2&amp;nbsp;V, exactly the amount required to keep ''V''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; at 1&amp;nbsp;V. Because of the feedback provided by the ''R''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; network, this is a ''closed-loop'' circuit.

Another way to analyze this circuit proceeds by making the following (usually valid) assumptions:&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Millman, ''Microelectronics: Digital and Analog Circuits and Systems'', McGraw-Hill, 1979, {{ISBN|0-07-042327-X}}, pp. 523–527.&lt;/ref&gt;
* When an op-amp operates in linear (i.e., not saturated) mode, the difference in voltage between the non-inverting (+) pin and the inverting (−) pin is negligibly small.
* The input impedance between (+) and (−) pins is much larger than other resistances in the circuit.

The input signal ''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; appears at both (+) and (−) pins, resulting in a current ''i'' through ''R''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; equal to ''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;/''R''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;i = \frac{V_\text{in}}{R_g}.&lt;/math&gt;
Since Kirchhoff's current law states that the same current must leave a node as enter it, and since the impedance into the (−) pin is near infinity, we can assume practically all of the same current ''i'' flows through ''R''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;, creating an output voltage
: &lt;math&gt;V_\text{out} = V_\text{in} + i \times R_f = V_\text{in} + \left(\frac{V_\text{in}}{R_g} \times R_f\right) = V_\text{in} + \frac{V_\text{in} \times R_f} {R_g} = V_\text{in}  \left(1 + \frac{R_f}{R_g}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
By combining terms, we determine the closed-loop gain ''A''&lt;sub&gt;CL&lt;/sub&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;A_\text{CL} = \frac{V_\text{out}}{V_\text{in}} = 1 + \frac{R_f}{R_g}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Op-amp characteristics==

=== Ideal op-amps ===
[[Image:Op-Amp Internal.svg|thumb|250px|right|An equivalent circuit of an operational amplifier that models some resistive non-ideal parameters.]]

An ideal op-amp is usually considered to have the following characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ti.com.cn/cn/lit/an/slaa068b/slaa068b.pdf |title=Understanding Basic Analog – Ideal Op Amps |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227060510/http://www.ti.com.cn/cn/lit/an/slaa068b/slaa068b.pdf |archivedate=2016-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.cs.tamu.edu/prism/lectures/iss/iss_l5.pdf |title=Lecture 5: The ideal operational amplifier |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123045824/http://research.cs.tamu.edu/prism/lectures/iss/iss_l5.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Infinite [[open-loop gain]] G = ''v''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; / ''v''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;
* Infinite [[input impedance]] R&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;, and so zero input current 
* Zero [[input offset voltage]] 
* Infinite output voltage range
* Infinite [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] with zero [[phase shift]] and infinite [[slew rate]] 
* Zero [[output impedance]] R&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;
* Zero [[Electronic noise|noise]]
* Infinite [[common-mode rejection ratio]] (CMRR)
* Infinite [[power supply rejection ratio]].
 
These ideals can be summarized by the two "golden rules":{{ordered list
| list-style-type=upper-roman
| '''In a closed loop''' the output attempts to do whatever is necessary to make the voltage difference between the inputs zero.
| The inputs draw no current.&lt;ref name=AoE&gt;

}}

The first rule only applies in the usual case where the op-amp is used in a closed-loop design (negative feedback, where there is a signal path of some sort feeding back from the output to the inverting input).  These rules are commonly used as a good first approximation for analyzing or designing op-amp circuits.&lt;ref name="AoE"/&gt;{{rp|177}}

None of these ideals can be perfectly realized. A real op-amp may be modeled with non-infinite or non-zero parameters using equivalent resistors and capacitors in the op-amp model. The designer can then include these effects into the overall performance of the final circuit. Some parameters may turn out to have negligible effect on the final design while others represent actual limitations of the final performance that must be evaluated.

=== Real op-amps ===
Real op-amps differ from the ideal model in various aspects.

====DC imperfections====
Real operational amplifiers suffer from several non-ideal effects:

;Finite gain: [[Open-loop gain]] is infinite in the ideal operational amplifier but finite in real operational amplifiers. Typical devices exhibit open-loop DC gain ranging from 100,000 to over 1 million. So long as the [[loop gain]] (i.e., the product of open-loop and feedback gains) is very large, the circuit gain will be determined entirely by the amount of negative feedback (i.e., it will be independent of open-loop gain). In cases where [[closed-loop gain]] must be very high, the feedback gain will be very low, and the low feedback gain causes low loop gain; in these cases, the operational amplifier will cease to behave ideally.

;Finite [[input impedance]]s : The ''differential input impedance'' of the operational amplifier is defined as the impedance ''between'' its two inputs; the ''common-mode input impedance'' is the impedance from each input to ground.  [[MOSFET]]-input operational amplifiers often have protection circuits that effectively short circuit any input differences greater than a small threshold, so the input impedance can appear to be very low in some tests. However, as long as these operational amplifiers are used in a typical high-gain negative feedback application, these protection circuits will be inactive.  The input bias and leakage currents described below are a more important design parameter for typical operational amplifier applications.

;Non-zero [[output impedance]]: Low output impedance is important for low-impedance loads; for these loads, the voltage drop across the output impedance effectively reduces the open loop gain. In configurations with a voltage-sensing negative feedback, the output impedance of the amplifier is effectively lowered; thus, in linear applications, op-amp circuits usually exhibit a very low output impedance.
:Low-impedance outputs typically require high [[quiescent current|quiescent (i.e., idle) current]] in the output stage and will dissipate more power, so low-power designs may purposely sacrifice low output impedance.

;Input current: Due to [[biasing]] requirements or [[Leakage (semiconductors)|leakage]], a small amount of current (typically ~10 nanoamperes for [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]] op-amps, tens of picoamperes (pA) for [[JFET]] input stages, and only a few pA for [[MOSFET]] input stages) flows into the inputs. When large resistors or sources with high output impedances are used in the circuit, these small currents can produce large unmodeled voltage drops. If the input currents are matched, ''and'' the impedance looking ''out'' of ''both'' inputs are matched, then the voltages produced at each input will be equal. Because the operational amplifier operates on the ''difference'' between its inputs, these matched voltages will have no effect.&lt;!-- (unless the operational amplifier has poor [[Common-mode rejection ratio|CMRR]], which is described below). CMRR is usually much better than matching of currents, so not relevant. --&gt; It is more common for the input currents to be slightly mismatched. The difference is called input offset current, and even with matched resistances a small ''offset voltage'' (different from the input offset voltage below) can be produced. This offset voltage can create offsets or drifting in the operational amplifier.

;Input offset [[voltage]]: This voltage, which is what is required across the op-amp's input terminals to drive the output voltage to zero.&lt;ref&gt;D.F. Stout ''Handbook of Operational Amplifier Circuit Design'' (McGraw-Hill, 1976, {{ISBN|0-07-061797-X}} ) pp.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;This definition hews to the convention of measuring op-amp parameters with respect to the zero voltage point in the circuit, which is usually half the total voltage between the amplifier's positive and negative power rails.&lt;/ref&gt; In the perfect amplifier, there would be no input offset voltage. However, it exists in actual op-amps because of imperfections in the differential amplifier that constitutes the input stage of the vast majority of these devices. Input offset voltage creates two problems: First, due to the amplifier's high voltage gain, it virtually assures that the amplifier output will go into saturation if it is operated without negative feedback, even when the input terminals are wired together. Second, in a closed loop, negative feedback configuration, the input offset voltage is amplified along with the signal and this may pose a problem if high precision DC amplification is required or if the input signal is very small.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Many older designs of operational amplifiers have offset null inputs to allow the offset to be manually adjusted away. Modern precision op-amps can have internal circuits that automatically cancel this offset using [[chopper (electronics)|chopper]]s or other circuits that measure the offset voltage periodically and subtract it from the input voltage.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Common-mode gain: A perfect operational amplifier amplifies only the voltage difference between its two inputs, completely rejecting all voltages that are common to both. However, the differential input stage of an operational amplifier is never perfect, leading to the amplification of these common voltages to some degree. The standard measure of this defect is called the [[common-mode rejection ratio]] (denoted CMRR). Minimization of common mode gain is usually important in non-inverting amplifiers (described below) that operate at high amplification.

;Power-supply rejection: The output of a perfect operational amplifier will be completely independent from its power supply. Every real operational amplifier has a finite [[power supply rejection ratio]] (PSRR) that reflects how well the op-amp can reject changes in its supply voltage.

;Temperature effects: All parameters change with temperature. Temperature drift of the input offset voltage is especially important.

;Drift: Real op-amp parameters are subject to slow change over time and with changes in temperature, input conditions, etc.

====AC imperfections====
The op-amp gain calculated at DC does not apply at higher frequencies. Thus, for high-speed operation, more sophisticated considerations must be used in an op-amp circuit design.

;Finite [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]: All amplifiers have finite bandwidth. To a first approximation, the op-amp has the frequency response of an [[integrator]] with gain. That is, the gain of a typical op-amp is inversely proportional to frequency and is characterized by its [[gain–bandwidth product]]&amp;nbsp;(GBWP). For example, an op-amp with a GBWP of 1&amp;nbsp;MHz would have a gain of 5 at 200&amp;nbsp;kHz, and a gain of 1 at 1&amp;nbsp;MHz. This dynamic response coupled with the very high DC gain of the op-amp gives it the characteristics of a first-order [[low-pass filter]] with very high DC gain and low cutoff frequency given by the GBWP divided by the DC gain.{{paragraph break}}The finite bandwidth of an op-amp can be the source of several problems, including:{{glossary}}{{term|Stability}}{{defn|Associated with the bandwidth limitation is a phase difference between the input signal and the amplifier output that can lead to [[electronic oscillation|oscillation]] in some feedback circuits. For example, a sinusoidal output signal meant to interfere destructively with an input signal of the same frequency will interfere constructively if delayed by 180 degrees forming [[positive feedback]]. In these cases, the feedback circuit can be [[BIBO stability|stabilized]] by means of [[frequency compensation]], which increases the [[Gain margin|gain or phase margin]] of the open-loop circuit. The circuit designer can implement this compensation externally with a separate circuit component. Alternatively, the compensation can be implemented within the operational amplifier with the addition of a [[Frequency compensation#Dominant-pole compensation|dominant pole]] that sufficiently attenuates the high-frequency gain of the operational amplifier. The location of this pole may be fixed internally by the manufacturer or configured by the circuit designer using methods specific to the op-amp. In general, dominant-pole frequency compensation reduces the bandwidth of the op-amp even further. When the desired closed-loop gain is high, op-amp frequency compensation is often not needed because the requisite open-loop gain is sufficiently low; consequently, applications with high closed-loop gain can make use of op-amps with higher bandwidths.}}{{term|Distortion, and other effects}}{{defn|Limited bandwidth also results in lower amounts of feedback at higher frequencies, producing higher distortion, and output impedance as the frequency increases.}}{{glossary end}}{{paragraph break}}Typical low-cost, general-purpose op-amps exhibit a GBWP of a few megahertz. Specialty and high-speed op-amps exist that can achieve a GBWP of hundreds of megahertz. For very high-frequency circuits, a [[current-feedback operational amplifier]] is often used.

;Noise: Amplifiers generate random voltage at the output even when there is no signal applied. This can be due to thermal noise and flicker noise of the devices. For applications with high gain or high bandwidth, noise becomes a very important consideration.

;Input [[capacitance]]: Most important for high frequency operation because it reduces input impedance and may cause phase shifts.

;Common-mode gain: See DC imperfections, above.

;Power-supply rejection: With increasing frequency the power-supply rejection usually gets worse. So it can be important to keep the supply clean of higher frequency ripples and signals, e.g. by the use of [[bypass capacitor]]s.

====Non-linear imperfections====
[[File:Inverting Amplifier Signal Clipping.png|thumb|The input (yellow) and output (green) of a saturated op amp in an inverting amplifier]]
; [[Clipping (signal processing)|Saturation]]:Output voltage is limited to a minimum and maximum value close to the [[power supply]] voltages.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;That the output cannot reach the power supply voltages is usually the result of limitations of the amplifier's output stage transistors. See [[#Output stage|Output stage]].&lt;/ref&gt; The output of older op-amps can reach to within one or two volts of the supply rails. The output of newer so-called "rail to rail" op-amps can reach to within millivolts of the supply rails when providing low output currents.
; Slewing: The amplifier's output voltage reaches its maximum rate of change, the [[slew rate]], usually specified in volts per microsecond. When slewing occurs, further increases in the input signal have no effect on the rate of change of the output. Slewing is usually caused by the input stage saturating; the result is a constant current {{mvar|i}} driving a capacitance {{mvar|C}} in the amplifier (especially those capacitances used to implement its [[frequency compensation]]); the slew rate is limited by {{math|d''v''/d''t'' {{=}} ''i''/''C''}}.{{paragraph break}} Slewing is associated with the ''large-signal'' performance of an op-amp.  Consider, for example, an op-amp configured for a gain of 10.  Let the input be a 1{{nbsp}}V, 100&amp;nbsp;kHz sawtooth wave. That is, the amplitude is 1{{nbsp}}V and the period is 10 microseconds. Accordingly, the rate of change (i.e., the slope) of the input is 0.1{{nbsp}}V per microsecond.  After 10× amplification, the output should be a 10{{nbsp}}V,  100&amp;nbsp;kHz sawtooth, with a corresponding slew rate of 1{{nbsp}}V per microsecond.  However, the classic 741 op-amp has a 0.5{{nbsp}}V per microsecond slew rate specification, so that its output can rise to no more than 5{{nbsp}}V in the sawtooth's 10 microsecond period. Thus, if one were to measure the output, it would be a 5{{nbsp}}V, 100&amp;nbsp;kHz sawtooth, rather than a 10{{nbsp}}V, 100&amp;nbsp;kHz sawtooth.{{paragraph break}}Next consider the same amplifier and 100&amp;nbsp;kHz sawtooth, but now the input amplitude is 100{{nbsp}}mV rather than 1{{nbsp}}V.  After 10× amplification the output is a 1{{nbsp}}V, 100&amp;nbsp;kHz sawtooth with a corresponding slew rate of 0.1{{nbsp}}V per microsecond.  In this instance, the 741 with its 0.5{{nbsp}}V per microsecond slew rate will amplify the input properly.{{paragraph break}} Modern high speed op-amps can have slew rates in excess of 5,000{{nbsp}}V per microsecond. However, it is more common for op-amps to have slew rates in the range 5–100{{nbsp}}V per microsecond.  For example, the general purpose TL081 op-amp has a slew rate of 13{{nbsp}}V per microsecond.  As a general rule, low power and small bandwidth op-amps have low slew rates.  As an example, the LT1494 micropower op-amp consumes 1.5 microamp but has a 2.7&amp;nbsp;kHz gain-bandwidth product and a 0.001{{nbsp}}V per microsecond slew rate.

; Non-[[linear]] input-output relationship: The output voltage may not be accurately proportional to the difference between the input voltages. It is commonly called distortion when the input signal is a waveform. This effect will be very small in a practical circuit where substantial negative feedback is used.

; Phase reversal: In some integrated op-amps, when the published common mode voltage is violated (e.g., by one of the inputs being driven to one of the supply voltages), the output may slew to the opposite polarity from what is expected in normal operation.&lt;ref&gt;

====Power considerations====
;Limited [[current limiting|output current]]: The output current must be finite. In practice, most op-amps are designed to limit the output current so as not to exceed a specified level – around 25&amp;thinsp;mA for a type 741 IC op-amp – thus protecting the op-amp and associated circuitry from damage. Modern designs are electronically more rugged than earlier implementations and some can sustain direct [[short circuit]]s on their outputs without damage.

;Output sink current: The output sink current is the maximum current allowed to sink into the output stage. Some manufacturers show the output voltage vs. the output sink current plot, which gives an idea of the output voltage when it is sinking current from another source into the output pin.
;Limited dissipated [[electric power|power]]: The output current flows through the op-amp's internal output impedance, dissipating heat.  If the op-amp dissipates too much power, then its temperature will increase above some safe limit. The op-amp may enter thermal shutdown, or it may be destroyed.
Modern integrated [[Field effect transistor|FET]] or [[MOSFET]] op-amps approximate more closely the ideal op-amp than bipolar ICs when it comes to input impedance and input bias currents. Bipolars are generally better when it comes to input ''voltage'' offset, and often have lower noise. Generally, at room temperature, with a fairly large signal, and limited bandwidth, FET and MOSFET op-amps now offer better performance.

=== Architecture ===
A small-scale [[integrated circuit]], the 741 op-amp shares with most op-amps an internal structure consisting of three gain stages:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.righto.com/2015/10/inside-ubiquitous-741-op-amp-circuits.html|title=Understanding silicon circuits: inside the ubiquitous 741 op amp|author=|date=|website=www.righto.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009072728/http://www.righto.com/2015/10/inside-ubiquitous-741-op-amp-circuits.html|archivedate=9 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Differential amplifier]] (outlined [[Dark blue (color)|dark blue]]) — provides high differential amplification (gain), with rejection of common-mode signal, low noise, high [[input impedance]], and drives a
# Voltage amplifier (outlined [[magenta]]) — provides high voltage gain, a single-pole frequency [[roll-off]], and in turn drives the
# Output amplifier (outlined [[cyan]] and [[green]]) — provides high current gain (low [[output impedance]]), along with output current limiting, and output short-circuit protection.
Additionally, it contains [[current mirror]] (outlined red) bias circuitry and [[Frequency compensation|compensation]] capacitor (30&amp;nbsp;pF).

==== Differential amplifier ====
The input stage consists of a cascaded [[differential amplifier]] (outlined in [[blue]]) followed by a current-mirror [[active load]].  This constitutes a [[transconductance amplifier]], turning a differential voltage signal at the bases of Q1, Q2 into a current signal into the base of Q15.

It entails two cascaded transistor pairs, satisfying conflicting requirements. 
The first stage consists of the matched NPN [[emitter follower]] pair Q1, Q2 that provide high input impedance. 
The second is the matched PNP [[common-base]] pair Q3, Q4 that eliminates the undesirable [[Miller effect]]; it drives an [[active load]] Q7 plus matched pair Q5, Q6.

That active load is implemented as a modified [[Wilson current mirror]]; its role is to convert the (differential) input current signal to a single-ended signal without the attendant 50% losses (increasing the op-amp's open-loop gain by 3&amp;nbsp;dB).&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Widlar used this same trick in μA702 and μA709&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thus, a small-signal differential current in Q3 versus Q4 appears summed (doubled) at the base of Q15, the input of the voltage gain stage. 
&lt;!--{{Awkward|date=February 2014}}This is achieved by copying the input signal from the left to the right side where the magnitudes of the two input signals add . For this purpose, the input of the current mirror (Q5 collector) is connected to the left output (Q3 collector) and the output of the current mirror (Q6 collector) is connected to the right output of the differential amplifier (Q4 collector). Q7 increases the accuracy of the current mirror by decreasing the amount of signal current required from Q3 to drive the bases of Q5 and Q6.--&gt;&lt;!--{{Dubious|date=June 2011}} If Q5 and Q6 have decent beta, then total base current for Q5 and Q6 is only a few percent. Q7 increases V_CE of Q5 for better BW. Also symmetry with Q15.{{Dubious|date=June 2011}} Q8 mirrors the input stage bias current; there's a feedback circuit with Q3-Q4 to match input stage current to current set by bias circuit mirror transistor Q10. --&gt;

==== Voltage amplifier ====
The ([[Electronic amplifier#Class A|class-A]]) voltage gain stage (outlined in [[magenta]]) consists of the two NPN transistors Q15/Q19 connected in a [[Darlington transistor|Darlington configuration]] and uses the output side of current mirror Q12/Q13 as its collector (dynamic) load to achieve its high voltage gain. The output sink transistor Q20 receives its base drive from the common collectors of Q15 and Q19; the level-shifter Q16 provides base drive for the output source transistor Q14. &lt;!-- Note the similarity between the transistors Q15 and Q7 -- just accidently a similar position in the plan, not a matched pair--&gt;

The transistor Q22 prevents this stage from delivering excessive current to Q20 and thus limits the output sink current.

==== Output amplifier ====
The output stage (Q14, Q20, outlined in [[cyan]]) is a [[Class AB]] complementary-symmetry amplifier. It provides an output drive with impedance of ≈50&amp;Omega;, in essence, current gain. 
Transistor Q16 (outlined in [[green]]) provides the quiescent current for the output transistors, and Q16 provides output current limiting. 
&lt;!-- The output stage (outlined in [[cyan]]) is a [[Class AB]] push-pull emitter follower (Q14, Q20) amplifier with the bias set by the ''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt; multiplier voltage source Q16 and its base resistors. This stage is effectively driven by the collectors of Q13 and Q19.  --&gt;

=== Biasing circuits ===
Provide appropriate quiescent current for each stage of the op-amp.

The resistor (39&amp;nbsp;k&amp;Omega;) connecting the (diode-connected) Q11 and Q12, and the given supply voltage (''V''&lt;sub&gt;''S''+&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''V''&lt;sub&gt;''S''−&lt;/sub&gt;), determine the current in the [[current mirror]]s, (matched pairs) Q10/Q11 and Q12/Q13. The collector current of Q11, ''i''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; × 39&amp;nbsp;kΩ = ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''S''+&lt;/sub&gt; − ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''S''−&lt;/sub&gt; − 2 ''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;. For the typical ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; = ±20&amp;nbsp;V, the standing current in Q11/Q12 (as well as in Q13) would be ~1&amp;nbsp;mA. A supply current for a typical 741 of about 2&amp;nbsp;mA agrees with the notion that these two bias currents dominate the quiescent supply current.&lt;!-- per NS LM714 data sheet --&gt;

Transistors Q11 and Q10 form a [[Widlar current mirror]], with quiescent current in Q10 ''i''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; such that ln(''i''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; / ''i''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''i''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; × 5&amp;nbsp;kΩ / 28&amp;nbsp;mV, where 5&amp;nbsp;kΩ represents the emitter resistor of Q10, and 28&amp;nbsp;mV is V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[thermal voltage]] at room temperature. In this case ''i''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 20&amp;nbsp;μA.

==== Differential amplifier ====
The biasing circuit of this stage is set by a feedback loop that forces the collector currents of Q10 and Q9 to (nearly) match. The small difference in these currents provides the drive for the common base of Q3/Q4 (note that the base drive for input transistors Q1/Q2 is the input bias current and must be sourced externally). The summed quiescent currents of Q1/Q3 plus Q2/Q4 is mirrored from Q8 into Q9, where it is summed with the collector current in Q10, the result being applied to the bases of Q3/Q4.

The quiescent currents of  Q1/Q3 (resp., Q2/Q4) ''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; will thus be half of ''i''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, of order ~10&amp;nbsp;μA. Input bias current for the base of Q1 (resp. Q2) will amount to ''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; / β; typically ~50&amp;nbsp;nA,&lt;!-- per National Semiconductor specification for the LM741--&gt; implying a current gain ''h''&lt;sub&gt;fe&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 200 for Q1(Q2).

This feedback circuit tends to draw the common base node of Q3/Q4 to a voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;com&lt;/sub&gt; − 2 ''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''V''&lt;sub&gt;com&lt;/sub&gt; is the input common-mode voltage. At the same time, the magnitude of the quiescent current is relatively insensitive to the characteristics of the components Q1–Q4, such as ''h''&lt;sub&gt;fe&lt;/sub&gt;, that would otherwise cause temperature dependence or part-to-part variations.

Transistor Q7 drives Q5 and Q6 into conduction until their (equal) collector currents match that of Q1/Q3 and Q2/Q4. The quiescent current in Q7 is ''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt; / 50&amp;nbsp;kΩ, about 35&amp;nbsp;μA, as is the quiescent current in Q15, with its matching operating point. Thus, the quiescent currents are pairwise matched in Q1/Q2, Q3/Q4, Q5/Q6, and Q7/Q15. 
&lt;!--
The classical [[Differential amplifier#Long-tailed pair|emitter-coupled differential stage]] is biased from the side of the emitters by connecting a constant current source to them. The series negative feedback (the emitter degeneration) makes the transistors act as voltage stabilizers; it forces them to adjust their ''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt; voltages so that to pass the current through their collector-emitter junctions. As a result, ''the quiescent current is β-independent''.

Here, the Q3/Q4 emitters are already used as inputs. Their collectors are separated and cannot be used as inputs for the quiescent current source since they behave as current sources. So, the quiescent current can be set only from the side of the bases by connecting a constant current source to them. To make it not depend on β as above, a negative but parallel feedback is used. For this purpose, the total quiescent current is mirrored by Q8-Q9 current mirror and the negative feedback is taken from the Q9 collector. Now it makes the transistors Q1-Q4 adjust their ''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt; voltages so that to pass the desired quiescent current. The effect is the same as at the classical emitter-coupled pair — ''the quiescent current is β-independent''. It is interesting fact that "to the extent that all PNP βs match, this clever circuit generates just the right β-dependent base current to produce a β-independent collector current".&lt;ref name = "Lee" /&gt; The biasing base currents are usually provided only by the negative power supply; they should come from the ground and enter the bases. But to ensure maximum high input impedances, the biasing loops are not internally closed between the base and ground; it is expected they will be closed externally by the input sources. So, the sources have to be galvanic (DC) to ensure paths for the biasing currents and low resistive enough (tens or hundreds kilohms) to not create significant voltage drops across them. Otherwise, additional DC elements should be connected between the bases and the ground (or the positive power supply).

The quiescent current is set by the 39 kΩ resistor that is common for the two current mirrors Q12-Q13 and Q10-Q11. The current determined by this resistor acts also as a reference for the other bias currents used in the chip. The [[Widlar current mirror]] built by Q10, Q11, and the 5 kΩ resistor produces a very small fraction of ''I''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; at the Q10 collector. This small constant current through Q10's collector supplies the base currents for Q3 and Q4 as well as the Q9 collector current. The Q8/Q9 current mirror tries to make Q9 collector current the same as the Q3 and Q4 collector currents and succeeds with the help of the negative feedback. The Q9 collector voltage changes until the ratio between the Q3/Q4 base and collector currents becomes equal to β. Thus Q3 and Q4's combined base currents (which are of the same order as the overall chip's input currents) are a small fraction of the already small Q10 current.

Thus the quiescent current is set by Q10-Q11 current mirror without using a current-sensing negative feedback. The voltage-sensing negative feedback only helps this process by stabilizing Q9 collector (Q3/Q4 base) voltage.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;This arrangement can be generalized by an equivalent circuit consisting of a constant current source loaded by a voltage source; the voltage source fixes the voltage across the current source while the current source sets the current through the voltage source. As the two heterogeneous sources provide ideal load conditions for each other, this circuit solution is widely used in [[cascode|cascode circuits]], [[Wilson current mirror]], the input part of the simple [[current mirror]], emitter-coupled and other exotic circuits.&lt;/ref&gt; The feedback loop also isolates the rest of the circuit from [[common-mode signal]]s by making the base voltage of Q3/Q4 follow tightly 2''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt; below the higher of the two input voltages.
--&gt;

==== Voltage amplifier ====

Quiescent currents in Q16 and Q19 are set by the current mirror Q12/Q13, which is running at ~1&amp;nbsp;mA. Through some{{vague|date=January 2016}} mechanism, the collector current in Q19 tracks that standing current.

==== Output amplifier ====

In the circuit involving Q16 (variously named [[rubber diode]] or ''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt; multiplier), the 4.5&amp;nbsp;k&amp;Omega; resistor must be conducting about 100&amp;nbsp;μA, with the Q16 ''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt; roughly 700&amp;nbsp;mV. Then the ''V''&lt;sub&gt;CB&lt;/sub&gt; must be about 0.45&amp;nbsp;V and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt; at about 1.0&amp;nbsp;V. Because the Q16 collector is driven by a current source and the Q16 emitter drives into the Q19 collector current sink, the Q16 transistor establishes a voltage difference between Q14 base and Q20 base of ~1&amp;nbsp;V, regardless of the common-mode voltage of Q14/Q20 base. The standing current in Q14/Q20 will be a factor [[diode modelling|exp(100&amp;nbsp;mV / V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;) ≈ 36]] smaller than the 1&amp;nbsp;mA quiescent current in the class A portion of the op amp. This (small) standing current in the output transistors establishes the output stage in class AB operation and reduces the [[crossover distortion]] of this stage. 
&lt;!--
[[Image:Block Diagram for Feedback.svg|thumb|right|The circuit presented as a negative feedback amplifier with constant input voltage|250px|right]]
The green outlined section (based on Q16) is a voltage level shifter named ''rubber diode'', ''transistor Zener'' or ''V&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt; multiplier''. In the circuit as shown, Q16 provides a constant voltage drop across its collector-emitter junction regardless of the current through it (it acts as a voltage stabilizer). This is achieved by introducing a negative feedback between Q16 collector and its base, i.e. by connecting a voltage divider with ratio β = 7.5 kΩ / (4.5 kΩ + 7.5 kΩ) = 0.625 composed by the two resistors. If the base current to the transistor is assumed to be zero, the negative feedback forces the transistor to increase its collector-emitter voltage up to 1 V until its base-emitter voltage reaches 0.625 V (a typical value for a BJT in the active region). This serves to bias the two output transistors slightly into conduction reducing [[crossover distortion]] (in some discrete component amplifiers, this function is usually achieved with a string of two silicon diodes).

The circuit can be presented as a negative feedback voltage amplifier with constant input voltage of 0.625 V and a feedback ratio of β = 0.625 (a gain of 1/β = 1.6). The same circuit but with β = 1 is used in the input current-setting part of the classical [[Current mirror#Basic bipolar transistor mirror|BJT current mirror]].
--&gt;

=== Small-signal differential mode ===
A small differential input voltage signal gives rise, through multiple stages of current amplification, to a much larger voltage signal on output.

==== Input impedance ====
The input stage with Q1 and Q3 is similar to an emitter-coupled pair (long-tailed pair), with Q2 and Q4 adding some degenerating impedance. The input impedance is relatively high because of the small current through Q1-Q4.
A typical 741 op amp has a differential input impedance of about 2 M&amp;Omega;.&lt;!-- per NS LM741 data sheet --&gt; 
The common mode input impedance is even higher, as the input stage works at an essentially constant current.

==== Differential amplifier ====
A differential voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;In&lt;/sub&gt; at the op-amp inputs (pins 3 and 2, respectively) gives rise to a small differential current in the bases of Q1 and Q2 ''i''&lt;sub&gt;In&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ ''V''&lt;sub&gt;In&lt;/sub&gt; / (2 ''h''&lt;sub&gt;ie&lt;/sub&gt; × ''h''&lt;sub&gt;fe&lt;/sub&gt;). 
This differential base current causes a change in the differential collector current in each leg by ''i''&lt;sub&gt;In&lt;/sub&gt; × ''h''&lt;sub&gt;fe&lt;/sub&gt;. Introducing the transconductance of Q1, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''h''&lt;sub&gt;fe&lt;/sub&gt; / ''h''&lt;sub&gt;ie&lt;/sub&gt;, the (small-signal) current at the base of Q15 (the input of the voltage gain stage) is ''V''&lt;sub&gt;In&lt;/sub&gt; × ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; / 2.

This portion of the op amp cleverly changes a differential signal at the op amp inputs to a single-ended signal at the base of Q15, and in a way that avoids wastefully discarding the signal in either leg. To see how, notice that a small negative change in voltage at the inverting input (Q2 base) drives it out of conduction, and this incremental decrease in current passes directly from Q4 collector to its emitter, resulting in a decrease in base drive for Q15. On the other hand, a small positive change in voltage at the non-inverting input (Q1 base) drives this transistor into conduction, reflected in an increase in current at the collector of Q3. This current drives Q7 further into conduction, which turns on current mirror Q5/Q6. Thus, the increase in Q3 emitter current is mirrored in an increase in Q6 collector current; the increased collector currents shunts more from the collector node and results in a decrease in base drive current for Q15. Besides avoiding wasting 3&amp;nbsp;dB of gain here, this technique decreases common-mode gain and feedthrough of power supply noise. 
&lt;!-- The input voltage sources are connected through two "diode" strings, each of them consisting of two connected in series base-emitter junctions (Q1-Q3 and Q2-Q4), to the common point of Q3/Q4 bases. So, if the input voltages change slightly in opposite directions, Q3/Q4 bases stay at relatively constant voltage and the common base current does not change as well; it only vigorously steers between Q3/Q4 bases and makes the common quiescent current distribute between Q3/Q4 collectors in the same proportion.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;If the input differential voltage changes significantly (with more than about a hundred millivolts), the base-emitter junctions of the transistors driven by the lower input voltage (e.g., Q1 and Q3) become backward biased and the total common base current flows through the other (Q2 and Q4) base-emitter junctions. However, the high breakdown voltage of the PNP transistors Q3/Q4 prevents Q1/Q2 base-emitter junctions from damaging when the input difference voltage increases up to 50 V because of the unlimited current that may flow directly through the "diode bridge" between the two input sources.&lt;/ref&gt; The current mirror inverts Q3 collector current and tries to pass it through Q4. In the middle point between Q4 and Q6, the signal currents (current changes) of Q3 and Q4 are subtracted. In this case (differential input signal), they are equal and opposite. Thus, the difference is twice the individual signal currents (Δ''I'' − (−Δ''I'') = 2Δ''I'')&lt;! --{{Dubious|date=June 2011}} if signals equal and opposite, their sum would be zero. Must explain the mirror's gain. -- &gt; and the differential to single ended conversion is completed without gain losses. The open circuit signal voltage appearing at this point is given by the product of the subtracted signal currents and the total circuit impedance (the paralleled collector resistances of Q4 and Q6). Since the collectors of Q4 and Q6 appear as high differential resistances to the signal current (Q4 and Q6 behave as current sources), the open circuit voltage gain of this stage is very high.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;This circuit (and geometrical) phenomenon can be illustrated graphically by superimposing the Q4 and Q6 output characteristics (almost parallel horizontal lines) on the same coordinate system. When the input voltages vary slightly in opposite directions, the two curves move slightly toward each other in the vertical direction but the operating (cross) point moves vigorously in the horizontal direction. The ratio between the two movements represents the high amplification.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
More intuitively, the transistor Q6 can be considered as a duplicate of Q3 and the combination of Q4 and Q6 can be thought as of a varying voltage divider composed of two voltage-controlled resistors. For differential input signals, they vigorously change their instant resistances in opposite directions but the total resistance stays constant (like a potentiometer with quickly moving slider). As a result, the current stays constant as well but the voltage at the middle point changes vigorously. As the two resistance changes are equal and opposite, the effective voltage change is twice the individual change. --&gt;

==== Voltage amplifier ====
A current signal ''i'' at Q15's base gives rise to a current in Q19 of order ''i'' × β&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (the product of the ''h''&lt;sub&gt;fe&lt;/sub&gt; of each of Q15 and Q19, which are connected in a [[Darlington pair]]). This current signal develops a voltage at the bases of output transistors Q14/Q20 proportional to the ''h''&lt;sub&gt;ie&lt;/sub&gt; of the respective transistor.

==== Output amplifier ====
Output transistors Q14 and Q20 are each configured as an emitter follower, so no voltage gain occurs there; instead, this stage provides current gain, equal to the ''h''&lt;sub&gt;fe&lt;/sub&gt; of Q14 (resp. Q20).

The output impedance is not zero, as it would be in an ideal op-amp, but with negative feedback it approaches zero at low frequencies.

==== Overall open-loop voltage gain ====
The net open-loop small-signal voltage gain of the op amp involves the product of the current gain ''h''&lt;sub&gt;fe&lt;/sub&gt; of some 4 transistors. 
In practice, the voltage gain for a typical 741-style op amp is of order 200,000,&lt;!-- per NS LM741 data sheet --&gt; and the current gain, the ratio of input impedance (≈2−6 M&amp;Omega;) to output impedance (≈50&amp;Omega;) provides yet more (power) gain.

=== Other linear characteristics ===

==== Small-signal common mode gain ====
The ideal op amp has infinite [[common-mode rejection ratio]], or zero common-mode gain.

In the present circuit, if the input voltages change in the same direction, the negative feedback makes Q3/Q4 base voltage follow (with 2''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt; below) the input voltage variations. Now the output part (Q10) of Q10-Q11 current mirror keeps up the common current through Q9/Q8 constant in spite of varying voltage. Q3/Q4 collector currents, and accordingly the output current at the base of Q15, remain unchanged.

In the typical 741 op amp, the common-mode rejection ratio is 90&amp;nbsp;dB,&lt;!-- per NS LM741 data sheet --&gt; implying an open-loop common-mode voltage gain of about 6.&lt;!-- 200,000 / 10^^(4.5) --&gt;

==== Frequency compensation ====
The innovation of the Fairchild μA741 was the introduction of [[frequency compensation]] via an on-chip (monolithic) capacitor, simplifying application of the op amp by eliminating the need for external components for this function. 
The 30 pF capacitor stabilizes the amplifier via [[Miller effect|Miller compensation]] and functions in a manner similar to an op-amp [[integrator]] circuit. Also known as 'dominant [[Pole (complex analysis)|pole]] compensation' because it introduces a pole that masks (dominates) the effects of other poles into the [[open loop]] frequency response; in a 741 op amp this pole can be as low as 10&amp;nbsp;Hz (where it causes a −3&amp;nbsp;dB loss of open loop voltage gain).

This internal compensation is provided to achieve unconditional [[BIBO stability|stability]] of the amplifier in negative feedback configurations where the feedback network is non-reactive and the [[Electronic feedback loops|closed loop]] gain is [[unity (mathematics)|unity]] or higher. 
By contrast, amplifiers requiring external compensation, such as the μA748, may require external compensation or closed-loop gains significantly higher than unity.

==== Input offset voltage ====
The "offset null" pins may be used to place external resistors (typically in the form of the two ends of a potentiometer, with the slider connected to ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''S''–&lt;/sub&gt;) in parallel with the emitter resistors of Q5 and Q6, to adjust the balance of the Q5/Q6 current mirror. The potentiometer is adjusted such that the output is null (midrange) when the inputs are shorted together.

=== Non-linear characteristics ===

==== Input breakdown voltage ====
The transistors Q3, Q4 help to increase the reverse ''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt; rating: the base-emitter junctions of the NPN transistors Q1 and Q2 break down at around 7V, but the PNP transistors Q3 and Q4 have ''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt; breakdown voltages around 50 V.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecow.engr.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/get/ece/342/schowalter/notes/chapter10/theua741operationalamplifier.ppt The μA741 Operational Amplifier] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Output-stage voltage swing and current limiting ====
Variations in the quiescent current with temperature, or between parts with the same type number, are common, so [[crossover distortion]] and [[quiescent current]] may be subject to significant variation.

The output range of the amplifier is about one volt less than the supply voltage, owing in part to ''V''&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt; of the output transistors Q14 and Q20.

The 25 Ω resistor at the Q14 emitter, along with Q17, acts to limit Q14 current to about 25 mA; otherwise, Q17 conducts no current.

Current limiting for Q20 is performed in the voltage gain stage: Q22 senses the voltage across Q19's emitter resistor (50&amp;Omega;); as it turns on, it diminishes the drive current to Q15 base.

Later versions of this amplifier schematic may show a somewhat different method of output current limiting.

===Applicability considerations===
While the 741 was historically used in audio and other sensitive equipment, such use is now rare because of the improved [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] performance of more modern op-amps. Apart from generating noticeable hiss, 741s and other older op-amps may have poor [[common-mode rejection ratio]]s and so will often introduce cable-borne mains hum and other common-mode interference, such as switch 'clicks', into sensitive equipment.

The "741" has come to often mean a generic op-amp IC (such as μA741, LM301, 558, LM324, TBA221 — or a more modern replacement such as the TL071).  The description of the 741 output stage is qualitatively similar for many other designs (that may have quite different input stages), except:
* Some devices (μA748, LM301, LM308) are not internally compensated (require an external capacitor from output to some point within the operational amplifier, if used in low closed-loop gain applications).
* Some modern devices have "rail-to-rail output" capability, meaning that the output can range from within a few millivolts of the positive supply voltage to within a few millivolts of the negative supply voltage.

== Classification ==
Op-amps may be classified by their construction:
* discrete (built from individual [[transistor]]s or [[vacuum tube|tubes/valves]])
* IC (fabricated in an [[Integrated circuit]]) — most common
* hybrid
IC op-amps may be classified in many ways, including:
* Military, Industrial, or Commercial grade (for example: the LM301 is the commercial grade version of the LM101, the LM201 is the industrial version). This may define [[operating temperature]] ranges and other environmental or quality factors.
* Classification by package type may also affect environmental hardiness, as well as manufacturing options; [[Dual in-line package|DIP]], and other through-hole packages are tending to be replaced by [[Surface-mount technology|surface-mount devices]].
* Classification by internal compensation: op-amps may suffer from high frequency [[Nyquist stability criterion|instability]] in some [[negative feedback]] circuits unless a small compensation capacitor modifies the phase and frequency responses. Op-amps with a built-in capacitor are termed "''compensated''", and allow circuits above some specified [[Electronic feedback loops|closed-loop]] gain to operate stably with no external capacitor.  In particular, op-amps that are stable even with a closed loop gain of 1 are called "unity gain compensated".
* Single, dual and quad versions of many commercial op-amp IC are available, meaning 1, 2 or 4 operational amplifiers are included in the same package.
* Rail-to-rail input (and/or output) op-amps can work with input (and/or output) signals very close to the power supply rails.
* [[CMOS]] op-amps (such as the CA3140E) provide extremely high input resistances, higher than [[JFET]]-input op-amps, which are normally higher than [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]]-input op-amps.
* other varieties of op-amp include programmable op-amps (simply meaning the quiescent current, bandwidth and so on can be adjusted by an external resistor).
* manufacturers often tabulate their op-amps according to purpose, such as low-noise pre-amplifiers, wide bandwidth amplifiers, and so on.

== Applications ==

{{Main|Operational amplifier applications}}

=== Use in electronics system design ===
The use of op-amps as circuit blocks is much easier and clearer than specifying all their individual circuit elements (transistors, resistors, etc.), whether the amplifiers used are integrated or discrete circuits. In the first approximation op-amps can be used as if they were ideal differential gain blocks; at a later stage limits can be placed on the acceptable range of parameters for each op-amp.

Circuit design follows the same lines for all electronic circuits. A specification is drawn up governing what the circuit is required to do, with allowable limits. For example, the gain may be required to be 100 times, with a tolerance of 5% but drift of less than 1% in a specified temperature range; the input impedance not less than one megohm; etc.

A basic [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] is designed, often with the help of circuit modeling (on a computer). Specific commercially available op-amps and other components are then chosen that meet the design criteria within the specified tolerances at acceptable cost. If not all criteria can be met, the specification may need to be modified.

A prototype is then built and tested; changes to meet or improve the specification, alter functionality, or reduce the cost, may be made.

=== Applications without using any feedback ===
That is, the op-amp is being used as a [[voltage comparator]]. Note that a device designed primarily as a comparator may be better if, for instance, speed is important or a wide range of input voltages may be found, since such devices can quickly recover from full on or full off ("saturated") states.

A ''voltage level detector'' can be obtained if a reference voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; is applied to one of the op-amp's inputs. This means that the op-amp is set up as a comparator to detect a positive voltage. If the voltage to be sensed, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, is applied to op amp's (+) input, the result is a noninverting positive-level detector: when ''E''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is above ''V''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; equals +''V''&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt;; when ''E''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is below ''V''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; equals −''V''&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt;. If ''E''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is applied to the inverting input, the circuit is an inverting positive-level detector: When ''E''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is above ''V''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; equals −''V''&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt;.

A ''zero voltage level detector'' (''E''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 0) can convert, for example, the output of a sine-wave from a function generator into a variable-frequency square wave. If ''E''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is a sine wave, triangular wave, or wave of any other shape that is symmetrical around zero, the zero-crossing detector's output will be square.  Zero-crossing detection may also be useful in triggering [[TRIAC]]s at the best time to reduce mains interference and current spikes.

===Positive-feedback applications===

[[Image:Op-Amp Schmitt Trigger.svg|right|thumb|300px|Schmitt trigger implemented by a non-inverting comparator]]

Another typical configuration of op-amps is with positive feedback, which takes a fraction of the output signal back to the non-inverting input. An important application of it is the comparator with hysteresis, the [[Schmitt trigger]].  Some circuits may use ''positive'' feedback and ''negative'' feedback around the same amplifier, for example [[triangle wave|triangle-wave]] [[oscillator]]s and [[active filters]].

Because of the wide slew range and lack of positive feedback, the response of all the open-loop level detectors described [[#Applications without using any feedback|above]] will be relatively slow. External overall positive feedback may be applied, but (unlike internal positive feedback that may be applied within the latter stages of a purpose-designed comparator) this markedly affects the accuracy of the zero-crossing detection point. Using a general-purpose op-amp, for example, the frequency of ''E''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; for the sine to square wave converter should probably be below 100&amp;nbsp;Hz.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Negative-feedback applications===

==== Non-inverting amplifier ====
[[Image:Op-Amp Non-Inverting Amplifier.svg|frame|An op-amp connected in the non-inverting amplifier configuration]]
In a non-inverting amplifier, the output voltage changes in the same direction as the input voltage.

The gain equation for the op-amp is
:&lt;math&gt;V_\text{out} = A_\text{OL} (V_+ - V_-).&lt;/math&gt;

However, in this circuit ''V''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; is a function of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; because of the negative feedback through the ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; network.  ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; form a [[voltage divider]], and as ''V''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; is a high-impedance input, it does not load it appreciably.  Consequently
:&lt;math&gt;V_- = \beta V_\text{out},&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this into the gain equation, we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;V_\text{out} = A_\text{OL} (V_\text{in} - \beta V_\text{out}).&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for &lt;math&gt;V_\text{out}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;V_\text{out} = V_\text{in} \left( \frac{1}{\beta + \frac{1}{A_\text{OL}}} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;A_\text{OL}&lt;/math&gt; is very large, this simplifies to
:&lt;math&gt;
  V_\text{out} \approx \frac{V_\text{in}}{\beta}
                     = \frac{V_\text{in}}{\frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2}}
                     = V_\text{in} \left(1 + \frac{R_2}{R_1}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

The non-inverting input of the operational amplifier needs a path for DC to ground; if the signal source does not supply a DC path, or if that source requires a given load impedance, then the circuit will require another resistor from the non-inverting input to ground. When the operational amplifier's input bias currents are significant, then the DC source resistances driving the inputs should be balanced.&lt;ref&gt;An input bias current of 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;micro;A through a DC source resistance of 10&amp;nbsp;k&amp;Omega; produces a 10&amp;nbsp;mV offset voltage. If the other input bias current is the same and sees the same source resistance, then the two input offset voltages will cancel out.  Balancing the DC source resistances may not be necessary if the input bias current and source resistance product is small.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ideal value for the feedback resistors (to give minimal offset voltage) will be such that the two resistances in parallel roughly equal the resistance to ground at the non-inverting input pin.  That ideal value assumes the bias currents are well matched, which may not be true for all op-amps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/tutorials/MT-038.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Inverting amplifier ====
[[Image:Op-Amp Inverting Amplifier.svg|frame|right|An op-amp connected in the inverting amplifier configuration]]

In an inverting amplifier, the output voltage changes in an opposite direction to the input voltage.

As with the non-inverting amplifier, we start with the gain equation of the op-amp:

:&lt;math&gt;V_\text{out} = A_\text{OL} (V_+ - V_-).&lt;/math&gt;

This time, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; is a function of both ''V''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; due to the voltage divider formed by ''R''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;.  Again, the op-amp input does not apply an appreciable load, so

:&lt;math&gt;V_- = \frac{1}{R_\text{f} + R_\text{in}} \left( R_\text{f} V_\text{in} + R_\text{in} V_\text{out} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this into the gain equation and solving for &lt;math&gt;V_\text{out}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;V_\text{out} = - V_\text{in} \cdot \frac{A_\text{OL} R_\text{f}}{R_\text{f} + R_\text{in} + A_\text{OL} R_\text{in}}.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;A_\text{OL}&lt;/math&gt; is very large, this simplifies to

:&lt;math&gt;
V_\text{out} \approx -V_\text{in} \frac{R_\text{f}}{R_\text{in}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

A resistor is often inserted between the non-inverting input and ground (so both inputs "see" similar resistances), reducing the [[input offset voltage]] due to different voltage drops due to [[bias current]], and may reduce distortion in some op-amps.

A [[Capacitive coupling|DC-blocking]] [[capacitor]] may be inserted in series with the input resistor when a [[frequency response]] down to DC is not needed and any DC voltage on the input is unwanted. That is, the capacitive component of the input impedance inserts a DC [[complex zero|zero]] and a low-frequency [[complex pole|pole]] that gives the circuit a [[bandpass]] or [[high-pass]] characteristic.

The potentials at the operational amplifier inputs remain virtually constant (near ground) in the inverting configuration.  The constant operating potential typically results in  distortion levels that are lower than those attainable with the non-inverting topology.

Most single, dual and quad op-amps available have a standardized pin-out which permits one type to be substituted for another without wiring changes. A specific op-amp may be chosen for its open loop gain, bandwidth, noise performance, input impedance, power consumption, or a compromise between any of these factors.

==Historical timeline==
'''1941: A vacuum tube op-amp.''' An op-amp, defined as a general-purpose, DC-coupled, high gain, inverting feedback [[amplifier]], is first found in {{US patent|2,401,779}} "Summing Amplifier" filed by [[Karl D. Swartzel Jr.]] of Bell Labs in 1941. This design used three [[vacuum tube]]s to achieve a gain of {{nowrap|90 dB}} and operated on voltage rails of {{nowrap|±350 V}}. It had a single inverting input rather than differential inverting and non-inverting inputs, as are common in today's op-amps. Throughout [[World War II]], Swartzel's design proved its value by being liberally used in the M9 [[Director (military)|artillery director]] designed at Bell Labs. This artillery director worked with the SCR584 [[radar]] system to achieve extraordinary hit rates (near 90%) that would not have been possible otherwise.&lt;ref name="Jung-2004"&gt;{{cite book |title=Op Amp Applications Handbook |page=777 |chapter=Chapter 8: Op Amp History |first=Walter G. |last=Jung |publisher=Newnes |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-7506-7844-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dunqt1rt4sAC |accessdate=2008-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:K2-w Vacuum Tube Op-amp.jpg|right|thumb|120px|GAP/R's K2-W: a vacuum-tube op-amp (1953)]]

'''1947: An op-amp with an explicit non-inverting input.''' In 1947, the operational amplifier was first formally defined and named in a paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ragazzini|first1=John R.|author1-link= John R. Ragazzini|last2=Randall|first2=Robert H.|last3=Russell|first3=Frederick A.|title=Analysis of Problems in Dynamics by Electronic Circuits|journal=Proceedings of the IRE|volume=35|issue=5|pages=444–452|publisher=IEEE|date=May 1947|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1697371&amp;tag=1|issn=0096-8390|doi=10.1109/JRPROC.1947.232616}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[John R. Ragazzini]] of Columbia University. In this same paper a footnote mentioned an op-amp design by a student that would turn out to be quite significant. This op-amp, designed by [[Loebe Julie]], was superior in a variety of ways. It had two major innovations. Its input stage used a long-tailed [[triode]] pair with loads matched to reduce drift in the output and, far more importantly, it was the first op-amp design to have two inputs (one inverting, the other non-inverting). The differential input made a whole range of new functionality possible, but it would not be used for a long time due to the rise of the chopper-stabilized amplifier.&lt;ref name="Jung-2004"/&gt;

'''1949: A chopper-stabilized op-amp.''' In 1949, Edwin A. Goldberg designed a [[Chopper (electronics)|chopper]]-stabilized op-amp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.analog.com/library/analogDialogue/archives/39-05/Web_ChH_final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007072916/http://www.analog.com/library/analogDialogue/archives/39-05/Web_ChH_final.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This set-up uses a normal op-amp with an additional [[Alternating current|AC]] amplifier that goes alongside the op-amp. The chopper gets an AC signal from [[Direct current|DC]] by switching between the DC voltage and ground at a fast rate (60&amp;nbsp;Hz or 400&amp;nbsp;Hz). This signal is then amplified, rectified, filtered and fed into the op-amp's non-inverting input. This vastly improved the gain of the op-amp while significantly reducing the output drift and DC offset. Unfortunately, any design that used a chopper couldn't use their non-inverting input for any other purpose. Nevertheless, the much improved characteristics of the chopper-stabilized op-amp made it the dominant way to use op-amps. Techniques that used the non-inverting input regularly would not be very popular until the 1960s when op-amp [[Integrated circuit|IC]]s started to show up in the field.

'''1953: A commercially available op-amp.''' In 1953, vacuum tube op-amps became commercially available with the release of the model K2-W from [[George A. Philbrick]] Researches, Incorporated.  The designation on the devices shown, GAP/R, is an acronym for the complete company name. Two nine-pin [[12AX7]] vacuum tubes were mounted in an octal package and had a model K2-P chopper add-on available that would effectively "use up" the non-inverting input. This op-amp was based on a descendant of Loebe Julie's 1947 design and, along with its successors, would start the widespread use of op-amps in industry.

[[Image:Discrete opamp.png|right|thumb|120px|GAP/R's model P45: a solid-state, discrete op-amp (1961).]]

'''1961: A discrete IC op-amp.''' With the birth of the [[transistor]] in 1947, and the silicon transistor in 1954, the concept of ICs became a reality. The introduction of the [[planar process]] in 1959 made transistors and ICs stable enough to be commercially useful. By 1961, solid-state, discrete op-amps were being produced. These op-amps were effectively small circuit boards with packages such as [[edge connector]]s. They usually had hand-selected resistors in order to improve things such as voltage offset and drift. The P45 (1961) had a gain of 94&amp;nbsp;dB and ran on ±15&amp;nbsp;V rails. It was intended to deal with signals in the range of {{nowrap|±10 V}}.

'''1961: A varactor bridge op-amp.''' There have been many different directions taken in op-amp design. [[Varactor]] bridge op-amps started to be produced in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philbrickarchive.org/|title=The Philbrick Archive|author=|date=|website=www.philbrickarchive.org|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120907192216/http://www.philbrickarchive.org/|archivedate=7 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;June 1961 advertisement for Philbrick P2, {{cite web |url=http://www.philbrickarchive.org/p2%20and%206033%20ad%20rsi%20vol32%20no6%20june1961.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008160503/http://www.philbrickarchive.org/p2%20and%206033%20ad%20rsi%20vol32%20no6%20june1961.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were designed to have extremely small input current and are still amongst the best op-amps available in terms of common-mode rejection with the ability to correctly deal with hundreds of volts at their inputs.

[[Image:Modular opamp.png|right|thumb|120px|GAP/R's model PP65: a solid-state op-amp in a potted module (1962)]]

'''1962: An op-amp in a potted module.''' By 1962, several companies were producing modular potted packages that could be plugged into [[printed circuit board]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} These packages were crucially important as they made the operational amplifier into a single [[black box]] which could be easily treated as a component in a larger circuit.

'''1963: A monolithic IC op-amp.''' In 1963, the first monolithic IC op-amp, the μA702 designed by [[Bob Widlar]] at Fairchild Semiconductor, was released. Monolithic [[Integrated circuit|IC]]s consist of a single chip as opposed to a chip and discrete parts (a discrete IC) or multiple chips bonded and connected on a circuit board (a hybrid IC). Almost all modern op-amps are monolithic ICs; however, this first IC did not meet with much success. Issues such as an uneven supply voltage, low gain and a small dynamic range held off the dominance of monolithic op-amps until 1965 when the μA709&lt;ref&gt;A.P. Malvino, ''Electronic Principles'' (2nd Ed. 1979. {{ISBN|0-07-039867-4}}) p.&amp;nbsp;476.&lt;/ref&gt; (also designed by Bob Widlar) was released.

'''1968: Release of the μA741.''' The popularity of monolithic op-amps was further improved upon the release of the LM101 in 1967, which solved a variety of issues, and the subsequent release of the μA741 in 1968. The μA741 was extremely similar to the LM101 except that Fairchild's facilities allowed them to include a 30&amp;nbsp;pF compensation capacitor inside the chip instead of requiring external compensation. This simple difference has made the 741 ''the'' canonical op-amp and many modern amps base their pinout on the 741s. The μA741 is still in production, and has become ubiquitous in electronics—many manufacturers produce a version of this classic chip, recognizable by part numbers containing ''741''. The same part is manufactured by several companies.

'''1970: First high-speed, low-input current FET design.'''
In the 1970s high speed, low-input current designs started to be made by using [[Field-effect transistor|FET]]s. These would be largely replaced by op-amps made with [[MOSFET]]s in the 1980s. 
[[Image:Hybrid opamp.png|right|thumb|120px|ADI's HOS-050: a high speed hybrid IC op-amp (1979)]]

'''1972: Single sided supply op-amps being produced.''' A single sided supply op-amp is one where the input and output voltages can be as low as the negative power supply voltage instead of needing to be at least two volts above it.  The result is that it can operate in many applications with the negative supply pin on the op-amp being connected to the signal ground, thus eliminating the need for a separate negative power supply.

The LM324 (released in 1972) was one such op-amp that came in a quad package (four separate op-amps in one package) and became an industry standard. In addition to packaging multiple op-amps in a single package, the 1970s also saw the birth of op-amps in hybrid packages. These op-amps were generally improved versions of existing monolithic op-amps. As the properties of monolithic op-amps improved, the more complex hybrid ICs were quickly relegated to systems that are required to have extremely long service lives or other specialty systems.

[[Image:LM741CN.jpg|right|thumb|120px|An op-amp in a mini DIP package]]

'''Recent trends.''' Recently supply voltages in analog circuits have decreased (as they have in digital logic) and low-voltage op-amps have been introduced reflecting this.  Supplies of 5&amp;nbsp;V and increasingly 3.3&amp;nbsp;V (sometimes as low as 1.8&amp;nbsp;V) are common.  To maximize the signal range modern op-amps commonly have rail-to-rail output (the output signal can range from the lowest supply voltage to the highest) and sometimes rail-to-rail inputs. Recent "boomer" amplifiers such as the LM4871 and 8002 also have a shutdown feature, an internal power supply for biasing, and a bypass pin to connect a bypass capacitor for that power supply.

In [[computing]], an optical disc drive (ODD) is a [[disk drive|disc drive]] that uses [[laser]] light or electromagnetic waves within or near the visible [[light spectrum]] as part of the process of reading or writing data to or from [[optical disc]]s. Some drives can only read from certain discs, but recent drives can both read and record, also called burners or writers. [[Compact disc]]s, [[DVD]]s, and [[Blu-ray]] discs are common types of optical media which can be read and recorded by such drives. Optical disc drives that are no longer in production include CD-ROM drive, CD writer drive, combo (CD-RW/DVD-ROM) drive, and DVD writer drive supporting certain recordable and rewritable DVD formats (such as DVD-R(W) only, DVD+R(W) only, DVD-RAM only, and all DVD formats except DVD-R DL). {{As of|2015}}, DVD writer drive supporting all existing recordable and rewritable DVD formats is the most common for desktop PCs and laptops. There are also the DVD-ROM drive, BD-ROM drive, Blu-ray Disc combo (BD-ROM/DVD±RW/CD-RW) drive, and Blu-ray Disc writer drive.

Optical disc drives are an integral part of standalone appliances such as [[CD player]]s, [[DVD player]]s, Blu-ray disc players, [[DVD recorder]]s, certain desktop video game consoles, such as [[Sony PlayStation 4]], [[Microsoft Xbox One]], [[Nintendo Wii U]], and [[Sony PlayStation 3]], and certain portable video game consoles, such as [[Sony PlayStation Portable]]. They are also very commonly used in computers to read software and consumer media distributed on disc, and to record discs for archival and data exchange purposes. [[Floppy disk drive]]s, with capacity of 1.44&amp;nbsp;MB, have been made obsolete: optical media are cheap and have vastly higher capacity to handle the large files used since the days of floppy discs, and the vast majority of computers and much consumer entertainment hardware have optical writers. [[USB flash drive]]s, high-capacity, small, and inexpensive, are suitable where read/write capability is required.

Disc recording is restricted to storing files playable on consumer appliances ([[film]]s, music, etc.), relatively small volumes of data (e.g. a standard DVD holds 4.7&amp;nbsp;[[gigabyte]]s) for local use, and data for distribution, but only on a small scale; mass-producing large numbers of identical discs is cheaper and faster than individual recording.

Optical discs are used to [[backup|back up]] relatively small volumes of data, but backing up of entire hard drives, which {{As of|2015|lc=on}} typically contain many hundreds of gigabytes or even multiple terabytes, is less practical. Large backups are often instead made on external hard drives, as their price has dropped to a level making this viable; in professional environments magnetic [[tape drive]]s are also used.

== History ==

The first laser disc, demonstrated in 1972, was the [[LaserDisc|''Laservision'' 12-inch video disc]]. The video signal was stored as an analog format like a video cassette. The first digitally recorded optical disc was a 5-inch audio [[compact disc]] (CD) in a read-only format created by [[Sony]] and Philips in 1975.&lt;ref name="lintech" /&gt;

The first erasable optical disc drives were announced in 1983, by [[Panasonic|Matsushita]] (Panasonic),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XNxCAQAAIAAJ ''Lasers &amp; Optronics'', Volume 6], page 77&lt;/ref&gt; Sony, and [[KDDI|Kokusai Denshin Denwa]] (KDDI).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pmWoDGkrQJsC&amp;pg=PA30 ''Computerworld'', September 19, 1983, page 30]&lt;/ref&gt; Sony eventually released the first commercial erasable and rewritable 5.25-inch optical disc drive in 1987,&lt;ref name="lintech"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lintech.org/comp-per/12OPDISK.pdf |title=Computer Peripherals - Chapter 12.

The [[CD-ROM]] format was developed by Sony and [[Denon]], introduced in 1984, as an extension of [[Compact Disc Digital Audio]] and adapted to hold any form of digital data. The CD-ROM format has a storage capacity of 650 MB. Also in 1984, Sony introduced a [[LaserDisc]] data storage format, with a larger data capacity of 3.28 [[Gibibyte|GB]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbh1XP4kCT4 Japanese PCs (1984)] (14:24), ''[[Computer Chronicles]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[DVD]] format, developed by [[Panasonic]], Sony, and [[Toshiba]], was released in 1995, and was capable of holding 4.7 GB per layer.

The first [[Blu-Ray]] prototype was unveiled by [[Sony]] in October 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/News/Details.aspx?NewsId=4922 |title=Sony Shows 'DVR-Blue' Prototype |accessdate=October 17, 2007 |date=October 11, 2000 |work=CD R Info}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first commercial recording device was released to market on April 10, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digit-life.com/articles2/blu-ray/ |title=Sony BDZ-S77 Recorder Review |accessdate=October 19, 2007 |first=Maxim |last=Liadov |work=Digit-Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2005, [[TDK]] announced that they had developed an ultra-hard yet very thin polymer coating ("[[Durabis]]") for Blu-ray discs; this was a significant technical advance because better protection was desired for the consumer market to protect bare discs against scratching and damage compared to DVD. Technically Blu-ray Disc also required a thinner layer for the narrower beam and shorter wavelength 'blue' laser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physorg.com/news2615.html |title=Exclusive TDK Durabis Coating Technology Makes Cartridge-Free, Ultra-Durable Blu-ray Discs a Reality |accessdate=October 18, 2007 |date=January 9, 2005 |work=Phys.Org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first BD-ROM players ([[Samsung]] BD-P1000) were shipped in mid-June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2704,1977327,00.asp |title=Samsung Ships the First Blu-ray Player |accessdate=October 17, 2007 |first=Dan |last=Costa |date=June 15, 2006 |work=PCMag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Blu-ray Disc titles were released by [[Sony]] and [[MGM]] on June 20, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluray.highdefdigest.com/news/show/Sony/Disc_Announcements/Sony_Rearranges_Blu-ray_Release_Schedule/107 Sony Rearranges Blu-ray Release Schedule].

==Key components==

=== Laser and optics ===
The most important  part of an optical disc drive is an ''optical path'', placed in a ''pickup head'' (''PUH''),&lt;ref name=dvd&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Jim H. |last1=Taylor |first2=Mark R. |last2=Johnson |first3=Charles G. |last3=Crawford |title=DVD Demystified |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional | year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ikxuL2aX9cAC&amp;pg=PT229 |pages=7–8 |isbn=0-07-142396-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually consisting of a semiconductor [[laser]], a [[lens (optics)|lens]] for focusing the laser beam, and [[photodiode]]s  for detecting the light reflected from the disc's surface.&lt;ref name=cd&gt;{{Cite book |first=Sorin G. |last=Stan |title=The CD-ROM Drive: A Brief System Description |publisher=Springer |year=1998 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gs3pdRb83VcC&amp;pg=PA14 |page=13 |isbn=0-7923-8167-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, CD-type lasers with a [[wavelength]] of 780&amp;nbsp;nm (within the infrared) were used. For DVDs, the wavelength was reduced to 650&amp;nbsp;nm (red color), and for Blu-ray Disc this was reduced even further to 405&amp;nbsp;nm (violet color).

Two main [[servomechanism]]s are used, the first to maintain the proper distance between lens and disc, to ensure the laser beam is focused as a small ''laser spot'' on the disc. The second servo moves the pickup head along the disc's radius, keeping the beam on the ''track'', a continuous spiral data path. Optical disc media are 'read' beginning at the inner radius to the outer edge.

[[File:Optical Disk Drive Sensor.jpeg|alt=The optical sensor out of a CD/DVD drive.|thumb|The optical sensor out of a CD/DVD drive. The two larger rectangles are the photodiodes for pits, the inner one for land. This one also includes amplification and minor processing.]]

On ''read only media'' (ROM), during the manufacturing process the tracks are formed by pressing a thermoplastic resin into a glass 'master' with raised 'bumps' on a flat surface, creating ''pits'' and ''lands'' in the plastic disk. Because the depth of the pits is approximately one-quarter to one-sixth of the laser's wavelength, the reflected beam's phase is shifted in relation to the incoming beam, causing mutual destructive [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] and reducing the reflected beam's intensity. This is detected by photodiodes that create corresponding electrical signals.

An optical disk recorder encodes (also known as burning) data onto a recordable [[CD-R]], [[DVD-R]], [[DVD+R]], or [[BD-R]] disc (called a ''blank'') by selectively heating parts of an organic [[dye]] layer with a laser.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  This changes the reflectivity of the dye, thereby creating marks that can be read like the pits and lands on pressed discs. For recordable discs, the process is permanent and the media can be written to only once. While the reading laser is usually not stronger than 5 [[Watt|mW]], the writing laser is considerably more powerful. The higher the writing speed, the less time a laser has to heat a point on the media, thus its power has to increase proportionally. DVD burners' lasers often peak at about 200&amp;nbsp;mW, either in continuous wave and pulses, although some have been driven up to 400&amp;nbsp;mW before the diode fails.

For rewritable [[CD-RW]], [[DVD-RW]], [[DVD+RW]], [[DVD-RAM]], or [[BD-RE]] media, the laser is used to melt a [[crystal]]line metal [[alloy]] in the recording layer of the disc.  Depending on the amount of power applied, the substance may be allowed to melt back (change the [[phase change disk|phase]] back) into crystalline form or left in an [[amorphous solid|amorphous]] form, enabling marks of varying reflectivity to be created.

''Double-sided'' media may be used, but they are not easily accessed with a standard drive, as they must be physically turned over to access the data on the other side.

''Double layer'' (DL) media have two independent data layers separated by a semi-reflective layer. Both layers are accessible from the same side, but require the optics to change the laser's focus. Traditional ''single layer'' (SL) writable media are produced with a spiral groove molded in the protective [[polycarbonate]] layer (not in the data recording layer), to lead and synchronize the speed of recording head. Double-layered writable media have: a first polycarbonate layer with a (shallow) groove, a first data layer, a semi-reflective layer, a second (spacer) polycarbonate layer with another (deep) groove, and a second data layer. The first groove spiral usually starts on the inner edge and extends outwards, while the second groove starts on the outer edge and extends inwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite image|url=https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/589/original/doublelayer1.gif|title=Cross Section of DVD+R DL Optical Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite image|url=http://www.windowsusers.org/images/Dvd/R_dl.jpg|title=Cross Section of DVD+R DL Optical Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some drives support [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s [[LightScribe]] photothermal printing technology for labeling specially coated discs.

=== Rotational mechanism ===
{{Further information|Disk drive performance characteristics}}
[[File:Comparison disk storage.svg|thumb|left|Comparison of several forms of disk storage showing tracks (not-to-scale); green denotes start and red denotes end.&lt;br &gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Some CD-R(W) and DVD-R(W)/DVD+R(W) recorders operate in ZCLV, CAA or CAV modes.]]
[[File:CDRom.png|thumb|upright|A CD-ROM drive (without case)]]

The rotational mechanism in an optical drive differs considerably from that of a hard disk drive's, in that the latter keeps a [[constant angular velocity]] (CAV), in other words a constant number of [[revolutions per minute]] (RPM). With CAV, a higher [[throughput]] is generally achievable at the outer disc compared to the inner.

On the other hand, optical drives were developed with an assumption of achieving a constant throughput, in CD drives initially equal to 150 [[KiB]]/s. It was a feature important for streaming audio data that always tend to require a constant [[bit rate]]. But to ensure no disc capacity was wasted, a head had to transfer data at a maximum linear rate at all times too, without slowing on the outer rim of disc. This led to optical drives—until recently—operating with a [[constant linear velocity]] (CLV). The spiral ''groove'' of the disc passed under its head at a constant speed. The implication of CLV, as opposed to CAV, is that disc angular velocity is no longer constant, and the spindle motor needed to be designed to vary its speed from between 200&amp;nbsp;RPM on the outer rim and 500&amp;nbsp;RPM on the inner.

Later CD drives kept the CLV paradigm, but evolved to achieve higher rotational speeds, popularly described in multiples of a base speed. As a result, a 4× drive, for instance, would rotate at 800-2000 RPM, while transferring data steadily at 600 KiB/s, which is equal to 4 × 150 KiB/s.

For DVDs, base or 1× speed is 1.385&amp;nbsp;MB/s, equal to 1.32&amp;nbsp;MiB/s, approximately nine times faster than the CD base speed. For Blu-ray drives, base speed is 6.74&amp;nbsp;MB/s, equal to 6.43&amp;nbsp;MiB/s.

[[File:Zone clv.jpg|thumb|The Z-CLV recording pattern is easily visible after burning a DVD-R.]]

Because keeping a constant transfer rate for the whole disc is not so important in most contemporary CD uses, a pure CLV approach had to be abandoned to keep the rotational speed of the disc safely low while maximizing data rate. Some drives work in a partial CLV (PCLV) scheme, by switching from CLV to CAV only when a rotational limit is reached. But switching to CAV requires considerable changes in hardware design, so instead most drives use the [[zoned constant linear velocity]] (Z-CLV) scheme. This divides the disc into several zones, each having its own constant linear velocity. A Z-CLV recorder rated at "52×", for example, would write at 20× on the innermost zone and then progressively increase the speed in several discrete steps up to 52× at the outer rim. Without higher rotational speeds, increased read performance may be attainable by simultaneously reading more than one point of a data groove,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Page | first = M. | title = Kenwood 72× CD-ROM Review | page = 2 | url=http://www.pcstats.com/articleview.cfm?articleid=339&amp;page=2 | accessdate = 2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but drives with such mechanisms are more expensive, less compatible, and very uncommon.

====Limit====
[[File:Exploded CD 04.JPG|thumb|left|An exploded disc]]

Both DVDs and CDs have been known to explode &lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |title=Spinning out of control: Risk of CD explosion |first=Brad |last=Spurgeon |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 11, 2004 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/11/business/worldbusiness/11iht-ptcd_ed3_.html? |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325152833/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/11/business/worldbusiness/11iht-ptcd_ed3_.html |archivedate=March 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; when damaged or spun at excessive speed. This imposes a constraint on the maximum speed (56× for CDs or around 18× in the case of DVDs) at which drives can operate.

===Loading mechanisms===
[[File:Plextor PX-W8432Ti - opening tray manually.webm|thumb|Opening the tray of a CD-RW manually with the help of a paper clip]]
Current optical drives use either a ''tray-loading'' mechanism, where the disc is loaded onto a motorized or manually operated tray, or a ''slot-loading'' mechanism, where the disc is slid into a slot and drawn in by motorized rollers.  With both types of mechanism, if a CD or DVD is left in the drive after the computer is turned off, the disc cannot be ejected using the normal eject mechanism of the drive.  However, tray-loading drives account for this situation by providing a small hole where one can insert a straightened paperclip to manually open the drive tray to retrieve the disc.  Slot-loading optical disc drives have the disadvantages that they cannot usually accept the smaller [[miniDVD|80 mm discs]] (unless 80&amp;nbsp;mm optical disc adapter is used) or any non-standard sizes, usually have no emergency eject hole or eject button, and therefore have to be disassembled if the optical disc cannot be ejected normally.  However, the Nintendo [[Wii]], because of [[backward compatibility]] with [[Nintendo GameCube]] games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/gi_system.jsp?menu=console&amp;submenu=rvl-gi-sys-diff |title=&amp;#124; Wii - General Information: System &amp; Accessories |publisher=Nintendo |date= |accessdate=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[PlayStation 3]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = PlayStation 3 Instruction Manual | page = 50 | url = http://us.playstation.com/support/manuals/manualstermspdf/?pathx=http://www.playstation.com/manual/pdf/CECH-2001A_2001B-2.85_2.pdf | accessdate = 2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; video game consoles are able to load standard size DVDs and 80&amp;nbsp;mm discs in the same slot-loading drive.

A small number of drive models, mostly compact portable units, have a ''top-loading'' mechanism where the drive lid is opened upwards and the disc is placed directly onto the spindle&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = TEAC | title = CD-210PU USB interface portable CD-ROM drive | url=http://www.teac.co.jp/dspd/product/optical/cd-210pu.html | accessdate = 2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for example, all PlayStation One consoles, portable CD players, and some standalone CD recorders all feature top-loading drives). These sometimes have the advantage of using spring-loaded ball bearings to hold the disc in place, minimizing damage to the disc if the drive is moved while it is spun up.

Some early CD-ROM drives used a mechanism where CDs had to be inserted into special cartridges or [[Caddy (hardware)|caddies]], somewhat similar in appearance to a 3.5" [[Floppy drive#The 3½-inch micro floppy diskette|floppy diskette]]. This was intended to protect the disc from accidental damage by enclosing it in a tougher plastic casing, but did not gain wide acceptance due to the additional cost and compatibility concerns—such drives would also inconveniently require "bare" discs to be manually inserted into an openable caddy before use.  [[Ultra Density Optical]] and [[Universal Media Disc]] use optical disc cartridges.

There were also some early CD-ROM drives for desktop PCs in which its tray-loading mechanism will eject slightly and user has to pull out the tray manually to load CD, similar to the tray ejecting method used in internal optical disc drives of modern laptops and modern external slim portable optical disc drives. Like the top-loading mechanism, they have spring-loaded ball bearings on the spindle.

=== Computer interfaces ===
[[Image:Dvd backside.jpg|right|thumb|Digital audio output, analog audio output, and parallel ATA interface.]]
Most internal drives for [[personal computer]]s, [[Server (computing)|server]]s and [[workstation]]s are designed to fit in a standard 5.25" [[drive bay]] and connect to their host via an [[Advanced Technology Attachment|ATA]] or [[SATA]] interface. Additionally, there may be digital and analog outputs for audio. The outputs may be connected via a header cable to the sound card or the motherboard. At one time, computer software resembling [[CD player]]s  controlled playback of the CD. Today the information is [[CD ripping|extracted]] from the disc as data, to be played back or converted to other file formats.

External drives usually have [[USB]] or [[FireWire]] interfaces.  Some portable versions for laptops power themselves from batteries or directly from their interface bus.

Drives with [[SCSI]] interface were made, but they are less common and tend to be more expensive, because of the cost of their interface chipsets, more complex SCSI connectors, and small volume of sales.

When the optical disc drive was first developed, it was not easy to add to computer systems. Some computers such as the IBM PS/2 were standardizing on the 3.5" floppy and 3.5" hard disk, and did not include a place for a large internal device. Also IBM PCs and clones at first only included a single (parallel) [[Parallel ATA|ATA]] drive interface, which by the time the CDROM was introduced, was already being used to support two hard drives. Early laptops simply had no built-in high-speed interface for supporting an external storage device.

[[Image:HP C4381A CD-Writer Plus 7200 Series-4077.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] C4381A CD-Writer Plus 7200 Series'', showing parallel ports to connect between a printer and the computer.]]This was solved through several techniques:
* Early [[sound cards]] could include a CD-ROM drive interface.  Initially, such interfaces were proprietary to each CD-ROM manufacturer.  A sound card could often have two or three different interfaces which are able to communicate with cdrom drive.
* A [[parallel port]] external drive was developed that connected between a printer and the computer. This was slow but an option for laptops.
* A [[PCMCIA]] optical drive interface was also developed for laptops.
* A SCSI card could be installed in desktop PCs for an external SCSI drive enclosure, though SCSI was typically much more expensive than other options.

=== Internal mechanism of a drive ===
[[File:Dismdvd.jpg|thumb|right|Internal mechanism of a DVD-ROM Drive. See text for details.]]

The optical drives in the photos are shown right side up; the disc would sit on top of them. The laser and optical system scans the underside of the disc.

With reference to the top photo, just to the right of image center is the disc motor, a metal cylinder, with a gray centering hub and black rubber drive ring on top. There is a disc-shaped round clamp, loosely held inside the cover and free to rotate; it's not in the photo. After the disc tray stops moving inward, as the motor and its attached parts rise, a magnet near the top of the rotating assembly contacts and strongly attracts the clamp to hold and center the disc. This motor is an "outrunner"-style [[Brushless DC electric motor|brushless DC motor]] which has an external rotor – every visible part of it spins.

Two parallel guide rods that run between upper left and lower right in the photo carry the "[[sled]]", the moving optical read-write head. As shown, this "sled" is close to, or at the position where it reads or writes at the edge of the disc. To move the "sled" during continuous read or write operations, a [[stepper motor]] rotates a leadscrew to move the "sled" throughout its total travel range. The motor, itself, is the short gray cylinder just to the left of the most-distant shock mount; its shaft is parallel to the support rods. The leadscrew is the rod with evenly-spaced darker details; these are the helical grooves that engage a pin on the "sled".

In contrast, the mechanism shown in the second photo, which comes from a cheaply made DVD player, uses less accurate and less efficient brushed [[DC motor]]s to both move the sled and spin the disc. Some older drives use a DC motor to move the sled, but also have a magnetic [[rotary encoder]] to keep track of the position. Most drives in computers use stepper motors.

The gray metal chassis is shock-mounted at its four corners to reduce sensitivity to external shocks, and to reduce drive noise from residual imbalance when running fast. The soft shock mount grommets are just below the brass-colored screws at the four corners (the left one is obscured).

In the third photo, the components under the cover of the lens mechanism are visible. The two permanent magnets on either side of the lens holder as well as the coils that move the lens can be seen. This allows the lens to be moved up, down, forwards, and backwards to stabilize the focus of the beam.

In the fourth photo, the inside of the optics package can be seen. Note that since this is a CD-ROM drive, there is only one laser, which is the black component mounted to the bottom left of the assembly. Just above the laser are the first focusing lens and prism that direct the beam at the disc. The tall, thin object in the center is a half-silvered [[mirror]] that splits the laser beam in multiple directions. To the bottom right of the mirror is the main [[photodiode]] that senses the beam reflected off the disc. Above the main photodiode is a second photodiode that is used to sense and regulate the power of the laser.

The irregular orange material is flexible etched copper foil supported by thin sheet plastic; these are "flexible printed circuits" that connect everything to the electronics (which is not shown).

== Compatibility ==
Most optical drives are backward compatible with their ancestors up to CD, although this is not required by standards.

Compared to a CD's 1.2&amp;nbsp;mm layer of polycarbonate, a DVD's laser beam only has to penetrate 0.6&amp;nbsp;mm in order to reach the recording surface. This allows a DVD drive to focus the beam on a smaller spot size and to read smaller pits. DVD lens supports a different focus for CD or DVD media with same laser.  With the newer Blu-ray disc drives, the laser only has to penetrate 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm of material.  Thus the optical assembly would normally have to have an even greater focus range.  In practice, the Blu-ray optical system is separate from the DVD/CD system.

== Recording performance ==
During the times of CD writer drives, they are often marked with three different speed ratings. In these cases, the first speed is for write-once (R) operations, the second speed for re-write (RW) operations, and the last speed for read-only (ROM) operations. For example, a 40×/16×/48× CD writer drive is capable of writing to CD-R media at speed of 40× (6,000 KB/s), writing to CD-RW media at speed of 16× (2,400 KB/s), and reading from a CD-ROM media at speed of 48× (7,200 KB/s).

During the times of [[combo drive|combo (CD-RW/DVD-ROM) drives]], an additional speed rating (e.g. the 16× in 52×/32×/52×/16×) is designated for DVD-ROM media reading operations.

For DVD writer drives, Blu-ray disc combo drives, and Blu-ray disc writer drives, the writing and reading speed of their respective optical media are specified in its retail box, user's manual, or bundled brochures or pamphlets.

In the late 1990s, [[buffer underrun|''buffer underruns'']] became a very common problem as high-speed CD recorders began to appear in home and office computers, which—for a variety of reasons—often could not muster the I/O performance to keep the data stream to the recorder steadily fed.  The recorder, should it run short, would be forced to halt the recording process, leaving a truncated track that usually renders the disc useless.

In response, manufacturers of CD recorders began shipping drives with "buffer underrun protection" (under various trade names, such as [[Sanyo]]'s [[burn proof|"BURN-Proof"]], [[Ricoh]]'s "JustLink" and [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]]'s "Lossless Link"). These can suspend and resume the recording process in such a way that the gap the stoppage produces can be dealt with by the [[Reed–Solomon error correction|error-correcting]] logic built into CD players and CD-ROM drives.  The first of these drives were rated at 12× and 16×.

While drives are burning DVD+R, DVD+RW and all Blu-ray formats, they do not require any such error correcting recovery as the recorder is able to place the new data exactly on the end of the suspended write effectively producing a continuous track (this is what the DVD+ technology achieved).  Although later interfaces were able to stream data at the required speed, many drives now write in a '[[zoned constant linear velocity]]'.  This means that the drive has to temporarily suspend the write operation while it changes speed and then recommence it once the new speed is attained.  This is handled in the same manner as a buffer underrun.

The internal buffer of optical disc writer drives is: 8 MiB or 4 MiB when recording BD-R, BD-R DL, BD-RE, or BD-RE DL media; 2 MiB when recording DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD-R DL, DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD+RW DL, DVD-RAM, CD-R, or CD-RW media.

== Recording schemes ==
{{See also|Optical disc recording technologies}}

CD recording on personal computers was originally a batch-oriented task in that it required specialised [[optical disc authoring software|authoring software]] to create an "[[disc image|image]]" of the data to record, and to record it to disc in the one session.  This was acceptable for archival purposes, but limited the general convenience of CD-R and CD-RW discs as a [[removable media|removable storage medium]].

[[Packet writing]] is a scheme in which the recorder writes incrementally to disc in short bursts, or packets. Sequential packet writing fills the disc with packets from bottom up. To make it readable in CD-ROM and DVD-ROM drives, the disc can be ''closed'' at any time by writing a final table-of-contents to the start of the disc; thereafter, the disc cannot be packet-written any further. Packet writing, together with support from the [[operating system]] and a [[file system]] like [[Universal Disc Format|UDF]], can be used to mimic random write-access as in media like flash memory and magnetic disks.

Fixed-length packet writing (on CD-RW and DVD-RW media) divides up the disc into padded, fixed-size packets. The padding reduces the capacity of the disc, but allows the recorder to start and stop recording on an individual packet without affecting its neighbours.  These resemble the block-writable access offered by magnetic media closely enough that many conventional file systems will work as-is.  Such discs, however, are not readable in most CD-ROM and DVD-ROM drives or on most operating systems without additional third-party drivers.  The division into packets is not as reliable as it may seem as CD-R(W) and DVD-R(W) drives can only locate data to within a data block.  Although generous gaps (the padding referred to above) are left between blocks, the drive nevertheless can occasionally miss and either destroy some existing data or even render the disc unreadable.

The DVD+RW disc format eliminates this unreliability by embedding more accurate timing hints in the data groove of the disc and allowing individual data blocks (or even bytes) to be replaced without affecting backward compatibility (a feature dubbed "lossless linking"). The format itself was designed to deal with discontinuous recording because it was expected to be widely used in [[digital video recorder]]s.  Many such DVRs use variable-rate video compression schemes which require them to record in short bursts; some allow simultaneous playback and recording by alternating quickly between recording to the tail of the disc whilst reading from elsewhere.  The Blu-ray disc system also encompasses this technology.

[[Mount Rainier (packet writing)|Mount Rainier]] aims to make packet-written CD-RW and DVD+RW discs as convenient to use as that of removable magnetic media by having the firmware format new discs in the background and manage media defects (by automatically mapping parts of the disc which have been worn out by erase cycles to reserve space elsewhere on the disc).  As of February 2007, support for Mount Rainier is natively supported in [[Windows Vista]].  All previous versions of Windows require a third-party solution, as does [[Mac OS X]].

=== Recorder Unique Identifier ===
Owing to pressure from the music industry, as represented by the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry|IFPI]] and [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], [[Philips]] developed the ''Recorder Identification Code'' (RID) to allow media to be uniquely associated with the recorder that has written it. This standard is contained in the [[Rainbow Books]]. The RID-Code consists of a supplier code (e.g. "PHI" for Philips), a model number and the unique ID of the recorder. Quoting Philips, the RID "enables a trace for each disc back to the exact machine on which it was made using coded information in the recording itself. The use of the RID code is mandatory."&lt;ref name="Philips"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Philips | title = Intellectual Property &amp; Standards/Licensing Programs | url=https://www.ip.philips.com/services/?module=IpsLicenseProgram&amp;command=Print&amp;id=20 | accessdate = 2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the RID was introduced for music and video industry purposes, the RID is included on every disc written by every drive, including data and backup discs.  The value of the RID is questionable as it is (currently) impossible to locate any individual recorder due to there being no database.

=== Source IDentification Code ===
The Source IDentification Code (SID) is an eight character supplier code that is placed on optical discs by the manufacturer. The SID identifies not only manufacturer, but also the individual factory and machine that produced the disc.

According to Phillips, the administrator of the SID codes, the SID code provides an optical disc production facility with the means to identify all discs mastered or replicated in its plant, including the specific Laser Beam Recorder (LBR) signal processor or mould that produced a particular stamper or disc.&lt;ref name="Philips" /&gt;

=== Use of RID and SID together in forensics ===
The standard use of RID and SID mean that each disc written contains a record of the machine that produced a disc (the SID), and which drive wrote it (the RID). This combined knowledge may be very useful to law enforcement, to investigative agencies, and to private or corporate investigators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = International Federation of the Phonographic Industry | title = Pocket guide to recognising pirate music products | url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/library/manual-of-guidance-chap3-english.pdf | accessdate = 2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
PSSC Labs was founded in 1984 by Larry Lesser.  In 1998, it manufactured the Aeneas Supercomputer for Dr. Herbert Hamber of the [[University of California, Irvine]] (the physics and astronomy department&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aeneas Supercomputer|url=http://aeneas.ps.uci.edu/aeneas/|publisher=[[University of California at Irvine]]. Department of Physics|accessdate=17 January 2014|author=Herbert W.

In 2001, the company developed CBeST, software packages, utilities and custom scripts used to ease the cluster administration process.&lt;ref name="var"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ingram Micro, PSSC Labs Partner on HPC Products|url=http://thevarguy.com/var-guy/ingram-micro-pssc-labs-partner-hpc-prodcuts|work=The VAR Guy|publisher=[[Penton Media]]|accessdate=17 January 2014|author=Nathan Eddy|date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 the company released the third version of its [[cluster management]] software with support for 32-bit and 64-bit [[AMD]] and [[Intel]] processors, [[Linux kernel]] and other open source tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Sysadmin|title=PSSC Labs Releases CBeST 3.0|year=2003|volume=12|url=https://books.google.by/books?id=UBxAAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22PSSC+Labs%22&amp;dq=%22PSSC+Labs%22&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HEbVUrq2MImTswaK-4CgDw&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBQ|accessdate=17 January 2014|publisher=R&amp;D Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, PSSC Labs demonstrated its new water-cooling technology for high-performance computers at the [[ACM/IEEE Supercomputing Conference]] in [[Seattle, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colossal computers turn on technologists at SC{{!}}05|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2002626267_supercomputing16.html|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|accessdate=18 January 2014|author=Kim Peterson|date=16 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the company focused on supercomputer development for life sciences researchers and announced its technological solution for full-genome data analysis, including assembly, read mapping, and analysis of large amounts of high-throughput [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] sequencing data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= CLC, PSSC Offer New Full-Genome Data Solution|url= http://www.contractpharma.com/contents/view_breaking-news/2010-08-12/clc-pssc-offer-new-full-genome-data-solution-/|work=Contract Pharma Magazine|publisher=Rodman Media|accessdate=18 January 2014|date=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 PSSC Labs designed the Powerserve Quattro I/A 4000 supercomputer for [[Whole genome sequencing|genome sequencing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PSSC Labs Looks to Expand its Reach in the Life Sciences Market with New Hardware Release|url=http://www.genomeweb.com/informatics/pssc-labs-looks-expand-its-reach-life-sciences-market-new-hardware-release|work=BioInform|publisher=Genomeweb LLC|accessdate=17 January 2014|date=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 it released CloudOOP Server Platform for Big Data Analytics / Hadoop Server which offers up to 50TB of storage space in just 1RU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://pssclabs.com/data-center/cloud-computing/big-data/high-density-hadoop-server|title = High density hadoop server|date = |accessdate = 29 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company Joined Cloudera Partner Program the following year and certified the CloudOOP 12000 in 2014 which is compatible with Cloudera Enterprise 5. In the same year MapR started using CloudOOP 12000 platform for record setting time series data base ingestion rate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.mapr.com/blog/loading-time-series-database-100-million-points-second#.VMfn_S6ULyc|title = Loading time series database 100 million points second|date = |accessdate = 29 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the company Joined Hortonworks Partner Program.

In 2015 the company was CloudOOP 12000 certified which is Comaptible with Hortonworks HDP 2.2.

'''Petroleum microbiology''' is a branch of [[microbiology]] that deals with the study of [[microorganism]]s that can metabolize or alter crude or [[Refining|refined]] [[petroleum]] [[Product (chemistry)|products]]. These microorganisms, also called [[hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria|hydrocarbonoclastic]] microorganisms, can degrade hydrocarbons and, include a wide distribution of bacteria, [[methanogenic]] [[archaea]], and some [[fungi]]. Not all hydrocarbonoclasic microbes depend on hydrocarbons to survive, but instead may use petroleum products as alternative carbon and energy sources. Interest in this field is growing due to the increasing role of [[bioremediation]] in oil spill cleanup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://nsdl.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/645/1/PetroleumMicrobiology.pdf|title= Applied Microbiology_Petroleum and Hydrocarbon Microbiology|first1= Anjana|last1= Desai |first2=Pranav|last2= Vyas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1002434330514|title= Microbiology of petroleum reservoirs|first1= Michel|last1= Magot|first2= Bernard|last2=Ollivier|first3= Bharat|last3= K.C.

==Applications==

===Bioremediation===
''''''Bioremediation'''''' of oil contaminated soils, marine waters and [[oil sludge|oily sludge]]s ''in situ'' is a feasible process as hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms are ubiquitous and are able to degrade most compounds in petroleum oil. In the simplest case, indigenous microbial communities can degrade the petroleum where the spill occurs. In more complicated cases, various methods of adding nutrients, air, or exogenous microorganisms to the contaminated site can be applied.&lt;ref name=RAPM_2003&gt;{{cite journal|title=Recent advances in petroleum microbiology.|first1=Van Hamme|last1= JD|first2= Singh|last2= A|first3= Ward|last3= OP.|journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews|year=2003|volume=67|issue=4|pages=503–49|pmid=14665675|pmc=309048|doi=10.1128/mmbr.67.4.503-549.2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, bioreactors involve the application of both natural and additional microorganisms in controlled growth conditions that yields high biodegradation rates and can be used with a wide range of media.&lt;ref name="RAPM_2003"/&gt;

Crude oils are composed of an array of chemical compounds, minor constituents, and trace metals. Making up 50-98% of these petroleum products are hydrocarbons with saturated, unsaturated, or aromatic structures which influence their biodegradability by hydronocarbonclasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oil in the Sea Inputs, Fates, and Effects|date=1985|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington|isbn=978-0-309-07835-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of uptake and biodegradation by these hydrocarbon-oxidizing microbes not only depend on the chemical structure of the substrates, but is limited by biotic and abiotic factors such as temperature, salinity, and nutrient availability in the environment.&lt;ref name="Head"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Head|first1=Ian M.|last2=Jones|first2=D. Martin|last3=Röling|first3=Wilfred F.

==== ''Alcanivorax borkumensis'' ====

A model microorganism studied for its role in bioremediation of oil-spill sites and hydrocarbon catabolism is the alpha-proteobacteria Alcanivorax, which degrades aliphatic alkanes through various metabolic activities.&lt;ref name="Head" /&gt;
Alcanivorax borkumensis utilizes linear hydrocarbon chains in petroleum as its primary energy source under aerobic conditions. When further supplied with sufficient limiting nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphor, it grows and produces surfactant glucolipids to help reduce surface water tension and enhance hydrocarbon uptake.[5] For this reason, nitrates and phosphates are often commercially added to oil-spill sites to engage quiescent populations of A. borkumensis, allowing them to quickly outcompete other microbial populations and become the dominant species in the oil-infested environment.&lt;ref name="Atlas"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atlas|first1=Ronald M.|last2=Hazen|first2=Terry C.|title=Oil Biodegradation and Bioremediation: A Tale of the Two Worst Spills in U.S. History|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|date=15 August 2011|volume=45|issue=16|pages=6709–6715|doi=10.1021/es2013227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cappello"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cappello|first1=Simone|last2=Denaro|first2=Renata|last3=Genovese|first3=Maria|last4=Giuliano|first4=Laura|last5=Yakimov|first5=Michail M.|title=Predominant growth of Alcanivorax during experiments on "oil spill bioremediation" in mesocosms|journal=Microbiological Research|date=April 2007|volume=162|issue=2|pages=185–190|doi=10.1016/j.micres.2006.05.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The addition of rate-limiting nutrients promotes the microbe’s biodegrading pathways, including upregulation of genes encoding multiple alkane hydroxylases that oxidize various lengths of linear alkanes.&lt;ref name="Schneiker"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schneiker|first1=Susanne|last2=dos Santos|first2=Vítor AP Martins|last3=Bartels|first3=Daniela|last4=Bekel|first4=Thomas|last5=Brecht|first5=Martina|last6=Buhrmester|first6=Jens|last7=Chernikova|first7=Tatyana N|last8=Denaro|first8=Renata|last9=Ferrer|first9=Manuel|last10=Gertler|first10=Christoph|last11=Goesmann|first11=Alexander|last12=Golyshina|first12=Olga V|last13=Kaminski|first13=Filip|last14=Khachane|first14=Amit N|last15=Lang|first15=Siegmund|last16=Linke|first16=Burkhard|last17=McHardy|first17=Alice C|last18=Meyer|first18=Folker|last19=Nechitaylo|first19=Taras|last20=Pühler|first20=Alfred|last21=Regenhardt|first21=Daniela|last22=Rupp|first22=Oliver|last23=Sabirova|first23=Julia S|last24=Selbitschka|first24=Werner|last25=Yakimov|first25=Michail M|last26=Timmis|first26=Kenneth N|last27=Vorhölter|first27=Frank-Jörg|last28=Weidner|first28=Stefan|last29=Kaiser|first29=Olaf|last30=Golyshin|first30=Peter N|title=Genome sequence of the ubiquitous hydrocarbon-degrading marine bacterium Alcanivorax borkumensis|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=30 July 2006|volume=24|issue=8|pages=997–1004|doi=10.1038/nbt1232}}&lt;/ref&gt; These enzymes essentially remove the problematic hydrocarbon constituents of petroleum oil while A. borkumensis simutaneously increases synthesis of anionic glucoproteins, which are used to emulsify hydrocarbons in the environment and increase their bioavailability.&lt;ref name="Schneiker" /&gt; The presence of crude oil along with appropriate levels of nitrogen and phosphor catalyzes the removal of petroleum either by mechanisms that enhance the efficiency of substrate uptake or by direct biodegradation of aliphatic chains.

==== Commercial applications ====

Two well-known oil spills exemplify large scale marine bioremediation applications:

In 1989, the [[Exxon Valdez]] ran aground, spilling 41.6 million liters of crude oil, and launching one of the first major bioremediation efforts for an oil spill. Cleanup of Alaskan shorelines relied in part on [[fertilizer]] application to augment bacterial growth.

In 2010, the BP [[Deepwater Horizon]] oil spill released 779 million liters of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. This was the largest oil spill of all time and [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] petroleum microorganisms played a major role in petroleum degradation and cleanup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url= http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es302202c |title= Microbial communities involved in methane production from hydrocarbons in oil sands tailings|first1=Van Siddique|last1= T|first2= Penner|last2= T|first3= Klassen|last3= J|first4= Nesbo|last4=C|first5=Foght|last5=JM|journal= Environmental Science &amp; Technology |year=2012|volume=46|issue=17|pages=9802–10|doi= 10.1021/es302202c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biosurfactants===
These are microbial-synthesized [[Surface-active Substance|surface-active substance]]s that allow for more efficient [[microbial biodegradation]] of hydrocarbons in bioremediation processes. There are two ways by which biosurfactants are involved in bioremediation. (1) Increase the surface area of [[hydrophobic]] water-insoluble substrates. Growth of microbes on hydrocarbons can be limited by available surface area of the water-oil interface. [[Emulsifiers]] produced by microbes can break up oil into smaller droplets, effectively increasing the available surface area. (2) Increase the [[bioavailability]] of hydrophobic water-insoluble substrates. Biosurfactants can enhance the availability of bound substrates by [[desorb]]ing them from surfaces (e.g. soil) or by increasing their apparent solubility. Some biosurfactants have low [[critical micelle concentration]]s (CMCs), a property which increases the apparent solubility of hydrocarbons by sequestering hydrophobic molecules into the centres of [[micelle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Biosurfactants and oil bioremediation.|first1=Ron|last1= EZ|first2= Rosenberg|last2= E|journal= Curr Opin Biotechnol |year=2002|volume=13|issue=3|pages=249–52|pmid=12180101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil Recovery===
[[Microbial enhanced oil recovery]] (MEOR) is a technology in which microbial environments are manipulated to enhance oil recovery. Nutrients are injected ''in situ'' into porous media and indigenous or added microbes promote growth and/or generate products that mobilize oil into producing wells. Alternatively, oil-mobilizing products can be produced by [[fermentation]] and injected into the reservoir. Various products and microorganisms are useful in these applications and each will yield different results. The two general strategies for enhancing oil recovery are altering the surface properties of the interface and using [[bioclogging]] to change the flow behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url= https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-114676-MS

Society of Petroleum Engineers.|first1=Gray|last1=M|first2= Yeung|last2= A|first3= Foght|last3= J|first4= Yarranton|last4= HW|journal= Society of Petroleum Engineers |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biomass]], [[biosurfactants]], [[biopolymers]], [[solvents]], acids, and gases are some of the products that are added to oil reservoirs to enhance recovery.&lt;ref name="RAPM_2003"/&gt;

Technol. |year=1995|volume=51| pages=1–12|doi=10.1016/0960-8524(94)00101-6|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title= Unconventional EOR concepts.|first1= Stosur |last1= GJ |journal= Crit. Rep. Appl. Chem. |year=1991|volume=33| pages=341–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biosensors===
Microbial [[biosensors]] identify and quantify target compounds of interest through interactions with the microbes. For example, bacteria may be used to identify a [[pollutant]] by monitoring their response to the specific chemical. The biosensor system may simply use bacterial growth as a pollutant indicator, or rely on [[gene]]tic [[assays]] wherein a [[reporter gene]] is induced by the chemical.

Many analytical techniques require expensive treatment of soil samples and/or expensive equipment to detect the presence of pollutants. Bacterial biosensor systems offer the potential for cheap, robust detection systems that are selective and highly sensitive. One developed system uses ''[[Pseudomonas fluorescens]]'' HK44 to quantitatively assay for [[naphthalene]] using [[bioluminescence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trögl|first1=Josef|last2=Chauhan|first2=Archana|last3=Ripp|first3=Steven|last4=Layton|first4=Alice C.|last5=Kuncová|first5=Gabriela|last6=Sayler|first6=Gary S.|title=Pseudomonas fluorescens HK44: Lessons Learned from a Model Whole-Cell Bioreporter with a Broad Application History|journal=Sensors|date=6 February 2012|volume=12|issue=2|pages=1544–1571|doi=10.3390/s120201544|pmc=3304127|pmid=22438725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
Often in the process of degrading a pollutant, a microbe can create [[intermediates]] or [[byproducts]] that are also harmful, sometimes even more harmful than the original [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]]. For example, some microbes produce [[hydrogen sulfide]] as a byproduct in the degradation of certain petroleum hydrocarbons and if those gases are not detoxified before escaping the system, they can be released into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url= http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es302202c |title= Microbial communities involved in methane production from hydrocarbons in oil sands tailings|first1=Van Siddique|last1= T|first2= Penner|last2= T|first3= Klassen|last3= J|first4=  Nesbo|last4= C|first5= Foght|last5= JM|journal= Environmental Science &amp; Technology |year=2012|volume=46|issue=17|pages=9802–10|doi= 10.1021/es302202c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biodegradation pathways==
The pathways of degradation of different petroleum products vary depending on the substrate and the microorganism (i.e. aerobic/anaerobic). Specific degradation pathways of many hydrocarbon compounds can be found on the [http://umbbd.ethz.ch/ University of Minnesota Biocatalysis/Biodegradation Database].

The '''Portal of the Folded Wings Shrine to Aviation''' is in [[Los Angeles, California]]. The shrine is a {{convert|75|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} structure of marble, mosaic, and sculpted figures and is the burial site for fifteen pioneers of [[aviation]]. It was built in 1924 as the entrance to Pierce Brothers [[Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery]]. Aviation enthusiast James Gillette was impressed by the rotunda's close proximity to the airport and Lockheed Aircraft Company.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Dedicated to the honored dead of American aviation on the 50th anniversary of powered flight, December 17, 1953, by Lieutenant General Ira C. Eaker [[United States Air Force|USAF]] (retired). Beneath the memorial tablets in this sacred portal rest the cremated remains of famous flyers who contributed so much to the history and development of aviation. The bronze plaques upon the marble walls memorialize beloved Americans who devoted their lives to the advancement of the air age. Administered under the auspices of the [[Walter Brookins|Brookins]]–[[Frank Purdy Lahm|Lahm]]–[[Orville Wright|Wright]] Aeronautical Foundation, this shrine stands as a lasting tribute.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On May 27, 1996, it was rededicated by Dr. Tom Crouch, Chairman of the Aeronautics Department at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portalofthefoldedwings.com/portalhist.html |title=Portal of the Folded Wings Shrine to Aviation |accessdate=2007-09-25 |quote=In 1924, architect Kenneth MacDonald, Jr., and sculptor Federico Giorgi built the Valhalla Memorial Rotunda, a structure now known as The Portal of the Folded Wings&amp;nbsp;— Shrine to Aviation, on the eastern edge of this property.

'''Pyro Mobile''' is a [[video game]] [[video game developer|developer]] based in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], established in 2012 as a merger between Play Wireless and Pyro Studios, most known for its real-time tactics games series, ''[[Commandos (series)|Commandos]]''.

==Pyro Studios==
Pyro Studios was founded in 1996 with the purpose of developing quality video games.&lt;ref name=IGNPlanet51Announce /&gt; The result of this commitment was the development of ''[[Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines]]'', which was released in 1998.&lt;ref name=IGNPlanet51Announce /&gt; The success of this title led to the release of a disk containing new missions entitled ''[[Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty]]''.

In October [[2001 in video gaming|2001]], the [[Microsoft Windows]] version of ''[[Commandos 2: Men of Courage]]'' was launched, followed by its release on [[Xbox (console)|Microsoft Xbox]] and [[PlayStation 2|Sony PlayStation 2]], in September 2002. ''[[Commandos 3: Destination Berlin]]'' was released in October [[2003 in video gaming|2003]]. In total, the ''Commandos'' series has sold more than 5 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name=IGNPlanet51Announce /&gt;

''[[Praetorians (video game)|Praetorians]]'', a [[3-D computer graphics|3D]] [[strategy game]] for Windows set at the time of [[Julius Caesar]]'s campaigns was released in February 2003.

''[[Imperial Glory]]'' was released at the beginning of [[2005 in video gaming|2005]] and its latest offering, ''[[Commandos: Strike Force]]'' released during the first months of 2006, is far more similar to the ''[[Medal of Honor]]'' or ''[[Call of Duty]]'' games than to earlier entries of the series. The game was heavily criticized and sold poorly; this led to the split with the publisher Eidos.

In late 2008, the studio cancelled an Xbox 360 and PS3 game named ''Cops'', laying off 30 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sayed |first=Rashid |title=15 cancelled Xbox 360 games that should have never been cancelled |url=http://gamingbolt.com/15-cancelled-xbox-360-games-that-should-have-never-been-cancelled |accessdate=5 January 2014 |newspaper=Gaming Bolt |date=8 September 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106033118/http://gamingbolt.com/15-cancelled-xbox-360-games-that-should-have-never-been-cancelled |archivedate=6 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Esteve |first=Jaune |title=Cops, el superventas que Pyro canceló |url=http://es.ign.com/blog/4593/cops-el-superventas-que-pyro-cancelo-ps3-xbox360 |accessdate=5 January 2014 |newspaper=IGN Espana |date=21 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106034441/http://es.ign.com/blog/4593/cops-el-superventas-que-pyro-cancelo-ps3-xbox360 |archivedate=6 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Ilion Animation Studios|its sister company]]'s film ''[[Planet 51]]'', Pyro developed the console version of the game, released in November 2009.&lt;ref name=IGNPlanet51Announce&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller |first=Greg |title=Planet 51 Game Details Announced |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/02/25/planet-51-game-details-announced |accessdate=January 5, 2014 |newspaper=IGN |date=February 25, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223050249/http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/02/25/planet-51-game-details-announced |archivedate=February 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Simon|title=FIREBRAND Games Announces Planet 51 The Game On Nintendo DS|url=http://www.peppermintp.co.uk/read.cfm?id=9DA96A63-FAA6-9354-CC9045EB99B07225|accessdate=June 29, 2012|newspaper=Peppermint|date=June 17, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130421102312/http://www.peppermintp.co.uk/read.cfm?id=9DA96A63-FAA6-9354-CC9045EB99B07225|archivedate=April 21, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9760">{{History of science and technology in China}}

During the Mongol-ruled [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368), many scientific and technological advancements were made in areas such as mathematics, medicine, printing technology, and gunpowder warfare.

== Mathematics ==
[[File:Yanghui triangle.gif|thumb|right|A diagram of [[Pascal's triangle]] in [[Zhu Shijie]]'s ''[[Jade Mirror of the Four Unknowns]]'', written in 1303]]
Advances in polynomial algebra were made by mathematicians during the Yuan era. The mathematician [[Zhu Shijie]] (1249–1314) solved [[simultaneous equations]] with up to four unknowns using a rectangular array of coefficients, equivalent to modern [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]].{{sfn|Joseph|2011|p=196}}{{sfn|Dauben|2007|p=344}}  Zhu used a method of elimination to reduce the simultaneous equations to a single equation with only one unknown.{{sfn|Dauben|2007|p=346}} His method is described in the ''[[Jade Mirror of the Four Unknowns]]'', written in 1303. The opening pages contain a diagram of [[Pascal's triangle]]. The summation of a finite arithmetic series is also covered in the book.{{sfn|Ho|1985|p=101}}

[[Guo Shoujing]] applied mathematics to the construction of calendars. He was one of the first mathematicians in China to work on spherical trigonometry.{{sfn|Ho|1985|p=105}} Gou derived a cubic interpolation formula for his astronomical calculations.{{sfn|Joseph|2011|p=247}} His calender, the Shoushi Li (授時暦) or ''Calendar for Fixing the Seasons'', was disseminated in 1281 as the official calendar of the Yuan dynasty.{{sfn|Allsen|2001|p=172}} The calendar may have been influenced solely by the work of [[Song dynasty]] astronomer [[Shen Kuo]] or possibly by the work of Arab astronomers.{{sfn|Ho|1985|p=105}} There are no explicit signs of Muslim influences in the Shoushi calendar, but Mongol rulers were known to be interested in Muslim calendars.{{sfn|Allsen|2001|p=172}}  Mathematical knowledge from the Middle East was introduced to China under the Mongols, and Muslim astronomers brought [[Arabic numerals]] to China in the 13th century.{{sfn|Ho|1985|p=105}}

== Medicine ==
The physicians of the Yuan court came from diverse cultures.{{sfn|Allsen|2001|p=142}} Healers were divided into non-Mongol physicians called ''otachi'' and traditional Mongol shamans. The Mongols characterized ''otachi'' doctors by their use of herbal remedies, which was distinguished from the spiritual cures of Mongol shamanism.{{sfn|Allsen|2001|p=142}}  Physicians received official support from the Yuan government and were given special legal privileges. Kublai created the Imperial Academy of Medicine to manage medical treatises and the education of new doctors.{{sfn|Rossabi|1988|p=125}} Confucian scholars were attracted to the medical profession because it ensured a high income and medical ethics were compatible with Confucian virtues.{{sfn|Allsen|2001|p=157}}{{sfn|Rossabi|1988|p=125}} 

The Chinese medical tradition of the Yuan had "Four Great Schools" that the Yuan inherited from the Jin dynasty. All four schools were based on the same intellectual foundation, but advocated different theoretical approaches toward medicine.{{sfn|Allsen|2001|p=157}} Under the Mongols, the practice of Chinese medicine spread to other parts of the empire. Chinese physicians were brought along military campaigns by the Mongols as they expanded towards the west. Chinese medical techniques such as [[acupuncture]], [[moxibustion]], [[pulse diagnosis]], and various herbal drugs and elixirs were transmitted westward to the Middle East and the rest of the empire.{{sfn|Lane|2005|pp=138–139}} Several medical advances were made in the Yuan period. The physician [[Wei Yilin]] (1277–1347) invented a suspension method for [[Reduction (orthopedic_surgery)|reducing]] dislocated joints, which he performed using anesthetics.{{sfn|Lane|2006|p=140}} The Mongol physician Hu Sihui described the importance of a healthy diet in a 1330 medical treatise.{{sfn|Lane|2006|p=140}}  

Western medicine was also practiced in China by the Nestorian Christians of the Yuan court, where it was sometimes labeled as ''huihui'' or Muslim medicine.{{sfn|Allsen|2001|p=151}} The Nestorian physician Jesus the Interpreter founded the Office of Western Medicine in 1263 during the reign of Kublai.{{sfn|Allsen|2001|p=155}} Huihui doctors staffed at two imperial hospitals were responsible for treating the imperial family and members of the court.{{sfn|Rossabi|1988|p=125}} Chinese physicians opposed Western medicine because its [[Humorism|humoral system]] contradicted the [[yin and yang|yin-yang]] and [[Wu Xing|wuxing]] philosophy underlying traditional Chinese medicine.{{sfn|Allsen|2002|p=157}} No Chinese translation of Western medical works is known, but it is possible that the Chinese had access to [[Avicenna]]'s ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]''.{{sfn|Allsen|2002|p=151}}

== Printing and publishing ==
[[File:Yuan dynasty banknote with its printing plate 1287.jpg|thumb|left|Yuan dynasty [[banknote]] with its printing plate, 1287.]]
[[Image:Chinese movable type 1313-ce.png|thumb|right|A revolving typecase with individual [[movable type]] characters from [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]]'s ''Nong Shu'', published in 1313]]

The Mongol rulers patronized the Yuan printing industry.{{sfn|Allsen|2001|p=182}}{{sfn|Wu|1950|p=460}} Chinese printing technology was transferred to the Mongols through Uighur and Tibetan intermediaries.{{sfn|Allsen|2001|p=182}} Some Yuan documents such as [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]]'s ''Nong Shu'' were printed with earthenware [[movable type]], a technology invented in the 12th century. However, most published works were still produced through traditional [[block printing]] techniques.{{sfn|Allsen|2001|pp=176–177}} The publication of a Taoist text inscribed with the name of [[Töregene Khatun]], Ögedei's wife, is one of the first printed works sponsored by the Mongols. In 1273, the Mongols created the Imperial Library Directorate, a government-sponsored printing office.{{sfn|Allsen|2001|p=182}} The Yuan government established centers for printing throughout China.{{sfn|Allsen|2001|p=182}} Local schools and government agencies were funded to support the publishing of books.{{sfn|Wu|1950|p=463}} 

Private printing businesses also flourished under the Yuan. They published a diverse range of works, and printed educational, literary, medical, religious, and historical texts. The volume of printed materials was vast.{{sfn|Allsen|2001|p=181}} In 1312, 1,000 copies of a Buddhist text commented by Cosgi Odsir were printed just within Beijing.{{sfn|Allsen|2001|p=183}} By 1328, annual sales of printed calendars and almanacs reached over three million in the Yuan dynasty.{{sfn|Allsen|2001|p=184}} 
 
One of the more notable applications of printing technology was the ''[[Chao (currency)|chao]]'', the paper money of the Yuan. Chao were made from the bark of mulberry trees.{{sfn|Allsen|2001|p=183}} The Yuan government used woodblocks to print paper money, but switched to bronze plates in 1275.{{sfn|Allsen|2001|p=179}} The Mongols experimented with establishing the Chinese-style paper monetary system in Mongol-controlled territories outside of China. The Yuan minister [[Bolad]] was sent to Iran, where he explained Yuan paper money to the Il-khanate court of [[Gaykhatu]].{{sfn|Allsen|2001|p=177}} The Il-khanate government issued paper money in 1294, but public distrust of the exotic new currency doomed the experiment.{{sfn|Allsen|2001|p=178}}

The word '''siphon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|aɪ|f|ən}} {{respell|SY|fən}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Oxford Dictionaries|siphon}}&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang-grc|σίφων}} "pipe, tube", also spelled '''syphon''') is used to refer to a wide variety of devices that involve the flow of liquids through tubes. In a narrower sense, the word refers particularly to a tube in an inverted 'U' shape, which causes a liquid to flow upward, above the surface of a reservoir, with no pump, but powered by the fall of the liquid as it flows down the tube under the pull of [[gravity]], then discharging at a level lower than the surface of the reservoir from which it came.

There are two leading theories about how siphons cause liquid to flow uphill, against gravity, without being pumped, and powered only by gravity. The traditional theory for centuries was that gravity pulling the liquid down on the exit side of the siphon resulted in reduced pressure at the top of the siphon. Then atmospheric pressure was able to push the liquid from the upper reservoir, up into the reduced pressure at the top of the siphon, like in a barometer or drinking straw, and then over.&lt;ref name=Ramette/&gt;&lt;ref name=Richert/&gt;&lt;ref name=McGuire/&gt;&lt;ref name=Minor1914/&gt; However, it has been demonstrated that siphons can operate in a vacuum&lt;ref name=Minor1914/&gt;&lt;ref name=Boatwright2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Duane1902&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O44CAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA152&amp;q=duane+siphon+1902|title=Science|first=John|last=Michels|date=15 April 2018|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|accessdate=15 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nokes/&gt; and to heights exceeding the barometric height of the liquid.&lt;ref name=Minor1914/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boatwright2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boatwright|first=A.|last2=Hughes|first2=S.|last3=Barry|first3=J.|date=2015-12-02|title=The height limit of a siphon|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|issue=1|doi=10.1038/srep16790|issn=2045-2322|pmc=4667279|pmid=26628323|page=16790|bibcode=2015NatSR...516790B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AndrewKFletcher&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz9eddGw8vg Siphoning water to 24 meters&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the cohesion tension theory of siphon operation has been advocated, where the liquid is pulled over the siphon in a way similar to the chain model.&lt;ref name=BeadChainSiphon&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ukMId5fIi0 Bead Chain Siphon&lt;/ref&gt; It need not be one theory or the other that is correct, but rather both theories may be correct in different circumstances of ambient pressure.

The [[Banu Musa]] brothers of 9th-century Baghdad invented a double-concentric siphon, which they described in their ''[[Book of Ingenious Devices]]''.&lt;ref name=Hill-21&gt;{{Cite book |title=The book of ingenious devices (Kitāb al-ḥiyal) |author=[[Banu Musa]] |translator=[[Donald Routledge Hill]] |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |year=1979 |isbn=978-90-277-0833-5 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history-science-technology.com/articles/articles+11.html|title=History Of Science And Technology In Islam|website=www.history-science-technology.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The edition edited by Hill includes an analysis of the double-concentric siphon.

Siphons were studied further in the 17th century, in the context of [[suction pump]]s (and the recently developed [[vacuum pump]]s), particularly with an eye to understanding the [[#Maximum height|maximum height]] of pumps (and siphons) and the apparent vacuum at the top of early [[barometer]]s. This was initially explained by [[Galileo Galilei]] via the theory of ''[[Horror vacui (physics)|horror vacui]]'' ("nature abhors a vacuum"), which dates to [[Aristotle]], and which Galileo restated as ''resintenza del vacuo,'' but this was subsequently disproved by later workers, notably [[Evangelista Torricelli]] and [[Blaise Pascal]]&lt;ref name="Calvert-Maxh"&gt;{{Harvp|Calvert|2000}} [http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/fluids/hydstat.htm#Maxh "Maximum height to which water can be raised by a suction pump"]&lt;/ref&gt; – see [[Barometer#History|barometer: history]].

==Theory==
A practical siphon, operating at typical atmospheric pressures and tube heights, works because gravity pulling down on the taller column of liquid leaves reduced pressure at the top of the siphon (formally, [[hydrostatic pressure]] when the liquid is not moving). This reduced pressure at the top means gravity pulling down on the shorter column of liquid is not sufficient to keep the liquid stationary against the atmospheric pressure pushing it up into the reduced pressure zone at the top of the siphon. So the liquid flows from the higher pressure area of the upper reservoir, up to the lower pressure zone at the top of the siphon, over the top, and then with the help of gravity and a taller column of liquid, down to the higher pressure zone at the exit.&lt;ref name=RichertHawaii&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Siphons, Revisited |first1= Alex |last1= Richert |first2= P.-M. |last2= Binder |date=February 2011 |journal= The Physics Teacher |url= http://www.phys.uhh.hawaii.edu/documents/TPT-final.pdf | postscript=, press release: [http://hawaii.edu/news/article.php?aId=4128 Yanking the chain on siphon claims], University of Hawaiʻi at Hilo, 19 January 2011 |doi= 10.1119/1.3543576 |volume= 49 |issue= 2 |pages= 78 |ref= harv |bibcode = 2011PhTea..49...78R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=micolich/&gt;

[[File:ChainModelOfSiphon150Pixels.jpg|thumb|left|The chain model – where the section marked "B" pulls down because it is heavier than the section "A" – is a flawed but useful analogy to the operation of a siphon.]]
The chain model is a useful but not completely accurate conceptual model of a siphon. The chain model helps to understand how a siphon can cause liquid to flow uphill, powered only by the downward force of gravity. A siphon can sometimes be thought of a little like a chain hanging over a pulley, with one end of the chain piled on a higher surface than the other. Since the length of chain on the shorter side is lighter than the length of chain on the taller side, the heavier chain on the taller side will move down and pull up the chain on the lighter side. Similar to a siphon, the chain model is obviously just powered by gravity acting on the heavier side, and there is clearly no violation of conservation of energy, because the chain is ultimately just moving from a higher to a lower location, as the liquid does in a siphon.

[[File:SiphonStillWorksWithBigLeg.svg|thumb|right|Even the falling lighter lower leg from C to D can cause the liquid of the heavier upper leg to flow up and over into the lower reservoir&lt;ref name=Planinsic&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pulley Analogy Does Not Work For Every Siphon|url=http://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/~planinsic/PEM/pulley%20siphon.wmv}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

There are a number of problems with the chain model of a siphon, and understanding these differences helps to explain the actual workings of siphons. First, unlike in the chain model of the siphon, it is not actually the ''weight'' on the taller side compared to the shorter side, that matters. Rather it is the difference in ''height'' from the reservoir surfaces to the top of the siphon, that determines the balance of pressure. For example, if the tube from the upper reservoir to the top of the siphon has a much larger diameter than the taller section of tube from the lower reservoir to the top of the siphon, the shorter upper section of the siphon may have a much larger weight of liquid in it, and yet the lighter volume of liquid in the down tube can pull liquid up the fatter up tube, and the siphon can function normally.&lt;ref name=Planinsic/&gt;

Another difference is that under most practical circumstances, dissolved gases, vapor pressure, and (sometimes) lack of adhesion with tube walls, conspire to render the tensile strength within the liquid ineffective for siphoning. Thus, unlike a chain which has significant tensile strength, liquids usually have little tensile strength under typical siphon conditions, and therefore the liquid on the rising side cannot be pulled up, in the way the chain is pulled up on the rising side.&lt;ref name=Nokes&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nokes |first=M C |year=1948 |url=http://www.mindspring.com/~rwramette/nokes.pdf |title=Vacuum siphons |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729020731/http://www.mindspring.com/~rwramette/nokes.pdf |archive-date=2013-07-29 |journal=School Science Review |volume=29 |page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=micolich/&gt;

[[File:AirLaunchSiphon.ogv|thumbtime=0|thumb |right | Demonstration of siphoning tropical fruit punch with a flying droplet siphon.]]

An occasional misunderstanding of siphons is that they rely on the [[tensile strength]] of the liquid to pull the liquid up and over the rise.&lt;ref name=RichertHawaii/&gt;&lt;ref name=micolich&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_FJe-HdFPw |title=The Great Siphon Definition Debate |accessdate=2010-05-31 }}{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While water has been found to have a great deal of tensile strength in some experiments (such as with the [[z-tube]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Andrew M. |last1=Smith |year=1991 |title=Negative Pressure Generated by Octopus Suckers: A Study of the Tensile Strength of Water in Nature |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=157 |issue=1 |pages=257–271 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/157/1/257 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and siphons in vacuum rely on such cohesion, common siphons can easily be demonstrated to need no liquid tensile strength at all to function.&lt;ref name=Nokes/&gt;&lt;ref name=RichertHawaii/&gt;&lt;ref name=micolich/&gt; Furthermore, since common siphons operate at positive pressures throughout the siphon, there is no contribution from liquid tensile strength, because the molecules are actually repelling each other in order to resist the pressure, rather than pulling on each other.&lt;ref name=Nokes/&gt; To demonstrate, the longer lower leg of a common siphon can be plugged at the bottom and filled almost to the crest with liquid as in Figure 5, leaving the top and the shorter upper leg completely dry and containing only air. When the plug is removed and the liquid in the longer lower leg is allowed to fall, the liquid in the upper reservoir will then typically sweep the air bubble down and out of the tube. The apparatus will then continue to operate as a normal siphon. As there is no contact between the liquid on either side of the siphon at the beginning of this experiment, there can be no cohesion between the liquid molecules to pull the liquid over the rise. It has been suggested by advocates of the liquid tensile strength theory, that the air start siphon only demonstrates the effect as the siphon starts, but that the situation changes after the bubble is swept out and the siphon achieves steady flow. But a similar effect can be seen in the flying droplet siphon of figure 2. The flying droplet siphon works continuously without liquid tensile strength pulling the liquid up. The siphon in the video demonstration operated steadily for more than 28 minutes until the upper reservoir was empty. Another simple demonstration that liquid tensile strength isn't needed in the siphon is to simply introduce a bubble into the siphon during operation. The bubble can be large enough to entirely disconnect the liquids in the tube before and after the bubble, defeating any liquid tensile strength, and yet if the bubble isn't too big, the siphon will continue to operate with little change as it sweeps the bubble out.

Another common misconception about siphons, is that because the atmospheric pressure is virtually identical at the entrance and exit,  the atmospheric pressure cancels, and therefore atmospheric pressure can't be pushing the liquid up the siphon. But equal and opposite forces may not completely cancel if there is an intervening force that counters some or all of one of the forces. In the siphon, the atmospheric pressure at the entrance and exit are both lessened by the force of gravity pulling down the liquid in each tube, but the pressure on the down side is lessened more by the taller column of liquid on the down side. In effect, the atmospheric pressure coming up the down side doesn't entirely "make it" to  the top to cancel all of the atmospheric pressure pushing up the up side. This effect can be seen more easily in the example of two carts being pushed up opposite sides of a hill. As shown in the diagram, even though the person on the left seems to have his push canceled entirely by the equal and opposite push from the person on the right, the person on the left's seemingly canceled push is still the source of the force to push the left cart up.
[[File:OppositeAndEqualForcesNotCancelling.svg|thumbtime=0|thumb |center | 480px | An example of equal and opposite forces that would seem to cancel each other, yet the seemingly cancelled force from the left, still pushes the object up, similar to how the equal and opposite atmospheric pressure at each end of a siphon, that would seem to cancel, leaves atmospheric pressure still able to push the liquid up.]]

In some situations siphons do function in the absence of atmospheric pressure and via tensile strength – see [[#Vacuum siphons|vacuum siphons]] – and in these situations the chain model can be instructive. Further, in other settings water transport does occur via tension, most significantly in [[transpirational pull]] in the [[xylem]] of [[vascular plant]]s.&lt;ref name=RichertHawaii/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hughes |pages=162–166 |first1=Stephen W |volume=45 |year=2010 |title=A practical example of a siphon at work |journal=Physics Education |doi=10.1088/0031-9120/45/2/006 |url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/31098/25/A_practical_example_of_a_siphon_at_work_eprint_(2).pdf |bibcode=2010PhyEd..45..162H |issue=2 |postscript=[http://eprints.qut.edu.au/31098/ A practical example of a siphon at work], supporting website |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524234342/http://eprints.qut.edu.au/31098/25/A_practical_example_of_a_siphon_at_work_eprint_%282%29.pdf |archivedate=2015-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Water and other liquids may seem to have no tensile strength because 
when a handful is scooped up and pulled on, the liquids narrow and pull 
apart effortlessly. But liquid tensile strength in a siphon is possible 
when the liquid adheres to the tube walls and thereby resists narrowing. Any contamination on the tube
walls, such as grease or air bubbles, or other minor influences such as
turbulence or vibration, can cause the liquid to detach from the walls 
and lose all tensile strength.

In more detail, one can look at how the [[hydrostatic pressure]] varies through a static siphon, considering in turn the vertical tube from the top reservoir, the vertical tube from the bottom reservoir, and the horizontal tube connecting them (assuming a U-shape). At liquid level in the top reservoir, the liquid is under atmospheric pressure, and as one goes up the siphon, the hydrostatic pressure decreases (under [[vertical pressure variation]]), since the weight of atmospheric pressure pushing the water up is counterbalanced by the column of water in the siphon pushing down (until one reaches the maximum height of a barometer/siphon, at which point the liquid cannot be pushed higher) – the hydrostatic pressure at the top of the tube is then lower than atmospheric pressure by an amount proportional to the height of the tube. Doing the same analysis on the tube rising from the lower reservoir yields the pressure at the top of that (vertical) tube; this pressure is lower because the tube is longer (there is more water pushing down), and requires that the lower reservoir is lower than the upper reservoir, or more generally that the discharge outlet simply be lower than the surface of the upper reservoir. Considering now the horizontal tube connecting them, one sees that the pressure at the top of the tube from the top reservoir is higher (since less water is being lifted), while the pressure at the top of the tube from the bottom reservoir is lower (since more water is being lifted), and since liquids move from high pressure to low pressure, the liquid flows across the horizontal tube from the top basin to the bottom basin. Note that the liquid is under positive pressure (compression) throughout the tube, not tension.

Bernoulli's equation is considered in the scientific literature to be a fair approximation to the operation of the siphon. In non-ideal fluids, compressibility, tensile strength and other characteristics of the working fluid (or multiple fluids) complicate Bernoulli's equation.

Once started, a siphon requires no additional [[energy]] to keep the liquid flowing up and out of the reservoir. The siphon will draw liquid out of the reservoir until the level falls below the intake, allowing air or other surrounding gas to break the siphon, or until the outlet of the siphon equals the level of the reservoir, whichever comes first.

In addition to [[atmospheric pressure]], the [[density]] of the liquid, and [[gravity of Earth|gravity]], the [[#Maximum height|maximum height]] of the [[crest (physics)|crest]] in practical siphons is limited by the [[vapour pressure]] of the liquid. When the pressure within the liquid drops to below the liquid's vapor pressure, tiny vapor bubbles can begin to form at the high point and the siphon effect will end. This effect depends on how efficiently the liquid can [[nucleate]] bubbles; in the absence of impurities or rough surfaces to act as easy nucleation sites for bubbles, siphons can temporarily exceed their standard maximum height during the extended time it takes bubbles to nucleate. One siphon of degassed water was demonstrated to 24 meters for an extended period of time&lt;ref name=AndrewKFletcher/&gt; and other controlled experiments to 10 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boatwright |first1=A. |last2=Hughes |first2=S. |last3=Barry |first3=J. |title=The height limit of a siphon |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date=2 December 2015 |doi=10.1038/srep16790 |url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep16790 |accessdate=27 January 2016 |volume=5 |pages=16790 |bibcode = 2015NatSR...516790B |pmid=26628323 |pmc=4667279}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[water]] at [[standard atmospheric pressure]], the maximum siphon height is approximately 10 [[metre|m]] (32 [[foot (length)|feet]]); for [[mercury (element)|mercury]] it is 76&amp;nbsp;cm (30 [[inch]]es), which is the definition of standard pressure. This equals the maximum height of a [[suction pump]], which operates by the same principle.&lt;ref name="Calvert-Maxh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvert-Siph"&gt;{{Harvp|Calvert|2000}} [http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/fluids/hydstat.htm#Siph "The siphon"]&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio of heights (about 13.6) equals the ratio of densities of water and mercury (at a given temperature), since the column of water (resp. mercury) is balancing with the column of air yielding atmospheric pressure, and indeed maximum height is (neglecting vapor pressure and velocity of liquid) inversely proportional to density of liquid.

==Modern research into the operation of the siphon==
In 1948, [[Malcolm Nokes]] investigated siphons working in both [[air pressure]] and in a [[partial vacuum]], for siphons in vacuum he concluded that: "The gravitational force on the column of liquid in the downtake tube less the gravitational force in the uptake tube causes the liquid to move. The liquid is therefore in tension and sustains a longitudinal strain which, in the absence of disturbing factors, is insufficient to break the column of liquid". But for siphons of small uptake height working at atmospheric pressure, he concluded that: "... the tension of the liquid column is neutralized and ''reversed'' by the compressive effect of the atmosphere on the opposite ends of the liquid column."&lt;ref name=Nokes/&gt;

Potter and Barnes at the [[University of Edinburgh]] revisited siphons in 1971. They re-examined the theories of the siphon and ran experiments on siphons in air pressure. Their conclusion was that; "By now  it should be  clear that, despite a wealth of tradition,  the basic  mechanism of a  siphon does not depend  upon  atmospheric pressure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Potter|first1=A.|last2=Barnes|first2=F.H.|title=The siphon|journal=Physics Education |date=1 September 1971|volume=6|issue=5|pages=362–366|doi=10.1088/0031-9120/6/5/005|bibcode=1971PhyEd...6..362P}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gravity]], [[pressure]] and molecular [[cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion]] were the focus of work in 2010 by Hughes at the [[Queensland University of Technology]]. He used siphons at air pressure and his conclusion was that: "The flow of water out of the bottom of a siphon depends on the difference in height between the inflow and outflow, and therefore cannot be dependent on atmospheric pressure…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Stephen W.|title=A practical example of a siphon at work|journal=Physics Education|date=1 March 2010|volume=45|issue=2|pages=162–166|doi=10.1088/0031-9120/45/2/006|bibcode=2010PhyEd..45..162H}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hughes did further work on siphons at air pressure in 2011 and concluded that: "The experiments described above demonstrate that ordinary siphons at atmospheric pressure operate through gravity and not atmospheric pressure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Stephen W.|title=The secret siphon|journal=Physics Education|date=May 2011|volume=46|issue=3|pages=298–302|doi=10.1088/0031-9120/46/3/007|bibcode=2011PhyEd..46..298H}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The father and son researchers, Ramette and Ramette, successfully siphoned [[carbon dioxide]] under air pressure in 2011 and concluded that molecular cohesion is not required for the operation of a siphon but that: "The basic explanation of siphon action is that, once the tube is filled, the flow is initiated by the greater pull of gravity on the fluid on the longer side compared with that on the short side. This creates a pressure drop throughout the siphon tube, in the same sense that 'sucking' on a straw reduces the pressure along its length all the way to the intake point. The ambient atmospheric pressure at the intake point responds to the reduced pressure by forcing the fluid upwards, sustaining the flow, just as in a steadily sucked straw in a milkshake."&lt;ref name=Ramette&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramette|first1=Joshua J.|last2=Ramette|first2=Richard W.|title=Siphonic concepts examined: a carbon dioxide gas siphon and siphons in vacuum|journal=Physics Education|date=July 2011|volume=46|issue=4|pages=412–416|doi=10.1088/0031-9120/46/4/006|bibcode=2011PhyEd..46..412R}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Again in 2011, Richert and Binder (at the [[University of Hawaii]]) examined the siphon and concluded that molecular cohesion is not required for the operation of a siphon but relies upon gravity and a pressure differential, writing: "As the fluid initially primed on the long leg of the siphon rushes down due to gravity, it leaves behind a partial vacuum that allows pressure on the entrance point of the higher container to push fluid up the leg on that side".&lt;ref name=Richert&gt;http://www.phys.uhh.hawaii.edu/documents/TPT-final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The research team of Boatwright, Puttick, and Licence, all at the [[University of Nottingham]], succeeded in running a siphon in [[vacuum|high vacuum]], also in 2011. They wrote that: "It is widely believed that the siphon is principally driven by the force of atmospheric pressure. An experiment is described that shows that a siphon can function even under high-vacuum conditions. Molecular cohesion and gravity are shown to be contributing factors in the operation of a siphon; the presence of a positive atmospheric pressure is not required".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ed2001818 | volume=88 | issue=11 | title=Can a Siphon Work In Vacuo? | journal=Journal of Chemical Education | pages=1547–1550 | last1 = Boatwright | first1 = Adrian L.| bibcode=2011JChEd..88.1547B | year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in [[Physics Today]] in 2011, J. Dooley from [[Millersville University]] stated that both a pressure differential within the siphon tube and the [[tensile strength]] of the liquid are required for a siphon to operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1063/PT.3.1199|title = Siphoning—a weighty topic|journal = Physics Today|volume = 64|issue = 8|pages = 10|year = 2011|last1 = Dooley|first1 = John W|bibcode = 2011PhT....64h..10D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A researcher at [[Humboldt State University]], A. McGuire, examined flow in siphons in 2012. Using the advanced general-purpose multiphysics simulation software package [[LS-DYNA]] he examined pressure initialisation, flow, and pressure propagation within a siphon. He concluded that: "Pressure, gravity and molecular cohesion can all be driving forces in the operation of siphons".&lt;ref name=McGuire&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reu.eng.hawaii.edu/harp/sites/reu.eng.hawaii.edu.harp/files/mcguire_finalpresentation.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505104828/http://reu.eng.hawaii.edu/harp/sites/reu.eng.hawaii.edu.harp/files/mcguire_finalpresentation.pdf |archivedate=2014-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Hughes and Gurung (at the Queensland University of Technology), ran a water siphon under varying air pressures ranging from sea level to 11.9&amp;nbsp;km ({{val|39000|u=ft}}) altitude. They noted that: "Flow remained more or less constant during ascension indicating that siphon flow is independent of ambient [[barometric pressure]]". They used [[Bernoulli's equation]] and the [[Poiseuille equation]] to examine pressure differentials and fluid flow within a siphon. Their conclusion was that: "It follows from the above analysis that there must be a direct cohesive connection between water molecules flowing in and out of a siphon. This is true at all atmospheric pressures in which the pressure in the apex of the siphon is above the vapour pressure of water, an exception being ionic liquids".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/srep/2014/140422/srep04741/pdf/srep04741.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical requirements==
A plain tube can be used as a siphon. An external [[pump]] has to be applied to start the liquid flowing and ''prime'' the siphon (in home use this is often done by a person inhaling through the tube until enough of it has filled with liquid; note this may pose danger to the user, depending on the liquid that is being siphoned). This is sometimes done with any leak-free hose to siphon [[gasoline]] from a motor vehicle's gasoline tank to an external tank. (Siphoning gasoline by mouth often results in the accidental swallowing of gasoline, or [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspirating]] it into the lungs, which can cause death or lung damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Material Safety Data Sheet for MidGrade Unleaded Gasoline |date=28 November 2006 |url=http://www.marathonpetroleum.com/content/documents/mpc/msds/0125MAR019.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528041420/http://www.marathonpetroleum.com/content/documents/mpc/msds/0125MAR019.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) If the tube is flooded with liquid before part of the tube is raised over the intermediate high point and care is taken to keep the tube flooded while it is being raised, no pump is required. Devices sold as siphons often come with a ''siphon [[pump]]'' to start the siphon process.

In some applications it can be helpful to use siphon tubing that is not much larger than necessary. Using piping of too great a diameter and then throttling the flow using valves or constrictive piping appears to increase the effect of previously cited concerns over gases or vapor collecting in the crest which serve to break the vacuum. If the vacuum is reduced too much, the siphon effect can be lost. Reducing the size of pipe used closer to requirements appears to reduce this effect and creates a more functional siphon that does not require constant re-priming and restarting. In this respect, where the requirement is to match a flow into a container with a flow out of said container (to maintain a constant level in a pond fed by a stream, for example) it would be preferable to utilize two or three smaller separate parallel pipes that can be started as required rather than attempting to use a single large pipe and attempting to throttle it.

=== Automatic intermittent siphon ===
Siphons are sometimes employed as automatic machines, in situations where it is desirable to turn a continuous trickling flow or an irregular small surge flow into a large surge volume. A common example of this is a public restroom with urinals regularly flushed by an automatic siphon in a small water tank overhead. When the container is filled, all the stored liquid is released, emerging as a large surge volume that then resets and fills again. One way to do this intermittent action involves complex machinery such as floats, chains, levers, and valves, but these can corrode, wear out, or jam over time. An alternate method is with rigid pipes and chambers, using only the water itself in a siphon as the operating mechanism.

A siphon used in an automatic unattended device needs to be able to function reliably without failure. This is different from the common demonstration self-starting siphons in that there are ways the siphon can fail to function which require manual intervention to return to normal surge flow operation.

The most common failure is for the liquid to dribble out slowly, matching the rate that the container is filling, and the siphon enters an undesired steady-state condition. Preventing dribbling typically involves pneumatic principles to trap one or more large air bubbles in various pipes, which are sealed by water traps. This method can fail if it can't start working intermittently without water already present in parts of the mechanism, and which will not be filled if the mechanism starts from a dry state.

A second problem is that the trapped air pockets will shrink over time if the siphon is not operating due to no inflow.  The air in pockets is absorbed by the liquid, which pulls liquid up into the piping until the air pocket disappears, and can cause activation of water flow outside the normal range of operating when the storage tank is not full, leading to loss of the liquid seal in lower parts of the mechanism.

A third problem is where the lower end of the liquid seal is simply a U-trap bend in an outflow pipe. During vigorous emptying, the kinetic motion of the liquid out the outflow can propel too much liquid out, causing a loss of the sealing volume in the outflow trap and loss of the trapped air bubble to maintain intermittent operation.

A fourth problem involves seep holes in the mechanism, intended to slowly refill these various sealing chambers when the siphon is dry. The seep holes can be plugged by debris and corrosion, requiring manual cleaning and intervention. To prevent this, the siphon may be restricted to pure liquid sources, free of solids or precipitate.

Many automatic siphons have been invented going back to at least the 1850s, for automatic siphon mechanisms that attempt to overcome these problems using various pneumatic and hydrodynamic principles.

== Applications and terminology ==

[[File:Siphoning.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Siphoning the beer after a first [[Beer fermentation|fermentation]]]]
When certain liquids needs to be purified, siphoning can help prevent either the bottom ([[Sediment#Dregs|dregs]]) or the top ([[foam]] and floaties) from being transferred out of one container into a new container. Siphoning is thus useful in the [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]] of wine and beer for this reason, since it can keep unwanted impurities out of the new container.

Self-constructed siphons, made of pipes or tubes, can be used to evacuate water from cellars after floodings. Between the flooded cellar and a deeper place outside a connection is built, using a tube or some pipes. They are filled with water through an intake valve (at the highest end of the construction). When the ends are opened, the water flows through the pipe into the sewer or the river.

[[Image:StGeorgeCottonIrrig.jpg|thumb|left|Siphon irrigation of cotton at [[St George, Queensland]].]]
Siphoning is common in irrigated fields to transfer a controlled amount of water from a ditch, over the ditch wall, into furrows.

Large siphons may be used in municipal [[waterworks]] and industry. Their size requires control via valves at the intake, outlet and crest of the siphon. The siphon may be primed by closing the intake and outlets and filling the siphon at the crest. If intakes and outlets are submerged, a [[vacuum pump]] may be applied at the crest to prime the siphon. Alternatively the siphon may be primed by a pump at either the intake or outlet. Gas in the liquid is a concern in large siphons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sti.srs.gov/fulltext/tr2000066/tr2000066.html |title=Siphons for Geosiphon Treatment Systems |publisher=sti.srs.gov |accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gas tends to accumulate at the crest and if enough accumulates to break the flow of liquid, the siphon stops working. The siphon itself will exacerbate the problem because as the liquid is raised through the siphon, the pressure drops, causing dissolved gases within the liquid to come out of solution. Higher temperature accelerates the release of gas from liquids so maintaining a constant, low temperature helps. The longer the liquid is in the siphon, the more gas is released, so a shorter siphon overall helps. Local high points will trap gas so the intake and outlet legs should have continuous slopes without intermediate high points. The flow of the liquid moves bubbles thus the intake leg can have a shallow slope as the flow will push the gas bubbles to the crest. Conversely, the outlet leg needs to have a steep slope to allow the bubbles to move against the liquid flow; though other designs call for a shallow slope in the outlet leg as well to allow the bubbles to be carried out of the siphon. At the crest the gas can be trapped in a chamber above the crest. The chamber needs to be occasionally primed again with liquid to remove the gas.

=== Siphon rain gauge ===
A ''siphon rain gauge'' is a [[rain gauge]] that can record rainfall over an extended period. A siphon is used to automatically empty the gauge. It is often simply called a "siphon gauge" and is not to be confused with a siphon pressure gauge.

=== Siphon spillway ===
A siphon [[spillway]] in a dam is usually not technically a siphon as it is generally used to drain elevated water levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vl-irrigation.org/cms/index.php?id=440&amp;type=7 |title=Siphon spillway - automatically starting siphons |last=Smith |first=W.B. |date=29 July 2005 |website=www.vl-irrigation.org |accessdate=15 April 2018 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602083724/http://www.vl-irrigation.org/cms/index.php?id=440&amp;type=7 |archive-date=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a siphon spillway operates as an actual siphon if it raises the flow higher than the  surface of the source reservoir, as sometimes is the case when used in irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2008/11/26/2429797.htm|title=Lake Bonney refill underway|date=26 November 2008|website=www.abc.net.au|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://eprints.qut.edu.au/31098/32/Lake__Bonney_siphon_and_embankment1.JPG&lt;/ref&gt; In operation, a siphon spillway is considered to be 'pipe flow' or 'closed duct flow'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tamuc.edu/academics/colleges/scienceengineeringagriculture/departments/engineeringTechnology/documents/safety/Hm16036e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A normal spillway flow is pressurized by the height of the reservoir above the spillway whereas a siphon flow rate is governed by the difference in height of the inlet and outlet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idosi.org/wasj/wasj14%288%2911/20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Some designs make use of an automatic system that uses the flow of water in a spiral vortex to remove the air above to prime the siphon. Such a design includes the volute siphon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rao| first= Govinda NS |year=2008| title= Design of Volute Siphon| journal=Journal of the Indian Institute of Science|volume=88 |issue=3|pages=915–930| url=http://eprints.iisc.ernet.in/21165/1/REPRINTS_100.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flush toilet ===
[[Flush toilet]]s often have some siphon effect as the bowl empties.

Some toilets also use the siphon principle to obtain the actual flush from the [[cistern]]. The flush is triggered by a lever or handle that operates a simple diaphragm-like piston pump that lifts enough water to the crest of the siphon to start the flow of water which then completely empties the contents of the cistern into the toilet bowl. The advantage of this system was that no water would leak from the cistern excepting when flushed. These were mandatory in the [[UK]] until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenbuildingstore.co.uk/page--siphon-vs-valve-debate.html|title=Siphon vs valve flush - Information Hub|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early [[Urinal (restroom)|urinals]] incorporated a siphon in the cistern which would flush automatically on a regular cycle because there was a constant trickle of clean water being fed to the cistern by a slightly open valve.

== Devices that are not true siphons ==

=== Siphon coffee ===
{{main article|Siphon coffee}}
[[File:Vakumpot north.svg|thumb|Siphon coffee brewer: when warmed by a heat source (A), vapor pressure increases in the lower chamber (B), forcing the water downwards (C) and through the central pipe into the upper chamber (D) where it is mixed with the coffee grounds. When the heat is removed, the water flows back down.]]
While if both ends of a siphon are at atmospheric pressure, liquid flows from high to low, if the bottom end of a siphon is pressurized, liquid can flow from low to high. If pressure is removed from the bottom end, the liquid flow will reverse, illustrating that it is pressure driving the siphon. An everyday illustration of this is the [[siphon coffee]] brewer, which works as follows (designs vary; this is a standard design, omitting coffee grounds):
* a glass vessel is filled with water, then corked (so air-tight) with a siphon sticking vertically upwards
* another glass vessel is placed on top, open to the atmosphere – the top vessel is empty, the bottom is filled with water
* the bottom vessel is then heated; as the temperature increases, the [[vapor pressure]] of the water increases (it increasingly evaporates); when the water boils the vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure, and as the temperature increases above boiling the pressure in the bottom vessel then ''exceeds'' atmospheric pressure, and pushes the water up the siphon tube into the upper vessel.
* a small amount of still hot water and steam remain in the bottom vessel and are kept heated, with this pressure keeping the water in the upper vessel
* when the heat is removed from the bottom vessel, the vapor pressure decreases, and can no longer support the column of water – gravity (acting on the water) and atmospheric pressure then push the water back into the bottom vessel.
In practice, the top vessel is filled with coffee grounds, and the heat is removed from the bottom vessel when the coffee has finished brewing. What vapor pressure means concretely is that the boiling water converts high-density water (a liquid) into low-density steam (a gas), which thus expands to take up more volume (in other words, the pressure increases). This pressure from the expanding steam then forces the liquid up the siphon; when the steam then condenses down to water the pressure decreases and the liquid flows back down.

=== Siphon pump ===
While a simple siphon cannot output liquid at a level higher than the source reservoir, a more complicated device utilizing an airtight metering chamber at the crest and a system of automatic valves, may discharge liquid on an ongoing basis, at a level higher than the source reservoir, without outside pumping energy being added. It can accomplish this despite what initially appears to be a violation of conservation of energy because it can take advantage of the energy of a large volume of liquid dropping some distance, to raise and discharge a small volume of liquid above the source reservoir. Thus it might be said to "require" a large quantity of falling liquid to power the dispensing of a small quantity. Such a system typically operates in a cyclical or start/stop but ongoing and self-powered manner.&lt;ref name=SiphonPumpPatent&gt;{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US136809A/en|title=Improvement in siphon-pumps|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NewerSiphonPumpPatent&gt;{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US5358000A/en|title=Siphon pump having a metering chamber|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ram pump]]s do not work in this way. These metering pumps are true siphon pumping devices which use siphons as their power source.

===Inverted siphon===
{{see also|Trap (plumbing)}}
[[File:Annotated plumbing trap.jpg|thumb|right|Water seal under a sink. Inverted siphoning occurs below the line "A".]]
An ''inverted siphon'' is not a siphon but a term applied to pipes that must dip below an obstruction to form a "U" shaped flow path.

Large inverted siphons are used to convey water being carried in [[canal]]s or [[flume]]s across valleys, for irrigation or gold mining. The Romans used inverted siphons of multiple lead pipes to cross valleys that were too big to construct an [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romanaqueducts.info/picturedictionary/pd_onderwerpen/siphon.htm|title=Aqua Clopedia, a picture dictionary of Roman aqueducts: Siphons|website=www.romanaqueducts.info|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/forum/index.php?topic=7636.0|title=Inverted syphon of the roman aqueducts - Naked Science Forum|website=www.thenakedscientists.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romanaqueducts.info/siphons/siphons.htm|title=Siphons in Roman (and Hellenistic) aqueducts|website=www.romanaqueducts.info|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Inverted siphons'' are commonly called traps for their function in preventing smelly [[sewer gas]]es from coming back out of drains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askthebuilder.com/sewer-odors-in-bathroom/|title=Sewer Odors in Bathroom - Ask the Builder|first=Tim|last=Carter|date=26 January 2017|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes making dense objects like rings and electronic components retrievable after falling into a drain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plumbing.about.com/od/drains/a/Drain-Trap-What-Is-The-Purpose-Of-A-Drain-Trap.htm|title=Drain Traps Are Protection Against Sewer Gas|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aconcordcarpenter.com/how-to-retrieve-an-item-dropped-down-a-sink-drain.html|title=How To Retrieve An Item Dropped Down A Sink Drain - A Concord Carpenter|website=www.aconcordcarpenter.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liquid flowing in one end simply forces liquid up and out the other end, but solids like sand will accumulate. This is especially important in [[sewage]] systems or [[culvert]]s which must be routed under rivers or other deep obstructions where the better term is "depressed sewer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lmnoeng.com/Channels/InvertedSiphon.htm|title=Inverted Siphon.

===Back siphonage===
''Back siphonage'' is a plumbing term applied to the reversal of normal water flow in a plumbing system due to sharply reduced or negative pressure on the [[water supply]] side, such as high demand on water supply by [[fire-fighting]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grimsby.ca/Water-FAQ-Backflow-Prevention/what-is-back-siphonage-and-its-causes.html|title=What is back-siphonage and its causes? - Water FAQ Backflow Prevention - Water / Wastewater - Operations Centre|first=Wing|last=Poo|website=www.grimsby.ca|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is not an actual siphon as it is [[suction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.ky.gov/DRINKINGWATER/Pages/BackflowBacksiphonage.aspx|title=Drinking Water - Backflow and Backsiphonage|website=water.ky.gov|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Back siphonage is rare as it depends on submerged inlets at the outlet (home) end and these are uncommon.&lt;ref name="water.epa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.epa.gov/infrastructure/drinkingwater/pws/crossconnectioncontrol/upload/2003_04_09_crossconnection_chapter03.pdf|title=Information about Public Water Systems - US EPA|first=US|last=EPA,OW,OGWDW|website=US EPA|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back siphonage is not to be confused with [[backflow (plumbing)|backflow]]; which is the reversed flow of water from the outlet end to the supply end caused by pressure occurring at the outlet end.&lt;ref name="water.epa.gov"/&gt;

===Anti-siphon valve===
[[Building code]]s often contain specific sections on back siphonage and especially for external [[faucet]]s (See the sample building code quote, below). [[Backflow prevention device]]s such as ''anti-siphon valves''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toiletology.com/anti-sph.shtml |title=Toiletology ... Anti-siphon needs an explanation |publisher=www.toiletology.com |accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; are required in such designs. The reason is that external faucets may be attached to hoses which may be immersed in an external body of water, such as a [[garden pond]], [[swimming pool]], [[aquarium]] or [[washing machine]]. In these situations the flow is not actually a siphon but suction due to reduced pressure on the water supply side. Should the pressure within the water supply system fall, the external water may be returned by back pressure into the drinking water system through the faucet. Another possible contamination point is the water intake in the toilet tank. An anti-siphon valve is also required here to prevent pressure drops in the water supply line from suctioning water out of the toilet tank (which may contain additives such as "toilet blue"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleaningshop.com.au/contents/en-us/d1569.html |title=Toilet Blue Loo - Sweet Lu |publisher=CLEANERS SUPERMARKET® Pty, Ltd. |website=www.cleaningshop.com.au |accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and contaminating the water system. Anti-siphon valves function as a one-direction [[check valve]].

Anti-siphon valves are also used medically. [[Hydrocephalus]], or excess fluid in the brain, may be treated with a [[Shunt (medical)|shunt]] which drains [[cerebrospinal fluid]] from the brain. All shunts have a valve to relieve excess pressure in the brain. The shunt may lead into the abdominal cavity such that the shunt outlet is significantly lower than the shunt intake when the patient is standing. Thus a siphon effect may take place and instead of simply relieving excess pressure, the shunt may act as a siphon, completely draining cerebrospinal fluid from the brain. The valve in the shunt may be designed to prevent this siphon action so that negative pressure on the drain of the shunt does not result in excess drainage. Only excess positive pressure from within the brain should result in drainage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tokoro |first1=Kazuhiko |last2=Chiba |first2=Yasuhiro |last3=Abe |first3=Hiroyuki |last4=Tanaka |first4=Nobumasa |last5=Yamataki |first5=Akira |last6=Kanno |first6=Hiroshi |title=Importance of anti-siphon devices in the treatment of pediatric hydrocephalus |journal=Child's Nervous System |volume=10 |pages=236–8 |year=1994 |doi=10.1007/BF00301160 |issue=4 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Hydrocephalus and Shunts in the Person with Spina Bifida |publisher=Spina Bifida Association of America |year=2009 |url=http://www.spinabifidaassociation.org/site/c.liKWL7PLLrF/b.2725875/k.BDDF/Hydrocephalus_and_Shunts_in_the_Person_with_Spina_Bifida.htm |accessdate=9 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728044900/http://www.spinabifidaassociation.org/site/c.liKWL7PLLrF/b.2725875/k.BDDF/Hydrocephalus_and_Shunts_in_the_Person_with_Spina_Bifida.htm |archivedate=28 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zemack |first1=Göran |last2=Romner |first2=Bertil |title=Seven-year clinical experience with the Codman Hakim programmable valve: a retrospective study of 583 patients |journal=Neurosurgical Focus |volume=7 |pages=941–8 |year=1999 |doi=10.3171/foc.1999.7.4.11 |issue=4 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the anti-siphon valve in medical shunts is preventing excess forward flow of liquid. In plumbing systems, the anti-siphon valve is preventing backflow.

====Other anti-siphoning devices====
Along with anti-siphon valves, ''anti-siphoning devices'' also exist. The two are unrelated in application. Siphoning can be used to remove fuel from tanks. With the cost of fuel increasing, it has been linked in several countries to the rise in [[fuel theft]]. Trucks, with their large fuel tanks, are most vulnerable. The anti-siphon device prevents thieves from inserting a tube into the fuel tank.

===Siphon barometer===
A ''siphon barometer'' is the term sometimes applied to the simplest of mercury [[barometer]]s. A continuous U-shaped tube of the same diameter throughout is sealed on one end and filled with mercury. When placed into the upright, "U", position, mercury will flow away from the sealed end, forming a partial vacuum, until balanced by atmospheric pressure on the other end. The term "siphon" derives from the belief that air pressure is involved in the operation of a siphon. The difference in height of the fluid between the two arms of the U-shaped tube is the same as the maximum intermediate height of a siphon. When used to measure pressures other than atmospheric pressure, a siphon barometer is sometimes called a ''siphon gauge''; these are not siphons but follow a standard 'U'-shaped design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wika.com.au/910_15_en_co.WIKA|title=Pressure gauge syphon - 910.15 - WIKA Australia|website=www.wika.com.au|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the term. Siphon barometers are still produced as precision instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leybold-shop.com/siphon-barometer-31714.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105103433/http://www.leybold-shop.com/siphon-barometer-31714.html |archivedate=2015-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Siphon barometers should not be confused with a siphon rain gauge.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.axinum.com/FAQ.htm|title=THE SIPHONING RAIN GAUGE|website=www.axinum.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siphon bottle===
[[File:Siphon bottles.jpg|thumb|Siphon bottles]]
A ''siphon bottle'' (also called a ''[[soda syphon]]'' or, archaically, a ''siphoid''&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://voronoi.ics.uci.edu/cgi-bin/Dict?Form=Dict2&amp;Database=*&amp;Query=siphoid&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a pressurized bottle with a vent and a valve. It is not a siphon as pressure within the bottle drives the liquid up and out a tube. A special form was the ''[[gasogene]]''.

===Siphon cup===
A ''siphon cup'' is the (hanging) reservoir of paint attached to a spray gun, it is not a siphon as a vacuum pump extracts the paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/donsairbrushtips/gravity-or-siphon|title=Gravity or Siphon? - Don's Airbrush Tips|website=sites.google.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name is to distinguish it from gravity-fed reservoirs. An archaic use of the term is a cup of oil in which the oil is transported out of the cup via a cotton wick or tube to a surface to be lubricated, this is not a siphon but an example of [[capillary action]].

===Heron's siphon===
''Heron's siphon'' is not a siphon as it works as a gravity driven pressure pump,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physics.kenyon.edu/EarlyApparatus/Fluids/Heros_Fountain/Heros_Fountain.html |title=Hero's Fountain |first=Thomas B. |last=Greenslade, Jr. |website=physics.kenyon.edu |accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xcdsystem.com/iie2014/abstract/finalpapers/i835.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; at first glance it appears to be a [[perpetual motion]] machine but will stop when the air in the priming pump is depleted. In a slightly differently configuration, it is also known as [[Heron's fountain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=physics/0310039v1 |last1=Kezerashvili |first1=R. Ya. |last2=Sapozhnikov |first2=A. |title=Magic Fountain |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venturi siphon===
A [[venturi effect|venturi]] siphon, also known as an [[Aspirator (pump)|eductor]], is not a siphon but a form of [[vacuum pump]] using the [[Venturi effect]] of fast flowing [[fluid]]s (e.g. air), to produce low pressures to [[suction]] other fluids; a common example is the [[carburetor]]. See [[pressure head]]. The low pressure at the throat of the venturi is called a siphon when a second fluid is introduced, or an [[aspirator (pump)|aspirator]] when the fluid is air, this is an example of the misconception that air pressure is the operating force for siphons.

===Siphonic roof drainage===
Despite the name, siphonic roof drainage does not work as a siphon; the technology makes use of gravity induced vacuum pumping&lt;ref name="siphonic.com.au"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siphonic.com.au/downloads/Siphonic%20Brochure.pdf |title=Siphonic Solutions design and contract |accessdate=2015-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227094830/http://siphonic.com.au/downloads/Siphonic%20Brochure.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to carry water horizontally from multiple roof drains to a single downpipe and to increase flow velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fullflow.com/pages/syphonic-explained/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105132500/http://www.fullflow.com/pages/syphonic-explained/ |archivedate=2015-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Metal baffles at the roof drain inlets reduce the injection of air which increases the efficiency of the system.&lt;ref name="w3.unisa.edu.au"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w3.unisa.edu.au/researcher/issue/2006May/story3.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910155535/http://w3.unisa.edu.au/researcher/issue/2006May/story3.asp |archivedate=2014-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One benefit to this drainage technique is reduced [[capital cost]]s in construction compared to traditional roof drainage.&lt;ref name="siphonic.com.au"/&gt;  Another benefit is the elimination of pipe pitch or gradient required for conventional roof drainage piping. However this system of gravity pumping is mainly suitable for large buildings and is not usually suitable for residential properties.&lt;ref name="w3.unisa.edu.au"/&gt;

=== Self-siphons ===
The term ''self-siphon'' is used in a number of ways. Liquids that are composed of long polymers can "self-siphon"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/demobook/chapter6.htm |title=Physics Demonstrations - Light |publisher=sprott.physics.wisc.edu |accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chem.soton.ac.uk/schools/ks3/docs/poly.pdf School of Chemistry]. Chem.soton.ac.uk. Retrieved on 11 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and these liquids do not depend on atmospheric pressure. Self-siphoning polymer liquids work the same as the siphon-chain model where the lower part of the chain pulls the rest of the chain up and over the crest. This phenomenon is also called a ''tubeless siphon''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/nnf/research/phenomena/Demos.pdf Tubeless Siphon and Die Swell Demonstration], Christopher W. MacMinn &amp; Gareth H. McKinley, 26 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

"Self-siphon" is also often used in sales literature by siphon manufacturers to describe portable siphons that contain a pump. With the pump, no external suction (e.g. from a person's mouth/lungs) is required to start the siphon and thus the product is described as a "self-siphon".

If the upper reservoir is such that the liquid there can rise above the height of the siphon crest, the rising liquid in the reservoir can "self-prime" the siphon and the whole apparatus be described as a "self-siphon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grow.arizona.edu/water/pressure/siphon.shtml |title=Siphon |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040602031245/http://www.grow.arizona.edu/water/pressure/siphon.shtml |archive-date=2004-06-02 |website=Grow.arizona.edu |access-date=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once primed, such a siphon will continue to operate until the level of the upper reservoir falls below the intake of the siphon. Such self-priming siphons are useful in some [[rain gauge]]s and dams.

==In nature==

=== Anatomy ===
The term "siphon" is used for a number of structures in human and animal anatomy, either because flowing liquids are involved or because the structure is shaped like a siphon, but in which no actual siphon effect is occurring: see [[Siphon (disambiguation)]].

There has been a debate if whether the siphon mechanism plays a role in [[blood]] [[Circulatory system|circulation]]. However, in the 'closed loop' of circulation this was discounted; "In contrast, in 'closed' systems, like the circulation, gravity does not hinder uphill flow nor does it cause downhill flow, because gravity acts equally on the ascending and descending limbs of the circuit", but for "historical reasons", the term is used.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.descsite.nl/Publications/Thesis/Gisolf/Gisolf_Chap1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ajpregu.physiology.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/ajpregu/289/2/R627.full.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202142016/http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/ajpregu/289/2/R627.full.pdf |archive-date=2016-02-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One hypothesis (in 1989) was that a siphon existed in the circulation of the [[giraffe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 2916707 | volume=256 | issue=2 Pt 2 | title=Siphon mechanism in collapsible tubes: application to circulation of the giraffe head | date=February 1989 | journal=Am. J. Physiol. | pages=R567–71 | last1 = Hicks | first1 = JW | last2 = Badeer | first2 = HS| doi=10.1152/ajpregu.1989.256.2.R567 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But further research in 2004 found that, "There is no hydrostatic gradient and since the 'fall' of fluid does not assist the ascending arm, there is no siphon. The giraffe’s high arterial pressure, which is sufficient to raise the blood 2 m from heart to head with sufficient remaining pressure to perfuse the brain, supports this concept."&lt;ref name="ajpregu.physiology.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 2890463 | volume=88 | issue=2 | title=Blood flow uphill and downhill: does a siphon facilitate circulation above the heart? | year=1987 | journal=Comp Biochem Physiol a Comp Physiol | pages=167–70 | doi=10.1016/0300-9629(87)90465-8 | last1 = Seymour | first1 = RS | last2 = Johansen | first2 = K}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a paper written in 2005 urged more research on the hypothesis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The principle of the siphon is not species specific and should be a fundamental principle of closed circulatory systems. Therefore, the controversy surrounding the role of the siphon principle may best be resolved by a comparative approach. Analyses of blood pressure on a variety of long-necked and long-bodied animals, which take into account phylogenetic relatedness, will be important. In addition experimental studies that combined measurements of arterial and venous blood pressures, with cerebral blood flow, under a variety of gravitational stresses (different head positions), will ultimately resolve this controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/ajpregu/289/2/R629.full.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305011754/http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/ajpregu/289/2/R629.full.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Species===
Some species are named after siphons because they resemble siphons in whole or in part.  [[Geosiphon]]s are [[fungi]].  There  are species of alga belonging to the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Siphonocladaceae]] in the [[phylum]] [[Chlorophyta]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aigara_Alves/publication/260247798_Flora_da_Bahia_Siphonocladaceae/links/0a85e5342e37eb90b3000000.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which have tube-like structures. ''[[Ruellia villosa]]'' is a tropical plant in the [[Acanthaceae]] family that is also known by the [[botanical synonym]], '''Siphonacanthus villosus'' [[Nees]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://florabrasiliensis.cria.org.br/search?taxon_id=20627|title=Flora brasiliensis, CRIA|website=florabrasiliensis.cria.org.br|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geology ===
{{main article|sump (cave)}}
In speleology, a siphon or a sump is that part of a cave passage that lies under water and through which cavers have to dive to progress further into the [[cave system]], it is not an actual siphon.

=== Kayaking ===
In canoe watersport "siphon" is called the life-dangerous situation that a part of the waterflow of a river flows underneath a stone or somewhat else and can dangerously suck in a paddler and his boat. Both can clog or stick to the entering orifice of that flow. Similar is a [[Whitewater#Seives|seive]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1F3UdEQnxQ Guardian Angel Falls 2008 - Siphon] youtube.com, 1 August 2008, 20 February 2017. – Low water makes the siphon visuable.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation using Bernoulli's equation==
[[Bernoulli's equation]] may be applied to a siphon to derive the flow rate and maximum height of the siphon.
[[File:Syphoning2.svg|thumb|right|Example of a siphon with annotations to describe [[#Explanation using Bernoulli's equation|Bernoulli's equation]]]]
:Let the surface of the upper reservoir be the reference elevation.
:Let point A be the start point of siphon, immersed within the higher reservoir and at a depth −''d'' below the surface of the upper reservoir.
:Let point B be the intermediate high point on the siphon tube at height +''h''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; above the surface of the upper reservoir.
:Let point C be the drain point of the siphon at height −''h''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; below the surface of the upper reservoir.

Bernoulli's equation:
: &lt;math&gt; {v^2 \over 2}+gy+{P \over \rho}=\mathrm{constant} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;v \;&lt;/math&gt; = fluid [[velocity]] along the streamline
: &lt;math&gt;g \;&lt;/math&gt; = [[standard gravity|gravitational acceleration downwards]]
: &lt;math&gt;y \;&lt;/math&gt; = [[elevation]] in [[gravity]] field
: &lt;math&gt;P \;&lt;/math&gt; = [[pressure]] along the streamline
: &lt;math&gt;\rho \;&lt;/math&gt; = fluid [[density]]

Apply Bernoulli's equation to the surface of the upper reservoir. The surface is technically falling as the upper reservoir is being drained. However, for this example we will assume the reservoir to be [[Infinity|infinite]] and the velocity of the surface may be set to zero. Furthermore, the pressure at both the surface and the exit point C is atmospheric pressure. Thus:

:&lt;math&gt;{0^2 \over 2}+g(0)+{P_\mathrm{atm} \over \rho}=\mathrm{constant} &lt;/math&gt; (Equation 1.)

Apply Bernoulli's equation to point A at the start of the siphon tube in the upper reservoir where ''P'' = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v'' = ''v''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y'' = −''d''

:&lt;math&gt;{v_A^2 \over 2}-gd+{P_A \over \rho}=\mathrm{constant} &lt;/math&gt; (Equation 2.)

Apply Bernoulli's equation to point B at the intermediate high point of the siphon tube where ''P'' = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v'' = ''v''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y'' = ''h''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{v_B^2 \over 2}+gh_B+{P_B \over \rho}=\mathrm{constant} &lt;/math&gt; (Equation 3.)

Apply Bernoulli's equation to point C where the siphon empties. Where ''v'' = ''v''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y'' = −''h''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, the pressure at the exit point is atmospheric pressure. Thus:

:&lt;math&gt;{v_C^2 \over 2}-gh_C+{P_\mathrm{atm} \over \rho}=\mathrm{constant} &lt;/math&gt; (Equation 4.)

===Velocity===
As the siphon is a single system, the constant in all four equations is the same. Setting equations 1 and 4 equal to each other gives:

:&lt;math&gt;{0^2 \over 2}+g(0)+{P_\mathrm{atm} \over \rho}={v_C^2 \over 2}-gh_C+{P_\mathrm{atm} \over \rho}&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for ''v''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;:

:'''Velocity of siphon:'''

:&lt;math&gt;v_C=\sqrt{2gh_C}&lt;/math&gt;

The velocity of the siphon is thus driven solely by the height difference between the surface of the upper reservoir and the drain point. The height of the intermediate high point, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, does not affect the velocity of the siphon. However, as the siphon is a single system, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = ''v''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; and the intermediate high point does limit the maximum velocity. The drain point cannot be lowered indefinitely to increase the velocity. Equation 3 will limit the velocity to a positive pressure at the intermediate high point to prevent [[cavitation]]. The maximum velocity may be calculated by combining equations 1 and 3:

:&lt;math&gt;{0^2 \over 2}+g(0)+{P_\mathrm{atm} \over \rho}={v_B^2 \over 2}+gh_B+{P_B \over \rho}&lt;/math&gt;

Setting ''P''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and solving for ''v''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;:

:'''Maximum velocity of siphon:'''
:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{max}=\sqrt{2\left({P_\mathrm{atm} \over \rho}-gh_B\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

The depth, −''d'', of the initial entry point of the siphon in the upper reservoir, does not affect the velocity of the siphon. No limit to the depth of the siphon start point is implied by Equation 2 as pressure ''P''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; increases with depth ''d''. Both these facts imply the operator of the siphon may bottom skim or top skim the upper reservoir without impacting the siphon's performance.

Note that this equation for the velocity is the same as that of any object falling height ''h''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. Note also that this equation assumes ''P''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; is atmospheric pressure. If the end of the siphon is below the surface, the height to the end of the siphon cannot be used; rather the height difference between the reservoirs should be used.

===Maximum height===
Although siphons can exceed the barometric height of the liquid in special circumstances, e.g. when the liquid is degassed and the tube is clean and smooth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz9eddGw8vg |title=Water Flowing Up 24 meters Not Magic, Just Science! Gravity of Life (Part3) | accessdate=30 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in general the practical maximum height can be found as follows.

Setting equations 1 and 3 equal to each other gives:

:&lt;math&gt;{0^2 \over 2}+g(0)+{P_\mathrm{atm} \over \rho}={v_B^2 \over 2}+gh_B+{P_B \over \rho} &lt;/math&gt;

Maximum height of the intermediate high point occurs when it is so high that the pressure at the intermediate high point is zero; in typical scenarios this will cause the liquid to form bubbles and if the bubbles enlarge to fill the pipe then the siphon will "break". Setting ''P''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = 0:

:&lt;math&gt;{P_\mathrm{atm} \over {\rho}}={v_B^2 \over 2}+gh_B&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for ''h''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;:

:'''General height of siphon:'''

:&lt;math&gt;h_B={P_\mathrm{atm} \over \rho g} - {v_B^2 \over 2g}.&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the height of the intermediate high point is limited by pressure along the streamline being always greater than zero.

:'''Maximum height of siphon:'''
:&lt;math&gt;h_{B\mathrm{,max}}={P_\mathrm{atm} \over \rho g}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the maximum height that a siphon will work. Substituting values will give approximately 10 metres for water and, by definition of [[standard pressure]], 0.76 metres ({{convert|760|mm|disp=or|abbr=on}}) for mercury. The ratio of heights (about 13.6) equals the ratio of densities of water and mercury (at a given temperature).   Note that as long as this condition is satisfied (pressure greater than zero), the flow at the output of the siphon is still only governed by the height difference between the source surface and the outlet. Volume of fluid in the apparatus is not relevant as long as the pressure head remains above zero in every section.  Because pressure drops when velocity is increased, a static siphon (or manometer) can have a slightly higher height than a flowing siphon.

==Vacuum siphons==
{{Expand section|1=explanation of theory of operation|date=December 2012}}

Experiments have shown that siphons can operate in a vacuum, via [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion]] and [[tensile strength]] between molecules, provided that the liquids are pure and degassed and surfaces are very clean.&lt;ref name=Minor1914&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Would_a_siphon_flow_in_a_vacuum_experimental_answers.pdf |title=Would a Siphon Flow in a Vacuum!

==''Oxford English Dictionary''==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) entry on ''siphon'', published in 1911, states that a siphon works by [[atmospheric pressure]]. Stephen Hughes of [[Queensland University of Technology]] criticized this in a 2010 article&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt; which was widely reported in the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.qut.edu.au/cgi-bin/WebObjects/News.woa/wa/goNewsPage?newsEventID=32323 QUT physicist corrects Oxford English Dictionary ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aolnews.com/world/article/oxford-english-dictionary-got-siphon-definition-wrong-for-99-years/19472844 |title=AOL News, For 99 Years, Oxford English Dictionary Got It Wrong |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514143935/http://www.aolnews.com/world/article/oxford-english-dictionary-got-siphon-definition-wrong-for-99-years/19472844 |archive-date=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/books/dictionary-mistake-goes-unnoticed-for-99-years-20100510-uoh2.html |last=Calligeros |first=Marissa |title=Dictionary mistake goes unnoticed for 99 years |work=Brisbane Times |date=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/7709513/Physicist-spots-99-year-old-mistake-in-Oxford-English-Dictionary.html |last=Malkin |first=Bonnie |title=Physicist spots 99-year-old mistake in Oxford English Dictionary |work=The Daily Telegraph (London) |date=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OED editors stated, "there is continuing debate among scientists as to which view is correct. ...

&lt;blockquote&gt;A tube used to convey liquid upwards from a reservoir and then down to a lower level of its own accord. Once the liquid has been forced into the tube, typically by suction or immersion, flow continues unaided.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] currently describes a siphon as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Siphon, also spelled syphon,  instrument, usually in the form of a tube bent to form two legs of unequal length, for conveying liquid over the edge of a vessel and delivering it at a lower level. Siphons may be of any size. The action depends upon the influence of gravity (not, as sometimes thought, on the difference in atmospheric pressure; a siphon will work in a vacuum) and upon the cohesive forces that prevent the columns of liquid in the legs of the siphon from breaking under their own weight. At sea level, water can be lifted a little more than 10 metres (33 feet) by a siphon.

In civil engineering, pipelines called inverted siphons are used to carry sewage or stormwater under streams, highway cuts, or other depressions in the ground. In an inverted siphon the liquid completely fills the pipe and flows under pressure, as opposed to the open-channel gravity flow that occurs in most sanitary or storm sewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/546445/siphon|title=Siphon - instrument|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Thermoelectric effect|cTopic=Applications}}
A '''thermocouple''' is an electrical device consisting of two dissimilar [[Electrical conductor|electrical conductors]] forming [[electrical junction]]s at differing [[temperature]]s. A thermocouple produces a temperature-dependent [[voltage]] as a result of the [[thermoelectric effect]], and this voltage can be interpreted to measure temperature. Thermocouples are a widely used type of [[list of temperature sensors|temperature sensor]].&lt;ref name="tcs_html"&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.temperatures.com/tcs.html |work=Temperatures.com |title=Thermocouple temperature sensors |accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial thermocouples are inexpensive,&lt;ref name="Ramsden2000"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ramsden, Ed |date=September 1, 2000 |title=Temperature measurement |journal=Sensors |url=http://www.sensorsmag.com/sensors/temperature/temperature-measurement-1030 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; interchangeable, are supplied with standard connectors, and can measure a wide range of temperatures. In contrast to most other methods of temperature measurement, thermocouples are self powered and require no external form of excitation. The main limitation with thermocouples is accuracy; system errors of less than one degree [[Celsius]] (°C) can be difficult to achieve.&lt;ref name="tctable.html"&gt;{{cite web |title=Technical Notes: Thermocouple Accuracy |work=IEC 584-2(1982)+A1(1989) |url=http://www.microlink.co.uk/tctable.html |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermocouples are widely used in science and industry. Applications include temperature measurement for [[kiln]]s, [[gas turbine]] exhaust, [[diesel engine]]s, and other industrial processes. Thermocouples are also used in homes, offices and businesses as the temperature sensors in thermostats, and also as flame sensors in [[Pilot light#Safety protection|safety devices]] for gas-powered appliances.

==Principle of operation==

In 1821, the [[Germany|German]] physicist [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]] discovered that when different metals are joined at the ends and there is a temperature difference between the joints, a magnetic field is observed. At the time, Seebeck referred to this consequence as thermo-magnetism. The magnetic field he observed was later shown to be due to thermo-electric current. In practical use, the voltage generated at a single junction of two different types of wire is what is of interest as this can be used to measure temperature at very high and low temperatures. The magnitude of the voltage depends on the types of wire being used. Generally, the voltage is in the microvolt range and care must be taken to obtain a usable measurement. Although very little current flows, power can be generated by a single thermocouple junction. Power generation using multiple thermocouples, as in a [[thermopile]], is common.

[[File:Thermocouple circuit Ktype including voltmeter temperature.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|[[Thermocouple#Type K|K-type]] thermocouple ([[chromel]]–[[alumel]]) in the standard thermocouple measurement configuration. The measured voltage &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle V&lt;/math&gt; can be used to calculate temperature &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T_\mathrm{sense}&lt;/math&gt;, provided that temperature &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T_\mathrm{ref}&lt;/math&gt; is known.]]

The standard configuration for thermocouple usage is shown in the figure.
Briefly, the desired temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;sense&lt;/sub&gt; is obtained using three inputs—the characteristic function ''E''(''T'') of the thermocouple, the measured voltage ''V'', and the reference junctions' temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;.
The solution to the equation ''E''(''T''&lt;sub&gt;sense&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''V'' + ''E''(''T''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;) yields ''T''&lt;sub&gt;sense&lt;/sub&gt;.
These details are often hidden from the user since the reference junction block (with ''T''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; thermometer), voltmeter, and equation solver are combined into a single product.

===Physical principle: Seebeck effect===

{{main article|Seebeck effect}}

The Seebeck effect refers to an [[electromotive force]] whenever there is a temperature gradient in a conductive material.
Under open-circuit conditions where there is no internal current flow, the [[gradient]] of voltage (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \boldsymbol \nabla V&lt;/math&gt;) is directly proportional to the gradient in temperature (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \boldsymbol \nabla T&lt;/math&gt;):
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \nabla V  =  -S(T) \boldsymbol \nabla T,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;S(T)&lt;/math&gt; is a temperature-dependent [[material property]] known as the [[Seebeck coefficient]].

The standard measurement configuration shown in the figure shows four temperature regions and thus four voltage contributions:
# Change from &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T_\mathrm{meter}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T_\mathrm{ref}&lt;/math&gt;, in the lower copper wire.
# Change from &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T_\mathrm{ref}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T_\mathrm{sense}&lt;/math&gt;, in the alumel wire.
# Change from &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T_\mathrm{sense}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T_\mathrm{ref}&lt;/math&gt;, in the chromel wire.
# Change from &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T_\mathrm{ref}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T_\mathrm{meter}&lt;/math&gt;, in the upper copper wire.

The first and fourth contributions cancel out exactly, because these regions involve the same temperature change and an identical material.
As a result, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T_\mathrm{meter}&lt;/math&gt; does not influence the measured voltage.
The second and third contributions do not cancel, as they involve different materials.

The measured voltage turns out to be
:&lt;math&gt;V = \int_{T_\mathrm{ref}}^{T_\mathrm{sense}} \left( S_{+}(T) - S_{-}(T) \right) \, dT,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S_{+}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S_{-}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Seebeck coefficient]]s of the conductors attached to the positive and negative terminals of the voltmeter, respectively (chromel and alumel in the figure).

===Characteristic function===

An integral does not need to be performed for every temperature measurement. Rather, the thermocouple's behaviour is captured by a '''characteristic function''' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E(T)&lt;/math&gt;, which needs only to be consulted at two arguments:
:&lt;math&gt;V = E(T_\mathrm{sense}) - E(T_\mathrm{ref}).&lt;/math&gt;
In terms of the Seebeck coefficients, the characteristic function is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \int^T S_{+}(T') - S_{-}(T') dT' + \mathrm{const} &lt;/math&gt;
The [[constant of integration]] in this [[indefinite integral]] has no significance, but is conventionally chosen such that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E(0\,{}^{\circ}{\rm C}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Thermocouple manufacturers and metrology standards organizations such as [[NIST]] provide tables of the function &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E(T)&lt;/math&gt; that have been measured and interpolated over a range of temperatures, for particular thermocouple types (see ''External links'' section for access to these tables).

===Requirement for a reference junction===

[[File:Cold Junction Compensation with Thermistor to measure the junction temperature..jpg|thumb|right|Reference junction block inside a Fluke CNX t3000 temperature meter. Two white wires connect to a [[thermistor]] (embedded in white thermal compound) to measure the reference junctions' temperature.]]

To obtain the desired measurement of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T_\mathrm{sense}&lt;/math&gt;, it is not sufficient to just measure &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle V&lt;/math&gt;.
The temperature at the reference junctions &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T_\mathrm{ref}&lt;/math&gt; must be already known.
Two strategies are often used here:
* "Ice bath" method: The reference junction block is immersed in a semi-frozen bath of distilled water at atmospheric pressure. The precise temperature of the melting point [[phase transition]] acts as a natural [[thermostat]], fixing &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T_\mathrm{ref}&lt;/math&gt; to 0&amp;nbsp;°C. 
* Reference junction sensor (known as "{{visible anchor|cold junction compensation}}"): The reference junction block is allowed to vary in temperature, but the temperature is measured at this block using a separate temperature sensor. This secondary measurement is used to compensate for temperature variation at the junction block. The thermocouple junction is often exposed to extreme environments, while the reference junction is often mounted near the instrument's location.  [[Silicon bandgap temperature sensor|Semiconductor thermometer]] devices are often used in modern thermocouple instruments.

In both cases the value &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle V + E(T_\mathrm{ref})&lt;/math&gt; is calculated, then the function &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E(T)&lt;/math&gt; is [[root-finding algorithm|searched]] for a matching value. The argument where this match occurs is the value of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T_\mathrm{sense}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Practical concerns==

Thermocouples ideally should be very simple measurement devices, with each type being characterized by a precise &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E(T)&lt;/math&gt; curve, independent of any other details.
In reality, thermocouples are affected by issues such as alloy manufacturing uncertainties, aging effects, and circuit design mistakes/misunderstandings.

===Circuit construction===

A common error in thermocouple construction is related to cold junction compensation. If an error is made on the estimation of &lt;math&gt;T_\mathrm{ref}&lt;/math&gt;, the same error will be carried over to the temperature measurement. For the simplest measurements, thermocouple wires are connected to copper far away from the hot or cold point whose temperature is measured; the cold junction is then assumed to be at room temperature, but that temperature can vary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Prevent Temperature Measurement Errors When Installing Thermocouple Sensors and Transmitters|url=https://www.acromag.com/sites/default/files/How_to_prevent_temperature_measurement_errors_when_installing_thermocouple_sensors_and_transmitters_926A.pdf|website=acromag.com|publisher=Acromag|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Junctions should be made in a reliable manner, but there are many possible approaches to accomplish this.
For low temperatures, junctions can be brazed or soldered, however it may be difficult to find a suitable [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] and this may not be suitable at the sensing junction due to the solder's low melting point.
Reference and extension junctions are therefore usually made with screw [[terminal block]]s.
For high temperatures, a common approach is a [[spot weld]] or [[crimp connection|crimp]] using a durable material.&lt;ref name="wang"/&gt;
A common myth regarding thermocouples is that junctions must be made cleanly without involving a third metal, to avoid unwanted added emfs.&lt;ref&gt;Pyromation, Inc. [http://www.pyromation.com/Downloads/Doc/Training_TC_Theory.pdf "Thermocouple theory"] (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
This may result from another common misunderstanding that the voltage is generated at the junction.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, Martin (2013). [http://www.edn.com/design/test-and-measurement/4423409/Simple--but-misunderstood "Thermocouples: Simple but misunderstood"], EDN Network.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the junctions should in principle have uniform internal temperature, therefore no voltage is generated at the junction. The voltage is generated in the thermal gradient, along the wire.

A thermocouple produces small signals, often microvolts in magnitude. Precise measurements of this signal require an amplifier with low [[input offset voltage]] and with care taken to avoid thermal emfs from self-heating within the voltmeter itself. If the thermocouple wire has a high resistance for some reason (poor contact at junctions, or very thin wires used for fast thermal response), the measuring instrument should have high [[input impedance]] to prevent an offset in the measured voltage. A useful feature in thermocouple instrumentation will simultaneously measure resistance and detect faulty connections in the wiring or at thermocouple junctions.

===Metallurgical grades===

While a thermocouple wire type is often described by its chemical composition, the actual aim is to produce a pair of wires that follow a standardized &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E(T)&lt;/math&gt; curve.

Impurities affect each batch of metal differently, producing variable Seebeck coefficients.
To match the standard behaviour, thermocouple wire manufacturers will deliberately mix in additional impurities to "dope" the alloy, compensating for uncontrolled variations in source material.&lt;ref name=wang&gt;Wang, T. P. (1990) [http://www.dugantech.com/Product_Group-Temperature/Technical%20Articles/TE-Thermocouple%20Materials%20Paper.pdf "Thermocouple Materials"] in ''ASM Handbook'', Vol. 2. {{ISBN|978-0-87170-378-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result, there are standard and specialized grades of thermocouple wire, depending on the level of precision demanded in the thermocouple behaviour.
Precision grades may only be available in matched pairs, where one wire is modified to compensate for deficiencies in the other wire.

A special case of thermocouple wire is known as "extension grade", designed to carry the thermoelectric circuit over a longer distance.
Extension wires follow the stated &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E(T)&lt;/math&gt; curve but for various reasons they are not designed to be used in extreme environments and so they cannot be used at the sensing junction in some applications.
For example, an extension wire may be in a different form, such as highly flexible with stranded construction and plastic insulation, or be part of a multi-wire cable for carrying many thermocouple circuits.
With expensive noble metal thermocouples, the extension wires may even be made of a completely different, cheaper material that mimics the standard type over a reduced temperature range.&lt;ref name="wang"/&gt;

===Aging of thermocouples===

Thermocouples are often used at high temperatures and in reactive furnace atmospheres. In this case, the practical lifetime is limited by thermocouple aging. The thermoelectric coefficients of the wires in a thermocouple that is used to measure very high temperatures may change with time, and the measurement voltage accordingly drops. The simple relationship between the temperature difference of the junctions and the measurement voltage is only correct if each wire is homogeneous (uniform in composition). As thermocouples age in a process, their conductors can lose homogeneity due to chemical and metallurgical changes caused by extreme or prolonged exposure to high temperatures. If the aged section of the thermocouple circuit is exposed to a temperature gradient, the measured voltage will differ, resulting in error.

Aged thermocouples are only partly modified, for example being unaffected in the parts outside the furnace. For this reason, aged thermocouples cannot be taken out of their installed location and recalibrated in a bath or test furnace to determine error. This also explains why error can sometimes be observed when an aged thermocouple is pulled partly out of a furnace—as the sensor is pulled back, aged sections may see exposure to increased temperature gradients from hot to cold as the aged section now passes through the cooler refractory area, contributing significant error to the measurement. Likewise, an aged thermocouple that is pushed deeper into the furnace might sometimes provide a more accurate reading if being pushed further into the furnace causes the temperature gradient to occur only in a fresh section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kerlin, T.W.  |author2=Johnson, M.P. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Practical Thermocouple Thermometry (2nd Ed.)|year=2012|publisher=ISA|location=Research Triangle Park|isbn=978-1-937560-27-0|pages=110–112|url=http://www.isa.org/Template.cfm?Section=Books3&amp;Template=/Ecommerce/ProductDisplay.cfm&amp;ProductID=12178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

Certain combinations of alloys have become popular as industry standards. Selection of the combination is driven by cost, availability, convenience, melting point, chemical properties, stability, and output. Different types are best suited for different applications. They are usually selected on the basis of the temperature range and sensitivity needed. Thermocouples with low sensitivities (B, R, and S types) have correspondingly lower resolutions. Other selection criteria include the chemical [[Chemically inert|inertness]] of the thermocouple material and whether it is [[magnetic]] or not. Standard thermocouple types are listed below with the positive [[electrode]] (assuming &lt;math&gt;T_\text{sense} &gt; T_\text{ref}&lt;/math&gt;) first, followed by the negative electrode.

===Nickel-alloy thermocouples===
[[File:Intermediate temperature thermocouples reference functions.svg|thumb|Characteristic functions for thermocouples that reach intermediate temperatures, as covered by nickel-alloy thermocouple types E, J, K, M, N, T. Also shown are the noble-metal alloy type P and the pure noble-metal combinations gold–platinum and platinum–palladium.]]

====Type E====
Type E ([[chromel]]–[[constantan]]) has a high output (68&amp;nbsp;µV/°C), which makes it well suited to [[cryogenic]] use. Additionally, it is non-magnetic.
Wide range is −50&amp;nbsp;°C to +740&amp;nbsp;°C
and narrow range is −110&amp;nbsp;°C to +140&amp;nbsp;°C.

====Type J====
Type J ([[iron]]–[[constantan]]) has a more restricted range (−40&amp;nbsp;°C to +750&amp;nbsp;°C) than type K but higher sensitivity of about 50&amp;nbsp;µV/°C.&lt;ref name="Ramsden2000"/&gt; The [[Curie point]] of the iron (770&amp;nbsp;°C)&lt;ref&gt;Buschow, K. H. J. ''Encyclopedia of materials: science and technology'', Elsevier, 2001 {{ISBN|0-08-043152-6}}, p. 5021, table 1.&lt;/ref&gt; causes a smooth change in the characteristic, which determines the upper temperature limit.

====Type K====
Type K ([[chromel]]–[[alumel]]) is the most common general-purpose thermocouple with a sensitivity of approximately 41&amp;nbsp;µV/°C.&lt;ref name="MNL 12"&gt;{{cite book| title=Manual on the Use of Thermocouples in Temperature Measurement (4th Ed.)| year=1993| publisher=ASTM| isbn=978-0-8031-1466-1| pages=48–51| url=http://www.astm.org/BOOKSTORE/PUBS/MNL12-4TH.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is inexpensive, and a wide variety of probes are available in its −200&amp;nbsp;°C to +1350&amp;nbsp;°C (−330&amp;nbsp;°F to +2460&amp;nbsp;°F) range. Type K was specified at a time when [[metallurgy]] was less advanced than it is today, and consequently characteristics may vary considerably between samples. One of the constituent metals, [[nickel]], is magnetic; a characteristic of thermocouples made with magnetic material is that they undergo a deviation in output when the material reaches its [[Curie temperature|Curie point]], which occurs for type K thermocouples at around 185&amp;nbsp;°C.

They operate very well in oxidizing atmospheres. If, however, a mostly reducing atmosphere (such as hydrogen with a small amount of oxygen) comes into contact with the wires, the chromium in the chromel alloy oxidizes. This reduces the emf output, and the thermocouple reads low. This phenomenon is known as ''green rot'', due to the color of the affected alloy. Although not always distinctively green, the chromel wire will develop a mottled silvery skin and become magnetic. An easy way to check for this problem is to see whether the two wires are magnetic (normally, chromel is non-magnetic).

Hydrogen in the atmosphere is the usual cause of green rot. At high temperatures, it can diffuse through solid metals or an intact metal thermowell. Even a sheath of magnesium oxide insulating the thermocouple will not keep the hydrogen out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transcat.com/calibration-resources/application-notes/thermocouples/|title=Helping thermocouples do the job... - Transcat|author=|date=|website=www.transcat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Type M====
Type M (82%Ni/18%[[molybdenum|Mo]]–99.2%Ni/0.8%[[cobalt|Co]], by weight) are used in vacuum furnaces for the same reasons as with type C (described below). Upper temperature is limited to 1400&amp;nbsp;°C. It is less commonly used than other types.

===={{visible anchor|Type N}}====
Type N ([[Nicrosil]]–[[Nisil]]) thermocouples are suitable for use between −270&amp;nbsp;°C and +1300&amp;nbsp;°C, owing to its stability and oxidation resistance. Sensitivity is about 39&amp;nbsp;µV/°C at 900&amp;nbsp;°C, slightly lower compared to type K.

Designed at the [[Defence Science and Technology Organisation]] (DSTO) of Australia, by Noel A. Burley, type-N thermocouples overcome the three principal characteristic types and causes of thermoelectric instability in the standard base-metal thermoelement materials:&lt;ref&gt;Burley, Noel A. [http://www.omega.com/temperature/Z/pdf/z041-044.pdf Nicrosil/Nisil Type N Thermocouples]. www.omega.com.&lt;/ref&gt;
#A gradual and generally cumulative drift in thermal EMF on long exposure at elevated temperatures. This is observed in all base-metal thermoelement materials and is mainly due to compositional changes caused by [[oxidation]], [[carburization]], or [[neutron irradiation]] that can produce [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] in [[nuclear reactor]] environments. In the case of type-K thermocouples, manganese and aluminium atoms from the KN (negative) wire migrate to the KP (positive) wire, resulting in a down-scale drift due to chemical contamination. This effect is cumulative and irreversible.
#A short-term cyclic change in thermal EMF on heating in the temperature range about 250–650&amp;nbsp;°C, which occurs in thermocouples of types K, J, T, and E. This kind of EMF instability is associated with structural changes such as magnetic short-range order in the metallurgical composition.
#A time-independent perturbation in thermal EMF in specific temperature ranges. This is due to composition-dependent magnetic transformations that perturb the thermal EMFs in type-K thermocouples in the range about 25–225&amp;nbsp;°C, and in type J above 730&amp;nbsp;°C.

The Nicrosil and Nisil thermocouple alloys show greatly enhanced thermoelectric stability relative to the other standard base-metal thermocouple alloys because their compositions substantially reduce the thermoelectric instabilities described above. This is achieved primarily by increasing component solute concentrations (chromium and silicon) in a base of nickel above those required to cause a transition from internal to external modes of oxidation, and by selecting solutes (silicon and magnesium) that preferentially oxidize to form a diffusion-barrier, and hence oxidation-inhibiting films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jms-se.com/catalog/TypeN_vs_TypeK_Thermocouple.pdf Type N Thermocouple Versus Type K Thermocouple in A Brick Manufacturing Facility]. jms-se.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Type T====
Type T ([[copper]]–[[constantan]]) thermocouples are suited for measurements in the −200 to 350&amp;nbsp;°C range. Often used as a differential measurement, since only copper wire touches the probes. Since both conductors are non-magnetic, there is no [[Curie point]] and thus no abrupt change in characteristics. Type-T thermocouples have a sensitivity of about 43&amp;nbsp;µV/°C. Note that copper has a much higher [[thermal conductivity]] than the alloys generally used in thermocouple constructions, and so it is necessary to exercise extra care with thermally anchoring type-T thermocouples.

===Platinum/rhodium-alloy thermocouples===
[[File:High temperature thermocouples reference functions.svg|thumb|Characteristic functions for high-temperature thermocouple types, showing Pt/Rh, W/Re, Pt/Mo, and Ir/Rh-alloy thermocouples. Also shown is the Pt–Pd pure-metal thermocouple.]]
Types B, R, and S thermocouples use [[platinum]] or a platinum/[[rhodium]] alloy for each conductor. These are among the most stable thermocouples, but have lower sensitivity than other types, approximately 10&amp;nbsp;µV/°C. Type B, R, and S thermocouples are usually used only for high-temperature measurements due to their high cost and low sensitivity.

====Type B====
Type B (70%Pt/30%Rh–94%Pt/6%Rh, by weight) thermocouples are suited for use at up to 1800&amp;nbsp;°C. Type-B thermocouples produce the same output at 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 42&amp;nbsp;°C, limiting their use below about 50&amp;nbsp;°C. The emf function has a minimum around 21&amp;nbsp;°C, meaning that cold-junction compensation is easily performed, since the compensation voltage is essentially a constant for a reference at typical room temperatures.&lt;ref name="capgo"&gt;

Type R (87%Pt/13%Rh–Pt, by weight) thermocouples are used 0 to 1600&amp;nbsp;°C.

====Type S====
Type S (90%Pt/10%Rh–Pt, by weight) thermocouples, similar to type R, are used up to 1600&amp;nbsp;°C. Before the introduction of the [[International Temperature Scale of 1990]] (ITS-90), precision type-S thermocouples were used as the practical standard thermometers for the range of 630&amp;nbsp;°C to 1064&amp;nbsp;°C, based on an interpolation between the freezing points of [[antimony]], [[silver]], and [[gold]]. Starting with ITS-90, [[platinum resistance thermometer]]s have taken over this range as standard thermometers.&lt;ref&gt;

===Tungsten/rhenium-alloy thermocouples===
These thermocouples are well suited for measuring extremely high temperatures. Typical uses are hydrogen and inert atmospheres, as well as [[vacuum furnace]]s. They are not used in oxidizing environments at high temperatures because of [[embrittlement]].&lt;ref name=omegaeng&gt;OMEGA Engineering Inc. "[http://www.omega.com/temperature/z/pdf/z202.pdf Tungsten-Rhenium Thermocouples Calibration Equivalents]".&lt;/ref&gt; A typical range is 0 to 2315&amp;nbsp;°C, which can be extended to 2760&amp;nbsp;°C in inert atmosphere and to 3000&amp;nbsp;°C for brief measurements.&lt;ref name="Pollock1991"/&gt;

===Others===

====Chromel–gold/iron-alloy thermocouples====
[[File:Low temperature thermocouples reference functions.svg|thumb|Thermocouple characteristics at low temperatures. The AuFe-based thermocouple shows a steady sensitivity down to low temperatures, whereas conventional types soon flatten out and lose sensitivity at low temperature.]]
In these thermocouples ([[chromel]]–[[gold]]/[[iron]] alloy), the negative wire is gold with a small fraction (0.03–0.15 atom percent) of iron. The impure gold wire gives the thermocouple a high sensitivity at low temperatures (compared to other thermocouples at that temperature), whereas the chromel wire maintains the sensitivity near room temperature. It can be used for [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] applications (1.2–300 K and even up to 600 K). Both the sensitivity and the temperature range depend on the iron concentration. The sensitivity is typically around 15 µV/K at low temperatures, and the lowest usable temperature varies between 1.2 and 4.2 K.

====Type P (noble-metal alloy)====
Type P (55%[[palladium|Pd]]/31%Pt/14%Au–65%Au/35%Pd, by weight) thermocouples give a thermoelectric voltage that mimics the type K over the range 500&amp;nbsp;°C to 1400&amp;nbsp;°C, however they are constructed purely of noble metals and so shows enhanced corrosion resistance. This combination is also known as Platinel II.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dugantech.com/Product_Group-Temperature/Technical%20Articles/TE-Other%20Types%20of%20Thermocouples.pdf Other Types of Thermocouples]. dugantech.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Platinum/molybdenum-alloy thermocouples====
Thermocouples of platinum/molybdenum-alloy (95%Pt/5%Mo–99.9%Pt/0.1%Mo, by weight) are sometimes used in nuclear reactors, since they show a low drift from [[nuclear transmutation]] induced by neutron irradiation, compared to the platinum/rhodium-alloy types.&lt;ref name="Pollock"&gt;Thermoelectricity: Theory, Thermometry, Tool, Issue 852 by Daniel D. Pollock.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iridium/rhodium alloy thermocouples====
The use of two wires of [[iridium]]/[[rhodium]] alloys can provide a thermocouple that can be used up to about 2000&amp;nbsp;°C in inert atmospheres.&lt;ref name="Pollock"/&gt;

====Pure noble-metal thermocouples Au–Pt, Pt–Pd====
Thermocouples made from two different, high-purity noble metals can show high accuracy even when uncalibrated, as well as low levels of drift. Two combinations in use are gold–platinum and platinum–palladium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.fluke.com/comx/pages/hrt_5629_en.htm  5629 Gold Platinum Thermocouple] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105050650/http://content.fluke.com/comx/pages/hrt_5629_en.htm |date=2014-01-05 }}. fluke.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Their main limitations are the low melting points of the metals involved (1064&amp;nbsp;°C for gold and 1555&amp;nbsp;°C for palladium). These thermocouples tend to be more accurate than type S, and due to their economy and simplicity are even regarded as competitive alternatives to the [[platinum resistance thermometer]]s that are normally used as standard thermometers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/mep_kelvin/its-90_techniques.html BIPM – "Techniques for Approximating the ITS-90"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201232752/http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/mep_kelvin/its-90_techniques.html |date=2014-02-01 }} Chapter 9: Platinum Thermocouples.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Skutterudite thermocouples====
[[NASA]] is developing a [[Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator]] in which the thermocouples would be made of [[skutterudite]], which can function with a smaller temperature difference than the current [[tellurium]] designs. This would mean that an otherwise similar RTG would generate 25% more power at the beginning of a mission and at least 50% more after seventeen years. NASA hopes to use the design on the next [[New Frontiers program|New Frontiers]] mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Comparison of types===
The table below describes properties of several different thermocouple types. Within the tolerance columns, ''T'' represents the temperature of the hot junction, in degrees Celsius. For example, a thermocouple with a tolerance of ±0.0025×''T'' would have a tolerance of ±2.5&amp;nbsp;°C at 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.

==Thermocouple insulation==

[[File:Thermocouple K (2).jpg|thumb|Typical low cost type K thermocouple (with standard type K [[electrical connector|connector]]). While the wires can survive and function at high temperatures, the plastic insulation will start to break down at 300&amp;nbsp;°C.]]

The wires that make up the thermocouple must be [[Insulator (electricity)|insulated]] from each other everywhere, except at the sensing junction. Any additional electrical contact between the wires, or contact of a wire to other conductive objects, can modify the voltage and give a false reading of temperature.

Plastics are suitable insulators for low temperatures parts of a thermocouple, whereas ceramic insulation can be used up to around 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. Other concerns (abrasion and chemical resistance) also affect the suitability of materials.

When wire insulation disintegrates, it can result in an unintended electrical contact at a different location from the desired sensing point. If such a damaged thermocouple is used in the closed loop control of a [[thermostat]] or other [[temperature control]]ler, this can lead to a runaway overheating event and possibly severe damage, as the false temperature reading will typically be lower than the sensing junction temperature. Failed insulation will also typically [[outgas]], which can lead to process contamination. For parts of thermocouples used at very high temperatures or in contamination-sensitive applications, the only suitable insulation may be [[vacuum]] or [[inert gas]]; the mechanical rigidity of the thermocouple wires is used to keep them separated.

Temperature ratings for insulations may vary based on what the overall thermocouple construction cable consists of.

Note: T300 is a new high-temperature material that was recently approved by UL for 300&amp;nbsp;°C operating temperatures.

==Applications==
Thermocouples are suitable for measuring over a large temperature range, from −270 up to 3000&amp;nbsp;°C (for a short time, in inert atmosphere).&lt;ref name="Pollock1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pollock, Daniel D. |title=Thermocouples: Theory and Properties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_CK8U_bzgKQC&amp;pg=PA249|date=1991|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-4243-1|pages=249–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications include temperature measurement for [[kiln]]s, [[gas turbine]] exhaust, [[Diesel engine|diesel]] engines, other industrial processes and [[fog machine]]s. They are less suitable for applications where smaller temperature differences need to be measured with high accuracy, for example the range 0–100&amp;nbsp;°C with 0.1&amp;nbsp;°C accuracy. For such applications [[thermistor]]s, [[silicon bandgap temperature sensor]]s and [[resistance thermometer]]s are more suitable.

===Steel industry===
Type B, S, R and K thermocouples are used extensively in the [[steel]] and [[iron]] industries to monitor temperatures and chemistry throughout the steel making process. Disposable, immersible, type S thermocouples are regularly used in the [[electric arc furnace]] process to accurately measure the temperature of steel before tapping. The cooling curve of a small steel sample can be analyzed and used to estimate the carbon content of molten steel.

===Gas appliance safety===
[[File:Burner assembly of a water heater.jpg|thumb|A thermocouple (the right most tube) inside the burner assembly of a [[water heater]]]]
[[File:Thermocouple connection.JPG|thumb|Thermocouple connection in gas appliances. The end ball (contact) on the left is insulated from the [[Compression fitting|fitting]] by an insulating [[Washer (hardware)|washer]]. The thermocouple line consists of copper wire, insulator and outer metal (usually copper) sheath which is also used as [[Ground (electricity)#Electronics|ground]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Flammable Vapor Ignition Resistant Water Heaters: Service Manual (238-44943-00D)|publisher=Bradford White|url=http://waterheatertimer.org/pdf/44943-D-FVIR-Brad-White.pdf|pages=11–16|accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Many [[Natural gas|gas]]-fed heating appliances such as [[oven]]s and [[water heater]]s make use of a [[pilot light|pilot flame]] to ignite the main gas burner when required. If the pilot flame goes out, unburned gas may be released, which is an explosion risk and a health hazard. To prevent this, some appliances use a thermocouple in a [[fail-safe]] circuit to sense when the pilot light is burning. The tip of the thermocouple is placed in the pilot flame, generating a voltage which operates the supply valve which feeds gas to the pilot. So long as the pilot flame remains lit, the thermocouple remains hot, and the pilot gas valve is held open. If the pilot light goes out, the thermocouple temperature falls, causing the voltage across the thermocouple to drop and the valve to close.

Where the probe may be easily placed above the flame, a [[Flame_detector#Ionization_current_flame_detection|rectifying sensor]] may often be used instead.  With part ceramic construction, they may also be known as flame rods, flame sensors or flame detection electrodes.

[[File:Flame-igniter(top)-and-flame-sensor.jpg|thumb|Flame-igniter(top)-and-flame-sensor]]

Some combined main burner and pilot gas valves (mainly by [[Honeywell]]) reduce the power demand to within the range of a single universal thermocouple heated by a pilot (25 mV open circuit falling by half with the coil connected to a 10–12 mV, 0.2–0.25 A source, typically) by sizing the coil to be able to hold the valve open against a light spring, but only after the initial turning-on force is provided by the user pressing and holding a knob to compress the spring during lighting of the pilot. These systems are identifiable by the "press and hold for x minutes" in the pilot lighting instructions. (The holding current requirement of such a valve is much less than a bigger solenoid designed for pulling the valve in from a closed position would require.) Special test sets are made to confirm the valve let-go and holding currents, because an ordinary milliammeter cannot be used as it introduces more resistance than the gas valve coil. Apart from testing the open circuit voltage of the thermocouple, and the near short-circuit DC continuity through the thermocouple gas valve coil, the easiest non-specialist test is substitution of a known good gas valve.

Some systems, known as millivolt control systems, extend the thermocouple concept to both open and close the main gas valve as well. Not only does the voltage created by the pilot thermocouple activate the pilot gas valve, it is also routed through a [[thermostat]] to power the main gas valve as well. Here, a larger voltage is needed than in a pilot flame safety system described above, and a [[thermopile]] is used rather than a single thermocouple. Such a system requires no external source of electricity for its operation and thus can operate during a power failure, provided that all the other related system components allow for this. This excludes common [[forced air furnace]]s because external electrical power is required to operate the blower motor, but this feature is especially useful for un-powered [[convection heater]]s. A similar gas shut-off safety mechanism using a thermocouple is sometimes employed to ensure that the main burner ignites within a certain time period, shutting off the main burner gas supply valve should that not happen.

Out of concern about energy wasted by the standing pilot flame, designers of many newer appliances have switched to an electronically controlled pilot-less ignition, also called intermittent ignition. With no standing pilot flame, there is no risk of gas buildup should the flame go out, so these appliances do not need thermocouple-based pilot safety switches. As these designs lose the benefit of operation without a continuous source of electricity, standing pilots are still used in some appliances. The exception is later model instantaneous (aka "tankless") [[tankless water heater|water heaters]] that use the flow of water to generate the current required to ignite the gas burner; these designs also use a thermocouple as a safety cut-off device in the event the gas fails to ignite, or if the flame is extinguished.

===Thermopile radiation sensors===
[[Thermopile]]s are used for measuring the intensity of incident radiation, typically visible or infrared light, which heats the hot junctions, while the cold junctions are on a heat sink. It is possible to measure radiative [[intensity (physics)|intensities]] of only a few μW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with commercially available thermopile sensors. For example, some [[laser]] [[power (physics)|power]] meters are based on such sensors; these are specifically known as [[thermopile laser sensor]].

The principle of operation of a thermopile sensor is distinct from that of a [[bolometer]], as the latter relies on a change in resistance.

===Manufacturing===
Thermocouples can generally be used in the testing of prototype electrical and mechanical apparatus. For example, [[switchgear]] under test for its current carrying capacity may have thermocouples installed and monitored during a heat run test, to confirm that the temperature rise at rated current does not exceed designed limits.

===Power production===
{{main article|Thermoelectric generator }}
A thermocouple can produce current to drive some processes directly, without the need for extra circuitry and power sources. For example, the power from a thermocouple can activate a valve when a temperature difference arises. The [[electrical energy]] generated by a thermocouple is converted from the [[heat]] which must be supplied to the hot side to maintain the electric potential. A continuous transfer of heat is necessary because the current flowing through the thermocouple tends to cause the hot side to cool down and the cold side to heat up (the [[Peltier effect]]).

Thermocouples can be connected in series to form a [[thermopile]], where all the hot junctions are exposed to a higher temperature and all the cold junctions to a lower temperature. The output is the sum of the voltages across the individual junctions, giving larger voltage and power output. In a [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]], the [[radioactive decay]] of [[transuranic elements]] as a heat source has been used to power spacecraft on missions too far from the Sun to use solar power.

Thermopiles heated by [[kerosene lamp]]s were used to run [[batteryless radio]] receivers in isolated areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New Scientist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B-ve-ZR6QRIC&amp;pg=PA67|accessdate=28 May 2012|date=10 January 1974|publisher=Reed Business Information|pages=67–|issn=0262-4079}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are commercially produced lanterns that use the heat from a candle to run several light-emitting diodes, and thermoelectrically-powered fans to improve air circulation and heat distribution in [[wood stove]]s.

Chemical production and petroleum refineries will usually employ computers for logging and for limit testing the many temperatures associated with a process, typically numbering in the hundreds. For such cases, a number of thermocouple leads will be brought to a common reference block (a large block of copper) containing the second thermocouple of each circuit. The temperature of the block is in turn measured by a [[thermistor]]. Simple computations are used to determine the temperature at each measured location.

===Thermocouple as vacuum gauge===
{{see also|Pressure measurement#Thermal conductivity}}
A thermocouple can be used as a [[vacuum gauge]] over the range of approximately 0.001 to 1 [[torr]] absolute pressure.  In this pressure range, the [[mean free path]] of the gas is comparable to the dimensions of the [[vacuum chamber]], and the flow regime is neither purely [[Navier–Stokes equations|viscous]] nor purely [[Knudsen flow|molecular]].&lt;ref&gt;Hablanian, M. H. (1997) ''High-Vacuum Technology: A Practical Guide, Second Ed.'', Marcel Dekker Inc., pp. 19–22, 45–47 &amp; 438–443, {{ISBN|0-8247-9834-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this configuration, the thermocouple junction is attached to the centre of a short heating wire, which is usually energised by a constant current of about 5&amp;nbsp;mA, and the heat is removed at a rate related to the thermal conductivity of the gas. 

The temperature detected at the thermocouple junction depends on the [[thermal conductivity]] of the surrounding gas, which depends on the [[pressure]] of the gas.  The potential difference measured by a thermocouple is proportional to the [[Square number|square]] of pressure over the [[Vacuum#Measurement|low- to medium-vacuum]] range.  At higher (viscous flow) and lower (molecular flow) pressures, the thermal conductivity of air or any other gas is essentially independent of pressure.  The thermocouple was first used as a vacuum gauge by Voege in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Voege, W. (1906) ''Physik Zeit.'', '''7''': 498.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mathematical model for the thermocouple as a vacuum gauge is quite complicated, as explained in detail by Van Atta,&lt;ref&gt;Van Atta, C. M. (1965) ''Vacuum Science and Engineering'', McGraw-Hill Book Co. pp. 78–90.&lt;/ref&gt; but can be simplified to:
: &lt;math&gt;P = \frac{B (V^2 - V_0^2)}{V_0^2}, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''P'' is the gas pressure, ''B'' is a constant that depends on the thermocouple temperature, the gas composition and the vacuum-chamber geometry, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the thermocouple voltage at zero pressure (absolute), and ''V'' is the voltage indicated by the thermocouple.

The alternative is the [[Pirani gauge]], which operates in a similar way, over approximately the same pressure range, but is only a 2-terminal device, sensing the change in resistance with temperature of a thin electrically heated wire, rather than using a thermocouple.

'''Wire rope''' is several strands of metal [[wire]] twisted into a [[helix]] forming a composite "[[rope]]", in a pattern known as "laid rope". Larger diameter wire rope consists of multiple strands of such laid rope in a pattern known as "cable laid".

In stricter senses the term "wire rope" refers to diameter larger than 3/8&amp;nbsp;inch (9.52&amp;nbsp;mm), with smaller gauges designated cable or cords.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bergencable.com/technology/technology_cable101.html Bergen Cable Technology -- Cable 101] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506112618/http://www.bergencable.com/technology/technology_cable101.html |date=2014-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially [[wrought iron]] wires were used, but today [[steel]] is the main material used for wire ropes.

Historically, wire rope evolved from wrought iron chains, which had a record of mechanical failure. While flaws in chain links or solid steel bars can lead to [[catastrophic failure]], flaws in the wires making up a steel cable are less critical as the other wires easily take up the load. While friction between the individual wires and strands causes wear over the life of the rope, it also helps to compensate for minor failures in the short run.

Wire ropes were developed starting with mining hoist applications in the 1830s. Wire ropes are used dynamically for lifting and hoisting in [[Crane (machine)|cranes]] and [[elevator]]s, and for [[Belt (mechanical)#Rope drive|transmission of mechanical power]]. Wire rope is also used to transmit [[force (physics)|force]] in mechanisms, such as a [[Bowden cable]] or the [[control surface (aviation)|control surface]]s of an airplane connected to levers and pedals in the cockpit. Only aircraft cables have WSC (wire strand core). Also, aircraft cables are available in smaller diameters than wire rope. For example, aircraft cables are available in 3/64 in. diameter while most wire ropes begin at a 1/4 in. diameter.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lexcocable.com/faq.html?cat=3|title=FAQ {{!}} Lexco Cable|website=www.lexcocable.com|access-date=2017-01-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104234041/http://www.lexcocable.com/faq.html?cat=3|archivedate=2017-01-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Static wire ropes are used to support structures such as [[suspension bridge]]s or as [[guy wire]]s to support towers. An [[aerial tramway]] relies on wire rope to support and move cargo overhead.

==History==
Modern wire rope was invented by the German [[mining]] engineer [[Wilhelm Albert (engineer)|Wilhelm Albert]] in the years between 1831 and 1834 for use in mining in the [[Harz]] Mountains in [[Clausthal]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12706/Wilhelm-Albert | title=Wilhelm Albert | publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | accessdate=9 April 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409102021/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12706/Wilhelm-Albert |archivedate=9 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-x9NHOLSnNUC&amp;pg=PA388&amp;dq=wilhelm+albert+inventor+wire+rope&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=faREU_W6JcSjtAaFpYHwBQ&amp;ved=0CGcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=wilhelm%20albert%20inventor%20wire%20rope&amp;f=false |title=Explorations in the History of Machines and Mechanisms |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |date=2012 |accessdate=9 April 2014 |author1=Koetsier,Teun |author2=Ceccarelli, Marc |page=388 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331154144/https://books.google.com/books?id=-x9NHOLSnNUC&amp;pg=PA388&amp;dq=wilhelm+albert+inventor+wire+rope&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=faREU_W6JcSjtAaFpYHwBQ&amp;ved=0CGcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=wilhelm%20albert%20inventor%20wire%20rope&amp;f=false |archivedate=31 March 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atlantic-cable.com//Article/WireRope/Sayenga/wirerope4.htm |title=Modern History of Wire Rope |publisher=History of the Atlantic Cable &amp; Submarine Telegraphy (atlantic-cable.com) |accessdate=9 April 2014 |author=Donald Sayenga |deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203130816/http://atlantic-cable.com//Article/WireRope/Sayenga/wirerope4.htm |archivedate=3 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was quickly accepted because it proved superior to ropes made of hemp or to metal [[link chain|chains]], such as had been used before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Article/WireRope/Sayenga/wirerope4.htm Modern History of Wire Rope - Donald Sayenga] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027084945/http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/WireRope/Sayenga/wirerope4.htm |date=2010-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilhelm Albert's first ropes consisted of three strands consisting of four wires each. In 1840, Scotsman [[Robert Stirling Newall]] improved the process further.&lt;ref&gt;''Iron: An illustrated weekly journal for iron and steel'', Volume 63 by [[Sholto Percy]]&lt;/ref&gt; In America wire rope was manufactured by [[John A.

The decades were witness to a burgeoning increase in deep shaft mining in both Europe and North America as surface mineral deposits were exhausted and miners had to chase layers along inclined layers. The era was early in railroad development and steam engines lacked sufficient tractive effort to climb steep slopes, so incline plane railways were common. This pushed development of cable hoists rapidly in the United States as surface deposits in the Anthracite [[Coal Region]] north and south dove deeper every year, and even the rich deposits in the [[Panther Creek Valley]] required LC&amp;N Co. to drive their first shafts into lower slopes beginning [[Lansford, PA|Lansford]] and its [[Schuylkill County]] twin-town [[Coaldale, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Coaldale]].

The German engineering firm of [[Bleichert|Adolf Bleichert &amp; Co.]] was founded in 1874 and began to build bicable aerial tramways for mining in the [[Ruhr Valley]]. With important patents, and dozens of working systems in Europe, Bleichert dominated the global industry, later licensing its designs and manufacturing techniques to Trenton Iron Works, New Jersey, USA which built systems across America. Adolf Bleichert &amp; Co. went on to build hundreds of aerial tramways around the world: from Alaska to Argentina, Australia and Spitsbergen. The Bleichert company also built hundreds of aerial tramways for both the Imperial German Army and the Wehrmacht.

In the last half of the 19th century, wire rope systems were used as a means of transmitting mechanical power&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoildrum.com/node/9885 The Mechanical Transmission of Power: Endless Rope Drives by Kris De Decker, March 27, 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707225723/http://www.theoildrum.com/node/9885 |date=July 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including for the new [[cable car]]{{dn|date=November 2018}}s. Wire rope systems cost one-tenth as much and had lower friction losses than [[line shaft]]s. Because of these advantages, wire rope systems were used to transmit power for a distance of a few miles or kilometers.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book

==Construction==
[[File:WKA spannglieder.jpg|thumb|Inside view of a [[wind turbine]] tower, showing the wire ropes used as tendons.]]

===Wires===
Steel wires for wire ropes are normally made of non-alloy carbon steel with a carbon content of 0.4 to 0.95%. The very high strength of the rope wires enables wire ropes to support large tensile forces and to run over sheaves with relatively small diameters.

===Strands===
In the so-called cross lay strands, the wires of the different layers cross each other.
In the mostly used parallel lay strands, the lay length of all the wire layers is equal and the wires of any two superimposed layers are parallel, resulting in linear contact. The wire of the outer layer is supported by two wires of the inner layer. These wires are neighbours along the whole length of the strand. Parallel lay strands are made in one operation. The endurance of wire ropes with this kind of strand is always much greater than of those (seldom used) with cross lay strands. Parallel lay strands with two wire layers have the construction Filler, Seale or Warrington.

===Spiral ropes===
In principle, spiral ropes are round strands as they have an assembly of layers of wires laid helically over a centre with at least one layer of wires being laid in the opposite direction to that of the outer layer. Spiral ropes can be dimensioned in such a way that they are non-rotating which means that under tension the rope torque is nearly zero. The open spiral rope consists only of round wires. The half-locked coil rope and the full-locked coil rope always have a centre made of round wires. The locked coil ropes have one or more outer layers of profile wires. They have the advantage that their construction prevents the penetration of dirt and water to a greater extent and it also protects them from loss of lubricant. In addition, they have one further very important advantage as the ends of a broken outer wire cannot leave the rope if it has the proper dimensions.

===Stranded ropes===
[[Image:lhol wire rope.jpg|thumb|Left-hand ordinary lay (LHOL) wire rope (close-up). Right-hand lay strands are laid into a left-hand lay rope. |300px]]
[[Image:rhll wire rope.jpg|thumb|Right-hand langs lay (RHLL) wire rope (close-up). Right-hand lay strands are laid into a right-hand lay rope. |300px]]
Stranded ropes are an assembly of several strands laid helically in one or more layers around a core. This core can be one of three types. The first is a fiber core, made up of synthetic material or natural fibers like Sysal. Synthetic fibers are stronger and more uniform but cannot absorb much lubricant. Natural fibers can absorb up to 15% of their weight in lubricant and so protect the inner wires much better from corrosion than synthetic fibers do. Fiber cores are the most flexible and elastic, but have the downside of getting crushed easily. The second type, wire strand core, is made up of one additional strand of wire, and is typically used for suspension. The third type is independent wire rope core (IWRC), which is the most [[:wikt:durable|durable]] in all types of environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falckproductions.com/resources/air-winches/what-are-the-characteristics-of-a-wire-rope/|title=Wire Rope Safety Training|publisher=Falck Productions|accessdate=27 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119082149/http://www.falckproductions.com/resources/air-winches/what-are-the-characteristics-of-a-wire-rope/ |archivedate=19 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most types of stranded ropes only have one strand layer over the core (fibre core or steel core). The lay direction of the strands in the rope can be right (symbol Z) or left (symbol S) and the lay direction of the wires can be right (symbol z) or left (symbol s). This kind of rope is called '''ordinary lay rope''' if the lay direction of the wires in the outer strands is in the opposite direction to the lay of the outer strands themselves. If both the wires in the outer strands and the outer strands themselves have the same lay direction, the rope is called a '''lang lay rope''' (from Dutch ''langslag'' contrary to ''kruisslag'',&lt;ref&gt;[[:nl:Staalkabel#Slagrichting]] nl:''Staalkabel''&lt;/ref&gt; formerly Albert’s lay or langs lay). '''Regular lay''' means the individual wires were wrapped around the centers in one direction and the strands were wrapped around the core in the opposite direction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Multi-strand ropes are all more or less resistant to rotation and have at least two layers of strands laid helically around a centre. The direction of the outer strands is opposite to that of the underlying strand layers. Ropes with three strand layers can be nearly non-rotating. Ropes with two strand layers are mostly only low-rotating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bzwxw.com/soft/UploadSoft/new4/ISO--17893-2004.pdf bzwxw.com]|title=Steel Wire Ropes - Vocabulary, designation, and classification&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification according to usage==
Depending on where they are used, wire ropes have to fulfill different requirements. The main uses are:
* Running ropes (stranded ropes) are bent over sheaves and drums. They are therefore stressed mainly by bending and secondly by tension.
* Stationary ropes, stay ropes (spiral ropes, mostly full-locked) have to carry tensile forces and are therefore mainly loaded by static and fluctuating tensile stresses. Ropes used for suspension are often called ''cables.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Avallone |first1= Eugene |last2= Baumesiter III |first2= Theodore |title= Marks' Standard Handbook for Mechanical Engineers |edition= Ninth |year= 1978 |isbn= 0-07-004127-X |pages= 10–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Track ropes (full locked ropes) have to act as rails for the rollers of cabins or other loads in aerial ropeways and cable cranes. In contrast to running ropes, track ropes do not take on the curvature of the rollers. Under the roller force, a so-called free bending radius of the rope occurs. This radius increases (and the bending stresses decrease) with the tensile force and decreases with the roller force.
* Wire rope slings (stranded ropes) are used to harness various kinds of goods. These slings are stressed by the tensile forces but first of all by bending stresses when bent over the more or less sharp edges of the goods.

==Rope drive==
There are technical regulations for the rope drives of cranes, elevators, rope ways and mining installations not exceeding a given tensile force and not falling short of a given diameter ratio D/d of sheave and rope diameters. A general dimensioning method of rope drives (and used besides the technical regulations) calculate the five limits &lt;ref&gt;Feyrer, K.: Wire Ropes, Tension, Endurance, Reliability. Springer Berlin, Heidelberg, New York 2007. {{ISBN|3-540-33821-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Working cycles up to rope discarding or breakage (mean or 10% limit) - Requirement of the user
* Donandt force (yielding tensile force for a given bending diameter ratio D/d) - strict limit. The nominal rope tensile force S must be smaller than the Donandt force SD1.
* Rope safety factor = minimum breaking force Fmin / nominal rope tensile force S. (ability to resist extreme impact forces) - Fmin/S ≥ 2,5 for simple lifting appliance
* Discarding number of wire breaks (detection to need rope replacement) Minimum number of wire breaks on a reference rope length of 30d should be BA30 ≥ 8 for lifting appliance
* Optimal rope diameter with the max. rope endurance for a given sheave diameter D and tensile rope force S - For economic reasons the rope diameter should be near to but smaller than the optimal rope diameter d ≤ dopt.

The calculation of the rope drive limits depends on:
* Data of the used wire rope
* Rope tensile force S
* Diameter D of sheave and/or drum
* Simple bendings per working cycle w-sim
* Reverse bendings per working cycle w-rev
* Combined fluctuating tension and bending per working cycle w-com
* Relative fluctuating tensile force deltaS/S
* Rope bending length l

==Safety==
The wire ropes are stressed by fluctuating forces, by wear, by corrosion and in seldom cases by extreme forces. The rope life is finite and the safety is only ensured by inspection for the detection of wire breaks on a reference rope length, of cross-section loss, as well as other failures so that the wire rope can be replaced before a dangerous situation occurs. Installations should be designed to facilitate the inspection of the wire ropes.
	
[[Cable_transport|Lifting installations for passenger transportation]] require that a combination of several methods should be used to prevent a car from plunging downwards. Elevators must have redundant bearing ropes and a safety gear. Ropeways and mine hoistings must be permanently supervised by a responsible manager and the rope must be inspected by a magnetic method capable of detecting inner wire breaks.

==Terminations==
[[Image:Wire rope with thimble and ferrule.jpg|thumb|500px|Right-hand ordinary lay (RHOL) wire rope terminated in a loop with a thimble and ferrule.]]

The end of a wire rope tends to fray readily, and cannot be easily connected to plant and equipment. There are different ways of securing the ends of wire ropes to prevent fraying. The most common and useful type of end fitting for a wire rope is to turn the end back to form a loop. The loose end is then fixed back on the wire rope. Termination efficiencies vary from about 70% for a Flemish eye alone; to nearly 90% for a Flemish eye and splice; to 100% for potted ends and swagings.

===Thimbles===
When the wire rope is terminated with a loop, there is a risk that it will bend too tightly, especially when the loop is connected to a device that concentrates the load on a relatively small area. A thimble can be installed inside the loop to preserve the natural shape of the loop, and protect the cable from pinching and abrading on the inside of the loop. The use of thimbles in loops is industry [[best practice]]. The thimble prevents the load from coming into direct contact with the wires.

===Wire rope clamps/clips===
[[File:Rusty Steel wire rope Clamp.jpg|thumb|right|Rusty steel wire rope clamp]]
A [[wire rope clamp]], also called a clip, is used to fix the loose end of the loop back to the wire rope. It usually consists of a [[U-shaped bolt]], a forged saddle, and two nuts. The two layers of wire rope are placed in the [[U-bolt]]. The saddle is then fitted over the ropes on to the bolt (the saddle includes two holes to fit to the u-bolt). The nuts secure the arrangement in place. Three or more clamps are usually used to terminate a wire rope. As many as eight may be needed for a {{convert|2|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} diameter rope.

There is an old adage; be sure not to "saddle a dead horse". This means that when installing clamps, the saddle portion of the clamp assembly is placed on the load-bearing or "live" side, not on the non-load-bearing or "dead" side of the cable. According to the US Navy Manual S9086-UU-STM-010, Chapter 613R3, Wire and [[Fiber rope]] and Rigging, "This is to protect the live or stress-bearing end of the rope against crushing and abuse. The flat bearing seat and extended prongs of the body (saddle) are designed to protect the rope and are always placed against the live end."&lt;ref&gt;S9086-UU-STM-010/CH-613R3 NAVAL SHIPS’ TECHNICAL MANUAL, CHAPTER 613, WIRE AND FIBER ROPE AND RIGGING {{cite web |url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/nstm/ch613.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305181751/http://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/nstm/ch613.pdf |archivedate=2015-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Navy and most regulatory bodies do not recommend the use of such clips as permanent terminations.

===Eye splice or Flemish eye===
[[Image:Wire rope eye splice.jpg|thumb|upright|The ends of individual strands of this eye splice used aboard a cargo ship are served with natural fiber cord after the splicing is complete. This helps protect seaman's hands when handling.]] An [[eye splice]] may be used to terminate the loose end of a wire rope when forming a loop. The strands of the end of a wire rope are unwound a certain distance. The wire is then bent around so that the end of the unwrapped length forms an eye and the unwrapped strands are then plaited back into the wire rope, forming the loop, or an eye, called an eye splice.

A Flemish eye, or Dutch Splice, involves un wrapping three strands (the strands need to be next to each other, not alternates) of the wire and keeping them off to one side. The remaining strands are bent around, until the end of the wire meets the "V" where the unwrapping finished, to form the eye. The strands kept to one side are now re-wrapped by wrapping from the end of the wire back to the V of the eye. These strands are effectively rewrapped along the wire in the opposite direction to their original lay.  When this type of rope splice is used specifically on wire rope, it is called a "Molly Hogan", and, by some, a "Dutch" eye instead of a "Flemish" eye.&lt;ref&gt;Primer of Towing / George H.

===Swaged terminations===
[[Swage|Swaging]] is a method of wire rope termination that refers to the installation technique. The purpose of swaging wire rope fittings is to connect two wire rope ends together, or to otherwise terminate one end of wire rope to something else. A mechanical or hydraulic swager is used to compress and deform the fitting, creating a permanent connection. There are many types of swaged fittings. Threaded Studs, Ferrules, Sockets, and [[Nicopress Swaged Sleeve|Sleeves]] are a few examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quicksearch.dla.mil/docimages/A/0000/0004/3418/000005718797_000000228723_FTKDGXBIOU.PDF?CFID=5371845&amp;CFTOKEN=80562982 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171210174032/http://quicksearch.dla.mil/docimages/A/0000/0004/3418/000005718797_000000228723_FTKDGXBIOU.PDF?CFID=5371845&amp;CFTOKEN=80562982 |archivedate=2017-12-10 |df= }} US Military Standard MS51844 Wire Rope Swaging Sleeve Standard&lt;/ref&gt; Swaging ropes with fibre cores is not recommended.

===Wedge sockets===
A wedge socket termination is useful when the fitting needs to be replaced frequently. For example, if the end of a wire rope is in a high-wear region, the rope may be periodically trimmed, requiring the termination hardware to be removed and reapplied. An example of this is on the ends of the drag ropes on a [[dragline excavator|dragline]]. The end loop of the wire rope enters a tapered opening in the socket, wrapped around a separate component called the wedge. The arrangement is knocked in place, and load gradually eased onto the rope. As the load increases on the wire rope, the wedge become more secure, gripping the rope tighter.

===Potted ends or poured sockets===
Poured sockets are used to make a high strength, permanent termination; they are created by inserting the wire rope into the narrow end of a conical cavity which is oriented in-line with the intended direction of strain. The individual wires are splayed out inside the cone or 'capel', and the cone is then filled with molten lead-antimony-tin (Pb&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) solder or 'white metal capping',&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite book

'''Wire rope spooling-Technology''' is the technology to prevent [[wire rope]] getting snagged when [[Cable reel|spooled]] especially in '''''multiple layers''''' on a drum.

==History==

Ever since the development of [[wire rope]], comprising multiple [[wire]] strands, spooling the wire has presented technical challenges. When wrapped in multiple layers, the upper layers have a tendency to crush the lower layers, while the lower layers have a tendency to pinch upper layers. The rubbing of rope against rope also has a tendency to cause wear.
These problems were addressed by Frank L. LeBus Sr., a supplier of drilling equipment to the oilfields of Texas, USA, who in 1938, patented the use of a groove bar on hoisting drums to guide the spooling of rope. Grooved shape steel segments were simply welded or screwed to existing plain steel drums.&lt;ref&gt;George F LeBus, [https://www.google.com/patents/US2204938 US Patent 2204938] &lt;/ref&gt; 
Ever since then, drum groovings have been widely used to guide the spooling of wire rope onto and off winch drums.
Introducing a continuous helical groove onto the drum, like the thread of a screw, provides a way to guide the rope when spooling onto or off a drum. However this has been shown to work effectively only when the rope is wrapped in a single layer. When the rope is wrapped in multiple layers, problems remain.
Frank LeBus introduced a grooving pattern that put the groove parallel to the flanges of the drum, except for a single slanted section across the drum face to act as crossover point, moving the rope along by the width of the groove with every revolution.

While the Lebus family business continues to produce this equipment today, patents have expired and other [[winch]] manufacturers also use the Lebus system. Any drum with a parallel groove and two cross-over points is often generically called ‘a Lebus drum’, regardless of the manufacturer.

==Applications==

The multilayer wire rope spooling system has undergone continuous refinement over the years and adapted for any application where long lengths of steel wire ropes must be wrapped in multiple layers quickly and smoothly. Examples include:
* Cranes for construction sites, offshore [[oil platform|oil rigs]], ports or onboard ships 
* Deep mining
* Winches aboard [[oceanography|Oceanographic]] [[research vessels]] and pipelaying barges
* Winches aboard [[fishing vessels]].
* [[Funicular railway]]s and [[cable car]]{{dn|date=November 2018}}s

==System advantages==

With the parallel groove system, rope wear is considerably reduced in multilayer spooling. 
[[File:Seiltrommeln1.jpg|thumb|Winch drums for multilayer wire rope Spooling]]

When the first layer has filled the drum, the second layer then travels back across the drum with each wrap of rope sitting precisely along the groove of two wraps of the first layer.
With parallel grooving it is possible to calculate the exact forces that the rope imposes on the drum because the spooling is controlled. 
[[File:Mehrlagen-Seilspulung-Prinzip2.jpg|thumb|Multilayer wire rope Spooling Pic 1]]

Cross winding is reduced to approximately 20 percent of the circumference of the drum, and 80 percent remains parallel to the flanges in the inner layer rope groove.
This parallel grooving evenly distributes the load between the individual layers and has been show to increase substantially – by more than 500percent, tests have shown – the life of the wire rope. The system has been used to mount ropes up. 
[[File:Mehrlagen-Seilspulung-Prinzip3.jpg|thumb|Multilayer wire rope Spooling Pic 2]]

In offshore applications, huge lengths of rope are often housed on drums. The anchor winches on Saipem’s Semac 1 pipe laying barge, for example, each hold 2,800 metres of 76mm (3 inch) diameter wire rope in 14 layers. Saipem’s Castorone, the world’s largest pipe laying vessel uses a wire rope that is 3,850m long and 152mm in diameter. It weighs 420t.  The rope is pulled by capstan and stored on a massive Rema [[traction winches]] that feature the parallel grooving system, with an approximately back tension of 40t on the capstan.
[[File:Mehrlagen-Seilspulung-Prinzip4.jpg|thumb|Multilayer wire rope Spooling Pic 3]]

==Required operating parameters==

To maximise the benefits of the parallel grooving system, certain operating conditions are required. These include:
;Application-specific design
Every system should be tailored to the application for which it is used. The groove pattern is engineered to suit the rope's length, diameter and construction type.
;Spooling under tension
In any multi-layer spooling application it is important that when the rope is first installed on the drum, it is done so under tension to avoid any slack on inner layers that can be crushed or nicked against the groove walls by outer layers.
;Correct fleet angle
The fleet angle is defined as the largest angle of the rope between the first sheave and the drum flange, relative to the centre line of the drum. With all type of drums, the rope is subject to a fleet angle which impacts on its behaviour and affects lifespan. 
Fleet angle should be between 0.25° and 1.25°, depending on the rope construction. The fleet angle can be varied by moving the first sheave closer to or further away from the drum. If the sheave is too close to the drum, the fleet angle will be greater than 1.25°; if it is too far away, the fleet angle will be less than 0.25°.

==Accessories==

Sometimes it is not possible to achieve the optimum fleet angle. Where there is no space to rig a sheave the requisite distance from the drum, two additional spooling devices are available. One is a fleet angle compensator, which is driven automatically by the rope tension. The other is a level winder that is mechanically driven. Both offer a solution to guide the cable along the drum between flanges, but each has its advantages and disadvantages.

==Fleet angle compensator==

The fleet angle compensator (FAC) is driven by the movement of the wire rope as it goes through the crossover sections of the drum. As the rope winds or unwinds, the FAC shaft automatically oscillates slowly, allowing its sheave to slide back and forth across the shaft to maintain an optimum fleet angle and guide the rope smoothly onto the drum.
[[File:SeilwindeKompensator.jpg|thumb|Fleet angle compensator for winch drum]]

==Screw level winder==

Level winders can be hydraulically or electrically driven and computer controlled, or they can be simple mechanical devices. A mechanical level winder comprises a main shaft (the lead screw) with [[helical screw]] grooving along which the rope feeder travels. The rope feeder housing includes two vertical roller bars and one horizontal roller, or alternatively a wire rope sheave. The lateral movement of the housing is generated by a chain drive sprocket ratio between drum and lead screw, as shown in the image. The automatic level winder fitted is designed and engineered to be compatible with the grooving on the drum.
Alternatively, a sheave can be integrated and installed within the housing frame. In this case, the system can be set up anywhere around the drum. 
Oceanographic installations that spool rope up to 46 layers have demonstrated that level winders give synchronized and controlled spooling in the harshest, most testing conditions.

==Split sleeves==

Grooving systems for multilayer spooling can be carved onto steel shells that are mounted onto old drums, by either bolting or welding, as an outer sleeve. Called split sleeves, they can be retrofitted onto old drums or mounted on new drums to allow a future change of application.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="955">'''Zero address arithmetic''' is a feature of a few innovative [[computer architectures]], whereby the assignment to a physical address space is deferred until programming statement execution time. It eliminates the [[Linker (computing)|link step]] of conventional compile and link architectures, and more generally [[Relocation (computing)|relocation]].

All [[Burroughs large systems]] and [[Burroughs medium systems|medium systems]] had this property, as do their modern day successors that preserve the original physical architecture.

The 1960 announcement of the [[English Electric KDF9]] is the first announcement of a zero-address instruction format computer, rapidly followed by the [[Burroughs B5000]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res18.htm#c "The KDF9 Computer - 30 Years On"]&lt;/ref&gt;
