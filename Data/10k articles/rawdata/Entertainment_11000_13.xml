'''''3 Ring Circus''''' is a 1954 American [[comedy film]] directed by [[Joseph Pevney]] and starring [[Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]].  The picture was shot from February 17 to March 31, 1954, and released on December 25 by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The supporting cast includes [[Joanne Dru]], [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]], [[Wallace Ford]], [[Sig Ruman]], [[Nick Cravat]], and [[Elsa Lanchester]].

==Plot==
Pete Nelson, a smooth operator who has just been discharged from the Army, joins forces with his old buddy, the loud Jerome X. Hotchkiss, and together they join a circus. The Clyde Brent Circus, to be exact. Jerry has taken a job as apprentice lion tamer. He is set on being a circus clown, but his plans are squandered when they meet the circus manager Sam Morley and owner Jill Brent, who is also ringmaster. The circus has financial problems, so the only way that both Pete and Jerry can be hired if they help out wherever needed.

Jerry dutifully reports to the designated lion tamer, Colonel Schlitz, but is terrified when Schlitz forces him into the lions' cage with only a whip and chair for protection. Schlitz keeps calling at him to behave coolly and to show no fear, but all Jerry can do is to nervously try to befriend the beasts. Schlitz pulls him out of the cage.

Later in the day Jerry and Pete are washing the elephants when Jill stops by to chat. Pete starts flirting, which she finds both attractive and annoying. Jerry sneaks into Puffo the Wonder Clown's tent and tries on his hats. Morley catches him red-handed and scolds him.

One night while working in a custard stand. Pete and Jerry are overwhelmed by the crowd and lose control of the machine. Morley sends Jerry to help Puffo dress for his performance. The arrogant clown rejects Jerry’s help. Jerry's next assignment is to hand Nero, the tightrope walker, a unicycle. The audience roars with laughter at Jerry's fumbling attempts to climb a rope ladder while holding the bike. When Jerry accidentally ends up riding the unicycle on the tightrope, the crowd hushes. Pete and the clowns rush in with a net and catch him when he falls.

Saadia, the Queen of the Trapeze, is up to perform. She goes into the ring and Pete is indeed breath-taken by her great beauty. Jill, however, dislikes the egotistical, greedy Saadia. Morley insists the circus would go bankrupt without her. To Jill's disgust, Pete agrees to become Saadia's personal assistant.

Morley then talks Jerry into becoming a human cannonball. Pete, wearing nothing on his upper body, shows off for Saadia, giving her a private demonstration of his skills on the parallel bars. Saadia is attracted to Pete, and they end up kissing. They are interrupted by the slightly jealous Jill, who informs Saadia that, for financial reasons, there will be an extra show on Saturday.

Saadia is well aware of that the survival of the circus depends on her, but she refuses to do the extra show. Pete, watching her perform to a capacity crowd, gets an idea how to save the circus.

Morley finally allows Jerry to go into the ring in place of a sick clown. Jerry is ecstatic, but one performer unhappy with Jerry’s big break is Puffo. He resents the cheap laughs that Jerry gets from the audience and starts bullying him in the ring. The audience is upset and starts to boo Puffo, wanting him to go off. After the show Jerry tells Puffo that he is not angry with him.

Pete flirts with a very receptive Jill, but when he asks about the circus's profits, she is furious and slaps him. Soon after, in Saadia's tent, Pete explains to Jill his plan to increase the profits with gambling. A skeptical Jill, who inherited the circus from her father, allows Pete to set up some gaming tables on the midway.

The circus continues its tour. On Jill’s birthday, Pete and Jerry throw her a big party. Puffo gets quite drunk and interrupts the festivities to declare he is quitting. He will consider staying on if Jerry and Pete are fired. Pete gets angry and punches Puffo in frustration. Jill later fires Puffo from the circus and replaces his act with Jerry.

Jerry starts performing under the name Jerricho. He is an instant hit with the audience, even bigger than Saadia, who gets jealous. So jealous she too threatens to quit unless the circus gets rid of Jerry. Tired of her ego, Pete tells her "drive carefully" and sends her on her way. Jill is quite relieved that the alluring Saadia is out of her way.

However, her relief is short-lived. She witnesses a fight between Pete's shell-game operator and a customer, then demands that Pete stop the gambling operation. Pete refuses and announces he is leaving the circus, too. Sure that the loyal Jerry will go with him, Jill insists on leaving instead, preferring to leave the circus to Pete than lose it entirely.

Jerry verbally attacks Pete for canceling a benefit performance for disadvantaged children. Pete then tells Jerry he "ain't nice" anymore, and quits. Jerry and the other clowns decide to perform the show anyway, and Jill meets them at the outdoor arena.

Jerry’s words ring in Pete’s head while Jerry performs and delights the children with his clowning. Jerry goes to great lengths to get a sad-faced handicapped girl to laugh. A car arrives in the ring out of it comes Pete, dressed in a clown suit. Jerry and Jill are delighted to see Pete join in the fun.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/21691/3-Ring-Circus/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast==
*[[Dean Martin]] as Peter "Pete" Nelson
*[[Jerry Lewis]] as Jerome F. "Jerry" Hotchkiss
*[[Joanne Dru]]	 as Jill Brent
*[[Zsa Zsa Gabor]] as Saadia
*[[Wallace Ford]] as Sam Morley
*[[Sig Ruman]] as Colonel Fritz Schlitz, Lion Tamer
*[[Gene Sheldon]] as Puffo the Clown
*[[Nick Cravat]] as Timmy

==Production==
The film was the first starring [[Martin and Lewis]] to be shot in [[VistaVision]]. A clip from it was shown in a promotional short film, ''Paramount Presents VistaVision''.

An edited version, removing, among other things, the early military and circus scenes of Martin and Lewis together, plus Martin's later music numbers, was released by Paramount in 1978 and shown at children's matinees. As the new title ''Jerrico The Wonder Clown'' implied, the resulting edit lessened Martin's screen-time and threw the emphasis to Lewis' character even more than in the original film.

==Home media==
Due to unknown reasons, the film remains the only Martin and Lewis film without a home release.

'''''AKB0048''''', stylized '''''AKB∞48''''', is a 2012 Japanese science fiction musical comedy [[anime]] television series based on the popular [[AKB48]] idol group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-11-25/akb48-akb0048-anime-gets-4-manga-series-in-4-mags |title=AKB48's ''AKB0048'' Anime Gets 4 Manga Series in 4 Mags|date=2011-11-25|accessdate= 2011-12-27|work=[[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anime is produced by [[Satelight]], with [[Shōji Kawamori]] as chief director and writer. The first season aired in Japan between April and July 2012 whilst the second season aired between January and March 2013.

==Plot==
At the start of the 21st century, an interplanetary war broke out. Earth's ecosystem was severely damaged, and humanity was forced to flee the planet, hence begin a new history with the Star Calendar starting from the year 0000. In several planets of this new society led by a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] government, the Deep Galactic Trade Organization [DGTO], things that "disturb the heart" like music and art are forbidden. The legendary idol group [[AKB48]] is later resurrected as the interplanetary troupe AKB0048, made up of girls who carry on the title and spirit of the original members. Since the government sees the existence of the idol group as illegal, the idol group cannot hold their concerts officially. AKB0048 also changed their concept from "idols you can meet" to "idols who see fans". Held as heroines by some and labeled as terrorists by others, they take up arms to bring their music to their fans wherever they are. The story follows a group of young hopefuls as they train to become the next generation of AKB0048.

===First Stage===

Four years prior to the story, [[#Main Characters|Chieri Sono]], while visiting Lancastar with her father, invites [[#Main Characters|Nagisa Motomiya]], [[#Main Characters|Orine Aida]] and [[#Main Characters|Yuuka Ichijo]] to watch AKB0048's dangerous performance at the planet's mining site as they battle the DES soldiers which attracts and inspires them to join the idol group. Four years later, Star Calendar Year 0048, Nagisa, Orine and Yuuka pass the idol group's first found audition and thus embark on a journey to Akibastar, the homeland of AKB0048 despite Nagisa's father's disapproval of joining the idol group. Meanwhile, Chieri escapes her father who does not approve of her in the same way as Nagisa's father and joins Nagisa, Orine and Yuuka. Also joining are Makoto Yokomizo, the timid girl, Suzuko Kanzaki, a bespectacled girl and Sonata Shinonome, an energetic young girl. All of them pass the second round audition conducted by Tsubasa Katagiri, the manager of AKB0048 and are chosen as the 77th generation trainees.

Arriving at Akibastar, the chosen 77th generation trainees settle down. Joining them are 75th generation trainees, Kanata Shinonome who is Sonata's sister and  Mimori Kishida who is Kanata's teammate. Kanata's relationship with her sister is hostile at first because she does not want the latter to risk her life, but soon she comes to accept her as part of the idol group. And so, the trainees undergo a life of concert performance training, singing and dancing, although sometimes they have a monthly day off. All the choreographies are planned by Mr. Ushiyama, a cross dressing man. Inside AKB0048, the trainees come into close relationships with successors Minami Takahashi the 5th (Shiori Arisawa), Yuuko Ooshima the 9th (Hikari Kimishima), Mayu Watanabe Type 3, Sayaka Akitomo the 10th (Akira Igarashi), Yuki Kashiwagi the 6th (Ayako Kuroki), Haruna Kojima the 8th (Chiharu Sakuragi) and Sae Miyazawa the 10th (Youko Asamiya) as they train and perform concerts together and meet fans at both handshake events and concerts held at entertainment-banned planets. Orine meets her hater, who is hostile to her at first but slowly gives her constructive suggestions to help her improve.

Takamina once begins to self-doubt when the kiraras choose Kanata as the ideal successor of Minami Takahashi. So she loses her form and becomes injured while fighting the DES machine. The group performs at Tundrastar, but Takamina forces herself to perform although being forced to be replaced by Kanata and at the end of the concert catches the succession fever in the process, but has recovered since then. After AKB's meeting, a gravure shoot for all the members, including the understudies is held at Atamistar. Tsubasa meets up with the camerawoman, Mikako Minamino, who is the former successor of Minami Minegishi and a former Center Nova. Minami declares she is against the idea of the Center Nova position being resurrected. When the idol group holds its concert at Lancastar, the DES know about it already and enforces stronger control over Lancastar; the WOTA (hardcore fans) protect the idol group along the way. Nagisa's father is caught by the DGTO authorities at the same time. Nagisa becomes worried about her father and soon loses her voice. The concert is held despite the threats and Nagisa's loss of voice but is interrupted in the middle by a DES attack. AKB suddenly hear Acchan's voice, the last Center Nova and with Acchan's voice the idol group is persuaded to fight on. WOTA rescue Nagisa's father and Nagisa later regains the voice back after she finds confidence in herself. Meanwhile, the Kirara are so impressed by Takamina's determination during the concert that they choose her as Minami Takahashi's rightful successor again. But as the DES attack becomes too intense, the concert ends earlier, and the group is forced to move out of Lancastar, heading to their next stage.

===Next Stage===

In the year since the 77th generation {{nihongo3|研究生|kenkyūsei|trainees |also understudies}} joined AKB0048, the Deep Galactic Trade Organization [DGTO], a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] galactic government and its national armed force, Destroy Entertainment Soldiers [DES] have stepped up their attacks on entertainment. AKB0048 continue their next stage and performs the concert at Atamistar. Manager Tsubasa announces to bring back the general elections and the Center Nova position. The same night after the concert, Chieri, Ayako and Sonata were caught by the DES to be tried in a High Court in Kasumigastar, the DGTO's capital, but are later freed by the rest of AKB0048 with the help of WOTA. The trial itself made Chieri famous throughout the galaxy and receives more work (such as photoshoots). Chieri's father starts developing artificial Kiraras while Tsubasa becomes curious as to how they were able to break into Kasumigastar so easily earlier. The understudies are now thrown into a new competition directly against the successors especially when the general election is approaching.

Soon later, the results of the general elections are announced with Hikari (Yuuko) announced winner of the top 10 list along with other successors in their respective rankings. Also included in the top 10 list were 77th generation trainee Chieri Sono in 6th place and 75th generation trainee Mimori Kishida in 10th place. The elected members are chosen for a concert on Baltistar, a planet completely under the entertainment ban. Meanwhile, the 77th generation trainees are chosen to infiltrate a nearby military base to undercover and investigate reports of people visiting the base and discover a hidden illegal casino there. The girls target the nuclear reactor hidden in the base, shut down the casino and escape with Higashino, the DES guard helped them in the process. Some time later, the Kirara of Succession show the original Atsuko's image, foretelling that someone may succeed her soon. Mikako is brought in as the group's official camerawoman as the group rehearse for a concert. After the rehearsal, Mimori comes down with a succession fever and Nagisa is chosen to stand in for her in the concert after Mimori collapsed during the break.

Mimori recovers from her fever and debut as a successor, inherited the name of Mariko Shinoda the 8th. Mikako unknowingly informs Chieri's father of the three conditions required for initiating the Center Nova phenomenon. Knowing this, the latter orders his company Zodiac, under the DES to go after an element known as Dualium that is hidden in Akibastar by launching a DES Force attack there one day when AKB hold another concert, putting the city into chaos and forcing AKB to struggle against the DES. AKB retreat from Akibastar due to escalating battle. During DGTO's occupation of Akibastar, AKB0048 barely manage to escape the DES in their ship and arrive above a strange planet to be repaired because it sustained the DES attack. The trainees are sent to gather data on the planet they landed on and in the process meet with the creatures there. A new bond of friendship is made as they defend the planet together and defeat the Zodiac machines that came out of the blue to attack the planet for dualium but sacrificing the nature there. Chieri and Nagisa later sneak on board of one of Zodiac's ships, taking them to Sagittariusstar so that Chieri can confront her father face to face. Chieri finally reaches her father and is told to exhibit her singing skills but witnesses her father assassinated by a person unknown in front of her when it just seems as if the former became friendlier towards her again. Chieri was sad and distraught over the death of her father. Nevertheless, she and her teammates show their fighting spirit to reclaim Akibastar. Back in Akibastar, the people there shows sign of hatred towards AKB because they feel betrayed by their retreat and turned against them since the DES is strongly controlling the planet. Despite this, Chieri, Nagisa and the others combine their feelings with the nameless emotions across the galaxy and fight back with love and music, getting the DES to withdraw, returning peace to Akibastar with Nagisa promoted as Atsuko Maeda the 14th and Chieri as the new Center Nova.

==Characters==
The story focuses mainly on a group of girls who are {{nihongo3|kenkyūsei|研究生|trainees}} in AKB0048. In the Japanese dub, they were voiced by actual members from [[AKB48]] and its sister groups, and are grouped as NO NAME to sing the opening and closing credits. The Successors are veteran members who are titled after members of the original AKB48 troupe, but their roles are performed by professional voice actresses. The other characters are also voiced by professional voice actor and actresses. In contrast to the Japanese dub, in the English dub they are all voiced by professional voice actors and actresses.

'''Adeline Software International''' was a [[video game developer]] founded in February 1993 as a subsidiary company of [[Delphine Software International]], and based in [[Lyon]], [[France]]. The team mostly came from [[Infogrames]], another French video game company, after a disagreement about sequels of the ''[[Alone in the Dark (video game)|Alone in the Dark]]'' bestseller.

== History ==
The company employed 21 people including graphic artists, developers and musicians. Five members made up the core of the team: [[Frédérick Raynal]] (creative director), Yaël Barroz (computer artist in charge of scenery), Didier Chanfray (artistic director), Serge Plagnol (technical director), and Laurent Salmeron (resource manager).

After the release of ''[[Little Big Adventure 2]]'' in 1997, the company slowly went quiet, and in July, the core team was sold to [[Sega]], becoming [[No Cliché]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Company | url = http://www.nocliche.com/english/societe/societe.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20010304155742/http://www.nocliche.com/english/societe/societe.htm | publisher = [[No Cliché]] | archivedate=March 4, 2001 | accessdate = September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and leaving Adeline as an empty group within Delphine.

Years after the apparent demise of Adeline, the brand was revived in 2002 by Delphine, and put it in charge of the development of ''[[Moto Racer Advance]]'', released for the [[Game Boy Advance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Craig | last = Harris | title = Moto Racer Advance Review | url = http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/382/382523p1.html | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = January 13, 2003 | accessdate = September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no members from the original Adeline staff were involved in the development. This new team at Adeline was also tasked with developing the game ''[[Flashback Legend]]'', a sequel to the ''[[Flashback (1992 video game)|Flashback]]'' series which ended up being cancelled during 2003. The liquidation of Delphine in July 2004 marked the definite death of Adeline.

A third Little Big Adventure game has been a talking topic since 2000.

==Mission==
All For One is dedicated to producing and developing extraordinary solo theater, and to creating opportunities for solo artists to enjoy sustaining careers.

Since 2011, All For One Theater has presented over 50 acclaimed full-length solo plays [[off-Broadway]]. In 2016, AFO launched its touring initiative to bring productions to stages across America and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afo.nyc/our-mission|title=allforone|website=allforone|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2011, All For One (also known as AFO) was founded by producer Michael Wolk in 2011 as an annual solo theater festival. AFO presented the first of three annual festivals of solo theater that year, offering professional development workshops and providing free panels addressing concerns in the solo show community. The festivals presented a range of solo show artists, including work directed by [[Lynne Taylor-Corbett]], [[BD Wong]], [[Colman Domingo]], a world premiere by [[Deb Margolin]], and the New York premiere of [[Leslie Jordan]]'s ''Fruit Fly''.

In 2014, AFO transitioned from producing an annual festival to producing a year-round season of local, national, and international solo theater. AFO's first full season featured four fully produced solo shows and SoloLab, a celebration of new work that featured reading and workshop performances from nine solo artists.

Since 2015, under Producing Director Nicholas Cotz, AFO focuses on producing shows in New York City, with the goal of touring each show and providing a sustaining income for its artists.

AFO is dedicated to fostering the next generation of solo artists through two play development programs: AFO Solo Collective (AFO|SoCo), a new play development series that nurtures the development of mid-career solo artists and their audiences through cross-disciplinary exchange, peer-driven workshops, and panel discussions;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afo.nyc/artist-in-residence|title=allforone|website=allforone|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an 18-month Artist In Residence (AIR) program that develops a single new work, resulting in an off-Broadway production. The AIR program provides an artist with rehearsal space over 18 months, and stipends to be used for the services of a director, dramaturg, and/or designers to support the development of their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afo.nyc/afo-soco|title=allforone|website=allforone|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; All For One also occasionally offers classes on particular aspects of solo work.&lt;ref&gt;http://allforonetheater.org/classes-archive/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Ange Vierge'''''|アンジュ・ヴィエルジュ|Anju Vieruju}} is a Japanese [[digital collectible card game]] released by [[Fujimi Shobo]] and [[Media Factory]], two [[brand]] companies of [[Kadokawa Corporation]]. It was first announced in 2013. The franchise theme song is by L.I.N.K.s, a group composed of the voice actresses [[Yūka Aisaka]], [[Mai Ishihara]], [[Yoshiko Ikuta]], [[Rie Takahashi]], and [[Nozomi Yamamoto]].

A [[manga]] series titled ''Ange Vierge Linkage'' by Mako Komao with art by Sakaki Yoshioka was serialized in [[Fujimi Shobo]]'s ''[[shōnen manga|shōnen]]'' manga magazine ''[[Monthly Dragon Age]]'' between 2014 and 2015, and was collected in two ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes.

On April 20, 2017, Kadokawa announced that further development of the trading card game has been discontinued. A final tournament will take place in May 2017, with the franchise's tournaments and campaigns ending at the end of June 2017. The franchise's website will be shut down on March 31, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=【重要】TCG商品展開休止のお知らせ|url=https://ange-vierge.com/news/?id=710|publisher=[[Kadokawa Corporation]]|accessdate=April 21, 2017|date=April 20, 2017|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ange Vierge Trading Card Game Stops Development|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-04-20/ange-vierge-trading-card-game-stops-development/.115054|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=April 21, 2017|date=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Balham, Gateway to the South'''" is a [[comedy sketch]] [[parody]]ing a short [[travel documentary]] about the [[South London]] suburb of [[Balham, London|Balham]]. It was written by [[Frank Muir]] and [[Denis Norden]] for the short-lived BBC radio series ''Third Division'', and was featured in the second edition on 2 February 1949. It compared the area, during [[Postwar Britain|postwar austerity]], to faraway exotic locations depicted in travelogues of the day.{{sfn|Muir|1997|p=157}}{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=46}} One memorable part of the sketch is the pronunciation of Balham as "Bal-Ham" in an American accent, instead of the British pronunciation "Ballum".

The original sketch was performed by [[Peter Sellers]] as narrator, with others such as [[Benny Hill]] and [[Michael Bentine]] contributing other voices. The script features the narration of exaggerated claims regarding the attractions of the area. The sketch was later performed solo by [[Peter Sellers]], in a parody of the American newsreel-travelogue host [[James A. Fitzpatrick]], on the 1958 [[Parlophone]] record ''The Best of Sellers'', produced by [[George Martin]].{{sfn|Muir|1997|p=157}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/4th-july-1998/94/radio|title=The cure for SAD-ROM|last=Vestey|first=Michael|date=1998-07-04|work=[[The Spectator]]|accessdate=2013-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Peter Sellers – The Best Of Sellers |url=https://www.discogs.com/Peter-Sellers-The-Best-Of-Sellers/release/919883 |website=Discogs |accessdate=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sketch was scored by [[Ron Goodwin]], and that led [[Alfred Hitchcock]] to engage him to do the score for ''[[Frenzy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gleason |first1=Alexander |title=Ron Goodwin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jan/11/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries |accessdate=2018-09-04 |work=The Guardian |date=2003-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sketch was expanded in 1979 to form the script of a short (21-minute) colour film of the same name directed by [[Micky Dolenz]]. Starring [[Danny Schiller]] and [[Judy Gridley]] as American tourists and [[Robbie Coltrane]] in several roles, including those originally voiced by Sellers. It was narrated, in an English accent, by [[David de Keyser]] and was released for broadcast in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Balham: Gateway to the South (1979) |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6f14cb15 |website=BFI Film Forever |accessdate=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Balham – Gateway to the South |url=http://www.tvcream.co.uk/telly/tv-a-z/a-m/b-is-for/balham-gateway-to-the-south/ |website=TC Cream |accessdate=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bangladesh Television''' ({{lang-bn|বাংলাদেশ টেলিভিশন}}), also known by the acronym '''BTV''', is the state-owned Television network in [[Bangladesh]]. It started broadcasting as [[Pakistan Television]] in what was then [[East Pakistan]] on 25 December 1964.   It was renamed Bangladesh Television after the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|independence]] in 1971.  Broadcasts in full colour started in 1980. About 2 million televisions receive transmissions from the network's 17 relay stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bangladesh.com/tv/ |title=Television of Bangladesh |publisher=Bangladesh.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081222072404/http://www.bangladesh.com/tv/ |archivedate= 22 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no |access-date=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BTV has a national channel which is broadcast from [[Dhaka]]. This transmission is relayed to the whole country via local relay stations in major cities of the country. There is also a regional station located in [[Chittagong]] which broadcasts local programmes in the evening. In the mid-1990s the national TV channel started to broadcast the news programs of BBC and CNN.  In 2004, BTV started worldwide broadcasts through its satellite based branch, [[BTV World]].

BTV is primarily financed through the [[television licence]] fees. Although it has produced many award-winning programmes, it has often been criticised for being the mouth-piece of the ruling government and their lack of quality entertaining programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Media men slam ministry for poor BTV standards |url=http://international.ucla.edu/institute/article/12950 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=22 July 2004 |access-date=24 June 2011 |via=UCLA International Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
BTV started its black-and-white transmission on 25 December 1964, as a pilot project in the then [[East Pakistan]], airing a song by the singer [[Ferdausi Rahman]]. It began from the DIT Bhaban (present Rajuk Bhaban) on a four-hour basis. In 1972, after the [[independence of Bangladesh]], the previously autonomous organisation was made a full-fledged government department. In 1975, the offices and studios were shifted to Rampura, Dhaka.&lt;ref name=beyond&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/suppliments/2006/15thanniv/celebrating_bd/celeb_bd18.htm|title=From BTV to ETV and beyond: The television revolution|date=4 February 2006|accessdate=6 August 2017|newspaper=The Daily Star|first=Novera|last=Deepita}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BTV started colour transmission in 1980 through a programme named ''"Desher Gaan"'' produced by Selim Ashraf. In 2004, BTV launched its satellite transmission under the name of [[BTV World]].&lt;ref name=beyond/&gt;

The first drama on BTV, ''"Ektala Dotala"'', written by [[Munier Choudhury]], was aired in 1965. In 1979, inspired by the idea of [[David Frost|The David Frost Show on BBC]], a new magazine programme, ''"Jodi Kichhu Mone Na Koren"'', was developed by [[Fazle Lohani]]. Children's competition series ''[[Notun Kuri]]'' started in 1976. The first television commercial was made in 1967 for a detergent soap ''707''. In 1994, BTV telecast the first private production, a one-hour play ''Prachir Periye'', directed by [[Atiqul Haque Chowdhury]].&lt;ref name=beyond/&gt;

===International programs===
From the late 1980s to the late 2000s, BTV aired lots of international programs, including children's TV shows, cartoons, and many popular English TV series. BTV did not encourage dubbing those shows, as this was seen as a step in pushing children and adults alike to get acquainted with the English language and its various accents outside of the regular academic environment and in a fully entertaining form.

Some of the many popular English TV programs and cartoons aired on BTV were:

'''Bess Myerson''' (July 16, 1924 &amp;ndash; December 14, 2014) was an American politician, model and television actress who became famous in 1945 as the first Jewish [[Miss America 1945|Miss America]]. Myerson is the only Jewish woman to win the title.   

Her achievement, in the aftermath of [[the Holocaust]], was seen as an affirmation of the Jewish place in American life. She was a hero to the Jewish community,&lt;ref name="Times obit"&gt;{{Citation | last = Nemy | first = Enid | author-link = Enid Nemy

Myerson made frequent television appearances during the 1950s and 1960s. She was a commissioner in the [[Government of New York City|New York City government]] and served on presidential commissions from the 1960s through the 1980s, and ran unsuccessfully for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. Her career in public service ended in the late 1980s when she was indicted on bribery and conspiracy charges. She was acquitted after a highly publicized trial.&lt;ref name="Times obit"/&gt;

==Biography==
Myerson was born in [[The Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]]&lt;ref name="harbio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/mobile/.premium-1.605276?v=503B9CC881CBD6429FF0EA9AA147268D|title=This day in Jewish history/A Jewish Miss America who scandalized the press is born|last=Green|first=David|date=2014-07-16|publisher=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Louis Myerson and Bella (née Podell), who were Jewish [[Russian Jews|immigrants from Russia]]. Myerson's father worked as a [[housepainter]], [[handyman]], and [[carpenter]]. After Myerson's birth, the family  moved from the [[South Bronx]] to [[Shalom Aleichem Houses]], a cooperative apartment complex in the northern Bronx.&lt;ref name="harbio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.6tocelebrate.org/site/shalom-aleichem-houses/ |title=New York Historic Districts Council |publisher=6tocelebrate.org |date=2013-08-07 |accessdate=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://riverdalepress.com/stories/Shalom-Aleichem-owner-will-fight-to-stay,48649?page=2 | title=Shalom Aleichem owner will fight to stay | publisher=The Riverdale Press | date=May 25, 2011 | accessdate=January 6, 2015 | author=Adam Wisnieski | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had three siblings: a younger sister, Helen; an elder sister, Sylvia; and a brother, Joseph, who died at the age of three before Myerson was born.&lt;ref name="Times obit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, pp. 10, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Her upbringing emphasized the importance of scholarship, not physical beauty. In addition to tradesmen, her neighbors included poets, writers, and artists.  Myerson reached her adult height when she was 12, towered over other children, and has said she felt "awkward and gawky" during her [[preadolescence]]. Myerson recalled one of her worst childhood memories was playing the [[Popeye]] character, [[Olive Oyl]], in an elementary school play.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Times obituary" /&gt;

Myerson began studying piano when she was nine years old and was in the second class of New York's [[The High School of Music &amp; Art|High School of Music and Art]] in 1937, graduating in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to [[Hunter College]], graduating with honors in 1945 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in music.&lt;ref name="Times obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="harbio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="encycomp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/myerson-bess|title=Jewish Women's Archive: Bess Myerson|work=Jewish Women's Archive|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To support herself and her family while in college she gave piano lessons for fifty cents an hour, and worked as a music counselor at a girl's summer camp in Vermont.&lt;ref name="harbio" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, pp. 1, 57&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miss America===
By the time she was 21, Myerson was {{convert|5|ft|10|in|cm}} tall with "luxuriant brown hair".&lt;ref name="Times obit"/&gt; Myerson was entered into the Miss New York City competition, without her knowledge, by John C. Pape, a retired steel magnate and amateur photographer who had employed her as a model while she was in college. When Myerson was told about the pageant by her sister, Sylvia, who was acquainted with Pape, Myerson was angry as she felt that the beauty business was "embarrassing." However, she was persuaded to compete by Sylvia, and she competed in the swimsuit competition using a borrowed bathing suit.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Myerson went on to enjoy competing in the pageant, in which she stood out from the other contestants because of her height. She won on August 15, 1945, and moved on to the Miss America competition, partly motivated by the $5,000 scholarship awarded to the winner.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;  She later told interviewers she wanted to buy a black [[Steinway piano|Steinway grand piano]] with the scholarship money.&lt;ref name="harbio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Times obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nymag"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berman|first1=Susan|title=Bess Myerson Is One Tough Customer|url=http://nymag.com/news/politics/49908/#|accessdate=5 January 2015|work=New York|date=14 November 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myerson was the [[Miss New York]] entry in the 1945 Miss America pageant,&lt;ref name="Times obit"/&gt; and she competed in the talent portion of the contest by performing the music of [[Edvard Grieg]] and [[George Gershwin]].&lt;ref name="LA Times obituary"/&gt; Prior to the competition she was pressured to use a pseudonym that "sounded less Jewish." Myerson refused&lt;ref name=encycomp/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/missamerica/peopleevents/e_inclusion.html People &amp; Events: Breaking the Color Line at the Pageant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405154103/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/missamerica/peopleevents/e_inclusion.html |date=2016-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was subjected to substantial [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref name="Times obit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Invisible Stars: A Social History of Women in American Broadcasting 2d ed. | publisher=[[M. E. Sharpe]] | author=[[Donna Halper|Halper, Donna]] | year=2014 | pages=132–133 | isbn=9780765636706}}&lt;/ref&gt; After she won the title on September 8, 1945, three of the pageant's five sponsors withdrew from having her represent their companies as Miss America.&lt;ref name="harbio"/&gt;&lt;ref name=encycomp/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;
 
With the pageant scholarship money, she paid for graduate studies at [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]] and [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name="harbio"/&gt;  An aspiring pianist, she briefly gave recitals on the [[vaudeville]] circuit before realizing audiences were more interested in seeing her in a bathing suit.&lt;ref name="LA Times obituary"/&gt; She also played with the [[New York Philharmonic]] and appeared at [[Carnegie Hall]].&lt;ref name="Times obit"/&gt;

While Myerson was on her year-long tour as Miss America, she encountered "No Jews" signs posted in places such as hotels and country clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/bess-myerson-on-being-the-first-and-only-jewish-miss-america/2015/01/06/9a09d16a-95e5-11e4-8385-866293322c2f_story.html | title=Bess Myerson on being the first (and only) Jewish Miss America | publisher=Washington Post | date=6 January 2015 | accessdate=January 7, 2015 | author=Kevin Eckstrom, Religion News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such experiences led her to conduct lectures on behalf of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) entitled "You Can't Be Beautiful and Hate".&lt;ref name=encycomp/&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR-1-6-15"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCallister|first1=Doreen|title=From Miss America To Tabloid Fodder: Bess Myerson Dies At 90|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/01/06/375323845/bess-myerson-dies-at-90-from-miss-america-to-tabloid-fodder |department=The Two Way (blog) |publisher=National Public Radio|access-date=7 January 2015|date=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myerson became a vocal opponent of antisemitism and racism, and her speaking tour became the highlight of her Miss America reign.&lt;ref name="VOA obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bess Myerson, First Jewish Miss America, Dies at 90|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/bess-myerson-miss-america-dies/2586999.html|accessdate=7 January 2015|work=Voice of America|date=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At her death, the [[Religion News Service]] observed that at the time that she won the pageant, emaciated concentration camp survivors had only just shed their prison clothes. "Bess Myerson represented the resurrection of the Jewish body—the journey from degradation to beauty." &lt;ref name="RNS -1-6-15"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Salkin|first1=Jeffrey|title=Why Bess Myerson still matters|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/why-bess-myerson-still-matters-commentary/2015/01/06/379a2d0c-95d8-11e4-8385-866293322c2f_story.html|accessdate=7 January 2015|work=The Washington Post|agency=Religion News Service|date=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television and politics===

A few years after hearing her speak at an ADL function, television producer Walt Framer hired Myerson for the 1950s game show ''[[The Big Payoff]]''. She was the "Lady in Mink" modeling the grand prize mink coat, and introducing guests and prizes, throughout the 1951 to 1959 network run of the program.&lt;ref name="LA Times obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lepson|first1=Lisa|title=Bess Myerson| url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/myerson-bess|website=Encyclopedia|publisher=Jewish Women's Archive|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognized for her wit and hard work, as well as her beauty, in 1954 Myerson was a panelist on the game show ''[[The Name's the Same]]'' and from 1958 through 1967 a panelist on ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''.&lt;ref name="Times obit" /&gt; She regularly substituted for [[Dave Garroway]] on the ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]]''.&lt;ref name="LA Times obituary"/&gt; She was also a host of the television broadcast of the Miss America pageant from 1954 to 1968.&lt;ref name="LA Times obituary"/&gt;

Myerson stepped down from her other commitments in 1969 when appointed by Mayor [[John V. Lindsay]] to become the first Commissioner of the [[New York City Department of Consumer Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Times 3 Feb 1969"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lindsay Names Bess Myerson to Aid Shopper|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1969/02/03/77437246.pdf|accessdate=19 January 2015|work=The New York Times|date=3 February 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her career as a commercial pitchwoman for a number of products throughout the 1950s and 1960s had led to her becoming a consultant to several consumer products companies.

In 1980, Myerson vied for the Democratic nomination in New York's [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] race against Congresswoman [[Elizabeth Holtzman]], Queens District Attorney John J. Santucci, and Lindsay. Myerson lost to Holtzman by a slim margin. Holtzman was subsequently defeated by [[Al D'Amato]], who had defeated incumbent Senator [[Jacob Javits]] in the Republican primary.&lt;ref name="harbio"/&gt;

In 2002, Myerson appeared in the [[documentary film]] ''[[Miss America (2002)|Miss America]]'' as a former Miss America interviewee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/missamerica/filmmore/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511111623/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/missamerica/filmmore/index.html |archivedate=2015-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Bess Mess"===
After assuming a prominent role in the Koch administration in 1983 as Commissioner of the [[New York City Department of Cultural Affairs|Department of Cultural Affairs]], her career became overshadowed by scandal. She became romantically involved with a married sewer contractor, [[Carl Andrew Capasso]]. It soon emerged that [[Hortense Gabel]] (the judge involved in Capasso's divorce case) had started socializing with Myerson. Judge Gabel's daughter (Sukhreet) was also hired by Myerson. After Gabel cut Capasso's child support payments, investigations began as to whether or not she had been bribed. In April 1987, after she invoked the [[Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|Fifth Amendment]], Myerson was forced to resign her position with the Koch administration. The scandal became known as the "Bess Mess".&lt;ref name="Times obit" /&gt;

Indicted a year later by the office of then–[[U.S. Attorney]] [[Rudolph Giuliani]], Myerson, Capasso, and Gabel were tried on federal charges of conspiracy, mail fraud, obstruction of justice, and using interstate facilities to violate state bribery laws, accused of conspiring to reduce Capasso's child support payments.&lt;ref name="Capasso obit"/&gt; With Sukhreet as the prosecution's chief witness, the main issue at the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|U.S. District Court]] trial was whether Myerson's decision to hire Sukhreet constituted bribery.  After four months of trial proceedings, all three defendants were acquitted.&lt;ref name="Times obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Times obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,956639,00.html|title=Miss America Wins Again|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=January 2, 1989|accessdate=November 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capasso was separately convicted of unrelated tax charges.&lt;ref name="Capasso obit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saulny|first1=Susan|title=Carl A.

===Personal life===
In October 1946, Myerson married Allan Wayne, a recently discharged U.S. Navy [[Captain (naval)|captain]].  They had one daughter, Barbara, born in 1948.&lt;ref name=encycomp/&gt;  The marriage was marred by domestic violence, and the couple divorced after eleven years.&lt;ref name="Times obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name=encycomp/&gt;&lt;ref name="nymag" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804056,00.html|title=Milestones, October 28, 1946|work=Time|date=October 28, 1946|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myerson's second marriage was to attorney Arnold Grant, and he legally adopted her daughter in 1962.  The couple divorced in the early 1970s.  Daughter Barbara later became an actress, director, and screenwriter who is now known as [[Barra Grant]].&lt;ref name=encycomp/&gt;

Before her federal trial began, Myerson was arrested in May 1988 for [[shoplifting]] in [[South Williamsport, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/28/nyregion/bess-myerson-is-accused-of-shoplifting.html|title=Bess Myerson Is Accused Of Shoplifting|publisher=New York Times|date=May 28, 1988|accessdate=January 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She pleaded guilty to retail theft and was ordered to pay a fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/16/nyregion/myerson-pleads-guilty-to-shoplifting-charge-in-pennsylvania.html|title=Myerson Pleads Guilty to Shoplifting Charge in Pennsylvania|publisher=New York Times|date=July 16, 1988|accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myerson survived [[ovarian cancer]] in the 1970s and experienced a mild [[Cerebral vascular accident|stroke]] in 1981, from which she made a full recovery. She moved to Florida in 2002, and later moved to California, where she remained until her death.  Myerson donated funds to help build "Bessie's Bistro" at the [[Jewish Museum of Florida|Jewish Museum of Florida-FIU]] in memory of her parents Bella and Louis Myerson who lived in the neighborhood near the Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jmof.fiu.edu|title=Jewish Museum of Florida|website=Jewish Museum of Florida-FIU}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, she was reported to be suffering from [[dementia]].&lt;ref name="LA Times obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JWeekly 1995"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Soloff|first1=Emily D.|title=Bess Myerson reflects on fame, Miss America and Judaism|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/1739/bess-myerson-reflects-on-fame-miss-america-and-judaism|accessdate=5 January 2015|work=JWeekly.com|date=6  October 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="People - June 1987"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Michelle|title=Downfall of An American Idol: How Did Miss America Bess Myerson, Famous for Her Beauty and Brains, Get Entangled in a Growing Political Scandal?|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20096618,00.html|accessdate=5 January 2015|work=People|date=29 June 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily News 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dillon|first1=Nancy|title=Ed Koch's pal, former Miss America Bess Myerson, was a constant at his side|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/koch-pal-myerson-constant-side-article-1.1253714|accessdate=5 January 2015|work=The Daily News|date=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CRACK International Art Camp (CIAC)''' is a multi-disciplinary [[Artist-in-residence|art camp]] arranged every year over several days in Smaran Matshya Beej Khamar, a [[Fish hatchery|fish seed farm]] in [[Rahimpur]], [[Kushtia]], [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name=matter&gt;Nahad-Ul-Quasem Orchid, [http://mattersofart.net/reviews-details.aspx?mpgid=5&amp;pgid=5&amp;rid=62 Exploring the notions of emptiness and fulfilment], Matters of Art&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the outdoor art camp is promoting inter-disciplinary art collaborations. It was launched in 2007 by artist and researcher [[Shawon Akand]],&lt;ref name=sum&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhakaartsummit.org/programme/talks-programme/ |title=Talks Programme - Dhaka Art Summit 2016 |work=Dhaka Art Summit}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with artist Delowar Hossain as Crack International Art Camp.&lt;ref name=matter/&gt;

The art camp tries to blur the lines between creative disciplines and therefore engages people from various disciplines, including but not limited to theatre activists, photographers, film makers, musicians, psychologists, singers, poets, writers, journalists, actors, anthropologists, folklorists, historians, and art critics.&lt;ref name=sum/&gt;

In 2009, Centre for Research on Art and Culture (CRAC), a research based organization of Bangladesh, took over the total responsibility of this Art Camp renaming it as CRAC International Art Camp.&lt;ref name=lant&gt;[http://www.artslant.com/ind/events/show/308267-crack-international-artist-residecy-2013 Crack International Artist Residency], Artslant India&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, CRACK Bangladesh, a not for profit organization, took over the all responsibility of the art camp.&lt;ref name=lant/&gt; In 2014, CRACK Bangladesh became CRACK Trust.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Staines, [http://culture360.asef.org/opportunity/bangladesh-crack-international-art-camp-2014/ CRACK International Art Camp 2014], ASEF Culture 360&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cinema of Bangladesh''' is the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] language film industry based in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]]. It has often been a significant film industry since the early 1970s and is frequently referred to as "Dhallywood" ({{lang-bn|ঢালিউড}}), which is a portmanteau of the words [[Dhaka]] and [[Hollywood]]. The dominant style of Bangladeshi cinema is [[melodrama]]tic cinema, which developed from 1947 to 1990 and characterizes most films to this day. Cinema was introduced in Bangladesh in 1898 by the Bradford Bioscope Company, credited to have arranged the first film release in Bangladesh. Between 1913 and 1914, the first production company, Picture House, was opened. A 1928 short silent film titled ''Sukumari'' (''The Good Girl'') was the first Bengali-produced film in the region. The first full-length film, ''The Last Kiss'', was released in 1931. Following the separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan, [[Dhaka]] became the center of the Bangladeshi film industry, and has generated the majority share of revenue, production and audiences for Dhallywood films. ''[[Mukh O Mukhosh|The Face and the Mask]]'', the first Bengali-language full-length feature film of Bangladesh was produced in 1956.&lt;ref name=cholochitro&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Bangladeshi Film |url=http://www.cholochitro.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=33&amp;Itemid=49 |website=cholochitro.com |publisher=Cholochitro |accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mukh O Mukhosh"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mukh O Mukhosh |url=http://www.bfa.gov.bd/movie/details.html?id=100 |publisher=bfa.gov.bd |accessdate=14 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129021323/http://www.bfa.gov.bd/movie/details.html?id=100 |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, many Dhallywood films were inspired by Indian films, with some of the films being unofficial remakes of those films. The industry continued to grow, and many successful Bangladeshi films were produced throughout the 1970s, 1980s and the first half of the 1990s.

Directors such as [[Fateh Lohani]], [[Zahir Raihan]], [[Alamgir Kabir (film maker)|Alamgir Kabir]], [[Khan Ataur Rahman]], [[Subhash Dutta]], [[Ritwik Ghatak]], [[Ehtesham]], [[Chashi Nazrul Islam]], [[Abdullah al Mamun]], [[Sheikh Niamat Ali]], [[Gazi Mazharul Anwar]], [[Tanvir Mokammel]], [[Tareque Masud]], [[Morshedul Islam]], [[Humayun Ahmed]], [[Mostofa Sarwar Farooki]], [[Zahidur Rahim Anjan]], Khijir Hayat Khan, [[Kamar Ahmed Saimon]], Bijon Imtiaz, [[Amitabh Reza Chowdhury]], Fakhrul Arefeen Khan, Giasuddin Selim, Nurul Alam Atik, Dipankar Sengupta Dipon and others have made significant contributions to Bangladeshi [[mainstream]] cinema, [[parallel cinema]], and [[art film]]s. Some have also won global acclaim.

== History ==

=== Origin ===

On 28 December 1895, the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]] began commercial bioscope shows in [[Paris]], with the first bioscope shows of the Indian subcontinent occurring the following year, including one in [[Calcutta]] and another at the Crown Theatre in Dhaka. The Bradford Bioscope Company of Calcutta arranged the show, which featured very short news items and other short features including footage of the jubilee of Queen Victoria, battles between Greek and Turkish forces, and the French underground railway.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;{{rp|pages 7, 9}} The price of a ticket to the show was an expensive eight anas to three taka. Bioscope shows continued to be shown throughout the region, inclding in [[Bhola]], [[Manikganj]], [[Gazipur District|Gazipur]], [[Rajbari District|Rajbari]], and [[Faridpur Sadar Upazila|Faridpur]].&lt;ref name=cholochitro/&gt; These became the first films ever to be released in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;{{rp|pages 7, 9}}

The first seeds of Bengali cinema were sown by [[Hiralal Sen]], a native of Bogjuri who is considered a stalwart of [[Victorian era]] cinema.&lt;ref name= VF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/sen.htm|title=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema - Hiralal Sen|website=www.victorian-cinema.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sen founded a company named The [[Royal Bioscope Company]] in 1898, producing scenes from the stage productions of a number of popular shows&lt;ref name=VF /&gt; at the [[Star Theatre, Calcutta|Star Theater]], [[Minerva Theatre, Kolkata|Minerva Theater]], and Classic Theater in [[Kolkata]]. He pioneered film-making in the Calcutta in 1901, and shot footage in his home region. This was the first filming of what is now the nation of Bangladesh.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

At the time when Calcutta-based film production houses were forming, East Bengal cinema halls were showing films produced in Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Hollywood, and Paris. Sequential bioscope shows were started in Dhaka in 1913–14 in a jute store. It was named Picture House, becoming the first theater to be built in present-day Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=cholochitro/&gt;

=== Silent era ===
The [[Madan Theatre]] started making films in Calcutta in 1916. The first Bengali feature film, ''[[Billwamangal]]'', was produced and released in 1919 under the banner of the Madan Theatre. The movie was directed by Rustomji Dhotiwala and produced by Priyonath Ganguli, the son of a [[nawab]] estate of Dhaka. A Bengali film organization named the [[Indo British Film Co]] was soon formed in Calcutta under the ownership of [[Dhirendra Nath Ganguly]], a relative of [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. Ganguly directed and wrote ''[[Bilat Ferat(1921)|Bilat Ferat]]'' in 1921. The film was the first production of the [[Indo British Film Co]]. The Madan Theatre production of ''[[Jamai Shashthi]]''(1931) was the first Bengali [[talkie]] directed by [[Amar Choudhury]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In 1927–28, the Dhaka nawab family produced a short film named ''Sukumari'' (The Good Girl).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Liberation Struggles of a Country and a Festival |url=http://www.dhakafilmfestival.org/the-liberation-struggles-ofa-country-and-a-festival/ |website=dhakafilmfestival.org |publisher=Dhaka Film Festival |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111212011/http://www.dhakafilmfestival.org/the-liberation-struggles-ofa-country-and-a-festival/ |archive-date=11 January 2014 |access-date=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's producers included Khaza Adil, Khaza Akmol, Khaza Nasirulla, Khaza Azmol, Khaza Zohir, Khaza Azad, Soyod Shahebe Alom, and professor Andalib Shadini. They wanted to make a film with their own actors and without the help of a studio. The male lead was played by Khaza Nosrulla, and the female lead was played by a male actor named Soyod Abdus Sobhan owing to laws against the depiction of women in film. Nosrulla went on to become a politician and Sobhan became the first Bengali secretary of the Pakistan Central Civil Service. One still picture of ''Sukumary'' is kept in Bangladesh Film Archive.&lt;ref name=cholochitro/&gt;

After the success of ''Sukumari'', the royal family went for a bigger venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Raju |first=Zakir |date=2015 |title=Bangladesh Cinema and National Identity: In Search of the Modern |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PnLfBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT91 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |page=91 |isbn=978-0-415-46544-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make a full-length silent film, a temporary studio was made in the gardens of the family, and they produced a full-length silent film titled ''The Last Kiss'', released in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dhaka Nawab Family and Film |url=http://www.nawabbari.com/main_arts.html?string=lastKiss.html |website=www.nawabbari.com |publisher=Nawab Bari |accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Did you know?

The physical teacher of [[Jagannath University|Jagannath College]], Ambujgupta, directed the film and made the Bengali and English subtitles for it. Professor Andalib Shadani of the [[University of Dhaka|Dhaka University]] made the Urdu subtitles. ''The Last Kiss'' was released in the Mukul Hall of Dhaka. Historian Dr. Romesh Chondro Mojumder started the premier show of the film. The print of the film was taken to the Aurora Company of Calcutta for bigger presentation. The developers of the film wanted to make Dhaka unique in art, literature and cinema and named their production house “Dhaka East Bengal Cinematograph Society”. It was the first film-producing organization of Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=cholochitro/&gt;

=== Early development ===

==== Pakistan era ====

By 1947, there were around 80 cinemas in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041205103028/http://www.bangladesh.net/cinema/ A Brief History of Bangladesh Cinema], accessed 27 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages 1, 3}}After the [[partition of India]] in 1947, there were efforts to turn Dhaka into [[East Bengal]]'s cultural center, with various individuals like Abbasuddin Ahmed creating short-lived film production companies in the city. In March 1948, when the [[Governor-General of Pakistan]] [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]] came to visit [[East Pakistan]], the radio broadcaster and filmmaker Nazir Ahmed was commissioned to create the informational film ''In Our Midst''  with the help of Calcutta-based film technicians. It was the first informational film of Bangladesh.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===== 1950s =====
Two years after the creation of the [[Bengali Language Movement]] in 1952, the film-making company ''Co-operative Film Makers, Ltd.'' was formed in Dhaka under the leadership of Shohidul Alam, Abdul Jabbar Khan, and Kazi Nruzzaman. The company produced ''Salamot'' (1954) under the direction of Nazir Ahmed. The film was commercially successful and allowed the company to grow. In 1955, during the rule of the [[United Front (East Pakistan)|United Front]], Chief Secretary N.M. Khan created a film studio and laboratory in Dhaka's [[Tejgaon Thana]]. The first full-length feature film with sound made in East Pakistan was ''[[Mukh O Mukhosh|The Face and the Mask]]'',&lt;ref name="Mukh O Mukhosh" /&gt; which was directed by Abdul Jabbar Khan and released on 3 August 1956. Editing, printing and all other film processing for this movie were done in [[Lahore]], Pakistan. Abdul Jabbar directed and starred in the film, which also starred Inam Ahmed, Purnima Sen, and Nazma.&lt;ref name=cholochitro/&gt;&lt;ref name="dailystar"&gt;{{cite news |last=Waheed |first=Karim |date=12 August 2005 |title=Celebrating 50 years of our cinema |url=http://thedailystar.net/2005/08/12/d50812140197.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star |access-date=27 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The East Pakistan Film Development Corporation Bill, 1957", establishing a national film development corporation, was introduced by [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], the founding father of Bangladesh. The bill was passed in the East Bengal Provincial Assembly, and Nazir Ahmed was appointed as the first creative director.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Initially, the East Pakistan Film Development Corporation allowed only specific directors to make films. [[Fateh Lohani]] directed the rural art film ''Asiya'', the first film produced by the East Pakistan Film Development Corporation, with Nazir Ahmed supervising the production. ''Asiya'' received the President Award for best Bangla film in 1961. Other early films released by the East Pakistan Film Development Corporation include ''[[Akash Ar Mati]]'' (''The Sky and The Earth''), a song film directed by [[Fateh Lohani]] in 1959.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[A. J. Kardar]] directed the Bengali-Urdu film ''[[The Day Shall Dawn]]'' in 1959, with &lt;ref name="imdb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375865/|title=Jago Hua Savera|date=8 May 1959|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zahir Raihan]] working as the assistant director. The film was based on the 1936 Bengali novel ''Padma Nadir Majhi'' (''The Boatman on The River Padma'') by [[Bengali language|Bengali]] novelist [[Manik Bandopadhyay]]. It was an internationally acclaimed movie.&lt;ref name=cholochitro/&gt;  The film was submitted as the Pakistani entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[32nd Academy Awards]], but was not accepted as a nominee.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&lt;/ref&gt; It was also entered into the [[1st Moscow International Film Festival]], where it won a Golden Medal.&lt;ref name="Moscow1959"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1959 |title=1st Moscow International Film Festival (1959) |accessdate=28 October 2012 |work=MIFF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116210640/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1959 |archivedate=16 January 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of the East Pakistan Film Development Corporation led to the growth of the East Bengal film industry and gave rise to three prominent studios: the Popular Studio, Bari Studio, and Bengal Studio. Prominent directors Abdul Jabbar Khan, Fateh Lohani, [[Ehtesham]], and Mohiuddin worked with these studios. Notable films from these directors include ''Matir Pahar'' (''The Clay Hill'') (1959) by Mohiuddin and ''E Desh Tomar Amar'' (1959) by [[Ehtesham]]. The East Pakistan Film Development Corporation's own films sometimes struggled to achieve financial success.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===== 1960s{{anchor|1960s}} =====

During the late 1960s, 20-35 films were produced every year. [[Fateh Lohani]]'s ''Asiya'' and [[Ehtesham]]'s ''Rajdhanir Buke'' (''In the heart of the capital'') were both positively reviewed by critics. In addition to directing, Lohani also acted in a number of East Bengali films throughout the 1960s, including ''Tanha'' (1964), ''Agun Niye Khela'' (1967) and ''Julekha'' (1967).

Following the outbreak of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], Raihan made the documentary ''[[Stop Genocide]]'' to draw attention to the plight of the people of East Bengal. It was one of the first internationally-acclaimed films of Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="The Daily Star"&gt;{{cite news |title=The making of Stop Genocide and disappearance of Zahir Raihan |date=19 December 2008 |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=67680 |work=The Daily Star |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stop_genocide" /&gt; 

In December 1971, the ''East Pakistan Film Development Corporation'' changed its name to the ''Bangladesh Film Development Corporation'', which had the only major film studio and colour lab of the Bangladeshi film industry until the 2010s. Most Bangladeshi films were produced from this studio. Production quantity continued to increase after Bangladesh gained its independence; by the 1990s, over 90 films per year were released. At that time, the film department was under the leadership of Abdul Jabbar Khan.&lt;ref name=cholochitro/&gt; The Bangladeshi film industry was successful both critically and commercially through the first half of the 1990s. 

Many Bangladeshi movies of the 1970s were about the war. The first full-length feature film of independent Bangladesh was ''[[Ora Egaro Jon]]'' released in 1972. The movie was directed by [[Chashi Nazrul Islam]]. Other filmmakers who made critically acclaimed war films in the 1970s include [[Alamgir Kabir (film maker)|Alamgir Kabir]], [[Chashi Nazrul Islam]], and [[Subhash Dutta]].&lt;ref name=bpedia&gt;{{cite book |last=Hossain |first=Ayub |year=2012 |chapter=Kabir, Alamgir |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Kabir,_Alamgir |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of Kabir's feature films are featured in the "Top 10 Bangladeshi Films" critics' choice list by the [[British Film Institute]].&lt;ref name="Top 10 Bangladeshi Films"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/imagineasia/guide/poll/bangladesh/index.html |title=Top 10 Bangladeshi Films |date=17 July 2007 |website=British Film Institute |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527125002/http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/imagineasia/guide/poll/bangladesh/index.html |archive-date=27 May 2009 |access-date=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BFI"&gt;{{cite web |author=Jinsie |title=BFI South Asian Film (2002) |url=https://mubi.com/lists/bfi-south-asian-film-2002#read-more |date= |accessdate= |publisher=mubi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His films include ''[[Dhire Bohe Meghna]]'' (1973), ''Shurjo Konya'' (1976), ''Shimana Periye'' (1977), ''Rupali Shoykte'' (1979), ''Mohona'' (1982), ''Porinita'' (1984) and ''Mohanayok'' (1985).

In 1975, the government started a national film award, as well as a donation fund for creative films.

==== 1980s ====
The 1970s and 1980s were a golden era for Bangladeshi film industry commercially and critically. At this time, a lot of actors and actresses enjoyed popularity, including [[Abdur Razzak (actor)|Abdur Razzak]] who was the most successful actor commercially during this period, as well as [[Kabori Sarwar]], [[Shabana (actress)|Shabana]], [[Bobita|Farida Akhter Bobita]], [[Farooque]], [[Shabnam]], [[Shuchanda|Kohinoor Akhter Shuchanda]], [[Alamgir (actor)|Alamgir]], [[Sohel Rana (actor)|Sohel Raana]], [[Amol Bose]], [[Bulbul Ahmed]], [[Zafar Iqbal (actor)|Zafar Iqbal]], [[Wasim (actor)|Wasim]], [[Ilias Kanchan]], [[Jashim]], [[Rozina (actress)|Rozina]], [[Parveen Sultana Diti]], [[Champa (actress)|Champa]] and others.

In the 1980s most of the Bangladeshi commercial films were influenced in film-making, style and presentation by Indian movies, mostly Hindi movies from Maharashtra. But many of the films were original or adaptation from literary works. Some notable original and adapted films include, ''[[Chhutir Ghonta]]'' (1980) by [[Azizur Rahman (film director)|Azizur Rahman]]; ''Emiler Goenda Bahini'' (1980) by Badal Rahman; ''Shokhi Tumi Kar'' (1980), ''Akhoni Shomoy'' (1980) by [[Abdullah Al Mamun]]; ''Lal Shobujer Pala'' (1980), ''Obichar'' (1985) by [[Syed Hasan Imam (actor)|Syed Hasan Imam]]; ''Koshai'' (1980), ''Jonmo Theke Jolchi'' (1981), ''[[Bhat De]]'' (1984) by Amjad Hossain; ''[[Devdas (1982 film)|Devdas]]'' (1982), ''Chandranath'' (1984), ''Shuvoda'' (1987) by [[Chashi Nazrul Islam]]; ''Smriti Tumi Bedona'' (1980) by Dilip Shom; ''Mohona'' (1982), ''Porinita'' (1986) by [[Alamgir Kabir (film maker)|Alamgir Kabir]]; ''[[Boro Bhalo Lok Chhilo]]'' (1982) by Mohammad Mohiuddin; ''Puroshkar'' (1983) by C.B Zaman; ''Maan Shomman'' (1983) by A.J Mintu; ''Nazma'' (1983), ''Shokal-Shondha'' (1984), ''Fulshojja'' (1986) by [[Subhash Dutta]]; ''Rajbari'' (1984) by [[Kazi Hayat]]; ''Grihilokkhi'' (1984) by Kamal Ahmed; ''Dahan'' (1986) by [[Sheikh Niamat Ali]]; ''Shot Bhai'' (1985) by [[Abdur Razzak (actor)|Abdur Razzak]]; ''Ramer Shumoti'' (1985) by Shahidul Amin; ''Rajlokkhi-Srikanto'' (1986) by [[Bulbul Ahmed]]; ''Harano Shur'' (1987) by [[Narayan Ghosh Mita]]; ''Dayi Ke'' (1987) by Aftab Khan Tulu; ''Tolpar'' (1988) by Kabir Anowar and ''Biraj Bou'' (1988) by Mohiuddin Faruk.

The [[parallel cinema]] movement was officially started from this decade, though there were many off-track movies were made of different genres from the 60s. But the 80s movies were strictly commercial influenced by Indian Hindi commercial films, so there was a necessity of a [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and naturalism cinema movement. The movement was started by [[Alamgir Kabir (film maker)|Alamgir Kabir]]. From this movement some intellectual filmmakers came such as, [[Tanvir Mokammel]], [[Tareque Masud]] and [[Morshedul Islam]].

==== 1990s ====
In the 1990s most of the Bangladeshi movies were dominate by mainstream commercial movies. There were many successful films produced in this time.&lt;ref name=cholochitro/&gt;
In 1990s, definition of Bangla mainstream commercial movies had changed, because most of the movies were very much influenced by commercial Indian Hindi movies and most of them were direct copies from those cheap Indian commercial Hindi films full with action, dance, song and jokes.&lt;ref name=cholochitro/&gt; In the 1990s some new directors and actors came to the industry. Intellectual Directors such as [[Tanvir Mokammel]], [[Tareque Masud]], [[Morshedul Islam]], [[Humayun Ahmed]], [[Nasiruddin Yousuff]], [[Akhtaruzzaman]] and Mustafizur Rahman made some critically and internationally acclaimed films at that time. Two of [[Tanvir Mokammel]]'s feature films are featured in the "Top 10 Bangladeshi Films" list by [[British Film Institute]]'s critics choice.&lt;ref name="Top 10 Bangladeshi Films"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BFI"/&gt;

==== 2000s ====

During the 2000s, most Bangladeshi films began doing poor business and Bangladesh produced about 100 low-budget movies a year. Viewership of Bangladeshi films in general dropped, and the industry was criticized for producing low-quality films whose only appeal was that of cheap melodrama.&lt;ref name="thingsasian.com"&gt;{{cite news |last=Row |first=Helen |title=Bangladeshis reject "smutty" Bengali films |url=http://www.thingsasian.com/goto_article/article.2790.html |work=Things Asian |agency=Agence France-Presse |access-date=2006-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a drastic decline in the 2000s, the Bangladeshi film industry tried to bounce back after 2006-07. With the help of the Bangladeshi Government and the emergence of big production companies, the Bangladeshi film industry started growing slowly.

Among the successful films that released in the 2000s are [[Monpura]], [[Priya Amar Priya]], [[Koti Takar Kabin]], Chacchu, Khairun Sundori, [[Amar Praner Swami]], [[Pitar Ason]], [[Tumi Swapno Tumi Shadhona]], [[Mone Prane Acho Tumi]], [[Amar Shopno Tumi]], [[Bolbo Kotha Bashor Ghore]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kalerkantho.com/print-edition/ronger-mela/2015/08/06/252833|title=সিনেমার আয়-ব্যয় ও ফাঁকা বুলি - কালের কণ্ঠ|first=Kaler|last=Kantho|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the successful films during this period starred [[Shakib Khan]] followed by [[Manna (actor)|Manna]]. Moderately successful actors during this period included [[Ferdous Ahmed]] and [[Riaz (actor)|Riaz]].

==== 2010s ====

Since 2012, Bangladesh has developed several big production and distribution companies, such as [[Monsoon Films]], [[Jaaz Multimedia]] and [[Tiger Media Limited]] and the films produced by them have been doing better business than others for their large budget and glamorous appearance. Four of the top ten highest grossing Bangladeshi films were released in the 2010s. In 2014 India's Reliance Entertainment Limited had expressed their interest in producing Bangladeshi films. However, the Bangladesh Film Corporation didn't respond due to the ban on Indian films in Bangladesh. Another notable film was released in the year 2010 named " Jagoo " directed by one of the prominent and young director named Khijir Hayat Khan. And "Jaago" is the first sports-based film in Bangla Cinema. Top actors during this period included [[Shakib Khan]], as well as [[Ananta Jalil]], [[Arifin Shuvo]], [[Bappy Chowdhury]], [[Symon Sadik]], [[Jayed Khan]].

== Government support ==
The government of Bangladesh played a huge role in the re-emergence of Bangladeshi films. The Bangladesh Film Development Corporation was established as an assistance hub for Bangladeshi cinema. The government also spends about $1 million annually for the development of Bangladeshi parallel cinema and art cinema.

The '''concertmaster''' (from the [[German language|German]] '''''Konzertmeister''''') in the U.S. and Canada is the leader of the first violin section in an orchestra (or clarinet in a concert band) and the instrument-playing leader of the orchestra. After the conductor, the concertmaster is the second-most significant leader in an [[orchestra]], [[symphonic band]] or other [[musical ensemble]].  Another common term in the U.S. is "First Chair." In the U.K., Australia and elsewhere in the English-speaking world, the term commonly used is "leader."

== Orchestra ==

In an orchestra, the concertmaster is the leader of the first [[violin]] section. There is another violin section, the second violins, led by the principal second violin. Any violin solo in an orchestral work is played by the concertmaster (except in the case of a [[concerto]], in which case a guest soloist usually plays).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afm655.org/item/the-role-of-the-concertmaster/catid/10 |title=The role of the Concertmaster |publisher=South Florida Musicians}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually required that the concertmaster be the most skilled musician in the section, experienced at learning music quickly, counting rests accurately and leading the rest of the string section by their playing and bow gestures.

The concertmaster sits to the conductor's left, closest to the audience, in what is called the "first chair," "first [music] stand" or outside of the US "first desk." (In one instance, [[Ferdinand David (musician)|Ferdinand David]] had been concertmaster of the [[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra]] since [[Felix Mendelssohn]] became conductor in 1835. In 1847, [[Joseph Joachim]] joined David on the first desk.) The concertmaster makes decisions regarding [[Bow (music)|bowing]] and other technical details of violin playing for the violins, and sometimes all of the string players. They lead the orchestra in [[Musical tuning|tuning]] before concerts and rehearsals, and other technical aspects of orchestra management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Classical Orchestra |url=http://www.camasb.org/yad/yad-orchestra.shtml |publisher=Community Arts Music Association |accessdate=15 December 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206174144/http://www.camasb.org/yad/yad-orchestra.shtml|archive-date=6 Feb 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading the orchestral tuning is not a mere formality; if the concertmaster believes that a section is not adequately tuned, they will signal to the [[oboe]] player to play another "A." Several larger orchestras have one or more assistant concertmasters, who lead the orchestra in the concertmaster's absence.

The concertmaster, along with the conductor and section principals, will normally participate in the [[audition]]s of important musicians (e.g., principal players) in the orchestra.

== Other large ensembles ==

In a standard [[concert band]], the concertmaster is the principal [[clarinet]], [[oboe]], or [[flute]] and leads the ensemble's tuning. The first-chair clarinet concertmaster will, in common practice, play all solos for their instrument. Often the lead [[flautist]] will receive similar responsibilities to the clarinet concertmaster, depending on several factors such as age, skill and time spent in the [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]]. The concertmaster will, in both orchestral and wind band settings, also coordinate with other principals and section leaders, in most cases being their senior in terms of group pecking order.

In [[brass bands]], the role of concertmaster is often filled by the principal solo [[cornet]] or [[trumpet]].

== Duties ==

The duties and tasks of the concertmaster are myriad. Primarily, they act as the conduit between conductor and orchestra and are accountable to both parties.

One of the principal tasks of the concertmaster is to provide bowings for the 1st violins prior to rehearsal. This entails a great knowledge of historical playing styles in addition to complete idiomatic understanding of the mechanics of string playing. Section leaders among the other strings will base their bowings on those of the concertmaster and these section leaders (called principals) may confer during rehearsal in order to ensure unity and cohesion of execution between the string sections. Ensemble cohesion emanates directly from the contact and connection between these vital front desk positions. The concertmaster assumes responsibility for the tone and execution of the entire section of 1st violins, in addition to performing any solo passages that occur in a given piece.

Another primary duty of the concertmaster is to translate instructions from the conductor into specific technical language for the strings. Some conductors prefer to speak more broadly and defer to the concertmaster on such matters out of respect for the musicians who are expert specialists while the conductor is, often (unless he or she is a string player), a generalist.

Full-time professional orchestras work with several conductors through the course of a regular season. Accordingly, while the conductor may change week to week or month to month, the concertmaster lends a sense of stable and constant leadership day to day. While the impetus for the orchestra to play is given by the conductor's gestures, oftentimes for reasons of precision, the orchestra will actually follow the bow of the concertmaster as their cue to play. This is because the conductor's gestures exist in the abstract whereas the concertmaster produces sound along with their fellow musicians. Further, the idiosyncratic technique of some conductors can make it difficult for the orchestra to enter together. Yet another duty of the concertmaster is to maintain a sense of decorum during rehearsals by setting a personal example and by monitoring the room to ensure all members of the orchestra are being cooperative. It is more appropriate for the concertmaster to ask for quiet if there is a bit of chatter than it is for a guest conductor unfamiliar with the orchestra.  
  
In performances given in America and/or featuring American or British orchestras, the concertmaster will usually walk onstage individually after the rest of the orchestra is seated, and bow and receive applause before the conductor appears. In continental European orchestras, this practice is uncommon. There, the concertmaster usually walks onstage with the rest of the orchestra. As the representative of the orchestra, the concertmaster will usually shake hands with the conductor at the beginning or end of a concert as a sign of mutual respect and appreciation.

[[Image:Het dansen der Cueca-p1906-160-2.jpg|thumb|People dancing Cueca in 1906.]]
'''Cueca''' ({{IPA-es|ˈkweka}}) is a family of musical styles and associated dances from [[Chile]], [[Argentina]] and [[Bolivia]]. In Chile, the cueca holds the status of national dance, where it was officially selected on September 18, 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-3510.html|title=La cueca - Memoria Chilena|website=Memoria Chilena: Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
[[Image:Zamacueca-Chile.jpg|thumb|left|La Zamacueca, by [[Manuel Antonio Caro]].]]

While cueca's origins are not clearly defined, it is considered to have mostly European [[Spain|Spanish]] and arguably indigenous influences. The most widespread version of its origins relates it with the [[zamacueca]] which arose in [[Peru]] as a variation of Spanish [[Fandango]] dancing with ''[[Spanish Criollo peoples|criollo]]''.  The dance is then thought to have passed to [[Chile]] and [[Bolivia]], where its name was shortened and where it continued to evolve. Due to the dance's popularity in the region, the Peruvian evolution of the zamacueca was nicknamed "la chilena", "the Chilean", due to similarities between the dances. Later, after the [[Pacific War]], the term [[marinera]], in honor of Peru's naval combatants and because of hostile attitude towards Chile, was used in place of "la chilena." In March 1879 the writer and musician [[Abelardo Gamarra Rondó|Abelardo Gamarra]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Abelardo Gamarra Rondó|El Tunante]] (sábado 8 de marzo de 1879). «Crónica local - No más chilenas». ''El Nacional''. «No más chilenas.—Los músicos y poetas criollos tratan de poner punto final a los bailes conocidos con el nombre de chilenas; quieren que lo nacional, lo formado en el país no lleve nombre extranjero: se han propuesto bautizar, pues, los bailes que tienen el aire y la letra de lo que se lla[ma]ba chilena, con el nombre de ''Marineras''. Tal título tiene su explicación: Primero, la época de su nacimiento será conmemorativa de la toma de Antofagasta por los buques chilenos —cuestión marina. Tendrá la alegría de la marina peruana al marchar al combate —cuestión marina. Su balance gracioso imitará el vaivén de un buque sobre las ajitadas olas —cuestión marina. Su fuga será arrebatadora, llena de brío, endiablada como el combate de las dos escuadras, si llega a realizarse —cuestión marina. Por todas estas razones, los nuevos bailes se llamarán, pues, ''marineras'' en vez de chilenas. El nombre no puede ser más significativo, y los músicos y poetas criollos se hallan ocupados en componer para echar a volar por esas calles, letra y música de los nuevos bailes que se bailan, como las que fueron chilenas y que en paz descansen [...] (ortografía original)».&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[[Abelardo Gamarra Rondó|Gamarra, Abelardo M.]] (1899). «El baile nacional».

''The Twenty Piano 'cuecas' Of Simeon Roncal. (bolivia)'', University of Miami, Ann Arbor, 1981.'' ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Global, '' https://search.proquest.com/docview/303198415.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Marinera]], [[Zamba (artform)|Zamba]] and the Cueca styles are distinct from each other and from their root dance, the zamacueca.

Another theory is that Cueca originated in the early 19th century [[bordello]]s of South America, as a ''pas de deux'' facilitating partner finding.&lt;ref&gt;[[Journeyman Pictures]] reporter [[Mark Corcoran]]'s [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moq88oQC-pM documentary] with [[Mario Rojas]] and Pinochet-era victims' families on [[YouTube]] (please disregard political connotations)&lt;/ref&gt;

The usual interpretation of this courting dance is [[zoomorphic]]: it tries to reenact the courting ritual of a [[rooster]] and a [[Chicken|hen]]. The male displays a quite enthusiastic and at times even aggressive attitude while attempting to court the female, who is elusive, defensive and demure. The dance often finishes with the man kneeling on one knee, with the woman placing her foot triumphantly on his raised knee.

In Bolivia, there are  many variations throughout the different regions. Cueca styles of La Paz, Potosí and Sucre are the elegant and static versions, whereas in Cochabamba and Tarija the style is much livelier and free. The same could be said with the music where in different regions rhythm and speed slightly differ amongst the regions. While dancing, handkerchiefs are used by both male and female dancers by twirling over the head. It is said the twirling of the handkerchief is a way to lure the woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boliviabella.com/bolivian-music-types.html|title=Traditional Bolivian Music Types: Western Bolivia.

=== History in Chile ===
In [[Chile]] the cueca was developed and spread in the bars and taverns,&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugenio Pereira Salas|Pereira Salas, Eugenio]] (1941). [http://www.memoriachilena.cl/archivos2/pdfs/MC0014783.pdf ''Los orígenes del arte musical en Chile''] (PDF). Santiago: Imp. Universitaria. pp. 272-273. Consultado el 10 de mayo de 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; which in the 19th century were popular centers of entertainment and parties.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alcide d'Orbigny|D'Orbigny, Alcide]], II, 1839-1843: 336. Cf. Merino. 1982: 206. D'Orbigny hace referencia a las chinganas que se hallaban en el barrio de ''El Almendral'' en Valparaíso durante 1830: «son casas públicas [...] donde se beben refrescos mientras se ve danzar la cachucha, el zapateo, etc., al son de la guitarra y de la voz; es un lugar de cita para todas las clases sociales, [...], pero donde el europeo se encuentra más frecuentemente fuera de lugar».&lt;/ref&gt; During Fred Warpole’s stay in Chile between 1844 and 1848 he described some of the characteristics of the dance: [[guitar]] or [[harp]] accompaniment, drumming of hands or a [[tambourine]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; to keep the rhythm, high pitched singing and a unique strumming pattern, where the guitarist strums all of the strings, returning each time with a slap on the guitar body.&lt;ref&gt;Walpole, Fred. I. 1850:105-106. Cf. Merino 1982:207.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second half of the 19th century the cueca was spread to diverse [[Latin America]]n countries and the dance was known simply as the "chilena" (Chilean).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In Argentina the dance was first introduced in [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]], which is in the central west of the country close to the border with Chile; there is documented presence of the cueca in this region in approximately 1840. Unlike in the northeast and central west of [[Argentina]] in Buenos Aires the dance was known as the "cueca" instead of the "chilena" and there is documentation of the cueca being present in [[Buenos Aires]] as early as the 1850s. Similarly to the majority of Argentina the cueca was known as the "chilena" in [[Bolivia]] as well.&lt;ref name="folkloretradiciones.com.ar"/&gt; Chilean sailors and adventurers spread the cueca to the coast of [[Mexico]]&lt;ref&gt;"Cueca."

Its choreographic theme, shared with dances derived from it, was a courtship pantomime performed by a man and a woman amid a crowd that accompanied them with rhythmic clapping and supportive shouting. As the dancers advanced and retreated from each other, they rhythmically and provocatively flipped a handkerchief about. The instrumentation varied, but frequently consisted of plucked stringed instruments and a percussive instrument such as the cajon. [...] The ''zamacueca'' became popular in many Latin American countries during the mid-1800s, and numerous regional and national variations developed. In the 1860s and 1870s, the ''zamacueca chilena'', a Chilean version of it, was the most popular form in Peru».&lt;/ref&gt; and was also known as the “chilena”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Miguel Valle Riestra|Valle Riestra, Víctor Miguel]] (≥ 1881). «Testimonio del coronel EP Víctor Miguel Valle Riestra sobre la destrucción de Chorrillos».

During the 20th century the cueca was associated with the common man in Chile and through them the dance was spread to the pre-industrialized urban areas where it was adopted by neighborhoods like La Vega, Estación and Matadero, which at the time were located on the outskirts of the city of [[Santiago]].&lt;ref&gt;Claro Valdés, Samuel, Carmen Peña Fuenzalida y María Isabel Quevedo Cifuentes (1994).

Consultado el 22 de mayo de 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cueca was named the national dance of Chile due to its substantial presence throughout the history of the country and announced as such through a public decree in the Official Journal (Diario Oficial) on November 6, 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Ministerio Secretaría General de Gobierno (06 de noviembre de 1979), [http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=224886&amp;idVersion=1979-11-06 «Decreto 23: Declara a la cueca danza nacional de Chile»], ''Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional de Chile'', consultado el 1 de marzo de 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clothing and dance==
The clothing worn during the cueca dance is the traditional Chilean clothes. They wear blue, white, red or black costumes and dresses.  The men in the dance wear the huaso's hat, shirts, flannel poncho, riding pants and boots, short jacket, riding boots, and spurs. Women wear flowered dresses. Cueca dancing resembles a rooster-chicken relationship. The man approaches the woman and offers his arm, then the women accompanies him and they walk around the room. They then face each other and hold their handkerchief in the air, and begin to dance. They never touch, but still maintain contact through facial expressions and movements. During the dance, the pair must wave the white handkerchief.

== Basic structure==
[[File:LaCuecaGroupSantiagoClip07964.jpg|thumb|left|Youth dance group, Santiago.]]

The basic structure of the cueca is that it is a compound meter in {{music|time|6|8}} or {{music|time|3|4}} and is divided into three sections.

Some differences can be noticed depending on geographical location. There are three distinct variants in addition to the traditional cueca:

* The northern cueca: The main difference with this version is that there is no singing in the accompanying music which is played with only sicus, zamponas, and brass. [[trumpet]]s, [[tuba]]s. Also, both the music and the dance are slower. This dance is done during religious ceremonies and carnival. (www.guitarrachilena.cl.php). 
* The cueca from the central region: This genre is mostly seen in Chile. The guitar, accordion, guitarron, and percussion are the prevailing instruments.
*The [[Chiloé Archipelago|Chiloé]] cueca: This form has the absence of the cuarteta. The seguidilla are repeated and there is a greater emphasis on the way the lyrics are presented by the vocalist.

==The cueca nowadays==

Currently, the cueca is mainly danced in the countryside, and performed throughout Chile each year during the [[Fiestas Patrias (Chile)|national holidays]] in September 18 eve. Cueca tournaments are popular around that time of year.

In Bolivia, there are lots of different Cueca styles according to the region: Cueca Paceña, Cueca Cochabambina, Cueca Chuquisaqueña, Cueca Tarijeña, Cueca Potosina y Cueca Chaqueña. What they have in common is their rhythm, but they differ quite a lot in velocity, costumes and style. The Cueca styles of [[La Paz]], [[Potosí]] and [[Sucre]] are the elegant ones, whereas in [[Cochabamba]] and [[Tarija, Bolivia|Tarija]] the style is much more lively.In Bolivia, it is usually called "Cuequita Boliviana"

In Argentina, there are many ways of dancing Cueca. Cueca is mostly danced in the northern and western Argentine provinces of Mendoza, Chaco, Salta, Jujuy, Catamarca, La Rioja etc. Each Argentine province has its own style and way of dancing Cueca.

==Cueca in Tarija, Bolivia==

Tarija, Bolivia, has a few traditional songs which are accompanied by dances. One of which is the Cueca Tarijena. Although it may have the same name as the dances in the other departments, such as Cueca Pacena which represents La Paz, each department’s dance varies significantly. My hometown’s is known for being the most upbeat, fun, and playful in comparison to the others which are more tranquil. Additionally, we were the first place to incorporate a violin into our song, thus giving it more flare and excitement. The Cueca, since its origin, has been a source of happiness for the dancers because the music is generally lively and the dances require partners to be excited about dancing with each other.

The interesting thing about Cueca is that it is danced with a hanker chief, and this is how one shows affection for others. Everyone begins the dance with the hanker chief in their right hand and twirls it in circles near their shoulder and then proceeds to waive it by the left side of their waist during certain beats. During the entirety of the dance, the man is attempting to “win over” his partner by showing his dancing talents. The dance demonstrates how Bolivian gender roles remain quite male-dominated. Throughout most the dance, the women simply sway their hips side to side, whereas the men turn in circles and do more complicated movements. This dance is designed for women to show off their beauty and men to demonstrate their talent. The women always follow the male lead because when they are facing each other, it is up to him to decide if he’d like to flirt with his partner by putting his hanker chief near her neck and shoulders, if he’d like to hold the hanker chief behind her neck holding it with both hands, or if he doesn’t want to flirt with her, he will simply continue waiving his hanker chief near his shoulder and waist. This is the determining factor to see if they will dance together in the next part of the song, or if they would need to find other partners. Although we’re in 2018 and most places are working towards equality between women and men, this dance represents how my hometown remains traditional by letting the man choose if he likes his partner with the woman having no say about how she feels.

'''Disney Channel''' is a children's television channel owned by [[Disney-ABC Television Group]] broadcast in [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]] and other countries. It was previously known as '''[[Fox Kids]]''', then [[Jetix]]. There are several variations of the channel which broadcast simultaneously in seven languages (using [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] audio technology): [[Romanian language|Romanian]], English, [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Russian language|Russian]]. Advertising is shown in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], and [[Russian language|Russian]].

'''Disney Channel Central Europe''' is broadcast in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia.

'''Disney Channel Eastern''' is broadcast in Romania and Bulgaria and has different programming to Disney Central Europe, other variations of Disney Channel were also broadcast in many other regions including ex-Yugoslav countries and formerly Ukraine.

==History==
* February, 1999 - Fox Kids launches in [[Romania]], [[Moldova]], [[Russia]], [[Turkey]], [[Bulgaria]].
* November 2000 - Fox Kids launches in [[Hungary]].
* February 2001 - Fox Kids launches in [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]].
* January 1, 2005 - Fox Kids is rebranded as Jetix.

On August 11, 2008 Jetix started broadcasting a block of "Disney Stars" in Romania and Bulgaria,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telemaniac.com/jetix-bgro ''Джетикс ще увеличи програмите на Дисни в България и Румъния'' (translation: ''Jetix to air more Disney programming in Romania'') (in Bulgarian); retrieved August 20, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; featuring the series ''[[Kim Possible]]'', ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'', ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long|American Dragon]]'' and ''[[Hannah Montana]]''. ''[[High School Musical]]'' aired on August 22, 2008 and ''[[High School Musical 2]]'' aired on November 1, 2008. It was fully dubbed into Romanian, and an old Bulgarian translation of ''Kim Possible'' (once aired on [[BNT Channel 1]]) was made available on October 20, 2008. ''High School Musical 2'' was also dubbed. Subsequently, ''Phineas and Ferb'' and ''American Dragon'' were also dubbed by Media Link using voice-over dubbing (unlike all pre-2005 Disney cartoon series, which were all dubbed with synchronized voices). This way of dubbing is very common in Bulgarian television, because it costs less and takes less time to produce (as the voices of actors are just placed directly over a quieted original voice track). Usually, only theatrically or home video-released animated films are dubbed with synchronized voices, and in the 1990s only Disney's animated series were dubbed this way for television. Only starting in 2008, Disney allowed Bulgarian broadcasters to dub films themselves, and all of them were using voice-over dubbing.

After [[Disney XD]] successfully launched on February 13, 2009 in the US, it was expected to be rolled out to European territories in 2009. Later, however, Disney announced that the Jetix channel in certain countries ([[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Russia]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Israel]]) will be renamed to [[Disney Channel]], marking that channel's first introduction in these countries. The change took place on September 19, 2009 in the CEE region.&lt;ref name="Disney Channel"&gt;[http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/?p=18685 Jetix to become Disney] - ''Broadband TV News'', by Chris Dziadul, published and retrieved: 2009-05-26&lt;/ref&gt; Disney Channel Romania &amp; Bulgaria are broadcast as a single video feed with two audio channels and there is also a Russian audio channel.

On September 19, 2009, Disney Channel replaced Jetix in [[Disney Channel (Bulgaria)|Bulgaria]], [[Disney Channel (Czech Republic)|Czech Republic]], [[Disney Channel (Hungary)|Hungary]], [[Moldova]], [[Disney Channel (Romania)|Romania]] and [[Slovakia]]. But the Russian feed was still broadcasting under the Jetix name until it was announced that a separate Disney Channel would launch. After the launch of Disney Channel in Romania and Bulgaria, the Jetix feed in Russia began to be independent and got localized, with Russian titlecards and banners with Russian hours&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsnNdhDGXqs&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 10, 2010, Disney Channel replaced Jetix in [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]].

On October 16, 2010, Disney Channel CEE launched a Ukrainian audio for audience in Ukraine, which was deleted on 1 January 2013 for unknown reasons.

== Feeds ==
* [[Disney Channel Romania]], available in [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]], and [[Disney Channel Bulgaria]], available in [[Bulgaria]], are single video feed with different audio tracks.
* [[Disney Channel Czech Republic &amp; Slovakia]], available in [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], and [[Disney Channel Hungary]], available in [[Hungary]]. [[Disney Channel Czech]] and [[Disney Channel Hungary]] are broadcast as a single video feed with two different audio tracks.
* [[Disney Channel (Russia)]], available in [[Russia]].
* [[Disney Channel (Europe, Middle East and Africa)]], available in [[Albania]], [[Croatia]], [[Greece]], [[Serbia]] and [[Slovenia]].

On the Romanian and Bulgarian version of Disney Channel, at the commercial break ident it shows just the Romanian word for "commercials": RECLAME, without the Bulgarian word, like on Jetix, where it showed first "RECLAME", then "РЕКЛАМА".

==Availability==
Disney Channel is broadcast in [[Romania]] by all cable TV and DTH operators. The Romanian version of the channel is also included in the list of channels of various [[Moldova]]n cable operators as well as in the basic package of the digital platform ''[[Digi TV]]'' in [[Serbia]] and [[Croatia]].

Disney Channel Romania is broadcast in 24/7 mode by all cable and satellite TV operators &lt;!--(such as [[NTV Plus]])--&gt;.
&lt;!--This TV channel is also available in [[Slovenia]] from 06:00-19:00 from a cable operator Telemach and from [[IP TV]] provider SiOL. [[T-2]]([[IP TV]] provider) also provides this channel now 24/7.--&gt;

Fox Kids, then Jetix, and now Disney Channel have been available in all cable operators in Bulgaria since around 1999 and were mostly broadcast with either the Russian or English language audio track. In October 2007, a Bulgarian audio track was added to for some of the shows on Jetix. Jetix was previously shown in Bulgaria on [[bTV (Bulgaria)|bTV]], which continued to air a Jetix block even after Fox Kids was sold to Disney. Translation and distribution for the channel's Bulgarian version was handled by [[Media Link]]. It was expected that the channel would reach 100% translation of its shows in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jetixeurope.com/site/press_office/press_releases/bulgaria_localisation.html&lt;br /&gt;''Jetix begins localisation of its Bulgarian Channel'' - 31 October 2007 ''(retrieved on November 14, 2007)''&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was achieved only in early 2009, with many shows being withheld from broadcast after February 2009 until translation of their episodes was completed. In May and June many such programs  were returned to the channel, since translation had advanced a lot. ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' was the only untranslated show, but it was available in Bulgarian on [[BNT 1]] since March 28, 2009. Promos aired in English and not in Bulgarian.

Jetix in Russia was based on this channel, but all things related to Disney were automatically replaced with Jetix promos. Certain shows which then did not air on the regular Jetix CEE (''[[W.I.T.C.H. (TV series)|W.I.T.C.H.]]'', ''[[Iggy Arbuckle]]'') were part of the hour-and-a-half long programming block that replaced the Disney block. When Jetix CEE was changed to Disney Channel, the Russian language transmission ceased. Jetix Russia continued to exist as a separate channel til August 10, 2010.&lt;!--This version of Jetix was also available in other countries: [[Moldova]], [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], [[Belarus]], [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]] etc.--&gt;

== Disney Junior ==
Playhouse Disney was launched the same day as Disney Channel as a block. In 2010, Playhouse Disney was launched as a channel, replacing Jetix Play. In June 2011, Playhouse Disney was replaced by Disney Junior.

=== Programming ===
* ''[[Handy Manny]]''
* ''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]''
* ''[[Jungle Junction]]''
* ''[[Lalaloopsy (TV series)|Lalaloopsy]]''
* ''[[Little Einsteins]]''

'''Eric Douglas Morley''' (26 September 1918 – 9 November 2000) was a British TV host and the founder of the [[Miss World]] pageant and ''[[Come Dancing]]'' TV programme. His widow, [[Julia Morley]], is now head of the pageant and his son [[Steve Douglas (presenter)|Steve Douglas]] is one of its presenters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-women-who-gave-essex-a-miss-1243491.html |title=The Women Who Gave Essex a Miss |last=Wynne-Jones |first=Ros |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=3 August 1997 |accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Morley was born in [[Holborn]], London, England.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary: Eric Morley, p.&amp;nbsp;25, ''[[The Times]]'', 10 November 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that his father "was at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and spoke nine languages" but he died young. Morely was 11 when his mother and stepfather died of [[tuberculosis]].{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} He attended [[Whitstable Grammar School]] in Kent. [[London County Council]] sent him to the [[Royal Navy]] training ship [[HMS Exmouth (1905)|HMS Exmouth]], which was moored at [[Grays]]. Here, he broke bars of chocolate to sell to his peers. He joined the [[Royal Fusiliers]] at 14 and played [[french horn]] in the band. During the war he became a captain in the [[Royal Army Service Corps]], organising entertainment for the troops and fighting in [[Battle of Dunkirk|Dunkirk]].

Morley started his career in the entertainment business in 1945 when he resigned his commission to manage a travelling show in [[Scotland]], and then, in 1946, joined the [[The Rank Group Plc|Mecca]] organisation as a publicity manager.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} In 1949, he was able to introduce ballroom dancing onto [[BBC television]] through the ''[[Come Dancing]]'' programme, encouraging viewers to visit Mecca's dance halls. His family is now beneficial of Dancing with the Stars franchise globally.

In 1952, he was Mecca's general manager of dancing, and was made a director in 1953. With Mecca, Morley helped to populise [[Bingo (UK)|bingo]] which was played at Mecca venues throughout the United Kingdom. He changed the company from a small catering and dancing firm into a leading entertainment and catering company in the UK. It employed 15,000 people and covered dance halls, catering, bingo, gambling, ice-skating rinks, bowling alleys, discos and several restaurants. The company also provided catering and entertainment services for several of the biggest football clubs in London; [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].

In 1978, he left Mecca after a disagreement with the then parent company, Grand Metropolitan, becoming chairman of the [[Belhaven Brewery]] company in [[Scotland]].

==Politics==
Morley was a confirmed supporter of [[Margaret Thatcher]] and also had political ambition. A resident of [[Herne Hill]], he nearly won in the 1979 general election, reducing the 7,500 majority of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]'s [[Sam Silkin]] to a mere 122 in [[Dulwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Dulwich]], south London, having previously stood in the October 1974 election, where the Conservative vote fell by 2.1%.{{What?|date=June 2018}}{{Fact|date=June 2018}}

==Miss World==
Morley had adapted the seaside beauty contest into fashion shows at Mecca dance halls; he developed this into a national beauty pageant and a TV concept. 'Miss Festival of Britain' began in 1951 as a promotional tool for Mecca and once international contestants arrived in London for the event, the press dubbed it 'Miss World', initially holding the competitions in Mecca halls. The first competition coincided with the [[Festival of Britain]]. When an American rival [[Miss Universe]] contest was launched, Morley turned Miss World into an annual event held every November, initially at the Mecca owned Lyceum Theatre and later in the [[Royal Albert Hall]]. It was first televised in 1959, and became a popular fixture with Morley's announcement of: "I shall announce the result of Miss World, in reverse order".

The pageant was watched by 27.5 million in Britain at its peak in the 1970s and 1980s.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} In 1970, flour bombs were thrown at the compere, [[Bob Hope]], by protestors. Morley answered his critics saying, "If it is shameful to women, then the best thing they can do is turn it off".{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} The competition raised more than £30 million for charity. In 1983 he [[Public float|floated]] Miss World Group on the [[Unlisted Securities Market]] of the [[London Stock Exchange]], keeping a 51 per cent stake. To counter [[feminism|feminist]] critics of the show, he tried to reduce the emphasis on the bathing-costume round and emphasise the girls' other attributes by drawing attention to their "poise, personality, talent, figure, facial beauty, deportment, ability to be interviewed and so forth".{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} Although the terrestrial TV channels no longer broadcast the show in Britain, it remains popular worldwide, and in 1997 was capable of attracting a TV audience of 2.5 billion across 155 countries.

The competition—and its related events such as [[Miss United Kingdom]], [[Miss England]] and [[Miss Scotland]]—could generate great earnings and Morley controversially acted as agent to the winners, keeping them under tight supervision. On one occasion (Miss World 1973) he dethroned the winner who he thought had acted improperly. At the [[Miss World 1979]], Venezuelan contestant [[Tatiana Capote]], popped out of her swimsuit during a preview of the final judging. Morley hastily adjusted her swimsuit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3C1PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kgIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1451,640799&amp;dq=tatiana+capote+miss+world&amp;hl=en Neckline takes plunge]&lt;/ref&gt;

Morley had married his wife [[Julia Morley|Julia]] in 1960 after meeting at a dance hall. In 1968, she took over the day-to-day running of Miss World and, following Morley's death in 2000, became chairman of the pageant.

At the age of 63, Morley completed the London Marathon despite a damaged hamstring, and supported both the [[Variety Club]] of Great Britain and Variety Clubs International, the latter as president in 1978.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}
==Legacy==
On 9 November 2000, the day after the contestants first paraded at the [[Millennium Dome]] in preparation for the 2000 Miss World finals, he had a heart attack and died in the [[The Princess Grace Hospital|Princess Grace Hospital]], west London. A service of thanksgiving was held in the [[Guards Chapel]], [[Wellington Barracks]], with the [[Prince of Wales]] and the [[Duke of Edinburgh]] being represented.&lt;ref&gt;Mr Eric Morley; Memorial Service. ''The Times'', 4 December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; He left an estate valued at £10.6 million, and was buried in [[West Norwood Cemetery]], London.

[[File:Dictorum Factorumque Memorabilium Libri IX.jpg|thumb|1830 version of ''Facta et dicta memorabilia'']]
'''''Factorum ac dictorum memorabilium libri IX''''' ("nine books of memorable deeds and sayings", also known as ''De factis dictisque memorabilibus'' or ''Facta et dicta memorabilia'') by [[Valerius Maximus]] (c. 20 BCE&amp;nbsp;– c. CE 50) was written around CE 30 or 31.&lt;ref name="pagexiii"&gt;Walker, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="columbia"&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/va/Valerius.html ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition (2001-07), s.v. "Valerius Maximus"]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a collection of approximately a thousand short stories that Valerius wrote during the reign of [[Tiberius]] (42 BCE&amp;nbsp;– CE 37).&lt;ref name="pagexiii"/&gt; The stories are a variety of anecdotes illustrating how the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] lived.&lt;ref name="columbia"/&gt; While the majority of the stories are of Roman life, he does have some foreign stories at the end of some chapters. Most of these are of [[Ancient Greece|Greek life]] and most of those are about [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] or famous kings.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. xix&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the stories relate to moral subjects that parallel those in the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]]. Valerius refers to his moral stories as "examples" that were to be used as moral guidance.&lt;ref name="pagexxii"/&gt; Valerius' work on the preservation of moral values of the [[Roman Republic]] of the past was widely popular through the [[Age of Enlightenment]], a literary life-span of some 1,700 years. People read Valerius' work for practical guidance in their everyday tasks for living a moral life.&lt;ref name="pagexxii"&gt;Walker, p. xxii&lt;/ref&gt; This work was especially used as a reference by writers and professional [[Public speaking|orators]].&lt;ref name="pagexiii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="columbia"/&gt;

It is estimated that Valerius's work on these nine books took over a decade.&lt;ref name="rarely"/&gt; He obtained material from [[Cicero]], and from [[Livy]], [[Sallust]], [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus|Pompeius Trogus]], [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] and other ancient historians.&lt;ref name="rarely"/&gt; Each of the nine books has several chapters. Each chapter is outlined and grouped [[theme (literature)|thematically]] and contains several stories illustrating that theme.&lt;ref name="rarely"/&gt;&lt;ref name="table"&gt;Walker, p. vii '''Table of Contents'''&lt;/ref&gt; This work is the earliest known use of a [[hierarchical organization]] system for topics of a book.&lt;ref&gt;Princeton University Press article ''[http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s8216.html A short history of information retrieval]''&lt;/ref&gt; There are a total of 91 chapters covering a wide variety of subjects drawn from Roman life.&lt;ref name="table"/&gt; Valerius arranges his chapters focused on particular [[virtue]]s, moral and immoral habits, religious practices, superstitions and ancient traditions.&lt;ref name="table"/&gt; There is a thematic guide at the end of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects==

===Omens===
One example of Valerius' balanced subject themes covered is where he writes stories about [[omen]]s.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that the observations of omens had a connection to [[religion in ancient Rome]] since many people of that time believed that omens were from divine providence.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Valerius records that omens had played an important role when Rome had been demolished by the [[Gauls]] in 390 BCE. The [[Roman Senate|Senate]] was debating whether they should then move Rome to [[Veii]] or rebuild the city walls.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  While they were deciding some [[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]]s had just returned from guard duty.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Their [[centurion]] then just happened to shout in the assembly place, "Standard-bearer, set up the standard; this is the best place for us to stay." The city was rebuilt in the same place then, since they interpreted these words as an omen.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auspices===
One of the subject themes that Valerius wrote about was the [[superstition]] of [[auspices]] in Book 1 Chapter 4.&lt;ref name="super1"&gt;Walker, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Auspices means "bird observations." It is from the [[Latin]] words of ''avis'' (bird) and ''spicere'' (to sight or watch).&lt;ref name="super1"&gt;Walker, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Before doing anything of great importance, the Romans would "take the auspices" in order to determine what the [[Roman mythology|gods]] approved.&lt;ref name="super1"&gt;Walker, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; This was an examination of the behavior of birds in flight or eating.&lt;ref name="super1"&gt;Walker, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; It was interpreted by an [[augur]] as to the will of the gods from this behavior.

A Roman story that Valerius writes about is the founding of Rome by [[Romulus and Remus]].&lt;ref name="super1"&gt;Walker, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; He records that the founding of the city was based on the auspices. Remus was the first to "take the auspices" by seeing six [[vulture]]s.&lt;ref name="super1"&gt;Walker, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Romulus later however saw twelve vultures. Romulus claimed he had a stronger claim because he saw a larger quantity, even though Remus was the first to spot vultures.&lt;ref name="super1"&gt;Walker, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Another "foreign" story Valerius writes on this theme for a comparison is on the founding of the city of [[Alexandria]] in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by [[Alexander the Great]] in 331 BCE. The [[architect]] was [[Deinocrates]].&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; He records that when Deinocrates was going to design a great city in Egypt, he had no chalk to use for writing.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he used a large quantity of [[barley]], and drew out the plans on the ground.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; A group of birds then came from a nearby lake and ate the barley.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian augur interpreted this to mean that there would be plenty of food for a large city there.&lt;ref name="super2"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modesty===
[[File:Marco Porcio Caton Major.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cato the Elder]]]]
Valerius writes on the theme of [[modesty]] in Book 4 Chapter 5 about the fact that there was no separate seating for the Conscript Fathers (Roman Senators) at the theater.&lt;ref name="modesty1"&gt;Walker, p. 142, Book 4 Chapter 5.1 reads, ''From the foundation of our city to the consulship of Scipio Africanus and Tiberius Longus there was no separate seating for the Senate and the people when they watched the games. In spite of this, no member of the plebs ever brought himself to sit in front of the Conscript Fathers at the theater; the respect shown in our state was so scrupulous.''&lt;/ref&gt; This was from the beginnings of Rome in the 8th century BCE until the time of the consulship of [[Scipio Africanus]] and [[Tiberius Sempronius Longus (consul 194 BCE)|Tiberius Sempronius Longus]] in 194 BCE.&lt;ref name="modesty1"/&gt; In spite of this no member of the [[pleb]]s ever sat in front of the Conscript Fathers.&lt;ref name="modesty1"/&gt; Their respect for this tradition was also shown when one day [[Lucius Quinctius Flamininus]] was to stand in the very back of the theater.&lt;ref name="modesty1"/&gt; He was placed there because he had been removed from the Roman Senate by [[Cato the Censor]] and [[Lucius Valerius Flaccus]]. Flamininus already held the office of [[Roman consul|consul]] and was the brother of [[Titus Flamininus]] (consul 192 BCE), who had defeated [[Philip V of Macedon]] in 197 BCE.&lt;ref name="modesty1"/&gt; In spite of this he still was forced to go to the back of the theater by Cato the Elder. Out of respect however, the entire audience moved Flamininus to the very front so that nobody was in front of him.&lt;ref name="modesty1"/&gt;

Valerius illustrates another story of modesty when he writes of [[Gaius Terentius Varro]].&lt;ref name="modesty1"/&gt; Varro devastated the Roman Republic when he started the [[Battle of Cannae]], one of the worst battles of recorded history. His sense of shame would not allow him to accept dictatorship, even though it was offered to him.&lt;ref name="modesty1"/&gt; The people of the Republic attributed the great loss to the anger of the gods. On the inscription under his death mask shows his good character which brought him more honor that most men receive from the dictatorship position itself.&lt;ref name="modesty1"/&gt;

Valerius records another story of modesty where king [[Hiero II of Syracuse]] hears of the disastrous defeat of the Romans at the [[Battle of Lake Trasimene]].&lt;ref name="modesty2"&gt;Walker, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; He immediately sends as a gift to Rome 70,000 bushels of wheat, 50,000 bushels of barley, and 240 pounds of gold.&lt;ref name="modesty2"/&gt; So that the gold was accepted and not returned he presented it in the form of a statue of victory. This was so the Roman people would accept it on religious grounds.&lt;ref name="modesty2"/&gt;

===Parenting===
[[File:Halle CorneliaMotherOfTheCracchi.jpg|thumb|left|An 18th-century portrayal of [[Cornelia Africana|Cornelia]] proclaiming "These are my jewels," in reference to [[Gracchi|her sons]]]]
Another example of Valerius' themes is where he writes stories about Roman parents and the affection they had toward their children. A story in Book 4 Chapter 4 on ''Poverty'' is about the [[Gracchus|Gracchus brothers]], [[Gaius Gracchus]] and his younger brother [[Tiberius Gracchus]]. The story relates how one day [[Cornelia Africana]], their mother (daughter of Publius Cornelius [[Scipio Africanus]]), was pestered by a lady guest that was showing off her elegant jewellery. Cornelia patiently endured this lady until her sons came home from school. Then, introducing them to this lady, she proclaimed proudly, "These are my jewels."&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example in Book 8 Chapter 8 is about the philosopher [[Socrates]]. He writes of him showing an intimate side which did not distract from his stature because, as Valerius puts it, ''no part of wisdom was hidden from him.'' He tells how Socrates one time made a [[hobby horse|hobbyhorse]] out of [[Reed bed|reed]] for his sons. He would then play with the hobbyhorse with them showing Socrates' personal parental side.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

Valerius writes many stories of other Roman fathers which generally are contrary to the stereotypical image of being brutal and harsh.&lt;ref name=pagexv&gt;Walker, p. xv&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these examples are in Book 5 Chapter 7 titled ''The Love and Indulgence of Parents towards Their Children.''&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that the real fathers are the ones that are benignly permissive and show indulgence.&lt;ref name=pagexv/&gt; He reports with delight that this kind of father could be found in the streets of Rome and that these fathers ''were as gentle as fathers in a comedy.''&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; He does, however, describe in Book 5 Chapter 8 ''Fathers who were severe with their children'' some all-powerful Roman abusive fathers as being tyrannical [[patriarch]]s killing and murdering others including of their own blood. He clearly reports these that are extremely strict and severe as no longer in the role of being a loving father.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

Valerius writes of [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], who killed his sons for failing in their military duties, ''He left the role of a father so that he could play the part of a [[Roman consul|consul]].''&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/5*.html#8.1 Book 5, Chapter 8.1]&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of these role changes can be found in Book 6. In Chapter 1.5 where Valerius tells the story of [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Eburnus]],&lt;ref name="page19915"&gt;Walker, Book 6, Chapter 1.5, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; Eburnus had carried out the highest public offices with great splendor and finished off his career with much dignity; however, he had his son punished for a chastity that was dubious.&lt;ref name="page19915"/&gt; In Chapter 1.6 Valerius writes about Publius Atilius Philiscus who was abused as a child.&lt;ref name="page19916"&gt;Walker, Book 6, Chapter 1.6, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; When he became an adult, Philiscus became a strict father on chastity.&lt;ref name="page19916"/&gt; Learning of his daughter's premarital sex, he murdered her.&lt;ref name="page19916"/&gt;

===The role of women===
{{See also|Women in Ancient Rome}}
[[File:Tizian 094.jpg|thumb|[[Titian]]'s image of the rape of Lucretia]]
Valerius writes of Roman women being generally in seclusion.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} He reports in Book 6 on ''Chastity'' the stereotypical woman as being well-behaved and who would rather face death than dishonor. One story is of [[Lucretia]] in Book 6 Chapter 1.1.&lt;ref name="page198"&gt;Walker, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that she was violently forced to have sex with [[Sextus Tarquinius]], the son of King [[Tarquin the Proud]].&lt;ref name="page198"/&gt; Lucretia could not bear the disgrace and committed [[suicide]].&lt;ref name="page198"/&gt; Another example is about [[Hippo, a Greek woman]]. She committed suicide rather than being raped by drunken sailors.&lt;ref&gt;Valerius Maximus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/6*.html#ext.1 Book 6. ext. 1].&lt;/ref&gt; Valerius even writes in Book 2, Chapter 6.14, of [[suttee]] being an admired practice model for all women to follow in his day.&lt;ref name=pagexv/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/2*.html#6.14 Book 2 Chapter 6.14]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pagexvi"/&gt;

===Homosexuality===
{{See also|Homosexuality in ancient Rome}}
Valerius writes about homosexuality, which was an unusual category for that time period of writers.&lt;ref name="pagexvi"&gt;Walker, p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect of private life was kept under wraps.&lt;ref name="pagexvi"/&gt; The only relationship along these lines that was tolerated by law was that between a master and a slave.&lt;ref name="pagexvi"/&gt; Valerius, however, does report on male homosexuality in the [[Roman army]] and the [[upper class]].&lt;ref name="pagexvi"/&gt; He does not report on female homosexuality nor "[[gay women]]" as some writers did at the time.&lt;ref name="pagexvi"/&gt;

===Roman army===
In the stories of the Roman army, Valerius always records high-ranking military personnel taking advantage of their position. In Book 6 Chapter 1.10 Valerius tells the story of Gaius Cornelius.&lt;ref name="page200110"&gt;Walker, Book 6, Chapter 1.10, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bk6110"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/6*.html#1.10 Book 6, Chapter 1.10]&lt;/ref&gt; He was rewarded four times by his superiors to be the senior [[centurion]] of his [[Roman legion|legion]].&lt;ref name="page200110"/&gt; However Gaius Pescennius, a ''triumvir capitalis'' (prison manager) in CE 149, had Cornelius thrown in jail and shackled in irons for having sexual relations with a young boy of free birth.&lt;ref name="page200110"/&gt; Cornelius did not deny the charges and was prepared to make a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sponsio|sponsio]]'' (legal guarantee).&lt;ref name="bk6110"/&gt; In so doing, Cornelius was making a statement and putting down a sum of money as a guarantee of truth.&lt;ref name="page200110"/&gt; If the guaranteed statement was found to be false, the young boy was to be paid this amount.&lt;ref name="page200110"/&gt; His statement was to say that the boy openly and willingly sold his body for cash.&lt;ref name="page200110"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bk6110"/&gt; The [[tribune]]s refused to allow this, since they thought soldiers of the Roman Republic should not make deals in which they could pay for pleasures at home by facing dangers overseas.&lt;ref name="page200110"/&gt; Cornelius spent the rest of his life in prison.&lt;ref name="page200110"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bk6110"/&gt;

In Book 6 Chapter 1.11 Valerius tells the story of Marcus Laetorius Mergus.&lt;ref name="page200111"&gt;Walker, Book 6, Chapter 1.11, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; Cominius and a tribune of the [[pleb]]s summoned Mergus, a high-ranking military career person, before the people because of sexual relations with young men and women outside his marriage. He was prosecuted and sent to prison.&lt;ref name="page200111"/&gt;

In Book 6 Chapter 1.12 Valerius tells the story of [[Chiomara]].&lt;ref name="page202112"&gt;Walker, Book 6, Chapter 1. ext. 2, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bk6ext2"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/6*.html#ext.2 Book 6, ext. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Chiomara was the wife of Ortiagon. During the [[Galatian War]] with Rome of 189 BC, [[Gnaeus Manlius Vulso]] was victorious in a campaign against the Galatian Gauls.&lt;ref name="page202112"/&gt; One of his centurions was put in charge of a group of captives including Chiomara. The centurion made sexual advances towards her and she rejected him.&lt;ref name="page202112"/&gt; Under violence and force he raped her. The centurion then offered, to assuage his shame, to ransom her back to her relatives.&lt;ref name="page202112"/&gt; When he received his ransom and was counting the gold pieces, Chiomara secretly indicated to her relatives to murder him and cut off his head.&lt;ref name="bk6ext2"/&gt; She later presented the head of the centurion to her husband.&lt;ref name="page202112"/&gt;

===Political views===
[[File:Lucius Appuleius Saturninus.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Coin of [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus]]]]
The political views of ordinary Romans basically were not written on by most ancient writers.&lt;ref name="rarely"&gt;Walker, P. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; Valerius, however, did write about the grassroots customs of Rome as a democratic society.&lt;ref name="rarely"/&gt; He points out that the poorer Romans had goals as to where they wanted to ultimately be and in what direction they wanted to go.&lt;ref name="rarely"/&gt;

One example of how political views were looked upon in his days is where he writes a story on [[Sextus Titus]], who kept a picture in his residence of a murdered [[Extremism|radical]] called [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus]].&lt;ref name="stitus"&gt;Walker, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bk81damn3"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/8*.html#1.damn.3 Book 8, Chapter 8.1.damn.3]&lt;/ref&gt; Titus was popular with the people because of a new land reform law he proposed; however, he was prosecuted and punished just because of the picture and his political views.&lt;ref name="stitus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bk81damn3"/&gt; He writes that the Romans felt a personal loyalty to the memory of these reformers. The tribal assembly of [[plebeian]]s felt that this memory could be led astray if there was an association to a radical.&lt;ref name="rarely"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stitus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bk81damn3"/&gt;

Many times there were [[imposter]]s that said they were sons of populist leaders like [[Tiberius]], [[Gaius Marius]], [[Gracchus]], and [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]]. The people of Rome loved them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/9*.html#7.1 Book 9, Chapter 7.1 and 7.2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/9*.html#15.1 Book 9, Chapter 15. 1 -4]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he records that one claimed to be the grandson of Gaius Marius and drew a crowd as what [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] himself would obtain.&lt;ref name="rarely"/&gt;

Valerius records the attitudes of the [[aristocracy]] and the contempt to which the [[Working class|lower class]] was subjected by the Roman elite. He demonstrates this with a story about [[Scipio Aemilianus Africanus]]. Scipio one day preached to a group of [[pleb]]s that basically they are nothing other than just a level above being slaves. He tells them they don't even deserve to call Italy their home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/6*.html#2.3 Book 6, Chapter 6.2.3]&lt;/ref&gt; Valerius shows a similar concept with [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio]]. The story goes that Nasica treated a poor man with ridicule and contempt because his hands were so rough from manual labor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/7*.html#5.2 Book 7 Chapter 5.2]&lt;/ref&gt; Valerius writes of still another example where the aristocratic Claudia had hoped for more of the Roman common people to have been finished off in the [[First Punic War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/8*.html#1.damn.4 Book 8, Chapter 1.damn.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EumenesII.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Coin of [[Eumenes II]]]]

===Generosity===
Valerius gives examples of generosity in Book 5 Chapter 8.&lt;ref name="gen1"&gt;Walker, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Valerius writes that generosity is given to those that are poor.&lt;ref name="kind1"&gt;Walker, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin word for generosity is ''liberalitas''. The god of wine is Liber. The god Liber and the word ''liberalitas'' come from the word ''liber'', meaning "free." Here he tells the story of how, after the Romans captured Asia from King [[Antiochus III the Great]] in 190 BCE, they gave a large portion of it to their ally King [[Eumenes II]] of [[Pergamum]] free as a permanent gift.&lt;ref name="gen1"&gt;Walker, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of generosity which Valerius writes about occurs after the Romans had defeated [[Philip V of Macedonia]]. In 196 BCE, the Greeks had the [[Isthmian Games]]. Here [[Titus Quinctius Flamininus]] proclaimed the independence of the Greek states from [[Macedon]]ian rule.&lt;ref name="gen1"&gt;Walker, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; At the games, the stadium was full of people and Titus had the herald make the following proclamation: "The Roman people and Senate, and Titus Quinctius Flamininus, their general, having vanquished the Macedonians and Philip, their king, order that Greece shall be free from foreign garrisons, not subject to tribute, and shall live under her own customs and laws."&lt;ref name="gen1"&gt;Walker, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kindness and compassion===
The themes in Chapter 1 of Book 5 are [[kindness]] and [[compassion]]; Valerius gives several examples based on these concepts.&lt;ref name="kind1"&gt;Walker, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; He considered these lesser [[virtue]]s than [[generosity]], although companions of it.&lt;ref name="kind1"&gt;Walker, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Valerius writes that kindness is shown to those that are in trouble and compassion is for those whose luck has turned against them.&lt;ref name="kind1"&gt;Walker, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; He considered generosity to be the one that derived its name from a god, and should receive the most approval of these three.&lt;ref name="kind1"&gt;Walker, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

One Roman story is where Valerius gives an example of generosity, kindness and compassion. Here he explains that one day the [[Roman Senate]] was offered a large sum of ransom money for the release of 2,743 Carthaginian soldiers and refused it. The Senate released the soldiers to the representatives that had come to get them, and forgave the crimes. The representatives were astonished and even admitted that they themselves would not have been so kind and generous.&lt;ref name="kind1"&gt;Walker, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Roman story in which Valerius writes about kindness is where king [[Syphax]] of western Numidia died in prison in Tibur (modern day [[Tivoli, Italy]]) in 201 BCE. The Senate gave him a state funeral with a proper burial.&lt;ref name="kind1"&gt;Walker, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Another similar Roman story in which Valerius writes about compassion is where the Senate sent a [[quaestor]] to Alba (in [[Latium]]) in 167 BCE. There King [[Perseus]] of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] was banished to and had just died there. They wanted to give him honor and provided a state funeral for the king.&lt;ref name="kind1"&gt;Walker, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gratitude===
Valerius gives examples of gratitude in Book 5 Chapter 2 as the theme.&lt;ref name="grat1"&gt;Walker, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; One example is when Valerius writes about how [[Capua]] was being besieged by [[Quintus Fulvius Flaccus]] at the [[first Battle of Capua]]; there were two Campanian women who had kind feelings for Rome. They devoted much of their time and property to its benefit.&lt;ref name="grat1"&gt;Walker, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; One was Vestia Oppia, a married woman with a family, who labored everyday for the Roman army.&lt;ref name="grat1"&gt;Walker, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Another was Cluvia Facula, a prostitute, who supplied food to the Roman [[prisoners of war]].&lt;ref name="grat1"&gt;Walker, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; When Capua was defeated, the Roman Senate gave back their freedom and property and rewarded them. These two momen were even praised at an important Senate meeting in 210 BCE.&lt;ref name="grat1"&gt;Walker, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

Valerius gives another example of gratitude when he writes of [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus]] (c. 280 BC – 203 BC), called '''Cunctator''' (''the Delayer'').&lt;ref name="grat2"&gt;Walker, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Fabius died in 203 BCE after being [[Roman consul|consul]] for five terms. Many people of Rome generously gave money to his funeral in gratitude for his leadership.&lt;ref name="grat2"&gt;Walker, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; When he was still alive, to show gratitude of his outstanding service to the Roman people, a [[referendum]] of the [[pleb]]s gave equal power to his [[magister equitum]] [[Marcus Minucius Rufus (consul 221 BC)|Marcus Minucius Rufus]] as co-dictator in 217 BCE.&lt;ref name="grat2"&gt;Walker, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carthage location 2.png|thumb|left|[[Carthage]] location]]

===Ingratitude===
Valerius gives as the theme "ingratitude" in Book 4 Chapter 3. Valerius writes that [[Scipio Aemilianus]], grandson of famous general [[Scipio Africanus]], had destroyed two major cities, [[Numantia]] and [[Carthage]], that were major threats to Rome. However, in Rome later, he met his death in mysterious circumstances in 129 BCE.&lt;ref name="myster"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/4*.html#1.12 Book 4, Chapter 1.12]&lt;/ref&gt; There was never anyone in the [[Roman Forum]] that avenged his death.&lt;ref name="myster"/&gt;

Valerius writes of another example on ingratitude being the circumstances around [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio]]. Nasica had led a group of conservative senators of the Roman Senate to kill the populist tribune of the plebs [[Tiberius Gracchus]] in 133 BCE.&lt;ref name="merit"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/3*.html#2.17 Book 3, Chapter 2.17]&lt;/ref&gt; He soon afterward had to withdraw from public life because the people of Rome had judged his merits unfairly.&lt;ref name="merit"/&gt; Nasica, a [[Pontifex Maximus]], went to [[Pergamum]] ostensibly as a [[diplomat]] and never returned.&lt;ref name="merit"/&gt; He died there, but never missed his country because the Roman people were so ungrateful for what he considered a great deed he had done for them.&lt;ref name="merit"/&gt;

[[File:Gaius Gracchus Tribune of the People.jpg|thumb|right|The [[rostra]] at the Roman Forum]]

===Infamous crimes===
On another theme, Valerius writes of several examples of infamous crimes in Book 8 Chapter 1 and how they related to [[jealousy]].&lt;ref name="absol2"&gt;Walker, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

One example Valerius records of acquittal ''(absoluti)'' is where Marcus Horatius is found guilty by King [[Tullus Hostilius]] of killing his sister.&lt;ref name="abs811"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/8*.html#1.abs.1 Book 8 Chapter 1.abs.1]&lt;/ref&gt; Horatius was acquitted of the crime when he appealed to the public.&lt;ref name="abs811"/&gt; The brutal nature of the killing influenced King Tullus to convict him; however, the motive for which Horatius did it influenced the people.&lt;ref name="abs811"/&gt; In a battle defending Rome Horatius defeated the Curiatius brothers and killed them. His sister was in love with one of these brothers and planned on marrying him.&lt;ref name="abs811"/&gt; She wept over him, hearing of his death. Horatius murdered her then because of her premature love affair with the enemy.&lt;ref name="abs811"/&gt; The people of Rome felt this was harsh punishment rather than an actual crime of the Roman Republic. Horatius received glory for not only killing the Curiatius brothers, the enemy, but for killing his sister.&lt;ref name="abs811"/&gt; In this case the Roman people were acting as a strict guardian of chastity.&lt;ref name="absol2"&gt;Walker, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

Another case Valerius records is where the Roman people were acting as an unfair, lax judge. In this case [[Servius Sulpicius Galba (consul 144 BC)|Servius Sulpicius Galba]] was being harshly denounced at the [[rostra]] by [[Lucius Scribonius Libo]], tribune of the plebs in 149 BCE.&lt;ref name="absol2"&gt;Walker, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cato the Elder]] supported the tribune's charges in a grand speech at a [[Roman assemblies|Roman assembly]] as is recorded in his ''Origins''.&lt;ref name="absol2"&gt;Walker, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; Galba had committed an atrocious [[war crime]] against the [[Lusitanians]]. He had made a peace agreement with the Lusitanians, but then massacred 8,000 of them while he was governor of [[Hispania|Spain]] in 150 BCE.&lt;ref name="absol2"&gt;Walker, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; Galba, being a great speaker in his own right, had no real defense for his crimes. Through bribery and bringing forth his children and the orphan child of a relative before the public in a speech for mercy, he procured his acquittal.&lt;ref name="absol2"&gt;Walker, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

Another case where Valerius records ancient history crimes is about Gaius Cosconius, [[praetor]] in 89 BCE and governor of [[Illyria]] from 78 to 76 BCE.&lt;ref name="acquit1"&gt;Walker, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; He was accused of misgovernment under the [[Servilian Law]] passed in 101 BCE.&lt;ref name="acquit1"&gt;Walker, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; There was no doubt that he was guilty; however, he recited a poem about his accuser, Valerius Valentinus, and got an acquittal.&lt;ref name="acquit1"&gt;Walker, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; The poem was about how Valerius seduced a young man in a striped [[toga]] and a young freeborn woman. Valerius was then convicted by the acquittal of Cosconius.&lt;ref name="acquit1"&gt;Walker, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outrageous behavior===
Valerius reports in Book 9 Chapter 5 under Foreign Stories that [[Alexander the Great]] had three stages of arrogance.&lt;ref name="alex"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/9*.html#5.ext.1 Book 9 Chapter 5.ext.1]&lt;/ref&gt; One was that he looked down on his father [[Philip II of Macedon]] and claimed that Jupiter Hammon was his real father.&lt;ref name="alex"/&gt; Another was that he took up the ways of the [[Persian people]] by dressing and behaving their way.&lt;ref name="alex"/&gt; Still another was that Alexander believed himself to be a god, not a human being.&lt;ref name="alex"/&gt;

Valerius writes another foreign story here of [[Xerxes I of Persia]].&lt;ref name="xerxes"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/9*.html#5.ext.2 Book 9 Chapter 5.ext.2]&lt;/ref&gt; To show his outrageous behavior and arrogance, he tells how Xerxes summoned all the leaders of Asia together.&lt;ref name="xerxes"/&gt; Just as he was about to declare war on Greece, he tells them, ''I did not want people to think that I was acting on my own initiative, so I brought you together here. But remember that it is your duty to obey me rather than persuade me.''&lt;ref name="xerxes"/&gt; Valerius reports that in the invasion, Xerxes suffered such a defeat that one would wonder if his words were just arrogance or stupidity.&lt;ref name="xerxes"/&gt;

Valerius writes on still another foreign story of [[Hannibal]] and how arrogant he was after his success at the [[Battle of Cannae]].&lt;ref name="hannibal"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/9*.html#5.ext.3 Book 9 Chapter 5.ext.3]&lt;/ref&gt; He tells how Hannibal had [[delusions of grandeur]] and would not then receive any of his fellow citizens directly. He would only communicate through a go-between.&lt;ref name="hannibal"/&gt; He even insulted his cavalry commander Maharbal, who had said in front of his tent in a loud voice that he had planned things so that Hannibal would be dining on the Capitol in Rome within a few days.&lt;ref name="hannibal"/&gt;

==Other topics==
Some other subjects that Valerius wrote about included:
*Bravery
*Cruelty
*Dreams
*Fidelity
*Friendship
*Innate characteristics
*Moderation
*Modesty
*Omens
*Parental Love
*Physical resemblance
*Prestige
*Revenge

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2592">'''''Gnuff''''' is a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[comic book]] series about an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dragon who lives in a city with his wife Gnellie and his son Gnicky. They keep their wings hidden (they are compact enough to be concealed under their clothing) and generally try to live quietly, being considered 'outsiders' in a [[Carl Barks]]-like world of contemporary [[funny animal]]s. 

Gnuff first appeared in the Scandinavian [[fanzine]] ''Sejd'' (#12, 1974). Over the years, creator [[Freddy Milton]] has written and drawn many feature-length stories, resulting in a series of full-color albums, a regular Sunday-page newspaper comic strip, appearances in ''[[Critters (comics)|Critters]]'' and alongside [[Usagi Yojimbo]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usagiyojimbo.com/other/comics/uy-cs1.html USAGI YOJIMBO Color Special #1 - From The Editors Desk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061217015740/http://usagiyojimbo.com/other/comics/uy-cs1.html |date=2006-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gnuff stories often revolve around social and environmental concerns. In an interview in ''[[Amazing Heroes]]'' #129, Milton said, "My dragons openly depict the problems of minorities. they have to conceal their old culture (their wings) to make it in our society. Also, they are a species on the decline. These are the reasons why they appeal to me." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Paris/Metro/7211/fmart.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+09:24:43 Interview from Amazing Heroes 129, 1987.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GrailQuest''' is a series of [[gamebook]]s by [[J. H. Brennan]]. The books are illustrated by [[John Higgins (comics)|John Higgins]]. The stories follow the adventures of a young hero named Pip, who is often called upon by [[Merlin]] to right wrongs and save the realm from evil. The series is light in tone and does not take itself seriously, often spoofing the fantasy genre and inserting slapstick humor or nonsensical elements.

The series is mostly set in [[King Arthur]]'s realm of [[Avalon]], although the fourth volume, ''Voyage of Terror'', takes place almost entirely in [[ancient Greece]], after Merlin's summoning spell goes wrong.

While there were eight total books published in the series, books seven and eight were never published in the United States.

== Characters ==

*'''Pip''': The hero of the series. Pip was brought up on a farm as the adopted child of Freeman John and his wife Miriam. One day, soldiers from King Arthur's court arrived to escort Pip to Merlin's log castle, where Merlin assigned the young adventurer the mission of rescuing Queen [[Guinevere]] from the evil Wizard [[Ansalom]]. Pip fights (and sometimes argues) with a magical sword, Excalibur Junior, and often wears a sturdy dragonhide jacket when adventuring.  Pip is never assigned a gender pronoun by anyone in the books and as such could be a female hero, though the assumption is usually taken that Pip is a young boy. Pip does declare himself '''lord''' of the jungle at one point, and EJ, referring to Pip, says "unhand him, varlet!".
*'''Merlin''': The (supposedly) wise old wizard. He introduces each adventure and is usually the one who gives Pip his mission, providing Pip with items and some magic. Merlin tends to be sarcastic and grumpy, not to mention eccentric. However, even though he treats Pip like a foolish child, he still cares about the young adventurer. In one of the series' running jokes, Merlin acquires a new, bizarre home in every volume.
*'''Cody''': Merlin's young apprentice, introduced in ''Legion of the Dead'', who brings Pip to Avalon via the Net Spell after Merlin disappears and is presumed dead following a fall from a tree.
*'''Excalibur Junior (E.J.)''': Pip's magical talking sword. It was created by Merlin, who based its design on [[Excalibur|King Arthur's sword]] (hence the "Junior"). E.J. is quite powerful but has the annoying tendency of speaking its mind at inconvenient times, and can even refuse to be pulled from its scabbard (showing an ability similar to its namesake) when in a bad mood. E.J. also suffers from [[arachnophobia]], which is a disadvantage when Pip runs into giant spiders.
*'''The Poetic Fiend''': A [[vampire]] [[poet]] who is a recurring character through the series. The Fiend believes that he is a great poet, when in actuality his verse tends more towards [[doggerel]] (and has been known to make even cockroaches throw up when he gives a recital). He is often helpful to Pip, as long as Pip is diplomatic in his criticism of the Fiend's poetry. In the English-language books, the Fiend is unnamed. In the French translations, however, he is known as Nosferax.
*'''King Arthur''': Ruler of the realm of Avalon. He is rarely encountered by the player in person, but is a prominent and influential figure in the series. He is usually the one who gives missions to Pip by the way of Merlin.
*'''King Pellinore''': [[King Pellinore of Listinoise]] appears in the first few books as a running gag, where he is often confused for the Black Knight because of his dark armor. Often it is Pellinore who is assigned the task of taking care of whatever problem is plaguing Camelot, with Pip only coming in later after the poor old king gets himself hopelessly lost.
*'''The Wizard Ansalom''': An evil black-magic-using wizard, who is the main villain in the very first adventure. He returns as a ghost when Pip visits the Ghastly Kingdom of the Dead and Pip discovers that some of his dark influence remains in the last volume.
*'''The Black Knight''': The [[Black Knight (Arthurian legend)|Black Knight]] of old legend is the main villain in one of Pip's adventures. He seems to appear in several volumes, but those other appearances are actually King Pellinore (see above).

== Combat ==

The rules of GrailQuest are quite simple when compared to current [[role-playing game|RPG]]s. The player must roll two six-sided dice and add the results. If the result exceeds 6 (which will happen 58.3% of the time), then the enemy is injured and loses a number of [[hit point|Life Points]] - how much depends on what the dice shows, as every point over 6 will count as a point of damage. When a character's Life Points reach zero, the character is dead, and when they are at 5, they are knocked out.

If wielding a weapon, the number needed to hit may be lower, and extra damage will usually be inflicted. For instance, Excalibur Junior hits on a roll of 4 (hitting 91.7% of the time) and provides a bonus 5 points of damage.

There is no defence roll, but damage is reduced by a set amount by any armor the character is wearing.

[[Initiative (role-playing games)|Initiative]] is determined by an initial, opposed roll where the highest roll gets the first attack. From then on, the character and the enemy take turns to attack. Surprise is sometimes involved (for example, in ''Gateway of Doom'', a giant spider gets first strike automatically due to Pip being in its home territory).

If the character dies, the player must go to section 14, which describes his afterdeath and tells him to calculate his Life Points again. Merlin then resurrects Pip, who has to start from the beginning of the adventure again - although some books will only require him to start from a certain point, such as ''Gateway of Doom'' allows Pip to restart at the beginning of the Ghastly Kingdom of the Dead, or ''Realm of Chaos'' allows him to start from the beginning of a certain location. However, all previously killed enemies remain dead, and any treasure the player found is gone for good. (In some books, killed enemies return to life with half the Life Points they had the first time around.)

== Magic spells ==

In some of the books, Merlin provides Pip with magic spells. In the first book, Pip has only two spells - ten firefingers (lightning bolts) and two powerful fireballs. The firefinger lightning bolts hit automatically for a straight 10 points of damage, while the fireballs score a massive 75 points of damage each, but require a 6 or better on two dice or else they miss completely.

=== Pip's First Spell Book ===

In the second book, Merlin provides Pip with a [[grimoire|spell book]]. This provides Pip with more spells of various uses in and out of combat. Pip also receives ten new firefingers (different from the firefingers on the previous book) and two new fireballs. If the player has finished the first book, he can keep any unspent spells from the previous book, and also the dragonhide jacket, which would otherwise be unavailable.

Pip's use of magic is limited by three rules that must be adhered to at all times. First, every spell thrown costs three Life Points whether it is cast successfully or not. Second, no spell can be thrown more than three times in any given adventure (and once thrown, it is used whether or not it is successfully cast). And third, no spell thrown is successfully cast unless a 7 or better is rolled on two dice.

*Pip's Armour of Nearly Impenetrable Coruscation (P.A.N.I.C. for short) - Throws a shimmering wall of light around the caster for the duration of a single combat, which deducts four points of damage scored against Pip in addition to any other protection or armour worn.
*Pip's Outlandish Wallop (P.O.W. for short) - Adds +10 damage to the next attack Pip makes on top of any other attack bonuses.
*Pip's Instant Levity and Laughter (P.I.L.L. for short) - Causes a single enemy to laugh so hard that he or she misses the next three consecutive turns in combat.
*Pip's Attacking Dart (P.A.D. for short) - Allows Pip to launch a ranged attack for a straight 10 damage against an opponent who is otherwise out of combat range. An enemy hit with the dart can only counter-attack if he or she has ranged weaponry or spells of his or her own.
*Pip's Immunity to Poison (P.I.P. for short) - If cast before poison is taken, it completely counteracts the effects of the poison. The spell does not function if cast after Pip has already been poisoned, however.
*Pip's Instant Neutralizer (P.I.N. for short) - Counteracts one spell or enchantment placed on an object (not a living being). It is useful for opening a chest or door which has been magically locked, for example.
*Pip's Immense Rapid Repeater (Pi R squared for short) - Doubles Pip's speed during a single combat, allowing Pip to get in two attacks for every one made by an opponent.
*Invisibility (I.N.V.I.S.I.B.I.L.I.T.Y. for short) - This spell is an exception to the normal rules of magic in that it can only be cast once per adventure for a cost of 15 Life Points, and only in designated areas, but the effect renders Pip completely invisible.
*Firefinger - This spell is an exception to the normal rules of magic in that it can only be successfully cast once per adventure. It gives Pip 10 Firefinger lightning bolts (five in each hand) which can be fired immediately or stored for later use.
*Fireball - Like the Firefinger spell, it can only be successfully cast once per adventure. It gives Pip 2 fireballs which can be thrown immediately or stored for later use.

=== Pip's Second Spell Book ===

In the third book, Merlin provides Pip with a new spell book. When Pip wonders why this second spell book is shorter than the first one, Merlin tells Pip that spell books require a great deal of research and development, making them quite expensive, and he is not made of money. These spells follow the same three rules of magic described in the second book.

*Pip's Patent Lock Picker (P.L.O.P. for short) - Will pick one non-magic lock per section on a throw of 6 or better on two dice.
*Pip's Incredible Duncher (P.I.D. for short) - Creates a magical cap which, when worn, shrinks Pip to the size of six inches, thus allowing travel through small passageways. Pip returns to normal size in the next section.
*Pip's Amazing Legume Spell (P.A.L.S. for short) - If Pip should come under attack by any sort of vegetable, this spell guarantees an automatic Friendly Reaction from said vegetable.
*Pip's Instant Levitation (P.I.L. for short) - Allows Pip to levitate straight up or down, but if used indoors it causes a concussion when you hit the ceiling and the loss of half your current Life Points.
*Pip's Obliging Power Sword (P.O.P.S. for short) - If cast before a hit roll in combat, it causes E.J. to score double damage on the next strike, but only half damage on the hit after that.

Spell books, Firefingers, Fireballs, the dragonhide jacket and even E.J. are not available in the fourth book. Both spell books are also unavailable in books five and six; in the former case because Merlin has run out of time, and in the latter because no magic will work on account of the curse on Camelot.

== Running Jokes ==

*In every book, once you are killed you have to turn to the infamous section 14. This rule is true for all of J.H. Brennan's gamebooks, except the ''[[Sagas of the Demonspawn|Demonspawn]]'' series where the killed player must go to the section 13.
*Merlin's eccentricities are showcased in each book with Merlin acquiring a new dwelling, more bizarre and off-the-wall than the last. In ''Castle of Darkness'', Merlin lives in a log castle. He's moved to a crystal cave in ''Den of Dragons''.  By ''Gateway of Doom'', he has moved into the lightning-blasted remains of an ancient druid oak. ''Voyage of Terror'' shows Merlin trying out a magical bubble spell which places a home of sorts at the bottom of the well in the town square of Glastonbury Village. In ''Kingdom of Horror'' he has created a home in the shape of a large six-sided die up in the Welsh Mountains. ''Realm of Chaos'' actually showcases two of Merlin's homes: the first being the enormous barrel-shaped house he is living in at the beginning, and the second one being a sort of abandoned fortress in the Astral Plane. ''Tomb of Nightmares'' has Merlin living inside a hollowed-out roc egg, presented to King Arthur by a drunken Arab sailor and given to the wizard when the King had no other idea of what to do with it. Only the final book in the series omits specific details about Merlin's home, though wherever it stands, there is a one-way door out of it which leads into Hell.
*In ''Realm of Chaos'', Pip finds a book "about some idiot called Fire*Wolf", who is the hero of ''Demonspawn'', another series by J.H. Brennan.
*Upon meeting Pip, most people recognize him as "...the one that put paid to old Ansalom, eh?"  [[Ansalom]], as previously noted, was the villain in the first book. In addition, the further along in the series one gets, the more titles get appended to Pip's name. By the end of the series, Pip is known as the Wizard Basher, Dragon Slayer, Gateway Closer, Realm Saver, and Chaos Tamer and is often addressed by all of those titles at once by Merlin or E.J. and often at times when brevity would be far better for the circumstances.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:CrystalUltimateGif.gif|thumb|Crystals ultimate ability in IHRB]]
[[File:JungleA.png|thumb|Jungle Environment in IHRB]]
''I Hate Running Backwards'' is a top-down shooter rogue-like endless runner. The game has two main game modes. single player and local cooperative multiplayer mode. Single player mode can be extended with the daily run which has its own leader-board. The daily run can be played only once a day, it has a random character (even ones that the player hasn't unlocked yet) each day, and the generated world is predefined for all players to have a similar game-play experience. The player controls one of 12 characters, 9 of which must be unlocked through game-play. Each character has two different primary weapons they use, except the character "The Bullet", which has only one weapons. Each character also has a unique ability be it an ultimate ability that he/she has to charge or a passive ability that is always active. These abilities offer a different play-style for each of the characters.

The player progresses through 5 different environments that are procedurally generated. The environments follow a set path, the order is always Sand, Jungle, Medieval, Mines, Greek. At the end of every environment the player faces one of the games 6 bosses. The last environments boss, Ugh Zan, has two different forms, and it's fought as two different bosses. After killing the final boss the player enters a time portal that teleports them to the first environment but with increased difficulty. Loops can be run endlessly and get more difficult each time. Loops increase the number of enemies and all the games enemies can be spawned on all environments after the first loop. The increase in difficulty also raises the number of environmental traps that can kill the player.

Killing the games bosses unlocks shrines in the games lobby that can activate curses. Curses add additional mechanics to the game that makes it more difficult. The curses range from additional environmental traps, like poison, to death lasers that follow the player around the game world. Each curse also adds a modifier to the final score. The curses add a way for the players to naturally increase the difficulty to the point that suits them.

The player character starts of with a basic pistol weapon that has infinite ammo and a melee weapon. During gameplay the player can pickup ammo for his primary weapons or destroy weapon crates to get special weapons. The 34 special weapons each have a unique twist to them, for example the biomedic sniper can heal the player, while the gravity gun can group up enemies and make short work of them. The player unlocks new special weapons by completing different tasks in the game.

While playing the player defeats enemies and destroys the environment to gather Mojo, the games equivalent to experience. When enough mojo is gathered the player level ups and gains a perk which he can select from a group of three different perk per level. The perk he/she will get on the next level up is also indicated to make it possible to plan out builds one level in advance.

== Plot ==
''I Hate Running Backwards'' is set in the universe of Serious Sam at an undisclosed moment in time. One of Mentals subordinates, Ugh-Zan has been put together from the parts of Ugh-Zan and Hugo and sent to the future to stop the group of heroes in fighting Mental. Ugh-Zans mind was uploaded to the new mechanized body and he can also transfer it to the tank module that is store inside his body as a last defense mode.

Sam and his group of heroes travel through time to defeat Mentals minions once and for all.

== Characters ==
[[File:SSPoseWiki.png|left|thumb|Serious Sam]]
''I Hate Running Backwards'' features characters from different franchises that were published by [[Devolver Digital]], with the exception of [[Nuclear Throne]] which was published and Developed by [[Vlambeer]].
The characters that are featured in the game are Serious Sam, Dancing Denzell and Fast Finger Freddie from the [[Serious Sam]] franchise, Richard from [[Hotline Miami]], Rambro from [[Broforce]], The Bullet from [[Enter the Gungeon]], Crystal from [[Nuclear Throne]] and Lo Wang from [[Shadow Warrior]]. The other 4 characters in game are unique characters from I Hate Running Backwards.

== Development ==
Development on ''I Hate Running Backwards'' started in 2016.  The developers of the game, Binx Interactive are a small team consisting of only five developers who worked on video games as a hobby, but were showing up to game developer conferences in Croatia. On one of the Conferences [[Croteam]]s CEO Roman Ribaric and CMO Damjan Mravunac decided to give Binx a chance in their new incubator program. The idea of the program was to provide local developers with the support and equipment to make full-fledged video games.

The idea for the game came from Serious Sams catch phrase: "I hate running backwards" alluding to him constantly having to run backwards from enemies to avoid them killing him. The game was first structured as a simple action endless runner game with the focus on leading enemies into environmental traps that were spawned behind the player. The challenge in the game would come from the player having to avoid the same traps he would have to lead the enemies into. One of the games programmers, Denis Mraović came up with the idea to add the hammer swing mechanic into the game at one point, as he felt that the constant shooting tired him out, and he wanted to have something more to do during game-play.

The game was first shown to the public at Reboot-Infogamer in 2016. where the game won the best game-play award. The games hammer mechanic led the developers to introducing a redesign in graphics and the world. The whole game world was made destructible with the goal to make the experience more hands on. During the development cycle the game took shape as a rogue-like endless runner that turned the shoot-em-up genre on its head.

Somewhere during 2017. Croteam and BinxInteractive got  [[Devolver Digital|Devolver-Digital]] on board as the games publisher. As the development moved on the team felt that they needed more distinct characters to fill the rooster of heroes. Devolver came up with the idea to use characters from their other IPs. Many of the games that inspired the team like ''[[Nuclear Throne|Nuclear throne]]'' and ''[[Enter the Gungeon]]'' had ties to Devolver directly or from previous projects. The game features twelve characters. Three characters are from the Serious Sam universe (Sam, Denzell and Fast Finger Freddie), Richard from [[Hotline Miami]], Rambro from [[Broforce]], The Bullet from [[Enter the Gungeon]], Crystal from [[Nuclear Throne]], Lo Wang from [[Shadow Warrior]] and 4 unique new characters (Dumpster Dave, Zombie Zed, Chux and Lady Death).

==Reception==
The game was named as one of the best games at [[PAX East]] 2018 by [[GamesRadar]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gamesradar.com/pax-east-2018-best-games/2/&lt;/ref&gt;
===Release===
The game received mixed reviews upon release on the PC platform, currently holding an aggregated score of 69 on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/i-hate-running-backwards&lt;/ref&gt; [[PC PowerPlay]] gave it 8/10 stating "The game is really quite brutal, but individual runs quite short. It’s a perfect palate-cleaner game – quick to load, easy to switch to from other applications, and over pretty fast. Unless you’re good at it, which, you know… I’m pretty much not. But it’s also just wonderfully silly fun. Bright, chaotic in the all the best ways, and always surprising.".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pcpowerplay.com.au/review/i-hate-running-backwards,491659&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[IEEE 802.11|802.11]] standard provides several distinct [[Radio frequency|radio frequencies]] ranges for use in Wi-FI communications: 900 [[Hertz|MHz]] 2.4 [[GHz]], 3.6 GHz, 4.9 GHz, 5 GHz, 5.9 GHz and 60 GHz [[band (radio)|bands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.radio-electronics.com/info/wireless/wi-fi/80211-channels-number-frequencies-bandwidth.php|title=WiFi Channels {{!}} WiFi Frequency Bands List {{!}} Radio-Electronics.com|website=www.radio-electronics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IEEE802.11-2007&gt;{{cite web | url=https://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/802.11.html | title=IEEE 802.11-2007: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) specifications | publisher=[[IEEE]] |date=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lifewire.com/wireless-standards-802-11a-802-11b-g-n-and-802-11ac-816553|title=802.11 WiFi Standards Explained|work=Lifewire|access-date=2018-08-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each range is divided into a multitude of [[Channel (communications)|channels]].

Fourteen channels are designated in the 2.4 GHz range, spaced 5 MHz apart from each other except for a 12 MHz space before channel 14.&lt;ref name=IEEE802.11-2012-16.4.6&gt;{{cite web | url=https://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/802.11.html | title=IEEE 802.11-2012: 16.4.6 - PMD Operating Specifications, General | publisher=[[IEEE]] | date=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 802.11g/n, it is not possible to guarantee [[orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]] (OFDM) operation, thus affecting the number of possible non-overlapping channels depending on radio operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/wireless/technology/channel/deployment/guide/Channel.html#Moving_to_802.11g | website=www.cisco.com |title=Channel Deployment Issues for 2.4-GHz 802.11 WLANs |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712140843/https://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/wireless/technology/channel/deployment/guide/Channel.html |archivedate=12 July 2007 |accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interference concerns===
As the protocol requires 16.25 to 22 MHz of channel separation (as shown above), adjacent channels overlap and will interfere with each other. Leaving three or four channels clear between used channels is recommended to avoid interference.&lt;ref name="compnetworking.about.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://compnetworking.about.com/od/wifihomenetworking/qt/wifichannel.htm |title=Choosing the right Wi-Fi channel can minimize wireless interference | website=compnetworking.about.com | accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact spacing required depends on the protocol and data rate selected as well as the electromagnetic environment where the equipment is used.

When two or more 802.11b transmitters are operated in the same airspace, their signals must be attenuated by -50 dBr and/or separated by 22 MHz to prevent interference.&lt;ref name=IEEE802.11-2012-16.4.7.5&gt;{{cite web | url=https://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/802.11.html | title=IEEE 802.11-2012: 16.4.7.5 - Transmit spectrum mask | publisher=[[IEEE]] | date=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the DSSS algorithm transmits data logarithmically along a 20 MHz bandwidth. 

The remaining 2 MHz gap is used as a [[guard band]] to allow sufficient attenuation along the edge channels. This guardband is mainly used to accommodate older routers with modem chipsets prone to full channel occupancy, as most modern WiFi modems are not prone to excessive channel occupancy.

:Note: The 40 MHz bands in the diagram above are labelled with their centre channel numbers, but the management interface of many Wi-Fi devices labels one of these bands with the centre channel of one of the 20 MHz bands it overlaps plus an Up or Down notation to specify the other half of the band. For example, channel 3 in the diagram is called channel 1+Upper or Channel 5+Lower, and Channel 11 in the diagram is called Channel 9+Upper or Channel 13+Lower.

''Nations apply their own RF emission regulations to the allowable channels, allowed users and maximum power levels within these frequency ranges. Network operators should consult their local authorities as these regulations may be out of date as they are subject to change at any time.  Most of the world will allow the first thirteen channels in the spectrum.''

Countries apply their own

European standard [[ETSI#ETSI deliverable types|EN]] 301 893 covers 5.15–5.725 GHz operation, and v1.8.1 is in force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=EN 300 328 V1.8.1 to be mandatory from 1st January 2015 | url=https://www.tuv-sud.co.uk/uk-en/about-tuev-sued/tuev-sued-in-the-uk/tuev-sued-product-service/tuev-sued-product-service-news/en-300-328-v1.8.1-to-be-mandatory-from-1st-january-2015 | accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] ([[United States]]) began requiring that devices operating on 5.250–5.350 GHz and 5.470–5.725 GHz must employ [[dynamic frequency selection#DFS|dynamic frequency selection]] (DFS) and [[power control#Transmit Power Control|transmit power control]] (TPC) capabilities.

Since this is the German implementation of EU Rule 2005/513/EC, similar regulations must be expected throughout the European Union.&lt;ref name=eur-lex1&gt;{{cite web | url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32005D0513:EN:NOT | title=EUR-Lex - 32005D0513 - EN - EUR-Lex | website=eur-lex.europa.eu | accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eur-lex2&gt;{{cite web | url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32007D0090:EN:NOT | title=EUR-Lex - 32007D0090 - EN - EUR-Lex | website=eur-lex.europa.eu | accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan's use of 10 and 20 MHz-wide 5 GHz wireless channels is codified by [[Association of Radio Industries and Businesses]] (ARIB) document STD-T71, ''Broadband Mobile Access Communication System (CSMA)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=List of ARIB Standards for Radio | url=https://www.arib.or.jp/english/html/overview/st_ej.html | website=www.arib.or.jp | accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional rule specifications relating to 40, 80, and 160 MHz channel allocation has been taken on by Japan's [[Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications]] (MIC).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web | title=Wi-Fi Amateur: IEEE Std 802.11ac Deployment in Japan | url=https://wifiamateur.blogspot.com/2013/04/80211ac-device-deployment-in-japan.html | website=wifiamateur.blogspot.com | date=3 April 2013 | accessdate=19 January 2016 | first=Chun "johnson" | last=Hou}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The MIC channel allowances, and which do and don't require DFS/TPC, and are outdoor or indoor only, need to be fully documented in the channel table. --&gt;

In Brazil, the TPC use in 5.150–5.725 GHz band is optional. DFS is required only in the 5.470–5.725 GHz band.&lt;ref name=Brazil-DFS&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.anatel.gov.br/legislacao/resolucoes/2008/104-resolucao-506 | title=Brazil: Resolução nº 506, de 01/07/2008, publicado no Diário Oficial de 07/07/2008 (in Brazilian Portuguese) | access-date=2017-08-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802212525/http://www.anatel.gov.br/legislacao/resolucoes/2008/104-resolucao-506 | archive-date=2017-08-02 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, some of the Australian channels require DFS to be utilised (a significant change from the 2000 regulations, which allowed lower power operation without DFS).&lt;ref name=Australia-F2015L01438/&gt; As per AS/NZS 4268 B1 and B2, transmitters designed to operate in any part of 5250–5350 GHz and 5470–5725 GHz bands shall implement DFS in accordance with sections 4.7 and 5.3.8 and Annex D of ETSI EN 301 893 or alternatively in accordance with FCC paragraph 15.407(h)(2). Also as per AS/NZS 4268 B3 and B4, transmitters designed to operate in any part of 5250–5350 MHz and 5470–5725 MHz bands shall implement TPC in accordance with sections 4.4 and 5.3.4 of ETSI EN 301 893 or alternatively in accordance with FCC paragraph 15.407(h)(1).

New Zealand regulation differs from Australian.&lt;ref name="rsm.govt.nz"&gt;https://www.rsm.govt.nz/cms/licensees/types-of-licence/general-user-licences/short-range-devices&lt;/ref&gt;

Singapore regulatory - IMDA requires DFS and TPC capabilities on 5.250–5.350 GHz above 100 mW (e.i.r.p.) and below or equal to 200 mW (e.i.r.p.), requires DFS capability on 5.250–5.350 GHz below or equal to 100 mW (e.i.r.p.), and requires DFS and TPC capabilities on 5.470-5.725 below or equal to 1000mW (e.i.r.p.).

China MIIT expanded allowed channels as of 31 December 2012 to add UNII-1, 5150 ~ 5250 GHz, UNII-2, 5250 ~ 5350 GHz (DFS/TPC), similar to European standards EN 301.893 V1.7.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.miit.gov.cn/n11293472/n11293832/n12843926/n13917072/15140529.html | website=www.miit.gov.cn |title=工业和信息化部发布5150-5350兆赫兹频段无线接入系统频率使用相关事宜的通知 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530151754/http://www.miit.gov.cn/n11293472/n11293832/n12843926/n13917072/15140529.html |archivedate=30 May 2013 |accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|5.9GHz}} 5.9 GHz (802.11p)==
The [[802.11p]] amendment, also known as Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE), published on 15 July 2010, specifies WLAN in the licensed [[Intelligent Transportation Systems]] (ITS) band of 5.9 GHz (5.850–5.925 GHz).&lt;ref name="WAVE"&gt;{{cite web | url=ftp://140.118.9.75/yhl/mobile12/802.11p-intro.pdf | last1=Jiang | first1=Daniel | last2=Delgrossi | first2=Luca | title=IEEE 802.11p: Towards an International Standard for Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments | publisher=IEEE | accessdate=28 December 2013 | date=2008 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 802.11p standard is intended for use in [[vehicular communication systems]].

==60 GHz (802.11ad/ay)==
The [[802.11ad]]/[[802.11ay|ay]], also known as [[WiGig]]. This operates in 60 GHz [[ISM band]].

==900 MHz (802.11ah)==
[[802.11ah]] operates in sub-gigahertz unlicensed bands. Each world region supports different sub-bands, and the channels number depends on the starting frequency of the sub-band it belongs to. Thus, there is no global channels numbering plan, and the channels numbers are incompatible between world regions (and even between sub-bands of a same world region).

The following sub-bands are defined in the [[802.11ah]] specifications:

According to MYTV, the initial annual rental fee for a 24-hour free-to-air TV channel was RM 12 million for a SDTV channel and RM 25 million for a HDTV channel for a continuous 24 hour slot.&lt;ref name="Maybank" /&gt; However, following reports of [[Media Prima]] might quit free-to-air transmission due to unviable fees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theedgemarkets.com/my/article/media-prima-may-exit-fta-space-due-unviable-dtt-fee|title=Media Prima may exit FTA space due to unviable DTT fee|date=9 May 2016|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; MYTV may introduce bandwidth based charging, which is already in consideration.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} On a statement given by MYTV CEO Michael Chan announced that transmission fees will be waived until June 2018, when Malaysia completes DTT migration by terminating analogue transmission. Rebates will be also given on a case-by-case basis for six months up to the end of 2018. He is also looking to bring the transmission fee down to between RM8 million and RM18 million, since the Malaysian TV market do not accept fees of RM12 million or RM25 million per channel.&lt;ref name="feewaiver"/&gt; The transmission cost for each SD and HD channel was eventually revised to RM6.7 milion and RM7.4mil respectively per year. &lt;ref name="NOPAYMENT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2018/11/02/mytv-in-payment-dispute-with-tm/#6wOi0s4DfdOC5BRe.99|title= MYTV in payment dispute with TM |publisher= The Star (Malaysia)| date=2 November 2018|accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distributions ===
According to former Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Minister [[Ahmad Shabery Cheek]], the MYTV Basic decoder would be distributed to around two million select Malaysian households while other recipients would be determined later.&lt;ref name="east coast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Metro/Community/2015/07/10/Transmitters-installed-East-coast-cities-to-receive-trial-MYTV-service-in-digital-format/|title=East coast cities to receive trial MYTV service in digital format|author=Ong Han Sean|publisher=The Star|date=10 July 2015|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; All 2 million households had now been determined and it would be sent to recipients house via PosLaju.&lt;ref name="MYTVFAQX" /&gt;

==== Types of decoders used by MYTV Broadcasting ====
There would be 3 types of set top boxes planned for use by MYTV, all with approved certification by "DTTV Malaysia". The first one is the trial test decoder, which was distributed to selected households for test transmission (which itself need to return to MYTV andeventually replaced by MYTV Basic STB). There are two standard set-top boxes issued, the first being the "MYTV Basic" decoder to be given to 2 million selected households nationwide for free, while the other is the standard "MYTV Advance" decoder, which is sold for RM299 excluding GST at [[Pos Malaysia]] branches and selected electrical stores. CI slots comes as a standard for both set top boxes, which it may be used for pay TV in the future.&lt;ref name="MYTVINS"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://mytvbroadcasting.my/panduanpemasangan2.html|title=MYTV Installation Guide |language=Malay|publisher=MYTV Broadcasting|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major differences for these set-top boxes is the latter one (MYTV Advance) comes with support for HbbTV while MYTV Basic did not come with such support. MYTV has sign an agreement with [[Pensonic]] to distribute MYTV Advance set top box exclusively on 29 November 2016.&lt;ref name="MYTVD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2016/11/29/pensonic-to-distribute-mytv-advance-decoder-sets/  |title= Pensonic to distribute MYTV Advance decoder sets|author=Tan Sin Chow|publisher=The Star (Malaysia)|date=29 November 2016|accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital televisions with "DTTV Malaysia" certification can also be used to receive transmission.&lt;ref name="myfreeviewhow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MYTVFAQX"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mytvbroadcasting.my/FAQ.html|title=MYTV FAQ |language=Malay|publisher=MYTV Broadcasting|access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="testphase" /&gt; 

==== Requirements to receive a free MYTV test decoder (known as MYTV Basic) ====
* Did not subscribe to paid broadcasts.
* Came from low-income group.
* Included in the category of recipients of government aid.

While households that are not listed as recipients of government aid could get the free decoders from branches which would be set up in every state after the launch in 2017. The temporary decoder would be replaced with a new decoder (known as MYTV Basic) in the final DTT test broadcasts at the end of 2016 with remote areas being distributed by [[Pos Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=101426|title=1,500 Sabah households for digital broadcast tests|publisher=[[Daily Express (Malaysia)|Daily Express]]|date=11 July 2015|access-date=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transmitters and frequencies ===
According to MYTV, there are 13 test phase sites which will be operate on the first stage, which it currently covers around 80% of population. MYTV will eventually develop 60 main transmitters and 40 gap fillers which it will cover 98% of population.&lt;ref name="testphase"/&gt;  Based on the information provided by myFreeview, 34 transmission sites are utilized to cover around 93% of Malaysian population via outdoor antenna. &lt;ref name="COVERA"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
myFreeview viewers residing in some/all parts of Sabah, Sarawak, Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, Negeri Sembilan, Melaka and Perak are facing prolonged no transmission issues since 11 and 25 October 2018, which 20 of 34 transmission sites has been taken down due to a payment dispute between Telekom Malaysia (TM) and MYTV Broadcasting. The remaining 14 sites was planned to taken down by TM at 1 November but those sites was eventually not taken down after intervention by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC). This dispute places analogue switch-off, which is planned on first quarter of 2019, in question.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8223">The '''[[music industry]] of [[East Asia]],''' a region that includes Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Mongolia, North Korea, South Korea and Taiwan is a rapidly growing [[economic sector]] that is home to some of the world's largest music markets.

== Milestones ==
[[File:Map_of_East_Asia.png|thumb|312x312px|Modern East Asia]]

In 2003, [[South Korea]] became the world's first music market where digital music sales surpassed those of physical formats.&lt;ref name="8thlargest"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marchand|first=Ruby|title=Trade Mission Engages Key Korean Music Professionals|url=http://www.grammy.com/blogs/trade-mission-engages-key-korean-music-professionals|publisher=[[Grammy Award]]|accessdate=2013-01-14|quote=...It's also the first country where digital surpassed physical sales.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McClure|first=Steve|title=Billboard Vol. 118, No. 18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6hUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA23|publisher=Billboard|year=2006|issn=0006-2510|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Japan]] surpassed the [[United States]] as the world's largest recorded music market for the first time, according to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]. Though the U.S. remained the largest if licensing fees are included into the figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan surpasses US as world's biggest recorded music market|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/tech-biz/04/09/13/japan-surpasses-us-worlds-biggest-recorded-music-market|author=[[Kyodo News]]|publisher=[[ABS-CBN News Channel]]|date=9 April 2013|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the following year, Japan fell back to the second-largest music market after experiencing a 16.7 per cent decrease due to the country's reliance of CDs and slow adoption of digital services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan drags down global music market|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-26626396|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=18 March 2014|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303287804579447222439275740|title=Japan Hits a Sour Note on Music Sales|author1=Karp, Hannah|author2=Inada, Miho|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=18 March 2014|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the digital music market in [[China]] is expected to be worth {{USD|2.1 billion}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.techinasia.com/china-streaming-music-baidu-alibaba-battle/|title=Already bigger than Spotify, China’s search engine giant doubles down on streaming music|author=Steven Millward|date=December 4, 2015|accessdate=December 4, 2015|work=Tech In Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt; China is expected to become one of the largest music markets in the world by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2015-12/21/content_22763869.htm|title=Music industry dreaming of China streaming|author=Chen Nan|date=December 21, 2015|accessdate=August 13, 2016|work=[[China Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contrast with the global music industry ==
Although global physical music sales (such as CDs) have been declining in recent years, in [[East Asia]] (particularly [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]]), however, physical music sales have been rising consistently.&lt;ref name="ifpi" /&gt;

The [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] credits this phenomenon to "[[K-Pop]] fans who want high-quality physical formats and deluxe box sets".&lt;ref name="ifpi"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1549940/francis-keeling-universal-musics-global-head-of-digital|title= Francis Keeling, Universal Music’s Global Head of Digital Business: Google Streaming Service ‘Is the Biggest Funnel We Can Have’|accessdate= 7 May 2013|publisher=''[[Billboard magazine]]''|quote=According to IFPI, global physical format sales declined from 61% in 2011 to an estimated 58% in 2012. However, in Japan, CD and DVD sales posted strong increases (sales numbers or percentages were not provided). While in South Korea physical sales are expected to rise for the third consecutive year, with IFPI crediting K-Pop fans who want high-quality physical formats and deluxe box sets, with driving the format's sustained popularity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a music executive from [[Universal Music Group]], CDs are becoming "the new merchandise in Asia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindvall|first=Helienne|title=How K-Pop &amp; J-Pop Are Saving Physical Music Sales|url=http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/permalink/2013/20130410kpopjpop|publisher=Digital Music News|accessdate=7 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518191654/http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/permalink/2013/20130410kpopjpop|archivedate=18 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Several controversies have arrived based on the way the industry has been treating its artists.

=== Control of artists personal lives ===
It is not uncommon for record labels to prohibit their pop artists from dating for a certain period of time or for as long as they have a contract with the company.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://japantoday.com/category/entertainment/3-ways-the-japanese-entertainment-industry-keeps-idol-singers-from-dating|title=3 ways the Japanese entertainment industry keeps idol singers from dating|work=Japan Today|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan managers may attempt to discourage their artists from dating or engaging in behavior that may tarnish their images by keeping a busy schedule and only letting artists know about their schedules a day at a time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Artists who break this contract, as in the case of [[Minami Minegishi]] from [[AKB48]], run the risk of getting dropped from their music group or contract.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35368705|title=The dark side of Asia’s pop music industry|last=Oi|first=Mariko|date=2016|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korea has similar rules for musical pop artists. Artists have more freedom to date and get married, however managers have strong control over their personal lives and behaviors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In Taiwan, artists are also expected to behave in certain ways, as they cannot discuss taboo topics such as politics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Censorship and propaganda==

International experts and the Belarusian opposition traditionally name the state TV as one of the main instruments of [[propaganda]] by the authoritarian regime of [[Alexander Lukashenko]]. It is being accused of misinformation, advocating political repressions and rigging of elections, smearing regime critics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2011/11/8/6740159/ Посол Польщі Генрик Літвін: Втратити добрий час – це великий ризик для України] - СЕРГІЙ ЛЕЩЕНКО, [[Ukrayinska Pravda]], 8 November 2011. Henryk Litwin, former ambassador of [[Poland]] to Belarus: "Television in Belarus is exclusively state propaganda"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edwardlucas.com/2017/01/20/belarus-propaganda/ Edward Lucas Podcast: Belarus propaganda] - 20.01.2017.

Employees and top managers of state TV channels, including channels of BTRC, have several times been subjects to sanctions from the [[EU]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://nn.by/?c=ar&amp;i=61552 Поўны спіс 208 беларускіх чыноўнікаў, якім забаронены ўезд у ЕС] [Full list of 208 Belarusian officials banned from entering the EU] - [[Nasha Niva]], 11 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Neon Genesis Evangelion'''''|新世紀エヴァンゲリオン|Shin Seiki Evangerion}} is a Japanese [[media franchise]] created by [[Hideaki Anno]] and owned by [[Khara (studio)|Khara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bricken|first=Rob|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-original-evangelion-tv-series-is-finally-coming-to-1665689931|title=The Original Evangelion TV Series Is Finally Coming To Blu-Ray (io9)|publisher=[[Gizmodo|Gizmodo Media Group]]|date=December 12, 2014|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evangelion.co.jp/neon_genesis.html|title=新世紀エヴァンゲリオン|publisher=[[Khara (studio)|Khara, Inc.]]|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the franchise features an [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apocalyptic]] [[mecha]] action story, which revolves around the efforts by the [[paramilitary]] organization NERV to fight hostile beings called [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)|Angels]], using giant humanoids called [[Evangelion (mecha)|Evangelions]] that are piloted by select teenagers. Other works deviate from this theme to varying degrees, focusing more on romantic interactions between the characters, side stories which did not appear in the original works, and/or reimaginings of the conflicts from the original works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=「ヱヴァ」総監督　劇場で"緊急声明" |url=http://www.sponichi.co.jp/entertainment/news/2007/02/12/02.html |work=Sponichi Annex |date=February 12, 2007 |accessdate=November 21, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309002219/http://www.sponichi.co.jp/entertainment/news/2007/02/12/02.html |archivedate=March 9, 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (manga)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' [[manga]] debuted in [[Shōnen Ace]] in December 1994, as a way to generate interest in the upcoming anime release. The ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (anime)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' anime was written and directed by [[Hideaki Anno]] and originally aired from October 1995 to March 1996. The show was groundbreaking, delving into religious, psychological and philosophical themes on an otherwise standard [[mecha]] backdrop. There was some debate over the controversial ending of the television series. In response, two films were made to provide an alternate ending for the show: ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death &amp; Rebirth]]'', released in March 1997, and ''[[The End of Evangelion]]'' released in July 1997. ''Death'' is a compilation of clips from the TV series, with some new footage added, and ''Rebirth'' comprises the first 30 minutes or so of ''End of Evangelion''.

The popularity of the show spawned numerous additional media, including video games, radio dramas, audio books, a novel, [[pachinko]] machines, and a [[tetralogy]] of films titled ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]''. Other derivative works include ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days|Angelic Days]]'', ''[[Petit Eva: Evangelion@School]]'' and ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Campus Apocalypse|Campus Apocalypse]]''. As of June 2018, it is the 17th [[List of highest-grossing media franchises|highest-grossing franchise]] of all-time, with an estimated revenue of {{US$|14.9 billion|long=no}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Peters |first=Megan |title='Pokemon' Is The Highest-Grossing Franchise Of All-Time |url=http://comicbook.com/anime/2018/06/24/pokemon-franchise-revenue-anime-media/ |accessdate=August 13, 2018 |work=ComicBook.com |date=June 23, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Setting ==
Works within the ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' franchise typically have the same setting, characters and theme, but can vary in their portrayal of the storyline with alternate re-tellings of the original anime. ''Evangelion''{{'}}s fictional setting takes place after the Second Impact, a cataclysmic explosion in [[Antarctica]] which resulted in the deaths of billions and threw the Earth off its axis. Fifteen years after the Second Impact, a group of mysterious beings referred to as "[[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)|Angels]]" begin appearing and pose a worldwide and existential threat to mankind. The NERV organization, a paramilitary special agency, is tasked with defeating the Angels, with the use of giant mechanical warriors known as "[[Evangelion (mecha)|Evangelions]]" to fight them. A select group of children pilot the Evangelions, with a focus on [[Shinji Ikari]], [[Rei Ayanami]] and [[Asuka Langley Soryu]].

The backdrop of ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' slowly reveals the true nature of Rei Ayanami, the Evangelions, the Angels, and the NERV and SEELE organizations. Religious themes, include [[Christianity]] and [[Kabbalah]] references to [[Adam]], [[Lilith]] and the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. The series is well known for its [[psychoanalysis]] of the characters, most heavily covered in the implementation of the Human Instrumentality Project, the secret goal of NERV and SEELE, whose result varies across different media, including the original anime, films, manga and video games.

On September 9, 2006, Gainax confirmed a new animated film series called ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]'', consisting of four movies presenting an alternate retelling of the TV series (including new scenes, settings, and characters) and a completely new conclusion to the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.evangelion.co.jp/ | title = Rebuild of Evangelion | accessdate = 2006-09-12 | publisher = Gainax | date = 2006-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first film [[Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone]] was released in Japan on September 1, 2007, with the [[Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance]] and [[Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo]] released on June 27, 2009 and November 17, 2012.

===Live-action film===
Development of a live-action movie version of ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' by [[Gainax]], [[Weta Workshop|Weta Workshop Ltd.]], and [[ADV Films]] (then the worldwide distributor of the ''Evangelion'' series outside of [[Asia]] and [[Australia]]) was announced at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] on May 21, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Live Action Eva Press Release |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=21 May 2003 |accessdate=13 March 2012 |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2003-05-21/live-action-eva-press-release}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early coverage included ADV Films raising "about half of the $100 million to $120 million needed to produce the film"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roth|first=Daniel|title=It's...

As time passed without any official announcements of production, the film project showed increasing signs of being in [[development hell]]. At [[Anime Expo]] 2008, ADV founders Matt Greenfield and John Ledford revealed that they had hired the producer [[John Woo]], pitched the idea to other producers such as [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] and [[Steven Spielberg]],&lt;ref name="Jane And The Dragon Interview with Richard Taylor and Martin Baynton"&gt;[http://www.411mania.com/movies/columns/82079/The-Vile-One%5C%5Cs-Dungeon-8.07.08:-San-Diego-Comic-Con-2008---Jane-And-The-Dragon-Interview-with-Richard-Taylor-and-Martin-Baynton.htm Movies - The Vile One's Dungeon 8.07.08: San Diego Comic Con 2008 - Jane And The Dragon Interview with Richard Taylor and Martin Baynton]. 411mania.com (2011-05-02).

In August 2011, Vision sued Gainax, claiming their refusal to accept an [[Option (filmmaking)|option]] payment for the perpetual live-action rights to ''Evangelion'' was a breach of contract and resulted in losing an opportunity to produce the film with a major studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2011/08/12/ad-vision-inc-sues-gainax-co-ltd-over-live-action-evangelion-movie-agreement|title=A.D.

==Other media==
The ''Evangelion'' franchise has spread from the original anime into a number of different media, with some following the official [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] (of the 26-episode anime series and its three related films or the new ''Rebuild'' series) and others differing on important plot points originally introduced in the anime.

===Books===

William B. Fosser's puppet production '''Opera in Focus''' is a troupe which performs [[opera]] and [[musical theater]] with some of the world's most sophisticated puppets. The Opera in Focus puppet opera theater is located in [[Rolling Meadows, Illinois]].

==History==
Fosser, a puppeteer and artistic director of the legendary Kungsholm Miniature Opera in [[Chicago]], began designing the puppets that would eventually be used in his Opera in Focus productions in the late 1930s. The cost involved in building each elaborately articulated puppet prevented him from constructing them until 1956.  He presented the first Opera in Focus performances—by invitation only—in 1958 in a rented store on the [[neighborhoods of Chicago|north side of Chicago]], where they were received with great enthusiasm.
[[File:244.x600.class.puppetopera.open.jpg|thumb |alt=Opera In Focus |Pagliacci]]

In order to support the puppet opera, Fosser made a living as a [[set designer]] and [[art director]] in the motion picture industry, working on such films as ''[[Ordinary People]]'', ''[[Home Alone]]'', ''[[Backdraft (film)|Backdraft]]'', ''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]]'', ''[[Music Box (film)|Music Box]]'', ''[[Damien: Omen II]]'', ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'', ''[[A League of Their Own]]'' and ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]''.  He also worked as a set designer for live theatrical productions, designing scenery for the [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]], as well as the Candlelight, Ivanhoe, and Drury Lane theaters.  He spent his free time further developing and perfecting his puppets and the presentation of his elaborate miniature operatic productions.  Due to the hectic nature of his career in the film industry, performances of Opera in Focus were infrequent, except for periods in 1962-1963 and 1978-1979 when Opera in Focus enjoyed residencies in Detroit and at the now-defunct Magic Pan restaurant in Chicago.

In 1993 the Rolling Meadows Chamber of Commerce offered Fosser a permanent home in [[Rolling Meadows, Illinois]], where Opera in Focus has been performed weekly ever since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toytheatre.info/Network/Fosser/Review02/Review02.htm Puppet Love: Bill Fosser's Quest to Keep Miniature Opera Alive]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.niu.edu/ipo/1995/ip950530.html article in ''Illinois Parks &amp; Recreation'', May/June 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Fosser received the President's Award from the Puppeteers of America.  Opera in Focus has received a number of awards including the prestigious Dorothy Mullen Award from the National Parks and Recreation Association for Fine Arts Programming.

William Fosser died of congestive heart failure and pneumonia on February 19, 2006, in Resurrection Hospital, in Chicago. He was buried at [[Queen of Heaven Cemetery]] in [[Hillside, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://toytheatre.info/Memories/Fosser/obit206.html Fosser's Obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theater continues to present a stunning sampling of fully staged scenes from well-known operas &amp; musicals. Each hour-long performance may offer between three and five scenes, depending on the length of the individual segments. A narration of the action by the well-known actor, Tony Mockus, precedes each scene. The 16" puppets are manipulated from below the stage floor and are capable of very lifelike action and dramatic gestures for which opera singers are so famous.

A demonstration of the puppet operation and a tour of the highly technical backstage area follow each performance. Despite the small stage (only five feet wide and two feet deep), the illusion of live opera prevails. The puppet opera performances are capable of charming a wide range of audiences - from the lovers of opera and musical theater to those simply fascinated by the fine art of puppetry.

Such applications can be as rudimentary as displaying a [[star chart]] or [[star cartography|sky map]] for a specific time and location, or as complex as [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering photorealistic]] views of the [[sky]].

While some planetarium software is meant to be used exclusively on a personal computer, some applications can be used to interface with and [[GoTo (telescopes)|control telescopes]] or [[planetarium projector]]s. Optional features may include inserting the [[orbital elements]] of comets and other newly discovered bodies for display.

The '''Public Broadcasting Act of 1967''' ({{usc|47|396}}) set up [[public broadcasting]] in the [[United States]], establishing the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] (CPB) and, eventually, the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS), and [[National Public Radio]] (NPR).

The act charged the CPB with encouraging and facilitating program diversity, and expanding and developing non-commercial [[broadcasting]]. The CPB would have the funds to help local stations create innovative programs, thereby increasing the service of broadcasting in the public interest throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burke|first=John|title=An Historical-Analytical Study of the Legislative and Political Origins of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967|year=1972|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=FenfjvstLXUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR2&amp;dq=%22Public+Broadcasting+Act+of+1967%22&amp;ots=-MmXx2KoMA&amp;sig=0LVfwGZRNloAI87V_ZFyxOHHE3g#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:L.B. Johnson signing Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.jpg|thumb|upright|President Lyndon B. Johnson signs the Act on November 7, 1967.]]
The act was supported by many prominent Americans, including [[Fred Rogers]] ("Mister Rogers"), one of the founders of NPR and creator of All Things Considered [[Robert Conley (reporter)|Robert Conley]], and Senator [[John O. Pastore]], then chairman of the [[United States Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Communications and Technology|Senate Subcommittee on Communications]], during the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and [[United States Senate]] hearings in 1967.

The [[United States House of Representatives]] passed the bill 266-91 on September 21, 1967, with 51 members voting "present" and two not voting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/90-1967/h140 House Roll Call 140, 1967]&lt;/ref&gt;

When President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed the act into law on November 7, 1967, he described its purpose as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It announces to the world that our nation wants more than just material wealth; our nation wants more than a 'chicken in every pot.' We in America have an appetite for excellence, too.  While we work every day to produce new goods and to create new wealth, we want most of all to enrich man's spirit.  That is the purpose of this act.&lt;ref name="cpbabout"&gt;[http://www.cpb.org/aboutpb/act/remarks.html Remarks of President Lyndon B. Johnson Upon Signing the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967] at cpb.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It will give a wider and, I think, stronger voice to educational [[radio]] and [[National Educational Television|television]] by providing new funds for broadcast facilities.  It will launch a major study of [[Instructional television|television's use in the Nation's classrooms]] and its potential use throughout the world.  Finally — and most important — it builds a new institution: the Corporation for Public Broadcasting."&lt;ref name="cpbabout"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The act was originally to be called the "Public Television Act" and focus exclusively on television, worrying supporters of public radio. However, in a sudden change of fortune, Senator [[Robert P. Griffin|Robert Griffin]] suggested changing the name to the "Public Broadcasting Act" when the bill passed through the Senate. After several revisions, including last-minute changes added with [[Scotch Tape]], the law signed by Johnson included radio. This set the path for the incorporation of [[National Public Radio]] (NPR) in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hellewell|first=Emily|title=How Public Radio Scotch-Taped Its Way Into Public Broadcasting Act|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thisisnpr/2012/11/08/164624162/how-public-radio-scotch-taped-its-way-into-public-broadcasting-act|accessdate=20 March 2013|date=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational television==
In addition to the progress made by the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, other areas such as [[educational television]] (ETV) made headway as well. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) had reserved almost 250 [[Channel (communications)|channel]] frequencies for educational stations in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FenfjvstLXUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=An Historical-Analytical Study of the Legislative and Political Origins of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 |first=John Edward |last=Burke| publisher= Ayer Publishing|year= 1980|accessdate=2012-05-01| isbn=0-405-11756-6 |work= Dissertations in Broadcasting}}&lt;/ref&gt; although, seven years later, only 44 such stations were in operation.&lt;ref name="britannica1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1513870/Television-in-the-United-States/283623/Educational-TV?anchor=ref1057430 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Television in the United States |accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1969, the number of stations had climbed to 175.

Each week, the National Education Television and Radio Center (renamed in 1963 to [[National Educational Television]]) aired a few hours of relatively inexpensive programs to educational stations across the country. These programs were produced by a plethora of stations across the nation, such as [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] in [[Boston]], [[WTTW]] in [[Chicago]], and [[KQED (TV)|KQED]] in [[San Francisco]]. Unfortunately, with the growth of [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial]] radio and television, the more poorly-funded educational programming was being largely ignored. The higher budgets of the commercial media were making it difficult for the educational programs to compete, due to their smaller budgets.

The networks airing educational programming began to favor the commercial entertainment programs because they lured more people, and thus more [[advertising]] dollars. Locally run, [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] television and radio tried to "fill in the gaps"&lt;ref name="enotes1"/&gt; but, due to the technology gap created by budget constraints, it was increasingly difficult to produce the high-tech programming that consumers were used to.

In 1965, the increasing distance between commercial and educational programming led to the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] ordering its Commission on Education Television to conduct a study of ETV and, from that study, derive changes and recommendations for future action regarding ETV. The report created from the study was published about two years later and became a "catalyst and model"&lt;ref name="britannica1"/&gt; for the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.

With the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, smaller television and radio broadcasters were able to be heard by a wider range of [[Audience measurement|audiences]], and new and developing broadcasters were encouraged to display their knowledge to the country. Before 1967, commercial radio and television was widely used by major networks in order to attract advertisers. Smaller networks were unable to make much impact due to their lack of budget.&lt;ref name="enotes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/major-acts-congress/public-broadcasting-act |title=Public Broadcasting Act of 1967|publisher=Enotes |accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act provided a window for broadcasters to get their message across and, in some cases, straight to the point. Even people who could not afford [[Pay television|premium channels]] were always provided with [[PBS]] as an additional network to the [[Big Three television networks|Big Three]].

Many adults and children today would have grown up without some of the more well-known [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] shows, such as ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'' without this act. Many other shows are informative to everyday needs or concerns. Local events and special offers were a bonus but were generally targeted at larger audiences so they were not always beneficial for the station.

==Concepts==
[[Public broadcasting]] includes multiple [[news media|media outlets]], which receive some or all of their funding from the public. The main media outlets consist of radio and television. Public broadcasting consists of organizations such as CPB, [[Public Broadcasting Service]], and [[National Public Radio]], organizations independent of each other and of the local public television and radio stations across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= About the Corporation for Public Broadcasting|url=http://www.cpb.org/aboutcpb/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CPB was created and funded by the federal government; it does not produce or distribute any programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporation for Public Broadcasting|url=http://www.cpb.org/aboutpb/faq/cpbpbsnpr.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511193653/http://www.cpb.org/aboutpb/faq/cpbpbsnpr.html|archivedate=2015-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] is a private, nonprofit corporation, founded in 1969, whose members are America's public TV stations — noncommercial, educational licensees that operate nearly 360 PBS member stations and serve all 50 states, [[Puerto Rico]], [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]], [[Guam]] and [[American Samoa]].&lt;ref name="pbshome"&gt;{{cite web|title=PBS|url=https://www.pbs.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=May 2012}} The nonprofit organization also reaches almost 117 million people through television and nearly 20 million people online each month.&lt;ref name="pbshome"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=May 2012}}

NPR is a [[multimedia]] news organization and radio program producer, with member stations and supporters nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NPR|url=https://www.npr.org/about/aboutnpr/history.html|title=About NPR: Overview and History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent developments==

[[Bob McDonnell]], the governor of [[Virginia]], slashed $424,000 from the annual budget of public broadcasting in that state in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://washingtonexaminer.com/mcdonnell-trims-public-broadcasting-funding-with-line-item-veto/article/144690 "McDonnell Trims Funds"],&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://wcfcourier.com/news/local/article_4191f182-74da-11e0-be1d-001cc4c002e0.html Public broadcasting exec to speak at KBBG banquet]

PBS anchor [[Jim Lehrer]] said that there is a need to increase federal funding in order to meet the need of serious [[journalism]] as broadcasters and commercial newspapers see decline. Lehrer said, "Public media needs to produce more [[local news]] and serious journalism because other channels are being used to tease and to entertain and only to inform across the surface. I have a good source on why this is a problem. The source is [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Thomas Jefferson told the folks back when this country was founded that the only way this democratic society we just created is going to work is if there is an informed electorate."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/public-broadcasters-from-pbs-npr-local-stations-ponder-future-after-latest-funding-threats/2011/04/26/AFfMAunE_story.html "Future Funding"],&lt;/ref&gt;

Public broadcasting funding is to retain most of what President [[Barack Obama]] had set aside for it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2011/apr/14/entertainment/la-et-quick-20110414 "Budget"],&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[music production]] or [[music composition|composition]], [[recording studio]]s are sometimes referred to as an instrument forming a vital part of the music creation process. Also known as "playing the studio", the approach is typically embodied by artists or producers who place less emphasis on simply capturing live performances in studio and instead favor the creative use of studio technology in completing finished works.{{sfn|Greene|2016|p=179}} Techniques include the incorporation of [[noise in music|non-musical sounds]], [[overdub]]bing, [[magnetic tape|tape]] edits, [[sound synthesis]], [[Audio_signal_processing#Audio_effects|audio signal processing]], and combining segmented performances ([[Take#Music_recording|takes]]) into a unified whole.

Composers have been exploiting the potentials of [[multitrack recording]] since the technology was made available to them. Before the late 1940s, musical recordings were typically created with the idea of presenting a faithful rendition of a real-life performance. Following the advent of three-track tape in the mid 1950s, recording spaces became more accustomed for in-studio composition. By the late 1960s, in-studio composition had become standard practice, and remained so into the 2010s. Despite the widespread changes that have led to more compact recording set-ups, individual components such as [[digital audio workstation]]s are still referred to as "the studio".

[[Rock music|Rock]] historian Doyle Greene defines "studio as compositional tool" as a process in which music is produced around studio constructions rather than the more traditional method of capturing a live performance as is.{{sfn|Greene|2016|p=179}} Techniques include the incorporation of [[noise in music|non-musical sounds]], [[overdub]]bing, [[magnetic tape|tape]] edits, [[sound synthesis]], [[Audio_signal_processing#Audio_effects|audio signal processing]], and combining segmented performances ([[Take#Music_recording|takes]]) into a unified whole.{{sfn|Greene|2016|p=179}} Despite the widespread changes that have led to more compact recording set-ups, individual components such as DAWs are still referred to as "the studio".{{sfn|Bell|2018|p=34}}

==Evolution of recording processes==
[[File:MFQ with Phil Spector.jpg|thumb|right|[[Phil Spector]] (center) at [[Gold Star Studios]], where he developed his [[Wall of Sound]] methods, 1965]]

Composers have been exploiting the potentials of [[multitrack recording]] since the technology was made available to them.{{sfn|Eno|2004|p=127}} Before the late 1940s, musical recordings were typically created with the idea of presenting a faithful rendition of a real-life performance.{{sfn|Eno|2004|p=128}} Writing in 1937, the American composer [[John Cage]] called for the development of "centers of experimental music" places where "the new materials, oscillators, turntables, generators, means for amplifying small sounds, film phonographs, etc." would allow composers to "work using twentieth-century means for making music."&lt;ref&gt;Cage, J.(2004),'The Future of Music Credo,'in Cox, Christoph; Warner, Daniel. Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music. A&amp;C Black. {{ISBN|978-0-8264-1615-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s, electronic equipment was expensive to own, and for most people, was only accessible through large organizations or institutions. However, virtually every young composer was interested in the potential of tape-based recording.&lt;ref name="HolmesHolmes2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmes|first1=Thomas B.|last2=Holmes|first2=Thom|title=Electronic and Experimental Music: Pioneers in Technology and Composition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ILkquoGXEq0C|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-93644-6|pages=81–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Brian Eno]], "the move to tape was very important", because unlike [[gramophone records]], tape was "malleable and mutable and cuttable and reversible in ways that discs aren't. It's very hard to do anything interesting with a disc".{{sfn|Eno|2004|p=128}} In the mid 1950s, popular recording conventions changed profoundly with the advent of three-track tape,{{sfn|Eno|2004|pp=128–129}} and by the early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, and engineers to freely experiment with [[musical form]], [[orchestration]], [[reverberation|unnatural reverb]], and other sound effects. Some of the best known examples are [[Phil Spector]]'s [[Wall of Sound]] and [[Joe Meek]]'s use of homemade electronic sound effects for acts like [[the Tornados]].{{sfn|Blake|2009|p=45}}

In-studio composition became standard practice by the late 1960s and early 1970s, and remained so into the 2010s. During the 1970s, the "studio as instrument" concept shifted from the studio's recording space to the studio's control room, where electronic instruments could be plugged directly into the mixing console.{{sfn|Bell|2018|p=49}} As of the 2010s, the "studio as instrument" idea remains ubiquitous in genres such as [[pop music|pop]], [[hip-hop music|hip-hop]], and electronic music.&lt;ref name="Ableton1"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of The Studio As An Instrument: Part 1 - Early Reflections|url=https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/studio-as-an-instrument-part-1/|website=Ableton.com|date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable artists and works==
===1940s–1950s===
* Pioneers from the 1940s include [[Bill Putnam]], [[Les Paul]], and [[Tom Dowd]], who each contributed to the development of common recording practices like reverb, [[Delay (audio effect)|tape delay]], and [[overdubbing]]. Putnam was one of the first to recognize echo and reverb as elements to enhance a recording, rather than as natural byproducts of the recording space. He engineered [[the Harmonicats]]' 1947 novelty song "[[Peg o' My Heart]]", which was a significant chart hit and became the first popular recording to use artificial reverb for artistic effect.&lt;ref name="Ableton1"/&gt; Although Les Paul was not the first to use overdubs, he popularized the technique in the 1950s.{{sfn|Bell|2018|p=12, 39}}

* Around the same time, French composers [[Pierre Schaeffer]] and [[Pierre Henry]] were developing ''[[musique concrete]]'', a method of composition in which pieces of tape are rearranged and spliced together, and thus originated [[sampling (music)|sampling]]. Meanwhile in England, [[Daphne Oram]] experimented heavily with [[electronic instrument]]s during her tenure as a balancing engineer for the [[BBC]], however, her tape experiments were mostly unheard at the time.&lt;ref name="Ableton1"/&gt;

* English producer Joe Meek is considered one of the most influential engineers of all time,{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} being one of the first to exploit the use of recording studios as instruments, and one of the first producers to assert an [[auteur|individual identity as an artist]].&lt;ref name="tmtpat2013"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patrick|first1=Jonathan|title=Joe Meek's pop masterpiece ''I Hear a New World'' gets the chance to haunt a whole new generation of audiophile geeks|url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/news/joe-meeks-pop-masterpiece-i-hear-a-new-world-gets-the-chance-to-haunt-a-whole-new-generation-of|website=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]|date=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He got his start in 1955 at IBC Studio in London. One of Meek's signature techniques was to overload a signal with [[dynamic range compression]], which was unorthodox at the time. Several of his "radical" techniques (such as close-miking instruments) later became part of normal recording practice.&lt;ref name="Ableton1"/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|His employers often antagonized him over his methods, and to escape this, he developed a home studio in 1960.&lt;ref name="Ableton1"/&gt;}}

* Discussing [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]], Adam Bell describes the songwriting duo's productions for [[the Coasters]] as "an excellent example of their pioneering practices in the emerging field of production", citing an account from Stoller in which he recalls "cutting esses off words, sticking the tape back together so you didn't notice. And sometimes if the first refrain on a take was good and the second one lousy, we'd tape another recording of the first one and stick it in place of the second one."{{sfn|Bell|2018|p=39}}

* Phil Spector, sometimes regarded as Joe Meek's American counterpart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gritten|first1=David|title=Joe Meek and the tragic demise of the maverick who revolutionised British pop|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/joe-meek-and-the-tragic-demise-of-the-maverick-who-revolutionise/|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=October 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also considered "important as the first star producer of popular music and its first 'auteur' ... Spector changed pop music from a performing art ... to an art which could sometimes exist only in the recording studio".{{sfn|Bannister|2007|p=38}} His original production formula (dubbed the "Wall of Sound") called for large ensembles (including some instruments not generally used for ensemble playing, such as [[electric guitar|electric]] and [[acoustic guitars]]), with multiple instruments doubling and even tripling many of the parts to create a fuller, richer sound.{{sfn|Zak|2001|p=77}}{{refn|group=nb|For example, Spector would often duplicate a part played by an [[acoustic piano]] with an [[electric piano]] and a [[harpsichord]].{{sfn|Ribowsky|1989|pp=185-186}} Session guitarist [[Barney Kessel]] notes: "Musically, it was terribly simple, but the way he recorded and miked it, they’d diffuse it so that you couldn't pick out any one instrument. Techniques like distortion and echo were not new, but Phil came along and took these to make sounds that had not been used in the past. I thought it was ingenious."{{sfn|Ribowsky|1989|pp=185-186}} }} It evolved from his mid-1950s work with Leiber and Stoller during the period in which they sought a fuller sound through excessive instrumentation.{{sfn|Moorefield|2010|p=10}}{{refn|group=nb|Leiber and Stoller considered Spector's methods to be very distinct from what they were doing, stating: "Phil was the first one to use multiple [[drum kit]]s, three pianos and so on.

He definitely had a different point of view."{{sfn|Moorefield|2010|p=10}}}} His 1963 production of "[[Be My Baby]]", according to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, was a "[[Rosetta Stone|Rosetta stone]] for studio pioneers such as [[the Beatles]] and [[Brian Wilson]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/11028260/the_rs_500_greatest_songs_of_all_time/1|title=The RS 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|publisher=RollingStone.com|accessdate=2007-06-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516110704/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/11028260/the_rs_500_greatest_songs_of_all_time/1|archivedate=16 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beatles and George Martin in studio 1966.JPG|thumb|right|Martin working with the Beatles, 1964]]

* The Beatles' producer [[George Martin]] and [[the Beach Boys]]' producer-songwriter Brian Wilson are generally credited with helping to popularize the idea of the studio as an instrument used for in-studio composition, and music producers after the mid 1960s increasingly drew from their work.{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=890}}{{refn|group=nb|Academic [[Bill Martin (philosophy)|Bill Martin]] writes that the advancing technology of multitrack recording and [[mixing board]]s were more influential to [[experimental rock]] than [[electronic instruments]] such as the [[synthesizer]], allowing the Beatles and the Beach Boys to become the first crop of non-[[classically trained]] musicians to create extended and complex compositions.{{sfn|Martin|2015|p=75}}}} Although Martin was nominally the Beatles' producer, from 1964 he ceded control to the band, allowing them to use the studio as a workshop for their ideas and later as a sound laboratory.{{sfn|Millard|2012|pp=178–79}} Musicologist Olivier Julien writes that the Beatles' "gradual integration of arranging and recording into one and the same process" began as early as 1963, but developed in earnest during the sessions for ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' (1965) and ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' (1966) and "ultimately blossomed" during the sessions for ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1967).{{sfn|Julien|2008|p=162}} Wilson, who was mentored by Spector,{{sfn|Cogan|Clark|2003|pp=32–33}} was another early auteur of popular music.{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=890}} Authors Jim Cogan and William Clark credit him as the first rock producer to use the studio as a discrete instrument.{{sfn|Cogan|Clark|2003|pp=32–33}}

|description  = Author Mark Brend writes that, with ''Revolver'', the Beatles advanced on Meek's approach, and employed the studio as "an environment for wide-ranging sonic research" that included experimentation with [[tape loop]]s, reversed and speed-manipulated tape sounds, and backwards-recorded lead guitar parts.{{sfn|Brend|2005|pp=55–56}} 
}}

: According to author David Howard, Martin's work on the Beatles' "[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]", from  ''Revolver'', and Spector's production  of "[[River Deep – Mountain High]]" from the same year were the two recordings that ensured that the studio "was now its own instrument".{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=2–3}} Citing composer and producer [[Virgil Moorefield]]'s book ''The Producer as Composer'', author Jay Hodgson highlights ''Revolver'' as representing a "dramatic turning point" in recording history through its dedication to studio exploration over the "performability" of the songs, as this and subsequent Beatles albums reshaped listeners' preconceptions of a pop recording.{{sfn|Hodgson|2010|pp=viii–ix}} According to Julien, the follow-up LP ''Sgt. Pepper'' represents the "epitome of the transformation of the recording studio into a compositional tool", marking the moment when "popular music entered the era of phonographic composition."{{sfn|Julien|2008|pp=166–167}} Composer and musicologist [[Michael Hannan (composer)|Michael Hannan]] attributes the album's impact to Martin and his engineers, in response to the Beatles' demands, making increasingly creative use of studio equipment and originating new processes.{{sfn|Hannan|2008|p=46}}

: Like ''Revolver'', "[[Good Vibrations]]", which Wilson produced for the Beach Boys in 1966, was a prime proponent in revolutionizing rock from live concert performances into studio productions that could only exist on record.{{sfn|Ashby|2004|p=282}} For the first time, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or "modules") rather than a complete song. Through the method of [[tape splicing]], each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence – as Wilson explored on subsequent recordings from this period – allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time.&lt;ref name="ARP"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heiser|first1=Marshall|title=SMiLE: Brian Wilson’s Musical Mosaic|journal=The Journal on the Art of Record Production|date=November 2012|issue=7|url=http://arpjournal.com/smile-brian-wilson%E2%80%99s-musical-mosaic/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Academic Marshall Heiser saw the resultant style of jumpcuts as a "striking characteristic", and that they "must be acknowledged as compositional statements in themselves, giving the music a sonic signature every bit as noticeable as the performances themselves.

===1970s–2010s===
[[File:Brian Eno live remix at Punkt 2012 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Brian Eno]] at a live remix in 2012]]

* Adam Bell credits [[Brian Eno]] with popularizing the concept of the studio as instrument, particularly that it "did not require previous experience, and in some ways, a lack of know-how might even be advantageous to creativity", and that "such an approach was typified" by [[Kraftwerk]], whose members proclaimed "we play the studio".{{sfn|Bell|2018|p=49}} He goes on to say:

: {{quote|While those of the ilk of Brian Wilson used the studio as an instrument by orchestrating everyone that worked within it, the turn to technology in the cases of [[Sly Stone]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], and Brian Eno signify a conceptual shift in which an alternative approach that might make using the studio as an instrument cheaper, easier, more convenient, or more creative, was increasingly sought after. Compared to the 1960s, using the studio as an instrument became less about working ''the system'' as it were, and working the ''systems''.{{sfn|Bell|2018|p=49}} }}

* Jamaican producer [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]] is noted for his 70s [[reggae]] and [[Dub music|dub]] productions, recorded at his [[Black Ark Studios|Black Ark]] studio.{{sfn|Toop|2018|p=115}} [[David Toop]] commented that "at its heights, Perry's genius has transformed the recording studio" into "virtual space, an imaginary chamber over which presided the electronic wizard, evangelist, gossip columnist and Dr. Frankenstein that he became."{{sfn|Toop|2018|pp=114—115}}

* From the late 1970s onward, [[hip hop production]] has been strongly linked to the lineage and technique of earlier artists who used the studio as an instrument. Jazz critic [[Francis Davis]] identified early hip-hop [[Disc jockey|DJs]], including [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[Grandmaster Flash]], as "grassroots successors to Phil Spector, Brian Wilson, and George Martin, the 1960s producers who pioneered the use of the recording studio as an instrument in its own right."{{sfn|Davis|2004|p=259}}

[[File:MBV 2008.jpg|thumb|[[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]] performing in 2008]]

* Beginning in the 1980s, musicians associated with the genres [[dream pop]] and [[shoegazing]] made innovative use of [[effects pedal]]s and recording techniques to create ethereal, "dreamy" musical atmospheres.{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=1205}} The English-Irish shoegazing band [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]], helmed by guitarist-producer [[Kevin Shields]], are often celebrated for their studio albums ''[[Isn't Anything]]'' (1988) and ''[[Loveless (My Bloody Valentine album)|Loveless]]'' (1991). Writing for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', [[Paul Lester]] said Shields is "widely accepted as shoegazing's genius", with "his astonishing wall of sound, use of the studio as instrument and dazzling reinvention of the guitar making him a sort of hydra-headed Spector-[[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]]-Eno figure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lester|first1=Paul|author-link=Paul Lester|title=Sonic Cathedral spark shoegazing music revival|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6066716.ece|website=[[The Times|Times Online]]|date=April 12, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919185133/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6066716.ece|archive-date=September 19, 2009|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The original Redowa waltz (NYPL b19606977-5096616).jpg|"The original Redowa waltz", by Jullien|thumb]]
A '''redowa''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|d|ə|w|ə|,_|-|v|ə}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Redowa|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/redowa|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a dance of [[Culture of the Czech Republic|Czech]] origin with turning, leaping [[waltz]] steps that was most popular in [[Victorian era]] [[Europe]]an [[ballroom]]s.

==History==
The name comes from the Czech name '''rejdovák''', derived from ''rej'' ("whirl").{{dubious|date=August 2016}}&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Redowa|author=John Tirrell|access-date=August 30, 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt; Originally a folk dance, it first appeared into the salons in Prague in 1829 and fell out of fashion by 1840, though in the meantime it had spread beyond Bohemia.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt;

Thomas Hillgrove&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/musdibib:@field(NUMBER+@band(musdi+094)) Thomas Hillgrove, An American Ballroom Companion: Dance Instruction Manuals]&lt;/ref&gt; states that the redowa was introduced to London ballrooms in 1846.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/musdi:@field(DOCID+@lit(M094131)) Thomas Hillgrove: An American Ballroom Companion: Dance Instruction Manuals]&lt;/ref&gt; Like other popular [[ballroom]] dances of the mid-nineteenth century, including the [[polka]], it was danced in Paris prior to its appearance in London.

==Meter==
Like most dances currently described as waltzes, the redowa is danced in {{music|time|3|4}} [[Time signature|time]], with the couple performing a full rotation every six [[beat (music)|beat]]s.

==Description==
A basic redowa step contains one long reaching step and two small leap-steps. The long reaching step can be danced on either the 1 or the 2 of each bar of [[music]], depending on what feels best with the tune that is playing.

Cellarius (1849)&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/musdi:@field(DOCID+@lit(M03826)) (section in French) An American Ballroom Companion: Dance Instruction Manuals]&lt;/ref&gt; describes a three-part redowa consisting of a pursuit part (''"la poursuite"''), followed by the style of [[waltz]] commonly described as the redowa, and ending with a particular type of [[valse à deux temps]]. During the "pursuit" the partners hold each other hands facing each other and moving up and down at will and doing the "balance" forward and back, with lady following the cavalier.

===The lead===
Dancers generally start in [[Closed position|closed (waltz) position]] with the outside hands pointing line of direction. (This description is for the case when the "reach" step is on count two.)  To begin a redowa, the leader will take a small leap step (count 1) around in front of his/her partner with the left foot so that the leader is backing, then take a long scooping or gliding step (count 2) straight back with the right (pointing right toe, bending the knee of the left leg, keeping the torso upright), followed by another small leap step (count 3) with the left to complete a 180-degree turn clockwise.  The second half of the six-count pattern begins with a small leaping step (count 4) along the line of dance, so the leader faces forward on the line of dance. The left leg now reaches straight forward (count 5; pointing left toe, bending right knee, etc.), directly under the partner's right leg, which is extended back.  A small leap (count 6) onto the right foot completes the pattern, completing the second half (180 degree) turn in preparation for the next six count pattern.

===The follow===
The follow is the opposite portion of the lead's sequence. The follower's movement on the first three beats are essentially the same movements the leader makes on the second set of three beats, and vice versa.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Robopanda.jpg|thumb|right|256px|Robopanda]] --&gt;
'''Robopanda''' is a [[robotic]] interactive companion produced by [[Wow Wee|WowWee]]. The Robopanda uses interchangeable [[Cartridge (electronics)|cartridges]] that contain personalities, stories and songs, and is controlled directly by touch and sound sensors. Robopanda is labeled for use by children ages 9 and up.

== Hardware ==

*8 motors
*Sound [[sensor]]
*[[Touch switch|Capacitive touch sensors]]
*Tilt sensor
*Safety/pinch sensors
*Minipanda accessory with [[RFID]] tag
*Two cartridges

The Robopanda is animated by 8 motors, controlling its arms, legs, head tilt, head rotate, eyebrows and ears. Touch sensors are located in hands, feet,head, belly and back. A tilt sensor is used to sense when Robopanda is lying down, leaning, or being carried. An RFID sensor in the belly is used to detect the presence of the minipanda accessory. Safety/pinch sensors in the armpits and back of neck will inhibit motion if triggered. Robopanda requires 6 x C and 4 x AA size batteries.

== Modes ==

Robopanda operates in three different modes controlled by a 3 way power switch: Training mode, Friend mode, or Menu mode. After 4 minutes without touch input, Robopanda will enter Sleep mode. The power/mode switch must be manually turned off and on again to exit Sleep mode. In Training mode, Robopanda will explain his various functions and sensors. Volume may also be adjusted while in Training mode by moving an arm (volume up) or leg (volume down). In Friend mode, Robopanda will converse, tell jokes and ask for touch stimulation. Robopanda will also recognize the minipanda accessory (with embedded [[RFID]]) when in Friend mode. Menu mode is broken down into 3 'settings' that are accessed by the touch sensors: touching a foot enters Free Roam setting; touching the belly enters the Games setting; touching a hand enters the Tricks setting; and touching a head sensor enters the Song/Story setting. The back touch sensor is used to return to the main menu of Menu mode.

== Programming ==
Robopanda can be '[[Computer program|programmed]]' by moving its arms and legs while in the Tricks setting of Training mode. Robopanda will then play back the sequence of movements; this is similar to the Puppet mode in other WowWee robots such as [[Robosapien v2]]. The program memory holds a limited number of movements, and the sequence of moves is retained in the cartridge only while it is inserted in Robopanda. The behavior of Robopanda can be changed by inserting a different personality cartridge.

Film director [[Stanley Kubrick]] worked on numerous film projects that were never completed.

==''The Burning Secret'' and ''Natural Child''==
In 1956, after the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (M.G.M.) studio turned down a request from Kubrick and his producer partner [[James B. Harris]] to film ''Paths of Glory'', MGM then invited Kubrick to review the studio's other properties. Harris and Kubrick discovered [[Stefan Zweig]]'s novel ''The Burning Secret'', in which a young baron attempts to seduce a young Jewish woman by first befriending her twelve-year-old son, who eventually realizes the actual motives of the baron. Kubrick was enthusiastic about the novel and hired novelist [[Calder Willingham]] to write a screenplay; however, [[Production Code]] restrictions hindered the realization of the project.&lt;ref name="Cocks2004_151"&gt;[[#Cocks2004|Cocks 2004, p. 151.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The script, once thought to be lost, was found in 2018 and is nearly completed to be developed by film-makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/15/stanley-kubrick-lost-screenplay-burning-secret-found|title=Lost Stanley Kubrick screenplay, Burning Secret, is found 60 years on|work=theguardian|last=Alberge|first=Dalya|accessdate=July 15, 2018|date=July 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick had previously expressed interest in adapting a Willingham novel ''Natural Child'', but was also prevented by the Production Code on that occasion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cocks2004|Cocks 2004, p. 149.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Napoleon''==
{{commons category|Napoleon (Stanley Kubrick's unrealized film)}}
After the success of ''2001'', Kubrick planned a large-scale [[biographical film]] about [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]].&lt;ref name="Mason2000"&gt;{{cite web|title=The greatest movie Stanley Kubrick never made|url=http://www.salon.com/2000/10/04/napoleon/|work=Salon|publisher=Salon Media Group, Inc|accessdate=26 March 2013|author=Darryl Mason|date=5 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He "tried to see every film that was ever made on the subject," including [[Abel Gance]]'s ''[[Napoléon (1927 film)|Napoléon]]'' and the Soviet film series ''[[War and Peace (film series)|War and Peace]]'', neither of which he liked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Film Director as Superstar | author-first= Joseph | author-last= Gelmis | year= 1970 |publisher= [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |location=Garden City, New York|page= 298}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He also conducted research, read books about the French emperor, and wrote a preliminary screenplay which has since become available on the internet. With the help of assistants, he meticulously created a card catalog of the places and deeds of Napoleon's inner circle during its operative years. Kubrick scouted locations, planning to film large portions of the film on location in France, in addition to the use of United Kingdom studios. The director was also going to film the battle scenes in Romania and had enlisted the support of the [[Romanian army]]; senior army officers had committed 40,000 soldiers and 10,000 cavalrymen to Kubrick's film for the paper costume battle scenes.

In a conversation with the [[British Film Institute]], Kubrick's brother-in-law [[Jan Harlan]] stated the film was set to enter production with [[David Hemmings]] as the title figure Napoleon (later, that role went to [[Jack Nicholson]]) and [[Audrey Hepburn]] as Kubrick's preference for the character [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Josephine]]. In notes that Kubrick wrote to his financial backers, preserved in the book ''The Kubrick Archives'', Kubrick expresses uncertainty in regard to the progress of the Napoleon film and the final product; however, he also states that he expected to create "the best movie ever made."&lt;ref name="Castle2009"&gt;[[#Castle2009|Castle 2009.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Napoleon'' was eventually canceled due to the prohibitive cost of location filming, the [[Western world|Western]] release of [[Sergei Bondarchuk]]'s epic film version of [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s novel ''[[War and Peace (film series)|War and Peace]]'' (1968), and the commercial failure of Bondarchuk's Napoleon-themed film ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]'' (1970). A significant portion of Kubrick's historical research would influence ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' (1975), the storyline of which ends in 1789, approximately fifteen years prior to the commencement of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

In March 2013 [[Steven Spielberg]] announced his intention to create, in conjunction with Kubrick's family, a television miniseries based on Kubrick's screenplay.&lt;ref name="BBCSpielberg"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21652878 |title=Spielberg to develop Kubrick's Napoleon for TV |accessdate=2013-03-03|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, [[HBO]] announced that they will produce a miniseries based on Kubrick's screenplay with [[Cary Fukunaga]] as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Romano|first1=Nick|title=Is Stanley Kubrick’s Legendary ‘Napoleon’ Headed to HBO with Cary Fukunaga Directing?|url=http://collider.com/stanley-kubrick-napoleon-hbo-cary-fukunaga/|website=Deadline.com|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, French opera singer and actor [[David Serero (opera singer)|David Serero]] adapted the screenplay for the stage, in New York, in which he stars as Napoleon.&lt;ref name=BWW&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/NAPOLEON-By-Stanley-Kubrick-To-Be-Presented-For-The-First-Time-On-Stage-20180802|title=NAPOLEON By Stanley Kubrick To Be Presented For The First Time On Stage|first=BWW News|last=Desk|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc-2.com/story/38823780/david-serero-to-star-as-napoleons-title-role-in-napoleon-by-stanley-kubrick-the-greatest-movie-never-made-in-a-world-premiere-staged-adaptation|title=David Serero to star as Napoleon's title role in|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiere.fr/Cinema/News-Cinema/Le-Napoleon-de-Stanley-Kubrick-arrive-enfin--au-theatre|title=Le Napoléon de Stanley Kubrick arrive enfin … au théâtre|date=13 August 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was scheduled to open August 23.&lt;ref name=BWW/&gt;

==''Aryan Papers''==
In 1976, Kubrick sought out a film idea that concerned the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] and tried to persuade [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]] to contribute an original screenplay. Kubrick requested a "dramatic structure that compressed the complex and vast information into the story of an individual who represented the essence of this man-made hell." However, Singer declined, explaining to Kubrick, "I don't know the first thing about the Holocaust."&lt;ref name="CocksEtAl2006_196"&gt;[[#CocksEtAl2006|Cocks et al 2006, p. 196.]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cocks2004"&gt;[[#Cocks2004|Cocks 2004.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, Kubrick nearly entered the production stage of a film adaptation of [[Louis Begley]]'s ''[[Wartime Lies]]'', the story of a boy and his aunt as they are in-hiding from the Nazi regime during the Holocaust—the first-draft screenplay, entitled ''Aryan Papers'', was penned by Kubrick himself. ''Full Metal Jacket'' co-screenwriter [[Michael Herr]] reports that Kubrick had considered casting [[Julia Roberts]] or [[Uma Thurman]] as the aunt; eventually, [[Johanna ter Steege]] was cast as the aunt and [[Joseph Mazzello]] as the young boy. Kubrick traveled to the Czech city of [[Brno]], as it was envisaged as a possible filming location for the scenes of [[Warsaw]] during wartime, and cinematographer Elemér Ragályi was selected by Kubrick to be the director of photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scarlett Johansson feltűnően butuska kislány volt|url=http://www.origo.hu/filmklub/blog/interju/exkluziv/20120424-interju-ragalyi-elemer-operatorrel-az-ajto-szabo-istvan-scarlett-johansson.html|work=[origo] filmklub|publisher=Minden jog fenntartva|accessdate=26 March 2013|author=Gyárfás Dóra|language=Hungarian|date=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubrick's work on ''Aryan Papers'' eventually ceased in 1995, as the director was influenced by the 1993 release of Spielberg's Holocaust-themed film ''[[Schindler's List]]''. According to Kubrick's wife Christiane an additional factor in Kubrick's decision was the increasingly depressing nature of the subject as experienced by the director. Kubrick eventually concluded that an accurate Holocaust film was beyond the capacity of cinema and returned his attention to the ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'' film project.&lt;ref name="Caldwell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/19/wolf-door-kubrick.html |last1=Cocks |first1=Geoffrey |title=(Review of) The wolf at the door: Stanley Kubrick, history &amp; the Holocaust (review) |date=2 March 2006 |work=Screening the past |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117232805/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/19/wolf-door-kubrick.html |accessdate=20 November 2014 |deadurl=unfit |archivedate=January 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Shadow on the Sun''==
In the early [[1960s in film|1960s]], Kubrick, a keen listener of [[BBC Radio]], heard the [[Radio drama|radio serial drama]] ''Shadow on the Sun''; written by Gavin Blakeney, ''Shadow on the Sun'' is a work of science fiction in which a virus is introduced to earth through a meteorite landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dear weekend Over to you|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2004/apr/03/weekend7.weekend1|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 April 2004|author=Madeline Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianRonson2004&gt;{{cite news|title=Citizen Kubrick|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/mar/27/features.weekend|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 March 2004|author=Jon Ronson}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when Kubrick was looking for a new project, the director became reacquainted with ''Shadow on the Sun''. Kubrick purchased screen rights from Blakeney in [[1988 in film|1988]] for [[£]]1,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dear weekend Over to you|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2004/apr/03/weekend7.weekend1|accessdate=7 April 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 April 2004|author=Madeline Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereon, Kubrick read and annotated a script before moving onto ''A.I. Artificial Intelligence''.&lt;ref name=GuardianRonson2004 /&gt; The tone of the unrealized project, as described by [[Anthony Frewin]] in ''The Kubrick Archives'', is a cross between ''[[War of the Worlds]]'' and ''[[Mars Attacks!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Castle, Alison, ed.2008|Castle, Alison, ed., pp. 517]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Lunatic at Large''==
On November 1, 2006, Kubrick's [[son-in-law]] Philip Hobbs announced that he would be shepherding a film treatment of ''Lunatic at Large''. Kubrick had commissioned the project for treatment from noir [[Pulp magazine|pulp]] novelist [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]] in the 1950s, but it had been lost until Hobbs uncovered a manuscript following Kubrick's death.&lt;ref name="IMDBLunatic"&gt;{{cite web|title=New "Kubrick Film" To Be Made|url=http://imdb.com/news/sb/2006-10-31/#4|work=IMDb|publisher=IMDb.com, Inc|accessdate=26 March 2013|date=31 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2011, this project is in development for future release, with the involvement of actors [[Scarlett Johansson]] and [[Sam Rockwell]], and U.K. screenwriter Stephen R. Clarke.&lt;ref name="Kevin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Financing Nears On 'Lunatic At Large'; 2 More Unmade Kubrick Projects Continue Toward Production|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/financing_nears_on_lunatic_at_large_2_more_unmade_kubrick_projects_continue|work=indiewire|publisher=A SnagFilms Co|accessdate=26 March 2013|author=Kevin Jagernauth|date=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unreleased screenplays==
A number of screenplays that were written by Kubrick, who was either hired on a commission basis or was writing for his own projects, remain unreleased. One such screenplay is ''The German Lieutenant'' (co-written with Richard Adams), in which a group of German soldiers embark upon a mission during the final days of [[World War II]];&lt;ref name="Chiaventone"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Untitled Deadpool Column|url=http://www.tnmc.org/dp/0122031.shtml|work=TNMC|publisher=TNMC|accessdate=26 March 2013|author=Frederick J. Chiaventone |author2=Jean-François Allaire}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the time period when ''The German Lieutenant'' was planned as Kubrick's next production, the director explained his interest in making another war film:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
... one of the attractions of a war or crime story is that it provides an almost unique opportunity to contrast an individual of our contemporary society with a solid framework of accepted value, which the audience becomes fully aware of, and which can be used as a counterpoint to a human, individual, emotional situation. Further, war acts as a kind of hothouse for forced, quick breeding of attitudes and feelings. Attitudes crystallize and come out into the open.&lt;ref name="Kubrick2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley Kubrick|title=Stanley Kubrick: Interviews|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iOU9bIlnPHIC&amp;pg=PA6|accessdate=26 March 2013|year=2001|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-57806-297-3|pages=6–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other examples of unreleased Kubrick screenplays are ''I Stole 16 Million Dollars,'' a fictionalized account of early 20th century Baptist minister turned safecracker Herbert Emmerson Wilson (the film was to be produced by [[Kirk Douglas]]' company "Bryna", despite Douglas' belief that the script was poorly written, and [[Cary Grant]] was approached for the lead role);&lt;ref name="IndieWire-Mar2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/the-lost-unmade-projects-of-stanley-kubrick-20130304?page=5 |title=The Lost &amp; Unmade Projects Of Stanley Kubrick |last1=Jagernauth |first1=Kevin |date=March 4, 2013 |work=The Playlist |publisher=IndieWire |accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a first draft of a script about the [[John S. Mosby|Mosby Rangers]], a Confederate guerrilla force that was active during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Ciment1982Clockwork "&gt;[[#Ciment1982Clockwork|Ciment 1982.]] Online at: [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.aco.html Kubrick on A Clockwork Orange: An interview with Michel Ciment]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubrick was also interested in adapting to the screen ''[[Flowers in the Attic]]'' by [[V.C. Andrews]], but it was cancelled due for the explicit incestuous relationship between the two main characters.{{Citation needed|reason=No evidence to be found online, in print or on DVD supplemental features|date=September 2015}}

==Other projects==
[[Marlon Brando]] contacted Kubrick, asking him to direct a film adaptation of the Charles Neider western novel, ''The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones'', featuring [[Pat Garrett]] and [[Billy the Kid]].{{Sfn|Duncan|2003|p=50}}{{efn|This is disputed by Carlo Fiore, who has claimed that Brando had not heard of Kubrick initially and that it was he who arranged a dinner meeting between Brando and Kubrick.{{Sfn|Baxter|1997|pp=109–110}}}} Brando was impressed, saying that "Stanley is unusually perceptive, and delicately attuned to people. He has an adroit intellect, and is a creative thinker—not a repeater, not a fact-gatherer. He digests what he learns and brings to a new project an original point of view and a reserved passion".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=53}} The two worked on a script for six months, begun by a then unknown [[Sam Peckinpah]]. Many disputes broke out over the project, and in the end, Kubrick distanced himself from what would become ''[[One-Eyed Jacks]]'' (1961).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=John|title=Stanley Kubrick: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-h1QgAACAAJ|year=1997|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-00-638445-8|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|According to biographer John Baxter, Kubrick was furious with Brando's casting of [[France Nuyen]], and when Kubrick had confessed to still "not knowing what the picture was about", Brando snapped "I'll tell you what it's about. It's about $300,000 that I've already paid [[Karl Malden]]".{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=119}}}} Kubrick was then reported to have been fired and accepted a parting fee of $100,000,{{sfnm|1a1=Baxter|1y=1997|1p=120|2a1=Duncan|2y=2003|2p=53}} though a 1960 ''Entertainment Weekly'' article claims he quit as director, and that Kubrick had been quoted as saying "Brando wanted to direct the movie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ginna|first=Robert Emmett|title=The Odyssey Begins|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly|year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick's biographer LoBrutto states that for contractual reasons, Kubrick was not able to cite the real reason, but issued a statement saying that he had resigned "with deep regret because of my respect and admiration for one of the world's foremost artists".{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=164}}

Kubrick was offered to direct both ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973) and ''[[Exorcist II: The Heretic]]'' (1977), but declined, despite once saying in 1966 to a friend that he had long desired to "make the world's scariest movie, involving a series of episodes that would play upon the nightmare fears of the audience".{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=302}}

Kubrick was fascinated by the career of Nazi filmmaker [[Veit Harlan]], his wife's uncle, and contemplated creating a film of the social circle that surrounded [[Joseph Goebbels]]. Although Kubrick worked on this project for several years, the director was unable to progress beyond a rough story outline.&lt;ref name="Dupont2001"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kubrick Speaks, Through Family's Documentary|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/15/style/15iht-kubrick_ed2_.html|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=15 September 2001|author=Joan Dupont}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Umberto Eco]], in response to an offer from Kubrick regarding a film adaptation of Eco's 1988 novel ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]'', declined due to his dissatisfaction with the film adaptation of his earlier novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]''. Additionally, Eco sought the role of screenwriter but Kubrick was unwilling to cooperate. Following Kubrick's death, Eco stated that he regretted his initial decision.&lt;ref name="NaperstakEco2007"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Armani of literature|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/books/bliteratureb-umberto-eco-the-armani-of-literature/2007/12/13/1197135651584.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=15 December 2007|author=Ben Naparstek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the commencement of work for ''2001'', [[Terry Southern]] suggested the production of a high-budget pornographic film called ''Blue Movie'' to Kubrick; Southern proposed the film as an attempt to reinvent the genre. Kubrick decided against Southern's suggestion in the belief that he did not have the appropriate temperament for pornographic cinema; also, Kubrick did not think that he could sufficiently reinvent the genre to truly elevate it. At the same time, Southern had begun writing a novel, also entitled ''[[Blue Movie (novel)|Blue Movie]]'' (published in 1970), in which a highly regarded [[art film]] director named "Boris Adrian" attempts to create such a film—the book is dedicated to Kubrick.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baxter1997|Baxter 1997, pp. 194-195.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s sale of the film rights for ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' to [[United Artists]] in 1969, the [[rock music|rock]] band [[The Beatles]] considered a corresponding film project and approached Kubrick as a potential director; however, Kubrick turned down the offer, explaining to [[John Lennon]] that he thought the novel could not be adapted into a film due to its immensity.&lt;ref name="TolkienEncyl2006_15"&gt;[[#TolkienEncyl2006|Drout 2006, p. 15.]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also interview in "Show" magazine vol. 1, Number 1 1970&lt;/ref&gt; The eventual director of the film adaptation [[Peter Jackson]] further explained that a major hindrance to the project's progression was Tolkien's opposition to the involvement of the Beatles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2002-03-28/entertainment/rings.beatles_1_powerful-ring-gollum-beatles-plan?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ|title=Beatles plan for Rings film | work=CNN | date=2004-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubrick also considered adapting [[Patrick Süskind]]'s novel ''[[Perfume (novel)|Perfume]]'', which he had enjoyed; however, the idea was never acted upon.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baxter1997|Baxter 1997, pp. 332, 360.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was later adapted for the screen by [[Tom Tykwer]], as ''[[Perfume: The Story of a Murderer (film)|Perfume: The Story of a Murderer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perfume: The Story of a Murderer|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00qh059|work=BBC Two|publisher=BBC|accessdate=26 March 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubrick, searching for a project after ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'', considered adapting Robert Marshall's novel ''All the King's Men'', a dramatic account of a [[Secret Intelligence Service|British intelligence service]] operation during World War II.&lt;ref name="Webster2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Webster|title=Love and Death in Kubrick: A Critical Study of the Films from Lolita Through Eyes Wide Shut|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bz_x37RSSqIC&amp;pg=PA245|accessdate=26 March 2013|year=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-6191-2|pages=245–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marshall2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Marshall|title=All the King’s Men|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7uTApfawgd8C|accessdate=26 March 2013|date=7 November 2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4482-1056-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While working with [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]] on the story for ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'', Kubrick asked Watson for a pre-print copy of his ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' tie-in novel ''[[Inquisition (Warhammer 40,000)|Inquisitor]]''. Watson quotes Kubrick as saying, "Who knows, Ian? Maybe this is my next movie?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plumbing Stanley Kubrick|url=http://www.ianwatson.info/plumbing-stanley-kubrick/|accessdate=26 September 2014|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a 2010 announcement about the development of the ''Lunatic at Large'' project, plans for the prospective production of two other unrealized Kubrick projects were also announced.&lt;ref name="Kevin" /&gt; As of August 2012, ''Downslope'' and ''God Fearing Man'' were in development by Philip Hobbs and producer Steve Lanning, in partnership with independent company Entertainment One (eOne). A press release described ''Downslope'' as an "epic Civil War drama", while ''God Fearing Man'' is the "true story of Canadian minister Herbert Emerson Wilson."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=eOne to Develop TV Projects DOWNSLOPE and GOD FEARING MAN Based on Screenplays by Stanley Kubrick|url=http://collider.com/stanley-kubrick-tv-downslope-god-fearing-man/|work=Collider.com|publisher=IndieClick Film Network|accessdate=26 March 2013|author=Matt Goldberg|date=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 2013, Anthony Frewin, Kubrick's assistant for many years, wrote in an article in ''[[The Atlantic]]'': "He [Kubrick] was limitlessly interested in anything to do with Nazis and desperately wanted to make a film on the subject." The article included information on another Kubrick [[World War II]] film that was never realized, based on the life story of Dietrich Schulz-Koehn, a Nazi officer who used the pen name "Dr. Jazz" to write reviews of German music scenes during the Nazi era. Kubrick had been given a copy of the [[Mike Zwerin]] book ''Swing Under the Nazis'' (the front cover of which featured a photograph of Schulz-Koehn) after he had finished production on ''Full Metal Jacket.'' However, a screenplay was never completed and Kubrick's film adaptation plan was never initiated (the unfinished ''Aryan Papers'' was a factor in the abandonment of the project).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanley Kubrick's Unmade Film About Jazz in the Third Reich|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/03/stanley-kubricks-unmade-film-about-jazz-in-the-third-reich/274225/|work=The Atlantic|publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group|accessdate=26 March 2013|author=James Hughes|date=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In between ''Eyes Wide Shut'' and ''A.I.'', Kubrick was interested in making a film, for children and young adults, based on [[H. Rider Haggard]]'s [[viking]] epic novel, ''[[Eric Brighteyes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx49KEJxUF0|title=The Stanley Kubrick Archive Oral History Project: Finding and Developing the Story|first=|last=SandpailMedia|date=25 April 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, long-time assistant of Kubrick's, Emilio D'Alessandro addressed that prior to his death, Kubrick was considering making a movie of [[Pinocchio]]. D'Alessandro said that Kubrick sent him to buy Italian books about Pinocchio. "He wanted to make it in his own because so many ''Pinocchios'' have been made. He wanted to do something really big… He said; 'It would [be] very nice if I could make children laugh and feel happy making this Pinocchio.'" (Kubrick eventually used [[A.I. Artificial Intelligence|the project based on Brian Aldiss short story]] as his "Pinocchio film.") D'Alessandro also stated that Kubrick's life-long fascination in World War II led to an interest in [[Battle of Monte Cassino|The Battle of Monte Cassino]]. D'Alessandro said, "Stanley said that would be an interesting film to make. He asked me to get hold of things … like newspaper cuttings and find out the distance from the airport, train stations. He had a friend who actually bombarded Monte Cassino during the war … It is horrible to remember those days. Everything was completely destroyed.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murthi|first1=Vikram|title=Stanley Kubrick Was Preparing To Remake "Pinocchio" Before His Death|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/06/stanley-kubrick-pinocchio-remake-film-before-death-1201682889/|website=IndieWire|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alberge|first1=Dalya|title=Stanley Kubrick was planning children's film before his death|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/30/stanley-kubrick-childrens-film-death-pinocchio-eyes-wide-shut-spartacus|website=The Guardian|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carsoundstereoshift.png|Time difference in a stereophonic recording of a car going past.|thumb|250px]]
'''Stereophonic sound''' or, more commonly, '''stereo''', is a method of sound reproduction that creates an illusion of multi-directional audible perspective. This is usually achieved by using two or more independent [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] channels through a configuration of two or more [[loudspeaker]]s (or stereo [[headphones]]) in such a way as to create the impression of sound heard from various directions, as in natural hearing.&lt;ref&gt;stereo. (n.d.). © Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.. Retrieved March 10, 2012, from Dictionary.com website: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stereo&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the term "stereophonic" applies to so-called "[[quadraphonic]]" and "[[surround sound|surround-sound]]" systems as well as the more common two-channel, two-speaker systems. It is often contrasted with [[monaural|monophonic]], or "mono" sound, where audio is heard as coming from one position, often ahead in the sound field (analogous to a [[visual field]]). In the 2000s, stereo sound is common in entertainment systems such as broadcast radio, TV, recorded music, and cinema.

==Etymology==
The word ''stereophonic'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|{{linktext|στερεός}}}} (''stereós'', "firm, solid")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dstereo%2Fs στερεός],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; + {{lang|el|{{linktext|φωνή}}}} (''phōnḗ'', "sound, tone, voice")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfwnh%2F φωνή], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; and it was coined in 1927 by [[Western Electric]], by analogy with the word "[[stereoscopic]]".

==Description==
Stereo sound systems can be divided into two forms: the first is "true" or "natural" stereo in which a live sound is captured, with any natural reverberation or ambience present, by an array of [[microphone]]s. The signal is then reproduced over multiple loudspeakers to recreate, as closely as possible, the live sound.

Secondly "artificial" or "pan-pot" stereo, in which a single-channel (mono) sound is reproduced over multiple loudspeakers. By varying the relative amplitude of the signal sent to each speaker an artificial direction (relative to the listener) can be suggested. The control which is used to vary this relative amplitude of the signal is known as a "pan-pot" (panoramic potentiometer). By combining multiple "pan-potted" mono signals together, a complete, yet entirely artificial, sound field can be created.

In technical usage, '''true stereo''' means sound recording and sound reproduction that uses [[stereographic projection]] to encode the relative positions of objects and events recorded.

During two-channel stereo recording, two [[microphones]] are placed in strategically chosen locations relative to the sound source, with both recording simultaneously. The two recorded channels will be similar, but each will have distinct time-of-arrival and sound-pressure-level information. During playback, the listener's brain uses those subtle differences in timing and sound level to [[triangulation|triangulate]] the positions of the recorded objects. Stereo recordings often cannot be played on monaural systems without a significant loss of [[High fidelity|fidelity]]. Since each microphone records each [[wavefront]] at a slightly different time, the wavefronts are out of [[Phase (waves)|phase]]; as a result, constructive and destructive [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] can occur if both tracks are played back on the same speaker. This [[Physical phenomenon|phenomenon]] is known as [[phase cancellation]].

==History==
[[File:Theatrophone - Clement Ader 1881.JPG|thumb|left|Diagram of Clément Ader's [[théatrophone]] prototype at the Opera during the World Exhibition in Paris (1881).]]
===Early work===
[[Clément Ader]] demonstrated the first two-channel audio system in Paris in 1881, with a series of telephone transmitters connected from the stage of the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opera]] to a suite of rooms at the Paris Electrical Exhibition, where listeners could hear a live transmission of performances through receivers for each ear. ''[[Scientific American]]'' reported:
:"Every one who has been fortunate enough to hear the telephones at the Palais de l'Industrie has remarked that, in listening with both ears at the two telephones, the sound takes a special character of relief and localization which a single receiver cannot produce.... This phenomenon is very curious, it approximates to the theory of binauricular audition, and has never been applied, we believe, before to produce this remarkable illusion to which may almost be given the name of auditive perspective."&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015024538491;view=1up;seq=428 "The Telephone at the Paris Opera"], ''Scientific American'', December 31, 1881, pages 422–23.&lt;/ref&gt;
This two-channel telephonic process was commercialized in France from 1890 to 1932 as the [[Théâtrophone]], and in England from 1895 to 1925 as the [[Electrophone (information system)|Electrophone]]. Both were services available by coin-operated receivers at hotels and cafés, or by subscription to private homes.&lt;ref&gt;"Court Circular", ''The Times'' (London), Nov. 6, 1895, p. 7. "Post Office Electrical Engineers. The Electrophone Service", ''The Times'' (London), Jan. 15, 1913, p. 24. "Wired Wireless", ''The Times'' (London), June 22, 1925, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern stereophonic sound===
Modern stereophonic technology was invented in the 1930s by British engineer [[Alan Blumlein]] at [[EMI]], who patented stereo records, stereo films, and also surround sound.&lt;ref name="Blumlein"&gt;{{cite news|title=Early stereo recordings restored|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7537782.stm|quote=Blumlein lodged the patent for 'binaural sound', in 1931, in a paper which patented stereo records, stereo films and also surround sound. He and his colleagues then made a series of experimental recordings and films to demonstrate the technology, and see if there was any commercial interest from the fledgling film and audio industry.|work=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2008-08-07|date=2008-08-01|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807025132/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7537782.stm|archivedate=August 7, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1931, Blumlein and his wife were at a local cinema. The sound reproduction systems of the early "talkies" invariably only had a single set of speakers - which could lead to the somewhat disconcerting effect of the actor being on one side of the screen whilst his voice appeared to come from the other. Blumlein declared to his wife that he had found a way to make the sound follow the actor across the screen.

The genesis of these ideas is uncertain, but he explained them to [[Isaac Shoenberg]] in the late summer of 1931. His earliest notes on the subject are dated 25 September 1931, and his patent had the title "Improvements in and relating to Sound-transmission, Sound-recording and Sound-reproducing Systems". The application was dated 14 December 1931, and was accepted on 14 June 1933 as [[United Kingdom|UK]] patent number 394,325.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent | country=GB|number=394325|title=Improvements in and relating to Sound-transmission, Sound-recording and Sound-reproducing Systems.|status=patent|gdate=1933-06-14|fdate=1931-12-14|pridate=1932-11-10|inventor=Alan Dower Blumlein|invent1=Blumlein, Alan Dower|assign1=Alan Dower Blumlein|assign2=Musical Industries, Limited|class=H04R1/40B; H04R11/12; H04R9/16; H04S1/00}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The patent covered many ideas in stereo, some of which are used today and some not. Some 70 claims include:

* A "shuffling" circuit, which aimed to preserve the directional effect when sound from a spaced pair of microphones was reproduced via stereo headphones instead of a pair of loudspeakers;
* The use of a coincident pair of velocity microphones with their axes at right angles to each other, which is still known as a "[[Blumlein Pair]]";
* Recording two channels in the single groove of a record using the two groove walls at right angles to each other and 45 degrees to the vertical;
* A stereo disc-cutting head;
* Using hybrid transformers to matrix between left and right signals and sum and difference signals;

Blumlein began binaural experiments as early as 1933, and the first stereo discs were cut later the same year, twenty-five years before that method became the standard for stereo phonograph discs. These discs used the two walls of the groove at right angles in order to carry the two channels.

Much of the development work on this system for cinematic use did not reach completion until 1935. In Blumlein's short test films (most notably, "Trains at Hayes Station", which lasts 5 minutes 11 seconds, and, "The Walking &amp; Talking Film"), his original intent of having the sound follow the actor was fully realised.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Alexander (2013). "The Inventor of Stereo: The Life and Works of Alan Dower Blumlein". p. 83. CRC Press,&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Blumlein recorded [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Jupiter Symphony]]'' conducted by Sir [[Thomas Beecham]] at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London using his vertical-lateral technique.&lt;ref name="Blumlein"/&gt;

In the United States, [[Harvey Fletcher]] of [[Bell Laboratories]] was also investigating techniques for stereophonic recording and reproduction. One of the techniques investigated was the "wall of sound", which used an enormous array of microphones hung in a line across the front of an orchestra. Up to 80 microphones were used, and each fed a corresponding loudspeaker, placed in an identical position, in a separate listening room. Several stereophonic test recordings, using two microphones connected to two styli cutting two separate grooves on the same wax disc, were made with [[Leopold Stokowski]] and the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] at Philadelphia's [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]] in March 1932. The first (made on March 12, 1932), of [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin's]] ''[[Prometheus: Poem of Fire]]'', is the earliest known surviving intentional stereo recording.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Barry ). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Vb5Mz6DmutYC&amp;lpg=PA910&amp;dq=stokowski%20bell%20keller&amp;pg=PA908#v=onepage&amp;q=stokowski&amp;f=false "A hundred years of stereo: fifty of hi-fi"], p 911. Scientific American, December 24–31, 1981. Retrieved March 1, 2012. The performance was part of an all Russian program including [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' in the [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]] orchestration, excerpts of which were also recorded in stereo. See: [http://www.stokowski.org/Harvey%20Fletcher%20Bell%20Labs%20Recordings.htm Stokowski, Harvey Fletcher, and the Bell Labs Experimental Recordings], stokowski.org, rccessed  March 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell Laboratories gave a demonstration of three-channel stereophonic sound on April 27, 1933, with a live transmission of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] from [[Philadelphia]] to [[Constitution Hall]] in Washington, D.C. over multiple Class A telephone lines. [[Leopold Stokowski]], normally the orchestra's conductor, was present in Constitution Hall to control the sound mix. Five years later, the same system would be expanded onto multi-channel film recording and used from the concert hall in Philadelphia to the recording labs at Bell Labs in New Jersey in order to record [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940) in what Disney called [[Fantasound]].
[[File:Bell telephone magazine (1922) (14569926537).jpg|thumb|Bell Labs demonstration of stereo at World's Fair]]

Later that same year, Bell Labs also demonstrated binaural sound, at the [[Century of Progress|Chicago World's Fair]] in 1933 using a dummy with microphones instead of ears, .&lt;ref&gt;B.B. Bauer, "Some Techniques Toward Better Stereophonic Perspective", ''IEEE Transactions on Audio'', May–June 1963, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The two [[Signal (electronics)|signal]]s were sent out over separate [[amplitude modulation|AM]] station bands.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=yS0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA104 Radio Adds Third Dimension]", ''Popular Science'', Jan. 1953, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carnegie Hall demonstration===
Utilizing selections recorded by the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], under the direction of [[Leopold Stokowski]], intended for but not used in Walt Disney's ''Fantasia'', the [[Carnegie Hall]] demonstration by [[Bell Laboratories]] on April 9 and 10, 1940, used three huge speaker systems. Synchronization was achieved by making the recordings in the form of three motion picture soundtracks recorded on a single piece of film with a fourth track being used to regulate volume expansion.

This was necessary due to the limitations of dynamic range on optical motion picture film of the period, however the volume compression and expansion were not fully automatic, but were designed to allow manual studio "enhancement"; i.e., the artistic adjustment of overall volume and the relative volume of each track in relation to the others. Stokowski, who was always interested in sound reproduction technology personally participated in the "enhancement" of the sound at the demonstration.

The speakers produced sound levels of up to 100 decibels, and the demonstration held the audience "spellbound, and at times not a little terrified", according to one report.&lt;ref&gt;"Sound Waves 'Rock' Carnegie Hall as 'Enhanced Music' is Played", ''The New York Times'', April 10, 1940, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], who was present at the demonstration, commented that it was "marvellous" but "somehow unmusical because of the loudness." "Take that ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]''", he said. "I didn't know what it was until they got well into the piece. Too much 'enhancing', too much Stokowski."

===Motion picture era===
In 1937, [[Bell Laboratories]] in New York City gave a demonstration of two-channel stereophonic motion pictures, developed by Bell Labs and Electrical Research Products, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;"New Sound Effects Achieved in Film", ''The New York Times'', Oct. 12, 1937, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, conductor [[Leopold Stokowski]] was on hand to try out the new technology, recording onto a special proprietary nine-track sound system at the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]] in [[Philadelphia]], during the making of the movie ''[[One Hundred Men and a Girl]]'' for [[Universal Pictures]] in 1937, after which the tracks were mixed down to one for the final soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson B. Bell, "Rapid Strides are Being Made in Development of Sound Track", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', April 11, 1937, p. TR1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Motion Picture Herald'', September 11, 1937, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] started using three tracks instead of one to record the musical selections of movie soundtracks, and very quickly upgraded to four. One track was used for dialogue, two for music, and one for sound effects. The purpose for this form of multitrack recording was to make mixing down to a single optical track easier and was not intended to be a recording for stereophonic purposes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The very first two-track recording MGM made (although released in mono) was "It Never Rains But What It Pours" by [[Judy Garland]], recorded on June 21, 1938, for the movie ''Love Finds Andy Hardy''.

===Fantasound===
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Bill garity disney.jpg|thumb|left|The chief sound engineer, [[William Garity]], for [[Disney]]'s 1940 film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.]] --&gt;
[[Walt Disney]] began experimenting with multi-channel sound in the early 1930s as noted above.&lt;ref&gt;T. Holman, ''Surround Sound: Up and Running'', Second Edition, Elsevier, Focal Press (2008), 240 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercial motion picture to be exhibited with stereophonic sound was Walt Disney's ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', released in November 1940, for which a specialized sound process ([[Fantasound]]) was developed. As in the Carnegie Hall demonstrations six months earlier, Fantasound used a separate film containing four optical sound tracks. Three of the tracks were used to carry left, center and right audio, while the fourth track carried three tones which individually controlled the volume level of the other three.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew R. Boone, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=NicDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA65 Mickey Mouse Goes Classical]", ''[[Popular Science]]'', January 1941, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Fantasound" by W.E, Garity and J.N.A.Hawkins. Journal of the SMPE Vol 37 August 1941&lt;/ref&gt; The film was not a financial success, however, and after two months of road-show exhibition in selected cities, its soundtrack was remixed into mono sound for general release. It was not until its 1956 re-release that stereo sound was restored to the film. In the early 1940s, composer-conductor [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]] directed the construction of a sound stage equipped for multichannel recording for 20th Century Fox studios. Several soundtracks from this era still exist in their multichannel elements, some of which have been released on DVD, including ''[[How Green Was My Valley (film)|How Green Was My Valley]]'', ''[[Anna and the King of Siam (film)|Anna and the King of Siam]]'', ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951 film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' and ''[[Sun Valley Serenade]]'' which, along with ''Orchestra Wives'', feature the only stereophonic recordings of the [[Glenn Miller]] Orchestra as it was during its heyday of the [[Swing Era]].

===Cinerama===
Motion picture theatres, however, are where the real introduction of stereophonic sound to the public occurred. Amid great fanfare, Stereo sound was officially proven commercially viable for the public on September 30, 1952 with the release of a [[Cinerama]] demonstration film by [[Lowell Thomas]] and [[Mike Todd]] titled ''[[This is Cinerama]]''. The format was a spectacular widescreen process featuring three separate 35mm motion picture films (plus a separate sound film) running in synchronization with one another at 26 fps, adding one picture panel each to the viewer's left and right at 45 degree angles, in addition to the usual front and center panel, creating a truly immersive panoramic visual experience, comparable in some ways to today's curved screen [[IMAX|IMAX OMNI]].

Similarly, the [[Cinerama]] audio soundtrack technology, developed by [[Hazard E. Reeves]], a pioneer in magnetic recording, utilized seven discrete sound tracks on full-coat magnetic 35mm film, in order to envelop the theatregoer in an aural experience just as spectacular as that playing on the screen: five main channels behind the screen, two surround channels in the rear of the theater, plus a sync-track to interlock the 4 machines, which were specially outfitted with  aircraft servo-motors made by [[Ampex]].

The advent of multi-track magnetic tape and film recording made high fidelity synchronized multichannel recording more technically straightforward, though costly. By the early 1950s, all of the major studios were recording on 35mm magnetic film for mixing purposes, and many of these so-called individual angles still survive, allowing for soundtracks to be remixed into Stereo or even Surround.

In April 1953, while ''This is Cinerama'' was still playing only in New York City, most moviegoing audiences heard stereophonic sound for the first time with ''[[House of Wax (1953 film)|House of Wax]]'', an early [[3-D film]] starring [[Vincent Price]] and produced by Warner Bros. Unlike the 4-track mag release-print stereo films of the period which featured four thin strips of magnetic material running down the length of the film, inside and outside the sprocket holes, the sound system developed for ''House of Wax'', dubbed WarnerPhonic, was a combination of a 35&amp;nbsp;mm [[magnetic film|fully coated]] magnetic film  that contained the audio tracks for Left-Center-Right, interlocked with the two dual-strip [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] system projectors, one of which carried a mono optical surround track and one that carried a mono backup track, should anything go wrong.

Only two other films featured this strange hybrid WarnerPhonic sound: the 3-D production of ''The Charge at Feather River'', and ''Island in the Sky''. Unfortunately, as of 2012, the stereo magnetic tracks to both these films are considered lost forever. In addition, a large percentage of 3-D films carried variations on three-track magnetic sound: ''[[It Came from Outer Space]]''; ''I, the Jury''; ''The Stranger Wore a Gun''; ''Inferno''; ''[[Kiss Me, Kate (film)|Kiss Me, Kate]]''; and many others.

===Widescreen===
Inspired by [[Cinerama]], the movie industry moved quickly to create simpler and cheaper widescreen systems, the first of which, [[Todd-AO]], was developed by Broadway promoter Michael Todd with financial backing from Rodgers and Hammerstein, to use a single 70mm film running at 30 frames per second with 6 magnetic sound tracks, for their screen presentation of "Oklahoma!". Major Hollywood studios immediately rushed to create their own unique formats, such as [[Warner Bros.]] [[Panavision]], [[Paramount Pictures]]' [[VistaVision]] and [[Twentieth Century Fox|Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation]]'s [[CinemaScope]], the latter of which used up to four separate magnetic sound tracks.

VistaVision took a simplified, low-cost approach to stereophonic sound; its [[Perspecta]] system featured only a monaural track, but through subaudible tones, it could change the direction of the sound to come from the left, right or both directions at once.

Because of the standard 35&amp;nbsp;mm-size film, CinemaScope and its stereophonic sound was capable of being retrofitted into existing theaters. [[CinemaScope 55]] was created by the same company in order to use a larger form of the system (55&amp;nbsp;mm instead of 35&amp;nbsp;mm) to allow for greater image clarity onscreen, and was supposed to have had 6-track stereo instead of four. However, because the film needed a new, specially designed projector, the system proved impractical, and the two films made in the process, ''[[Carousel (film)|Carousel]]'' and ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'', were released in 35&amp;nbsp;mm CinemaScope reduction prints. To compensate, the premiere engagement of ''Carousel'' used a six-track magnetic full-coat in an interlock, and a 1961 re-release of ''The King and I'', featured the film "printed down" to [[70 mm]], used a six-track stereo soundtrack as well.

Eventually, 50 complete sets of combination 55/35&amp;nbsp;mm projectors and "penthouse" reproducers were completed and delivered by Century and Ampex, respectively, and 55&amp;nbsp;mm release print sounding equipment was delivered by Western Electric. Several samples of 55&amp;nbsp;mm sound prints can be found in the Sponable Collection at the Film and Television Archives at [[Columbia University]]. The subsequently abandoned 55/35&amp;nbsp;mm Century projector eventually became the Century JJ 70/35MM projector.

===[[Todd-AO]]===
After this disappointing experience with their proprietary "wide gauge" system, Fox purchased the Todd-AO system and re-engineered it into a more modern 24 fps system with brand-new 65MM self-blimped production cameras (Mitchell BFC ... "Blimped Fox Camera") and brand-new 65MM MOS cameras (Mitchell FC ... "Fox Camera") and brand-new Super Baltar lenses in a wide variety of focal lengths, first employed on [[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]]. Essentially, although Todd-AO was also available to others, the format became Fox's premier origination and presentation apparatus, replacing CinemaScope 55. Current DVDs of the two CinemaScope 55 feature titles were transferred from the original 55mm negatives, often including the separate 35MM films as extras for comparison.

===Back to mono===
However, beginning in 1957, films recorded in stereo (except for those shown in Cinerama or Todd-AO) carried an alternate mono track for theatres not ready or willing to re-equip for stereo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/wingcs5.htm |title=The CinemaScope Wing 5 |publisher=Widescreen Museum |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then until about 1975, when [[Dolby Stereo]] was used for the first time in films, most motion pictures—even some from which stereophonic soundtrack albums were made, such as [[Zeffirelli]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]''—were still released in monaural sound,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063518/|title=Romeo and Juliet|date=October 8, 1968|publisher=|accessdate=January 1, 2017|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; stereo being reserved almost exclusively for expensive musicals such as ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055614/|title=West Side Story|date=December 23, 1961|publisher=|accessdate=January 1, 2017|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058385/|title=My Fair Lady|date=December 25, 1964|publisher=|accessdate=January 1, 2017|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061439/|title=Camelot|date=October 25, 1967|publisher=|accessdate=January 1, 2017|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; epics such as ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052618/|title=Ben-Hur|date=January 29, 1960|publisher=|accessdate=January 1, 2017|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056937/|title=Cleopatra|date=July 31, 1963|publisher=|accessdate=January 1, 2017|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereo was also reserved for dramas with a strong reliance on sound effects or music, such as ''[[The Graduate]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061722/|title=The Graduate|date=December 22, 1967|publisher=|accessdate=January 1, 2017|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its [[Simon and Garfunkel]] score.

===Dolby Stereo===
{{refimprove section|date=June 2014}}
{{main|Dolby Stereo}}
Today, virtually all films are released in stereophonic sound as the Westrex Stereo Variable-Area system developed in 1977 for ''Star Wars'', which was no more expensive to manufacture in stereo than it was for mono. The format employs the same Western Electric/Westrex/Nuoptix RA-1231 recorder, and coupled with QS quadraphonic matrixing technology licensed to Dolby Labs from Sansui, this SVA system can produce the same Left, Center, Right and Surround sound of the original CinemaScope system of 1953 by using a single standard-width optical track. This important development finally brought stereo sound to so-called Flat (Non-Wide-Screen) films presented at the most common aspect ratio of 1.85:1 although a number of 'flat' films are photographed and presented at a ratio of 1.66:1, common in Europe or 1.75:1 common in museums.

Producers often took advantage of the six magnetic soundtracks available for [[70mm film]] release prints, and productions shot in either 65MM or to save money, in 35MM and then blown up to 70MM.  In these instances, the 70MM prints would be mixed for stereo, while the 35MM reduction prints would be remixed for mono.

Some films shot in 35MM, such as ''Camelot'', featured four-track stereophonic sound and were then "blown-up" to 70MM so that they could be shown on a giant screen with six-track stereophonic sound. Unfortunately however, many of these presentations were only pseudo stereo, utilizing a somewhat artificial six-track panning method. A process known somewhat derogatorily as the "Columbia Spread" was often used to synthesize Left Center and Right Center from a combination of Left and Center and Right and Center, respectively, or, for effects, the effect could be "panned" anywhere across the five stage speakers using a one-in/five-out pan pot. Dolby, who did not approve of this practice, which results in loss of separation, instead used the Left Centre and Right Centre channels for LFE (low-frequency enhancement) utilizing the bass units of the otherwise redundant intermediate front speakers, and later the unused HF capacity of these channels to provide for stereo surround in place of the mono surround.

Dolby Stereo was succeeded by [[Dolby Digital]] 5.1 in the cinema, which retained the Dolby Stereo 70mm 5.1 channel layout, and more recently with the introduction of [[digital cinema]], [[Dolby Surround 7.1]] and [[Dolby Atmos]] in 2010 and 2012 respectively.

==Modern home audio and video==
The progress of stereophonic sound was paced by the technical difficulties of recording and reproducing two or more channels in synchronization with one another, and by the economic and marketing issues of introducing new audio media and equipment. A stereo system cost up to twice as much as a monophonic system, since a stereo system contains two preamplifiers, two amplifiers, and two speaker systems. In addition, the user would need an FM stereo tuner, to upgrade any tape recorder to a stereo model, and to have their phonograph fitted with a stereo cartridge. In the early days it was not clear whether consumers would think the sound was so much better as to be worth twice the price.

==Stereo experiments on disc==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}

===Early lateral, vertical and double-sided stereo===
Edison had been recording in a hill-and-dale or vertically modulated format on his cylinders and discs since 1877, and Berliner had been recording in a side-to-side or lateral format since shortly thereafter. Each format developed on its own trajectory until the late 1920s when electric recording on disc, utilizing  a microphone surpassed acoustic recording where the performer needed to shout or play very loudly into what basically amounted to a megaphone in reverse.

At that time, AM radio had been around for roughly a decade, and broadcasters were looking for both better materials from which to make phonograph records as well as a better format in which to record them to play over the narrow and thus inherently noisy radio channel. As radio had been playing the same shellac discs available to the public, it was found that, even though the playback system was now electric rather than acoustic, the surface noise on the disc would mask the music after just a few plays.

The development of acetate, bakelite, and vinyl, and the production of radio broadcast transcriptions helped to solve this.
Once these considerably more quiet compounds were developed, it was discovered that the rubber-idler-wheel driven turntables of the period had a great deal of low-frequency rumble - but only in the lateral plane. So, even though with all other factors being equal, the lateral plane of recording on disc had the higher fidelity, it was decided to record vertically to produce higher-fidelity recordings on these new 'silent-surface' materials, for two reasons, the increase in fidelity and the incompatibility with home phonographs which, with their lateral-only playback systems would only produce silence from a vertically modulated disc.

After 33-1/3 RPM recording had been perfected for the movies in 1927, the speed of radio program transcriptions was reduced to match, once again to inhibit playback of the discs on normal home consumer equipment. Even though the stylus size remained the same as consumer records at either 3 mils or 2.7 mils, the disc size was increased from 12-inches to the same 16-inches as those used in early talking pictures in order to prevent the practice even further. Now, not only could the records not be played on home equipment due to incompatible recording format and speed, they wouldn't even fit on the player either, which suited the copyright holders.

===Two-channel high fidelity and other experiments===
During the same period engineers got a bright idea. Split the signal into two parts, bass and treble, and record the treble on its own track near the edge of the disc in a lateral format so that there would be no high-frequency distortion, and then record the bass on its own track in a vertical fashion to get rid of the rumble. Unfortunately, vertical grooves take up more space than lateral grooves; so when the bass track was full, starting halfway through the disc and ending up at the center, the treble track had a large amount of unused space at the end. The alternative was to record it at a wider pitch i.e. lines-per-inch in order to match up with the bass track and keep both styli in the same place, limiting the playing time to slightly longer than a single even at 33-1/3 RPM on a 12-inch disc.

Another failed experiment in the late 1920s and early '30s involved recording the left channel on the left side of the disc (when held vertically with its edge facing the user) and recording the right channel on the right side of the disc. These were manufactured on twin film-company recording lathes which ran in perfect sync with one another with no variation, and were capable of not only outside-in as well as inside-out recordings (see Radio Programming Vinyl Sequence under [[Gramophone record]]) but also counter-clockwise as well as conventional clockwise recording by mounting the cutting head wrong-way-out with a special adapter. One master was recorded conventionally and the other was recorded counterclockwise, each master was run separately through the plating process, lined up to match, and subsequently mounted in a press. This recording method was later used to record counter-clockwise discs by Mattel for one of its answers to the GAF Talking [[View Master]] in the mid-60s.

The dual-sided stereo disc was then played vertically, first in a system that featured two tonearms on the same post facing one another, and later on in an offset system where one tonearm was placed conventionally and the other tonearm was placed opposite, i.e. not only on the other side of the mechanism, but facing the other way as well so that both tonearms could start at the edge and play to the center. But, even with playing the disc vertically in a rotating clamp, the same trouble was observed with keeping the two tonearms in their respective synchronous revolutions. The system was developed further however and adapted so that a single tonearm could play one side of a record or the other in jukeboxes of the late 1930s and early '40s.

Five years later, Bell Labs was experimenting with a two-channel Lateral-Vertical system, where the left channel was recorded laterally and the right channel was recorded vertically, still utilizing a standard 3-mil 78-RPM groove, over three times larger than the modern LP stylus of the late 20th Century. The trouble with that was, once again, all the low-frequency rumble was in the left channel and all the high-frequency distortion was in the right channel. Over a quarter of a century later, it was decided to tilt the recording head 45 degrees off to the right side so that both the low frequency rumble and high frequency distortion were shared equally by both channels, producing the 45/45 system we know today.

===Emory Cook===
In 1952, [[Emory Cook]] (1913–2002), who already had become famous by designing new feedback disk-cutter heads to improve sound from tape to vinyl, took the two-channel high-fidelity system described above and developed a somewhat misnamed "binaural" record out of it, which consisted of the same two separate channels cut into two separate groups of grooves running next to each other as described above, i.e. one running from the edge of the disc to halfway through and the other starting at the halfway point and ending up towards the label, but he used two ''lateral'' grooves with a 500&amp;nbsp;Hz crossover in the inner track to try and compensate for the lower fidelity and high frequency distortion on the inner track.

Each groove needed its own monophonic needle and cartridge on its own branch of tonearm, and each needle was connected to a separate amplifier and speaker. This setup was intended to give a demonstration at a New York audio fair of Cook's cutter heads rather than to sell the record; but soon afterward, the demand for such recordings and the equipment to play it grew, and Cook Records began to produce such records commercially. Cook recorded a vast array of sounds, ranging from railroad sounds to thunderstorms.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The term "binaural" that Cook used should not be confused with the modern use of the word, where "binaural" is an inner-ear recording using small microphones placed in the ear. Cook used conventional microphones, but used the same word, "binaural", that [[Alan Blumlein]] had used for his experimental stereo records almost 20 years earlier.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1953, Cook had a catalog of about 25 stereo records for sale to [[audiophile]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=YgoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA15 Commercial Binaural Sound Not Far Off]", ''Billboard'', Oct. 24, 1953, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magnetic tape recording==
The first stereo recordings using magnetic tape were made in [[Germany]] in the early 1940s using [[Magnetophon]] recorders. Around 300 recordings were made of various symphonies, most of which were seized by the [[Red Army]] at the end of [[World War II]]. The recordings were of relatively [[high fidelity]], thanks to the discovery of [[Tape bias|AC bias]]. A 1944 recording of [[Anton Bruckner]]'s Symphony No. 8 directed by [[Herbert von Karajan]] and the [[Orchester der Berliner Staatsoper]] and a 1944 or 1945 recording of [[Walter Gieseking]] playing [[Beethoven]]'s Piano Concerto No. 5 (with [[flak]] fire audible in the background) are the only recordings still known to exist.

In the US, stereo magnetic tape recording was demonstrated on standard 1/4-inch tape for the first time in 1952, using two sets of recording and playback heads, upside-down and offset from one another.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=jNwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA216 Adventures in Sound]", ''Popular Mechanics'', September 1952, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, [[Remington Records]] began recording a number of its sessions in stereo, including performances by [[Thor Johnson]] and the [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]].

Later that same year, more experimental stereo recordings were conducted with [[Leopold Stokowski]] and a group of New York studio musicians at [[RCA Victor]] Studios in [[New York City]]. In February 1954, the label also recorded a performance of [[Berlioz]]' masterpiece The ''[[Damnation of Faust]]'' by the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] under the direction of [[Charles Munch (conductor)|Charles Munch]], the success of which led to the practice of regularly recording sessions in stereo.

Shortly afterwards, RCA Victor recorded the last two [[Blue Network|NBC Radio]] broadcast concerts by famed conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]] and the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]], on stereophonic magnetic tape, however they were never officially released, though they have long been available on pirated LPs and CDs. In the UK, [[Decca Records]] began recording sessions in stereo in mid-1954, and by that time even smaller labels in the U.S. such as  Concertapes, Bel Canto and Westminster along with major labels such as RCA Victor began releasing stereophonic recordings on two-track prerecorded reel-to-reel magnetic tape, priced at twice or three times the cost of monaural recordings, which retailed for around $2.95 to $3.95 apiece for a standard monaural LP. Even two-track monaural tape which had to be flipped over halfway through and carried exactly the same information as the monaural LP - but without the crackles and pops - were being sold for $6.95.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=EBsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA34 Tape Trade Group to Fix Standards]", ''Billboard'', July 10, 1954, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The additional cost of stereo sound must be weighed against the economy of the time. In 1954 United States, the average weekly salary was $60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610231614/https://s044a90.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/partlist!OpenView|title=SSA's Policy Information Site - POMS|date=June 10, 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apartment rent approximated $75–$100 a month for a two-room.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=February 2018}} Therefore, many of the two-track stereo tape recordings of the period were priced at a premium, upwards of $12.95-$18.95 a piece.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=February 2018}} A full-length album, when the corresponding mono LP was only $3.95, was cost prohibitive. In addition, the price of the stereophonic recorder upon which to play the records may have been equal to, or greater than, the cost of a new car.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=February 2018}}

However, audiophiles, with little or no regard for the cost, bought them and the players anyway,{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=February 2018}} and stereophonic sound came to at least a select few living rooms of the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;"Hi-Fi: Two-Channel Commotion", ''The New York Times'', November 17, 1957, p. XX1.&lt;/ref&gt; Stereo recording became widespread in the music business by the 3rd quarter of 1957.

==Stereo on disc==
[[File:Audio Fidelity first stereo LP.jpg|thumb|left| Label and sleeve from [[Audio Fidelity Records]]' second stereo demonstration record, ca. 1958.]]
In November 1957, the small [[Audio Fidelity Records]] label released the first mass-produced stereophonic disc. Sidney Frey, founder and president, had Westrex engineers, owners of one of the two rival stereo disk-cutting systems, cut a disk for release before any of the major record labels could do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jazzology.com/jazzbeat.php?id=50 |title=Jazzbeat October 26, 2007 |publisher=Jazzology.com |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedukesofdixieland.com/history.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040126224550/http://www.thedukesofdixieland.com/history.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 26, 2004 |title=Harry R.

This demonstration disc was introduced to the public on December 13, 1957 at the Times Auditorium in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=wR0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Mass Produced Stereo Disc is Demonstrated]," ''Billboard, Dec. 16, 1957, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Only 500 copies of this initial demonstration record were pressed and three days later, Frey advertised in ''[[Billboard Magazine]]'' that he would send a free copy to anyone in the industry who wrote to him on company letterhead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wR0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA33 Audio Fidelity advertisement], ''Billboard'', Dec. 16, 1957, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=wR0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA27 Mass Produced Stereo Disk is Demonstrated]", ''Billboard'', Dec. 16, 1957, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The move generated such a great deal of publicity&lt;ref&gt;Alfred R. Zipser, "Stereophonic Sound Waiting for a Boom", ''The New York Times'', August 24, 1958, p. F1.&lt;/ref&gt; that early stereo phonograph dealers were forced to demonstrate on Audio Fidelity Records.

Also in December 1957, [[Bel Canto Records]], another small label, produced its own stereophonic demonstration disc on multicolored vinyl so that stereo dealers would have more than one choice for demonstration. With the supplied special turntables featuring a clear platter lighted from underneath to show off the color as well as the sound, the stunt worked even better for Bel Canto, whose roster of jazz, easy listening and [[lounge music]], pressed onto their trademark Caribbean-blue vinyl sold well throughout 1958 and early into 1959.

===Affordable cartridges===
When Audio Fidelity released its stereophonic demonstration disc, there was no affordable [[magnetic cartridge]] on the market capable of playing it. After the release of other demonstration discs and the respective libraries from which they were culled, the other spur to the popularity of stereo discs was the reduction in price of a stereo cartridge, for playing the disks, from $250 to $29.95 in June 1958.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=txgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA36 Audio Fidelity Bombshell Had Industry Agog]", ''Billboard'', Dec. 22, 1962, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The first four mass-produced stereophonic discs available to the buying public were released in March 1958—''Johnny Puleo and his Harmonica Gang Volume 1'' (AFSD 5830), ''Railroad&amp;nbsp;– Sounds of a Vanishing Era'' (AFSD 5843), ''Lionel&amp;nbsp;– Lionel Hampton and his Orchestra'' (AFSD 5849) and ''Marching Along with the Dukes of Dixieland Volume 3'' (AFSD 5851).  By the end of March, the company had four more stereo LPs available, interspersed with several Bel Canto releases.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=eyEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false CBS Discloses Stereo Step]," ''Billboard'', March 31, 1958, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although both monaural as well as stereo LP records were manufactured for the first ten years of stereo on disc, the major record labels  issued their last monaural ''albums'' in 1968, relegating the format to 45 RPM singles, [[flexidisc]]s and radio promotional materials which continued until 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvan Fox, "Disks Today: New Sounds and Technology Spin Long-Playing Record of Prosperity", ''The New York Times'', August 28, 1967, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010726013519/http://www.ronpenndorf.com/labelography4.html RCA Victor Red Seal Labelography (1950–1967)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=wAoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA1 Mfrs.

==Early broadcasting==
===Radio===

In December 1925, the [[BBC]]'s experimental transmitting station, 5XX, in [[Daventry, Northamptonshire]], made radio's first stereo broadcast—a concert from [[Manchester]], conducted by [[Hamilton Harty|Sir Hamilton Harty]]—with 5XX broadcasting the right channel nationally by [[long wave]] and local BBC stations broadcasting the left channel by [[medium wave]]. The BBC repeated the experiment in 1926, using 2LO in London and 5XX at Daventry. Following experimental FM stereo transmissions in the London area in 1958 and regular Saturday morning demonstration transmissions using TV sound and medium wave (AM) radio to provide the two channels, the first regular BBC transmissions using an FM stereo signal began on the BBC's [[BBC Third Programme|Third Programme]] network on August 28, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/anniversaries/august#heading-start-of-experimental-stereo-broadcasting-28-august-1962 Start of experimental stereo broadcasting 28 August 1962], BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicago [[AM broadcasting|AM]] radio station [[WGN (AM)|WGN]] (and its sister [[FM broadcasting|FM]] station, WGNB) collaborated on an hourlong stereophonic demonstration broadcast on May 22, 1952, with one [[audio channel]] broadcast by the AM station and the other audio channel by the FM station.&lt;ref&gt;W-G-N and WGNB to Unveil New 'Visual' Sound", ''The Chicago Tribune'', May 19, 1952, p. B-6.&lt;/ref&gt; New York City's WQXR initiated its first stereophonic broadcasts in October 1952, and by 1954, was broadcasting all of its live musical programs in stereophonic sound, using its AM and FM stations for the two audio channels.&lt;ref&gt;"News of TV and Radio", ''The New York Times'', Oct. 26, 1952, p.

Tests of six competing FM-only systems were conducted on KDKA-FM in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania during July and August 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Commentary: Dick Burden on FM Stereo Revisited |url= http://www.rwonline.com/article/812 |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120910150332/http://www.rwonline.com/article/812 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= September 10, 2012 |date= February 1, 2007 |publisher= RADIOWORLD |accessdate= September 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Federal Communications Commission]] announced stereophonic [[FM broadcasting|FM]] technical standards in April 1961, with licensed regular stereophonic FM radio broadcasting set to begin in the United States on June 1, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;"Conversion to Stereo Broadcasts on FM is Approved by F.C.C.", ''The New York Times'', April 20, 1961, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; [[WUSN|WEFM]] (in the Chicago area) and WGFM (in [[Schenectady, New York]]) were reported as the first stereo stations.&lt;ref&gt;"Stereophonic FM Broadcast Begun by WEFM", ''The Chicago Tribune'', June 2, 1961, p.

===Television===
A December 11, 1952 closed-circuit television performance of ''[[Carmen]]'', from the [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th St)|Metropolitan Opera House]] in New York City to 31 theaters across the United States, included a stereophonic sound system developed by [[RCA]].&lt;ref&gt;"Theater to Have Special Sound System for TV", ''Los Angeles Times'', Dec. 5, 1952, p. B-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The first several shows of the 1958–59 season of ''The Plymouth Show'' (AKA ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'') on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (America) network were broadcast with stereophonic sound in 75 [[media market]]s, with one audio channel broadcast via television and the other over the ABC radio network.&lt;ref&gt;"A Television First!

The Legacy of Broadcast Stereo Sound. ''Journal of Sonic Studies''. Oct. 2012 at http://journal.sonicstudies.org/vol03/nr01/a03&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of FM stereo in 1961, a small number of music-oriented TV shows were broadcast with stereo sound using a process called [[simulcast]]ing, in which the audio portion of the show was carried over a local FM stereo station.&lt;ref&gt;For example: Jack Gould, "TV: Happy Marriage With FM Stereo", ''The New York Times'', Dec. 26, 1967, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s, these shows were usually manually synchronized with a [[Reel to reel|reel-to-reel]] tape delivered by mail to the FM station (unless the concert or music originated locally). In the 1980s, [[Satellite television|satellite]] delivery of both television and radio programs made this fairly tedious process of synchronization unnecessary. One of the last of these simulcast programs was ''[[Friday Night Videos]]'' on NBC, just before [[Multichannel television sound|MTS stereo]] was approved by the FCC.

The [[BBC]] made extensive use of [[simulcast]]ing between 1974 and around 1990. The first such transmission was in 1974, when the BBC broadcast a recording of Van Morrison's London Rainbow Concert simultaneously on BBC2 TV and Radio 2. After that it was used for many other music programmes, live and recorded, including the annual BBC [[The Proms|Promenade concerts]] and the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. The advent of [[NICAM]] stereo sound with TV rendered this unnecessary.

[[Cable tv|Cable TV]] systems delivered many stereo programs utilizing this method for many years until prices for MTS stereo [[RF modulator|modulators]] dropped. One of the first stereo cable stations was [[The Movie Channel]], though the most popular cable TV station that drove up usage of stereo simulcasting was [[MTV]].

Japanese television began multiplex (stereo) sound broadcasts in 1978,&lt;ref name="Japan's Stereo TV System"&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/16/business/japan-s-stereo-tv-system.html Japan's Stereo TV System]", ''The New York Times'', June 16, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; and regular transmissions with stereo sound came in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terramedia.co.uk/Chronomedia/years/1982.htm Chronomedia: 1982].&lt;/ref&gt; By 1984, about 12% of the programming, or about 14 or 15 hours per station per week, made use of the multiplex technology. [[West Germany]]'s second television network, [[ZDF]], began offering stereo programs in 1984.&lt;ref name="Japan's Stereo TV System"/&gt;

===MTS: Stereo for television===
{{Main|Multichannel television sound}}
In 1979, ''The New York Times'' reported, "What has prompted the [television] industry to embark on establishing high-fidelity [sound] standards now, according to engineering executives involved in the project, is chiefly the rapid march of the new television technologies, especially those that are challenging broadcast television, such as the [[Laserdisc|video disk]]."&lt;ref&gt;Les Brown, "Hi-fi Stereo TV Coming in 2 to 4 Years", ''The New York Times'', Oct. 25, 1979, p. C-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multichannel television sound''', better known as '''MTS''' (often still as '''BTSC''', for the [[Broadcast Television Systems Committee]] that created it), is the method of [[encoder|encoding]] three additional [[channel (communications)|channels]] of [[Sound|audio]] into an [[NTSC]]-format [[Sound|audio]] [[carrier wave|carrier]]. It was adopted by the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] as the United States [[standardization|standard]] for stereo television [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] in 1984.
Sporadic network transmission of stereo audio began on NBC on July 26, 1984, with ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''—although at the time, only the network's New York City flagship station, [[WNBC]], had stereo broadcast capability.&lt;ref&gt;Peter W. Kaplan, "TV Notes", ''New York Times'', July 28, 1984, sec. 1, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Regular stereo transmission of programs began in 1985.

==Recording methods==
===A-B technique: time-of-arrival stereophony===
[[File:AB Stereo.svg|thumb|A-B stereo microphone placement.]]
This uses two parallel omnidirectional microphones some distance apart, capturing time-of-arrival stereo information as well as some level (amplitude) difference information—especially if employed in close proximity to the sound source(s). At a distance of about {{convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on}}, the time delay (time-of-arrival difference) for a signal reaching the first microphone and then the other one from the side is approximately 1.5&amp;nbsp;ms (1&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;ms). If you increase the distance between the microphones, you effectively decrease the pickup angle. At a {{convert|70|cm|in|abbr=on}} distance, it is approximately equivalent to the pickup angle of the near-coincident ORTF setup.

This technique can produce phase issues when the stereo signal is mixed to mono.

===X-Y technique: intensity stereophony===
[[File:XY stereo.svg|thumb|X-Y stereo microphone placement.]]
Here, two directional [[microphone]]s are at the same place, typically pointing at an angle between 90° and 135° to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rycote.com/images/uploads/The_Stereophonic_Zoom.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531142452/http://www.rycote.com/images/uploads/The_Stereophonic_Zoom.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 31, 2011 |title="The Stereophonic Zoom" by Michael Williams |format=PDF |accessdate=October 17, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stereo effect is achieved through differences in sound pressure level between two microphones. A difference in levels of 18&amp;nbsp;dB (16 to 20&amp;nbsp;dB) is needed for hearing the direction of a loudspeaker. Due to the lack of differences in time-of-arrival/phase ambiguities, the sonic characteristic of X-Y recordings has less sense of space and depth when compared to recordings employing an A-B setup. When two figure-eight microphones are used, facing ±45° with respect to the sound source, the X-Y setup is called a [[Blumlein Pair]]. The sonic image produced is realistic.

===M/S technique: mid/side stereophony===
[[File:MS stereo.svg|thumb|Mid-Side stereo microphone technique.]] This coincident technique employs a bidirectional microphone facing sideways and another microphone at an angle of 90°, facing the sound source. The second microphone is generally a variety of cardioid, although [[Alan Blumlein]] described the usage of an omnidirectional transducer in his original patent.

The left and right channels are produced through a simple matrix: Left = Mid + Side; Right = Mid − Side (the polarity-reversed side signal). This configuration produces a completely mono-compatible signal and, if the Mid and Side signals are recorded (rather than the matrixed Left and Right), the stereo width can be manipulated after the recording has taken place. This makes it especially useful for film-based projects.

===Near-coincident technique: mixed stereophony===
[[File:ORTF-Stereo.svg|thumb|left| [[ORTF]] stereo microphone technique.]] These techniques combine the principles of both [[AB Class amplifier|A-B]] and [[X-Y]] ([[coincident pair]]) techniques. For example, the [[ORTF stereo technique]] of the [[Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française]] ([[Radio France]]) calls for a pair of [[cardioid microphone]]s placed 17&amp;nbsp;cm apart at a total angle between microphones of 110°, which results in a stereophonic pickup angle of 96° (''[[Stereo Recording Angle]]'', or SRA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eberhard Sengpiel |url=http://www.sengpielaudio.com/ |title=Forum für Mikrofonaufnahme und Tonstudiotechnik. Eberhard Sengpiel |publisher=Sengpielaudio.com |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[NOS stereo technique]] of the Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (Dutch Broadcasting Organisation), the total angle between microphones is 90° and the distance is 30&amp;nbsp;cm, thus capturing time-of-arrival stereo information as well as level information. It is noteworthy that all spaced microphone arrays and all near-coincident techniques use a spacing of at least 17&amp;nbsp;cm or more. 17&amp;nbsp;cm roughly equals the human ear distance and therefore provides the same interaural time difference (ITD) or more, depending on the spacing between microphones. Although the recorded signals are generally intended for playback over stereo loudspeakers, reproduction over headphones can provide remarkably good results, depending on the microphone arrangement.

===Pseudo-stereo===
In the course of restoration or remastering of [[monaural|monophonic]] records, various techniques of "pseudo-stereo", "quasi-stereo", or "rechanneled stereo" have been used to create the impression that the sound was originally recorded in stereo. These techniques first involved hardware methods (see [[Duophonic]]) or, more recently, a combination of hardware and software. Multitrack Studio, from Bremmers Audio Design (The Netherlands),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multitrackstudio.com/pseudostereo.php |title=Pseudo-Stereo |publisher=Multitrackstudio.com |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses special filters to achieve a pseudo-stereo effect: the "shelve" filter directs low frequencies to the left channel and high frequencies to the right channel, and the "comb" filter adds a small delay in signal timing between the two channels, a delay barely noticeable by ear,&lt;ref group=note&gt;The comb filter allows range of manipulation between 0 and 100 [[milliseconds]].&lt;/ref&gt; but contributing to an effect of "widening" original "fattiness" of mono recording.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecmc.rochester.edu/ecmc/docs/hyperprism1.5.5/stereo.HTM Hyperprism Manipulation Process—Quasi stereo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331024716/http://ecmc.rochester.edu/ecmc/docs/hyperprism1.5.5/stereo.HTM |date=March 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cec.concordia.ca/econtact/8_3/gauthier.html A Review and an Extension of Pseudo-Stereo...] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206065506/http://cec.concordia.ca/econtact/8_3/gauthier.html |date=December 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The special pseudo-stereo circuit—invented by Kishii and Noro, from Japan—was patented in the United States in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6636608.html |title=Pseudo-stereo circuit—Patent 6636608 |publisher=Freepatentsonline.com |date=October 21, 2003 |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with already previously issued patents for similar devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5355416/description.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204103229/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5355416/description.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 4, 2008 |title=Psycho acoustic pseudo-stereo fold system |publisher=Patentstorm.us |accessdate=October 17, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Artificial stereo techniques have been used to improve the listening experience of monophonic recordings or to make them more "saleable" in today's market, where people expect stereo. Some critics have expressed concern about the use of these methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Friday, Jan. 20, 1961 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,871986,00.html |title='&amp;#39;Pseudo Stereo'&amp;#39;, Time magazine, Jan.&amp;nbsp;20,&amp;nbsp;1961 |work=Time  |date=January 20, 1961 |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Binaural recording==
{{Details|Binaural recording}}
Engineers make a technical distinction between "binaural" and "stereophonic" recording. Of these, [[binaural recording]] is analogous to [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic photography]]. In binaural recording, a pair of microphones is put inside a [[kunstkopf|model of a human head]] that includes external ears and ear canals; each microphone is where the [[eardrum]] would be.  The recording is then played back through headphones, so that each channel is presented independently, without mixing or crosstalk. Thus, each of the listener's eardrums is driven with a replica of the auditory signal it would have experienced at the recording location. The result is an accurate duplication of the [[auditory spatiality]] that would have been experienced by the listener had he or she been in the same place as the model head. Because of the inconvenience of wearing headphones, true binaural recordings have remained laboratory and audiophile curiosities.  However "loudspeaker-binaural" listening is possible with [[Ambiophonics]].

Numerous early two-track-stereo reel-to-reel tapes as well as several experimental stereo disc formats of the early 1950s branded themselves as binaural, however they were merely different incarnations of the above-described stereo or two-track mono recording methods (lead vocal or instrument isolated on one channel and orchestra on the other sans lead.)

==Playback==
Stereophonic sound attempts to create an illusion of location for various sound sources (voices, instruments, etc.) within the original recording. The recording engineer's goal is usually to create a stereo "image" with localization information. When a stereophonic recording is heard through loudspeaker systems (rather than headphones), each ear, of course, hears sound from both speakers. The audio engineer may, and often does, use more than two microphones (sometimes many more) and may mix them down to two tracks in ways that exaggerate the separation of the instruments, in order to compensate for the mixture that occurs when listening via speakers.

Descriptions of stereophonic sound tend to stress the ability to localize the position of each instrument in space, but this would only be true in a carefully engineered and installed system, where speaker placement and room acoustics are taken into account.  In reality, many playback systems, such as all-in-one boombox units and the like, are incapable of recreating a realistic stereo image.  Originally, in the late 1950s and 1960s, stereophonic sound was marketed as seeming "richer" or "fuller-sounding" than monophonic sound, but these sorts of claims were and are highly subjective, and again, dependent on the equipment used to reproduce the sound.  In fact, poorly recorded or reproduced stereophonic sound can sound far worse than well done monophonic sound.  When playing back stereo recordings, the best results are obtained by using two identical speakers, in front of and equidistant from the listener, with the listener located on a center line between the two speakers.  In effect, an [[equilateral triangle]] is formed, with the angle between the two speakers around 60 degrees as seen from the listener's point of view.

==Vinyl records==
{{Tall image|Stereo Stack-A kaleidoscopic-wonderland of hi-fidelity and dual-dynamic vibrancy.jpg|250|500|alt=|A compilation of LP stereo banners|right}}
Although Decca had recorded [[Ansermet]]'s conducting of [[Antar (Rimsky-Korsakov)|''Antar'']] in stereo May 1954 it took four years for the first stereo LPs to be sold.&lt;ref&gt;Grammy pulse - Volumes 2 à 3 - Page vi National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (U.S.) - 1984 "After all, stereo sound was developed in 1931, but it took until 1958 for the first stereo LPs to be sold. Keeping in mind corporate and bureaucratic red tape, we could easily be in for a long haul before stereo TV is as natural as having two ears."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, the first group of mass-produced stereo two-channel [[vinyl record]]s was issued, by Audio Fidelity in the USA and Pye in Britain, using the [[Westrex]] "45/45" single-groove system. Whereas the stylus moves horizontally when reproducing a monophonic disk recording, on stereo records, the stylus moves vertically as well as horizontally. One could envision a system in which the left channel was recorded laterally, as on a monophonic recording, with the right channel information recorded with a "hill and dale" vertical motion; such systems were proposed but not adopted, due to their incompatibility with existing phono pickup designs (see below).

In the Westrex system, each channel drives the cutting head at a 45-degree angle to the vertical. During playback, the combined signal is sensed by a left-channel coil mounted diagonally opposite the inner side of the groove and a right-channel coil mounted diagonally opposite the outer side of the groove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vinylrecorder.com/stereo.html|title=Stereo disc recording|accessdate=October 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Westrex system provided for the polarity of one channel to be inverted: this way large groove displacement would occur in the horizontal plane and not in the vertical one.  The latter would require large up-and-down excursions and would encourage cartridge skipping during loud passages.

The combined stylus motion is, in terms of the vector, the sum and difference of the two stereo channels. Effectively, all horizontal stylus motion conveys the L+R sum signal, and vertical stylus motion carries the L−R difference signal. The advantages of the 45/45 system are that it has greater compatibility with monophonic recording and playback systems.

Even though a monophonic cartridge will technically reproduce an equal blend of the left and right channels, instead of reproducing only one channel, this was not recommended in the early days of stereo due to the larger stylus (1.0 mil vs 0.7 mil for stereo) coupled with the lack of vertical compliance of the mono cartridges available in the first ten years of stereo. These factors would result in the stylus 'digging into' the stereo vinyl and carving up the stereo portion of the groove, destroying it for subsequent playback on stereo cartridges. This is why one often notices the banner PLAY ONLY WITH STEREO CARTRIDGE AND STYLUS on stereo vinyl issued between 1958 and 1964.

Conversely, and with the benefit of no damage to any type of disc even from the beginning, a stereo cartridge reproduces the lateral grooves of monophonic recording equally through both channels, rather than through one channel. Also, it gives a more balanced sound, because the two channels have equal fidelity as opposed to providing one higher-fidelity laterally recorded channel and one lower-fidelity vertically recorded channel. Overall, this approach may give higher fidelity, because the "difference" signal is usually of low power, and is thus less affected by the intrinsic distortion of "hill and dale"-style recording.

Additionally, surface noise tends to be picked up in a greater capacity in the vertical channel, therefore a mono record played on a stereo system can be in worse shape than the same record in stereo and still be enjoyable. (See [[Gramophone record]] for more on lateral and vertical recording.)

This system was conceived by [[Alan Blumlein]] of [[EMI]] in 1931 and was patented in the U.K. the same year, but was not reduced to actual practice as was a requirement for patenting in the U.S. and elsewhere at that time. (Blumlein was killed in a plane crash while testing radar equipment during [[World War II|WW-II]], and he, therefore, never reduced the system to actual practice through ''both'' a recording ''and'' a reproducing means.) EMI cut the first stereo test discs using the system in 1933, but it was not applied commercially until a quarter of a century later, and by another company ([[Westrex]] division of [[Litton Industries]] Inc, as a successor to [[Western Electric]] Company), and dubbed StereoDisk. Stereo sound provides a more natural listening experience, since the spatial location of the source of a sound is (at least in part) reproduced.

In the 1960s, it was common practice to generate stereo versions of music from monophonic master tapes, which were normally marked "electronically reprocessed" or "electronically enhanced" stereo on track listings. These were generated by a variety of processing techniques to try to separate out various elements; this left noticeable and unsatisfactory artifacts in the sound, typically sounding "phasey".  However, as multichannel recording became increasingly available, it has become progressively easier to master or remaster more plausible stereo recordings out of the archived multitrack master tapes.

==Compact disc==
The [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|Red Book CD]] specification includes two channels by default, and so a mono recording on CD either has one empty channel, or else the same signal being relayed to both channels simultaneously. However, noncommercial CDs in other formats such as White Book or Orange Book can feature up to four hours of stereo music on one CD for the purposes of extended programming in public spaces, such as malls.

These formats slightly reduce both the sampling frequency from 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz as well as the bit-depth frequency from 16-bit and employ other proprietary technologies in order to increase the time on the disc and, as in the 16-inch transcriptions above - render them unplayable on the vast majority of consumer equipment.

==Broadcasting==
===Radio===

In [[FM broadcasting]], the Zenith-GE pilot-tone stereo system is used throughout the world.

Because of the limited audio quality of the majority of AM receivers, and also because AM stereo receivers are relatively scarce, relatively few AM stations employ stereo. Various modulation schemes are used for [[AM stereo]], of which the best-known is [[Motorola]]'s [[C-QUAM]], the official method for most countries in the world that transmit in AM stereo. More AM stations are adopting digital [[HD Radio]], which allows the transmission of stereo sound on AM stations; HD Radio's lack of compatibility with C-QUAM along with other interference issues has hindered HD Radio's use on the AM dial. For Digital Audio Broadcasting, [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II|MP2]] audio streams are used. DAB is one of the Digital Radio formats that is used to broadcast Digital Audio over terrestrial broadcast networks or satellite networks. DAB is extended to video, and the new format is called [[Digital Multimedia Broadcasting|DMB]].

In Sweden, [[Televerket (Sweden)|Televerket]] invented a different stereo broadcasting system called the ''Compander System''. It had a high level of channel separation and could even be used to broadcast two mono signals - for example for language studies (with two languages at the same time). But tuners and receivers with the pilot-tone system were sold so people in southern Sweden could listen to, for example, Danish radio. At last Sweden (the Televerket) decided to start broadcasting in stereo according to the pilot-tone system in 1977. But stereo radio was delayed in Sweden because of the two competing systems.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Television===
For analog TV (PAL and NTSC), various modulation schemes are used in different parts of the world to broadcast more than one sound channel. These are sometimes used to provide two mono sound channels that are in different languages, rather than stereo. [[Multichannel television sound]] is used mainly in the Americas. [[NICAM]] is widely used in Europe, except in Germany, where [[Zweikanalton]] is used. The EIAJ FM/FM subcarrier system is used in Japan. For [[Digital TV]], MP2 audio streams are widely used within MPEG-2 program streams. [[Dolby Digital]] is the audio standard used for Digital TV in North America, with the capability for anywhere between 1 and 6 discrete channels.

==Common usage==
[[File:2 0 channels (stereo) label.svg|thumb|upright|left|Label for 2.0 sound (stereo).]]
In common usage, a "stereo" is a two-channel sound reproduction system, and a "stereo recording" is a two-channel recording. This is cause for much confusion, since five (or more)-channel [[home cinema|home theater]] systems are not popularly described as "stereo".

Most two-channel recordings are stereo recordings only in this weaker sense. Pop music, in particular, is usually recorded using [[close miking]] techniques, which artificially separate signals into several tracks. The individual tracks (of which there may be hundreds) are then "mixed down" into a two-channel recording. The audio engineers determine where each track will be placed in the stereo "image", by using various techniques that may vary from very simple (such as "left-right" [[panning (audio)|panning controls]]) to more sophisticated and extensively based on [[Psychoacoustics|psychoacoustic]] research (such as channel equalization, compression and [[Microphone practice#M/S technique: Mid/Side stereophony|mid-side processing]]). The end product using this process often bears little or no resemblance to the actual physical and spatial relationship of the musicians at the time of the original performance; indeed, it is not uncommon for different tracks of the same song to be recorded at different times (and even in different studios) and then mixed into a final two-channel recording for commercial release.

[[European classical music|Classical music]] recordings are a notable exception. They are more likely to be recorded without having tracks dubbed in later as in pop recordings, so that the actual physical and [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Orchestra_layout.svg spatial relationship] of the musicians at the time of the original performance can be preserved on the recording.

==Balance==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Balance]] --&gt;
'''Balance''' can mean the amount of signal from each channel reproduced in a stereo [[audio recording]]. Typically, a balance control in its center position will have 0 [[decibel|dB]] of gain for both channels and will attenuate one channel as the control is turned, leaving the other channel at 0&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aes.org/par/b/#balance |title=AES Professional Audio Reference Home |accessdate=January 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Berlin Tapes''''' is a [[Cover version|covers]] / [[soundtrack]] album by [[Australia]]n rock musician [[Iva Davies]] and his band [[Icehouse (band)|Icehouse]]. The record was a collaboration between Davies and classical music composer [[Max Lambert]] to accompany the [[Sydney Dance Company]]'s production of the ballet ''Berlin'', for which Icehouse performed live on stage.

'''''The Cycles: International Grand Prix Racing''''' is a [[1989 in video gaming|1989]] [[computer game]] [[video game developer|developed]] by [[Distinctive Software]] and [[video game publisher|published]] by [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]]. It has similarities to ''[[Grand Prix Circuit (game)|Grand Prix Circuit]]'', except it is a [[motorcycle]] [[Racing video game|racing sim]]. The game includes all the tracks of [[1989 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season]]. Laguna Seca and Goiania circuits are not available when you choose 125cc bike.

It was released for the [[Amiga]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MS-DOS]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[ZX Spectrum]].

==How to play==
More like a simulation than an [[arcade game]], unlike [[Sega]]'s ''[[Hang-On]]'' and ''[[Super Hang-On]]'', the player has no time limit to clear races. If the player crashes, they're out of the race. To win each race, the player must get through the finish lines. The player can change the number of laps for a race.

The game has several modes which it can be played in:

*Championship: Choose a bike, not a track. If the player is qualified for race, he can proceed to it.
*Practice: The player chooses their bike and track.
*Single Race: Player chooses a bike and track. If the player is qualified for race, he can proceed to it.

'''''The Empty Space''''' is a 1968 book by the British director [[Peter Brook]] examining four modes or points of view on theatre: Deadly; Holy; Rough; and Immediate. 

The book is based on a series of four lectures endowed by [[Granada Television]] and delivered at Manchester, [[Keele University|Keele]], [[Hull University|Hull]], and [[Sheffield University|Sheffield]] Universities in England. The first lecture, on The Deadly Theatre, was delivered on 1 February 1965 at [[Manchester University]]. The lecture series helped to fund his long-planned trip to Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=Kustow&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kustow|first1=Michael|title=Peter Brook : a biography|date=2006|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|location=London|isbn=0-7475-7913-X|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was considered controversial when first published in 1968 and received mixed reviews. However, it is now widely taught in higher education theatre studies courses.

''The Empty Space'' is defined by Brook as "[A]ny space in which theatre takes place."  "I can take any empty space and call it a bare stage. A man walks across this empty space whilst someone else is watching him, and this is all that is needed for an act of theatre to be engaged".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brook|first1=Peter|title=The empty space|date=2008|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=0141189223|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Man with the Golden Gun''''' is a 1974 British [[spy film]], the ninth in the [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' series]] produced by [[Eon Productions]], and the second to star [[Roger Moore]] as the fictional  [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]]. A loose adaptation of [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|novel of the same name]], the film has Bond sent after the Solex Agitator, a device that can harness the [[solar power|power of the sun]], while facing the assassin [[Francisco Scaramanga]], the "Man with the Golden Gun". The action culminates in a duel between them that settles the fate of the Solex.

''The Man with the Golden Gun'' was the fourth and final film in the series directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]. The script was written by [[Richard Maibaum]] and [[Tom Mankiewicz]]. The film was set in the face of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 energy crisis]], a dominant theme in the script. Britain had still not yet fully overcome the crisis when the film was released in December 1974. The film also reflects the then popular [[martial arts film]] craze, with several [[kung fu]] scenes and a predominantly Asian location, being set and shot in [[Thailand]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Macau]]. Part of the film is also set in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], but it was not shot there.

The film was met with mixed reviews, and some critics described it as the lowest point in the canon up to that time. [[Christopher Lee]]'s portrayal of Scaramanga as a villain of similar skill and ability to Bond was generally praised, but reviewers criticized the film as a whole, particularly its comedic approach and the performances of Moore and [[Britt Ekland]]. Although the film was profitable, it is the fourth lowest grossing film in the series. It was also the last film to be co-produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], with Saltzman selling his 50% stake in [[Danjaq, LLC]], the parent company of Eon Productions, after the release of the film.

==Plot==
In London, a golden bullet with James Bond's code "007" etched into its surface is received by [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]]. It is believed that it was sent by the famed assassin [[Francisco Scaramanga]], who uses a golden gun, to intimidate the agent. Because of the perceived threat to the agent's life, [[M (James Bond)|M]] relieves Bond of a mission revolving around the work of the solar energy scientist named Gibson, thought to be in possession of information crucial to solving the [[1973 energy crisis|energy crisis]] with [[solar power]]. Bond sets out unofficially to locate Scaramanga.

After retrieving a spent golden bullet from a belly dancer in [[Beirut]] and tracking its manufacturer to [[Macau]], Bond encounters Andrea Anders, Scaramanga's mistress, collecting the shipment of golden bullets at a [[casino]]. Bond follows her to Hong Kong and, in her [[The Peninsula Hong Kong|Peninsula Hotel]] room, pressures Anders to expose information about Scaramanga, his appearance and his plans; she directs him to the [[Bottoms Up Club]]. The club proves to be the location of Scaramanga's next [[contract killing|hit]], Gibson, from whom Scaramanga's [[dwarfism|dwarf]] henchman Nick Nack steals the "Solex agitator", a key component of a [[Power station#Solar|solar power station]]. Before Bond can assert his innocence in Gibson's death, he is taken away by Lieutenant Hip and transported to meet M and [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] in a hidden headquarters in the wreck of the {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}} in the harbour. M assigns Bond to retrieve the Solex.

Bond then travels to [[Bangkok]] to meet Hai Fat, a wealthy Siamese entrepreneur suspected of arranging Gibson's murder. Bond poses as Scaramanga, but his plan backfires because unbeknown to him, Scaramanga himself is operating at Hai Fat's estate. Bond is captured and placed in Fat's martial arts academy, where the students are instructed to kill him. After escaping with the aid of Hip and his nieces, Bond speeds away on a motorized sampan along the river and reunites with his assistant, Mary Goodnight. Scaramanga subsequently kills Hai Fat and assumes control of his empire, taking the Solex with him.

Anders visits Bond, revealing that she sent the bullet to London and wants Bond to kill Scaramanga. In payment, she promises to hand the Solex over to him at a [[Muay Thai]] venue the next day. At the match, Bond discovers Anders dead and meets Scaramanga. Bond observes the Solex on the floor and is able to smuggle it away to Hip, who passes it to Goodnight. When Goodnight attempts to place a [[homing device]] on Scaramanga's car, she becomes trapped in the trunk. Bond discovers Scaramanga driving off and steals an [[American Motors|AMC]] showroom car to give chase, coincidentally with vacationing [[Sheriff J.W. Pepper]] seated within it. Bond and Pepper follow Scaramanga in a car chase across Bangkok, which concludes when Scaramanga's car transforms into a plane, which flies himself, Nick Nack and Goodnight away from Bond.

Picking up Goodnight's tracking signal, Bond flies a seaplane into [[People's Republic of China|Red Chinese]] waters and lands at [[Ko Tapu|Scaramanga's island]]. Scaramanga welcomes and shows Bond the solar power plant operation that he has taken over, the technology for which he intends to sell to the highest bidder. While demonstrating the equipment, Scaramanga uses a powerful energy beam to destroy Bond's plane.

Scaramanga then proposes a pistol [[duel]] with Bond on the beach; the two men stand back to back and are officiated by Nick Nack to take twenty paces, but when Bond turns and fires, Scaramanga has vanished. Nick Nack leads Bond into Scaramanga's Funhouse where Bond stands in the place of a mannequin of himself; when Scaramanga walks by, Bond outwits and kills him. Goodnight kills Scaramanga's security chief Kra, sending his body into one of the temperature control vats. His body heat raises the temperature of the helium cooling the solar plant, which begins to spiral out of control. Bond retrieves the Solex unit just before the island is destroyed, and they escape unharmed in Scaramanga's [[Junk (ship)|Chinese junk]]. Bond then fends off a final attack by Nick Nack, who smuggled himself aboard, placing Nick Nack in a wicker basket on the mainmast of the ship. Bond and Goodnight celebrate their mission by romancing each other.

==Production==
[[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]] intended to follow ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' with ''The Man with the Golden Gun'', inviting Roger Moore to the Bond role. However, filming was planned in Cambodia, and the [[Samlaut Uprising]] made filming impractical, leading to the production being cancelled.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=82}} ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' was produced instead with [[George Lazenby]] as Bond. Lazenby's next Bond film, Saltzman told a reporter, would be either ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' or ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''. The producers chose the latter title, with Sean Connery returning as Bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Graham|first=Sheilah|authorlink=Sheilah Graham Westbrook|title=Speaking For Myself: Film Maker Saltzman Also Restaurateur|newspaper=[[Watertown Daily Times]]|date=5 June 1969|page=9|url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspapers%20Disk3/Watertown%20Times/Watertown%20NY%20Daily%20Timers%201969%20Jun%20Grayscale.pdf/Watertown%20NY%20Daily%20Timers%201969%20Jun%20Grayscale%20-%200104.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broccoli and Saltzman then decided to start production on ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' after [[Live and Let Die (film)|''Live and Let Die'']].&lt;ref name="inside"/&gt; This was the final Bond film to be co-produced by Saltzman as his partnership with Broccoli was dissolved after the film's release. Saltzman sold his 50% stake in Eon Productions's parent company, Danjaq, LLC, to [[United Artists]] to alleviate his financial problems.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=141-2}} The resulting legalities over the Bond property delayed production of the next Bond film, ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Inside The Spy Who Loved Me|location=The Spy Who Loved Me Ultimate Edition, Disc 2|year=2000|format=NTSC, Widescreen, Closed-captioned|publisher=MGM/UA Home Video|medium=DVD|accessdate=27 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel is mostly set in Jamaica, a location which had been already used in the earlier films, ''Dr. No'' and [[Live and Let Die (film)|''Live and Let Die'']]; ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' saw a change in location to put Bond in the Far East for the second time.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=136}} After considering Beirut, where part of the film is set,{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=286}} Iran, where the [[location scouting]] was done but eventually discarded because of the [[Yom Kippur War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Tom Mankewicz|title=The Man with the Golden Gun audio commentary|location=The Man with the Golden Gun Ultimate Edition, Disk 1|publisher=MGM Home Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hạ Long Bay]] in Vietnam, the production team chose Thailand as a primary location, following a suggestion of production designer [[Peter Murton]] after he saw pictures of the [[Phang Nga Bay|Phuket bay]] in a magazine.&lt;ref name="inside"&gt;{{cite video|title=Inside The Man with the Golden Gun|year=2000|format=NTSC, Widescreen, Closed-captioned|publisher=MGM/UA Home Video|location=The Man with the Golden Gun Ultimate Edition, Disc 2|medium=DVD | accessdate=27 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saltzman was happy with the choice of the Far East for the setting as he had always wanted to go on location in Thailand and Hong Kong.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=211}} During the reconnaissance of locations in Hong Kong, Broccoli saw the wreckage of the former {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}} and came up with the idea of using it as the base for MI6's Far East operations.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=286}}

===Writing and themes===
[[Tom Mankiewicz]] wrote a first draft for the script in 1973, delivering a script that was a battle of wills between Bond and Scaramanga, who he saw as Bond's alter ego, "a super-villain of the stature of Bond himself."{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=215}} Tensions between Mankiewicz and Guy Hamilton{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=137}} and Mankiewicz's growing sense that he was "feeling really tapped out on Bond" led to the re-introduction of [[Richard Maibaum]] as the Bond screenwriter.{{sfn|Mankiewicz|Crane|2012|p=162}}

Maibaum, who had worked on six Bond films previously, delivered his own draft based on Mankiewicz's work.&lt;ref name="inside"/&gt; Much of the plot involving Scaramanga being Bond's equal was sidelined in later drafts.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=138}} For one of the two main aspects of the plot, the screenwriters used the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 energy crisis]] as a backdrop to the film,{{sfn|Black|2004|p=78}} allowing the [[MacGuffin]] of the "Solex agitator" to be introduced; Broccoli's stepson [[Michael G. Wilson]] researched solar power to create the Solex.&lt;ref name="inside"/&gt;

While ''Live and Let Die'' had borrowed heavily from the [[blaxploitation]] genre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benshoff|first=Harry M|title=Blaxploitation Horror Films: Generic Reappropriation or Reinscription?|journal=Cinema Journal|date=Winter 2000|volume=39|issue=2|page=37|doi=10.1353/cj.2000.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' borrowed from the  [[Martial arts film|martial arts genre]]{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=140}} that was popular in the 1970s through films such as ''[[Fist of Fury]]'' (1972) and ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' (1973).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fu| Desser |2000|p=[http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/99045702.pdf 26]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of the martial arts for a fight scene in the film "lapses into incredibility" when Lt Hip and his two nieces defeat an entire ''dojo''.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=215}}

===Casting===
Originally, the role of Scaramanga was offered to [[Jack Palance]], but he turned the opportunity down.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=113}} Christopher Lee, who was eventually chosen to portray Scaramanga, was [[Ian Fleming]]'s step-cousin and Fleming had suggested Lee for the role of [[Julius No|Dr. Julius No]] in the 1962 series opener ''Dr. No''. Lee noted that Fleming was a forgetful man and by the time he mentioned this to Broccoli and Saltzman they had cast [[Joseph Wiseman]] in the part.&lt;ref name=empirelee&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=844|title=Christopher Lee: The legendary actor on Scaramanga, Fleming and playing pure evil|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|year=2009|accessdate=11 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to filming on location in [[Bangkok]], his role in the film affected Lee's work the following year, as director [[Ken Russell]] was unable to sign Lee to play The Specialist in the 1975 film ''[[Tommy (1975 film)|Tommy]]'', a part eventually given to [[Jack Nicholson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Frank|title=Tommy|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/152705%7C0/Tommy.html|work=Turner Classic Movies|publisher=Turner Entertainment Networks, Inc|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Swedish models were cast as the [[Bond girl]]s, [[Britt Ekland]] and [[Maud Adams]]. Ekland had been interested in playing a Bond girl since she had seen ''Dr. No'', and contacted the producers about the main role of Mary Goodnight.&lt;ref name=inside/&gt; Hamilton met Adams in New York, and cast her because "she was elegant and beautiful that it seemed to me she was the perfect Bond girl".&lt;ref name=hamilton/&gt; When Ekland read the news that Adams had been cast for ''The Man with the Golden Gun'', she became upset, thinking Adams had been selected to play Goodnight. Broccoli then called Ekland to invite her for the main role,&lt;ref name=inside/&gt; as after seeing her in a film, Broccoli thought Ekland's "generous looks" made her a good contrast to Adams.&lt;ref name=hamilton/&gt; Hamilton decided to put Marc Lawrence, whom he had worked with on ''Diamonds Are Forever'', to play a gangster shot dead by Scaramanga at the start of the film, because he found it an interesting idea to "put sort of a Chicago gangster in the middle of Thailand".&lt;ref name=hamilton&gt;{{cite video|people=Guy Hamilton|title=The Man with the Golden Gun audio commentary|location=The Man with the Golden Gun Ultimate Edition, Disk 1|publisher=MGM Home Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
[[File:Seawise University wreck.jpg|thumb|1972: The wreck of the Seawise University, the former [[RMS Queen Elizabeth|RMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']], in Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong|alt= A half-sunken ship lies listing at 45 degrees]]
Filming commenced on 6 November 1973 at the partly submerged wreck of the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth|RMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']], which acted as a top-secret MI6 base grounded in [[Victoria Harbour]] in Hong Kong.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=114}} The crew was small, and a stunt double was used for James Bond. Other Hong Kong locations included the [[Hong Kong Dragon Garden]] as the estate of [[Hai Fat]], which portrayed a location in [[Bangkok]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public pleasure, private ownership?|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hkedition/2010-07/20/content_11021386.htm|work=Christopher DeWolf|accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major part of [[principal photography]] started on 18 April 1974 in Thailand.&lt;ref name=inside/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=United Artists|journal=Film Bulletin|year=1974|volume=43-44|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thai locations included [[Bangkok]], [[Thon Buri]], Phuket and the nearby [[Phang Nga Province]], on the islands of [[Khao Phing Kan|Ko Khao Phing Kan]] ({{lang-th|เกาะเขาพิงกัน}}) and [[Ko Tapu]] ({{lang-th|เกาะตะปู}}).{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=102}}{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=286}} Scaramanga's hideout is on Ko Khao Phing Kan, and Ko Tapu is often now referred to as ''James Bond Island'' both by locals and in tourist guidebooks.&lt;ref name="locations"&gt;{{cite video|title=Exotic Locations|year=2000|format=NTSC, Widescreen, Closed-captioned|publisher=MGM/UA Home Video|location=The Man with the Golden Gun Ultimate Edition, Disc 2|medium=DVD | accessdate=27 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene during the boxing match used an actual [[Muay Thai]] fixture at the [[Lumpinee Boxing Stadium]].{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=286}}

"[A] car chase [in Bangkok occurred] near a [canal or] [[khlong]] on Krung Kasem Road".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/765132/blame-it-all-on-honey-and-her-white-bikini Blame it all on Honey and her white bikini]&lt;/ref&gt;

Production returned in late April to Hong Kong, and also to Macau,&lt;ref name=inside/&gt; for that island is famous for [[Gambling in Macau|its casinos]], which Hong Kong lacks.&lt;ref name=comm/&gt; Some scenes in Thailand had to be finished, and production had to move to studio work in [[Pinewood Studios]]; this included sets such as Scaramanga's solar energy plant and island interior. [[Academy Award]] winner [[Oswald Morris]] was hired to finish the job after cinematographer [[Ted Moore]] became ill.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=135}} Morris was initially reluctant, as he did not like his previous experiences taking over other cinematographers' work, but accepted after dining with Broccoli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Oswald Morris|title=The Man with the Golden Gun audio commentary|location=The Man with the Golden Gun Ultimate Edition, Disk 1|publisher=MGM Home Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production wrapped in Pinewood in August 1974.&lt;ref name="comm"&gt;{{cite video|people=David Naylor|title=The Man with the Golden Gun audio commentary|location=The Man with the Golden Gun Ultimate Edition, Disk 1|publisher=MGM Home Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Bond island.jpg|thumb|left|One of Scaramanga's Island's outcrops (high tide)|alt= A tall rocky outcrop sitting in the sea, another island is visible, dominating the background.]]

One of the main stunts in the film consisted of stunt driver "Bumps" Willard (as James Bond) driving an [[AMC Hornet]] leaping a broken bridge and spinning around 360 degrees in mid-air about the longitudinal axis, doing an "aerial twist"; Willard successfully completed the jump on the first take.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=102}} The stunt was shown in slow motion, for the scene was otherwise too fast.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=119}} Composer [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] added a [[slide whistle]] sound effect over the stunt, which Broccoli kept in despite thinking that it "undercouped the stunt". Barry later regretted his decision, thinking the whistle "broke the golden rule" as the stunt was "for what it was all worth, a truly dangerous moment,&amp;nbsp;... true James Bond style".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=John Barry|title=The Man with the Golden Gun audio commentary|location=The Man with the Golden Gun Ultimate Edition, Disk 1|publisher=MGM Home Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound effect was described as "simply crass".{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=119}} The writer Jim Smith suggested that the stunt "brings into focus the lack of excitement in the rest of the film and is spoilt by the use of 'comedy' sound effects."{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=136}} Eon Productions had licensed the stunt, which had been designed by Raymond McHenry.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=286}} It was initially conceived at [[Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory]] (CAL) in Buffalo, New York as a test for their vehicle simulation software. After development in simulation, ramps were built and the stunt was tested at CAL's proving ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Astro-Spiral Jump |publisher=McHenry Software|url=http://www.mchenrysoftware.com/mhvosm1.htm |accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It toured as part of the All American Thrill Show as the Astro Spiral before it was picked up for the film. The television programme ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' attempted to repeat the stunt in June 2008, but failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finalgear.com/shows/topgear/11/2/|title=Top Gear – Season 11, Episode 2 – 29 June 2008|work=Final Gear.com|accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene where Scaramanga's [[AMC Matador|Matador]] flies was shot at [[Bovington Camp]], with a model inspired by an actual [[AVE Mizar|car plane]] prototype.&lt;ref name=inside/&gt; Bond's duel with Scaramanga, which Mankewicz said was inspired by the climactic faceoff in ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'', was shortened as the producers felt it was causing pacing problems. The trailers featured some of the cut scenes.&lt;ref name=comm/&gt;

Hamilton adapted an idea of his involving Bond in [[Disneyland]] for Scaramanga's funhouse. The funhouse was designed to be a place where Scaramanga could get the upper hand by distracting the adversary with obstacles,&lt;ref name=hamilton/&gt; and was described by Murton as a "melting pot of ideas" which made it "both a funhouse and a horror house".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Peter Murton|title=The Man with the Golden Gun audio commentary|location=The Man with the Golden Gun Ultimate Edition, Disk 1|publisher=MGM Home Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; While an actual wax figure of Roger Moore was used, Moore's stunt double Les Crawford was the cowboy figure, and Ray Marione played the Al Capone figure. The [[cant (architecture)|canted]] sets such as the funhouse and the ''Queen Elizabeth'' had inspiration from [[German Expressionism]] films such as ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]''.&lt;ref name=comm/&gt; For Scaramanga's solar power plant, Hamilton used both the Pinewood set and a miniature projected by [[Derek Meddings]], often cutting between each other to show there was no discernible difference.&lt;ref name=hamilton/&gt; The destruction of the facility was a combination of practical effects on the set and a destruction of the miniature.&lt;ref name=inside/&gt; Meddings based the island blowing up on footage of the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Derek Meddings|title=The Man with the Golden Gun audio commentary|location=The Man with the Golden Gun Ultimate Edition, Disk 1|publisher=MGM Home Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Golden Gun prop====
[[File:The Golden Gun.jpg|thumb|right|The Golden Gun.|alt= A golden gun is held by a hand.]]
[[File:Golden Gun - International Spy Museum (14592496766).jpg|thumb|left|Scaramanga's Golden Gun]]
Three Golden Gun props were made; a solid piece, one that could be fired with a cap and one that could be assembled and disassembled, although Christopher Lee said that the process "was extremely difficult."&lt;ref name=empirelee/&gt; The gun was "one of the more memorable props in the Bond series"{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=114}} and consisted of an interlocking fountain pen (the barrel), cigarette lighter (the bullet chamber), cigarette case (the handle) and cufflink (the trigger) with the bullet secured in Scaramanga's belt buckle.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=103}} In the film, the gun was designed to accept a single 4.2-millimetre, 23-[[Carat (purity)|carat]] gold bullet produced by Lazar, a gunsmith in Macau who specialized in custom weapons and ammunition.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=235}} The Golden Gun ranked sixth in a 2008 [[20th Century Fox]] poll of the most popular film weapons, which surveyed approximately 2,000 film fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Sophie |last=Borland | title = Lightsabre wins the battle of movie weapons |work=The Daily Telegraph | date = 21 January 2008 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1576154/Lightsabre-wins-the-battle-of-movie-weapons.html | accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 October 2008, it was discovered that one of the golden guns used in the film, which is estimated to be worth around £80,000, was missing (suspected stolen) from [[Elstree Studios|Elstree Props]], a company based at Hertfordshire studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/3174163/James-Bond-golden-gun-stolen-from-Elstree-Studios.html | title=James Bond golden gun stolen from Elstree Studios |work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Stephen |last=Adams | accessdate=23 June 2009| location=London | date=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{Main|The Man with the Golden Gun (soundtrack)}}
The theme tune to ''The Man with the Golden Gun'', released in 1974, was performed by Scottish singer [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]] and composed by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]]. Tony Bramwell, who worked for Harry Saltzman's music publishing company Hilary Music, wanted [[Elton John]] or [[Cat Stevens]] to sing the title song. However, by this time the producers were taking turns producing the films; Albert Broccoli—whose turn it was to produce—rejected Bramwell's suggestions. The lyrics to the Lulu song were written by [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]] and have been described variously as "ludicrous",{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=103}} "inane"{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=215}} and "one long stream of smut", because of their [[Innuendo|sexual innuendo]].{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=92}} Bramwell subsequently dismissed the Barry-Lulu tune as "mundane".{{sfn|Bramwell|Kingsland|2006|p=368}}

[[Alice Cooper]] wrote a song titled "Man with the Golden Gun" to be used by the producers of the film, but they opted for Lulu's song instead. Cooper released his song in his album ''[[Muscle of Love]]''.{{sfn|Greene|1974|p=40}}

Barry had only three weeks to score ''The Man with the Golden Gun''{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=287}} and the theme tune and score are generally considered by critics to be among the weakest of Barry's contributions to the series, an opinion shared by Barry himself: "It's the one I hate most&amp;nbsp;... it just never happened for me."&lt;ref name="UKC4TV"&gt;{{cite video | people =Barry, John (interviewee) |year=2006 | title =James Bond's Greatest Hits | medium =Television | location =UK | publisher =North One Television}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' was also the first to drop the distinctive plucked guitar from the [[James Bond Theme|theme]] heard over the [[Gun barrel sequence (James Bond)|gun barrel opening]]. A sample from one of the songs, "Hip's Trip", was used by [[The Prodigy]] in the "Mindfields" track on the album ''[[The Fat of the Land]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/movies/tmwtgg_music.php3?t=tmwtgg&amp;s=tmwtgg Music – The Man With The Golden Gun].

The film was made with an estimated budget of $7 million; despite initial good returns from the box office,{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=116}} ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' grossed a total of $97.6 million at the worldwide box office,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Man with the Golden Gun|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1974/0MWGG.php|work=The Numbers|publisher=Nash Information Services, LLC.|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with $21 million earned in the USA, making it the fourth lowest-grossing Bond film in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Box Office History for James Bond Movies|url=http://the-numbers.com/movies/series/JamesBond.php|work=The Numbers|publisher=Nash Information Services, LLC.|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The promotion of the film had "one of the more anaemic advertising campaigns of the series"{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=103}} and there were few products available, apart from the soundtrack and paperback book, although [[Lone Star Toys]] produced a "James Bond 007 pistol" in gold; this differed from the weapon used by Scaramanga in the film as it was little more than a [[Walther P38]] with a silencer fitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Collectors' Gazette|date=July 2007|issue=280|pages=12, 13|title=Lone Star's 'Top Ten' Diecast guns|first=Geoffrey|last=Ambridge|url=http://lonestarproductsltduk.blogspot.com/2007/06/collectors-gazette-july-07-issue-lone.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary reviews===
''The Man with the Golden Gun'' met with mixed reviews upon its release. [[Derek Malcolm]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' savaged the film, saying that "the script is the limpest of the lot and&amp;nbsp;... Roger Moore as 007 is the last man on earth to make it sound better than it is."&lt;ref name="Malcolm (1974)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Malcolm|first=Derek|title=Rebel without a pause|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 December 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was some praise from Malcolm, although it was muted, saying that "Christopher Lee&amp;nbsp;... makes a goodish villain and Britt Ekland a passable Mary Goodnight&amp;nbsp;... Up to scratch in production values&amp;nbsp;... the film is otherwise merely a potboiler. Maybe enough's enough."&lt;ref name="Malcolm (1974)"/&gt; Tom Milne, writing in ''[[The Observer]]'', was even more caustic, writing that "This series, which has been scraping the bottom of the barrel for some time, is now through the bottom&amp;nbsp;... with depressing borrowings from Hong Kong kung fu movies, not to mention even more depressing echoes of the '[[Carry On (franchise)|Carry On]]' smut."&lt;ref name="Milne(1974)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Milne|first=Tom|title=From Badlands to Bond|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=22 December 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; He summed up the film by saying it was "sadly lacking in wit or imagination."&lt;ref name="Milne(1974)"/&gt;

[[David Robinson (film critic)|David Robinson]], the film critic at ''[[The Times]]'', dismissed the film and Moore's performance, saying that Moore was "substituting non-acting for Connery's throwaway", while Britt Ekland was "his beautiful, idiot side-kick&amp;nbsp;... the least appealing of the Bond heroines."&lt;ref name="Robinson(1974)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Robinson|first=David|title=A trip back to the forest of Dean|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=20 December 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson was equally damning of the changes in the production crew, observing that Ken Adam, an "attraction of the early Bond films," had been "replaced by decorators of competence but little of his flair."&lt;ref name="Robinson(1974)"/&gt; The writers "get progressively more naive in their creation of a suburban dream of epicureanism and adventure."&lt;ref name="Robinson(1974)"/&gt; Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Nora Sayre considered the film to suffer from "poverty of invention and excitement", criticising the writing and Moore's performance and finding Villechaize and Lee as the only positive points for their "sinister vitality that cuts through the narrative dough."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9401E6D91E31EF34BC4152DFB467838F669EDE|title=Movie Review – The Man with the Golden Gun – Film: James Bond and Energy Crisis|work=The New York Times|first=Nora|last=Sayre|date=19 December 1974|accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' critic observed that ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' "isn't the best Bond ever" but found it "remarkable that Messrs. Saltzman and Broccoli can still produce such slick and inventive entertainment".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Arthur Thirkwell, writing in the ''Sunday Mirror''{{'}}s sister paper, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' concentrated more on lead actor Roger Moore than the film itself: "What Sean Connery used to achieve with a touch of sardonic sadism, Roger Moore conveys with roguish schoolboy charm and the odd, dry quip."&lt;ref name="Thirkwell(1974)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Thirkwell|first=Arthur|title=It's Bond, shaky – but still stirring|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=18 December 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirkwell also said that Moore "manages to make even this reduced-voltage Bond a character with plenty of sparkle."&lt;ref name="Thirkwell(1974)"/&gt; Judith Crist of ''[[New York Magazine]]'' gave a positive review, saying "the scenery's grand, the lines nice and the gadgetry entertaining", also describing the production as a film that "capture[s] the free-wheeling, whooshing non-sense of early Fleming's fairy tale for grown-ups orientation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crist |first=Judith|title=Movies – All in the Family|journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=23 December 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jay Cocks]], writing in  ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', focused on gadgets such as Scaramanga's flying car, as what is wrong with both ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' and the more recent films in the Bond series, calling them "Overtricky, uninspired, these exercises show the strain of stretching fantasy well past wit."&lt;ref name="Cocks(1975)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cocks|first=Jay|title=Cinema: Water Pistols|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917047,00.html|accessdate=9 August 2011|newspaper= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=13 January 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cocks also criticised the actors, saying that Moore "lacks all Connery's strengths and has several deep deficiencies", while Lee was "an unusually unimpressive villain".&lt;ref name="Cocks(1975)"/&gt;

===Reflective reviews===
Opinion on ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' has for the most part remained the same as it was in 1974 and as of November 2015, the film holds a 45% rating from [[Rotten Tomatoes]] (although these contain contemporary reviews),&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/man_with_the_golden_gun/ | title=The Man with the Golden Gun | work= Rotten Tomatoes | accessdate=24 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Ian Freer of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' found the film "an entertaining 007 adventure, something that tonally, if not qualitatively, could happily sit within the Connery era."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134602 | title=The Man with the Golden Gun | work=Empire|first=Ian|last=Freer|date=13 October 2008 | accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[IGN]]'' chose ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' as the worst Bond film, claiming it "has a great concept&amp;nbsp;... but the execution is sloppy and silly",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/746/746573p1.html|title=James Bond's Top 20|publisher=IGN|date=17 November 2006|accessdate=21 December 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305105945/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/746/746573p1.html|archivedate=5 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' chose it as the fourth worst, saying that the "plot is almost as puny as the sidekick".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20431259_1560083,00.html |first1=Benjamin |last1=Svetkey |first2=Joshua |last2=Rich| title=James Bond: Ranking 21 films |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=14 November 2008 | accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Norman Wilner of [[MSN]] chose it as the tenth best, with much praise for Christopher Lee's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.sympatico.msn.ca/features/ArticleNormanWilner.aspx?cp-documentid=436189|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119210839/http://movies.sympatico.msn.ca/features/ArticleNormanWilner.aspx?cp-documentid=436189|archivedate=19 January 2008|title=Rating the Spy Game|publisher=MSN|author=Norman Wilner|accessdate=4 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics saw the film as uninspired, tired and boring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/m/man_golden.html |first=James |last=Berardinelli |authorlink=James Berardinelli |title=The Man with the Golden Gun|publisher=[[ReelViews]]|year=1996|accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Moore was also criticised for playing Bond against type, in a style more reminiscent of Sean Connery, although Lee's performance received acclaim. [[Danny Peary]] wrote that ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' "lacks invention&amp;nbsp;... is one of the least interesting Bond films" and "a very laboured movie, with Bond a stiff bore, Adams and Britt Ekland uninspired leading ladies".{{sfn|Peary|1986|p=264}} Peary believes that the shootout between Bond and Scaramanga in the funhouse "is the one good scene in the movie, and even it has an unsatisfying finish" and also bemoaned the presence of Clifton James, "unfortunately reprising his unfunny redneck sheriff from ''Live and Let Die.''"{{sfn|Peary|1986|p=264}}

Chris Nashawaty of ''Entertainment Weekly'' argues that Scaramanga is the best villain of the Roger Moore James Bond films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nashawaty|first=Chris|title=Moore&amp;nbsp;... and Sometimes Less|journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=12 December 2008|issue=1025|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20244432,00.html|accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while listing Mary Goodnight among the worst Bond girls, saying that "Ekland may have had one of the series' best bikinis, but her dopey, doltish portrayal was a turnoff as much to filmgoers as to fans of Ian Fleming's novels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6. Mary Goodnight (Britt Ekland)|date= 10 November 2006|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1557936,00.html |last=Rich |first=Joshua|work=10 worst Bond girls|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Times'' put Scaramanga as the fifth best Bond villain in their list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Plant|first=Brendan|title=Top 10 Bond villains|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/specials/for_your_eyes_only/article3660946.ece|accessdate=11 August 2011|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=1 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ekland was the third in their list of the top 10 most fashionable Bond girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Copping|first=Nicola|title=Top 10 most fashionable Bond girls|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/specials/for_your_eyes_only/article3628924.ece|accessdate=11 August 2011|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=1 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' listed Goodnight at fourth in their Top Bond Babes list, saying that "Agent Goodnight is the clumsiest spy alive. But who cares as long as she's using her perfect bikini bottom to muck things up?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maxim.com/amg/girls/girls-of-maxim/44096/top-bond-babes.html|title=The Top Bond Babes|work=[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]|accessdate=14 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917173055/http://www.maxim.com/amg/girls/girls-of-maxim/44096/top-bond-babes.html|archivedate=17 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7522">The ''' World English-Language Scrabble Players' Association ''' ('''WESPA''') is the overarching global body for English-language national [[Scrabble]] associations and similar entities.

== Formation ==

WESPA was formed in the course of a players' meeting at the [[World Scrabble Championship 2003|2003 World Scrabble Championship]]  in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and formally constituted on 17 November 2005 at its first Biennial General Meeting held in [[World Scrabble Championship 2005|London]]. BGMs are now held at each [[World Scrabble Championship]] (taking place every odd year), and there are currently 24 member organisations.

WESPA was created to represent the interests of international Scrabble competitors and national bodies worldwide. Its main functions are to promote global recognition of Scrabble as a serious competitive activity; to provide for the benefit of members in pursuing the game; to further the best interests of Scrabble and international tournament players; to represent such players in dealings with other bodies, including the trademark owners of the game; to promulgate and encourage international convergence towards common standards and norms (including international rules, word lists and ratings); to organise global competitions and events; to publish relevant material; and to maintain a website for the benefit of the game and its players.

The trademark for Scrabble is owned by [[Hasbro]] in North America and [[Mattel]] in the rest of the world.

Achievements to date have included the preparation of a set of international rules, the publication of a WESPA-endorsed word list which is valid for international tournament play, and the promulgation of international Scrabble ratings.

== Rules ==

Following a six-month worldwide consultation process, the first version of WESPA's rules for global Scrabble was released in August 2009. The rules were based on key elements of existing rules that were in force in various national associations, which were synthesised to create global best practice. Following feedback from their use in various international tournaments, extensive reviews took place prior to the issue of version two in November 2010, which was used at the [[World Scrabble Championship 2011|2011 World Scrabble Championship]] in Warsaw, Poland, and other international events such as the Causeway Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.causewayscrabble.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Version three was released in 2015.

A number of national associations have adopted WESPA rules for domestic use, including the [[Association of British Scrabble Players]].

== Word list ==

The word source currently in use for international play, known as [[Collins Scrabble Words]] or CSW (formerly Official Scrabble Words or OSW) is not derived from a single dictionary, but combines three components: [[Collins English Dictionary|Collins]] (7th edition, 2005), [[Chambers Dictionary|Chambers]] (1998 edition) and [[Official Tournament and Club Word List|TWL]], the current Northern American wordlist. TWL (Tournament Word List) is a subset of CSW, but is itself drawn from a range of sources, mostly different editions of [[Webster's Dictionary|Webster's]]. North American tournaments generally use TWL alone for domestic play, but all tournaments under the auspices of WESPA must use CSW.

The current word list (CSW15) came into force internationally on 1 September 2015, including updates from the most recent editions of original OSW sources as well as eliminating some inconsistencies in previous editions. CSW15 contains over 275,000 words in total (up to the theoretical maximum fifteen letters in length), of which around 119,000 are up to eight letters in length. By contrast, TWL holds approximately two thirds as many words in total. CSW is therefore substantially larger than TWL and has a more international flavour, including a number of local or dialect words from around the world.

== Ratings ==

International Scrabble ratings have been maintained since their inception by Bob Jackman in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], using a variant of the Australian ratings calculation system. All tournaments played to WESPA rules are able to be rated within the system, and regular updates are posted on the WESPA website. The first rated tournament in the system was the [[World Scrabble Championship 1993|1993 World Scrabble Championship]], which was held in New York.

== Tournaments ==

WESPA has established the criteria for running international Scrabble tournaments, and it is now mandatory for WESPA rules and the WESPA word list to be used. Tournament organisers are also required to pay a ratings levy on a fee per player basis, in order for the tournament to qualify for international rating.

The tournament committee oversees the calendar of international Scrabble events, and has also liaised with Mattel on a number of issues relating to the World Scrabble Championship (WSC), including the number of games to be played and the format of the finals. Furthermore, a country's allocated number of representatives may fluctuate for each WSC depending on the team performance in the previous event, and WESPA has ratified the formula&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wscgames.com/2011/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; for changes to team allocations. In short, after each event the participating countries are ranked according to the average individual finishing rank of their players; teams falling in the top half may be entitled to gain a player for next time, while teams in the bottom half may lose a player.

Following the establishment of Mind Sports International, the title '[[World Scrabble Championship]]' was claimed by that entity for official world titles (sanctioned by Mattel under licence). WESPA has undertaken to host biennial world events from 2015 onwards using the old WSC format, with teams qualifying from national organisations. The WESPA Championship 2015 was hosted in Perth, Australia, and the 2017 edition took place in Nairobi, Kenya.

== Youth Scrabble ==

The [[World Youth Scrabble Championships]], renamed WESPA Youth Cup for 2017 further to a naming issue with Mindsports Academy, have been organised annually since 2006 under the aegis of WESPA for players under 18 on qualification date. The Youth committee has also been active in promoting the game among young players worldwide, including training workshops held in various locations.

== Committee ==

The WESPA committee is made up of nominees representing member nations, and the current Chair is Elie Dangoor (UK). Various subcommittees are charged with matters such as promotions and communications, ratings and tournaments, rules, dictionary and youth.

The first Chair of WESPA was [[Allan Simmons]] (UK) who led the organisation from inception through to 2008. He was succeeded by [[Bahrain]]-based Roy Kietzmann, who died in 2009 prior to the appointment of Elie Dangoor.

== Other federations ==

WESPA has committee links with the two other major world Scrabble federations, FISF (Fédération Internationale de Scrabble Francophone)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fisf.net&lt;/ref&gt; and FISE (Federación Internacional de Scrabble en Español).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fisescrabble.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mailing list ==

The world-scrabble mailing list&lt;ref&gt;http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/world-scrabble/&lt;/ref&gt; discusses international Scrabble matters and WESPA issues.
