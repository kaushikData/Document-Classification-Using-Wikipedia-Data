'''6 Burlington Gardens''' is a [[Listed building|Grade II*-listed]] building in [[Mayfair]], [[London]]. Built for the [[University of London]], it has been used by various institutions in the course of its history, including the [[Civil Service Commission (United Kingdom)|Civil Service Commission]],  the [[British Museum]] and, currently, the [[Royal Academy of Arts]].

===University of London and the Civil Service Commission===
The [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] building was designed by Sir [[James Pennethorne]] between 1867 and 1870 as headquarters for the University of London. It occupied the northernmost section of the former garden of [[Burlington House]]. It was a grand building, but not especially large. The University of London is a federal university and this early central building contained little besides examination halls and a few offices; the premises of several of the constituent colleges were larger. The university vacated Burlington Gardens in 1900 for the [[Commonwealth Institute|Imperial Institute]] building in South Kensington. Briefly the headquarters of the [[Discovery expedition|National Antarctic Expedition]], in 1902 it was given to the Civil Service Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41484 |title=The University of London at No. 6 Burlington Gardens |editor-first=F. H. W. |editor-last=Sheppard |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |date=1963 |work=Survey of London: volumes 31 and 32: St James Westminster, Part 2 |accessdate=6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum of Mankind===
In 1970, this was the site of the Department of [[Ethnography]] of the [[British Museum]], which housed its collections from the Americas, Africa, the Pacific and Australia, as well as tribal Asia and Europe, because of lack of space in the Museum's main building in [[Bloomsbury]]. Between 1970 and 1997, the building, as the Museum of Mankind, hosted around 75 exhibitions, including many famous ones such as ''Nomad and City'', 1976, and ''Living Arctic'', 1987. It was created by Keeper of Ethnography Adrian Digby in the 1960s, and opened by his successor William Fagg. Fagg was succeeded by Malcolm Mcleod in 1974, and by John Mack in 1990. The museum ceased exhibiting at Burlington Gardens in 1997 and the Department of Ethnography moved back to the British Museum in Bloomsbury in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/africa,_oceania_and_americas/history_of_the_collection.aspx Africa, Oceania, Americas: History of the collection], British Museum, Retrieved 19 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal Academy and private tenants===

After the ethnography collection’s return to Bloomsbury the building was purchased by the Royal Academy. In 1998 an architectural competition was held to connect it with Burlington House, which was won by [[Michael Hopkins (architect)|Michael Hopkins]] &amp; Partners. This was abandoned as the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] was not persuaded that there was sufficient need for the project, which would have cost £80 million.&lt;ref name="BD"&gt;{{cite news|first=Ellis|last=Woodman|title=6 Burlington Gardens by David Chipperfield|url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/buildings/6-burlington-gardens-by-david-chipperfield/5043683.article|work=[[Building Design]]|date=5 October 2012|accessdate=5 February 2013}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In about 2005 the building was brought back into use by the Royal Academy, the tenant of the original wing of Burlington House and the wing which lies between the two buildings. It was used mainly by the Royal Academy Schools. On 29 August 2006, the building was damaged by a fire, but there was no loss of Academy artworks as it was being prepared for a future exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/5295874.stm?ls|title=Royal Academy evacuated in fire|date=29 August 2006|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giampietrino-Last-Supper-ca-1520.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Giampietrino’s copy of Leonardo’s ''Last Supper'', which will be housed in the building after redevelopment]]

In 2006 [[Colin St John Wilson]] drew up a masterplan for the whole complex, which included a more modest link between the buildings than that proposed by Hopkins. However, Wilson died the following year, which led to another competition being held in 2008, won by [[David Chipperfield]] Architects. In order to raise capital for Chipperfield’s design, the building was lent to the commercial gallery [[Haunch of Venison]], which occupied the site from 2009 to 2011 while their existing building was being renovated. In 2012 space in the building was lent to the [[Pace Gallery]], which will occupy it on a 15-year lease.&lt;ref name="BD"/&gt; A second application to the HLF for £12.7m to go towards a £36 million project, was successful in 2013.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/nov/08/royal-academy-arts-lottery-redevelopment|last=Brown|first=Mark|title=Royal Academy of Arts secures £12.7m lottery funds for redevelopment|work=The Guardian|date=8 November 2013|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will include a sculpture court in the bridge between the buildings, a lecture hall where that of the University of London originally stood&lt;ref name="BD"/&gt; and a permanent home for [[Giampietrino]]’s full-size copy of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]’s ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Last Supper]]''. The redevelopment was completed in 2018, in time for the Academy’s 250th anniversary in 2018.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

'''BBC Information and Archives''' (sometimes known just as '''BBC Archives''') are collections documenting the [[BBC]]'s broadcasting history, including copies of [[BBC Television|television]] and [[BBC Radio|radio]] broadcasts, internal documents, photographs, [[BBC Online|online]] content, [[sheet music]], commercially available music, press cuttings and historic equipment.&lt;ref name="BBCArchive TV 1"/&gt; The original copies of these collections are permanently retained but are now in the process of being digitised, estimated to take until approximately 2015. Some collections are now being uploaded onto the BBC Archives website on [[BBC Online]] for viewers to see. The archive is one of the largest broadcast archives in the world with over 12 million items.&lt;ref name=Perivale1&gt;{{cite web|last=Hayes|first=Sarah|title=The new BBC Archive Centre in Perivale|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/aboutthebbc/2011/10/the-new-bbc-archive-centre-at.shtml|work=About the BBC Blog|publisher=BBC Online|accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The BBC Archives encompass numerous different archives containing different materials produced or acquired by the BBC. The earliest material dates back to 1890 and now consists of 1 million hours of playable material, in addition to documents, photographs and equipment.&lt;ref name="gutechweekly"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kiss |first=Jemima |title=In The BBC Archive |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/audio/2010/aug/18/bbc-archive-roly-keating-windmill-road |work=Tech Weekly |publisher=Guardian News &amp; Media Ltd |accessdate=21 August 2010 |location=London |date=18 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821165828/http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/audio/2010/aug/18/bbc-archive-roly-keating-windmill-road |archivedate=21 August 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The archives contain 12 million items on 66 miles of shelving spread over several sites.&lt;ref name=gutechweekly /&gt; The stock is managed using a [[bar code]] system, which help to locate material on the shelves and also track material that has been lent out.&lt;ref name=gutechweekly /&gt; The BBC says that the budget for managing, protecting and digitising the archive accounts for only a small part of the BBC's overall spend.&lt;ref name=gutechweekly /&gt;

The BBC is engaging in an ongoing project to [[Digital reformatting|digitise]] archived programme material, converting recordings made on older [[Analog recording|analogue formats]] such as audio tape, [[videotape]] and film to electronic formats which are compatible with modern computer systems. Much of the audio-visual material was originally recorded on formats which are now obsolete and incompatible with modern broadcast equipment due to the fact that the machines used to reproduce many formats are no longer being manufactured. Additionally, some film and audio formats are slowly disintegrating, and digitisation also serves as a [[digital preservation]] programme. As of summer 2010 BBC Archive staff have spent approximately ten years digitising half of the media content&lt;ref name=gutechweekly /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Archive BBCInternetblog"/&gt; and due to improving work practices expect to complete the other half in five years. Current estimates suggest the digitised archive would comprise approximately 52 [[petabyte]]s of information,&lt;ref name=gutechweekly /&gt; with one programme minute of video requiring 1.4 [[gigabyte]]s of storage.&lt;ref name=gutechweekly /&gt; The BBC uses the [[Material Exchange Format]] (MXF)&lt;ref name=gutechweekly /&gt; which is an uncompressed, non-proprietary format which the BBC has been publicising to mitigate the threat of the format becoming obsolete (as digital formats can and do).&lt;ref name=gutechweekly /&gt;

The Archive digitisation a key part of the BBC's programme to engineer a fully digital and [[tapeless|tapeless production workflow]] across the entire Corporation. It was closely tied in with the ill-fated [[Digital Media Initiative]] (DMI), a scheme which ran from 2008 to 2013 and attempted to create a unified online archive search and programme production system.&lt;ref name=bbc-dmi&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Media Initiative|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/careers/divisions/digital-media-initiative|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310041000/http://www.bbc.co.uk/careers/divisions/digital-media-initiative|archivedate=10 March 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spiralling development costs and project delays, the problems with DMI came to public attention during coverage of the [[death and funeral of Margaret Thatcher]] in April 2013, when it was reported that the lack of digital ingest facilities provided for [[BBC News]] staff meant that tapes had to be sent by taxi from the Perivale centre to be digitised by independent companies in central London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC's Thatcher coverage highlights problems with non-digital archives|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/11/bbc-thatcher-coverage|accessdate=3 May 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 February 2012|location=London|first=Tara|last=Conlan}}&lt;/ref&gt; DMI was cancelled in 2013.&lt;ref name=bbc_abandons&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC abandons £100m digital project|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22651126|accessdate=25 May 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC Archive website was relaunched online in 2008 and has provided newly released historical material regularly since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sangster|first=Jim|title=A new homepage for BBC Archive|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2010/05/a_new_homepage_for_bbc_archive.html|work=BBC Internet Blog|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC works in partnership with the [[British Film Institute]] (BFI), [[The National Archives]] and other partners in working with and using the materials.&lt;ref name=gutechweekly /&gt; A related project called "Genome" is expected to complete in 2011 and will make programme listings dating back to 1923, sourced from ''[[The Radio Times]]'', available to search online.&lt;ref name=gutechweekly /&gt;

In July 2008, [[Roly Keating]] was appointed Director of Archive Content,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/07_july/22/archive.shtml |title=Roly Keating appointed as Director of Archive Content |publisher=BBC Press Office|date=22 July 2008 |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with responsibility for increasing public access to the BBC’s archives. In October 2008, Keating appointed [[Tony Ageh]] Controller of Archive Development with "specific responsibility for developing ways of making the archive easily understandable and accessible to users".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/10_october/10/ageh.shtml|publisher=BBC Press Office|date=10 October 2008|accessdate=1 July 2011|title=Tony Ageh appointed Controller of Archive Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, BBC Archive Development produced a book - primarily aimed as BBC staff - titled 'BBC Archive Collections: What's In The Archive And How To Use Them'.&lt;ref&gt;'BBC Archive Collections: What's In The Archives, And How To Use Them' Edited by Jake Berger https://www.dropbox.com/s/rz1o57nzlsf1v04/BBC%20Archive%20Collections%20Guide%202012.pdf?dl=0&lt;/ref&gt;  This book describes the BBC's archive collections and offers guidance around on how items from the collections can be reused online.  The book's references to 'Fabric', a system due to be delivered by the [[Digital Media Initiative]] are no longer accurate as the project was cancelled.

==Buildings==
From 1963 to 2010, the majority of television material of nationally networked programmes in the BBC Archive were housed at the Archive centre in Windmill Road, [[Brentford]], in [[W postcode area|west London]].&lt;ref name=Perivale1/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Archive BBCInternetblog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perivale 2 AtBBCblog"/&gt; Television programmes were also stored by the Open University in Milton Keynes, and by BBC NATIONAL and REGIONAL libraries around the country. In the late 1990s, and early in the 2000s material from the radio side of the BBC were also stored on the site. The condition of the three Windmill Road buildings deteriorated over the years and suffered occasional flooding incidents, and eventually the Archive was relocated to a new centre at Perivale Park, [[Perivale]], three miles north of the old site.&lt;ref name="Perivale 2 AtBBCblog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perivale Centre R4 Blog"/&gt; The new BBC Archive Centre was opened in Summer 2010 and all material was successfully moved by March 2011.&lt;ref name="Perivale 2 AtBBCblog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perivale 3 S&amp;Pblog"/&gt; The cost of the refurbishment and of the move was approximately £16.6 million.&lt;ref name=Perivale1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perivale 2 AtBBCblog"&gt;{{cite news|last=Skinner|first=Peter|title=A new home for the BBC Archive|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/aboutthebbc/2010/08/a-warm-balmy-afternoon-in.shtml|accessdate=19 January 2012|newspaper=BBC About the BBC Blog|date=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perivale Centre R4 Blog"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bolton|first=Roger|title=Tears in Perivale – Feedback in the archives|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/2011/09/tears_in_perivale_feedback_in_the_archives.html|accessdate=19 January 2012|newspaper=BBC Radio 4 and 4 Extra Blog|date=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perivale 3 S&amp;Pblog"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kane|first=Chris|title=Preserving the past at Perivale|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/spacesandplaces/2011/03/preserving_the_past_at_perival.shtml|accessdate=19 January 2012|newspaper=BBC Spaces &amp; Places Blog|date=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/foi/classes/disclosure_logs/rfi20111170_cost_of_new_archive_centre.pdf|title=Freedom of Information Act 2000 – RFI20111170|last=Jupe|first=Steve|date=20 October 2011|work=Freedom of Information Request|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The BBC Archive Centre has moved|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/news/the-bbc-archive-centre-has-moved.shtml|work=BBC Commissioning|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Material is stored in thirteen vaults,&lt;ref name="Perivale 2 AtBBCblog"/&gt; controlled to match the best climate for the material inside them,&lt;ref name=Perivale1/&gt;&lt;ref name=gutechweekly /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Archive BBCInternetblog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perivale 2 AtBBCblog"/&gt; and named after a different BBC personality depending on the content contained in them.&lt;ref name="Perivale 2 AtBBCblog"/&gt; In addition to the vaults, new editing and workrooms have been added so that the material can easily be transferred between formats as well as viewed and restored.&lt;ref name="Perivale 2 AtBBCblog"/&gt; The building has also been fitted with fire suppression systems to protect the archive in the event of an incident at the centre, so the total loss of the archive is avoided.&lt;ref name="Perivale Centre R4 Blog"/&gt;

The '''BBC Television Archive''' contains over 600,000 hours of television broadcast material&lt;ref name="BBCArchive TV 1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Adam|title=BBC Television Archive – What's in the BBC Archive|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/tv_archive.shtml|work=BBC Archive – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; located on 600,000/650,000 film reels&lt;ref name="Windmill Road"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Tour of the BBC Archive at Windmill Road|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3Z2djrAW2M|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=23 July 2015|date=13 Aug 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Archive BBCInternetblog"&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Adrian|title=Safeguarding the BBC's archive|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2010/08/safeguarding_the_bbcs_archive.html|accessdate=19 January 2012|newspaper=BBC Internet Blog|date=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCArchive PTV 4"&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Adrian|title=Preserving the Television Archive – Film|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/preserving.shtml?chapter=4|work=BBC Archives – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2.4/2.7 million videotapes.&lt;ref name="BBC Archive BBCInternetblog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Windmill Road"/&gt; The archive itself holds extensive material from approximately the mid-1970s onwards, when important recordings at the broadcaster were retained for the future.&lt;ref name="BBCArchives TV 6"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Adam|title=BBC Television Archive – When did the BBC start to ensure that important broadcasts were not destroyed|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/tv_archive.shtml?chapter=6|work=BBC Archives – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recordings from before this date are less comprehensively preserved; the process of [[Kinescope|telerecording]] was originally invented in 1947&lt;ref name="BBCArchive TV 2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Adam|title=BBC Television Archive – Why aren't there many recordings from the early days of television|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/tv_archive.shtml?chapter=2|work=BBC Archive – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while videotape recording was gradually introduced from the late 1950s onwards,&lt;ref name="BBC Archive TV 4"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Adam|title=BBC Television Archive – When did the BBC start recording programmes regularly|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/tv_archive.shtml?chapter=4|work=BBC Archive – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but due to the expense of the tapes,&lt;ref name="BBCArchives PTV 8"&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Adrian|title=Preserving the Television Archive – Why was videotape invented|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/preserving.shtml?chapter=8|work=BBC Archives – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; recording was seen for production use only with recordings subsequently being [[wiping|wiped]].&lt;ref name="BBC Archive TV 4"/&gt; or telerecordings being junked. The exceptions in the early years were usually occasions of great importance, such as the [[coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref name="BBCArchive TV 2"/&gt; In addition, numerous programmes at the time were broadcast 'live' and so utilised no recording procedure in the production process.&lt;ref name="BBCArchive TV 2"/&gt; The earliest item in the collection is from 1936.&lt;ref name="BBC Archive BBCInternetblog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perivale 3 S&amp;Pblog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCArchives PTV 6"&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Adrian|title=Preserving the Television Archive – The oldest BBC Television film clip|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/preserving.shtml?chapter=6|work=BBC Archives – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 there were 340,000 [[D-3_(video)|D3]] Tapes but the hardware they have could only transfer up to 130,000 D3 tapes.&lt;ref name=Digitising&gt;{{cite web|title=Digitising the BBC archive|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/technology/article/art20130704121742520|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=23 July 2015|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC has had to be very selective of what they are transferring.&lt;ref name=Digitising/&gt;

Before anything is put into the archive a team of Digitisation Operators watch and listen to programs looking for problems with the tapes or transfers.&lt;ref name="Sarah Bello"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sarah Bello, BBC Archive|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyG1lSdsKQs|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=23 July 2015|date=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today, the majority of programmes are kept, including news, entertainment, drama and a selection of other long-running programmes such as quiz shows.&lt;ref name="BBCArchive TV 7"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Adam|title=BBC Television Archive – How does the BBC decide what to keep in its archive today|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/tv_archive.shtml?chapter=7|work=BBC Archive – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining material from the television archive is offered to the [[British Film Institute]] prior to being disposed of.&lt;ref name="BBCArchive TV 8"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Adam|title=BBC Television Archive – Does the BBC offer recordings it's not keeping for the archive to anyone else|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/tv_archive.shtml?chapter=8|work=BBC Archives – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 5 April 2017 there are around 850,000 tapes in the videotape vault.

==Sound Archive==
{{main|BBC Sound Archive}}

The '''BBC Sound Archive''' contains the archived output from the BBC's radio output. Widespread recordings exist in the archive from the mid-1930s, when recording of programmes and speeches were kept for rebroadcast; the catalyst for this was the launch of the [[BBC Empire Service]] in 1932 and the subsequent rebroadcast of speeches from political leaders at a time convenient in the different time zones.&lt;ref name="BBCArchive - Radio 3"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rooks|first=Simon|title=BBC Sound Archive – Why did the BBC start making recordings|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/sound_archive.shtml?chapter=3|work=BBC Archives – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, the broadcast of recordings was seen as being false to the listener and was avoided.&lt;ref name="BBCArchives Radio 2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rooks|first=Simon|title=BBC Sound Archive – Why aren't there many recordings from the early days of radio|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/sound_archive.shtml?chapter=2|work=BBC Archives – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any recordings made were frequently disposed of and it was the efforts of [[Marie Slocombe]], who founded the Sound Archive in 1937 when she retained recordings of prominent figures in the country, that the archive became into being officially when she was appointed the Sounds Recording Librarian in 1941.&lt;ref name="BBCArchives - PRadio 6"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weaver|first=Julia|title=Preserving the Sound Archive – How did the Sound Archive begin|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/preserving_sound.shtml?chapter=6|work=BBC Archives – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, all of the BBC's radio output is recorded for re-use,&lt;ref name="BBCArchive - Radio 8"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rooks|first=Simon|title=BBC Sound Archive – Does the BBC keep copies of all programmes today|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/sound_archive.shtml?chapter=8|work=BBC Archives – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with approximately 66% of output being preserved in the Archives;&lt;ref name="BBCArchive - Radio 8"/&gt; programmes involving guests or live performances from artists are kept&lt;ref name="BBCArchive - Radio 8"/&gt; whereas programmes in which the DJ plays commercially available music are only sampled and not kept entirely.&lt;ref name="BBCArchive - Radio 8"/&gt; Prior to any material being disposed of, the material is offered to the [[British Library Sound Archive]].&lt;ref name="BBCArchive TV 8"/&gt;

The archive consists of a number of different formats including 200 [[Phonograph cylinder|wax cylinders]],&lt;ref name="BBCArchive - PRadio 3"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weaver|first=Julia|title=Preserving the Sound Archive – What are the earliest sound recordings|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/preserving_sound.shtml?chapter=3|work=BBC Archives – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; numerous [[gramophone record]]s made from both [[shellac]] and [[Gramophone record|vinyl]]&lt;ref name="BBCArchives - PRadio 4"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weaver|first=Julia|title=Preserving the Sound Archive – Discs|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/preserving_sound.shtml?chapter=4|work=BBC Archives – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as numerous more recordings on [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|tape]], CD and on [[digital audio tape]] (DAT).&lt;ref name="BBCArchive PRadio 5"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weaver|first=Julia|title=Preserving the Sound Archive – Tape|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/preserving_sound.shtml?chapter=5|work=BBC Archives – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty of these different formats is the availability of the machines required to play them; some of the vinyl records in the archive are 16 inches in size and require large [[phonograph]] units to play,&lt;ref name="BBCArchives - PRadio 4"/&gt; while the players for the wax cylinders and DATs are no longer in production.&lt;ref name="BBCArchive PRadio 5"/&gt; There are 700,00 vinyl records, 180,000 78's records, 400,000 [[LP record]] and 350,000 [[Compact disc|Cd's]] in the archive.&lt;ref name="Windmill Road"/&gt;

The oldest item is a wax cylinder containing a recording made by [[Florence Nightingale]], recorded on 30 July 1890.&lt;ref name="BBCArchive - PRadio 3"/&gt; Another unique item is the gramophone record from [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]'s [[doll house]], which is approximately an inch in size and had the [[God Save the Queen|national anthem]] on it.&lt;ref name="BBCArchives - PRadio 4"/&gt;

The Sound Archive is based at the new BBC Archive Centre in Perivale, along with the television archive,&lt;ref name=Perivale1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perivale 3 S&amp;Pblog"/&gt; and was previously based at Windmill Road, Brentford.

==Written Archives==
The '''BBC Written Archive''' contains all the internal written documents and communications from the corporation from the launch in 1922 to the present day.&lt;ref name="Written Archives BBC Story"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Written Archives|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/contacts/wac.shtml|work=The BBC Story|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCArchive Written 1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kavanagh|first=Jacquie|title=BBC Written Archives – What are the BBC Written Archives|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/written.shtml|work=BBC Archives – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its collections shed light into the behind the scenes workings of the corporation and also elaborate on the difficulties of getting a television or radio programme to or off the air as the case may be.&lt;ref name="BBC Archive Written 3"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kavanagh|first=Jacquie|title=BBC Written Archives – What do the documents reveal|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/written.shtml?chapter=3|work=BBC Archives – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archive guidelines state that access to files post-1980 is restricted due to the current nature of the files; the general exception to this rule are documents such as scripts and Programme as Broadcast records.

The Written Archives are located at the BBC Written Archive Centre in [[Caversham, Berkshire]], near [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]].&lt;ref name="Written Archives BBC Story"/&gt; The centre houses the archive on four and a half miles of shelving along with reading rooms. The centre is different from the other BBC Archives in that the centre opens for writers and academic researchers in higher education.&lt;ref name="Written Archives BBC Story"/&gt;

==Photographic Library==
The '''BBC Photographic Library''' is responsible for approximately 10 million images,&lt;ref name="BBCArchive Photo 1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dewar|first=Natalie|title=Photographic Library – What's in the BBC Photo Library|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/photo_library.shtml|work=BBC Archives – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; dating back to 1922,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Pictures|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/pictures/index.html|work=BBC Media Centre|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; created for publicity purposes and subsequently kept for future use.&lt;ref name="BBCArchive Photo 2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dewar|first=Natalie|title=Photographic Library – Why does the BBC have photographs|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/photo_library.shtml?chapter=2|work=BBC Archives – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to programme promotion, a large number of images are of historic events which are often incorporate into the daily news bulletins; as a result, half the photographic library team work specifically with these images.&lt;ref name="BBCArchive Photo 4"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dewar|first=Natalie|title=Photographic Library – The Team|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/photo_library.shtml?chapter=4|work=BBC Archives – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The images themselves are kept as originals in the archive, with digitisation only utilised when a specific image is required for use, when the image is sent in a digital format.&lt;ref name="BBCArchive Photo 5"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dewar|first=Natalie|title=Photographic Library – What format are the images stored on|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/photo_library.shtml?chapter=5|work=BBC Archives – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of images are also used in case any images are damaged, notable due to [[vinegar syndrome]].&lt;ref name="BBCArchive Photo 6"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dewar|first=Natalie|title=Photographic Library – Preservation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/photo_library.shtml?chapter=6|work=BBC Archives – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC 

The most popular images from the Archive include [[Colin Firth]] in ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV series)|Pride and Prejudice]]'', [[Michael Parkinson]] interviewing [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Martin Bashir]] interviewing [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] and a picture of [[Delia Derbyshire]] at work in the Radiophonic workshop at the BBC.&lt;ref name="BBCArchive Photo 8"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dewar|first=Natalie|title=Photographic Library – Our Top 10|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/photo_library.shtml?chapter=8|work=BBC Archive – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heritage Collection==
The '''BBC Heritage Collection''' is the newest of the BBC Archives and holds a variety of historic broadcast technology, art, props and merchandise.&lt;ref name="BBCArchives Heritage 2"&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connell|first=Rory|title=BBC Heritage Collection – Where do the items come from|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/heritage.shtml?chapter=2|work=BBC Archives – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection was created out of personal collections and bequeaths by former staff members, as the BBC had no formal policy on the heritage collection until c.2003.&lt;ref name="BBCArchives Heritage 2"/&gt;

The collection includes, amongst other items, the BBC One Noddy Globe and clock,&lt;ref name="BBCArchive Heritage 3"&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connell|first=Rory|title=BBC Heritage Collection – Broadcast technology|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/heritage.shtml?chapter=3|work=BBC Archives – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[BBC-Marconi Type A]] microphone,&lt;ref name="BBCArchive Heritage 3"/&gt; an early [[crystal radio]] made by the [[British Broadcasting Company]],&lt;ref name="BBCArchive Heritage 3"/&gt; a [[405-line television system|Marconi/EMI camera]] used in the early [[BBC Television]] experiments,&lt;ref name="BBCArchive Heritage 3"/&gt; a [[BBC Micro]] computer&lt;ref name="BBCArchive Heritage 3"/&gt; and a selection of items used to create [[Foley (filmmaking)|Foley]].&lt;ref name="BBCArchive Heritage 3"/&gt; In addition to all the broadcast technology, art is also kept, namely the portraits of all the BBC [[Director-General of the BBC|Director General]]s,&lt;ref name="BBCArchive Heritage 4"&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connell|first=Rory|title=BBC Heritage Collection – Art|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/heritage.shtml?chapter=4|work=BBC Archives – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as props including an original [[TARDIS]] from ''[[Doctor Who]]''&lt;ref name="BBCArchive Heritage 5"&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connell|first=Rory|title=BBC Heritage Collection – Costumes and Props|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/heritage.shtml?chapter=5|work=BBC Archives – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the children's television puppet [[Gordon the Gopher]].&lt;ref name="BBCArchive Heritage 5"/&gt;

The heritage collection itself has no one permanent home, as the majority of objects are on display, either around BBC properties or on loan to museums or other collections; the most notable museum housing the collection is the [[National Science and Media Museum]] in [[Bradford]].&lt;ref name="BBCArchive Heritage 8"&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connell|first=Rory|title=BBC Heritage Collection – Where can I see items from the collection|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/heritage.shtml?chapter=8|work=BBC Archives – Meet the experts|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archive Treasure Hunt==
At the turn of the millennium, the BBC launched the '''BBC Archive Treasure Hunt''', a public appeal to recover pre-1980s lost BBC radio and television productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/treasurehunt/about/about.shtml |title=BBC Online – Cult – Treasure Hunt – About the Campaign |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=30 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100721235531/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/treasurehunt/about/about.shtml| archivedate= 21 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Original material, featuring several popular programmes were lost due to the practice of [[wiping]], because of copyright issues and for technological reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/treasurehunt/about/lost.shtml |title=BBC Online – Cult – Treasure Hunt – About the Campaign |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=30 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stuart Douglas - www.thiswaydown.org |url=http://www.btinternet.com/~m.brown1/bbchunt.htm |title=missing episodes articles |publisher=Btinternet.com |date=7 July 1965 |accessdate=30 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100814103420/http://www.btinternet.com/~m.brown1/bbchunt.htm| archivedate= 14 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resolution of this appeal was that over one hundred productions were recovered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fiatifta.org/aboutfiat/news/old/2001/2001-04/03.light.html |title=No 4 2001 – Missing Believed Wiped |publisher=Fiat/Ifta |date= |accessdate=30 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100716032923/http://fiatifta.org/aboutfiat/news/old/2001/2001-04/03.light.html| archivedate= 16 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; including ''[[The Men from the Ministry]]'', ''[[Something to Shout About (film)|Something To Shout About]]'', ''[[Man and Superman]]'', ''[[The Doctor's Dilemma (play)|The Doctor's Dilemma]]'', ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'', ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]'', ''[[I'm Sorry, I Haven't A Clue]]'' and ''[[The Ronnie Corbett Thing]]'' in addition to recording sessions with [[Elton John]], [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Paul Simon]].&lt;ref name="BBCTH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/treasurehunt/about/listoffinds.shtml |title=BBC Online – Cult – Treasure Hunt – List of Finds |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=30 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/motion-pictures/4848337-1.html |title='hunt' Unearths BBC Treasures From Radio, Tv &amp;#124; Business solutions from |publisher=AllBusiness.com |date=9 November 2001 |accessdate=30 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Peter Sellers Estate Collection donated numerous recordings featuring [[Peter Sellers]].&lt;ref name="BBCTH"/&gt;

==Creative Archive Licence==
The BBC together with the [[British Film Institute]], the [[Open University]], [[Channel 4]] and [[Teachers' TV]] formed a collaboration, named the Creative Archive Licence Group, to create a copyright licence for the re-release of archived material.&lt;ref name=CAL&gt;{{cite web|title=Creative Archive pilot|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/creativearchive/|publisher=BBC|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Licence was a trial, launched in 2005, and notable for the re-release of part of the [[BBC News]]' archive and programmes made by the [[BBC Natural History Unit]] for creative use by the public. While artists and teachers were encouraged to use the content to create works of their own, the terms of the licence were restrictive compared to [[copyleft]] licences. Use of Creative Archive content for commercial, "endorsement, campaigning, defamatory or derogatory purposes" was forbidden, any derivative works were to be released under the same licence, and content was only  to be used within the UK.&lt;ref name=CAL/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creative Archive Licence|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/help/4527506.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial ended in 2006 following a review by the [[BBC Trust]] and works released under the licence were withdrawn.&lt;ref name=CAL/&gt;

==Voices from the Archives==
Voices from the Archives was a former [[BBC]] project, launched in partnership with [[BBC Four]] that provided free access to audio interviews with various notable people and professions from a variety of political, religious and social backgrounds. The website ceased to be updated in June 2005, and the concept was instead adopted by [[BBC Radio 4]] as a collection of film interviews from various programmes.

==Programme Catalogue==
{{main|BBC Programme Catalogue}}
Over the years, the BBC has used various programme catalogue databases to keep a record of the programmes in the archives. Internal databases include [[Infax]] and [[BBC Fabric|Fabric]], and publicly accessible databases include [[BBC Genome]] and [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes BBC Programmes].

|title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |editor=Sirajul Islam and Ahmed A. Jamal |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]] |year=2012 |edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Banglapedia'' was not designed as a general encyclopedia but as a specialized encyclopedia on Bangladesh-related topics.&lt;ref name="StarM"/&gt; For the encyclopedia's purposes, Bangladesh is defined as the territory comprising ancient Eastern India, [[Suba Bangla]], [[Shahi Bangalah]], [[Bengal Subah|Mughal Suba Bangla]], [[Bengal Presidency]], Bengal Province, [[East Bengal]], [[East Pakistan]], and the independent Bangladesh, in historical succession.&lt;ref name="holiday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="preface"/&gt;

The encyclopedia's chief editor is [[Sirajul Islam]].&lt;ref name="makinghistory"/&gt; Over 1200 writers and specialists in Bangladesh and abroad helped create the entries.&lt;ref name=SDNP/&gt;&lt;ref name="holiday"/&gt; ''Banglapedia'' has over 5,700 entries in six editorial categories,&lt;ref name=CDR/&gt; each of which is overseen by an expert editor,&lt;ref name=SDNP/&gt;&lt;ref name="holiday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="preface"/&gt; as well as over 2,000 single and four-colour [[illustration]]s and 2,100 cross-references.&lt;ref name=SDNP/&gt;&lt;ref name="holiday"/&gt;

The project was funded by the Bangladeshi government, private sector organizations, academic institutes and [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref name=SDNP/&gt;&lt;ref name="StarM"/&gt; Though its original budget was 800,000 [[Bangladeshi taka|taka]] (roughly 10,000 USD), the Asiatic Society eventually spent 80 million taka (roughly 1 million USD) on the project.&lt;ref name=accu/&gt;&lt;ref name=SDNP/&gt;&lt;ref name="makinghistory"/&gt; Despite controversies over entries on the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] and [[indigenous people]], both the Bengali and English versions became popular upon publication.&lt;ref name="holiday"/&gt;

==Development==
The ''Banglapedia'' project originated when the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh was working on a three-volume study titled ''History of Bangladesh, 1704-1971'' in 1991. The editors felt the need for a standard desk reference, as that project progressed laboriously, culling facts from various libraries. The idea finally led to a concept paper prepared by Sirajul Islam and his colleagues and submitted to the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh in early 1994. The ''Banglapedia'' project was formally adopted on 19 February 1997, and Islam was appointed project director and chief editor. As the head of the Project Implementation Committee, his task was to plan and manage the project funding.&lt;ref name="StarM"&gt;{{cite news | last = Zaman | first = Mustafa |author2=Ahsan, Shamim | title = The Banglapedia and its Making | work = Star Magazine | publisher = The Daily Star | date = 2003-09-02 | url = http://archive.thedailystar.net/magazine/2003/09/02/coverstory.htm | accessdate = 2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, some three dozen committees were formed with three to four people in each committee to recommend the entries. Twenty-seven thousand entries were proposed, requiring a 20 volume compendium. Because of financial constraints, the number of entries was cut down to around 6,000.&lt;ref name="makinghistory"/&gt; The project officially took off in 1998.&lt;ref name="StarM"/&gt;

When the project began, the Society had only eight hundred thousand [[Bangladeshi taka|taka]] in its coffers for the project. ''Banglapedia'' raised further contributions from universities, banks, multinational companies, international organisations and even private individuals.&lt;ref name="makinghistory"/&gt; A pool of agencies, including [[UNESCO]], the [[University Grants Commission (Bangladesh)|University Grants Commission]], universities, financial institutions and NGOs initially financed the project, which was completed at a cost of taka 80 million.&lt;ref name=accu/&gt;&lt;ref name=accu/&gt;&lt;ref name=SDNP/&gt; Education Ministry funded about 74% of the cost,&lt;ref name=SDNP/&gt; while 26% of the fund came mostly from universities and banks.&lt;ref name="StarM"/&gt; Before direct sales started on 3 January 2003, 4,000 copies of the English version and all but 250 copies of the Bengali version were sold in advance out of the initial print of 5,000 copies for each versions.&lt;ref name="holiday"/&gt; For an additional run of 10,000 prints people waited in queues outside the Asiatic Society office on the day of the release, and sales continued until 9:30 in the evening. A total of 4,500 sets of the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] version and 2,500 of the English version were sold on the day of release.&lt;ref name="StarM"/&gt;

==History of Bengali-language encyclopedias==
The first attempt to compile a Bengali encyclopedia was undertaken by [[Felix Carey]] (1786–1822), who was the son of Reverend [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] (1761–1834) of [[Serampore]] and the first [[lexicographer]] of the Burmese language. In 1819, he began the translation of the fifth edition of [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], naming it ''Vidyarthabali''. From October 1819 till November 1820 the book was printed by Felix Carey every month in 48-page installments. Thus completed, the first part of ''Vidyarthabali'' was compiled into the 638-page ''Vyabachchedvidya'', the first book on anatomy and surgery in Bengali. Work on the second part, ''Smritishastra'', which was largely on jurisprudence, then began. But, Carey died after only two 40-page installments were printed in February and March 1821.&lt;ref name=Amaresh&gt;{{Cite book | last = Datta | first = Amaresh | title = Encyclopaedia of Indian literature | place = Delhi | pages= 1162–1163| publisher = South Asia Books | year = 1988 | volume = 2 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&amp;pg=PA1162&amp;dq=Nagendranath+Basu | isbn = 978-81-7201-649-4 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was followed by Maharaja Kalikirshna Dev Bahadur's (1808–1974) ''Sankshipta Sadvidyabali'' (1833), a concise encyclopedia. Then came Raja Radhakanta Deb's ''Sabdakalpadrum'' (1822–1858), a [[Sanskrit]] encyclopedic dictionary in eight parts. Next was Rajkrishna Ray (1849–1894) and Saratchandra Dev's (1858-unknown) joint work ''Bharatkosh'', the first Bengali encyclopedia laid-out in alphabetical order (1880–1892) published in three volumes. Reverend [[Krishna Mohan Banerjee]]'s (1813–1885) adaptation of ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', ''Vidyakalpadruma'' or ''Encyclopædia Bengalensis'' (1846–51), and the 22-volume ''Bangla Visvakosh'' (1886–1911), edited by [[Nagendranath Basu]] (1866–1938) with contributions from many major personalities of contemporary Bengal, were published next.&lt;ref name="preface"&gt;{{cite book | last = Islam | first = Sirajul | title = Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh | publisher = Asiatic Society of Bangladesh |date=January 2003 | location = Dhaka, Bangladesh  | isbn = 978-984-32-0576-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Amaresh/&gt;

After the independence of [[Pakistan]] and the [[1947 Partition of Bengal|partition of Bengal]] in 1947, there have been more attempts to compile and publish an encyclopedia. The first was a project to produce a Bengali adaptation of ''Columbia Viking Desk Encyclopedia'' by Franklin Book Programs Inc., undertaken in 1959 and aborted ten years later. The unfinished papers were compiled into four unequal volumes as ''Bangla Visvacos'' (1972) with Khan Bahadur Abdul Hakim as the chief editor.&lt;ref name="preface"/&gt; After the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, three specialized encyclopedias were published - the multi-volume ''Islami Bishwakosh'' (Encyclopedia of Islam, 1986) by [[Islamic Foundation Bangladesh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamicfoundation.gov.bd/site/publications/45d2442d-bccb-4dd4-aa6a-57f80d977898/%E0%A6%87%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%AE%E0%A7%80-%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B6%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%95%E0%A7%8B%E0%A6%B7 |script-title=ইসলামী বিশ্বকোষ |title=Islami Vishwakosh |trans-title=Encyclopedia of Islam |website=Islamic Foundation Bangladesh |language=bn}}&lt;/ref&gt; 5-volume ''Shishu-Biswakosh'' (''Encyclopedia for Children'', 1995) by [[Bangladesh Shishu Academy]], and 4-volume ''Vijnan Biswakosh'' (''Encyclopedia of Science'', 1998) by [[Bangla Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Akkas | first = Abu Jar M | title = The making of an academy | publisher = The New Age | date = 2003-09-02 | url = http://www.newagebd.com/2006/apr/14/pb06/queries.html | accessdate = 2008-01-17 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071211022153/http://www.newagebd.com/2006/apr/14/pb06/queries.html | archivedate = 2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| style="text-align: left;" | '''Vidyakalpadruma''': an encyclopaedic work in 13 parts by Reverend Krishna Mohan Banerjee, based on various English and Sanskrit anthologies and other source books. As it was written in Bengali and English, it was named ''Encyclopedia Bengaliansis''. Articles on history, geography, mathematics and ethics related to Asia, Europe and America are included. The first volume of the ''Vidyakalpadruma'' (1845) was ''Roman Rajyer Purabritta'' (History of the Roman Empire). The third volume was ''Purabritta O Itihas Sar'' (Historical Antiquities), and it contained tales of ancient Egyptian heroes. The fourth volume (1846) was a history of Rome and the sixth volume (1847) a history of Egypt. The eighth volume, ''Bhugol Brittanta'' (Geographical Narratives), contained the geography of Asia and Europe. Krishna Mohan hoped to write the history of India, but was unable to do so.

''Banglapedia'' contains over 5,700 entries,&lt;ref name=CDR/&gt; which are divided into six categories: arts and humanities, history and heritage, state and governance, society and economy, natural sciences, and biological sciences. The writing of each article was overseen by an expert editor.&lt;ref name=SDNP/&gt;&lt;ref name="holiday"/&gt;

''Banglapedia'' was not designed as a general encyclopedia. Its purpose is to provide a standard desk reference for Bangladeshis, as well as for people interested in Bangladesh, Bengali-speaking people, and related political, cultural and geographical contexts.&lt;ref name="StarM"/&gt;

The encyclopedia's editors intended to cover the rise of the [[Bengal]] [[river delta|Delta]] on the physical plane, and its evolution to date, and the changing features of the formation of the delta's ''janapada'' or human settlements on the human plane. The latter includes the rise and fall of kingdoms, invasions from within and beyond and their implications, [[dynasty|dynastic]] rules and administration, as well as other aspects of Bangladesh's past and present.&lt;ref name="preface"/&gt; Entries on topics after 1947 are restricted to the geographical region of Bangladesh. However, for biographical entries, the linguistic identity prevails.&lt;ref name="StarM"/&gt;

The range of topics covered by ''Banglapedia'' includes political geography, religion, literature, art and architecture, folk practices and institutions, indigenous and colonial administration, politics, society, economy, ethnicity, and the sciences.&lt;ref name="StarM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/eresources/databases/4381385.html Banglapedia], Columbia University Libraries Databases; Retrieved: 19 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; All 64 [[districts of Bangladesh]], as well as 451 [[upazila]]s, have been described in details ranging from topographical accounts to the number of dairy farms and hatcheries.&lt;ref name="StarM"/&gt; Over 2,000 single- and four-colour illustrations depict Bangladeshi art and architecture, everyday life, cities and villages and personages.&lt;ref name=SDNP/&gt; It has about 2,100 cross-references, [[cartography|cartographic]] information, tables and statistics.&lt;ref name="holiday"/&gt; It is laid out in alphabetical order and is prefaced by an essay by the Chief Editor. There is a section explaining how to use the ''Banglapedia'', which clarifies issues such as date systems, contributors, cross references, and headings.&lt;ref name="preface"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intute.ac.uk/artsandhumanities/cgi-bin/fullrecord.pl?handle=humbul11923 Banglapedia], Arts and Humanities, Intute, [[Joint Information Systems Committee]]; Retrieved: 19 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operational definition of Bangladesh===
According to the publisher, the goal of this reference tool is to inquire, interpret and integrate the lived experiences and achievements of the people of Bangladesh from ancient times to the present.&lt;ref name="preface"/&gt; The project, conceptually and territorially, interprets the term "Bangladesh" to mean successively ancient Eastern India, [[Suba Bangla]], [[Shahi Bangalah]], [[Bengal Subah|Mughal Suba Bangla]], [[Bengal Presidency]], Bengal Province, [[East Bengal]], [[East Pakistan]], and [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name=SDNP/&gt;&lt;ref name="holiday"/&gt; The editor's preface states:

{{quote|From ancient times to 1971, the political geography of the region has changed often, and with that its name has also undergone changes. The cognates of Vanga, Bangalah, Vangla, Bengal, Vangadesh, Vangladesh, etc. have the closest affinity both territorially and linguistically with the term ''Bangla''. With the rise of Bangladesh as a sovereign nation state, the term has no doubt obtained a specific meaning. It may be noted here that the term ''Bangalah'' or ''Bengala'', from which ''Bangla'' and ''Bengal'' originated, was coined and circulated by Muslim rulers whose seats of administration were located mostly within the present territory of Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="preface"/&gt;}}

==Working team==
Over 1,200 writers and specialists contributed to the encyclopedia, one fifth of whom were foreign experts in Bangladesh or experts working abroad.&lt;ref name="holiday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StarM"/&gt; They are mostly academics, as well as specialists in districts and upazilas for locality inputs and people from professions and occupations. District and upazila cartography has been processed at the [[Geographic information system]] (GIS) and [[cartography|cartographic]] laboratory set up for the Banglapedia.&lt;ref name=Jubilee&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff Correspondent | title = Asiatic Society to celebrate journal’s golden jubilee Feb 11 | publisher = The New Age | date = 2004-01-02 | url = http://www.newagebd.com/2006/feb/10/nat.html | accessdate = 2008-01-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415172758/http://www.newagebd.com/2006/feb/10/nat.html|archivedate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[gazetteer]] group was created to focus on districts and upazilas. The fact that around 400 local intellectuals were charged with writing about their respective zilas and upazilas was described as a unique approach to information gathering.&lt;ref name="StarM"/&gt; In addition, 250 people worked in research management for seven years.&lt;ref name=Jubilee/&gt; A total of 2,000 scholars and technicians were involved.&lt;ref name=SDNP/&gt; There were 270 full-time personnel on the project in all, with 35 to 40 people employed at any given time.&lt;ref name="StarM"/&gt;

Sirajul Islam is the chairman of the Board of Editors of ''Banglapedia'', and the editor of the Journal of the [[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]. A professor of history at the [[University of Dhaka]], the oldest and largest university in Bangladesh, Islam gave up his day job five years before the formal date for retirement, to make time for ''Banglapedia''.&lt;ref name="makinghistory"&gt;{{cite news | last = Khan | first = Mubin S | title = Professor Sirajul Islam: Making history | work = New Age New Year Special 2006 | publisher = The New Age | date = 2006-01-01 | url = http://www.newagebd.com/2006/jan/01/newyear06/heroes02.html | accessdate = 2007-06-07 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070511012529/http://www.newagebd.com/2006/jan/01/newyear06/heroes02.html | archivedate = 2007-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also edited the 3 volumes of the ''History of Bangladesh'' (political, economic and socio-cultural), published by the Asiatic Society In 1991.&lt;ref name="makinghistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="columbia"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Sirajul Islam (Dhaka University) | work = International Directory of South Asia Scholars (IDSAS) | publisher = Columbia University | date = 2004-04-21 | url = http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/data/indiv/area/idsas/ISLAM,Sirajul.htm | accessdate = 2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is now working on the ''Children’s Banglapedia'' and the ''Cultural Survey of Bangladesh'', and is also in charge of the ''National Online Biography'' project of the Society and the Banglapedia Trust.&lt;ref name="makinghistory"/&gt;

The encyclopedia was prepared by a board of editors that included Professor Sirajul Islam of the Department of History, Dhaka University, as the Chairman and Chief Editor, Professor Sajahan Miah of the Department of Philosophy, Dhaka University, as the Convenor and Managing Editor, Professor M. Aminul Islam as the Chairman of Project Implementation Committee, the Chairman of Fund Management Committee, and the Chairman of Cartography Committee, Professor Abdul Momin Chowdhury as the Chairman of Publication Committee, Professor S M Mahfuzur Rahman as the Convenor of Purchase and Procurement Committee, Shahida Alam as the Convenor of Public Relations and Communication Committee, and Professor Jamilur Reza Chowdhury as the Chairman of Multimedia Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Islam | first = Sirajul | title = Board of Editors | work = Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh | publisher = Asiatic Society of Bangladesh |date=January 2003 | location = Dhaka, Bangladesh | pages = | url = http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Contributors | isbn = 978-984-32-0576-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The management structure includes a total of sixty members, divided into six different sub-committees headed by six subject editors. Each sub-committee covered a particular discipline. There were six consulting editors, four language editors, and three translation editors. Each subject editor received assistance from six assistant and associate editors.&lt;ref name="StarM"/&gt;  ''Banglapedia''s subject editors were: Professor Abdul Momin Chowdhury (History and Heritage), Professor Wakil Ahmed (Arts, Humanities, Religion), Professor Mahfuzur Rahman (Society and Economy), Dr Kamal Siddiqui (State and Governance), and Professor S M H Kabir (Science and Technology).&lt;ref name=SDNP/&gt;

==Electronic versions==
The [[CD-ROM]] version of ''Banglapedia'' has more entries than the print version, along with 65 video clips, 49 audio clips, 2,714 images and thumbnails, and 647 maps.&lt;ref name=CDR/&gt; The audio clips include songs by [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], while the video clips include [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]]'s speech on 7 March 1971.

''Banglapedia'' has had several online addresses, some are no longer authorised by the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh.

==Controversy==
Controversy over ''Banglapedia'' broke out even before publication, when the [[Daily Inqilab|Inqilab group]], a major Bangladeshi newspaper publishing house, got hold of a few entries on religion and related issues.&lt;ref name="StarM"/&gt; There have also been complaints about an omission of [[Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh|Jamaat-e-Islami]]'s activities during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].&lt;ref name="StarM"/&gt; A study by [[Bdnews24.com]], a news portal, claimed that ''Banglapedia'' is biased and inaccurate about Bangladesh's indigenous population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = BDNews24 | title = Respect the languages and cultures of ethnic minorities  | publisher = The New Age | date = 2007-02-25 | url = http://www.newagebd.com/2007/feb/25/edit.html | accessdate = 2007-09-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415173917/http://www.newagebd.com/2007/feb/25/edit.html |archivedate=2009-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The encyclopedia is also reported to have used derogatory coinage such as ''Mogh'' for [[Marma people|Marma]] and [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]], ''Tipra'' for [[Tripuri people|Tripuri]] and ''Murang'' for [[Mro people|Mro]]s, as well as ''upajati'' (literally "sub-nation", used to mean "tribal") to define them all.&lt;ref name=NewEth&gt;{{cite news | last = BDNews24 | first = | title = Wrong info on ethnic groups in Banglapedia  | publisher = The New Age | date = 2007-02-24 | url = http://www.newagebd.com/2007/feb/24/front.html | accessdate = 2007-06-07|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090416181207/http://www.newagebd.com/2007/feb/24/front.html|archivedate=2009-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders of the indigenous community, including [[Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord|Chittagong Hill Tracts Regional Council]] member and [[Parbattya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samiti]] leader Rupayan Dewan and General secretary of [[Adivasi Forum]] Sanjib Drong, have endorsed the study's findings.&lt;ref name=NewEth/&gt; Chief editor Islam acknowledged the complaint and promised to amend the second edition accordingly.&lt;ref name=NewEth/&gt;

A '''business record''' is a [[document]] (hard copy or digital) that records a business dealing. Business records include meeting [[minutes]], [[memoranda]], [[employment contract]]s, and [[:Category:Accounting source documents|accounting source documents]].

It must be retrievable at a later date so that the business dealings can be accurately reviewed as required. Since business is dependent upon confidence and trust, not only must the record be accurate and easily retrieved, the processes surrounding its creation and retrieval must be perceived by customers and the business community to consistently deliver a full and accurate record with no gaps or additions.

Most business records have specified [[retention period]]s based on legal requirements and / or internal company policies.  This is important because in many countries (including the United States) many documents ''may'' be required by law to be disclosed to [[Government agency|government regulatory agencies]] or to the general public.  Likewise, they ''may'' be [[Discovery (law)|discoverable]] if the business is [[Lawsuit|sued]].  Under the [[business records exception]] in the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]], certain types of business records, particularly those made and kept with regularity, may be considered [[Admissible evidence|admissible]] in court despite containing [[Hearsay in United States law|hearsay]].

[[Image:Cabinet Maker and Upholsterers Guide.jpg|thumb]]
The '''''Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer's Guide''''' is a famous antiquarian [[book]], reference book, and non-fiction work. Many [[cabinetmaker]]s and [[furniture designer]]s still use it as a ready reference for making period [[furniture]] or designs inspired by the late 18th century era. Historians of domestic life or the [[History of Technology]] use it for establishing context for their research. Finally, collectors are willing to pay a good sum for the original editions.

The sub-title on the original edition is ''Repository of Designs for Every Article of Household Furniture, in the Newest and Most Approved Taste''. This may vary, depending on the edition and the printing.

In a technical sense the book is only attributed to [[George Hepplewhite]] as author since it was published after his death and the original title page bears the name "A. Hepplewhite and co.", for [[Alice Hepplewhite]], his widow. Very little is known of George Hepplewhite's life, unlike that of the other two great British cabinet makers of the period [[Thomas Sheraton]] and [[Thomas Chippendale]]. We do have information that suggests Hepplewhite was born in 1727 in Ryton Parish, County Durham, England.

The [[Dover Publications|Dover Books]] edition which is the main one discussed here, was done as a facsimile of the 3rd edition of the original, "of 1794". According to other sources the third edition of the original book came out in 1790, after the first and second editions of 1788 and 1789.
 
This book was reprinted several times over the centuries. One of the most common editions, apart from the Dover one, was made in [[elephant folio]] size by the [[Towse (company)|Towse]] publishing company of New York, in 1942.

At 28cm high the Dover edition is nearly half the size of the 47cm of the elephant folio sized Towse edition and much smaller than the 36cm of the original edition. The Towse edition also has 88 pages of photographs of furniture done according to the designs in the book. The 128 plates are all monochrome, as in the original.

It is not known if the designs in it are his own or copies from others, since (unlike Chippendale) he was not famous during his life and no piece of furniture can be traced with certainty back to his workshop. The neoclassical designs in it usually have tapered legs and a variety of contrasting veneers. On the whole this kind of furniture has a relatively delicate look. The designs cover the usual chairs, tables, desks and cabinets. They also cover clock cases, library steps and other objects which came out of the cabinet makers' shop of that era. The book was very influential on cabinet makers in the eastern parts of the US during the whole of the 19th century.

The Dover edition (1969, paperback, {{ISBN|0-486-22183-0}}) is still in print and also available used at about half the price of the new book. The Towse edition is available from specialty book dealers for about ten times the price of the new book. The original edition is also available, for about one thousand times the price of the new book.

The complete text with the plates is available for download in various formats from [https://archive.org/details/cabinetmakerupho00ahepuoft] or [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/DLDecArts/DLDecArts-idx?id=DLDecArts.FurnDesHepp].

'''Carnegie Museum of Natural History''' (abbreviated as '''CMNH''') located at 4400 Forbes Avenue in the [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], USA, was founded by the [[List of people from the Pittsburgh metropolitan area|Pittsburgh-based]] [[industrialist]] [[Andrew Carnegie]] in 1896. It maintains an international reputation for research and is ranked among the top five [[List of natural history museums|natural history museums]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegiemnh.org/press/index.html |title=Carnegie Museum of Natural History - Press Room |publisher=Carnegiemnh.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018040550/http://www.carnegiemnh.org/press/index.html |archivedate=2012-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carnegie Museum of Natural History as seen from Cathedral of Learning.jpg|thumb|As seen from the 36th floor of the [[Cathedral of Learning]].]]

==Description and history==
The museum consists of {{convert|115000|sqft|m2}} organized into 20 galleries as well as research, library, and office space. It holds some 22 million specimens, of which about 10,000 are on view at any given time and about 1 million are cataloged in online databases. In 2008 it hosted 386,300 admissions and 63,000 school group visits. Museum education staff also actively engage in outreach by traveling to schools all around western Pennsylvania.

The museum gained prominence in 1899 when its scientists unearthed the fossils of ''[[Diplodocus carnegii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/magazine/19990702dippy2.asp | title=Dippy the star-spangled dinosaur | last= Batz Jr. | first=Bob | newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | location=Pittsburgh | date=1999-07-02 | accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today its dinosaur collection includes the world's largest collection of [[Jurassic]] dinosaurs and its ''Dinosaurs in Their Time'' exhibition offers the third largest collection of mounted, displayed dinosaurs in the United States (behind the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Museum of Natural History]] and the [[American Museum of Natural History]]). Notable specimens include one of the world's only fossils of a juvenile ''[[Apatosaurus]]'', the world's first specimen of a ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131016-tyrannosaurus-rex-smithsonian-wankel-fossil-day/ | title=My T. Rex Is Bigger Than Yours. | last= Switek  | first=Brian | newspaper=National Geographic | location=Pittsburgh | date=2013-10-16 | accessdate=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a recently identified species of [[oviraptorosaur]] named ''[[Anzu wyliei]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2014/03/19/Chicken-from-hell-actually-a-dinosaur-Carnegie-Musuem-scientists-say/stories/201403190180 | title=Carnegie Museum unveils dinosaur nicknamed 'chicken from hell' | last= Webner  | first=Richard | newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | location=Pittsburgh | date=2014-03-20 | accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research teams including former Carnegie scientists made critical discoveries such as ''[[Puijila darwini]]'', ''[[Castorocauda lutrasimilis]]'', and ''[[Hadrocodium wui]]''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Other major exhibits include [[Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems]], [[Alcoa Foundation Hall of American Indians]], [[Polar World: Wyckoff Hall of Arctic Life]], [[Walton Hall of Ancient Egypt]], [[Benedum Hall of Geology]], [[Dinosaurs in Their Time]], and [[Powdermill Nature Reserve]], established by the museum in 1956 to serve as a field station for long-term studies of natural populations.

The museum's active curatorial departments are: [[Anthropology]], [[Bird]]s, [[Botany]], [[Herpetology]] ([[Amphibian]]s &amp; [[Reptile]]s), [[Invertebrate Paleontology]], [[Invertebrate Zoology]], [[Mammal]]s, [[Mineral]]s, [[Mollusk]]s ([[Malacology]]), and [[Vertebrate Paleontology]]. These departments work collaboratively under strategic centers created to re-frame how the museum leverages its research, exhibitions, and public programming to meet the challenges and issues of today. In late 2013, however, the museum's parent organization and interim administration eliminated multiple scientific positions, seriously affecting its capacity to conduct original research.

==Scientific publications==
Carnegie Museum of Natural History publishes scholarly journals and books including ''[[Annals of the carnegie museum|Annals of Carnegie Museum]]'', which offers peer-reviewed articles in organismal biology, earth sciences, and anthropology; ''[[Bulletin of Carnegie Museum of Natural History]]'', offering monographs or collections of related papers from symposia; and ''[[Special Publications of Carnegie Museum|Special Publications]]'' [[Special Publications of Carnegie Museum|of Carnegie Museum]], documenting special topics or areas of research.

A '''comp card''' (also called '''composite card''', '''z card''', '''zed card''' or '''sed card''') is a [[marketing]] tool for actors and especially [[Model (person)|models]].  They serve as the latest and best of a model's [[Career portfolio|portfolio]] and are used as a [[business card]]. A [[Z-CARD]] is also a folded leaflet format, typically used for marketing communications campaigns for example a loyalty programme or seasonal promotion.

==History==
Peter Marlowe in London invented models composites in 1965, then printed on paper to [[DIN A4|A4]] format.&lt;ref&gt;“Model” (1995) by Michael Gross p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Molyneux (April 1989 &amp; May 1989) Marlowe Press - The Story, Model Journal, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The format was changed in 1972 to [[DIN A5|A5]] card format, for filing purposes, and a few other companies started publishing cards for the model industry under different trade names since Peter Marlowe had registered the trademark “Model Composite” in Europe and the USA. Amongst these was Sebastian Sed who traded under the name Sed Cards, which are sometimes mis-pronounced as Z ("Zed") or Set cards. The publishing house of Marlowe Press stopped trading in 1990 and the words "models composites" and "comp cards" became generic within the model industry. Comp card databases and creation tools have moved online in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Model woman : Eileen Ford and the business of beauty|last=Lacey|first=Robert|publisher=Harper, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers|year=2015|isbn=978-0062108074|location=New York, NY|pages=199, 200, 206, 207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
A comp card typically contains a minimum of two pages – a cover page with full size portrait and a second page with a selection of  representative shots from the portfolio. It lists the model's basic stats &amp;ndash; typically height, weight, [[three sizes]]  (bust, waist, hips) for women, suit or chest size and waist and inseam sizes for men, plus [[shoe size]], eye and [[hair color]], nationality and contact information. It is printed on both sides of an 8.5" x 5.5" &lt;ref&gt;https://www.businessofmodeling.com/comp-cards/what-is-a-comp-card/&lt;/ref&gt; piece of [[card stock]] (12 pt stock) (US) or A5 on card weight (350/400&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; stock in metric countries) which is between 300 and 450&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] thick depending on the card stock or quality chosen (Europe, Asia).

==Use==
Comp cards have been around for many years as the essential marketing tool for a model and are likely to retain this standing because they are an inexpensive way to effectively and professionally showcase a model's ability. Composite cards are used on three major levels &amp;ndash; they are used by models, agents and the agent's client

==Production==
Currently, models have many different options of creating comp cards. They can ask their photographer or create their own on their computers using image editing or [[graphics software]]. In addition, with technology's increasingly strong influence in the digital market, many printing companies have looked to the internet to facilitate the ordering process. Comp card printing prices can vary depending on the number of pictures used on the card, the type of paper stock used, and the general printing quality. Different layout styles are available or can be created.

'''Comparison of [[association football]] [[rugby union]]''' is possible because of the games' similarities and shared origins.

Rugby union has a number of set pieces, such as line-outs, scrums and rucks that do not have direct equivalents in association football. Association football aims at a more open kind of play, and there is not the same differentiation between forwards and backs. Another major difference is that rugby union, unlike association football, has no [[goalkeeper (association football)|goal keeper]].

==History of early football==
{{main|Medieval football}}

[[File:Webb-Ellis-at-Rugby,.jpg|right|thumb|170px|An early rugby game – note goalposts]]
The earliest forms of football comprise the common ancestry of both association football and of rugby union. Two of the earliest recorded football type games from Europe include [[Episkyros]]&lt;ref name="fifa.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/the-game/origins.html |title=Classic Football History of the Game |publisher=FIFA.com |date= |accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/rivalries/newsid=2026693/index.html |title=A gripping Greek derby |publisher=FIFA.com |date= |accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Ancient Greece]] and the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] version [[Harpastum]],&lt;ref name="fifa.com" /&gt; which similar to pre-codified "[[Mob Football]]" involved more handling the ball than kicking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/the-game/Britain-home-of-football.html |title=Classic Football History of the Game |publisher=FIFA.com |date= |accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other competitive games revolving around the kicking of a ball have been played in a few countries throughout history, such as [[cuju]]&lt;!--transliterated as Tsu' Chu in ref--&gt; in China.&lt;ref name=fifa-or&gt;{{cite web | title = History of Football | publisher=FIFA| url = https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/the-game/origins.html | accessdate =29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules of association football were codified in England by the Football Association in 1863 and the name ''association football'' was coined to distinguish the game from the [[Football|other forms of football]] played at the time, specifically [[rugby football]]. The term ''soccer'' originated in England, first appearing in the 1880s as an [[Oxford "-er"]] abbreviation of the word "association".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usembassy.org.uk/rss/transcripts/worldcup2006a.html |title=The Yanks are Coming: A U.S. World Cup Preview |accessdate=6 June 2009 |last=Mazumdar |first=Partha |date=5 June 2006 |publisher=Embassy of the United States in London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821115849/http://www.usembassy.org.uk/rss/transcripts/worldcup2006a.html |archivedate=21 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[English-speaking world]], association football is now usually called ''football'' in the United Kingdom, and mainly ''soccer'' in Canada and the United States. Other countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, may use either or both terms.

Most of the interplay between the two codes occurred in the nineteenth century, where the "Associationists" preferred a kicking game, and the "Rugbeians" preferred a handling/carrying game. The term "soccer" was formed by analogy to "rugger", a nickname for rugby football.

One of the early differences between the two codes, beyond playing style, was that of amateurism and professionalism. While rugby union football remained resolutely amateur until the 1990s (resulting in the split with [[rugby league]]), association football became professional very early on.

===Pitch===
{{main|Association football pitch}}

====Association football====
[[File:Football pitch metric and imperial.svg|300px|thumb|centre|Standard pitch measurements for association football]]
The ''penalty area'' is the large marked rectangular area. The smaller rectangle within it is the ''goal area'' (here the yellow-shirted goalkeeper is the only player in the goal area). The ''penalty arc'' is the curved line adjoining the "top" of the penalty area (here the red-shirted referee is standing near the arc).

While an association football pitch makes use of arcs and circles, all of the lines in rugby union are straight. Examples of such features include the ''centre circle'' is marked at {{convert|9.15|m|yd|0}} from the ''centre spot''. Similar to the penalty arc, this indicates the minimum distance that opposing players must keep at [[kick-off (association football)|kick-off]]; the ball itself is placed on the ''centre spot''. During [[Penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootouts]] all players other than the two goalkeepers and the current kicker are required to remain within this circle. The arcs in the ''corners'' denote the area (within 1-yard of the corner) in which the ball has to be placed for corner kicks; opposition players have to be {{convert|9.15|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} away during a corner, and there may be optional lines off-pitch 10 yards away from the corner on the goal- and touch-lines to help gauge these distances.&lt;ref name=LOTGp9&gt;{{cite web|title=Laws of the Game 2011/2012|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2011_12e.pdf|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=12 August 2011|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rugby union====
[[File:Rugby field.svg|thumb|centre|200px|Rugby union field diagram]]
The field of play on a rugby pitch is as near as possible to a maximum of {{convert|144|m|yd}} long by {{convert|70|m|yd}} wide.&lt;ref name="pitch size"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/mm/Document/LawsRegs/0/Law1EN_7709.pdf |title=Law 1: The Ground |page=21 |work=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |format=PDF |accessdate=6 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219162936/http://www.irb.com/mm/Document/LawsRegs/0/Law1EN_7709.pdf |archivedate=19 December 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In actual gameplay there should be a maximum of {{convert|100|m|yd|0}} between the two try-lines, with anywhere between 10 and 22 metres behind each try line to serve as the in-goal area.&lt;ref name="pitch size"/&gt; There are several lines crossing it, notably the halfway line and the "twenty two", which is {{convert|22|m|yd|0}} from the goal line.&lt;ref name="pitch size"/&gt;

Stricter rules apply to the pitch size for matches between national representative teams. The same maximums apply in this case, but the distance between the two try-lines must also be at least {{convert|94|m|yd}} and the pitch must be at least {{convert|68|m|yd}} wide.&lt;ref name="pitch size tests"&gt;{{cite web|title=Laws of the Game 1.2|url=http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=1.2|publisher=IRB|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goalposts===
Another key difference is the goal posts. Rugby union posts consists of two posts with a crossbar but without a net, whereas association football goalposts consists of two posts with crossbar and a net. The area above the crossbar is used for scoring only in rugby union, whereas in association football, only the area below the crossbar is used for scoring.

The goal posts in association football are narrower and the crossbar is lower. The goalposts of rugby union extend far above the crossbar.

====Association football====
[[File:Football goal 20050521.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Association football goal]]
In association football, the goal is the only method of scoring. It is also used to refer to the scoring structure. A deliberate attempt on goal is 
referred to as a "shot".  To score a goal, the ball must pass completely over the goal line between the goal posts and under the crossbar and no rules may be violated on the play (such as touching the ball with the hand or arm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws10_01.htm |publisher=Federation Internationale de Futbol Associacion (FIFA) |title=Laws of the game (Law 10) |accessdate=29 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421154143/http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws10_01.htm |archivedate=21 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[offside (association football)|offside]]. The goal structure is defined as a frame 24&amp;nbsp;feet (7.32&amp;nbsp;m) wide by 8&amp;nbsp;feet (2.44&amp;nbsp;m) tall. In most organised levels of play a net is attached behind the goal frame to catch the ball and indicate that a goal has been scored; but the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] do not mandate the use of a net and only require that any net used not interfere with the goalkeeper.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_04.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 1) |accessdate=29 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322034405/http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_04.htm |archivedate=22 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rugby union====
{{see also|Drop goal (rugby)}}
[[File:2005 Tri Nations Series - All Blacks vs Wallabies.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Eden Park in Auckland, with rugby union goalposts in foreground]]
In rugby union, the try is seen as the main method of scoring, with additional means being to kick the goal between the two bars for a drop goal or a conversion after a try.

A goal is scored in either [[Rugby football|rugby]] code by place kicking or drop kicking a ball over a crossbar and between goal posts. In rugby union, a goal scored from the field either as a drop kick during normal play or a place kick after a foul scores three points. In [[rugby league]], a goal scored from the field as a drop kick scores one point, and a goal from a place kick after a foul scores two points. In both codes, a goal scored by place kick after a try (a ''conversion'') scores two points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uidaho.edu/clubs/womens_rugby/RugbyRoot/rugby/Rules/LawBook/law11.html
|publisher=University of Idaho |title=Law 11. Method of Scoring |accessdate=29 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kick is taken from a position that is back in line from where the try was scored giving an incentive for teams to try and score near to the centre such that the kick is more attainable. Rugby league goal posts are generally "H" shaped, 5.5 metres in width, with the cross bar three metres from the ground&lt;ref&gt;http://www.therfl.co.uk/the-rfl/rules/official_laws/1_playing_field&lt;/ref&gt;

===Football as used in association football===
{{main|Ball (association football)}}
[[File:Football Pallo valmiina-cropped.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Adidas Telstar]] became the standard design for representing footballs in different media]]
[[Laws of the Game (association football)|Law 2 of the game]] specifies that the ball is an air-filled [[sphere]] with a [[circumference]] of {{convert|68|-|70|cm|in|abbr=on}}, a [[Mass|weight]] of {{convert|410|-|450|g|oz|abbr=on}}, inflated to a [[pressure]] of 0.6 to 1.1&amp;nbsp;[[technical atmosphere|atmospheres]] ({{convert|60|-|111|kPa|psi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) "at sea level", and covered in leather or "other suitable material".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/lawsofthegame.html |title=Laws of the Game |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weight specified for a ball is the dry weight, as older balls often became significantly heavier in the course of a match played in wet weather. The standard ball is a Size 5, although smaller sizes exist: Size 3 is standard for [[team handball]] and Size 4 in [[futsal]] and other small-field variants. Other sizes are used in underage games or as novelty items.

Most modern footballs are stitched from 32 panels of waterproofed leather or plastic: 12 regular [[pentagon]]s and 20 regular [[hexagon]]s. The 32-panel configuration is the [[spherical polyhedron]] corresponding to the [[truncated icosahedron]]; it is spherical because the faces bulge from the pressure of the air inside. The first 32-panel ball was marketed by [[SELECT Sport A/S|Select]] in the 1950s in Denmark. This configuration became common throughout [[Continental Europe]] in the 1960s, and was publicised worldwide by the [[Adidas]] [[Telstar (football)|Telstar]], the official ball of the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]].

The familiar 32-panel football design is sometimes referenced to describe the truncated icosahedron [[Archimedean solid]], carbon [[Fullerene|buckyballs]] or the root structure of [[geodesic dome]]s.

There are a number of different types of football balls depending on the match and turf including: training footballs, match footballs, professional match footballs, beach footballs, street footballs, indoor footballs, turf balls, futsal footballs and mini/skills footballs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soccer.com/guide/soccer-ball-guide/ Soccer Balls], [http://soccer.com/ Soccer], 14 October 2013. Retrieved: 2013-10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rugby union ball===
[[File:Palla da Rugby.png|right|thumb|200px|Rugby ball (manufactured by [[Mitre Sports International|Mitre]]) used by the Italy national team]]
Rugby union uses an oval ball (a [[prolate spheroid]]). This makes a difference in the variety and style of [[kick (football)|kicking]]. Rugby union is capable of producing a diverse range of kicking styles.

The ball used in rugby union, usually referred to as a rugby ball, is a prolate spheroid essentially [[ellipse|elliptical]] in profile. Traditionally made of brown leather, modern footballs are manufactured in a variety of colours and patterns. A regulation football is {{convert|28|-|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|58|-|62|cm|in|abbr=on}} in circumference at its widest point. It weighs {{convert|410|-|460|g|oz|abbr=on}} and is inflated to {{convert|65.7|-|68.8|kPa|psi|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugby365.com/Laws_And_Referees/The_Laws/story_214.shtml |title=Rugby Union: Law 2 – The ball |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=15 January 2007 |accessdate=30 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070115054533/http://www.rugby365.com/Laws_And_Referees/The_Laws/story_214.shtml |archivedate=15 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, leather-encased balls, which were prone to water-logging, were replaced with balls encased in synthetic waterproof materials. The [[Gilbert Synergie]] was the match ball of the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]].

==Duration==
A rugby union game is divided into two-halves of 40 minutes (or shorter for lower-grade games) separated by a half time period of up to 15 minutes in an [[Test match (rugby union)|international]] match. Most notably, a rugby union game will continue after the scheduled end of a half (half-time or full-time) until the ball becomes dead – any occurrence that would have play restart with a scrum or line-out, or when a team scores. This has led to some 'nail-biting' finishes where teams losing by only a small margin work their way towards scoring, and games can go on several minutes over time. The clock is also stopped during substitutions and for injuries, so the referee does not need to add [[stoppage time]].

==Advancing the ball and passing==
In both games, players must dispose of the ball correctly. In rugby union, this can be by hand (passing, or throw in) or by foot. In association football, this can only usually be done by foot (although the goalkeeper can handle the ball).

The term "passing" is used in association football to refer to a ball kicked to another player on the same team, whereas in rugby union it refers to when the ball is passed by hand to another player on the same team.

Both association football and rugby union have an [[offside (sport)|offside rule]]. In rugby union, it is illegal to throw (pass) the ball in a forward direction:  a player in a position to receive such a pass would in most cases be [[offside (rugby)|offside]] anyway. In association football, the ball can be passed backwards or forwards to a player on the same team, so long as the player passed to in front is onside.

==Tackles and blocks==
{{See also|Tackle (football move)}}

Rugby union allows full tackling above the knees and below the shoulders, whereas association football explicitly disallows tackling of that sort. Rugby union rules do not allow tackles above the plane of the shoulders. Only the player who has possession of the ball can be tackled. The attacker must also attempt to wrap his or her arms around the player being tackled: merely pushing the player being tackled to ground with a shoulder is illegal. If a maul or ruck is formed, a player may not "ram" into the formation without first binding to the players.

==Scoring==
Rugby union is played between two teams – the one that scores more points wins the game. Points can be scored in several ways: a [[try]], scored by grounding the ball in the in-goal area (between the goal line and the dead ball line), is worth 5 points and a subsequent conversion kick scores 2 points; a successful penalty kick or a [[drop goal]] each score 3 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irblaws.com/downloads/EN/Law_9_EN.pdf |work=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |title=Law 9 Method of Scoring |format=PDF |accessdate=15 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61GjIRxGu?url=http://www.irblaws.com/downloads/EN/Law_9_EN.pdf |archivedate=28 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The values of each of these scoring methods have been changed over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/scoring.htm |title=Scoring through the ages |work=rugbyfootballhistory.com  |accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Players==
{{See also|Rugby union positions|Association football positions}}

There is no ''goalkeeper'' in rugby union, instead there is a ''fullback'', although the fullback in rugby union is not required to guard a goal in the same way that a goalkeeper does. A rugby union fullback generally fields the long range kicks, and makes long range attacks.

Rugby union allows a maximum of 15 players per side on the field at any one time; in the instance of association football, a maximum of 11 players per side is allowed on the field at any one time. These numbers may be reduced through players being sent off, or injuries without replacements. (The latter only tends to occur in the lower levels of each sport)

==International competition==
{{see also|Rugby World Cup|FIFA World Cup}}
[[File:Scotland rugbyteam 1871.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Scottish rugby side of 1871, which beat England by one try in the first international match ever]]
Both international association football and international rugby union share at least one thing in common. The original international games of each code were between Scotland and England in the early 1870s.

Rugby union has been an international game since 1871, when {{nrut|Scotland}} beat {{nrut|England}} at [[Raeburn Place]] in Edinburgh. {{nrut|Ireland}} entered international competition in 1875, and have played matches continuously ever since. The [[Rugby World Cup]] (RWC) itself is of much more recent origin, dating back to 1987, when invitations were sent out to various national sides. Entry has been through qualifying rounds ever since.

The [[Scotland v England (1872)|first official international football match]] took place in 1872 between Scotland and England in [[Glasgow]], again at the instigation of C. W. Alcock. The FIFA World Cup, often simply the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the senior [[List of men's national association football teams|men's national teams]] of the members of ''Fédération Internationale de Football Association'' ([[FIFA]]), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|inaugural tournament in 1930]], except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the [[Second World War]].

==Variants and casual play==
[[File:Spielszene BK.jpg|right|thumb|Beach Rugby match]]

Variants of association football have been codified for reduced-sized teams (i.e. [[Five-a-side football]]), for play in non-field environments (i.e. [[Beach soccer]], [[Indoor soccer]], and [[Futsal]]) and for teams with disabilities (i.e. [[Paralympic association football]]).

Variants of rugby union have been codified for reduced-sized teams (i.e. [[rugby sevens]], [[rugby tens]]), for youth training (i.e. [[mini rugby]]) for play in non-field environments (i.e. [[beach rugby]] and [[snow rugby]]) and for teams with disabilities (i.e. [[quad rugby]]).

[[Rugby league]] is a separate code from [[rugby union]], but arose from the same game due to disputes over payment. Both rugby league and rugby union still share many elements in common, and may be confused by a casual spectator.

==General features==

Genealogy software products differ in the way they support '''data acquisition''' (e.g. drag and drop data entry for images, flexible data formats, free defined custom attributes for persons and connections between persons, rating of sources) and '''interaction''' (e.g. 3D-view, name filters, full text search and dynamic pan and zoom navigation), in '''reporting''' (e.g.: fan charts, automatic narratives, relationship between arbitrary people, place of birth on virtual globes, statistics about number of children per family), '''validation''' (e.g.: consistency checks, research assistants connected to online genealogy databases), '''exporting''' (e.g.: export as web page, book or wall chart) and '''integration''' (e.g.: synchronisation with tablet version). Some software might include also fun and '''entertainment''' features (e.g. quizzes or slideshows).

==Genealogical features==

Besides exchange between systems (e.g. [[GEDCOM]] support for import and export), flexible data handling (e.g. custom attributes and multiple kinds of relations between people) is relevant.

In 1899, Douglass taught geology and [[physical geography]] at the University of Montana.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In 1902, Douglass was hired at the [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] to work in the field of paleontology and worked there for 15 years.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; From 1923 to 1924, he worked with the National Museum and [[University of Utah]] to obtain dinosaur fossils and discovered a large part of a skeleton known as ''Barosaurus lentus''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The following year, he was employed by the University of Utah to excavate dinosaur bones.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

After a botanical trip to Mexico in 1890, Douglass became assistant to Professor [[William Trelease]] at the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Because he did notable research on oil, [[oil shale]], [[asphalt]]s, and other mineral deposits, he became consulting geologist for companies engaged in these fields in Utah, Colorado, Arizona and Texas.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; His final years were spent as a geologist.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Douglass played a central role in one of the most important fossil finds in North America.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1905, he was sent to Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana, and Idaho to collect [[vertebrate]] and [[invertebrate]] fossils. Additionally, he obtained data to solve certain geological problems and conduct geological explorations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In 1907, Douglass traveled to the [[Uintah Basin]] in northeastern Utah to explore fossiliferous [[strata]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Later in 1908, he explored the hills along the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] near [[Jensen, Utah]] and came upon with the tail section of an Apatasaurus in the [[Morrison Formation]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The following year while searching fossils for the Carnegie Museum, he discovered a formation layered with prehistoric plant and animal fossils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://utah.com/dinosaur-national-monument|title=Dinosaur National Monument|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1909, Earl traveled to Utah to search for dinosaur skeletons , where he discovered his famous dinosaur at the Utah quarry.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The dinosaur was formally named ''Apatosaurus louisae'', after Carnegie’s wife Louise.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the same year, while climbing the [[Split Mountain]] near Jenson, Utah he found eight large [[vertebra]]e partially embedded in the rock, which turned out to be the entire body of a brontosaur nearly 70 feet long.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/mining_and_railroads/dinosaurrushcreatedexcitementinuintabasin.html |title="Dinosaur Rush" Created Excitement in Uinta Basin|last=Ison|first=Y.

[[File:Vol. 9. European Pharmacopoeia cover page.png|alt=European Pharmacopoeia 9th Edition|thumb|Cover of the ''European Pharmacopoeia'', 9th Edition]]
The '''''European Pharmacopoeia'''''&lt;ref name=EP-background&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.EDQM.eu/en/european-pharmacopoeia-background-50.html|title=European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) – Background &amp; Mission|website=www.EDQM.eu|publisher=[[European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines|European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &amp; HealthCare]] (EDQM)|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''''Pharmacopoeia Europaea''''', '''''Ph. Eur.''''') is a major regional [[pharmacopoeia]] which provides common quality standards throughout the [[pharmaceutical industry]] in [[Europe]] to control the quality of [[Pharmaceutical drug|medicines]], and the substances used to [[Pharmaceutical manufacturing|manufacture]] them.&lt;ref name=EP-background/&gt;  It is a published collection of [[monograph]]s which describe both the individual and general quality standards for ingredients, [[dosage form]]s, and methods of [[Pharmaceutical engineering|analysis]] for medicines.&lt;ref name=EP-background/&gt;  These standards apply to medicines for both [[Medicine|human]] and [[Veterinary medicine|veterinary]] use.&lt;ref name=EP-background/&gt;

==Legal basis==
The ''European Pharmacopoeia'' has a [[Contract|legally binding]] character.  It is used as an official reference to serve [[public health]],&lt;ref name=EP-background/&gt; and is part of the regulatory requirements for obtaining a [[Marketing Authorisation|Marketing Authorisation]] (MA) for a medicinal (human or veterinary) product.&lt;ref name=EP-background/&gt;  The quality standards of the European Pharmacopoeia apply throughout the entire life-cycle of a product, and become legally binding and mandatory on the same date in all thirty-eight (38)&lt;ref name=155th&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.EDQM.eu/sites/default/files/press_release_pheur_commission_155th_session_june_2016.pdf|title=155th Session of the European Pharmacopoeia Commission (21-22 June 2016)|format=pdf|website=www.EDQM.eu|location=Strasbourg, France|publisher=[[European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines|European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &amp; HealthCare]] (EDQM)|date=30 June 2016|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; signatory states, which include all [[European Union]] member states.

Several [[legal]] texts make the ''European Pharmacopoeia'' mandatory in Europe.&lt;ref name=EP-background/&gt;  The Convention on the Elaboration of a European Pharmacopoeia (CETS 50)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.CoE.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/050|title=Details of Treaty No.050, Convention on the Elaboration of a European Pharmacopoeia|website=www.CoE.int|publisher=Treaty Office, [[Council of Europe]]|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was adopted by the [[Council of Europe]] in 1964, laid the groundwork for the development of the ''European Pharmacopoeia''.  In 1994, a Protocol (ETS No. 134)&lt;ref name=EP-background/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.CoE.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/134|title=Details of Treaty No.134, Protocol to the Convention on the Elaboration of a European Pharmacopoeia|website=www.CoE.int|publisher=Treaty Office, [[Council of Europe]]|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was adopted, amending the Convention to prepare for the accession of the European Union (EU), and defining the respective powers of the European Union and its [[Member States]] within the European Pharmacopoeia Commission.

European Union Directive 2001/82/EC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://ec.Europa.eu/health/files/eudralex/vol-5/dir_2001_82/dir_2001_82_en.pdf|title=Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of The Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products|format=pdf|work=ec.Europa.eu - Official Journal of the European Communities|publisher=[[European Union]]|date=6 November 2001|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Directive 2001/83/EC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://Eur-Lex.Europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2001L0083:20070126:en:PDF|title=Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of The Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use|format=pdf|work=Eur-Lex.Europa.eu - Official Journal of the European Communities|publisher=[[European Union]]|date=6 November 2001|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as amended) state the legally binding character of ''European Pharmacopoeia'' texts for Marketing Authorisation Applications (MAA).  All [[Pharmaceutical manufacturing|manufacturers of medicines]] or substances for [[pharmaceutical]] use therefore must apply the ''European Pharmacopoeia'' quality standards in order to be able to market and use these products in Europe.&lt;ref name=EP-background/&gt;

As of September 2018, thirty-eight (38) member states and the [[European Union]] are signatories to the Convention on the Elaboration of a European Pharmacopoeia. Twenty-eight (28) countries from all continents are part of its observers, as is the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA).

==The European Pharmacopoeia Commission==
[[File:EU-FR-AL-67@Strasbourg-Pharmacopée européenne 01.jpg|thumb|left|EDQM building, [[Strasbourg]], France]]
While the [[European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines|European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &amp; HealthCare]] (EDQM), a directorate of the [[Council of Europe]], provides scientific and administrative support for the ''European Pharmacopoeia'', the governing body is the European Pharmacopoeia Commission.  The European Pharmacopoeia Commission determines the general principles applicable to the elaboration of the European Pharmacopoeia.  It also decides the work programme, sets up and appoints experts to the specialised groups responsible for preparing monographs, adopts these monographs, and recommends dates for the implementation of its decisions within the territories of the contracting parties.

This Commission meets in [[Strasbourg]], France, three times a year, to adopt texts proposed by its groups of experts, and to decide on its programme of work and general policies.  Items are added to the work programme in response to requests received by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &amp; HealthCare from the Member States and their national authorities, industry or experts from around the world, based on current scientific and health issues.  Each national delegation has one vote.  In all technical questions, the decisions of the Commission are taken by a unanimous vote of the national delegations that cast a vote.  Member States' representatives mostly come from [[Health authority|health authorities]], national pharmacopoeia authorities and [[University|universities]]; and are appointed by the national authorities on the basis of their expertise.  Representatives of the thirty (30) observers are invited to attend the sessions, but cannot vote.

The current Chair of the Commission is Dr Tobias Gosdschan, who was elected in March 2016.&lt;ref name=155th/&gt;  Dr Gosdschan's term for Chair is three years, and runs in parallel with other members of the Commission's Presidium.&lt;ref name=155th/&gt;

==Publication==
The first edition of the ''European Pharmacopoeia'' was published in 1969, and consisted of 120 texts. The ninth edition,&lt;ref name=9thEd&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.EDQM.eu/en/ph-eur-9th-edition|title=European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) 9th Edition|website=www.EDQM.eu|publisher=[[European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines|European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &amp; HealthCare]] (EDQM)|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;, currently applicable, was published in July 2016. The Ph. Eur. is applicable in 38 European countries and used in over 100 countries worldwide. Nowadays it contains almost 3000 texts (the [[monograph]]s), covering all therapeutic areas and consisting of:
* individual texts describing legally-binding quality standards for substances used in the manufacture of medicines or medicine ingredients (including active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients, herbals, etc.);
* individual texts describing legally-binding quality standards for finished products; 
* general monographs describing legally-binding quality standards for classes of substances (such as fermentation products or substances for pharmaceutical use) or for the dosage forms that medicines can take (tablets, capsules, injections, etc.); and
* general methods of analysis of substances used in the manufacture of medicines, which are not legally-binding and may also be used for substances and medicines not described in the Ph. Eur.

Ph. Eur. texts contain detailed analytical methods to identify the substance or product and control its quality and quantitative strength. 

Ph. Eur. texts also address the issue of impurities in medicinal products, which do not offer any therapeutic benefit for the patient and sometimes are potentially toxic. Impurities are present at every stage of the manufacture of medicines: in starting materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), reagents, intermediates, excipients and primary packaging materials. But the Ph. Eur. texts’s section on impurities is perhaps the most essential part of a quality standard of an active substance.

A new edition of the European Pharmacopoeia is published every three years: in both English and French,&lt;ref name=9thEd/&gt; by the [[Council of Europe]].  It is made available in print and electronic (online and downloadable) versions; the online version is also accessible from [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer]]s.&lt;ref name=9thEd/&gt;

Translations into other languages are published by the Member States themselves. For example, a German version is jointly published by Austria, Germany and Switzerland.

[[File:Facebook new login system spam fastflux 4.png|thumb|right|200px|DNS [[Robtex]] Analysis of a Fast flux domain]]

'''Fast flux''' is a [[Domain name system|DNS]] technique used by [[botnet]]s to hide [[phishing]] and [[malware]] delivery sites behind an ever-changing network of compromised hosts acting as proxies.  It can also refer to the combination of [[peer-to-peer networking]], distributed command and control, web-based [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] and [[Proxy server|proxy]] redirection used to make malware networks more resistant to discovery and counter-measures. The [[Storm Worm]] (2007) is one of the first malware variants to make use of this technique.

The basic idea behind Fast flux is to have numerous [[IP address]]es associated with a single [[fully qualified domain name]], where the IP addresses are swapped in and out with extremely high frequency, through changing [[DNS record]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Honeynet Project: How Fast-Flux Service Networks Work | last1 = Danford | last2 = Salusky | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2010-08-23 | url = http://www.honeynet.org/node/132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet users may see fast flux used in [[phishing attack]]s linked to criminal organizations, including attacks on [[social network services]].

While security researchers have been aware of the technique since at least November 2006, the technique only received wider attention in the security trade press starting from July 2007.

==Single-flux and double-flux==
The simplest type of fast flux, named "single-flux", is characterized by multiple individual nodes within the network registering and de-registering their addresses as part of the DNS A (address) record list for a single [[Domain name|DNS name]].  This combines [[round robin DNS]] with very short—usually less than five minutes (300s)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.spamhaus.org/faq/section/ISP+Spam+Issues#164|title=The Spamhaus Project - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)|website=www.spamhaus.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; -- TTL ([[time to live]]) values to create a constantly changing list of destination addresses for that single DNS name. The list can be hundreds or thousands of entries long.

A more sophisticated type of fast flux, referred to itself as "double-flux", is characterized by multiple nodes within the network registering and de-registering their addresses as part of the DNS [[NS record|Name Server record]] list for the [[DNS zone]]. This provides an additional layer of redundancy and survivability within the malware network.

Within a malware attack, the DNS records will normally point to a compromised system that will act as a [[proxy server]]. This method prevents some of the traditionally best defense mechanisms from working — e.g., IP-based [[access control lists]] (ACLs). The method can also mask the systems of attackers, which will exploit the network through a series of proxies and make it much more difficult to identify the attackers' network. The record will normally point to an IP where bots go for registration, to receive instructions, or to activate attacks. Because the IPs are proxified, it is possible to disguise the originating source of these instructions, increasing the survival rate as IP-based block lists are put in place.

The most effective measure against fast flux is to take down the domain name it uses.  [[Domain name registrar|Registrar]]s are, however, reluctant to do so because domain owners are legitimate customers for them and there's no worldwide-enforced policy of what constitutes an abuse. In addition to this, [[cybersquatter]]s, including fast flux operators (who typically register new names on demand), are their main source of income. Security experts keep working on measures to ease this process.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

Other measures can be taken by local network administrators. A network admin can force endpoints within their network to only be able to use local DNS servers by blocking all egress DNS traffic, and then blackhole requests for malicious domains at the DNS level. Alternatively, administrators with network devices capable of doing [[OSI_model#Layer_7:_Application_Layer |layer 7]] inspection and intervention can set up policies that reset connections that attempt to resolve or make HTTP requests involving malicious domains.

'''''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas''''' is a 1998 American [[Psychedelic film|psychedelic]] [[satirical]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/1998/may/18/know-fear/|title=Know Fear|last=|first=|date=|website=Las Vegas Sun|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[road movie|road film]] adapted from [[Hunter S. Thompson]]'s [[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas|novel of the same name]]. It was co-written and directed by [[Terry Gilliam]], starring [[Johnny Depp]] as Raoul Duke and [[Benicio del Toro]] as Dr. Gonzo. The two embark on an initially assigned journey with journalistic purpose which turns out to be an exploration of the Las Vegas setting under the effect of psychoactive substances.

The film received mixed reviews from critics and was a [[box office bomb|financial failure]], but has since become a [[cult film]] due in large part to its release on DVD, including a Special Edition released by [[The Criterion Collection]].

== Plot ==
In 1971, [[Raoul Duke]] and [[Oscar Zeta Acosta|Dr. Gonzo]] speed across the Nevada desert. Duke, under the influence of mescaline, complains of a swarm of giant bats, before going through the pair's inventory of psychoactive drugs. Shortly afterward, the duo stop to pick up a young hitchhiker, and explain what they are doing. Duke has been assigned by an unnamed magazine to travel to Las Vegas and cover the [[Mint 400]] motorcycle race. However, they have also decided to take advantage of the trip by purchasing a large number of drugs and renting a red Chevrolet Impala convertible.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_1955-Chevrolet-Impala-Convertible-16467-1971.html&lt;/ref&gt; The young man soon becomes terrified of the antics of the duo and flees on foot. Trying to reach Vegas before the hitchhiker can go to the police, Gonzo gives Duke part of a sheet of Sunshine Acid, then informs him that there is little chance of making it before the drug kicks in. By the time they reach the strip, Duke is in the full throes of his trip, and barely makes it through the check-in, all the while hallucinating that the hotel clerk is a moray eel, and that his fellow bar patrons are lizards in the depths of an orgy.

The next day, Duke arrives at the race, and heads out with his photographer, a man by the name of Lacerda. During the coverage, Duke becomes irrational and believes that they are in the middle of a battlefield, so he fires Lacerda and returns to the hotel. After consuming more mescaline, as well as huffing [[diethyl ether]], Duke and Gonzo arrive at the [[Circus Circus Las Vegas|Bazooko Circus]] casino, but leave shortly afterwards, the chaotic atmosphere frightening Gonzo. Back in the hotel room, Duke leaves a knife-wielding Gonzo unattended, and tries his luck at a quick round of [[Big Six wheel|Big Six]]. When Duke returns, he finds that Gonzo, after consuming a full sheet of LSD, has trashed the room, and is sitting fully clothed in the bathtub, attempting to pull the tape player in with him, as he wants to hear the song better. He pleads with Duke to throw the machine into the water when the song "[[White Rabbit (song)|White Rabbit]]" peaks. Duke agrees, but instead throws a grapefruit at Gonzo's head before running outside. Gonzo later confronts him violently, but claims to have only wanted to mutilate, rather than murder, Duke.

The next morning, Duke awakens to an exorbitant room service bill, and no sign of Gonzo (who has returned to Los Angeles while Duke slept), and attempts to leave town. As he nears [[Baker, California]], a highway patrolman pulls him over for speeding, and advises him to sleep at a nearby rest stop. Duke instead heads to a payphone and calls Gonzo, learning that he has a suite in his name at the [[Flamingo Las Vegas]] so he can cover a district attorney's convention on narcotics. Duke checks into his suite, only to be met by an LSD-tripping Gonzo, and a young girl by the name of Lucy he has brought with him. Gonzo explains that Lucy has come to Las Vegas to meet [[Barbra Streisand]], and that he gave her LSD on the plane not realizing she had never taken it before. Sensing the trouble this could get them into, Duke convinces Gonzo to ditch Lucy in another hotel before her trip wears off.

Gonzo accompanies Duke to the D.A.'s convention, and the pair discreetly snort cocaine as the guest speaker delivers a comically out-of-touch speech about "marijuana addicts" before showing a brief film. Unable to take it, Duke and Gonzo flee back to their room, only to discover that Lucy has called. Their trips mostly over, Gonzo deals with Lucy over the phone (pretending that he is being savagely beaten by thugs), as Duke attempts to mellow out by trying some of Gonzo's stash of [[adrenochrome]]. However, the trip spirals out of control, and Duke is reduced to an incoherent mess before he blacks out.

After an unspecified amount of time passes, Duke wakes up to a complete ruin of the once pristine suite. After discovering his tape recorder, he attempts to remember what has happened. As he listens, he has brief memories of the general mayhem that has taken place, including a heated encounter with a waitress at a [[diner]], convincing a distraught cleaning woman that they are police officers investigating a drug ring, and attempting to buy an [[orangutan]].

Duke drops Gonzo off at the airport, after missing the entrance, driving across the tarmac and pulling up right next to the plane, before returning to the hotel one last time to finish his article. Duke then speeds back to Los Angeles.

=== Development ===
Animator/filmmaker [[Ralph Bakshi]] tried to convince a girlfriend of Thompson's to let him do ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' as an animated film, done in the style of [[Ralph Steadman]]'s illustrations for the book. Bakshi is quoted as saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Hunter had given the rights to a girlfriend of his. I spent three days with her trying to talk her into me animating it – she wanted to make a live-action of it – I kept telling her that a live-action would look like a bad cartoon but an animated version would be a great one. She had a tremendous disdain for animators because it wasn't considered the top of Hollywood. Hunter also could not make her change her mind. So she made the pic with Johnny Depp (who is a great actor), and got the film I told her she would get – it would have been more real in a cartoon using Steadman's drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Ralph Bakshi | title=Your thoughts on the passing of Hunter S. Thompson | url=http://www.ralphbakshi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4580#4580 | accessdate=2011-10-29 | date=2005-03-24 | publisher=Ralph Bakshi Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In January 1976, ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' announced that [[Larry McMurtry]] had signed a contract to write a screenplay for a film adaptation.&lt;ref name="West, Richard"&gt;{{cite news | last=West | first=Richard | title=Texas Monthly Reporter | work=[[Texas Monthly]] | date=January 1976 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yCwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Texas%20Monthly%20Jan%201976&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Martin Scorsese]] and [[Oliver Stone]] each tried to get the film off the ground, but were unsuccessful and moved on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wideanglecloseup.com/loathing_filming.html | title=The Making of ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas''|author=David Morgan | year=1999 | accessdate=2006-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Films]] began work on a film version as early as 1992.&lt;ref name="Ebner, Mark"&gt;{{cite news | last=Ebner | first=Mark | title=Fear and Bleating in Las Vegas: Hunter Thompson Goes Hollywood | work=[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]] | date=January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Head of Production and the film's producer Stephen Nemeth originally wanted [[Lee Tamahori]] to direct, but he wasn't available until after the January 1997 start date.&lt;ref name="Ebner, Mark" /&gt; Depp wanted [[Bruce Robinson]] to direct, but he was "unavailable... by choice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/johnny-depp-the-rum-diary-interview/|title=Johnny Depp and Director Bruce Robinson THE RUM DIARY Interview|date=26 October 2011|publisher=|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhino appealed to Thompson for an extension on the film rights but the author and his lawyers denied the extension. Under pressure, Rhino countered by green-lighting the film and hiring [[Alex Cox]] to direct within a few days.&lt;ref name="Ebner, Mark" /&gt; According to Nemeth, Cox could "do it for a price, could do it quickly and could get this movie going in four months."&lt;ref name="Ebner, Mark" /&gt;

Rhino hired [[Terry Gilliam]] and was granted an extension from Thompson but only with the stipulation that the director made the film. Rhino did not want to commit to Gilliam in case he didn't work out.&lt;ref name="Ebner, Mark" /&gt; Thompson remembers, "They just kept asking for more [time]. I got kind of agitated about it, because I thought they were trying to put off doing it. So I began to charge them more... I wanted to see the movie done, once it got started."&lt;ref name="Ebner, Mark" /&gt; The studio threatened to make the film with Cox and without Depp and del Toro. The two actors were upset when producer Laila Nabulsi told them of Rhino's plans.&lt;ref name="Ebner, Mark" /&gt; [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] stepped in to distribute the film and Depp and Gilliam were paid $500,000 each but the director still did not have a firm deal in place. In retaliation, Depp and Gilliam locked Rhino out of the set during filming.&lt;ref name="Ebner, Mark" /&gt;

===Casting===
During the initial development to get the film made, [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Marlon Brando]] were originally considered for the roles of Duke and Gonzo but they both grew too old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Nathan Lee | title=Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/12/movies/12bmovi.html?ex=1305086400&amp;en=e15eafc24e1957de&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss | date=2006-05-12 | accessdate=2007-01-04 | work=The New York Times}} {{Registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[John Belushi]] were considered for the duo, but that fell apart when Belushi died. [[John Malkovich]] was later considered for the role of Duke, but he grew too old as well. At one point [[John Cusack]] was almost cast (Cusack had previously directed the play version of ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'', with his brother playing Duke).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas audio commentary|people=Laila Nabulsi|medium=DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after Hunter S. Thompson met with Johnny Depp he became convinced that no one else could play him. When Cox and Davies started writing the screenplay, Depp and del Toro committed to starring in the film.&lt;ref name="Ebner, Mark" /&gt;

Gilliam said in an interview that his films are actor-led, the performance of the two characters in ''Fear and Loathing'' is hyper realistic but truthful: "I am interested in real people in bizarre, twisted environments that force them to act... to react against."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=clamenza33|title=Terry Gilliam Interview - Fear &amp; Loathing|date=2008-09-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QOU8wS7jI|accessdate=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Gonzo is based on Thompson's friend [[Oscar Zeta Acosta]], who disappeared sometime in 1974.&lt;ref name="Doss, Yvette"&gt;{{cite news|url=|title=The Lost Legend of the Real Dr. Gonzo|last=Doss|first=Yvette C|date=June 5, 1998|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson changed Acosta's ethnic identity to "Samoan" to deflect suspicion from Acosta, who was in trouble with the Los Angeles County Bar Association. He was the "Chicano lawyer" notorious for his party binges.

The lead actors undertook extraordinary preparations for their respective roles. Del Toro gained more than 45 pounds (18&amp;nbsp;kg) in nine weeks before filming began, eating 16 donuts a day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/29/people-talk-about-sicario-as-if-its-a-documentary-benicio-del-toro-on-his-new-thriller|title='Melania knew what she was putting on': Benicio Del Toro on drugs, Sicario and Trump's border war|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=29 June 2018|accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extensively researched Acosta's life.&lt;ref name="Doss, Yvette" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Elias, Justine"&gt;{{cite news | last = Elias | first = Justine | title = Behind the Scenes: Terry Gilliam | work = [[Us Weekly]] | date = June 1998 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1997, Depp moved into the basement of Thompson's Owl Farm home and lived there for four months, doing research for the role as well as studying Thompson's habits and mannerisms.&lt;ref name="Brinkley, Douglas"&gt;{{cite news | last = Brinkley | first = Douglas | title = Johnny, Get Your Gun | pages = 96–100; 109–110 | work = [[George (magazine)|George]] | date = June 1998 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The actor went through Thompson's original manuscript, mementos and notebooks that he kept during the actual trip.&lt;ref name="Brinkley, Douglas" /&gt; Depp remembers, "He saved it all. Not only is [the book] true, but there's more. And it was worse."&lt;ref name="McCracken, Elizabeth"&gt;{{cite news | last = McCracken | first = Elizabeth | title = Depp Charge | work = [[ELLE]] | date = June 1998 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depp even traded his car for Thompson's red [[Chevrolet Caprice]] [[convertible]], known to fans as The Great Red Shark, and drove it around [[California]] during his preparation for the role.&lt;ref name="Holden, Michael"&gt;{{cite news | last = Holden | first = Michael John Perry, Bill Borrows | title = ''Fear and Loathing'' | work = Loaded | date = December 1998 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the costumes that Depp wears in the film are genuine articles of clothing that Depp borrowed from Thompson, and the writer himself shaved Depp's head to match his own natural [[male pattern baldness]].&lt;ref name="Brinkley, Douglas" /&gt; Other props, such as Duke's [[cigarette filter]] (a TarGard Permanent Filter System), Hawaiian shirts, hats, a patchwork jacket, a silver medallion (given to him by Oscar Acosta) and IDs, belonged to Thompson.&lt;ref name="Holden, Michael" /&gt;

===Writing===
Cox started writing the screenplay with [[Tod Davies]], a [[UCLA]] Thompson scholar. During pre-production, Cox and producer Laila Nabulsi had "creative differences" and she forced Rhino to choose between her and Cox.&lt;ref name="Ebner, Mark" /&gt; She had an arrangement with Thompson to produce the film and the studio fired Cox and paid him $60,000 in script fees. Thompson's disapproval of the Cox/Davies script treatment is documented in the film ''[[Breakfast with Hunter]].''

The decision was made to not use the Cox/Davies script, which gave Gilliam only ten days to write another.&lt;ref name="Gale, David"&gt;{{cite news | last = Gale | first = David | title = Cardboard Castles and Chaos | work = | pages = 102–105 | publisher = Icon | date = June 1998 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilliam has stated in an interview "When we were writing the script, we really tried not to invent anything. We sort of cannibalized the book."&lt;ref&gt;clamenza 33 (September 21, 2008).'Terry Gilliam Interview - Fear &amp; Loathing'.Youtube. Real to Reel interview. Retrieved from:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QOU8wS7jI&lt;/ref&gt; The director enlisted the help of [[Tony Grisoni]] and they wrote the script at Gilliam's home in May 1997. Grisoni remembers, "I'd sit at the keyboard, and we'd talk and talk and I'd keep typing."&lt;ref name="Gale, David" /&gt; One of the most important scenes from the book that Gilliam wanted to put in the film was the confrontation between Duke and Dr. Gonzo and the waitress of the North Star Coffee Lounge. The director said, "This is two guys who have gone beyond the pale, this is unforgivable – that scene, it's ugly. My approach, rather than to throw it out, was to make that scene the low point."&lt;ref name="Smith, Giles"&gt;{{cite news | last = Smith | first = Giles | title = War Games | pages = 74–79 | work = [[The New Yorker]] | date = May 25, 1998 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1998/05/25/1998_05_25_074_TNY_LIBRY_000015613 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Initially, the studio wanted Gilliam to update the book for the 1990s, which he considered, "And then I looked at the film and said, 'No, that's apologizing. I don't want to apologize for this thing. It is what it is.' It's an artifact. If it's an accurate representation of that book, which I thought was an accurate representation of a particular time and place and people."&lt;ref name="Rowe, Douglas"&gt;{{cite news | last = Rowe | first = Douglas J | title = Terry Gilliam Can Fly Without Acid | agency = Associated Press | date = May 29, 1998 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Terry Gilliam, while speaking to ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' magazine, highlighted if he had updated the movie to the 1990s it would just "be a story about two people going to excess". By keeping it set in the 70's, using the backdrop of the [[Vietnam War]] and a perceived loss of the [[American Dream|American dream]], offers reasoning to the characters actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macabe|first=Bob|year=1998|title=Chemical Warfare|url=http://sightandsounddigitaledition.bfi.org.uk/launch.aspx?eid=585ae1b0-ab57-4ba9-b071-bee98aed80e5|journal=Sight and Sound|volume=8|pages=6–8|via=Sight and Sound digital archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writers credit dispute with WGA ===
When the film approached release, Gilliam learned that the [[Writers Guild of America]] (WGA) would not allow Cox and Davies to be removed from the credits even though none of their material was used in the production of the film. According to WGA rules, Gilliam and Grisoni had to prove that they wrote 60% of their script. The director said, "But there have been at least five previous attempts at adapting the book, and they all come from the book. They all use the same scenes."&lt;ref name="McCabe, Bob"&gt;{{cite news | last = McCabe | first = Bob | title = One on One | pages = 120–123 | work = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = December 1998 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilliam remarked in an interview, "The end result was we didn't exist. As a director, I was automatically deemed a 'production executive' by the guild and, by definition, discriminated against. But for Tony to go without any credit would be really unfair."&lt;ref name="Willens, Michele"&gt;{{cite news | last = Willens | first = Michele | title = How Many Writers Does it Take...? | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = May 17, 1998 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; David Kanter, agent for Cox and Davies, argued, "About 60 percent of the decisions they made on what stays in from the book are in the film – as well as their attitude of wide-eyed anarchy."&lt;ref name="Willens, Michele" /&gt; According to the audio commentary by Gilliam on the Criterion Collection DVD, during the period where it appeared that only Cox and Davies would be credited for the screenplay, the film was to begin with a short scene in which it is explained that no matter what is said in the credits, no writers were involved in the making of the film. When this changed in early May 1998 after the WGA revised its decision and gave credit to Gilliam and Grisoni first and Cox and Davies second, the short was not needed.&lt;ref name="Smith, Giles" /&gt; Angered over having to share credit, Gilliam publicly burned his WGA card at a May 22 book signing on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/flwga.htm |title=Dreams: Gilliam burns his WGA card - Pictures! |publisher=Smart.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith, Giles" /&gt;

=== Filming ===
According to Gilliam, there was no firm budget in place when filming started.&lt;ref name="Houpt, Simon"&gt;{{cite news | last = Houpt | first = Simon | title = Going Gonzo with ''Fear and Loathing'' | pages = D1–D2 | work = [[The Globe and Mail]] | date = May 21, 1998 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that it was not a well-organized film and said, "Certain people didn't... I'm not going to name names but it was a strange film, like one leg was shorter than the other. There was all sorts of chaos."&lt;ref name="Gale, David" /&gt; While Depp was on location in [[Los Angeles]], he got a phone call from comedian [[Bill Murray]] who had played Thompson in ''[[Where the Buffalo Roam]]''. He warned Depp, "Be careful or you'll find yourself ten years from now still doing him… Make sure your next role is some drastically different guy."&lt;ref name="Brinkley2"&gt;{{cite news | last =Brinkley | first = Douglas | title = Road to Ruin | work = Sunday Mail | date = July 26, 1998 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shooting on location in Las Vegas began on August 3, 1997 and lasted 56 days. The production ran into problems when they wanted to shoot in a casino. They were only allowed to film between two and six in the morning, given only six tables to put extras around and insisted that the extras really gamble."&lt;ref name="Gale, David" /&gt; Exterior shots of the Bazooko Casino were filmed in front of the Stardust hotel/casino with the interiors constructed with a [[Warner Bros.]] Hollywood soundstage.&lt;ref name="Pizzello, Stephen" /&gt; To get the period look of Vegas in the 1970s, Gilliam and Pecorini used [[Rear projection effect|rear-projection]] footage from the old television show, ''[[Vega$]]''. According to the cinematographer, this footage heightened the film's "already otherworldly tone an extra notch."&lt;ref name="Pizzello, Stephen" /&gt;

===Cinematography===
[[Nicola Pecorini]] was hired based on an audition reel he sent Gilliam that made fun of the fact that he had only one eye (he lost the other to retinal cancer).&lt;ref name="Pizzello, Stephen"&gt;{{cite news | last = Pizzello | first = Stephen | title = Gonzo Filmmaking | pages = 30–41 | work = [[American Cinematographer]] | date = May 1998 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pecorini, the look of the film was influenced by the paintings of [[Robert Yarber]] that are "very hallucinatory: the paintings use all kinds of neon colors, and the light sources don't necessarily make sense."&lt;ref name="Pizzello, Stephen" /&gt; According to Gilliam, they used him as a guide "While mixing our palette of deeply disturbing fluorescent colors."&lt;ref name="Pizzello2"&gt;{{cite news | last = Pizzello | first = Stephen | title = Unholy Grail | pages = 42–47 | work = [[American Cinematographer]] | date = May 1998 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the desert scenes, Pecorini wanted a specific, undefined quality without a real horizon to convey the notion that the landscape never ended and to emphasize "a certain kind of unreality outside the characters' car, because everything that matters to them is within the Red Shark."&lt;ref name="Pizzello, Stephen" /&gt; For the scene where Duke hallucinates a lounge full of lizards, the production was supposed to have 25 animatronic reptiles but they only received seven or eight.&lt;ref name="Pizzello, Stephen" /&gt; The production used [[Motion control photography|motion-control]] techniques to make it look like they had a whole room of them and made multiple passes with the cameras outfitting the lizards with different costumes each time.&lt;ref name="Pizzello, Stephen" /&gt;

During production, it was Gilliam's intention that it should feel like a drug trip from beginning to end. He said in an interview, "We start out at full speed and it's WOOOO! The drug kicks in and you're on speed! Whoah! You get the buzz – it's crazy, it's outrageous, the carpet's moving and everybody's laughing and having a great time. But then, ever so slowly, the walls start closing in and it's like you're never going to get out of this fucking place. It's an ugly nightmare and there's no escape."&lt;ref name="Holden, Michael" /&gt; To convey the effects of the various drugs, Gilliam and Pecorini assembled a list of "phases" that detailed the "cinematic qualities" of each drug consumed.&lt;ref name="Pizzello, Stephen" /&gt; For [[Diethyl ether|ether]], Pecorini said they used a "loose depth of field; everything becomes non-defined"; for [[adrenochrome]], "everything gets narrow and claustrophobic, move closer with lens"; [[mescaline]] was simulated by having "colors melt into each other, flares with no sources, play with color temperatures"; for [[amyl nitrite]], the "perception of light gets very uneven, light levels increase and decrease during the shots"; and for [[LSD]], "everything extremely wide, hallucinations via morphs, shapes, colors, and sound."&lt;ref name="Pizzello, Stephen" /&gt;

Pecorini and Gilliam decided they wanted the film to be shot wide-angle but because of the small budget they couldn't afford the downfalls of anamorphic lenses so they paired the [[Arriflex 535]], [http://panavision.fr/produits/cameras-films-35mm-arriflex-bl-4s/ Arri BL-4S] and the Arri 35-iii with a set of Zeiss Standard Primes and Kodak's 250D Vision 5246 filmstock in order to achieve the saturated look the film has.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theasc.com/magazine/may98/gonzo/pg2.htm|title=Gonzo Filmmaking - page 2|website=www.theasc.com|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' underwent preview [[test screening]]s – a process that Gilliam does not enjoy. "I always get very tense in those (test screenings), because I'm ready to fight. I know the pressure from the studio is, 'somebody didn't like that, change it!{{' "}}&lt;ref name="McCracken, Elizabeth" /&gt; The filmmaker said that it was important to him that Thompson like the film and recalls the writer's reaction at a screening, "Hunter watched it for the first time at the premiere and he was making all this fucking noise! Apparently it all came flooding back to him, he was reliving the whole trip! He was yelling out and jumping on his seat like it was a roller coaster, ducking and diving, shouting 'SHIT! LOOK OUT! GODDAMN BATS!' That was fantastic – if he thought we'd captured it, then we must have done it!"&lt;ref name="Holden, Michael" /&gt; Thompson himself stated, "Yeah, I liked it. It's not my show, but I appreciated it. Depp did a hell of a job. His narration is what really held the film together, I think. If you hadn't had that, it would have just been a series of wild scenes."&lt;ref name="Johnston, Ian"&gt;{{cite news | last = Johnston | first = Ian | title = Just Say No | work = [[Neon (magazine)|Neon]] | pages = 44–49 | date = December 1998 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' debuted at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]]&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4898/year/1998.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas |accessdate=2009-09-29|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gilliam said, "I'm curious about the reaction... If I'm going to be disappointed, it's because it doesn't make any waves, that people are not outraged."&lt;ref name="Kirkland, Bruce"&gt;{{cite news | last = Kirkland | first = Bruce | title = The Gonzo Dream: The Long, Strange Trip of Filming Hunter S. Thompson's '"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' | work = [[Toronto Sun]] | date = May 17, 1998 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Home media ===
By the time ''Fear and Loathing'' was released as a [[The Criterion Collection|Criterion Collection]] [[DVD]] in 2003, Thompson showed his approval of the Gilliam version by recording a full-length [[audio commentary]] for the film and participating in several DVD special features.&lt;ref name="criterion"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.criterion.com/asp/release.asp?id=175|title=''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas''|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[Criterion Collection]]|accessdate=2008-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On an [[audio commentary]] track in the Criterion edition of the DVD, Gilliam expresses great pride in the film and says it was one of the few times where he did not have to fight extensively with the studio during the filming.&lt;ref name="gilliamcommentary"&gt;{{cite news|title=''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' DVD audio commentary|last=Gilliam|first=Terry|date=|publisher=[[Criterion Collection]]|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilliam chalks this up to the fact that many of the studio executives read Thompson's book in their youth and understood it could not be made into a conventional Hollywood film. However, he does express frustration with the advertising campaign used during its initial release, which he says tried to sell it as wacky comedy.&lt;ref name="gilliamcommentary" /&gt; The film was later released by [[Universal Studios]] on [[HD DVD]] and, subsequently, [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]]; Criterion released the film on Blu-ray on April 26, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/215-fear-and-loathing-in-las-vegas|title=Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas|last=|first=|date=|website=The Criterion Collection|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

=== Box office ===
The film opened in [[wide release]] on May 22, 1998 and grossed $3.3 million in 1,126 theaters on its first weekend. The film went on to gross $10.6 million, well below its budget of $18.5 million.&lt;ref name="boxoffice"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=fearandloathinginlasvegas.htm|title=''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas''|last=|first=|date=|work=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2008-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the movie reignited interest in Thompson's novel. [[Vintage Books|Vintage Press]] reported an initial reprint of 100,000 copies to tie in with the film's release, but demand was higher than expected and forced the novel to go back to print a further five times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maryles|first=Daisy|year=1998|title=A second helping for fear and loathing|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=16bb8148-9bce-45c2-96d6-2f03f57a4ab0%40sessionmgr103&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=128|journal=The Publishers Weekly|volume=245|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical response ===
Gilliam wanted to provoke strong reactions to his film as he said in an interview, "I want it to be seen as one of the great movies of all time, and one of the most hated movies of all time."&lt;ref name="McCracken, Elizabeth" /&gt; ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' polarized critics; it currently has a 49% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with the site's critical consensus reading, "Visually creative, but also aimless, repetitive, and devoid of character development."&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The New York Times]]'', Stephen Holden wrote, "Even the most precise cinematic realizations of Mr. Thompson's images  don't begin to match the surreal ferocity of the author's language."&lt;ref name="holden2"&gt;{{cite news | last = Holden | first = Stephen | title = A Devotedly Drug-Addled Rampage Through a 1971 Vision of Las Vegas | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = May 22, 1998 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Hunter, in his review for the ''[[Washington Post]]'', wrote, "It tells no story at all. Little episodes of no particular import come and go...But the movie is too grotesque to be entered emotionally."&lt;ref name="Hunter, Stephen"&gt;{{cite news | last = Hunter | first = Stephen | title = ''Fear and Loathing'' | work = [[Washington Post]] | date = May 22, 1998 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Clark, of ''[[USA Today]]'', found the film, "simply unwatchable."&lt;ref name="Clark, Mike"&gt;{{cite news | last = Clark | first = Mike | title = ''Fear'' is a Bad Trip for the '90s | work = [[USA Today]] | date = May 22, 1998 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Guardian]]'', Gaby Wood wrote, "After a while, though, the ups and downs don't come frequently enough even for the audience, and there's an element of the tedium usually found in someone else's druggy experiences."&lt;ref name="Wood, Gaby"&gt;{{cite news | last = Wood | first = Gabby | title = Night of the Hunter | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = November 13, 1998 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] found the film disgraceful, giving it one star out of four and calling it "a horrible mess of a movie, without shape, trajectory or purpose–a one joke movie, if it had one joke. The two characters wander witlessly past the bizarre backdrops of Las Vegas (some real, some hallucinated, all interchangeable) while zonked out of their minds. Humor depends on attitude. Beyond a certain point, you don't have an attitude, you simply inhabit a state."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/fear-and-loathing-in-las-vegas-1998|title=Fear and loathing in Las Vegas|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=22 May 1998|website=Roger Ebert.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gene Siskel]]'s "thumbs-up" review at the time also noted the film successfully captured the book's themes into film, adding "What the film is about and what the book is about is using Las Vegas as a metaphor for – or a location for – the worst of America, the extremes of America, the money obsession, the visual vulgarity of America."&lt;ref name="Siskel, Gene"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/atm/reviews.html?sec=1&amp;subsec=2108|title=Siskel &amp; Ebert Review|last=Siskel|first=Gene|date=May 22, 1998|work=''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel &amp; Ebert]]''|accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael O'Sullivan gave the film a positive review in the ''Washington Post''. "What elevates the tale from being a mere drug chronicle is the same thing that lifted the book into the realm of literature. It's the sense that Gilliam, like Thompson, is always totally in command of the medium, while abandoning himself utterly to unpredictable forces beyond his control."&lt;ref name="Sullivan, Michael"&gt;{{cite news | last = O'Sullivan | first = Michael | title = ''Fear'': Worth the Trip | work = [[Washington Post]] | date = May 22, 1998 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine voted the film the 469th greatest film in their "500 Greatest Movies of All Time" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.empireonline.com/500/6.asp|title=500 Greatest Movies of All Time|last=|first=|date=|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cult status===
Since the film's release on home media, including [[The Criterion Collection]] Special Edition, the film had attained cult status. This led to the film being re-screened at various cinemas such as The Prince Charles Cinema in [[Leicester Square]], London and a special screening from original VHS tape at Swordtail Studio London in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - VHS Cinema Film Screening | url=https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/fear-and-loathing-in-las-vegas-vhs-cinema-film-screening-tickets-30167262093# | date=13 December 2016 | website=EventBite | access-date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased attention for the film has also led to some news outlets to reconsider the mixed original reception of the film; Joe Queenan of ''[[The Guardian]]'' remarked that for many, "No, ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' is not breathtakingly self-indulgent and just plain awful; it is actually jaw-droppingly great. Those of you who do not share this opinion are idiots."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Cult films: just bad movies in a good disguise? | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/19/cult-films-bad-movies-classic-big-trouble-little-china | date=19 June 2014 | website= The Guardian | access-date=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Tobias of [[The A.V. Club]] argued in his more recent review of the film that "the film would have had a greater impact had it been produced at the time, when ''[[Brewster McCloud]]'' proved that anything was possible, but short of a time machine, Gilliam does what he can to bring the era back to life.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Looking back at Terry Gilliam’s Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas| url=http://www.avclub.com/article/ifear-and-loathing-in-las-vegasi-52308 | date=24 February 2011 | website= The A.V. Club | access-date=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
The film was nominated for a variety of awards that both praised and condemned it. Terry Gilliam was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] 1998 while Johnny Depp won the best foreign actor award from the Russian Guild of Film Critics in 1998.

However Depp and Del Toro were also nominated by the [[Stinkers Bad Movie Awards]] for worst on-screen couple, and during the same awards Del Toro's portrayal of Dr. Gonzo was also nominated for the worst supporting actor.

'''''Gremlins 2: The New Batch ''''' is a 1990 American [[comedy horror]] film, and the sequel to the 1984 film ''[[Gremlins]]''. It was directed by [[Joe Dante]] and written by [[Charles S. Haas]], with creature designs by [[Rick Baker]]. It stars [[Zach Galligan]], [[Phoebe Cates]], [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]], [[Robert Prosky]], [[Haviland Morris]], [[Dick Miller]], [[Jackie Joseph]], [[Robert Picardo]] and [[Christopher Lee]]; additionally, the film features [[Tony Randall]] and [[Frank Welker]] providing the voices for two gremlins. The story continues the adventures of the creature Gizmo (once again voiced by [[Howie Mandel]]), who spawns numerous small monsters when wet. In the first film, Gizmo's offspring rampaged through a small fictional town. In ''Gremlins 2'', Gizmo multiplies within a skyscraper in [[New York City]]. The new creatures thus pose a serious threat to the city should they be able to leave the building, and much of the story involves the human characters' efforts to prevent this disaster.

As with the first film, ''Gremlins 2'' is a live action horror comedy film; however, Dante put effort into taking the sequel in new [[anarchic comedy film|anarchistic]] directions. The film is meant to be more cartoon-like and less dark than the original, and the violence is fairly slapstick. There are also a number of parodies of other films and stories, most notably ''Gremlins'' itself, as well as the ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]'' films, ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]'' and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]''. As with the first film, critical response varied. Some critics who thought the first film was too dark gave ''Gremlins 2'' better reviews, but it received a colder reception from fans who thought otherwise.

==Plot==
After the death of his owner Mr. Wing, the mogwai Gizmo becomes the guinea pig of scientists at the Clamp Center, a state-of-the-art highrise building in [[Manhattan]], owned by eccentric billionaire Daniel Clamp. At the mercy of the chief researcher Dr. Catheter, Gizmo is rescued by his friend Billy Peltzer and his fiancée Kate, both of whom work for the company. Clamp befriends Billy upon being impressed by his skills in concept design, also sparking the interest of Billy's superior Marla Bloodstone. Gizmo is left in the office, where water spills on his head and spawns four new mogwai (George, Lenny, Mohawk and Daffy) who then lock Gizmo in the vents. They eat after midnight, turning into gremlins.

After Gizmo finds a way out of the vent, Mohawk tortures him by beating him, shocking him with an electrical wire, putting him in the photocopier, putting Velcro strips on him and ripping them off, and finally ramming him with a toy train while the other gremlins cause the [[fire sprinkler]]s to go off and spawn a gremlin army that throws the building into chaos. Billy attempts to lure the gremlins into the lobby, where sunlight will kill them; after Billy briefs Clamp on gremlin knowledge, Clamp exits through a secret tunnel to cover the front of the building in a giant sheet to trick the creatures. The gremlins devour serums in the lab; one becomes the intelligent Brain Gremlin, who plans to use a "genetic [[sunscreen|sunblock]]" serum to immunize them to sunlight. One gremlin turns into a female, while a third becomes pure electricity which he kills Dr. Catheter and is trapped in Clamp's [[answering machine]] by Billy. All the while "Grandpa Fred" films the chaos on camera with help from a Japanese tourist named Mr. Katsuji.

Murray Futterman, Billy's neighbor from Kingston Falls who is visiting [[New York City]], encounters a bat-hybrid gremlin and covers it with cement, effectively turning it into a gargoyle. Murray realizes that he is not crazy and that he has to help; when Clamp escapes the building using his secret route, Murray uses it to sneak inside to aid Billy. Billy and chief of security Forster team up, but Forster is stalked and chased off by the female gremlin. Mohawk finishes torturing Gizmo and devours a spider serum, transforming into a monstrous half-gremlin, half-spider hybrid. He attacks Kate and Marla, but Gizmo confronts Mohawk and kills him with an ignited bottle of [[Correction fluid|white-out]]. Outside, a rainstorm frustrates Clamp's plan as the gremlins gather in the building's foyer, singing "[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]]".

Billy formulates a plan to kill the Gremlin army: Mr. Futterman sprays the army with water while Billy releases the electric gremlin, electrocuting them. Clamp charges in with the police and press, but sees the battle is over; he is so thrilled by the end result that he gives Billy, Kate, Fred, and Marla promotions and hires Mr. Katsuji as a cameraman. Billy and Kate then return home with Gizmo. Forster notifies Clamp that he is trapped at the highest floor of the building. The female gremlin corners him and entices him to marry her.

==''Looney Tunes'' segments==
Along with the main plot, there is [[animation]] by [[Chuck Jones]] in the film featuring the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' characters [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Porky Pig]] (who are now voiced by [[Jeff Bergman]], due to the death of [[Mel Blanc]], the original voice actor). Jones had actually quit animation before returning to work on ''Gremlins 2''.&lt;ref name="Hinson"&gt;{{cite news|first=Hal|last=Hinson|title=Gremlins 2: The New Batch|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=|date=June 15, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dante explained the animation at the beginning of the film was meant to "set the anarchic tone."&lt;ref name=DVD&gt;{{cite video |people=DVD commentary |date=2002 |title=Gremlins 2: The New Batch |url= |medium= |language= |trans_title= |publisher=Warner Home Video |location= |accessdate= |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first scene appears at the very beginning of the movie, and features the classic "Looney Tunes" opening card, causing people to assume it is the short cartoon that usually plays before a movie begins; however, when Bugs Bunny appears through the rings on top of the Warner Brothers shield, Daffy interrupts the intro, and steals the shield from Bugs. Daffy attempts to recreate the opening with himself in place of Bugs Bunny, but the shield overshoots, causing the entire title card to fall apart. Daffy surrenders the stardom, claiming that since he won't star in the cartoon, they might as well just skip straight to the movie. Bugs is willing to do so, and spins Daffy off screen like a spinning top for the movie title to appear.

The DVD and Blu-ray include a longer version of the cartoon short. In it, Daffy is informed by Bugs that he has been promoted to executive and is subsequently put in charge writing the title of the movie. When Daffy mistakenly writes the title ''Gremlins 2'' as "Gremlin Stew", Bugs corrects the error. Daffy then attempts to rename the film ''The Return of Super-Daffy Meets Gremlins 2 Part 6: The Movie'', but Bugs rejects this for being too long, changing it back to ''Gremlins 2'' (rendered in the font of the official logo). Daffy then quits his new job and Bugs decides to add in the subtitle, saying it looks "a little skimpy". This material was removed from the film because early audiences expected a live-action film and were bewildered by the lengthy animated sequence.

Throughout the film's closing credits, Daffy pops into frame sporadically and spouts off sarcastic comments. The last scene appears after the credits, and again features the Looney Tunes rings. This time, Porky Pig comes out of the rings and says his usual "Th-th-th-that's all, folks!" However, Daffy Duck interrupts again and takes over. After Daffy says the slogan, the back of the Warner Bros. shield, with the words, "Title Animation Written &amp; Directed by Chuck Jones (with Chuck Jones' signature)", smashes him. He peeks his head out to the left side and says, "Fade out," and the segment ends.&lt;ref name="additional commentary"&gt;{{cite video |people=DVD commentary, Additional Scenes|date=2002 |title=Gremlins 2: The New Batch |url= |medium= |language= |trans_title= |publisher=Warner Home Video |location= |accessdate= |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

The original ''Gremlins'' was a financial success, and [[Warner Bros.]] asked its director Joe Dante to make a sequel straight away. Dante declined, because he saw ''Gremlins'' as having a proper ending, and thus a sequel would only be meant to be profitable. Moreover, the original film was a taxing experience for Dante, and he wanted to move on. Work on ''Gremlins 2'' continued without him, as the studio approached various directors and writers. Storylines considered included sending the gremlins to cities like [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] or even the planet Mars. After these ideas fell through, the studio returned to Dante, who agreed to make the sequel after receiving the rare promise of having complete creative control over the movie; he also received a budget triple that of the original film's. Dante later acknowledged that by this point too much time had passed between the films, thus possibly reducing ''Gremlins 2''{{'}}s appeal.&lt;ref name="special"&gt;{{cite video |people=DVD commentary; Special edition|date=2002 |title= Steven Spielberg presents ''Gremlins.''|url= |medium=DVD |language= |trans_title= |publisher=Warner Home Video |location= |accessdate= |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gremlins 2'' was shot in New York in June 1989, the film was released in 1990, and as the filmmakers later noted, this was a time when cable television, genetics, and [[frozen yogurt]] were becoming more common and influential. This left a mark on ''Gremlins 2''. ''Gremlins 2'' exaggerated what could be seen on cable television at the time, although as the filmmakers noted in 2002, that humour might be lost on present-day audiences. Cable television later grew to provide the same variety. Genetics in 1990 is reflected in the laboratory scene in ''Gremlins 2'', and frozen yogurt is what the mogwai eat after midnight.&lt;ref name=DVD/&gt;

===Plotting===
With more control over the film, Dante engineered a project that he later referred to as "one of the more unconventional studio pictures, ever." Dante included some material that he believed Warner Bros. would not have allowed had they not wanted a sequel to ''Gremlins''. Allowed to break a number of rules in filmmaking, he also later claimed it was the film into which he had put the most of his personal influence. Dante imagined ''Gremlins 2'' as a satire of ''Gremlins'' and sequels in general. Another basic description of ''Gremlins 2'' was that, as Dante said, an hour into the film it becomes "extremely cartoony."&lt;ref name=DVD/&gt;

The recommended screenwriter, Charlie Haas, brought to the project the basic storyline of moving the gremlins to New York City, and he also imagined a corporate head (the character Clamp) being Billy's boss and at the center of the new disaster. When the Warner Bros. executives grew concerned about the expense of portraying the gremlins attacking an entire city, Haas came up with the idea of confining the action within Daniel Clamp's "smart building". Haas also included a great deal of material in his screenplay that proved too elaborate to produce, including having a cow–hamster [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] running on a treadmill in the laboratory.&lt;ref name=DVD/&gt;

In keeping with Dante's desires to satirize the original film, the sequel has some [[meta-reference]]s and [[self-referential humor]]. These include a cameo appearance by film critic [[Leonard Maltin]]. He holds up a copy of the original ''Gremlins'' home video and denounces it, just as he had in reality; however, his rant is cut short when gremlins pounce on him. Partly for this scene, one academic called Dante "one of contemporary cinema's great pranksters."&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Christopher|date=Summer 2000
|title=Toys in the Attic: The Unsung Pleasures (And Terrors) of 'Babe: Pig in the City'|journal=[[Film Quarterly]]|volume=53|issue=4|page=44|publisher=|location=|issn=|pmid=|pmc=
|doi=10.1525/fq.2000.53.4.04a00050|bibcode=|oclc=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, when Billy is trying to explain the rules regarding the mogwai to staff in the building, the staff find them quite absurd and derisively interrogate Billy on their precise meaning; at one point considering the [[thought experiment]] of a mogwai in a plane which crosses a time zone. This scene originates from the fact that the filmmakers themselves saw the rules as irrational, and some questions in the scene were based upon those raised by fans of the original film.&lt;ref name=DVD/&gt;

At one point in the film, Dante attempted to involve his audience in the story by making it seem as if the gremlins had taken control of the theatre where ''Gremlins 2'' was showing. The film strip appears to be broken by the gremlins, who then engage in [[shadow play|shadow puppetry]] over a white screen before replacing the reel with the vintage nudie film ''Volleyball Holiday''. [[Hulk Hogan]] then makes a cameo appearance as an audience member and intimidates the gremlins into running the rest of ''Gremlins 2''. This joke was inspired by a similar stunt in [[William Castle]]'s film ''[[The Tingler]]'' (1959). The studio feared that people might leave the theatre if they thought the film had broken; Dante therefore secured the inclusion of the sequence by assembling some people for a preview of the film. When the scene was shown, the real-life audience found it enjoyable and stayed in the theatre. Dante later described this scene as one of the most widely enjoyed jokes in ''Gremlins 2''. When the film made its debut on home video, the filmmakers replaced the scene, to make it seem as if the viewer's VCR had been broken by the gremlins. In this version, the gremlins do their shadow puppetry over [[white noise]] before changing the VCR's channels. Their antics stop at a broadcast of ''[[Chisum]]'', where [[John Wayne]] forces the gremlins into continuing the film, although voice impersonation was needed since Wayne had been dead since 1979; actor [[Chad Everett]] was recommended by Wayne's son [[Patrick Wayne]].&lt;ref name=DVD/&gt; Notably, a clip from ''[[Falling Hare]]'', a film released in 1943 featuring Bugs Bunny and a gremlin, appears in this version. These sequences occur in lieu of the Hulk Hogan sequence which also featured [[Paul Bartel]]; home video audiences would not see these sequences until the DVD release (which includes the reworked VHS scene as a bonus feature).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=4734 |title=Gremlins 2: The New Batch |publisher=Movie-Censorship.com |date=May 11, 2010 |accessdate=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original version of the film was longer, but executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]] claimed that there were too many gremlins, and several scenes were cut as a result. One deleted scene portrayed three of the main gremlins, Daffy, Lenny, and George, sneaking into television host Grandpa Fred's studio and "helping" him host, acting on the premise that Grandpa Fred's show was intended to be scary (though this scene was later included in the tie-in novel).&lt;ref name="additional commentary"/&gt;

===Casting===
Several actors from the original film returned to make ''Gremlins 2'', including Galligan, Cates, and Dick Miller. Miller reprised his role as Billy's neighbor Mr. Futterman, who the gremlins severely injured (both physically and mostly mentally) in the first film, in an expanded role in this film. In the second, he plays a part in wiping out the creatures by dousing one in cement and using the building's fire hose against the others. [[Character actor|Character actress]] Jackie Joseph returned to play Mr. Futterman's wife, and there were also brief reappearances in the movie theatre sequence from [[Belinda Balaski]] as a complaining mother and [[Kenneth Tobey]] as the projectionist. Keye Luke also returned to play Mr. Wing, Gizmo's original owner. When Luke heard his character would die in ''Gremlins 2'', he quipped, "Remember, when you make ''Gremlins 3'', I'm a [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]!". [[Hoyt Axton]] was meant to return as Billy's father, the inventor. He would have appeared at the end of the film, having designed special clothing for Gizmo that would ensure Gizmo would never come into contact with water again. At the last moment, the filmmakers decided not to shoot the scene to reduce time.&lt;ref name=DVD/&gt;

New performers included [[Robert Picardo]], who had previously worked with Dante and producer [[Michael Finnell]] in films such as ''[[The Howling (film)|The Howling]]'' (1981). He plays Forster, one of Billy's crueler bosses. [[Robert Prosky]] played Grandpa Fred, a television host, and his character was based upon [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]]'s character [[the Munsters|Grandpa Munster]]. Joe Dante has a brief cameo as the director of Grandpa Fred's show. [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]] played Clamp (character based upon [[Donald Trump]] and [[Ted Turner]]) and brought to the role an enthusiastic innocence that overrode the fact that his character had been written as a [[villain]], which Dante thought lightened the film in general.&lt;ref name=DVD/&gt;

Christopher Lee (who previously worked with Spielberg in ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'') played the [[mad scientist]] Dr. Catheter. Lee imagined his role as light-hearted; but Dante encouraged him to portray the scientist as [[evil]] to better match the atmosphere of the laboratory set. Lee was revered on the set for his experience.&lt;ref name=DVD/&gt; In a deleted scene, Dr. Catheter examines a [[bat]] injected with "genetic sun-block". He then says to his colleague, "I'm told they sometimes feed on blood"; this is a reference to Lee's performances as [[Dracula|Count Dracula]] in the ''[[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Horror]]'' films.&lt;ref name="additional commentary"/&gt; Later, as the Bat Gremlin is transforming, Dr. Catheter experiences [[Deja-vu]] (the audience hears [[Dracula]] music).

===Special effects===
[[Image:Gremlins2bat.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Director [[Joe Dante]] (left) holds a cardboard "Bat Gremlin", with actor [[Dick Miller]] (arms raised). A [[stop motion]] model replaced the cardboard gremlin in post-production.]]
For [[special effect]]s, the original film relied on [[Chris Walas]], who moved on to pursue a directing career. Dante turned to [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winner [[Rick Baker]] to create the effects for ''Gremlins 2''. Baker was not interested, as he saw ''Gremlins 2'' as too much work for a project in which he would not be the creator but rather a successor to Walas. He was eventually persuaded to accept the job when it was suggested he could make the gremlins and mogwai more diverse.&lt;ref name=DVD/&gt;

In the first film, when Gizmo multiplied, his off-spring closely resembled himself, except for the leader, Stripe. Here, the four mogwai Gizmo produces each possess their own distinct personalities and physical features. Additionally, each mogwai has a name, although the names were used in the script and never spoken aloud in the film. Two of the mogwais were George, black without a stripe and a caricature of [[Edward G. Robinson]], and Lenny, buck-toothed, named for the principal characters in ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'', whom they resemble in both appearance and demeanor. Daffy was named for his manic behaviour, and the leader, Mohawk, for his [[mohawk hairstyle]]. Based on the original film's character, Stripe, [[Frank Welker]] also voices Mohawk. While both the mogwai and gremlin versions of Stripe had fur stripes, Baker hit upon the idea of giving the Mohawk mogwai a fur stripe and giving the Mohawk gremlin something scalier. Gizmo was also redesigned; the puppet was generally larger and its design was simplified. Dante commented Gizmo may look less real in ''Gremlins 2'', but the result was that Gizmo could convey more [[anthropomorphism|emotion]].&lt;ref name=DVD/&gt;

Later on, when the mogwai metamorphose into gremlins and multiply, they further diversify by running amok in the bio-lab and ingesting various drugs. One turns into a sunlight-resistant hybrid with a bat, thus becoming the Bat Gremlin. Mohawk becomes part-[[spider]]. One becomes part-vegetable (Vegetable Gremlin, as Dante named it), and another consumes a drug and turns into a female gremlin, referred to in at least one script as the "Girl Gremlin" and in the official trading card series and other promotional materials as "Lady Gremlina" with shiny red lips and mascara. Yet another has acid thrown onto his face, quickly presenting a mask of [[the Phantom of the Opera]].&lt;ref name=DVD/&gt;

As with the first, [[puppetry]] was involved, and some of the puppets were mechanical. An actor holding a puppet would have to have wires strapped to him. ''Gremlins 2'' also includes more [[stop motion]] animation than the first film; the Bat Gremlin was portrayed through some stop motion animation. Film technology since the original had improved, and as a result the creatures can be seen walking more. Gizmo is able to dance, although this scene took the longest to make. Because there are more gremlins in ''Gremlins 2'' than the original, additional filming lasted five months. Many of the effects had to be completed after the actors had finished their work.&lt;ref name="DVD"/&gt;

For the Gremlins' voices, [[Howie Mandel]] returned as the voice of Gizmo, while [[Tony Randall]] provided the voice of the Brain Gremlin, [[Frank Welker]] provided the voice for Mohawk, Mark Dodson provided voices for George, Lenny, and Daffy, Joe Dante provided voices for the Beanie Gremlin and the Witch Gremlin, Nancy McConnor provided the voice for the Bat Gremlin, while Kirk Thatcher provided voices for most of the Gremlins, alongside Welker.

As with the first film, the music in ''Gremlins 2'' was composed and conducted by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], who also has a cameo in the film alongside his wife. In the latter half of the film, Gizmo, inspired by the ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]'' films and tired of the abuse he has suffered at the hands of the gremlins, takes revenge on Mohawk. Gizmo shoots the Mohawk spider-gremlin with a makeshift bow and flaming arrow. For the scene in which Gizmo prepares for this move, Goldsmith – who had also authored the music in the ''Rambo'' films – employed a variant of Gizmo's theme in the style of the ''Rambo'' theme.&lt;ref name="DVD"/&gt; The soundtrack was released August 31, 1990 through [[Varèse Sarabande]] and features twelve tracks of score at a running time just under forty minutes.&lt;ref name="filmtracks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/gremlins2.html|title=Gremlins 2: The New Batch|date=March 12, 2005|publisher=[[Filmtracks.com]]|accessdate=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene featuring Mohawk transforming into a spider-like monster features a portion of the song "[[Angel of Death (Slayer song)|Angel of Death]]" by thrash metal band [[Slayer]]. In another scene, the Brain Gremlin leads hundreds of gremlins to sing "[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]]". Dante claimed that "The musical number is a shameless steal" from the film ''[[Dames]]'' (1934).&lt;ref name="cedrone"&gt;{{cite news|first=Lou|last=Cedrone|url=|title=Gremlins 2 hit, suiting Dante just fine: Director happy to taste success again after disappointing Burbs|work=[[The Windsor Star]]|page=C 5|date=June 22, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Film critics varied in their reviews of ''Gremlins 2'', on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 69% based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gremlins_2_the_new_batch | title = Gremlins 2: The New Batch | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate = August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]], who had approved of the first film, observed that ''Gremlins 2'' was meant to satirize sequels. Nevertheless, he felt it did not manage to differentiate itself from the original enough and was not as good. He went on to claim that the film lacks a well-constructed plot, and once the Gremlins arrived the film simply becomes a "series of gags." He thus gave the film two and a half stars, out of a possible four.&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Ebert|authorlink=Roger Ebert|title=Gremlins 2: The New Batch|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]
|publisher=|location=|date=June 15, 1990|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hal Hinson of ''The Washington Post'' caught on to how the ''Looney Tunes'' animation is meant to imply "anarchic wit," but nevertheless felt both the cartoon short and the film itself are failures. He saw the beginning as too slow and, like Ebert, thought the film is too similar to the first. Hinson did, however, approve of the characterization of the gremlins and their version of "New York, New York." He also noted that turning the gremlins against Clamp resembles anti-corporate "poetic justice."&lt;ref name="Hinson"/&gt;

In contrast, while one reviewer for ''Films in Review'', like Ebert, argued the film resembles the original and abandons its plot when the gremlins arrive, he also felt the film's appeal could be found partly in its self-consciousness of these facts and its in-jokes and satire. He also complimented Cates as "wholesomely bewitching," and Galligan as "a suitably naive foil for the scaly fiends."&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=Edmond|date=October 1990

Desson Howe of ''The Washington Post'' also approved of the film, including its special effects and the parodies of Trump, Turner, genetics labs, cable television, and the film ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]''.&lt;ref name="howe"&gt;{{cite news|first=Desson|last=Howe|title=Gremlins 2: The New Batch|url=|work=The Washington Post|date=June 15, 1990|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some critics thought the film has qualities the original lacked, such as wit. A critic for ''National Review'' called the film "much freer and wittier than the first one," though he felt the sequel shies away from becoming an important piece of satire.&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Simon|first=John|date=August 6, 1990
|magazine=[[National Review]]|volume=42|issue=15|pages=48–50|publisher=|oclc=|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The cover of an issue of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' in July 1990 also exclaimed that "actor John Glover... and director Joe Dante made ''Gremlins 2'' wittier, better, and more subversive than the original." Some critics who found the first film too dark also gave ''Gremlins 2'' more positive reviews. Leonard Maltin, who appears in the film, gave it three out of four stars for its references to other films, Glover's imitation of Turner and Trump, and Lee's performance.&lt;ref name="maltin"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0-451-20392-5|oclc=717397017|title=Leonard Maltin's Movie &amp; Video Guide|volume=|last=Maltin|first=Leonard|publisher=A Signet Book

Glover and Picardo were both nominated for the Best Supporting Actor award.

Still, the film did not perform as well at the box office. The trailer introduced the film to audiences by displaying a surface of water intercut with scenes from the original. A narrator goes over the rules regarding how to safely handle mogwai. After the narrator says, "You didn't listen [to the rules]," scenes from the sequel are shown, revealing the gremlins morphing into strange new creatures and then ending with the Brain Gremlin speaking.&lt;ref name="special"/&gt; ''Gremlins 2'' was released into US theatres on June 15, 1990, the same day as ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]''.

It did, however, outperform ''[[Predator 2]]'' ($30,669,413), ''[[Child's Play 2]]'' ($28,501,605) and ''[[The Exorcist III]]'' ($26,098,824).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1990&amp;p=.htm 1990 Domestic Grosses]," ''Box Office Mojo''.

''Gremlins 2'' also played in other countries.

==Merchandising==
As with the first film, merchandising accompanied ''Gremlins 2''. This may have been integral to the film's purpose. As one critic wrote, "it's a savvy, off-the-wall comedy that acknowledges, yes, it is just one more silly rip-off sequel, produced to sell off the merchandise inspired by the first film."&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt; One reference the film makes to the original, an allusion to the merchandising surrounding Gizmo, drew criticism. Some critics saw the mention of merchandise as tasteless. This type of product placement has since become more common.&lt;ref name=DVD/&gt;

The new merchandise released alongside the film included PVC figures, plush, and other collectibles by the now-defunct Applause company in 1990. Much later, action figures by the [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association]] (NECA Toys) based on characters such as the Brain and Mohawk Gremlins were released. NECA is also releasing mogwais and gremlins from the film in late 2011 and 2012; there will be mogwai and gremlin versions of Daffy, Lenny and George, as well as a mogwai version of Mohawk. The Electric gremlin, flasher gremlin and the Phantom of the Opera gremlin will also be released in action figure form by NECA. There are also newer versions of Gizmo being released, including his Rambo look. Greta, a newer version of Mohawk and Mohawk in Spider form are also being planned for the future.

There were also children's books like ''Gremlins 2: The New Batch: Movie Storybook'', by Michael Teitelbaum, published by Goldencraft in December 1990. [[Little Golden Books]] published ''Gremlins 2: The New Batch: Gizmo to the Rescue'' in July 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000A1R4P Gremlins 12" Roto-Cast Brain Action Figure by NECA], ''[[Amazon.com]]'', URL accessed May 22, 2006; [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030765950X Gremlins 2: The New Batch: Movie Storybook (Hardcover) by Michael Teitelbaum], ''Amazon.com'', URL accessed May 22, 2006; [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307125912 Gizmo To Rescue Look-Look Book (Gremlins 2 : the New Batch) (Paperback) by Jim Razzi, Gene Biggs, Kim Ellis (Illustrator)] ''Amazon.com'', URL accessed May 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]], [[William Heinemann Ltd.]] had published two tie-in picture books from Buzz Books in August 1990 which contains photographs and scenes taken from the film. They were titled ''Don't Get Wet'' and ''Midnight Feast''. Buzz Books had also released other picture books that are particularly suitable for children such as ''[[Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends]]'', ''[[Fireman Sam]]'', ''[[List of Tugs books|TUGS]]'', ''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[The Animals of Farthing Wood (TV series)|The Animals of Farthing Wood]]'', ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', ''[[Bugs Bunny]]'', ''[[Joshua Jones (TV series)|Joshua Jones]]'' and ''[[Rupert Bear|Rupert]]''. [[David Bischoff]] wrote a novel based on the film published by [[Avon Books]] in June 1990. A unique aspect of the novel is how Bischoff adapts the sequence where the film breaks. In the novel, the Brain Gremlin subdues and locks Bischoff in his bathroom before taking the reins for a little bit to explain that the Gremlins take over at this point in the film, his displeasure at Bischoff using the nickname "Mr. Glasses" instead of his official name, and begins a treatise on politics before Bischoff breaks his way out of the bathroom with an axe and subdues the Brain Gremlin. The novel then continues where the film picked up after the film break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Spanish company [[Topo Soft]] developed a side-scrolling ''Gremlins 2: The New Batch'' video game for [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[DOS]], [[MSX]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and the [[ZX Spectrum]], distributed by [[Erbe Software]] in Spain and by [[Elite Systems|Elite]] abroad, being the first time a Spanish video game company got an exclusive license from a Hollywood movie to make a videogame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encanta.avalonsoftware.org/idgaw/11/noticias.php |title=El Amiga me Encanta - Amiga World Nº11 - Noticias |publisher=Encanta.avalonsoftware.org |date= |accessdate=February 20, 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hi-Tech Expressions]] also released a DOS game at around the same time, but it was poorly received. [[Sunsoft]] released [[Gremlins 2: The New Batch (video game)|versions]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Game Boy]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;

==Reboot/sequel==
In January 2013, Vulture reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/01/warner-bros-looking-to-breed-gremlins-again-reboot.html|title=Warner Bros.

In a December 2016 interview with ''Bleeding Cool'', Galligan again spoke about a third film saying that "Warner Bros. definitely wants it, Chris Columbus wants to do it because he'd like to undo the ''Gremlins 2'' thing as he wasn't thrilled with it, and Spielberg wants to do it I imagine – because he's Spielberg – and why wouldn't he want to do it." He said that Columbus was now in control of the franchise and once confirmed that there will be no remake or reboot, only a sequel. He also said that Columbus "has been aggressively working on a ''Gremlins 3''" and Columbus even went into some detail about what the third film would be about. ''Gremlins 3'' takes place in present day. He tantalizingly says there will be some new characters and some old characters – I guess in the style of a ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|Force Awakens]]'' type sequel. One thing we know for sure is they have a writer on board. The only insight I can give is the following: There was a 6-year gap between ''Gremlins'' and ''Gremlins 2''; most of that time was spent with them writing and rejecting ideas and re-writing. One of the ideas that was rejected was 'gremlins in [[Vegas]]'. They went with that for 18 months and felt it was too expensive. Eventually they came up with the tower idea, where essentially I'm working for [[Donald Trump]], our new President! That took six years to happen. [[Carl Ellsworth]] has been apparently working on the script for a year and a half now." Galligan said. It is unknown if Joe Dante will return to direct the third film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=John| last=Squires | title=Zach Galligan Offers ‘Gremlins 3’ Update; "Warner Bros.

In a interview with ''[[/Film]]'' in 2017, a script was written by Chris Columbus. His script explored the idea that has been on the fans' minds for a long time: "if all the gremlins come from getting Gizmo wet and feeding his mogwai offspring after midnight, should Gizmo be eliminated?" He described his script as "twisted and dark".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/gremlins-3-has-been-written/|title=Exclusive: ''Gremlins 3'' Has a 'Twisted and Dark' Screenplay Says Writer Chris Columbus|publisher=[[/Film]]|date=August 15, 2017|author=Fred Topel|accessdate=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Herndon Building''' was a [[contributing property]] in the [[Sweet Auburn Historic District]] of [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], located across [[Auburn Avenue]] from the [[Odd Fellows Building and Auditorium]].

Begun in 1924 and completed the following year, it was a three-story L-shaped brick building, "easily recognized by the large H located on the front facade of the building".&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;Frank J. J. Miele, John Sprinkle, and Patti Henry (November 1999) {{NHLS url|id=00000261|title=National Historic Landmark Nomination: Herndon Home}}, National Park Service and {{NHLS url|id=00000261|title=''Accompanying 6 photos, of Herndon and family and of exterior and interior of mansion, from c.1910, c. 1915, 1998''|photos=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was used as a [[professional]] building by several different [[business]]men and women, including a [[clinic|doctor's office]] and a [[pharmacy]].

Vacant and collapsing (shown on Google Maps and Street View), it was already fit for [[Property condemnation|condemnation]] when it was seriously damaged in the [[2008 Atlanta tornado]] (which also passed very close to the [[Herndon Home]]).  It was [[Demolition|demolished]] in late April 2008 as a direct result of this.&lt;ref name="Auchmutey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/atlanta/stories/2008/04/20/herndon_0421.html

The Herndon Building was one of three [[contributing properties]] in the [[historic district]] which were associated with the life of [[Alonzo Herndon]].  The [[Atlanta Life Insurance Company]] Building and the [[Rucker Building]] are the other two.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8567">The '''Höcker Album''' (or '''Hoecker Album''') is a collection of photographs believed to have been collected by [[Karl-Friedrich Höcker]], an officer for the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime in [[Germany]]. It contains over one hundred images of the lives and living conditions of the officers and administrators who ran the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]] concentration camp complex. The album is unique, and an indispensable document of [[the Holocaust]]; it is now in the archives of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] (USHMM) in [[Washington, D.C.]]

==Discovery==
According to the museum, the photograph album was found by an unidentified [[United States|American]] [[counterintelligence]] officer who was [[billet]]ed in [[Frankfurt]] after Germany's surrender in 1945. This officer discovered the photo album in an apartment there, and when he returned to the United States, he brought the album with him.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Alec, [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/03/17/080317fa_fact_wilkinson ''Picturing Auschwitz''], New Yorker Magazine, March 17, 2008.  Page 48&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, the American officer donated the album to the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|USHMM]], with the request that his identity not be disclosed. The captions of the photographs, and the people featured in the images, quickly confirmed that it depicts life in and around the Auschwitz camps. The very first photograph is a double portrait of [[Richard Baer]], [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] camp commandant between 1944 and 1945, and Baer's adjutant, [[Karl-Friedrich Höcker|Karl Höcker]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, pp. 50-51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The album contains 116 photographs, all in [[black and white]], almost all of them featuring German officers. It is believed to have been the property of Höcker because he appears in far more of the images than any other individual. On the title page underneath a picture of Höcker and Baer written is "With the Commandant SS Stubaf. Baer, Auschwitz 21.6.44", identifying Höcker as the owner of the album. He is also the only person in the album to appear alone in any of the images.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, page 51"&gt;Wilkinson, page 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the images depict formal events, like military funerals and the dedication of a new hospital. They also include images of the camp officers relaxing at a staff retreat known as the ''[[Solahütte]],'' a rustic lodge only around 20 miles away from the camp complex. These images are regarded as the most striking, because they show cheerful staff officers singing, drinking and eating while, in the camp itself, tremendous suffering is taking place.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, pp. 48-52&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of the photographs show officers relaxing in the company of young women—stenographers and typists who were known generally as ''[[SS#SS_Womens_Corps|Helferinnen]]'', the German word for (female) "helpers."

==Mengele photographs==
&lt;!--[[Image:HoeckerMengele.png|thumb|right|300px|One of the eight photographs in the Höcker album in which Dr. [[Josef Mengele]] appears.  Mengele is in the center; at left is [[Richard Baer (Nazi)|Richard Baer]], camp commandant.  At right is former commandant [[Rudolf Höss]].]]--&gt;

Both of the camp's most well-known commanders, [[Richard Baer (Nazi)|Richard Baer]] and [[Rudolf Höss]], are visible in the photographs. But possibly the most notorious Auschwitz figure who features in the album is Dr. [[Josef Mengele]], known to camp prisoners as the "Angel of Death." Mengele, a trained physician, directed the medical experiments on twin children in the camp. He regularly took part in the "selection" on the train arrival platform, judging which prisoners would be immediately executed and which would be permitted to live and perform slave labor.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, page 51"/&gt;

In all, the album contains eight photographs in which Mengele appears. Before the donation of the album to the museum, no images were known to exist showing him within the camp grounds.

==Timing of photographs==
The photographs in the Höcker Album are viewed as especially chilling because of the time during which they were made, between June and December 1944.&lt;ref name=Erbelding_NYTimes&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2007/09/18/arts/20070919_ALBUMSS_AUDIOSS.html Erbelding, Rebecca, interview, NYTimes.com, Sept. 18, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted by archivists and historians that this period overlaps with the mass extermination of hundreds of thousands of [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[Jews]] in the spring and summer of 1944—an event known as "the [[Hungarian Transport]]". These Jews were gathered and shipped to Auschwitz after the March 1944 invasion by the Nazis of Hungary. So many Hungarian Jews were killed in the Auschwitz camps during that period that the crematoria were incapable of consuming all the bodies, and open pits for the purpose were dug.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, page 52&lt;/ref&gt; The contrast of these events with the singing, flirting and blueberry-eating in the Höcker album is particularly disturbing.

According to Rebecca Erbelding, the museum archivist who received the album from its donor and first recognized its significance, "the album reminds us that the perpetrators of the Holocaust were human beings, men and women with families, children and pets, who celebrated holidays and took vacations... These people were human beings... and these photographs remind us what human beings are capable of when they succumb to anti-Semitism, racism and hatred."&lt;ref name=Erbelding_NYTimes/&gt;

==Höcker's case==
Höcker married before the war and had a son and daughter during the war, with whom he was reunited after his release from 18 months in a British [[Prisoner-of-war camp|POW camp]] in 1946. Early in the 1960s he was apprehended by West German authorities in his hometown, where he was a bank official. It is not known why the bank rehired and promoted him after a long absence during which he had nothing to do with banking.

At his trial in [[Frankfurt]], part of the noted [[Frankfurt Auschwitz trials]], Höcker denied having participated in the selection of victims at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Birkenau]] or having ever personally executed a prisoner. He further denied any knowledge of the fate of the approximately 400,000 [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Hungarian Jews]] who were murdered at Auschwitz during his term of service at the camp. Höcker was shown to have knowledge of the [[Genocide|genocidal]] activities at the camp, but could not be proved to have played a direct part in them. In postwar trials, Höcker denied his involvement in the selection process. While accounts from survivors and other SS officers all but placed him there, prosecutors could locate no conclusive evidence to prove the claim.

In August 1965 Höcker was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment for [[aiding and abetting]] in over 1,000 murders at Auschwitz. He was released in 1970 and was able to return to his bank post as a chief cashier, where he worked until his retirement.

On 3 May 1989 a district court in the Germany city of Bielefeld sentenced Höcker to four years' imprisonment for his involvement in gassing to death prisoners, primarily [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]], in the [[Majdanek concentration camp]] in [[Poland]]. Camp records showed that between May 1943 and May 1944 Höcker had acquired at least {{Convert|3610|kg}} of [[Zyklon B]] poisonous gas for use in Majdanek from the Hamburg firm of [[Tesch &amp; Stabenow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.jur.uva.nl/junsv/brd/files/brd906.htm Justiz und NS-Verbrechen]{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences''''' was first [[publish]]ed in 1968 and was edited by [[David L. Sills]] and [[Robert K. Merton]]. It contains seventeen volumes and thousands of entries written by scholars around the world. The 2nd edition is composed entirely of new articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gale.cengage.com/servlet/ItemDetailServlet?region=9&amp;imprint=000&amp;titleCode=M83&amp;type=4&amp;cf=p&amp;id=194787 |title=Gale Catalog – International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences, Edition 2 |publisher=Gale.cengage.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in 2008 and edited by [[William A.

Though the 1968 '''''Encyclopedia''''' was initially intended to "complement, not supplant" MacMillan's earlier, fifteen-volume '''''[[Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences]]''''', which had been published from 1930 to 1967 and was edited by American economists [[Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman]] and [[Alvin Saunders Johnson]], it effectively replaced the earlier '''''Encyclopaedia''''', in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1237578|title=The International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences: A Review Article|first=James P.|last=Cavin|date=1 January 1969|publisher=|journal=American Journal of Agricultural Economics|volume=51|issue=2|pages=268–278|via=|doi=10.2307/1237578}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopaedia of Social Sciences, Inc.

'''Labdoor''' is a privately held medical company registered in [[San Francisco, CA]], founded in May 2012 by Neil Thanedar. It provides information on dietary supplements, which do not require testing by the [[FDA]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm050803.htm|title=Consumer Updates - FDA 101: Dietary Supplements|last=Commissioner|first=Office of the|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products and services ==
Since November 2013, Labdoor's primary income is [[affiliate marketing]] for retailers, such as [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], of products they have tested and certified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://labdoor.com/about/business-model|title=Our business model|website=Labdoor|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labdoor also offers testing services to supplement manufacturers, assessing "accuracy," "purity," and "sport."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://labdoor.com/lts/certifications|title=Dietary Supplements Certifications - Labdoor Testing Services|website=Labdoor|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a product passes testing, Labdoor will also "drive sales" through it's certification program and retailer referrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://labdoor.com/lts|title=Labdoor Testing Services - Chemical Laboratory Testing|website=Labdoor|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In June 2018, Labdoor launched the [[Cryptocurrency|crypto-currency]] TEST. It seeks to create a incentive system for individuals or organizations to anonymously create or raise a [[Bounty (reward)#Open-source software|bounty]] on a product for independent laboratories to test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://testtoken.org|title=TEST {{!}} Home|website=testtoken.org|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/test-foundation/test-foundation-launches-to-protect-consumers-through-decentralized-regulation-of-health-products-7e8cb421f2fd|title=TEST Foundation Launches to Protect Consumers through Decentralized Regulation of Health Products|last=Thanedar|first=Neil|date=2018-06-28|website=Medium|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; TEST will be in in [[initial coin offering]] (ICO) stage through December 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://republic.co/test-foundation|title=Invest in TEST|website=republic.co|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labdoor buys dietary supplements directly from retailers, sends the products to an FDA-registered laboratory for analysis,{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} and publishes the findings. Its mission is to share information to help consumers make the right decisions for themselves about dietary supplements.{{According to whom|date=October 2018}} Labdoor's rankings have sometimes been published by the press and online media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2014/07/31/655246/10092442/en/NutriGold-Fish-Oil-Ranked-1-in-the-USA-for-Highest-Quality-by-LabDoor-com.html|title=NutriGold Fish Oil Ranked #1 in the USA for "Highest Quality" by LabDoor.com|website=Globe News|publisher=Globe News|accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://barbend.com/muscle-feast-whey-protein-isolate-review/|title=Muscle Feast Grass-Fed Whey Isolate Review — Why So Cheap?|website=Bar Bend|publisher=Bar Bend|accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.refinery29.com/face-care-tips|title=Science Says This Is A Secret To Clearer Skin|website=Refinery 29|publisher=Refinery 29|accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bannenberg|first=Gerard|last2=Mallon|first2=Craig|last3=Edwards|first3=Holly|last4=Yeadon|first4=Derek|last5=Yan|first5=Kevin|last6=Johnson|first6=Holly|last7=Ismail|first7=Adam|date=2017-05-03|title=Omega-3 Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Content and Oxidation State of Fish Oil Supplements in New Zealand|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-01470-4|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-01470-4|issn=2045-2322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.today.com/food/does-blotting-your-pizza-napkin-really-help-see-what-you-t47061|title=Could blotting your pizza with a napkin really help you lose pounds?|work=TODAY.com|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="78647">{{About|the Jewish mythological figure Lilith}}
[[File:Lilith (John Collier painting).jpg|right|thumb|''[[Lilith (painting)|Lilith]]'' (1892) by [[John Collier (painter)|John Collier]] in Southport Atkinson Art Gallery]]
'''Lilith''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|l|ɪ|θ}}; {{lang-he|לִילִית}} ''Lîlîṯ'') is a figure in [[Jewish mythology]], developed earliest in the [[Babylonian Talmud]] (3rd to 5th centuries). Lilith is often envisioned as a dangerous demon of the night, who is sexually wanton, and who steals babies in the darkness.&lt;ref name="hammer"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hammer|first1=Jill|title=Lilith, Lady Flying in Darkness|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/lilith-lady-flying-in-darkness/|website=My Jewish Learning|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lilith may be linked in part to a historically earlier class of female [[demon]]s (''lilītu'') in [[ancient Mesopotamian religion]], found in [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] texts of [[Sumer]], the [[Akkadian Empire]], [[Assyria]], and [[Babylonia]].

In [[Jewish folklore]],''[[Alphabet of Sirach]]'' (c. 700–1000 CE) onwards, Lilith appears as [[Adam]]'s first wife, who was created at the same time ([[Rosh Hashanah]]) and from the same clay as Adam—compare Genesis 1:27. (This contrasts with [[Eve]], who was created from one of Adam's ribs: Genesis 2:22.) The legend developed extensively during the [[Middle Ages]], in the tradition of [[Aggadah]], the [[Zohar]], and [[Jewish mysticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwartz|first=Howard|authorlink=Howard Schwartz|title=Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5psRDAAAQBAJ|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-532713-7|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the 13th-century writings of [[Isaac Alfasi|Isaac ben Jacob ha-Cohen]], Lilith left Adam after she refused to become subservient to him and then would not return to the [[Garden of Eden]] after she had coupled with the [[archangel]] [[Samael]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kvam|first1=Kristen E.|authorlink1=Kristen E. Kvam|last2=Schearing|first2=Linda S. |authorlink2=Linda S. Schearing|last3=Ziegler|first3=Valarie H.|authorlink3=Valarie H. Ziegler|title=Eve and Adam: Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Readings on Genesis and Gender|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ux3bSDa2rHkC&amp;pg=PA220|year=1999|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-21271-9|pages=220–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence in later Jewish materials is plentiful, but little information has survived relating to the [[Sumer]]ian, [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]ian, [[Assyria]]n and [[Babylonia]]n view of this class of demons. While the connection is almost universally agreed upon, recent scholarship has disputed the relevance of two sources previously used to connect the Jewish ''lilith'' to an Akkadian ''lilītu''—the [[Gilgamesh]] appendix and the [[Arslan Tash amulets]].&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, David Noel, ed., [[Anchor Bible Dictionary]], (New York: Doubleday) 1997, 1992. "Very little information has been found relating to the Akkadian and Babylonian view of these figures. Two sources of information previously used to define Lilith are both suspect."&lt;/ref&gt; (See below for discussion of the two problematic sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kvam|first1=Kristen E.|authorlink1=Kristen E. Kvam|last2=Schearing|first2=Linda S. |authorlink2=Linda S. Schearing|last3=Ziegler|first3=Valarie H.|authorlink3=Valarie H. Ziegler|title=Eve and Adam: Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Readings on Genesis and Gender|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ux3bSDa2rHkC&amp;pg=PA220|year=1999|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-21271-9|pages=174}} "Other scholars, such as Lowell K. Handy, agree that Lilith is derived from Mesopotamian demons but argue against finding evidence of the Hebrew Lilith in many of the epigraphical and artifactual sources frequently cited as such (e.g., the Sumerian Gilgamesh fragment, the Sumerian incantation from Arshlan-Tash)."&lt;/ref&gt;)

In Hebrew-language texts, the term ''lilith'' or ''lilit'' (translated as "night creatures", "night monster", "night hag", or "screech owl") first occurs in a list of animals in Isaiah 34:14, either in singular or plural form according to variations in the earliest manuscripts. In the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] ''[[4Q510-511]]'', the term first occurs in a list of monsters. In Jewish [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] inscriptions on bowls and amulets from the 6th century CE onwards, Lilith is identified as a female demon and the first visual depictions appear.

The resulting Lilith legend continues to serve as source material in modern [[Western culture]], literature, [[occult]]ism, fantasy, and horror.

==Etymology==
The [[Semitic root]] [[Lamedh|L]]-[[Yodh|Y]]-[[Lamedh|L]] served as derivative for the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''layil'' and [[Arabic]] ''layl'', meaning "night". The [[Talmud]]ic and [[Yiddish]] use of ''Lilith'' is cognate with the Hebrew.

In the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] language of [[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]], the terms ''lili'' and ''līlītu'' mean spirits. Some uses of ''līlītu'' are listed in [[Chicago Assyrian Dictionary|The Assyrian Dictionary of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago]] (CAD, 1956, L.190), in [[Wolfram von Soden]]'s ''[[Akkadisches Handwörterbuch]]'' (AHw, p.&amp;nbsp;553), and ''[[Reallexikon der Assyriologie]]'' (RLA, p.&amp;nbsp;47).&lt;ref&gt;Erich Ebeling, Bruno Meissner, Dietz Otto Edzard ''Reallexikon der Assyriologie'' Volume 9 p47,50&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sumer]]ian female demons ''lili'' have no etymological relation to Akkadian ''lilu'', "evening".&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Astour ''Hellenosemitica: an ethnic and cultural study in west Semitic impact on Mycenaean. Greece'' 1965 Brill p138&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Archibald Sayce]] (1882)&lt;ref name="Sayce"&gt;Sayce (1887) {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered that Hebrew ''lilit'' (or ''lilith'') {{lang|he|לילית}} and the earlier Akkadian ''līlītu'' are from [[Proto-Semitic language|proto-Semitic]]. [[Charles Fossey]] (1902)&lt;ref name="Fossey"&gt;Fossey (1902) {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; has this literally translating to "female night being/demon", although [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] inscriptions from [[Mesopotamia]] exist where ''Līlīt'' and ''Līlītu'' refers to disease-bearing wind [[spirit]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Another possibility is association not with "night", but with "wind", thus identifying the Akkadian ''Lil-itu'' as a loan from the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ''lil'' "air" — specifically from ''[[Ninlil]]'', "lady air", [[goddess]] of the [[south wind]] (and wife of [[Enlil]]) — and ''itud'', "moon".{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Mesopotamian mythology==
{{main|Lilu (mythology)}}

===The spirit in the tree in the Gilgamesh cycle===
[[Samuel Noah Kramer]] (1932, published 1938)&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, S. N. ''Gilgamesh and the Huluppu-Tree: A Reconstructed Sumerian Text''. Assyriological Studies 10. Chicago. 1938&lt;/ref&gt; translated ''ki-sikil-lil-la-ke'' as ''Lilith'' in "Tablet XII" of the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] dated c.600 BC. "Tablet XII" is not part of the Epic of Gilgamesh, but is a later [[Assyria]]n [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] translation of the latter part of the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] poem of ''[[Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld]]''.&lt;ref&gt;George, A. ''The epic of Gilgamesh: the Babylonian epic poem and other texts in Akkadian'' 2003 p100 ''Tablet XII. Appendix The last Tablet in the 'Series of Gilgamesh' ''&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ki-sikil-lil-la-ke'' is associated with a serpent and a [[Zu (mythology)|zu bird]].&lt;ref&gt;Kramer translates the zu as "[[owl]]", but most often it is translated as "[[eagle]]", "[[vulture]]", or "[[bird of prey]]".&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld'', a [[willow|huluppu tree]] grows in [[Inanna]]'s garden in [[Uruk]], whose wood she plans to use to build a new throne. After ten years of growth, she comes to harvest it and finds a serpent living at its base, a Zu bird raising young in its crown, and that a ''ki-sikil-lil-la-ke'' made a house in its trunk. Gilgamesh is said to have killed the snake, and then the zu bird flew away to the mountains with its young, while the ''ki-sikil-lil-la-ke'' fearfully destroys its house and runs for the forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=[[Chicago Assyrian Dictionary]] |year=1956 |location=Chicago |publisher=[[University of Chicago]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurwitz (1980) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=6T9Y1EhiwDUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 49]&lt;/ref&gt; Identification of ''ki-sikil-lil-la-ke'' as ''Lilith'' is stated in ''[[Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible]]'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Hutter article in [[Karel van der Toorn]], Bob Becking, [[Pieter Willem van der Horst]] – 1999 pp. 520–521, article cites Hutter's own 1988 work ''Behexung, Entsühnung und Heilung'' [[Eisenbrauns]] 1988. pp. 224–228&lt;/ref&gt; According to a new source from Late Antiquity, Lilith appears in a [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]] magic story where she is considered to represent the branches of a tree with other demonic figures that form other parts of the tree, though this may also include multiple "Liliths".&lt;ref&gt;Müller-Kessler, C. (2002) "A Charm against Demons of Time", in C. Wunsch (ed.), Mining the Archives. Festschrift Christopher Walker on the Occasion of his 60th Birthday (Dresden), p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

Suggested translations for the Tablet XII spirit in the tree include ''ki-sikil'' as "sacred place", ''lil'' as "spirit", and ''lil-la-ke'' as "water spirit".&lt;ref&gt;Roberta Sterman Sabbath ''Sacred tropes: Tanakh, New Testament, and Qur'an as literature and culture'' 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but also simply "owl", given that the ''lil'' is building a home in the trunk of the tree.&lt;ref&gt;''Sex and gender in the ancient Near East: proceedings of the 47th Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale'', Helsinki, July 2–6, 2001, Part 2 p. 481&lt;/ref&gt;

A connection between the Gilgamesh ''ki-sikil-lil-la-ke'' and the Jewish Lilith was rejected by [[Dietrich Opitz]] (1932)&lt;ref&gt;Opitz, D. ''Ausgrabungen und Forschungsreisen'' Ur. AfO 8: 328&lt;/ref&gt; and rejected on textual grounds by Sergio Ribichini (1978).&lt;ref&gt;Ribichini, S.

===The bird-footed woman in the Burney Relief===
{{main|Burney Relief}}
[[File:Burney Relief Babylon -1800-1750.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Burney Relief]], Babylon (1800–1750 BCE). Some scholars (e.g. [[Emil Kraeling]]) incorrectly identified the figure in the relief with Lilith, based on a misreading of an outdated translation of the Epic of Gilgamesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 3218905|title = A Unique Babylonian Relief|last = Kraeling|first = Emil|date = 1937|journal = Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research|issue = 67|pages = 16–18|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern research has identified the figure as one of the main goddesses of the Mesopotamian pantheons, most probably [[Ishtar]] or [[Ereshkigal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 20064325|title = The "Queen of the Night" Plaque: A Revisit|last = Albenda|first = Pauline|date = 2005|journal = Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume = 125|issue = 2|pages = 171–190|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Kramer's translation of the Gilgamesh fragment was used by [[Henri Frankfort]] (1937)&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, H. ''The Burney Relief'' AfO 12: 128, 1937&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Emil Kraeling]] (1937)&lt;ref&gt;Kraeling, E. G. ''A Unique Babylonian Relief'' BASOR 67: 168. 1937&lt;/ref&gt; to support identification of a woman with wings and bird-feet in the [[Burney Relief]] as related to Lilith, but this has been rejected by later sources, including the [[British Museum]], which is in current possession of the piece.
The terracotta plaque depicts a beautiful, naked goddess-like sylph with bird-like features who stands atop two lions and between two owls. Although once believed to be the actual image of Lilith, it is now thought to possibly represent [[Inanna]], the Sumerian goddess of love, fertility, beauty, war, and sexual desire. The depiction of the nocturnal and predatory owls, however, have led many to believe the relief is an affirmation of Lilith’s role as a demon who flies about the underworld, delivering night terrors to those who sleep.

===The Arslan Tash amulets===
{{Main|Arslan Tash amulets}}
The [[Arslan Tash amulets]] are limestone plaques discovered in 1933 at [[Arslan Tash]], the authenticity of which is disputed. [[William F. Albright]], [[Theodor H. Gaster]],&lt;ref&gt;Gaster, T. H. 1942. ''A Canaanite Magical Text''. Or 11:&lt;/ref&gt; and others, accepted the amulets as a pre-Jewish source which shows that the name Lilith already existed in the 7th century BCE but [[Naftali Herz Tur-Sinai|Torczyner]] (1947) identified the amulets as a later Jewish source.&lt;ref&gt;Torczyner, H. 1947. "A Hebrew Incantation against Night-Demons from Biblical Times". JNES 6: 18–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Bible==
The only occurrence is in the [[Book of Isaiah]] 34:14, describing the desolation of [[Edom]], where the Hebrew word ''lilit'' (or ''lilith'') appears in a list of eight unclean animals, some of which may have demonic associations. The word ''lilit'' (or ''lilith'') only [[hapax legomenon|appears once]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]], while the other seven terms in the list appear more than once and thus are better documented. The reading of scholars and translators is often guided by a decision about the complete list of eight creatures as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Jan De Waard ''Translators Handbook on Isaiah''; Delitzsch ''Isaiah''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See ''The animals mentioned in the Bible'' [[Henry Chichester Hart]] 1888, and more modern sources; also entries [[Brown Driver Briggs]] ''Hebrew Lexicon'' for tsiyyim... 'iyyim... sayir... liylith... qippowz... dayah&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting from Isaiah 34 ([[New American Bible|NAB]]):
{{quote|(12) Her nobles shall be no more, nor shall kings be proclaimed there; all her princes are gone. (13) Her castles shall be overgrown with thorns, her fortresses with thistles and briers. She shall become an abode for jackals and a haunt for ostriches. (14) Wildcats shall meet with desert beasts, satyrs shall call to one another; There shall the Lilith repose, and find for herself a place to rest. (15) There the hoot owl shall nest and lay eggs, hatch them out and gather them in her shadow; There shall the kites assemble, none shall be missing its mate. (16) Look in the book of the LORD and read: No one of these shall be lacking, For the mouth of the LORD has ordered it, and His spirit shall gather them there. (17) It is He who casts the lot for them, and with His hands He marks off their shares of her; They shall possess her forever, and dwell there from generation to generation.}}

===Hebrew text===
In the [[Masoretic Text]]:
{{poemquote|Hebrew: וּפָגְשׁוּ צִיִּים אֶת-אִיִּים, וְשָׂעִיר עַל-רֵעֵהוּ יִקְרָא; אַךְ-שָׁם הִרְגִּיעָה '''לִּילִית''', וּמָצְאָה לָהּ מָנוֹח

In the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], among the 19 fragments of [[Isaiah]] found at [[Qumran]], the [[Isaiah scroll|Great Isaiah Scroll]] (1Q1Isa) in 34:14 renders the creature as plural ''liliyyot'' (or ''liliyyoth'').&lt;ref&gt;Blair J. "De-demonising the Old Testament" p.27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher R. A. Morray-Jones ''A transparent illusion: the dangerous vision of water in Hekhalot'' Vol.59 p258 2002 "Early evidence of the belief in a plurality of liliths is provided by the [[Isaiah scroll]] from [[Qumran]], which gives the name as liliyyot, and by the targum to Isaiah, which, in both cases, reads" (Targum reads: "when Lilith the Queen of [Sheba] and of Margod fell upon them.")&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eberhard Schrader]] (1875)&lt;ref&gt;''Jahrbuch für Protestantische Theologie 1'', 1875. p128&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Moritz Abraham Levy]] (1885)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=338&amp;letter=L |author=Levy, [Moritz&amp;#93; A.[braham&amp;#93; (1817–1872)] |title=Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenländischen Gesellschaft |volume= ZDMG 9. 1885 |pages=470, 484 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that Lilith was a goddess of the night, known also by the [[Babylonian captivity|Jewish exiles in Babylon]]. Schrader's and Levy's view is therefore partly dependent on a later dating of [[Deutero-Isaiah]] to the 6th century BC, and the presence of Jews in [[Babylon]] which would coincide with the possible references to the ''{{transl|akk|Līlītu}}'' in Babylonian [[demonology]]. However, this view is challenged by some modern research such as by Judit M. Blair (2009) who considers that the context indicates unclean animals.&lt;ref&gt;Judit M. Blair De-Demonising the Old Testament – An Investigation of Azazel, Lilit (Lilith), Deber (Dever), Qeteb (Qetev) and Reshep (Resheph) in the Hebrew Bible.

===Greek version===
The [[Septuagint]] translates the reference into Greek as ''[[onocentaur|onokentauros]]'', apparently for lack of a better word, since also the ''[[se'irim]]'', "[[satyr]]s", earlier in the verse are translated with ''daimon onokentauros''. The "wild beasts of the island and the desert" are omitted altogether, and the "crying to his fellow" is also done by the ''daimon onokentauros''.&lt;ref&gt;34:14 καὶ συναντήσουσιν δαιμόνια ὀνοκενταύροις καὶ βοήσουσιν ἕτερος πρὸς τὸν ἕτερον ἐκεῖ ἀναπαύσονται '''ὀνοκένταυροι''' εὗρον γὰρ αὑτοῖς ἀνάπαυσιν&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin Bible===
The early 5th-century [[Vulgate]] translated the same word as ''[[lamia]]''.&lt;ref name="Wikisource_Isaiah"&gt;{{cite web

{{quote|et occurrent daemonia onocentauris et pilosus clamabit alter ad alterum ibi cubavit lamia et invenit sibi requiem|Isaiah (Isaias Propheta) 34.14|Vulgate}}

The translation is, "And demons shall meet with monsters, and one hairy one shall cry out to another; there the lamia has lain down and found rest for herself".

===English versions===
[[Wycliffe's Bible]] (1395) preserves the Latin rendering ''lamia'':

{{quote|Isa 34:15 '''Lamya''' schal ligge there, and foond rest there to hir silf.}}

The [[Bishops' Bible]] of [[Matthew Parker]] (1568) from the Latin:

{{quote|Isa 34:14 there shall the '''Lamia''' lye and haue her lodgyng.}}

[[Douay–Rheims Bible]] (1582/1610) also preserves the Latin rendering ''lamia'':

{{quote|Isa 34:14 And demons and monsters shall meet, and the hairy ones shall cry out one to another, there hath the lamia lain down, and found rest for herself.}}

The [[Geneva Bible]] of [[William Madison Whittington]] (1587) from the Hebrew:

{{quote|Isa 34:14 and the '''screech owl''' shall rest there, and shall finde for her selfe a quiet dwelling.}}

Then the [[King James Version]] (1611):

{{quote|Isa 34:14 The wild [[wikt:beast|beasts]] of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the [[island]], and the [[satyr]] shall cry to his fellow; the '''[[screech owl]]''' also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.}}

The "screech owl" translation of the King James Version is, together with the "owl" (''{{transl|he|ISO|yanšup}}'', probably a water bird) in 34:11 and the "great owl" (''{{transl|he|ISO|qippoz}}'', properly a snake) of 34:15, an attempt to render the passage by choosing suitable animals for difficult-to-translate Hebrew words.

Later translations include:
* night-owl (Young, 1898)
* night-spectre (Rotherham, [[Emphasized Bible]], 1902)
* night [[monster]] ([[American Standard Version|ASV]], 1901; [[Jewish Publication Society of America Version|JPS]] 1917, Good News Translation, 1992; [[New American Standard Bible|NASB]], 1995)
* [[vampire]]s (Moffatt Translation, 1922; [[Knox Bible]], 1950)
* night [[hag]] ([[Revised Standard Version]], 1947)
* Lilith ([[Jerusalem Bible]], 1966)
* lilith ([[New American Bible]], 1970)

* [[nightjar]] ([[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures]], 1984)
* night bird ([[English Standard Version]], 2001)

==Jewish tradition==
Major sources in Jewish tradition regarding Lilith in chronological order include:
* c. 40–10BCE [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] – Songs for a Sage (4Q510-511)
* c. 200 [[Mishnah]] – not mentioned
* c. 500 [[Gemara]] of the [[Talmud]]
* c. 800 [[The Alphabet of Ben-Sira]]
* c. 900 [[Midrash Abkir]]
* c. 1260 [[Treatise on the Left Emanation]], Spain
* c. 1280 [[Zohar]], Spain.

===Dead Sea Scrolls===
The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] contain one indisputable reference to Lilith in ''Songs of the Sage'' (4Q510–511)&lt;ref&gt;Michael T. Davis, Brent A. Strawn ''Qumran studies: new approaches, new questions'' 2007 p47: "two manuscripts that date to the Herodian period, with 4Q510 slightly earlier"&lt;/ref&gt; fragment 1:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And I, the Instructor, proclaim His glorious splendour so as to frighten and to te[rrify] all the spirits of the destroying angels, spirits of the [[Legitimacy (family law)|bastard]]s, demons, Lilith, howlers, and [desert dwellers] ... and those which fall upon men without warning to lead them astray from a spirit of understanding and to make their heart and their ... desolate during the present dominion of wickedness and predetermined time of humiliations for the sons of lig[ht], by the guilt of the ages of [those] smitten by iniquity – not for eternal destruction, [bu]t for an era of humiliation for transgression.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Chilton, Darrell Bock, Daniel M. Gurtner ''A Comparative Handbook to the Gospel of Mark'' p84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Great Isaiah Scroll.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Photographic reproduction of the [[Great Isaiah Scroll]], which contains a reference to plural ''liliyyot'']]

As with the Massoretic Text of Isaiah 34:14, and therefore unlike the plural ''liliyyot'' (or ''liliyyoth'') in the [[Isaiah scroll]] 34:14, ''lilit'' in 4Q510 is singular, this liturgical text both cautions against the presence of supernatural malevolence and assumes familiarity with Lilith; distinct from the biblical text, however, this passage does not function under any socio-political agenda, but instead serves in the same capacity as An Exorcism (4Q560) and Songs to Disperse Demons (11Q11).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The text is thus, to a community "deeply involved in the realm of demonology",&lt;ref&gt;''Revue de Qumrân'' 1991 p133&lt;/ref&gt; an exorcism hymn.

Joseph M. Baumgarten (1991) identified the unnamed woman of ''The Seductress'' (4Q184) as related to female demon.&lt;ref&gt;Baumgarten, J. M. "On the Nature of the Seductress in 4Q184", ''Revue de Qumran'' 15 (1991–2), 133–143; "The seductress of Qumran", ''Bible Review'' 17 no 5 (2001), 21–23; 42&lt;/ref&gt; However, John J. Collins&lt;ref&gt;Collins, ''Jewish wisdom in the Hellenistic age''&lt;/ref&gt; regards this identification as "intriguing" but that it is "safe to say" that (4Q184) is based on the strange woman of Proverbs 2, 5, 7, 9:
{{poemquote|Her house sinks down to death,
And her course leads to the shades.
All who go to her cannot return
And find again the paths of life.|Proverbs 2:18–19}}

{{poemquote|Her gates are gates of death, and from the entrance of the house
She sets out towards Sheol.
None of those who enter there will ever return,
And all who possess her will descend to the Pit.|4Q184}}

===Early Rabbinic literature===
Lilith does not occur in the [[Mishnah]]. There are five references to Lilith in the Babylonian Talmud in [[Gemara]] on three separate Tractates of the Mishnah:
* "Rab Judah citing [[Samuel]] ruled: If an abortion had the likeness of Lilith its [[mother]] is unclean by reason of the [[birth]], for it is a child but it has wings." (Babylonian Talmud on Tractate Nidda 24b)&lt;ref&gt;Tractate Niddah in the Mishnah is the only tractate from the Order of Tohorot which has Talmud on it. The Jerusalem Talmud is incomplete here, but the Babylonian Talmud on Tractate Niddah (2a–76b) is complete.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[Expounding upon the curses of womanhood] In a [[Baraitha]] it was taught: She grows long hair like Lilith, sits when making water like a beast, and serves as a bolster for her husband." (Babylonian Talmud on Tractate Eruvin 100b)
* "For gira he should take an arrow of Lilith and place it point upwards and pour water on it and drink it. Alternatively he can take water of which a dog has drunk at night, but he must take care that it has not been exposed." (Babylonian Talmud, tractate Gittin 69b). In this particular case, the "arrow of Lilith" is most probably a scrap of [[meteorite]] or a [[fulgurite]], colloquially known as "petrified lightning" and treated as antipyretic medicine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*"Rabbah said: I saw how Hormin the son of Lilith was running on the parapet of the wall of Mahuza, and a rider, galloping below on horseback could not overtake him. Once they saddled for him two mules which stood on two bridges of the Rognag; and he jumped from one to the other, backward and forward,2 holding in his hands two cups of wine, pouring alternately from one to the other, and not a drop fell to the ground." (Babylonian Talmud, tractate Bava Bathra 73a-b). Hormin who is mentioned here as the son of Lilith is most probably a result of a scribal error of the word "Hormiz" attested in some of the Talmudic manuscripts. The word itself in turn seems to a distortion of [[Ahura Mazda|Ormuzd]], the [[Avesta|Zendavestan]] deity of light and goodness. If so, it is somewhat ironic that Ormuzd becomes here the son of a nocturnal demon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*"R. Hanina said: One may not sleep in a house alone [in a lonely house], and whoever sleeps in a house alone is seized by Lilith." (Babylonian Talmud on Tractate Shabbath 151b)

The above statement by Hanina may be related to the belief that nocturnal emissions engendered the birth of demons:
* "R. Jeremiah b. Eleazar further stated: In all those years [130 years after his expulsion from the Garden of Eden] during which Adam was under the ban he begot [[ghost]]s and male demons and female demons [or night demons], for it is said in Scripture: And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years and begot a son in own likeness, after his own image, from which it follows that until that time he did not beget after his own image ... When he saw that through him death was ordained as punishment he spent a hundred and thirty years in [[fasting]], severed connection with his wife for a hundred and thirty years, and wore clothes of [[ficus|fig]] on his body for a hundred and thirty years. – That statement [of R. Jeremiah] was made in reference to the [[semen]] which he emitted accidentally." (Babylonian Talmud on Tractate Eruvin 18b)

The [[Midrash Rabba]]h collection contains two references to Lilith. The first one is present in [[Genesis Rabbah]] 22:7 and 18:4: according to [[Hiyya the Great|Rabbi Hiyya]] God proceeded to create a second Eve for Adam, after Lilith had to return to dust.&lt;ref name=aish-lillith&gt;{{cite web|title=Lillith|url=http://www.aish.com/atr/Lillith.html|website=aish.com|publisher=Aish.com|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, to be exact the said passages do not employ the Heb. word ''lilith'' itself and instead speak of "the first Eve" (Heb. ''Chavvah ha-Rishonah'', analogically to the phrase ''Adam ha-Rishon'', i.e. the first Adam). Although in the medieval Hebrew literature and folklore, especially that reflected on the protective amulets of various kinds, ''Chavvah ha-Rishonah'' was identified with Lilith, one should remain careful in transposing this equation to the Late Antiquity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kosior|first=Wojciech|date=2018|title=A Tale of Two Sisters: The Image of Eve in Early Rabbinic Literature and Its Influence on the Portrayal of Lilith in the Alphabet of Ben Sira|url=https://www.academia.edu/36771379|journal=Nashim: A Journal of Jewish Women's Studies &amp; Gender Issues|volume=|issue=32|pages=112–130|doi=10.2979/nashim.32.1.10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second mention of Lilith, this time explicit, is present in [[Numbers Rabbah]] 16:25. The midrash develops the story of Moses' plea after  God expresses anger at the bad report of the spies. Moses responds to a threat by God that He will destroy the Israelite people. Moses pleads before God, that God should not be like Lilith who kills her own children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Moses said:&lt;blockquote&gt;[God,] do not do it [i.e. destroy the Israelite people], that the nations of the world may not regard you as a cruel Being and say: ' The Generation of the Flood came and He destroyed them, the Generation of the Separation came and He destroyed them, the Sodomites and the Egyptians came and He destroyed them, and these also, whom he called My son, My firstborn (Ex. IV, 22), He is now destroying! As that Lilith who, when she finds nothing else, turns upon her own children, so Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land...

An individual Lilith, along with [[Bagdana (Judaism)|Bagdana]] "king of the lilits", is one of the demons to feature prominently in protective spells in the eighty surviving Jewish occult [[incantation bowl]]s from [[Sassanid Empire]] Babylon (4th–6th century CE).&lt;ref&gt;Janet Howe Gaines [[Biblical Archaeology Review]] [http://www.bib-arch.org/e-features/lilith.asp Lilith: Seductress, Heroine or Murderer?] "One bowl now on display at Harvard University's Semitic Museum reads, “Thou Lilith ... Hag and Snatcher, I adjure you by the Strong One of Abraham, by the ..."&lt;/ref&gt; These bowls were buried upside down in houses to trap the demon, and almost every Jewish house in [[Nippur]] was found to have such protective bowls buried.&lt;ref&gt;''Descenders to the chariot: the people behind the Hekhalot literature'', p. 277 James R. Davila – 2001: "that they be used by anyone and everyone. The whole community could become the equals of the sages. Perhaps this is why nearly every house excavated in the Jewish settlement in Nippur had one or more incantation bowl buried in it."&lt;/ref&gt; One bowl contains the following inscription commissioned from a Jewish occultist to protect a woman called Rashnoi and her husband from Lilith:

===Alphabet of Ben Sira===
{{Main|Alphabet of Ben Sira}}
[[File:Lilith (Carl Poellath).jpg|thumb|''Lilith'', illustration by Carl Poellath from 1886 or earlier]]

The [[pseudepigraphic]]al&lt;ref&gt;The attribution to the sage [[Ben Sira]] is considered false, with the true author unknown.&lt;/ref&gt; 8th–10th centuries ''[[Alphabet of Ben Sira]]'' is considered to be the oldest form of the story of Lilith as Adam's first wife. Whether this particular tradition is older is not known. Scholars tend to date the Alphabet between the 8th and 10th centuries CE. The work has been characterized as [[satire|satirical]].

In the text an [[amulet]] is inscribed with the names of three [[angel]]s ([[Senoy]], [[Sansenoy]], and [[Semangelof]]) and placed around the neck of [[newborn]] [[boy]]s in order to protect them from the [[lilin]] until their [[circumcision]].&lt;ref&gt;Alphabet of Ben Sirah, Question #5 (23a–b)&lt;/ref&gt; The amulets used against Lilith that were thought to derive from this tradition are, in fact, dated as being much older.&lt;ref&gt;Humm, Alan. [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~humm/Topics/Lilith/alphabet.html Lilith in the Alphabet of Ben Sira]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of Eve having a predecessor is not exclusive to the Alphabet, and is not a new concept, as it can be found in [[Genesis Rabbah]]. However, the idea that Lilith was the predecessor may be exclusive to the Alphabet.

The idea in the text that [[Adam]] had a wife prior to [[Eve]] may have developed from an interpretation of the [[Book of Genesis]] and its dual creation accounts; while Genesis 2:22 describes God's creation of Eve from Adam's rib, an earlier passage, 1:27, already indicates that a woman had been made: "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them." The Alphabet text places Lilith's creation after God's words in Genesis 2:18 that "it is not good for man to be alone"; in this text God forms Lilith out of the clay from which he made Adam but she and Adam bicker. Lilith claims that since she and Adam were created in the same way they were equal and she refuses to submit to him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;After God created Adam, who was alone, He said, "It is not good for man to be alone." He then created a woman for Adam, from the earth, as He had created Adam himself, and called her Lilith. Adam and Lilith immediately began to fight. She said, "I will not lie below," and he said, "I will not lie beneath you, but only on top. For you are fit only to be in the bottom position, while I am to be the superior one." Lilith responded, "We are equal to each other inasmuch as we were both created from the earth." But they would not listen to one another. When Lilith saw this, she pronounced the Ineffable Name and flew away into the air.

Adam stood in prayer before his Creator: "Sovereign of the universe!" he said, "the woman you gave me has run away." At once, the Holy One, blessed be He, sent these three angels [[Senoy]], [[Sansenoy]], and [[Semangelof]], to bring her back.

Said the Holy One to Adam, "If she agrees to come back, what is made is good. If not, she must permit one hundred of her children to die every day." The angels left God and pursued Lilith, whom they overtook in the midst of the sea, in the mighty waters wherein the Egyptians were destined to drown. They told her God's word, but she did not wish to return. The angels said, "We shall drown you in the sea."

"Leave me!' she said. "I was created only to cause sickness to infants. If the infant is male, I have dominion over him for eight days after his birth, and if female, for twenty days."

When the angels heard Lilith's words, they insisted she go back. But she swore to them by the name of the living and eternal God: "Whenever I see you or your names or your forms in an amulet, I will have no power over that infant." She also agreed to have one hundred of her children die every day. Accordingly, every day one hundred demons perish, and for the same reason, we write the angels' names on the amulets of young children. When Lilith sees their names, she remembers her oath, and the child recovers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The background and purpose of ''The Alphabet of Ben-Sira'' is unclear. It is a collection of stories about heroes of the [[Bible]] and [[Talmud]], it may have been a collection of [[Folklore|folk-tale]]s, a refutation of [[Christianity|Christian]], [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]], or other separatist movements; its content seems so offensive to contemporary Jews that it was even suggested that it could be an anti-Jewish [[satire]],&lt;ref&gt;Segal, Eliezer. [http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/Shokel/950206_Lilith.html Looking for Lilith]&lt;/ref&gt; although, in any case, the text was accepted by the Jewish mystics of medieval Germany. In turn, other scholars argue that the target of the ''Alphabet's'' satire is very difficult to establish exactly because of the variety of the figures and values ridiculed therein: criticism is actually directed against Adam, who turns out to be weak and ineffective in his relations with his wife. Apparently, the first man is not the only male figure who is mocked: even God cannot subjugate Lilith and needs to ask his messengers, who only manage to go as far as negotiating the conditions of the agreement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Filippino Lippi- Adam.JPG|upright=1.3|thumb|right|[[Adam]] clutches a child in the presence of the child-snatcher Lilith]]

''The Alphabet of Ben-Sira'' is the earliest surviving source of the story, and the conception that Lilith was Adam's first wife became only widely known with the 17th century ''[[Lexicon Talmudicum]]'' of German scholar [[Johannes Buxtorf]].

In this folk tradition that arose in the early Middle Ages Lilith, a dominant female demon, became identified with [[Asmodeus]], King of Demons, as his queen.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz p.7&lt;/ref&gt; Asmodeus was already well known by this time because of the legends about him in the Talmud. Thus, the merging of Lilith and Asmodeus was inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz p 8&lt;/ref&gt; The second myth of Lilith grew to include legends about another world and by some accounts this other world existed side by side with this one, ''Yenne Velt'' is Yiddish for this described "Other World". In this case Asmodeus and Lilith were believed to procreate demonic offspring endlessly and spread chaos at every turn.&lt;ref name="Schwartz p.8"&gt;Schwartz p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Many disasters were blamed on both of them, causing wine to turn into vinegar, men to be impotent, women unable to give birth, and it was Lilith who was blamed for the loss of infant life. The presence of Lilith and her cohorts were considered very real at this time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Two primary characteristics are seen in these legends about Lilith: Lilith as the incarnation of lust, causing men to be led astray, and Lilith as a child-killing witch, who strangles helpless neonates. These two aspects of the Lilith legend seemed to have evolved separately; there is hardly a tale where she encompasses both roles.&lt;ref name="Schwartz p.8"/&gt; But the aspect of the witch-like role that Lilith plays broadens her archetype of the destructive side of witchcraft. Such stories are commonly found among Jewish folklore.&lt;ref name="Schwartz p.8"/&gt;

==== The influence of the rabbinic traditions ====
Although the image of Lilith of the ''Alphabet of Ben Sira'' is unprecedented, some elements in her portrayal can be traced back to the talmudic and midrashic traditions that arose around [[Eve]]:

# First and foremost, the very introduction of Lilith to the creation story rests on the rabbinic myth, prompted by the two separate creation accounts in Gen. 1:1 – 2:25, that there were two original women. A way of resolving the apparent discrepancy  between these two accounts was to assume that there must have been some other first woman, apart from the one later identified with Eve. The Rabbis, noting Adam’s exclamation, “this time (''zot hapa‘am'') [this is] bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh” (Gen. 2:23),  took it as an intimation that there must already have been a “first time.” According to Genesis rabah 18:4, Adam was disgusted upon seeing the first woman full of “discharge and blood,” and God had to provide him with another one. The subsequent creation is performed with adequate precautions: Adam is made to sleep, so as not to witness the process itself ( Sanhedrin 39a), and Eve is adorned with fine jewelry (Genesis rabah 18:1) and brought to Adam by the angels Gabriel and Michael (ibid. 18:3). However, nowhere do the rabbis specify what happened to the first woman, leaving the matter open for further speculation. This is the gap into which the later tradition of Lilith could fit.
# Second, this new woman is still met with harsh rabbinic allegations. Again playing on the Heb. phrase ''zot hapa‘am'', Adam, according to the same midrash, declares: “it is she [''zot''] who is destined to strike the bell [''zog''] and to speak [in strife] against me, as you read, ‘a golden bell [''pa‘amon''] and a pomegranate’ [Ex. 28:34]  … it is she who will trouble me [''mefa‘amtani''] all night” (Genesis Rabbah 18:4). The first woman also becomes the object of accusations ascribed to Rabbi Joshua of Siknin, according to whom Eve, despite the divine efforts, turned out to be “swelled-headed, coquette, eavesdropper, gossip, prone to jealousy, light-fingered and gadabout” (ibid. 18:2).  A similar set of charges appears in Genesis Rabbah 17:8, according to which Eve’s creation from Adam’s rib rather than from the earth makes her inferior to Adam and never satisfied with anything.
# Third, and despite the terseness of the biblical text in this regard, the erotic iniquities attributed to Eve constitute a separate category of her shortcomings. Told in Gen. 3:16 that “your desire  shall be for your husband,” she is accused by the Rabbis of having an overdeveloped sexual drive (Genesis rabah 20:7) and constantly enticing Adam (ibid. 23:5). However, in terms of textual popularity and dissemination, the motif of Eve copulating with the primeval serpent takes priority over her other sexual transgressions. Despite the rather unsettling picturesqueness of this account, it is conveyed in numerous places: Genesis rabah 18:6, and BT Sotah 9b, Shabat 145b–146a and 196a, Yevamot 103b and ‘Avodah zarah 22b.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Kabbalah===
{{Kabbalah}}
{{main|Lilith (Lurianic Kabbalah)}}
[[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic mysticism]] attempted to establish a more exact relationship between Lilith and the Deity. With her major characteristics having been well-developed by the end of the Talmudic period, after six centuries had elapsed between the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] [[incantation]] texts that mention Lilith and the early Spanish Kabbalistic writings in the 13th century, she reappears, and her life history becomes known in greater mythological detail.&lt;ref&gt;Patai pp. 229–230&lt;/ref&gt;

Her creation is described in many alternative versions. One mentions her creation as being before Adam's, on the fifth day, because the "living creatures" with whose swarms God filled the waters included none other than Lilith. A similar version, related to the earlier Talmudic passages, recounts how Lilith was fashioned with the same substance as Adam was, shortly before. A third alternative version states that God originally created Adam and Lilith in a manner that the female creature was contained in the male. Lilith's soul was lodged in the depths of the Great Abyss. When God called her, she joined Adam. After Adam's body was created a thousand [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s from the Left (evil) side attempted to attach themselves to him. However, God drove them off. Adam was left lying as a body without a soul. Then a cloud descended and God commanded the [[earth]] to produce a living soul. This God [[breath]]ed into Adam, who began to spring to life and his female was attached to his side. God separated the female from Adam's side. The female side was Lilith, whereupon she flew to the Cities of the Sea and attacks [[humankind]]. Yet another version claims that Lilith emerged as a divine entity that was born spontaneously, either out of the Great Supernal Abyss or out of the power of an aspect of God (the [[Gevurah|Gevurah of Din]]). This aspect of God, one of his ten attributes (Sefirot), at its lowest manifestation has an affinity with the realm of evil and it is out of this that Lilith merged with [[Samael]].&lt;ref&gt;Patai p.230&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative story links Lilith with the creation of luminaries. The "first light", which is the light of Mercy (one of the [[Sefirot]]), appeared on the first day of creation when God said "Let there be light". This light became hidden and the Holiness became surrounded by a husk of evil. "A husk (klippa) was created around the [[Human brain|brain]]" and this husk spread and brought out another husk, which was Lilith.&lt;ref&gt;Patai p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

====Midrash ABKIR====
The first medieval source to depict Adam and Lilith in full was the [[Midrash Abkir|Midrash A.B.K.I.R.]] (c. 10th century), which was followed by the Zohar and Kabbalistic writings. Adam is said to be perfect until he recognizes either his sin or Cain's fratricide that is the cause of bringing death into the world. He then separates from holy Eve, sleeps alone, and fasts for 130 years. During this time Lilith, also known as '''Pizna''', desired his beauty and came to him against his will.

===Treatise on the Left Emanation===
{{Main|Treatise on the Left Emanation}}
The mystical writing of two brothers Jacob and Isaac Hacohen, which predates the [[Zohar]] by a few decades, states that [[Samael]] and Lilith are in the shape of an [[androgynous]] being, double-faced, born out of the emanation of the [[Throne of Glory]] and corresponding in the spiritual realm to Adam and Eve, who were likewise born as a [[hermaphrodite]]. The two twin androgynous couples resembled each other and both "were like the image of Above"; that is, that they are reproduced in a visible form of an androgynous deity.

&lt;blockquote&gt;19. In answer to your question concerning Lilith, I shall explain to you the essence of the matter. Concerning this point there is a received tradition from the ancient Sages who made use of the Secret Knowledge of the Lesser Palaces, which is the manipulation of demons and a ladder by which one ascends to the prophetic levels. In this tradition it is made clear that Samael and Lilith were born as one, similar to the form of Adam and Eve who were also born as one, reflecting what is above. This is the account of Lilith which was received by the Sages in the Secret Knowledge of the Palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Patai p.231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another version{{Clarify|date=November 2010}} that was also current among Kabbalistic circles in the [[Middle Ages]] establishes Lilith as the first of Samael's four wives: Lilith, [[Naamah (demon)|Naamah]], [[Eisheth]], and [[Agrat bat Mahlat]]. Each of them are mothers of demons and have their own hosts and unclean spirits in no number.&lt;ref&gt;Patai p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage of [[archangel]] [[Samael]] and Lilith was arranged by "Blind Dragon", who is the counterpart of "the dragon that is in the sea". Blind Dragon acts as an intermediary between Lilith and Samael:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Blind Dragon rides Lilith the Sinful – may she be extirpated quickly in our days, Amen! – And this Blind Dragon brings about the union between Samael and Lilith. And just as the Dragon that is in the sea (Isa. 27:1) has no eyes, likewise Blind Dragon that is above, in the likeness of a spiritual form, is without eyes, that is to say, without colors. ... (Patai 81:458) Samael is called the Slant Serpent, and Lilith is called the Tortuous Serpent.&lt;ref&gt;Humm, Alan. [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~humm/Topics/Lilith/lilsam.html Lilith, Samael, &amp; Blind Dragon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The marriage of Samael and Lilith is known as the "Angel Satan" or the "Other God", but it was not allowed to last. To prevent Lilith and Samael's demonic children ''Lilin'' from filling the world, God castrated Samael. In many 17th century Kabbalistic books, this mythologem is based on the identification of "[[Leviathan]] the Slant Serpent and Leviathan the Torturous Serpent" and a reinterpretation of an old Talmudic myth where God castrated the male Leviathan and slew the female Leviathan in order to prevent them from mating and thereby destroying the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Patai p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; After Samael became castrated and Lilith was unable to fornicate with him, she left him to couple with men who experience nocturnal emissions. A 15th or 16th century Kabbalah text states that God has "cooled" the female Leviathan, meaning that he has made Lilith infertile and she is a mere fornication.

The ''[[Treatise on the Left Emanation]]'' says that there are two Liliths, the lesser being married to the great demon [[Asmodai|Asmodeus]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;In answer to your question concerning Lilith, I shall explain to you the essence of the matter. Concerning this point there is a received tradition from the ancient Sages who made use of the Secret Knowledge of the Lesser Palaces, which is the manipulation of demons and a ladder by which one ascends to the prophetic levels. In this tradition, it is made clear that Samael and Lilith were born as one, similar to the form of Adam and Eve who were also born as one, reflecting what is above. This is the account of Lilith which was received by the Sages in the Secret Knowledge of the Palaces. The Matron Lilith is the mate of Samael. Both of them were born at the same hour in the image of Adam and Eve, intertwined in each other. Asmodeus the great king of the demons has as a mate the Lesser (younger) Lilith, daughter of the king whose name is Qafsefoni. The name of his mate is Mehetabel daughter of Matred, and their daughter is Lilith.&lt;ref&gt;R. Isaac b. Jacob Ha-Kohen. [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~humm/Topics/Lilith/jacob_ha_kohen.html Lilith in Jewish Mysticism: Treatise on the Left Emanation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another passage charges Lilith as being a tempting serpent of [[Eve]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
And the Serpent, the Woman of Harlotry, incited and seduced Eve through the husks of Light which in itself is holiness. And the Serpent seduced Holy Eve, and enough said for him who understands. And all this ruination came about because Adam the first man coupled with Eve while she was in her menstrual impurity – this is the filth and the impure seed of the Serpent who mounted Eve before Adam mounted her. Behold, here it is before you: because of the sins of Adam the first man all the things mentioned came into being. For Evil Lilith, when she saw the greatness of his corruption, became strong in her husks, and came to Adam against his will, and became hot from him and bore him many demons and spirits and Lilin. (Patai81:455f)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Zohar===
References to Lilith in the [[Zohar]] include the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;She wanders about at night, vexing the sons of men and causing them to defile themselves (19b)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This passage may be related to the mention of Lilith in Talmud Shabbath 151b (see above), and also to Talmud Eruvin 18b where nocturnal emissions are connected with the begettal of demons.

Raphael Patai states that older sources state clearly that after Lilith's Red Sea sojourn (mentioned also in [[Louis Ginzberg]]'s ''Legends of the Jews''), she returned to Adam and begat children from him. In the Zohar, however, Lilith is said to have succeeded in begetting offspring from Adam during their short-lived sexual experience. Lilith leaves Adam in Eden, as she is not a suitable helpmate for him. She returns, later, to force herself upon him. However, before doing so she attaches herself to Cain and bears him numerous spirits and demons.&lt;ref name="Patai p232"/&gt;

According to [[Gershom Scholem]], the author of the Zohar, [[Rabbi Moses de Leon]], was aware of the folk tradition of Lilith. He was also aware of another story, possibly older, that may be conflicting.&lt;ref&gt;Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Zohar, two female spirits, Lilith and [[Naamah (demon)|Naamah]] — found Adam, desired his beauty which was like that of the sun disk, and lay with him. The issue of these unions were demons and spirits called "the plagues of humankind".&lt;ref name="Patai p232"&gt;Patai p232 "Or according to the Zohar, two female spirits, Lilith and Naamah — found him, desired his beauty which was like that of the sun disk, and lay with him. The issue of these unions were demons and spirits"&lt;/ref&gt; The added explanation was that it was through Adam's own sin that Lilith overcame him against his will.

===17th century Hebrew magical amulets===
[[File:Medieval amulet to protect mother and child. Wellcome M0008070.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Medieval Hebrew amulet intended to protect a mother and her child from Lilith]]

A copy of [[Jean de Pauly]]'s translation of the Zohar in the [[Ritman Library]] contains an inserted late 17th Century printed Hebrew sheet for use in magical amulets where the prophet [[Elijah]] confronts Lilith.&lt;ref&gt;"Printed sheet, late 17th century or early 18th century, 185x130 mm.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sheet contains two texts within borders, which are amulets, one for a male ('lazakhar'), the other one for a female ('lanekevah'). The invocations mention Adam, Eve and Lilith, 'Chavah Rishonah' (the first Eve, who is identical with Lilith), also devils or angels: Sanoy, Sansinoy, Smangeluf, Shmari'el (the guardian) and Hasdi'el (the merciful). A few lines in Yiddish are followed by the dialogue between the prophet Elijah and Lilith when he met her with her host of demons to kill the mother and take her new-born child ('to drink her blood, suck her bones and eat her flesh'). She tells Elijah that she will lose her power if someone uses her secret names, which she reveals at the end: ''lilith, abitu, abizu, hakash, avers hikpodu, ayalu, matrota ...''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ritmanlibrary.nl/c/p/exh/kabb/kab_pheb_25.html |title=Lilith Amulet-J.R.

In other amulets, probably informed by ''[[The Alphabet of Ben-Sira]]'', she is Adam's first wife. ([[Yalqut Reubeni]], [[Zohar]] 1:34b, 3:19&lt;ref&gt;Humm, Alan. [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~humm/Topics/Lilith/origin.html Kabbalah: Lilith's origins]&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Tree of Life (Kabbalah)===
Lilith is listed as one of the [[Qliphoth]], corresponding to the [[Sephirah]] [[Malkuth]] in the Kabbalistic [[Tree of Life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]. The demon Lilith, the evil woman, is described as a beautiful woman, who transforms into a blue, butterfly-like demon, and it is associated with the power of seduction.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

The Qliphah is the unbalanced power of a Sephirah. Malkuth is the lowest Sephirah, the realm of the earth, into which all the divine energy flows, and in which the divine plan is worked out. However, its unbalanced form is as Lilith, the seductress. The material world, and all of its pleasures, is the ultimate seductress, and can lead to materialism unbalanced by the spirituality of the higher spheres. This ultimately leads to a descent into animal consciousness. The balance must therefore be found between Malkuth and [[Kether]], to find order and harmony.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

==Greco-Roman mythology==
{{Main|Lamia (mythology)}}
[[File:Lamia and the Soldier.jpg|upright=1.1|right|thumb|''[[Lamia]]'' (first version) by [[John William Waterhouse]], 1905]]

In the Latin [[Vulgate]] Book of Isaiah 34:14, Lilith is translated ''lamia''.

According to [[Augustine Calmet]], Lilith has connections with early views on vampire and sorcery:

{{quote|Some learned men have thought they discovered some vestiges of vampirism in the remotest antiquity; but all that they say of it does not come near what is related of the vampires. The lamiæ, the strigæ, the sorcerers whom they accused of sucking the blood of living persons, and of thus causing their death, the magicians who were said to cause the death of new-born children by charms and malignant spells, are nothing less than what we understand by the name of vampires; even were it to be owned that these lamiæ and strigæ have really existed, which we do not believe can ever be well proved.

I own that these terms [''lamiæ'' and ''strigæ''] are found in the versions of Holy Scripture. For instance, Isaiah, describing the condition to which Babylon was to be reduced after her ruin, says that she shall become the abode of satyrs, lamiæ, and strigæ (in Hebrew, lilith). This last term, according to the Hebrews, signifies the same thing, as the Greeks express by strix and lamiæ, which are sorceresses or magicians, who seek to put to death new-born children. Whence it comes that the Jews are accustomed to write in the four corners of the chamber of a woman just delivered, "Adam, Eve, be gone from hence lilith." ... The ancient Greeks knew these dangerous sorceresses by the name of lamiæ, and they believed that they devoured children, or sucked away all their blood till they died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calmet|first1=Augustine|title=Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants: of Hungary, Moravia, et al. The Complete Volumes I &amp; II. 2016|date=1751|isbn=978-1-5331-4568-0|page=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Siegmund Hurwitz the Talmudic Lilith is connected with the Greek [[Lamia (mythology)|Lamia]], who, according to Hurwitz, likewise governed a class of child stealing lamia-demons. Lamia bore the title "child killer" and was feared for her malevolence, like Lilith. She has different conflicting origins and is described as having a human upper body from the waist up and a serpentine body from the waist down.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwitz p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; One source states simply that she is a daughter of the goddess [[Hecate]]. Another, that Lamia was subsequently cursed by the goddess Hera to have stillborn children because of her association with Zeus; alternatively, Hera slew all of Lamia's children (except Scylla) in anger that Lamia slept with her husband, Zeus. The grief caused Lamia to turn into a monster that took revenge on mothers by stealing their children and devouring them.&lt;ref name="Hurwitz p.43"&gt;Hurwitz p.43&lt;/ref&gt; Lamia had a vicious sexual appetite that matched her cannibalistic appetite for children. She was notorious for being a vampiric spirit and loved sucking men's blood.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwitz p.78&lt;/ref&gt; Her gift was the "mark of a Sibyl", a gift of second sight. Zeus was said to have given her the gift of sight. However, she was "cursed" to never be able to shut her eyes so that she would forever obsess over her dead children. Taking pity on Lamia, [[Zeus]] gave her the ability to remove and replace her eyes from their sockets.&lt;ref name="Hurwitz p.43"/&gt;

The [[Empusa]]e were a class of supernatural demons that Lamia was said to have birthed. Hecate would often send them against travelers. They consumed or scared to death any of the people where they inhabited. They bear many similarities to lilim. It has been suggested that later medieval lore of the [[succubus|succubi]] or lilim is derived from this myth.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

==Arabic mythology==
Lilith is not found in the [[Quran]] or [[Hadith]]. The Sufi occult writer [[Ahmad al-Buni]] (d. 1225), in his ''Sun of the Great Knowledge'' ({{lang-ar|شمس المعارف الكبرى}}), mentions a demon called "the mother of children", a term also used "in one place"&lt;ref&gt;"an eine Stelle" Hurwitz S. ''Die erste Eva: Eine historische und psychologische Studie'' 2004 Page 160 "8) Lilith in der arabischen Literatur: Die Karina Auch in der arabischen Literatur hat der Lilith-Mythos seinen Niederschlag gefunden."&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''[[Zohar]]'' and is therefore probably derived from Jewish mythology.

[[File:Richard Westall - Faust and Lilith.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''Faust and Lilith'' by [[Richard Westall]] (1831)]]
Lilith's earliest appearance in [[Romantic literature|the literature of the Romantic period]] (1789–1832) was in [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s 1808 work ''[[Faust: The First Part of the Tragedy]]''.

{{poemquote|'''[[Faust]]:'''
    Who's that there?
'''[[Mephistopheles]]:'''
    Take a good look.
    ''Lilith''.
'''Faust:'''
    Lilith? Who is that?
'''Mephistopheles:'''
    Adam's wife, his first. Beware of her.
    Her beauty's one boast is her dangerous hair.
    When Lilith winds it tight around young men
    She doesn't soon let go of them again.|1992 Greenberg translation, lines 4206–4211}}

After Mephistopheles offers this warning to Faust, he then, quite ironically, encourages Faust to dance with "the Pretty Witch". Lilith and Faust engage in a short dialogue, where Lilith recounts the days spent in Eden.

{{poemquote|'''Faust:''' [dancing with the young witch]
    A lovely dream I dreamt one day
    I saw a green-leaved apple tree,
    Two apples swayed upon a stem,
    So tempting! I climbed up for them.
'''The Pretty Witch:'''
    Ever since the days of Eden
    Apples have been man's desire.
    How overjoyed I am to think, sir,
    Apples grow, too, in my garden.|1992 Greenberg translation, lines 4216 – 4223}}

===In English literature===
[[File:Lady-Lilith.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''[[Lady Lilith]]'' by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] (1866–1868, 1872–1873)]]
The [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], which developed around 1848,&lt;ref name=feminism/&gt; were greatly influenced by Goethe's work on the theme of Lilith. In 1863, [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] of the Brotherhood began painting what would later be his first rendition of ''[[Lady Lilith]]'', a painting he expected to be his "best picture hitherto".&lt;ref name=feminism/&gt; [[Symbol]]s appearing in the painting allude to the "femme fatale" reputation of the Romantic Lilith: [[poppy|poppies]] (death and cold) and white [[rose]]s (sterile passion). Accompanying his ''Lady Lilith'' painting from 1866, Rossetti wrote a [[sonnet]] entitled ''Lilith'', which was first published in Swinburne's pamphlet-review (1868), ''Notes on the Royal Academy Exhibition''.

{{poemquote|Of Adam's first wife, Lilith, it is told
(The witch he loved before the gift of Eve,)
That, ere the snake's, her sweet tongue could deceive,
And her enchanted hair was the first gold.
And still she sits, young while the earth is old,
And, subtly of herself contemplative,
Draws men to watch the bright web she can weave,
Till heart and body and life are in its hold.
The rose and poppy are her flower; for where
Is he not found, O Lilith, whom shed scent
And soft-shed kisses and soft sleep shall snare?
Lo! As that youth's eyes burned at thine, so went
Thy spell through him, and left his straight neck bent
And round his heart one strangling golden hair.|''Collected Works'', 216}}

The poem and the picture appeared together alongside Rossetti's painting ''Sibylla Palmifera'' and the sonnet ''Soul's Beauty''. In 1881, the ''Lilith'' sonnet was renamed "''Body's Beauty''" in order to contrast it and ''Soul's Beauty''. The two were placed sequentially in ''The House of Life'' collection (sonnets number 77 and 78).&lt;ref name=feminism/&gt;

Rossetti wrote in 1870:
{{quote|Lady [Lilith] ... represents a Modern Lilith combing out her abundant golden hair and gazing on herself in the glass with that self-absorption by whose strange fascination such natures draw others within their own circle.|Rossetti, W. M. ii.850, D. G. Rossetti's emphasis&lt;ref name=feminism/&gt;}}

This is in accordance with Jewish folk tradition, which associates Lilith both with long hair (a symbol of dangerous feminine seductive power in [[Jewish]] culture), and with possessing women by entering them through mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lilith's Cave: Jewish tales of the supernatural |author= [[Howard Schwartz (writer and editor)|Howard Schwartz]] |location=San Francisco |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |year=1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] poet [[Robert Browning]] re-envisioned Lilith in his poem "Adam, Lilith, and Eve". First published in 1883, the poem uses the traditional myths surrounding the triad of Adam, Eve, and Lilith. Browning depicts Lilith and Eve as being friendly and complicitous with each other, as they sit together on either side of Adam. Under the threat of death, Eve admits that she never loved Adam, while Lilith confesses that she always loved him:

{{poemquote|As the worst of the venom left my lips,
I thought, 'If, despite this lie, he strips
The mask from my soul with a kiss — I crawl
His slave, — soul, body, and all!|Browning 1098}}

Browning focused on Lilith's emotional attributes, rather than that of her ancient demon predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;Seidel, Kathryn Lee. [http://weberstudies.weber.edu/archive/archive%20A%20%20Vol.%201-10.3/vol.%2010.2/10.2Seidel.htm The Lilith Figure in Toni Morrison's ''Sula'' and Alice Walker's ''The Color Purple'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish author [[George MacDonald]] also wrote a fantasy novel entitled ''[[Lilith (novel)|Lilith]]'', first published in 1895. MacDonald employed the character of Lilith in service to a spiritual drama about sin and redemption, in which Lilith finds a hard-won salvation. Many of the traditional characteristics of Lilith mythology are present in the author's depiction: Long dark hair, pale skin, a hatred and fear of children and babies, and an obsession with gazing at herself in a mirror. MacDonald's Lilith also has vampiric qualities: she bites people and sucks their blood for sustenance.

Australian poet and scholar [[Christopher John Brennan]] (1870–1932), included a section titled "Lilith" in his major work "Poems: 1913" (Sydney : G. B. Philip and Son, 1914). The "Lilith" section contains thirteen poems exploring the Lilith myth and is central to the meaning of the collection as a whole.

[[C. L. Moore]]'s 1940 story ''Fruit of Knowledge'' is written from Lilith's point of view. It is a re-telling of the [[Fall of Man]] as a [[love triangle]] between Lilith, Adam and Eve – with Eve's eating the forbidden fruit being in this version the result of misguided manipulations by the jealous Lilith, who had hoped to get her rival discredited and destroyed by God and thus regain Adam's love.

British poet [[John Siddique]]'s 2011 collection ''Full Blood'' has a suite of 11 poems called ''The Tree of Life'', which features Lilith as the divine feminine aspect of God. A number of the poems feature Lilith directly, including the piece ''Unwritten'' which deals with the spiritual problem of the feminine being removed by the scribes from ''The Bible.''

Lilith is also mentioned in ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', by [[C.S.Lewis]]. The character [[Mr. and Mrs. Beaver|Mr. Beaver]] ascribes the ancestry of the main antagonist, Jadis the [[White Witch]], to Lilith.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lion, the Witch, and Wardrobe'', Collier Books (paperback, Macmillan subsidiary), 1970, pg. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Armenian literature===
The poem "Lilith" by the renowned 20th century Armenian writer Avetic Isahakyan is based on the Jewish legend. Isahakyan wrote "Lilith" in 1921 in Venice. His heroine was a creature who emerged from fire. Adam fell in love with Lilith, but Lilith was very indifferent, sympathy being her only feeling for the latter because Adam was a creature made of soil, not fire.

== As the origin of the term "lullaby"== 
It is been argued that the term "lullaby" derives from "Lilith-Abi" ([[Hebrew]] for "Lilith, begone").&lt;ref&gt;Faust,  translated into English prose, by A. Hayward. Second edition, E. Moxon, 1834, page 285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hines, Kathleen. "The Art of the Musical Zz: Cultural Implications of Lullabies around the World." Miwah Li, John Moeller, and Charles Smith Wofford College (2013): 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pathak, Vrushali, and Shefali Mishra. "Psychological effect of lullabies in child development." Indian Journal of Positive Psychology 8.4 (2017): 677-680.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levin, S. "The evil eye and the afflictions of children." South African Medical Journal 32.6 (1958).&lt;/ref&gt; To guard against Lilith, Jewish mothers would hang four amulets on nursery walls with the inscription "Lilith – abei" ["Lilith – begone"].&lt;ref&gt;''The Human Interest Library: Wonder world'', Midland Press, 1921, page 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoy, Emme. "How do shifting depictions of Lilith,'The First Eve', trace the contexts and hegemonic values of their times?." Teaching History 46.3 (2012): 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In modern occultism==
The depiction of Lilith in Romanticism continues to be popular among [[Wicca]]ns and in other modern [[Occult]]ism.&lt;ref name=feminism&gt;{{cite web |url=http://feminism.eserver.org/theory/papers/lilith/ |title=Amy Scerba The Feminism and Women's Studies site: Changing Literary Representations of Lilith and the Evolution of a Mythical Heroine |access-date=2011-12-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221221147/http://feminism.eserver.org/theory/papers/lilith |archive-date=2011-12-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few [[Magick (Aleister Crowley)|magical]] orders dedicated to the undercurrent of Lilith, featuring initiations specifically related to the arcana of the "first mother", exist. Two organizations that use initiations and magic associated with Lilith are the [[Ordo Antichristianus Illuminati]] and the [[Order of Phosphorus]]. Lilith appears as a [[succubus]] in [[Aleister Crowley]]'s ''De Arte Magica.'' Lilith was also one of the middle names of Crowley’s first child, Nuit Ma Ahathoor Hecate Sappho Jezebel Lilith Crowley (1904–1906), and Lilith is sometimes identified with [[Babalon]] in [[Thelema|Thelemic]] writings. Many early occult writers that contributed to modern day [[Wicca]] expressed special reverence for Lilith. [[Charles Leland]] associated [[Aradia (goddess)|Aradia]] with Lilith: [[Aradia (goddess)|Aradia]], says Leland, is [[Herodias]], who was regarded in [[stregheria]] folklore as being associated with [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] as chief of the witches. Leland further notes that Herodias is a name that comes from West Asia, where it denoted an early form of Lilith.&lt;ref&gt;Grimassi, Raven.[http://www.stregheria.com/Marguerite.htm Stregheria: La Vecchia Religione]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leland, Charles.[http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/aradia/ara18.htm Aradia, Gospel of the Witches-aAppendix]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] asserted that there was continuous historical worship of Lilith to present day, and that her name is sometimes given to the [[goddess]] being personified in the coven by the priestess. This idea was further attested by [[Doreen Valiente]], who cited her as a presiding goddess of the Craft: "the personification of erotic dreams, the suppressed desire for delights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitedragon.org.uk/articles/lillith.htm |title=Lilith-The First Eve |publisher=Imbolc |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some contemporary concepts, ''Lilith'' is viewed as the embodiment of [[Goddess movement|the Goddess]], a designation that is thought to be shared with what these faiths believe to be her counterparts: [[Inanna]], [[Ishtar]], [[Asherah]], [[Anath]] and [[Isis]].&lt;ref&gt;Grenn, Deborah J.[http://www.lilithinstitute.com/history.htm History of Lilith Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; According to one view, Lilith was originally a Sumerian, Babylonian, or Hebrew mother goddess of childbirth, children, women, and sexuality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daimon.ch/385630522X_2E.htm |title=Excerpts from Lilith-The first Eve |last=Hurwitz |first=Siegmund }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goddess.com.au/goddesses/Lilith.htm |publisher=goddess.com.au |title=Lilith |access-date=2018-11-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504094448/http://www.goddess.com.au/goddesses/Lilith.htm |archive-date=2018-05-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who later became demonized due to the rise of patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Koltuv&lt;/ref&gt; Other modern views hold that Lilith is a dark moon goddess on par with the Hindu [[Kali]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Buckland&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern [[theistic Satanists]] consider Lilith as a [[goddess]]. She is considered a goddess of independence by those Satanists and is often worshipped by women, but women are not the only people who worship her. Lilith is popular among theistic Satanists because of her association with Satan. Some Satanists believe that she is the wife of Satan and thus think of her as a mother figure. Others base their reverence towards her based on her history as a succubus and praise her as a sex goddess.&lt;ref&gt;http://theisticsatanism.com/rituals/standard/Lilith.html&lt;/ref&gt; A different approach to a Satanic Lilith holds that she was once a fertility and agricultural goddess.&lt;ref&gt;http://religion.lilithezine.com/The_Legend_of_Lilith.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Kabbalah and Western mystery tradition==
The [[western mystery tradition]] associates Lilith with the [[Qliphoth]] of kabbalah. [[Samael Aun Weor]] in The ''Pistis Sophia Unveiled'' writes that homosexuals are the "henchmen of Lilith". Likewise, women who undergo willful abortion, and those who support this practice are "seen in the sphere of Lilith".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Rypqlr2O_sAC&amp;dq=pistis+sophia+unveiled&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=homosexuals&amp;f=false |title=Pistis Sophia Unveiled |first=Samael |last=Aun Weor |page=339 |isbn=9780974591681 |date=June 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dion Fortune]] writes, "The Virgin Mary is reflected in Lilith",&lt;ref name="fortune"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=EucEChcyoq4C&amp;pg=PA126&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;dq=dion+fortune+virgin+mary+lilith#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Psychic Self-Defence |first= Dion |last=Fortune |pages= 126–128 |isbn=9781609254643 |year=1963 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Lilith is the source of "lustful dreams".&lt;ref name="fortune" /&gt;

{{Human Rights in North Korea | expanded = all}}

Publications reporting the factual situation of [[human rights in North Korea|human rights in North Korea (DPRK)]] are the basis upon which policies are shaped and society mobilized. This article includes those fact-finding publications issued by the [[United Nations]], governments, and [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs)/ [[civil society]] entities.&lt;ref name ="Goedde 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yeo 2018 "/&gt;

This article focuses on listing fact-finding [[report|reports]], which distinguish themselves from other publications such as pamphlets, news articles, books, or journal articles, in that they are meant to aggregate information from multiple sources and provide a balanced, overall view of the topic covered for the non-commercial purpose of informing the general public and policy makers. These reports tend to rely more on the credibility of their publishing institutions than on their individual authors. Fact-finding reports are also distinct from policy briefs as the latter ground their analysis and recommendations on the facts laid out in the former. The inclusion is based on the notability (and not the concurrence to any particular view) of the publishing institutions to the inquiry and deliberations on the situation in North Korea.

This list lays out the evolution of the reporting efforts, with a first wave of reports by human rights NGOs just describing the general characteristics of the regime, followed by another wave of civil society and governmental reports with some more details, then prompting the United Nations to also exercise greater scrutiny and pursue its own investigations.&lt;ref name ="Gershman 2013"/&gt; 

The vast majority of reports (except those published by the DPRK itself, also included in this article) point to a very grave situation, with human rights systematically violated by the North Korean government.

Efforts to continue to investigate and document the situation of human rights in the DPRK are on-going, given that there are no indications of substantial improvements in the regime's policies, and despite the continued isolation of the regime that limits outside investigators' access to the country and to its general population.&lt;ref name="Special rapporteur A/72/394 2017"/&gt;

Within the Soviet and American [[Sphere of influence|spheres]] respectively, the North became a [[communist]] authoritarian [[Politics of North Korea|regime]] uninterruptedly led by the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim family]],&lt;ref group="lower-roman" name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 0-415-23749-1 |p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[History of South Korea|South]] became a [[capitalist]] society that until 1987 included short periods of unstable democracy as well as longer periods of [[autocratic]] rule, including over 25 years of right-wing military rule.&lt;ref group="lower-roman" name="Lee Hyun-hee 2005"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Hyun-hee |author-link1= |last2=Park |first2=Sung-soo |author-link2= |last3= Yoon|first3=Nae-hyun |author-link3= |date=2005 |title=New History of Korea (Korean Studies Series, No. 30) |url= |location= |publisher=Jimoondang |page= |author-link= |isbn=978-8988095850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While South Korea had a period of authoritarian military rule, mass mobilizations of its citizens [[June Struggle|forced its end in 1987]]. This led to the modern South Korea being a young, more stable democracy with a prosperous free market economy.&lt;ref group="lower-roman" name="Oxford Dictionary"/&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-roman" name="Lee Hyun-hee 2005"/&gt; Meanwhile, North Korea's [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regime kept a stronger grip on its society, which was never able to mobilize to demand reforms. Its [[Planned economy|planned economy]] stagnated in the 1970s, and after the disintegration of the Soviet Union it spiralled into crisis in the 1990s, leading to a massive [[North Korean famine|famine]]. North Korea remains to this day as one of the most isolated countries in the world, with a struggling economy, within a [[communist]], [[Songun|militaristic]], and totalitarian regime.&lt;ref group="lower-roman" name="Lee Hyun-hee 2005"/&gt;

===Chronology and major themes===

The reporting of human rights in the DPRK follows the progression of the modern [[Human rights movement|movement of human rights]], which from the 1970s civil society and governmental efforts made violations more visible to the general public and in international politics.&lt;ref name="H.)Bertucci1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neier 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Tsutsui Wotipka 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Tsutsui Wotipka 2004"/&gt; 

Given the opacity of the DPRK's regime, especially before the 1990s, little was known about the situation of human rights.&lt;ref name ="AI 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amnesty International 1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="US 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US 1988 report"/&gt; The few reports that were issued at that time made note of the lack of concrete information, mostly only being able to describe the general characteristics of the country's political system.&lt;ref name ="US 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="AI 1985"/&gt; [[Amnesty International]], founded in 1961,&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia British culture - AI 2002"/&gt; began to issue some basic reports on the DPRK in 1977.&lt;ref name ="UPENN AI reports"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amnesty International 1977"/&gt; In 1979 the US's [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] also began to cover the DPRK in its ''[[Country Reports on Human Rights Practices]]''.&lt;ref name ="UPENN US reports"/&gt;

With the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution of the Soviet Union]], and the subsequent [[North Korean famine]] of the 1990s, a higher number of individuals began to [[North Korean defectors|flee the country]], and more first-person accounts began to be collected by human rights organizations.&lt;ref name ="Gershman 2013"/&gt; That was also followed in the early 2000s by greater availability of satellite imagery.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2012"/&gt; South Korea, having itself [[History of South Korea|transitioned]] from a military dictatorship to a democracy in the late 1980s, began to publish reports in 1996 through its governmental think tank [[Korea Institute for National Unification]].&lt;ref name="Geliu 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="KINU white paper 1996"/&gt; In the late 1990s and  2000s several NGOs specialized on North Korea emerged and began to publish their own research: Citizens' Alliance for North Korean Human Rights (1996),&lt;ref name="Yeo 2018 "/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Chubb 2014"/&gt; [[Committee for Human Rights in North Korea]] (2001),&lt;ref name="Cohen 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thiessen 2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fifield 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Gershman 2013"/&gt; Database Center for North Korean Human Rights (2003),&lt;ref name="La Croix"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AP Sep 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT May 2018"/&gt; People for Successful Corean Reunification (2006)&lt;ref name="Washington Post 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JoongAng Daily 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Business Insider 2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="KUDLÁČOVÁ Washington Post 2014"/&gt;. Around the same time some other world-wide human rights organizations such as [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Christian Solidarity Worldwide]] also began to publish reports on the DPRK.

As reports from NGOs and governments began to reveal more details on the human rights situation in the DPRK during the 1990s and 2000s, these concerns were elevated to the United Nations, where various UN bodies and parties also began to express a growing concern on the situation and opacity of the regime.&lt;ref name="E/CN.4/SUB.2/RES/1997/3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ECFR 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A/RES/66/174"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="A/HRC/25/CRP.1"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Gershman 2013"/&gt; The mounting evidence being collected and published by governments and civil society led in 2004 to the establishment of the mandate for the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on the situation of human rights in the DPRK, issuing reports annually.&lt;ref name ="UNCHR 2004/13"/&gt; 

The growing amount of information, and the grave situation it increasingly revealed, led the [[United Nations General Assembly]]&lt;ref name="A/C.3/63/L.26"/&gt; and the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]] (HRC)&lt;ref name="E/CN.4/RES/2004/13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A/HRC/7/L.28"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A/HRC/13/L.13"/&gt; to repeatedly pass resolutions officially expressing their concerns and urging the DPRK's government to change its ways.&lt;ref name="ECFR 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A/RES/66/174"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="A/HRC/25/CRP.1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PSCORE 2014 list resolutions"/&gt;

Ten years later, further joint efforts by the UN Special Rapporteur, governments, and NGOs&lt;ref name="Yeo 2018 "/&gt; led to the establishment of a special one-time investigation unprecedented in depth and breadth&lt;ref name ="Hilpert &amp; Krumbein 2016"/&gt; commissioned by the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council]], with a [[Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|landmark report published in 2014]].&lt;ref name="Sengupta Dec 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sengupta Oct 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ECFR 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cumming-Bruce Feb 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Gershman 2013"/&gt; It was deemed the most authoritative report up to that point.&lt;ref name="Cumming-Bruce 28 March 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sengupta Oct 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cumming-Bruce Sep 19 2014"/&gt; The report unequivocally concluded that the [[Politics of North Korea|DPRK regime]] committed gross and systematic violations of human rights including freedom of thought, expression and religion; freedom from discrimination; freedom of movement and residence; and the right to food, &lt;ref name="Cumming-Bruce Feb 2015"/&gt; as well as [[crimes against humanity]] entailing "extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced disappearance of persons and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation".&lt;ref name="ECFR 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanger Oct 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Economist Feb 2014"/&gt;

The UN's fact-finding process continues to yield periodical reports, which greatly rely on and are underpinned by the also on-going research and publishing conducted by NGOs and governmental agencies.&lt;ref name ="A/HRC/25/CRP.1"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="US 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="UN HRC 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yeo 2018 "/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Hilpert &amp; Krumbein 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Special rapporteur A/72/394 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Tsutsui Wotipka 2004"/&gt; 

Increased awareness of human rights abuses has led to efforts in shaping policy and pressuring the North Korean regime.&lt;ref name ="Goedde 2010"/&gt; However the pursuit for the improvement of human rights in the DPRK has had to contend with the efforts of [[Timeline of the North Korean nuclear program|preventing a nuclear weapons escalation]].&lt;ref name ="Goedde 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Hilpert &amp; Krumbein 2016"/&gt; Further, the isolationist and totalitarian nature of the regime has also meant that information and freedom of movement of its population as well as that of foreigners is still tightly controlled, making extremely challenging to document abuses on the ground,&lt;ref name="Special rapporteur A/72/394 2017"/&gt; including having access to imagery (other than satellite imagery) that could inspire greater action.&lt;ref name ="Hilpert &amp; Krumbein 2016"/&gt;

==United Nations==
[[File:조선민주주의인민공화국 인권조사위원회 보고서- Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the DPRK.png|thumb|Cover of the Korean version of the [[Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|UN's Report of the commission of inquiry on human rights in the DPRK]] ]]

The United Nations has issued four main kinds of reports on the human rights of North Korea. 

The first are a series of documents intended to be recommendations from [[Human Rights#United Nations system|Treaty-based bodies]], which are issued by those bodies to each country that is party to it (in contrast to charter-based bodies, which all UN members are part of). These treaty-based bodies that North Korea has decided to be a party to include the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]], [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]], and [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. The first document of this kind was issued in 1998 (Convention on the Rights of the Child); the second was in 2001 (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights), after a 17-year delay in North Korea submitting the required information to the committee.&lt;ref name="CCPR/CO/72/PRK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PSCORE 2014 list treaties"/&gt;

Prompted by growing evidence provided by human rights NGOs, during the 1990s and 2000s various UN bodies and parties expressed greater concern on the situation of human rights in North Korea and the opacity of the country's government.&lt;ref name="E/CN.4/SUB.2/RES/1997/3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ECFR 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A/RES/66/174"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="A/HRC/25/CRP.1"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Tsutsui Wotipka 2004"/&gt; That led to another series of reports that were started by the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|UN Commission on Human Rights]] (the predecessor of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]]), which established the mandate for the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on the situation of human rights in the DPRK in 2004, issuing reports annually.&lt;ref name="Erlanger 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OHCHR"/&gt; They are issued in detail to the Human Rights Council, and in a more condensed form to the [[General Assembly]].

The United Nations also conducts a [[Universal Periodic Review]] (every 3 or 4 years, in which all UN members are subject to a review on their human rights practices), with the first report on North Korea issued in 2010.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2014b"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="A/HRC/22/57"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A/HRC/13/13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirby November 18, 2014"/&gt;

Finally, the most notable one was the 2014 [[Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the DPRK]], considered a landmark document resulting from a special in-depth, one-time investigation commissioned by the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council]],&lt;ref name="Sengupta Dec 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sengupta Oct 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ECFR 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cumming-Bruce Feb 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yeo 2018 "/&gt; It was deemed the most authoritative report up to that point.&lt;ref name="Cumming-Bruce 28 March 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sengupta Oct 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cumming-Bruce Sep 19 2014"/&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2000 - Cover.png|thumb| Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2000 report cover]]
The United States government, through its [[United States Department of State|Department of State]]'s (DOS) [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] has published annually [[Country Reports on Human Rights Practices]], that beginning in 1979 included North Korea.&lt;ref name ="UPENN US reports"/&gt; Also, two different bodies within the U.S. government have published reports on religious freedom: the Department of State (since 2001),&lt;ref name="USDOS Religious Freedom"/&gt; and [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom|U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom]] (USCRIF; since 2003). Finally, the DOS' [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] also publishes  [[Trafficking in Persons Report]]s (TIP) that include some coverage of North Korea. The TIP reports series began in 2001, following the passing of the [[Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000]], with North Korea beginning to be briefly covered starting in the 2003 report,&lt;ref name ="TIP 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="TIP 2003"/&gt; and more fully covered beginning in 2005.&lt;ref name ="TIP 2005"/&gt;

The Country Reports on Human Rights Practices issued by the DOS noted every year the difficulty of having detailed an up-to-date information, and instead relying on sparse information collected over several years. This was especially the case in the during the 1970s and 80s, and began to change in the 1990s with more witness accounts, while continuing to note a lack of more detailed and more timely information.&lt;ref name="US 1988 report"/&gt; As more reports became available, the DOS and USCRIF reports have frequently cited reports from the United Nations, South Korea's ''Korea Institute for National Unification'' (starting in 1996), nonprofits (especially the ''[[Committee for Human Rights in North Korea]]'' and ''Data Center for North Korean Human Rights'', since their establishment in the 2000s), and from the press.&lt;ref name="US 2016"/&gt;

==Human rights organizations==

===Amnesty International===
[[Amnesty International]] (AI; based in the United Kingdom, established in 1961) annual report ''The state of the world's human rights''&lt;ref name ="UPENN AI reports"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Hilpert &amp; Krumbein 2016"/&gt; initially included a brief mention of most countries, growing in later years to devoting 1-2 pages to the analysis of the situation of human rights in each country, including North Korea in 1977.&lt;ref name ="UPENN AI reports"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amnesty International 1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Goedde 2010"/&gt; Through the 1970s, 1980s the organization noted that its ability to report on human rights in the country was severely hampered by the opacity of the regime, and only being able to recount some scant reports.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International 1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="AI 1985"/&gt; This began to change in the 1990s when some more information became available. Also since that  point AI has also issued other stand-alone reports specific to human rights issues in North Korea.

It was not until 40 years after Kim Il-sung assumed power — in the late 1970s and 80s — that international NGOs first began to report on the human rights situation. More recently with the escape of some 25,000 North Koreans to the South, information has become more plentiful about all aspects of human rights in North Korea. Hundreds of former prisoners and former prison guards are among the defectors and have been providing testimony about their prison experiences. And since 2003, satellite photos of the camps have helped verify the information provided by the former prisoners and guards. North Koreans hiding in China have also been providing information. | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee welcomes the State party’s decision to send a strong delegation from its capital, composed of representatives of various government authorities, for the examination of the second periodic report, and the readiness expressed by the delegation to continue the dialogue with the Committee after the examination of the report. The Committee is also pleased to note that the delegation of the State party recognized the importance of the Committee’s task and intimated that the Committee could expect more prompt reporting in the future. The Committee regrets, however, the considerable delay in the submission of the report, which was due in 1987. It regrets the lack of information on the human rights situation in practice, as well as the absence of facts and data on the implementation of the Covenant. As a result, a number of credible and substantiated allegations of violations of Covenant provisions which have been brought to the attention of the Committee could not be addressed effectively and the Committee found it difficult to determine whether individuals in the State party’s territory and subject to its jurisdiction fully and effectively enjoy their fundamental rights under the Covenant.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park''' consists of several buildings in Atlanta, Georgia, including [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s boyhood home and the original '''Ebenezer Baptist Church''', the [[church (building)|church]] where King was baptized and both his father [[Martin Luther King Sr.]] and he were [[pastor]]s. These places, critical to the interpretation of the life of Martin Luther King Jr. and his legacy as a leader of the [[American Civil Rights Movement]], were included in the park when it was established on October 10, 1980. Formerly a National Historic Site, the unit was redesignated as a National Historical Park on January 8, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.myajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/trump-sign-bill-upgrading-atlanta-mlk-site/78bAJzfZYkhrwXeUvcWkOJ/|title=Trump signs bill upgrading Atlanta's MLK site|last=Hallerman|first=Tamar|date=January 9, 2018|work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|access-date=2018-02-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, the buildings included in the site make up 35 acres (0.14&amp;nbsp;km²). The [[visitor center]] contains a [[museum]] that chronicles the American Civil Rights Movement and the path of Martin Luther King Jr. An 1894 [[fire station|firehouse]] (Fire Station No. 6) served the Sweet Auburn community until 1991, and now contains a [[gift shop]] and an exhibit on [[desegregation]] in the [[Atlanta Fire Department]]. The "[[I Have a Dream]]" International World Peace Rose Garden, and a memorial tribute to [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mohandas K. Gandhi]] are part of the site, as is the "[[International Civil Rights Walk of Fame]]" which commemorates some of the courageous pioneers who worked for social justice.

Annual events celebrating [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]] in January typically draw large crowds. Speakers have included [[President of the United States|Presidents of the United States]], national and local politicians, and civil rights leaders. Remembrances are also held during [[Black History Month]] (February), and on the anniversary of King's April 4, 1968, assassination in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].

==Martin Luther King's Birth Home==
[[File:MLK's Boyhood home.jpg|thumb|left|King's boyhood home]]
The King Birth Home is located at 501 Auburn Avenue in the [[Sweet Auburn]] [[Historic districts in the United States|historic district]]. Built in 1895, it sits about a block east of Ebenezer Baptist Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/archive/malu/BirthHomeTour/mlk_welcome.html Virtual Tour of Birth Home]&lt;/ref&gt; King's maternal grandparents, Reverend Adam Daniel (A.D.) Williams, who was pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church, and his wife, Jennie Williams, bought the house for $3,500 in 1909. In 1926, when King's father married Alberta Williams, the couple moved into the house, where King Jr. was born in 1929.

The King family lived in the house until 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2006/0612/07AMSupplement/07AMSup15.cfm|title=The Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site and Places that Commemorate His Legacy|publisher=|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then converted into a two-family dwelling. The [[A. D. King|Rev. A. D. Williams King]], Dr. King's brother, lived on the second floor in the 1950s and early 1960s.

The first level includes the front porch, parlor, study, dining room, kitchen, laundry, bedroom and a bathroom. The second level includes four bedrooms and a bathroom. The visitor center offers free tours of the house led by National Park Service rangers, but with limited availability.&lt;ref name="tickets"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/malu/planyourvisit/feesandreservations.htm|title=NPS: Fees and Reservations|date=July 22, 2008|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==King Center==
{{main|King Center for Nonviolent Social Change}}In [[1968]], after King's death, [[Coretta Scott King]] founded the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change. Since 1981 the Center has been housed in a building that is part of the King complex located on Auburn Avenue adjacent to Ebenezer Baptist Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00028305/00056/13j|title=Future of King Center Up in the Air|date=February 9–15, 2006|publisher=Jacksonville Free Press|access-date=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Tombstone for Martin Luther King &amp; Coretta Scott King at MLK Historic Site in Atlanta.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King tomb in the Sweet Auburn district, preserved within the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site]]
In 1977, a memorial tomb was dedicated to King. His remains were moved to the tomb, on a plaza between the center and the church. King's gravesite and a reflecting pool are located next to Freedom Hall. After her death, Mrs. King was interred with her husband on February 7, 2006. An [[eternal flame]] is located nearby.

Freedom Hall at 449 Auburn Avenue features exhibits about Dr. and Mrs. King, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and American activist [[Rosa Parks]]. It hosts special events and programs associated with civil rights and social justice. It contains a Grand Foyer, large theater/conference auditorium, bookstore and resource center, and various works of art from across the globe. The Grand Foyer features art from [[Africa]] and Georgia. The paneling lining the staircase is from the [[sapeli]] tree, which grows in [[Nigeria]].

As of 2006, the King Center is a privately owned [[inholding]] within the authorized boundaries of the park. The King family has debated among themselves as to whether they should sell it to the National Park Service to ensure preservation.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Visitor center==
[[File:Courage to lead exhibit.jpg|thumb|right|''Courage to Lead'' exhibit at the visitor center]]
The visitor center at 449 Auburn Avenue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thekingcenter.org/|title=The Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change|publisher=|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was built in 1996 and features the multimedia exhibit ''Courage To Lead'', which follows the parallel paths of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement. Visitors can also walk down a stylized "Freedom Road". The ''Children of Courage'' exhibit, geared towards children, tells the story of the children of the Civil Rights Movement with a challenge to our youth today. Video programs are presented on a continuing basis and there is a staffed information desk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/malu/planyourvisit/visitor_center.htm|title=Visitor Center - Martin Luther King Jr National Historic Site (U.S. National Park Service)|publisher=|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gandhi Promenade==
The statue of [[Mohandas Gandhi]] was donated by the [[Indian Council for Cultural Relations]], India, in collaboration with The National Federation of Indian American Associations and The Embassy of India, USA. The inscribed bronze plaque reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donet.com/~eprice/mlknhs.htm|title=The Gandhi Promenade at the MLK National Historic Site|publisher=|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Nonviolence, to be a potent force, must begin with the mind. Nonviolence of the mere body without the cooperation of the mind is nonviolence of the weak of the cowardly, and has, therefore, no potency. It is a degrading performance. If we bear malice and hatred in our bosoms and pretend not to retaliate, it must recoil upon us and lead to our destruction.|author=Gandhi}}

{{quote|Tribute to the Mahatma Gandhi was inevitable. If humanity is to progress, Gandhi is inescapable. He lived, thought and acted, inspired by the vision of humanity evolving toward a world of peace and harmony. We may ignore him at our own risk|author=Martin Luther King Jr.}}

==International Civil Rights Walk of Fame==
{{Main|International Civil Rights Walk of Fame}} 
The "International Civil Rights Walk of Fame" was created in 2004 and honors some of the participants in the Civil Rights Movement. The walk along the Promenade, includes footsteps, marked in granite and bronze. According to the National Park Service, the Walk of Fame was created to "pay homage to the "brave warriors" of justice who sacrificed and struggled to make equality a reality for all." The new addition to the area is expected to enhance the historic value of the area, enrich cultural heritage, and augment tourist attractions.

The "Walk of Fame" is the brainchild of [[Xernona Clayton]], founder and executive producer of the renowned Trumpet Awards and a civil rights activist in her own right. Ms. Clayton said, "This is a lasting memorial to those whose contributions were testaments to the fact that human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable. This historic site will serve as a symbol of pride and a beacon of hope for all future generations. We are looking forward to building a monument to the civil struggle that depicts every step taken toward the goal of justice and the tireless exertions and passionate concern of these dedicated individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birminghamtimes.com/2013/12/international-civil-rights-walk-of-fame-announces-2014-inductees/ |title=International Civil Rights Walk of Fame Announces 2014 Inductees |date=December 19, 2013 |work=The Birmingham Times |accessdate=February 9, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prince Hall==
Located at 332 Auburn Avenue, the Prince Hall Masonic Temple is where the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) established its initial headquarters in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/115/crpt/srpt49/CRPT-115srpt49.pdf|title=Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park Act of 2017, Senate Committee Report|publisher=|accessdate=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This historic and distinguished civil rights organization was co-founded by Dr. King, who also served as its first president.  Owned by the [[Prince Hall Freemasonry|Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Georgia]], the building was included within the authorized boundary of the park in 2018.

==History==
The Swedish Metapedia was founded in 2006 by Anders Lagerström (born October 14, 1977), a [[neo-Nazi]] publisher from Linköping, Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Popkonsertbloggen |url=http://www.corren.se/nyheter/linkoping/nazistsida-blir-fall-for-jk-4185002.aspx |title=Nazistsida blir fall för JK - Linköping - Corren.se - Nyheter Linköping Östergötland |language=sv |publisher=Corren.se |date=2007-02-08 |accessdate=2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Anders Lagerström has long been involved in extreme right-wing organizations. In 2000, he was convicted of spraying tear gas in the face of a police officer. In 2002 he started the Nordic publishing house, which specializes in issuing and selling Nazi literature and white power music. Lagerström is also a prominent figure in the [[w:sv:Nordiska förbundet|Nordic Federation]]. The Nazi organization seems to be creating a "Nordic nation state". The organization's website says the following about how this imaginary nation should look: "It means a society populated by a people, and a state power and mass media entirely under Nordic control."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Popkonsertbloggen |url=http://www.corren.se/nyheter/nazist-anhallen-for-grovt-ran-4146657.aspx |title=Nazist anhållen för grovt rån - Nyheter - Corren.se - Nyheter Linköping Östergötland |language=sv |publisher=Corren.se |date= |accessdate=2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Metapedia does not mention Lagerström's connections to the Swedish [[far-right]] on any of its sites, instead stating it as an "electronic encyclopedia which focuses on culture, art, science, philosophy and politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Main_Page|title=Main Page - Metapedia|website=en.metapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Swedish historian [[Rasmus Fleischer]] wrote that:

{{Quote|In 2007, another network began to crystallize within Europe's radical right but with a vastly different ideological character. Activists from the Swedish group Nordiska Förbundet made a coordinated effort to use the internet to propagate a more 'positive' image of {{sic|[[Neo-fascism|neo fascist]]}}, [[third position]] and national revolutionary politics. They created a blog portal (Motpol.nu), a web community (Nordisk.nu) and a wiki site (Metapedia). Today there exist a dozen editions of Metapedia, making it a vital medium for dissemination of the ideology labeled here as "multi-fascism". Metapedia tends to promote antisemitism in a cautious way, not stating too much in words but instead using the hyperlinked wiki format to make insinuations about a [[Jewish conspiracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Rasmus |last=Fleischer|authorlink1=Rasmus Fleischer |chapter=Two Fascism|editor1-last=Deland|editor1-first=Mats|editor2-last=Minkenberg|editor2-first=Michael|editor3-last=Mays|editor3-first=Cristin|title=In the Tracks of Breivik: Far Right Networks in Northern and Eastern Europe|date=2014|publisher=Lit Verlag|isbn=978-3643905420|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Content==
The site's mission statement states one of its goals is "to present a more balanced and fair image of the pro-European struggle for the general public as well as for academics, who until now have been dependent on strongly biased and hostile 'researchers' like ''[[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight]]'', [[Anti-Defamation League]], [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], [[Simon Wiesenthal Centre]], and such."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Metapedia: Mission statement |work= en.metapedia.org |publisher= Metapedia |date= 2010-06-17 |accessdate=9 March 2011 &lt;!-- |url= http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Metapedia:Mission_statement |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5x33uimgC?url=http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Metapedia:Mission_statement |archivedate= 2011-03-09 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Metapedia logo features the head of a sculpture ("''Youth''") by the German artist [[Arno Breker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Metapedia: Projektbeschreibung |work= de.metapedia.org |publisher= Metapedia |language=German |date= 2011-01-24 |accessdate=9 March 2011 &lt;!-- |url= http://de.metapedia.org/wiki/Metapedia:Projektbeschreibung |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5x30gQwoE?url=http://de.metapedia.org/wiki/Metapedia:Projektbeschreibung |archivedate= 2011-03-09 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose works were endorsed by the Nazi authorities as the antithesis of degenerate art.&lt;!-- See "Arno Breker" page for citation --&gt;

According to the [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]n [[Office for the Protection of the Constitution]], Metapedia's articles are characterized by [[historical negationism]] and lauding [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="report08"/&gt; For this reason, the German [[Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons]] ({{lang|de|Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien}}) started an [[Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons#The indexing process|indexing process]], which would consider as to whether Metapedia is "harmful to young people".&lt;ref name="bulletin1610215"&gt;[http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/16/102/1610215.pdf Bulletin of the German Parliament 16/10215] from 12 September 2008, pp. 6f.: Answer of the German government to a parliamentary query by the Green Member of the German Parliament Monika Lazar {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2007, within half a year of the launching of the original Swedish edition, Metapedia received much Swedish media attention for its similarity to Wikipedia and some of its contents, in particular for its positive characterization of many Nazi German personalities, for cataloguing [[Jews]] in [[Swedish media]], and for characterizing Swedish companies as either "Swedish-owned" or "Jewish-owned".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/debatt-essa/judeforfoljelser-pa-internet {{lang|sv|Judeförföljelser på internet}}] [[Dagens Nyheter]], 8 February 2007 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kristianstadsbladet.se/kultur/article1042977/Propagandapedia.html Propagandapedia] [[Kristianstadsbladet]], 20 February 2007 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to an investigation by the [[Chancellor of Justice (Sweden)|Chancellor of Justice]] ({{lang|sv|Justitiekanslern}}) to decide whether the site should be prosecuted for inciting hatred or for violating the Swedish [[Privacy Law]] ({{lang|sv|[[:sv:Personuppgiftslagen|Personuppgiftslagen]]}}).&lt;ref name="corren0729b"&gt;[http://www.corren.se/ostergotland/linkoping/?articleId=4185002 {{lang|sv|Nazistsida blir fall för JK}}] [[Östgöta Correspondenten]], 9 February 2007 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reviewing the site's contents, the Chancellor of Justice decided to terminate investigations, since nothing had been found that violated the Freedom of Speech Act ({{lang|sv|[[:sv:Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen|Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen]]}}) or the Privacy Law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sr.se/ostergotland/nyheter/artikel.asp?artikel=1213676 {{lang|sv|Ingen förundersökning kring Metapedia}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205070731/http://www.sr.se/ostergotland/nyheter/artikel.asp?artikel=1213676 |date=5 February 2008}}, Sveriges Radio Östergötland, 20 February 2007 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, in a response to further attention given to the site, the Swedish Chancellor of Justice opined that Metapedia presented a positive image of Adolf Hitler, but decided not to restart an investigation since this was not illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fgj.se/Filuppladdning.asp?did=202&amp;OmrID=4&amp;SubID=110&amp;SubSubID=0 {{lang|sv|JK: Positiv text om Hitler inte hets mot folkgrupp}}]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} Föreningen Grävande Journalister, 26 January 2009 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the trust, applicants who wished to utilise these funds had to be white males who were not Jewish. The court held that these requirements for eligibility discriminated on the basis of race, religion and sex, and held that the trust funds should instead be available to any applicant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23457">'''Minority influence''', a form of [[social influence]], takes place when a member of a [[minority group]] influences the majority to accept the minority's [[beliefs]] or [[behavior]]. This occurs when a small group or an individual acts as an agent of social change by questioning established societal perceptions, and proposing alternative, original ideas which oppose the existing social norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardikiotis|first1=A.|title=Minority influence.|journal=Social And Personality Psychology Compass|date=2011|volume=5|issue=9|pages=679–693|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2011.00377}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of social influence: majority influence (resulting in [[conformity]] and public compliance) and minority influence (resulting in conversion). Majority influence refers to the majority trying to produce conformity on the minority, while minority influence is converting the majority to adopt the thinking of the minority group.&lt;ref name="Sampson, E. 1991"&gt;Sampson, E. (1991). Social worlds, personal lives: An introduction to social psychology. (6th Ed.) San Diego, CA: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other forms of [[Social influence|influence]], minority influence is often thought of as a more innovative form of social change, because it usually involves a personal shift in private opinion. Without influential minorities challenging the majority view, there would be no new ideas or positive change in society. Examples of this are the Civil Rights movement in America and the suffragettes campaigning for votes for women.

==History==
Nearly all early [[research]] on minority influence focused on how the majority influenced the minority, based on the [[Natural deduction|assumption]] of many [[psychologists]] that it would be very hard for the minority to have any influence on the majority. [[Serge Moscovici|Moscovici]] had a different perspective, as he believed that it was possible for a minority influence to overcome majority influence. As a result, he conducted his own study on minority influence in 1969. Similar to Asch's (1951) 'blue-green' experiment, to see if a group of four participants were influenced by a minority. His research was important as it was one of the first studies to show that a minority was able to change the opinions of the majority. The research of Moscovici and his colleagues opened the door to more research on the subject.

== Mechanism ==
Moscovici's (1980, 1985) conversion theory outlines a dual process of social influence. When an individual's views differ from the majority view, this causes inner turmoil, motivating the individual to reduce conflict by using a comparison process, leading to compliance and public acceptance of the majority position to avoid ostracism and potential ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Crano|first1= W. D.|last2= Seyranian|first2= V.|title= Majority and minority influence.|journal= Social and Personality Psychology Compass|date= 2007|volume= 1|issue= 1|pages= 572–589|doi= 10.1111/j.1751-9004.2007.00028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, majority influence is seen as normative social influence because often it is generated by a desire to fit in and conform to the group, e.g. Asch's (1951) line study. 
Conversely, a minority view is more distinctive, capturing attention and resulting in a validation process, where people carefully analyse the discrepancy between their own view and the minority view. This often results in attitude conversion, where the individual is convinced that the minority view is correct, which is much more likely to be private rather than public.

Majority influence occurs when people [[conform]] to certain beliefs and behaviours in order to be accepted by others. Unlike majority influence, minority influence can rarely influence others through [[normative social influence]] because the majority is indifferent to the minority's [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] of them. To influence the majority, the minority group would take the approach of [[informational social influence]] (Wood, 1994). By presenting information that the majority does not know or expect, this new or unexpected information catches the [[attention]] of the majority to carefully consider and examine the minority's view. After consideration, when the majority finds more validity and merit in the minority's view, the majority group has a higher chance of accepting part or all of the minority opinion.&lt;ref name="Wood, W. 1994"&gt;Wood, W., Lundgren, S., Ouellette, J., Busceme, S., &amp; Blackstone, T. (1994). "Minority Influence: A Meta-Analytic Review of Social Influence Processes".  ''Psychological Bulletin''. Vol 115, No 3, pp. 323-345.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the majority group may accept part or all of the minority view, that fact does not necessarily indicate that the majority has been completely influenced by the minority. A study by [[Elizabeth Mannix]] and Margaret Neale (2005) shows that having the [[Advocacy|support]] from the majority [[leader]] could prove the critical factor in getting the minority opinion to be heard and be accepted. The support of a leader gives the majority more confidence in the merit of the minority opinion, leading to an overall respect for the minority. The strength of the "key people" (Van Avermaet, 1996) comes from the reputation built from their consistency of behaviors and ideas. Involving key people will benefit the minority view because people are more open to hear from others whom they trust and respect.&lt;ref name="Van Avermaet, E. 1996"&gt;Van Avermaet, E. (1996). "Social influence in small groups". Introduction to Social Psychology: A European Perspective (2nd Ed.). Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; In minority influence, a few influential leaders can influence the opposing majority to the minority's way of thinking.&lt;ref name="Sunitiyoso, Y. 2010"&gt;Sunitiyoso, Y., Avineri, E., &amp; Catterjee, K.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affecting factors==

===Size of minority===
Moscovici and Nemeth (1974) argue that a minority of one is more influential than a minority of more than one, as one person is more likely to be consistent over long periods of time and will not divide the majority’s [[attention]].&lt;ref name="Moscovici, S. 1974"&gt;Moscovici, S. &amp; Nemeth, C. (1974). Social psychology: Classic and contemporary integrations (7th Ed.). Oxford, England: Rand Mcnally.&lt;/ref&gt; They explain that a person may question themself: "How can they be so wrong and yet so sure of themselves?", resulting in a tendency to reevaluate the entire situation, considering all possible alternatives, including the minority view. On the other hand, two people are more likely to be influential than one person as they are less likely to be seen as strange or [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]]. More recent research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arbuthnot|first1=J|last2=Wayner|first2=M|title=Minority Influence: Effects of size, conversion, and sex.|journal=The Journal of Psychology: Interdisciplinary and Applied.|date=1982|volume=111|issue=2|pages=285–295|doi=10.1080/00223980.1982.9915370}}&lt;/ref&gt; has supported the latter due to the belief that a minority with two or more, if consistent, has more credibility and is therefore more likely to influence the majority.&lt;ref name="Moscovici, S. 1974" /&gt;

===Size of majority===
The social impact model (Latané &amp; Wolf 1981) predicts that as the size of the majority grows, the influence of the minority decreases, both in public and in private attitude change.&lt;ref name="Latané &amp; Wolf 1981"&gt;Latané, B. &amp; Wolf, S. (September 1981). "The social impact of majorities and minorities". ''Psychological Review''. Vol 88, Issue 5, pp. 438-453.&lt;/ref&gt; The social impact model further explains that social impact is the multiplicative effect of strength (power, status, knowledge), the immediacy (physical proximity and recency), and the number of group members, supporting the view that a minority will be less influential on a larger majority.

Clark and Maass (1990) looked at the interaction between minority influence and majorities of varying sizes, and found that, like Latané &amp; Wolf's findings, the minority's influence decreases in a negatively accelerating power function as the majority increases.&lt;ref name="Clark &amp; Masss (1990)"&gt;Clark, R. D. and Maass, A. (1990), The effects of majority size on minority influence. European Journal of Social Psychology, 20: 99–117. {{doi|10.1002/ejsp.2420200203}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in findings that minority support should decrease considerably with the first few members of the majority, but additional members will have a marginally declining impact on getting people to conform to the majority position.

Similarly, Latané and Wolf cite Solomon Asch's work with "the magic number three". After his [[Asch conformity experiments|experiments]], Asch concludes that when the majority consists of just one or two individuals, there is very little conformity. The addition of a third majority member dramatically increases conformity, but increases ''beyond'' three did not result in increasing amounts of conformity.&lt;ref name="Latané &amp; Wolf 1981" /&gt;

===Behavioural style===
Minority influence is more likely to occur if the point of view of the minority is consistent, flexible, and appealing to the [[majority]]. Having a consistent and unwavering [[opinion]] will increase the [[appeal]] to the majority, leading to a higher chance of [[adaption]] to the minority view. However, any wavering opinions from the minority group could lead the majority to dismiss the minority's claims and opinions.&lt;ref name="Aronson, E. 2007"&gt;Aronson, E., Wilson, T.D., &amp; Akert, A.M. (2007). Social Psychology (6th Ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Serge Moscovici]] and Nemeth (1974) argued that minority influence is effective as long as there is consistency over time and agreement among the members of the minority.&lt;ref name="Moscovici, S. 1974" /&gt; If this consistency were lost, then the minority would lose its [[credibility]]. This can be the case if a member of the minority deserts and joins the majority, as this damages the consistency and unity of the minority. After this occurrence, members of the majority are less likely to shift their position to that of the minority.
The key to minority influence being successful is not just consistency, but how the majority interprets consistency. If the consistent minority are seen as too inflexible, rigid, and unwilling to change, they are unlikely to influence the majority. However, if they appear flexible and compromising, they will be seen as less extreme and more reasonable, having a better chance of changing majority views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mugny|first1=G|last2=Papastamou|first2=S|title=When rigidity does not fail: Individualization and psychologization as resistances to the diffusion of minority innovations.|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|date=1980|volume=10|pages=43–61|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420100104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dispositional and situational factors===
Research shows that individuals are more likely to listen to the minority and take on their ideas if they identify with them as being similar to themselves. Maass &amp; Clark (1984) arranged for a group of [[heterosexual]] participants to hear a debate on [[gay rights]]. The results showed that the majority heterosexual group debating was easier for the heterosexual participants to relate to. Therefore, the minority [[homosexual]] group had less of an influence. Influence is more likely to occur if the minority (or majority) is part of our '[[in-group]]' as we are more likely to be influenced by those who are similar to us. This research contradicts with Moscovici’s view that deviant minorities (or out-groups) are essential for minority influence to occur. In-group minorities are more likely to be successful, as they are seen as part of the group, and therefore their ideas are seen as more acceptable. On the other hand, out-groups are more likely to be discriminated, as they are not seen as part of the group, causing them to seem strange or unusual.&lt;ref name="Maass &amp; Clark. 1988"&gt;Maass, A. &amp; Clark, R.D. (1988). "Social categorization in minority influence: The case of homosexuality". ''European Journal of Social Psychology''. Vol 18, pp. 347-367.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the decisions of others may affect the potency of minority influence. Asch (1952) conducted a study in which test subjects would be accompanied one of two "partners" during a series of questions posed to a group: a) a partner that would agree with the subject's minority view, or b) a partner that would be more extremely incorrect than the majority. Asch found that regardless of the role of the "partner", the fact that the consensus was broken – even if by just one individual ("the magic number one") – was enough to reduce conformity to a majority, and add credibility to the minority view.&lt;ref name="Asch (1952)"&gt;Asch, S. E. Social psychology. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application: juries==

===Jury dynamics===

===Stories, evidence and verdicts===

Most juries will elect a leader and then decide whether the voting for a verdict will be public or private. Using the '''Story Model Theory''' which suggests that cognitive processing of trial information is what drives jurors to mentally organize evidence in coherent, credible narratives, jurors will approach a verdict in one of two ways. The first, '''Verdict Driven''' jurors sort the evidence into categories of guilty and not guilty before deliberation. these types of juries feel the need to reach a verdict quickly, thus they may feel social pressure outside of the group to deliver the content in a time efficient manner. On the other hand, '''Evidence Based''' jurors will resist making a final decision on the verdict until they have reviewed all the evidence. These juries tend to explore their different options as a group and are less influenced by the social pressure outside of the group to reach a verdict quickly.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Forsyth, D. R. (2010). Group dynamics. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minority influence in juries===

The verdicts favored by the majority on the first ballot becomes the jury's final decision in about 90% of all jury trials, but the minority convinces the majority to change in about one out of every ten trials. If the majority was always right, we reach the conclusion that minorities (in a jury setting) do not have influence at all, this is not the case. Often when a jury is hung, it is usually because one or two jurors are holding our/resisting the influence of the majority. If these jury members are consistent with their views, it is likely they will be able to convince another member of the jury to also side with their view. As time goes on, more and more juries may change their vote in favor of the original minority. It is however, extremely important the original jurors are consistent and confident in their opinions. The more unsteady they appear, the less likely they will be able to conquer the majority.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Status and influence in juries===
Members of a jury who have high prestige or status are usually more influential than members who are not. Members who are also of high socioeconomic status are also more likely to influential in the jury deliberation process. This is demonstrated by the correlation between private preliberation opinion and jury's final decision was .50 for rich members and .2 for laborers. However, in recent analysis, race and sex no longer determine influence in juries.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Improving juries===

# '''Jury Size:''' modifying could influence group structure, representativeness, and majority influence; large juries are more likely to be hung, but small and large juries do not significantly differ in the types of verdicts reached.
# '''Unanimity:''' juries that do not have to reach a unanimous decision render their judgements twice as quickly and are less likely to be hung.
# '''Procedural Innovation:''' we can improve juries by making the instructions given to juries (prior to deliberation) clearer and more understandable. If the members understand at the beginning of the process what their requirements are, then they will be more efficient in their delivery of the verdict, and be more understanding of the process.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Yielding==

===Social cryptoamnesia===
After a number of members have shifted their opinion to agree with the minority group, that minority becomes a majority. This is known as the snowball effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Avermaet|first1=E.|title=Social Influence in small groups|journal=Introduction to Social Psychology: A European Perspective|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a minority creates social change in society, the new view becomes an integral part of the society's culture. This results in the source of the minority influence that led to change being forgotten, which is known as social cryptoamnesia.&lt;ref name="Perez, 1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perez|first1=J. A.|last2=Papastamou|first2=S.|last3=Mugny|first3=G.|title='Zeitgeist' and minority influence: Where is the causality: A comment on Clark (1990)|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|date=1995|volume=25|issue=6|pages=703–710|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420250609}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Minority influence can be successful if people can [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociate]] between the [[socio-cognitive]] activities of [[Psychological resistance|resistance]] that are induced by the source and other activities of resistance that develop from the content of the message. The process of dissociation is explained by social cryptoamnesia:&lt;ref name="Perez, 1995"/&gt; what was originally considered different is gradually constructed as an alternative (Perez, 1995).

A person can be affected by minority influence whether directly or indirectly. However, if one is not aware of the influence, the minority ideas could be taken as one's own while disregarding where the original idea came from. Social cryptoamnesia explains that thoughts and ideas that challenge or shock are stored in [[latency stage|latent]] memory without retaining the ownership of the idea. Ideas that were supposedly forgotten have reappeared in the person's mind as his or her own belief or thought.&lt;ref name="Perez, 1995" /&gt; This major attitude change takes place when the [[zeitgeist]] has changed. In history, minorities have changed the attitudes of society, and the attitudes of society have changed the personal opinion of the majority in that society. Although minority influence may not affect a person immediately, one's beliefs and behaviors may change over time due to social cryptoamnesia.

==Broadening views in organizations==
By integrating the [[theory]] of minority influence in [[organizations]], people may be more open to learning and change, benefiting the organization in the end.

===Increasing diversity in the workplace===
Not only is minority influence seen in [[social groups]], but this type of social influence is also present in the workplace. Incorporating the concept of minority influence can encourage [[multiculturalism|diversity]] and [[Social change|change]] in a [[corporate]] organization. Mannix and Neale (2005) performed a case study on a company that asked all the senior managers to mentor junior managers, preparing at least three younger managers to be ready and [[competence (human resources)|competent]] enough to replace the older managers. From this study, the firm realized that they were not achieving the extent of diversity that they intended. As a result, the company required at least one of the three junior managers in training to be a woman or underrepresented minority. This new requirement improved the intended diversity in the organization as well as the interaction between the senior manager mentor and the junior manager mentee.&lt;ref name="Mannix &amp; Neale. 2005" /&gt;

===Improving organizational values and culture===
In another study by Mannix and Neale, yearly performance evaluations were completed for Hispanic, African American, and Asian managers. Their performance reviews evaluated the managers on less tangible measures related to [[leadership]], an essential factor that is considered for receiving a promotion. Upon reflection of the company's performance evaluations, a senior leader suggested that the [[criterion validity|criteria]] on which managers were assessed was [[bias]]ed toward a "white, Anglo management style" (Mannix, 2005). As a solution, the leadership performance and promotion criteria of the performance reviews were revised. From this change and inclusion of minority influence, managers were able to learn from their strengths and weaknesses and change. Along with changing the criteria of performance evaluations, the organization itself underwent a change in [[values]] and [[culture]].&lt;ref name="Mannix &amp; Neale. 2005" /&gt;

==Combined with majority influence==
There is evidence to suggest that it is possible for minority influence and majority influence to work together. A study by Clark (1994) uses a [[jury]] setting from the film ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'' to investigate social influence. Some of the participants were asked to just read the arguments from one of the characters (who acted as the minority), while the other group were also told how he changed the opinion of the rest of the jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=Russell D. III |title=The Role of Censorship in Minority Influence |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=331–338 |year=1994 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420240303 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social influence was present in both groups, but was stronger in the group that was exposed to both the arguments (minority influence) and the knowledge that the jury conformed (majority influence).

Grand Ayatollah [[Sayyid]] '''Muhammad ibn Mahdi al-Hussaini al-Shirazi''' ({{lang-ar|آية الله العظمى السيد محمد بن مهدي الحسيني الشيرازي}}; August 31, 1928 – December 17, 2001), commonly known as '''Mohammad Al-Shirazi''', was a [[Twelver]] [[Shia]] [[Marja']], politician and religious leader.

==Early life==
Muhammad Shirazi was born in the holy city of [[Najaf]], [[Iraq]], in AD 1928 (1347 [[Islamic calendar|AH]]) into a Persian clerical family. Other members of the Shirazi family are Grand Ayatollah [[Mirza Hassan Shirazi]], leader of Iran's constitutional movement, also known as the [[Tobacco Movement]], a successful boycott of the British tobacco monopoly, and Grand Ayatollah Muhammad Taqi Shirazi, leader of [[Iraqi revolt against the British|the 1920 revolution in Iraq]]. His nephews, Grand Ayatollah [[Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi]] and Ayatollah [[Hadi al-Modarresi]], are leading jurists. Al-Shirazi's father, Grand Ayatollah [[Mahdi Hussaini Shirazi| Mahdi Shirazi]], was a leading scholar and the Marja'. He was subsequently able to assume the office of the Marje' at the early age of 33 in 1961.

In 1971 he was exiled from Iraq to [[Lebanon]] by the Ba'thist regime.  From Lebanon Al-Shirazi  moved to [[Kuwait]] where he was influential in the rise of religious radicalism, and also indirectly affecting religious discourse among Sunnis.

At the time Al-Shirazi came into conflict with other prominent Shia religious figures in [[Najaf]]. Perhaps the most prominent Shia religious leader of the time, Grand Ayatollah [[Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei]], sought to dismiss Al-Shirazi's status as a scholar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aei.org/outlook/foreign-and-defense-policy/regional/middle-east-and-north-africa/has-kuwait-reached-the-sectarian-tipping-point/ Has Kuwait reached the sectarian tipping point?], [[American Enterprise Institute]], August 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Through personal charisma and intellectual arguments, Al-Shirazi built up a large following in Kuwait and Iraq. His followers became known as the 'Shiraziyyin' and tended to be critical of existing Shi'i religious establishments. In 1979, with fellow Shia Islamist clerics in power in Iran, Al-Shirazi moved to Iran and settled in [[Qom]].

His brothers are [[Sadiq Hussaini Shirazi]] and [[Mujtaba Hussaini Shirazi]].

==Theory of clerical rule==
Al-Shirazi was a leading Islamist political theorist and devised the Hukumat al-Fuqaha' principle of theocratic rule. According to Cambridge University's Toby Matthiesen: "The political theory of Muhammad al-Shirazi and the MVM [Movement of Vanguard Missions] was quite close to Khomeini’s notion of velayet-e faqih (the guardianship of the jurisprudent), although al-Shirazi favored the theory that not a single cleric, but a council of scholars should govern the Islamic State (hukumat al-fuqaha’/shurat al-fuqaha’)."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/5263184/Hizbullah_al-Hijaz_A_History_of_The_Most_Radical_Saudi_Shi_a_Opposition_Group Toby Matthiesen], Hizbollah Al-Hjaz: A History of the Most Radical Saudi Shia Opposition Group, Middle East Journal, Spring 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Al-Shirazi's theory government would be in the form of a 'Consultative System of Leadership' composed of senior clerics, and he called for the establishment of the 'Leadership Council of Religious Authorities'. He argued for the establishment of a Universal Islamic Government to encompass all the Muslim countries run in accordance with Hukumat al-Fuqaha'.

==Iranian Revolution==
Al-Shirazi was initially an important figure within Iran's Islamic Republic with his supporters in key roles within the Iranian state in the 1980s. He was the spiritual guide of the Movement of Vanguard Missionaries,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; an umbrella group for Iran-based Islamist paramilitaries that included military groups like the [[Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain]]. Iran maintained support for these paramilitaries in the 1980s through the Office of Liberation Movements, part of the [[Revolutionary Guards]]. The Movement of Vanguard Missionaries operated as a military organisation and it was active in Bahrain and Iraq.

He has been critical of the Iranian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mamouri|first1=Ali|title=Shiite Leaders in Iraq, Iran React to Egypt Killings|url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/07/shiite-leaders-iraq-iran-egypt-killing-shehata.html|website=Al-Monitor|accessdate=20 December 2017|language=en-us|date=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iran power struggle==
Al-Shirazi expected a bigger role in the Islamic Revolution and this was a point of tension between him and Grand Ayatollah Khomeini. In addition, Al-Shirazi believed he was the senior cleric to Khomeini, as both competed for the position of marja al-taqlid.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; As the revolution progressed Al-Shirazi fell out with Ayatollah Khomeini and particularly his successor, Grand Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]].

The Movement of Vanguard Missionaries was close to radicals in the Iranian government within the Revolutionary Guards. As the radicals were increasingly sidelined by the more moderate Sayyid ‘Ali Khamenei and ‘Ali-Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Al-Shirazi's influence waned.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Al-Shirazi was highly critical of Khamenei's bid to become a marja and assumption of the position of Iranian supreme leader.

With the political ascendency of Khamenei and Rafsanjani, Al-Shirazi's followers were at times mistreated by the government of the Iranian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;See also Reza Afshari, Human Rights in Iran, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, one of his sons Seyd Morteza Shirazi was imprisoned for 18 months after which "reportedly escaped to [[Syria]] and has requested political asylum, the INP reported in Tehran."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iran.org/news/970218.htm FDI News-wire, Number 36.] February 18, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Amnesty International reports that in Iran:
&lt;blockquote&gt;several followers of Grand Ayatollah Sayed Mohammad Shirazi were detained during [1998]. In January Sheikh Mohammad Amin Ghafoori, a well-known religious figure and writer, his wife, and Sayed Hossein Fali were arrested in [[Qom]]. There were reports that they were beaten during arrest and tortured in detention. Sayed Hossein Fali was reported to have been released in June. Sheikh Mohammad Amin Ghafoori was said to have been sentenced in July to two and a half years' imprisonment by the Special Court for the Clergy, whose procedures fell far short of international standards. In October, five other followers of Grand Ayatollah Shirazi, including Reza Sultani, were reported to have been arrested and they remained held incommunicado at the end of the year. Sheikh Sadiq Za'eemiyan has also been harassed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Seven students arrested in November 1995, apparently on account of their links with Grand Ayatollah Shirazi (see Amnesty International Reports 1996 and 1997), were released in June. However, two of them, Aman Allah Bushehri and Sheikh Mohammad Qahtani, were reportedly rearrested in July and August respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/ailib/aireport/ar98/mde13.htm|title=Amnesty International Report 1998.|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114131215/http://www.amnesty.org/ailib/aireport/ar98/mde13.htm|archivedate=2007-11-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to reports, methods of torture used against some of these detainees have included beatings, prolonged sleep deprivation, electric shocks and threatened execution by electrocution after attaching electrodes to the body. Sheikh Ali Maash is said to have required medical treatment after his release for the effects of torture, including for a toe on his right foot which was broken and left untreated." &lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International Report 13/24/97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite these differences, Al-Shirazi's followers were part of the most pro-Iranian political faction in the post-Saddam Iraq, the [[United Iraqi Alliance]]. The Shirazis' Islamic Action Organization contested parliamentary elections along with other pro-Iranian parties such as the [[Badr Organization]] and [[SCIRI]] as part of the United Iraqi Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juancole.com/2004/12/platform-of-united-iraqi-alliance.html|title=Platform Of United Iraqi Alliance - Informed Comment|website=www.juancole.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Islamic Action Organization had one minister in government in Iraq, the State Minister for Civil Society Affairs, Adil al-Asadi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1342984.html Iraq Report: May 26, 2006] Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty, May 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary contributions==
Al-Shirazi has written on different subjects including science, ethics, politics, economics, sociology, law, human rights, etc. He has published over 1200 books, treatises and studies. [[Assad Ali]], a poet and professor of Arabic literature, called him the "King of Authors", because of his prolific output. A bid by Assad Ali to get the [[Guinness World Records]] to recognise Muhammad al-Shirazi as the most prolific writer in Arabic was rejected by the publisher.

Al-Shirazi believed in the fundamental and elementary nature of freedom including freedom of expression, political plurality, debate and discussion, tolerance and forgiveness.  Regarding war and violence he advocated war as a last resort in response to an enemy who has forced the situation.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Imam Muhammad al-Shirazi, ''War, Peace and Non-violence: An Islamic perspective,'' tr. Ali ibn Adam and Z. Olyabek , (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}  He called for the Jizyah tax to be imposed on non-Muslims saying 'The obstinate person should become less obstinate in the face of what should return him gradually to the truth.'&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|7}} He believed in the "Consultative System of Leadership" and called for the establishment of the Leadership Council of Religious Authorities. He called for the establishment of the ''Universal Islamic Government'' to encompass all the Muslim countries. These and other ideas are discussed in detail in his books.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

He had established many Islamic centers, medical and charitable financial services, educational, welfare and social foundations, libraries, and Hawzah's, or universities for Islamic Studies, in different regions of the world. Hundreds of individuals have graduated from his schools as scholars, lecturers, authors and intellectuals.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Death==
Shirazi died on December 17, 2001 in Qom, Iran. After his death, his legacy and school of thought were continued through the [[Hawza|Hawzah'a]] which he had established. His brother [[Sadiq Hussaini Shirazi]] is at the helm of this school of thought&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imamshirazi.com|title=imamshirazi.com|website=www.imamshirazi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a leading religious authority in his own right.

'''''Philémon''''' is a series in the [[Franco-Belgian comics]] style created by [[France|French]] artist [[Fred (comics)|Fred]] and published by [[Dargaud]]. The series began serial publication in the French magazine ''[[Pilote]]'' on July 22, 1965,&lt;ref name="BDO-p65"&gt;{{Cite web|last=BDoubliées|title=Pilote année 1965|url=http://bdoubliees.com/journalpilote/annees/1965.htm|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; before it eventually became an album series. (''Pilote'' was a direct response to the Franco-Belgian weeklies ''Spirou'' and ''Journal de Tintin'', and sought to test more recent and dynamic strips on young and adolescent readers.) The general tone of the series is of [[fantastic realism]], depicting the adventures of the young farmboy Philémon in surreal adventures featuring odd creatures in odd places, and it is considered one of the most poetic and original ''bande dessinée'' series of all time.&lt;ref name="Lambiek Fred"&gt;{{cite web | last =Lambiek Comiclopedia | title = Fred  | url =http://lambiek.net/artists/f/fred.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Philémon is a rural French teenager. His best friend is a donkey named Anatole. Philémon's father easily gets angry and he despairs at the "tall stories" his son tells him. 

Philémon's early adventures begin when, by accident, Philémon fell down a well and ended up on a beach. This well was a "portal" and Philémon ended up in an odd world, reminiscent of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'' in its alterations of commonly accepted reality, with strange characters which varied from people with butterfly wings to [[centaur]]s. Philémon also met Barthélémy, a well digger who had gone through the same portal and ended up trapped on an island for forty years. The island was one of many which formed the letters of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] on maps and [[globe]]s. In the course of their adventures Philémon and Mr. Barthélémy would travel from between their native countryside to the various islands, using Uncle Félicien's magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cast Away on the Letter "A" review|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/fred/cast-away-on-the-letter-a/|website=Kirkus Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main characters==
'''Philémon''': a teenage farm boy who finds himself traveling to the various and fantastic islands that make up the letters "Atlantic Ocean" on maps and [[globe]]s.

'''Barthélémy''': a well-digger who, while at work, found himself traveling through a portal and ending up on the first A island. Although he got to live in a beautiful palace he soon became homesick and sent messages in bottles in an attempt to get rescued from the island. This lasted 40 years before Philémon came across one such message and helped Barthélémy return home. Before long, however, Barthélémy became homesick for the island, and his desperate desire to return was the cause of many of their subsequent adventures.

'''Anatole''': Philémon's pet donkey and best friend.

'''Félicien''': Philémon's uncle whose studies of magic enable him to send Barthélémy and Philémon to and from the magical lands. No method of travel can be used twice, so Félicien's methods vary from a [[zipper]] hidden in the ground to a magical barrel of water. This constant travel does cause disturbances in the fabric of reality, causing Félicien problems with the islands' authorities.

'''Hector''': Philémon's father, who refuses to believe his son's stories and maintains his disbelief in the fantasy islands, even when he happens to go there himself (see "Le Voyage de l’incrédule" (French for "The Sceptic's Journey")).

==Film Adaptation==
In a 2013 article for Variety, Max Films announced plans to adapt Philémon into an English-language, live-action film, directed by Julien Demers-Arsenault and Sebastien Denault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=French comicbook character Philemon to film|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/french-comicbook-character-philemon-to-film-1118065024/|website=Variety.com|publisher=Variety|date=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1504">In '''''S v Counter''''', an important case in South African criminal law, the appellant had shot the deceased, lodging a bullet in her buttock. Unbeknownst either to her or to her doctors, the bullet had penetrated her anal canal, causing virulent septicaemia and leading to the pneumonia from which she died two weeks later. It fell to the Supreme Court of Appeal to decide whether it was the shot fired or rather medical negligence which had caused the death:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The sequence of events from the time of the deceased's admission [to hospital] until her death was not interrupted by any causal factor which affected or changed the natural order of events, more particularly there was no intervention or omission by the persons responsible for her care [...]. It is inconceivable in these circumstances that the appellant should not be held responsible for the consequences of his actions, which led directly to his wife's death by stages entirely predictable and in accordance with human experience.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There was, in other words, no ''novus actus interveniens'' which could exclude the liability of the accused. He was accordingly found guilty.

In many historical societies, the position of [[kingship]] carries a [[Sacred|sacral]] meaning, that is, it is identical with that of a [[high priest]] and [[judge]]. The concept of [[theocracy]] is related, although a '''sacred king''' need not necessarily rule through his religious authority; rather, the temporal position has a religious significance.

== History ==
[[Sir James George Frazer]] identified - or invented - the concept of the sacred king in his study ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890–1915), the title of which refers to the myth of the [[Rex Nemorensis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= http://www.bartleby.com/196/|title= The Golden Bough|last= Frazer|first= James George, Sir|publisher= New York: The Macmillan Co|year= 1922|isbn= |location= Bartleby.com|pages= |at= http://www.bartleby.com/196/1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frazer gives numerous examples, cited below, and was an inspiration for the [[myth and ritual school]].&lt;ref&gt;R Fraser ed., ''The Golden Bough'' (Oxford 2009) p. 651&lt;/ref&gt; However, "the [[myth and ritual]], or myth-ritualist, theory" is disputed;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Myth: A Very Short Introduction|last= Segal|first= Robert A.|publisher= Oxford UP|year= 2004|isbn= |location= Oxford|pages= 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; many scholars now believe that myth and ritual share common [[paradigms]], but not that one developed from the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Poetics of Myth|last= Meletinsky|first= Eleazar Moiseevich|publisher= Routledge|year= 2000|isbn= 0-415-92898-2|location= |pages= 117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Frazer, the notion has [[prehistoric religion|prehistoric roots]] and occurs worldwide, on [[Java]] as in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], with [[shaman]]-kings credited with [[Rainmaking (ritual)|rainmaking]] and assuring [[Fertile (disambiguation) | fertility]] and good fortune. The king might also be designated to suffer and atone for his people, meaning that the sacral king could be the pre-ordained victim in a [[human sacrifice]], either killed at the end of his term in the position, or sacrificed in a time of crisis (e.g. the [[Blót]] of [[Domalde]]).

The [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] flogged a newly-selected king (''[[Ashantehene]]'') before [[enthronement|enthroning]] him.

From the [[Ancient Near Eastern religion|Bronze Age in the Near East]], the enthronement and [[anointment]] of a [[Monarchy|monarch]] is a central religious ritual, reflected in the titles "[[Messiah]]" or "[[Christ]]", which became separated from worldly kingship. Thus [[Sargon of Akkad]] described himself as "deputy of [[Ishtar]]",{{cn|date=August 2017}} just as the modern [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Pope]] takes the role of the "[[Vicar of Christ]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Vicar of Christ|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kings are styled as [[shepherd]]s from earliest times, e.g., the term applied to [[Ensí|Sumerian princes]] such as [[Lugalbanda]] in the 3rd millennium BCE. The image of the shepherd combines the themes of [[leadership]] and the responsibility to supply food and protection, as well as superiority.

As the mediator between the people and the divine, the sacral king was credited with special wisdom (e.g. [[Solomon]] or [[Gilgamesh]]) or vision (e.g. via [[oneiromancy]]).

== Study ==
Study of the concept was introduced by [[Sir James George Frazer]] in his influential book ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890–1915); sacral kingship plays a role in [[Romanticism]] and [[Esotericism]] (e.g. [[Julius Evola]]) and some currents of [[Neopaganism]] ([[Theodism]]).
The school of [[Pan-Babylonianism]] derived much of the religion described in the [[Hebrew Bible]] from cults of sacral kingship in ancient [[Babylonia]].

The so-called British and Scandinavian cult-historical schools maintained that the king personified a god and stood at the center of the national or tribal religion. The English "myth and ritual school" concentrated on anthropology and folklore, while the Scandinavian "Uppsala school" emphasized Semitological study.

=== Frazer's interpretation ===
A sacred king, according to the systematic interpretation of [[mythology]] developed by Frazer in ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (published 1890), was a [[monarch|king]] who represented a [[solar deity]] in a periodically re-enacted [[fertility rite]]. Frazer seized upon the notion of a substitute king and made him the keystone of his theory of a universal, pan-[[Europe]]an, and indeed worldwide fertility myth, in which a consort for the [[Goddess]] was annually replaced. According to Frazer, the sacred king represented the spirit of vegetation, a divine [[John Barleycorn]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} He came into being in the spring, reigned during the summer, and ritually died at harvest time, only to be reborn at the [[winter solstice]] to wax and rule again. The spirit of vegetation was therefore a "[[Life-death-rebirth deity|dying and reviving god]]". [[Osiris]], [[Adonis]], [[Dionysus]], [[Attis]] and many other familiar figures from [[Greek mythology]] and [[classical antiquity]] were re-interpreted in this mold. The sacred king, the human embodiment of the dying and reviving vegetation god, was supposed to have originally been an individual chosen to rule for a time, but whose fate was to suffer as a [[sacrifice]], to be offered back to the earth so that a new king could rule for a time in his stead.

Especially in Europe during Frazer's early twentieth century heyday, it launched a [[cottage industry]] of amateurs looking for "[[paganism|pagan]] survivals" in such things as traditional [[fair]]s, [[maypole]]s, and folk arts like [[Morris dance|morris dancing]]. It was widely influential in [[literature]], being alluded to by [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[James Joyce]], [[Ezra Pound]], and in [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]'', among other works.

[[Robert Graves]] used Frazer's work in ''The Greek Myths'' and made it one of the foundations of his own personal mythology in ''[[The White Goddess]]'', and in the fictional ''[[Seven Days in New Crete]]'' he depicted a future in which the institution of a sacrificial sacred King is revived. [[Margaret Murray]], the principal theorist of [[witchcraft]] as a "pagan survival," used Frazer's work to propose the thesis that many [[Kings of England]] who died as kings, most notably [[William II of England|William Rufus]], were secret pagans and [[witch]]es, whose deaths were the re-enactment of the [[human sacrifice]] that stood at the centre of Frazer's myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Divine King in England: a study in anthropology|last=Murray|first=Margaret Alice|publisher=London, Faber &amp; Faber|year=1954|isbn=9780404184285|location=British Library|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An idea used by [[fantasy writer]] [[Katherine Kurtz]] in her novel ''Lammas Night''.

== In fiction ==
Many of [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]'s novels are recognized as being directly influenced by Frazer, depicting individuals accepting the burden of leadership and the ultimate responsibility of personal sacrifice, including [[Sword at Sunset]], [[The Mark of the Horse Lord]], and [[Sun Horse, Moon Horse]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.HistoricalNovels.info/Rosemary-Sutcliff.html Article about Rosemary Sutcliff at the Historical Novels Info website; paragraph 15]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8403">Many [[Protocol (computing)|protocols]] and [[algorithms]] require the serialization or enumeration of related entities.  For example, a [[communication protocol]] must know whether some packet comes "before" or "after" some other packet. The [[IETF]] ([[Internet Engineering Task Force]]) {{IETF RFC|1982}} attempts to define "Serial Number Arithmetic" for the purposes of manipulating and comparing these [[sequence number]]s.

This task is rather more complex than it might first appear, because most algorithms use fixed size ([[Binary numeral system|binary]]) representations for sequence numbers. It is often important for the algorithm not to "break down" when the numbers become so large that they are incremented one last time and "wrap" around their maximum numeric ranges (go instantly from a large positive number to 0, or a large negative number). Unfortunately, some protocols choose to ignore these issues, and simply use very large integers for their counters, in the hope that the program will be replaced (or they will retire), before the problem occurs (see [[Y2K]]).

Many communication protocols apply serial number arithmetic to packet sequence numbers in their implementation of a [[sliding window protocol]]. Some versions of TCP use [[Transmission Control Protocol#TCP timestamps | protection against wrapped sequence numbers (PAWS)]]. PAWS applies the same serial number arithmetic to packet timestamps, using the timestamp as an extension of the high-order bits of the sequence number.&lt;ref&gt;
{{IETF RFC|1323}}: "TCP Extensions for High Performance"
4.2
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations on sequence numbers==

Only addition of a small positive [[integer]] to a sequence number, and comparison of two sequence numbers are discussed.
Only unsigned binary implementations are discussed, with an arbitrary size in bits noted throughout the RFC (and below) as "SERIAL_BITS".

===Addition===

Adding an integer to a sequence number is simple unsigned integer addition, followed by unsigned [[Modulo operation]] to bring the result back into range (usually implicit in the unsigned addition, on most architectures.)

    s' = (s + n) modulo (2 ^ SERIAL_BITS)

Addition of a value outside the range

    [0 .. (2 ^(SERIAL_BITS - 1) - 1)]

is undefined.  Basically, adding values beyond this range  will cause the resultant sequence number to "wrap", and (often) result in a number that is considered "less than" the original sequence number!

===Comparison===

A means of comparing two sequence numbers i1 and i2 (the unsigned integer representations of sequence numbers s1 and s2) is presented.

Equality is defined as simple numeric equality.
The algorithm presented for comparison is very complex, having to take into account whether the first sequence number is close to the "end" of its range of values, and thus a smaller "wrapped" number may actually be considered "greater" than the first sequence number.  Thus i1 is considered less than i2, only if:

    (i1 &lt; i2 and i2 - i1 &lt; 2^(SERIAL_BITS - 1)) or
    (i1 &gt; i2 and i1 - i2 &gt; 2^(SERIAL_BITS - 1))

Likewise, i1 is considered greater than i2, only if:

    (i1 &lt; i2 and i2 - i1 &gt; 2^(SERIAL_BITS - 1)) or
    (i1 &gt; i2 and i1 - i2 &lt; 2^(SERIAL_BITS - 1))

==Shortfalls==

The algorithms presented by the RFC have at least one significant shortcoming: 
there are sequence numbers for which comparison is undefined.
Since many algorithms are implemented independently by multiple, independent cooperating parties,
it is often impossible to prevent all such situations from occurring.

The authors of {{IETF RFC|1982}} simply [[wiktionary:Punt#Verb|punt]]:

   While it would be possible to define the test in such a way that the
   inequality would not have this surprising property, while being
   defined for all pairs of values, such a definition would be
   unnecessarily burdensome to implement, and difficult to understand,
   and would still allow cases where
   
        s1 &lt; s2 and (s1 + 1) &gt; (s2 + 1)
   
   which is just as non-intuitive.
   
   Thus the problem case is left undefined, implementations are free to
   return either result, or to flag an error, and users must take care
   not to depend on any particular outcome.  Usually this will mean
   avoiding allowing those particular pairs of numbers to co-exist.

Thus, it is often difficult or impossible to avoid all "undefined" comparisons of sequence numbers.
However, a relatively simple solution is available.  By mapping the unsigned sequence numbers onto signed [[Two's complement]] arithmetic operations, every comparison of any sequence number is defined, and the comparison operation itself is dramatically simplified.  All comparisons specified by the RFC retain their original truth values; only the formerly "undefined" comparisons are affected.

==General solution==

The {{IETF RFC|1982}} algorithm specifies that, for N-bit sequence numbers, there are 2&lt;sup&gt;(N−1)&lt;/sup&gt;−1 values considered "greater than", and 2&lt;sup&gt;(N−1)&lt;/sup&gt;−1 considered "less than".  Comparison against the remaining value (exactly 2&lt;sup&gt;N−1&lt;/sup&gt; distant) is deemed to be "undefined".

Most modern hardware implements signed [[Two's complement]] binary arithmetic operations.
These operations are fully defined for the entire range of values for any operands they are given—since any N-bit binary number can contain 2&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; distinct values, and since one of them is taken up by the value 0, there are an odd number of spots left for all the non-zero positive and negative numbers.
There is simply one more negative number representable than there are positive.
For example, a 16-bit 2's complement value may contain numbers ranging from −32768 to +32767.

So, if we simply re-cast sequence numbers as 2's complement integers, and allow there to be one more sequence number considered "less than" than there are sequence numbers considered "greater than", we should be able to use simple signed arithmetic comparisons instead of the logically incomplete formula proposed by the RFC.

Here are some examples (in 16 bits, again), comparing some random sequence numbers, against the sequence number with the value 0.

    unsigned      binary      signed
    sequence      value       distance
    --------      ------      --------
       32767   == 0x7fff ==   32767
           1   == 0x0001 ==       1
           0   == 0x0000 ==       0
       65535   == 0xffff ==      −1 
       65534   == 0xfffe ==      −2
       32768   == 0x8000 ==  −32768

It is easy to see that the signed interpretation of the sequence numbers are in the correct order, so long as we "rotate" the sequence number in question so that its 0 matches up with the sequence number we are comparing it against.  It turns out that this is simply done, using an unsigned subtraction, and simply interpreting the result as a signed two's complement number.  The result is the signed "distance" between the two sequence numbers.  Once again, if i1 and i2 are the unsigned binary representations of the sequence numbers s1 and s2, the distance from s1 to s2 is:

    distance = (signed)( i1 - i2 )

If distance is 0, the numbers are equal.  If it is &lt; 0, then s1 is "less than" or "before" s2.
Simple, clean and efficient, and fully defined.  However, not without surprises.

All sequence number arithmetic must deal with "wrapping" of sequence numbers; the number 2&lt;sup&gt;N−1&lt;/sup&gt; is equidistant in both directions, in {{IETF RFC|1982}} sequence number terms.  In our math, they are both considered to be "less than" each other:

    distance1 = (signed)(0x8000 - 0x0)    = (signed)0x8000 = -32768 &lt; 0
    distance2 = (signed)(0x0    - 0x8000) = (signed)0x8000 = -32768 &lt; 0

This is obviously true for any two sequence numbers with distance of 0x8000 between them.

Furthermore, implementing serial number arithmetic using two's complement arithmetic implies serial numbers of a bit-length matching the machine's integer sizes; usually 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit.   Implementing 20-bit serial numbers needs shifts (assuming 32-bit ints):

    distance = (signed)((i1 &lt;&lt; 12) - (i2 &lt;&lt; 12))

See the unit test cases in the example C++ implementation below for more examples.

'''Street press''' is a type of publishing, between [[zine]]s and [[magazine]]s/[[newspaper]]s in terms of distribution, content and audience.  They are particularly prolific in [[Australia]], although there are also some examples from [[Europe]] and [[North America]].{{Fact|date=September 2008}}. 

Street press publications are usually available free to the reader. They are distributed by being made available to passers-by at locations such as restaurants, cafes, bars, clubs, live music venues, community centres and record stores.

To financially support themselves, street press publications usually take on more [[advertisement]]s and sponsorship than other forms of media. Most street press publications are printed on low-quality [[newspaper stock]] to reduce costs. Some of the bigger publications print their covers and first few pages in colour, a rarer few use glossy paper for their cover. Virtually none of them print more than a couple of pages in colour. The size varies widely, some are printed in [[broadsheet]] format, some in [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] format, and some in [[magazine]]-sized format.  Non-standard paper sizes are also common, especially in the more obscure publications. 

Street press publications are usually also more professional in appearance and composition than zines, with established business structures and relatively mainstream content. Street press publications tend to have more mainstream, broad-appeal subject matter than zines so they can attract sponsors, and increase readership.

Street press publications can cover a wide variety of topics, many are focused upon specific subject matter of a target audience. Common topics include culture or entertainment topics, such [[independent music|independent]] or [[alternative music]].  Other niche publications might involve political [[satire]], [[Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures|gay and/or lesbian]] issues, and [[film]]. 

[[Weekly newspaper|Community newspapers]], delivered to households, usually weekly, which consist primarily of localised news, do not fall into this category. Such newspapers often resemble conventional newspapers focused on local content.  In addition, street press usually covers only a specific area of interest, whereas community newspapers might cover a wide variety of topics.

'''ThaiURL''' (Thai Uniform Resource Locator) is a technology enabling the use of Thai domain names in applications that have been modified to support this technology. It is one of several such systems that were marketed before the advent of [[IDNA]].

Traditionally, the Domain Name System ([[Domain name system|DNS]]), does not allow domain names with Thai characters. The only characters allowed in DNS names, as specified in RFC 1034 “Domain names - concepts and facilities” and RFC 1035 “Domain names - implementation and specification”, are

# Letter: “a” through “z” (case insensitive)
# Digit: “0” through “9”
# Hyphen (-)

The ThaiURL domain naming standard is based on Thai characters and symbols as specified in [[TIS 620]]-2533: Standard for Thai Character Codes for Computers. Since these are non-ASCII characters, [[Row-based ASCII Compatible Encoding]] is used.&lt;ref name="how12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaiurl.com/12/howto.htm|title=ThaiURL - How does ThaiURL Work?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The encoding process is as follows:

# Begin with a Thai domain name as input:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;ชื่อไทย.คอม&lt;/code&gt;
# Convert the Thai characters into their [[Unicode]] code points in [[hexadecimal]]:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;0e0a 0e37 0e48 0e2d 0e44 0e17 0e22 . 0e04 0e2d 0e21&lt;/code&gt; (spaces are added here to show individual code points)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;0e0a0e370e480e2d0e440e170e22.0e040e2d0e21&lt;/code&gt; (actual hex string)
# Convert the hex characters to binary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;0000 1110 0000 1010 0011 0111 0100 1000 0010 1101 0100 0100 0001 0111 0010 0010 . 0000 1110 0000 0100 0010 1101 0010 0001&lt;/code&gt; (spaces added to show individual hex characters)
# Perform a [[Base32]] conversion:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;00001 11000 00101 00011 01110 10010 00001 01101 01000 10000 01011 10010 00100 . 00001 11000 00010 00010 11010 01000 01000&lt;/code&gt; (binary representation)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;byfdosbniqlse.bycc2ii&lt;/code&gt; (ASCII representation)
# Append TLD:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;byfdosbniqlse.bycc2ii.net&lt;/code&gt;

This kind of URL encoding is not a national standard, but rather a system used by the domain name registrar ThaiURL.com. It is one of many localized naming schemes that predate standardisation of [[Internationalized domain name]]s (IDNA); at the moment the two systems appear to coexist. The [[Country code top-level domain|ccTLD]] name registrar for ''[[.th]]'', [http://www.thnic.net thnic.net], supports IDNA; ThaiURL registers .com names.

However, because this is not an ICANN-sanctioned IDN encoding method, support is limited. Most browsers will use still default to [[punycode]] for encoding Thai domain names, so the only way to reach ThaiURL-registered domains is by typing in or linking to the ASCII-encoded domain name.

[[File:TheTimesAtlas.jpg|thumb|First (1895) edition]]
'''''The Times Atlas of the World''''', rebranded '''''The Times Atlas of the World: Comprehensive Edition''''' in its 11th edition and '''''The Times Comprehensive Atlas of the World''''' from its 12th edition, is a [[world atlas]] currently published by [[HarperCollins|HarperCollins Publisher L.L.C]]. Its most recent edition, the fourteenth, was published on 25 September  2014.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/20/times-atlas-incorrect-greenland Times Atlas publishers apologise for 'incorrect' Greenland ice statement]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==

===First generation===
The first version of ''The Times Atlas of the World'' appeared as ''The Times Atlas'' in 1895; more printings followed up to 1900. It was published at the office of ''[[The Times]]'' [[newspaper]] in London, and contained 117 pages of maps with an alphabetical index of 130,000 names.  The atlas was a reprint of Cassell &amp; Co.’s ''Universal Atlas'', published in 1893.  Cassell's atlas, in turn, used maps in English printed in Leipzig which were drawn from the second edition (with some maps of the third edition) of the German ''[[Andrees Allgemeiner Handatlas]]'' from the publisher Velhagen &amp; Klasing.&lt;ref name="pp1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Espenhorst|first1=Jürgen|title=Petermann's Planet, vol. 1|pages=610-613|date=2003|publisher=Pangaea Verlag|isbn=978-3-930401-35-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second generation===
The second generation of the atlas was issued in 1920 as ''The Times Survey Atlas of the World'' and was prepared at the [[John Bartholomew and Son Ltd.|Edinburgh Geographical Institute]] under the direction of [[John George Bartholomew]]. It contained 112 double page maps with 200,000 names, and measured 47 cm &amp;times; 33 cm.

===Third generation===
The third generation, based on the second, was Bartholomew's famous five-volume set of 19"&amp;times;12" elephant folio atlases with 120 plates in eight colors, most maps being double page, and over 200,000 names. The set was issued from 1955–59 as ''The Times Atlas of the World. Mid-Century Edition'' by The Times Publishing Company Ltd. in London,  (Volume One: The World, Australasia &amp; East Asia. Volume Two: South-West Asia &amp; Russia. Volume Three: Northern Europe. Volume Four: Southern Europe &amp; Africa. Volume Five: The Americas; however, volumes III-V were in fact published first.)  A July, 1957 advertisement for The Americas volume suggested that the maps included the latest places of note: "the St. Lawrence Seaway, the newest Federal and Interstate highway systems, ... rocket-launching sites and Atomic Energy installations."

In 1967, an edition in one volume (in which the maps were printed back-to-back – some on a fractionally smaller scale) was published as ''The Times Atlas of the World. Comprehensive Edition'' (with 123 leaves of maps in the 9th edition of 1992). This edition also appeared in a German, a Dutch and a French translation. Its introduction reads:  "The successor to [the Mid-Century Edition] in one volume, nevertheless, this work contains greater detail, as well as considerable additional material, with no loss of scale, this being achieved by printing on both sides of the paper, using narrower margins, and including a single index. Some revisions and improvements were made; endpaper keys show which parts of the world are covered by which plates; an international glossary gives the English equivalents of common name-words. Some discoveries by satellite surveys were included."

===Fourth generation===
The 10th or "Millennium" edition (1999) of the 1967 Comprehensive Edition is in effect the first representative of the fourth generation. In contrast to its predecessors, it is completely produced by means of computer-cartography: ''The Times Comprehensive Atlas of the World'', published by Times Books in London (124 leaves of maps). Contents are slightly different in scale, or in arrangement.

==== 10th edition (1999) ====

==== 11th edition (2003) ====
This edition was also offered, bound in half-leather, by the [[Folio Society]].

==== 12th edition (2007) ====
Changes to previous editions include "an estimated 20,000 mapping updates including 3,500 changes to names, a brand new map of Alaska and NW Canada, abandoned settlements featured for the first time, new satellite images of the continents, revision of all national and socio-economic statistics and new coverage on Biodiversity and the Environment … The division of Serbia and Montenegro into separate countries.
The new national capital of Myanmar called Nay Pyi Taw, a joint capital with Yangon (Rangoon). Secession of St-Barthelemy and St-Martin from Guadeloupe. New World Heritage Sites. Opening of the 1118 km Golmud to Lhasa railway in China, the highest railway in the world. Opening of the 32.5 km cross sea Donghai bridge, in China, linking Shanghai to the deepwater port on Xiaoyang Shan island."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesatlas.com/Heritage/Pages/Home.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423130724/http://www.timesatlas.com/Heritage/Pages/Home.aspx |archivedate=23 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Luxury Edition was also offered from 2008, bound by Book Works Studio in London.

==== 13th edition (2011) ====

The map of Greenland depicted 15% less ice cover than in the 1999 edition. A number of glaciologists and climate scientists contested the claim.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14983410&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/20/times-atlas-incorrect-greenland&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers from the [[Scott Polar Research Institute]] wrote: "A sizable portion of the area mapped as ice-free in the Atlas is clearly still ice-covered. There is to our knowledge no support for this claim in the published scientific literature. It's a really bad mapping error."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/09/updated-atlas-shrugged-outraged-glaciologists-say-mappers-misrepresented-greenland-ice|title=UPDATED: Atlas Shrugged?

==== 14th edition (2014) ====

Changes to the new edition include "5000 place name changes, most notably in Japan, Brazil, South Korea, Taiwan and Spain. Updated national parks and conserved areas including the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA TFCA), the largest conservation zone in the world. Addition of over 50 major waterfalls around the world."&lt;ref name="resources.collins.co.uk"&gt;http://resources.collins.co.uk/Website%20images/TimesAtlas/PDF-BLAD.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; {{sic}} Geopolitical changes include "Realignment of a section of the international boundary between Burkina Faso and Niger resulting from the International Court of Justice decision. New administrative structures in Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya and Madagascar, and the addition of the long proposed new Indian state of Telangana. Updated population of Brazilian towns from new census information. Disputed boundary around Crimea."&lt;ref name="resources.collins.co.uk"/&gt;
New features include "New maps of the sub-ice features in the Antarctic and Arctic Ocean. Physical maps of all the continents showing land features which offer a useful counterpoint to political mapping. Illustrated articles on Biodiversity and Climate Change. The Power of Maps – this new section illustrates the influence maps have had on all our lives."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesatlas.com/category/The+Comprehensive+Atlas&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Visha Kanya''''' ([[Sanskrit]] {{lang|sa| विष कन्या}}; {{lang-en|Poison girl}}) were young women reportedly used as [[assassins]], often against powerful enemies, during the times of the [[Ancient India]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jpXijlqeRpIC|title=India's Historic Battles: From Alexander the Great to Kargil|last=Roy|first=Kaushik|date=2004-01-01|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=9788178241098|page=24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their blood and bodily fluids were purportedly poisonous to other humans, as was mentioned in the ancient Indian treatise on [[public policy|statecraft]], ''[[Arthashastra]]'', written by [[Chanakya]], an adviser and a prime minister to the first Maurya Emperor [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]] (c. 340–293 BCE).&lt;ref name="Chaurasia2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Radhey Shyam Chaurasia|title=History of ancient India: earliest times to 1000 A.D.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cWmsQQ2smXIC&amp;pg=PA100|accessdate=20 June 2011|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist|isbn=978-81-269-0027-5|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
A [[Hindu mythology]] text, the ''[[Kalki Purana]]'', mentions that they can kill a person just by looking at them, and talks about a Visha Kanya named Sulochana, the wife of a [[Gandharva]], Chitragreeva.&lt;ref name="Chaturvedi2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=B.K. Chaturvedi|title=Kalki Purana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yjPXRCCUvk4C&amp;pg=PA74|accessdate=20 June 2011|year=2004|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books (P) Ltd.|isbn=978-81-288-0588-2|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in time, "poison damsel" passed into [[folklore]], became an [[archetype]] explored by many writers, resulting in a popular [[literary character]] that appears in many works, including classical [[Sanskrit]] texts such as ''[[Sukasaptati]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Erotic Indian tales from the Sanskrit classic Suksaptati'', by G.L. Mathur. Hind Pocket Books, 1971. ''Page 26–27''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Poison Damsel (Sanskrit Viṣakanyā) is a literary figure that appears in Sanskrit literature as a type of assassin used by kings to destroy enemies. The story goes that young girls were raised on a carefully crafted diet of [[poison]] and antidote from a very young age, a practice referred to as [[mithridatism]]. Although many would not survive, those that did were immune to other poisons and their [[body fluid]]s would be poisonous to others; sexual contact would thus be lethal to other humans. There also exists a myth that says a Visha Kanya can cause instant death with just a touch.

According to Kaushik Roy, Visha Kanyas would kill their targets by seducing them and giving them poisoned alcohol.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some Sanskrit sources narrate that a ''Visha Kanya'' was sent by [[Mahapadma Nanda|Nanda]]'s minister Amatyarakshasa to kill [[Chandragupta Maurya]] and Chanakya diverted them to kill Parvatak.&lt;ref name="PenzerBhatta1980"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Norman Mosley Penzer|author2=Somadeva Bhatta|title=Poison-damsels: Folklore of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWEhbry3WBUC&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=20 June 2011|date=November 1980|publisher=Ayer Publishing|isbn=978-0-405-13336-7|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thakur1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Molu Ram Thakur|title=Myths, rituals, and beliefs in Himachal Pradesh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JH-gI4ncuZ4C&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=20 June 2011|year=1997|publisher=Indus Publishing|isbn=978-81-7387-071-2|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary treatments of the theme ==

''Visha Kanya'' has been a popular theme in [[Indian literature]] and [[folklore]], and apart from appearing in classical [[Sanskrit]] texts, it has appeared repeatedly in various works like ''Vishkanya'' by [[Shivani]] and ''Ek Aur Vish Kanya?'' by Om Prakash Sharma, who use ''Visha Kanya'' as an [[archetype]] in their stories—a beautiful girl who kills when she comes too close. More recently, the archetype has taken a new hue in the HIV/AIDS era, for example in ''Vishkanya'', a 2007 novel, based on the [[AIDS]] epidemic in society. ''Vishakanya''s have also been depicted as important characters in the book ''[[Chanakya's Chant]]''. In 2009, Vibha Rahi, a lower caste woman has written an autobiography 'Vishkanya: Untold Secrets' in Marathi, in which she portrays how upper caste women make intimate relationships with lower caste people of high profile and destroy their families and social relationships.&lt;ref name="Vibha Rahi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rahi|first=Vibha|title=Vishkanya: Untold Secrets|year=2009|publisher=Karuvaki Prakashan|location=Pune}}&lt;/ref&gt;        
 
Over the years, many Hindi films have been made on the subject. The first film, ''Visha Kanya'', was made in 1943, starring [[Leela Mishra]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0376308/ Vish Kanya (1943)] [[IMDB]].&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently, [[Vishkanya (1991)|''Vishkanya'' (1991)]], starring [[Pooja Bedi]] in the lead role.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318812/ Vishkanya (1991)] [[IMDB]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vishkanya Ek Anokhi Prem Kahani]] is a [[soap opera]] TV series which aired on [[Zee TV]]; it starred [[Aishwarya Khare]] as Aparajita Ghosh, a Visha Kanya, in the main role.

In ''The Real Life of Sebastian Knight'' the author Nabokov treats his affair with Irina Guadanini through allusions to the myth of the poison damsel. In the 2015 novel, ''The Entropy of Bones'' by [[Ayize Jama-Everett]], the main character fights a group of ''Visha Kanya''.  The trope also appears in a set of Nathaniel Hawthorne's stories.

'''Young v New Bay Holdings Ltd''' (1998) 3 NZ ConvC 192,808 is a cited case in [[New Zealand]] regarding satisfying the element of detriment required under [[promissory estoppel]].&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond| publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Young purchased a lease of a licensed restaurant owned by New Bay Holdings Ltd for $90,000, with the lease giving Young 2 rights of renewal. He also spent a further $108,000 refurbishing the restaurant.

However, when it came time to renew the lease, NBH refused to renew the lease.

As a result, Young notified NBH's solicitors  that he was going to apply to the court for relief under section 120 of the Property Law Act [1952], whereupon the solicitors advised them not to commence legal action until they had received instructions from their client.

Young resiled from filing for relief from the court, until many months later when NBH said that they could not apply for relief any longer, due to the fact that section 121 requires an application to the court within 3 months of the landlord's refusal.

Young applied for relief under promissory estoppel.

==Held==
The judge ruled that promissory estoppel applied here, and granted a renewal of the lease. Randerson J said this was a "straightforward application of the principles of promissory estoppel".
