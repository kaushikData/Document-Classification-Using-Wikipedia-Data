      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9103">In  [[Zoroastrianism]],  '''101 names of God''' ([[Pazand]] ''Sad-o-yak nam-i-khoda'') is a list of [[names of God]] ([[Ahura Mazda]]).

'''Ardaxshir''' (vars: Ardaxsher, Ardashir, Artashtra) was a [[Frataraka]] ruler in [[Persis]] (Persia 3rd-2nd century BC ) .

A Local ruler of Persia "Frataraka" and subsequent series, as Ardaxhsir 1, ruled Persis as Frataraka by 3rd century BC.

Ardaxshir's history is disputed, over origin, date and sequence of him as ruler. Mainstream School (Alram and Wiesehofer) propose a dating of 2nd BC. Scholars such as Museler, Hoover, Sarkhosh Curtis, Engels and recently Ahrabi all opt for the 3rd century BC. Hoover believes he was first ruler of Frataraka as there was an undertype in Vahbarz coin indicating he came before Vahbarz. Undertype on bagdates coin, indicate that he was the first Frataraka ruler. Generally his coins were found in Persis and along with [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus I]] and other Frataraka coins.

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] teaches that the world should adopt an [[international auxiliary language]], which people would use in addition to their mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;For an annotated compilation of excerpts from the Bahá'í writings regarding the principle of International or Universal Auxiliary Language, see "The Greatest Instrument for Promoting Harmony and Civilization: Excerpts from the Bahá'í Writings and Related Sources on the Question of an International Auxiliary Language." Oxford: George Ronald Publisher. 2015. {{ISBN|978-085398-591-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of this teaching is to improve communication and foster unity among peoples and nations.  The Bahá'í teachings state, however, that the international auxiliary language should not suppress existing natural languages, and that the concept of [[unity in diversity]] must be applied to preserve cultural distinctions.

The teachings of the Bahá'í Faith have a strong focus on the [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity|unity of humankind]].&lt;ref name="Meyjes27"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyjes|2006|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahá'í teachings see improved [[communication]] between peoples throughout the world as a vital part of world unity and [[peace]].&lt;ref name="PSmith"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bahá'í teachings]] see the current multiplicity of languages as a major impediment to unity, since the existence of so many languages cuts the free flow of information and makes it difficult for the average individual to obtain a universal perspective on world events.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;

The principle of the selection and institutionalization of a Universal/International Auxiliary Language is among the [[Bahá'í Faith]]'s key tenets.&lt;ref name="Meyjes"&gt;{{Harvnb| Meyjes|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, writing in the [[Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas#Ishráqát (Splendours)|Tablets of Ishráqát]] and [[Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas#Lawḥ-i-Maqṣúd (Tablet of Maqṣúd)|Maqṣúd]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bahá'u'lláh|1873-92|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B165"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bahá'u'lláh|1873-92|pp=165–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; taught that the lack of a common language is a major barrier to world unity since the lack of communication between peoples of different languages undermines efforts toward world peace due to misunderstandings of language; he urged that humanity should choose an auxiliary language that would be taught in schools in addition to one's own native language, so that people could understand one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stockman|2000|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that until an auxiliary language is adopted, complete unity between the various parts of the world would continue to be unrealized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Esslemont|1980|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, called the promotion of the principle of the international auxiliary language "the very first service to the world of man" and its realization as "the greatest achievement of the age in conferring profit and pleasure on mankind."&lt;ref name="Meyjes29"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyjes|2006|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'u'lláh stressed, however, that the auxiliary [[language]] should not suppress existing natural languages, and that the concept of ''unity in diversity'' must be applied to languages.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hatcher|Martin|1998|pp=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahá'í teachings state that cultural heterogeneity is compatible with unity, and that the Bahá'í teaching of unity requires the embracing of [[cultural diversity]] since humanity is enriched by the various cultures throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Meyjes27"/&gt; The Bahá'í teachings state that having an international auxiliary language would remove the pressure from the natural aggrandizement of majority language groups and thus preserve minority languages, since each person would keep their own mother-tongue, and thus minority cultures.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;

==Choice of language==
Neither [[Bahá'í literature]], nor any of the various [[Bahá'í administration|Bahá'í authorities]], have specified which language should be used as global auxiliary. The Bahá'í writings state that any natural or constructed language may be selected. The predominant language of the time is not necessarily to be used as the auxiliary language by default.&lt;ref name="Meyjes31"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyjes|2006|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bahá'í writings stipulate that the auxiliary language is to be selected or invented by the world's [[government|parliaments]] and rulers,&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt; thus placing the choice of language in the hands of language planners.&lt;ref name="Meyjes31"/&gt; Bahá'u'lláh states that a "world language will either be invented or chosen from among existing languages" and:  
{{quote|It is incumbent upon all nations to appoint some men of understanding and erudition to convene a gathering and through joint consultation choose one language from among the varied existing languages, or create a new one, to be taught to the children in all the schools of the world.&lt;ref name="B165"/&gt;}}
Various Bahá'í leaders have made various comments to certain languages and qualities. `Abdu'l-Bahá and [[Shoghi Effendi]] made occasional comments favorable to the notion that potential auxiliary languages be simple and easy to learn.&lt;ref name="Meyjes30"/&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá also praised the ideal of [[Esperanto]], a constructed language, and there was an affinity between Esperantists and Bahá'ís during the late 19th century and early 20th century.&lt;ref name="CEBF_esperanto"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter | authorlink= Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Esperanto |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; While `Abdu'l-Bahá encouraged people to learn Esperanto, he never stated that it should become the auxiliary language.&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt; 

On February 12, 1913, `Abdu'l-Bahá gave a talk to the Paris Esperanto Society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, praise be to God that Dr. Zamenhof has invented the Esperanto language. It has all the potential qualities of becoming the international means of communication. All of us must be grateful and thankful to him for this noble effort; for in this way he has served his fellowmen well. With untiring effort and self-sacrifice on the part of its devotees Esperanto will become universal. Therefore every one of us must study this language and spread it as far as possible so that day by day it may receive a broader recognition, be accepted by all nations and governments of the world, and become a part of the curriculum in all the public schools. I hope that Esperanto will be adopted as the language of all the future international conferences and congresses, so that all people need acquire only two languages—one their own tongue and the other the international language. Then perfect union will be established between all the people of the world. Consider how difficult it is today to communicate with various nations. If one studies fifty languages one may yet travel through a country and not know the language. Therefore I hope that you will make the utmost effort, so that this language of Esperanto may be widely spread.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also both Shoghi Effendi and the [[Universal House of Justice]], the governing body of the Bahá'ís, emphasized that there is no official Bahá'í endorsement of Esperanto as the international auxiliary language.&lt;ref name="CEBF_esperanto"/&gt; Today there exists an active sub-community of Bahá'í Esperantists; the [[Bahá'í Esperanto-League]] was founded in 1973, and [[Lidia Zamenhof]], daughter of Esperanto creator [[L. L. Zamenhof]], was a Bahá'í.&lt;ref name="CEBF_esperanto"/&gt;  [[Ehsan Yarshater]], the founding editor of ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'', notes how as a child in Iran he learned Esperanto and that when his mother was visiting Haifa on a [[Bahá'í pilgrimage]] he wrote her a letter in Persian as well as Esperanto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.payvand.com/news/12/aug/1166.html |title= Interview with Professor Ehsan Yarshater, the Founder and Editor of Encyclopedia Iranica |last= |first= |date= March 25, 2016 |website= Payvand News |publisher= |access-date= May 22, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   At the request of 'Abdu’l-Baha, [[Agnes Baldwin Alexander]] became an early advocate of Esperanto and used it to spread the Bahá’í teachings at meetings and conferences in Japan.  [[James Ferdinand Morton, Jr.]], an early member of the [[Bahá'í Faith in Greater Boston]], was vice-president of the [[Esperanto League for North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Katz | first = Esther

The selection of the existing language or the [[constructed language|creation of a new one]] each have their advantages; the selection of an existing language allows for a certain portion of the world's population to have already learnt it, but using an invented language would presumably have the advantage of being emotionally neutral.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;

==Mother tongue and unity in diversity==

The Bahá'í teachings on an auxiliary international language does not in itself threaten living languages or cultures; they do not call for cultural uniformity.&lt;ref name="Meyjes27"/&gt; Instead, the Bahá'í teachings value and promote cultural diversity by stating that there should be ''unity in diversity''.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; The term "auxiliary" in Bahá'í scripture means that the international language will be taught in addition to [[first language]]s and that it will be secondary to those.&lt;ref name="Meyjes30"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyjes|2006|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the auxiliary language is meant for community-external, inter-community communication, it is functionally separate from one's primary language. While secondary to the primary language of one's culture, it establishes reliable communication between members of differing primary speech communities.&lt;ref name="Meyjes30"/&gt;

The Bahá'í teachings see [[minority group]] members as full members of the broader society, and thus see the need for unique [[cultural rights]].&lt;ref name="Meyjes28"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyjes|2006|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language is strongly attached to culture. In Bahá'í literature, one's mother tongue is described as "the most profound characteristic of a people", "the garment of the spirit of the people", the "native air which we need for living and dying, which surrounds us from cradle to grave, which is and remains our most personal property."&lt;ref name="Meyjes28"/&gt; Whereas both cultural and linguistic change are normal and ever-greater world unity expected, the precipitous extinction of non-dominant languages and cultures is therefore undesirable. Since the Bahá'í teachings on oneness of humankind emphasize the value of both diversity and unity in the sense of harmony rather than simple sameness, minority cultural rights can be seen as a matter of cultural justice, and language rights a subset of those cultural rights.&lt;ref name="Meyjes28"/&gt;

The '''Bornless Ritual''', also known as the Preliminary Invocation of the Goetia, or the Invocation of the Heart Girt with a Serpent, is often considered the proper preliminary [[invocation]] to the ''[[Ars Goetia]]'' since it was introduced as such by [[Aleister Crowley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Originally, [[grimoire]] [[Magick (Aleister Crowley)|magick]] did not include this particular [[ritual]] but routinely advised the magician (or "[[exorcist]]") to have a close bond to the [[heaven]]ly powers before he meddle with [[demon]]s (e.g. the Book of Abramelin, the Keys of Solomon, etc.).{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} As [[Stephen Skinner (author)|Stephen Skinner]] says, "The Bornless One" is nowhere mentioned, for instance, in his recent translation of the Goetia of Dr. Rudd, as the ritual is of Greaco/Egyptian origin. Skinner argues that the ritual is in fact an exorcism. &lt;ref&gt;PGM V. 96-172: Stele of Jeu the Hieroglyphist in his letter:&lt;/ref&gt; 

"I summon you Headless One, who created earth and heaven, who created night and day [...] I am the Favor of the Aion; my name is a heart encircled by a serpent" &lt;ref&gt;Hans Dieter Betz, ''The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation'', 1992. P. 103). &lt;/ref&gt;

A similar [[formula]] is also used in Crowley's ''[[Liber Samekh]]'' for establishing contact with the [[Holy Guardian Angel]].

Crowley's text is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Thee I invoke, the Bornless one.&lt;br&gt;
Thee, that didst create the Earth and the Heavens:&lt;br&gt;
Thee, that didst create the Night and the day.&lt;br&gt;
Thee, that didst create the darkness and the Light.&lt;br&gt;
Thou art Osorronophris: Whom no man hath seen at any time.&lt;br&gt;
Thou art Iabos:&lt;br&gt;
Thou art Iapos:&lt;br&gt;
Thou hast distinguished between the just and the Unjust.&lt;br&gt;
Thou didst make the female and the Male.&lt;br&gt;
Thou didst produce the Seed and the Fruit.&lt;br&gt;
Thou didst form Men to love one another, and to hate one another.&lt;br&gt;
I am Ank F N Khonsu Thy Prophet, unto Whom Thou didst commit Thy Mysteries, the Ceremonies of Khem:&lt;br&gt;
Thou didst produce the moist and the dry, and that which nourisheth all created Life.&lt;br&gt;

[[Buddhism]] is not officially recognized as a religion in [[Slovakia]]. The 2001 [[census]] findings included Buddhism under "other religions," so the total number of Buddhists is not known. 

Various Buddhist schools, including all three traditional vehicles ([[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]]), are active as either informal groups or civil associations. Theravada is represented by groups of [[vipassana]] practitioners. Several [[Zen]] schools, including disciples of [[Sando Kaisen]] and the Korean [[Kwan Um]] School, represent the Mahayana. Vajrayana schools include [[Nyingma]] practitioners following Namkai Norbu Rinpoche. The [[Diamond Way]] organisation founded and directed by [[Ole Nydahl]] is also active in Slovakia.

'''Christian agnostics''' practice a distinct form of [[agnosticism]] that applies only to the ''properties'' of [[God]]. They hold that it is difficult or impossible to be sure of anything beyond the basic tenets of the [[Christianity|Christian faith]]. They believe that God or a higher power exists, that [[Jesus]] may have a special relationship with God and is in some way divine, and that God should be worshipped. This belief system has deep roots in Judaism and the early days of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Weatherhead |first=Leslie |title=The Christian Agnostic |date=1972 |publisher=[[Abingdon Press]] |isbn=978-0-687-06977-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 Christian theologian [[Leslie Weatherhead]] published ''The Christian Agnostic'', in which he argues:&lt;ref name="Smith2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald E. Smith|title=The Hopeful Agnostic: What I Believe&amp;nbsp;– I Guess|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LzTlBUzbT4AC&amp;pg=PA15|date=February 2012|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4685-4459-6|pages=15–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weatherhead1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weatherhead |first=Leslie D.|title=The Christian Agnostic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ZODJwAACAAJ|date=September 1990|publisher=Abingdon Press|isbn=978-0-687-06980-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;many professing agnostics are nearer belief in the true God than are many conventional church-goers who believe in a body that does not exist whom they miscall God.}}

Although radical and unpalatable to conventional theologians, Weatherhead's agnosticism falls far short of Huxley's, and short even of ''[[Agnosticism#Types|weak agnosticism]]'':&lt;ref name="Smith2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weatherhead1990" /&gt;
{{quote|Of course, the human soul will always have the power to reject God, for choice is essential to its nature, but I cannot believe that anyone will finally do this.}}

In the summary chapter of ''The Christian Agnostic'', Weatherhead stated what he believed in a sort of twelve-part creed:

#'''God''':   Weatherhead believed in God, whom he felt most comfortable referring to as "Father". Like most Christians, he felt that the Creator was higher on a scale of values, but that God must also be personal enough to interact in a direct relationship with people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weatherhead|first=Leslie |title=The Christian Agnostic|year=1965|publisher=Festival Books|location=Abingdon/Nashville |isbn=0-687-06978-5 |pages=344–345}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Christ''':  Weatherhead believed in the divinity of Christ, in that he (Jesus) stood in a special relationship with God and "indeed an incarnation of God in a fuller sense than any other known Being."&lt;ref name="Weatherhead 1965 345"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weatherhead|first=Leslie|title=The Christian Agnostic |year=1965|publisher=Festival Books|location=Abingdon/Nashville|isbn=0-687-06978-5|page=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weatherhead pointed out that the New Testament never refers to Jesus as God and neither did Jesus refer to himself in this way. Jesus called himself the Son of Man and the Word. To say that Jesus was the "only begotten son" of God would be an impossibility, as such information is not presently available.&lt;ref name="Weatherhead 1965 345"/&gt; The [[virgin birth of Jesus]] was not an issue for Weatherhead, having (in his view) never been a major tenet for being a follower of Christ. Moreover, the New Testament traces Jesus' lineage through his Father Joseph, not Mary, to show that he descended from the house of David.&lt;ref name="Weatherhead 1965 347"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weatherhead|first=Leslie|title=The Christian Agnostic |year=1965 |publisher=Festival Books|location=Abingdon/Nashville|isbn=0-687-06978-5|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weatherhead did not believe Jesus to be sinless, as evidenced by the fact that Jesus got angry, cursed a fig tree because it did not produce fruit and rebuked Peter, one of his closest disciples, calling him Satan. Since Jesus was morally superior, many theologians assume him to be sinless, though Jesus never made that claim for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weatherhead|first=Leslie|title=The Christian Agnostic|year=1965|publisher=Festival Books |location=Abingdon/Nashville |isbn=0-687-06978-5|page=349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weatherhead apparently agreed with Nathaniel Mickelm, whom he quoted regarding the blood sacrifice of Jesus as something that was unnecessary for forgiveness. For Mickelm (and subsequently for Weatherhead), it would be a perversion of God to suppose that "God did not and could not forgive sins apart from the death of Christ." Yet that sacrifice revealed something of the nature of God that made one want to be forgiven.&lt;ref name="Weatherhead 1965 347"/&gt;
#'''Holy Spirit''':  As for the [[Holy Spirit]], Weatherhead conceded agnosticism. "Few Christians, whom I know, think of the Holy Spirit as a separate Person", he said. His view was that this would equate to worshiping two gods instead of one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weatherhead|first=Leslie|title=The Christian Agnostic |year=1965|publisher=Festival Books|location=Abingdon/Nashville|isbn=0-687-06978-5|page=350}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Church''':  His view of the church was an idealistic one. The church on earth should be a photocopy of the divine original, in which all who loved Christ would be joined together to "worship and move forward to the unimaginable unity with God which is his will."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weatherhead|first=Leslie|title=The Christian Agnostic|year=1965|publisher=Festival Books|location=Abingdon/Nashville |isbn=0-687-06978-5 |page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Bible''':  Weatherhead believed the [[Bible]] to be an amazing and often inspired collection of works that progressively revealed man's search for and understanding of God, culminated in the best representation of God's true nature in Jesus Christ. He was, however, critical of many passages, including some from Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, because they went against the nature of what Jesus taught, stating that "some of the passages of Browning are of far superior spiritual value."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weatherhead |first=Leslie |title=The Christian Agnostic|year=1965|publisher=Festival Books|location=Abingdon/Nashville |isbn=0-687-06978-5 |pages=352–353}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weatherhead insisted that one must reject anything in the Bible that did not coincide with the [[gospel]] of Christ, that is, anything that did not harmonise with the spirit of "love, liberty, gaiety, forgiveness, joy and acceptance."&lt;ref name="Weatherhead 1965 354"&gt;{{cite book |last=Weatherhead|first=Leslie|title=The Christian Agnostic|year=1965|publisher=Festival Books |location=Abingdon/Nashville |isbn=0-687-06978-5|page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Providence''': Webster's defines this as "God conceived as the power sustaining and guiding human destiny".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/providence&lt;/ref&gt; Weatherhead understood that God cared for humankind but that some would find this difficult (since suffering exists in the world). If "God is love" it would be difficult to deny [[divine providence|God's Providence]].&lt;ref name="Weatherhead 1965 354"/&gt;

== By denomination ==
=== Roman Catholic ===
According to [[Pope Benedict XVI]], strong agnosticism in particular contradicts itself in affirming the power of reason to know scientific [[truth]].&lt;ref name=YOJC/&gt;&lt;ref name=TT/&gt; He blames the exclusion of reasoning from religion and ethics for dangerous pathologies such as crimes against humanity and ecological disasters.&lt;ref name=YOJC&gt;{{cite book| title=The Yes of Jesus Christ: Spiritual Exercises in Faith, Hope, and Love| first=Joseph| last=Ratzinger|publisher=Cross Roads Publishing|year=2005}}

"Agnosticism", said Ratzinger, "is always the fruit of a refusal of that knowledge which is in fact offered to man&amp;nbsp;... The knowledge of God has always existed".&lt;ref name=TT/&gt; He asserted that agnosticism is a choice of comfort, pride, dominion, and utility over truth, and is opposed by the following attitudes: the keenest self-criticism, humble listening to the whole of existence, the persistent patience and self-correction of the [[scientific method]], a readiness to be purified by the truth.&lt;ref name=YOJC/&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]] sees merit in examining what it calls "partial agnosticism", specifically those systems that "do not aim at constructing a complete philosophy of the unknowable, but at excluding special kinds of truth, notably religious, from the domain of knowledge".&lt;ref name="CEnc1"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Church is historically opposed to a full denial of the capacity of human reason to know God. The [[Council of the Vatican]] declares, "God, the beginning and end of all, can, by the natural light of human reason, be known with certainty from the works of creation".&lt;ref name="CEnc1"/&gt;

[[Blaise Pascal]] argued that even if there were truly no evidence for God, agnostics should consider what is now known as [[Pascal's Wager]]: the [[Infinity|infinite]] expected value of acknowledging God is always greater than the finite expected value of not acknowledging his existence, and thus it is a safer "bet" to choose God.&lt;ref name=PKPW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peterkreeft.com/topics/pascals-wager.htm| title=Argument from Pascal's Wager| year=2007 | accessdate=May 25, 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605044148/http://peterkreeft.com/topics/pascals-wager.htm| archivedate=June 5, 2008 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coffee talk.JPG|thumb|Mike Myers, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Roseanne Barr]] as their characters]]
'''"Coffee Talk with Linda Richman"''' is a series of sketches performed by [[Mike Myers]] on the [[sketch comedy]] show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. It ran from October 12, 1991, until October 15, 1994, although Myers (who had since left the show) reprised the role once more on March 22, 1997.

In the sketches, Myers plays a stereotypical [[Jewish]] middle-aged woman, named after his ex-mother-in-law Linda Richman, with an exaggerated [[New York City English|New York accent]] who sports long, [[nail polish|painted]] [[fake nails]]; lots of gold [[jewelry]]; gaudy sweaters; large dark glasses; and [[big hair]], which she constantly adjusts. This character was a spoof on his former real-life mother-in-law, Linda Richman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = [[Alex Witchel|Witchel, Alex]] |date= January 14, 2001 |title=Counterintelligence; What's So Funny About the 'Coffee Talk' Lady | work =[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/14/style/counterintelligence-what-s-so-funny-about-the-coffee-talk-lady.html?pagewanted=1 |accessdate= December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paul Baldwin period==
Introduced on the January 19, 1991, episode, this sketch was originally called "Coffee Talk with Paul Baldwin", with Baldwin played by Joe Mantegna. The main joke was the use of as many words that accentuated the stereotypical New York accent as possible, particularly the [[New York City English#Vowels|low back chain shift]] that changes the vowels in words like "dogs, daughters, lofts and coffee" as Baldwin describes the show's preferred topics.

Starting with the October 12, 1991, episode, Paul Baldwin was written out and replaced with the character of Richman as the substitute host. In subsequent episodes, Richman explains that Baldwin is a good friend of hers and is recuperating in [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]], [[Florida]], because "he developed ''[[Yiddish words used in English#S|shpilkis]]'' in his ''genechtagazoink''".

==Ongoing gags==

===Streisand fixation===
Richman's hero was [[Barbra Streisand]]. She constantly "dedicated" the show to her, often claiming her to be the greatest actress in all of history.

In what could be considered to be the sketch's most memorable moment, Myers was joined on February 22, 1992, by special guests [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Roseanne Barr]] as other stereotypical Jewish women. Madonna also lampooned herself by having her character attack Madonna as a bad example for teenage Jewish girls ("She's a tramp. Every week with the different boyfriend! And this week in the papers with no clothes on! Who needs her? Feh!!"), referring to the hitchhiking scene from Madonna's "Erotica" video. They discussed Streisand's film ''[[The Prince of Tides]]'' (1991) on the show.

Near the end of the sketch, the women compared Streisand to "[[butter|buttah]]"{{spaced ndash}}and suddenly, a voice announced, "All this talk about food, I'm getting hungry, girls." It was Streisand herself in a surprise appearance; none of the actors had any idea that she was to appear.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} All three managed to remain in character as the audience went wild. (Myers as Richman screamed, "I can die now! That's all the time we have for this week; I have to go and die now!") The real Richman, sitting in the audience that night to watch her then son-in-law lampoon her, has acknowledged having been "tickled to death" at that particular moment, as Streisand is one of her actual heroes as well.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Streisand only stayed long enough to give each character a kiss and wave to the audience. Streisand later revealed that she had been giving a performance at [[Radio City Music Hall]] (which is located across West 50th Street from [[NBC Studios (New York)|NBC Studios]]) and happened to overhear that the sketch was being done that night. In the television special ''Saturday Night Live: 101 Most Unforgettable Moments'', this particular sketch is moment number six.

===Call-ins===
Richman would occasionally take callers. The number to call was always 555-4444, each "four" again said with the same accent (though, in some later airings, the 555 is bleeped out and covered up on screen, as 555-4444 is no longer a [[fictitious telephone number]]). "Give a call, we'll talk, no big whoop."

===Mannerisms===
Richman occasionally added [[Yiddish]] or [[Yinglish|pseudo-Yiddish]] words into her speech: "OK now, this show used to be hosted by my friend Paul Baldwin, but he developed ''shpilkis'' in his ''genechtagazoink''. So now he's in Boca Raton, Florida, recovering nicely, thank you very much." The [[catchphrase]] often used to describe things Linda admired was "like butter", which in the accent becomes "like buttah". A typical example is, "Her voice, it's like [[butter|buttah]]."

====Discussion topics====
Whenever Richman would get upset, she would put her hand on her chest and say "I'm all ''[[Yiddish words used by English-speaking Jews#V|verklempt]]''" or "I'm a little ''verklempt."'' Then she would say, "Talk amongst yourselves," sometimes waving her hand in a dismissive gesture toward the audience. She would often follow this with an example by saying, "I'll give you a topic," which would typically have the structure of a [[bahuvrihi]]: "''[two- or three-part phrase]'' is neither ''[first part]'', nor ''[second part]'' (nor [''third part'']). Discuss."  Richman would then recover after a beat.

Examples:
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
*"[[Dr. Pepper]] were neither a doctor, nor a pepper.  Discuss."
*"[[The Partridge Family]] were neither [[partridges]], nor a family.  Discuss."
*"[[Milli Vanilli]] is neither a Milli or a Vanilli. Discuss."
*"[[Palmolive (soap)|Palmolive]]{{spaced ndash}}it's neither [[Arecaceae|palm]], nor [[olive]]. Discuss."
*"[[Grape-Nuts]]{{spaced ndash}}it contains neither [[grape]]s, nor [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s. Discuss."
*"The [[American Civil War|Civil War]] was neither civil nor a [[war]]. Discuss."
*"The radical [[Reconstruction era of the United States|reconstruction]] of [[Southern United States|the South]] after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] was neither [[wikt:radical|radical]] nor a [[wikt:Reconstruction|reconstruction]]. Discuss."

*"Jamaican Joe was neither [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]], nor named Joe. Discuss."

*"The [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]] is neither [[Mormon]] nor a [[tabernacle]] nor a [[choir]]. Discuss."
*"The [[New Deal]] was neither new nor was it a deal. Discuss."

*"The [[internal combustion engine]] was neither internal nor combustion. Discuss."

*"The [[Italian neorealism|Italian neo realist movement in film]] was neither Italian nor neo nor particularly realist. Discuss."
{{colend}}
*"The [[Industrial Revolution]] was neither Industrial nor a Revolution. Discuss."

====Ethnic and religious references====
Richman would also make light jokes and good-natured ribbing about people raised in [[interfaith]] families, such as: someone who came from a family with [[Methodist]] and Jewish parents is called a "[[Mu Shu]]", whereas people who came from families with Jewish and [[Roman Catholic]] parents were called "cashews". In one of the final episodes of the sketch, Richman is shown with an Irish-Catholic boyfriend, who is a retired [[NYPD]] officer (played by [[Charlton Heston]]). When the boyfriend proposes marriage to her, Richman acts stunned, which prompts tremendous cheering from the female audience members.

==Cultural references==
The [[Fran Drescher]] [[sitcom]] ''[[The Nanny (TV series)|The Nanny]]'' (1993&amp;ndash;1999) made a direct tongue-in-cheek reference to the Richman sketches by showing brunette Fran Fine (Drescher), her blonde mother ([[Renée Taylor]]) and gray-haired grandma Yetta ([[Ann Guilbert]]) on the couch watching their respective "Coffee Talk" counterparts (Myers', Madonna's, and Roseanne Barr's characters) on television, all very similar in their appearance, voice and mannerisms. While fussing over their big hair in the fashion of the "Coffee Talk" regulars, they complain that the sketch is "so stereotypical".

The Richman character was inspired by Myers' then real-life mother-in-law, a woman of New York Jewish extraction who is actually named Linda Richman. During a [[Larry King]] interview of Myers, the real Richman called in and expressed good-natured amusement about the character. During his appearance on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', he claimed that his impression for the character was "underplayed" and that his mother-in-law actually goaded him into performing the voice of the character when they were in public together.

Myers made an appearance as Richman during [[Barbra Streisand in Concert|Streisand's '93/'94 New Year's Eve concert]] at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas]]. While Streisand discussed reporting made in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Richman was heard from the audience assuring Streisand to ignore such press ("Don't listen to that woman, Barbra; what does she know? Please! Feh!"). Streisand then invited Richman up on stage, and they performed a comedy skit [[lampooning]] the Coffee Talk discussion topics. (Streisand: "Now, I'm getting ''verklempt''! [To audience:] Talk amongst yourselves. I'll give you a topic: ''The Prince of Tides'' was about neither a prince nor tides{{spaced ndash}}Discuss.")

'''''Contact''''' is a 1985 [[science fiction]] novel by American scientist [[Carl Sagan]]. It deals with the theme of contact between humanity and a more technologically advanced, extraterrestrial life form. It ranked No. 7 on the [[Publishers Weekly list of bestselling novels in the United States in the 1980s#1985|1985 U.S. bestseller list]]. The novel originated as a screenplay by Sagan and [[Ann Druyan]] (whom he later married) in 1979; when development of the film stalled, Sagan decided to convert the stalled film into a novel. The film concept was subsequently revived and eventually released in 1997 as the film ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'' starring [[Jodie Foster]].

==Plot==

===The Message===
As a child, Eleanor "Ellie" Arroway displays a strong aptitude for science and mathematics. Dissatisfied with a school lesson, she goes to the library to convince herself that [[pi|{{pi}}]] is irrational. In sixth grade her father and role-model Theodore ("Ted") dies. A man named John Staughton becomes her stepfather and does not show as much support for her interests. Ellie refuses to accept him as a family member and concludes that her mother only remarried out of weakness.

After graduating from [[Harvard University]], Ellie receives a doctorate from [[Caltech]] supervised by David Drumlin, a well known [[radio astronomer]]. She eventually becomes the director of "Project Argus", a [[radiotelescope]] array in [[New Mexico]] dedicated to the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI). This puts her at odds with most of the scientific community, including Drumlin, who tries to have the funding to SETI cut off. To his surprise, the project discovers a [[Radio wave|signal]] containing a series of [[prime number]]s coming from the [[Vega]] system 26 light years away.&lt;ref&gt;A sequence of prime numbers is a commonly predicted first message from alien intelligence, since mathematics is considered a [[universal language]], and it is conjectured that algorithms that produce successive prime numbers are sufficiently complicated so as to require intelligence to implement them.&lt;/ref&gt; Further analysis reveals information in the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] [[modulation]] of the signal. This message is a retransmission of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s opening speech at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in [[Berlin]]; the first television signal powerful enough to escape Earth's [[ionosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Sagan 1985. p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The President of the United States meets with Ellie to discuss the implications of the first confirmed communication from extraterrestrial beings. Ellie begins a relationship with Presidential Science Advisor Ken der Heer. With the help of her Soviet colleague Vaygay Lunacharsky, Ellie is able to set up redundant monitoring of the signal so that a telescope remains pointed at Vega at all times. A third message is discovered describing plans for an advanced machine. With no way of decoding the 30,000 pages, SETI scientists surmise that there must be a primer that they have missed.

===The Machine===
At the President's insistence, Ellie agrees to meet with two religious leaders, Billy Jo Rankin and Palmer Joss. A lifelong [[religious skepticism|religious skeptic]], Ellie tries to convince Joss of her faith in science by standing near a heavy [[Foucault pendulum]] and trusting that its [[amplitude]] will not increase. Although dismissing Rankin's outbursts, Ellie is intrigued by Joss' worldview. Shortly after, Ellie travels to Paris to discuss the machine with a newly formed [[consortium]]. The participants reach a consensus that the machine is a [[dodecahedron]] shaped vehicle with five seats. At the conference, Ellie meets Devi Sukhavati, a doctor who left India to marry the man she loved, only to lose him to illness a year later. The final piece of the message is discovered when S. R. Hadden, a billionaire in multiple high-tech industries with an obsessive personal interest in the concept of immortality, suggests that Ellie check for [[phase modulation]]. This reveals the primer, thus allowing construction of the machine to begin.

The American and Soviet governments enter a race to construct identical copies of the machine. As errors in the Soviet project are discovered, the American machine becomes the only option. Ellie applies to be one of the five passengers but her spot is given to David Drumlin instead. Despite heavy security, a group of extremists is able to get a bomb into one of the fabrication plants in [[Wyoming]]. During a visit by three astronomers, the bomb explodes, killing Drumlin and postponing completion of the machine indefinitely. Ellie's family also suffers when her mother has a stroke which causes paralysis. John Staughton accuses Ellie of ignoring her own mother for years.

Ellie learns that S. R. Hadden has taken up residence aboard a private space station. While on board, he reveals that his company has been covertly building a third copy of the machine in [[Hokkaido|Hokkaido, Japan]]. The activation date is set for December 31, 1999 and Ellie, Vaygay and Devi are given three of the spots. The other two are given to Abonnema Eda, a Nigerian physicist credited with discovering the [[theory of everything]] and Xi Qiaomu, a Chinese archaeologist and expert on the [[Qin dynasty]]. The five board the machine thinking that the extraterrestrials will either give them an additional task or cancel the transmission from Vega so that the signal only lasts for another 26&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;While [[Vega]] is 25 light years away, the book references its distance as 26 light years.&lt;/ref&gt; years.

===The Galaxy===
Once activated, the dodecahedron transports the group through a series of [[wormhole]]s to a massive station near the center of the [[Milky Way]]. The station contains a surreal Earth-like beach where the five are split up. Ellie meets an extraterrestrial in a form indistinguishable from Ted Arroway, who explains his people's reasons for making contact, and tells her of their ongoing project to alter the properties of the universe by accumulating enough mass in [[Cygnus A]] to counter the effects of [[entropy]]. He also tells her that the wormhole system was built by unknown precursors, and hints at the discovery of artificial messages in [[transcendental number]]s like π. Ellie is reunited with the other four travellers who have also met simulations of their loved ones. She captures video evidence of the encounter before the dodecahedron takes them back to Earth.

Upon returning, the passengers discover that what seemed like many hours took no time at all from Earth's perspective. They also find that all of their video footage has been erased, presumably by magnetic fields in the wormholes. After seeing that Hadden is apparently dead and that the transmission has somehow been stopped without a 26&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; year delay, government officials accuse the travellers of an international [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]]. They blackmail Ellie and her fellow travellers into silence until more evidence can be found. Palmer Joss becomes one of the few people willing to believe her story that she can only justify on faith.

Acting on the suggestion of "Ted", Ellie works on a program to compute the digits of π to heretofore-unprecedented lengths. Ellie's mother dies before this project delivers its first result. A final letter from her informs Ellie that John Staughton, not Ted Arroway, is Ellie's biological father. When Ellie looks at what the computer has found, she sees a circle [[rasterisation|rasterized]] from 0s and 1s that appear after 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; places in the [[radix|base]] [[undecimal|11]] representation of π. This not only provides evidence of her journey, but suggests that intelligence is behind the universe itself.

==Publication history==

In 1981, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] gave Sagan a $2 million advance on the novel.  At the time, "the advance was the largest ever made for a book that had not yet been written."&lt;ref name="Davidson 1999"&gt;Davidson 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The first printing was 265,000 copies. In the first two years it sold 1,700,000 copies. It was a main selection of Book-of-the-Month-Club.&lt;ref&gt;Spence&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan's friend, the physicist [[Kip Thorne]], gave Sagan ideas on the nature of wormholes when Sagan was developing the outline of the novel.&lt;ref name=Tech&gt;{{cite web | url = http://contact-themovie.warnerbros.com/cmp/technology.html | title = Contact – High Technology Lends a Hand/Science of the Soundstage | publisher = [[Warner Bros.]] | accessdate = 2014-09-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010304211755/http://contact-themovie.warnerbros.com/cmp/technology.html |archivedate=2001-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan named the novel's protagonist, Eleanor Arroway, after two people: [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], a "personal hero" of Sagan's wife, [[Ann Druyan]] and [[Voltaire]], whose last name was Arouet.&lt;ref name="Davidson 1999"/&gt;

The novel won the [[Locus Award for Best First Novel]] in 1986.

The '''Devanga Purana''' is the ''kulapuranam'', or mythological history, of the [[Devanga]] community. It deals with the life of their legendary founder, Devala Maharshi, and his seven incarnations, goddess (Chowdeswari), rituals and customs. The Devanga community reside in all the south Indian states and also split in north Indian states. They are traditionally engaged in cotton cloth weaving and cloth business.

==Translations==
Around 1532 CE, Devanga people in [[Andhra Pradesh]] requested the [[Telugu language|Telugu]] poet [[Bhadralinga Kavi]] to write their ''kulapuranam'', which resulted in the Devanga Purana. It is written as poems in the ''dasimatra-dvipadi'' style.&lt;ref name="world"&gt;{{cite book |last1=P |first1=Swarnalatha |title= The World of the Weaver in Northern Coromandel, C.1750-C.1850|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t5XlI91kP3YC&amp;pg=PA41 |year=2005 |publisher=Orient Longman Private Limited |location=Hyderabad |isbn=978-8-12502-868-0 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devanga Purana was  originally written in [[Sanskrit]] included in [[Brahmanda Purana]]; it has been translated into [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Kannada]]. The first copy was printed in Kannada named "Badarayana".{{cn|date=January 2017}}

The corresponding Greek god [[Tyche]] is also regularly shown with a gubernaculum. There are abundant depictions of Fortuna holding the gubernaculum on coins, in paintings, on altars and statues or statuettes.

==Symbolism and Meaning==
In mythology the rudder, which the goddess can steer, represents control of the changeable fortunes of life. Plato used the metaphor of turning the [[Ship of State]] with a rudder. In the Biblical book of James, the author compares the tongue with a ship's rudder which, though physically small, makes great boasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taming the Tongue|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+3&amp;version=ESV|website=Bible Gateway|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harichand Thakur''', sometimes known as ''Sri Sri Harichand Thakur'', (ca. 1812-1878) worked among the [[Untouchability|untouchable]] people of [[Bengal Presidency]], who considered him to be a god.

Harichand Thakur is variously said to have been born in 1811&lt;ref name="robb"&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of India |first=Peter |last=Robb |edition=2nd, revised |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-23034-549-2 |page=255 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GQ-2VH1LO_EC&amp;pg=PT255}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1812.&lt;ref name="sarkar"&gt;{{cite book |title=Between History and Histories: The Making of Silences and Commemorations |editor1-first=Gerald M. |editor1-last=Sider |editor2-first=Gavin A. |editor2-last=Smith |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-80207-883-4 |chapter=Renaissance and Kaliyuga: Time, Myth, and History in Colonial Bengal |first=Sumit |last=Sarkar |page=115 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Jje8cSPgTtQC&amp;pg=PA115}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family were peasant farmers of the [[Namasudra]] community and he was born in the [[Gopalganj District, Bangladesh|Gopalganj area]] of what was then Bengal Presidency (now a part of Bangladesh).&lt;ref name="bandyopadhyay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Caste, Culture and Hegemony: Social Dominance in Colonial Bengal |first=Sekhar |last=Bandyopadhyay |publisher=SAGE |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-76199-849-5 |page=96 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=z2SVIflbyHQC&amp;pg=PA96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Named Harichand Bairagi at birth, he moved to [[Orakandi]], [[Faridpur District]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

At a very early age, Thakur accepted the path of religious reformation for giving service to and uplifting the untouchable people of Bengal. He experienced ''atmadarshan'' (self-realisation) and preached his ideologies and religious philosophy in twelve commandments and asked his followers to pursue his works.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Thakur, whose family were [[Vaishnavite]] Hindus,&lt;ref name="bandyopadhyay"/&gt; founded a sect of Vaishnavite Hinduism called [[Matua Mahasangha|Matua]]. This was adopted by members of the Namasudra community, who were then also known by the pejorative name of [[Chandala]]s and considered to be untouchable.&lt;ref name="sarkar"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Politics of Caste in West Bengal |editor1-first=Uday |editor1-last=Chandra |editor2-first=Geir |editor2-last=Heierstad |editor3-first=Kenneth Bo |editor3-last=Nielsen |publisher=Routledge |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-31741-477-3 |chapter=Building Up the Harichand-Guruchand Movement: The Politics of the Matua Mahansgha |first=Praskanva |last=Sinharay |page=152 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7qXbCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sect was opposed to Brahmanical Hinduism and, according to Sipra Mukherjee "[inspired] the community towards education and social upliftment". It has subsequently attracted adherents from other caste communities that were marginalised by the upper castes, including the [[Chamar]]s, [[Mahishya]]s, [[Mali caste|Mali]]s, and [[Teli]]s.&lt;ref name="mukherjee"&gt;{{cite book |first=Sipra |last=Mukherjee |chapter=Creating Their Own Gods: Literature from the Margins of Bengal |title=Dalit Literatures in India |editor1-first=Joshil K. |editor1-last=Abraham |editor2-first=Judith |editor2-last=Misrahi-Barak |publisher=Routledge |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-31740-880-2 |pages=132, 140 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ph4-CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thakur's followers consider him as God (hence calling him ''Thakur'') Harichand and as an [[avatar]] (incarnation) of [[Vishnu]] or [[Krishna]]. Thus, he became known as ''Sri Sri Harichand Thakur''.{{cn|date=July 2017}} However, adherents of mainstream Hinduism do not accept this, despite often assimilating offshoots of their faith, because, according to the [[Dalit|Dalit activist]] [[Debendralal Biswas Thakur]], to do so in this instance would be to undermine the basis of their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Politics of Caste in West Bengal |editor1-first=Uday |editor1-last=Chandra |editor2-first=Geir |editor2-last=Heierstad |editor3-first=Kenneth Bo |editor3-last=Nielsen |publisher=Routledge |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-31741-477-3 |chapter=Building Up the Harichand-Guruchand Movement: The Politics of the Matua Mahansgha |first=Praskanva |last=Sinharay |page=159 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7qXbCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thakur was married to Jagat Mata Shanti Mata and they had two sons. He died at Orakandi in 1878.

== Legacy ==
After his death, one of his sons, Guruchand Thakur (b. 1846), worked with C. S. Mead in a campaign to have the Chandala people [[sanskritisation|recategorised as Namasudra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Namasudra Movements In Bengal (1872-1947)|first=Ratan Kumar |last=Biswas|publisher=Progressive Book Forum |year=2010 |isbn=978-81-88006-19-9 |page=158-160}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Sekhar Bandyopadhyay]], it was under the leadership of Guruchand that the Matua sect "achieved its doctrinal cohesion and organisational push, as it came to be associated with the Namasudra social protest movement started in 1872".&lt;ref name="bandyopadhyay"/&gt;

A considerable body of [[Dalit literature]] that mixes religious and secular themes has emerged around Thakur and Matua. This includes biographies, promotions of the teachings and interpretations of the relationship to later events, such as the thoughts of [[B. R. Ambedkar]] and comparisons with the situation of black people in the US.&lt;ref name="mukherjee"/&gt;

'''Ibogaline''' (spelled Iboga'leen) is a naturally occurring [[psychoactive]] [[alkaloid]] found in ''[[Tabernanthe iboga]]'' plant along with [[ibogaine]], [[ibogamine]] and other minor alkaloids.  It is a relatively smaller component of ''Tabernanthe iboga'' root bark total alkaloids (TA) content.  The percentage of ibogaline in [[iboga]] root bark is up to 15% TA with ibogaine constituting 80% of the alkaloids and ibogamine up to 5%. &lt;ref&gt;“Pharmacology of Ibogaine and Ibogaine-Related Alkaloids.” The Alkaloids.

'''Insight Dialogue''' is an interpersonal meditation practice that brings together meditative awareness (e.g., [[mindfulness]], concentration), the wisdom teachings of the [[Buddha]], and [[dialogue]] to support insight into the nature, causes, and release of human suffering. Six [[meditation]] instructions, or guidelines, form the core of the practice.

== Rationale ==
Engaging in mindful dialogue with one or more other people supported by instruction in the guidelines and by contemplations that encourage a direct and intimate inquiry into the human experience is the form of the practice. Insight Dialogue is taught and practiced in a number of contexts—residential retreats, daylong workshops, community practice groups, and online (e.g., via [[Skype]]).

Insight Dialogue has its roots in the Buddha's early teachings on the human experience ([[Pali Canon|Pāli Canon]]) and the practice of [[Vipassanā|Insight or Vipassanā meditation]]; however, people of all faiths and backgrounds can practice. Gregory Kramer and Terri O'Fallon co-created Insight Dialogue. Gregory Kramer, the Founder and Guiding Teacher of Metta Programs, continued developing the practice and has been teaching it worldwide since 1995.

== Guidelines ==
Although designed to work together, the Insight Dialogue guidelines are typically taught individually, in sequence.

=== Pause ===
Temporal pause; stepping out of habitual thoughts and reactions into experience in the present moment; mindfulness.

=== Relax ===
Invitation to calm the body and mind; receiving whatever sensations, thoughts, and feelings are present; acceptance.

=== Open ===
Extension of mindfulness from internal to include the external; spaciousness; matures to include the relational moment; mutuality.

=== Trust emergence ===
Entering the relational moment without an agenda; awareness of the impermanence of thoughts and feelings; allowing experience to unfold; "don't know" mind.

=== Listen deeply ===
Listening mindfully, with an awareness that is relaxed and open; ripens into unhindered receptivity to the unfolding words, emotions, and presence of another.

=== Speak the truth ===
Articulation of the truth of one's subjective experience with mindfulness; discernment of what to say amid the universe of possibilities; ripens into an acute sensitivity to the voice of the moment that "speaks through" the meditator.

According to the [[Constitution of Bangladesh]], citizens of the country have [[Freedom of religion in Bangladesh|freedom of religion]], including the right to establish and maintain their own religious institutions. The constitution also declares all kinds of [[religious discrimination]] illegal, although religious minorities and [[atheists]] are conspicuously under-represented by the government and society of the country. A number of Bangladeshi atheist bloggers have been attacked and killed by fundamentalist religious groups in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Avijit Roy Hacked to death in Bangladesh|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/american-blogger-avijit-roy-hacked-death-bangladesh-n314001 |work=NBC News |accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bangladesh blogger hacked to death|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/31/asia/bangladesh-blogger-death |work=CNN |accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bangladesh blogger Ananta Bijoy Das hacked to death|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-32701001 |work=BBC News |accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fourth secular Bangladesh blogger hacked to death|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/08/fourth-secular-bangladesh-blogger-hacked-death-150807102408712.html |work=Al Jazeera News |accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2009 [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] survey, more than 99% of respondents from Bangladesh replied that religion is an important part of their daily life.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religiosity Highest in World's Poorest Nations|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx |author=Steve Crabtree |website=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup.com]] |accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] survey from 2014 found that 5% of Bangladeshi identify as non-religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=End of Year Survey 2014: Regional &amp; Country Results|url=http://www.wingia.com/en/services/end_of_year_survey_2014/regional_country_results/8/46/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Shahbag protests===

In February 2013, [[2013 Shahbag protests|protests occurred]] in [[Shahbag]] demanding capital punishment for the Islamist leader and war criminal [[Abdul Quader Molla]] as well as the removal of [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami|Jamaat-e-Islami]] from politics.&lt;ref name="reuters-1"&gt;{{cite news|title = Protesters demand death for Bangladesh war crimes Islamist|url = http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/02/06/bangladesh-verdict-war-idINDEE9150CS20130206|accessdate = 8 February 2013|newspaper = [[Reuters]]|date = 6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamist groups including [[Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh]] responded by organising [[2013 Operation at Motijheel Shapla Chattar|protests]] calling for the execution of "atheist bloggers" accused of insulting Islam, and the introduction of a [[blasphemy law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/04/06/hardline-muslims-rally-bangladesh/2058851/|title=Hardline Muslims rally in Bangladesh amid shutdown|date=6 April 2013 |newspaper=USA Today |agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Farid Ahmed |date=8 April 2013 |title=Bangladesh Islamists rally for blasphemy law |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/06/world/asia/bangladesh-blasphemy-protest |work=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many secularist bloggers who supported the Shahbag protests came under attack following the protests.&lt;ref name="dw"&gt;{{cite news |date=26 February 2015 |title=Activist, blogger and DW Bobs nominee Avijit Roy killed in Dhaka |url=http://www.dw.de/activist-blogger-and-dw-bobs-nominee-avijit-roy-killed-in-dhaka/a-18283869 |work=Deutsche Welle}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] noted with concern the rise in [[communal violence]] against religious minorities, including [[2013 Bangladesh anti-Hindu violence|attacks on Hindus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=6 March 2013 |title=Bangladesh: Wave of violent attacks against Hindu minority |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/bangladesh-wave-violent-attacks-against-hindu-minority-2013-03-06 |newspaper=Amnesty International |accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=7 March 2013 |title=Amnesty calls for protecting Hindus |url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2013/03/07/amnesty-for-hindu-protection |newspaper=bdnews24.com |accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government suppression of criticism of religion===

In early April 2013, the police began arresting bloggers for hurting religious sentiments. Four bloggers, Subrata Adhikary Shuvo, Russell Parvez, Mashiur Rahman Biplob and Asif Mohiuddin (who was still recovering from his wounds), were arrested within days of one another. The blog, Amar Blog, was also taken down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bangladesh Arrests 'Atheist Bloggers,' Cracking Down on Critics|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/03/bangladesh-bloggers_n_3009137.html|accessdate=27 January 2014|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]|date=4 April 2013|author=Emran Hossain}}&lt;/ref&gt; A religious group called [[Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh]] called for the hanging of the bloggers.&lt;ref name=hefazat&gt;{{cite news|title=Hefazat-e Islam: Islamist coalition|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22424708|accessdate=27 January 2014|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=6 May 2013|author=Sabir Mustafa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asif Mohiuddin's blog was shut down by the [[Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission]], and he was jailed for posting "offensive comments about Islam and Mohammed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=25 May 2013 |title=Bangladesh gags award-winning blogger |url=http://www.dw.de/bangladesh-gags-award-winning-blogger/a-16697713  |work=Deutsche Welle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.rsf.org/bangladesh-unjustifiable-decision-to-send-30-07-2013,44992.html |title=Blogger granted bail on health grounds |date=7 August 2013 |website=Reporters without Borders}}&lt;/ref&gt; The secular government arrested several other bloggers and blocked about a dozen websites and blogs, as well as giving police protection to some bloggers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news |date=27 February 2015 |title=American atheist blogger hacked to death in Bangladesh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/27/american-atheist-blogger-hacked-to-death-in-bangladesh |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International organisations, including [[Human Rights Watch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/04/15/bangladesh-crackdown-bloggers-editors-escalates |title=Bangladesh: Crackdown on Bloggers, Editors Escalates |date=15 April 2013|website=[[Human Rights Watch]]}} "the government is abandoning any serious claim that it is committed to free speech," said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ASA13/007/2013/en/|title=Bangladesh: Further information: Detained editor alleges torture|quote=Blogger Asif Mohiudeen, arrested on 3 April for allegedly posting blasphemous comments online, remains in detention and at risk of torture |date=17 April 2013 |website=Amnesty International}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reporters without Borders]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.rsf.org/bangladesh-call-for-detained-blogger-s-11-04-2013,44367.html |title=Call for detained blogger's immediate release |date=11 April 2013 |website=Reporters without Borders |quote=Reporters Without Borders condemns the baseless judicial proceedings brought against the detained blogger Asif Mohiuddin, who could be tried and convicted on a charge of blasphemy and "hurting religious sentiments" at his next hearing}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]]&lt;ref name=cpj2013&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cpj.org/2014/02/attacks-on-the-press-in-2013-bangladesh.php |title=Attacks on the Press – Bangladesh |date=February 2014 |website=Committee to Protect Journalists}}&lt;/ref&gt; condemned the imprisonment of bloggers and the climate of fear for journalists. [[Worldwide Protests for Free Expression in Bangladesh|Worldwide protest and demonstrations]] were held on in 2013 to put pressure on the Bangladeshi government to free the arrested bloggers. Several humanist groups (including the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union|IHEU]], the [[Center for Inquiry]], the [[British Humanist Association]], [[American Atheists]] and the [[Secular Coalition for America]]) called for their release, along with intellectuals including&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Avijit Roy |date=8 May 2013 |title=The Struggle of Bangladeshi Bloggers |url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/13-05-08/#feature |journal=Skeptic |accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Taslima Nasrin]], [[Hemant Mehta]], [[Maryam Namazie]], [[PZ Myers]], [[Avijit Roy]], [[Abu Ahammad]], [[Ajoy Roy]], [[Qayyum Chowdhury]], Ramendu Majumdar and [[Muhammad Zafar Iqbal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=8 May 2013 |title=The Struggle of Bangladeshi Bloggers |url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/13-05-08/#feature |journal=Skeptic |accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats, attacks and exiles==
{{main|Attacks on secularists in Bangladesh}}
[[Taslima Nasrin]], an author and self-described atheist, used to criticise rising [[religious fundamentalism]] and government inaction in her newspaper columns and books. In early 1992, mobs began attacking bookstores stocking her work. The same year she was assaulted at a book fair and her passport was confiscated. In July 1993, her novel ''[[Lajja]]'' was banned by the government on the claims that it created misunderstanding among the communities. On 23 September 1993, a [[fatwa]] was issued for her death. After international pressure, her passport returned in April 1994. She travelled to France and returned via India. On 4 July 1994, an arrest warrant was issued for hurting religious feelings and Nasrin went underground. On 3 August, she was granted bail, but she fled to Sweden and remained in exile. In 1998, she visited her critically ill mother in Bangladesh. In 2005, she moved to India and applied for citizenship.&lt;ref name="literature"&gt;{{cite book |author=Margaret Bald |date=2006 |title=Literature Suppressed on Religious Grounds |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMiqYHR6xkMC&amp;pg=PA177 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |page=177 |isbn=978-0-8160-7148-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Bangladeshi author [[Humayun Azad]] wrote a book about an [[Islamic fundamentalist]] group [[Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh]] collaborating with the Pakistani army during the 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. Azad received numerous death threats from fundamentalists until his assassination the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=12 August 2009 |title=Proper probe into death of Humayun Azad demanded |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=101061 |newspaper=Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, Humayun Azad's son, blogger Ananya Azad, was repeatedly threatened with death after publishing critiques of Islamist fundamentalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/28/bangladeshi-blogger-ananya-azad-named-hitlist|title=Bangladeshi blogger named on hitlist warned: 'You will be next'|first=Saad|last=Hammadi|date=28 May 2015|publisher=|accessdate=3 December 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently forced into exile in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/23/militant-group-publishes-hit-list-of-bloggers-activists-and-writers|title=Militant group publishes global hitlist of bloggers, activists and writers|first=Jason|last=Burke|date=23 September 2015|publisher=|accessdate=3 December 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 January 2013, [[Asif Mohiuddin]], a self-styled atheist blogger (rational, gentle and Anti-Islamist), was stabbed near his office in [[Dhaka]]. He survived the attack.&lt;ref name=asif_stab&gt;{{cite news |date=15 January 2013 |title='Militant atheist' blogger stabbed in Bangladesh |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/militant-atheist-blogger-stabbed-in-bangladesh/article1-989966.aspx |newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]] |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 February 2013, [[Ahmed Rajib Haider]], a prominent anti-Islamist blogger, was found murdered by a machete outside his Dhaka home.&lt;ref name=murder_ahmed&gt;{{cite news |date=15 February 2013 |title=Anti-Islamist blogger killed in Bangladesh: police |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gvgXRcLgESI9K6wFCyhmT32zJswg |newspaper=[[Agence France-Presse]] |accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mohiuddin, a winner of the [[The BOBs (weblog award)|BOBs award]] for online activism, was on an Islamist hit list that also included the murdered sociology professor Shafiul Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.rsf.org/bangladesh-bloggers-on-hit-list-posted-by-19-11-2014,47250.html |title=Bloggers on hit-list posted by supposed Islamist group in Bangladesh |date=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 7 March 2013, an atheist blogger Sunnyur Rahaman was attacked by two men who swooped on him and hacked him with machetes while shouting "[[Allahu Akbar]]". He came under attack around 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm near Purabi Cinema Hall in Mirpur. By the support of local police he was rushed to [[Dhaka Medical College and Hospital]] with wounds in his head, neck, right leg and left hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Youth hacked injured at Mirpur |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/youth-hacked-injured-at-mirpur/ |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate = 20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 February 2015, [[Avijit Roy]], the founder of the Mukto-Mona blog, and his wife were attacked in [[Dhaka]] with machete-wielding assailants. Roy died on his way to the hospital. His wife was also seriously injured and lost a finger.&lt;ref name=HackedToDeath&gt;{{cite news|title=American atheist blogger hacked to death in Bangladesh|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/27/american-atheist-blogger-hacked-to-death-in-bangladesh|accessdate=27 February 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USAtheist&gt;{{cite news|title=Atheist US blogger hacked to death in Bangladesh|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/bangladesh/11438812/Atheist-US-blogger-hacked-to-death-in-Bangladesh.html|accessdate=27 February 2015|work=[[The Telegraph (UK)|The Telegraph]]|date=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March 2015, blogger Washiqur Rahman was killed in a similar attack in Dhaka. The police arrested two suspects near the scene and recovered [[meat cleaver]]s from them. The suspects said they killed Rahman due to his anti-Islamic articles.&lt;ref name=Washiqur&gt;{{cite news|title=Knife attack kills Bangladesh blogger Washiqur Rahman|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-32112433|accessdate=31 March 2015|work=[[BBC News]]|date=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 March 2015, another blogger [[Ananta Bijoy Das]] was attacked and murdered by masked men wielding machetes. Ananta Bijoy Das was the editor of the science magazine ''Jukti''.&lt;ref name="Ananta Bijoy Das"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bangladesh blogger hacked to death by masked assailants|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/asia-pacific/bangladesh-blogger-hacked-to-death-by-masked-assailants-1.2209412|accessdate=12 May 2015|work=[[Irish Times]]|date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Islam by country}}

'''[[Islam]] in [[Lithuania]]''', unlike many other northern and western European countries, has a long history. The medieval [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], stretching from Baltic to Black seas, included several Muslim lands in the south inhabited by [[Crimean Tatars]].&lt;ref&gt;Islamic peoples of the Soviet Union, by Shirin Akiner, pg. 85&lt;/ref&gt; A few Muslims migrated to ethnically Lithuanian lands, now the current Republic of Lithuania, mainly under rule of Grand Duke [[Vytautas the Great|Vytautas]] (early 15th century). The Tatars, now referred to as [[Lithuanian Tatars]], lost their language over time and now speak [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]; however, they maintained Islam as their religion. Due to the long isolation from all the greater Islamic world, the practices of the Lithuanian Tatars differ somewhat from the rest of [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s; they are not considered a separate sect, however, although some of the Lithuanian Tatars practice what could be called [[Folk Islam]]. One anonymous Lithuanian Tatar who made Hajj to Mecca acknowledged in his work the Risȃle that the Lithuanian Tatars had unorthodox customs and rituals so that they could possibly be viewed as infidel (kafir) from the perspective of orthodox Muslims.&lt;ref name="Akiner2009-2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shirin Akiner|title=Religious Language of a Belarusian Tatar Kitab: A Cultural Monument of Islam in Europe : with a Latin-script Transliteration of the British Library Tatar Belarusian Kitab (OR 13020) on CD-ROM|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FEJ7F2cmCt0C&amp;pg=PA51|year=2009|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-03027-4|pages=51–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lithuania, unlike many other European societies at the time, there was religious freedom. Lithuanian Tatars settled in certain places, such as around [[Raižiai]] (in [[Alytus district municipality]]).

Much of the Lithuanian Tatar culture, mosques, graveyards and such were destroyed by the [[Soviet Union]] after it annexed Lithuania. After restoration of Lithuanian independence however the government supported the promotion of Lithuanian Tatar culture among those Lithuanian tatars who lost it. Three original wooden mosques remain now (in villages of [[Nemėžis]], [[Keturiasdešimt Totorių]] (both in [[Vilnius district municipality]]) and [[Raižiai]] ([[Alytus district municipality]]), typically having relatively large Muslim populations), as well as a new brick mosque built in [[Kaunas]] during the period of interwar independence of Lithuania (in the 1930s) to commemorate the anniversary of Vytautas, the duke who brought Tatars and Islam to Lithuania. That mosque is called [[Kaunas Mosque|Vytautas Didysis Mosque]] after the Grand Duke [[Vytautas the Great|Vytautas]]. In the capital of Lithuania, [[Vilnius]], however, no mosque remains, as Russians destroyed the [[Lukiškės Mosque]] which was there. The Lithuanian Tatar community is trying to rebuild the mosque, but faces various problems, including lack of funds as well as certain actions by the government of [[Vilnius city municipality]].

Currently, only several thousand Lithuanian Tatars remain, making up an estimated 0.1% of the country's population;&lt;ref&gt;Račius, E. (2013). Lithuanian Muslims’ Attitudes Toward Participation in the Democratic Political Process. Muslim Political Participation in Europe. Edited by J. S. Nielsen. Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press: 83-101., pg. 84&lt;/ref&gt; however, with the restoration of Lithuanian independence, they are experiencing a kind of national revival with evidence to suggest there are several hundred non-Tartar converts to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Račius, E. (2013). Lithuanian Muslims’ Attitudes Toward Participation in the Democratic Political Process. Muslim Political Participation in Europe. Edited by J. S. Nielsen. Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press: 83-101., pg. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time of the Soviet Union, some people from other Muslim nationalities were moved in, however many of them were atheists; as well other Muslims came as immigrants after restoration of independence, but as for now this number is very small compared to similar numbers in western Europe; therefore Lithuanian Tatars remain the core of Islam in Lithuania, supported by some Lithuanians who converted. Halal meat in the country remains difficult to obtain, with more observant Muslims slaughtering animals themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eastern Europe and migrants: The mosques of Lithuania|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21664279-baltic-state-worried-about-arrival-muslims-overlooks-those-who-have-lived-there|accessdate=20 September 2015|work=[[The Economist]]|date=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jules Semon Bache''' (November 9, 1861 – March 24, 1944) was an [[United States|American]] [[banker]], [[art collector]] and [[philanthropist]].

== Early life ==
Julius Bache was born to a [[Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/social-history/2008/best-friends-jewish-society-in-old-palm-beach New York Social Diary: "Best Friends: Jewish Society in Old Palm Beach"] 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w1xAAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA396&amp;lpg=PA396&amp;dq=jules+bache#v=onepage&amp;q=jules%20bache&amp;f=false The American Hebrew: "Jule S.

==Career==
In 1881, he started work as a cashier at Leopold Cahn &amp; Co., a [[stockbroker]]age firm founded by his uncle. In 1886, he was made a minority partner and in 1892 took full control of the business, renaming it [[Bache &amp; Co.|J. S. Bache &amp; Co.]] Jules Bache built the company into one of the top brokerage houses in the United States, outranked only by [[Merrill Lynch]]. In the process, he became an immensely wealthy individual, a patron of the arts, and a philanthropist.

During [[World War I]], Jules Bache donated money to the [[American Field Service]] in [[France]] and his wife was the honorary treasurer of the "War Babies' Cradle," a [[Charitable organization|charity]] that provided aid for mothers and children in distress in war-torn Northern France and [[Belgium]] to provide them with food, clothing, heating fuel and medical care.

Jules Bache was a shareholder of a number of prominent corporations and sat on the board of directors of many of them. Among his personal holdings, Bache had sizeable interests in Canadian mining companies. His equity in these companies were held by his [[Bahamas]] based corporation that allowed him to legally avoid some of the high personal U.S. surtaxes, a fact which he would be publicly criticized for as a result of the Federal investigations during the 1930s into the causes of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]]. Bache however believed that high taxation was a hindrance to economic growth and published a booklet titled "''Release business from the slavery of taxation''." A major shareholder in [[Placer Dome|Dome Mines Limited]], Bache served as company president from 1919 until 1942 and was Chairman of the Board at the time of his passing. After the brokerage firm of [[Dillon, Read &amp; Co.]] acquired the [[Dodge]] Brothers Automobile Company in 1923, Jules Bache acquired a substantial position in [[Chrysler Corporation]].

[[File:Jules Bache Mausoleum 1024.jpg|thumb|300px|The mausoleum of Jules Bache]]In addition to his high profile in the business world, Jules Bache would also become well known for his art collecting that received much press attention in 1929 when he purchased the portrait of "''[[Giuliano di Lorenzo de' Medici|Giuliano de Medici]]''," then attributed to [[Raphael]]. He would acquire numerous other important works including those by or attributed to [[Rembrandt]], [[Titian]] (including ''[[The Bache Madonna]]''), [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Diego Velázquez]], [[Gerard David]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], and [[Sandro Botticelli]], amongst others. In 1937 he opened his magnificent art collection to the public, and in 1943 donated some of his works to the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]].

=== Gift to the Metropolitan Museum of Art ===
Bache was a major donor to the Department of Decorative Arts at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/Preston_Remington_records_b18157099.pdf Finding aid for the Preston Remington records, 1925–1970], Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 25 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death in 1944, most of his picture collection – up to that time gifted to the Jules Bache Foundation, was given to the Museum; the remaining works of art from his estate from his house at 814 Fifth Avenue were sold at auction.&lt;ref&gt;New York Herald Tribune, Sunday, April 1, 1945, p. 20 'Jules S. Bache Art Collection is Going on Sale: Works Not Donated to the Metropolitan Museum To Be Sold April 19, 20, 21.' The auction was held at the Kende Galleries of Gimbel Brothers. The New York Times, Sunday, April 1, 1945 adds that 'oil paintings and terracotta statuary' were to be sold on April 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably his portrait by Austrian artist [[Wilhelm Viktor Krausz]] (1878–1959) was retained by one of Bache's daughters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19151">{{about||the music scholar|Julian Johnson (academic)|the 17th-century writer nicknamed "Julian" Johnson|Samuel Johnson (pamphleteer)}}

'''Julian Philip Matthew Johnson''' (1873–1939, [[Beas City|Beās]], British India) was an American surgeon and author of several books on [[Eastern spirituality]]. He spent much of the 1930s in India, was associated with the [[Radha Soami Satsang Beas]] movement and [[Surat Shabd Yoga]], and wrote five books (one unpublished) as a result of his experiences.

==Life and career==

===Early days and education===
Johnson grew up in a staunch Christian family in the southern United States, became a Baptist minister at age 17, graduated [[Bachelor of Divinity]] in [[Bolivar, Missouri]], and received an appointment as a missionary to India at age 22. Johnson claimed that experiences during his three-year stay in India, however, rendered him surprised by the deep understanding possessed by Indians he had sought to convert, and urged him towards further study.

Back in the United States, he earned two master's degrees (M.A. theology) at the [[University of Chicago]], resigned his 17-year Baptist ministership, and earned an M.D. from the [[University of Iowa|State University of Iowa]]. He served as an assistant surgeon in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War I]], and later went into private practice. He also owned and flew his own airplanes.

===Religious studies===

Over the years, he took to studies of various religious and philosophical teachings, including [[Christian Science]], [[Freemasonry]], [[New Thought]], [[Rosicrucianism]], [[Spiritualism]], [[Theosophical Society|Blavatskyan Theosophy]], and world religions. His spiritual explorations culminated when he visited an old friend (Julia McQuilkin in Oregon)&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, ''With a Great Master in India'', 1988 p. 12; 1994 p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; who was a disciple of Bābā [[Sawan Singh|Sāwan Singh]] of [[Beas, Punjab|Beās, Pañjāb]], India. Convinced that he had found his path, Johnson requested initiation, which was arranged for by Dr. Harold Brock&lt;ref&gt;Harold Brock, a dentist from Port Angeles, Washington State, and his wife Genevieve were the first Western disciples of Sāwan Singh, initiated into [[Surat Shabd Yoga]] in 1910 or 1911 through Sardār Kehr Singh Sasmas. Harold Brock later became a follower of Sant [[Kirpal Singh]].&lt;/ref&gt; and performed on 21 March 1931. After a year, Johnson left once more for India on 24 March 1932.&lt;ref name="Johnson B"&gt;Johnson, ''With a Great Master in India'', 1988/1994, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; (At the two-week stopover in [[Hawaii]], he had discussions on religion with the English [[Jōdo Shinshū]] priest [http://www.answers.com/topic/ernest-hunt Ernest "Shinkaku" Hunt] [1876–1967] of the [[Honpa Hongwanji Mission of Hawaii|Hongwanji]].&lt;ref name="Johnson B" /&gt;)

===Move to India===

Dr. Johnson was the first American to live permanently at [[Derā Bābā Jaimal Singh]], in Beās, where he became busy with study, writing, some medical work, meditation, and traveling with Sāwan Singh. Johnson edited Sardār Sevā Singh's English translation of Soamiji Maharaj [[Shiv Dayal Singh]]'s ''Sār Bachan'',&lt;ref&gt;The book which American religion founder Paul Twitchell described to his future wife Gail thus: "I have a book in my collection called the Sar Bachan written by Sardar Seva Singh, which is the teachings of the Sound Current, and acts as practically my Bible!" —Twitchell, letter of July 8, 1963, in Paul Twitchell, ''Letters to Gail'', volume II, Menlo Park: [[ECKANKAR]], 1977, page 149.&lt;/ref&gt;. Johnson also coined the term "[[Audible Life Stream]]". He wrote five books at the Dera, four of which were published: ''With a Great Master in India'' (1934, autobiographical), ''Call of the East'' (autobiography), ''The Unquenchable Flame'' (biography of his wife Elizabeth, written in first person), and his magnum opus ''The Path of the Masters''.

===Paul Petzoldt===

In Kashmir, Johnson met [[Paul Petzoldt]] (the mountaineer, [[Outward Bound]] instructor, and founder of the [[National Outdoor Leadership School]]), and invited him to the Derā where Petzoldt received initiation from Johnson's guru, served as Johnson's assistant in the ashram clinic, even helping in surgical operations. Friction occurred after Petzholdt's wife moved from America to join him and then became ill and disillusioned with life at Beās.&lt;ref&gt;Cf: "[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxzYWNoa2hhbmRqb3VybmFsfGd4Ojc5ZjQwZWRiYWQxNzVlMGQ The Mystery of Dr. Julian Johnson's Death]" in ''Sach Khand, The Journal of Radhasoami Studies'', Issue 9, Walnut, California: MSAC Philosophy Group.&lt;/ref&gt; A tussle with Petzhold led to the accidental death of Johnson. Petzoldt's version of this occurrence is told in an article by Molly Absolon, "Paul Tells His Story" in ''The Leader'', Fall 1995, [[National Outdoor Leadership School|NOLS]] [https://archive.is/20120805063420/http://www.nols.edu/alumni/leader/95fall/paultellshisstory.shtml].

For a comprehensive look at how Johnson died see the book, "The Mystery of Dr. Johnson's Death: A Scandal in the Punjab," published by Mt. San Antonio College, 2017.

===Elizabeth Rose Bruce===

Johnson's wife Elizabeth Rose (died 1941) was an American socialite, traveler, adventurer, herbalist, and spiritual seeker. She was a faithful worker of the Rādhāsoāmī Satsang, [[Dayalbagh|Dayāl Bāgh]], [[Āgrā]], India, and a disciple of [[Anand Swarup|Sir Ānand Sarūp, Kt]],&lt;ref&gt;Given a whole chapter in [[Paul Brunton]]'s ''[https://archive.org/details/ASearchInSecretIndia A Search in Secret India]'' (1934).&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually left Ānand Sarūp.&lt;ref&gt;''The Unquenchable Flame'', chapter 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson married her and they lived out life in Beās. Johnson wrote her "autobiography" ''The Unquenchable Flame'' (Beās: Five Rivers Manufacturing Company, 1935).&lt;ref&gt;In summation, the following were all initiated disciples of "The Great Master" Bābā Sāwan Singh (1858–1948): Julian Johnson, Julia McQuilkin, Sardār Kehar Singh Sasmas, Genevieve and Harold Brock, Sardār Sevā Singh, [[Kirpal Singh|Sant Kirpāl Singh]], [[Charan Singh (guru)|Sardār Charan Singh]], Sant Darshan Singh, and Elizabeth Rose Bruce Johnson. American religion founder Paul Twitchell was initiated by Kirpāl Singh. American religious studies scholar David Christopher Lane is an initiate of Charan Singh's, and a deep admirer of [[Baba Faqir Chand|Faqīr Chand]] who had made a "radical revision of the teaching on the guru" (—Gold, 1987, page 166).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Johnson remains the most well-known among many Western adherents of and authors on [[Sant Mat]] / [[Surat Shabd Yoga]] ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]: Sūrat-Śabd Yoga). Possibly, no other single author in Sant Mat has more influenced North American "Shabdism" (—[[David C. Lane]]'s term) than Johnson.

===''The Path of the Masters''===

Johnson's magnum opus, now published as ''The Path of the Masters: The Science of Surat Shabd Yoga: The Yoga of the Audible Life Stream'' &lt;ref&gt;downloads: [http://www.bahaistudies.net/asma/pathofthemasters.pdf 12th ed] [https://archive.org/details/ThePathOfTheMasters 16th ed] [https://archive.org/details/ThePathOfTheMasters 16th ed]&lt;/ref&gt; (but originally titled ''The Path of the Masters: The Science of Sūrat Shabda Yoga: Santon kī Shikshā'') is a comprehensive, explicit, systematically organised, meticulous, and polished work on the Path of the Soundstream and Lightstream. Published in France (1939), the USA (1957) and India (slightly revised by the Radha Soami Satsang Beas Publications Committee in 1972 and 1985 to delete provocative language, and extensively revised in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;The chapters of editions of 1993 and after have been radically rearranged.&lt;/ref&gt;) it remains popular among Western adherents of Sant Mat. However, its author's blunt style and now outmoded opinions – influenced by Northern European [[Polygenism|racist]] notions then in vogue but now considered politically incorrect — have turned off some modern readers. The text's sheer eloquence, however, has made the work the object of plagiarism by other writers, especially in the United States, where it used to be almost totally unknown to the general reading public. The work appears to have heavily influenced the American [[Eckankar]] (ECK) religion, and its various offshoots and spin-offs, through ECK founder [[Paul Twitchell]]'s&lt;ref&gt;"... Paul Twitchell, was also an initiate of Kirpal Singh." —[[Mark Juergensmeyer|Juergensmeyer]] in Schomer &amp; [[W. H. McLeod|McLeod]], 1987, page 335.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"... Paul Twitchell, was an initiate of Kirpal Singh." —[[Mark Juergensmeyer|Juergensmeyer]], ''Radhasoami Reality'', page 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"... Paul, a former [[Guru–shishya tradition|chela]] ..." of Kirpal Singh—Klemp, ''The Secret Teachings'', page 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"His [Paul Twitchell] spiritual beliefs were further influenced by his exposure to ... Ruhani Satsang ..."—Guiley, 1991, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;  alleged [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027071940/http://geocities.com/eckcult/chapters/tmsma4.html plagiarism] – discussed at length and in depth in Prof. [[David C. Lane]]'s exposé ''The Making of a Spiritual Movement''.&lt;ref&gt;American religious studies professor David Christopher Lane, a pupil of Prof. [[Mark Juergensmeyer]], is known for two achievements: his M.A. thesis ''Radhasoami Mat: Parampara in Definition and Classification (A Genealogical History of the Gaddi Nasheen Lineages Connected with Shiv Dayal Singh)'' at the Graduate Theological Union, tracing the lineages that descended from Shivdayāl Singh (1818–1878) and from [[Hazur Rai Saligram Bahadur|Salig Rām]] (1829–1898), and his documented exposé on Paul Twitchell and his ECK religion. Lane interviewed Sant Darshan Singh (1921–1989) who showed him Twitchell's papers as an initiated disciple of Sant [[Kirpal Singh]] (1894–1974), founder of Ruhani Satsang.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Western adherents at least, ''The Path of the Masters'' has enjoyed long-time popularity among foreign-language works on Sant Mat.&lt;ref&gt;"best-seller"—[[Mark Juergensmeyer|Juergensmeyer]], ''Radhasoami Reality'', page 208.&lt;/ref&gt; A sampling of Johnson's polished prose (1985 pagination) shows the logic that has proven compelling to Western readers, even outside of Sant Mat circles:&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Lane in ''The Making of a Spiritual Movement'' cites several instances. These include the section "Guarding One's Own Mental Processes" from ''Path of the Masters'', chapter 2 (1974–1990 p. 189; 1985 p. 149; 1993 p. 169), which was published verbatim as an article by U.S. occultist Audrey Kargere in ''Orion Magazine'', v. 10, issue 94, Mar–Apr 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

:* "... if you live rightly among men, and then devote yourself to the practice of the Surat Shabd Yoga, you will enter the kingdom of heaven while you are still living in the body. And that constitutes a world of difference between the spiritual science of the Masters and all religions." —page 57

:* "In the realm of religion, the Master is a paradox. He has no theology, teaches none, yet he is the most religious man on earth. His system is not a religion, yet it leads to the most complete religious experience, and the most happy. He is absolutely universal in all his teachings. He has no creed, yet he never antagonizes any creed, sect or institution. He never condemns any man or any system. He finds no fault with anybody or anything, yet draws the sharpest lines between the good and the bad." —page 162

:* "Each and every man, when properly trained, is able to detach himself from the physical body while still living in that body in perfect health, and then travel to all parts of the outlying universe. Everyone has this ability whether he is conscious of it or not." —page 343

:* "[[Vairagya]] is the next important step in mental preparation for the Path,... This means the mental detachment of oneself from the external world. This is real vairagya. It does not in any way teach or imply that one should physically detach himself from the world. He need not leave his family or society, his public or private duties. The Masters never teach that sort of vairagya.... Detachment, as taught by the Masters, does not imply austerities." —pages 357–358

:* "There is but one thing known to human experience which will destroy all lower desires. That is the Audible Life Stream. It is the supreme instrument of deliverance from bondage. It is the one means of detaching us from worldly objects that perish, and of lifting us up to liberty and light.... We shall attain perfect [[vairagya]] only when we enter into that divine Stream consciously." —page 364

:* "No man ever gained spiritual freedom, power and happiness by a process of logic, by [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] ratiocination, by [[metaphysics]], by reading books or by listening to lectures. Yet these are the methods employed by the majority of mankind. The Masters solve all their problems by a scientific method as exact and exacting as mathematics. They get their information not by analysis and synthesis but by sight and hearing. Even after they have proved a proposition, they establish no authority except that of truth itself. Authority hampers truth, it throttles free investigation. Authority is an enemy to progress.... This science makes personal experience the final and only court of appeal. Its processes are simple and direct. They can be understood by the most ordinary intelligence, and for that reason the intelligentsia need not become offended at them." —page 404

:* "The Masters and many of their students pass daily through "the gates of death" and hence they know all of the problems connected with the matter. They have explored worlds upon worlds beyond the gates of death. All of this they do in full consciousness as a direct result of their practice of Surat Shabd Yoga." —page 419

:* "In the literature of the Saints, God is expressed by many words, such as [[Swami]], [[Ik Onkar|Ekankar]], [[Nirankar]], Radhaswami, [[Akal]], Nirala, Anami, Agam, Alakh, Sat [[Purusha|Purush]], [[Prabhu]], Prabhswami, [[Hari]] Ray, Akshar, [[Parameshwar]], Akshar Purush, etc.  All of these words have been coined in an effort to convey to human intelligence some idea of what the Saints think of God, or Lord God, the highest power.  [[Ik Onkar|Ekankar]] means the “One oneness,” the body of oneness.  [[Nirankar]] means without body or form. Soami or Swami means the all-pervading Lord.  Radha Swami ‒ Radha (soul) and Swami (Lord) ‒ the Lord of the soul ‒ Radha, when reversed, becomes dhara or current.  As soul has to revert to its source, so its dhara, when reversed, when its current is turned toward God, becomes Radha. ... The whole universe is considered as one, the true [[Ik Onkar|Ekankar]]." —pages 221–222

In the suburbs of Mumbai there are two synagogues—at Thana and Kurla—accessible by commuter train.   In the Konkan Region of Maharashtra there are ten synagogue buildings (including those in Pen, Panvel, and a string of small towns and villages, but most are no longer or irregularly functioning, yet the buildings remain in adequate condition. ''Further information'': [[List of synagogues in Kerala]].

Ahmedabad:  Magen Abraham, a nice Art Deco structure in the center of the city.  Pune:  There are two synagogues in Pune Camp—Magen David (built in the late 19th century by the Baghdadi Jews), Succoth Sholam (constructed by the Bene Israel Jews).  New Delhi: Judah Hyam Prayer Hall.  Kolkata (Calcutta):  Magen David Synagogue, Beth El Synagogue, and the closed Neveth Shalom Synagogue.  The three buildings, located in close proximity to one another in the center of the city, were built by the Baghdadi Jews in the late 19th to early 20th century.  Kochi:  Paradesi Synagogue in the Mattancherry area (functioning), Tekkumbagam Synagogue also in Mattancherry (closed and in derelict condition), Tekkumbagam Synagogue in the Ernakulam area (closed), Kadavumbagam Synagogue also in Ernakulam (now operated by a local Jews as the Cochin Blossoms plant/fish business.   Parur (Paravoor), Kerala Synagogue (45 minutes north of Kochi, now closed belonged to  K. J. Regina is the owner of 8.680 cents of property together with Synagogue (known by the name Kadavumbagam Synagogue) and all other things attached there to comprised in Survey No. 601/3 of Mattancherry Village.  K. J. Regina purchased the aforesaid property by virtue of Sale Deed No. 337/99 of S.R.O., Kochi dated 23.1.1999 from V.G. Antony.  The property originally belonged to Jewish Agency, Bombay.  The Director of Jewish Agency Bombay Moses Felber appointed S.S. Koder as his lawful attorney to execute sale deed in favour of Jewish Agency Bombay. The power of attorney holder S.S. Koder executed Sale Deed No. 2764/81 of S.R.O., Kochi, on behalf of Jewish Agency Bombay in favour of M/s. Vanaja Traders.
The aforesaid Vanaja Traders executed sale deed No. 3740/90 dated 15.11.1990 of S.R.O. Kochi in favour of V.G. Antony. And V.G. Antony executed the aforesaid property in favour of K.J.Regina. After the execution of Sale Deed No. 337/99, K. J. Regina has affected mutation, obtained Patta No. P 2173 of Mattancherry Village, paying tax and is in peaceful possession and enjoyment of the same.  The Synagogue is known by the name Kadavumbagam Synagogue and its early history is unclear.  Some local narratives indicate that it was established as early as 1130 and the name was taken from a synagogue that existed in Cranganore. Other oral story reveals that the aforesaid synagogue was built in 1400 when Jews abandoned the nearby Kochangadi Synagogue just south of Jew Town, and that it was ruined and then rebuilt by Muthaliyar in 1539. 
The aforesaid Synagogue had two storied gate house facing to the water front and jetty where the passenger ferry docks.  Today two storied gate house is totally destroyed and encroached by natives and only portion of the former synagogue alone is existing and it is no longer possible to experience the former synagogue in its original context. But enough of the aforesaid Kadavumbagom Synagogue remains standing to recognize it as a quintessential example of Vernacular Kerala Architecture for its material, construction, technique, massing and details.  In recent decades the remaining structure and its surrounding courtyard has been poorly maintained.  About 4 decades after the building was left behind by the departing congregation in the mid 1950s and thereafter it is locked and left idle.  Now the aforesaid synagogue is a gabled building from the front with its flaked walls.  The large wooden windows and doors and shutters once punctured the aforesaid synagogues thick walls now been removed and closed by bricks which obstructs the natural light and ventilation inside the synagogue.
Since the synagogue is being laid idle for the past several decades, the roof, walls and the main front entrance doors perished so that birds, reptiles and stray animals encroached the synagogue and made it as their shelter. The remaining structure isif not protected the same may resulting to total destruction. By Advocate. Sreekanth S.Nair. High Court of Kerala.  Mala, Kerala Synagogue (an hour and a quarter north of Kochi, now closed, and controlled by the local municipality).  Chendamangalam (Chennamangalam) Synagogue, Kerala (forty-five minutes north of Kochi, now closed but operating as a Jewish museum—open daily, except Mondays).

{{Theosophy}}

The '''Masters of the Ancient Wisdom''' are reputed to be [[Spiritual enlightenment|enlightened]] beings originally identified by the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[Henry S. Olcott]], [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]], and others. These Theosophists claimed to have met some of the so-called ''Masters'' during their lifetimes in different parts of the world.&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. page 249"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India: 1925--Theosophical Publishing House--Diagram 5, Facing page 248, provides details about the "Great Ones" functioning on [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiation levels five through nine]]. C.W. Leadbeater’s Spiritual Hierarchy Chart (The Bodhisattva=Maitreya)&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes they are referred to by Theosophists as ''Elder Brothers of the Human Race'', ''Adepts'', [[Mahātmā|''Mahatmas'']], or simply as ''The Masters''.

Helena Blavatsky was the first person to introduce the concept of the Masters to the West. At first she talked about them privately, but she stated that after a few years two of these adepts, [[Kuthumi]] (K.H.) and [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]] (M.), agreed to maintain a correspondence with two British Theosophists – Alfred P. Sinnett and A. O. Hume. This communication took place from 1880 to 1885, and during those years the reputed existence and objectives of the Mahatmas became public. The original letters are currently kept in the [[British Library]] in [[London]] and have been published as the ''[[Mahatma Letters]]''.

==Skeptical view==
[[K. Paul Johnson]] suggests in his book ''The Masters Revealed: Madam Blavatsky and Myth of the Great White Brotherhood'' that the Masters that Madam Blavatsky claimed she had personally met are idealizations of certain people she had met during her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, K. Paul ''The Masters Revealed: Madam Blavatsky and Myth of the Great White Brotherhood'' Albany, New York: 1994 State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicolás Gómez Dávila''' (18 May 1913&amp;nbsp;– 17 May 1994) was a prominent [[Colombia]]n [[writer]] and champion of [[reactionary]] social [[political theory]].

Gómez Dávila's fame began to spread only in the last few years before his death, particularly by way of [[German language|German]] translations of his works. He was one of the most radical critics of [[modernity]] whose work consists almost entirely of [[aphorism]]s which he called "''escolios''" ("glosses").

== Biography ==
Gómez Dávila was a Colombian scholar who never held any university post but spent most of his life in the circle of his friends and within the confines of his library. He belonged to the upper circles of Colombian society and was educated in [[Paris]]. Due to severe [[pneumonia]], he spent about two years at home where he was taught by private teachers and developed a lifelong love of [[classical literature]]. He never, however, attended a university. In the 1930s he went back from Paris to Colombia, never to visit Europe again, except for a six-month stay with his wife in 1948. He built up an immense library containing more than 30,000 volumes around which his literary existence centred. In 1948 he helped found the [[Universidad de los Andes (Colombia)|Los Andes University]] in Bogotá.

In 1954, Gómez Dávila's first volume of works was published by his brother, a compilation of notes and aphorisms under the title ''Notas I''&amp;nbsp;– the second volume of which never appeared. The book remained virtually unknown because only 100 copies were printed and these were presented as gifts to his friends.  In 1959, he followed this with a small book of essays under the title of ''Textos I'' (again, no second volume was published).  These essays develop basic concepts of his philosophical anthropology as well as his philosophy of history, often in literary language full of metaphors.  In these essays, he first voices his intention to create a "reactionary patchwork" because reality, he said, cannot be represented in a philosophical system.

After the collapse of the military dictatorship in 1958 Gómez Dávila was offered the post of chief advisor to the state president which he rejected as he did with respect to later offers, in 1974, to become ambassador in London. Though he supported the later president [[Alberto Lleras Camargo]]'s role in bringing down the dictatorship, he refrained from any political activity himself, a decision he had already reached early on in his practice as a writer.

From this decision resulted his strong criticism not only of left-wing but also of right-wing and conservative political practices, even though his explicitly reactionary principles show some similarities to conservative viewpoints. His skeptical anthropology was based on a close study of [[Thucydides]] and [[Jacob Burckhardt]] as well as his affirmation of hierarchical structures of order on society, state and church. Gómez Dávila emphatically criticised the concept of the sovereignty of the people as an illegitimate divinisation of man and a rejection of the sovereignty of God.  He was likewise deeply critical of the [[Second Vatican Council]] which he saw as a deeply problematical adaptation to the world. He particularly deplored the destruction of the Latin liturgy in the Roman Catholic Church in the wake of the Council.  Similar to [[Juan Donoso Cortés]], Gómez Dávila believed that all political errors ultimately resulted from theological errors. That is why his thought can be described as a form of [[political theology]].

The modern ideologies such as liberalism, democracy, and socialism, are the main targets of Gómez Dávila's criticism, because the world influenced by these ideologies appeared to him decadent and corrupt.

Gómez Dávila discussed a vast range of topics, philosophical and theological questions, problems of literature, art, and aesthetics, philosophy of history and the writing of history. He employed a literary method of succinct statements with a great sensibility for matters of style and tone.  The literary method he developed to perfection is the gloss, the scholion, which he used to comment on the world, particularly in the five volumes of ''Escolios a un texto implícito'' (1977; 1986; 1992) that he published from the seventies to the nineties. He created "the reactionary" as his unmistakable literary mask and made it into a distinctive type of thinking about the modern world as such.  In his later work he attempted to define the "reactionary" with which he identified in an affirmative way by locating him somewhere beyond the traditional position of left and right.  On the basis of a Catholic traditionalism influenced by the intellectual probity of Nietzsche and others he criticized modernity and saw his work as that of a partisan for a "truth that will not die".

Gómez Dávila made no attempts to make his writings widely known.  Only by way of German (and later Italian as well as French and Polish) translation beginning in the late eighties did Gómez Dávila's ideas begin to be read among poets and philosophers such as [[Robert Spaemann]], [[Martin Mosebach]], [[Botho Strauß]], [[Reinhart Maurer]], Rolf Schilling, [[Heiner Müller]], Franco Volpi, [[Asfa-Wossen Asserate]] and Krzysztof Urbanek.

'''''Operation Trojan Horse''''' (or '''''UFOs: Operation Trojan Horse''''') is a book published in 1970 by [[John Keel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Operation Trojan Horse|isbn=978-0962653469|url=http://galaksija.com/literatura/jk_oth.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420102608/http://galaksija.com/literatura/jk_oth.pdf|archivedate=2013-04-20|df=}}. Originally published in 1970 [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GK7CG4].&lt;/ref&gt; The book was reprinted in 1996 with minor additions. It presents the results of Keel's research on [[UFO]]s and similar phenomena.

==Overview==
Keel, who died in 2009, was an [[ufologist]]. According to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', "In his much-acclaimed second book, ''UFOs: Operation Trojan Horse'', Keel suggested that many aspects of modern UFO reports, including humanoid encounters, often paralleled ancient folklore and religious visions, and directly linked UFOs with elemental phenomena."&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite journal|title=John Keel|journal=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=July 10, 2009|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/science-obituaries/5797746/John-Keel.html|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book presents Keel's theory that [[UFO]]s are a phenomenon produced by "[[ultraterrestrial]]s", beings who are able to manipulate matter and our senses, and who in the past manifested themselves as [[fairies]], [[demon]]s, and so on.

Keel explains the title of the book saying, "Our skies have been filled with '[[Trojan horse]]s' throughout history, and like the original Trojan horse, they seem to conceal hostile intent."

In [[Theravada Buddhism]] '''''pariyatti''''' is the learning of the theory of ''[[buddhadharma]]'' as contained within the suttas of the [[Pali canon]]. It is contrasted with '''''patipatti''''' which means to put the theory into practice and '''''pativedha''''' which means penetrating it or rather experientially realising the truth of it.

Pariyatti is also the name of a [[nonprofit organization]] focused on [[Theravada]]n tradition in [[Onalaska, Washington]]. It publishes, distributes, sells and donates books and media devoted to the teachings of the [[Buddha]]. It has been called "North America's leading source of books for students of the [[Theravada]]n tradition" by [[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm, Steve. [http://www.tricycle.com/columns/sangha-services “Dhamma Works: The Pariyatti Book Service,”] "[[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review]]", Winter 2002, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pariyatti bookstore (both website and brick &amp; mortar) carries almost 900 print titles.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Linda. [http://www.ibpa-online.org/articles/shownews.aspx?id=2843 “Serving as a Service Organization: Pariyatti’s Not-For-Profit Strategy,”] "[[Independent Book Publishers Association]] Independent", October 2009, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;
Pariyatti also provides a number of services for free from its website, including classic texts that are out of print, podcasts, and emailed "Daily Words of the Buddha".

Pariyatti is the sole distributor in North America of books published by the Sri-Lanka-based [[Buddhist Publication Society]] (BPS) and the sole distributor in the Americas of books published by the London-based [[Pali Text Society]] (PTS), including the [[Tipitaka]], the standard collection of scriptures in the Theravada Buddhist tradition – also known as the [[Pali Canon]].  It also carries titles from other publishers, including hard-to-find publications from the [[S. N. Goenka#Vipassana Research Institute|Vipassana Research Institute]](VRI) and [[Motilal Banarsidass]], both based in India.

Pariyatti has published more than 30 titles, including those under its own imprint and reprints of selected titles published by VRI and BPS.

== Pariyatti History ==

Pariyatti's roots go back to a home-based mail order service established by a [[Vipassana]] meditator in Northern California in 1984 to enable fellow meditators in the West to buy books that support the practice of Vipassana meditation in the tradition of [[S. N. Goenka]] and Sayagyi U [[Ba Khin]].  Independent of that effort, Vipassana Research Publications of America (VRPA) was launched in 1995 by a second meditator, with the encouragement of Goenka, to make publications from VRI available in the West.  The two entities were combined in 1996 and eventually became known as Pariyatti, which is a word in the [[Pali]] language roughly meaning ''the intellectual background or theoretical understanding of the teachings of the Buddha''.

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] experienced [[religious persecution]] in Canada during both world wars because of their evangelical fervour, conspicuous abstinence from patriotic exercises&lt;!-- flag saluting &amp; anthem singing --&gt; and conscientious objection to military service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tv.jw.org/#en/video/VODOurOrganization/pub-jwbiv_201611_1_VIDEO The Legalization of the Work in Quebec]&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
During [[World War I]] Jehovah's Witnesses were targeted because of their anti-war attitudes and refusal to take part in military service. Rather than being banned directly, Jehovah's Witnesses had to deal with censorship of their literature during the war and the court’s refusal to recognize them as a legitimate denomination, thus rendering unable to claim the status of [[conscientious objector]]s.

==World War II==
During the late 1930s, Witnesses were tried for [[sedition]] because their literature attacked the clergy and political leaders of the country.

In 1940, one year following Canada's entry into [[World War II]], the Jehovah's Witnesses denomination was banned under the [[War Measures Act]].  This ban continued until 1943.  During this period, some of their children were expelled from school; other children were placed in foster homes; members were jailed; men who refused to enter the army were sent to work camps.  In 1940, twenty-nine Witnesses were convicted and sentenced to terms averaging one year.

In his book ''State and Salvation'', William Kaplan wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In July 1940 the government of Canada banned the Jehovah's Witnesses. Overnight it became illegal to be a member of this sect. The law, passed under the War Measures Act, was vigorously enforced. Beatings, mob action, police persecution, and state prosecution confronted the Jehovah's Witnesses as they ignored the ban and continued to go about their work spreading the word of God... The struggle was bitter indeed. Jehovah's Witness children who refused to sing the national anthem and salute the flag during patriotic exercises in public schools were often expelled from class, and in a few cases, removed from their parents' care and placed in foster homes and juvenile detention centres. Men of military service age who refused to fight spent the war trying to get out of alternative service camps established across Canada for conscientious objectors. Jehovah's Witness spent a good deal of time in the courts during the war years; they challenged government policies with which they disagreed, and were arrested in the hundreds and charged with being members of an illegal group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaplan |first=William |title=State and Salvation |location=Toronto |publisher=Univ. of Toronto Press |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Duplessis era==
From 1936 to 1959, Jehovah's Witnesses faced religious and civil opposition in Quebec.  Historically, the Roman Catholic Church had been the dominant institution in the life of the province of [[Quebec]] and a major influence on French Canadian culture.  It nurtured the young people of Quebec, in language and faith; and at the same time it endorsed the legitimacy of British rule and of the established economic order.

For generations, the Roman Catholic Church in Quebec worked with the government, schools, and the courts to maintain the values and attitudes that supported the Church. This encouraged people to vote for politicians who favoured the status quo, the existing political, economic and social order.

Under the [[Premier of Quebec|premiership]] of [[Maurice Duplessis]], politics and the Church were intertwined as the latter continued to maintain a firm and influential hold on the people of Quebec. Throughout his political career, Duplessis courted the support of the Church.

After [[World War II]], the Church came under attack by the Jehovah's Witnesses who challenged its doctrines.  They were determined to seek Catholic converts.  In response, the Duplessis regime mounted a campaign of persecution against Jehovah's Witnesses and communists.  The result was a legal struggle between the Duplessis regime and lawyers such as [[F. R. Scott|Frank Scott]] and [[Pierre Trudeau]] who argued in defence of the rights of minorities.

The clash between Jehovah's Witnesses and the Church became an issue of the competing ideas of freedom of speech and the freedom of religion.  Jehovah's Witnesses went to court to establish the right to distribute their literature on the streets of Quebec.  They also became political dissenters because during the Duplessis era, a challenge to the Church was tantamount to challenging the government.  Any limitation of the Church's authority would mean limiting Duplessis's authority.

Duplessis' efforts to rid the streets of Jehovah's Witnesses took the issue all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The legal issues concerned freedom of speech as much as it concerned freedom of religion.  The Supreme Court held that there can be no freedom of religion without freedom of speech.

===''Saumur v. The City of Quebec''===
{{main|Saumur v. The City of Quebec}}

In 1953 the case of ''[[Saumur v. The City of Quebec]]'' (1953) 25 CR 299 (in which a Jehovah's Witness challenged a Quebec City bylaw prohibiting public distribution of literature without a permit) left the question of religious freedom undecided, with some judges actually arguing that: "both Parliament and the provinces could validly limit freedom of worship providing they did so in the course of legislating on some other subject which lay within their respective powers."

This decision was part of a series of cases the Supreme Court dealt with concerning the rights of Jehovah's Witnesses under the [[Duplessis]] government of Quebec. Previous to this there was the case of ''[[R. v. Boucher]]'' [1951] S.C.R. 265 that upheld the right to distribute pamphlets. Subsequent to ''Saumur'' was the case of ''[[Roncarelli v. Duplessis]]'' [1959] S.C.R. 121 which punished Duplessis for revoking a Jehovah's Witness liquor license.

===Other cases===
In several other cases, including ''[[Chaput v. Romain]]'' (1955) and ''[[Lamb v. Benoit]]'' (1959), Jehovah’s Witnesses successfully sued the police for damages. In ''Chaput v. Romain'', police had raided a home where a religious service by Jehovah’s Witnesses was being conducted, seized [[bible]]s and other religious paraphernalia, and disrupted the service despite not having a warrant and no charges being laid. In ''Lamb v. Benoit'', a Jehovah’s Witness was detained for a weekend for distributing seditious pamphlets on city streets, and was offered freedom from jail if she agreed to sign a release form absolving police from charges of wrongful detention. After she refused, she was charged with sedition but later acquitted. In each case, the accused were successful in defending their rights in civil court.

==Canadian Bill of Rights==
{{main|Canadian Bill of Rights|Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms}}

In order to obtain religious freedom  the Jehovah's Witnesses popularized the idea of a [[Canadian Bill of Rights]] and established numerous libertarian precedents before Canada's highest courts (see [[Human rights]]).

On June 9, 1947, they presented a petition to Parliament for the enactment of a Bill of Rights with 625,510 signatures.  [[John Diefenbaker]] became an advocate of the [[Canadian Bill of Rights]] and eventually introduced the Canadian Bill of Rights to Parliament during his tenure as Prime Minister.

The [[Canadian Bill of Rights]] was the precursor of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] which is part of the Canadian constitution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13691">[[File:Paul Fürst, Der Doctor Schnabel von Rom (coloured version).png|thumb|Copper engraving of Doctor Schnabel (i.e., Dr. Beak), a plague doctor in seventeenth-century Rome, circa 1656]]
A '''plague doctor''' was a medical [[physician]] who treated victims of [[Black Death|the bubonic plague]].{{sfn|Cipolla|1977|p=65}}  In times of [[epidemic]]s, such physicians were specifically hired by towns where the plague had taken hold. Since the city was paying their salary, they treated everyone: both the wealthy and the poor.{{sfn|Cipolla|1977|p=68}} However, some plague doctors were known to charge patients and their families additional fees for special treatments and/or false cures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenhek|first1=Jackie|title=Doctors of the Black Death|url=http://www.doctorsreview.com/history/doctors-black-death/|website=Doctor's Review|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically they were not professionally trained nor experienced physicians or [[surgeon]]s, but rather they were often either second-rate doctors unable to otherwise run a successful medical practice or young physicians seeking to establish themselves.{{sfn|Cipolla|1977|p=65}} These doctors rarely cured their patients; rather, they served to record a count of the number of people contaminated for demographic purposes.

Plague doctors by [[plague doctor contract|their covenant]] treated plague patients and were known as municipal or "community plague doctors", whereas "general practitioners" were separate doctors and both might be in the same European city or town at the same time.{{sfn|Cipolla|1977|p=65}}&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Oliver C., ''A History of Fire and Flame 1932 '', Kessinger Publishing, 2004, p. 202. {{ISBN|1-4179-7583-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Byrne169"&gt;Byrne (Daily), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Matthew, ''Emergent Computation: emphasizing bioinformatics'', Publisher シュプリンガー・ジャパン株式会社, 2005, p. 3. {{ISBN|0-387-22046-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]], plague doctors often lacked medical training and were referred to as "empirics". In one case, a plague doctor had been a fruit salesman before his employment as a physician.&lt;ref name="Byrne170"&gt;Byrne, 170&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, some doctors wore a beak-like mask which was filled with aromatic items. The masks were designed to protect them from putrid air, which (according to the [[Miasma theory|miasmatic theory]] of disease) was seen as the cause of infection. The design of these costumes has been attributed to [[Charles de Lorme]], the chief physician to [[Louis XIII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The "Science" Behind Today's Plague Doctor Costume|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-science-behind-todays-plague-doctor-costume-1737404375|website=Gizmodo|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first European epidemic of the bubonic plague dates back to the mid 6th century and is called the [[Plague of Justinian]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Benjamin Lee, ''Medieval and Renaissance medicine'', Philosophical Library, 1959. p. 471&lt;/ref&gt; The largest number of people affected by the epidemic were the people who had the [[Black Death]] in Europe in the 14th century. In medieval times, the large loss of people (due to the bubonic plague) in a town created an economic disaster. Community plague doctors were quite valuable and were given special privileges; for example, plague doctors were freely allowed to perform [[autopsies]], which were otherwise generally forbidden in Medieval Europe, to research a cure for the plague.

In some cases, plague doctors were so valuable that when [[Barcelona]] dispatched two to [[Tortosa]] in 1650, outlaws captured them ''en route'' and demanded a ransom. The city of Barcelona paid for their release.&lt;ref name="Byrne169" /&gt; The city of [[Orvieto]] hired Matteo fu Angelo in 1348 for four times the normal rate of a doctor of 50-[[florin]] per year.&lt;ref name="Byrne169"&gt;Byrne (Daily), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Clement VI]] hired several extra plague doctors during the [[Black Death]] plague. They were to attend to the sick people of [[Avignon]]. Of 18 doctors in [[Venice]], only one was left by 1348: five had died of the plague, and 12 were missing and may have fled.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, 168&lt;/ref&gt;

== Costume ==
{{Main|Plague doctor costume}}
Some plague doctors wore a [[Plague doctor costume|special costume]]. The garments were invented by [[Charles de L'Orme]] in 1620 and were first used in Naples, but later spread to be used throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Christine M. Boeckl, ''Images of plague and pestilence: iconography and iconology'' (Truman State University Press, 2000), pp. 15, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The protective suit consisted of a light, waxed fabric overcoat, a mask with [[glass]] eye openings and a [[beak]] shaped nose, typically stuffed with herbs, straw, and spices. Plague doctors would also commonly carry a cane to examine and direct patients without the need to make direct contact with the patient.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne (Encyclopedia), p. 505&lt;/ref&gt;

The scented materials included [[juniper berry]], [[ambergris]], [[roses]] (Rosa), [[Mentha spicata|mint]] (''Mentha spicata'' L.) leaves, [[camphor]], [[cloves]], [[laudanum]], [[myrrh]], [[rose]] petals, and [[storax balsam|storax]].&lt;ref name="Byrne170" /&gt; Due to the primitive understanding of disease at the time, it was believed this suit would sufficiently protect the doctor from [[Miasma theory of disease|miasma]] while tending to patients.&lt;ref name="Loudon"&gt;[[Irvine Loudon]], ''Western Medicine: An Illustrated History'' (Oxford, 2001), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public servants ==
Plague doctors served as public servants during times of epidemics starting with the [[Black Death]] of Europe in the fourteenth century. Their principal task, besides taking care of people with the plague, was to record in public records the deaths due to the plague.&lt;ref name="Byrne170" /&gt;

In certain European cities like [[Florence]] and [[Perugia]], plague doctors were requested to do [[autopsies]] to help determine the cause of death and how the plague played a role.{{sfn|Wray|2009|p=172}} Plague doctors became witnesses to numerous wills during times of plague epidemics.{{sfn|Wray|2009|p=173}} Plague doctors also gave advice to their patients about their conduct before death.&lt;ref name="jhmasextract276"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jhmas.oxfordjournals.org/content/XX/3/276.extract |title=The Plague Doctor |publisher=Jhmas.oxfordjournals.org |date=2012-04-02 |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This advice varied depending on the patient, and after the [[Middle Ages]], the nature of the relationship between doctor and patient was governed by an increasingly complex ethical code.{{sfn|Gottfried|1983|p=126}}{{sfn|Gottfried|1983|p=127-128}}

== Methods ==
Plague doctors practiced [[bloodletting]] and other remedies such as putting frogs or [[leeches]] on the [[bubo]]es to "rebalance [[Humorism|the humors]]" as a normal routine.&lt;ref&gt;Byfield, Ted, ''Renaissance: God in Man, A.D. 1300 to 1500: But Amid Its Splendors, Night Falls on Medieval Christianity'', Christian History Project, 2010, p. 37. {{ISBN|0-9689873-8-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plague doctors could not generally interact with the general public because of the nature of their business and the possibility of spreading the disease; they could also be subject to [[quarantine]].{{sfn|Gottfried|1983|p=126}}

{{Kabbalah}}
'''Practical Kabbalah''' ({{lang-he-n|קבלה מעשית}} ''Kabbalah Ma'asit'') in historical Judaism, is a branch of the [[Jewish mysticism|Jewish mystical tradition]] that concerns the use of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. It was considered permitted [[white magic]] by its practitioners, reserved for the elite, who could separate its spiritual source from [[Qliphoth]] realms of evil if performed under circumstances  that were [[Sacred|holy]] ([[Q-D-Š]]) and [[Tumah and taharah|pure]] (טומאה וטהרה, ''tvmh vthrh''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Little Hebrew|url=http://www.alittlehebrew.com/transliterate/|accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The concern of overstepping Judaism's [[Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible|strong prohibitions]] of impure magic ensured it remained a minor tradition in Jewish history. Its teachings include the use of [[Tetragrammaton|Divine]] and angelic names for [[amulet]]s and [[incantation]]s.&lt;ref name=Elber&gt;Elber, Mark. ''The Everything Kabbalah Book: Explore This Mystical Tradition--From Ancient Rituals to Modern Day Practices'', p. 137. Adams Media, 2006. {{ISBN|1-59337-546-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical Kabbalah is mentioned in historical texts, but most Kabbalists have taught that its use is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Chaim Vital. [http://www.kabbalaonline.org/Safedteachings/otherkab/Keys_to_True_Prophecy.asp Keys to True Prophecy: Practical Kabbala Today] (kabbalaonline.org). Retrieved October 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It is contrasted with the mainstream tradition in Kabbalah of ''Kabbalah Iyunit'' (contemplative Kabbalah), that seeks to explain the nature of God and the nature of existence through theological study and Jewish meditative techniques.

According to [[Gershom Scholem]], many of the teachings of practical Kabbalah predate and are independent of the theoretical Kabbalah which is usually associated with the term:
{{quote|Historically speaking, a large part of the contents of practical Kabbalah predate those of the speculative Kabbalah and are not dependent on them. In effect, what came to be considered practical Kabbalah constituted an agglomeration of all the magical practices that developed in Judaism from the Talmudic period down through the Middle Ages. The doctrine of the Sefirot hardly ever played a decisive role in these practices..."&lt;ref&gt;Scholem, Gershom. ''Kabbalah'', p. 183. [[Keter Publishing House]] Jerusalem, Ltd., 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
{{Jewish mysticism}}

===Early practices===
''[[Halakha]]'' (Jewish religious law) forbids [[divination#Hebrew Bible|divination]] and other forms of soothsaying, and the [[Talmud]] lists many persistent yet condemned divining practices.&lt;ref&gt;W. Gunther Plaut, David E. Stein. ''The Torah: A Modern Commentary''. Union for Reform Judaism, 2004. {{ISBN|0-8074-0883-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very frequency with which divination is mentioned is taken as an indication that it was widely practiced in the [[Folk religion#Folk Judaism|folk religion]] of ancient Israel, and a limited number of forms of divination were generally accepted within all of Israelite society, the most common being [[oneiromancy]].&lt;ref name=Aune&gt;Aune, David E. ''Prophecy in Early Christianity and the Ancient Mediterranean World'', p. 82. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1992. {{ISBN|0-8028-0635-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=February 2015}} Other magical practices of Judaic folk religion which became part of practical Kabbalah date from Talmudic times and include the making of amulets and other folk remedies using the esoteric names of angels.&lt;ref name=Elber/&gt;

===Merkabah mysticism===
{{Main|Merkabah mysticism}}
In Talmudic and [[Geonim|Gaonic]] times, rabbinic mysticism focused around exegesis of Ezekiel's vision of the divine Chariot-Throne, and meditative introspective ascent into the heavenly chambers. This elite practical mysticism, as described in the esoteric [[Hekhalot literature]], incorporated and merged into magical incantation elements. The Talmud and [[Midrash]] refer to this as "using the Divine Name" for [[Theurgy|theurgic]]-practical ascent, as in the story of the [[Midrash Eleh Ezkerah|Ten Martyrs]] who enquired in Heaven of the decree. In the Hekhalot literature, angels guarding each level are meditatively bound by formulae and seals to allow entry.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Medieval Hasidei Ashkenaz and the Sefer Yetzirah===
[[File:Ústěk Jewish museum.jpg|thumb|170px|right|[[Úštěk Synagogue]] with statue of Prague [[Golem]] at [[Úštěk]] in the Czech Republic]]
{{Main|Golem}}
In the 13th century, one problem which intrigued the [[Ashkenazi Hasidim]] (literally "the Pious of Germany") was the possibility of the creation of life through magical means. They used the word ''"[[golem]]"'' (literally, shapeless or lifeless matter) to refer to an hypothetical [[homunculus]] given life by means of the magical [[invocation]] of Divine names. This interest inspired an entire cycle of legend revolving around the ''golem'' which continued into the 18th century.&lt;ref name=Trachtenberg&gt;Trachtenberg, Joshua. ''Jewish Magic and Superstition'', pp. 84-86. New York: Behrman's Jewish Book House, 1939. Available online at [http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/jms/index.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of the ancient [[Sefer Yetzirah]], concerning the creative force of the Hebrew letters, as the means to create a golem was derived from interpretation of two statements in the [[Talmud#Babylonian Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]] [[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Tractate Sanhedrin]]. One relates that the Sage [[Rava (amora)|Rava]] created a person; in the second, two other Sages were studying "the laws of "creation" and created a "triple calf" that they ate for a celebration.&lt;ref&gt;''Kabbalah: a very short introduction'', [[Joseph Dan]], Oxford, p.106-107&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval separation of Conceptual and Practical Kabbalah===
{{See also|Kabbalah}}
The separation of the [[Mysticism|mystical]] and [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] elements of Kabbalah, dividing it into speculative [[Kabbalah|theological Kabbalah]] (''Kabbalah Iyyunit'') with its meditative traditions, and theurgic practical Kabbalah (''Kabbalah Ma'asit''), had occurred by the beginning of the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Josephy, Marcia Reines. ''Magic &amp; Superstition in the Jewish Tradition: An Exhibition Organized by the Maurice Spertus Museum of Judaica''. Spertus College of Judaica Press, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Many traditional speculative Kabbalists disapproved of practical Kabbalah, including [[Abraham Abulafia]], who strongly condemned it.&lt;ref name=Elber/&gt;{{Request quotation|date=February 2015}} While the great majority of historical Kabbalistic involvement, writing and development concerns the theological Kabbalah, the majority of practical Kabbalaistic writings were never published.&lt;ref&gt;''Thirty-Two Gates of Wisdom'', DovBer Pinson, Ben Yehuda Press, p.3-5&lt;/ref&gt;

One important tradition of practical Kabbalah thrived in Spain during the second half of the 15th century, before the [[Alhambra Decree]]. The main text of the tradition was called ''Sepher ha-Mashiv''. The practitioners of this tradition were described by [[Moshe Idel]] as "interested in demonology and the use of coercive incantations to summon demons, angels, and even God"&lt;ref&gt;Idel, Moshe. ''Kabbalah: New Perspectives''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988, p. 269 (as quoted in Girón-Negrón, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; in order to hasten the [[Messianic Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Girón-Negrón, Luis M. ''Alfonso de la Torre's Visión Deleytable: Philosophical Rationalism and the Religious Imagination in 15th Century Spain''. BRILL, 2001. {{ISBN|90-04-11957-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Della Reina's (1418–1472) failure with his students in this, was considered a warning by later Kabbalists of the potential perils of involvement with Kabbalistic practice.&lt;ref&gt;''Thirty-Two Gates of Wisdom'' DovBer Pinson, p 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ban of Safed Kabbalistic Renaissance===
In the 16th century [[Isaac Luria]], who opposed ''Kabbalah Ma'asit'' and forbade his students from writing amulets and using other techniques of practical Kabbalah, evolved a form of exorcism which effectively transferred techniques from practical to speculative Kabbalah. While this led to the displacement of magical formulas and rites by contemplative exercises, the old forms of practical Kabbalah continued to exert broad appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Chajes, Jeffrey Howard. ''Between Worlds: Dybbuks, Exorcists, and Early Modern Judaism'', pp. 84&amp;ndash;85. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8122-3724-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luria's position as the central teacher of modern Kabbalah, the foundation for later [[Hasidism]], gives his proscription authoritative force. He taught that in our generations, without the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] and its ashes of the [[Red Heifer]] to purify, the pursuit of the realm of practical Kabbalah by a person with an impure body is very detrimental.&lt;ref name="What is Practical Kabbalah"&gt;[http://www.inner.org/kabbalah/beginner/practical.htm What is Practical Kabbalah?] from www.inner.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern Baalei Shem and other developments===
The traditional role of the [[Baal Shem]] healer involved accepted methods between borderline practical Kabbalah and meditative Kabbalah, such as amulets and [[parapsychology|psychic]] abilities.&lt;ref name=Ginsburgh&gt;Ginsburgh, Yitzchak. [http://www.inner.org/kabbalah/beginner/amulets.htm Are Amulets Considered Practical Kabbalah?] from www.inner.org&lt;/ref&gt; Among recorded figures from early-modern times were [[Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm]] (1550–1583) and the [[Baal Shem of London]] (1708–1782). Yisrael [[Baal Shem Tov]] began his activity as a traditional Baal Shem, before founding Hasidism. While the association of the [[Maharal]] of Prague (1520–1609) with the creation of a golem only emerged in later times, contemporary tradition records Elijah Baal Shem as creating a golem. The [[Sabbatean]] mystical heresies of [[Sabbatai Zevi]] (1626–1676) and [[Jacob Frank]] (1726–1791) led to the 1750s accusation of [[Jonathan Eybeschutz]] by [[Jacob Emden]] of being a secret Sabbatean. It was chiefly based on the interpretation of some amulets prepared by Eybeschutz, in which Emden saw Sabbatean allusions. The leader of [[Mitnagdic]] Lithuanian Judaism, the Kabbalist [[Vilna Gaon]] (1720–1797), related that in his youth he had attempted to make a golem, but stopped when he perceived a spirit of impurity involved.&lt;ref&gt;''The Vilna Gaon: The Life and Teachings of Rabbi Eliyahu the Gaon of Vilna'', ArtScroll History publications, Betzalel Landau and Yonason Rosenblum&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Aharon Yehuda of Chelm, a practitioner of practical Kabbalh, and baal shem, was said to have created a golem through use of the divine name.&lt;ref&gt;The Besht: Magician, Mystic, and Leader, Immanuel Etkes, UPNE, 2012 - Biography &amp; Autobiography, pg 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Yhitzak Ayhiz Halpern, a practitioner of practical Kabbalh, and baal shem, was said to have saved a ship from capsizing, and to exorcised a [[dybbuk]].&lt;ref&gt;The Besht: Magician, Mystic, and Leader, Immanuel Etkes, UPNE, 2012 - Biography &amp; Autobiography, pg 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Naftali Katz of Posnan was said to have brought a dead man back to life to free his wife from [[agunah]].&lt;ref&gt;The Besht: Magician, Mystic, and Leader, Immanuel Etkes, UPNE, 2012 - Biography &amp; Autobiography, pg 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Hirsch Fraenkel was sentenced to imprisonment in Germany in 1713, on the basis of having a library of books said to contain examples of sorcery, such as how to use oaths, and amulets to overcome demons, see the future, and speak to the dead.&lt;ref&gt;The Besht: Magician, Mystic, and Leader, Immanuel Etkes, UPNE, 2012 - Biography &amp; Autobiography, pg 26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divine intercession through Deveikut by the Hasidic Tzadik===
{{Main|Tzadik}}
In Hasidism, the displacement of practical Kabbalah by conceptual and meditative trends gained much further emphasis. Hasidism internalised Kabbalah through the psychology of [[deveikut]] (cleaving to God), and cleaving to the [[Tzadik]] (Hasidic Rebbe). In Hasidic doctrine, the tzaddik channels Divine spiritual and physical bounty to his followers by altering the Will of God (uncovering a deeper Will) through his own deveikut and [[Ayin and Yesh|self-nullification]]. [[Dov Ber of Mezeritch]] is concerned to distinguish this theory of prayer from contemplative magical process.&lt;ref&gt;''Studies in East European Jewish Mysticism and Hasidism'', Joseph Weiss, Littman Library; chapter: "The Saddik - Altering the Divine Will''&lt;/ref&gt; This rendered the external methods of practical Kabbalah unnecessary and a hindrance, though some Hasidic leaders retained use of accepted amulets.

This change was manifested in the personal life of Hasidism's founder, the Baal Shem Tov (1698–1760), in his move from [[Baal Shem]] to the prototype of Hasidic leader. While a Baal Shem, he used amulets. At the end of his life, the Ba'al Shem Tov never wrote the Names of God, only his own name in amulets, Yisrael ben Sara or Yisrael ben Eliezer.&lt;ref name=Ginsburgh/&gt; A traditional story relates that on one early occasion, the Baal Shem Tov resorted to practical Kabbalistic names of God, to cross a river and save his life. Afterward, he regretted this, even though he had used it in holiness. He knew that his [[Teshuvah|repentance]] was accepted when later, he found himself again in a similar situation. This time he did not use practical Kabbalah to perform the miracle, but instead used faith to give him the miraculous supernatural power to cross the river. He then knew that his teshuvah was complete.&lt;ref name="What is Practical Kabbalah"/&gt; [[Hasidic thought]] teaches that its internalised mysticism enables the soul to affect the world through its [[Atzmus|essential]] connection to God, rather than [[Ohr|Divine manifestations]] of Kabbalah.

Despite the prohibition against divination of the future, there is no prohibition against understanding the past nor coming to a greater understanding of present and future situations through inspiration gained by the Kabbalah (a subtle distinction and one often hard to delineate). The appeal to [[occult]] power outside the monotheist deity for [[divination]] purpose is unacceptable in Judaism, but at the same time it is held that the righteous have access to occult knowledge. Such knowledge can come through [[dream]]s and [[Incubation (ritual)|incubation]] (inducing clairvoyant dreams), metoscopy (reading faces, lines on the face, or [[Aura (paranormal)|auras]] emanating from the face), ''[[ibbur]]im'' and ''[[Magid (Jewish mysticism)|maggidim]]'' (spirit possession), and/or various methods of [[scrying]].&lt;ref&gt;see Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg, ''[[Sefer Chasidim]]'' {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}, and Rabbi Hayyim Vital, ''Sefer ha-Hezyonot'' (translated as ''Book of Visions'' in Faierstein, 1999 {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sefer raziel segulot.png|thumb|150px|left|An excerpt from [[Sefer Raziel HaMalakh]], featuring various magical [[Sigil (magic)|sigils]] (סגולות ''segulot'' in Hebrew)]]
The Midrash and Talmud are replete with the use of names of God and incantations that are claimed to effect supernatural or [[theurgy|theurgic]] results. Most post-Talmudic [[rabbinical literature]] seeks to curb the use of any or most of these formulae, termed ''Kabbalah Ma'asit'' ("practical Kabbalah"). There are various arguments for this; one stated by the Medieval Rabbi [[Yaakov ben Moshe Levi Moelin]] is that the person using it may lack the required grounding, and the ritual would be ineffective.

Yet the interest in these rituals of power continued largely unabated until recently. The Talmud  mentions the use of charms for healing, and a wide range of magical cures were sanctioned by rabbis. It was ruled that any practice actually producing a cure was not to be considered superstitious and there has been the widespread practice of medicinal amulets, and folk remedies ''(segullot)'' in Jewish societies across time and geography.&lt;ref&gt;Person, Hara E.

==History==
In 1219 [[Genghis Khan]] invited Changchun to visit him&lt;ref name=lichichang&gt;{{cite web|last=Li|first=Chi Ch'ang|title=1220 - 1223 : The Travels of Ch'ang Ch'un to the West|url=http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/changchun.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rossabi2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Morris Rossabi|title=From Yuan to Modern China and Mongolia: The Writings of Morris Rossabi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GXejBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA425&amp;lpg=PA425#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=28 November 2014|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-28529-3|pages=425–}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a letter dated 15 May 1219 by present reckoning. Changchun left his home in [[Shandong]] in February 1220 and journeyed to [[Beijing]]. Learning that Genghis had gone West, he spent winter there. In February 1221, Changchun left, traversing eastern [[Mongolia]] to the camp of Genghis' youngest brother Otchigin near Lake Buyur in the upper Kerulen - today's [[Kherlen]]-[[Amur River|Amur]] basin. From there he traveled southwestward up the Kerulen, crossing the [[Karakorum]] region in north-central Mongolia, and arrived at the [[Altai Mountains]], probably passing near the present [[Uliastai]]. After traversing the Altai he visited Bishbalig - modern [[Ürümqi]] - and moved along the north side of the [[Tian Shan]] range to Lake Sutkol, today's Sairam, [[Almaliq, Xinjiang|Almaliq]] (or [[Yining City]]), and the rich valley of the [[Ili River|Ili]].

From there, Changchun passed to [[Balasagun]] and [[Chu River|Shu River]], and across that river to [[Taraz|Talas]] and the [[Tashkent]] region, and then over the [[Syr Darya]] to [[Samarkand]], where he halted for some months. Finally, through the Iron Gates of Termit, over the [[Amu Darya]], and by way of [[Balkh]] and northern [[Afghanistan]], Changchun reached Genghis' camp near the [[Hindu Kush]].

Changchun, had been invited to satisfy the interest of [[Genghis Khan]] in "the [[philosopher's stone]]" and the secret medicine of immortality. He explained the Taoist philosophy and the many ways to prolong life and was honest in saying there was no secret medicine of immortality.&lt;ref name=chinggis /&gt; The two had 12 in-depth conversations.&lt;ref name="Qiuchuji"&gt;(Chinese) [http://news.163.com/14/1020/08/A90521TR00014Q4P.html 胡刃, "成吉思汗与丘处机" 北方新报(呼和浩特)] 2014-10-20&lt;/ref&gt;  Genghis Khan honoured him with the title [[Xian (Taoism)|Spirit Immortal]].&lt;ref name=qtbta /&gt; Genghis also made Changchun in charge of all religious persons in the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=giThXv6OvSAC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;dq=1219+daoist+afghanistan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QXu-WjCAUv&amp;sig=GX9vXE9dxJQvrWNnqz2fqLmKZ48&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Wl91Tv2oD6e70AHd6YnuDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Taoism: the parting of the way |author=Holmes Welch|accessdate=2011-11-28 |edition=revised |series= |volume= |date= |year=1966 |month= |publisher=Beacon Press |location= |language= |isbn=0-8070-5973-0 |page=154 |pages= |issue=Issue 224 of Beacon paperbacks |quote=The Sung was succeeded by the dynasty of the Mongol invaders, or the Yuan. The Yuan saw the zenith of Taoist political fortunes. In 1219 Chingiz Khan, who was at that time in the west, summoned the Taoist monk Ch'ang Ch'un to come and preach to him. Ch'ang Ch'un had succeeded Wang Che as head of the Northern School in 1170; he was now seventy-one years old. Four years later, after a tremendous journey across Central Asia, he reached Imperial headquarters in Afghanistan. When he arrived, he lectured Chingiz on the art of nourishing the vital spirit. "To take medicine for a thousand years," he said, "does less good than to be alone for a single night." Such forthright injunctions to subdue the flesh pleased the great conqueror, who wrote Ch'ang Ch'un after his return to China, asking that he "recite scriptures on my behalf and pray for my longevity." In 1227 Chingiz decreed that all priests and persons of religion in his empire were to be under Ch'ang Chun's control and that his jurisdiction over the Taoist community was to be absolute. On paper, at least, no Taoist before or since has ever had such power. It did not last long, for both Chingiz and Ch'ang died that same year (1227). }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LPs9OEZqeH4C&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=1219+daoist+afghanistan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_Jw4DEJFIm&amp;sig=sJ4vzaIDY1TAH--rj-UF5OqnCfk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Wl91Tv2oD6e70AHd6YnuDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Tao of health, sex, and longevity: a modern practical guide to the ancient way |author=Daniel P.

Returning home, Changchun largely followed his outward route, with certain deviations, such as a visit to [[Hohhot]]. He was back in Beijing by the end of January 1224. From the narrative of his expedition, ''[[Travels to the West of Qiu Chang Chun]]'' written by his pupil and companion Li Zhichang,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|jstor=41930343|journal=Journal of Asian History|title=SINO-KHITAN ADMINISTRATION IN MONGOL BUKHARA|last=BUELL|first=PAUL D.|volume=Vol. 13|number=No. 2|date=1979|pages=135–8|publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; we derive some of the most vivid pictures ever drawn of nature and man between the [[Great Wall of China]] and [[Kabul]], between the [[Aral Sea|Aral]] and [[Yellow Sea]]s.

Of particular interest are the sketches of the Mongols and the people of [[Samarkand]] and its vicinity, the account of the land and products of Samarkand in the Ili Valley at or near Almalig-Kulja, and the description of various great mountain ranges, peaks and [[defile (geography)|defiles]], such as the Chinese [[Altai Mountains|Altay]], the [[Tian Shan]], [[Bogda Shan|Bogdo Uula]], and the Iron Gates of Termit. There is, moreover, a noteworthy reference to a land apparently identical with the uppermost valley of the [[Yenisei]].

After his return, Changchun lived in Beijing until his death on 23 July 1227. By order of Genghis Khan, some of the former imperial garden grounds were given to him for the foundation of a Taoist [[White Cloud Temple|Monastery of the White Clouds]]&lt;ref name=lichichang /&gt; that exists to this day.

==Fiction==
Qiu Chuji appears as a character in [[Jin Yong]]'s ''[[Legend of the Condor Heroes]]'', ''[[Return of the Condor Heroes]]'', and the 2013 film ''[[An End to Killing]]''. In Jin Yong's work he is very different from the real persona, described as a 'bullheaded priest' who gets into fights and contests with rivals, very contrary to what his religion preaches. His deeds shape much of the future of the 2 main male characters of the first story.

Buddhists take '''refuge''' in the Three Jewels or Triple Gem (also known as the "Three Refuges").

The Three Jewels are:
* [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]], the fully enlightened one
* the [[Dharma]], the teachings expounded by the Buddha
* the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], the monastic order of Buddhism that practice the Dharma

Refuge is common to all major schools of Buddhism.  Pali texts employ the [[Hinduism|Brahmanical]] motif of a group of three refuges, as found in [[Rig Veda]] 9.97.47, Rig Veda 6.46.9 and [[Chandogya Upanishad]] 2.22.3-4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shults|first1=Brett|title=On the Buddha’s Use of Some Brahmanical Motifs in Pali Texts|journal=Journal of the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies|date=May 2014|volume=6|page=119|url=http://jocbs.org/index.php/jocbs/article/view/76/96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Faith in Buddhism}}
Faith is an important teaching element in both [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana]] traditions. In contrast to perceived Western notions of faith, faith in Buddhism arises from accumulated experience and [[reason]]ing.

In the ''[[Kalama Sutra]]'', the Buddha explicitly argues against simply following [[authority]] or [[tradition]], particularly those of religions contemporary to the Buddha's time.&lt;ref name="Soma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/soma/wheel008.html|title=Kalama Sutta: The Buddha's Charter of Free Inquiry|date=4 February 2013|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204141603/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/soma/wheel008.html|archivedate=4 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There remains value for a degree of trusting confidence and belief in Buddhism, primarily in the spiritual attainment and salvation or [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]]. Faith in Buddhism centres on belief in the Three Jewels.

# to refrain from consuming intoxicants.&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In [[Early Buddhist Texts]], the role of the five precepts gradually developed. First of all, the precepts were combined with a declaration of faith in the triple gem (the Buddha, [[dhamma|his teaching]] and [[sangha|the monastic community]]).&lt;!--173--&gt; Next, the precepts developed to become the foundation of lay practice.&lt;!--173-4--&gt;{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |pp=173{{en dash}}4}} The precepts were seen a preliminary condition for the higher development of the mind.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=178}} At a third stage in the texts, the precepts were actually mentioned together with the triple gem, as though they were part of it. Lastly, the precepts, together with the triple gem, became a required condition for the practice of Buddhism, as lay people had to undergo a formal initiation to become a member of the Buddhist religion.{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |p=173}} When Buddhism spread to different places and people, the role of the precepts began to vary. In countries in which Buddhism was adopted as the main religion without much competition from other religious disciplines, such as Thailand, the relation between the initiation of a lay person and the five precepts has been virtually non-existent, and the taking of the precepts has become a sort of ritual cleansing ceremony. In such countries, people are presumed Buddhist from birth without much of an initiation. The precepts are often committed to by new followers as part of their installment, yet this is not very pronounced. However, in some countries like China, where Buddhism was not the only religion, the precepts became an ordination ceremony to initiate lay people into the Buddhist religion.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |pp=178{{en dash}}9, 205}}

A layperson who upholds the precepts is described in the texts as a "jewel among laymen".{{sfn |De Silva |2016 |page=63 }}

== Three Roots ==
{{Main|Three Roots}}
[[File:Three Jewels symbol colour.svg|thumb|Symbol of the Three Jewels|274x274px]]
In [[Tibetan Buddhism]] there are three refuge formulations, the ''Outer'', ''Inner'', and ''Secret'' forms of the Three Jewels. The 'Outer' form is the 'Triple Gem', (Sanskrit:''triratna''), the 'Inner' is the Three Roots and the 'Secret' form is the 'Three Bodies' or [[trikaya]] of a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]. These alternative refuge formulations are employed by those undertaking [[Deity Yoga]] and other [[Vajrayana|tantric]] practices within the [[Tibetan Buddhist]] [[Vajrayana]] tradition as a means of recognizing [[Buddha Nature]].
{{Tibetan Buddhist Refuge Formulations}}

Three refuge motivation levels are: 1) suffering rebirth's fear motivates with the idea of happiness, 2) knowing rebirth won’t bring freedoms motivated by attaining nirvana, while 3) seeing other’s suffering motivates establishing them all in Buddhahood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rinpoche|first1=Patrul|title=Words of My Perfect Teacher: A Complete Translation of a Classic Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism (Sacred Literature)|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-16532-3|pages=176–177|edition=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Happiness is temporary, lifetimes are impermanent and ultimately refuge is taken until reaching unsurpassed awakening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dorje|first1=Choying Tobden|last2=Zangpo|first2=Ngawang|title=The Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra, Books 1 to 10: Foundations of the Buddhist Path|date=June 2, 2015|publisher=Snow Lion|isbn=1-55939-435-8|pages=224–227|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2017}}

'''Religious pluralism''' is an attitude or policy regarding the diversity of [[religion|religious]] [[belief system]]s co-existing in society. It can indicate one or more of the following:

* As the name of the worldview according to which one's own religion is not held to be the sole and exclusive source of truth, and thus the acknowledgement that at least some truths and true values exist in other religions.
* As acceptance of the concept that two or more religions with mutually exclusive truth claims are equally valid, this may be considered a form of either [[toleration]] (a concept that arose as a result of the [[European wars of religion]]) or [[moral relativism]].
* The understanding that the exclusive claims of different religions turn out, upon closer examination, to be variations of universal truths that have been taught since time immemorial. This is called ''Perennialism'' (based on the concept of ''[[Perennial philosophy|philosophia perennis]]'') or [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalism]].
* Sometimes as a synonym for [[ecumenism]], i.e., the promotion of some level of unity, co-operation, and improved understanding between different religions or different [[Religious denomination|denomination]]s within a single religion.
* As a term for the condition of harmonious co-existence between adherents of different [[religion]]s or [[religious denomination]]s.
*As a [[social norm]] and not merely a synonym for religious diversity.&lt;ref name="Silk 64–81"&gt;{{Citation | last = Silk | first = Mark| title = Defining Religious Pluralism in America: A Regional Analysis | volume = 612 | pages = 64–81

{{Main|Religious tolerance}}
Religious pluralism, to paraphrase the title of a recent academic work, goes beyond mere toleration. Chris Beneke, in ''Beyond Toleration: The Religious Origins of American Pluralism'', explains the difference between religious tolerance and religious pluralism by pointing to the situation in the late 18th century [[United States]]. By the 1730s, in most colonies religious minorities had obtained what contemporaries called [[religious tolerance|religious toleration]]:&lt;ref name="Beneke06-6"&gt;Beneke 2006: 6.&lt;/ref&gt; "The policy of toleration relieved religious minorities of some physical punishments and some financial burdens, but it did not make them free from the indignities of prejudice and exclusion. Nor did it make them equal. Those 'tolerated' could still be barred from civil offices, military positions, and university posts."&lt;ref name="Beneke06-6"/&gt; In short, religious toleration is only the absence of [[religious persecution]], and does not necessarily preclude [[religious discrimination]]. However, in the following decades something extraordinary happened in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], at least if one views the events from "a late eighteenth-century perspective".&lt;ref name="Beneke06-5"&gt;Beneke 2006: 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually the colonial governments expanded the policy of religious toleration, but then, between the 1760s and the 1780s, they replaced it with "something that is usually called [[Freedom of religion|religious liberty]]".&lt;ref name="Beneke06-6"/&gt; Mark Silka, in "Defining Religious Pluralism in America: A Regional Analysis", states that Religious pluralism "enables a country made up of people of different faiths to exist without sectarian warfare or the persecution of religious minorities. Understood differently in different times and places, it is a [[cultural construct]] that embodies some shared conception of how a country's various religious communities relate to each other and to the larger nation whole."&lt;ref name="Silk 64–81"/&gt;

Religious pluralism can be defined as "respecting the otherness of others". Freedom of religion encompasses all religions acting within the law in a particular region. [[Exclusivist]] religions teach that theirs is the only way to salvation and to religious truth, and some of them would even argue that it is necessary to suppress the falsehoods taught by other religions. Some [[Protestant]] [[sect]]s argue fiercely against [[Roman Catholicism]], and [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]] of all kinds teach that religious practices like those of [[paganism]] and [[witchcraft]] are pernicious.  This was a common historical attitude prior to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and has appeared as governmental policy into the present day under systems like [[Afghanistan]]'s [[Taliban]] regime, which destroyed the ancient [[Buddhas of Bamyan]].

Giving one religion or denomination special rights that are denied to others can weaken religious pluralism. This situation was observed in Europe through the [[Lateran Treaty]] and [[Church of England]]. In modern era, many Islamic countries have laws that criminalize the act of leaving Islam to someone born in Muslim family, forbid entry to non-Muslims into Mosques, and forbid construction of Church, Synagogue or Temples inside their countries.&lt;ref name=meister&gt;Chad Meister (2010), The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195340136}}, pp 32-57&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Relativism]], the belief that all religions are equal in their value and that none of the religions give access to absolute truth, is an extreme form of [[inclusivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carm.org/what-relativism|title=What is relativism?|work=CARM - The Christian Apologetics &amp; Research Ministry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[syncretism]], the attempt to take over creeds of practices from other religions or even to blend practices or creeds from different religions into one new faith is an extreme form of inter-religious dialogue. [[Syncretism]] must not be confused with [[ecumenism]], the attempt to bring closer and eventually reunite different denominations of one religion that have a common origin but were separated by a [[Schism (religion)|schism]].

{{Main|History of religious pluralism}}
[[Cultural pluralism|Cultural]] and religious pluralism has a long history and development that reaches from antiquity to contemporary trends in [[post-modernity]].

Feuerbauch and [[Ernst Troeltsch]] concluded that Asian religious traditions, in particular Hinduism and Buddhism were earliest proponents of religious pluralism and granting of freedom to the individual to choose the faith and develop a personal religious construct within it.&lt;ref name=meister2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roof &amp; McKinney (1985), Denominational America and the new religious pluralism, The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 480(1), pp. 24-38&lt;/ref&gt; Jainism, another ancient Indian religion, as well as Daoism have also always been inclusively flexible and have long favored religious pluralism for those who disagree with their religious viewpoints.&lt;ref name=meister2&gt;Chad Meister (2010), The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195340136}}, pp 62-72&lt;/ref&gt; The Age of Enlightenment in Europe triggered a sweeping transformation about religion, segregation of state and religion, with rising acceptance of religious pluralism. These pluralist trends in Western thought, particularly since the 18th century, brought mainstream Christianity and Judaism closer to the Asian traditions of philosophical pluralism, states Chad Meister.&lt;ref name=meister2/&gt;

==Bahá'í Faith==
{{Main|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion}}
[[Bahá'u'lláh]], founder of [[Bahá'í Faith]], a religion that developed in Persia, though not a sect of Islam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bci.org/islam-bahai/SectIslam.htm|title=Not a Sect|work=bci.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215112206/http://bci.org/islam-bahai/SectIslam.htm|archivedate=2005-12-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; urged the elimination of religious intolerance. He taught that God is one, and has manifested himself to humanity through several historic messengers. Bahá'u'lláh taught that Bahá'ís must associate with peoples of all religions, showing the love of God in relations with them, whether this is reciprocated or not.

Bahá'í's refer to the concept of [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|Progressive revelation]], which means that God's will is revealed to mankind progressively as mankind matures and is better able to comprehend the purpose of God in creating humanity. In this view, God's word is revealed through a series of messengers: [[Abraham]], [[Krishna]], [[Moses]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Jesus]], [[Mohammed]], and Bahá'u'lláh (the founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]) among them. In the ''[[Kitáb-i-Íqán]]'' (''Book of Certitude''), Bahá'u'lláh explains that messengers of God have a twofold station, one of divinity and one of an individual. According to Bahá'í writings, there will not be another messenger for many hundreds of years. There is also a respect for the religious traditions of the native peoples of the planet who may have little other than oral traditions as a record of their religious figures.

==Buddhism==
The earliest reference to Buddhist views on religious pluralism in a political sense is found in the [[Edicts of Ashoka|Edicts of Emperor Ashoka]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All religions should reside everywhere, for all of them desire self-control and purity of heart. Rock Edict Nb7 (S. Dhammika)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Contact (between religions) is good. One should listen to and respect the doctrines professed by others. Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, desires that all should be well-learned in the good doctrines of other religions. Rock Edict Nb12 (S. Dhammika)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When asked, "Don’t all religions teach the same thing? Is it possible to unify them?" the Dalai Lama said:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/article-8376?l=english ''Dalai Lama Asks West Not to Turn Buddhism Into a "Fashion"''], Zenit, 2003-10-08, retrieved 2009-06-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
People from different traditions should keep their own, rather than change. However, some Tibetan may prefer Islam, so he can follow it. Some Spanish prefer Buddhism; so follow it. But think about it carefully. Don’t do it for fashion. Some people start Christian, follow Islam, then Buddhism, then nothing.

In the United States I have seen people who embrace Buddhism and change their clothes! Like the New Age. They take something Hindu, something Buddhist, something, something… That is not healthy.

For individual practitioners, having one truth, one religion, is very important. Several truths, several religions, is contradictory.

I am Buddhist. Therefore, Buddhism is the only truth for me, the only religion. To my Christian friend, Christianity is the only truth, the only religion. To my Muslim friend, [Islam] is the only truth, the only religion. In the meantime, I respect and admire my Christian friend and my Muslim friend. If by unifying you mean mixing, that is impossible; useless.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Classical Greek and Roman paganism==
{{See also|Syncretism}}
Ancient Greeks employed ''[[Interpretatio Graeca]]'' whereby the gods of other religions were equated with those of their own [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. The Romans easily accomplished this task by subsuming the entire set of gods from other faiths into their own religion. This was done on rare occasion by adding a new god to their own pantheon; on most occasions they identified another religion's gods with their own.

==Christianity==
{{Main|Christianity and other religions}}
{{See also|Ecumenism}}
Some Christians&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christians.eu/why-jesus/ Why Jesus?] Article stating that Jesus is the saviour and not Mohammed or Buddha—see second part of this article.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that religious pluralism is an invalid or self-contradictory concept based upon passages of the Bible such as:
{{blockquote|
Acts 4:12 (KJV): 
12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

1 Timothy 2:5 (KJV): 
5 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;

John 14:6 (KJV):
6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

Acts 17:29 (KJV):
29 Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.

Exodus 20:3 (KJV):
3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

Exodus 34:14 (KJV):
14 For thou shalt worship no other god; for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:

Mark 12:32 (KJV):
32 And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:
}}

Maximal forms of religious pluralism claim that all religions are equally true, or that one religion can be true for some and another for others. Some Christians hold this idea to be [[logic]]ally impossible from the [[Principle of contradiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianministriesintl.org/articles/12.html Defending Salvation Through Christ Alone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003214003/http://www.christianministriesintl.org/articles/12.html |date=2009-10-03 }} By Jason Carlson, Christian Ministries International&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Christians have held that there can be truth value and salvific value in other faith traditions. [[John Macquarrie]], described in the ''Handbook of Anglican Theologians'' (1998) as "unquestionably [[Anglicanism]]'s most distinguished systematic theologian in the second half of the twentieth century",&lt;ref&gt;p. 168, Timothy Bradshaw (1998), "John Macquarrie," in: Alister E. McGrath (ed). ''[https://books.google.com/books?client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1&amp;id=ZHzZAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=9780281051458&amp;q=macquarrie#search_anchor The SPCK Handbook of Anglican Theologians]'' (pp. 167-168). London: [[SPCK]]. {{ISBN|978-0-281-05145-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that "there should be an end to proselytizing but that equally there should be no syncretism of the kind typified by the [[Baha'i]] movement" (p.&amp;nbsp;2).&lt;ref name=macmediate&gt;John Macquarrie (1996). ''Mediators between human and divine: From Moses to Muhammad''. New York: Continuum. {{ISBN|0-8264-1170-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In discussing 9 founders of major faith traditions (Moses, Zoroaster, Lao-zu, Buddha, Confucius, Socrates, Krishna, Jesus, and Muhammad), which he called "mediators between the human and the divine", Macquarrie wrote that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I do not deny for a moment that the truth of God has reached others through other channels - indeed, I hope and pray that it has. So while I have a special attachment to one mediator, I have respect for them all. (p. 12)&lt;ref name=macmediate/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] also teaches a form of religious pluralism, that there is at least some truth in almost all religions and philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/ensign/1977/10/respect-for-other-peoples-beliefs?lang=eng |title=Respect for Other People’s Beliefs |author=Gerald E. Jones |publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] |work=''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'' |date=October 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Christian views===
Before the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]], mainstream Christianity confessed "one holy catholic and apostolic church", in the words of the [[Nicene Creed]]. [[Roman Catholic]]s, Orthodox Christians, [[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]]s and most Protestant Christian denominations still maintain this belief. Furthermore, the [[Catholic Church]] makes the claim that is the [[one true church|one and only true Church]] founded by [[Jesus Christ]], but the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches also make this claim in respect to themselves.

Church unity for these groups, as in the past, is something very visible and tangible, and schism was just as serious an offense as heresy. Following the Great Schism, Roman Catholicism sees and recognizes the Orthodox Sacraments as valid but illicit and without canonical jurisdiction. Eastern Orthodoxy does not have the concept of "validity" when applied to Sacraments, but it considers the ''form'' of Roman Catholic Sacraments to be acceptable, and there is some recognition of Catholic sacraments among some, but not all, Orthodox. Both generally mutually regard each other as "[[heresy|heterodox]]" and "[[schism]]atic", while continuing to recognize each other as Christian, at least [[secundum quid]]. (See [[ecumenicism]]).

===Modern Christian views===
Some other Protestants hold that only believers who believe in certain fundamental doctrines know the true pathway to salvation. The core of this doctrine is that Jesus Christ was a perfect man, is the Son of God and that he died and rose again for the wrongdoing of those who will accept the gift of salvation.  They continue to believe in "one" church, believing in fundamental issues there is unity and non-fundamental issues there is liberty. Some [[evangelical]]s are doubtful if Roman Catholicism or Eastern Orthodoxy are still valid manifestations of the Church and usually reject religious (typically [[restorationist]]) movements rooted in 19th century American Christianity, such as [[Mormonism]], [[Christian Science]], or [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] as not distinctly Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apologeticsindex.org/d01b.html#prot |title=The Protestant Principle |website=A Biblical Guide To Orthodoxy And Heresy |access-date=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==

[[Hinduism]] is naturally pluralistic. A well-known ''[[Rig Veda|Rig Vedic]]'' hymn says: "Truth is One, though the sages know it variously" (''Ékam sat vipra bahudā vadanti'').&lt;ref&gt;Rig Veda 1.164.46&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavad Gītā]]'' (4:11), God, manifesting as an incarnation, states: "As people approach me, so I receive them. All paths lead to me" (''ye yathā māṃ prapadyante tāṃs tathāiva bhajāmyaham mama vartmānuvartante manuṣyāḥ pārtha sarvaśaḥ'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=56UM3BIvbHYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=easwaran+1586380273&amp;lr=&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=as%20people%20approach%20me&amp;f=false Page 194] in [[Eknath Easwaran]] (2008).

[[Hinduism]] emphasizes that everyone actually worships the same God, whether one knows it or not.&lt;ref&gt;See Swami Bhaskarananda, ''Essentials of Hinduism'' (Viveka Press 2002) {{ISBN|1-884852-04-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as Hindus worshiping [[Ganesh]] is seen as valid by those worshiping [[Vishnu]], so someone worshiping Jesus or Allah is accepted. Many ''foreign'' deities become assimilated into Hinduism, and some Hindus may sometimes offer prayers to Jesus along with their traditional forms of [[God in Hinduism|God]].

==Islam==
{{POV-section|date=March 2015}}
{{Main|Islam and other religions}}
Religious pluralism is a controversial subject in Islam. The primary sources that guide Islam, namely [[Quran]] and [[hadith]]s, offer contradictory positions on religious pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;Cole &amp; Hammond (1974), Religious pluralism, legal development, and societal complexity: rudimentary forms of civil religion, Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Vol. 13, No. 2, pp. 177-189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mb&gt;Michael Bonner (2008), Jihad in Islamic History: Doctrines and Practice, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691138381}}, pp. 23-31&lt;/ref&gt; Some verses support religious pluralism, while others discourage it. The acceptability of religious pluralism within Islam remains a topic of active debate.

In several [[Sura]]h, Quran asks Muslims to remain steadfast with Islam, and not yield to the vain desires of other religions and unbelievers. These verses have been interpreted to imply pluralism in religions. For example, [[Al-Ma'ida|Surah Al-Ma'idah]] verses 47 through 49 state:
{{quote
|Let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah hath revealed therein. If any do fail to judge by the light of what Allah hath revealed, they are no better than those who rebel. To thee We sent the Scripture in truth, confirming the scripture that came before it, and guarding it in safety: so judge between them by what Allah hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, diverging from the Truth that hath come to thee. To each among you have we prescribed a law and an open way. '''If Allah had so willed, He would have made you a single people''', but His plan is to test you in what He hath given you: so strive as in a race in all virtues. The goal of you all is to Allah; it is He that will show you the truth of the matters in which ye dispute; And this (He commands): Judge thou between them by what Allah hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, but beware of them lest they beguile thee from any of that (teaching) which Allah hath sent down to thee. And if they turn away, be assured that for some of their crime it is Allah's purpose to punish them. And truly most men are rebellious. ({{cite quran|5|47|end=49|style=nosup}}) }}

Surah Al-Ankabut verse 45 through 47 state:
{{quote
|Recite what is sent of the Book by inspiration to thee, and establish regular Prayer: for Prayer restrains from shameful and unjust deeds; and remembrance of Allah is the greatest thing in life without doubt. And Allah knows the deeds that ye do. And dispute ye not with the People of the Book, except with means better than mere disputation, unless it be with those of them who inflict wrong (and injury): but say, "We believe in the revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you; '''Our Allah and your Allah is one'''; and it is to Him we bow in Islam." And thus it is that We have sent down the Book to thee. So the [[People of the Book]] believe therein, as also do some of these pagan Arabs: and none but Unbelievers reject our signs. ({{cite quran|29|45|end=47|style=nosup}}) }}

Surah Al-E-Imran verses 62 through 66 state:
{{quote
|This is the true account: There is no god except Allah; and Allah-He is indeed the Exalted in Power, the Wise. But if they turn back, Allah hath full knowledge of those who do mischief. Say: "O People of the Book! '''come to common terms as between us and you: That we worship none but Allah'''; that we associate no partners with him; that we erect not, from among ourselves, Lords and patrons other than Allah." If then they turn back, say ye: "Bear witness that we at least are Muslims bowing to Allah's Will. Ye People of the Book! Why dispute ye about Abraham, when the Law and the Gospel Were not revealed Till after him? Have ye no understanding? Ah! Ye are those who fell to disputing even in matters of which ye had some knowledge! but why dispute ye in matters of which ye have no knowledge? It is Allah Who knows, and ye who know not! ({{cite quran|3|62|end=66|style=nosup}}) }}

Surah Al-Kafiroon verse 1 through 6 state:
{{quote
|Say : O ye that reject Faith! I worship not that which ye worship, nor will ye worship that which I worship. And I will not worship that which ye have been wont to worship, nor will ye worship that which I worship. To you be your Way, and to me mine. ({{cite quran|109|1|end=6|style=nosup}}) }}

Several verses of the [[Quran]]  state that Islam rejects religious pluralism. For example, Surah Al-Tawba verse 1 through 5 seems to command the Muslim to slay the [[pagan]]s (with verse 9.5 called the 'sword verse'):&lt;ref name=mb/&gt; 
{{quote|
A (declaration) of immunity from Allah and His Messenger, to those of the Pagans with whom ye have contracted mutual alliances:- Go ye, then, for four months, backwards and forwards, (as ye will), throughout the land, but know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah (by your falsehood) but that Allah will cover with shame those who reject Him. And an announcement from Allah and His Messenger, to the people (assembled) on the day of the Great Pilgrimage,- that Allah and His Messenger dissolve (treaty) obligations with the Pagans. If then, ye repent, it were best for you; but if ye turn away, know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah. And proclaim a grievous penalty to those who reject Faith. But when the forbidden months are past, '''then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them''', seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem of war; but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. ({{cite quran|9|1|end=5|style=nosup}}) }}

However, this verse has been explained.&lt;ref&gt;Hathout, Jihad vs. Terrorism; US Multimedia Vera International, 2002, pp.52-53, emphasis added&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
. Hostilities were frozen for a three-month period during which the Arabs pledged not to wage war. Prophet Muhammad was inspired to use this period to encourage the combatants to join the Muslim ranks or, if they chose, to leave the area that was under Muslims rule; '''however, if they were to resume hostilities, then the Muslims would fight back until victorious.''' One is inspired to note that even in this context of war, the verse concludes by emphasizing the divine attributes of mercy and forgiveness. To minimize hostilities, the Qur'an ordered Muslims to grant asylum to anyone, even an enemy, who sought refuge. Asylum would be granted according to the customs of chivalry; the person would be told the message of the Qur'an but not coerced into accepting that message. Thereafter, he or she would be escorted to safety regardless of his or her religion. (9:6).({{cite Hathout, Jihad vs. Terrorism; US Multimedia Vera International, 2002, pp.52-53| style=nosup}}) }}

Bernard Lewis presents some of his conclusions about [[Islamic culture]], [[Shari'a]] law, [[jihad]], and the modern day phenomenon of terrorism in his text, ''Islam: The Religion and the People''.{{sfn|Lewis|Churchill|2008|pp=145–150}} He writes of jihad as a distinct "religious obligation", but suggests that "it is a pity" that people engaging in terrorist activities are not more aware of their own religion:
{{quote|
Muslim fighters are commanded not to kill women, children, or the aged unless they attack first; not to torture or otherwise ill-treat prisoners; to give fair warning of the opening of hostilities or their resumption after a truce; and to honor agreements. ... At no time did the classical jurists offer any approval or legitimacy to what we nowadays call terrorism. Nor indeed is there any evidence of the use of terrorism as it is practiced nowadays."{{sfn|Lewis|Churchill|2008|pp=151}}}}

In Surah Al-Tawba, verse 29 demands Muslims to fight all those who do not believe in Islam, including Christians and Jews (People of the Book), until they pay the [[Jizya]], a tax, with willing submission.
{{quote|
Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, '''even if they are of the People of the Book''', until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. ({{cite quran|9|29|style=nosup}}) }}

Some people have  concluded from verse 9:29, that Muslims are commanded to attack all non-Muslims until they pay money, but Shaykh Jalal Abualrub writes:
{{quote|
These Ayat (Quranic verses) stress the necessity of fighting against the People of the Scripture, but under what conditions? We previously established the fact that the Islamic State is not permitted to attack non-Muslims who are not hostile to Islam, who do not oppress Muslims, or try to convert Muslims by force from their religion, or expel them from their lands, or wage war against them, or prepare for attacks against them. If any of these offenses occurs, however, Muslims are permitted to defend themselves and protect their religion. Muslims are not permitted to attack non-Muslims who signed peace pacts with them, or non-Muslims who live under the protection of the Islamic State.({{source=Abualrub, Holy Wars, Crusades, Jihad}}) }}

In Surah Al-Nisa, verse 89 has been misquoted to seem that it says to slay the [[Apostasy|apostates]]. In actuality, it only commands Muslims to fight those who practice oppression or persecution, or attack the Muslims.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}
{{quote|
Why should ye be divided into two parties about the Hypocrites? Allah hath upset them for their (evil) deeds. Would ye guide those whom Allah hath thrown out of the Way? For those whom Allah hath thrown out of the Way, never shalt thou find the Way. They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): so take not friends from their ranks until they forsake the domain of evil in the way of God (from what is forbidden). But if they revert to [open] enmity, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks. Except those who join a group between whom and you there is a treaty (Of peace), or those who approach you with hearts restraining them from fighting you as well as fighting their own people. If God had pleased, He could have given them power over you, and they would have fought you: therefore if they withdraw from you but fight you not, and (instead) send you (guarantees of) peace, then God hath opened no way for you (to war against them). Others you will find that wish to gain your confidence as well as that of their people: every time they are sent back to temptation, they succumb thereto; if they withdraw not from you nor give you (guarantees) of peace besides restraining their hands, seize them and slay them wherever ye get them; in their case We have provided you with a clear argument against them ({{cite quran|4|88|end=91|style=nosup}}) }}

In Surah Al-Bayyina verses 6 through 7 calls People of the Book and Polytheists who reject truth revealed by Islam, the worst of creatures, but the verse has very little to do with the subject of Religious Pluralism:
{{quote|
Those who reject Truth [Islam], among the People of the Book and among the Polytheists, will be in Hell-Fire, to dwell therein for aye. They are the worst of creatures. Those who have faith and do righteous deeds - they are the best of creatures. ({{cite quran|98|6|end=7|style=nosup}}) }}

===Sufism===
The [[Sufi]]s were practitioners of the esoteric mystic traditions within an Islam at a certain point. Sufism is defined by the Sufi master or [[Pir (Sufism)]] or [[fakeer]] or [[Wali]] in the language of the people by dancing and singing and incorporating various philosophies, theologies, ideologies and religions together (e.g., Christianity, Judaism, Paganism, Platonism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism and so forth with time). Famous Sufi masters are [[Rumi]], [[Abul Hasan ash-Shadhili|Shadhili]], [[Sheikh Farid]], [[Bulleh Shah]], [[Shah Hussain]], [[Shams Tabrizi]], [[Waris Shah]], [[Ghazali]], [[Mian Mir]], [[Attar of Nishapur]], [[Amir Khusrow]], [[Salim Chishti]]. See many more famous Sufis at the [[List of Sufis]]. The Sufis were considered by many to have divine revelations with messages of peace, tolerance, equality, pluralism, love for all and hate for no one, humanitarians, philosophers, psychologists and much more. Many had the teaching if you want to change the world, change yourself and you will change the whole world. The views of the Sufi poets, philosophers and theologians have inspired multiple forms of modern-day academia as well as philosophers of other religions. See also [[Blind men and an elephant]]. But undoubtedly, the most influential Sufi scholar to have embraced the world is Jalaluddin Muhammad Rumi. He was born in 1207 AD in a northern province of Afghanistan, however, he later had to seek refuge in Turkey following the invasion of Afghanistan by Mongols.&lt;ref&gt;http://registan.net/2007/11/12/rumi-the-alchemist-of-interfaith-tolerance/&lt;/ref&gt; Rumi, through his poetry and teachings, propagated inter-faith harmony like none other.  He served as a uniting figure for people of different faiths and his followers included Muslims, Christians and Jews. Even today, Rumi’s popularity does not cease to exist within the Sufi Muslim community and his message of peace and harmony transcends religious and geographical boundaries.

Rumi says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I looked for God. I went to a temple, and I didn't find him there. Then I went to a church, and I didn't find him there. And then I went to a mosque, and I didn't find him there. And then finally I looked in my heart, and there he was. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rumi also says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
How many paths are there to God? There are as many paths to God as there are souls on the Earth.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rumi also says:
 &lt;blockquote&gt;
A true Lover doesn't follow any one religion,
be sure of that.
Since in the religion of Love,
there is no irreverence or faith.
When in Love,
body, mind, heart and soul don't even exist.
Become this,
fall in Love,
and you will not be separated again.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Ahmadiyya===
{{See also|Prophethood (Ahmadiyya)}}
Ahmadis recognize many founders of world religions to be from God, who all brought teaching and guidance from God to all peoples. According to the [[Ahmadiyya]] understanding of the [[Quran]], every nation in the history of mankind has been sent a prophet, as the Quran states: ''And there is a guide for every people''. Though the Quran mentions only 24 prophets, the founder of Islam, [[Muhammad]] states that the world has seen 124,000 prophets. Thus other than the prophets mentioned in the Quran, Ahmadis, with support from theological study also recognize [[Buddha]], [[Krishna]], founders of [[Religion in China|Chinese religions]] to be divinely appointed individuals.

The Second [[Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad|Khalifatul Maish]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] writes:
"According to this teaching there has not been a single people at any time in history or anywhere in the world who have not had a warner from God, a teacher, a prophet. According to the Quran there have been prophets at all times and in all countries. India, China, Russia, Afghanistan, parts of Africa, Europe, America—all had prophets according to the theory of divine guidance taught by the Quran. When, therefore, Muslims hear about prophets of other peoples or other countries, they do not deny them. They do not brand them as liars. Muslims believe that other peoples have had their teachers. If other peoples have had prophets, books, and laws, these constitute no difficulty for Islam."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Introduction to the Study of the Holy Qur’an" by Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad. Part 2, Argument 4 Section labeled “A Grand Conception”&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], founder of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] wrote in his book ''[[A Message of Peace]]'':
"Our God has never discriminated between one people and another. This is illustrated by the fact that all the potentials and capabilities (Prophets) which have been granted to the Aryans (Hindus) have also been granted to the races inhabiting Arabia, Persia, Syria, China, Japan, Europe and America."&lt;ref name="Mirza Ghulam Ahmad pg. 6"&gt;"A Message of Peace" by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, pg. 6)&lt;/ref&gt;

===In modern practice===
Religious pluralism is a contested issue in modern Islamic countries. Twenty three (23) Islamic countries have laws, as of 2014, which make it a crime, punishable with death penalty or prison, for a Muslim, by birth or conversion, to [[Apostasy|leave Islam]] or convert to another religion.&lt;ref name=locplural&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/law/help/apostasy/apostasy.pdf Laws Criminalizing Apostasy in Selected Jurisdictions] Library of Congress, US Government (May 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/law/help/apostasy/index.php Laws Criminalizing Apostasy] Library of Congress (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doi, Abdur Rahman (1984), Shari`a: The Islamic Law; Taha Publishers; London UK&lt;/ref&gt; In Muslim countries such as [[Algeria]], it is illegal to preach, persuade or attempt to convert a Muslim to another religion.&lt;ref&gt;Law No. 02-06 (bis), al Jarida al Rasmiyya, vol.12, 1 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saudi Arabia]] and several Islamic nations have strict laws against the construction of Christian churches, Jewish synagogues, Hindu temples and Buddhist stupas anywhere inside the country, by anyone including minorities working there.&lt;ref name=meister/&gt; [[Brunei]] in southeast Asia adopted [[Sharia]] law in 2013 that prescribes a death penalty for any Muslim who converts from Islam to another religion.&lt;ref name=locplural/&gt; Other Islamic scholars state Sharia does not allow non-Muslim minorities to enjoy religious freedoms in a Muslim-majority nation, but other scholars disagree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamnewsroom.com/news-we-need/329-yusuf-estes-correcting-quran-misquotes|title=Islam News Room - Yusuf Estes Corrects QURAN Mis-Quotes|first=Ansar Al|last=Adl|date=|website=islamnewsroom.com|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mawdudi, S.

==Jainism==
{{Main|Anekantavada}}
''Anekāntavāda'', the principle of relative pluralism, is one of the basic principles of [[Jainism]]. In this view, the truth or the reality is perceived differently from different points of view, and no single point of view is the complete truth.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas (2002) p.231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koller, John M. (July, 2000) pp.400-7&lt;/ref&gt; Jain doctrine states that an object has infinite modes of existence and qualities and they cannot be completely perceived in all its aspects and manifestations, due to inherent limitations of the humans. Only the [[Kevala Jnana|Kevalins]]—the omniscient beings—can comprehend the object in all its aspects and manifestations, and all others are capable of knowing only a part of it.&lt;ref&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (1998) p.91&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, no one view can claim to represent the absolute truth--only relative truths. Jains compare all attempts to proclaim absolute truth with  '' andhgajnyaya '' or the "[[Blind men and an elephant|maxim of the blind men and elephant]]", wherein all the blind men claimed to explain the true appearance of the elephant, but could only partly succeed due to their narrow perspective.&lt;ref name = hughes&gt;Hughes, Marilynn (2005) p.590-1&lt;/ref&gt; For Jains, the problem with the blind men is not that they claim to explain the true appearance of the elephant; the problem is doing so to the exclusion of all other claims. Since absolute truth is many-sided, embracing any truth to the exclusion of others is to commit the error of ''ekānta'' (one-sidedness).&lt;ref name="The Metaphysics of Paradox"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schwartz |first1=Wm. Andrew |title=The Metaphysics of Paradox: Jainism, Absolute Relativity, and Religious Pluralism |date=2018 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=978-1-4985-6392-5 |url=https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781498563925/The-Metaphysics-of-Paradox-Jainism-Absolute-Relativity-and-Religious-Pluralism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Openness to the truths of others is one way in which Jainism embodies religious pluralism.

==Judaism==
{{Main|Jewish views on religious pluralism}}
The Mosaic law categorically warns the Jews to refrain from polytheism. First and the second commandment, you shall not have another God except me, worship your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Throughout the Hebrew Bible the sovereignty of Yahweh as the only God is the key pillar of a chosen community of Israel.

==Sikhism==
The [[Sikh Gurus]] (religious leaders) have propagated the message of "many paths" leading to the [[Ek Onkar|one God]] and ultimate [[salvation]] for all souls who treading on the path of [[righteousness]]. They have supported the view that proponents of all faiths, by doing good and virtuous deeds and by remembering the [[Lord]], can certainly achieve salvation. Sikhs are told to accept all leading faiths as possible vehicles for attaining spiritual enlightenment, provided the faithful study, ponder and practice the teachings of their prophets and leaders. Sikhism had many interactions with [[Sufism]] as well as [[Hinduism]], influenced them and was influenced by them. See [[Islam and Sikhism]] and [[Hinduism and Sikhism]].

The holy book of the [[Sikh]]s (the [[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]]) says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Do not say that the Vedas and the Koran (semitic books i.e. Bible, Torah and Q'uran) are false. Those who do not contemplate them are false. (Guru Granth Sahib page 1350)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=1350&amp;english=t&amp;id=57718|title=Sri Granth: Sri Guru Granth Sahib|work=srigranth.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As well as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some call the Lord "Ram, Ram", and some "Khuda". Some serve Him as "Gusain", others as "Allah". He is the Cause of causes, and Generous. He showers His Grace and Mercy upon us. Some pilgrims bathe at sacred shrines, others go on Hajj to Mecca. Some do devotional worship, whilst others bow their heads in prayer.  Some read the Vedas, and some the Koran.  Some wear blue robes, and some wear white.  Some call themselves Muslim, and some call themselves Hindu. Some yearn for paradise, and others long for heaven. Says Nanak, one who realizes the Hukam of God's Will, knows the secrets of his Lord Master. (Sri Guru Granth Sahib Page:885)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=sggs ram khudha people pray to there god|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?ction=Page&amp;g=1&amp;h=1&amp;r=1&amp;t=1&amp;p=0&amp;k=0&amp;Param=885|work=sggs ram khudha people pray to there god|accessdate=4 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
One who recognizes that all spiritual paths lead to the One shall be emancipated. One who speaks lies shall fall into hell and burn. In all the world, the most blessed and sanctified are those who remain absorbed in Truth. (SGGS Ang 142)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=pluarism in sggs|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;g=1&amp;h=1&amp;r=1&amp;t=1&amp;p=0&amp;k=0&amp;Param=142|work=pluarism in sggs|accessdate=4 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The seconds, minutes, and hours, days, weeks and months and various seasons originate from One Sun; O nanak, in just the same way, the many forms originate from the Creator. (Guru Granth Sahib page 12,13)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Guru Granth Sahib also says that [[Bhagat Namdev]] and [[Kabir|Bhagat Kabir]], who were both believed to be [[Hindu]]s, both attained salvation though they were born before [[Sikhism]] took root and were clearly not Sikhs. This highlights and reinforces the Guru's saying that "peoples of other faiths" can join with God as true and also at the same time signify that Sikhism is not the exclusive path for liberation.

Additionally the Guru Granth Sahib says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
First, Allah (God) created the Light; then, by His Creative Power, He made all mortal beings. From the One Light, the entire universe welled up. So who is good, and who is bad? ||1|| 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=aval allah|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=1349&amp;english=t&amp;id=57707#l57707|work=aval allah}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Again, the Guru Granth Sahib Ji provides this verse:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Bhagat Namdev|Naam Dayv]] the printer, and [[Kabir|Kabeer]] the weaver, obtained salvation through the Perfect Guru. Those who know God and recognize His [[Shabda|Shabad]] ("word") lose their ego and class consciousness. ([[Guru Granth Sahib]] page 67)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=67&amp;english=t&amp;id=2722|title=Sri Granth: Sri Guru Granth Sahib|work=srigranth.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most of the 15 [[Sikh Bhagats]] who are mentioned in their holy book were non-Sikhs and belonged to Hindu and Muslim faiths, which were the most prevalent religions of this region.

The pluralistic dialogue of Sikhism began with the founder of Sikhism Guru Nanak after becoming enlightened saying the words ''Na koi hindu na koi musalman'' - "There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim". He recognised that religious labels held no value and it is the deeds of human that will be judged in the hereafter what we call ourselves religiously holds no value.

Sikhs have been considered eager exponents of [[interfaith dialogue]] and will not only accept the right of others to practice their faith but have in the past fought and laid down their lives to protect this right for others. See the '''sacrifice of the ninth Sikh Guru, [[Martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadar|Guru Tegh Bahadar]]''' who on the final desperate and heart-rending pleas of a pandit of the Kashmiris, agreed to put up a fight against a tyrannic Moghul empire that was forcing them to convert to Islam, in order that they might gain the freedom to practice their religion--one other than his own.

==Religious pluralism and human service professions==
The concept of religious pluralism is also relevant to human service professions, such as psychology and social work, as well as medicine and nursing, in which trained professionals may interact with clients from diverse faith traditions.&lt;ref name=p97/&gt;&lt;ref name=zp&gt;Brian J.

New York: Guilford. {{ISBN|978-1-57230-664-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; has described four possible stances toward client religious and spiritual beliefs, which he called ''rejectionist'', ''exclusivist'', ''constructivist'', and ''pluralist''. Unlike the constructivist stance, the pluralist stance:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...recognizes the existence of a religious or spiritual absolute reality but allows for multiple interpretations and paths toward it. In contrast to the exclusivist who maintains that there is a single path "up the mountain of God," the pluralist recognizes many paths as valid. Although both the exclusivist and the pluralist may agree on the existence of religious or spiritual reality, the pluralist recognizes that this reality is expressed in different cultures and by different people in different ways. Because humans are mortal and limited, a single human religious system cannot encompass all of the religious or spiritual absolute reality.... (p. 167)&lt;ref name=zp/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Importantly, "the pluralistic therapist can hold personal religious beliefs while appreciating those of a client with different religious beliefs. The pluralist recognizes that religious value differences can and will exist between counselors and clients without adversely affecting therapy" (p.&amp;nbsp;168).&lt;ref name=zp/&gt; The stances implied by these four helping orientations on several key issues, such as "should religious issues be discussed in counseling?", have also been presented in tabular form (p.&amp;nbsp;362, Table 12.1).&lt;ref name=p97/&gt;

The profession of [[chaplain]]cy, a religious profession, must also deal with issues of pluralism and the relevance of a pluralistic stance. For example, Friberg (2001) argues: "With growing populations of immigrants and adherents of religions not previously seen in significant numbers in North America, spiritual care must take religion and diversity seriously. Utmost respect for the residents' spiritual and religious histories and orientations is imperative" (p.&amp;nbsp;182).&lt;ref name=nf&gt;Nils Friberg (2001).

{{Priesthoods of ancient Rome}}
In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], the '''Salii''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|l|i|ˌ|aɪ}}, {{IPA-la|'sʌlɪiː}}) were the "leaping priests" (from the verb ''saliō'' "leap, jump") of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] supposed to have been introduced by King [[Numa Pompilius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita libri]]'', 1:20&lt;/ref&gt; They were twelve [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] youths, dressed as archaic warriors: an embroidered [[tunic]], a [[breastplate]], a short red cloak (''[[paludamentum]])'', a sword, and a spiked headdress called an [[apex (headdress)|apex]]. They were charged with the twelve bronze shields called [[ancile|''ancilia'']], which, like the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] shield, resembled a figure eight. One of the shields was said to have fallen from heaven in the reign of King Numa and eleven copies were made to protect the identity of the sacred shield on the advice of the nymph [[Egeria (deity)|Egeria]], consort of Numa, who prophesied that wherever that shield was preserved, the people would be the dominant people of the earth.

Each year in March, the Salii made a procession round the city, dancing and singing the ''[[Carmen Saliare]]''. [[Ovid]], who relates the story of Numa and the heavenly ''ancilia'' in his ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' (3.259–392), found the hymn and the Salian rituals outdated and hard to understand. During the [[Principate]], by decree of the Senate, [[Augustus]]' name was inserted into the song (''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res Gestae]]'' 10). They ended the day by banqueting. ''Saliaris cena'' became proverbial for a sumptuous feast.

King [[Tullus Hostilius]] is said to have established another [[Collegium (ancient Rome)|collegium]] of Salii in fulfillment of a vow which he made in the [[Roman–Etruscan Wars#Second War with Fidenae and Veii, under Tullus Hostilius|second war with Fidenae and Veii]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:27&lt;/ref&gt; These Salii were also twelve in number, chosen from the [[patrician (ancient Rome)|Patricians]], and appeared to have been dedicated to the service of [[Quirinus]]. They were called the '''Salii collini''', '''Agonales''', or '''Agonenses'''.&lt;ref&gt;William Smith's [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Salii.html ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities''], "Salii". John Murray, London, 1875.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear whether the primary aim of the ritual was to protect Rome's army, although this is the traditional view.

==Founder==
In addition to the myth of the ''ancile'', several other explanations are offered in Greek and Latin sources for the founding of the priesthood. An origin among the Etruscans is attributed to a founding by [[Morrius]], king of [[Veii]]. The Salii are also given an origin in connection with [[[[Dardanus (son of Zeus)]]|Dardanus]] and the [[Samothrace|Samothracian]] [[Di Penates]], and the [[Salius]] who came to Italy with Evander and in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' competed in the [[funeral games]] of [[Anchises]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Rykwert, ''The Idea of a Town: The Anthropology of Urban Form in Rome, Italy and the Ancient World'' (MIT Press, 1988), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient authors quoted by [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]] and [[Macrobius]] recorded that Salii had existed at [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tibur]], [[Tusculum]] and [[Veii]] even before their creation in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Servius |title=Aenead |at=VIII 285}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Macrobius |title=Saturnalia |at=III 12, 1-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations of the rituals==
There is no single standing description of the Salii's rituals throughout the month of March from one of the ancient authors, and facts have to be reconstructed from multiple mentions in diverse works; however there are strong indications that the procession may actually have lasted a full 24&amp;nbsp;days, from March&amp;nbsp;1st which opened the festival till March&amp;nbsp;24th which closed it, with the procession moving from one station to another each day, and some revelling being held each evening; a complete assessment can be found in Smith, Wayte, &amp; Marindin (1890).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities |first1=William, LLD |last1=Smith |first2=William |last2=Wayte |first3=G. E. |last3=Marindin |location=Albemarle Street, London, UK |publisher=John Murray |year=1890 |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0063%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DS%3Aentry+group%3D1%3Aentry%3Dsalii-cn |via=Tufts U. / Perseus}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Wissowa===
Classical [[philology|philologist]] [[Georg Wissowa]] maintained that the ritual of the Salii is a [[war dance]] or a [[sword dance]], with their costumes clearly indicating their military origin.{{sfn|Wissowa|1912|pp=480ff}}

===Dumézil===
[[Georges Dumézil]] interpreted the rituals of the Salii as marking the opening and the closing of the yearly war season. The opening would coincide with the day of the [[Agonalia|Agonium Martiale]] on March&amp;nbsp;19,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Varro |title=Lingua Latina |at=VI 14 |quote=Liberalia ... In libris Saliorum quorum cognomen Agonensium, forsitan hic dies ideo appellatur Agonia&lt;br/&gt;[Liberalia ... In the books of the Salii they are named of the Agonenses, perhaps this day is thence rather named Agonia.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the closing with the day of the [[Armilustrium]] on October&amp;nbsp;19. The first date was also referred to as ''ancilia movere'', "to move the ''ancilia''," and the second as ''ancilia condere'', "to store (or hide) the ''ancilia''."

Dumezil views the two groups of Salii —  one representing Mars and the other Quirinus — as a dialectic relationship showing the interdependency of the military and economic functions in Roman society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Servius |title=Aenead |at=VIII 663}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Statius |title=Silvae |at=V 128 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dionysius of Halicarnassus |author-link=Dionysius of Halicarnassus |title=Roman Antiquities |at=II 70, 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dumezil, G.  |title=La religion romaine archaique |location=Paris, FR |year=1974 |at=2nd part 1 chapt. 6 |others=It. tr.  Milano 1974 p. 248-249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usener===
Because the earliest [[Roman calendar]] had begun with the month of March, [[Hermann Usener]] thought the ceremonies of the ''ancilia movere'' were a ritual expulsion of the old year, represented by the mysterious figure of [[Mamuralia|Mamurius Veturius]], to make way for the new god Mars born on March 1.&lt;ref&gt;Old calendars name the day ''Caesus Ancili'' or ''Natalis Martis'': Calend. Philocali et Constantini Feriae Martis, Calend. Praen.  CIL I p. 387; Ovid ''Fasti'' III 1 ff.; L. Preller ''Roemische Mythologie'' 1858 p.319 n. 5&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Ides of March]], a man ritually named as Mamurius Veturius was beaten with long white sticks in the ''sacrum Mamurii'', in Usener's view as a form of [[scapegoat]]ing. Mamurius was the mythic blacksmith who forged eleven replicas of the original divine shield that had dropped from the sky.&lt;ref&gt;H. Usener ''Kleine Schriften'' IV Bonn, 1913 p. 122 and 135 citing Iohannes Lydus ''de Mensibus'' IV 36, 71; Properce V 2, 61; Minucius Felix ''Octav.'' 243; Varro ''Lingua Latina'' VI 45: "Itaque Salii quod cantant: "Mamuri Veturi" significant memoriam veterem". "Thus the Salii when they sing "Mamuri Veturi" mean memories of the past"&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Usener and [[Ludwig Preller]]&lt;ref&gt;H. Usener ''Kleine Schriften'' IV Bonn, 1913, p. 193; L. Preller ''Roemische Mythologie'' 1858 p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; Mars would be a god of war and fertility while Mamurius Veturius would mean "Old Mars". Mars is himself a dancer,&lt;ref&gt;Catullus 17, 6 Salisubsulus&lt;/ref&gt; and the head of the Salian dancers, patrician young men whose parents were both living (''patrimi'' and ''matrimi''). Wissowa compares the Salii with the noble youth who dance the ''[[Lusus Troiae]]''.{{sfn|Wissowa|1912|p=382}} The ritual dance of the Salii would thus be a coalescence of an [[initiation]] into adulthood and war with a scapegoat ritual (see also ''[[pharmakos]])''.

===others===
Other 19th-century scholars have compared the rituals of the Salii with the [[Vedic mythology|Vedic myths]] of [[Indra]] and the [[Maruts]].&lt;ref&gt;L. von Schoeder ''Mysterium und Mimus im RigVeda'' 1908, pp. 126 and 329-330&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Hillebrandt ''Vedische Mythologie'' 1902 III p. 323; killer of his own father at the same time of his birth II p. 517, III p. 162; father of Indra is [[Tvastar]] the divine blacksmith (cf. Mamurius Veturius)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oldenburg ''Die Religion d. Veda'' 1894 p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==

* Numa's '''Salii Palatini''' were dedicated to Mars surnamed ''[[Mars (mythology)#Mars Gradivus|Gradivus]]'' (meaning "he who walks into battle"), and were quartered on the [[Palatine Hill]].

The second group of Salii may in fact have been created during an Augustan reorganization of the priesthood. Paulus ex Festo p.&amp;nbsp;10 M reads: ''...&amp;nbsp;Agones dicebant montes, Agonia sacrificia quae fiebant in monte; hinc Romae mons Quirinalis Agonus et Collina Porta Agonensis'': "Agones were called the mounts, Agonia the sacrifices that took place on the mounts; hence in Rome the Quirinal mount (is named) Agonus and the Porta Collina Agonensis".

==Salian virgins==
[[Sextus Pompeius Festus]] makes a perplexing reference to "Salian virgins" (''saliae virgines'').&lt;ref&gt;Festus (439 L) cites [[Aelius Stilo]] and [[Cincius]] as his sources.&lt;/ref&gt; Wearing the ''[[paludamentum]]'' and pointed ''apex'' of the Salii, these maidens were employed to assist the [[College of Pontiffs]] in carrying out sacrifices in the [[Regia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6629">{{Musa}}
'''Samiri''' or '''the Samiri''' ({{lang-ar|السامري|as-Sāmirī}}) is a phrase used by the [[Quran]] to refer to a rebellious follower of Moses who created the [[golden calf]] and attempted to lead the [[Hebrews]] into idolatry. According to [[Ta-Ha|the twentieth chapter of the Quran]], Samiri created the calf while [[Moses in Islam|Moses]] was away for 40 days on [[Mount Sinai]], receiving the [[Ten Commandments]].&lt;ref&gt;The Qur'an, [http://al-quran.info/#20:85 Surah Ta Ha, Ayah 85]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to account given in the [[Hebrew Bible]], the Quran does not blame [[Aaron]] for the calf’s creation and instead praises him for trying to stop the worship of it.&lt;ref&gt;The Qur'an, [http://al-quran.info/#20:92 Surah Ta Ha, Ayah 92-98]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Quran==

In [[Ta-Ha]], the Quran’s twentieth [[surah]], Moses is informed that Samiri has led his people astray in Moses’ absence. He returns to his people to berate them, and is informed of what Samiri has done.

:They said, ‘We did not fail our tryst with you of our own accord, but we were laden with the weight of the people’s ornaments, and we cast them [into the fire] and so did the Samiri throw.’ Then he produced for them a calf —a [lifeless] body with a low— and they said, This is your god and the god of Musa (Moses), so he forgot! Did they not see that it did not answer them, nor could it bring them any benefit or harm? Haroun (Aaron) had certainly told them earlier, ‘O my people! You are only being tested by it. Indeed your Lord is the All-beneficent. So follow me and obey my command!’

:[Moses] said, “And what is your case, O Samiri?” He said, “I saw what they did not see, so I took a handful [of dust] from the track of the messenger and threw it, thus did my soul entice me.” [Moses] said, “Then go. And indeed, it is [decreed] for you in [this] life to say, 'No contact.’ And indeed, you have an appointment [in the Hereafter] you will not fail to keep. And look at your 'god’ to which you remained devoted. We will surely burn it and blow it [i.e., its ashes] into the sea with a blast. {{Quran-usc|20|95}}

==In Islamic tradition==

The Quran’s statement that Samiri’s calf made a "lowing" sound has resulted in much speculation. A number of Islamic traditions say that the calf was made with dust trodden upon by the horse of the angel [[Gabriel]], which had mystical properties. Some traditions say that the calf could also move, a property granted to it by the dust of the “horse of life”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=al-Tabari |first1=Abu Jafar  |translator-last1=Brinner |translator-first1=William M. |year=1991 |title=The History of al-Tabari, Volume III: The Children of Israel |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other traditions suggest that Samiri made the sound himself, or that it was only the wind.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Uri. "Tradition in Transformation: the Ark of the Covenant and the Golden Calf in Biblical and Islamic Historiography," Oriens (Volume 36, 2001): 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Still others say that the calf was formed by Allah himself, as a test for the Hebrew people.&lt;ref&gt;Albayrak, I. (2002). Isra’iliyyat and Classical Exegetes’ Comments on the Calf with a Hollow Sound Q.20: 83-98/ 7: 147-155 with Special Reference to Ibn  ’Atiyya. Journal of Semitic Studies, 47(1), 39–65. doi:10.1093/jss/47.1.39&lt;/ref&gt;

Later traditions expand upon the fate of those who worshiped the calf. Works by [[al-Tabari]] include a story in which Moses orders his people to drink from the water into which the calf had been flung; those guilty of worshiping it were revealed when they turned a golden hue. Moses ordered his people to kill them, resulting in thousands of casualties, but the carnage stopped after Moses begged Allah to stop the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=al-Tabari |first1=Abu Jafar  |translator-last1=Brinner |translator-first1=William M. |year=1991 |title=The History of al-Tabari, Volume III: The Children of Israel |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samiri's punishment has been interpreted as total social isolation by most scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Albayrak, I. (2002). Isra’iliyyat and Classical Exegetes’ Comments on the Calf with a Hollow Sound Q.20: 83-98/ 7: 147-155 with Special Reference to Ibn ’Atiyya. Journal of Semitic Studies, 47(1), 39–65. doi:10.1093/jss/47.1.39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity==

Scholars of Islam have linked Samiri to various individuals mentioned in the [[Bible]]. Due to the fact that ''as-Samiri'' can mean the [[Samaritan]],&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Uri. "Tradition in Transformation: the Ark of the Covenant and the Golden Calf in Biblical and Islamic Historiography," Oriens (Volume 36, 2001): 202.&lt;/ref&gt; some believe that his character is a reference to the worship of the [[Biblical and Quranic narratives#Idol calf and Samaritan|golden calves]] built by [[Jeroboam]] of Samaria, conflating the two idol-worshiping incidents into one. However, recent research reveal that the Samaritans are the direct descendants of the Joseph tribes, Ephraim and Manasseh and that until the 17th century C.E., they possessed a high priesthood descending directly from Aaron through Eleazar and Phinehas.&lt;ref&gt;Islamic Awareness, {{cite news | title=The “Samaritan” Error In The Qur'an? | url=https://www.islamic-awareness.org/quran/contrad/external/samaritan.html | website=islamic-awareness.org | date=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samiri has also been linked to the rebel Hebrew leader [[Zimri (prince)|Zimri]] on the basis of their similar names and a shared theme of rebellion against Moses’ authority.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Uri. "Tradition in Transformation: the Ark of the Covenant and the Golden Calf in Biblical and Islamic Historiography," Oriens (Volume 36, 2001): 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Others link him to the Mesopotamian city of [[Samarra]] and suggest that he came from a cow-worshiping people, giving his name as Musa bin Zafar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Ibn Kathir]] |title=Quran Tafsir Ibn Kathir |publisher=Dar-us-Salam Publications |year=2000 |url=http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=906&amp;Itemid=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no consensus among Islamic scholars on which, if any, of these identifications is correct.

==In the Baha'i Faith==
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] portrays Samiri as a magician who led people away from the “knowledge and justice” of Moses to ignorance. He is mentioned in the “[[Kitáb-i-Íqán]]”, the primary theological work of the Baha'i religion.

'''Shapur''' ({{lang-pal|𐭱𐭧𐭯𐭥𐭧𐭥𐭩}}) was a [[Persian people|Persian]] prince, who ruled as the last [[Frataraka]] dynast in [[Fars Province|Pars]] briefly in ca. 222.

== Biography ==
Shapur was the eldest son of [[Papak]], a local ruler of a district named Khir in southern [[Istakhr]]. Papak was a vassal of [[Gochihr]], the overlord of Pars, who was himself the vassal of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] king [[Artabanus V of Parthia|Artabanus V]] (r 208–224). According to [[Arabic]]-[[Persian language|Persian]] sources, Shapur's brother, [[Ardashir I]] started an uprising when he was the commander of Fort Darabgerd in eastern Pars. According to the medieval historian, [[al-Tabari]], Ardashir then asked Papak to stand against Gochihr and start a rebellion. Papak did it and rebelled against Gochihr and killed him.&lt;ref name=":08"&gt;{{Cite book|title="ARDAŠĪR I i. History". In Encyclopædia Iranica.|last=Wiesehöfer|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Touraj Daryaee|Daryaee]] believes that Papak dreamed of conquering Istakhr himself and was eventually able to achieve it by the help of Shapur; that means in contrast to al-Tabari's report, it was not Ardashir's request and order that caused Papak's rebellion against Gochihr, governor of Istakhr, and it can be implied from the common coins of Papak and Shapur.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=ARDAXŠĪR AND THE SASANIAN'S RISE TO POWER.|last=Daryaee|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Papak wrote a letter to Artabanus and requested permission to appoint Shapur instead of the "overthrown" Gochihr in power; in response, Artabanus announced Papak and Ardashir outlaws.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Persia During the Sasanians|last=Christensen|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although Artabanus had defeated the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], he faced the problem of the defiance of [[Vologases VI]], who had minted coins in his own name between 221 and 222; and this shows that no powerful emperor controlled the Parthian Empire then. During the time that Artabanus was dealing with a more important challenge, and thus he could not pay much attention to the rise of a newcomer in Pars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Political History of Ērānšahr|last=Daryaee|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a while, Papak died in ca. 222 and Shapur ascended to the throne; afterward, the contest and fight started between the two brothers (Shapur and Ardashir), but Shapur died in an accidental way. According to sources, Shapur stopped at a ruin while assaulting Darabgerd and a stone suddenly separated from the ceiling and hit his head and Shapur succumbed immediately. After the incident, the brothers relinquished the Persian throne and crown to Ardashir, who became the Persian Shah thereafter.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Persian History During the Sasanians|last=Frye|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ardashir and his followers could be considered the main suspects of Shapur's mysterious death, since they "benefitted from the accidental death"; but the accusation is not provable.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite book|title=SASANIAN PERSIA: THE RISE AND FALL OF AN EMPIRE.|last=Daryaee|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nephew of Ardashir, Narseh, whose name is mentioned in the [[Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]], was most likely the son of Shapur.

'''''Sharif''''' (also transliterated Sharīf or Sherif) / '''Shareef''', Alsharif, Alshareef ({{lang-ar|شريف}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|šarīf}}''), or '''Chérif''' ([[Darija]]: Chorfa) is a traditional [[Arab]] [[title]]. The origin of the word is an adjective meaning "noble", "highborn". The feminine singular is '''sharifa(h) or shareefa(h)''' ({{lang-ar|شريفة}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|šarīfah}}''). The masculine plural is [[Ashraf]] ({{lang-ar|اشراف}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾašrāf}}'').

[[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]] in the [[Arab world]] reserve the term ''sharif/sherif or shareef'' for descendants of [[Hasan ibn Ali]], while ''[[sayyid]]'' is used for descendants of [[Husayn ibn Ali]], Hasan's younger brother.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Both Hasan and Husayn are grandchildren of the Islamic Prophet [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]], through the marriage of his cousin [[Ali]] and his daughter [[Fatimah|Fatima]]. However, since the post-Hashemite era began in 1925 after the fall of the Sharif/Shareef of Mecca, the term ''sayyid'' has been used to denote descendants from both Hasan and Husayn. [[Shia Islam|Shiites]] use the terms ''sayyid'' and ''habib'' to denote descendants from both Hasan and Husayn; see also [[ashraf]]. Sayyids having ancestry from both Imams Hasan and Husayn use the terms ''Shareefayn'', ''Sayyidayn'', ''Sayyid AlShareef,'' or ''Sheikh Assayyid'' before their names and call themselves ''Najeeb AlTarfayn''.

From 1201 until 1925, when the [[Hejaz]] was conquered by [[Ibn Saud]], this family (the descendants of Hasan ibn Ali) held the office of the [[Sharif of Mecca|Sharīf of Mecca]], often also carrying the title and office of King of Hejaz. Descendants now rule the [[Jordan|Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]], the name is taken from the [[Banu Hashim]], the sub-tribe of [[Quraysh (tribe)|Banu Quraish]], to which [[Muhammad]] belonged.

In [[Morocco]], several of the regal dynasties have been qualified as "Sharifian", being descendants of Muhammad. Today's [[Alaouite dynasty]] has made claims to be Sharifian.

The Royal Family of [[Brunei]], The [[Bolkiah]] [[Dynasty]] of [[Sultan]]s, are also Sharifs through their ancestor [[Sharif Ali]] bin Ajlaan bin Rumayytha bin Muhammad AbuNumayy I who was the son of the [[Emir]] of Makkah Sharif Ajlaan and had migrated and settled in Borneo.

The word has no etymological connection with the [[English language|English]] term ''[[sheriff]]'', which comes from the [[Old English language|Old English]] word ''scīrgerefa'', meaning "shire-reeve", the local [[Reeve (England)|reeve]] (enforcement agent) of the king in the [[shire]] (county).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=sheriff&amp;searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Maghreb ==

=== Morocco ===
Chorfa is the [[Darija]] term for the Arabic "Sharif". In Morocco, the royal houses of [[Idrisid]], [[Saadi dynasty|Saadi]] and [[Alaouite]] are called Sharifian or Cherifian.

The first known Chorfa, [[Idris I]], was the great-grandson of [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] and [[Fatima Zahra]], the daughter of [[Muhammad]] and his first wife [[Khadijah]]. Idris I and his people fled from Syria to Morocco in 786 from the Abbasids after losing to them in the [[Battle of Fakh]] near [[Mecca]] in which his family was massacred. In 788, he was greeted by the Amazigh people of [[Volubilis]], a Roman city near [[Meknes]]. He got to found the Imperial City of [[Fes]]. It is believed that Idris I was poisoned in 791 by a servant sent by Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]], leaving his wife [[Kenza al-Awrabiya|Kenza]] pregnant. His servant [[Rached]], a freed slave, helped Kenza raise Idris II who was born 2 months later.

Idris II came to the throne at the age of eleven. His tomb is located in [[Moulay Idriss]], a village up on a mountainside near Volubilis. Idriss II's descendants ruled the country until the second half of the 10th century, when they lost their authority to the invasions of the [[Zenata]], an Amazigh tribe under the orders of the [[Fatimid Caliphate]], later the [[Caliph of Cordoba]].

=== Algeria ===
According to French historians, [[Abdelkader El Djezairi]] was a descendant of Muhammad .&lt;ref&gt;Société languedocienne de géographie, University of Montpellier. Institut de géographie, CNRS France, publié par le secrétariat de la Société languedocienne de géographie, 1881. Footnotes: v. 4, page 517&lt;/ref&gt; The full name of El Amir Abdelkader is ''Abd el-Kader ibn Muhyidin, ibn Mostafa (qui s’est installé définitivement dans la plaine d’Ighriss), ibn Muhammad, ibn Ahmed, ibn Muhammad, ibn Abdel-Kaoui, ibn Ali, ibn Ahmed, ibn Khaled, ibn Yussef, ibn Ahmed, ibn Bachar, ibn Muhammed, ibn Massoud, ibn Taous, ibn Yacoub, ibn Abdelkaoui, ibn Ahmed, ibn Muhammad, ibn [[Idriss II]], ibn [[Idriss I]], ibn Abdallah El Kamel, ibn Hassan El Muthana, ibn [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hassan Essabt]], ibn [[Ali]]''.

However other historians disputes, arguing that El Amir Abdelkader was descended from the Amazigh tribe of [[Banu Ifran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qtU1AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA193&amp;dq=ifren|title=L'Univers: histoire et description de tous les peuples ..|date=1850-01-01|publisher=F.

=== Libya ===
The Senussi, a political-religious brotherhood, founded in Mecca by Sayyid [[Muhammad ibn Ali as-Senussi]] in 1837, came to become the Emirs of [[Cyrenaica]] in 1917 and then in 1922, the Emirs of [[Tripoli]]. The dynasty is of the Chofra descent through their sixth Senussi sultan, [[Ali ibn Omar]]. They came to be the kings of Libya.

The last king of Libya, [[Idris of Libya|Idris]], was overthrown by a military coup in 1969. The current claimant for the Libyan throne is Sayyid [[Mohammed El Senussi]]. It is also claimed by Sayyid [[Idris bin Abdullah al-Senussi]].

==Yemen==
The Asharaf are from the  descendants of [[Muhammed]] .
Sharif (the word of which Asharaf is the superlative). It is an Arabic word meaning 'noble' or 'respected'. It can be attached to one of a person's names or to more than one, and an individual may use it at one time but not at another. It can be used by all Ashraf, but is not necessarily and many nowadays prefer to omit it. It is not generally a personal name, and hence will not necessarily appear on documents such as identity card or passport. (It is sometimes used as a personal name, not only among the Asharaf. The most popular person with Sharif title in hadhramout, Yemen is Alsharif Mudhir bin Abdulrahman Ba Alawi who lived in Tarim and passed away in 2010

==Somalia==
The Asharaaf elders sub-divided the Asharaaf in the following way:

■ Asharaaf Hussein:

● Reer sharif Magbuul
● Sharif Ahmed
● Sharif Ba Alawi

■ Asharaaf Hassan:

● Mohammed Sharif
● Sharif Ali
● Sharif Ahmed
● Ashraf Sarman

Asharaaf in [[Somalia]] are either related to Muhammad through his grandsons [[Hassan ibn Ali]] or [[Husayn Ibn Ali]].
The Hussein branch of the Asharaf of [[Somalia]] live in the coastal towns such as [[Mogadishu]] and are part of the '[[Benadiri]]' minority population. A few have moved to other places in order to trade or because they have bought land.
The Ashraf of the Hassan branch live mainly in the interior of the country (some of them of course may have gone to live in Mogadishu), and mostly are not [[Benadiri]]. However, the Asharaf al-Ahdali in [[Merca]], who are [[Benadiri]], are said to be Hassan.
The Asharaf elders indicated that they are living in Southern Somali and in [[Kenya]] and [[Ethiopia]] however they mostly like in urban locations such as [[Bardera]], [[Kismayo]], [[Baidoa]], [[Hudur]], [[Merca]], [[Barawa|Brava]], [[Luuq]], [[Jalalaqsi]], [[Buur Ukur]], [[Beledweyne]], and [[Mogadishu]]. The largest concentration of Ashraf are found in [[Mogadishu]] the oldest Mosques are in [[Shangani District|such as the Masjidka Ahnaafta 7 Century, Masjidka (Sheikh Ahmed Sharif, Oldest Mosque in Africa) in the heart of Mogadishu,  Jama Shangani]], 
All Masaajid in the District are 13.  [[Mogadishu]]. Some Ashraf settled in Ethiopia after being exiled from Somali during the [[Ogaden]] war in 1977. These Asharaf are settled in [[Ogaden]], [[Dire Dawa]], [[Oromia]], [[Harar]], however many Asharaf fled [[Somalia|Somali]] during the 1991-1992 [[Somali Civil War]]. Most of them are all over the World.

==Far East==

The [[Bolkiah]] [[Dynasty]] of Sultans of [[Brunei]] claim their Sharifian ancestry to [[Sharif Ali]] bin Ajlaan bin Rumaytha bin Muhammad AbuNumayy I who was the son of the Emir of Makkah and had migrated and settled in Borneo by marrying the daughter of the 3rd Sultan Ahmed.

Many Royal Families currently and previous of Malaysia, Indonesia, Java, Sumatra, Philippines and Singapore had Sharifian lineage for examples: the Hashemite Dynasty of Sultans of [[Sulu]] whose ancestor was [[Sharif ul-Hāshim of Sulu]] and another ex-royal family is the [[Alsagoff Family]] of Singapore.

The '''Temple of Ellesyia''' is an [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|ancient Egyptian]] [[rock-cut architecture|rock-cut]] [[Egyptian temple|temple]] located near the site of [[Qasr Ibrim]]. It was built during the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]] by the [[Pharaoh]] [[Thutmosis III]]. The temple was dedicated to the [[ancient Egyptian deities|deities]] [[Amun]], [[Horus]] and [[Satis (goddess)|Satis]].

During the [[Nubia]]n monument salvage campaign guided by the [[UNESCO]] in the 1960s the temple was moved to
the [[Museo Egizio]] at [[Turin]] in order to save it from being submerged by [[Lake Nasser]].

In October 2007, 22-year-old '''Janet Moses''' died and a 14-year-old female relative was injured during a [[mākutu]] lifting (or [[exorcism]]) in the [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]] suburb of [[Wainuiomata]]. In 2009, nine members of Moses' extended family, all siblings of her mother or their spouses, were charged in relation to the event.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_2482160"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/2482160/Makutu-Curse-lifting-a-family-tradition |title=Makutu: Curse-lifting a family tradition |date=8 June 2009 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One uncle and four aunts were subsequently found guilty of drowning Moses.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_2497165"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/wellington/2497165/Jury-returns-with-makutu-trial-verdicts |title=Jury returns with makutu trial verdicts |date=12 June 2009 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mākutu lifting and subsequent trial were notable for bringing makutu into the public consciousness in New Zealand; and the large number of independent people who stepped forward to distance mākutu lifting as they knew it from the events in this case. Unprecedented media attention was paid to mākutu, mākutu lifting and [[Māori religion]].

==Mākutu==
Mākutu is a [[Māori language]] word which can be either a noun or a verb depending on context. It is translated into English by church missionaries as curse, witchcraft&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BudAbor-t1-body-d1-d1-d7.html http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BudAbor-t1-body-d1-d1-d7.html]&lt;/ref&gt; or sorcery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maoridictionary.co.nz/index.cfm?dictionaryKeywords=makutu http://www.maoridictionary.co.nz/index.cfm?dictionaryKeywords=makutu]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Māori_language#Orthography|modern orthography]], mākutu is written with a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] where technically possible, but in historical sources and sometimes in modern sources (such as newspapers) with limited technical capabilities it is written without the macron.

Historically, the [[tohunga]] involved in lifting mākutu were suppressed by the [[Tohunga Suppression Act 1907]], which was repealed in 1962.

==Mākutu and mākutu lifting==
In the period prior to the mākutu lifting, Janet Moses had suffered the loss of her grandmother and relationship problems with her partner and father of her two children; the trial would later hear expert testimony that she likely had an "underlying psychiatric or psychological disorder."&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_2450284"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/wellington/2450284/Makutu-victim-probably-mentally-ill |title=Makutu victim probably mentally ill |date=28 May 2009 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A concrete lion was stolen from a [[Greytown, New Zealand|Greytown]] hotel by family members, and was to become associated by family members with Moses' behaviour; the family said she was acting ''like a lion.''&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_2500232"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/2500232 |title=The devil's in the detail |author=Palmer, Rebecca |date=15 June 2009 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family emblem was a lion, with at least one family member having a tattoo of a lion and the words 'Family united' over it.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_2434807"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/wellington/2434807/Father-wasn-t-told-of-makutu-death |title=Father wasn't told of makutu death |date=23 May 2009 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When they became concerned with her behaviour, Moses' family consulted [[kaumatua]] (elder) [[Timi Rahi]], who prayed for her and blessed her, and advised the family to return the lion, which they did. Rahi instructed the family that it was their responsibility to carry out the healing.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_2500232"/&gt; After Rahi left, a prolonged mākutu lifting was performed by her predominantly maternal family at the [[Wainuiomata]] flat of Moses' late grandmother. There was no evidence as to who suggested that Moses was possessed or suffering from a curse, or who suggested that a mākutu lifting was required. The ceremony was improvised, as none of those involved had any knowledge of the procedure for a mākutu lifting.  During the ceremony, so much water was used that the carpet had become soaked, and so a small hole in the floor had to be made for drainage. The woman's eyes were injured as people picked at the demons they saw in them, and neighbours heard rhythmic stomping and thumping throughout the night.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_2443327"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/wellington/2443327/Carpet-soaked-during-curse-lifting |title=Carpet soaked during curse-lifting |date=26 May 2009 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At or about 8:00 AM on 12 October 2007, Janet Moses died by drowning. Her father, who had travelled from Christchurch through the night to support his daughter, was not informed until his arrival at 4:30 PM.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_2434807"/&gt; Nine hours after the death the police were called.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_2497540"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/wellington/2497540/A-woman-drowned-by-too-much-love |title=A woman drowned by too much love |date=13 June 2009 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
Much of the trial centred on the issue of consent, that is whether Moses was a willing participant in the ritual. The trial ran for 29 days and 101 witnesses, many of them giving testimony relating to cultural and religious practices. The jury deliberated for 20 hours before convicting five of the eight maternal family members facing charges (another family member was discharged by the judge mid-trial).&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_2497540"/&gt;

None of the convicted family members were sentenced to custodial sentences, the judge instead handing down community-based sentences.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_2752940"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/wellington/2752940/No-jail-terms-for-makutu-manslaughter-culprits |title=No jail terms for makutu manslaughter culprits |date=14 August 2009 |agency=[[NZPA]] |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the trial, Charlie Moses (Janet's paternal grandfather) took a stance supporting the defendants: "We've made our peace with them. They didn't know what they were doing, even though I told them not to go down that road. They chose to do it anyway. For that mistake ... they're going to pay for the rest of their lives. I wish them well all the same."&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_2497284"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/wellington/2497284/Deadly-curse-verdict-five-found-guilty |title=Deadly curse verdict: five found guilty |date=13 June 2009 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As is common in New Zealand court cases, a number of those connected to the case have name suppression to prevent the identification of under-age victims.

The eventual coroners inquest strongly recommended that the family consult tohunga (experts) or experienced [[kaumatua]] (elders) before taking action on suspected mākutu.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_4018457"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/4018457/Janet-Moses-died-from-accidental-drowning |title=Janet Moses died from 'accidental drowning' |date=12 August 2010 |agency=[[NZPA]] |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both [[Pou Temara]], professor of Māori language and traditions at  [[Waikato University]], and [[Rawiri Taonui]], head of [[Canterbury University]]'s School of Maori and Indigenous Studies, said that the advice was sensible and that Māori would continue mākutu lifting practices.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_4024054"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/4024054/Moses-case-won-t-stop-makutu-lifting |title=Moses case 'won't stop makutu lifting' |author=Ash, Julie |date=14 August 2010 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Walī''''' ({{lang-ar|ولي}}, plural {{transl|ar|''ʾawliyāʾ''}} {{lang|ar|أولياء}}) is an [[Arabic]] word whose literal meanings include "custodian", "protector", "helper", and "friend".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ejtaal.net/aa/#hw4=1302,ll=3066,ls=79,la=4919,sg=1252,ha=906,br=1072,pr=171,aan=742,mgf=869,vi=392,kz=3008,mr=805,mn=1581,uqw=1902,umr=1196,ums=1010,umj=961,ulq=1833,uqa=460,uqq=444 Hans Wehr, p.  1289]&lt;/ref&gt; In the vernacular, it is most commonly used by Muslims to indicate an Islamic [[saint]], otherwise referred to by the more literal "friend of God".&lt;ref name="John Renard 2008"&gt;John Renard, ''Friends of God: Islamic Images of Piety, Commitment, and Servanthood'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008); Idem., ''Tales of God Friends: Islamic Hagiography in Translation'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2009), et passim.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Radtke, B., Lory, P., Zarcone, Th., DeWeese, D., Gaborieau, M., F.

[and] holiness",  and who is specifically "chosen by God and endowed with exceptional gifts, such as the ability to work [[miracle worker|miracles]]".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Radtke, B., "Saint", in: ''Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān'', General Editor: Jane Dammen McAuliffe, Georgetown University, Washington, D.C..&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine of saints was articulated by Islamic scholars very early on in Muslim history,&lt;ref&gt;J. van Ess, ''Theologie und Gesellschaft im 2. und 3. Jahrhundert Hidschra. Eine Geschichte des religiösen Denkens im frühen Islam'', II (Berlin-New York, 1992), pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Radtke and J. O’Kane, ''The Concept of Sainthood in Early Islamic Mysticism'' (London, 1996), pp. 109–110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Radtke, ''Drei Schriften des Theosophen von Tirmid̲'', ii (Beirut-Stuttgart, 1996), pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; and particular verses of the [[Quran]] and certain [[hadith]] were interpreted by early Muslim thinkers as "documentary evidence"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; of the existence of saints. Graves of saints around the Muslim world became centers of pilgrimage — especially after 1200 CE — for masses of Muslims seeking their ''[[barakah]]'' (blessing).&lt;ref name=brown-59/&gt;

Since the first Muslim hagiographies were written during the period when the Islamic mystical trend of [[Sufism]] began its rapid expansion, many of the figures who later came to be regarded as the major saints in orthodox [[Sunni Islam]] were the early Sufi mystics, like [[Hasan of Basra]] (d. 728), [[Farqad Sabakhi]] (d. 729), [[Dawud Tai]] (d. 777–781), [[Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya]] (d. 801), [[Maruf Karkhi]] (d. 815), and [[Junayd of Baghdad]] (d. 910).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; From the twelfth to the fourteenth century, "the general veneration of saints, among both people and sovereigns, reached its definitive form with the organization of [[Sufism]] ... into orders or brotherhoods".&lt;ref name="Titus Burckhardt 2009 p. 99"&gt;Titus Burckhardt, ''Art of Islam: Language and Meaning'' (Bloomington: World Wisdom, 2009), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; In the common expressions of Islamic piety of this  period, the saint was understood to be "a contemplative whose state of spiritual perfection ... [found] permanent expression in the teaching bequeathed to his disciples".&lt;ref name="Titus Burckhardt 2009 p. 99"/&gt; In many prominent Sunni Islamic [[creed]]s of the time, such as the famous ''[[Al-Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah|Creed of Tahawi]]'' (c. 900) and the ''[[Abu Hafs Umar an-Nasafi|Creed of Nasafi]]'' (c. 1000), a belief in the existence and miracles of saints was presented as "a requirement" for being an orthodox Muslim believer.&lt;ref name="Jonathan A.C. Brown 2012 p. 123"&gt;Jonathan A. C. Brown, "Faithful Dissenters: Sunni Skepticism about the Miracles of Saints", ''Journal of Sufi Studies'' 1 (2012), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher Taylor 1999 pp. 5-6"&gt;Christopher Taylor, ''In the Vicinity of the Righteous'' (Leiden: Brill, 1999), pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the Sufis, the preeminent saints in traditional Islamic piety are the [[sahaba|Companions]] of [[Muhammad]], their [[tabiun|Successors]], and the [[Taba Tabe'een|third generation after the Prophet, often called "the Successors of the Successors"]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Lings, ''What is Sufism?'' (Lahore: Suhail Academy, 2005; first imp. 1983, second imp. 1999), pp. 36–37, 45, 102, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[prophets of Islam]] are also believed to be saints by definition, although they are rarely referred to as such, in order to prevent confusion between them and ordinary saints; as the prophets are exalted by Muslims as the greatest of all humanity, it is a general tenet of Sunni belief that a single prophet is greater than all the regular saints put together.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;See Al-Ṭaḥāwī, ''Al-ʿAqīdah aṭ-Ṭaḥāwiyya'' XCVIII-IX&lt;/ref&gt; In short, it is believed that "every prophet is a saint, but not every saint is a prophet".&lt;ref&gt;Reza Shah-Kazemi, "The Metaphysics of Interfaith Dialogue", in ''Paths to the Heart: Sufism and the Christian East'', ed. James Cutsinger (Bloomington: World Wisdom, 2002), p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern world, the traditional Sunni and Shia idea of saints has been challenged by movements such as [[Salafism]], [[Wahhabism]], and [[Islamic modernism]], all three of which have, to a greater or lesser degree, "formed a front against the  veneration and theory of saints."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; As has been noted by scholars, the development of these movements has indirectly led to a trend amongst some mainstream Muslims to resist "acknowledging the existence of Muslim saints altogether or ... [to view] their presence and veneration as unacceptable deviations".&lt;ref name="Christopher Taylor pp. 5-6"&gt;Christopher Taylor, In the Vicinity of the Righteous (Leiden: Brill, 1999), pp. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the presence of these opposing streams of thought, the classical doctrine of saint-veneration continues to thrive in many parts of the Islamic world today, playing a vital role in daily expressions of piety among vast segments of Muslim populations in Muslim countries like [[Pakistan]], [[Egypt]], [[Turkey]], [[Senegal]], [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Morocco]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; as well as in countries with substantive Islamic populations like India, China, Russia, and the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Regarding the rendering of the Arabic ''walī'' by the English "saint", prominent scholars such as [[Gibril Haddad]] have regarded this as an appropriate translation, with Haddad describing the aversion of some Muslims towards the use of "saint" for ''walī'' as "a specious objection ... for [this is] – like 'Religion' (''din''), 'Believer' (''mu'min''), 'prayer' (''salat''), etc. – [a] generic term for holiness and holy persons while there is no confusion, for Muslims, over their specific referents in Islam, namely: the reality of ''iman'' with Godwariness and those who possess those qualities."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/ShaykhGibrilFouadHaddad/photos/a.657828704229541.1073741828.585959144749831/1247518531927219/?type=3&amp;comment_id=1248075658538173&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R0%22%7D]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Persian language|Persian]], which became the second most influential and widely-spoken language in the Islamic world after [[Arabic]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  the general title for a saint or a spiritual master became ''pīr'' ({{lang-fa|پیر}}, literally "old [person]", "elder"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newby|first1=Gordon|title=A Concise Encyclopedia of Islam|date=2002|publisher=One World|location=Oxford|isbn=1-85168-295-3|page=173|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Although the ramifications of this phrase include the connotations of a general "saint,"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  it is often used to specifically signify a spiritual guide of some type.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Amongst [[Indian Muslims]], the title ''peer baba'' (पीर बाबा) is commonly used in [[Hindustani language|Hindi]] to refer to Sufi masters or similarly honored saints.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Additionally, saints are also sometimes referred to in the Persian or [[Urdu]] vernacular with "[[Hazrat]]."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In [[Sufism|Islamic mysticism]], a ''pīr's'' role is to guide and instruct his disciples on the mystical path.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Hence, the key difference between the use of ''walī'' and ''pīr'' is that the former does not imply a saint who is also a spiritual master with disciples, whilst the latter directly does so through its connotations of "elder."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Additionally, other Arabic and Persian words that also often have the same connotations as ''pīr'', and hence are also sometimes translated into English as "saint", include ''[[murshid]]'' ({{lang-ar|مرشد}}, meaning "guide" or "teacher"), ''[[sheikh#Sufi term|sheikh]]'' and ''sarkar'' (Persian word meaning "master").&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In the Turkish Islamic lands, saints have been referred to by many terms, including the Arabic ''walī'', the Persian ''s̲h̲āh'' and ''pīr'',  and Turkish alternatives like ''baba'' in Anatolia, ''ata'' in [[Central Asia]] (both meaning "father"), as well as ''eren'' or ''ermis̲h̲'' (&lt; ermek "to reach, attain") or ''yati̊r'' ("one who settles down") in [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Their tombs, meanwhile, are "denoted by terms of Arabic or Persian origin alluding to the idea of pilgrimage (''mazār'', ''ziyāratgāh''), tomb (''ḳabr'', ''maḳbar'') or domed mausoleum (''gunbad'', ''ḳubba''). But such tombs are also denoted by terms usually used for dervish convents, or a particular part of it (''tekke'' in the [[Balkans]], ''langar'', 'refectory,' and ''ribāṭ'' in [[Central Asia]]), or by a quality of the saint (''pīr'', 'venerable, respectable,' in [[Azerbaijan]])."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[File:Jahangir with sufi.jpg|thumb|upright=1| A [[Mughal miniature]] dated from the early 1620s depicting the [[Mughal emperor]] [[Jahangir]] (d. 1627) preferring a Sufi [[saint]] to his contemporary, the [[King of England]] [[James I]] (d. 1625); the picture is inscribed: "Though outwardly kings stand before him, he fixes his gazes on saints."]]

According to various traditional Sufi interpretations of the Quran, the concept of sainthood is clearly described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=64U41q5MgLYC|title=Classical Islam and the Naqshbandi Sufi Tradition|author=Muhammad Hisham Kabbani|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern scholars, however, assert that the [[Quran]] does not ''explicitly'' outline a doctrine or theory of saints.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In the Quran, the adjective ''walī'' is applied to [[God]], in the sense of Him being the "friend" of all believers (2:257). However, particular Quranic verses were interpreted by early Islamic scholars to refer to a special, exalted group of holy people.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; These included 10:62:&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; "Surely God's friends (''awliyāa l-lahi''): no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow,"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and 5:54, which refers to God's love for those who love Him.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Additionally, some scholars&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; interpreted 4:69, "Whosoever obeys God and the Messenger, they are with those unto whom God hath shown favor: the prophets and the ''ṣidīqīna'' and the martyrs and the righteous. The best of company are they," to carry a reference to holy people who were not prophets and were ranked below the latter.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The word ''ṣidīqīna'' in this verse literally connotes "the truthful ones" or "the just ones," and was often interpreted by the early Islamic thinkers in the sense of "saints," with the famous Quran translator [[Marmaduke Pickthall]] rendering it as "saints" in their interpretations of the scripture.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Furthermore, the Quran referred to the miracles of saintly people who were not prophets like [[Khidr]] (18:65-82) and the [[People of the Cave]] (18:7-26), which also led many early scholars to deduce that a group of venerable people must exist who occupy a rank below the prophets but are nevertheless exalted by God.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The references in the corpus of [[hadith|hadith literature]] to ''bona fide'' saints like the pre-Islamic Jurayj̲,&lt;ref&gt;Buk̲h̲ārī. ''Saḥīḥ al-ʿamal fi ’l-ṣalāt'', Bāb 7, ''Maẓālim'', Bāb 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muslim (Cairo 1283), v, 277&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maḳdisī, ''al-Badʾ wa ’l-taʾrīk̲h̲'', ed. Huart, Ar. text 135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samarḳandī, ''Tanbīh'', ed. Cairo 1309, 221&lt;/ref&gt; only lent further credence to this early understanding of saints.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Collected stories about the "lives or ''vitae'' of the saints", began to be compiled "and transmitted at an early stage"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; by many regular Muslim scholars, including [[Ibn Abi al-Dunya]] (d. 894),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; who wrote a work entitled ''Kitāb al-Awliyāʾ'' (''Lives of the Saints'') in the ninth-century, which constitutes "the earliest [complete] compilation on the theme of God's friends."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Prior to Ibn Abi al-Dunya's work, the stories of the saints were transmitted through [[oral tradition]]; but after the composition of his work, many Islamic scholars began writing down the widely circulated accounts,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; with later scholars like Abū Nuʿaym al-Iṣfahānī (d. 948) making extensive use of Ibn Abi al-Dunya's work in his own ''Ḥilyat al-awliyāʾ'' (''The Adornment of the Saints'').&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It is, moreover, evident from the ''Kitāb al-Kas̲h̲f wa ’l-bayān'' of the early [[Baghdad]]i [[Sufi]] [[mysticism|mystic]] [[Abu Sa'id al-Kharraz]] (d. 899) that a cohesive understanding of the Muslim saints was already in existence, with al-Kharraz spending ample space distinguishing between the virtues and miracles (''karāmāt'') of the [[prophet]]s and the [[saint]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The genre of [[hagiography]] (''[[manāḳib]]'') only became more popular with the passage of time, with numerous prominent Islamic thinkers of the [[medieval period]] devoting large works to collecting stories of ''various'' saints or to focusing upon "the marvelous aspects of the life, the miracles or at least the prodigies of a [specific] Ṣūfī or of a saint believed to have been endowed with miraculous powers."&lt;ref&gt;Pellat, Ch., "Manāḳib", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C. E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W. P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late ninth-century, important thinkers in [[Sunni Islam]] officially articulated the previously-oral doctrine of an entire hierarchy of saints, with the first written account of this hierarchy coming from the pen of [[al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi]] (d. 907-912).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; With the [[ijma|general consensus]] of Islamic scholars of the period accepting that the [[ulema]] were responsible for maintaining the "exoteric" part of Islamic orthodoxy, including the disciplines of [[shariah|law]] and [[fiqh|jurisprudence]], while the Sufis were responsible for articulating the religion's deepest inward truths,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; later prominent mystics like [[Ibn Arabi]] (d. 1240) only further reinforced this idea of a saintly hierarchy, and the notion of "types" of saints became a mainstay of Sunni mystical thought, with such types including the ''ṣiddīqūn'' ("the truthful ones") and the ''abdāl'' ("the substitute-saints"), amongst others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It should be noted, however, that many of these concepts appear in writing far before al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Arabi; the idea of the ''abdāl'', for example, appears as early as the ''[[Ancient South Arabian script|Musnad]]'' of [[Ibn Hanbal]] (d. 855), where the word signifies a group of major saints "whose number would remain constant, one always being replaced by some other on his death."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Melchert, The Ḥanābila and the Early Sufis, Arabica, T. 48, Fasc. 3 (Brill, 2001), p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; It is, in fact, reported that Ibn Hanbal explicitly identified his contemporary, the mystic [[Maruf Karkhi]] (d. 815-20), as one of the ''[[abdal]]'', saying: "He is one of the substitute-saints, and his supplication is answered."&lt;ref&gt;Gibril F. Haddad, ''The Four Imams and Their Schools'' (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 387&lt;/ref&gt;

From the twelfth to the fourteenth century, "the general veneration of saints, among both people and sovereigns, reached its definitive form with the organization of [[Sufism]]—the mysticism of Islam—into orders or brotherhoods."&lt;ref name="Titus Burckhardt 2009 p. 99"/&gt; In general Islamic piety of the period, the saint was understood to be "a contemplative whose state of spiritual perfection ... [found] permanent expression in the teaching bequeathed to his disciples."&lt;ref name="Titus Burckhardt 2009 p. 99"/&gt; It was by virtue of his spiritual wisdom that the saint was accorded veneration in medieval Islam, "and it is this which ... [effected] his 'canonization,' and not some ecclesiastical institution" as in [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name="Titus Burckhardt 2009 p. 99"/&gt; In fact, the latter point represents one of the crucial differences between the Islamic and Christian veneration of saints, for saints are venerated by unanimous consensus or popular acclaim in Islam, in a manner akin to all those Christian saints who began to be venerated prior to the institution of [[canonization]].&lt;ref name="Titus Burckhardt 2009 p. 99"/&gt; In fact, a belief in the existence of saints became such an important part of medieval Islam&lt;ref name="Jonathan A.C. Brown 2012 p. 123"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher Taylor 1999 pp. 5-6"/&gt;  that many of the most important [[creed]]s articulated during the time period, like the famous ''[[Al-Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah|Creed of Tahawi]]'', explicitly declared it a requirement for being an "orthodox" Muslim to believe in the existence and veneration of [[saint#Islam|saints]] and in the traditional narratives of their lives and miracles.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jonathan A.C. Brown 2012 p. 123"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher Taylor 1999 pp. 5-6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="John Renard 2008"/&gt; Hence, we find that even medieval critics of the widespread practice of [[ziyara|venerating ''the tombs'' of saints]], like [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] (d. 1328), never denied the existence of saints as such, with the [[Hanbali]] [[jurist]] stating: "The miracles of saints are absolutely true and correct, by the acceptance of all Muslim scholars. And the Qur'an has pointed to it in different places, and the sayings of the Prophet have mentioned it, and whoever denies the miraculous power of saints are only people who are innovators and their followers."&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Taymiyyah, ''al-Mukhtasar al-Fatawa al-Masriyya'', 1980, p. 603&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of one contemporary academic, practically all Muslims of that era believed that "the lives of saints and their miracles were incontestable."&lt;ref&gt;Josef W. Meri, ''The Cult of Saints among Muslims and Jews in Medieval Syria'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern world, the idea of saints has been challenged by the movements of [[Salafism]] and [[Wahhabism]], whose influence has "formed a front against the veneration and theory of saints."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; For the adherents of [[Wahhabism]], for example, the practice of venerating saints appears as an "abomination", for they see in this a form of [[idolatry]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It is for this reason that the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]], which adheres to the Wahhabi creed, "destroyed the tombs of saints wherever ... able"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; during its expansion in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] from the eighteenth-century onwards.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; As has been noted by scholars, the development of these movements have indirectly led to a trend amongst some mainstream Muslims to also resist "acknowledging the existence of Muslim saints altogether or ... [to view] their presence and veneration as unacceptable deviations."&lt;ref name="Christopher Taylor pp. 5-6"/&gt; At the same time, the movement of [[Islamic Modernism]] has also opposed the traditional veneration of saints, for many proponents of this ideology regard the practice as "being both un-Islamic and backwards ... rather than the integral part of Islam which they were for over a millennium."&lt;ref&gt;Juan Eduardo Campo, ''Encyclopedia of Islam'' (New York: Infobase Publishing, 2009), p. 600&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the presence, however, of these opposing streams of thought, the classical doctrine of saint-veneration continues to thrive in many parts of the Islamic world today, playing a vital part in the daily piety of vast portions of Muslim countries like Pakistan, [[Egypt]], Turkey, [[Senegal]], [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Morocco]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; as well as in countries with substantive Islamic populations like India, China, Russia, and the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Definitions==
[[File:Dara Shikoh and Mian Mir.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5| Detail from an Indian [[miniature art|miniature]] depicting the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[prince]] [[Dara Shikoh]] (d. 1659) seeking the advice of a local saint named [[Mian Mir]] (d. 1635), undated but perhaps from the late seventeenth-century]]
The general definition of the Muslim saint in classical texts is that he represents a "[friend of God] marked by [special] divine favor ... [and] holiness",  being specifically "chosen by God and endowed with exceptional gifts, such as the ability to work [[miracle worker|miracles]]."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Moreover, the saint is also portrayed in traditional hagiographies as one who "in some way ... acquires his Friend's, i.e. God's, good qualities, and therefore he possesses particular authority, forces, capacities and abilities."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Amongst classical scholars, [[Qushayri]] (d. 1073) defined the saint as someone "whose obedience attains permanence without interference of sin; whom God preserves and guards, in permanent fashion, from the failures of sin through the power of acts of obedience."&lt;ref&gt;Ibn `Abidin, ''Rasa'il'', 2:277&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, the same author quoted an older tradition in order to convey his understanding of the purpose of saints, which states: "The saints of God are those who, when they are seen, God is remembered."&lt;ref&gt;Abū’l-Qāsim al-Qushayrī, ''Laṭā'if al-Isharat bi-Tafsīr al-Qur'ān'', tr. Zahra Sands (Louisville: Fons Vitae; Amaan: Royal Aal-al-Bayt Institute for Islamic Thought, 2015), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi]] (d. 869), the most significant ninth-century expositor of the doctrine,  posited six common attributes of true saints (not necessarily applicable to all, according to the author, but nevertheless indicative of a significant portion of them), which are: (1) when people see him, they are automatically reminded of God; (2) anyone who advances towards him in a hostile way is destroyed; (3) he possesses the gift of clairvoyance (''firāsa''); (4) he receives divine inspiration (''ilhām''), to be strictly distinguished from revelation proper (''waḥy''),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Lings, ''Return to the Spirit'' (Lahore: Suhail Academy, 2005), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Lings, ''Mecca: From Before Genesis Until Now'' (London: Archetype, 2004), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; with the latter being something only the [[prophet]]s receive; (5) he can work miracles (''karāmāt'') by the leave of [[God]], which may differ from saint to saint, but may include marvels such as walking on water (''al-mas̲h̲y ʿalā ’l-māʾ'') and shortening [[space and time]] (''ṭayy al-arḍ''); and (6) he associates with [[Khidr]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Radtke and J. O’Kane, ''The Concept of Sainthood in Early Islamic Mysticism'' (London, 1996), pp. 124-125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Al-Tirmidhi states, furthermore, that although the saint is not sinless like the prophets, he or she can nevertheless be "preserved from sin" (''maḥfūz'') by the grace of God.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The contemporary scholar of Sufism [[Martin Lings]] described the Islamic saints as "the great incarnations of the Islamic ideal.... spiritual giants with which almost every generation was blessed."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Lings, "Proofs of Islam", ''Ilm Magazine'', Volume 10, Number 1, December 1985, pp. 3-8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical testimonies===
{{Main article|Miracles of the Saints (Islam)}}
The doctrine of saints, and of their miracles, seems to have been taken for granted by many of the major authors of the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (ca. 700-1400),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; as well as by many prominent late-medieval scholars.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The phenomena in traditional Islam can be at least partly ascribed to the writings of many of the most prominent Sunni theologians and doctors of the classical and medieval periods,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; many of whom considered the belief in saints to be "orthodox" doctrine.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Examples of classical testimonies include:

* "God has saints (''awliyā'') whom He has specially distinguished by His friendship and whom He has chosen to be the governors of His kingdom… He has made the saints governors of the universe… Through the blessing of their advent the rain falls from heaven, and through the purity of their lives the plants spring up from the earth, and through their spiritual influence the Muslims gain victories over the truth concealers" ([[Hujwiri]] [d. 1072-7]; [[Sunni]] [[Hanafi]] jurist and mystic)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* "The miracles of the saints (''awliyā'') are a reality. The miracle appears on behalf of the saint by way of contradicting the customary way of things.... And such a thing is reckoned as an evidentiary miracle on behalf of the Messenger to one of whose people this act appears, because it is evident from it that he is a saint, and he could never be a saint unless he were right in his religion; and his religion is the confession of the message of the Messenger" ([[Abu Hafs Umar an-Nasafi|al-Nasafī]] [d. 1142], ''Creed'' XV; [[Sunni]] [[Hanafi]] theologian)&lt;ref&gt;Earl Edgar Elder (ed. and trans.), ''A Commentary on the Creed of Islam'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1950), p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The miracles of saints are absolutely true and correct, and acknowledged by all Muslim scholars. The Qur’an has pointed to it in different places, and the Hadith of the Prophet have mentioned it, and whoever denies the miraculous power of saints are innovators or following innovators" ([[Ibn Taymiyya]] [d. 1328], ''Mukhtasar al-Fatawa al-Masriyya''; [[Sunni]] [[Hanbali]] theologian and jurisconsult)&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Taymiyyah, ''Mukhtasar al-Fatawa al-Masriyya'' (al-Madani Publishing House, 1980), p. 603&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seeking of blessings===
The rationale for veneration of deceased saints by pilgrims in an appeal for blessings (''[[Barakah]]'') even though the saints will not rise from the dead until the Day of Resurrection (''[[Yawmuddin|Yawm ad-Dīn]]'')  may come from the hadith that states “the Prophets are alive in their graves and they pray”.&lt;ref&gt;Narrated by al-Bazzaar; classed as authentic by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2790, according to {{cite web |last1=Saalih al-Munajjid |first1=Muhammad |title=26117: The Lives of the Prophets |url=https://islamqa.info/en/26117 |website=Islam Question and Answer |accessdate=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (According to the Islamic concept of  [[Punishment of the Grave]] -- established by [[hadith]] -- the dead are still conscious and active, with the wicked suffering in their graves as a prelude to hell and the pious at ease.) According to Islamic historian Jonathan A.C. Brown, "saints are thought to be no different" than prophets, "as able in death to answer invocations for assistance" as they were while alive.&lt;ref name=brown-59&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Brown|first1 = Jonathan A.C.|authorlink=Jonathan A.C. Brown |title = Misquoting Muhammad: The Challenge and Choices of Interpreting the Prophet's Legacy|date = 2014|publisher = [[Oneworld Publications]]|isbn = 978-1780744209|url=https://archive.org/stream/misquoting-muhammad-pbuh/misquoting-muhammad-pbuh_djvu.txt |accessdate=4 June 2018 |ref= JACBMM2014| page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types and hierarchy==
[[File:The Poets Hafiz and Saadi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|A drawing of ''The Two Poet Saints [[Hafez]] and [[Saadi Shirazi]]'' (ca. 17th century), thought to be executed by a certain Muhammad Qāsim]]
Saints were envisaged to be of different "types" in classical Islamic tradition.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Aside from their earthly differences as regard their temporal duty (i.e. [[jurist]], [[hadith]] [[scholar]], [[judge]], [[traditionist]], [[historian]], [[ascetic]], poet), saints were also distinguished cosmologically as regards their celestial function or standing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In Islam, however, the saints are represented in traditional texts as serving separate celestial functions, in a manner similar  to the [[angel]]s, and this is closely linked to the idea of a celestial hierarchy in which the various types of saints play different roles.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A fundamental distinction was described in the ninth-century by al-Tirmidhi in his ''Sīrat al-awliyāʾ'' (''Lives of the Saints''), who distinguished between two principal varieties of saints: the ''walī ḥaḳḳ Allāh'', on the one hand, and the ''walī Allāh'' on the other.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; According to the author, "the [spiritual] ascent of the ''walī ḥaḳḳ Allāh'' must stop at the end of the [[Creation myth|created]] [[cosmos]] ... he can attain God's proximity, but not God Himself; he is only admitted to God's proximity (''muḳarrab''). It is the ''walī Allāh'' who reaches God. Ascent beyond God's throne means to traverse consciously the realms of light of the [[Names of God in Islam|Divine Names]].... When the ''walī Allāh'' has traversed all the realms of the Divine Names, i.e. has come to know God in His names as completely as possible, he is then extinguished in God's essence. His soul, his ego, is eliminated and ... when he acts, it is God Who acts through him. And so the state of extinction means at the same time the highest degree of activity in this world."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Although the doctrine of the hierarchy of saints is already found in written sources as early as the eighth-century,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; it was al-Tirmidhi who gave it its first systematic articulation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
According to the author, forty major saints, whom he refers to by the various names of ''ṣiddīḳīn'', ''abdāl'', ''umanāʾ'', and ''nuṣaḥāʾ'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; were appointed after the death of [[Muhammad]] to perpetuate the knowledge of the divine mysteries vouchsafed to them by the prophet.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These forty saints, al-Tirmidhi stated, would be replaced in each generation after their earthly death; and, according to him, "the fact that they exist is a guarantee for the continuing existence of the world."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Among these forty, al-Tirmidhi specified that seven of them were especially blessed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Despite their exalted nature, however, al-Tirmidhi emphasized that these forty saints occupied a rank below the prophets.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Later important works which detailed the hierarchy of saints were composed by the mystic ʿAmmār al-Bidlīsī (d. between 1194 and 1207), the spiritual teacher of [[Najmuddin Kubra]] (d. 1220), and by [[Ruzbihan Baqli]] (d. 1209), who evidently knew of "a highly developed hierarchy of God's friends."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The differences in terminology between the various celestial hierarchies presented by these authors were reconciled by later scholars through their belief that the earlier mystics had highlighted particular parts and different aspects of a single, cohesive hierarchy of saints.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Regional veneration==
The amount of veneration a specific saint received varied from region to region in Islamic civilization, often on the basis of the saint's own history in that region.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; While the veneration of saints played a crucial role in the daily piety of [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s all over the Islamic world for more than a thousand years (ca. 800-1800), exactly ''which'' saints were most widely venerated in any given cultural climate depended on the hagiographic traditions of that particular area.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Thus, while [[Moinuddin Chishti]] (d. 1236), for example, was honored throughout the Sunni world in the medieval period, his ''cultus'' was especially prominent in the [[Indian Subcontinent]], as that is where he was believed to have preached, performed the majority of his miracles, and ultimately settled at the end of his life.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===North Africa===
As has been remarked by scholars, the veneration of saints has played "an essential role in the religious, and social life of the [[Maghreb]] for more or less a millennium,"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; in other words since Islam first reached the lands of North Africa in the eighth-century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The first ''written'' references to ascetic Muslim saints in Africa, "popularly admired and with followings,"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; appear in tenth-century hagiographies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.R. Idris (ed.), ''Manâqib d'Abû Ishâq al-Jabnyânî et de Muhriz b. Khalaf'', Paris 1959&lt;/ref&gt; As has been noted by scholars, however, "the phenomenon may well be older,"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; for many of the stories of the Islamic saints were passed down orally before finally being put to writing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  One of the most widely venerated saints in early North African Islamic history was Abū Yaʿzā (or Yaʿazzā, d. 1177), an illiterate [[Sunni]] [[Maliki]] [[miracle worker]] whose reputation for sanctity was admired even in his own life.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y. Lobignac, "Un saint berbère, Moulay Ben Azza", in ''Hésperis'', xxxi [1944]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Dermenghem, ''Le culte des saints dans l'Islam maghrébin'', Paris 1954, 1982 [second edition])&lt;/ref&gt; Another immensely popular saint of the time-period was Ibn Ḥirzihim (d. 1163), who also gained renown for his personal devoutness and his ability to work miracles.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It was [[Abu Madyan]] (d. 1197), however, who eventually became one of the ''Awliya Allah'' of the entire [[Maghreb]]. A "spiritual disciple of these two preceding saints,"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Abū Madyan, a prominent Sunni Maliki scholar, was the first figure in Maghrebi Sufism "to exercise an influence beyond his own region."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Abū Madyan travelled to the East, where he is said to have met prominent mystics like the renowned [[Hanbali]] jurist [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]] (d. 1166).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Upon returning to the Maghreb, Abū Madyan stopped at [[Béjaïa]] and "formed a circle of disciples."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Abū Madyan eventually died in [[Tlemcen]], while making his way to the [[Almohad]] [[court]] of [[Marrakesh]]; he was later venerated as a prime ''Awliya Allah'' of Tlemcen by popular acclaim.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Bel, "Sidi Bou Medyan et son maître Ed-Daqqâq à Fès", in ''Mélanges René Basset'', Paris 1923, i, 30-68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Addas, "Abū Madyan and Ibn ʿArabī", in ''Muhyiddin Ibn ʿArabi: A Commemorative Volume'', Shaftesbury 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Abū Madyan's most notable disciples was [[Abd as-Salam ibn Mashish al-Alami|ʿAbd al-Salām Ibn Mas̲h̲īs̲h̲]] (d. 1127),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; a "saint ... [who] had a posthumous fame through his being recognised as a master and a 'pole' by" [[Abul Hasan ash-Shadhili|Abu ’l-Ḥasan al-S̲h̲ād̲h̲ilī]] (d. 1258).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It was this last figure who became ''the'' preeminent saint in Maghrebi piety, due to his being the founder of one of the most famous Sunni Sufi orders of North Africa: the [[Shadhiliyya]] [[tariqa]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Adhering to the [[Maliki]] [[rite]] in its [[jurisprudence]], the Shadhili order produced numerous widely honored Sunni saints in the intervening years, including [[Ahmad Zarruq|Fāsī Aḥmad al-Zarrūq]] (d. 1494),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; who was educated in [[Egypt]] but taught in [[Libya]] and [[Morocco]], and [[Muhammad al-Jazuli|Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad al-Jazūlī]] (d. 1465), "who returned to Morocco after a long trip to the East and then began a life as a hermit,"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  and who achieved widespread renown for the miracles he is said to have wrought by the leave of God.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Eventually, the latter was buried in [[Marrakesh]], where he ended up becoming of the city's seven most famous ''Awliya Allah'' for the Sunnis of the area.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Some of the most popular and influential Maghrebi saints and mystics of the following centuries were [[Mohammed ibn Nasir|Muḥammad b. Nāṣir]] (d. 1674), [[Ahmad al-Tijani|Aḥmad al-Tij̲ānī]] (d. 1815), [[Muhammad al-Arabi al-Darqawi|Abū Ḥāmid al-ʿArabī al-Darqāwī]] (d. 1823), and [[Ahmad al-Alawi|Aḥmad b. ʿAlāwī]] (d. 1934),&lt;ref&gt;M. Lings, ''A Moslem saint of the twentieth century, Shaikh Ahmad al-ʿAlawī'', London 1961, Fr. tr. ''Un saint musulman du 20 e siècle, le cheikh Ahmad al-ʿAlawī'', Paris 1984&lt;/ref&gt; with the latter three originating Sufi orders of their own.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Famous adherents of the Shadhili order amongst modern Islamic scholars include [[Abdallah Bin Bayyah]] (b. 1935), [[Muhammad Alawi al-Maliki]] (d. 2004), [[Hamza Yusuf]] (b. 1958), and [[Muhammad al-Yaqoubi]] (b. 1963).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The veneration of saints in Maghrebi Sunni Islam has been studied by scholars with regard to the various "types" of saints venerated by Sunnis in those areas.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These include:

* (1) the "pure, ascetic hermit,"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  who is honored for having refused all ostentation, and is commemorated not on account of his written works but by virtue of the reputation he is believed to have had for personal sanctity, miracles, and "inward wisdom or gnosis";&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; 
* (2) "the ecstatic and eccentric saint" (''mad̲j̲d̲h̲ūb''),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; who is believed to have maintained orthodoxy in his fulfillment of the pillars of the faith, but who is famous for having taught in an unusually direct style or for having divulged the highest truths before the majority in a manner akin to [[Hallaj]] (d. 922).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Famous and widely venerated saints of this "type" include Ibn al-Marʾa (d. 1214), ʿAlī al-Ṣanhāj̲ī (ca. 16th-century), ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Mad̲j̲d̲h̲ūb (literally "ʿAbd al-Raḥmān the Ecstatic", d. 1569);&lt;ref&gt;A.L. de Premare, ''Sîdî ʿAbder-Rahmân al-Medjdûb'', Paris-Rabat 1985&lt;/ref&gt;
* (3) the "warrior saint" (pl. ''murābiṭūn'') or martyr;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* (4) female saints, who may belong to one of the aforementioned three categories or some other.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It has been remarked that "Maghrebi sainthood is by no means confined to men, and ... some of the tombs of female saints are very frequently visited."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* (5) "Jewish saints", that is to say, venerable Jewish personages whose tombs are frequented by Sunni Muslims in the area for the seeking of blessings&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Regarding the veneration of saints amongst Sunni Muslims in the Maghreb in the present day, scholars have noted the presence of many "thousands of minor, local saints whose tombs remain visible in villages or the quarters of towns."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Although many of these saints lack precise historiographies or hagiographies, "their presence and their social efficacity ... [are] immense"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  in shaping the spiritual life of Muslims in the region. For the vast majority of Muslims in the Maghreb even today, the saints remain "very much alive at their tomb, to the point that the person's name most often serves to denote the place."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  While this classical type of Sunni veneration represents the most widespread stance in the area, the modern influence of [[Salafism]] and [[Wahhabism]] have challenged the traditional practice in some quarters.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Turkey, the Balkans, the Caucasus and Azerbaijan===
Scholars have noted the tremendously "important role"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; the veneration of saints has historically played in Islamic life all these areas, especially amongst Sunnis who frequent the many thousands of tombs scattered throughout the region for blessings in performing the act of ''ziyāra''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; According to scholars, "between the Turks of the Balkans and Anatolia, and those in Central Asia, despite the distance separating them, the concept of the saint and the organisation of pilgrimages displays no fundamental differences."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The veneration of saints really spread in the Turkish lands from the tenth to the fourteenth centuries,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and played a crucial role in medieval Turkic Sunni piety not only in cosmopolitan cities but also "in rural areas and amongst nomads of the whole Turkish world."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; One of the reasons proposed by scholars for the popularity of saints in pre-modern Turkey is that Islam was majorly spread by the early Sunni Sufis in the Turkish lands, rather than by purely exoteric teachers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Most of the saints venerated in Turkey belonged to the [[Hanafi]] school of Sunni jurisprudence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

As scholars have noted, saints venerated in traditional Turkish Sunni Islam may be classified into three principal categories:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* (1) The ''g̲h̲āzīs'' or early Muslims saints who preached the faith in the region and were often martyred for their religion. Some of the most famous and widely venerated saints of this category include the [[prophet]] [[Muhammad]]'s companion [[Abu Ayyub al-Ansari|Abū Ayyūb al-Anṣārī]] (d. 674), who was killed beneath the walls of [[Constantinople]] and was honored as a martyr shortly thereafter,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and Sayyid Baṭṭāl G̲h̲āzī (d. 9th-century), who fought the Christians in [[Anatolia]] during the [[Umayyad]] period.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* (2) Sufi saints, who were most often Sunni mystics who belonged to the [[Hanafi]] school of Sunni jurisprudence and were attached to one of the orthodox Sufi orders like the [[Naqshbandi]] or the [[Mevlevi]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* (3) The "greats figures of Islam", both pre-Islamic and those who came after [[Muhammad]], as well as certain sainted rulers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Reverence of Awliya Allah==
Reverence for Awliya Allah have been an important part of both [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] Islamic tradition that particularly important classical saints have served as the heavenly advocates for specific Muslim empires, nations, cities, towns, and villages.&lt;ref name="Martin Lings 1983, pp. 119-120"&gt;Martin Lings, ''What is Sufism?'' (Lahore: Suhail Academy, 2005; first imp. 1983, second imp. 1999), pp. 119-120 etc.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the sheer omnipresence of this belief, the late Martin Lings wrote: "There is scarcely a region in the empire of Islam which has not a Sufi for its Patron Saint."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Lings, ''What is Sufism?'' (Lahore: Suhail Academy, 2005; first imp. 1983, second imp. 1999), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; As the veneration accorded saints often develops purely organically in Islamic climates, the ''Awliya Allah'' are often recognized through popular acclaim rather than through official declaration.&lt;ref name="Martin Lings 1983, pp. 119-120"/&gt; Traditionally, it has been understood that the ''Wali'Allah'' of a particular place prays for that place's wellbeing and for the health and happiness of all who live therein.&lt;ref name="Martin Lings 1983, pp. 119-120"/&gt; Here is a partial list of Muslim ''Awliya Allah'':

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42984">The '''Whitney Awards''' are awards given annually for novels by [[Latter-Day Saint|LDS]] authors.  Established in 2007, they are named after [[Orson F. Whitney]], a prominent early member of the LDS Church. There are several categories for which novels may be nominated. The Whitney Awards are a semi-independent [[non-profit]] organization affiliated with the LDStorymakers, a guild for [[Lds authors|LDS authors]].&lt;ref name= About-Whitneys&gt;{{cite web |url= http://whitneyawards.com/about-the-whitney-awards/ |title= About the Whitney Awards |work= whitneyawards.com |publisher= Whitney Awards |accessdate= 19 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
Due to the limited number of titles released by LDS authors, several of the genre awards have been combined (such as romance and women's fiction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sixldswriters.blogspot.com/2007/06/whitney-awards-q.html |title= Whitney Awards Q&amp;A |author= Robison Wells |authorlink= Robison Wells |date= 19 June 2007 |work= Six LDS Writers and A Frog |publisher= [[Blogspot]] |accessdate= 30 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
There are currently eight genre categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whitneyawards.com/program-overview/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107213733/http://whitneyawards.com/program-overview/ |archivedate=2014-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Citation needed span|text=While the Whitney Committee has said that they hope to expand the number of genres in the future, they likely won't venture into other areas of LDS art, such as music, poetry, or non-fiction books.|date=May 2014}}

==Process==
To be eligible, a novel must be written by an LDS author during the award year, and be at least 50,000 words long. Any reader can nominate a book.  Once a book has received five or more nominations, it becomes an official nominee.  The official nominees are presented to the Whitney Awards Committee which checks for eligibility and acts as a preliminary judging panel, reducing the number of nominees to no more than five per category.

Finally, ballots are sent to the Whitney Awards Academy, an invitation-only group consisting of authors, bookstore owners/managers, distributors, critics, and other industry professionals.  By a popular vote, they decide on the winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.whitneyawards.com/rules.html |title= Official Rules |work= whitneyawards.com |publisher= Whitney Awards |accessdate= 30 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards are presented at a dinner held at the conclusion of the annual LDStorymakers conference and writing "boot camp."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |url= http://mormontimes.com/arts_entertainment/books/?id=7434 |title= LDS writers attend a novel boot camp |last= De Groote |first= Michael |date= 25 April 2009 |publisher= [[MormonTimes.com]] |accessdate= 30 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 2010 awards (presented 2011), books were not allowed to win in more than one category.

==Name==

The awards are named after [[Orson F. Whitney]], a member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] as well as a poet and writer.  In 1888, Elder Whitney delivered a speech entitled "[[LDS fiction#Home literature, 1880–1930|Home Literature]]" in which he stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;
We will yet have Miltons and Shakespeares of our own. God's ammunition is not exhausted. His brightest spirits are held in reserve for the latter times. In God's name and by his help we will build up a literature whose top shall touch heaven, though its foundations may now be low in earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Whitney |first= Orson F. |authorlink= Orson F. Whitney |title= Home Literature |date= July 1888 |journal= [[The Contributor (LDS Church Publication)|The Contributor]] |url= http://mldb.byu.edu/homelit.htm |accessdate= 2014-09-18 |type= Transcription |via= ''Mormon Literature'', [[Association for Mormon Letters]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The phrase "We will yet have Miltons and Shakespeares of our own" has been adopted as the slogan of the Whitney Awards, and is printed on the trophy.

==Committee==

The Whitney Awards Committee acts as both the organizers and the preliminary judges of the Whitney Awards.  Rules stipulate that the committee be made up of at least four members of LDStorymakers.

Although [[Kerry Blair]] had been a member of the Whitney Awards Committee for two years, the other members of the committee "went behind her back" to name her the winner of a Lifetime Achievement Award for 2008.&lt;ref name= 08-Whitney /&gt;

==Criticism==
One [[Mormon literature]] critic initially raised concerns with the heavy involvement of authors published by [[Covenant Communications]] in the awards process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.motleyvision.org/2007/diversity-or-dilution/ |title= Diversity or dilution?

Although let’s be honest: The Whitneys have way more credibility than the Grammys."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.motleyvision.org/2009/whitney-awards-2008-finalists-announced-yep-thats-what-i-thought/ |title= Whitney Awards 2008 Finalists announced (yep, that’s what I thought) |author= William Morris |date= 9 February 2009 |publisher= [[A Motley Vision]] |accessdate= 30 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3218">{{distinguish|text=the [[World Muslim Congress]], recipient of the 1987 [[Niwano Peace Prize]]}}
The '''World Islamic Congress''' convened in [[Jerusalem]] from the 7 December until 1:30 p.m. on the 17 December 1931. It was attended by 130 delegates from 22 [[Muslim]] countries. The Congress called on Muslim states to avoid trade with the [[Yishuv|Jewish community]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. 

The Congress was called at the behest of [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]], the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]], and [[Maulana Shaukat Ali]], leader of the Indian Caliphate Committee. Ostensibly the Congress was called to consider a proposal to establish a University at the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] in Jerusalem as a centre of [[Islam]]ic scholarship, an idea which the leaders of the prestigious [[Al-Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]] opposed.

However, the Congress was viewed widely as an attempt by the mufti to enhance his prestige in advance of a bid for the office of [[caliph]]. This position had remained vacant since a Pan-Islamic Congress in [[Mecca]] in 1926 had failed to agree on a suitable candidate to replace [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|King Hussein of Hejaz]]. A rival clan of the Husaynis, the [[Nashashibi]]s, helped to ensure that the mufti was unsuccessful in his bid for the [[caliphate]].

Following the election of Husayni as president of the Congress the agenda was arranged as follows:
# Holy Places and the [[Buraq]] wall
# the University of [[Names of Jerusalem#Masjid al-Aqsa|Al Masjid el Aksa]]
# the [[Hejaz railway|Hejaz Railway]]
# the furtherance of Muslim teaching and culture
# Publications
# Constitution of the Muslim Congress
# Resolutions

The Congress resolved that "[[Zionism]] is ''ipso facto'' an aggression detrimental to Muslim well-being, and that it is directly or indirectly ousting Moslems from the control of Muslim land and Muslem Holy Places". It was also resolved that the Congress should meet at intervals of two or three years and that resolutions should be enacted by an Executive Committee chaired by Husayni.

The '''Zilberman Method''' is a system of teaching the [[Torah]] to young students, pioneered by [[Jerusalem]] rabbi [[Yitzhak Shlomo Zilberman]], that emphasizes rote learning of the text, while leaving the more advanced study of [[Talmud]] to older students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=GOTTLIEB|first1=DOVID|title=The Zilberman Method|url=https://jewishaction.com/religion/education/the_zilberman_method/|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rabbi Gershon|first1=Tannenbaum|title=The Zilberman Method: Innovation In Torah Education|url=http://5tjt.com/the-zilberman-method-innovation-in-torah-education/|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schools employing the method are colloquially referred to as '''Zilberman Schools'''.

== Theory ==
The Zilberman Method draws upon traditional teaching methods as outlined by [[Chazal]] and championed by [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] and the [[Vilna Gaon]]. The [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]] set forth [[Halakha|halakhic]] guidelines for teaching Torah to children. These guidelines include the ages at which texts should be studied: "Five years old [is the age to begin studying] Scripture; a ten year-old [learns] the Mishnah; a thirteen year-old for the ''[[mitzvot]]'' ([obligation of the] commandments); a fifteen year-old [for the study] of Talmud…";&lt;ref&gt;Misnah, Avot 5:21&lt;/ref&gt; the times of study (including Shabbat for children; ''Hachazan roeh heichan tinokot korin'' – the chazzan observes [on Shabbat] where [in the text] the children are reading)&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 11a. See [[Rashi]], [[Nissim of Gerona|Ran]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the manner of teaching (''safi lei k’tura'' –stuffing the children like oxen;&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, Ketubot 50a&lt;/ref&gt; ''ligmar inish v’hadar lisbor'' –read the text and then explain it.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 63a&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zilberman method has children focus exclusively on [[Tanakh]] and Mishnah in their younger years, ensuring that they know large portions of both areas by heart before they begin learning ''Gemara'' (Talmud). Indeed, graduates of such schools tend to have impressive fluency in these areas. Two key elements in Zilberman’s methodology, however, must be singled out: ''chazarah'' (review) and student participation.

In the Zilberman-styled school, a new text of [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (Scripture) is introduced in the following manner. On Monday and Tuesday, the teacher chants the text with the ''tropp'' ([[Cantillation|''ta’amei ha’mikra'']]) and the students immediately imitate him. This is repeated several times until the students are able to read the text independently. Then the teacher introduces the translation/explanation of the text and invites students to participate in the process. New words typically need to be translated only once; subsequently, students are encouraged to call out the translation on their own. All translations are strictly literal. If the translation does not automatically yield a comprehensible meaning, the students are invited to try to find one. The class spends the rest of the week reviewing the material. Each [[Chapters and verses of the Bible#Verses|pasuk]] is reviewed with the tropp at least twenty-four times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gottlieb|first1=Dovid|title=The Zilberman Method|url=https://www.ou.org/jewish_action/03/2010/the_zilberman_method/|website=OU.org|publisher=Jewish Action|date=March 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adjustments are made for each grade level.

== Examples ==
In [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] 63a it states, "A man should recite, and only later expound." This is in contrast to standard procedure in the Torah world, where intense scrutiny of the text at a relatively young age is favoured over the covering and committing to memory of vast amounts of material. Zilberman also instituted that school sessions be continued on [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holidays]], albeit at a reduced schedule.&lt;ref name="Yitzchok Shlomo"&gt;[http://www.thejewisheye.com/gedolimb58.html "Rav Yitzchok Shlomo Zilberman: The Zilberman Derech -Charting a New-Old Path"], ''The Jewish Eye''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other practices ===
[[Yitzhak Shlomo Zilberman]] kept the practice of donning his [[tefilin]] all day, and so encouraged his students.&lt;ref name="Goodbye"&gt;Hadar, Alon (23 August 2007) [https://www.haaretz.com/1.4964563 "Goodbye to All That"], ''Haaretz''. "They wore tefillin [phylacteries] all the time."&lt;/ref&gt; In normative practice, the tefilin are removed after [[Shacharit]]. Zilberman was one of the first rabbis to promote the usage of [[tekhelet]], and encouraged his students and family to make use of the dye in their [[tzitzit]].&lt;ref&gt;Meyers Epstein, Varda (3 January 2014) [http://www.jewishpress.com/blogs/ear-to-the-ground/tekhelet-a-choice-or-an-imperative/2014/01/03/ "Tekhelet: A Choice or an Imperative?"], ''The Jewish Press''&lt;/ref&gt;  He encouraged his students to get married young, because it states in ''Pirkei Avot'' “An 18 year-old [enters] the ''[[chuppah]]'' (wedding canopy)".

== History ==
The Zilberman Method is not a new innovation, but rather a return to an ancient form of [[Torah study]] elucidated in the [[Mishna]] and [[Talmud]], and favoured  by both the [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Maharal]] and the Vilna Gaon.

Zilberman found the existing Jerusalem ''[[heder]]''s' curriculum not suitable for his own children, so he began to teach them at home according to his method.&lt;ref name="Goodbye"/&gt; In the beginning of the 1980s, after years of limited success with incorporating his teaching style in existing institutions, Zilberman founded,  with the help of his sons, a school in the northern part of the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]] of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="Yitzchok Shlomo"/&gt; The school, [[Yeshivat Aderet Eliyahu]] &amp;ndash; also known as "Zilberman's [[Cheder]]" &amp;ndash; adopted its founder's method, and became an inspiration for many of his students, who later branched out all over [[Israel]] founding schools with the same teaching approach.&lt;ref name="Yitzchok Shlomo"/&gt;

Zilberman's life work was favoured by rabbi [[Shlomo Zalman Auerbach]] and the [[Dov Berish Weidenfeld|Tchebiner Rav]].&lt;ref name="Yitzchok Shlomo"/&gt;

=== Schools using the Zilberman Method ===
In addition to Yeshivat Aderet Eliyahu, numerous other schools throughout Israel adhere to Zilberman Method principles, including [[Talmud Torah Yishrei Lev]].

'''Žemaičių Alkas''' ('''Samogitian sanctuary''') is a [[pagan sanctuary]] in [[Lithuania]], a reconstruction of a medieval [[pagan observatory]]. The poles corresponding to the gods and goddesses of the Balts can be used to observe the main calendar holidays.&lt;ref name="visitlithuania"&gt;[http://www.visitlithuania.net/routes/amber-road/798-emaii-alkas Visit Lithuania - Žemaičių Alkas]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://zemaitiualka.lt/ Žemaičių Alkas]&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure is located in the northern part on [[Šventoji, Lithuania]]. It is based on archeological records of the paleoastronomic observatory and pagan shrine that existed on Birutė Hill in [[Palanga]] until the 16th century. The wooden poles were carved by Lithuanian folk artists and were installed in June 1998.&lt;ref name="visitlithuania" /&gt; [[Modern Paganism|Neopagans]] use the sanctuary for devotional ceremonies during the major holidays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truelithuania.com/sventoji-resort-328 Šventoji Resort].
