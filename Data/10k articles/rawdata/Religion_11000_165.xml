'''Abubus''', also spelt '''Abobus''' or '''Abobi''', was the father of [[Ptolemy (son of Abubus)|Ptolemy]]. He is mentioned only in the [[1 Maccabees|first book of the Maccabees]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Maccabees|16:11|NAB}} and {{bibleverse-nb|1|Maccabees|16:15|NAB}}, wherein Ptolemy invites [[Simon Maccabaeus]] and his two sons, Mattathias and Judas, to a banquet, subsequently killing them.

[[File:Bala Bodhisattva stone umbrella.jpg|thumb|Underside of the stone umbrella with designs, probably a [[Zodiac]]al pattern, similar to the fully Greek-derived zodiacal patterns of [[Medieval India]]&lt;ref&gt;Avatāraṇa: a Note on the Bodhisattva Image Dated in the Third Year of Kaniṣka in the Sārnāth Museum, by Giovanni Verardi, East and West, Vol. 35, No. 1/3 (September 1985), pp. 73 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/29756714 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;.]]
The '''Bala Bodhisattva''' is an ancient [[India]]n statue of a [[Bodhisattva]], found in 1904-1905 by German archaeologist [[F.O. Oertel]] (1862-1942) in [[Sarnath]], [[India]]. The statue has been decisive in matching the reign of [[Kanishka]] with contemporary sculptural style, especially the type of similar sculptures from Mathura, as its bears a dated inscription.&lt;ref name="Basham"&gt;Papers on the Date of Kaniṣka, Arthur Llewellyn Basham, Brill Archive, 1969, p.271 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ks4UAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA271]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inscription==
The inscription on the Bodhisattva explains that it was dedicated by a "Brother" (''Bhikshu'') named Bala,  in the "Year 3 of Kanishka". This allows to be a rather precise date on the sculptural style represented by the statue, as year 3 is thought to be approximately 123 CE.

The inscription further states that [[Kanishka]] (who ruled from his capital in [[Mathura]]) had several [[satraps]] under his commands in order to rule his vast territory: the names of the [[Indo-Scythian]] [[Northern Satraps]]  Mahakshatrapa ("Great Satrap") [[Kharapallana]] and the Kshatrapa ("Satrap") [[Vanaspara]] are mentioned as satraps for the eastern territories of Kanishka's empire. At the same time a "General Lala" and Satraps Vespasi and Liaka are mentioned as in charge of the north.&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Indian History and Civilization, Sailendra Nath Sen, New Age International, 1999, p.198 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wk4_ICH_g1EC&amp;pg=PA198]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Influence on Ancient India, Krishna Chandra Sagar, Northern Book Centre, 1992 p.167 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0UA4rkm9MgkC&amp;pg=PA167]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Source: "A Catalogue of the Indian Coins in the British Museum.

[[File:Sarnath umbrella shaft inscription Kanishka Year 3.jpg|thumb|left|Complete inscription of Bhikshu Bala on the octagonal shaft of the umbrella.]]
;Inscription on the octagonal shaft
There are altogether three inscriptions, the largest one being the inscription on the octagonal shaft of the umbrella. The octagonal shaft and its umbrella are visible in "Avatāraṇa: a Note on the Bodhisattva Image Dated in the Third Year of Kaniṣka in the Sārnāth Museum" by
Giovanni Verardi.&lt;ref&gt;"Avatāraṇa: a Note on the Bodhisattva Image Dated in the Third Year of Kaniṣka in the Sārnāth Museum, Giovanni Verardi East and West Vol. 35, No. 1/3 (September 1985), pp. 67-101" [https://www.jstor.org/stable/29756714 JSTOR.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Inscriptions on the base of the statue
There are also two smaller inscriptions of similar content at the base of the statue:&lt;br&gt;

At the front of the base of the statue:&lt;br&gt;
"The gift of Friar Bala, a master of the Tripitaka, (namely an image of) the Bodhisattva, has been erected by the great satrap Kharapallana together with the satrap Vanashpara."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/EpigraphiaIndica/Epigraphia_Indica#page/n235/mode/2up EI8 p.179]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

At the back of the base of the statue:&lt;br&gt;
"In the 3rd year of the Maharaja Kanishka, the 3rd (month) of winter, the 23rd day, on this (date specified as) above has (this gift) of Friar Bala,  a master of the Tripitaka, (namely an image of) the Bodhisattva and an umbrella with a post, been erected."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/EpigraphiaIndica/Epigraphia_Indica#page/n235/mode/2up EI8 p.179]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
[[File:Bala Bodhisattva front and back views.jpg|thumb|Front and back views of the Bala Bodhisattva.]]
The style of this statue is somewhat reminiscent of the earlier monumental [[Yaksha]] statues, usually dated to a few centuries earlier. On the other hand, despite other known instances of [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art]], very little if any such influence can be seen in this type of statue. Thus, they are quite different from the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tepotech.com/Art_Bulletin/192794JuneCoomaraswamyOriginoftheBuddhaImage.pdf Origin of the Buddha Image, June Coomaraswamy, p.300-301]&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery was published in the "Archaeological Survey of India Annual Report for the Year 1904–1905", in an article by F.O. Oertel [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.207530/2015.207530.Archaeological-Survey#page/n141/mode/2up pp.&amp;nbsp;59–104].

The statue is now in the [[Sarnath Museum]].&lt;ref name="Basham"/&gt;

A '''bandolier bag''' is a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] bag with a wide strap, often ornately decorated with beadwork, presented to represent honors given to a worthy man.  Though bandolier bags are closely associated with the [[Anishinaabe]]g, they are not exclusively found among them as many bandolier bags have identifiable stylistic tribal and regional differences.  A bandolier bag may be worn either across the shoulder to the side or in front like an apron.  In the [[Anishinaabe language]], "bandolier bag(s)" is ''aazhooningwa'igan(ag)'', literally meaning "worn across the shoulder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kstrom.net/isk/art/beads/bando1.html|title=Bandolier Exhibit Menu|last=Giese|first=Paula|date=1997|website=Native American Indian: Art, Culture, Education, History, Science|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bandolier bags are often incorrectly called [[medicine bag]]s.

'''''Bhiksha''''' is food obtained by asking for [[alms]]. Bhiksha signifies a [[Hindu]] tradition of begging for alms with the purpose of self-effacement or ego-conquering.  

Usually, bhiksha is the meal served to a ''[[sadhu]]'' or monk when that person visits a devout Hindu household. Occasionally, bhiksha has also referred to donations of gold, cattle, and even land, given to [[Brahmins]] in exchange for [[Karmkand]].

The '''Israelite Cemetery''' ({{lang-es|'''Cementerio Israelita'''}}) '''of [[La Paz, Canelones|La Paz]]''' is the only [[Jewish cemetery]] in Uruguay. It was established November 28, 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cciu.org.uy/news_detail.php?id=4450|title=The first 2 tombs in La Paz|accessdate=28 February 2012 |publisher=CCIU}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are sections dedicated to Jews of different origins: [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardim]], Hungarian, German, [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jai.com.uy/?Q=articulo&amp;ID=176 |title=Jewish funerals in Uruguay |accessdate=24 March 2014 |publisher=Jai.com.uy }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[QR code]]s were being implemented for its tombstones, in order to enable web access to images and location data for every tomb there.  It is claimed to be the first cemetery in the world to have introduced this innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/cementerio-judio-se-moderniza-codigos.html |title=Uruguayan Jewish Cemetery QRfied |date=24 March 2014 |publisher=[[El País (Uruguay)|EL PAIS]] }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Christian Democratic Party''' ('''CDP''') is a [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] political party in [[Australia]]. It was founded by a group of concerned Christian ministers in the State of NSW, who had [[Fred Nile]], a [[Fellowship of Congregational Churches|Congregational Church]] minister, run as their Upper House Candidate in the NSW State election. Fred Nile, commonly refers to himself as the party's founder, however the Party states that it was founded by concerned Australian ministers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdp.org.au/about-the-cdp/&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was established in 1977 under the name '''Call to Australia''', which it used until 1998. It is primarily active in [[New South Wales]], and since the [[New South Wales state election, 1981|1981 state election]] has had at least one member in the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]], often holding or sharing the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]]. The Christian Democrats have never elected anyone to [[Parliament of Australia|federal parliament]], although [[John Bradford (Australian politician)|John Bradford]] briefly sat with the party in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] after defecting from the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] prior to the [[Australian federal election, 1998|1998 election]].

== Leadership ==
The [[Fred Nile|Rev Hon Fred Nile]], is the Federal President of the Christian Democratic Party (The Federal party currently lacks a constitution and a Board) and he is the NSW Deputy President. [[Ross Clifford]] is NSW State President of the Christian Democratic Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cdp.org.au/team/leadership-group/|title=Leadership Group ⋆ Christian Democratic Party|work=Christian Democratic Party|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig Hall, is the NSW State Director; the organizational leader of the Party and by extension exercises authority over the Party activities in all states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdp.org.au/?s=craig+hall|title=You searched for craig hall ⋆ Christian Democratic Party|website=Christian Democratic Party|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The youth wing of the CDP "Christian Youth" is headed by Samraat Joshua Grewal as it's President.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdp.org.au/team/young-cdp/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==

Originally established as the "Call to Australia Party" in 1977, the Party was founded by a group of concerned Christian Ministers who had Fred Nile run as their candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cdp.org.au/about-the-cdp/|title=About ⋆ Christian Democratic Party|work=Christian Democratic Party|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Party name  change to "Christian Democratic Party" was a suggestion from an executive of [[Hillsong Church]]. These groups had sought to mobilise [[Conservatism in Australia|conservative]] and evangelical [[Protestants]] as an electoral force. Nile was elected to the [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] in 1981, and the party has managed to see a candidate elected at every subsequent New South Wales state election to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cdp.org.au/about-the-cdp/|title=About ⋆ Christian Democratic Party|work=Christian Democratic Party|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policies==
The Christian Democrats exists to support Christian representation in every level of government – Federal, State and Local - and to promote "ethical values based on...Christian values".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdp.org.au/ |title=Welcome to The Christian Democratic Party |publisher=The Christian Democratic Party |date= |accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cdp.org.au/about-the-cdp/|title=About ⋆ Christian Democratic Party|work=Christian Democratic Party|access-date=2018-05-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party are supportive of family values (including traditional marriage), freedom of speech, protective of children and their rights including those of unborn children, and policies that are protective of established Australian values and systems, inclusive of a requirement that immigrants to Australia demonstrate a desire to learn English.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdp.org.au/what-is-cdp.html |title=What is CDP? |publisher=The Christian Democratic Party |date= |accessdate=1 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218130912/http://www.cdp.org.au/what-is-cdp.html |archivedate=18 February 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cdp.org.au/about-the-cdp/principles-of-the-cdp/|title=Principles of the CDP ⋆ Christian Democratic Party|work=Christian Democratic Party|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are opposed to both abortion&lt;ref name="news2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/warning-that-australian-christians-party-is-a-rebranded-christian-democratic-party-for-federal-election/story-fnho52ip-1226648634383|title=Warning that Australian Christians party is a 'rebranded' Christian Democratic Party for Federal Election|author=James Elton-Pym|date=23 May 2013|work=News.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; and euthanasia&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; as well as pornography, drug decriminalisation and sharia law.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdp.org.au/federal-policies/pro-life-issues.html|title=Pro-Life Issues|date=|work=Federal Policies|publisher=The Christian Democratic Party|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309080339/http://www.cdp.org.au/federal-policies/pro-life-issues.html|archivedate=9 March 2012|deadurl=yes|accessdate=31 October 2011|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdp.org.au/federal-policies/islam.html|title=Islam|date=|work=Federal Policies|publisher=The Christian Democratic Party|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928073533/http://www.cdp.org.au/federal-policies/islam.html|archivedate=28 September 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=31 October 2011|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law &amp; Order ===
The CDP supports rehabilitation of criminals when possible.  They seek "a wisely governed penal system that seeks to restore convicted persons where possible to  good contributors to society."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdp.org.au/policy/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508090224/https://www.cdp.org.au/policy/|archivedate=2018-05-08|title=Policy ⋆ Christian Democratic Party|date=2018-05-08|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economy &amp; Housing ===
CDP's policy on the economy is to ensure ""a healthy environment for business to start and grow".  They support an adequately "remunerated job" to allow for "a balance between work and non-work times" and have an emphasis on "the financial well-being of each person in [the] community".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2015 Nile supported the Liberal government's [[privatisation]] of electricity infrastructure, such as poles and wires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kozaki |first=Danuta |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-30/public-float-considered-for-nsw-electricity-privatisation/6357882 |title=NSW Election 2015: Public float considered for NSW poles and wires privatisation, Baird |publisher=ABC News |date=2015-03-30 |accessdate=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/nsw-premier-mike-bairds-power-sale-passes-christian-democratic-mp-fred-nile-roadblock-20150603-ghfrev.html |title=NSW Premier Mike Baird's power sale passes Christian Democratic MP Fred Nile roadblock |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=2015-06-03 |accessdate=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education &amp; Health ===
The Christian Democratic Party believe that parental input in a child's education plus writing, reading and arithmetic are the basis of a good education system.  They also support Special Religious Education (SRE).

CDP believes that Health Care "should be available, accessible and affordable".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Environment &amp; Social Security ===
According to their 2018 policies, the CDP supports a balanced approach to both environment and social security.  They seek a "good and sustainable use of the earth" and social security for "those who genuinely need it".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Employment, Immigration &amp; Infrastructure ===
The CDP is for local industry and local jobs and "proactively [work] to advocate for jobs growth".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Their policy on immigration reads:

"Each nation needs to manage its immigration so that there is a balance of visitors and immigrants that will contribute positively to the nation. In the last several years we have seen a rise in immigration that has outpaced infrastructure and potentially affecting housing affordability''',''' health affordability, and employment declines, and a strain on the social security system resulting in community disquiet towards some new immigrants. This has the potential to change the character of the Australian society. Immigration needs to be carefully managed, taken on the advice of demographic experts and not growth economics."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Christian Democrats also support strong infrastructure programs for roads, bridges, hospitals, airports, waterways and power supplies.  They state that these should be "steady and affordable" and planned for "future generations", not simply as short-term goals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Controversies==
The party and a candidate,  Peter Madden, came under intense opposition from their policies and political campaign actions by the [[Returned and Services League of Australia]] (RSL).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/private-sydney/pulpit-choice-gives-offence-20110128-1a88u.html |title=Pulpit choice gives offence |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=28 January 2011 |accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their campaign to have the [[Sydney Mardi Gras]] banned because of, as he puts it, "the lifestyle and perversion that it promotes" saw opposition from the RSL as one of their campaign [[YouTube]] videos, which featured Madden, labelled a "battle cry", calls upon "10,000 warriors" to rally against the event and shows Madden in front of the [[Anzac War Memorial]] in [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]] inviting viewers to become "lions" and join him.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The NSW RSL president, Don Rowe, said that returned servicemen and women and the public as a whole find it "totally offensive" that anyone would use the image of the War Memorial to make a political statement.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Don Rowe said to ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', "I am neither a supporter nor a detractor of the Mardi Gras and the RSL has no official position on it, but we totally disapprove of the use of the War Memorial in a politicised way. It is a sacred site and symbolises those Australians who made the ultimate sacrifice for this country and for our freedoms … not for someone trying to make a political stand."

Peter Madden was also criticized by the [[LGBT]] community when he called for the [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras]] to be "moved off the streets".’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/life/ad-puts-a-face-to-gay-marriage-issue-20110205-1ahn4.html |title=Ad puts a face to gay marriage issue |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=6 February 2011 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated in an interview with [[Glenn Wheeler]] and [[Anthony Venn-Brown]] on the [[Sydney]] radio station [[2GB]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2gb.com/index2.php?option=com_newsmanager&amp;task=view&amp;id=8133 http://www.2gb.com/index2.php?option=com_newsmanager&amp;task=view&amp;id=8133] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223084948/http://www.2gb.com/index2.php?option=com_newsmanager&amp;task=view&amp;id=8133 |date=23 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  that one of the main objectives of the [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras]] was "recruitment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petermadden.com.au/media-releases/202-protecting-children-from-homosexual-recruitment.html |title=Protecting children from homosexual recruitment |date=26 February 2011 |accessdate=14 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425163426/http://www.petermadden.com.au/media-releases/202-protecting-children-from-homosexual-recruitment.html |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral outcomes==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2011}}
The CDP has built a small but stable electoral base among conservative Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox and Protestants in New South Wales, particularly in the "Bible Belt" suburbs of north-western Sydney and in some country areas,{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} but the CDP has only achieved modest results in its attempts to expand its electoral base further. The party has comparable support in [[Western Australia]] (which broke away to form the Australian Christians party) but has lacked similar representation in its state parliament because its seats have higher election quotas.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The Christian Democratic Party sees the policies of the major parties as an attack on their traditional views. [[Gordon Moyes]] (no longer a member of the party) explained, "Our Christian heritage is under attack from pagan and secularist forces, militant Islamic groups, a neo communism under a Green guise and a strident homosexual lobby that has successfully gained the support of the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]], [[Australian Democrats]] and the [[Australian Greens|Greens]], and many from the left of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]]."{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

For the 1983 federal election, the CDP formed an alliance with the Victoria-based [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]]. They did not win any seats and contested subsequent elections separately.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The Christian Democratic Party has generally had two (sometimes three) sitting Members in the Legislative Council (MLCs) at any one time. Usually, these two individuals have been [[Fred Nile]] and one other member. The 1984 NSW election saw Nile joined by former [[Liberal Party (Australia)|Liberal]] politician [[Jim Cameron (politician)|Jim Cameron]]. Cameron retired shortly after being elected, due to serious health problems, and was replaced by [[Marie Bignold]]. Nile’s wife, [[Elaine Nile]], joined her husband and Bignold after achieving election to the Legislative Council at the 1988 NSW election. Bignold subsequently had a falling out with Fred and Elaine Nile over Bignold's opposition to the Liberal Party stance on industrial relations; a policy position supported by the Niles.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The restructuring of the Legislative Council in 1991 meant that Bignold’s seat was abolished and she was forced to an early election; but she failed in her bid for re-election.

The party has been involved in [[Glenn Druery]]'s [[Minor Party Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bormann |first=Trevor |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-05/bitter-dispute-erupts-over-senate-preferences-in-queensland/4939300 |title=Bitter dispute erupts over Senate preferences in Queensland |publisher=ABC News |date=2013-09-05 |accessdate=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/special-features/alliance-of-micro-parties-boosts-odds-for-likes-of-one-nation-or-shooters-and-fishers-gaining-senate-spot-through-preferences/story-fnho52jp-1226713114765 |title=Alliance of micro parties boosts odds for likes of One Nation or Shooters and Fishers gaining Senate spot through preferences |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=2013-09-05 |accessdate=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement of Elaine Nile and election of Gordon Moyes===
In August  2000, it was announced that Elaine Nile would retire due to ill health and be replaced with [[John Bradford (Australian politician)|John Bradford]], a former Liberal member of the [[Australian House of Representatives]] from [[Queensland]] who had defected to the CDP before being defeated at the 1998 Federal election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.cdp.org.au/federal-media-release/1660-john-bradford-will-replace-elaine-nile.html |title=John Bradford will replace Elaine Nile |date=29 August 2000 |work=The Christian Democratic Party |accessdate=31 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327030743/http://www.cdp.org.au/federal-media-release/1660-john-bradford-will-replace-elaine-nile.html |archivedate=27 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this fell through due to disagreements between the Fred and Elaine Nile and Bradford. Elaine Nile served until 2002, at which time she was replaced by [[Gordon Moyes]] of Sydney’s Wesley Central Mission. Moyes was elected in his own right at the 2003 NSW election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Clune, David |title=2000 Ad |journal=Australian Journal of Politics and History |date=June 2001 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1877/is_2_47/ai_n28842652/pg_5/ |accessdate=31 October 2011 |publisher=University of Queensland Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Moyes suggested Nile make a bid for a Senate seat at the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]]. In that election, Nile achieved 2.6% of the primary vote, but narrowly missed attaining a seat. Another rival conservative party, [[Family First Party|Family First]], won a seat in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] with 1.9% and a better preference deal. With Nile's return to the NSW Legislative Council, Moyes began to question the leadership of his former party leader.{{Verify source|date=October 2011}}

During the [[New South Wales legislative election, 2007]] the CDP called for a moratorium on Muslim [[immigration to Australia]], seeking to replace them with "persecuted Christians from the Middle East." Nile said the moratorium should be in place to allow a study of the effects of Muslim migration. "There has been no serious study of the potential effects upon Australia of more than 300,000 Muslims who are already here," he said. "Australians deserve a breathing space so the situation can be carefully assessed before Islamic immigration can be allowed to resume.  In the meantime, Australia should extend a welcoming hand to many thousands of persecuted Christians who are presently displaced or at risk in the Middle East."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21364439-2702,00.html |title=Nile wants stop to Muslim migrants |work=The Australian |date=12 March 2007 |accessdate= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525034259/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21364439-2702,00.html |archive-date=25 May 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nile and another CDP candidate Allan Lotfizadeh reported receiving death threats on account of this announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21375264-5006784,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316075322/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0%2C20867%2C21375264-5006784%2C00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 March 2007 |title=Christian Democrats receive death threats |work=The Australian |date=13 March 2007 |accessdate= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fred Nile was re-elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council on 24 March 2007, achieving a vote of 4.4%. This was the highest vote for the CDP since 1988.

===Battle between Nile and Moyes===
In 2007, the President of the Legislative Council, Meredith Anne Burgmann retired from public service&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/web/common.nsf/key/ArchivesLegislativeCouncilPresidentsoftheLegislativeCouncil |title=Presidents of the Legislative Council, 1856 to date |publisher=Parliament of New South Wales |date= |accessdate=19 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314214201/https://parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/web/common.nsf/key/ArchivesLegislativeCouncilPresidentsoftheLegislativeCouncil |archivedate=14 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Council sought a replacement. Tensions flared when both Moyes and Nile applied for the position. Nile subsequently withdrew his application and nominated Moyes at Moyes' behest.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} [[Peter Primrose]] was confirmed President on 8 March 2007, Moyes having received only two votes, Nile's and his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansArt.nsf/V3Key/LC20070508006 |title=Presidents of the Legislative Council vote |publisher=Parliament of New South Wales |date= |accessdate=19 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525033844/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansArt.nsf/V3Key/LC20070508006 |archivedate=25 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Nile was made Assistant Deputy President on 28 June 2007 and then Assistant President 28 November 2007, Moyes began to publicly attack Nile.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Moyes argued that Nile's anti-homosexual, anti-abortion and anti-Muslim focus should be altered and that greater emphasis be placed on environmental issues.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In contrast to Nile, Moyes inferred that the burden of responsibility for Islamic terrorism lay at the feet of western civilisation, the "Crusades" and the "excesses of the 'war on terrors'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gordonmoyes.com/2008/01/07/what-of-muslim-immigration-and-the-existence-of-their-schools/ |title=What of Muslim immigration and the existence of their schools |publisher=Gordon Moyes |date=7 January 2008 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moyes (then aged 70 years) claimed Nile (then aged 75 years) was too old and was too "committed to gaining money and status, and [...attacked...] any who disagree[d] with himself". According to Moyes, Nile was a pathetic figure who has never laughed, has no friends, is a workaholic, has no interests or hobbies, eats fast-food meals and when in Sydney attending Parliament, spends every night alone in a cheap motel in western Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/christian-soldiers-at-war/2008/09/06/1220121593002.html |title=Christian Soldiers at War |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |author=Carly, Lisa |date=7 September 2008 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, Nile wrote in his monthly newsletter that he regretted allowing Moyes to take his wife's place upon her retirement "because of his disloyalty and divisive actions and his frequent support of the Greens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=God's MPs in row|date=3 February 2009|page=8|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=Australia |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moyes stated that the Greens were "far more Christian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/02/03/2480625.htm|title='Anti-Muslim, anti-gay': Party in holy war of words|work=ABC News |location=Australia |date=3 February 2009|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2009/02/03/1233423223158.html |title=Nile calls on the power of prayer to remove a political thorn in his side|date=4 February 2009|last=Feneley|first=Rick|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moyes also attacked the Christian Democratic Party itself, stating that the party was a cult,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gordonmoyes.com/2009/04/20/expelled-for-trying-to-be-more-christian/ |title=Expelled for trying to be more Christian |publisher=Gordon Moyes |date=20 April 2009 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a hypocritical, anti-Christian, anti-democratic dictatorship that adhered to the values of extremist fundamentalism.&lt;ref name="gordonmoyes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gordonmoyes.com/2009/04/20/why-party-expulsions-are-self-defeating/ |title=Why Party expulsions are self defeating |publisher=Gordon Moyes |date=20 April 2009 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moyes claimed that the "end was nigh" for the party as there was a conspiracy to disband the party and form a new conservative Christian political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gordonmoyes.com/2009/01/08/the-end-is-nigh/ |title=The End is Nigh |publisher=Gordon Moyes |date=8 January 2009 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moyes attempted to draw Nile's Parliamentary staff into the conflict by making claims that they had intimidated and bullied his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/web/common.nsf/key/LCStructure |title=David Blunt: Deputy Clerk of the NSW Parliament |date=23 March 2009 |publisher=Parliament of New South Wales |accessdate=19 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206093911/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/web/common.nsf/key/LCStructure |archivedate=6 December 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moyes ignored repeated warnings from the CDP management committee, claiming that they were dysfunctional.&lt;ref name="gordonmoyes1"/&gt; a committee of the "sad, mad, senile and aggressively ambitious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gordonmoyes.com/2009/04/17/do-cdp-members-realise-what-is-happening/ |title=Do CDP members realise what is happening |publisher=Gordon Moyes |date=17 April 2009 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Moyes was expelled from the Christian Democratic Party in March 2009 by secret ballot of its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cdp.org.au/download/Gordon_Moyes_Letter.pdf |title=Expulsion of Dr Moyes - Right of Appeal |date=18 March 2009 |last=Sheppard |first=Elwyn |work=The Family World News |accessdate=18 March 2009 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213191931/http://www.cdp.org.au/download/Gordon_Moyes_Letter.pdf |archivedate=13 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2009/04/20/nile-expells-flash-but-he-wont-be-silenced/ |work=Crikey |title=Nile expells{{sic|nolink=y}} Flash but he won’t be silenced |author=Mitchell, Alex |date=20 April 2009 |accessdate=31 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moyes became an [[independent (politics)|independent]] for several months before joining the Family First Party in 2009.

{{Christianity by country}}
'''Christianity in [[Kuwait]]''' is a minority religion, accounting for 18%-20% of the country's population, or 650,000 - 750,000 people. Kuwait's Christians can be divided into 2 groups. The first group are Christians who are native Kuwaitis numbering approximately between 200 and 400 people.&lt;ref name=ref/&gt;&lt;ref name=num/&gt; The second group, who make up the majority of Christians in Kuwait, are expatriates from various countries around the world. 
There are also a number of believers in Christ from a Muslim background in the country, though many are not citizens. A 2015 study estimates some 350 such Christians in the country that are ex Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnstone|first1=Patrick|last2=Miller|first2=Duane|title=Believers in Christ from a Muslim Background: A Global Census|journal=Interdisciplinary Journal of Research on Religion|date=2015|volume=11|page=16|url=https://www.academia.edu/16338087/Believers_in_Christ_from_a_Muslim_Background_A_Global_Census|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kuwaiti Christians==
Kuwait's native Christian population is diverse. There are between 259 and 400 Christian Kuwaiti citizens.&lt;ref name=ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.refworld.org/country,,,ANNUALREPORT,KWT,,3ae6a88954,0.html |title=International Religious Freedom Report |work=[[US State Department]]|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=num&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabtimesonline.com/RSS/tabid/69/smid/414/ArticleID/147658/Default.aspx |title='Christians Enjoy Religious Freedom' |work=arabtimesonline.com |year=2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402125518/http://www.arabtimesonline.com/RSS/tabid/69/smid/414/ArticleID/147658/Default.aspx |archivedate=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rel/&gt; In 2014, there were 259 Christian Kuwaitis residing in Kuwait.&lt;ref name=rel&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stat.paci.gov.kw/arabicreports/#DataTabPlace:ColumnChartEduAge |title=Nationality By Religion and Nationality|work=Government of Kuwait|language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Kuwaitis can be divided into 2 groups. The first group includes the earliest Kuwaiti Christians, who originated from [[Iraq]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name=num/&gt; They have assimilated into Kuwaiti society, like their Muslim counterparts, and tend to speak Arabic with a [[Kuwaiti Arabic|Kuwaiti dialect]]; their [[Kuwaiti cuisine|food]] and [[Culture of Kuwait|culture]] are also predominantly Kuwaiti. The make up very less than roughly a quarter of Kuwait's Christian population. The rest (roughly three-quarters) of Christian Kuwaitis make up the second group. They are more recent arrivals in the 1950s and 1960s, mostly Kuwaitis of Palestinian ancestry who were forced out of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] after 1948.&lt;ref name=num/&gt; There are also smaller numbers who originally hail from [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name=num/&gt; This second group is not as assimilated as the first group, as their [[Levantine cuisine|food]], [[Levant#Culture|culture]], and [[Levantine Arabic|Arabic dialect]] still retain a [[Levant]] feel. However, they are just as patriotic as the former group, and tend to be proud of their adopted homeland, with many serving in the army, police, civil, and foreign service. Most of Kuwait's citizen Christians belong to 12 large families, with the Shammas (from Turkey) and the Shuhaibar (from Palestine) families being some of the more prominent ones.&lt;ref name=num/&gt;

Although there is a small community of Christian citizens, a law passed in 1981 prevents the naturalization of non-Muslims.&lt;ref name=ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.refworld.org/country,,,ANNUALREPORT,KWT,,3ae6a88954,0.html |title=International Religious Freedom Report |work=[[US State Department]]|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, male citizens who were Christians before 1980 (and male children born to families of such citizens since that date), can transmit their citizenship to their children; however, they cannot transmit their citizenship to their spouses.&lt;ref name=ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.refworld.org/country,,,ANNUALREPORT,KWT,,3ae6a88954,0.html |title=International Religious Freedom Report |work=[[US State Department]]|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuwait is the only [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC]] country besides [[Bahrain]] to have a local Christian population who hold citizenship.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

Traditionally, [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christians in Kuwait belong to the jurisdiction of [[Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East]]. Eastern Orthodox parish in Kuwait was reorganized in 1969 by late metropolitan [[Constantine Papastephanou]] of Baghdad and Kuwait (1969-2014), who visited Kuwait on many occasions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiochian.org/memory-eternal-metropolitan-constantine-papastephanou Memory Eternal: Metropolitan Constantine (Papastephanou)]&lt;/ref&gt; His successor is Metropolitan [[Ghattas Hazim]] of Baghdad and Kuwait (since 2014). His official seat remains in Baghdad, but administrative headquarters of the Archdiocese are located in Kuwait. Today, Eastern Orthodox parishes in Kuwait are administered by priests Ephrem Toumi and Filimon Saifi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gulforthodoxchurch.org/E/GOC_E.htm Official Page of the Eastern Orthodox Archdiocese of Baghdad, Kuwait and Dependencies]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Der Blatt''''' ({{lang-yi|'''דער בּלאַט'''}}, En. ''The Page'' or ''The Newspaper'') is a weekly Yiddish newspaper published in [[New York City]] by [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]].

==History==
''Der Blatt'' was established in 2000, as a direct result of the [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)#Satmar succession feud|Satmar succession feud]]. Prior to that time there was only one Satmar newspaper, ''[[Der Yid]]''. In the dispute over the succession, ''Der Yid'' came under the control of the supporters of Rabbi [[Zalman Teitelbaum]]. This left the supporters of his rival, Rabbi [[Aaron Teitelbaum]], without a platform for [[communication]] and [[public relations]], prompting them to establish a newspaper of their own. The resulting publication, ''Der Blatt'', closely retains the basic style of ''Der Yid'' but promotes Rabbi Aaron rather than Rabbi Zalman as the legitimate successor of the previous [[rebbe]]. The publication adheres to a strict interpretation of [[Tzniut]] that prohibits photographs of women on its pages. Der Blatt follows Satmar's [[Anti Zionist]] stance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20556">'''Doomsday cult''' is an expression used to describe [[cult]]s who believe in [[apocalypticism]] and [[millenarianism]], and can refer both to groups that predict [[disaster]], and to those that attempt to bring it about.&lt;ref name="jenkins"&gt;{{cite book | last =Jenkins | first =Phillip |   title = Mystics and Messiahs: Cults and New Religions in American History  | publisher =[[Oxford University Press]] [[United States|USA]]  | year =2000 |  pages =216, 222 |   id = | isbn = 0-19-514596-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The expression was first used by sociologist [[John Lofland (sociologist)|John Lofland]] in his 1966 study of a group of members of the [[Unification Church of the United States]] in [[California]], ''[[Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith]]''.  A classic study of a group with cataclysmic predictions had previously been performed by [[Leon Festinger]] and other researchers, and was published in his book ''[[When Prophecy Fails|When Prophecy Fails: A Social and Psychological Study of a Modern Group that Predicted the Destruction of the World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Spilka | first =Bernard |   title =The Psychology of Religion: An Empirical Approach | publisher =Guilford Press | year =2003 |   id =  | isbn = 1-57230-901-6 |  page =356}}"The classic study by Festinger and his colleagues was titled ''When Prophecy Fails''."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Goodwin | first =C.

Referring to his study, Festinger and later other researchers have attempted to explain the commitment of members to their associated doomsday cult, even after the prophecies of their leader have turned out to be false.  Festinger explained this phenomenon as part of a coping mechanism called dissonance reduction, a form of [[rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]].  Members often dedicate themselves with renewed vigor to the group's cause after a failed prophecy, and rationalize with explanations such as a belief that their actions forestalled the disaster, or a belief in the leader when the date for disaster is postponed.

Some researchers believe that the use of the term by the government and the news media can lead to a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]], in which actions by authorities reinforces the apocalyptic beliefs of the group, which in turn can inspire further controversial actions.  Group leaders have themselves objected to comparisons between one group and another, and parallels have been drawn between the concept of a self-fulfilling prophecy and the theory of a [[deviancy amplification spiral]].

== Etymology ==
The term "doomsday cult" was first used in the title of a 1966 scholarly study of a group of [[Unification Church]] members by [[John Lofland (sociologist)|John Lofland]], entitled: ''[[Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith]]''.&lt;ref name="jenkins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lofland"&gt;{{cite book | last =Lofland | first =John |   title =Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith | publisher =[[Prentice-Hall]] | year =1966  | isbn = 978-0-8290-0095-5|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctoral thesis entitled: "The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes," and in 1966 in book form by [[Prentice-Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/conversion.htm Conversion], [http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Unification.htm Unification Church], ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Society'', Hartford Institute for Religion Research, [[Hartford Seminary]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be one of the most important and widely cited studies of the process of [[religious conversion]], and one of the first modern sociological studies of a [[new religious movement]].&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America: African diaspora traditions and other American innovations'', Volume 5 of Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, W.

== Psychological studies ==
{{See also|When Prophecy Fails}}

A [[psychology|psychological]] study by Festinger, Riecken, and Schachter found that people turned to a cataclysmic [[world view]] after they had repeatedly failed to find meaning in mainstream movements.&lt;ref name="pargament"&gt;{{cite book | last =Pargament | first =Kenneth I. | author-link= Kenneth Pargament|   title =The Psychology of Religion and Coping: Theory, Research, Practice | publisher =Guilford Press | year =1997 |  pages =150–153, 340, section: "Compelling Coping in a Doomsday Cult" |   id =  | isbn = 1-57230-664-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leon Festinger]] and his colleagues had observed members of the group for several months, and recorded their conversations both prior to and after a failed prophecy from their charismatic leader.&lt;ref name="stangor"&gt;{{cite book | last =Stangor | first =Charles |   title =Social Groups in Action and Interaction | publisher =Psychology Press | year =2004 |  pages =42–43: "When Prophecy Fails" |   id =   | isbn =1-84169-407-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group had organized around a belief system which foretold that a majority of the [[Western Hemisphere]] would be destroyed by a cataclysmic flood on December 21, 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Newman | first =Dr. David M. |   title =Sociology: Exploring the Architecture of Everyday Life | publisher =Pine Forge Press | year =2006 |   id = | isbn = 1-4129-2814-1 |  page =86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="petty"&gt;{{cite book | last =Petty  | first =Richard E. |author2=John T.

[[Social science|Social scientists]] have found that while some group members will leave after the date for a doomsday prediction by the leader has passed uneventfully, others actually feel their belief and commitment to the group strengthened.  Often when a group's doomsday prophecies or predictions fail to come true, the group leader will simply set a new date for impending doom, or predict a different type of catastrophe on a different date.&lt;ref name="snow"&gt;{{cite book | last =Snow | first =Robert L. |   title =[[Deadly Cults|Deadly Cults: The Crimes of True Believers]]  | publisher =Praeger/Greenwood | year =2003 |  pages =70, 79, 108, 111 |   id = | isbn = 0-275-98052-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Niederhoffer and Kenner say: "When you have gone far out on a limb and so many people have followed you, and there is much "[[sunk cost]]," as economists would say, it is difficult to admit you have been wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Niederhoffer | first =Victor |author2=Laurel Kenner | title =Practical Speculation | publisher =[[John Wiley and Sons]] | year =2004 |  pages =117–118  |   id = | isbn =0-471-44306-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Experiments With People: Revelations from Social Psychology'', Abelson, Frey and Gregg explain this further: "...continuing to proselytize on behalf of a doomsday cult whose prophecies have been disconfirmed, although it makes little logical sense, makes plenty of psychological sense if people have already spent months proselytizing on the cult's behalf.  Persevering allows them to avoid the embarrassment of how wrong they were in the first place."&lt;ref name="abelson"&gt;{{cite book | last =Abelson | first =Robert P. |author2=Kurt P. Frey|author3=Aiden P. Gregg | title =Experiments With People: Revelations from Social Psychology | publisher =Routledge | year =2003 |  pages =64–65 |   id = | isbn = 0-8058-2897-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The common-held belief in a catastrophic event occurring on a future date can have the effect of ingraining followers with a sense of uniqueness and purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Reynolds | first =Michael |author2=Russ Vince|author3=Joseph A.

Explanations may include stating that the group members had misinterpreted the leader's original plan, that the cataclysmic event itself had been postponed to a later date by the leader, or that the activities of the group itself had forestalled disaster.&lt;ref name="pargament" /&gt;  In the case of the Festinger study, when the prophecy of a cataclysmic flood was proved false, the members pronounced that their faith in God had prevented the event.  They then proceeded to attempt to convert new members with renewed strength.&lt;ref name="petty" /&gt;

In his book ''Politeia: Visions of the Just Society'', Eric Carlton debates whether or not the term is appropriate to describe these types of groups.&lt;ref name="carlton"&gt;{{cite book | last =Carlton | first =Eric |   title =Politeia: Visions of the Just Society | publisher =Fairleigh Dickinson University Press | year =2006 |  pages =23, 55–56 |   id = | isbn = 0-8386-4102-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carlton writes that the event is only seen as a "doomsday" for the "wicked and unrepentant," whereas members of the group itself often regard it as a "day of deliverance," or a "renewal of the world."&lt;ref name="carlton" /&gt;  He regards these groups as "the ultimate in exclusivity," and while the future will be bleak for nonbelievers due to an unforeseen [[Doomsday event|cataclysm]], members of the group are promised existence in a new [[utopia]].&lt;ref name="carlton" /&gt;

== Media coverage ==

In ''Globalisation and the Future of Terrorism'', Brynjar Lia notes that "Doomsday cults are nothing new," but also states that they are "relatively few."&lt;ref name="lia"&gt;{{cite book | last =Lia  | first =Brynjar  |   title =Globalisation and the Future of Terrorism: Patterns and Predictions | publisher =Routledge | year =2005 |  pages =165–169 |   id =   | isbn = 0-7146-5261-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In ''Mystics and Messiahs'', Jenkins writes that as a result of events between 1993 and 1997 including the [[Waco Siege]] involving the Branch Davidians, violence involving the [[Order of the Solar Temple]], Aum Shinrikyo's [[sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway]], and the [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]] incident, "Reporting on so-called doomsday cults became a mainstay of the media, just as satanic cults had been a decade before."  Jenkins regards the Order of the Solar Temple as more of an example of [[organized crime]] than a doomsday cult.&lt;ref name="jenkins" /&gt;

In ''Yakuza: Japan's Criminal Underworld'', the authors also make a comparison to organized crime, writing that Aum Shinrikyo "...often resembled a profit-hungry racketeering gang more than a fanatic doomsday cult."&lt;ref name="yakuza"&gt;{{cite book | last =Kaplan | first =David E. |author2=Alec Dubro | title =Yakuza: Japan's Criminal Underworld | publisher =University of California Press | year =2003 |   id = | isbn = 0-520-21562-1 |  page =208}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]]' ''The Order of the Solar Temple'', he writes that the media made use of the term doomsday cult to characterize the movement, though former members and outsiders did not know what kind of event would occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Lewis | first =James R. | authorlink =James R. Lewis (scholar) |  title =The Order of the Solar Temple: The Temple of Death | publisher =Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. | year =2006 |   id = | isbn = 0-7546-5285-8 |  page =96}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some see the use of the term itself as a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]], where the characterization of being called a doomsday cult may actually affect the outcome of violent events related to the group.  The ''Canadian Security Intelligence Service Report on Doomsday Religious Cults'' reported:&lt;ref name="kaplan"&gt;{{cite book | last =Kaplan | first =Jeffrey |   title =Millennial Violence: Past, Present and Future | publisher =Routledge | year =2000 |  pages =53–61, 114, 135, 228–229  |   id =   | isbn = 0-7146-5294-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="canadianintelligence"&gt;"Doomsday Religious Movements", ''PERSPECTIVES'', 
a [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] publication, Report # 2000/03, December 18, 1999. [http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/pblctns/prspctvs/200003-eng.asp available online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008080703/http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/pblctns/prspctvs/200003-eng.asp |date=October 8, 2008 }}, last updated November 1, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

Sanctions applied by authorities are often interpreted by a movement as hostile to its existence, which reinforces their apocalyptic beliefs and leads to further withdrawal, mobilization and deviant actions, and which in turn elicits heavier sanctions by authorities.  This unleashes a spiral of amplification, as each action amplifies each action, and the use of violence is facilitated as the group believes this will ultimately actualize its doomsday scenario."&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Eileen Barker]] has compared these concepts to the notion of a deviancy amplification spiral in the media and its effects on [[new religious movement]]s, and James Richardson has also discussed this effect.&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barker |first=Eileen |authorlink=Eileen Barker |title=Introducing New Religious Movements |work=London School of Economics and Political Science |publisher=Fathom: the source for online learning |year=2002 |url=http://www.fathom.com/feature/121938/ |accessdate=2007-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014065725/http://www.fathom.com/feature/121938/ |archivedate=2007-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of the [[Concerned Christians]], use of the term "doomsday cult" as a characterization of the group served as a justification for deportation of its members by the [[Israel]]i government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Gorenberg | first =Gershom  |   title =The End of Days: Fundamentalism and the Struggle for the Temple Mount | publisher =[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | year =2000 |   id =   | isbn = 0-7432-1621-0 |  page =217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Sennott | first =Charles M. |   title =The Body and the Blood | publisher =Public Affairs | year =2001 |   id = | isbn = 1-891620-95-9 |  page =40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''The Copycat Effect: How the Media and Popular Culture Trigger the Mayhem in Tomorrow's Headlines'', author Loren L. Coleman discusses the effect the media can have on the seemingly innocuous intentions of a French doomsday cult.&lt;ref name="coleman"&gt;{{cite book | last =Coleman | first =Loren L. |   title =The Copycat Effect: How the Media and Popular Culture Trigger the Mayhem in Tomorrow's Headlines | publisher =[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | year =2004 |  pages =88–89: "Cultic Copycats" |   id = | isbn = 1-4165-0554-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 5, 2002, Arnaud Mussy told his followers based in [[Nantes, France]] to look forward to voyagers from [[Venus]] who would collect them before the end of the world on October 24, 2002.&lt;ref name="coleman" /&gt;  Though Mussy denied any plans for a [[mass suicide]], both police and the media drew parallels to the Order of the Solar Temple.&lt;ref name="coleman" /&gt;  In ''Apocalypse Observed'', authors Hall, Schuyler and Trinh discuss the effect the media had on the events surrounding the Order of the Solar Temple group.&lt;ref name="hall"&gt;{{cite book | last =Hall | first =John R. |author2=Philip Daniel Schuyler|author3=Sylvaine Trinh | title =Apocalypse Observed: Religious Movements and the State in North America, Europe and Japan | publisher =Routledge | year =2000 |   id = | isbn = 0-415-19277-3 |  page =132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The most prominent example of doomsday cult is various Christian churches and organisations who have been predicting the end of the world&lt;ref&gt;[[List of dates predicted for apocalyptic events#Religious-related predictions|List of dates predicted for apocalyptic events]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/g201511/when-will-world-end-bible-prophecy/ THE BIBLE’S VIEWPOINT: The End of the World]&lt;/ref&gt; or doomsday which is based on biblical verses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://churchandstate.org.uk/2016/11/the-end-of-the-world-will-begin-in-2017-christians-say-and-its-predicted-in-the-bible/ ''The end of the world will begin in 2017, Christians say – and it’s predicted in the Bible'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucg.org/the-good-news/the-end-of-the-world-what-does-the-bible-say The End of the World: What Does the Bible Say?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jw.org/en/bible-teachings/questions/end-times-prophecy-sign/ What Is the Sign of “the Last Days,” or “End Times”?]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the major doomsday events in [[Christian mythology]] are: [[End time#Christianity|End time]], [[Second Coming]], [[Last Judgment]], [[Great Tribulation]], [[Rapture]] among others. However the various sects of Christianity vary widely in their interpretations and importance given to these elements in day-to-day practice; Christian doomsday cults such as the [[Branch Davidians]] usually place a very strong emphasis on the imminence of the [[Apocalypse]] and the personal importance of cult members to its initiation or course, with their interpretations of the [[Book of Revelation]] typically differing strongly or being completely different to that of mainstream branches of Christianity.

'''Ehursag'''  ({{cuneiform|ÉḪURSAG, É.ḪAR.SAG, ekharsag}}) is a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] term meaning "house of the mountains".&lt;ref name="George1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=A. R. George|title=House most high: the temples of ancient Mesopotamia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=31miWZGVevMC&amp;pg=PA2|accessdate=9 June 2011|year=1993|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-0-931464-80-5|pages=2–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sumerian ÉḪURSAG is written as a special ligature (ÉPAxGÍN 𒂍𒉺𒂅),&lt;ref name="EbelingMeissner1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Erich Ebeling|author2=Bruno Meissner|author3=Dietz Otto Edzard|title=Reallexikon der Assyriologie und vorderasiatischen Archäologie: Nab-Nuzi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3q2DZPc-XCMC&amp;pg=PA15|accessdate=9 June 2011|year=1998|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-017296-6|pages=15–}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes etymologized as É.ḪAR.SAG ({{cuneiform|𒂍𒄯𒊕}}), written with the signs É "temple" (or "house"), ḪAR "mountain" and SAG  "head".

Ehursag is commonly associated with a temple of [[Enlil]] discovered by Sir. [[Charles Leonard Woolley]] during excavations at [[Ur]] in modern-day [[Iraq]]. He originally considered this to be a [[palace]], a view that was later rejected in replace for a temple. The location of the royal palace at Ur remains unknown. No graves were discovered under the Ekursag during these excavations.&lt;ref name="Sharlach2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tonia M.

Modern scholars still vary on their interpretations of it as a temple, palace or administrative building. It has even been suggested to be a wing or annex of the main temple, having had some of its foundations destroyed.&lt;ref name="Crawford2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harriet E. W. Crawford|title=Sumer and the Sumerians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eX8y3yW04n4C&amp;pg=PA103|accessdate=9 June 2011|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-53338-6|pages=103–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stamped [[brick]]s used in the construction of the foundations revealed that they were built by [[Ur-Nammu]] of the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]]. Bricks from the [[Road surface|pavement]] bore the stamp of his successor, [[Shulgi]] and later ones of the [[Isin]]-[[Larsa]] period after Ur was destroyed by [[Elamite]]s.&lt;ref name="Crawford2004"/&gt; Ehursag is also the name or epithet of [[Ninhursag]]'s temple at [[Hiza]] and has been suggested to have been an interchangeable word with [[Enamtila]].&lt;ref name="George1993"/&gt; The Ehursag at Ur was restored in 1961 using ancient and modern bricks, a 2008 report for the [[British Museum]] noted that this had collapsed in some areas, especially the northwest corner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arxaiologia.gr/assets/media/PDF/3769.pdf Curtis, John., Rahee, Qais Hussein., Clarke, Hugo, Al Hamdani, Abdulamir M., Stone, Elizabeth., Van Ess, Margarete., Collins, Paul., Ali, Mehsin., An assessment of archaeological sites in June 2008: An Iraqi-British Project., p. 8, arxaiologia.gr, Iraq, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1050">'''''Guruwari''''' or "totem design" or "seed power" is an idea that appears in the [[Warlpiri language]] of the culture of [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous Australian peoples]].  Guruwari is intimately associated with [[Dreaming (spirituality)|The Dreaming]].

Guruwari also refers to the energetic "pattern" in the Aboriginal concept that states that every activity or process leaves an "energetic residue" in the ground, similar to plants leaving an image of themselves in the shape of the seeds. It is, consequently, an important part of the fields and it imprints its metaphysical, deep meaning.

The '''hērbad [[Help:IPA/English|/ˈhɜːr'bæd/]]''' (also ''hīrbad'', ''hērbed'' or ''ērvad'') is a title given to [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] priests of minor orders. 

In the present day, ''hērbad'' is the lowest rank in the Zoroastrian priesthood, and is granted following the basic ''navar'' ceremony that marks the beginning of theological training. Unlike a ''[[mobed]]'' or ''[[dastūr]]'', a ''hērbad'' may not be celebrate the ''[[yasna]]'', the main service. He may however assist. A ''hērbad'' may also not officiate at a recitation of the ''[[Vendidad]]'', which is reserved for priests of higher grade. 

Amongst lay Zoroastrians, the three terms are used interchangeably. Unlike ''mobed'' but like ''dastūr'', ''hērbad'' may be adopted as a professional title in a person's name.

==History of term==
Middle Persian 𐭧𐭩𐭫𐭯𐭲 ''harpat'' ([[Zoroastrian Middle Persian|Pahlavi]] ''ʼyhlpt'') derives from [[Avestan]] 𐬀𐬈𐬚𐬭𐬀𐬞𐬀𐬌𐬙𐬌 ''aethrapaiti'', which the [[Avesta]] uses denote a priestly teacher whose students (''aethrii'') would be taught to recite the sacred texts. By the 2nd century CE, the term had come to refer to a clergyman who taught religious subjects, and the term appears to have commanded greater prestige than it does today. In the late 3rd century inscription at the [[Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]], the high-priest [[Kartir]] refers to himself as ''hērbad''.

There is some evidence that suggest that already by the 6th century, ''hērbad''s performed advanced theological tasks, including translations and interpretation of Avestan texts. The 10th century ''[[Denkard]]'' refers to the high-priest Tansar, who, in legend, is attributed with the collation of the Avesta, as ''hērbad''.

Following the collapse of the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid state]] in the 6th century, after which Zoroastrianism began to be supplanted by [[Islam]], the increasingly impoverished Zoroastrian communities found it difficult to support a priesthood known only for their scholarship. By the 9th century, there was an active rivalry between these scholar-priests and ritual priests, with each group underbidding the other in their attempts to secure an income. For Zoroastrian laypersons, the distinction between the two groups was at best theoretical and by the 10th century, the term ''hērbad'' had lost most associations of scholarship and eventually came to refer to priests that had no theological authority. Beyond that distinction, the terms ''hērbad'', ''mobad'' and ''dastūr'' were used interchangeably.

In the 16th century, the ''[[Revayats|Rivayat]]'' epistles encouraged the Indian Zoroastrians to distinguish between priests capable of officiating at a ''[[Vendidad]]'' reading and the others. That led to the reinstatement of a hierarchy, with ''hērbad''s at the lowest rung on the ladder. Above them were the ''[[mobad]]''s, denoting priests who had completed their training. In India, the ''mobad''s have a ''dastur'' as their superior. This is effectively an administrative rank and denotes a director of a [[fire temple]]. A ''dastūr'' is also the highest religious instance for the community that worships at that temple.

[[File:Jichinsai-himorogi.jpg|thumb|left|A ''himorogi'' built for a ''jichinsai'']]During the Aoi Festival in [[Kyoto]] the ''himorogi'' is a square space surrounded by green branches with an [[evergreen]] tree at the center as a ''yorishiro''.&lt;ref name="sugi"/&gt; A more elaborate ''himorogi'' can also be made with a straw mat on the ground with on it a ceremonial 8-legged stand called an ''{{nihongo|hassoku-[[An (Shinto)|an]]|八足案|extra=eight leg an}}'' decorated with ''shimenawa'' and sacred emblems.&lt;ref name="sugi"/&gt;

The etymology of the word is unclear, but it appears already in the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' and in the ''[[Man'yōshū]]''.&lt;ref name="sugi"/&gt;  The term "himorogi" refers equally to the focal point "tree" and to the sacred space, both of which are deemed to be purified or "unpolluted".&lt;ref&gt;Bocking, Brian.

'''Hinduism in Malawi''' arrived when Indian laborers were brought by the colonial British administrators in late 19th and early 20th-century in what was then known as British Central Africa and later [[Nyasaland]].&lt;ref name="MittalThursby2009p87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knott2016p91"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kim Knott|title=Hinduism: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Ts6CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91 |year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-874554-9|pages=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were a part of a global movement of workers to parts of [[East Africa]], to help build infrastructure projects, establish services, retail markets and for administrative support.&lt;ref name="MittalThursby2009p87"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sushil Mittal|author2=Gene Thursby|title=Studying Hinduism: Key Concepts and Methods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QdBFq2Ia79AC&amp;pg=PA87|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-41829-9|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knott2016p91"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=DAVID LEVINSON|author2=KAREN CHRISTENSEN|title=Encyclopedia of Community: From the Village to the Virtual World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1geOjQ6R0MC&amp;pg=PA592|year=2003|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=978-0-7619-2598-9|page=592}}&lt;/ref&gt; The immigrants, some educated and skilled but mostly poor and struggling in famine prone areas of Punjab, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Bengal, helped construct the first railway line between Malawi and Mozambique.&lt;ref name="Knott2016p91"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederic L.

Hinduism has a very small minority presence in predominantly Christian Malawi. The government tracks Christian and Muslim demographics, but does not recognize other religions separately, considers Hindus as well as the traditional African religions as a part of the "Others" category. The "Others" were about 3.1% in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71311.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2006, Malawi], State Department of the United States&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/pubs/cp/malawiatlas/malawiatlas_06.pdf Malawi] IFPRI&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 1994 constitution of Malawi, many seats in its Senate are reserved for "major religious faiths of Malawi", and only [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] is recognized as "major faiths". Malawi thus constitutionally bars people with faiths such as Hinduism from political representation in its Senate, allows only Christians and Muslims to hold the set aside seats of political power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeroen Temperman|title=State-Religion Relationships and Human Rights Law: Towards a Right to Religiously Neutral Governance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Khag6tbsIn4C |year=2010|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-18148-2|pages=94–95 with footnote 4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After colonialism ended, Hindus (along with Jains and Sikhs) were discriminated against in East Africa, where various East African governments promoted [[Africanization#Africanization of civil services|Africanization]] enacting laws and policies that required commercial and professional sectors of the economy to be owned by non-Europeans, non-Asians, and only indigenous Africans.&lt;ref name="Vertovec2013p87"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Vertovec|title=The Hindu Diaspora: Comparative Patterns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jRRUAQAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-36712-0|pages=87–89|chapter=Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Hindus previously residing in Malawi migrated to other countries during this period, particularly the [[United Kingdom]] starting with the 1960s.&lt;ref name="MittalThursby2009p87"/&gt;

Gujarati, Sindhi and Bengali are the Main languages of Hindus in Malawi. Sub-traditions of Hinduism such as the [[Brahma Kumaris]] have a Raja Yoga Centre at Trikum Mansion in [[Blantyre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brahmakumaris.org/afr/malawi/home_html Brahma Kumaris in Malawi], Brahma Kumaris Official Site, Malawi&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Acintya Bali.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Acintya]], Sang Hyang Widhi as supreme [[God]] in [[Balinese Hinduism]].]]

A '''Hyang''' ([[Kawi language|Kawi]], [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], and [[Balinese language|Balinese]]) is an unseen [[spiritual entity]] that has [[supernatural]] power in ancient [[Mythology of Indonesia|Indonesian mythology]].&lt;ref name="Sang Hyang Widhi"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mantrahindu.com/penjelasan-lengkap-acintya-sang-hyang-widhi-sang-hyang-tunggal/|title=Penjelasan Lengkap Acintya (Sang Hyang Widhi atau Sang Hyang Tunggal) - Mantra Hindu Bali|date=2015-12-17|work=Mantra Hindu Bali|access-date=2018-07-13|language=id-ID}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[spirit]] can be either [[divinity|divine]] or [[ancestral]]. The reverence for this spiritual entity can be found in [[Sunda Wiwitan]], [[Kejawen]], and [[Balinese Hinduism]]. In the modern [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] this term tends to be associated with [[gods]], [[devata]], or [[God]].&lt;ref name="Sang Hyang Widhi"/&gt; The realm where the hyangs reside is called ''kahyangan''; the abode of gods, now a synonym for [[svarga]] or [[heaven]] in modern [[Bahasa Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kbbi.web.id/kahyangan|title=Arti kata kahyangan - Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia (KBBI) Online|last=Setiawan|first=Ebta|website=kbbi.web.id|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Balinese Hinduism|Hindu Balinese]] spiritualism describes hyang as a venerated spiritual existence, that deserves a special reverence. Hyang is commonly described as a sacred and luminous personal form. It is the name for a spiritual existence that has supernatural powers, portrayed like the sun in a dream. His arrival in a person's life gives contentment without a pause for a long time, which is indistinguishable between dream and reality. Indonesians generally recognize this term to refer the cause of beauty, the cause of all existence (creator), or simply to refer God.&lt;ref name="Sang Hyang Widhi"/&gt;

== Origin ==
The term "hyang" now widely associated with [[Balinese Hinduism]] developed in ancient [[Java]] and [[Bali]] more than a millennium ago. However this term actually has an older origin, it has its root in the indigenous [[animism]] and [[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]] beliefs of [[Austronesian people]] that inhabit the [[Indonesian archipelago]]. Native pre-Hindu Buddhist and pre-Islamic Indonesians venerated and revered [[ancestor|ancestral spirits]], they also believed that some [[spirits]] may inhabit certain places such as large trees, stones, forests, mountains, or any sacred places. The "hyang" concept indigenously developed in the archipelago and not considered to have originated from [[India]]n [[dharmic religions]].

Before the adoption of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Islam]], the natives of the Indonesian archipelago believed in powerful but unseen spiritual entities that can be both benevolent or malevolent. They also believed that the deceased ancestor is not gone away or disappeared completely. The ancestral spirit may gain god-like spiritual power and remain involved in their offspring's worldly affairs. That is why the veneration and reverence to honor ancestors is an important element in the belief system of native ethnic groups, such as [[Nias]], [[Dayak people|Dayak]], [[Toraja]], [[Papuan peoples|Papuan]] ethnic groups, as well as many [[ethnic groups in Indonesia]].

In ancient [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], and [[Balinese people|Balinese]] society, this unseen spiritual entity is identified as "hyang". These ancestral divine spirits are believed to inhabit high places, such as [[mountains]], hills, and [[volcanoes]]. These mountainous regions are considered sacred realms, as the abode of gods and the resting place for the [[soul]] of the ancestors.

Several ancient Indonesian inscriptions dated from Hindu-Buddhist period (8th to 15th century), mentioned ''hyang'' either as the name of sanctuary or the name of deity revered in that [[Candi of Indonesia|temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=7cd2Ha7fT90C&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=sang+hyang+candi&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD7Mbm9ZrcAhWEs48KHcxABtYQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sang%20hyang%20candi&amp;f=false|title=The Javanese Candi: Function and Meaning|last=Soekmono|first=R.|date=1995|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004102159|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Sang Hyang dans TMnr 60052123.jpg|thumb|right|The sacred [[Balinese dance]] [[Sanghyang]] Dedari involved girls being possessed by hyangs.]]
In [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], the term ''"nga-hyang"'' means "disappear" or "unseen". It is suggested that the word "hyang" has linguistic relation with the [[Malay language|Malay]] word: ''"hilang"'' which means "disappear". In its development, the term "hyang" become the root word for many terms that still known and used in modern Indonesian: 
* '''Reverence'''. If the word "hyang" is attached with prefixes attribute ''Sang-, Dang-, Ra-''; to form the word ''Sanghyang, Danghyang'', or ''Rahyang'', it is meant to honor or revere [[gods]] or the deceased ancestors. For example, [[Dewi Sri|Sanghyang Sri Pohaci]] and [[Acintya|Sang Hyang Widhi]]&lt;ref name="Sang Hyang Widhi"/&gt; refer to [[gods]], while the stylized name [[Niskala Wastu Kancana|Rahyang Dewa Niskala]] refer to the name of late king of [[Sunda kingdom]]. The term ''Danghyang'' or ''Danyang'' is refer to the guardian spirits of certain sacred or haunted places. The name of [[Srivijaya]]n empire founder, [[Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa]], also contained the name "hyang" which suggested that he possessed supernatural power.
* '''Place'''. ''Kahyangan'' — later ''kayangan'', from the word ''ka-hyang-an'' — is the realm where hyangs resides. Because of the belief that hyang prefer high places, some mountainous regions is considered as the abode of hyang. For example, [[Parahyangan]] refer to mountainous region of [[West Java]]. Originated from combined words ''para-hyang-an''; ''para'' indicate plural, while the suffix ''-an'' shows the place, so Parahyangan means the abode of hyangs. The term kahyangan is also used as the type of [[Pura (Balinese temple)|Pura]] or Balinese temple. ''Pura kahyangan jagad'' is Balinese temple that located in mountainous region as the counterparts of ''pura segara''; Balinese temple located by the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://new.babadbali.com/category/pura/daftar-pura/pura-kahyangan-jagat/|title=Pura Kahyangan Jagat – Babadbali|website=new.babadbali.com|language=id|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dieng Plateau]] in  [[Central Java]] also shared the same origin, it is from the combined words ''di-hyang'' which also means "hyang's place".
* '''Activity'''. The word ''sembahyang'' in [[Malay language|Malay]] is [[synonym]]ous with the Islamic [[salat]] ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="sembahyang" - Maklumat Kata |url=http://prpm.dbp.gov.my/Cari1?keyword=sembahyang |website=Pusat Rujukan Persuratan Melayu |publisher=[[Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka]] Malaysia |accessdate=13 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It actually originated from the combined word ''sembah-hyang'' which means "worship the hyang".&lt;ref name="KBBI2"&gt;{{cite web| title=Sembahyang | publisher= Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia (KBBI)| url=http://kbbi.web.id/sembahyang | language = Indonesian| accessdate = 28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Balinese dance|Balinese]] ''[[Sanghyang]] Dedari'' sacred dance involved some pre-pubescent girls dances in [[trance]] condition. Through complex rituals to summons the hyangs spirits, it is believed that the spirits [[Spirit possession|possessed]] the girls and made them unconsciously dance with complex movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnnindonesia.com/hiburan/20170128232759-241-189763/jejak-terakhir-sanghyang-dedari-tari-sakral-di-bali|title=Jejak Terakhir Sanghyang Dedari, Tari Sakral di Bali|last=Khoiri|first=Agniya|work=hiburan|access-date=2018-07-13|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sanghyang Jaran'' is Balinese name for ''[[Kuda Lumping]]'' dance that also involving performer being [[trance|entranced]] by spirit.

== Characteristics ==
Hyang are said to only move in straight lines. Accordingly, traditional Balinese buildings have a wall called an '''{{visible anchor|aling-aling}}''' just inside the doorway, which keeps the spirits out because they only move in straight lines, and hence bounce off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bali-travel-life.com/bali-religion.html Bali Religion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704121228/http://www.bali-travel-life.com/bali-religion.html |date=2010-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar walls can be seen at the entrance of some Javanese cemeteries. Parallel beliefs are found in other spiritual traditions, as in British [[corpse road]]s.

Other Muslims might have been expected to be sympathetic, even enthusiastic. But this assumed that other Muslim states would take the same view of the relation between religion and nationality.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, Pakistan's pan-Islamist sentiments were not shared by other Muslim governments at the time. Nationalism in other parts of the Muslim world was based on ethnicity, language and culture.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; Although Muslim governments were unsympathetic with Pakistan's pan-Islamic aspirations, Islamists from all over the world were drawn to Pakistan. Figures such as the Grand Mufti of Palestine, Al-Haj Amin al-Husseini, and leaders of Islamist political movements, such as the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], became frequent visitors to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=nYppZ_dEjdIC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=islamistan+husain+haqqani&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZyxrFlb2Q6&amp;sig=qVXsgQtxZHYv-03vbutMRmACGSo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFy7-VqdrQAhUByLwKHUdwCmcQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=islamistan%20husain%20haqqani&amp;f=false|title=Pakistan: Between Mosque and Military|last=Haqqqani|first=Hussain|publisher=Carnegie Endowment|year=2010|isbn=9780870032851|location=|pages=19|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|General Zia-ul-Haq]] took power in a military coup, [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] (an Islamist group calling for the establishment of a Caliphate) expanded its organisational network and activities in Pakistan.

Social scientist Nasim Ahmad Jawed conducted a survey in 1969 in pre-divided Pakistan on the type of national identity that was used by educated professional people. He found that over 60% of people in [[East Pakistan]] (modern day [[Bangladesh]]) professed to have a [[Secularity|secular]] national identity. However, in [[West Pakistan]] (current day Pakistan) the same figure professed to have an [[Islamic]] and not a secular identity. Furthermore, the same figure in East Pakistan defined their identity in terms of their ethnicity and not Islam. It was the opposite in West Pakistan, where Islam was stated to be more important than ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=X2_FAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT37&amp;lpg=PT37&amp;dq=islam+and+identity+the+causes+of+the+bangladesh+war&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JiOwEOoAMu&amp;sig=J818swt1ydiDnbX2GKGQmnnBL0w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQvO-m8vfQAhUDGJQKHQXYA8kQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Causes of the Bangladesh War|last=Cochrane|first=Iain|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=9781445240435|location=|pages=|quote=The social scientist, Nasim Ahmad Jawed has conducted a survey of nationalism in pre-divided Pakistan and identifies the links between religion, politics and nationalism in both wings of Pakistan. His findings are fascinating and go some way to explain the differing attitudes of West and East Pakistan to the relationship between Islam and Pakistani nationalism and how this affected the views of people in both wings, especially the views of the peoples of both wings towards each other. In 1969, Jawed conducted a survey on the type of national identity that was used by educated professional people. He found that just over 60% in the East wing professed to have a secular national identity. However, in the West wing, the same figure professed an Islamic and not a secular identity.

Until the government of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, "Islamic activists" were frustrated by the lack of "teeth" to enforce Islamic law in Pakistan's constitution. For example, in the 1956 constitution, the state did not enforce "Islamic moral standards" but "endeavor[ed]" to make them compulsory and to "prevent" prostitution, gambling, consumption of alcoholic liquor, etc. Interest was to be eliminated "as soon as possible".&lt;ref&gt;quoting article 25, 28, 29, 198 of the 1956 Constitution of Pakistan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kennedy|first1=Charles|title=Islamization of Laws and Economy, Case Studies on Pakistan|date=1996|publisher=Institute of Policy Studies, The Islamic Foundation|ref=CKILE|pages=84–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sufism===
{{Main article|Sufism in Pakistan}}
[[File:Syed Abdul Rahim Shah Bukhari.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Syed Abdul Rahim Shah Bukhari constructed by the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Aurangzeb]]]]

[[Sufism]] is a vast term and many [[tariqa|Sufi orders]] exist within Pakistan where the philosophy has a strong tradition. Historically, the Sufi missionaries had played a pivotal role in converting the native peoples of Punjab and Sindh to Islam.&lt;ref name="Hashmi2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Taj Hashmi|title=Global Jihad and America: The Hundred-Year War Beyond Iraq and Afghanistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BxlBDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT45|date=26 June 2014|publisher=SAGE Publishing India|isbn=978-93-5150-426-9|pages=45–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable Muslim Sufi orders in Pakistan are the [[Qadiriyya]], [[Naqshbandiya]], [[Chishtiya]] and [[Suhrawardiyya]] silsas ([[Religious order|Muslim Orders]]) and they have a large amount of devotees in Pakistan. The tradition of visiting [[dargah]]s is still practiced today.  Sufis whose shrines receive much national attention are Data Ganj Baksh ([[Ali Hajweri]]) in [[Lahore]] (ca. 11th century), [[Sultan Bahoo]] in [[Shorkot]] [[Jhang]], [[Baha-ud-din Zakariya]] in [[Multan]] and [[Shahbaz Qalander]] in [[Sehwan]] (ca. 12th century) and [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai]] in [[Bhit]], Sindh and [[Rehman Baba]] in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province]]. The [[Urs]] (death anniversary) of Sufi saints accounts for the largest gathering upon their shrines held annually by the devotees. 

Although, popular Sufi culture is centered on Thursday night gatherings at shrines and annual festivals which feature Sufi music and dance, certain [[tariqa]]s such as [[Sarwari Qadiri|Sarwari Qadri Order]], refrain from such traditions and believe in paying visit to the shrines, making prayers or reciting [[manqabat]]. Moreover, contemporary Islamic fundamentalists also criticize the popular tradition of singing, dance and music, which in their view, does not accurately reflect the teachings and practice of the Prophet [[Mohammad]] and his companions. There have been terrorist attacks directed at Sufi shrines and festivals, five in 2010 that killed 64 people. Presently, the known [[tariqa]]s in Pakistan have maintained their organisations usually known as tehreeks and have their [[khanqah]]s for the [[dhikr]] of Allah, as per the old age Sufi tradition.&lt;ref name=NYTSufivideo&gt;{{cite news|title=Sufism Under attack in Pakistan|url=http://video.nytimes.com/video/2011/01/06/world/asia/1248069532117/sufism-under-attack-in-pakistan.html|accessdate=May 21, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|author=Produced by Charlotte Buchen|format=video}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTAtWarSufi&gt;{{cite news|title=The Islam That Hard-Liners Hate|url=http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/the-islam-that-hard-liners-hate/|accessdate=May 21, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 6, 2011|author=Huma Imtiaz|author2=Charlotte Buchen|format=blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hazrat Sakhi Sultan|first1=Mohammad Najib ur Rehman|title=Visiting Shrines of Sufi Saints|publisher=Sultan ul Faqr Publications Regd|isbn=9789699795183|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlyMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA337&amp;dq=dawat+e+qaboor&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAGoVChMI4ejbuMTlyAIVghweCh2HyQNH#v=onepage&amp;q=dawat%20e%20qaboor&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quranists===
Muslims who reject the authority of [[hadith]], known as [[Quranist]], Quraniyoon, or Ahle Quran, are also present in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;Ali Usman Qasmi, [http://www.thefridaytimes.com/beta3/tft/article.php?issue=20130125&amp;page=16 A mosque for Qurani Namaz], ''The Friday Times'', Retrieved February 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nondenominational===
Roughly twelve per cent of Pakistani Muslims self-describe or have beliefs overlapping with [[non-denominational Muslim]]s. These Muslims have beliefs that by and large overlap with those of the majority of Muslims and the difference in their prayers are usually non-existent or negligible. Nonetheless, in censuses asking for a clarification on which strand or rite of Muslim faith they most closely align, they usually answer "just a Muslim".&lt;ref&gt;Pewforum Chapter 1: Religious Affiliation retrieved, retrieved 11 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ahmadiyya===
{{Main article|Ahmadiyya in Pakistan}}
The minority group [[Ahmadiyya]] is also present. In 1974, the [[government of Pakistan]] amended the [[Constitution of Pakistan]] to define a Muslim "as a person who believes in finality of [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]]" and technically Ahmadis are declared non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/holyprophet/|title=The Holy Prophet Muhammad|publisher=Ahmadiyya Muslim Community|accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmadis believe in [[Muhammad]] as the best and the last law bearing prophet and [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] as the [[Christ]] of Muslims. Consequently, they were declared [[Kafir|non-Muslims]] by a [[Parliament of Pakistan|parliamentary]] tribunal. There are approximately 2 million Ahmadis in the country. This equates to around 1% of the population.&lt;ref name="ahmadi"/&gt;

==Conversions to Islam==
There have been conversions to Islam from the religious minorities of Pakistan. [[Deen Mohammad Shaikh]], a former Hindu, is a Muslim [[Dawah|missionary]] from Matli in [[Badin District]] of Sindh province and has converted over 110,000 [[Hindu]]s to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/325623/100000-conversions-and-counting-meet-the-ex-hindu-who-herds-souls-to-the-hereafter/|title=100,000 conversions and counting, meet the ex-Hindu who herds souls to the Hereafter - The Express Tribune|date=2012-01-23|work=The Express Tribune|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Islam by country}}
'''Islam in Romania''' is a minority religion followed by 6.7 percent of population, but the religion has 700 years of tradition in [[Northern Dobruja]], a region on the [[Black Sea]] coast which was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] for almost five centuries (ca. 1420-1878). In present-day [[Romania]], most adherents to [[Islam]] belong to the [[Tatars in Romania|Tatar]] and [[Turks of Romania|Turkish]] ethnic communities and follow the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] doctrine. The Islamic religion is one of the [[Religion in Romania|16 rites awarded state recognition]].

According to tradition, Islam was first established locally around by an Alevi [[Sufi]] leader [[Sari Saltik]] also revered by the Sunnis during the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] epoch. The Islamic presence in Northern Dobruja was expanded by Ottoman overseeing and successive immigration, but has been in steady decline since the late 19th century. In Wallachia and Moldavia, the two [[Danubian Principalities]], the era of Ottoman [[suzerainty]] was not accompanied by a growth in the number of Muslims, whose presence there was always marginal. Also linked to the Ottoman Empire, groups of Islamic colonists in other parts of present-day Romania were relocated by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] expansion or by various other political changes.

After Northern Dobruja became part of Romania following the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, the community preserved its self-determining status. This changed during the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], when Romanian Muslims were subject to a measure of supervision by the state, but the group again emancipated itself after the Romanian Revolution of 1989. Its interests are represented by the [[Mufti]]yat (''Muftiyatul Cultului Musulman din România''), which was created as the reunion of two separate such institutions.

==Demographics and organization==
[[File:Musulmani_Romania_(2002).png|thumb|Percentage of Muslims by settlement, 2002]]
According to the 2011 census, 64,337 people, approx. 0.3% of the total population, indicated that their religion was Islam.&lt;ref name="nielsen"&gt;Irina Vainovski-Mihai, "Romania", in Jørgen Nielsen, Samim Akgönül, Ahmet Alibašić, Egdunas Racius (eds.), ''Yearbook of Muslims in Europe'', [[Brill Publishers]], Leiden, 2014, p.499. {{ISBN|978-90-04-27754-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of Romania's believers in Islam are Sunnis who adhere to the [[Hanafi]] school. Ethnically, they are mostly Tatars ([[Crimean Tatars in Romania|Crimean Tatars]] and a number of [[Nogais]]), followed by Turks, as well as [[Muslim Roma]] (as much as 15,000 people in one estimate),&lt;ref name="oprisangrigore"&gt;Ana Oprișan, [[George Grigore]], [http://www.isim.nl/files/newsl_8.pdf "The Muslim Gypsies in Romania"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412030944/http://www.isim.nl/files/newsl_8.pdf |date=2007-04-12 }}, in International Institute for the Study of Islam in the Modern World (ISIM) Newsletter 8, September 2001, p.32.

The nationwide Islamic community is internally divided into 50 local groups of Muslims, each of whom elects its own leadership committee.&lt;ref name="sscislamic"/&gt; Members provide funding for the religious institution, which is supplemented by state donations and subsidies, as well by assistance from international Islamic organizations.&lt;ref name="sscislamic"/&gt;

The [[Mullah|Muslim clergy]] in Romania includes ''[[imam]]s'', ''[[Khatib|imam-hatips]]'', and ''[[muezzin]]s''.&lt;ref name="sscislamic"/&gt; As of 2008, the Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs recognizes 35 ''imams''.&lt;ref name="sscislamic"/&gt; The Constanța Mufti, who is the community's main representative, is elected by a secret ballot from among the ''imams''.&lt;ref name="sscislamic"/&gt; He is assisted by a [[synod]]al body, the ''Sura Islam'', which comprises 23 members and offers advice on matters of administration and discipline.&lt;ref name="sscislamic"/&gt; The current Mufti is [[Murat Iusuf]].&lt;ref name="sscislamic"/&gt;

==History==

===Early presence===
The first significant numbers of Muslims arrived in Romania with the [[Pechenegs]] and [[Cumans]]. Around 1061, when the Pechenegs ruled in [[Wallachia]] and Moldavia, there was a Muslim minority among them, as was among the Cumans.&lt;ref name="dulciu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Dan Toma Dulciu, [http://www.sud-est.md/numere/20020709/article_15/ "Prezențe musulmane în spațiul românesc"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524042418/http://www.sud-est.md/numere/20020709/article_15/ |date=2007-05-24 }}, in ''[[Revista Sud-Est]]'', 2002/2/48.

Muslim presence is traditional in [[Dobruja]], and partly predates both Ottoman rule and the creation of the neighboring [[Danubian Principalities]]. Both the Pechengs and Cumans were present in the area, where they probably established a number of small communities.&lt;ref name="crgagauz"&gt;{{ro icon}} Constantin Rezachevici, [http://www.itcnet.ro/history/archive/mi1997/current5/mi60.htm "Găgăuzii" (part I)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126232358/http://www.itcnet.ro/history/archive/mi1997/current5/mi60.htm |date=2007-01-26 }}, in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', May 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1260, two [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm|Rûm Seljuq]] community leaders, the deposed Sultan [[Kaykaus II]] and the mystic Sari Saltik, were allowed to settle the region during the reign of [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]], ruler of the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref name="sscislamic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dulciu"/&gt; Kaykaus, who arrived in Dobruja with his brother and co-ruler [[Kilij Arslan IV]],&lt;ref name="crgagauz"/&gt; was reportedly followed by as many as 12,000 of his subjects.&lt;ref name="dulciu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crgagauz"/&gt; Researchers such as [[Franz Babinger]] and [[Gheorghe I. Brătianu]] endorse the view that Saltuk and his followers were in fact [[Shia Islam|Shiite]] [[Alevi]]s who came fron Anatolia.&lt;ref name="crgagauz"/&gt;

The exact location of their earliest area of settlement is disputed: a group of historians proposes that the group was probably tasked with defending the Byzantine border to the north, and settled in and around what later became known as Babadag,&lt;ref name="dulciu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crgagauz"/&gt; while another one centers this presence on the Southern Dobrujan strip of land known as [[Kaliakra]] (presently in [[Bulgaria]]).&lt;ref name="crgagauz"/&gt; In addition, various historians argue that this Seljuq migration was the decisive contributor to the [[ethnogenesis]] of the [[Gagauz people]], which, some of them believe, could also have involved the Cumans, Pechenegs, [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]] and other [[Turkic peoples]].&lt;ref name="crgagauz"/&gt; The Gagauz, few of whom have endured in Dobruja, are majority [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], a fact which was attributed to a process of [[religious conversion]] from Islam.&lt;ref name="crgagauz"/&gt;

The presence of [[Tatars]] was notably attested through the works of [[Berber people|Berber]] traveler [[Ibn Battuta]], who passed through the area in 1334.&lt;ref name="grigoremuslimsinro"/&gt; In Ibn Battuta's time, the region was regarded as a westernmost possession of the Tatar [[Golden Horde]], a [[khanate]] centered on the [[Eurasian Steppe]].&lt;ref name="crgagauz"/&gt; Archeology has uncovered that another Tatar group, belonging to the Golden Horde, came to Dobruja during the rule of [[Nogai Khan]], and were probably closely related to the present-day Nogais.&lt;ref name="grigoremuslimsinro"/&gt; Following [[Timur]]'s offensives, the troops of [[Aktai Khan]] visited the region in the mid-14th century and around 100,000 Tatars settled there.&lt;ref name="dulciu"/&gt;

Before and after the Golden Horde fell, Dobrujan Muslims, like the [[Crimean Tatars]], were recipients of its cultural influences, and the language in use was [[Kipchak language|Kipchak]].&lt;ref name="dulciu"/&gt; The extension of Ottoman rule, effected under [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultans]] [[Bayezid I]] and [[Mehmed I]],&lt;ref name="grigoremuslimsinro"/&gt; brought the influence of [[Ottoman Turkish language|Medieval Turkish]],&lt;ref name="dulciu"/&gt; as Dobruja was added to the ''[[Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire|Beylerbeylik]]'' of [[Rumelia]].&lt;ref name="grigoremuslimsinro"/&gt;

The grave of Sari Saltik, reportedly first erected into a monument by Sultan Bayezid, has since endured as a major shrine in Romanian Islam.&lt;ref name="crgagauz"/&gt; The shrine, which has been described as a [[cenotaph]], is one of many places where the ''Sheikh'' is supposed to be buried: a similar tradition is held by various local communities throughout the [[Balkans]], who argue that his tomb is located in Kaliakra, [[Babaeski]], [[Blagaj]], [[Edirne]], the [[Has District]], [[Krujë]], or [[Sveti Naum]].&lt;ref name="apmorts"&gt;Alexandre Popovic, "Morts de saints et tombeaux miraculeux", in Gilles Veinstein (ed.), ''Les Ottomans et la Mort: Permanences et mutations'', [[Brill Publishers]], Leiden, New York &amp; Köln, 1996, p.98-99. {{ISBN|90-04-10505-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other accounts hold that Saltuk was buried in the Anatolian city of [[İznik]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=3021 ''Sari Saltuk Tomb''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810210049/http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=3021 |date=2009-08-10 }}, on [[ArchNet]]. Retrieved February 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Buzău]], [[Wallachia]], or even as far south as the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] island of [[Corfu]] or as far north as the [[Poland|Polish]] city of [[Gdańsk]].&lt;ref name="apmorts"/&gt; The toponym ''Babadağ'' (Turkish for "Old Man's Mountain", later adapted into [[Romanian language|Romanian]] as ''Babadag'') is a probable reference to Sari Saltik, and a Dobrujan Muslim account recorded by chronicler [[Evliya Çelebi]] in the late 15th century has it that the name surfaced soon after a Christian attack partly destroyed the tomb.&lt;ref name="crgagauz"/&gt;

The oldest ''[[madrasah]]'' in Dobruja and Romania as a whole was set up in Babadag, on orders from [[Bayezid II]] (1484); it was moved to [[Medgidia]] in 1903.&lt;ref name="grigoremuslimsinro"/&gt; From the same period onwards, groups of Muslim Tatars and Oghuz Turks from Anatolia were settled into Dobruja at various intervals;&lt;ref name="grigoremuslimsinro"/&gt; in 1525, a sizable group of these, originating from the ports of [[Samsun]] and [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]], moved to Babadag.&lt;ref name="dulciu"/&gt; Bayezid also asked [[Volga Tatars]] to resettle into northern Dobruja.&lt;ref name="grigoremuslimsinro"/&gt;

===In late medieval Wallachia and Moldavia===
[[File:Mangalia Mosque1020578.jpg|thumb|270px|Mosque in [[Mangalia]], with [[Ottoman architecture]].]]
In the two [[Danubian Principalities]], Ottoman suzerainty had an overall reduced impact on the local population, and the impact of Islam was itself much reduced. Wallachia and Moldavia enjoyed a large degree of autonomy, and their history was punctuated by episodes of revolt and momentary independence. After 1417, when Ottoman domination over Wallachia first became effective, the towns of [[Turnu Măgurele|Turnu]] and Giurgiu were annexed as ''[[qadaa|kaza]]s'', a rule enforced until the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] in 1829 (the status was briefly extended to [[Brăila]] in 1542).&lt;ref name="dulciu"/&gt;

For the following centuries, three conversions in the ranks of acting or former local ''[[hospodar]]s'' are documented: [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Wallachian Princes]] [[Radu cel Frumos]] (1462–1475) and [[Mihnea Turcitul]] (1577–1591), and [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Moldavian Prince]] [[Ilie II Rareș]] (1546–1551). At the other end of the social spectrum, Moldavia held a sizable population of Tatar [[Slavery|slaves]], who shared this status with all local Roma people (''see [[Slavery in Romania]]''). While Roma slavery also existed in Wallachia, the presence of Tatar slaves there has not been documented, and is only theorized.&lt;ref name="varoma"&gt;Viorel Achim, ''The Roma in Romanian History'', [[Central European University Press]], Budapest, 2004, p.28. {{ISBN|963-9241-84-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population may have foremost comprised Muslim Nogais from the [[Budjak|Bujak]] who were captured in skirmishes, although, according to one theory, the first of them may have been [[Cumans]] captured long before the first Ottoman and Tatar incursions.&lt;ref name="varoma"/&gt;

The issue of Muslim presence on the territory of the two countries is often viewed in relation to the relations between the Ottoman Sultans and local Princes. Romanian historiography has generally claimed that the latter two were bound by bilateral treaties with the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]]. One of the main issues was that of ''[[Capitulations (Ottoman)|Capitulations]]'' (Ottoman Turkish: ''ahdnâme''), which were supposedly agreed between the two states and the Ottoman Empire at some point in the Middle Ages. Such documents have not been preserved: modern Romanian historians have revealed that ''Capitulations'', as invoked in the 18th and 19th centuries to invoke Romanian rights vis à vis the Ottomans, and as reclaimed by [[Nationalism|nationalist]] discourse in the 20th century, were forgeries.&lt;ref name="Boia, p.79"&gt;Boia, p.79&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, Ottoman documents referring to Wallachia and Moldavia were unilateral decrees issued by the Sultan.&lt;ref name="Boia, p.79"/&gt; In one compromise version published in 1993, Romanian historian Mihai Maxim argues that, although these were unilateral acts, they were viewed as treaties by the Wallachian and Moldavian rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.245&lt;/ref&gt;

Provisions toward Muslim-Christian relations have traditionally been assessed by taking in view later policies. According to one prominent interpretation, this would mean that the Principalities were regarded by the Ottomans as belonging to the ''[[Dâr al ahd']]'' ("Abode of the Covenant"), a status granted to them in exchange for material gains.&lt;ref&gt;Feodorov, p.302-304; Angela Jianu, "Women, Fashion and Europeanization: The Romanian Principalities, 1750-1830", in Amila Buturovic, Irvin Cemil Schick, ''Women in the Ottoman Balkans: Gender, Culture and History'', [[I.B. Tauris]], London &amp; New York, 2007, p.202. {{ISBN|1-84511-505-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the Ottoman Empire did not maintain troops or [[garrison]]s or build military facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Ștefan Gorovei, "Moldova în Casa Păcii, pe marginea izvoarelor privind primul secol de relații moldo-otomane", in ''Anuarul Institutului de Istorie și Arheologie A. D. Xenopol'', XVII, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, as it happened in several instances, Ottoman Sultans allowed their Tatar subjects to raid Moldavia or Wallachia as a means to punish the dissent of local Princes.&lt;ref&gt;Feodorov, p.304&lt;/ref&gt; Literary historian Ioana Feodorov notes that the relations between the two smaller states and the Ottoman suzerain were based on a set of principles and rules to which the Ottoman Empire adhered, and indicates that, early in the 17th century, this system drew admiration from the [[Arabic-speaking Christians|Arabic-speaking Christian]] traveler [[Paul of Aleppo]].&lt;ref&gt;Feodorov, p.300-304&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th-19th century===
[[File:Timisoara1656.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Mosques in [[Timișoara]], 1656.]]

By the 17th century, according to the notes of traveler [[Evliya Çelebi]], Dobruja was also home to a distinct community of people of mixed Turkish and Wallachian heritage.&lt;ref name="dulciu"/&gt; Additionally, a part of the Dobrujan Roma community has traditionally adhered to Islam;&lt;ref name="oprisangrigore"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dulciu"/&gt; it is believed that it originated with groups of Romani people serving in the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Army]] during the 16th century,&lt;ref name="oprisangrigore"/&gt; and has probably incorporated various ethnic Turks who had not settled down in the cities or villages.&lt;ref name="grigoremuslimsinro"/&gt; Alongside Dobruja, a part of present-day Romania under direct Ottoman rule in 1551-1718 was the [[Temeșvar Province, Ottoman Empire|Eyalet of Temeșvar]] (the [[Banat]] region of western Romania), which extended as far as [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] (1551–1699) and [[Oradea]] (1661–1699).&lt;ref name="dulciu"/&gt; The few thousand Muslims settled there were, however, driven out by [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] conquest.

The presence of Muslims in the two Danubian Principalities was also attested, centering on Turkish traders&lt;ref&gt;Feodorov, p.301-302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cgiur"&gt;[[Constantin C. Giurescu]], ''Istoria Bucureștilor. Din cele mai vechi timpuri pînă în zilele noastre'', [[Editura pentru literatură]], Bucharest, 1966, p.273&lt;/ref&gt; and small communities of Muslim Roma.&lt;ref name="cgiur"/&gt; It is also attested that, during later [[Phanariote]] rules and the frequent [[History of the Russo-Turkish Wars|Russo-Turkish Wars]], Ottoman troops were stationed on Wallachia's territory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Neagu Djuvara]], ''Între Orient și Occident. Țările române la începutul epocii moderne'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 1995, p.283 (mention of an Ottoman garrison stationed near Bucharest in 1802, one which intervened in the city to restore order after widespread panic over a rumored attack by [[Osman Pazvantoğlu]]'s troops)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Crimean Khanate]]'s conquest by the [[Russian Empire]] (1783), many Tatars there took refuge in Dobruja, especially around Medgidia.&lt;ref name="grigoremuslimsinro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dulciu"/&gt; At the time, Crimean Tatars had become the largest community in the region.&lt;ref name="dulciu"/&gt; Nogais in the [[Budjak]] began to arrive upon the close of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)|Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812]], when the Budjak and [[Bessarabia]] were ceded to Russia&lt;ref name="dulciu"/&gt; (they settled in northern Tulcea County - [[Isaccea]] and [[Babadag]]). [[Khotyn]], once part of Moldavia, was the birthplace of [[Alemdar Mustafa Pasha]], who was the Ottoman [[List of Ottoman Grand Viziers|Grand Vizier]] until 1808. Two more Grand Viziers between 1821 and 1828 came from [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]] (a once Moldavian city), as [[Benderli Pasha (disambiguation)|Benderli Pasha]]s.

Over the same period, large groups of [[Circassians]] (as many as 200,000), refugees from the [[Caucasian War]], were resettled in the Dobruja and northern Bulgaria by the Ottomans (localities with large Circassian populace included Isaccea, [[Slava Cercheză]], [[Crucea, Constanța|Crucea]], [[Horia, Constanța|Horia]], and [[Nicolae Bălcescu, Constanța|Nicolae Bălcescu]]).&lt;ref name="grigoremuslimsinro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dulciu"/&gt; During the 1860s, a significant number of Nogais, also fleeing Russian conquest, left their homes in the [[Caucasus]] and joined in the exodus to Dobruja.&lt;ref&gt;[[James S. Olson]], ''An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires'', [[Greenwood Publishing Group]], Westport &amp; London, 1994, entry for "Nogai", p.514. {{ISBN|0-313-27497-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of other Muslim communities which joined in the colonization included [[Arabs]] (a group of 150 families of ''[[fellah]]in'' from [[Syria Province, Ottoman Empire|Syria Province]], brought over in 1831-1833), [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], and [[Persian peoples|Persians]]—all of these three communities were quickly integrated into the Tatar-Turkish mainstream.&lt;ref name="grigoremuslimsinro"/&gt;

===Kingdom of Romania===
[[Image:Dobethn1903.png|250px|thumb|Tatars (yellow) and Turks (dark purple) in Northern Dobruja (1903)]]
Tatars in Tulcea County were driven out by Russian troops during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878]] (''see [[Muhajir Balkan]]''). Following the conflict and the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Berlin Congress]], the Romanian government of [[Ion Brătianu]] agreed to extend [[civil rights]] to non-Christians.&lt;ref name="Irwin, p.402"&gt;Irwin, p.402&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 a monument in the shape of a small mosque was built in [[Bucharest]]'s [[Carol Park]], as sign of reconciliation after World War I. A small Muslim community resided on [[Ada Kaleh]] island in the [[Danube]], south of the Banat, an Ottoman enclave and later part of [[Austria-Hungary]], which was transferred to Romania in 1923.

At the end of the [[Second Balkan War]] in 1913, the [[Kingdom of Romania]] came to include [[Southern Dobruja]], whose population was over 50% Turkish (the region was ceded to Bulgaria in 1940).&lt;ref name="Irwin, p.402"/&gt; As recorded after [[World War I]], Romania had a population of 200,000 Muslims from a total of 7 million, the majority of which were Turks who lived in the two areas of Dobruja (as many as 178,000).&lt;ref name="Irwin, p.402"/&gt; Since 1877, the community was led by four separate muftiyats. Their number was reduced during the [[interwar period]], when the cities of Constanța and Tulcea each housed a muftiyat.&lt;ref name="sscislamic"/&gt; In 1943, the two institutions were again unified around the mufi in Constanța.&lt;ref name="sscislamic"/&gt; Outside Dobruja, the relatively small presence of [[Albanians of Romania|Albanian]] Muslims also left a cultural imprint: in 1921, the first translation of the ''[[Qur'an]]'' into the [[Albanian language]] was completed by [[Ilo Mitke Qafëzezi]] in the Wallachian city of [[Ploiești]].&lt;ref name="grigoremuslimsinro"/&gt;

Until after [[World War II]], the overall religiously conservative and apolitical Muslim population reportedly enjoyed a notable degree of religious tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, p.402, 404&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, after 1910, the community was subject to a steady decline, and many predominantly-Muslim villages were abandoned.&lt;ref name="grigoremuslimsinro"/&gt;

===Communism and post-Revolution period===
[[Image:Minaret roof in constanta.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The dome of the [[Constanța Mosque|Carol I Mosque]] in Constanța, topped by the [[Islamic crescent]]]]
The Dobrujan Muslim community was exposed to cultural repression during [[Communist Romania]]. After 1948, all property of the Islamic institutions became state-owned.&lt;ref name="Irwin, p.402"/&gt; The following year, the state-run and secular [[Education in Romania|compulsory education system]] set aside special classes for Tatar and Turkish children.&lt;ref name="Irwin, p.402"/&gt; According to Irwin, this was part of an attempt to create a separate Tatar literary language, intended as a means to assimilate the Tatar community.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, p.407&lt;/ref&gt; A reported decline in standards led to the separate education agenda being ceased in 1957.&lt;ref name="Irwin, p.402"/&gt; As a consequence, education in Tatar dialects and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] was eliminated in stages after 1959, becoming optional,&lt;ref name="grigoremuslimsinro"/&gt; while the ''[[madrasah]]'' in Medgidia was shut down in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="grigoremuslimsinro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sscislamic"/&gt; The population of Ada Kaleh relocated to Anatolia shortly before the 1968 construction of the [[Iron Gates]] dam by a joint [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]]-Romanian venture, which resulted in the island being flooded. At the same time, [[Sufism|Sufi]] tradition was frowned upon by Communist officials—as a result of their policies, the Sufi groups became almost completely inactive.&lt;ref&gt;Nathalie Clayer, Alexandre Popovic, [http://www.isim.nl/files/newsl_3.pdf "A New Era for Sufi Trends in the Balkans"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926192157/http://www.isim.nl/files/newsl_3.pdf |date=2007-09-26 }}, in International Institute for the Study of Islam in the Modern World (ISIM) Newsletter 3, July 1999, p.32. Retrieved June 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to historian Zachary T. Irwin, the degree to which the Muslim community was repressed and dispersed was lower in Romania than in other countries of [[Eastern Europe]], and the measures were less severe than, for instance, those taken against Romanian [[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Roman Catholics]] and [[Protestantism|Protestants]].&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, p.402-403&lt;/ref&gt; The state sponsored an edition of the ''Qur'an'', and top clerics such as Mufti [[Iacub Mehmet]] and Bucharest ''[[Imam]]'' [[Regep Sali]], represented the community in the [[Great National Assembly]] during [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]'s years in office.&lt;ref name="Irwin, p.403"&gt;Irwin, p.403&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, a delegation of Romanian Muslims visited [[Iran]] after the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution]] succeeded in that country.&lt;ref name="Irwin, p.403"/&gt; They also adhered to international bodies sponsored by [[Libya]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name="Irwin, p.403"/&gt; These gestures, according to Irwin, brought only a few objections from the regime.&lt;ref name="Irwin, p.403"/&gt;

Following the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Tatar and Turkish were again added to the curriculum for members of the respective communities, and, in 1993, the Medgidia ''madrasah'' was reopened as a Theological and Pedagogic High School named after [[President of Turkey|Turkish President]] [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]].&lt;ref name="grigoremuslimsinro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sscislamic"/&gt; The school was later elevated to National College status, and is known in Romanian as ''Colegiul Național Kemal Atatürk''. Since the 1990s, the official representatives of the Muslim community maintain close relations with international [[non-governmental organization]]s such as the [[Muslim World League]].&lt;ref name="sscislamic"/&gt;

'''Judy Zebra''' "'''J. Z.'''" '''Knight''' (born '''Judith Darlene Hampton'''; March 16, 1946) is an American [[New Age]] teacher and author known for her purported [[Mediumship|channelling]] of a spiritual entity named Ramtha.

Knight has appeared on US TV shows, such as ''[[Larry King]]'',&lt;ref name='larryking'&gt;{{cite news|first=Larry|last=King|authorlink=Larry King|title=Larry King LIVE - Change you Mind, Change your life (transcript) |date=August 2, 2008|publisher=CNN|url =http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0808/02/lkl.01.html|work =CNN|accessdate = 2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MSNBC]]&lt;ref name='msnbc'&gt;{{cite news|first=|authorlink=|title=What Lies Beyond The Bleep (transcript) |date=August 25, 2010|publisher=MSNBC|url =http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/08/25/4968741-what-lies-beyond-what-the-bleep|work =MSNBC|accessdate = 2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', as well as in media such as ''[[Psychology Today]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hohlbaum|first=Christine Louise|title=Digital Addiction Revisited|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-power-slow/201103/digital-addiction-revisited|work=The Power of Slow|accessdate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her teachings have attracted figures from the entertainment and political world such as [[Linda Evans]] and [[Shirley MacLaine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Rae|title=Yes, they're still at it!

Knight claims to bridge ancient wisdom and the power of consciousness together with the [[Modern physics|latest discoveries in science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Knight| first = JZ| authorlink = | title = Ramtha's School of Enlightenment - An Introduction| publisher = RSE| pages = 2–3| url = http://ramtha.com/html/pdf/introduction.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090206072711/http://ramtha.com/html/pdf/introduction.pdf| archivedate = 2009-02-06| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the ideas are similar to those of [[Shirley MacLaine]],&lt;ref name="shirley1"&gt;{{Cite book| last = MacLaine| first = Shirley| authorlink = Shirley MacLaine| title = Out on a Limb| publisher = [[Bantam Books]]| location = New York| year = 1983| page = 214}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have in turn been criticized for being "kindergarten metaphysics" by mathematician and [[skeptic]] [[Martin Gardner]].&lt;ref name="gardner"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gardner| first = Martin| authorlink = Martin Gardner| title = New Age: Notes of a Fringe-Watcher| publisher = [[Prometheus Books]]| location = Buffalo, N.Y.| year = 1988| page = 36| isbn = 0-87975-432-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramtha's teachings have been criticized by scientists and skeptics. The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] has criticized Knight for "homophobic, anti-Catholic, anti-Semitic racist rants".&lt;ref name="splcenter.org"&gt;[https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2014/ramtha-riled Southern Poverty Law Center - Ramtha Riled - May 23, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Knight grew up in poverty. After graduating from high school, she dropped out of business school.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} She later worked in the cable television industry, and due to her work moved to [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], where, according to her autobiography, a psychic told her the "Enlightened One" would appear to her in the future.&lt;ref name="mystory"/&gt; She says that Ramtha first appeared to her in her kitchen in 1977.&lt;ref name="mystory"/&gt;&lt;ref name=testifies&gt;{{Cite news

Knight appeared on ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'' in 1985 and wrote the autobiographical ''A State of Mind'' in 1987.

After an absence from public view of several years, she returned to public speaking on radio and in magazines and workshops.  She was a guest on Coast To Coast AM with George Noory on August 14, 2011.

==Ramtha==
"Ramtha" (the name is claimed to be derived from ''Ram'' and to mean "the God" in Ramtha's language) is the name of a reputed entity whom Knight says she [[Channelling (mediumistic)|channel]]s. According to Knight, Ramtha was a [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemurian]] warrior who fought the [[Atlantis|Atlanteans]] over 35,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="JZK Publishing 2005"&gt;JZK Publishing; Revised &amp; enlarged edition (February 14, 2005), Language: English, {{ISBN|1-57873-045-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57873-045-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knight claims that Ramtha speaks of leading an army over 2.5 million strong (more than twice the [[World population#Population figures|estimated world population]] at about 30,000 BC) for 63 years, and conquering three fourths of the known world (which was allegedly going through cataclysmic geological changes). According to Knight, Ramtha led the army for 10 years until he was betrayed and almost killed.&lt;ref name="whitebook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=J.Z.|title=Ramtha: The White Book|publisher=JZK Publishing|location=[[Yelm, Washington]]|page=28|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight maintains that Ramtha spent the next seven years in isolation recovering and observing nature, the seasons, his army making homes and families, and many other things. She says that he later mastered many skills, including foresight and [[out-of-body experience]]s, until he led his army to the [[Indus River]] while in his late fifties (after having led his army for 63 years). According to Knight, Ramtha taught his soldiers everything he knew for 120 days, he bid them farewell, rose into the air and in a bright flash of light he [[Entering heaven alive|ascended]] before them. Knight says that he made a promise to his army that he would come back to teach them everything he had learned. JZ Knight says that in 1977 Ramtha appeared before her and told her that he had come to help her over the ditch.  JZ Knight claims to have become his first student of what she calls the great work.&lt;ref name="JZK Publishing 2005"/&gt;

===Teachings===
{{see|Ramtha's School of Enlightenment#Teachings}}

Ramtha is the central figure (the "master teacher") of [[Ramtha's School of Enlightenment]], started by Knight in 1987 near the town Yelm, Washington. Classes (or "dialogues") had been held around the world for the previous 10 years. There are currently over 6,000 students of Knight's teachings.&lt;ref name="olympian3"/&gt;

A central theme of Knight's teachings involves the internalization of divinity ("God is in Us", "You are God, Behold God"). Knight describes Ramtha as having brought his knowledge to many ancient civilizations in the world such as the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians.  Her website also suggests that traces of the lineage of the original teachings and philosophies she claims Ramtha taught 35,000 years ago have appeared throughout history in the schools of [[philosophy|philosophers]] such as [[Socrates]], [[religion]]s such as [[Hinduism]] and [[Judaism]], and the works of great minds such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]].&lt;ref name="introduction"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Knight|first=J.Z.|title=Ramtha's School of Enlightenment - an Introduction (PDF)|url=http://ramtha.com/html/pdf/introduction.pdf|accessdate=November 20, 2009|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The four cornerstones of Knight's philosophy are:&lt;ref name="introduction"/&gt;
# The statement 'You are god'
# The directive to make known the unknown
# The concept that consciousness and energy create the nature of reality
# The challenge to conquer yourself

Knight's teachings appear to be a mixture of [[Jung|Jungian philosophy]], [[Occult|Western occult traditions]] and contemporary [[Affirmations (New Age)|positive-thinking attitudes]] (such as [[New Age]] beliefs)&lt;ref name="wynn"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Wynn | first1 = Charles M.| last2 = Wiggins | first2 = Arthur W.| last3 = Harris  | first3 = Sidney| title = Quantum leaps in the wrong direction: where real science ends-- and pseudoscience begins| publisher = [[Joseph Henry Press]]| location = Berlin| year = 2001| pages = 85–86| isbn = 0-309-07309-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have yet to stand against elementary [[skepticism]] or scrutiny.&lt;ref name="sagan"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Sagan| first = Carl| authorlink = Carl Sagan| title = The Demon-Haunted World: Science As a Candle in the Dark| publisher = [[Ballantine Books]]| date = March 1997| pages = 480| isbn = 0-394-53512-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predictions made by Knight in the name of the disembodied entity have either failed to come true (e.g. predicting that a holocaust would take place in 1985, or that the USA would be involved in a major war in 1985) or the predicted scenarios are too wide to evaluate and/or have too large an error margin to be considered, which is usually the case with channelers.&lt;ref name="wynn"/&gt;

When Knight says she is channeling Ramtha she speaks mostly in English in what sounds like an accent from the Indian Raj,&lt;ref name="sagan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shermer"/&gt; sometimes in a simplistic way. The claimed entity "Ramtha" has expressed confusion about modern items (or even the ability to read English),&lt;ref name="cunningham"/&gt; although he seems to have clear understanding of complex issues of [[modern physics]], such as the [[quantum field]] or [[neurology]], which appear frequently in his speeches.&lt;ref name="youtuberamtha"&gt;An example: {{cite video|people=JZ Knight/Ramtha|title=JZ Knight on UFOs|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1pQRyhCicQ|date=2008|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the alleged channeling of Ramtha, JZ Knight behaves a bit differently and speaks in a deeper and stern voice.

In her teachings "Ramtha" has made several controversial statements such as that Christianity is a "backward" [[religion]], that [[Jesus]]' parables can be explained by means of [[Photon#Wave.E2.80.93particle duality and uncertainty principles|photon waves]] and [[probability]],&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt; that "murder isn't really wrong or evil" (if one believes in reincarnation),&lt;ref name="chandler"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Chandler| first = Russell| title = Understanding the New Age| publisher = Zondervan Publishing House| year = 1993| location = Grand Rapids, MI| pages = 265| url = http://www.ccel.us/newage.toc.html| isbn = 0-310-38561-X| quote = J.Z. Knight, channel for Cro-Magnon entity Ramtha, says that murder isn't really wrong or evil. "If you believe in the continuation of life [reincarnation] it's a different story," she said on ABC's "20/20." }}&lt;/ref&gt; or (during the court case JZ Knight v Jeff Knight) Jeff Knight stated that Ramtha had declared that [[HIV]] is Nature's way of 'getting rid of' [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gorenfeld |first=John |title="Bleep" of faith |publisher=[[Salon.com|Salon]]|date=2004-09-16|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/feature/2004/09/16/bleep/index1.html?pn=1 |accessdate=2006-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] observed that "Ramtha" has made [[anti-semitic]] comments such as ""Fuck God's [[chosen people]]! I think they have earned enough cash to have paid their way out of the goddamned [[The Holocaust#Gas chambers|gas chambers]] by now".&lt;ref name="splcenter.org"/&gt;

==Controversy and criticism==
{{see|Ramtha's School of Enlightenment#Controversy and criticism|Mediumship#Criticism}}

Most books regarding Ramtha and RSE come from JZK Publishing, one of the several companies started by Knight. Other books somewhat sympathetic to Ramtha, such as ''Finding Enlightenment: Ramtha's School of Ancient Wisdom'' by Gordon Melton, have ties to RSE in other ways. The author of ''Finding Enlightenment'' testified for Knight in Knight vs. Knight (1992–1995) against her former husband, Jeffery Knight (see below).

Skeptics point to Ramtha's story as proof that he does not exist. Ramtha claims to come from the continent of [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]] and to have conquered [[Atlantis]]. The existence of the two locations is considered of legendary nature, and neither has been found. Furthermore, the claim that Ramtha led an army of 2.5 million contradicts [[World population#Population figures|estimates of the world population]] at 33,000 BC, and her claims of [[clairvoyance|clairvoyant]], [[telepathy|telepathic]], [[telekinesis|telekinetic]] and other [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]] abilities, for which there is no scientific support,  have been heavily criticized by skeptics and scientific communities.&lt;ref name="skeptic"&gt;For telepathy, see for example, Randi, James. ''Flim-Flam! Psychics, ESP, Unicorns, and Other Delusions''. Prometheus Books (June 1982) {{ISBN|0-87975-198-3}} or&lt;br&gt;Charpak, Georges and Henri Broch. Translated by Bart K. Holland. ''Debunked!: ESP, Telekinesis, and Other Pseudoscience''. The Johns Hopkins University Press (March 25, 2004), {{ISBN|0-8018-7867-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It would be foolish to accept [psychokinesis] (...) without solid scientific data": {{cite book |first=Carl|last=Sagan|year=1995|title=[[The Demon-Haunted World]]: Science as a candle in the dark |pages=208–212|isbn=0-7472-7745-1|publisher=Headline}}. &lt;br&gt; A similar position is made by Richard Feynmann: {{cite book|last=Feynman|first=Richard P.| title=The Meaning of It All|year=1999|publisher=Penguin|isbn=0-14-027635-1|pages=68–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randi, James. [http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/parapsychology.html ''An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramtha's claim that every person can learn to create their own reality&lt;ref&gt;Ramtha.com [http://www.ramtha.com/html/aboutus/aboutus.stm About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930054533/http://www.ramtha.com/html/aboutus/aboutus.stm |date=2009-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is itself a philosophical [[paradox]]. [[Julian Baggini]], in his book ''The pig that wants to be eaten'', argues that if everyone was capable of creating their own realities with their minds, it would be problematic as one person could then create a reality in which no one was allowed to create their own realities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baggini|first=Julian|title=The pig that wants to be eaten: and ninety-nine other thought experiments|publisher=Granta|year=2005|isbn=1-86207-748-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magician and [[skeptic]] [[James Randi]] said that Ramtha's believers have "no way of evaluating [her teachings]",&lt;ref name="randi"&gt;{{cite web|last=Randi|first=James|authorlink=James Randi|title=Ramtha Raves|date=29 April 2005|url=http://www.randi.org/jr/042905some.html#13|accessdate=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Carl Sagan]] in his book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' says that "the simplest hypothesis is that Ms. Knight makes 'Ramtha' speak all by herself, and that she has no contact with disembodied entities from the [[Pleistocene|Pleistocene Ice Age]]." He goes on to write a list of questions that Ramtha's answers to would help us determine whether he is actually a disembodied entity from the [[Upper Paleolithic|paleolithic times]] (such as "What were the indigenous languages, and social structure?", "What was their writing like?" or "How do he know that he lived 35,000 years ago?"), and ends by saying that "[i]nstead, all we are offered are banal homilies."&lt;ref name="sagan"/&gt;

Knight's former husband, Jeff Knight, in an interview in 1992 with Joe Szimhart, said that Ramtha's teachings are a "farce" and that they are "just a money making business for [JZ Knight]". He also said that students of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment are "involved in a very dangerous, very evil corrupt thing".&lt;ref name="jeffknight"&gt;{{cite video|people=Knight, Jeff &amp; Szimhart, Joe|title=The Jeff Knight interview, 1992|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5378628563904592346#|location=Google Videos|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attacks and criticism against Ramtha's teachings and Ramtha's School of Enlightenment have also been made by former students of the school. David McCarthy, a [[Yelm]] resident and former student of the school between 1989 and 1996, has accused the school of being a [[cult]]. He further claims that he was intimidated during his studies there, and he felt like mind control was being exerted by Knight and the school. He said "At one point I was running around scared I was going to get eaten by the lizard people."&lt;ref name="olympian2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Brenner|first=Keri|title=Disillusioned former students target Ramtha|url=http://www.theolympian.com/689/story/339950-p4.html|date=January 27, 2008|accessdate=November 19, 2009}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; McCarthy became disappointed, not only with his own experience of Ramtha's teachings but also as he had cut ties from his family to become a student as they lived in a different country.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"&gt;{{cite video|people=McCarthy, McCarthy, David|title=LARSE Gathering|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6221582947106872287&amp;hl=en#|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led McCarthy to form a group called "Life After Ramtha's School of Enlightenment", which questions the authenticity of Ramtha and encourages people to come out and express their experiences after their realization that the RSE is a cult. The school has also been characterized as a cult by skeptic [[Michael Shermer]] in his book ''[[Why People Believe Weird Things]]''.&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shermer|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Shermer|title=Why People Believe Weird Things|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|location=New York|year=2002|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glenn Cunningham, a former bodyguard of Knight's, in an interview with David McCarthy details the inner workings of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment and criticizes various activities (such as trademarking ideas and phrases that had been coined by other authors many years before - for example, the idea of "Blue Body", or mixing quantum physics with new age ideas, which can be found in [[Vera Stanley Alder]]'s ''From the Mundane to the Magnificent'', first published in 1979) of Knight's and aspects of Ramtha which he simply saw as Knight acting. Among the things he mentions is the fact that Ramtha mispronounces the same words that Knight mispronounces, and that Ramtha quotes the same books that Knight has read.&lt;ref name="cunningham"&gt;{{cite video|people=Cunningham, Glenn &amp; McCarthy, David|title=Glenn Cunningham Interview|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=9124849147412897371#|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glenn Cunningham admits in the video interview, that he was prone to lying to students when he saw fit or thought that it may help them.&lt;ref name="cunningham"/&gt;

Furthermore, Ramtha's teachings as they are portrayed in the movie ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'', not only in the general gist of the film (which was directed and funded by students of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment) but also in instances where Ramtha is interviewed on screen, have been [[What the Bleep Do We Know!?#Academic reaction|heavily criticized]] by the scientific community,&lt;ref name="Physics-Today"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kuttner |first=Fred |author2=Rosenblum, Bruce |title=Teaching physics mysteries versus pseudoscience |journal=[[Physics Today]] |volume=59 |issue=11 |page=14 |publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]] |date=November 2006 |url=http://scitation.aip.org/journals/doc/PHTOAD-ft/vol_59/iss_11/14_1.shtml |doi=10.1063/1.2435631}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boggle"&gt;[http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,1484925,00.html "The minds boggle".] ''[[Guardian Unlimited|The Guardian Unlimited]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/science/features/bleep/ What the Bleep are they On About?!] ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ACS"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilson |first=Elizabeth |authorlink=Elizabeth Wilson |title=What the Bleep Do We Know?! |publisher=[[American Chemical Society]] |date=2005-01-13 |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/reelscience/reviews/whatthe_bleep/ |accessdate=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and skeptics,&lt;ref name="csicop"&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/si/show/what_the_do_they_know Review] by Eric Scerri of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[James Randi]].&lt;ref name="Pigasus"&gt;[http://www.randi.org/jr/040105capitalizing.html#11 2004 Pigasus awards] ''[[James Randi Educational Foundation]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court cases===
Knight has been involved in several court disputes, some personal and others business-related. She brought a suit against a woman from [[Berlin]] named Julie Ravell for disturbing Knight's psychic state and leaving her "hanging in spiritual limbo" during the five years Ravell claimed she was also channeling Ramtha. The case was brought to the supreme court in Vienna and lasted over five years, at the end of which Austria's supreme court awarded copyright to Knight as the sole channeler of Ramtha, and Ravell was made to pay $800 in psychic damages to Knight.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Connolly|first=Kate|title=Medium wins channeling right|date=June 9, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another case involving copyright and trademark ownership was JZK, Inc vs. Glandon, in which Joseph Glandon was accused of distributing copyrighted teachings of Ramtha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=wa&amp;vol=223619&amp;invol=o01 Jzk, Inc. v. Joseph Glandon]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Knight vs. Knight (1992–1995), Jeff Knight alleges that he lost years of his life by postponing modern medical treatment for his HIV infection, due to advice from his wife that Ramtha could heal him. The court decided against him; he died before he could appeal the court's decision.&lt;ref name="szimhart"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Szimhart|first=Joe|title=Essay on Gordon Melton's Study on Ramtha|date=July 1998|url=http://www.kelebekler.com/cesnur/txt/ram2.htm|accessdate=November 20, 2009|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Knight, through JZK Inc., accused WhiteWind Weaver, a [[Thurston County, Washington]] citizen, of stealing her ideas and using her and Ramtha's teachings in her workshops. A trial began on March 10, 2008, in Thurston County Superior Court and at the end of it Knight was awarded about $10,000 after the court's decision against WhiteWind Weaver.&lt;ref name="oregon"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rollins|first=Michael|title=Ramtha 1, Whitewind Weaver 0|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/09/ramtha_1_whitewind_weaver_0.html|date=September 16, 2008|accessdate=November 20, 2009|work=The Oregonian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight also refused to attend court as a witness in a case involving a 15-year-old who claimed rape against two students of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment. The 15-year-old girl had written a letter to Knight which mentioned that Wayne Allen Geis, her dancing and acting teacher, had engaged in sexual intercourse with her from 1995 to 1997. The illicit activities had also involved Ruth Beverly Martin. They had apparently told the girl that sexual intercourse would help her to relax and improve her acting ability. Knight invited the girl to a retreat at the school in November 1999. In the retreat, Ramtha questioned the girl, her father, Geis and Martin. This inquiry took place on stage in front of an audience of over 800 people for about an hour. Geis and Martin confessed to having molested the girl, and the school contacted authorities. Charged with 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct with a minor, Geis and Martin pleaded not guilty and the case went to trial.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Kimberly A.C., ( October 4, 2010) [http://www.seattlepi.com/local/ram04.shtml "'Ramtha' may take stand in rape case"]. Seattle Post-Intelligencer. Retrieved October 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors were reluctant to have Knight appear in court due to the "circus atmosphere" that would have been created. Knight herself claimed that she had been in a trance and did not remember anything of what was said in the retreat inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, (October 10, 2010) [http://www.seattlepi.com/local/ram10.shtml "'Ramtha's channeler' can't testify"].

{{Chola history}}

The lists of legendary '''Early Chola kings''' are recorded in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] literature and in the inscriptions left by the later [[Chola]] kings.

== Chola Empire ==

The genealogy of the Chola empire as found in the Tamil literature and in the many inscriptions left by the later Chola kings contains a number of kings recorded for whom there is no verifiable historic evidence. There are as many versions of this lineage as there are sources for them. The main source is the Sangam literature – particularly, religious literature such as ''Periapuranam'', semi-biographical poems of the later Chola period such as the temple and cave inscription and left by medieval Cholas.

Irrespective of the source, no list of the kings has a high level of historic fact and, while they generally are similar to each other, no two lists are exactly the same. Modern historians{{Who|date=January 2016}} consider these lists not as historically reliable sources but as comprehensive conglomerations of various Hindu deities and Puranic characters attributed to local chieftains and invented ancestry of dynasty attempting to re-establish their legitimacy and supremacy in a land they were trying to conquer.

== Prehistorical Cholas ==
A number of typical hero and demi-gods found their place in the ancestry claimed by the later Cholas in the long typical genealogies incorporated into the copper-plate charters and stone inscription of the tenth and eleventh centuries. The earliest version of this is found in the '''kilbil Plates''' which gives fifteen names before Chola including the genuinely historical ones of [[Karikala]], [[Perunarkilli]] and [[Kocengannan]]. The '''Thiruvalangadu''' Plate swells this list to forty-four, and the '''Kanya Plate''' runs up to fifty-two. 

The Cholas were looked upon as descended from the sun. These myths speak of a Chola king, supposed contemporary of the sage Agastya, whose devotion brought the river Kavery into existence. There is also the story of the king [[Manu Needhi Cholan]] who sentenced his son to death for having accidentally killed a calf.He was called thus because he followed the rules of Manu; his real name is not mentioned and is thought to be Ellalan according to Maha vamsam who was also attributed with a similar story. King [[Shivi (king)|Shivi]] who rescued a dove from a hunter by giving his own flesh to the hungry and poor hunter was also part of the early Chola legends. King Shivi was also called Sembiyan, a popular title assumed by a number of Chola kings.

== Cholas of the Sangam period ==
 The early Chola kings of the [[Sangam period]] and the life of [[ancient Tamil country|people]] contributed much to the cultural wealth of the Tamil country. The Sangam literature is full of legends about the mythical Chola kings.

The dates of accession are approximate interpolation of the [[Chronological standpoints in Tamil history]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

'''Ian Fraser Kilmister''' (24 December 1945 – 28 December 2015), better known as '''Lemmy''', was an English musician and singer-songwriter who founded and fronted the rock band [[Motörhead]]. His music was one of the foundations of the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] genre.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Blake|first=Mark|date=March 2016|title=Lemmy: 1945-2015|url=http://www.qthemusic.com/13703/david-bowie-q356/|magazine=Q Magazine|publisher=Bauer|issue=356|pages=8–10|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was known for his appearance (including his [[sideburns|friendly mutton chops]]&lt;!--FRIENDLY IS CORRECT : ) – please see Talk page archive--&gt;), his distinctive gravelly, "rasp[y]" singing voice, which "was one of the most recognisable voices in rock", and his way of singing, looking up towards "...a towering microphone tilted down into his weather-beaten face".&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/12072476/Lemmy-Motorhead-frontman-obituary.html|title=Lemmy, Motörhead frontman – obituary|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=29 December 2015|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known for his unmistakable bass playing style, in which he used his [[Rickenbacker]] bass to create an "overpowered, [[fuzz bass|distorted]] rhythmic rumble".&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/12072476/Lemmy-Motorhead-frontman-obituary.html|title=Lemmy, Motörhead frontman – obituary|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=29 December 2015|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another unique aspect of Lemmy's bass sound is that he often played [[power chord]]s using growling [[distortion (music)|overdriven]] [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall tube bass stacks]]. Alongside his music career, he also had many minor roles and cameo appearances in film and television.

Lemmy was born in [[Burslem]], [[Stoke-on-Trent]] and grew up in [[Staffordshire]] and later [[North Wales]]. He was influenced by [[rock and roll]] and the early works of the [[the Beatles|Beatles]], which led to him playing in several rock groups in the 1960s; including [[the Rockin' Vickers]]. He worked as a [[Road crew|roadie]] for [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[the Nice]], before joining the [[space rock]] band [[Hawkwind]] in 1971, singing lead vocals on their hit "[[Silver Machine]]". After being fired from Hawkwind for [[drug possession]] in 1975, he founded Motörhead during the same year as the lead singer, bassist, songwriter and frontman. Motörhead's success peaked in 1980 and 1981 and included the hit single "[[Ace of Spades (song)|Ace of Spades]]" and the top charting live album ''[[No Sleep 'til Hammersmith]]''. Lemmy continued to record and tour regularly with Motörhead until his death in December 2015 in Los Angeles, where he had lived since 1990. Aside from his musical activities, Lemmy was well known for his hard-living lifestyle, [[chain smoking]], and regular consumption of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] (notably [[Jack Daniel's]] [[Tennessee whiskey]]) and [[amphetamine]]s.

==Early life==
Lemmy was born on Christmas Eve in the [[Burslem]] area of [[Stoke-on-Trent]], Staffordshire.{{sfn|Kilmister|Garza|2012|p=5}}&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/stoke/content/articles/2009/09/08/lemmy_book_feature.shtml Lemmy: White Line Fever] ''[[BBC News]] Stoke and Staffordshire article''. Retrieved on 22 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was three months old, his father,&lt;ref&gt;Overkill: The Story of Motorhead, Joel McIver, Omnibus Press, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; an ex-[[Royal Air Force]] chaplain and concert pianist, separated from his mother. His mother and grandmother moved to nearby [[Newcastle-under-Lyme]], then to [[Madeley, Staffordshire|Madeley]].&lt;ref name="HWSAGA"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clerk|first=Carol|title=The Saga of Hawkwind|publisher=Omnibus Press, c2004|isbn=1-84449-101-3|page=546|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Lemmy was ten years old, his mother married former footballer [[George Willis (footballer)|George Willis]], who already had two older children from a previous marriage, Patricia and Tony, with whom Lemmy did not get along.

The family moved to a farm in the Welsh town of [[Benllech|Benllech, Anglesey]], with Lemmy later commenting that "funnily enough, being the only English kid among 700 Welsh ones didn't make for the happiest time, but it was interesting from an anthropological point of view".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bevan|first=Nathan|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/classic-interview-lemmy---never-8938554|title=Classic interview: Lemmy – 'Never go camping with a one armed man'|publisher=Wales Online|date=|accessdate=13 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015311/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/classic-interview-lemmy---never-8938554|archivedate=17 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Ysgol Syr Thomas Jones|Sir Thomas Jones' School]] in [[Amlwch]], where he was nicknamed "Lemmy". It was later suggested by some that the name originated from the phrase "lemmy [lend me] a [[pound sterling|quid]] 'til Friday" because of his alleged habit of borrowing money from people to play [[slot machine]]s,&lt;ref name="HWSAGA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24806076|title=Obituary: Lemmy, Motorhead frontman – BBC News|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|date=29 December 2015|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MVB"&gt;''Motorhead Videobiography'' (Double DVD with 48-page book) Edgehill Publishing Ltd., June 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-905954-38-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levin|first=Hannah|title=An Incomplete History of Motorhead Frontman Lemmy Kilmister|work=[[Seattle Weekly]]|date=2 February 2011|accessdate=26 April 2011|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2011-02-02/music/an-incomplete-history-of-mot-rhead-frontman-lemmy-kilmister/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210205752/http://www.seattleweekly.com/2011-02-02/music/an-incomplete-history-of-mot-rhead-frontman-lemmy-kilmister/#|archive-date=10 February 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Lemmy himself said that he did not know the origin of the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=What to Stream Now|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/12/loud-proud-meaning-of-motorheads-lemmy-kilmister.html|title=The Loud, Proud Meaning of Lemmy Kilmister|publisher=Vulture|date=|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He soon started to show an interest in [[rock and roll]] music, girls, and horses.

At school, Lemmy noticed a pupil who had brought a guitar to school and had been "surrounded by chicks". His mother had a guitar, which he then took to school, even though he could not play, and was himself surrounded by girls. By the time he left school, his family had moved to [[Conwy]]. Whilst there, he worked at menial jobs; including one at the local [[Hotpoint]] electric appliance factory, while also playing guitar for local bands such as the Sundowners and spending time at a horse-riding school.&lt;ref name="HWSAGA" /&gt; Lemmy saw [[the Beatles]] perform at [[the Cavern Club]] when he was sixteen, and then learned to play along on guitar to their first album ''[[Please Please Me]]''. He also admired the sarcastic attitude of the group, particularly that of [[John Lennon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Beatles 10 Years That Shook The World|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]/[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]|year=2004|isbn=0-7566-0670-5|page=59|author=[[Paul Trynka]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording and performing career==
[[File:Lemmy K.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Lemmy playing bass and singing, with his trademark high microphone position]]

===1960–1970: Early years===
In [[Stockport]], Lemmy joined local bands the Rainmakers and then the Motown Sect who played [[Working men's club|northern clubs]] for three years. In 1965, he joined [[the Rockin' Vickers]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inkedmag.com/articles/detail/123/damage-case-lemmy-kilmister/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430110931/http://www.inkedmag.com/articles/detail/123/damage-case-lemmy-kilmister/ |date=30 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who signed a deal with [[CBS]], released three singles and toured Europe, reportedly being the first British band to visit the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. The Rockin' Vickers moved to [[Manchester]], where they shared a flat together. There, Lemmy got involved with a woman named Tracy who bore a son, Paul Inder. Lemmy did not have any involvement in his life until the boy was six.&lt;ref name="HWSAGA" /&gt;

Leaving the Rockin' Vickers, Lemmy moved to London in 1967. He shared a flat with [[Noel Redding]], bassist of [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]], and with [[Neville Chesters]], their road manager. He got a job as a roadie for the band.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1968, he joined the psychedelic rock band [[Sam Gopal]] under the name Ian Willis and recorded the album ''[[Escalator (album)|Escalator]]'' which was released in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Sam-Gopal-Escalator/release/843215|title=Sam Gopal – Escalator|website=Discogs|access-date=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After meeting [[Simon King (musician)|Simon King]] at a shopping centre in Chelsea in 1969, he joined the band [[Opal Butterfly]]; but the group soon disbanded, having failed to raise enough interest with their singles.&lt;ref name="HWSAGA" /&gt;

===1971–1975: Hawkwind===

In August 1971, Lemmy joined the [[space rock]] band [[Hawkwind]], who were based in [[Ladbroke Grove]], London, as a bassist and vocalist. He had no previous experience as a bass guitarist, and was cajoled into joining immediately before a benefit gig in [[Notting Hill]] by bandmate Michael "Dik Mik" Davies, to have two members who enjoyed amphetamines.{{sfn|Kilmister|Garza|2012|p=71}} He quickly developed a distinctive style that was strongly shaped by his early experience as a rhythm guitarist, often using [[double stop]]s and chords rather than the single note lines preferred by most bassists. His bass work was a fundamental part of the Hawkwind sound during his tenure, perhaps best documented on ''[[Space Ritual]]''. He also provided the lead vocals on several songs, including the band's biggest UK chart single, "[[Silver Machine]]", which reached #3 in 1972.

In 1975, Lemmy was arrested at the Canada/United States border in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], Ontario, on drug possession charges; he spent five days in jail but was released without charge. Nonetheless, he was fired from Hawkwind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songwritingmagazine.co.uk/news/lemmy-dies-aged-70/29094|title=Lemmy dies, aged 70|date=29 December 2015|work=Songwriting Magazine|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He once said of Hawkwind: ""I did like being in Hawkwind, and I believe I’d still be playing with them today if I hadn’t been kicked out. It was fun onstage, not so much offstage. They didn’t want to mesh with me. Musically, I loved the drummer, the guitar player. It was a great band.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bravewords.com/news/motorheads-lemmy-kilmister-talks-little-richard-hawkwind-being-best-worst-band-in-the-world|title=MOTÖRHEAD'S LEMMY KILMISTER TALKS LITTLE RICHARD, HAWKWIND, BEING "BEST WORST BAND IN THE WORLD"|last=|first=|date=|website=Bravewords|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11/05/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1975–2015: Motörhead===
{{Main|Motörhead}}
After Hawkwind, Lemmy formed a new band called "Bastard" with guitarist [[Larry Wallis]] (former member of the [[Pink Fairies]], [[Steve Peregrin Took|Steve Took]]'s [[Shagrat (band)|Shagrat]] and [[UFO (band)|UFO]]) and drummer [[Lucas Fox]]. Lemmy and Took were friends, and Took was the stepfather to Lemmy's son Paul. When his manager informed him that a band by the name of "Bastard" would never get a slot on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', Lemmy changed the band's name to "[[Motörhead]]" – the title of the last song he had written for Hawkwind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imotorhead.com/motorhead-bio.html|title=Motorhead Bio|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226060750/http://www.imotorhead.com/motorhead-bio.html|archivedate=26 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Soon after, both Wallis and Fox were replaced with guitarist [[Eddie Clarke (musician)|"Fast" Eddie Clarke]] and drummer [[Phil Taylor (musician)|Phil "Philthy Animal" Taylor]] and with this line-up, the band began to achieve success. Lemmy's guttural vocals were unique in rock at that time, and were copied during the time when [[punk rock]] became popular. The band's sound appealed to Lemmy's original fans and, eventually, to fans of punk. Lemmy asserted that he generally felt more kinship with punks than with metalheads; he even played with [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]] for a handful of gigs when they had no regular bassist.&lt;ref&gt;see the notes for ''Smash It Up – The Anthology 1976 – 1987''&lt;/ref&gt; The band's success peaked in 1980 and 1981 with several UK chart hits, including the single "[[Ace of Spades (song)|Ace of Spades]]", which remained a crowd favourite throughout the band's career, and the UK #1 live album ''[[No Sleep 'til Hammersmith]]''. Motörhead became one of the most influential bands in the heavy metal genre. Their – and Lemmy's – final live performance was in [[Berlin]], Germany on 11 December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/mikkey-dee-motorhead-is-over/|title=MIKKEY DEE: 'MOTÖRHEAD Is Over'|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=29 December 2015|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

At the age of 17, Lemmy met a holidaying girl named Cathy. He followed her to [[Stockport]], Greater Manchester, where she gave birth to his son Sean, who was put up for adoption.&lt;ref name="HWSAGA" /&gt; In the 2010 documentary film ''[[Lemmy (film)|Lemmy]]'', he mentioned having a son whose mother has only recently "found him" and "hadn't got the heart to tell him who his father was", indicating that the boy – perhaps Sean – was given up for adoption.

In the [[Channel 4]] documentary ''Motörhead: Live Fast, Die Old'', broadcast on 22 August 2005, it was claimed that Lemmy had "bedded" in excess of 2,000 women. Lemmy stated: "I said more than a thousand, the magazine made two thousand of it."  ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' had Lemmy at #8 on its top ten "Living Sex Legends" list, as they claimed that he had slept with around 1,200 women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Zap2It.com|url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-charliesheenmaximlivingsexlegends,0,5057260.story|title=Sheen Only No. 2 on 'Living Sex Legends' List – The 'Two and a Half Men' star allegedly has 5,000 notches on his rapidly dwindling bedpost|publisher=Zap2it|date=30 May 2006|accessdate=15 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917061028/http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-charliesheenmaximlivingsexlegends%2C0%2C5057260.story|archivedate=17 September 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lemmy is one of the characters in the book ''[[Sex Tips from Rock Stars]]'' by Paul Miles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Miles|url=http://sextipsfromrockstars.com|title=Sex Tips From Rock Stars by Paul Miles|publisher=www.SexTipsFromRockStars.com|date=|accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dave Grohl]], on his [[Probot]] website, describes musicians with whom he has worked. In his entry for Lemmy, he wrote:

{{quote|We recorded his track in Los Angeles in maybe two takes about a year and a half ago. Until then I'd never met what I'd call a real rock 'n' roll hero before. Fuck Elvis and Keith Richards, Lemmy's the king of rock 'n' roll – he told me he never considered Motörhead a metal band, he was quite adamant. Lemmy's a living, breathing, drinking and snorting fucking legend. No one else comes close.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southernlord.com/probot/singer.html|title=Singers|accessdate=12 January 2009|work=[[Probot]] website|publisher=|date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120194952/http://www.southernlord.com/probot/singer.html|archivedate=20 November 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lemmy was well known for his alcohol abuse. The documentary ''Live Fast Die Old'' stated that he drank a bottle of [[Jack Daniel's]] every day and had done so since he was 30 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motorheadster.blogspot.com/2009/09/i-drink-bottle-of-jack-day.html|title=I Drink a Bottle of Jack a Day|accessdate=7 November 2010|publisher=motorheadster.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Lemmy stopped drinking Jack Daniel's for health reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/motorheads-lemmy-if-i-died-tomorrow-i-couldnt-complain/|title=MOTÖRHEAD's LEMMY: 'If I Died Tomorrow, I Couldn't Complain'|publisher=www.blabbermouth.net|date=|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time with Hawkwind he developed an appetite for [[amphetamine]]s and [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], particularly the former. Before joining Hawkwind, he recalled Dik Mik, a former Hawkwind sound technician, visiting his squat in the middle of the night and taking speed with him. They became interested in how long "you could make the human body jump about without stopping", which they did for a few months, until Mik ran out of money and wanted to return to Hawkwind, taking Lemmy with him.&lt;ref name="MVB" /&gt;

{{quote|I first got into speed because it was a utilitarian drug and kept you awake when you needed to be awake, when otherwise you'd just be flat out on your back.

In November 2005, he was invited to the [[National Assembly for Wales]] as a guest speaker by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] member [[William Graham (Welsh politician)|William Graham]]. He was asked to express his views on the detrimental effects of drugs, and called for the legalisation of heroin. He stated that legalisation would eradicate the drug dealer from society and generate money from its taxation, however hard this would be to accept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=43748|title=MOTÖRHEAD's LEMMY Tells Welsh Assembly: Legalize Heroin|accessdate=9 February 2007|work=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001004053/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=43748|archivedate=1 October 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lemmy collected German military regalia; he had an [[Iron Cross]] encrusted on his bass, which led to accusations of [[Nazism|Nazi]] sympathies. He stated that he collected the memorabilia because he liked the way it looked, and considered himself an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] or [[libertarianism|libertarian]].&lt;ref name="damagecase"&gt;{{cite web|last=Eddy|first=Chuck|title=Damage Case: Lemmy and Motörhead|work=Motörhead Forever|year=1997|url=http://www.motorhead.ru/art11damagecase.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120526042049/http://www.motorhead.ru/art11damagecase.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 May 2012|accessdate=9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timesonline"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dalton|first=Stephen|title=The Oldest Rocker in Town|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article1893238.ece|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530121659/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article1893238.ece|archivedate=30 May 2010|accessdate=13 August 2008|work=The Times|location=London|date=9 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lemmy said he was against religion, government, and established authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Samudrala|first=Ram|title=Born to Raise Hell|date=29 October 1996|url=http://www.ram.org/music/articles/lemmyinterview.html|accessdate=9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardianobit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/29/lemmy-kilmister-obituary|title=Ian 'Lemmy' Kilmister obituary|date=29 December 2015|work=The Guardian|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he identified as agnostic, saying, "I can find out when I die.

Lemmy's manager, Todd Singerman, later revealed:

Reviewing his career after his death, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' said:

{{quote|Over the years as guitarists and drummers passed through Motörhead's lineup, Lemmy remained the grizzled heart of the machine.

{{quote|Death is an inevitability, isn't it? You become more aware of that when you get to my age. I don't worry about it. I'm ready for it. When I go, I want to go doing what I do best.

The song, from their album ''[[Hardwired... to Self-Destruct]]'', depicts Lemmy's rise to fame. On 18 January 2017, Lemmy was inducted into the [[Hall of Heavy Metal History]] for being the creator of [[thrash metal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/scorpions-metal-blade-records-nominated-to-hall-of-heavy-metal-history-w457434|title=Scorpions Among Nominees for Hall of Heavy Metal History|website=rollingstone.com|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the extinct crocodile relative ''[[Lemmysuchus]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Michela M.|last2=Young|first2=Mark T.|last3=Steel|first3=Lorna|last4=Foffa|first4=Davide|last5=Smith|first5=Adam S.|last6=Hua|first6=StÉphane|last7=Havlik|first7=Philipe|last8=Howlett|first8=Eliza A.|last9=Dyke|first9=Gareth|title=Re-description of ‘Steneosaurus’ obtusidens Andrews, 1909, an unusual macrophagous teleosaurid crocodylomorph from the Middle Jurassic of England|journal=[[Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society]]|date=2017|doi=10.1093/zoolinnean/zlx035}}&lt;/ref&gt; was named after Lemmy.&lt;ref&gt;"Scaly snuggle-toothed beast?

In 2018, [[Hawkwind]] recorded a new acoustic version of Lemmy's "The Watcher" (originally recorded on ''Doremi Fasol Latido'', 1972) on the album ''[[The Road to Utopia]]'' with production, arrangement and additional orchestrations by [[Mike Batt]] and a guest appearance from [[Eric Clapton]].&lt;ref name="RoadToUtopiaCD"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cherryred.co.uk/product/hawkwind-road-to-utopia/ | title=Hawkwind: Road To Utopia | publisher=[[Cherry Red Records]] | accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collaborations and songwriting==
Lemmy worked with several musicians, apart from his Motörhead bandmates, over the course of his career. He wrote the song "R.A.M.O.N.E.S" for the [[Ramones]], which he played in his live sets as a tribute to the band. He was brought in as a songwriter for [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s 1991 ''[[No More Tears]]'' album, providing lyrics for the tracks "[[Hellraiser (song)|Hellraiser]]," (which Motörhead later recorded themselves and released as a single), "Desire," "I Don't Want to Change the World" and the single "[[Mama, I'm Coming Home|Mama I'm Coming Home]]". Lemmy noted in several magazine and television interviews that he made more money from the royalties of that one song than he had in his entire time with Motörhead. After being diagnosed with [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 diabetes]] in 2000, for which he was hospitalised briefly, Lemmy again appeared with Motörhead at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]]. Lemmy published his autobiography, ''White Line Fever'', in November 2002. In 2005 Motörhead won their first Grammy in the [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Best Metal Performance]] category with their cover of [[Metallica]]'s "[[Whiplash (Metallica song)|Whiplash]]". In the same year he began recording an unreleased solo album titled ''Lemmy &amp; Friends'', which was intended to include a collaboration with [[Janet Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/lemmy-s-solo-album-to-feature-collaboration-with-metallica/|title=LEMMY's Solo Album to Feature Collaboration With Metallica|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=10 February 2005|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appendage is thrown from the window of a moving car and lands at Lemmy's feet who exclaims: "Looks like a dick! Fucking hell! Ah well, it's not mine at least." The film's soundtrack also features the Motörhead song "Under the Knife".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/29/lemmy-motorhead-getting-drunk-getting-laid-la-rock-fans-raise-glass|title=Getting drunk and getting laid: LA rock fans raise a glass to Lemmy|date=29 December 2015|author=Dave Schilling|work=The Granuiad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
[[File:Lemmy-03.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Lemmy in his usual singing stance, May 2005]]
Lemmy positioned his microphone in an uncommonly high position, angled so that he appeared to be looking up at the sky rather than at the audience. He said that it was for "personal comfort, that's all. It's also one way of avoiding seeing the audience.

{{LDSpolygamy}}
According to a consensus of historians, many [[Latter Day Saint|adherents]] in the early [[Latter Day Saint movement]] practiced [[plural marriage]], a doctrine that states that [[polygyny]] is ordained of God. Although the largest denomination in the movement, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], officially abandoned the [[Origin of Latter Day Saint polygamy|practice]] of plural marriage in 1890, a number of churches in the [[Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalist]] movement continue to teach and practice it. Historically, the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (now the [[Community of Christ]]), the second largest denomination in the movement, had an anti-polygamy position and denied officially that Smith had taught or practiced it, since Smith denied his involvement during his church leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Whitmer|1887}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v5n06.htm ''Times and Seasons'', Volume 5, page 474]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v5n03.htm ''Times and Seasons'', Volume 5, page 423]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Latter-Day Saints' Millennial Star'' 4 [January 1844]: 144&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-succession crisis==
The following notable Latter Day Saints are alleged to have practiced plural marriage prior to the 1844 [[succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|succession crisis]] that followed the [[death of Joseph Smith, Jr.]].

Zebedee's second wife, Mary Mott (1820-1886), gave birth to ten more children. She and Zebedee were married 'for time' in 1843, and later, on 20 January 1846, '[[Celestial marriage|sealed for eternity]],' in the [[Nauvoo Temple]] by [[Brigham Young]] — after which, [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] [[Parley P.

Coltrin married Hannah Husted (1797-1862) and Sarah Oyler (1800-1886) at Nauvoo in 1846, and also Lavinia Elizabeth Fullmer (1838-1907) in 1857 and one Marriet Chaddock in 1874 at Salt Lake City. Finally, noting that none of these additional wives [[Patriarchal priesthood|bore him children]], it is known that Coltrin found a seventh wife in one Amanda Norwood.

Since many of his early disciples had looked to him as a monogamous counterweight to Brigham Young's polygamous version of Mormonism, Strang's decision to embrace plural marriage proved costly to him and his church.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6221">[[File:A symbol of Manchu.svg|thumb|150px|Manchu ethnoreligious symbol.]]
'''Manchu folk religion''' is the [[ethnic religion]] practiced by most of the [[Manchu people]], the major of the [[Tungusic peoples]], in [[China]]. It can also be called '''Manchu Shamanism''' by virtue of the word "shaman" being originally from [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] ''šamán'' ("man of knowledge"),{{sfnb|Elliott|2001|p=235}} later applied by Western scholars to similar religious practices in other cultures. It is a [[pantheism|pantheistic]] system, believing in a universal [[God]] called ''Apka Enduri'' ("[[Tian|God of Heaven]]") which is the omnipotent and omnipresent source of all life and creation.{{sfnb|Shirokogorov|1929|p=204}} Deities (''enduri'') enliven every aspect of nature, and the worship of these gods is believed to bring favour, health and prosperity.{{sfnb|Elliott|2001|p=236}} Many of the deities are original Manchu kins' [[ancestor]]s, and people with the same surname are generated by the same god.{{sfnb|Ma|Meng|2011|p=381}}

Shamans are persons of unusual ability, strength and sensitivity, capable of perception and prediction of the ways of the gods. They are endowed with the social function to conduct the sacrificial ceremonies and approach the deities asking them intervention or protection. Because of their abilities the shamans are people of great authority and prestige. Usually, every Manchu kin has its own shaman.{{sfnb|Elliott|2001|p=236}}

Manchu folk religious rites were standardised by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] (1736-96) in the "Manchu Sacrificial Ritual to the Gods and Heaven" (''Manjusai wecere metere kooli bithe''), a manual published in [[Manchu language|Manchu]] in 1747 and in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (''Manzhou jishen jitian dianli'') in 1780.{{sfnb|Ma|Meng|2011|p=381}}{{sfnb|Elliott|2001|p=238}} With the conquest of imperial power in China ([[Qing dynasty]]) the Manchu people gradually adopted [[Chinese language]] and assimilated into the [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese religion]], although Manchu folk religion persists with a distinct character within broader Chinese religion.

==History==
{{Main|Shamanism in the Qing dynasty}}

==Rituals==
Study of Manchu religion usually distinguishes two types of ritual, "domestic" and "primitive", which can be performed in two cultic settings, "imperial" and "common". The domestic ritual primarily involves the sacrifices for the progenitors of lineages and is the most important, while the primitive ritual involves the sacrifices for zoomorphic gods.{{sfnb|Elliott|2001|pp=236-237}} The ritual manual of Qianlong was an attempt to adapt all kins' ritual traditions to the style of the imperial kin's ritual tradition. This was only partially effective as common cults were preserved and revitalised over time.{{sfnb|Elliott|2001|pp=238-239}}

The ancestral ritual is the same in the common and imperial cults.{{sfnb|Elliott|2001|p=239}} It is composed of three main moments: the dawn sacrifice (Chinese: ''chaoji''), the sunset sacrifice (''xiji'') and the "light-extinguishing" sacrifice (''beidingji'') held at midnight. Both common and imperial rituals make use of the gods' pole (Chinese: 神杆 ''shéngān'' or 神柱 ''shénzhù'', Manchu: ''šomo'') as a means of establishing connection with Heaven.{{sfnb|Elliott|2001|p=239}}

While the domestic ritual is bright and harmonious, the primitive or "wild" ritual is associated with darkness and mystery.{{sfnb|Elliott|2001|p=240}} Deities involved are not those of the sky, the earth or the ancestors, but are zoomorphic chthonic deities. With its reliance on techniques of ecstasy, the primitive ritual had long been discouraged by the court (Hong Taiji proscribed it as early as 1636).{{sfnb|Elliott|2001|p=240}}

==Temples and gods==
Manchu religious cults originally took place in shrines called ''tangse'' (Chinese: 堂子 ''tángzi'', "hall"; or 谒庙 ''yèmiào'', "visitation temple"){{sfnb|Elliott|2001|pp=465–66, note 13}}) but at least by 1673 all communal ''tangse'' were prohibited with the exception of the imperial cult building. Households continued their rituals at private altars called ''weceku''.{{sfnb|Elliott|2001|p=239}}

Common cults gradually adopted deities from [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese religion]] in addition to Tungusic gods. ''[[Guan Yu|Guwan mafa]]'' (关帝 ''Guāndì'', ''Divus'' Guan), whose martial character appealed to the Manchus, became one of the most beloved deities. Another popular cult was that of the Goddess (娘娘 ''Niángniáng'').{{sfnb|Elliott|2001|p=239}}

'''John Michael Derrick''' (3 January 1915 &amp;ndash; 5 August 1961) was the son of the artist, illustrator and cartoonist [[Thomas Derrick (artist)|Thomas Derrick]], and older brother of the writer [[Christopher Derrick]]. He was a leading figure in [[Roman Catholic]] [[journalism]] in mid-20th-century England.

== Life ==
Derrick was brought up in rural [[Berkshire]] by [[distributism|back-to-the-land]] parents and attended [[Douai School]], where the headmaster, Dom [[Ignatius Rice]], was a friend of his father. On a holiday in [[Hungary]], not long after beginning his studies at the [[University of Oxford]], Derrick was incapacitated by a severe intestinal infection and spent several years as an invalid. During this period he wrote ''The Portugal of Salazar'' (1938), a sympathetic study of the [[Corporatist]] regime of [[António de Oliveira Salazar]].

In 1938, at the suggestion of Fr Ignatius, he was taken on as assistant editor of ''[[The Tablet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary in ''The Tablet'', August 12, 1961, pp. 773-774.&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in this position until his early death, throughout the period of the weekly newspaper's greatest prestige.&lt;ref&gt;"Woodruff, Douglas", [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31856 ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''].&lt;/ref&gt; He frequently wrote the editorial "Notebook" column. In 1956 he became editor of the ''[[Dublin Review (Catholic periodical)|Dublin Review]]'', which was actually published in London and under his editorship was renamed ''The Wiseman Review'' to avoid confusion. For a few months before his death he was London correspondent of ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]''. He also wrote pamphlets for the [[Catholic Truth Society]] and for [[Sword of the Spirit]], and translated a number of books on Catholic subjects.

Derrick was Chairman of the [[Challoner Club]], and from 1958 Secretary of the [[Catholic Union of Great Britain]]. He stood as the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] candidate for [[Reading North (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading North]] in the election of 1950, losing to the Labour candidate.

In 1951 he married Anneliese Burkhardt, and the couple made their home in [[Petersham, London|Petersham]]. They had two sons.

On 29 July 1961 he fell seriously ill, and he died on 5 August, a few hours after receiving the [[viaticum]].

'''Michael Thomas Pinder''' (born 27 December 1941 in [[Erdington]], [[Birmingham]]) is an English rock musician, and is a founding member and original keyboard player of the British rock group [[the Moody Blues]]. He left the group following the recording of the band's ninth album ''[[Octave (album)|Octave]]'' in 1978. He is especially noted for his technological contribution to music.
In 2018, Pinder was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of the Moody Blues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Moody Blues|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/moody-blues|website=Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame|accessdate=17 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
{{unsourced|section|date=March 2018}}
Pinder was born to Bert and Gladys Pinder in [[Kingstanding]], Birmingham, and as a young adult played in El Riot and the Rebels, a rock band that achieved some regional success. Bandmates in El Riot included future Moody Blues members [[Ray Thomas]] and [[John Lodge (musician)|John Lodge]]. 

After a spell in the British Army, Pinder and Thomas played together in a band called the Krew Cats; the band wound up in Germany playing at some of the cellars where [[The Beatles]] had polished their musicianship. Pinder and Thomas, with no money, had to walk across northern Europe to get back home to England. Around this time, Pinder was employed by Streetly Electronics, a firm that manufactured the [[Mellotron]].

==The Moody Blues==

===Early years===
[[File:Muziek, repetities, televisie, muzikanten, Grand Gala Du Disque, Bestanddeelnr 922-1751.jpg|thumb|Mike Pinder and [[Ray Thomas]] rehearsing (1969)]]
Pinder, Thomas and members of other successful Birmingham bands (singer/guitarist [[Denny Laine]], singer/bassist [[Clint Warwick]] and drummer [[Graeme Edge]]) formed The Moody Blues in 1964. Their initial [[Single (music)|single]], "Steal Your Heart Away" on [[Decca Records|Decca]], failed to chart. Their second release, "[[Go Now]]" however became UK No.1 in January 1965. The band went on to have a further UK hit with "I Don't Want To Go On Without You" and then release their first album ''[[The Magnificent Moodies]]'' (Decca) in mono only, on which Pinder took the lead vocal on a cover of [[James Brown]]'s "I Don't Mind". "Bye Bye Bird" from this album was also a big hit for the band in France. The album was released in the USA, retitled as ''Go Now'' on [[London Records]].

Pinder and guitarist/lead vocalist Laine began songwriting for the band, providing most [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]s over the 1965–66 period, including "You Don't (All The Time)", "And My Baby's Gone", "This Is My House (But Nobody Calls)" and "He Can Win". They progressed to writing A-sides, including the UK chart hits "Everyday", "From The Bottom of My Heart" (both 1965), "Boulevard De La Madeline" (1966), and "Life's Not Life" (issued in January 1967 but recorded much earlier in 1966), before bassist/vocalist Warwick and then frontman Laine left the group.

A rare non-UK Pinder–Laine song from this era was "People Gotta Go", released on the France-only [[Extended play|EP]] ''Boulevard De La Madeline'' and later included as a bonus track on a CD release of ''The Magnificent Moodies'' in 2006. The song is also known as "Send the People Away".

==='Core seven' period===
Pinder was instrumental in the selection of young Swindon guitarist/vocalist/songwriter [[Justin Hayward]] as Laine's replacement. It was Pinder who phoned Hayward and then collected him at the railway station. Old friend John Lodge from the El Riot days came in to replace the temporary Rod Clarke as permanent bassist/vocalist, thus completing the 'classic' Moodies line-up.

After an initial abortive attempt to continue with R&amp;B material, the band decided to drop all covers and record only original songs. Pinder and Hayward led the way: Hayward's "Fly Me High" was the first release from the revised line-up, released on Decca in early 1967 with Pinder's older-style rocker "Really Haven't Got The Time" as the B-side.

A recorded but unreleased Pinder song from this time (1967) was the jazz-blues ballad "Please Think About It", which would later be included on the ''[[Caught Live + 5]]'' double album issued by Decca in 1977.

Pinder obtained a secondhand Mellotron from Streetly and, after removing all the [[special effect]]s tapes (train whistles, cock crowing, etc.) and then doubling up the string section tapes, used it on numerous Moody Blues recordings. This began with their single "Love and Beauty", a [[flower power]] song written and sung by Pinder, and his only Moodies A-side after 1966. Pinder introduced the Mellotron to his friend [[John Lennon]]. The Beatles subsequently used the [[musical instrument|instrument]] on "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mikepinder.com/mellotron.shtml Mikepinder.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620130649/http://www.mikepinder.com/mellotron.shtml |date=20 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinder's "Dawn (Is A Feeling)" – with lead vocals by Hayward, and Pinder singing the bridge section – began the ''[[Days of Future Passed]]'' album, on which Pinder also contributed "The Sun Set" and narrated drummer Edge's opening and closing poems, "Morning Glory" and "Late Lament".

Pinder, along with Moodies recording engineer Derek Varnals and longtime producer Tony Clarke (a Decca staff producer assigned to them from "Fly Me High" onwards) managed to devise an innovative way of playing and recording the unwieldy Mellotron to make the sound flow in symphonic waves, as opposed to the sharp cutoff the instrument normally gave. This symphonic sound would characterise most of what later were seen as the Moodies' seven major albums between 1967 and 1972.
 
Pinder was one of the first musicians to use the Mellotron in live performance, relying on the mechanical skills he had gained from his time with Streetly to keep the unreliable instrument in working order. Typical of his travails was the Moodies' first US concert. When the band struck their first harmony, the back of the Mellotron fell open and all of the tape strips cascaded out. Pinder grabbed his tool box and got the instrument back into working order in 20 minutes' time, while the light crew entertained the audience by projecting cartoons.

In addition to the mellotron, organ and piano, Pinder also played harpsichord, Moog synthesizer, tablas, various forms of keyboards and percussion, autoharp, tambura and both acoustic and electric guitars on Moody Blues recordings from 1967 onwards, as well as providing key vocal harmonies and lead vocals from 1964 to 1978. Pinder also acted as the group's main musical arranger up to 1978.

The 1969 concert on the ''Caught Live + 5'' album and the ''[[Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970 (The Moody Blues album)|Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970]]'' DVD show Pinder and Thomas acting as the group's onstage spokesmen.

Pinder wrote and sang several of the Moodies' more progressive, even mystic numbers, including "(Thinking is) The Best Way To Travel" and "Om" (both from 1968's ''[[In Search of the Lost Chord]]''), plus the innovative symphonic rock piece "Have You Heard/The Voyage/Have You Heard (part two)" which concluded their 1969 album ''[[On the Threshold of a Dream]]''. Parts of this track later featured on the Loving Awareness [[jingle]]s on [[Radio Caroline]] during the 1970s. Pinder also continued to narrate Edge's poems, notably "The Word" (1968); "In The Beginning" (with Edge himself and Hayward) and "The Dream" (both 1969); and "The Balance" (1970).

On Edge's "Higher And Higher" (1969) Pinder's Mellotron simulated the sound of a rocket blasting off to open the ''[[To Our Children's Children's Children]]'' album, to which he wrote and sang "Sun is Still Shining" and a rare co-written song (with John Lodge), "Out and In", on which he also sang lead vocals. Pinder's Mellotron stands out particularly on tracks such as Edge's instrumental "Beyond" and the Hayward–Thomas closing track "Watching And Waiting".

Pinder's earlier non-album song "A Simple Game" (1968), for which he won an [[Ivor Novello Award]], was used as the B-side of their UK hit single "Ride My See Saw" from the "In Search of the Lost Chord" album on Deram; both this song and Pinder's  ''On The Threshold of A Dream'' song "[[So Deep Within You]]" (1969) were both later successfully covered by The [[Four Tops]].

On 12 October 1968 The Moodies had also cut a then unissued version of "A Simple Game", featuring Hayward on lead vocal, considering the song as a potential UK single which never materialised. The version sung by Pinder was used instead. The rare 'Hayward' version later appeared as a bonus track on the remastered CD version of ''In Search of the Lost Chord'', issued in 2006.

Pinder's 1970 album track "Melancholy Man" (from ''[[A Question of Balance]]'') became a No.1 hit as an overseas single in France that year. Pinder's "How is it (We Are Here)" was his other song contribution (a working title; "Mike's Number One" from the album sessions has since surfaced as a later CD release). All three songs had him singing lead vocals, as was usually the case with his compositions.

Pinder's composition and lead vocal "My Song", a deep, reflective atmospheric item, concluded the Moodies' 1971 album ''[[Every Good Boy Deserves Favour (album)|Every Good Boy Deserves Favour]]'', on which he also took co-credit with the entire band for the unusual opening track "Procession" (an attempt aurally to depict the evolution of vocal and musical harmony through time). He also sang a featured co-lead vocal and solo spot along with Hayward, Lodge and Thomas on Edge's song "After You Came".

Also in 1971 Pinder guested on John Lennon's ''[[Imagine (John Lennon album)|Imagine]]'' album on the songs "I Don't Wanna Be A Soldier (I Don't Wanna Die)" and "Jealous Guy", playing tambourine rather than the mellotron he intended to play, because by Pinder's account the tapes in Lennon's mellotron looked like "a bowl of [[spaghetti]]", hence the switch to tambourine.

In 1972 the Moodies, then at the height of their popularity, retreated to Mike Pinder's home studio to record ''[[Seventh Sojourn]]'', which included two Pinder-penned and -sung contributions: "Lost in a Lost World", and "When You're A Free Man", dedicated to [[Timothy Leary]]. However, Pinder switched to the similar-sounding but less-troublesome [[Chamberlin]] for this album.

===Band hiatus===
The Moody Blues took a break from recording in 1974, and Pinder relocated to [[California]], releasing a solo album ''[[The Promise (Mike Pinder album)|The Promise]]'' in 1976 through the Moodies' [[Threshold Records|Threshold]] [[record label|label]].

===Band reformation, Octave and departure===
In 1977 the band returned to recording and performing; Pinder declined full participation, although he collaborated on the 1978 release ''[[Octave (album)|Octave]]'' by recording an unused ''[[The Promise (Mike Pinder album)|Promise]]''-era song "One Step Into the Light" with the band. He also added some synthesizer and backing vocals to the album, notably the album intro to Lodge's "Steppin' in a Slide Zone" and the instrumental climax on Edge's "I'll Be Level with You"; he then stopped coming to the sessions when interpersonal conflicts (mostly with Edge) arose.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} During this time, Pinder was also in a new relationship resulting in marriage and children, thus he preferred not to tour with the band at the time. As a result, the band hired Swiss keyboardist [[Patrick Moraz]], formerly of [[Yes (band)|Yes]], in his place.

==Post-Moodies life==
Pinder took employment as a consultant to the [[Atari|Atari computer corporation]] (primarily working on music synthesis), remarried, and started a family in [[Grass Valley, California|Grass Valley]], California.  He remained out of the public eye until the mid-1990s, when he began to grant interviews and work on new recording projects. The year 1994 saw the release of his second solo album, ''Among the Stars'', on his own One Step label, to limited success. Another One Step release, ''A Planet With One Mind'' (1995), capitalised on Pinder's experience as chief reciter of [[Graeme Edge]]'s poetry on the seminal Moody Blues albums; in this recording, Pinder reads seven children's stories from different world cultures, accompanied by appropriate world music. As his first [[spoken word]] album, it was well received among its contemporaries in the genre – it was a finalist for the Benjamin Franklin Award for Excellence in Audio as an outstanding children's recording.

Pinder has continued to work in the [[recording studio|studio]] on his own and others' projects, and in developing new artists and nurturing the creative process. 

==Family and personal life==
Pinder's first marriage was to Donna, with whom he had his eldest son Daniel, but the marriage ended in divorce. Pinder then married an American, Tara Lee, with whom he had two sons Matt and Michael Lee. All three of his sons are musicians: his eldest, Daniel, is a film music editor and consultant, with many credits, including ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'' and ''[[The Da Vinci Code (film)|The Da Vinci Code]]''. Matt and Michael Lee perform as The Pinder Brothers. They have two CDs, ''Jupiter Falls'' and ''Ordinary Man''.  Several songs from both albums can be heard on their website and [https://www.myspace.com/thepinderbrothers their Myspace page]. Mike Pinder plays his trademark Mellotron on some of the songs.

In 2013 Justin Hayward spoke of Pinder's learning [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]] in 1967, along with other members of the Moody Blues.&lt;ref name=rcm2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gleason|first1=Paul|title=Justin Hayward of the Moody Blues on His Days of Future Passed (and Present)|url=http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2013/04/02/justin-hayward-interview-moody-blues-spirits-western-sky/#sthash.joDRnadl.dpuf|website=Rockcellar Magazine|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=2 April 2013|quote=We went to the TM Center at the same time that The Beatles did.

'''Nefer-Setekh''' (also written '''Nefersetekh''') is the name of an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian high official, who lived and worked either during the late midst of the [[Second Dynasty of Egypt|2nd]]&lt;ref name=TAW/&gt; or during the beginning of the [[Third Dynasty of Egypt|3rd dynasty]].&lt;ref name=KBK/&gt; He became known by his name, which was addressed to the deity [[Set (mythology)|Seth]].

== Attestations ==
Nefer-Setekh is known by his damaged [[tombstone|tomb stele]] found at [[Helwan]]. This stela depicts Nefer-Setekh as a deceased sitting in front of an offering table, dressed in a very tight gown. He looks to the right, his name and title are carved in directly above his head. At the right side of the offering table the stele depicts and describes sacrificial food such as [[poultry]], [[onion]]s, [[lettuce]] and [[bread]]. Furthermore, the stela contains a list in tabular form, it provides the enumeration and description of precious clothes and fabrics such as [[canvas]] and yarn. The list also contains the enumeration and description of several sorts of [[fragrance oil]] and [[incense]].&lt;ref name=CKJ&gt;Christiana Köhler, Jana Jones: ''Helwan II, The Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom Funerary Stelae.''

== Identity ==
Nefer-Setekh's only preserved [[bureaucratic]] title is that of an "[[priest|wab-priest]] of the king". Details about his family are unknown.&lt;ref name=TAW/&gt;

Nefer-Setekh's name means "Seth is merciful", since the [[hieroglyph]]ic sign for ''Nefer'' (Gardiner sign '''''F35''''') means "kindly" or "merciful" when connected to a certain deity.&lt;ref name=KBK&gt;Jochem Kahl, Markus Bretschneider, Barbara Kneissler: ''Frühägyptisches Wörterbuch, 1. Teil''. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2002, {{ISBN|3-447-04594-9}}, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; The name is of special interest for Egyptologists and Historians as well, because it is directly addressed to the deity Seth. This leads Egyptologists such as [[Toby Wilkinson]]&lt;ref name=TAW/&gt; and [[Christiana Köhler]]&lt;ref name=CKJ/&gt; to a datation of Nefer-Setekh's lifetime into the late midst of the 2nd dynasty, when the deity Seth experienced special popularity.&lt;ref name=TAW&gt;Toby A. Wilkinson: ''Early Dynastic Egyp''t. Routledge, London 2001, {{ISBN|0-415-18633-1}}, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Egyptologists, such as [[Jochem Kahl]]&lt;ref name=KBK/&gt; and [[Katrin Scheele]]&lt;ref name=KSD&gt;Katrin Scheele: ''Die Stofflisten des Alten Reiches: Lexikographie, Entwicklung und Gebrauch.'' Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2005, {{ISBN|3-447-05092-6}}, p. 13, 60, 62.&lt;/ref&gt; contradict this datation. The use of slab stelas with tabular lists including the enumeration of offering items is not archaeologically attested until the beginning of the 3rd dynasty and special signs for numbers such as used in Nefer-Setekh's stela were also not in use before that time.&lt;ref name=KBK/&gt;&lt;ref name=KSD/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8685">{{Redirect|Porter (doorkeeper)|the profession of doorkeeper|Doorman (disambiguation){{!}}Doorman}}
An '''ostiarius''', a [[Latin]] word sometimes anglicized as '''ostiary''' but often literally translated as '''porter''' or '''[[Doorman (profession)|doorman]]''', originally was a servant or guard posted at the entrance of a building. See also [[gatekeeper]].

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], this "porter" became the lowest of the four [[minor orders]] prescribed by the [[Council of Trent]].  This was the first order a seminarian was admitted to after receiving the [[tonsure]].  The porter had in ancient times the duty of opening and closing the church-door and of guarding the church; especially of ensuring no unbaptised persons would enter during the [[Eucharist]]. Later on, the Porter would also guard, open and close the doors of the [[Sacristy]], [[Baptistry]] and elsewhere in the church.

The porter was not a part of [[Holy Orders]] administering sacraments but simply a preparatory job on the way to the [[Major orders]]: [[subdiaconate]] (until its suppression, after the [[Second Vatican Council]] by [[Pope Paul VI]]), [[deacon|diaconate]] and the [[priest]]hood. Like the other minor orders and the subdiaconate, it is retained in societies such as the [[Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter]].

==History==
Porter denoted among the Romans the slave whose duty it was to guard the entrance of the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeWitt|first1=Norman W.|title=The Primitive Roman Household|journal=The Classical Journal|date=January 1920|volume=15|issue=4|page=219|jstor=3288304}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Roman period all houses of the upper classes had an ostiarius, or ostiary, whose duties were considered very inferior. A [[basilica]] originally served as a Roman court of law, and it was the duty of the ostiarius to regulate the approach of litigants to the judge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1ZbYAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1528&amp;lpg=PA1528&amp;dq=ostiarius&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MU_GM8Y_3j&amp;sig=RgmsWtfrU5RNR6yzuqfLRnNumts&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjujZKSiJ3QAhWK14MKHcGyBe44HhDoAQgoMAM#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Ostiarius", ''A Dictionary of Christian Antiquities'', vol.2, (William Smith, Samuel Cheetham, eds.), J. Murray, 1880]&lt;/ref&gt;

When, from the end of the second century, the Christian communities began to own houses for holding church services and for purposes of administration, church ostiaries are soon mentioned, at least for the larger cities. They are first referred to in the letter of Pope Cornelius to Bishop Fabius of Antioch written in 251,&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius]], ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', VI, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; where it is said that there were then at Rome 46 priests, 7 deacons, 7 subdeacons, 42 acolytes, and 52 exorcists, lectors, and ostiaries, or doorkeepers. According to the statement of the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Duchesne, ''Origines du culte chrétien'' (5th ed., Paris, 1909). I, 155&lt;/ref&gt; an ostiary named Romanus suffered martyrdom in 258 at the same time as St. Lawrence.

In Western Europe the office of the ostiary was the lowest grade of the minor clergy. In a law of 377 of the ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]''&lt;ref&gt;Lib. XVI, tit. II, num. XXIV; ed. Gothofredi, VI, I, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; intended for the Vicariate of Italy, the ostiaries are also mentioned among the clergy who have a right to personal immunity. In his letter of 11 March 494, to the bishops of southern Italy and Sicily, [[Pope Gelasius I|Pope Gelasius]] says that for admission into the clergy it was necessary that the candidate could read (must, therefore, have a certain amount of education), for without this prerequisite an applicant could, at the most, only fill the office of an ostiary.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Patrologia Latina]]'', LVI, 691.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome itself this office attained to no particular development, as a large part of these duties, namely the actual work necessary in the church building, what is now probably the duty of the sexton, was at Rome performed by the mansionarii. The clergy of the three lower grades (minor orders) were united at Rome into the ''Schola cantorum'' (choir) and as such took part in the church ceremonies. There are no special prayers or ceremonies for the ordination of the lower clergy in the oldest [[liturgical book]]s of the Roman Church.&lt;ref name=Kirsch&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12284b.htm Kirsch, Johann Peter. "Porter." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 9 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Gallican Rite]], short statements concerning the ordination of the lower orders, among them that of the ostiaries, are found in the "Statuta ecclesiæ antiqua" a collection of canons which appeared at Arles about the beginning of the sixth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Maassen]], "Quellen des Kirchenrechts", I, 382.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Sacramentarium Gelasianum" and the "Missale Francorum" contain the same rite with the prayers used on this occasion.

According to these the ostiaries are first instructed in their duties by the [[archdeacon]]; after this he brings them before the bishop who takes the keys of the church from the altar and hands them to the candidate for ordination with the words: "Fulfil thine office to show that thou knowest that thou wilt give account to God concerning the things that are locked away under these keys." Then follows a prayer for the candidate and a prayer for the occasion that the bishop pronounces over him. This ceremony was also at a later date adopted by the Roman Church in its liturgy.&lt;ref name=Kirsch/&gt;

In Latin Western Europe, outside of Rome, in the late Roman era and the one following, the ostiaries were still actually employed as guardians of the church buildings and of their contents. This is shown by the epitaph of one Ursatius, an ostiary of [[Trier]].&lt;ref&gt;Corpus inscript. latin., XIII, 3789.&lt;/ref&gt; An ostiary of the church of [[Salona]] is also mentioned in an epitaph.&lt;ref&gt;Corpus inscr. Iatin., III, 13142.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, however, in the Latin Church the office of ostiary universally remained only one of the degrees of ordination and the actual work of the ostiary was transferred to the laity ([[sacristan]]s, [[Sexton (office)|sexton]]s, etc.).

In the ordination of ostiaries their duties are thus enumerated in the Pontifical: "Percutere cymbalum et campanam, aperire ecclesiam et sacrarium, et librum ei aperire qui prædicat" (to ring the bell, to open the church and sacristy, to open the book for the preacher). The forms of prayer for the ordination are similar to those in the old Gallican Rite.&lt;ref name=Kirsch/&gt;

In the East there were also doorkeepers in the service of the Church. They are enumerated as ecclesiastical persons by the [[Council of Laodicea]] (c. 343-81).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Schaff|editor1-first=Philip|editor1-link=Philip Schaff|title=Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, Series 2|volume=14: The Seven Ecumenical Councils|date=1900|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.viii.vii.iii.xxviii.html|chapter=Canon XXIV, Synod of Laodicea|quote=No one of the priesthood, from presbyters to deacons, and so on in the ecclesiastical order to subdeacons, readers, singers, exorcists, door-keepers, or any of the class of the Ascetics, ought to enter a tavern.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the acolytes and exorcists, they were only appointed to serve the church, but received no actual ordination and were not regarded as belonging to the ecclesiastical hierarchy. According to the "Apostolic Constitutions" belonging to the end of the fourth century the guarding of the door of the church during the service was the duty of the deacons and subdeacons. Thus the doorkeepers exercised their office only when service was not being held.

The minor order no longer exists officially in the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] and was abolished in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] by [[Pope Paul VI]] in his apostolic letter, ''Ministeria quaedam'' of August 15, 1972.&lt;ref name=OxfordDict3&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Cross|editor1-first=F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10733">'''Patricia Stallings''' (born 1964 or 1965) is an American woman who was wrongfully convicted of murder after the death of her son Ryan on September 7, 1989. Because testing seemed to indicate an elevated level of [[ethylene glycol]] in Ryan's blood, authorities suspected [[ethylene glycol poisoning|antifreeze poisoning]] and they arrested Patricia Stallings the next day. She was convicted of murder in early 1991 and sentenced to life in prison. 

After she went to prison, Stallings gave birth to another child; he was diagnosed with [[methylmalonic acidemia]], a medical condition that can mimic antifreeze poisoning. Prosecutors initially did not believe that the sibling's diagnosis had anything to do with Ryan's case, but experts testified that Ryan had also died of MMA. Stallings was released from prison in July 1991 and prosecutors decided to close the case two months later. Stallings later sued the hospital and laboratories that were involved in Ryan's care and reached an out-of-court settlement.

==Background==
Stallings lived in St. Louis and was a convenience store clerk in the mid-1980s. David Stallings frequently came into her store and they began to date in 1986. They got married in 1988.&lt;ref name=Tipton/&gt; Their first son, Ryan, was born in April 1989.&lt;ref name="Uhlenbrock"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Uhlenbrock|first1=Tom|title=Mother's tale: Son's death, her imprisonment|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/139942651/?terms=patricia%2Bstallings|accessdate=January 14, 2017|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|date=April 4, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia took Ryan to [[Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital]] in early July 1989. He was experiencing vomiting and difficulty breathing, and he was admitted to the [[pediatric intensive care unit]].&lt;ref name=Unsolved/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tipton/&gt;

Noting a high level of what they then believed to be ethylene glycol in the baby's blood, physicians suspected that the boy had been poisoned with antifreeze.&lt;ref name="Unsolved"&gt;{{cite web|title=Patty Stallings|url=http://unsolved.com/archives/patty-stallings|website=unsolved.com|accessdate=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The infant was placed in protective custody. On August 31 of that year, Stallings was allowed a short visit with her son.&lt;ref name=Uhlenbrock/&gt; Ryan's illness seemed to recur 4 days after the visit, and Stallings was arrested on assault charges on September 5.  Ryan was treated for ethylene glycol poisoning  but  Ryan died two days later. The charges were revised to [[Murder#Degrees of murder|first-degree murder]].&lt;ref name=Uhlenbrock/&gt;

==Investigation and legal proceedings==
While she was in jail awaiting trial, Stallings gave birth to another son, David Jr., on February 17, 1990. He was placed in foster care, but in March, he developed similar symptoms as those that had affected Ryan. He was diagnosed with [[methylmalonic acidemia]] (MMA), a genetic condition in which the body produces [[propionic acid]], a compound that differs from ethylene glycol by one [[carbon]] atom. David Jr. recovered and was placed in foster care.&lt;ref name=Exonerations/&gt; 

During the investigation and ensuing trial, Stallings's defense attorney wanted to introduce the theory that Ryan had died of MMA, but the prosecutor, George B. McElroy, considered the sibling's diagnosis irrelevant to Ryan's death and the judge, Gary Kramer, would not allow him to advance the theory without any evidence that Ryan was actually affected by MMA. Stallings wanted her attorney to call character witnesses to testify on her behalf, but he did not do so. She was convicted of first-degree murder and given a life sentence.&lt;ref name="Exonerations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Patricia Stallings – National Registry of Exonerations|url=https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=3660|website=www.law.umich.edu|accessdate=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May of 1990, defense attorney Eric Rathbone obtained copies of notes which later determined to have been written by assistant prosecutor John S. Appelbaum. The notes indicated that the doctor who pronounced Ryan dead had considered the possibility of an MMA diagnosis, but also that he had not tested Ryan for it at the time. After the discovery of the note, prosecutors said that they believed that there were important differences between ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, and they said that even if Ryan had had MMA, they thought that he had also been poisoned.&lt;ref name="Disorder"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Uhlenbrock|first1=Tom|title=Baby in murder case not tested for fatal disorder|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/139958658/?terms=patricia%2Bstallings|accessdate=January 15, 2017|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|date=May 5, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stallings case was featured on the ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' television program, and biochemist [[William S. Sly|William Sly]] of [[Saint Louis University]] saw the episode. He agreed to test Ryan's blood, and gave it to Dr. James Shoemaker, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Metabolic Screening Lab at St Louis University. Dr. Shoemaker immediately confirmed that Ryan had had MMA. However, ethylene glycol is not a human metabolite, even in cases of MMA, and Patricia Stallings went to trial with no explanation linking MMA to ethylene glycol. Much later, after the case was featured on ''Unsolved Mysteries,'' Dr. Shoemaker asked prosecutor George McElroy for the methods that had been used to measure ethylene glycol in Ryan's blood, and McElroy supplied that information. When the method was used on blood from Ryan and DJ, it was seen that propionic acid, which ''is'' produced in methylmalonic acidemia, caused a result that careless observers might mistake for ethylene glycol. (ref. 14, below) Dr.  Shoemaker then sent samples of propionate-spiked blood to several laboratories, who tested it with the same methods used in the Stallings case. Some of the laboratories came to the incorrect conclusion that the blood reflected ethylene glycol poisoning.&lt;ref name=Exonerations/&gt; At Sly's and Shoemaker's request, Piero Rinaldo of [[Yale University]] also looked at the case and concluded that Ryan had died of MMA. His testimony helped to convince McElroy that Ryan might not have been poisoned.&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Juan|first1=Stephen|title=Justice fails as illness mistaken for abuse|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/120258976/?terms=patricia%2Bstallings|accessdate=January 15, 2017|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=March 12, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lehninger/&gt;

In July of 1991, Stallings was released from jail pending a new trial. She was placed on house arrest.&lt;ref name="SNL"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mother convicted of killing baby released, to get new trail (sic)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/207886053/?terms=patricia%2Bstallings|accessdate=January 15, 2017|work=[[Springfield News-Leader]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=July 31, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September of 1991, prosecutors apologized to Stallings and dropped the case against her.&lt;ref name=Exonerations/&gt; Stallings said that she lost a lot of weight due to the stress of being imprisoned. She said that her Buddhist faith helped to keep her strong during that time.&lt;ref name="Tipton"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tipton|first1=Virgil|title=Fight's over|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/141439318|accessdate=January 14, 2017|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|date=September 22, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Stallings won a settlement against Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital and the laboratory that tested Ryan's blood.&lt;ref name=Exonerations/&gt; She later said that the perception of her case may have been influenced by the case of Paula Sims, which had unfolded around the same time. In that case, a mother had been tried and convicted of killing her two daughters, and there was considerable public outcry over the murders.&lt;ref name=Uhlenbrock/&gt; 

In 1994, McElroy ran for reelection as Jefferson County prosecutor, and Stallings donated $10,000 to his opponent, Robert Wilkins.&lt;ref name="Malone"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malone|first1=Roy|title=Candidate haunted by past: Woman gives $10,000 to unseat prosecutor|url=https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1P2-32880461/candidate-haunted-by-past-woman-gives-10-000-to-unseat|accessdate=January 14, 2017|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|date=June 28, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkins won the race. When McElroy offered to show Wilkins his information on the Stallings case, Stallings found out and asked a court to have her arrest record expunged. Some of the information was ordered to be expunged, but a judge said that Missouri law mandated that prosecutors confidentially maintain some of the information related to felony arrests.&lt;ref name="Backs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge backs Stallings' request|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/141698717/?terms=patricia%2Bstallings|accessdate=January 15, 2017|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|date=September 29, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''philosophy and religion of the Tlingit''', although never formally codified, was historically a fairly well organized philosophical and religious system whose basic axioms shaped the way all [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] people viewed and interacted with the world around them. Between 1886 and 1895, in the face of their shamans' inability to treat Old World diseases including [[smallpox]], many Tlingit people converted to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Robert Thomas.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=zQAa1thUUh8C&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=Tlingit%20elders%20christianity&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "Shamanism and Christianity: Modern-Day Tlingit Elders Look at the Past."] Klass, Morton and Maxine Wiesgrau, eds.

==Dualism==


The Tlingit see the world as a system of dichotomies. The most obvious is the division between the light water and the dark forest which surrounds their daily lives in the Tlingit homeland.

Water serves as a primary means of transportation, and as a source of most Tlingit foods. Its surface is flat and broad, and most dangers on the water are readily perceived by the naked eye. Light reflects brightly off the sea, and it is one of the first things that a person in Southeast Alaska sees when they look outside. Like all things, danger lurks beneath its surface, but these dangers are for the most part easily avoided with some caution and planning. For such reasons it is considered a relatively safe and reliable place, and thus represents the apparent forces of the Tlingit world.

In contrast, the dense and forbidding rainforest of Southeast Alaska is dark and misty in even the brightest summer weather. Untold dangers from bears, falling trees, dank muskeg, and the risk of being lost all make the forest a constantly dangerous place. Vision in the forest is poor, reliable landmarks are few, and food is scarce in comparison to the seashore. Entering the forest always means travelling uphill, often up the sides of steep mountains, and clear trails are rare to nonexistent. Thus the forest represents the hidden forces in the Tlingit world. 

Another series of dichotomies in Tlingit thought are wet versus dry, heat versus cold, and hard versus soft. A wet, cold climate causes people to seek warm, dry shelter. The traditional Tlingit house, with its solid [[Thuja plicata|redcedar]] construction and blazing central fireplace, represented an ideal Tlingit conception of warmth, hardness, and dryness. Contrast the soggy forest floor that is covered with soft rotten trees and moist, squishy moss, both of which make for uncomfortable habitation. Three attributes that Tlingits value in a person are hardness, dryness, and heat. These can be perceived in many different ways, such as the hardness of strong bones or the hardness of a firm will; the heat given off by a healthy living man, or the heat of a passionate feeling; the dryness of clean skin and hair, or the sharp dry scent of cedar.

==Spirituality==


The Tlingit divide the living being into several components:
* ''khaa daa'' — body, physical being, person's outside (cf. ''aas daayí'' "tree's bark or outside")
** ''khaa daadleeyí'' — the flesh of the body (&amp;lt; ''daa'' + ''dleey'' "meat, flesh")
** ''khaa ch'áatwu'' — skin
** ''khaa s'aaghí'' — bones
* ''xh'aséikw'' — vital force, breath (&amp;lt; ''disaa'' "to breathe")
* ''khaa toowú'' — mind, thought and feelings
* ''khaa yahaayí'' — soul, shadow
* ''khaa yakghwahéiyagu'' — ghost, revenant
** ''s'igheekháawu'' — ghost in a cemetery

The physical components are those that have no proper life after death. The skin is viewed as the covering around the insides of the body, which are divided roughly into bones and flesh. The flesh decays quickly, and in most cases has little spiritual value, but the bones form an essential part of the Tlingit spiritual belief system. Bones are the hard and dry remains of something which has died, and thus are the physical reminder of that being after its death. In the case of animals, it is essential that the bones be properly handled and disposed, since mishandling may displease the spirit of the animal and may prevent it from being reincarnated. The reason for the spirit's displeasure is rather obvious, since a salmon who was resurrected without a jaw or tail would certainly refuse to run again in the stream where it had died.

The significant bones in a human body are the backbone and the eight "long bones" of the limbs. The eight long bones are emphasized because that number has spiritual significance in Tlingit culture. The bones of a cremated body must be collected and placed with those of the person's clan ancestors, or else the person's spirit might be disadvantaged or displeased in the afterlife, which could cause repercussions if the ghost decided to haunt people or if the person was reincarnated.

The source of living can be found in ''xh'aséikw'', the essence of life. This bears some resemblance to the Chinese concept of [[qi]] as a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] energy without which a thing is not alive; however in Tlingit thought this can be equated to the breath as well. For example, the shaman's simplest test for whether a person is alive is to hold a downy feather above the mouth or nose; if the feather is disturbed then the person is breathing and thus alive, even if the breath is not audible or sensible. This then implies that the person still maintains ''xh'aséikw''.

The feelings and thoughts of a person are encompassed by the ''khaa toowú''. This is a very basic idea in Tlingit culture. When a Tlingit references their mind or feelings, he always discusses this in terms of ''axh toowú'', "my mind". Thus "''Axh toowú yanéekw''", "I am sad", literally "My mind is pained".

Both ''xh'aséikw'' and ''khaa toowú'' are mortal, and cease to exist upon the death of a being. However, the ''khaa yahaayí'' and ''khaa yakghwahéiyagu'' are immortal and persist in various forms after death. The idea of ''khaa yahaayí'' is that it is the person's essence, shadow, or reflection. It can even refer to the appearance of a person in a photograph or painting, and is metaphorically used to refer to the behavior or appearance of a person as other than what he is or should be.

==Death and the afterlife==

{{Expand section|Cremation emphasises hot and dry. Ghosts and spirits. Reincarnation and yakghwahéiyagu.|date=June 2007}}

Heat, dryness, and hardness are all represented as parts of the Tlingit practice of cremation. The body is burned, removing all water under great heat, and leaving behind only the hard bones. The soul goes on to be near the heat of the great bonfire in the house in the spirit world, unless it is not cremated in which case it is relegated to a place near the door with the cold winds. The hardest part of the spirit, the most physical part, is reincarnated into a clan descendant.

==Shamanism==
[[File:Tlingit shaman 1900.jpg|thumb|Tlingit Shaman, ca. 1900. Portrait of man wearing fur cape and carved amulet necklace, holding raven rattle]]

The shaman is called ixht'.  He was the healer, and the one who foretold the future.  He was called upon to heal the sick, drive out those who practiced witchcraft, and tell the future.

It is a mis-nomer to call him "witch doctor" as the practices of the ixht' and the "witch" are completely different and they were at odds with each other.  To call one a medicine man is not correct either as "medicine master" is naak'w s'aati, which is the Tlingit term for a witch.

The name of the ixht' and his songs and stories of his visions are the property of the clan he belongs to.  He would seek spirit helpers from various animals and after fasting for four days when the animal would 'stand up in front of him' before entering him he would obtain the spirit.  The tongue of the animal would be cut out and added to his collection of spirit helpers.  This is why he was referred to by some as "the spirit man".

Future shamans would be chosen before their birth by the elders of a Tlingit community.  The elders knew about people and what they would be before they were born.  The boy training to become a shaman would be told how to approach the grave and how to handle the objects.  Touching shaman objects was strictly forbidden except to a shaman and his helpers.  In fact, the elders had a word solely for the instance when a child tried to touch or play with a shaman's objects.  The word carried a heavy tone and that was all that needed to be said.

All shamans are gone from the Tlingit today and their practices will likely never be revived, although shaman spirit songs are still done in their ceremonies, and their stories re-told at those times.

==Kushtakas==

{{Expand section|All Tlingit fear drowning. Land otter boogeyman. Helpful kooshda.|date=June 2007}}

The Kushtaka (kû'cta-qa) are the dreaded and feared Land Otter People, human from the waist up, and otter-like below. Land otters are excellent fishers. Those who are drowned often marry (and become) land otters, and land otters can assist in drownings. Land otters are sinister and potentially harmful. When properly controlled, however, the land otter can be of great help to humans, such as fishermen who penetrate the sacred realm beyond social boundaries. Those drowned and married to land otters (and their land otter children) can return to their human relations and assist them, usually by helping them catch abundant supplies of seafood. The land otters can only eat raw food, for if they eat cooked fish they will die; and as supernatural beings, after being out on the water they must regain land and find shelter before the raven calls or they will die.

Those that drown and are saved by the Kushtaka are known as Kushtakakhaa.  They live with the Kushtaka, but because they were once human, they travel back to their old communities now and again.  Except now, as Kushtakakhaa, they have the power to sway people's minds and shape shift.

==Limitations of scholarship==
It is impossible for any of the information on this page to be taken literally for the fact that so much is lost in converting the Tlingit culture to English words.  Meaning is lost in language conversion, especially between two so very different languages such as these as opposed to, say, the closer related tongues of French and Spanish.

A '''precentor''' is a person who helps facilitate worship.  The details vary depending on the religion, denomination, and era in question. The [[Latin]] derivation is "præcentor", from [[cantor (church)|cantor]], meaning "the one who sings before" (or alternatively, "first singer").

==Ancient precentors==

The chief precentor was the highest position in many [[ancient Mesopotamia]]n cities (see [[Music of Mesopotamia]]).

==Jewish precentors==

Jewish precentors are song or prayer leaders, leading [[synagogue music]].  A Jewish precentor is typically called a [[hazzan]] or [[Cantor in Reform Judaism|cantor]]. In the Middle Ages, women precentors leading prayers in the ''weibershul'' (women's gallery) were known as [[firzogerin]], vorsangerin, foreleiner, zugerin, or zugerke.

==Christian precentors==

[[File:View from Precentor's Court.jpg|thumb|left|A view of [[York Minster]] from a street named Precentor's Court.]]

A precentor is a member of a church who helps facilitate worship.  The role of precentor was carried over from the [[synagogue]]s into the early church.&lt;ref&gt;Moseley, Dr. Ron: ''[https://web.archive.org/web/19981201194151/http://www.haydid.org/yeshron1.htm Yeshua: A Guide to the Real Jesus and the Original Church]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic precentors===
{{Catholic Church Hierarchy}}

====Ancient era====
The term ''precentor'' described sometimes an [[ecclesiastical]] dignitary, sometimes an administrative or ceremonial officer. Anciently, the precentor had various duties: he was the first or leading chanter, who on Sundays and greater feasts intoned certain [[antiphons]], [[psalms]], [[hymns]], [[responsories]] etc.; gave the pitch or tone to the [[bishop]] and [[Dean (religion)|dean]] at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] (the [[succentor]] performing a similar office to the [[Canon (priest)|canons]] and [[clerk (choral)|clerks]]); recruited and taught the [[choir]], directed its [[rehearsal]]s and supervised its official functions; interpreted the [[rubric]]s and explained the [[ceremonies]], ordered in a general way the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] and sometimes composed desired [[hymns]], [[Sequence (religion)|sequences]], and [[Lection|lessons]] of [[saints]]. He was variously styled ''capiscol'' (from the Latin ''caput scholæ'', head of the choir-school), ''[[prior]] scholæ'', ''magister scholæ'', and ''primicerius'' (a word of widely different implications). [[Victor of St. Hugo]] tells us that in the care of the primicerius were placed the [[acolytes]], [[exorcism|exorcists]], [[lector]]s, and psalmists (chanters).

====Middle Ages====
In the [[Middle Ages]] the principal dignitaries of [[cathedral]], [[chapter (religion)|collegiate chapter]]s, and [[monastic]] orders, imitated the example of [[St. Gregory the Great]] in acting as directors of chant-schools. The [[schola]] was always in attendance when the bishop officiated in his cathedral, and to the precentor was assigned a place near the bishop and high in dignity. His office was obviously one demanding much learning and executive ability, and his dignity corresponded with his duties.

In the cathedrals of England, France, Spain, and Germany, he ranked sometimes next to the dean, sometimes next to the [[archdeacon]]. In some instances his sphere of activity was much broader, including the duty of installing deans, canons, and other dignitaries; and in some [[monasteries]], the duties of librarian and registrar. But from the fourteenth century his title and dignity were largely handed over to incumbents whose musical knowledge did not fit them for the duties to which the name of precentor owed its origin; the dignities remained, but the duties became obscured. "In France, some chapters retain traces of the dignity of Precentor, and one may see sometimes an archdeacon, sometimes a titular or honorary canon, carrying the baton cantoral, the insignia of his office".&lt;ref&gt;[[Migne]], "Dict. de Droit Canon", s.v. Chantre.&lt;/ref&gt; This "baton cantoral" is a silver or white staff. "In the dioceses of Aix, Carcassonne, Coutances, Dijon, Metz, Orléans, the dignity of Precentor is still the highest in the chapter.... Some chapters have sub-chanters, those of Arras being among the honorary resident canons",&lt;ref&gt;Migne, "Dict. de Jurisprudence", s.v. Grand Chantre.&lt;/ref&gt; where also the quoted statutes of the [[Bishop of Dijon]] may serve to illustrate the modern idea of the office of precentor: "The Précenteur or Grand Chantre is the head of the choir and ... brings the antiphon to the bishop when officiating pontifically. [[Sacristan]]s, chanters, choir-boys, and employés of the Cathedral are placed under his surveillance. He will also preserve order and silence in the sacristy").&lt;ref&gt;Henry, H. (1911). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12372a.htm "Precentor"]. In ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]''. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved June 15, 2010 from New Advent&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cistercians.shef.ac.uk/glossary/precentor.php Precentor], The Cistercians in Yorkshire. Retrieved June 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anglican precentors===

A precentor is a person, usually a clergy member, who is in charge of preparing worship services. This position is usually held in a large church. Most [[cathedral]]s have a precentor in charge of the organisation of liturgy and worship. The precentor of a cathedral is usually a residentiary [[canon (priest)|canon]] or [[prebendary]], and may be assisted by a [[succentor]] (particularly in the daily task of leading choral singing). In some cathedrals (including [[Canterbury Cathedral|Canterbury]]), the Precentor is a [[minor Canon]], and therefore part of the Foundation, but not part of the Chapter.
[[File:Pulpit and Communion Table in Duirinish Church - geograph.org.uk - 1548755.jpg|thumb|right|190px|The [[pulpit]] and [[communion table]] from the [[Church of Scotland]] church in [[Duirinish, Skye]]. Between the two is the box for the precentor.]]
Traditionally the precentor's [[choir stall|stall]] (seat) in the cathedral is on the opposite side of the [[Choir (architecture)|Quire]] from that of the Dean, leading to the traditional division of the [[choir|singers]] into [[Decani]] (the Dean's side) and [[Cantoris]] (the precentor's side).

===Presbyterian precentors===

In Presbyterian churches that worship in the historical fashion (i.e., sing [[a cappella]]; see [[Presbyterian worship]]), a precentor is a person (man or woman, not necessarily clergy) who leads the singing, often by means of [[conducting]] techniques, but sometimes just by singing from amongst the congregation.

Churches that use a repeat-after-me manner of singing called [[lining out]] (used primarily when sufficient numbers of [[psalter|psalm books]] are unavailable, or the congregation insufficiently literate, as was the case in the black church in [[Harper Lee]]'s [[To Kill a Mockingbird]]) are usually led by the precentor, much as with other non-instrumental churches.

===Public schools and Cambridge===

The word "precentor" is also used at two English public schools, Radley College and Eton College, to refer to the Head of Music. These school precentors have no specific religious duties although, as part of their musical function, they may conduct the college chapel choir. At [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]], the precentor's main responsibility is as director of the college choir, which provides music for chapel services.

A '''prostration''' (Pali: ''panipāta'', Skt.: ''namas-kara'', Ch.: ''li-pai'', Jp.: ''raihai'') is a gesture used in [[Buddhist]] practice to show reverence to the [[Triple Gem]] (comprising the Buddha, his teachings, and the spiritual community) and other objects of veneration.

Among Buddhists prostration is believed to be beneficial for practitioners for several reasons, including:
*an experience of [[dana (Buddhism)|giving]] or veneration
*an act to purify [[kilesa|defilements]], especially conceit
*a preparatory act for [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]]
*an act that accumulates [[merit (Buddhism)|merit]] (see [[karma in Buddhism|karma]])

In contemporary Western Buddhism, some teachers use prostrations as a practice unto itself,&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Tromge (1995), pp. 87-96.&lt;/ref&gt; while other teachers relegate prostrations to customary [[liturgy|liturgical]] ritual, ancillary to [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Aitken (1982), pp. 29-31, where he discusses such rituals as having a twofold purpose: "First, ritual helps to deepen our religious spirit and to extend its vigor to our lives.  Second, ritual is an opening for the experience of forgetting the self as the words or the actions become one with you, and there is nothing else." (p. 29).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theravada Buddhism==
In the [[Pali canon]], laypersons prostrating before the then-living Buddha is mentioned in several [[Sūtra|sutta]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Khantipalo (1982).  In addition to making this general statement, Khantipalo quotes an example of lay people prostrating before the Buddha from the [[Kalama Sutta]] ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 3.65).&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Theravada Buddhism]], as part of daily practice, one typically prostrates before and after [[Buddhist chant|chanting]] and [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]]. On these occasions, one typically prostrates three times: once to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], once to the [[Dhamma]], and once to the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]].  More generally, one can also prostrate before "any sacred object of veneration."&lt;ref&gt;Indaratana (2002), p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theravada Buddhists execute a type of prostration that is known as "five-point veneration" (Pali: ''patitthitapanca'') or the "five-limbed prostration" (Pali: ''pañc'anga-vandana'') where the two palms and elbows, two sets of toes and knees, and the forehead are placed on the floor.&lt;ref&gt;Indaratana (2002), p. v. Khantipalo (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;  More specifically:

{{quote|... In the kneeling position, one's hand in añjali [palms together, fingers flat out and pointed upward] are raised to the forehead and then lowered to the floor so that the whole forearm to the elbow is on the ground, the elbow touching the knee. The hands, palm down, are four to six inches apart with just enough room for the forehead to be brought to the ground between them. Feet are still as for the kneeling position and the knees are about a foot apart....&lt;ref name="Khantipalo 1982"&gt;Khantipalo (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Myanmar (Burma), prostrations are accompanied by the common Buddhist prayer, known as [[okāsa]].

In Thailand, traditionally, each of the three aforementioned prostrations are accompanied by the following [[Pali]] verses:&lt;ref name="Khantipalo 1982"/&gt;
{| cellspacing="10" style="margin:0.5em auto"
|-
| '''First Prostration'''
| style="border-left:1px solid #AAAAAA;border-right:1px solid #AAAAAA" | ''Araham samma-sambuddho bhagava&lt;br /&gt;Buddham bhagavantam abhivademi.''
| The Noble One, the fully Enlightened One, the Exalted One,&lt;br /&gt;I bow low before the Exalted Buddha.
|-
| '''Second Prostration'''
| style="border-left:1px solid #AAAAAA;border-right:1px solid #AAAAAA" | ''Svakkhato bhagavata dhammo&lt;br /&gt;Dhammam namassami.''

|}

In Theravadin countries such as Sri Lanka, when one goes before one's teacher, in order to "open one's mind up to receive instructions," one bows and recites the phrase, "Okāsa ahaṃ bhante vandāmi" ("I pay homage to you venerable sir").&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi (2006), ''Sn 2.9 Kiṃsīla Sutta — Right Conduct'' (lecture) at time 25:20, available as "Sn032" (mp3) from "Bodhi Monastery" at http://www.bodhimonastery.net/bm/about-buddhism/audio/903-audio/84-sutta-nipata.html.  Before a nun (as opposed to a monk), one would presumably use ''ayye'' instead of ''bhante''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mahayana Buddhism==
{{quotebox|width=35em
| title = An American in Dokusan
| quote =
Zen master [[Phillip Kapleau]] recounts his first stay in "a real Zen monastery":

{{quote|How well, too, I remember the first time I came before my teacher in [[dokusan]].  As you know, it is customary to prostrate oneself before the [[Rōshi|roshi]] as a sign of respect and humility.  But how that went against my grain, and how I resisted it! "... [W]hat does all this have to do with Zen?"

My teacher, well aware of these thoughts within me, said nothing, viewing my frustrated maneuvers at each dokusan with an amused smile.  Then one day, when I was having a more awkward time than usual trying to prostrate, he suddenly shot at me, "Kapleau-san, when you make prostrations in dokusan you are not bowing down before me but before your own [[Buddha-nature]]."&lt;ref&gt;Kapleau (1989b), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
}}
In [[Zen Buddhism]], both half- and full-prostrations are used.  Zen master [[Robert Baker Aitken|Robert Aitken]] writes:
{{quote|The Zen student is taught that in ''raihai'' [prostration] one throws everything away. Pivoting the forearms on the elbows and raising the hands [palms up] while prostrated is the act of raising the Buddha's feet above one's head.&lt;ref&gt;Aitken (2002). See a similar statement in Aitken (1982), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Roshi [[Philip Kapleau]] writes:
{{quote|The act of unself-conscious prostration before a Buddha is ... possible under the impetus of reverence and gratitude. Such "horizontalizings of the mast of ego"&lt;ref&gt;Here Kapleau is referencing a letter by 14th-century Rinzai Zen master [[Bassui Tokushō]] to a layman: "As for the practice of bowing down before the Buddhas, this is merely a way of horizontalizing the mast of ego in order to realize the Buddha-nature" (Kapleau, 1989a, pp. 182-183).&lt;/ref&gt; cleanse the heart-mind, rendering it flexible and expansive, and open the way to an understanding and appreciation of the exalted mind and manifold virtues of the Buddha and patriarchs. So there arises within us a desire to express our gratitude and show our respect before their personalized forms through appropriate rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Kapleau (1989a), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Zen master [[Huangbo Xiyun|Huang Po]], of the 9th century, is said to have done prostrations so intensely that he wore a permanent red mark on his forehead.&lt;ref&gt;Kapleau (1989b), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vajrayana Buddhism==
[[File:Pilgrims prostrating at Jokhang.JPG|thumb|280px|[[Buddhist pilgrimage|Pilgrims]] prostrating at the [[Jokhang]], [[Lhasa]]]]
In [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], prostrations are often performed before meditation or teachings, but can form a separate practice by itself.  Prostrations are seen as a means of purifying one's [[Three vajra|body, speech and mind]] of [[karma|karmic]] defilements, especially pride.&lt;ref&gt;Tromge (1995), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Prostrations are used in tandem with visualization and can be used to express reverence to [[Guru Rinpoche]]&lt;ref&gt;Tromge (1995), pp. 88-9.&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

For example, in the context of offering homage to Guru Rinpoche, prostrations are to be performed as follows:

{{quote|...Bring your hands together in the 'lotus bud' [[mudra]] (the base of the palm and the fingertips together, and thumbs slightly tucked in) and place them on the crown of the head, then to the throat and heart.  As you place your hands on your crown, you offer homage to Guru Rinpoche's enlightened body, purify defilements and obscurations incurred through the avenue of your body, and establish the potential to realize [[nirmanakaya]].  At your throat, you offer homage to his enlightened speech, and establish the potential to realized [[sambhogakaya]].  Bringing your hands to your heart, you offer homage to his enlightened mind, purify your mind's obscurations, and establish the potential to realize [[dharmakaya]].
The actual prostration is performed by dropping the body forward and stretching it full length on the floor, the arms outstretched in front....  Again, with hands in the lotus bud mudra, bend your arms back and touch your hands to the top of your head, a gesture that acknowledges the blessing flowing from Guru Rinpoche. Then stretch your arms out once more and push yourself up....  Bring your hands into the lotus bud mudra for the third time and touch your heart in a gesture of reverence.  Then, with a smooth motion, bring your hands to your crown and perform the next prostration....&lt;ref&gt;Tromge (1995), pp. 94-5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This type of prostration is often done 3, 7, 21, or 108 times.  A prostration [[Buddhist prayer beads|mala]] can be used to facilitate counting.&lt;ref&gt;Tromge (1995), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of prostration is used with enlightened beings other than Guru Rinpoche as well.

Prostrations done in large numbers (like 100,000) can be part of the [[Ngöndro|preliminary practices]] to the practice of [[tantra]]. Other practices like this can be reciting the [[Refuge (Buddhism)|Refuge]] prayer, [[mandala]] offerings, [[Vajrasattva]] mantras and other practices called [[ngöndro]].

The '''''Protestant Telegraph''''' was a [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] newspaper founded by [[Noel Doherty]] and [[Ian Paisley]] on 13 February 1966. It was noted for its [[Fundamentalist Christianity|Protestant fundamentalism]] and its attacks on the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Church of Ireland]] and the moderates within the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], as typified by [[Terence O'Neill]].&lt;ref&gt;D.J. Hickey &amp; J.E. Doherty, ''A New Dictionary of Irish History from 1800'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 2003, p. 408&lt;/ref&gt;

It was criticised by Prime Minister [[James Chichester-Clark]]:
{{cquote|In the ''Protestant Telegraph'' in terms of abuse and in terms of ridicule, in terms of language which I can only describe as disgusting, perhaps at times the hon. Gentleman has given equal treatment. He has given equal treatment of a kind which has been accorded not only to the religion of the minority but, as I have said, to most of those who have been working and striving for peace over the years in Northern Ireland, no matter what religion they belong to.|author=James Chichester-Clark, ''[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1970/jul/03/home-affairs HOME AFFAIRS]'', [[Hansard#In the United Kingdom|Hansard]], 3 July 1970}}

The paper was printed by the Puritan Printing Company, which was based at the Ravenhill Road, [[Belfast]], headquarters of the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Moloney &amp; A. Pollak, ''Paisley'', Dublin: Poolbeg, 1994, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; The paper continued as a vehicle for Paisley and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (which was formed in 1971) until 1982 when [[Peter Robinson (Northern Ireland politician)|Peter Robinson]], who felt that the party would benefit from a less religiously denominational paper, persuaded Ian Paisley to wind up the ''Protestant Telegraph'' and replace it with ''[[The Voice of Ulster]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Moloney &amp; Pollak, ''Paisley'', pp. 294–5&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ramaiya''' are a [[caste]] found in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in [[India]].&lt;ref name="A Hasan pages 336"&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII  Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pages 336 to 339&lt;/ref&gt; Many members of this community migrated to [[Pakistan]] in 1947 and have settled in [[Karachi]] and [[Sindh]].

==History and origin==

The Ramaiya are a community that are partly [[Sikh]], and partly [[Muslim]]. They get their name from the [[Hindi]] word ''ramna'', which means to wonder. The community acquired this name on account of the fact that they were salesman, and are said to have belonged to the [[Bhatra]] community, a well known Sikh caste of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]]. Like the Bhatra, they are said to be [[Kshatriya]]s. They migrated into [[Uttar Pradesh]] in the 17th and 18th Century. The community were originally Sikh, and said to have come from [[Amritsar]]. However long residence in [[Uttar Pradesh]] has meant that Ramaiya are more properly [[Nanakshahi]], rather than Sikh. A significant number of Ramaiya in the [[Rohilkhand]] region have converted to [[Islam]]. The Nanakshahi are sub-divided into a number of exogamous clans, known as [[gotra]]s. Their main gotras are the Bamra, Bank, Barsari, Bhat, Bhatti, Bisati, Dargal, Gajra, Gaur, Gujjar, Hardoiri, Nomain, Radi, Rai, Ranipari, Rathore, Sinha and Sipmatua. While the [[Muslim]] branch consists of the following divisions, the Banjara, Rajput and Ramai.&lt;ref&gt;Tribes and castes of Northwestern Provinces and Oudh by William Crooke&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present circumstances ==

The community were traditionally salesman and village shop keepers. Many are now successful businessmen. They are found mainly in western [[Uttar Pradesh]] in the districts of [[Saharanpur District|Saharanpur]], [[Bijnor District|Bijnor]], [[Moradabad District|Moradabad]] and [[Jyotiba Phule Nagar]]. Their main settlements in [[Bijnor District]] are Nurpur, Rohunagli, Nahilpur and Hasupur. In [[Saharanpur District]], their main settlement is Chilkhana. Like other [[North India]]n [[Hindu]] communities, they maintain strict clan exogamy. While the [[Muslim]] section prefers marrying close kin, and practice both parallel cousin and cross cousin marriages. Many [[Nanakshahi]] Ramaiya are now orthodox [[Hindu]].

The '''religion of [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]]''' in [[North Africa]] was a direct continuation of the [[Phoenicia]]n variety of the [[polytheism|polytheistic]] [[ancient Canaanite religion]] with significant local modifications. Controversy prevails regarding the possible existence and practice of propitiatory [[child sacrifice]] in the religion of Carthage. However, a recent study of archeological evidence confirms this ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Carthaginians sacrificed own children, archaeologists say https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jan/21/carthaginians-sacrificed-own-children-study accessed 4 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pantheon==
[[File:Karthago Tophet.JPG|thumb|180px|right|Stele from the Tophet of Salammbó showing a [[Tanit]] symbol]]

===Phoenician origins===
{{Refimprove|date = July 2011}}
Carthage derived the original core of its religion from Phoenicia. The Phoenician pantheon was presided over by the father of the gods, but a goddess was the principal figure in the Phoenician pantheon. The system of gods and goddesses in Phoenician religion also influenced many other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Carthaginian_Religion/|title=Carthaginian Religion|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The supreme divine couple was that of [[Tanit]] and [[Baal Hammon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tanit|title=Tanit {{!}} ancient deity|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goddess [[Astarte]] seems to have been popular in early times. At the height of its cosmopolitan era, Carthage seems to have hosted a large array of divinities from the neighbouring civilizations of [[ancient Rome]], 
[[ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Egypt]] and the [[Etruscan civilization]].

==Caste of priests and acolytes==
Surviving Punic texts portray an organized caste of temple priests and acolytes performing different types of functions for a variety of prices. Priests were cleanshaven, unlike most other people. In the first centuries of the city, ritual celebrations included rhythmic dancing, derived from Phoenician traditions.

==Punic stelae==
[[Cippi]] and [[stele]]s of limestone are characteristic monuments of the art and religion of the [[Punics]] and are found throughout the western Phoenician colonial world in unbroken continuity, both historically and geographically. The majority were set up over [[urn]]s containing the ashes of sacrifices which had been placed within [[shrine|open-air sanctuaries]]. Some Carthaginian votive steles (several in Egyptian style) display a priest carrying a child; at least one has been interpreted as a living child for sacrifice. The identification of this child as living has been questioned.

==Animal sacrifice==

One of the most important stelae is the Marseilles Tariff, found in the port of [[Marseille]] but originally from the temple of [[Hadad|Baal-Saphon]] in [[Carthage]]. The [[tariff]] regulated the payments to the priests for performing sacrifices and described the nature of the victims.&lt;ref&gt;Perdue, Leo (2001). ''The Blackwell Companion to the Hebrew Bible''. Wiley-Blackwell, p. 157. {{ISBN|0-631-21071-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; All victims are male animals, and females are not mentioned. [[Porphyry (philosopher)]], De Abst. 2.11, states that the Phoenicians did not sacrifice or eat females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Houston|first=Walter|title=Purity and Monotheism: Clean and Unclean Animals in Biblical Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T2l8InRl6dwC&amp;pg=PA152|year=1993|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-0-567-07190-3}}, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child sacrifice==
Most archaeologists supposed that infant sacrifices occurred. [[Lawrence Stager|Lawrence E. Stager]], who directed the excavations of the Carthage Tophet in the 1970s, initially believed that infant sacrifice was practiced there, and his early opinion influenced later historians. [[Paolo Xella]] of the National Research Council in Rome summarized the textual, epigraphical, and archaeological evidence  for Carthaginian infant sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Paolo Xella, Josephine Quinn, Valentina Melchiorri and [[Peter van Dommelen]]. Phoenician bones of contention. Volume: 87  Number: 338  Page: 1199–1207.  http://antiquity.ac.uk/ant/087/ant0871199.htm accessed 17 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern scholars - and currently Lawrence E. Stager himself{{Verify source|date=February 2018}} - argue that evidence of Carthaginian child sacrifice is sketchy at best and that these reports are more likely to have been a Roman libel against the Carthaginians to justify their conquest and destruction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/ancient-cultures/daily-life-and-practice/at-carthage-child-sacrifice/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary accounts===
Accounts of child sacrifice in the Hebrew Bible have been compared with similar ones from Greek and Latin sources, speaking of the offering of children by fire as sacrifices in the city of [[Carthage]]. [[Plutarch]] (c. 46–120 CE) mentions the practice, as do [[Tertullian]], [[Orosius]], [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Philo]]. However, [[Livy]] and [[Polybius]] do not. Diodorus (c. 90-60 BCE) states:{{quote|In former times they (the Carthaginians) had been accustomed to sacrifice to this god the noblest of their sons, but more recently, secretly buying and nurturing children, they had sent these to the sacrifice.&lt;ref name=Siculus&gt;Diodorus Siculus. Library XX, xiv&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Tertullian]], about 200 CE, states that although the priests who sacrificed children had been [[crucifixion|crucified]] by a [[Procurator (Roman)|Roman procurator]], "that holy crime persists in secret".&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, Apologeticus [[de spectaculis]] IX, https://archive.org/stream/apologydespectac00tertuoft#page/46/mode/2up accessed 18 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cleitarchus]], Diodorus Siculus and [[Plutarch]] all mention burning of children as an offering to [[Cronus]] or [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], that is to Bal Ammūn, the chief god of Carthage. According to [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], the Carthaginians accepted the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]]'s instructions to stop sacrificing children (and eating dogs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marcus Junianus Justinus|title=Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus.|url=http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/english/trans19.html#1|work=FORUM ROMANUM|publisher=Henry G. Bohn|accessdate=18 April 2014|quote=During the course of these transactions, ambassadors came to Carthage from Darius king of Persia, bringing an edict, by which the Carthaginians were forbidden to offer human sacrifices, or to eat dog’s flesh, and were commanded to burn the bodies of the dead rather than bury them in the earth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these sources suggest that babies were roasted to death on a heated bronze statue. According to Diodorus Siculus, "There was in their city a bronze image of Cronus extending its hands, palms up and sloping toward the ground, so that each of the children when placed thereon rolled down and fell into a sort of gaping pit filled with fire."&lt;ref name=Siculus /&gt; They placed their children alive in the arms of a bronze statue of the lady Tanit:
{{quote|The hands of the statue extended over a brazier into which the child fell once the flames had caused the limbs to contract and its mouth to open...&amp;nbsp;. The child was alive and conscious when burned... [[Philo]] specified that the sacrificed child was best-loved.{{sfn|Brown|1991|p= 22–23}}}}

According to Stager and Wolff, there is a consensus among scholars that Carthaginian children were sacrificed by their parents, who would make a vow to kill the next child if the gods would grant them a favor: for instance, their shipment of goods were to arrive safely in a foreign port.&lt;ref name=control&gt;{{cite journal |last = Stager |first = Lawrence |author2=Samuel. R. Wolff |title = Child sacrifice in Carthage: religious rite or population control? |journal = Journal of Biblical Archeological Review |volume = January |pages = 31–46 |year = 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some historians have disputed that child sacrifice occurred,{{sfn|Fantar|2000|p=28-31}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05146/510878.stm Carthage tries to live down image as site of infanticide]&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting instead that the [[tophet]]s were resting places for the cremated remains of children that died naturally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GUfAW0dEcrQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Phoenicians&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=child%20sacrifice&amp;f=false The Phoenicians. Elsa Marston. p55]&lt;/ref&gt; Sergio Ribichini has argued that the Tophet was "a child necropolis designed to receive the remains of infants who had died prematurely of sickness or other natural causes, and who for this reason were "offered" to specific deities and buried in a place different from the one reserved for the ordinary dead".&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Ribichini, "Beliefs and Religious Life" in Moscati, Sabatino (ed), ''The Phoenicians'', 1988, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; The few Carthaginian texts which have survived make no mention of child sacrifice (very few mention religion at all).{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Child sacrifice may also have been overemphasized for effect; after the Romans finally defeated Carthage and totally destroyed the city, they engaged in postwar propaganda to make their archenemies seem cruel and less civilized.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Schwartz, F.D. Houghton, L. Bondioli and R. Macchiarelli. Volume: 86 Number: 333 Page: 738-745 http://antiquity.ac.uk/ant/086/ant0860738.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeological evidence===
[[File:Tunisise Carthage Tophet Salambo 02.JPG|thumb|250px|Stelae in the Tophet of Salammbó covered by a vault built in the Roman period]]

"Tophet" is a term derived from the Bible, used to refer to a [[Tophet|site near Jerusalem]] in which Canaanites and Israelites sacrificed children. It is now used as a general term for all such sites with cremated human and animal remains. The [[Hebrew Bible]] does not specify that the Israelite victims were buried, only burned although the "place of burning" was probably adjacent to the place of burial. It is not at all known how the Phoenicians themselves referred to the places of burning or burial or to the practice itself.

Several apparent "Tophets" have been identified, chiefly a large one in [[Carthage]], dubbed the "Tophet of [[Salammbô]]" after the neighbourhood where it was unearthed in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Briand-Ponsart, Claude and Crogiez, Sylvie (2002). ''L'Afrique du nord antique et médievale: mémoire, identité et imaginaire''. Publication Univ Rouen Havre, p. 13. {{ISBN|2-87775-325-5}}. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil in the Tophet of Salammbó was found to be full of olive wood charcoal, probably from the sacrificial pyres. It was the location of the temple of the goddess Tanit and the necropolis. Animal remains, mostly sheep and goats, found inside some of the Tophet urns strongly suggest that this was not a burial ground for children who died prematurely. The animals were sacrificed to the gods, presumably in place of children (one surviving inscription refers to the animal as "a substitute"). It is conjectured that the children unlucky enough not to have substitutes were also sacrificed and then buried in the Tophet. The remains include the bodies of both very young children and small animals, and those who argue in favor of child sacrifice have argued that if the animals were sacrificed, then so too were the children.&lt;ref name="plosone.org"&gt;Skeletal Remains from Punic Carthage Do Not Support Systematic Sacrifice of Infants http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0009177&lt;/ref&gt; The area covered by the Tophet in Carthage was probably over an acre and a half by the fourth century BCE,{{sfn|Stager|1980|p=3}} with nine different levels of burials. About 20,000 urns were deposited between 400 BCE and 200 BCE,{{sfn|Stager|1980|p=3}} with the practice continuing until the early years of the Christian period. The urns contained the charred bones of newborns and in some cases the bones of fetuses and 2-year-olds. These double remains have been interpreted to mean that in the cases of stillborn babies, the parents would sacrifice their youngest child.{{sfn|Stager|1980|p=6}}

There is a clear correlation between the frequency of deposition of child remains and the well-being of the city.{{Elucidate|date=December 2014}} In bad times (war, poor harvests) sacrifices may have become more frequent, indicating an increased assiduousness in seeking divine appeasement or possibly a population-controlling response to the reduction of available food&lt;ref name=control/&gt; or perhaps increased child mortality from famine or disease.

A detailed breakdown of the age of the buried children includes pre-natal individuals, stillbirths. It is also argued that the age distribution of remains at this site is consistent with the burial of children who died of natural causes, shortly before or after birth.&lt;ref name="plosone.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey H. Schwartz, Frank Houghton, Roberto Macchiarelli, Luca Bondioli. Skeletal Remains from Punic Carthage Do Not Support Systematic Sacrifice of Infants. PLOS One. Published: 17 February 2010. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0009177 http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0009177 accessed 23 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Sergio Ribichini has argued that the Tophet was "a child necropolis designed to receive the remains of infants who had died prematurely of sickness or other natural causes, and who for this reason were "offered" to specific deities and buried in a place different from the one reserved for the ordinary dead". He adds that this was probably part of "an effort to ensure the benevolent protection of the same deities for the survivors."{{sfn|Ribichini |1988|p=141}} However, that analysis is disputed; Patricia Smith and colleagues from the [[Hebrew University]] and [[Harvard University]] show from the teeth and skeletal analysis at the Carthage Tophet that infant ages at death (about two months) do not correlate with the expected ages of natural mortality (perinatal).&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Smith, Lawrence E. Stager, Joseph A. Greene and Gal Avishai. Archaeology. Volume: 87 Number: 338 Page: 1191–1199. Age estimations attest to infant sacrifice at the Carthage Tophet. http://antiquity.ac.uk/ant/087/ant0871191.htm accessed 23 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Sites within Carthage and other [[Phoenicia]]n centres such as [[Motya]], near [[Sicily]], revealed the remains of male children under the age of five. There was no evidence of disease in the bones that survived cremation. Tophets have been also found in Sardinia at Sulci, Nora, Monte Sirai, Tharros and Bithia.

In [[Nauru]], [[Nauru Congregational Church]] is the largest religion, encompassing 35.71% of the population, as of the 2011 census.

According to the 2002 census, approximately two-thirds of Christians are [[Protestant]], and the remainder are [[Catholic]].&lt;ref name=report&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90147.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007: Nauru]. United States [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor]] (September 14, 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; The largest denomination is the [[Nauru Congregational Church]]. The ethnic Chinese on the island, approximately 3 to 4 percent of the population, may be [[Confucian]], [[Buddhist]], [[Taoist]], [[Christian]], or [[nonreligious]].&lt;ref name=report/&gt; The largely Christian communities of Tuvaluan and I-Kiribati expatriates were repatriated in late 2006 following the near cessation of phosphate mining in the country.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; The [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and the [[Mormons]] said they had small numbers of followers among the native population.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

[[File:Nauru missionary 1916-17.jpg|thumb|left|A welcome ceremony for a missionary, 1916-17]]
[[Nauruan indigenous religion]] was the predominant religion in Nauru before the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when foreign [[missionaries]] introduced Christianity to the island.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; There are a few active Christian missionary organisations, including representatives of [[Anglicanism]], [[Methodism]], and [[Catholicism]].&lt;ref name=report/&gt; The Constitution provides for [[freedom of religion]]; however, the Government restricted this right in some circumstances.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; There are no indications of widespread societal discrimination against particular religious denominations; however, some elements of the Nauru Protestant and Roman Catholic communities occasionally voice discomfort with religious groups perceived as foreign, in particular [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

According to data from Pew Research, the religions of [[Hinduism]], [[Judaism]], and [[Islam]] had a small presence in the island, with about 
0.1% of the population (fewer than ten people), adhering to each faith. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.humantruth.info/nauru.html &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:North America Religious Belief.svg|thumb|right|250px|Religious Belief in North America, according to 2010-2012 data]]

'''[[Religion]] in [[North America]]''' spans the period of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] dwelling, [[European ethnic groups|European]] settlement, and the present day. Its various faiths have been a major influence on [[art]], [[culture]], [[philosophy]] and [[law]].

Between them, the [[United States]], [[Mexico]] and [[Canada]] account for 85 percent of the population of North America. Religion in each of these countries is dominated by [[Christianity]] (77.4),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ANALYSIS|url=http://www.pewforum.org/Christian/Global-Christianity-americas.aspx |title=Americas |publisher=Pewforum.org |date=2011-12-19 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ANALYSIS |url=http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape-christians.aspx |title=Global religious landscape: Christians |publisher=Pewforum.org |date=2011-12-19 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the largest religion in North America.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3057">The '''Royal Tomb of Akhenaten''' is the burial place of the [[Akhenaten|Pharaoh Akhenaten]], in the [[Royal Wadi and tombs|Royal Wadi]] in [[Amarna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/amarna/royaltomb.html | title=Amarna Royal Tomb | accessdate=2006-12-19 | publisher = [[University College London|UCL]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout==
A flight of twenty steps, with a central inclined plane leads to the door and a long straight descending corridor. Halfway down this corridor a suite of unfinished rooms (perhaps intended for [[Nefertiti]]). The main corridor continues to descend, and to the right again a second suite of rooms branches off.

The corridor then descends via steps into an ante-room, and then to the pillared burial chamber where his granite [[sarcophagus]] sat in a slight dip in the floor. It was decorated by carvings of Nefertiti acting as a protective goddess, and by the ever-present sun-disks of the [[Aten]].

==Decoration==
[[Image:Dibujo de tumba.jpg|thumb|255px|Scene from the tomb]]
The second suite of three chambers (referred to as Alpha, Beta and Gamma) are believed to be used for the burial of [[Meketaten]], [[Akhenaten]]'s second daughter. Two of the chambers (Alpha and Gamma) are decorated and depict very similar scenes: in the Alpha chamber Akhenaten and [[Nefertiti]] bend over the inert body of a woman, weeping and gripping each other's arms for support. Nearby a nurse stands with a baby in her arms, accompanied by a fan-bearer, which indicates the baby's royal status. The names in the scene have been hacked out. In the Gamma chamber a very similar scene is shown; here the hieroglyphs identify the dead young woman as Meketaten. In the same chamber another scene shows Meketaten standing under a canopy which is usually associated with childbirth but can also interpreted as representing the rebirth of the princess. In front of her, amongst courtiers, stand Akhenaten, Nefertiti and their three remaining daughters, [[Meritaten]], [[Ankhesenpaaten]] and [[Neferneferuaten Tasherit]]. The presence of a royal baby causes many to believe the young princess died in childbirth (in this case the father is most likely to have been Akhenaten himself, marrying his daughter), but it cannot be proven.

Large amounts of the decoration have been destroyed by flooding.

==After burial==
[[Image:Sarcophage Akhénaton.JPG|thumb|300 px|Reconstructed sarcophagus]]
His body was probably removed after the court returned to [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], and reburied somewhere in the [[Valley of the Kings]], possibly in [[KV55]]. His sarcophagus was destroyed, but has since been reconstructed &amp;mdash; and now sits in the garden of the [[Egyptian Museum]].

==Excavation and preservation==
The tomb was excavated by [[Alessandro Barsanti]], in 1893/1894.

'''Sanctification''' is the act or process of acquiring sanctity, of being made or becoming [[holy]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed.Sanctify: to make (a person) holy, to purify or free from sin.{{full citation needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=December 2016}} It is a gift given through the power of God to a person or thing which is then considered [[sacred]] or set apart in an official capacity within the religion. In general anything from a [[temple]], to vessels, to days of the week, to a [[human]] [[belief|believer]] who willingly accepts this gift can be sanctified.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} To sanctify is to literally "set apart for particular use in a special purpose or work and to make holy or sacred."{{cite quote|date=December 2016}}  [[Etymology|Etymologically]], "sanctify" derives from the [[Latin Language|Latin]] [[verb]] ''[[wiktionary:sanctificare|sanctificare]]'' which in turn derives from ''[[sanctus]]'' "holy" and ''[[wiktionary:facere|facere]]'' "to make".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Christianity==
{{expert needed | Christianity | ex2 = Christian theology | reason = theological superficiality of the section, failing to recognize deeper commonalities and differences that would lead to different groupings than appear, including but not limited to the admixture of Protestant and non-Protestant faiths (through the alphabetical listing), and the presentation of some Arminian understandings separate from others|date=December 2016}}
In the various branches of [[Christianity]] sanctification usually refers to a ''person'' becoming holy, with the details differing in different branches.

===Anglicanism===
A 2002 Anglican publishing house book states that “there is no explicit teaching on sanctification in the Anglican formularies”.&lt;ref&gt;Owen C. Thomas, [[Ellen K. Wondra]], ''Introduction to Theology'', 3rd ed (Church Publishing, 2002), 222.&lt;/ref&gt; A glossary of the Episcopal Church (USA) gives some teaching: “Anglican formularies have tended to speak of sanctification as the process of God's work within us by means of which we grow into the fullness of the redeemed life.”&lt;ref&gt;Don S. Armentrout and Robert Boak Slocum, eds, ''An Episcopal Dictionary of the Church'' (Church Publishing, 2000), s. v. "Sanctification", 467. Online at http://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/glossary/sanctification-0&lt;/ref&gt; Outside official formularies sanctification has been an issue in the Anglican Communion since its inception.

The 16th  century Anglican Theologian [[Richard Hooker]] (1554-1600) distinguished between the “righteousness of justification” that is imputed by God and the “righteousness of sanctification” that comprises the works one does as an “inevitable” result of being justified.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, Lee W. "Richard Hooker's Via Media Doctrine of Justification" in ''The Harvard Theological Review'' 74, no. 2 (1981): 211-220. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1509447 (accessed June 10, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeremy Taylor]] (1613-1667) argued that justification and sanctification cannot be separated; they are “two steps in a long process”.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph McMichael, ed, ''The Vocation of Anglican Theology: Sources and Essays'' (SCM, 2014), 214-215.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 19th century Church of England work agreed with Jeremy Taylor that justification and sanctification are “inseparable”. However, they are not the same thing. Justification is “found in Christ’s work alone”. “Sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit in us, and is a progressive work.”&lt;ref&gt;''An Explanation of the Articles of the Church of England, Part 1'' (Church of England, 1843), 53. Online at https://books.google.com/books?id=yTJWAAAAcAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calvinism===
[[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] theologians interpret sanctification as the process of being made holy only through the merits and justification of Jesus Christ through the work of the Holy Spirit that are then reflected in man. Sanctification cannot be attained by any works-based process, but only through the works and power of the divine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dane says: |url=http://learntheology.com/sanctification-calvinist.html |title=Sanctification - A Calvinist Viewpoint &amp;#124; Calvinism &amp;#124; Sanctification - A Calvinist Viewpoint |publisher=Learntheology.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a man is unregenerate, it is his essence that sins and does evil. But when a man is justified through Christ, it is no longer the man (in his essence) that sins, but the man is acting outside of his character. In other words, the man is not being himself, he is not being true to who he is.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard O. Forde, Donald L. Alexander, Sinclair B. Ferguson: "Christian spirituality: five views of sanctification", InterVarsity Press, 1988. p. 47-76&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
&lt;!--[[File:Автомобиль освятили в православной церкви - Донор.jpg|thumb|160px|A car blessed by a priest of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].]]  REMOVED, BECAUSE BLESSING OF CAR IS INEXPLICABLE, AS NOT MENTIONED OR TIED TO EXT IN ANY FASHION.--&gt;
[[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox Christianity]] teaches the doctrine of [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]], whereby humans take on divine properties. A key [[scripture]] supporting this is [[wikisource:2 Peter|2 Peter 1:4]].

===Lutheranism===
[[File:Pietism.JPG|thumb|upright|Pietistic Lutheran frugality, humility, restraint, sense of duty and order have been strong cultural and religious influences in Scandinavia.]]
[[Martin Luther]], the founder of [[Lutheranism]], taught in his [[Large Catechism]] that Sanctification is only caused by the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] through the powerful [[Bible|Word of God]]. The Holy Spirit uses [[local church|churches]] to gather [[Christian]]s together for the teaching and [[preaching]] of the Word of God.&lt;ref&gt;Lutheran Dogmaticians consider this the broad sense of sanctification. See [http://www.bookofconcord.org/largecatechism/4_creed.html Luther's Large Catechism], the Apostle's Creed, paragraph 53 and following&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Sanctification is the [[Holy Spirit]]'s work of making us holy. When the Holy Spirit creates [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] in us, he renews in us the image of God so that through his power we produce [[good works]]. These good works are not meritorious but show the faith in our hearts (Ephesians 2:8-10, James 2:18).  Sanctification flows from [[Justification (theology)|justification]].  It is an on-going process which will not be [[Entire sanctification|complete or reach perfection]] in this life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080102112002/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=45&amp;cuItem_itemID=12095 WELS Topical Q&amp;A: Sanctification and Justification], by Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Pietism|Pietistic Lutheranism]] heavily emphasizes the "biblical divine commands of believers to live a holy life and to strive for holy living, or sanctification."&lt;ref name="Granquist2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Granquist|first=Mark A.|title=Scandinavian Pietists: Spiritual Writings from 19th-Century Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland|accessdate=28 September 2018|year=2015|publisher=Paulist Press|language=English|isbn=9781587684982|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodist===
In [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan-Arminian]] theology, which is upheld by the [[World Methodist Council|Methodist Church]] as well as by [[Holiness movement|Holiness Churches]], "sanctification, the beginning of holiness, begins at the [[new birth]]".&lt;ref name="Kettenring2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kettenring|first=Keith|title=The Sanctification Connection|date=15 September 2007|publisher=University Press of America|language=English|isbn=9780761837381|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Grace in Christianity|Grace of God]], Methodists "do [[works of piety]] and [[works of mercy|mercy]], and these works reflect the power of sanctification".&lt;ref name="AbrahamKirby2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abraham|first1=William J.|last2=Kirby|first2=James E.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Methodist Studies|date=24 September 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English|isbn=9780191607431|page=475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these [[means of grace]] (works of piety and works of mercy) that aid with sanctification include frequent reception of the [[sacrament]] of [[Holy Communion]] (work of piety),&lt;ref name="Jr2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jr|first=Charles Yrigoyen|title=T&amp;T Clark Companion to Methodism|date=25 September 2014|publisher=A&amp;C Black|language=English|isbn=9780567290779|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; and visiting the sick and those in prison (work of mercy).&lt;ref name="White2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=James W.|title=Brief Christian Histories: Getting a Sense of Our Long Story|date=17 March 2014|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781556352430|page=99|quote=He espoused a "method" of study, prayer, and community by which persons might know "sanctification" before God.

If the notion of perfection is offensive, it is also biblical: Jesus taught us to "Be perfect, therefore as your heavenly Father is perfect" (Matthew 5:48). And to what perfection can human beings aspire? Methodists have always answered this by repeating the Great Commandment: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind" (Matthew 22:37; cf. Mark 12:30, Luke 10:27). Along with this, Methodists insist that Christian perfection also means the fulfillment of the second Commandment: love of our neighbor. Thus, Christian perfection or entire sanctification denotes primarily the perfection of our love for God and for our neighbor.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[John Wesley]], the progenitor of the Methodist faith, described as a heart "habitually filled with the love of God and neighbor" and as "having the mind of Christ and walking as he walked".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?mid=1813 |title=Distinctive Wesleyan Emphases (Page 2) |publisher=Archives.umc.org |date=2006-11-06 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the doctrine that by the power of God's sanctifying grace and attention upon the [[Means of Grace|means of grace]] may cleanse a Christian of the corrupting influence of [[original sin]] in this life. It is expounded upon in the Methodist [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]]:&lt;ref name=MethodistArticles&gt;[http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/the-articles-of-religion-of-the-methodist-church The United Methodist Church: The Articles of Religion of the Methodist Church - Of Sanctification]&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quotation|Sanctification is that renewal of our fallen nature by the Holy Ghost, received through faith in Jesus Christ, whose blood of atonement cleanseth from all sin; whereby we are not only delivered from the guilt of sin, but are washed from its pollution, saved from its power, and are enabled, through grace, to love God with all our hearts and to walk in his holy commandments blameless.&lt;ref name=MethodistArticles/&gt;}}
[[Justification (theology)|Justification]] is seen as an initial step of acknowledging God's holiness, with sanctification as, through the grace and power of God, entering into it.  A key scripture is Hebrews 12:14:  "Follow after...holiness, without which no one shall see the Lord." The [[Wesleyan Church]] (formerly known as the Wesleyan Methodist Church) states that sanctification has three components—initial, progressive, and entire:&lt;ref name="TWC2017"/&gt;
{{quotation|We believe that sanctification is that work of the Holy Spirit by which the child of God is separated from sin unto God and is enabled to love God with all the heart and to walk in all His holy commandments blameless. Sanctification is initiated at the moment of justification and regeneration. From that moment there is a gradual or progressive sanctification as the believer walks with God and daily grows in grace and in a more perfect obedience to God. This prepares for the crisis of entire sanctification which is wrought instantaneously when believers present themselves as living sacrifices, holy and acceptable to God, through faith in Jesus Christ, being effected by the [[baptism with the Holy Spirit]] who cleanses the heart from all inbred sin. The crisis of [[entire sanctification]] perfects the believer in love and empowers that person for effective service. It is followed by lifelong growth in grace and the knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. The life of holiness continues through faith in the sanctifying blood of Christ and evidences itself by loving obedience to God’s revealed will.&lt;ref name="TWC2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wesleyan.org/about/articles-of-religion|title=Articles of Religion: The Wesleyan Church|year=2017|publisher=The Wesleyan Church|language=English|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
John Wesley taught that [[outward holiness]] in the form of "right words and right actions" should reflect the inner transformation experienced through the [[second work of grace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seedbed.com/getting-it-right-christian-perfection-and-wesleys-purposeful-list|title=Getting It Right: Christian Perfection and Wesley's Purposeful List|last=Headley|first=Anthony J.|date=4 October 2013|publisher=Seedbed|language=English|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Catholicism===
The Catholic Church upholds the doctrine of sanctification, teaching that:&lt;ref name="SMOM2011"/&gt;
{{quotation|Sanctifying grace is that grace which confers on our souls a new life, that is, sharing in the life of God. Our reconciliation with God, which the redemption of Christ has merited for us, finds its accomplishments in sanctifying grace. Through this most precious gift we participate in the divine life; we have the right to be called children of God. This grace is the source of all our supernatural merits and bestows upon us the right of eternal glory.&lt;ref name="SMOM2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fitzgerald |first=Maurus |title=Order of Malta Catholic Book of Prayers |year=2011|publisher=Catholic Book Publishing Corp.|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' "sanctity"&lt;ref&gt;[http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Sanctity ''Catholic Encyclopedia'': Sanctity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105232613/http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Sanctity |date=2011-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; differs for God, individual, and [[corporate body]]. For God, it is God's unique [[absolution|absolute]] [[morality|moral]] [[perfection]]. For the individual, it is a close union with God and the resulting moral perfection. It is essentially of God, by a divine [[gift]]. For a society, it is the ability to produce and secure holiness in its members, who display a real, not merely nominal, holiness. The Church's holiness is beyond human power, [[supernatural|beyond natural]] power.

Sanctity is regulated by established conventional standards.

===Other Christian denominations and movements===
Beliefs about sanctification vary amongst the [[Christian denomination]]s and movements, influenced by various Christian movements. These beliefs differ from each other on:  whether sanctification is a definitive experience or process, when the process/experience takes place, and if entire sanctification is possible in this life.

Influenced by the [[Holiness movement]] some Pentecostal churches, such as the [[Church of God in Christ]] and the [[Apostolic Faith Church]], believe that sanctification is a definitive act of God's grace and spiritual experience whereby we are made holy subsequent to salvation and prior to the baptism of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cogic.net/cogiccms/default/cogic-history/what-we-believe/ |title=What we believe|author=Church of God in Christ|accessdate=February 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apostolicfaith.org/OurFaith/Doctrines.aspx/|title=Our Faith - Doctrines|author=Apostolic Faith Church|accessdate=May 24, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513044028/http://www.apostolicfaith.org/OurFaith/Doctrines.aspx|archivedate=May 13, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sullivan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/fiveview.htm#Ref38|title=Five Views on Sanctification: An In-Depth Analysis|author=Mike Sullivan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reformed Churches are amongst denominations that teach about definitive sanctification at the time of conversion, and believers are required to "do good works" which are "… all sanctified by (God’s) grace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crcna.org/pages/belgic_articles17_24.cfm |title=The Belgic Confession|author=Christian Reformed Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, non-Wesleyan Pentecostals such as [[Assemblies of God]] teach about definitive sanctification at the time of conversion and progressive sanctification after conversion. Converted believers are expected to "make every effort to live a holy life… Even though Christians may not attain absolute perfection in this life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ag.org/top/beliefs/topics/gendoct_05_sanctification.cfm|title=Sanctification &amp; Holiness|author=Assemblies of God USA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619012214/http://ag.org/top/Beliefs/topics/gendoct_05_sanctification.cfm|archivedate=2010-06-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event of entire sanctification occurs when Christ comes back and gives us glorified bodies.&lt;ref name="sullivan" /&gt;

[[Higher Life movement]] and [[Brunstad Christian Church]] believe that sinless perfection is attainable in Christian life. Higher Life movement teaches that even though believers still have an inclination to sin after conversion, they must constantly rely on the Holy Spirit to struggle against this tendency, and therefore can attain sinless perfection in this life.&lt;ref&gt;J. Robertson McQuilkin, "The Keswick Perspective," In Five Views on Sanctification (Grand Rapids: Academic Books, 1987), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the movement proclaims that "the secret of complete victory is faith: simply believing that Jesus has done and is doing all".&lt;ref&gt;Charles G. Trumbull, Victory in Christ (Fort Washington: Christian Literature Crusade, 1959), 84, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, Brunstad Christian Church teaches that because Jesus, as a man, was tempted in all points as other human beings, yet never committed sin, he opened a way back to God, and therefore those who want to be disciples can follow on that same way. They proclaim that this means a Christian does not only receive the forgiveness of sins, but can also conquer all sinful tendencies in their own human nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brunstad.org/en/About-us/Our-faith/#Helliggjorelse|title=Our Faith|author=Brunstad Christian Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
{{primary sources | section|date=December 2016}}
{{original research|date=December 2016}}
In [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) sanctification is a process and gift from God which makes every willing member holy, according to their repentance and righteous efforts, through the Savior Jesus Christ's matchless grace. To become Sanctified, or Holy, one must do all that he can to live as Christ lived, according to the teachings of Christ. One must strive to live a holy life to truly be considered Holy.&lt;ref&gt;See D. Todd Christofferson, "Justification and Sanctification," [https://www.lds.org/ensign/2001/06/justification-and-sanctification?lang=eng Ensign, June 2006]; C. Eric Ott, "Sanctification," [http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Sanctification Encyclopedia of Mormonism].&lt;/ref&gt; In the scriptural canon of the LDS Church, one reference to sanctification appears in [[Helaman]] 3:35, in the [[Book of Mormon]]:{{quote|Nevertheless they did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the purifying and the sanctification of their hearts, which sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts unto God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Helaman 3:35|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/3.35?lang=eng#34|work=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc.|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Dallin H.

[[File:Tel Shimron (6).jpg|thumbnail|Tel Shimron]]
'''Shimron''' ({{lang-he|שמרון}}) is a nature reserve in Northern Israel.

'''Shimron''' was the name  of a major city in the north of  Israel in early antiquity. It is mentioned in the Bible by this name, and in other period sources as '''Shim'on'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rainey |first=Anson |title= Review by: Anson F. Rainey|journal= Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume= 118|issue= 1 |pages= 73 |jstor= 606301 |date=1998|registration=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late antiquity, it was known by the name '''Simonias''' ({{Lang-he-n|סימונייה}}).&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Talmud, ''Megillah'' 1:1 (2b)&lt;/ref&gt; The city is identified with the [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] called '''Tell Samunia''' in Arabic, also written Samunieh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bibleencyclopedia.com/shimron.htm|title=Shimron|publisher=The Bible Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Maisler (Mazar), ''Qovetz'': Journal of the Jewish Palestinian Exploration Society, 2nd year, volumes 1–4, article: ''Shimron – Simoniah'', Jerusalem 1934–1935, pp. 1–7 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; The tell rises 60 meters above its surroundings, north-east of [[moshav]] [[Nahalal]], on the border between the [[Lower Galilee]], and the [[Jezreel Valley]]. Today the tell in not settled, [[Timrat]] was established alongside, to the east.

==History==

===Bronze Age to Middle Ages===
Shimron was one of the [[Bronze Age]] fortified [[Canaan]]ite cities that controlled the [[Jezreel Valley]], possibly the largest of them. All of these cities were located at an entrance to the valley, and controlled one of the roads leading into it.

In the [[Amarna letters]] and the [[Execration texts]],&lt;ref name="Aharoni1979"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Aharoni|first=Yohanan|authorlink=Yohanan Aharoni|title=The land of the Bible: a historical geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AMtoyNxWw0UC&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=18 October 2010|year=1979|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-24266-4|pages=144–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; the city is referred to as ''Shim'on''. It is also mentioned as one of the cities that were attacked by [[Joshua]] ({{bibleverse||Joshua|12:20|HE}}), and also as belonging to the [[Tribe of Zebulun]] ({{bibleverse||Joshua|19:15|HE}}).

In the [[Hellenistic]] period, there was a large settlement at the foot of the tell, called ''Shimonia'' or ''Samunia''. The city was central during [[First Jewish–Roman War]], and in 66 CE  a battle occurred here between the Jewish rebels and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who besieged the city. [[Josephus]], mentioning the village by name, states that he was attacked there at night by the Roman decurion, Æbutius, who had been entrusted with the charge of the Great Plain and who had one-hundred horse and two-hundred infantry at his disposal. The Roman soldiers, however, were forced to withdraw since their horses were of little use in that terrain ([[The Life of Flavius Josephus|''Life of Flavius Josephus'']], § 24).

The name of the city occurs also elsewhere, in the [[Babylonian Talmud]] ([[Tohorot|Niddah]] 24b), and in the Middle Ages it is mentioned by [[Ishtori Haparchi]] ("Kaftor wa-Feraḥ", ch. xi, written in 1322).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=804&amp;letter=S&amp;search=shimron|title=Simonias|publisher=The Jewish Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial  mounds, traces of ruins, and a sarcophagus have been found here.&lt;ref&gt;Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp01conduoft#page/339/mode/1up 339]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman era===
A map from [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|Napoleon's invasion of 1799]] by [[Pierre Jacotin]] showed a village here, named  ''Sammouni''.&lt;ref&gt;Karmon, 1960, p. [http://www.jchp.ucla.edu/Bibliography/Karmon,_Y_1960_Jacotin_Map_(IEJ_10).pdf 163].&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1838, [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]] found here a small Arab village called ''Semunieh'',&lt;ref&gt;Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, p. [https://archive.org/stream/biblicalresearch03robiuoft#page/n218/mode/1up 201]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, 2nd appendix, p. [https://archive.org/stream/biblicalresearch03robiuoft#page/132/mode/1up 132]&lt;/ref&gt;  and he noted it again in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson and Smith, 1856, p. [https://archive.org/stream/laterbiblicalre01smitgoog#page/n369/mode/1up 320]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, a group of [[Templers (religious believers)|German Templers]] attempted to establish a settlement on the site, which failed due to [[malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp01conduoft#page/355/mode/1up 355]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, [[Victor Guérin]] visited the place and noted:

"The present village has succeeded a small ancient city, now completely destroyed. East of the site which it occupied rises a round isolated hill, which commands the plain in every direction, and was once surrounded on its summit by a wall, of which a few traces still remain. This hill must probably have been fortified. Scarped towards the east, it slopes gently on the western side towards the town, which covered the lower hillocks at its feet. Among them I found, in the midst of the various debris which cover the soil, the remains of a building in cut stone, completely overthrown, once ornamented by columns, as is attested by two mutilated shafts lying on the spot. This edifice seems to have been constructed from east to west, so that it may have been a Christian church.

"In another place I saw an enclosure measuring thirty-five paces in length by twenty-five in breadth. From a distance it appears ancient. It is, however, of modern date, constructed of stones of all sizes and shapes ; among them pillars of broken [[sarcophagi]]".&lt;ref&gt;Guérin, 1880, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/descriptiongogr01unkngoog#page/n397/mode/1up 384]-386; as given in Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp01conduoft#page/339/mode/1up 339]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881, the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]'s ''Survey of Western Palestine'' (SWP)  described it as a small village on a knoll with three springs, having probably less than 100 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="SWPI"&gt;Conder and  Kitchener, 1881,  SWP I, p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp01conduoft#page/280/mode/1up 280]&lt;/ref&gt; A population list from about 1887 showed that  ''Semunieh'' had about  100 inhabitants; all Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, 1888, p. [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme19pale#page/n208/mode/1up  183]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Gottlieb Schumacher]], as part of surveying for the construction of the [[Jezreel Valley railway]], noted in 1900 that the village “had not increased [since the 1881 SWP survey]  due to its unhealthy position and bad water. The proprietor, [[Sursock family|Sursock]], built a number of dwellings covered with tile masonry.”&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, 1900, p.

In 1936, the site became an agricultural training station for the [[Moshavim Movement]]. One group that trained here came from Nahalal, and continued on to establish [[kibbutz]] [[Hanita]].

In 1948, kibbutz [[Timorim]] was established on the site. Timorim became a [[moshav shitufi]] in 1953 and moved to the south of the country, due to lack of farming lands. When it was vacated, it became a [[Ma'abarot|Ma'abara]] (transit camp) for new immigrants destined for [[Migdal Ha'Emek]] and [[Ramat Yishai]].

==Nature reserve==
In 1965, a 28-[[dunam]] nature reserve was declared,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of National Parks and Nature Reserves|url=http://parks.org.il/sigalit/muchrazim.pdf|language=Hebrew|publisher=Israel Nature and Parks Authority|accessdate=2010-10-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007095221/http://parks.org.il/sigalit/muchrazim.pdf|archivedate=2009-10-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; preserving the [[Faidherbia albida|Apple-ring Acacia]] (syn. Acacia albida) trees that grow on the site. This is the northern-most occurrence of these trees in Israel. The Apple-ring Acacia, native to [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], is used for [[nitrogen fixation]], [[erosion control]] for crops, for food, drink and medicine. It sheds its leaves in the rainy season and is highly valued in [[agroforestry]] as it can grow among field crops without shading them.&lt;ref name="ILDIS"&gt;[http://www.ildis.org/LegumeWeb?sciname=Faidherbia+albida ILDIS LegumeWeb]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 he presented at the [[Aspen Ideas Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aspenideas.org/speaker/steven-leder|title=Steven Leder - Aspen Ideas Festival|website=Aspen Ideas Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the Louis Rappaport Award for Excellence in Commentary by the [[American Jewish Press Association]] and the Kovler Award from the [[Religious Action Center]] in Washington, D.C. for his work in African American Jewish dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ejewishphilanthropy.com/jewish-los-angeles-reflections-and-insights|title=Jewish Los Angeles: Reflections and Insights|website=ejewishphilanthropy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wilshire Boulevard Temple - Restoration Project and Social Outreach===
In 2008, Leder began a renovation and expansion project of Wilshire Boulevard Temple's historic Koreatown campus. In 2011, the temple closed for the first phase of the $200 million-dollar restoration and expansion. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/19/us/second-act-for-the-temple-of-the-stars.html|title=Second Act for the Temple of the Stars|first=Adam|last=Nagourney|website=Nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leder initiated and managed the capital fundraising campaign for this project. The historic sanctuary reopened for the [[High Holy Days]] in September 2013. 

The second phase of the campus redevelopment included a 500-car parking structure, a sports complex for students, the renovation of the campus’ two school buildings and the building the Karsh Family Social Service Center at the Temple’s Koreatown Campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://karshcenter.org|title=Home|website=Karshcenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Karsh Center provides free services, including a food pantry, medical, vision, dental and mental health care, along with legal aid, [[ESL]] and book distribution. Additional services offer support groups to assist with loss and trauma. Seasonal outreaches include Build-a-Bike, a daylong event where bikes are assembled for delivery to underserved kids; The Big Give, an annual distribution of Thanksgiving meals; Jews with Tools, a program that provides volunteers to build houses for low-income residents.

The third and final phase of Wilshire Boulevard Temple’s renovation will be the Audrey Irmas Pavilion, an event center designed by [[Rem Koolhaas]]. The Pavilion is scheduled to open in early 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/arts/design/rem-koolhaas-firm-wilshire-boulevard-temple-expansion.html | title=Rem Koolhaas Firm Reveals Design for Los Angeles Temple Expansion| journal=The New York Times| date=2018-03-30| last1=Aridi| first1=Sara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with Evangelicals==
Wilshire Boulevard Temple has a long-standing history of inter-religious collaboration. Nearby evangelical congregations partner with Wilshire Boulevard Temple and conduct joint bible studies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wbtla.org/bibleclasses] {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilshire Boulevard Temple is also home to the largest annual gathering of Muslims and Jews in Los Angeles each year to honor the end of Ramadan. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/11/interfaith-iftar-ramadan_n_5578105.html|title=Interfaith Iftars Bring Muslims And Jews Together During Ramadan|journal=Huffington Post|first=Religion News|last=Service|date=11 July 2014|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Rabbi Leder's books are considered global in their application. Evangelicals and non-religious groups have welcomed Leder to appear as a guest on several Christian TV and radio broadcasts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3679">'''Sulh''' ({{lang-ar|صلح}}) is an [[Arabic]] word meaning "resolution" or "fixing" generally, in problem solving. It is frequently used in the context of social problems.

==Usage==

In Quranic Arabic, sulh is used as a term signifying an agreement or settlement over a property dispute and retains this sense in later Islamic legal usage. In Bedouin customary law, it can signify a settlement of a tribal feud and in modern Arabic usage, it is applied to treaties, such as the ''sulh'' Versailles (Treaty of Versailles).&lt;ref name="Lewis1"&gt;Lewis, (1991), pg 78-80&lt;/ref&gt; In general, it reflects a sense of resolution of conflict through negotiation. The two parties select respected individuals to mediate the conflict, a truce (''[[hudna]]'') is declared, a settlement is reached that maintains the honor and status of both parties, and a public ritual takes place. Particularly important is the fact that the practice affirms bonds between groups and not just individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Taking wrongs seriously: apologies and reconciliation |publisher=Stanford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-xXxCOXlkAC |chapter=Apologies and Reconciliation: Middle Eastern Rituals |year=2006 |last=Irani |first=George Emile}}&lt;/ref&gt; It averts a cycle of revenge.&lt;ref name="Irani"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Holy war, holy peace: how religion can bring peace to the Middle East |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nwyGeM8V1e4C&amp;pg=PT231 |first=Marc |last=Gopin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulh, in its sense of conflict mediation, is still common in rural areas where governmental systems of justice have little force.&lt;ref name="Irani"/&gt;

== In Muslim political thought ==

In the early days of the [[Caliphate|Islamic Empire]], ''sulh'', in the sense of "treaty" or "armistice," typically meant that a region had "surrendered on terms" or similarly during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] retreat it preceded a region's independence. Typically, it signified an area that was ruled and administered by its local political structure but acknowledged itself as a subject through the payment of [[tribute]].&lt;ref name="Lewis1"/&gt;

In the [[Divisions of the world in Islam|Muslim world view on divisions of the world]] the region called the Dar al-'Ahd ({{lang|ar|دار العهد}} "house of truce") or Dar al-Sulh ("house of treaty") or Dar al Hudna (Arabic: "house of calm") was seen as an intermediate to Dar al-Islam ({{lang|ar|دار الإسلام}}, literally house/abode of Islam; or Dar as-Salam, house/abode of Peace) and Dar al-Harb ({{lang|ar|دار الحرب}} "house of war").

Dar al-Sulh, was then seen as non-Muslim territory that had concluded an armistice with Muslims, and had agreed to protect Muslims and their clients and interests within its borders. Often this implied a tributary situation, however modern writings also include friendly countries in Dar al-Sulh. By no means, was this particular division however recognized by all Muslim jurists, and due to historical changes, these concepts have little significance today.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Islam'', Oxford University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-19-512559-2}}, pg 62-62 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6VeCWQfVNjkC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=sulh+islam&amp;lr=&amp;cd=12#v=onepage&amp;q=sulh%20islam&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Katsuragi28shuku dai15ban.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A sutra mound (Katsuragi [[twenty-eight mansions]] - 15th mound)]]
A {{nihongo|'''sutra mound'''|経塚|kyōzuka}} is an [[archaeological site]] where [[sūtra]]s were buried underground. In [[Japanese Buddhism]], it is a type of good deed, and was done as a type of [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]].

== Description ==
In the [[Nara period]], the practice of copying sutras was the center of Buddhism in the country, and was done as a government project. During the [[Heian period]], however, the idea of [[Pure Land Buddhism]] spread, and with it the objective of doing personal prayer. In the middle part of the Heian period, it was predicted that the [[mappō]] age would come into existence, and it was said that this would start in China and Korea.

The [[Lotus Sutra]] was the main sutra that was buried, but the [[Heart Sutra]], [[Amitabha Sutra]], [[Mahavairocana Tantra]], [[Vajrasekhara Sutra]] were also buried. In other locations, the [[Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings]], Kannon sutra, and opening and closing sutras were also found. The sutras were usually copied onto paper, but materials like clay, copper, pebbles and shells were also used. The sutras were stored in metal vessels called {{nihongo|''kyōzutsu''|経筒}}, and inscriptions were written on them.

The sutra tubes were small, but some hexagon-shaped boxes and two-storied pagoda shapes with affixed ornaments were found. The tubes also had caps on them. The tubes were usually made of metal or ceramics, but bamboo and other containers have also been found. The tubes were buried with ancient mirrors, coins, swords and jewels, and were buried with dehumidification substances like charcoal. The sutra tubes were often buried in sacred places such as mountain summits and on the grounds of Shinto temples. Occasionally they were buried underground or above ground, and stone huts were built to enshrine their contents.

== History ==
For Japanese buildings, in 1007, [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]] built the oldest sutra mound at the summit of Kinpusen, a mountain range in [[Yamato Province]]. He did so because there was a sense of impending danger about the coming of [[mappō]] among the aristocracy, and he wanted to prepare for the coming of [[Maitreya]] and ensure that the sutras would be passed along to future generations.

In the middle of the 12th century, a monk who traveled around the country went around handing out copies of the sutras to the masses as a way of improving his spirit and puja.

== Recent times ==
Since they were first buried, the small sutra tubes have decayed, so instead, sutra words have been written on small flat stones. Mounds containing stones where one character has been written on each, and mounds with multiple characters on each stone, became more popular. There are places where the stones were buried and covered up and a memorial stone was placed.

In recent centuries, an increase in agriculture and the permeation of a monetary economy has moved religious actions to the background. Giving copied sutras to temples has become standard as a way to spread knowledge about the sutras.

{{Nihongo|'''Tenri University'''|天理大学|Tenri Daigaku}} is a [[Japan]]ese private university in [[Tenri, Nara|Tenri]], [[Nara Prefecture]], an independent part of the secular mission of the [[new religious movement]] [[Tenrikyo]]. It was established in February 1925 as the [[coeducation]]al {{Nihongo|Tenri Foreign Language School|天理外国語専門学校|Tenri Gaikokugo Senmon Gakkō}}, enrolling 104 students, and was reorganised as a university in April 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tenri-u.ac.jp/ja/object/history.html|script-title=ja:沿革|language=Japanese|publisher=Tenri University|date=2005|accessdate=2007-07-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070818231556/http://www.tenri-u.ac.jp/ja/object/history.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
[[File:Tenri University1.jpg|thumb|Tenri University building]]
===Background===
The Tenri Foreign Language College, the predecessor to Tenri University, was founded by the Tenrikyo Young Men's Association (a subdivision of [[Tenrikyo Church Headquarters]]) under the direction of the second [[Shinbashira]], [[Nakayama Shozen]]. The college was founded to educate Tenrikyo adherents who would engage in missionary work abroad. At the time of its establishment in 1925, Tenri Foreign Language College was the only private foreign language school in Japan.&lt;ref name=tahot1986&gt;Tenrikyo Overseas Mission Department (1986). The Teachings and History of Tenrikyo. Tenri, Japan: Tenrikyo Overseas Mission Department. p. 180-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, following the government's Technical Schools Act, the Tenri Foreign Language College was split into two schools – Tenri Foreign Language College and Tenri Women's Academy. In 1944, Tenri Foreign Language College was reorganized and renamed as Tenri Language College, and in 1947, the school absorbed the Tenri Women's Academy, which itself had been renamed the Tenri Women's Technical College.&lt;ref name=tahot1986/&gt;

===Establishment===
In 1949, Tenri University was instituted as a four-year college. At its founding the university only had one [[faculty (division)|faculty]], the Faculty of Humanities.&lt;ref name=tahot1986/&gt; In 1959, faculties in Foreign Language and Physical Education were added.&lt;ref name=tahot1986/&gt; By the 1970s, the university had developed a strong reputation in Japan for foreign language study and [[judo]].&lt;ref name="hawkins"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tenri University: A Religious Approach to International Education|last=Hawkins|first=John N.|author2=Judith A. Takata |journal=Peabody Journal of Education|volume=49|issue=4|date=July 1972|pages=300–306|doi=10.1080/01619567209537870|jstor=1492467}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the university was reorganized into the four faculties that remain today – Human Studies, Letters, International Studies, and Health/Sports Studies.&lt;ref name=courseguide&gt;[http://www.tenri-u.ac.jp/en/ariirh0000000726-att/english2018.pdf "Tenri University course guide for 2018-19 school year." Retrieved 30 March 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twenty-first century, Tenri University has added graduate programs – the Graduate School of Clinical Studies in 2004, the Graduate School of Physical Fitness in 2015, and the Graduate School of the Study of Religion in 2017.&lt;ref name=courseguide /&gt; The university conducts a Japanese Studies program for international students and participates in cultural exchange programs with other universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tenri-u.ac.jp/en/ariirh0000000726.html "Japanese Studies Course." Tenri University. Retrieved 30 March 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and associated institutions==
Tenri University is part of the [[oyasato-yakata]] complex, a square almost one kilometer in diameter that also houses a seminary, public schools, Tenrikyo lectures, and the [[Tenri Hospital]].

Tenri University operates [[Tenri Central Library]], a notable Japanese library, as well as the [[Tenri University Sankōkan Museum]].

'''''The Frisco Kid''''' is a 1979 American [[western (genre)|western]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Robert Aldrich]], starring [[Gene Wilder]] as Avram Belinski, a [[Poland|Polish]] [[rabbi]] who is traveling to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], and [[Harrison Ford]] as a bank robber who befriends him.

==Plot==
Rabbi Avram Belinski (Wilder), newly graduated at the bottom of his class from the [[yeshiva]], arrives in [[Philadelphia]] from Poland en route to San Francisco where he will be a congregation's new rabbi. He has with him a [[Torah]] scroll for the San Francisco [[synagogue]]. Belinski, an innocent, trusting, and inexperienced traveler, falls in with three [[con artist|con men]], the brothers Matt and Darryl Diggs and their partner Mr. Jones, who trick him into helping pay for a wagon and supplies to go west, then brutally rob him and leave him and most of his belongings scattered along a deserted road in Pennsylvania.

Still determined to make it to San Francisco, Belinski spends time with some [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] [[Amish]] people (whom at first he takes for [[Jews]]). Because he was injured when he was dumped out of the speeding wagon, the Amish nurse takes care of Belinski until he is back to good health and gives him money for the train west to the end of the line. When he reaches the end of the line in Ohio, the rabbi manages to find work on the railroad. On his way west again after saving up enough money to buy a horse and some supplies, he is befriended and looked after by a stranger named Tommy Lillard (Ford), a bank robber with a soft heart who is moved by Belinski's helplessness and frank personality, despite the trouble it occasionally gives him.

For instance, when Lillard robs a bank on a Thursday, he finds that Belinski (an [[Orthodox Jew]]) will not ride on the [[Shabbat]] — even with a hanging [[posse (law enforcement)|posse]] on his tail. However, they still manage to get away, mainly because with the horses rested from having been walked for a full day, they are fresh and able to ride all night, outdistancing their pursuers.

On another occasion, due to Belinski's insistence on riding into foul weather, he and Lillard have to use an old Indian trick and snuggle up next to their horses, which they have gotten to lie on the ground, to wait out a snowstorm. While traveling together, the two also experience [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] customs and hospitality, disrupt a [[Trappist]] monastery's [[vow of silence]] with an innocent gesture of gratitude, and learn a little about each other's culture.

While stopping in a small town not too far from San Francisco, Belinski encounters the Diggs brothers and Jones again. He gets into a fight with the three of them and, after taking a beating, is rescued by Lillard, who takes back what they had stolen from Belinski and more besides.

Seeking revenge, the three bandits follow the pair and ambush them on a California beach where they have stopped to bathe and a firefight ensues. Tommy shoots Jones dead and creases Matt Diggs, who flees the scene. Belinski experiences a crisis of faith when he is forced to kill Darryl Diggs in [[self-defense]] after Darryl wounded Tommy. Lillard restores his faith by an eloquent argument with simple language, reminding him that he still is what he is inside, despite what he had to do on the beach.

When Matt Diggs, sole survivor of the ambushing trio, prepares to avenge his brother by killing Belinski and Lillard springs to his friend's defense, Belinski, regaining his composure, shows his wisdom and courage in front of the entire community by disarming and exiling Diggs from San Francisco. The film ends with Belinski marrying Rosalie Bender, younger daughter of the head of San Francisco's Jewish community, with Lillard attending the ceremony as his best man.

==Production==
===Development===
The film was in development for seven years. It was known as ''No Knife'' for a long time, then briefly as ''Greenhorn'' before someone suggested ''The Frisco Kid''.&lt;ref&gt;At the Movies: Art Carney plays an aging bartender. Russian Day in Queens
Buckley, Tom. New York Times 20 July 1979: C6. &lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Aldrich replaced director [[Dick Richards]] during pre-production.&lt;ref name="robert"/&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] wrote, "It's really nobody's movie. The screenplay has been around Hollywood for several years, and Aldrich seems to have taken it on as a routine assignment."&lt;ref name= "Ebert" /&gt;

According to Gene Wilder's autobiography, ''Kiss Me Like a Stranger: My Search for Love and Art'', the Tommy Lillard role, played by Harrison Ford, was originally planned for [[John Wayne]]. John J. Puccio of Movie Metropolis writes that Wayne was "eager to take it on as a comic follow-up to ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' and ''[[Rooster Cogburn (film)|Rooster Cogburn]]''. Salary concerns nixed the idea, though, and it's questionable he would have finished the shooting, in any case, as he died shortly before ''The Frisco Kid'' opened."&lt;ref name= "JP"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://moviemet.com/review/frisco-kid-dvd-review#.VLQdlE0o6cg |author= Puccio, John J. |date= February 13, 2006 |title= FRISCO KID - DVD review |publisher= Movie Metropolis |accessdate= January 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Another source says Wayne did not want to make the film due to "vulgarity" in the script.&lt;ref&gt;Taxi Driver Totaled on TV.-Big John's Big Bux
McCarthy, Todd. Film Comment; New York Vol. 15, Iss. 2,  (Mar/Apr 1979): 78-80. &lt;/ref&gt;)

Wilder said he was offered the film in 1976 but turned it down. The script was rewritten, he read it again the following year and thought it was better but still turned it down. However when he read a revised second draft he agreed to do it. Warners asked him to work on the script, so he helped with the construction of a third draft, then wrote a fourth draft.&lt;ref name="gene"/&gt;
===Shooting===
Filming started 30 October 1978 under the working title ''No Knife''.&lt;ref&gt;FILM CLIPS: Star Transfiusion for 'Bloodline'
Kilday, Gregg. Los Angeles Times 7 Oct 1978: b5. &lt;/ref&gt;

Aldrich said "With the exception of Bette Davis, Gene is the best actor I've worked with. He's very intuitive, very bright."&lt;ref name="gene"&gt;GENE WILDER: A RABBI AT HOME ON THE RANGE: FROM LOCATION
Warga, Wayne. Los Angeles Times 24 Dec 1978: 45. &lt;/ref&gt;

Wilder said he liked working with Aldrich too calling the film ''Young Frankenstein Meets the Dirty Dozen'' and saying "the way he chooses to do a scene is the most artistic of any director I've ever worked with."&lt;ref name="gene"/&gt;

Aldrich did not always get on with Harrison Ford during the shoot. "I think every time Aldrich looked at Harrison, he saw John Wayne," said Mace Neufeld, the producer. "Harrison was aware of that, but he was always fun to be around, very funny. "&lt;ref&gt;Danger Is His Business It may not look like it as Harrison Ford sits on the front porch of his Wyoming retreat. But trust us: Hollywood is a dangerous place, and Ford has certainly done well in the action game.. (Just don't hold your breath for `Fugitive II.'): [Home Edition]
Newman, Bruce. Los Angeles Times 14 Aug 1994: 6. &lt;/ref&gt;

Ford later said "It was fun to work with Gene... [but] every time the director, Robert Aldrich, looked at me, he was thinking about how unhappy he was that he didn't have John Wayne, instead."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison Ford dishes on news, family life and socks

==Reception==
===Box Office===
The film earned $4.7 million at the US box office in its first year.&lt;ref&gt;Grosses Gloss: Breaking Away at the Box-Office
Beaupre, Lee. Film Comment; New York Vol. 16, Iss. 2,  (Mar/Apr 1980): 69-73,80. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
On review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has a 53% rating based on 15 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/frisco_kid/ |title= The Frisco Kid (1979) |publisher= Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate= January 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described ''The Frisco Kid'' as "harmless chaos": "People keep coming and going and doing ferociously cute things, but never anything that could appeal to anyone except a close relative or someone with a built-in weakness for anything ethnic whatsoever." He criticized the lack of plot development, saying that, while based on a clever idea, ''The Frisco Kid'' ultimately fails to deliver on its promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Canby|first=Vincent|title= ''The Frisco Kid'' (1979)|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A04E4DE1738E432A25755C0A9619C946890D6CF|accessdate=11 April 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=6 July 1979|quote=There's scarcely a plot development, from the moment the rabbi is swindled out of his money on his arrival in Philadelphia, through his adventures on the open range in the company of a kind-hearted, WASP outlaw (Harrison Ford), that isn't telegraphed from the opening, pre-credit sequences.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the movie a mixed review, admitting that after seeing ''[[Cat Ballou]]'' he was "forever after spoiled on the subject of comic Westerns." "The movie's based on a good idea, yes... But what approach do you take to this material? What's your comic tone? ''The Frisco Kid'' tries for almost every possible tone."&lt;ref name= "Ebert"&gt;{{cite web |last= Ebert |first= Roger |authorlink= Roger Ebert |title= ''The Frisco Kid'' |publisher= www.rogerebert.com |date= January 1, 1979 |url= http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-frisco-kid-1979 |accessdate= January 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan Hiller called it one of "25 Essential Jewish Movies", praising its "uncommon innocence and unselfconscious humility." He called it an "unpredictably paced part screwball comedy farce, part dramatic buddy picture, part spaghetti western" and wrote, "''The Frisco Kid'' has the feel of an artist’s charmingly naive youthful indiscretion... ''The Frisco Kid'' is, all pratfalls and tuchus jokes aside, the quintessential 'Torah' movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bangitout.com/articles/viewarticle.php?a=2936 |author= Hiller, Jordan |date= September 24, 2009 |title= 25 Essential Jewish Movies |publisher= Bang It Out |accessdate= January 12, 2015 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140628171637/http://www.bangitout.com/articles/viewarticle.php?a=2936 |archivedate= June 28, 2014 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewer Ken Hanke wrote, "Robert Aldrich's penultimate film is an easygoing work of some considerable charm that relies far too much on ethnic humor — mostly Jewish, but not entirely — to sit quite as comfortably as it might like... [Aldrich's] professionalism serves the film well. It's very hard to fault on a technical level, and he brings a strong visual sense to bear on a number of sequences that raise them several notches above the TV flavor of the material. The dance sequence, when Avram and his unlikely companion, Tommy (Harrison Ford), are prisoners of a tribe of Indians, is a good case in point, as is the final shoot-out in the streets of San Francisco... Never a great movie, it's nonetheless a pleasant one — an old-fashioned entertainment that more than gets by on the unforced (albeit unlikely) chemistry of Wilder and Ford."&lt;ref name= "Hanke"&gt;{{cite news |last= Hanke |first= Ken |title= ''The Frisco Kid'' |work= Mountain Xpress |location= Asheville, NC |publisher= |date= June 15, 2005 |url= http://mountainx.com/movies/reviews/friscokid-php/ |accessdate= January 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puccio of Movie Metropolis called the film "humorous and touching" and "uplifting as well": "''The Frisco Kid'' is not a great film; it's not even a very good film by the best filmmaking standards; but it's such a sweet and gentle film, it's hard not to like... The film moseys along at a leisurely pace, and the director has a little difficulty finding the right comedic tone between dry, subtle farce and outright slapstick; yet it manages to find a soft spot in the heart for every scene, so maybe 'heartwarming' is what Aldrich had in mind, in which case he couldn't have done better."&lt;ref name= "JP" /&gt;

Wilder's performance was widely praised. Ebert wrote, "What's poignant about the film is that Wilder's performance is such a nice one. He's likable, plucky, versatile. He is, in fact, as good an actor here as he's ever been before, and at his own brand of complex vulnerability Gene Wilder has never been surpassed."&lt;ref name= "Ebert" /&gt; Hanke said, "But the main interest in the film is probably Gene Wilder's performance, which is interesting simply because it's one of the few times that Wilder played a character that wasn't essentially Gene Wilder. And, lo and behold, he does a perfectly credible job of being someone else — or at least someone else who isn't Willy Wonka."&lt;ref name= "Hanke" /&gt; Film scholar Stuart Galbraith IV declares that Wilder gives "one of his very best performances" and calls his character "incredibly endearing": "''The Frisco Kid'' is a real surprise, offering as it does one of Gene Wilder's best characterizations in a film that's alternately funny and sweetly touching, this despite Robert Aldrich's generally indelicate direction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/20598/frisco-kid-the/ |author= Galbraith, Stuart |date= March 13, 2006 |title= ''The Frisco Kid'' |publisher= DVD Talk |accessdate= January 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Puccio wrote, "Nobody does nice like Gene Wilder... Nor have many actors been so willing to celebrate their culture and religious convictions as Wilder does here, perhaps also a trait he picked up from [Mel] Brooks."&lt;ref name= "JP" /&gt;

[[File:Virgen de la Puerta.jpg|thumb|250px|Virgin of La Puerta, [[Otuzco]]]]
'''Virgin of La Puerta''' is a [[Marian devotion]] of the [[Catholic]] [[Church (building)|Church]] in [[Peru]] whose image has its principal place of worship in a [[sanctuary]] built on the site where once stood the gateway to [[Otuzco]], in a high [[andean]] area located about 75&amp;nbsp;km northeast of [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]] city, in [[La Libertad Region|La Libertad region]].

==History==
According to chronicles, worship and faith of the people of [[Otuzco]] to "Virgin of La Puerta" began in the seventeenth century when it was feared a [[piracy]] attack to the city of Trujillo, so the nearby villages could  be also attacked by pirates in a possible incursion of these to the coastal city. In Otuzco existed a chapel dedicated to [[Immaculate Conception]], [[Patroness]] of Otuzco in that time. When the news became known that the northern cities [[Guayaquil]] and Zaña had been attacked by pirates and believing that [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]] would be the next city to be attacked, from Trujillo were sent messages  to the nearby villages so they could take their preventive measures. Residents of Otuzco placed an image of the Virgin of the Conception in the entrance of the [[village]] as a symbol of prayer and protection of piracy attacks. Miraculously Trujillo was not attacked by pirates dangerous, and since then born worship and faith to ''Virgin of La Puerta'' which spans the north of [[Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year =|url =http://www.deperu.com/abc/articulo_pdf.php?con=2545|title =Virgin of La Puerta|editor =|accessdate =May 21, 2012|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20131017050040/http://www.deperu.com/abc/articulo_pdf.php?con=2545|archive-date =October 17, 2013|dead-url =yes|df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patronal feast==
The celebration originated in 1664 when it placed the image of the Virgin at the entrance of Otuzco as precaution of the risk of a pirate raid. The main day is celebrated on December 15 every year and in 2012 the feast of Our Lady of the Gate was declared a National Cultural Heritage by the Peruvian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year = |url = http://elcomercio.pe/actualidad/1500773/noticia-fiesta-virgen-puerta-fue-declarada-patrimonio-cultural-nacion|title =Fiesta de la Virgen de la Puerta fue declarada Patrimonio Cultural de la Nación|editor = |accessdate =May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From days before the central date hundreds of devout pilgrims make a journey of about 73&amp;nbsp;km from Trujillo to the sanctuary of the Virgen de la Puerta, located in [[Otuzco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year = |url = http://www.rpp.com.pe/2012-12-13-peregrinos-inician-recorrido-a-santuario-de-la-virgen-de-la-puerta-noticia_548837.html|title =Peregrinos inician recorrido a santuario de la Virgen de la Puerta|editor = |accessdate =December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Keneder yiddishe vochenblatt''''' ({{Lang-yi|קענעדער ײִדישער ואָכנבּלאַט|translation=Canadian Jewish Weekly}}), known as the '''''Vochenblatt''''', was a [[Yiddish language|Yiddish-language]] [[Communism|communist]] [[newspaper]] in [[Canada]], published from [[Toronto]] from 1926 to 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paris|first=Erna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TwAVAAAAYAAJ|title=Jews, an Account of Their Experience in Canada|location=Toronto|publisher=Macmillan of Canada|date=1980|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="g1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Estrajch|first=G.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFxTxgpR_ycC&amp;pg=PA9|title=Yiddish in the Cold War|location=London|publisher=Legenda|year=2008|page=9, 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vochenblatt'' was one of the major communist Yiddish newspapers in the world during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt; The newspaper was edited by Joshua Gershman until his death in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forte|first=Nick G.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wFEWAQAAIAAJ|title=A Guide to the Collections of the Multicultural History Society of Ontario|location=Toronto|publisher=Multicultural History Society of Ontario|year=1992|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The newspaper was launched in 1926 as ''Der kampf'' ('The Struggle') by the [[Communist Party of Canada]], with Joshua Gershman as editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Henry M.|first2=Seemah Cathline|last2=Berson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fb8MAQAAMAAJ|title=The Canadian Jewish Outlook Anthology|location=Vancouver|publisher=New Star Books|year=1988|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The paper was renamed ''Der veg'' ('The Road'), and finally ''Der keneder yidishe vochenblatt'' in October 1940.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Portrait of a Jewish Professional Revolutionary: The Recollections of Joshua Gershman|first=Irving|last=Abella|author-link=Irving Abella|journal=[[Labour/Le Travail]]|volume=2|year=1977|pages=184-213|publisher=Canadian Committee on Labour History|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25139902|jstor= 25139902}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title 'Vochenblatt' was perceived as more 'safe' by the party, seeking to avoid state interference in its press activities.&lt;ref name="l1"/&gt;{{r|srebrnik|page=152}} Harry Guralnick served as the executive secretary of the Canadian Jewish Weekly Association, the organization that published the newspaper.{{r|srebrnik}}

In March 1943 ''Vochenblatt'' began including English pages regularly, in an effort to reach out to English-speaking Jews.&lt;ref name="l1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Levendel|first=Lewis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jx1lAAAAMAAJ|title=A Century of the Canadian Jewish Press, 1880s–1980s|location=Ottawa|publisher=Borealis Press|year=1989|pages=134-135}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nathan Cohen (critic)|Nathan Cohen]] served as editor of the English pages and wrote [[Theatre criticism|theatr]] and [[Film criticism|film reviews]]. The English-language section of ''Vochenblatt'' was later replaced by a monthly supplement, the ''[[Outlook (Jewish magazine)|Canadian Jewish Outlook]]'', which later became a standalone publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lipsitz|first=Edmond Y.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dcoRAQAAIAAJ|title=Canadian Jewry Today: Who's Who in Canadian Jewry|location=Downsview, ON|publisher=J.E.S.L. Educational Products|year=1989|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, ''Vochenblatt'' adopted a firm [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] stand, but that posture was softened as [[World War II]] progressed. The newspaper was supportive of calls from the Zionist leadership in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] to support the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. As of mid-1942, ''Vochenblatt'' began using the term ''[[Eretz Yisrael]]'' for Palestine. Still, the newspaper still maintained its support for the  [[Organization for Jewish Colonization in Russia|Birobidzhan movement]].{{r|srebrnik|page=xv}} During the 1941–1945 period the newspaper supported the foundation of an independent [[One-state solution|joint Jewish-Arab state in Palestine]].{{r|srebrnik|pages=154, 169, 201}} As of 1948 ''Vochenblat'' favoured the establishment of a [[Jewish state]] in Palestine, and as the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|Arab–Israeli War]] began it issued a call to Canadian Jews to campaign against any compromise against the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|UN resolution on establishing a Jewish state in Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tulchinsky|first=Gerald|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fIZ6wftL3oQC&amp;pg=PA273|title=Canada's Jews: A People's Journey|location=Toronto|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2008|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, the newspaper became the ''[[de facto]]'' organ of the [[United Jewish People's Order]]. Gershman served as general secretary of UJPO.{{r|srebrnik|page=184}} UJPO cut its ties and financial relationship with the newspaper when it severed its affiliation to the [[Communist Party of Canada]] (then known as the [[Labor-Progressive Party]]) at the end of 1956.&lt;ref name="Salsberg"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tulchinsky|first1=Gerald|title=Joe Salsberg: A Life of Commitment|date=2013|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=9781442614321|page=112|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/Joe_Salsberg.html?id=HYqBAAAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its later years, ''Vochenblat'' was published biweekly, rather than every week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8VFAQAAIAAJ|title=Canadian Almanac and Directory|location=Toronto|publisher=Copp Clark Publishing|date=1977|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;
