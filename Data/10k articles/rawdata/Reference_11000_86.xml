'''''50 Films to See Before You Die''''' was a television programme first shown on [[Channel 4]] on Saturday 22 July 2006, to celebrate the relaunch of [[Film4]] as a [[free-to-air]] TV channel available to [[digital terrestrial]] homes in the [[United Kingdom]]. It consisted of a list of 50 films compiled by film critics and personalities. Each film was "chosen as a paragon of a particular genre or style". ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' was chosen as the #1 film.

Recent movies dominate the list: nine are from the 2000s, twelve from the 1990s, nine from the 1980s, nine from the 1970s, and only eleven movies from all the years prior to 1970.

Three of the 50 films on the list were produced or distributed by Channel 4's own [[Film4 Productions]] – ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'' (#25), ''[[Secrets &amp; Lies (film)|Secrets &amp; Lies]]'' (#49) and ''[[Sexy Beast]]'' (#5).

&lt;!-- Per copyright law and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Non-free_content_criteria, do not add the complete list to this article --&gt;

[[File: Alexey Bakhrushin.jpg|thumb|[[Aleksey Bakhrushin]], founder of the Museum|150px|left]]

In search of exhibits, Alexey Alexandrovich Bakhrushin has repeatedly made long trips to Russia, from which he brought not only theater rarities, but also works of folk art, furniture, old Russian costumes.

While visiting abroad, Alexey Alexandrovich certainly went around antique shops. In the early XX century it was three times made a special trip to replenish the sections on the history of Western theatre. From abroad, he brought personal belongings of the French actress Mars, a collection of masks of the Italian Comedy theater, many rare musical instruments.

One of the main sources of replenishment of the Museum's collection were gifts. "Liegestuhle brethren," according to the antiquary M. M. Savostina, so liking the idea about the creation of the Bakhrushin theatre Museum, many "bezdarno and free of duty," sent him a present of rare photos, autographs, memorabilia. The inflow of gifts contributed to and gained considerable popularity in theatrical circles of Moscow "Cold Saturday."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6102">'''Biff''' is a British cartoon strip, created by Chris Garratt and Mick Kidd, which debuted in 1982&lt;ref&gt;Gravett, Paul, "1001 Comics You Must Read Before You Die", Universe, 2012, page 438.&lt;/ref&gt; and has appeared in the newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' from 1985 onwards (Biff Weekend ran there weekly for 20 years). The comic originated in a series of single-panel postcards before evolving into multi-panel comic strips.&lt;ref&gt;Gravett, Paul, "1001 Comics You Must Read Before You Die", Universe, 2012, page 438.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been published in the magazine [[Viz (comic)|''Viz'']] and since 2001 in the magazine of the [[Rough Guides]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biffonline.co.uk/links.html Biff website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cartoons are notable for their absurd, ironic, satirical and metafictional edge.&lt;ref&gt;Gravett, Paul, "1001 Comics You Must Read Before You Die", Universe, 2012, page 438.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Chris Garratt and Mick Kidd met at grammar school in the 1950s and have collaborated on Biff since the mid-1970s. Chris Garratt creates the artwork (a mixture of [[collage]], found images, tracings and original drawings) and Mick Kidd is responsible for the text. Kidd lives in [[London]] and Garratt in the [[Scilly Isles]]. They have created their strips and other artwork over the last 30 years by means of phone, post, email and occasional meetings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/newsroom/story/0,,1678374,00.html Guardian retrospective], accessed 26 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Chris Garratt introduced a retrospective of Biff work in these terms:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Press Release for 2007 retrospective, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070802030452/http://www.gallery12.info/press/biff.pdf], accessed 26 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

::''Raised on a diet of [[Hymns Ancient and Modern]], [[Sartre]] and [[Joe Meek]] hits, Goldfish Virgins of the dodgems, Intrepid Riders of the Waltzers, wags of youth club literati and pioneers of [[skiffle]], the Biff boys belong to a generation that said goodbye to trilby hats, pipes and [[National Service]] and ushered in the Golden Age of [[Rhythm &amp; Blues]], [[Existentialism]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. Their early work, retrospectively recognised as anglicised [[Situationist International|Situationism]] with its artless articulation of image and text détournement, montaging comic strip and philosophy, angst-riddled soliloquies and cowboy drawls, featured prominently in the sprawling publications and smudged ink mags of the [[counterculture|Counter Culture]].''

::''Holding up a cracked and peeling mirror to a cracked and peeling generation of new adults who exchanged [[Workers' Revolutionary Party (UK)|WRP]] for [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|SDP]], beanbags for [[Habitat (retailer)|Habitat]] and [[IKEA]], Biff eschewed the tedious route of “political satire” and its toothless ranting-to-the-converted in favour of a bewildered but first-hand commentary on the mapless aspirations, pretensions and farcical antics of the baby boomer meritocracy. Threaded through this nonsensical catalogue of faux-academic posturing, management-speak, [[Baudrillard]]ian ramblings and psychobabble set in the deathly milieu of wicker furniture and avocado dips was a continuing fascination for new frontiers in astronomy, particle physics, psychology and the arts, deliberately colliding such “serious” endeavours with the loonier fringes of self improvement such as cushion-bashing psychotherapy, astrology and sweat lodges.''

::''Biff’s 20 year tenure in “The Guardian” effectively charted the Rise and Fall of the not-so-angry young things as they shambled from [[Grosvenor Square]] to [[Hay Festival|Hay-on-Wye]], from the [[Ugly Rumours (band)|Ugly Rumours]] to [[Iraq War|Iraq]], into the present wilderness of collective paranoia.''

They are still working and contribute to [[BBC]] History magazines with ‘A Biff History of Exploration’ and ‘A Biff History of The Media’, [[People Management]] with ‘Human Resources’, Latest Art with ‘Biff Art’ and Rough News with ‘The 6 Ages of Travel’.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Quote==
::''Biff quotes have a way of sticking in the mind. Is it ironical cultural commentary which pioneered a unique style of visual ‘sampling’ before the word had even been invented? Or is it Chris Garratt and Mick Kidd, two mad old farts from [[Leicestershire]], locked in a long-distance comedy partnership since childhood? In 1985 they got their big break, standing in for [[Posy Simmonds]] on the women’s page of the Guardian. They stayed on after Posy’s return for a further twenty years. Then, as foretold by the sudden appearance of the [[Comet Hale-Bopp|Hale-Bopp comet]] in the western sky, [[Blairism]] began to bite. They were downsized, monochromed, shrunk and eventually berlinered out of the paper altogether. But fear not for their work continues in other magazines - so as their homepage advises ‘Relax and float downstream’''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; [[Steve Bell (cartoonist)|Steve Bell]], 2007

[[File:LaBelle Blueprint.jpg|frame|right|Blueprint of the French galleon ''[[La Belle (ship)|La Belle]]'']]
[[File:Waldhaus Gasterntal Plan5.JPG|thumb|Architectural drawing, 1902]]
[[File:Joy Oil gas station blueprints.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Architectural drawing, Canada, 1936]]

A '''blueprint''' is a reproduction of a [[technical drawing]], an [[architecture|architectural plan]], or an [[engineering]] design, using a [[contact print]] process on light-sensitive sheets. Introduced by Sir [[John Herschel]] in 1842,&lt;ref name="EncycBrit"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Go. |first1=F. E. |chapter=Blueprint|title=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=1970 |volume= 3|publisher=William Benton, Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |location=Chicago |isbn=0-85229-135-3 |page=816 |edition=Expo'70 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; the process allowed rapid, and accurate, production of an unlimited number of copies. It was widely used for over a century for the reproduction of [[Technical drawing|specification drawings]] used in [[Architectural drawing#Working drawings|construction]] and industry. The blueprint process was characterized by white lines on a blue background, a [[Negative (photography)|negative]] of the original. The process was not able to reproduce color or shades of grey. 

The term ''[[wikt:blueprint|blueprint]]'' is also used less formally to refer to any [[floor plan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ShorterOxfordEnglishDictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and even less formally, [[wikt:blueprint|any type of plan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/blueprint?s=t |title=Blueprint |work=Dictionary.com |accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/blueprint |title=Blueprint |work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The blueprint process==
The blueprint process is based on a photosensitive ferric compound. The best known is a process using ammonium ferric citrate and potassium ferricyanide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.pslc.ws/macrog/work/blue.htm | title = Blue | publisher = PSLC | place = WS}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The paper is impregnated with a solution of ammonium ferric citrate and dried. When the paper is illuminated, a photoreaction turns the trivalent ferric iron into divalent ferrous iron. The image is then developed using a solution of potassium ferricyanide forming insoluble ferroferricyanide ([[Prussian blue|Prussian blue or Turnbell's blue]]) with the divalent iron. Excess ammonium ferric citrate and potassium ferricyanide are then washed away.&lt;ref name="columbia"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Bridgwater |editor1-first=William |editor2-last=Sherwood |editor2-first=Elizabeth J. |title=The Columbia Encyclopedia in One Volume |date=1950 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=Morningside Heights, New York City |page=214 |edition=Second |language=English |format=hardbound |chapter=blueprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process is also known as [[cyanotype]].

This is a simple process for the reproduction of any light transmitting document. [[Engineer]]s and [[architect]]s drew their designs on [[cartridge paper]]; these were then traced on to [[tracing paper]] using [[India ink]] for reproduction whenever needed. The tracing paper drawing is placed on top of the sensitized paper, and both are clamped under glass, in a daylight exposure frame, which is similar to a picture frame. The frame is put out into daylight, requiring a minute or two under a bright sun, or about ten minutes under an overcast sky to complete the exposure. Where [[ultra-violet light]] is transmitted through the tracing paper, the light sensitive coating converts to a stable blue or black dye. Where the India ink blocks the ultra-violet light the coating does not convert and remains soluble. The image can be seen forming. When a strong image is seen the frame is brought indoors to stop the process. The unconverted coating is washed away, and the paper is then dried. The result is a copy of the original image with the clear background area rendered dark blue and the image reproduced as a white line. 

This process has several features:&lt;ref&gt;Ralph W. Liebing ''Architectural Working Drawings'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999 {{ISBN|0471348767}} page 576&lt;/ref&gt;
{{bulleted list |the image is stable|as it is a contact process, no large-field optical system is required|the reproduced document will have the same [[Scale (ratio)|scale]] as the original|the paper is soaked in liquid during processing, and minor distortions can occur|the dark blue background makes it difficult to alter, thus preserving{{bulleted list|the approved drawing during use|a record of the approved specifications|the history of alterations recorded on the sheet|the references to other drawings}}}}

Introduction of the blueprint process eliminated the expense of photolithographic reproduction or of hand-tracing of original drawings. By the later 1890s in American architectural offices, a blueprint was one-tenth the cost of a hand-traced reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Mary N. Woods ''From Craft to Profession: The Practice of Architecture in Nineteenth-Century America'' University of California Press, 1999 {{ISBN|0520214943}}, pages 239–240&lt;/ref&gt; The blueprint process is still used for special artistic and photographic effects, on paper and fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Fabbri, Malin Fabbri ''Blueprint to Cyanotypes – Exploring a Historical Alternative Photographic Process'' Lulu.com, 2006 {{ISBN|141169838X}} page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blueprints replaced by whiteprints==
[[File:Heliographic_copy.jpg|thumb|Whiteprint plan copy.]]
Traditional blueprints became obsolete when less expensive printing methods and digital displays became available. 

In the early 1940s, cyanotype blueprint began to be supplanted by diazo prints, also known as [[whiteprint]]s, which have blue lines on a white background; thus these drawings are also called ''blue-lines'' or bluelines.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/642801/whiteprint Blueprints replaced by whiteprints]&lt;/ref&gt; Other comparable dye-based prints were known as blacklines. Diazo prints remained in use until they were replaced by [[Xerography|xerographic]] print processes.

Xerography is standard copy machine technology using [[toner]] on [[bond paper]]. When large size xerography machines became available, {{circa}} 1975, they replaced the older printing methods. As [[computer-aided design]] techniques came into use, the designs were printed directly using a [[computer printer]] or [[plotter]]. 

In most computer-aided design of parts to be machined, paper is avoided altogether, and the finished design is an image on the computer display. The computer-aided design program generates a [[computer numerical control]] sequence from the approved design. The sequence is a computer file which will control the operation of the [[machine tools]] used to make the part. 

[[File:IFA 2010 Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin 18.JPG|thumb|right|The construction drawings will be displayed by the worker on site, as needed.]]
In the case of construction plans, such as road work or erecting a building, the supervising workers will view the "blueprints" directly on displays, rather than use printed paper sheets. These displays include mobile devices, such as [[smartphone]]s or [[Tablet computer|tablet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Singer|first=Michael|title=Crain Construction grows its 80-year-old business with iOS, Android tablets|url=http://tabtimes.com/case-studies/mobile-workers/2013/03/25/crain-construction-grows-its-80-year-old-business-ios-android|publisher=tabtimes.com|accessdate=21 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522014354/http://tabtimes.com/case-studies/mobile-workers/2013/03/25/crain-construction-grows-its-80-year-old-business-ios-android|archivedate=22 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Software allows users to view and annotate electronic drawing files.

==Current use==

Various base materials have been used for blueprints.  Paper was a common choice; for more durable prints [[linen]] was sometimes used, but with time, the linen prints would shrink slightly.  To combat this problem, printing on [[vellum#Paper vellum|imitation vellum]] and, later, polyester film ([[Mylar]]) was implemented.

The process is now obsolete. It was first largely displaced by the diazo [[whiteprint]] process, and later by large-format [[xerography|xerographic]] photocopiers. Now paper copies, made by any method, are rarely used, instead digital copies are used.

The traditional term "blueprint" continues to be used informally to refer to various types of image.  Practicing engineers, architects, and drafters just call them "drawings" or "prints".

Many of the original paper blueprints are archived since they are still in use. In many situations their conversion to digital form is prohibitively expensive. Most buildings and roads constructed before c. 1990 will only have paper blueprints, not digital. These originals have significant importance to the repair and alteration of constructions still in use, e.g. bridges, buildings, sewer systems, roads, railroads, etc.

In [[publishing]] and [[library science]], '''Cataloging in Publication''' ('''CIP''', or '''Cataloguing in Publication''') data are basic [[library catalog|cataloging]] data for a work, prepared before publication by the [[national library]] of the country where the work is principally published or by the library of a publishing organisation, such as a government department. The name reflects the usual practice of including that information in the corresponding publication—in the case of books, on the [[copyright page]], where it can be useful for cataloguers when they are adding such items to their collections. The national libraries' CIP staffs restrict the range of publications that CIP will be prepared for, for instance requiring access to assistance from the publisher's staff.

A frequent problem with CIP occurs when publishers change bibliographic details, such as the wording of a [[Title (publishing)|title]], after receiving the CIP data. The CIP data as published in the item will be incorrect and useless to subsequent cataloguing agencies without manual amendment; if a pre-publication record has been entered onto a database, it can be difficult to locate and edit to match the details on the item itself.

Each national library maintains a [[database]] of the entries it writes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4755">This is a '''list of content-control software''' and services. The software is designed to control what content may or may not be viewed by a reader, especially when used to restrict material delivered over the Internet via the Web, e-mail, or other means. Restrictions can be applied at various levels: a government can attempt to apply them nationwide, an [[ISP]] can apply them to its clients, an employer to its personnel, a school to its teachers and/or students, a library to its patrons and/or staff, a parent to a child's computer or computer account or an individual to his or her own computer.

The '''Corpus of Contemporary American English''' ('''COCA''') is a more than 560-million-word [[text corpus|corpus]] of [[American English]]. It was created by [[Mark Davies (linguist)|Mark Davies]], Professor of [[corpus linguistics|Corpus Linguistics]] at [[Brigham Young University]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.helsinki.fi/varieng/CoRD/corpora/COCA/background.html |title=The Corpus of Contemporary American English: Background and history |work=VARIENG |first=Henri |last=Kauhanen |date=2011-03-21 |accessdate=2011-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The corpus is composed of more than 560 million words from 220,225 texts, including 20 million words from each of the years 1990 through 2017. The most recent update was made in December 2017. The corpus is used by approximately tens of thousands of people each month,{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=April 2018}} which may make it the most widely used "structured" corpus currently available.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=April 2018}}

For each year, the corpus is evenly divided between the following five genres: spoken, fiction, popular magazines, newspapers, and academic journals. The texts come from a variety of sources:

* Spoken: (85 million words) Transcripts of unscripted conversation from nearly 150 different TV and radio programs.
* Fiction: (81 million words) Short stories and plays, first chapters of books 1990–present, and movie scripts.
* Popular magazines: (86 million words) Nearly 100 different magazines, from a range of domains such as news, health, home and gardening, women's, financial, religion, and sports.
* Newspapers: (81 million words) Ten newspapers from across the US, with text from different sections of the newspapers, such as local news, opinion, sports, and the financial section.
* Academic Journals: (81 million words) Nearly 100 different peer-reviewed journals. These were selected to cover the entire range of the [[Library of Congress Classification|Library of Congress Classification system]].

==Availability==

The corpus is free to search through its web interface,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corpus of Contemporary American English|url=http://corpus.byu.edu/coca/|website=Corpus of Contemporary American English|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a limit on the number of queries per day, and less-restricted access is available at cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BYU corpora: Premium|url=http://corpus.byu.edu/premium.asp|website=BYU corpora|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The full corpus texts are available for a further fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corpus data: Purchase|url=http://www.corpusdata.org/purchase.asp|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Queries ==
* The interface is the same as the BYU-BNC interface for the 100 million word [[British National Corpus]], the 100 million word TIME Magazine corpus, and the 400 million word Corpus of *Historical* American English (COHA), 1810s–2000s (see links below)
* Queries by word, phrase, alternates, substring, part of speech, lemma, synonyms (see below), and customized lists (see below)
* The corpus is tagged by [[CLAWS (linguistics)|CLAWS]], the same [[part of speech]] tagger that was used for the BNC and the TIME corpus
* Chart listings (totals for all matching forms in each genre or year, 1990–present, as well as for subgenres) and table listings (frequency for each matching form in each genre or year)
* Full collocates searching (up to ten words left and right of node word)
* Re-sortable concordances, showing the most common words/strings to the left and right of the searched word
* Comparisons between genres or time periods (e.g. collocates of 'chair' in fiction or academic, nouns with 'break the [N]' in newspapers or academic, adjectives that occur primarily in sports magazines, or verbs that are more common 2005–2010 than previously)
* One-step comparisons of collocates of related words, to study semantic or cultural differences between words (e.g. comparison of collocates of 'small' and 'little', or 'Democrats' and 'Republicans', or 'men' and 'women', or 'rob' vs 'steal')
* Users can include semantic information from a 60,000 entry thesaurus directly as part of the query syntax (e.g. frequency and distribution of synonyms of 'beautiful', synonyms of 'strong' occurring in fiction but not academic, synonyms of 'clean' + noun ('clean the floor', 'washed the dishes'))
* Users can also create their own 'customized' word lists, and then re-use these as part of subsequent queries (e.g. lists related to a particular semantic category (clothes, foods, emotions), or a user-defined part of speech)
* Note that the corpus is only available through the web interface, due to copyright restrictions.

The '''Courtauld Gallery''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|k|ɔər|t|əʊ|l|d|}}) is an [[art museum]] in [[Somerset House]], on the [[Strand, London|Strand]] in central [[London]]. It houses the art collection of the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]], a self-governing college of the [[University of London]] specialising in the study of the [[history of art]]. 

The Courtauld collection was formed largely through donations and bequests and includes paintings, drawings, sculptures and other works from medieval to modern times; it is particularly known for its [[Impressionism|French Impressionist]] and [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] paintings. 

In total, the collection contains some 530 paintings and over 26,000 drawings and prints.&lt;ref name=murdoch/&gt; The Head of the Courtauld Gallery is [[Ernst Vegelin]].&lt;ref name=court2/&gt;

==History==
[[File:The Exhibition Room at Somerset House by Thomas Rowlandson and Augustus Pugin. 1800..jpg|thumb|Pugin's ''Exhibition Room, Somerset House'', showing a room which is now part of the Courtauld Gallery]]
The Courtauld Institute was founded in 1932 through the philanthropic efforts of the industrialist and art collector [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Samuel Courtauld]], the diplomat and collector [[Arthur Lee, 1st Viscount Lee of Fareham|Lord Lee of Fareham]], and the art historian Sir [[Robert Witt (art historian)|Robert Witt]].

The art collection at the Courtauld was begun by Samuel Courtauld, who in the same year presented an extensive collection of paintings, mainly [[Impressionism|French Impressionist]] and [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] works. He made further gifts later in the 1930s and a bequest in 1948. 

[[File:Edouard Manet, A Bar at the Folies-Bergère.jpg|thumb|right|''[[A Bar at the Folies-Bergère]]'' (1882) by [[Édouard Manet]]]]

His collection included [[Édouard Manet|Manet]]'s ''[[A Bar at the Folies-Bergère]]'' and a version of the ''[[The Luncheon on the Grass|Déjeuner sur l'Herbe]]'', [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]]'s ''[[La Loge]]'', landscapes by [[Claude Monet]] and [[Camille Pissarro]], a ballet scene by [[Edgar Degas]], and a group of eight major works by [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]]. Other paintings include [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s ''[[Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear]]''  and ''Peach Blossoms in the Crau'', [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]]'s ''Nevermore'' and ''Te Rerioa'', and important works by [[Georges Seurat|Seurat]], [[Henri Rousseau|Henri "le Douanier" Rousseau]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]].

Further bequests were added after the [[Second World War]], most notably the collection of [[Old Master]] paintings assembled by Lord Lee, a founder of the Institute. This included [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach]]'s ''Adam and Eve'' and a sketch in oils by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] for what is arguably his masterpiece, the ''[[The Descent from the Cross (Rubens)|Deposition]]'' altarpiece in [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Antwerp Cathedral]].

Sir Robert Witt, also a founder of the Courtauld Institute, was an outstanding benefactor and bequeathed his important collection of Old Master and British drawings in 1952. His bequest included 20,000 prints and more than 3000 drawings. His son, Sir John Witt, later gave more English watercolours and drawings to the Gallery.

In 1958 Pamela Diamand, the daughter of [[Roger Fry]] (1866–1934), the eminent art critic and founder of the [[Omega Workshops]], donated his collection of [[20th-century art]] including works by [[Bloomsbury Group]] artists [[Vanessa Bell]] and [[Duncan Grant]].

In 1966 Mark Gambier-Parry, son of Major [[Ernest Gambier-Parry]], bequeathed the diverse collection of art formed by his grandfather, [[Thomas Gambier Parry]], which ranged from [[Early Renaissance painting|Early Italian Renaissance painting]] to [[Maiolica|majolica]], medieval [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] and [[ivory]] carvings, and other types of art (see section below).

[[William Wycliffe Spooner|Dr William Wycliffe Spooner]] (1882–1967) and his wife Mercie added to the Gallery's collection of English watercolours in 1967 with a bequest of works by [[John Constable]], [[John Sell Cotman]], [[Alexander Cozens|Alexander]] and [[John Robert Cozens]], [[Thomas Gainsborough]], [[Thomas Girtin]], [[Samuel Palmer]], [[Thomas Rowlandson]], [[Paul Sandby]], [[Francis Towne]], [[J. M. W. Turner]], [[Peter De Wint]] and others.&lt;ref name=murdoch/&gt;&lt;ref name=spooner/&gt;

In 1974 a group of thirteen watercolours by Turner was presented in memory of Sir [[Stephen Courtauld]], famous for restoring [[Eltham Palace]], and the brother of Samuel Courtauld, one of the founders of the Institute.

In 1978 the Courtauld received the Princes Gate Collection of Old Master paintings and drawings formed by Count [[Antoine Seilern]]. The collection rivals the Samuel Courtauld Collection in importance. It includes paintings by [[Bernardo Daddi]], [[Robert Campin]], [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]], [[Quentin Matsys]], [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyck]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]], but is strongest in the works of Rubens. The bequest also included a group of 19th- and 20th‑century works by [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] and [[Oskar Kokoschka]].

More recently the [[Lillian Browse]] and Alastair Hunter collections have given the Courtauld more late 19th- and 20th‑century paintings, drawings and sculptures.

A collection of more than 50 British watercolours, including eight by Turner, was left to the Gallery by Dorothy Scharf in 2004.&lt;ref name=court3/&gt;

The gallery closed on 3rd September 2018 for at least two years during a major redevelopment costing £50M.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/nov/23/courtauld-gallery-to-close-for-two-years-for-50m-revamp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
[[File:Somerset House, Strand.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Strand, London|Strand]] block of [[Somerset House]], designed by [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]] from 1775 to 1780, home of the Courtauld Institute and the Courtauld Gallery since 1989]]
The Courtauld Gallery is open to the public.

From 1958 to 1989 the Courtauld collection was housed in part of the premises of the [[Warburg Institute]] in [[Woburn Square]];&lt;ref name=court/&gt; it was thus separated from the Courtauld Institute, which was in [[Home House]], [[Portman Square]]. 

Since 1989 it has been housed, together with the Courtauld Institute, in the North or Strand block of Somerset House, in the rooms designed and purpose-built by [[Sir William Chambers]] for the [[learned society|learned societies]], namely the [[Royal Academy]] (of which Chambers was the first Treasurer), the [[Royal Society]] and the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]].

The Royal Academy occupied them from their completion in 1780 until it moved to the new [[National Gallery]] building in [[Trafalgar Square]] in 1837. Inscribed over the entrance to the Great Room, in which the annual [[Royal Academy summer exhibition]] was held, is the formidable inscription &lt;small&gt;ΟΥΔΕΙΣ ΑΜΟΥΣΟΣ ΕΙΣΙΤΩ&lt;/small&gt; ("Let no stranger to the [[Muse]]s enter" in [[Ancient Greek]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farr|first1=Dennis|last2=Newman|first2=John|title=Guide to the Courtauld Institute Galleries at Somerset House|year=1990|publisher=Courtauld Institute Galleries|location=London|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gambier-Parry Collection==
[[File:Courtauld galleries, prima sala.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Most of the Gambier-Parry items on display at the Courtauld Gallery are in this room on the ground floor.]] 
[[Thomas Gambier Parry]] (1816–1888) was a keen and versatile collector for most of his adult life. Many of his purchases were made on trips to the continent, especially Italy, but he also bought from dealers and auctions in England, and sometimes sold items. 

His most important collections were of late medieval and Early Renaissance paintings, small sculpted [[relief]]s, ivories, and [[maiolica]], but he also had a significant early collection of Islamic metalwork, and a variety of other types of objects, for example [[Hispano-Moresque ware]], glass and three small post-Byzantine wooden crosses from [[Mount Athos]] elaborately carved with miniature scenes. 

The Courtauld Gallery website shows images and descriptions of 324 objects from the 1966 bequest, which included the bulk of the collection.&lt;ref name=artandarch2/&gt;

Gambier Parry began by collecting mostly 16th- and 17th-century works, but his focus gradually moved to 14th- and 15th-century works, still relatively little collected, although [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] was among British collectors of "Italian Primitives", as [[Trecento]] paintings were then known. Among his most important paintings were a ''[[Coronation of the Virgin]]'' by [[Lorenzo Monaco]], one of the larger works in the collection, three [[predella]] panels with roundels of Christ and saints by [[Fra Angelico]], and a small but important [[diptych]] of the [[Annunciation]] by [[Pesellino]].  There are two further predella panels by Lorenzo Monaco, and many other small panels by lesser-known masters.  Later Renaissance works include ones by [[Il Garofalo]], [[Sassoferrato]], and there is a [[Baroque]] ''Assumption'' by [[Francesco Solimena]].  There are a number of [[illuminated manuscript]] pages from the workshop of the [[Boucicaut Master]].

The sculptures include three fine 15th-century marble reliefs of the Virgin and Child, the most significant by [[Mino da Fiesole]].&lt;ref name=john/&gt;  There is a [[Limoges enamel]] book cover panel, a number of Renaissance Limoges items, and several small Gothic ivories.&lt;ref name=john/&gt;&lt;ref name=blunt/&gt;&lt;ref name=mallet/&gt;

'''DNS over TLS''' ('''DoT''') is a security protocol for encrypting and wrapping [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) queries and answers via the [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS) protocol. The goal of the method is to increase user privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data via [[man-in-the-middle attacks]].

{{History of Northern Cyprus}}
The '''declaration of Independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus''' was a [[unilateral declaration of independence]] from the [[Republic of Cyprus]] by the [[Assembly of the Republic (Northern Cyprus)|Turkish Cypriot parliament]] on 15 November 1983.

Eight years after the [[Turkish Federative State of North Cyprus]] was proclaimed (in 1975), the declaration of [[North Cyprus]] was presented to the Turkish Cypriot parliament in [[North Nicosia]] by Turkish Cypriot Leader and Northern Cypriot State President [[Rauf Denktaş]] on November 15, 1983. Containing text espousing human rights and a desire to live side-by-side with the Greek Cypriot population, it ended with a declaration that Northern Cyprus was an [[independent (nation)|independent]] and [[sovereignty|sovereign]] state, naming the entity the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]]. The Turkish Cypriot Parliament passed a unanimous resolution later that day ratifying the declaration.

== Background ==
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}

== The declaration ==
{{wikisource}}

==Reactions==
The [[United Nations Security Council]] issued two resolutions ([[United Nations Security Council Resolution 541|541]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 550|550]]) proclaiming that the Turkish Cypriot UDI was legally invalid and requesting that no other sovereign state should recognize the declaration and asked for its withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://undocs.org/S/RES/541(193) Text of Resolution 541 at undocs.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://undocs.org/S/RES/550(1984) Text of Resolution 550 at undocs.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition ==
===UN Countries and the Others===
[[Turkey]] formally recognized [[Northern Cyprus]] on the day its UDI was declared. 
The [[parliament]] of the [[Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic]], which is a self-governing [[exclave]] of [[Azerbaijan]], has issued a resolution recognizing the TRNC as a sovereign nation, but this recognition is not shared by [[Foreign relations of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan's central government]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3240">A '''domain name drop list''' is a list containing the expired [[domain names]] that will be deleted from the [[domain name registry]] in the near future.  These lists are typically used by [[domainers]] to locate expiring domain names with value.

== Drop list contents ==
There is no defined date range for data contained with a drop list, as they can contain anywhere between 1 day's worth of expiring domain names, to 30 or more days worth.  Some drop lists contain only domain names that follow the domain name deletion process (where the domain name enters the REGISTRAR-HOLD status, followed by REDEMPTIONPERIOD, and PENDINGDELETE), some contain only pre-release domain names, and some contain both pre-release and regular domain names.

The data contained within a drop list can also vary, with some lists providing only basic information, such as the domain name and its expiry date.  Other drop lists provide more detailed statistics, including, among others, [[PageRank]], [[Link popularity]] and [[Alexa rank]].

==Dropcatching==
{{main|Domain drop catching}}

When a domain name is abandoned, or the period of validity is not renewed (expires), the webhost and registrar then action a "deletion" (the drop). Once a domain name has been deleted from the internet, it ceases to exist. Anyone may then register that name (the catch).  The process of re-registering expired names is known as '''dropcatching''' and various [[domain name registry|domain name registries]] have differing views on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nominet.org.uk/digitalAssets/28812_Domaining_dropcatching_and_the_secondary_market_Sept_07.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721231346/http://www.nominet.org.uk/digitalAssets/28812_Domaining_dropcatching_and_the_secondary_market_Sept_07.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, people get locked out of their email and cannot reply to the renew request (or otherwise obstructed or hacked), and their domainname may be deleted and offered as available.

'''Earnest Sevier Cox''' (January 24, 1880 &amp;ndash; April 26, 1966) was an American [[Methodism|Methodist]] preacher, political activist and [[White Supremacy|white-supremacist]]. He is best known for his political campaigning in favor of stricter [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] between blacks and whites in the United States through tougher [[anti-miscegenation laws]], and for his advocacy for "repatriation" of African Americans to Africa, and for his book ''White America''.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, John P., and Andrew S. Winston, 2009. [http://comm.colorado.edu/~jacksonj/esc.PDF "The Last Repatriationist: The Career of Earnest Sevier Cox"] in Paul Farber and Hamilton Cravens (eds), ''Race and Science: Scientific Challenges to Racism in Modern America'', Corvallis: Oregon State University Press, pp 58&amp;ndash;180.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Cox_Earnest_Sevier_1880-1966#start_entry "Earnest Sevier Cox (1880–1966)"], ''Encyclopedia of Virginia'', Virginia Foundation for the Humanities.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also noted for having mediated collaboration between white southern segregationists and African American separatist organizations such as [[UNIA]] and the [[Peace Movement of Ethiopia]] to advocate for repatriation legislation, and for having been a personal friend of black racial separatist [[Marcus Garvey]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Earnest Sevier Cox was born on January 24, 1880, in [[Blount County, Tennessee]], near [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt; He received a Bachelor of Science degree from [[Roane College]] in Tennessee in 1899.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt; He then studied to become a Methodist preacher at the [[Moody Bible Institute]] in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt; He studied Theology at [[Vanderbilt University Divinity School|Vanderbilt University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] until 1909, but clashed with the faculty and did not receive a degree.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt; During his studies he worked as a street preacher, but had to give up preaching due to throat problems. He then spent three years studying sociology in graduate school at the [[University of Chicago]], but did not receive a degree.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt; During that time, he studied under Professors [[Frederick Starr]] and [[Edward Alsworth Ross]].&lt;ref name="matthewpratt"&gt;Matthew Pratt Guterl, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/aq/summary/v061/61.4.guterl.html The Importance of Place in Post-Everything American Studies], ''[[American Quarterly]]'', Vol. 61, No. 4, December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; During his studies in Chicago he became interested in race issues and became a vocal proponent of white supremacy and black inferiority, and of the view that blacks and whites would never become able to peacefully coexist. He started traveling around to give public lectures.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;

===Career===

====Travels and war efforts====
Encouraged by Starr, upon leaving the University of Chicago Cox traveled to Africa, where he spent five years studying interracial relations. He described his trip as an effort of "finding out how other people control their negroes."&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;[[Robert A. Hill (Jamaican historian)|Robert A. Hill]], 1989. ''The Marcus Garvey and Universal Negro Improvement Association Papers: September 1924 &amp;ndash; December 1927''. University of California Press, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in the diamond mines in [[South Africa]] and later traveled north through [[Rhodesia]], [[Belgian Congo]] and [[German East Africa]], north to Egypt. In his writings he extolled the virtues of the German colonies which he considered to be characterized by high degrees of "racial patriotism".&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt; After returning for a year to South African mines he traveled through South America from [[Peru]] and [[Brazil]] to [[Panama]].&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt; Upon his return to Tennessee he presented himself in his lectures and publications as an explorer, ethnographer and expert on race relations. He became the subject of a piece in the ''[[New York Times]]'', describing his travels to study the "Negro Problem" in Africa.&lt;ref name=JacksonWinston/&gt; He also continued giving public lectures and preparing a manuscript for publication. During [[World War I]], he served as a captain in the [[United States Army]], but received honorable discharge when he was found unfit to serve at the front lines. In 1920 he settled in Richmond, where he made a living selling real estate.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;

====Meeting with Grant and anti-miscegenation lobbyism====
In 1920 he sent a copy of his manuscript on race relations to prominent [[Eugenics|eugenicist]] and [[Nordic race#Nordicism|nordicist]] [[Madison Grant]], whose 1916 work ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' had become an instant classic among [[Scientific racism|scientific racists]]. He complained to Grant that he could not find a publisher for his work, and Grant supported him by providing basic education in racial anthropological theory, and providing sounder arguments and toning down the emotional tone of the book. Grant also wrote a glowing review of the book, which mentioned him prominently in the acknowledgements.&lt;ref name=Spiro&gt;Spiro, Jonathan P. (2009). ''Defending the Master Race: Conservation, Eugenics, and the Legacy of Madison Grant''. Univ. of Vermont Press. {{ISBN|978-1-58465-715-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cox thanked Grant by acting as a political organizer on Grant's behalf, a role that Grant was unable to personally undertake since public political involvement was incompatible with his reputation as a prominent New York patrician.&lt;ref name=Spiro/&gt;

In 1922, with composer [[John Powell (musician)|John Powell]], Cox co-founded the [[Anglo-Saxon Clubs of America]], based on Madison Grant's nordicist ideology, in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. The group lobbied in favor of [[anti-miscegenation laws]]. Grant also requested Cox to act as a campaigner in favor of Virginia's [[Racial Integrity Act of 1924]], the version favored by Cox and Grant would have meant that any documented non-white ancestry would be enough to classify an individual as non-white. The final version passed was more lenient, in that it allowed for classification as "white" even for people with a small amount of Native American blood.

In 1943 when anthropologists [[Ruth Benedict]] and [[Gene Weltfish]] published their pamphlet ''"The Races of Mankind"'' in which they argued that there was no scientific basis for claims of racial superiority or inferiority, Cox wrote a scathing 22-page review, in which he decried the authors as participants in a Jewish and communist conspiracy in favor of "atavistic" and "perverted" miscegenation.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy Teslow (2014). ''Constructing Race: The Science of Bodies and Cultures in American Anthropology'', pp. 260&amp;ndash;162. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Publication of ''White America''====
{{quote box|"Scientific research has done much toward establishing the following propositions: 
&lt;br&gt;1. The White race(1) has founded all civilizations. 
&lt;br&gt;2. The White race remaining White has not lost civilization. 
&lt;br&gt;3. The White race become hybrid has not retained civilization."|source=Earnest Sevier Cox, ''White America''}}
In 1923, unable to find a publisher Cox published the book ''White America'' himself.  The book argued that race mixing would result in the downfall of "White civilization", and proposed the removal of all people of African descent from the American continent as the solution to the risk of mixing . It was later reissued, funded by [[Wickliffe Draper]]. In this book which has been described as a "crude retelling"&lt;ref name=JacksonWinston/&gt; of Madison Grant's Passing of the Great Race, he argued that [[Scientific racism|race science]] had produced three different findings: 1. That only the white race had ever achieved civilization, 2. that the white race while unmixed with other races had never lost civilization, and 3. that the white race when mixed with other races has never retained civilization. The main chapters of the book were examples of historical civilizations that had disappeared or declined, which Cox interpreted as being the result of contact with "Colored races". The last chapters analyzed the "race problem" in the US, and provided a proposal for a solution, namely to deport all black people "of breeding Age" to Africa.&lt;ref name=JacksonWinston&gt;Jackson and Winston, 2009. "The Last Repatriationist"], in Farber and Cravens (eds), ''Race and Science'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book won positive attention from several important academics and intellectuals in the period, and Cox was invited to Harvard to speak about it by [[Harry Laughlin]] the prominent eugenicist. Laughlin's journal "the Eugenical News" stated that "the removal of Negroes would make Cox a greater savior of his country than George Washington". The book was also incorporated into the biology curriculum at the [[University of Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson and Winston, 2009. "The Last Repatriationist" in Farber and Cravens (eds), ''Race and Science'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; It was less well received by anthropologists, and [[Melville Herskovits]] reviewed it in the journal [[Social Forces]] and described it as "fallacious in its assumptions, incompetent in its handling and loose in its logic"&lt;ref&gt;Herskovits, M. J. (1923). "Extremes and Means in Racial Interpretation". ''J. Soc. F.'', 2, 550&amp;ndash;1551.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Repatriation activism and friendship with Marcus Garvey====
In 1924 Grant suggested that Cox attend a lecture of African American racial activist [[Marcus Garvey]], whose organization [[UNIA]] shared Grant and Cox' passion for racial purity and considered repatriation of African Americans to the African continent to be the only way to salvation of their respective races. In 1924 Cox attended as the only white man, a lecture by Garvey, and after that the two became collaborators, even friends, working conjointly to promoting legislative measures that would allow American Blacks to migrate to Africa. In one of his books, Garvey presented a full page ad for Cox' book ''White America'', without charge. Garvey also endorsed the book as providing the solution to the "negro Problem", namely the "separation of the races". UNIA also promoted and sold Cox' book, distributing 17,000 copies in Detroit in the 1920s. When Garvey was imprisoned Cox and Powell campaigned for his release, Cox even pleading with the Secretary of Labor.&lt;ref name=Spiro/&gt; The collaboration between Cox and Garvey ended in 1927 when Garvey was deported to Jamaica, although the friendship between the two persisted.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spiro/&gt; Late in his life Garvey praised Cox and Bilbo, stating that "These two white men have done wonderfully well for the Negro and should not be forgotten." Cox in turn dedicated his 1925 book ''Let My People Go'' to Garvey, and referred to their relation as a "spiritual understanding."&lt;ref name=Spiro260&gt;Spiro (2009), ''Defending the Master Race'', p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ibrahim"/&gt;

Cox continued to collaborate with UNIA and later with the [[Peace Movement of Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ibrahim"&gt;Ibrahim Sundiata, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6-vCxgkpaN4C&amp;pg=PA313 ''Brothers and Strangers: Black Zion, Black Slavery, 1914–1940''], Duke University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 Cox visited Grant who was by then confined to bed by illness, but who nonetheless agreed to create a $10,000 endowment to fund lobby activities in congress for repatriation and deportation legislation. Grant did not live to make good on his promise, but his friend Wickliffe Draper did it for him and also funded additional printings of Cox' book.&lt;ref name=Spiro/&gt;

====Continued repatriation efforts====
When Senator [[Theodore Bilbo]] of [[Mississippi]] was campaigning for the [[Greater Liberia Bill]] of 1939, which asked the United States federal government to provide federal funding for sending African Americans to [[Liberia]], Cox helped him in securing the support of the Garveyites and the Peace Movement of Ethiopia. Cox even had a role in inspiring Bilbo to take on the project, as he had sent him a copy of his book which Bilbo read with pleasure, requesting from Cox copies of his newer writings. Cox also served as an important adviser to Bilbo, cautioning him to tone down his otherwise often inflammatory speech style and to address his Black allies with some degree of respect.&lt;ref name="ibrahim"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fitzgerald&gt;Michael W. Fitzgerald. "We Have Found a Moses": Theodore Bilbo, Black Nationalism, and the Greater Liberia Bill of 1939. ''The Journal of Southern History'', Vol. 63, No. 2 (May 1997), pp. 293&amp;ndash;1320.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brendagayleplummer"&gt;Brenda Gayle Plummer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=M4eEkAbYTTUC&amp;pg=PA108 ''Rising Wind: Black Americans and U.S. Foreign Affairs, 1935&amp;ndash;11960''], Chapel Hill, North Carolina: University of North Carolina Press, 1996, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; The bill, however, failed, partly due to the outbreak of WW2, which drew attention from national legislation and made it impossible to count on the participation of Britain and France in the repatriation efforts.&lt;ref name="ibrahim"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fitzgerald/&gt; In 1953 when North Dakota senator [[William Langer]] proposed a similar repatriation bill, Cox again worked for him as a tireless promoter and publicist, and even spoke in favor of the bill at a hearing in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.&lt;ref name=Duke/&gt;

====Anti-Civil rights advocacy and Nazi contacts====
During the 1950s and 1960s, Cox lobbied against the ending of [[racial segregation in the United States]].

In 1951, he self-published the book ''Teutonic Unity''. In the book, Cox criticized the two World Wars as futile "fratricides".&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt; The former Methodist had lost his faith, and so also distanced himself from Christianity which he now considered a "Judaic" religion, alien to the Teutonic genius.&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt; He distributed personally to people that he deemed fellow supporters of the "Teutonic cause".&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;Jackson, John P. (2005). ''Science for Segregation: Race, Law, and the Case against Brown v. Board of Education''. NYU Press ({{ISBN|978-0-8147-4271-6}}), pp.43&amp;ndash;144.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the recipients was Dr. [[Johann von Leers]], a Nazi fugitive living in Argentina.&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt; In his letter to Cox thanking for the book he described his surprise that an American writer would be advocating the same tenets that he had been taught in the SS. He offered to translate the work into German.&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, P. A. (2001). "The American breed: Nazi eugenics and the origins of the Pioneer Fund". ''Alb. L. Rev.'', 65, 743.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dorr&gt;Gregory Michael Dorr. 2008. ''Segregation's Science: Eugenics and Society in Virginia''. University of Virginia Press, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the U.S. Supreme Court decision ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' and the ensuing de-segregation of the American school system, he published ''Unending Hate'', in which he argued that the Bill of Rights was in essence a tribal document, only meant to extend rights to those of "Saxon stock", not to members of other races, and that in forcing Southern Whites to mingle with Blacks in the school system, the bill of rights was being prostituted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resist.com/Instauration/OtherPubs-20120723/UnendingHate-Cox.pdf Cox, Earnest Sevier. 1955. Unending Hate]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the most prominent surviving nordicist of the generation of the 1920s Cox became a respected figure in the racialist right wing of the 1950s and '60s.&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt; He collaborated extensively with white supremacists [[Willis Carto]] and [[Carleton Putnam]]. Carto's [[Noontide Press]] published reprints of several of Cox's early writings. Cox was also a member of the British-based [[Northern League (United Kingdom)|Northern League]] founded by [[Roger Pearson (anthropologist)|Roger Pearson]], and he was invited to speak at their 1959 conference in the Teutoburger forest. In his address titled "Herman's brother" he described Americans as descendants of the brother of the German culture hero [[Arminius]] (Herman), who defeated the Romans at the [[Battle of Teutoburg Forest]], and hence as "racial brothers" of the German people.&lt;ref name=Duke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dorr/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson2005p148"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Science for Segregation: Race, Law, and the Case against Brown v.

===Death===
Cox died of [[emphysema]] on April 26, 1966, in [[Richmond, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt; With no heirs, he left all of his possessions to the repatriation movement.&lt;ref name=Spiro/&gt; He was buried at the [[Arlington National Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt; His collected papers are hosted at the archive of [[Duke University]].&lt;ref name=Duke&gt;[http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/cox/ Guide to the Cox papers], Duke University.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Family Records Centre''' ('''FRC''') provided access to [[family history]] research sources mainly for [[England and Wales]]. It was administered jointly by the [[General Register Office]] (GRO) and [[National Archives (UK)|The National Archives]].

It opened in March 1997 and was fully operational by the following month. It was situated at 1 Myddelton Street, [[Clerkenwell]], [[London]], close to the [[London Metropolitan Archives]].  It closed in 2008.

Throughout the FRC, there was free access to a wide range of family history material, databases and internet websites. Staff were always available to provide help and advice on family history research and there were regular one-to-one family history surgeries and computer skills tutorials. Talks on family history topics took place every week and other events, including exhibitions and conferences, were organised. There were good facilities for customers with special needs, and there was a small bookshop next to the entrance on the ground floor and a refreshment area with [[vending machine]]s and lockers for personal belongings in the basement.

Its main resources were indexes to [[civil registration]] of births, marriages and deaths on the ground floor (provided by the GRO), and the Victorian [[census]] returns on the first floor (provided by The National Archives).

==Births, Marriages &amp; Deaths Indexes==

The births, marriages and deaths indexes were in large, heavy, [[hardcover]] books (red covers for births, green for marriages and black for deaths) in three sections respectively, with each section arranged in date order. Using the details from an index, a copy (certificate) of the corresponding birth, marriage or death entry could be applied for at the cashiers' section on the same floor. Other indexes at the FRC included some births, marriages and deaths of British nationals which took place abroad, indexes of legal adoptions in England &amp; Wales from 1927 onwards, and various indexes of war deaths in the armed forces in both World Wars.

The births, marriages and deaths indexes were originally at [[Somerset House]] until the 1970s. In the early 1980s, the births and marriages indexes were at [[Television_House#St Catherine's House|St Catherine's House]], at the northeast corner of the intersection of [[Kingsway (London)|Kingsway]] and [[Aldwych]], and the deaths indexes were at Alexandra House, farther up Kingsway. After more space was made available at St Catherine's House, the deaths indexes were moved from Alexandra House. Finally, they were all moved to the FRC in 1997.

==Census returns for England and Wales==
The 1841 to 1901 census returns for England and Wales could be consulted at the FRC and were accessed mainly online by searching for individuals by name. The 1841 to 1891 census returns were also available on [[microfilm]], while the 1901 census was also available on [[microfiche]]. A selection of street indexes and other search aids were also available.

Before the FRC opened, the census microfilms were at the [[Public Record Office]] (now part of the National Archives) in [[Chancery Lane]] for some years, after having been moved from the Land Registry building, Portugal Street, London, where they had been since the mid-1970s.

==Other microfilm resources==

Other microfilm resources available included wills and administrations from the Prerogative Court of Canterbury up to 1858, which could also be searched online, death duty registers, from 1796 to 1858, and many nonconformist registers (mainly pre-1837).

==Demise==

On 21 June 2006, it was announced that the National Archives' staff and residual services at the FRC would be relocating to the [[National Archives (UK)|National Archives]] at [[Kew]] by the end of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/news/stories/116.htm Article from The National Archives: The National Archives to move its Family Records Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;  Official press releases were vague about plans for the births, marriages and deaths indexes housed on the ground floor.  During October 2007 the index volumes in question were progressively removed from public access to a closed archive in [[Christchurch, Dorset]].&lt;ref name=closure&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/oct/29/britishidentity.technology The Guardian article: Family historians aghast as paper records locked away before online version ready]&lt;/ref&gt;

The closure date was later brought forward to early 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6980183.stm BBC news article: Family records centre to uproot]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground floor (GRO section) of the FRC closed on 27 October 2007&lt;ref name=closure/&gt; and the rest of the FRC closed on 15 March 2008.

[[File:Rolandandferragut.jpg|200px|thumb|Combat of Roland and the giant Ferragut. Illuminated miniature from ''[[Grandes Chroniques de France]]'', c1375-1380 (BnF Français 2813, fol. 118)]]

'''Ferragut''' (also known as '''Ferragus''', '''Ferracutus''', '''Ferracute''', '''Ferrakut''', '''Ferraguto''', '''Ferraù''', '''Fernagu'''&lt;ref&gt;For the latter, see Crosland, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a character—a [[Saracen]] [[paladin]], sometimes depicted as a [[Gigantism|giant]]—in texts dealing with the [[Matter of France]], including the ''[[Historia Caroli Magni]]'', and Italian [[Romance (heroic literature)|romantic]] [[Epic poetry|epics]], such as ''[[Orlando innamorato]]'' by [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]] and ''[[Orlando furioso]]'' by [[Ludovico Ariosto]].  In the tales, he was portrayed as physically invulnerable except at his navel/stomach, and was eventually killed (or fated to be killed) by the paladin [[Roland]].

==Name==
"Ferracutus" was the Latin form of the name used in the ''Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle''.  [[Thomas Bulfinch]] used "Ferragus" in his English adaptation ''Legends of Charlemagne'',&lt;ref&gt;''Legends of Charlemagne''[http://www.classicreader.com/book/2823/86/], [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4927/4927-h/4927-h.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; but the form "Ferragut" appears to be the most frequent in English today.

In his ''Orlando innamorato'', Matteo Maria Boiardo used Feraguto/Feragu (Ferraguto/Ferragu).  Ferraù is a [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncopated]] form used in ''Orlando furioso'' by Ludovico Ariosto.

==Texts==

===Ferracutus in the ''"Pseudo-Turpin" Chronicle''===
The character appears in one of the main episodes of the so-called ''[[Historia Caroli Magni|Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle]]'' (''Historia Caroli Magni'',  Book IV of the [[Codex Calixtinus]]), a Latin chronicle concerning the feats of [[Charlemagne]] and the paladin [[Roland]] from the middle of the 12th century.

In a story modeled on [[David and Goliath]],&lt;ref&gt;Crosland, 26&lt;/ref&gt; Roland battles the Saracen giant Ferracutus, who is holding the city of [[Nájera]] ([[Spain]]).  A descendant of [[Goliath]] who had been sent to Nájera from [[Syria]] by the [[Emir]] of [[Babylon]] to fight the [[Christian]] army of Charlemagne, the giant Ferracutus didn't fear any arrow or spear and had the strength of forty strong men, was nearly twelve [[cubit]]s tall, with a face a cubit long, a nose a [[hand (unit)|hand]] long, members nearly four cubits long and fingers the length of three hands.  Charlemagne sent several of his men to fight the giant: the [[Dacia]]n [[Ogier the Dane|Ogier]], [[Renaud de Montauban|Reinaldos of Montalbán]], Constantine king of Rome, Count Hoel, and twenty other fighters two by two, who were defeated effortlessly by the giant and put to prison. As soon as Roland obtained permission from Charlemagne, he approached the giant alone and they fought for two days (taking truces to rest at night) using swords, wooden sticks, stones and bare fists. They accidentally killed each other's horses, but Roland could find no way of wounding the giant. During the second night, the courteous Roland placed a stone beneath the head of the giant as a pillow, and upon waking the giant revealed to Roland that he was only vulnerable in one spot: his navel.  They also had a conversation about religion discussing matters such as the [[Holy Trinity]], the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], the [[Immaculate Conception]] and [[Resurrection]] of [[Jesus]]. After this conversation another fight took place in which Roland used the knowledge his opponent had given him, and killed Ferragut by inserting a spear in his navel.

The Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle was a massive success throughout Europe&lt;ref&gt;Hasenohr and Zink, 294.&lt;/ref&gt; and was frequently adapted or borrowed from until the Renaissance.

===Ferragus in other early modern texts===
An adaptation of the Pseudo-Turpin story of Ferraguto and his mortal duel with Orlando (Roland) occurs in the anonymous Franco-Venetian epic ''[[Entrée d'Espagne|L'Entrée d'Espagne]]'' (c. 1320; the author is thought to be from Padua).&lt;ref name="Pulci, notes, p. 890"&gt;Pulci, notes, p. 890.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crosland, 261-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story also appears in the 14th-century Italian epic ''[[La Spagna]]'' (attributed to the Florentine Sostegno di Zanobi and likely composed between 1350–1360&lt;ref&gt;Pulci, notes, p. 765 and p. 890.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Based in part in the Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle (probably via [[Vincent of Beauvais]]'s ''Speculum Historiale''),&lt;ref&gt;Hasenohr and Zink, 746.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Bagnyon|Jean or Jehan Bagnyon]]'s 15th-century ''La Conqueste du grand roy Charlemagne des Espagnes et les vaillances des douze pairs de France, et aussi celles de Fierabras'' (also called ''Fierabras'') includes the story of Ferragus (Book 3, Part 1, Chapters 10–11).  This work knew a European success and was adapted into Castilian, Portuguese, German, and English.

While the incident is not depicted in it, Ferraguto's death at the hands of Orlando is presented as a well-known fact in [[Luigi Pulci]]'s epic ''[[Morgante]]''.&lt;ref name="Pulci, notes, p. 890"/&gt;

===Ferraguto in ''Orlando innamorato''===
In [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]]'s'' [[Orlando innamorato]]'', Ferraguto is a leading Saracen knight (and not a giant), the nephew of King Marsilio of Spain, and one of the many characters passionately in love with [[Angelica (character)|Angelica]]. At the beginning of the poem, Angelica and her brother Argalia arrive at the court of the [[Charlemagne|Emperor Charlemagne]] in [[Paris]], announcing that any knight who defeats Argalia in single combat will win Angelica's hand in marriage, but if he loses he will become Argalia's prisoner. Ferraguto is among the first knights to try and is unhorsed. However, he angrily refuses to accept his captivity and Argalia and Angelica flee in terror. Ferraguto catches Argalia, kills him and steals his helmet, but he promises the dying man only to wear it for a few days.

===Ferraù in ''Orlando furioso''===
At the beginning of [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando furioso]]'' (a continuation of ''Orlando innamorato''), Ferraù loses the helmet in a stream and is confronted by the ghost of Argalia, who tells him he must find another helmet instead. Ferraù vows to win the helmet of Almonte, which now belongs to the greatest Christian knight, [[Orlando (character)|Orlando]]. He manages to possess it for a while but Ariosto predicts his ultimate death at the hands of Orlando.  Like the character in the Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle and  the 14th-century Italian epic ''La Spagna'', Ferraù is completely invulnerable except via his [[navel]].

==Ferragus in ''Valentine and Orson''==
Ferragus is also the name of a completely different [[Saracen]] [[Gigantism|giant]] from Portugal in the medieval romance ''[[Valentine and Orson]]''. Brother of Esclarmonde, he is responsible for imprisoning Bellissant, the sister of King [[Pepin the Hunchback|Pepin]], and is eventually beheaded by the Duke of Aquitaine [https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=cKsWAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=GBS.PA98].

The '''''Flora Antarctica''''' or formally and correctly '''''The Botany of the Antarctic Voyage of H.M. Discovery Ships Erebus and Terror in the years 1839–1843, under the Command of Captain Sir James Clark Ross''''', is a description of the many plants discovered on the [[Ross expedition]], which visited islands off the coast of the Antarctic continent, with a summary of the expedition itself, written by [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] and published in parts between 1844 and 1859 by Reeve Brothers in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Dalton Hooker|year=1844 |title=Flora Antarctica, Volume 1, Parts 1-2, Flora Novae-Zelandiae - The Botany of  the Antarctic Voyage of H.M.

The botanical findings of the Ross expedition were published in four parts, the last two in two volumes each, making six volumes in all:

* Part I ''[[Flora of Lord Auckland and Campbell's Islands]]'' (1843–45)
* Part II ''[[Flora of Fuegia, the Falklands, Kerguellen's land, etc]]'' (1845–47)
* Part III ''[[Flora Novae-Zelandiae|Flora of New Zealand]]'' (1851–53) (2 vols)
* Part IV ''[[Flora Tasmaniae|Flora of Tasmania]]'' (1853–59) (2 vols)

All were "splendidly" illustrated by [[Walter Hood Fitch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Curtis |first1=Winifred M. |title=Hooker, Sir Joseph Dalton (1817-1911) |work=Australian Dictionary of Biography (Volume 4) |date=1972 |publisher=MUP |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hooker-sir-joseph-dalton-3789}}&lt;/ref&gt; The larger part of the plant specimens collected during this expedition are now part of the [[Kew Gardens#Herbarium|Kew Herbarium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=David Goyder |author2=Pat Griggs |author3=Mark Nesbitt |author4=Lynn Parker |author5=Kiri Ross-Jones |year=2012 |title=Sir Joseph Hooker's Collections at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew |journal=Curtis's Botanical Magazine |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=66–85 |url=http://www.kew.org/sites/default/files/assets/KPPCONT_085462.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hooker professed not to have changed his views on Darwin's theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]], the ''Flora of Tasmania'' contains an introductory essay on [[biogeography]] written from a Darwinian point of view, making the book the first case study for the theory.

[[File:Flora Antarctica Plate CLXV.CLXVI (lighter).jpg|thumb|The ships sailed through forests of ''Durvillea harveyi'' (now ''[[Durvillea antarctica]]'')]]

{{main article|Ross expedition}}

The British government fitted out [[Ross expedition|an expedition]] led by [[James Clark Ross]] to investigate magnetism and marine geography in high southern latitudes, which sailed with two ships, [[HMS Terror (1813)|HMS ''Terror'']] and [[HMS Erebus (1826)|HMS ''Erebus'']] on 29 September 1839 from Chatham.

The ships docked at [[Madeira]], [[Tenerife]], the [[Cape Verde]] archipelago, [[Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago]], [[Trindade and Martim Vaz|Trinidad]] to arrive at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on 4 April 1840. On 21 April the giant kelp ''[[Macrocystis pyrifera]]'' was found off [[Prince Edward Islands|Marion Island]], but no landfall could be made there or on the [[Crozet Islands]] due to the harsh winds. On 12 May the ships anchored at Christmas Harbour for two and a half months, during which all plants previously encountered by [[James Cook]] on the [[Kerguelen Islands]] were collected. On 20 July they sailed again to arrive on 16 August at the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|River Derwent]], to remain in Tasmania until 12 November. A week later the flotilla stopped at [[Auckland Islands|Lord Auckland's Islands]] and [[Campbell Island group|Campbell's Island]] for the spring months.

Large floating forests of ''Macrocystis'' and ''[[Durvillaea]]'' were found until the ships run into the icebergs at latitude 61° S. [[Drift ice|Pack-ice]] was met at 68° S and longitude 175°. During this part of the voyage [[Victoria Land]], [[Mount Erebus]] and [[Mount Terror (Antarctica)|Mount Terror]] were discovered. After returning to Tasmania for three months, the flotilla went via Sydney to the [[Bay of Islands]], and stayed for three months in New Zealand to collect the plants.

From 6 April 1842 a long stay in the [[Falkland Islands|Falklands]] began, where the flora was investigated to supplement the work of Admiral [[Jules Dumont d'Urville|D’Urville]] and of the crew of the [[Louis de Freycinet#Circumnavigation in the Uranie|Uranie]]. When visiting the [[Hermite Islands]], seedlings of the deciduous ''[[Nothofagus antarctica]]'' and the evergreen ''[[Nothofagus betuloides]]'' were collected from this  southernmost location of any tree (although currently neighboring [[Hoste Island]], slightly more to the North, is commonly mentioned as the southernmost location for trees). These were planted on the Falklands, and some were later brought to [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Kew]]. Other plants were also collected. On [[Cockburn Island (Antarctica)|Cockburn’s Island]] twenty [[cryptogam]] species were found. The ships returned to the Cape of Good Hope on 4 April 1843. At the end of the journey specimens of some fifteen hundred plant species had been collected and preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=J.D.

==Reception==

[[J. D. Hooker]] gave [[Charles Darwin]] a copy of (a draft of) the ''Flora''; Darwin thanked him, and agreed in November 1845 that the geographical distribution of organisms would be "the key which will unlock the mystery of species".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Darwin|first1=Charles|title=Letter from Darwin, C. R. to Hooker, J. D. on [5 or 12 Nov 1845] (MS DAR 114: 45, 45b)|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-DAR-00114-00045/1|publisher=[[University of Cambridge]]|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book remains important; for example, in 2013 W. H. Walton in his ''Antarctica: Global Science from a Frozen Continent'' describes it as "a major reference to this day", encompassing as it does "all the plants he found both in the Antarctic and on the sub-Antarctic islands", surviving better than Ross's deep-sea soundings which were made with "inadequate equipment".&lt;ref name="Walton2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=D. W. H. Walton|title=Antarctica: Global Science from a Frozen Continent|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Vg9A2N5I3wC&amp;pg=PA7|date=28 March 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-00392-7|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four parts of the ''Flora Antarctica'' total 6 volumes, describe about 3000 species, and contain 530 plates which figure 1095 of the species.

=== Flora of Lord Auckland and Campbell's Islands ===
{{main article|Flora of Lord Auckland and Campbell's Islands}}

Part I, published between 1843 and 1845, covers the ''[[Flora of Lord Auckland and Campbell's Islands]]''. It has 208 pages, 370 species, 80 plates and map, and figures 150 species.

=== Flora of Fuegia, the Falklands, Kerguellen's land, etc. ===
{{main article|Flora of Fuegia, the Falklands, Kerguellen's land, etc.}}

Part II, published between 1845 and 1847, covers the ''[[Flora of Fuegia, the Falklands, Kerguellen's land, etc.]]'' It has 366 pages, 1000 species, 120 plates, and figures 220 species.

According to Hooker, the flora of [[New Zealand]]'s Antarctic islands is so different from that of the remainder of the territories visited during the voyage, that it merits a separate description. An exemplary difference is the dominance of [[Asteraceae]] in New Zealand's islands, and absence of representatives of the [[Rubiaceae]], while the reverse is true for those two plant families on the other Antarctic archipelagos. So the ''Flora Antarctica'' describes in its second part the plants of [[Tierra del Fuego]] and the south-western coast of [[Patagonia]], the Falkland Islands, Palmer's Land, [[South Shetland Islands|South Shetlands]], [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]], [[Tristan da Cunha]], and Kerguellen's Land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= J.D. Hooker|year= 1844|title= Flora Antarctica, Volume 1, Parts 1-2, Flora Novae-Zelandiae|pages= 209–223|url= https://archive.org/stream/botanyofantarcti01hook#page/209/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flora Novae-Zelandiae===
{{main article|Flora Novae-Zelandiae}}

Part III, the ''Flora of New Zealand'' or ''Flora Nova-Zelandiae'', was published in two volumes between 1851 and 1853.

* Volume 1 [[Phanerogams]] (355 pages, 730 species, 70 plates, 83 species figured)
* Volume 2 [[Cryptogams]] (378 pages, 1037 species, 60 plates, 230 species figured)

=== Flora Tasmaniae ===
{{main article|Flora Tasmaniae}}

Part IV, the ''Flora of Tasmania'' or ''Flora Tasmaniae'' was published in two volumes between 1853 and 1859.

* Volume 1 [[Dicotyledones]] (550 pages, 758 species, 100 plates, 138 species figured)
* Volume 2 [[Monocotyledones]] and Acotyledones (422 pages, 1445 species, 100 plates, 274 species figured)

Hooker dedicated this Part to the local naturalists Ronald Campbell Gunn and William Archer, noting that "This Flora of Tasmania .. owes so much to their indefatigable exertions". Although the book is sometimes stated to have been published in 1859, the dedication is dated January 1860. It made use of plants collected by the local naturalist Robert Lawrence as well as Gunn and Archer.&lt;ref name=Cave&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cave |first1=E. C. |title=Flora Tasmaniae: Tasmanian naturalists and imperial botany, 1829-1860 (PhD Thesis)|url=http://eprints.utas.edu.au/14747/ |publisher=[[University of Tasmania]]|accessdate=29 February 2016 |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book begins with an "Introductory Essay" on [[biogeography]]. It is followed by a "Key to the Natural Orders of Tasmanian Flowering Plants" and a more detailed key to the genera. The Flora proper begins with the first order, the [[Ranunculaceae]].

''Flora Tasmaniae'' was "the first published case study supporting [[Charles Darwin]]’s theory of [[natural selection]]".&lt;ref name=Cave&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cave |first1=E.

While he asserted that "my own views on the subjects of the [[genetic variability|variability]] of existing species" remain "unaltered from those which I maintained in the '[[Flora Novae-Zelandiae|Flora of New Zealand]]'", the ''Flora Tasmaniae'' is written from a Darwinian perspective that effectively assumes natural selection, or as Hooker named it, the "variation" theory, to be correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Endersby |first1=Jim |title=What Made Darwinism Useful to Joseph Dalton Hooker? |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/botany/14.html |publisher=Victorian Web |accessdate=29 February 2016}} Extracted from the conclusion of ''Imperial Nature: Joseph Hooker and the Practices of Victorian Science'', University of Chicago Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wikipedia]] began with its launch on 15 January 2001, two days after the domain was registered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whois.domaintools.com/wikipedia.org|title=Wikipedia.org WHOIS, DNS, &amp; Domain Info – DomainTools|work=[[WHOIS]]|date= |accessdate=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Jimmy Wales]] and [[Larry Sanger]]. Its technological and conceptual underpinnings predate this; the earliest known proposal for an online encyclopedia was made by [[Rick Gates (Internet pioneer)|Rick Gates]] in 1993,&lt;ref name="listserv.uh.edu"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://history-computer.com/Internet/Conquering/Wikipedia.html | title= Wikipedia of Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger | publisher= History Computer | year= 2010 | accessdate= 9 November 2013 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120415133700/http://history-computer.com/Internet/Conquering/Wikipedia.html | archivedate= 15 April 2012 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the concept of a [[free as in freedom|free-as-in-freedom]] online encyclopedia (as [[Alternative terms for free software|distinct]] from mere [[Open-source model|open source]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html#open-source|title=Philosophy|publisher=GNU|accessdate=5 November 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014132149/http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html#open-source|archivedate=14 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; was proposed by [[Richard Stallman]] in December 2000.&lt;ref name = "stallmanencyclopedia" /&gt;

Crucially, Stallman's concept specifically included the idea that no central organization should control editing. This characteristic was in stark contrast to contemporary digital encyclopedias such as [[Encarta|Microsoft Encarta]], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', and even [[Bomis]]'s [[Nupedia]], which was Wikipedia's direct predecessor. In 2001, the license for Nupedia was changed to [[GFDL]], and Wales and Sanger launched Wikipedia using the concept and technology of a [[wiki]] pioneered in 1995 by [[Ward Cunningham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiHistory|title= WikiHistory|publisher= [[WikiWikiWeb]]|accessdate= 15 May 2013|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20020621221535/http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiHistory|archivedate= 21 June 2002|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Wikipedia was intended to complement Nupedia, an online encyclopedia project edited solely by experts, by providing additional draft articles and ideas for it. In practice, Wikipedia quickly overtook Nupedia, becoming a global project in multiple languages and inspiring a wide range of [[List of wikis|other online reference projects]].

==Historical overview==

===Background===
The concept of compiling the world's knowledge in a single location dates back to the ancient [[Library of Alexandria|Libraries of Alexandria]] and [[Library of Pergamum|Pergamum]], but the modern concept of a general-purpose, widely distributed, printed [[encyclopedia]] originated with [[Denis Diderot]] and the 18th-century French [[Encyclopédie|encyclopedists]]. The idea of using automated machinery beyond the [[printing press]] to build a more useful encyclopedia can be traced to [[Paul Otlet]]'s 1934 book ''Traité de documentation''; Otlet also founded the [[Mundaneum]], an institution dedicated to indexing the world's knowledge, in 1910. This concept of a machine-assisted encyclopedia was further expanded in [[H. G. Wells]]' book of essays ''[[World Brain]]'' (1938) and [[Vannevar Bush]]'s future vision of the [[microfilm]]-based [[Memex]] in his essay "[[As We May Think]]" (1945).&lt;ref name =reaglechap2&gt;Reagle, Joseph (2010). ''Good Faith Collaboration.  The Culture of Wikipedia''. MIT Press. {{ISBN|978-0-262-01447-2}}. Chapter 2: "The Pursuit of the Universal Encyclopedia".&lt;/ref&gt; Another milestone was [[Ted Nelson]]'s [[hypertext]] design [[Project Xanadu]], which was begun in 1960.&lt;ref name=reaglechap2/&gt;

Advances in information technology in the late 20th century led to changes in the form of encyclopedias. While previous encyclopedias, notably the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', were book-based, Microsoft's [[Encarta]], published in 1993, was available on CD-ROM and [[hyperlink]]ed. The development of the [[World Wide Web]] led to many attempts to develop [[internet encyclopedia project]]s. An early proposal for a web-based encyclopedia was [[Interpedia]] in 1993 by [[Rick Gates (Internet pioneer)|Rick Gates]];&lt;ref name="listserv.uh.edu"/&gt; this project died before generating any encyclopedic content. [[Free software]] proponent [[Richard Stallman]] described the usefulness of a "Free Universal Encyclopedia and Learning Resource" in 1999.&lt;ref name="stallmanencyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/anencyc.txt|title=The Free Universal Encyclopedia and Learning Resource|publisher=GNU|last=Stallman|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Stallman|date=18 December 2000|accessdate=11 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329165205/http://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/anencyc.txt|archivedate=29 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His published document "aims to lay out what the free encyclopedia needs to do, what sort of freedoms it needs to give the public, and how we can get started on developing it." On Wednesday 17 January 2001, two days after the founding of Wikipedia, the [[Free Software Foundation]]'s (FSF) [[GNUPedia]] project went online, competing with [[Nupedia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=9990&amp;threshold=1&amp;commentsort=0&amp;mode=thread&amp;cid=502603 |title=Slashdot Comments &amp;#124; GNUPedia Project Starting |publisher=Slashdot.org |date=17 January 2001 |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but today the FSF encourages people "to visit and contribute to [Wikipedia]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/|title=The Free Encyclopedia Project|publisher=GNU.org|origyear=1999|year=2012|accessdate=20 December 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221000617/http://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/|archivedate=21 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formulation of the concept===
Wikipedia was initially conceived as a feeder project for the Wales-founded [[Nupedia]], an earlier project to produce a free online encyclopedia, volunteered by [[Bomis]], a web-advertising firm owned by [[Jimmy Wales]], [[Tim Shell]] and [[Michael E. Davis]].&lt;ref name="thehive"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jonathan Sidener"&gt;{{cite news

Business Horizons, Volume 57 Issue 5, pp.617–626&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its mailing list of interested editors, and the presence of a full-time editor-in-chief, [[Larry Sanger]], a graduate [[philosophy]] student hired by Wales,&lt;ref name="resignation"&gt;[https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=My_resignation--Larry_Sanger&amp;oldid=523212 My resignation: Larry Sanger] (meta.wikimedia.com) – "I was more or less offered the job of editing Nupedia when I was, as an ABD philosophy graduate student, soliciting Jimbo's (and other friends') advice on a website I was thinking of starting.

Wales and Sanger discussed various ways to create content more rapidly.&lt;ref name="Jonathan Sidener"/&gt; The idea of a [[wiki]]-based complement originated from a conversation between Larry M. Sanger and Ben Kovitz.&lt;ref name="Ben_Kovitz"&gt;{{cite news

}}-- While casting around for a way to speed up article production, Sanger met with Ben Kovitz, an old friend, in January 2001. Kovitz introduced Sanger to the idea of the wiki, invented in 1995 by Ward Cunningham: web pages that anyone could write and edit. "My first reaction was that this really could be what would solve the problem," Sanger explains, "because the software was already written, and this community of people on WikiWikiWeb" – the first wiki – "had created something like 14,000 pages". Nupedia, by contrast, had produced barely two dozen articles. Sanger took up the idea immediately: "I wrote up a proposal and sent it [to Wales] that evening, and the wiki was then set up for me to work on." But this was not Wikipedia as we know it. "Originally it was the Nupedia Wiki – our idea was to use it as an article incubator for Nupedia. Articles could begin life on this wiki, be developed collaboratively and, when they got to a certain stage of development, be put it into the Nupedia system."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Origins_of_Wikipedia"&gt;{{cite news

}}-- Over tacos that night, Sanger explained his concerns about Nupedia's lack of progress, the root cause of which was its serial editorial system. As Nupedia was then structured, no stage of the editorial process could proceed before the previous stage was completed. Kovitz brought up the wiki and sketched out "[[wiki magic]]", the mysterious process by which communities with common interests work to improve wiki pages by incremental contributions. If it worked for the rambunctious hacker culture of programming, Kovitz said, it could work for any online collaborative project. The wiki could break the Nupedia bottleneck by permitting volunteers to work simultaneously all over the project. With Kovitz in tow, Sanger rushed back to his apartment and called Wales to share the idea. Over the next few days he wrote a formal proposal for Wales and started a page on Cunningham's wiki called "WikiPedia."&lt;/ref&gt; Wales first stated, in October 2001, that "Larry had the idea to use Wiki software",&lt;ref name="wikipedia-l-000671"/&gt; though he later stated in December 2005 that Jeremy Rosenfeld, a Bomis employee, introduced him to the concept.&lt;ref name="Wired News"&gt;

Under the subject "Let's make a wiki", he wrote:

{{quote|No, this is not an indecent proposal. It's an idea to add a little feature to Nupedia. Jimmy Wales thinks that many people might find the idea objectionable, but I think not... As to Nupedia's use of a wiki, this is the ULTIMATE "open" and simple format for developing content. We have occasionally bandied about ideas for simpler, more open projects to either replace or supplement Nupedia. It seems to me wikis can be implemented practically instantly, need very little maintenance, and in general are very low-risk. They're also a potentially great source for content. So there's little downside, as far as I can determine.}}

===Founding of Wikipedia===
There was considerable resistance on the part of Nupedia's editors and reviewers to the idea of associating Nupedia with a wiki-style website. Sanger suggested giving the new project its own name, ''Wikipedia'', and Wikipedia was soon launched on its own domain, &lt;tt&gt;wikipedia.com&lt;/tt&gt;, on Monday 15 January 2001. The [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] and [[server (computing)|server]] (located in San Diego) used for these initial projects were donated by Bomis. Many former Bomis employees later contributed content to the encyclopedia: notably [[Tim Shell]], co-founder and later CEO of Bomis, and programmer Jason Richey.

Wales stated in December 2008 that he made Wikipedia's first edit, a test edit with the text "[[Hello, World]]!", but this edit may have been to an old version of Wikipedia which soon after was scrapped and replaced by a restart;&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=258632986 Message by Jimmy Wales] Wednesday 17 December 2008.

The project gained its 1,000th article around Monday 12 February 2001, and reached 10,000 articles around 7 September. In the first year of its existence, over 20,000 encyclopedia entries were created – a rate of over 1,500 articles per month. On Friday 30 August 2002, the article count reached 40,000.

Wikipedia's earliest edits were long believed lost, since the original [[UseModWiki]] software deleted old data after about a month. On Tuesday 14 December 2010, developer Tim Starling found backups on [[SourceForge]] containing every change made to Wikipedia from its creation in January 2001 to 17 August 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2010-December/063088.html Announcement of finding of Wikipedia's earliest history].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2002, Sanger and Wales differed in their views on how best to manage open encyclopedias. Both still supported the open-collaboration concept, but the two disagreed on how to handle disruptive editors, specific roles for experts, and the best way to guide the project to success.

Wales went on to establish self-governance and [[Business development|bottom-up]] self-direction by editors on Wikipedia. He made it clear that he would not be involved in the community's day-to-day management, but would encourage it to learn to self-manage and find its own best approaches. {{as of|2007}}, Wales mostly restricts his own role to occasional input on serious matters, executive activity, advocacy of knowledge, and encouragement of similar reference projects.

Sanger says he is an "inclusionist" and is open to almost anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that experts still have a place in the [[Web 2.0]] world. He returned briefly to academia, then joined the [[Digital Universe]] Foundation. In 2006, Sanger founded [[Citizendium]], an open encyclopedia that used real names for contributors in an effort to reduce disruptive editing, and hoped to facilitate "gentle expert guidance" to increase the accuracy of its content. Decisions about article content were to be up to the community, but the site was to include a statement about "family-friendly content".&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/CZ:Family-Friendly_Policy "Family-Friendly Policy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120030154/http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/CZ:Family-Friendly_Policy |date=20 November 2010 }}. en.citizendium.org.

===Organization===
The Wikipedia project has grown rapidly in the course of its life, at several levels. Content has grown organically through the addition of new articles, new wikis have been added in English and non-English languages, and entire new projects replicating these growth methods in other related areas (news, quotations, reference books and so on) have been founded as well. Wikipedia itself has grown, with the creation of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] to act as an umbrella body and the growth of software and policies to address the needs of the editorial community. These are documented below:

====2000====
[[File:Bomis-staff-summer-2000.jpg|thumb|alt=The Bomis staff, summer 2000|Bomis staff in the summer of 2000]]
In March 2000, the [[Nupedia]] project was started. Its intention was to publish articles written by experts which would be licensed as [[free content]]. Nupedia was founded by Jimmy Wales, with Larry Sanger as editor-in-chief, and funded by the web-advertising company [[Bomis]].&lt;ref name="hive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200609/wikipedia/|title=The Hive|last=Poe|first=Marshall|publisher=[[The Atlantic]]|date=September 2006|accessdate=1 January 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061223004004/http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200609/wikipedia|archivedate=23 December 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Wikipedia, anyone can write about any subject they know about. The idea is that over time, enough experts will offer their knowledge for free and build up the world's ultimate hand-built database of knowledge. The disadvantage is that it's still an ongoing project. So far about 8,000 articles have been written and the editors are aiming for 100,000.")&lt;/ref&gt; The [[September 11 attacks]] spurred the appearance of breaking news stories on the homepage, as well as information boxes linking related articles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20011010233257/http://www.wikipedia.com/ October 2001 homepage screenshot] shows the "Breaking News" header up top, as well as 11 September 2001 block of articles under "Current events"; the [https://web.archive.org/web/20011010230439/http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/September_11%2C_2001_Terrorist_Attack 9/11 page] shows the activist nature of the page, as well as the large number of subtopics created to cover the event.&lt;/ref&gt;

====2002====
2002 saw the end of funding for Wikipedia from [[Bomis]] and the departure of [[Larry Sanger]]. The [[fork (software development)|forking]] of the [[Spanish Wikipedia]] also took place with the establishment of the ''[[Enciclopedia Libre]]''. The first portable [[MediaWiki]] software went live on 25 January. [[Internet bot|Bots]] were introduced, Jimmy Wales confirmed that Wikipedia would never run commercial advertising, and the first sister project ([[Wiktionary]]) and first formal [[Manual of Style]] were launched. A separate board of directors to supervise the project was proposed and initially discussed at [[Meta-Wikipedia]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

====2003====
The English Wikipedia passed 100,000 articles in 2003, while the next largest edition, the German Wikipedia, passed 10,000. The [[Wikimedia Foundation]] was established, and Wikipedia adopted its jigsaw world [[logo]]. Mathematical formulae using [[TeX]] were reintroduced to the website. The [[:de:Wikipedia:Stammtisch München/Archiv/2003|first Wikipedian social meeting]] took place in [[Munich]], Germany, in October. The basic principles of Wikipedia's {{srlink|Wikipedia:ArbCom|Arbitration system and committee}} (known colloquially as "ArbCom") were developed, mostly by {{srlink|User:Florence Devouard|Florence Devouard}}, {{srlink|User:Fred Bauder|Fred Bauder}} and other early Wikipedians.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

[[Wikisource]] was created as a separate project on 24 November 2003, to host free textual sources.

====2004====
The worldwide Wikipedia article pool continued to grow rapidly in 2004, doubling in size in 12 months, from under 500,000 articles in late 2003 to over 1&amp;nbsp;million in over 100 languages by the end of 2004. The English Wikipedia accounted for just under half of these articles. The website's [[server farm]]s were moved from [[California]] to [[Florida]], {{srlink|Wikipedia:Categories|Categories}} and [[CSS]] style configuration sheets were introduced, and the first attempt to block Wikipedia occurred, with the website being blocked in China for two weeks in June. The formal election of a board and Arbitration Committee began. The first formal projects were proposed to deliberately balance content and seek out [[systemic bias]] arising from Wikipedia's community structure.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

[[Wikimedia Commons]] was created on 7 September 2004 to host media files for Wikipedia in all languages.

====2005====
In 2005, Wikipedia became the most popular reference website on the Internet, according to [[Hitwise]], with the English Wikipedia alone exceeding 750,000 articles. Wikipedia's first multilingual and subject portals were established in 2005. A formal fundraiser held in the first quarter of the year raised almost US$100,000 for system upgrades to handle growing demand. China again blocked Wikipedia in October 2005.

The first major Wikipedia scandal, the [[Seigenthaler incident]], occurred in 2005, when a well-known figure was found to have a vandalized biography which had gone unnoticed for months. In the wake of this and other concerns,&lt;ref name="Brandt"&gt;[[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|WP:BLP]] was started on 17 December 2005, with the narrative "I started this due to the Daniel Brandt situation". [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons&amp;oldid=31753956 Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons]&lt;/ref&gt; the first policy and system changes specifically designed to counter this form of abuse were established. These included a new [[m:CheckUser policy|Checkuser]] privilege policy update to assist in [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|sock puppetry]] investigations, a new feature called {{srlink|Wikipedia:Requests for page protection|semi-protection}}, a more strict policy on biographies of living people and the tagging of such articles for stricter review. A restriction of new article creation to registered users only was put in place in December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/Growing-pains-for-Wikipedia---page-2/2100-1025_3-5981119-2.html?tag=mncol "Growing pains for Wikipedia"].

Wikimania 2005, the first [[Wikimania]] conference, was held from 4 to 8 August 2005 at the ''Haus der Jugend'' in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, attracting about 380 attendees.

====2006====
The English Wikipedia gained its one-millionth article, [[Jordanhill railway station]], on 1 March 2006. The first approved Wikipedia article selection was made freely available to download, and "Wikipedia" became registered as a trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation. The [[congressional staffer edits to Wikipedia|congressional aides biography scandals]] – multiple incidents in which congressional staffers and a campaign manager were caught trying to covertly alter Wikipedia biographies – came to public attention, leading to the resignation of the campaign manager. Nonetheless, Wikipedia was rated as one of the top five global brands of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070321033410/http://www.brandchannel.com/start1.asp?fa_id=352 Similar Search Results: Google Wins] 29 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Jimmy Wales indicated at [[Wikimania 2006]] that Wikipedia had achieved sufficient volume and called for an emphasis on quality, perhaps best expressed in the call for [[Wikipedia:100,000 feature-quality articles|100,000 feature-quality articles]]. A new privilege, "oversight", was created, allowing specific versions of archived pages with unacceptable content to be marked as non-viewable. Semi-protection against anonymous vandalism, introduced in 2005, proved more popular than expected, with over 1,000 pages being semi-protected at any given time in 2006.

====2007====
Wikipedia continued to grow rapidly in 2007, possessing over 5&amp;nbsp;million registered editor accounts by 13 August.&lt;ref&gt;See the special page: [[Special:Statistics]]: 5,078,036 registered user accounts as at 13 August 2007, excluding anonymous editors who have not created accounts.&lt;/ref&gt; The 250 language editions of Wikipedia contained a combined total of 7.5&amp;nbsp;million articles, totalling 1.74&amp;nbsp;billion words, by 13 August.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[Wikipedia:Size comparisons]] as of 13 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The English Wikipedia gained articles at a steady rate of 1,700 a day,&lt;ref&gt;From around Q3 2006 Wikipedia's growth rate has been approximately linear, source: [[Wikipedia:Statistics]] – new article count by month 2006–2007.&lt;/ref&gt; with the wikipedia.org domain name ranked the 10th-busiest in the world. Wikipedia continued to garner visibility in [[:Category:Wikipedia publicity|the press]] – the [[Essjay controversy]] broke when a prominent member of Wikipedia was found to have lied about his credentials. [[Citizendium]], a competing online encyclopedia, launched publicly. A new trend developed in Wikipedia, with the encyclopedia addressing people whose notability stemmed from being a participant in a news story by adding a redirect from their name to the larger story, rather than creating a distinct biographical article.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., cases such as [[Crystal Gail Mangum]] and Daniel Brandt.&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 September 2007, the English Wikipedia gained its two-millionth article, [[El Hormiguero]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Press_releases/Wikipedia_Reaches_2_Million_Articles "English Wikipedia Reaches 2 Million Articles"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708005830/https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Press_releases/Wikipedia_Reaches_2_Million_Articles |date=8 July 2017 }}.

According to the ''[[MIT Technology Review]]'', the number of regularly active editors on the English-language Wikipedia peaked in 2007 at more than 51,000, and has since been declining.&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simonite |first=Tom |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/520446/the-decline-of-wikipedia/ |title=The Decline of Wikipedia |date=22 October 2013 |journal=[[MIT Technology Review]] |accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2008====
Various {{srlink|Wikipedia:WikiProject|WikiProjects}} in many areas continued to expand and refine article contents within their scope. In April 2008, the 10-millionth Wikipedia article was created, and by the end of the year the English Wikipedia exceeded 2.5&amp;nbsp;million articles.

On 24 March, the European Wikipedia servers went offline due to an overheating problem. [[Failover]] to servers in Florida turned out to be broken, causing [[Domain Name System|DNS]] resolution for Wikipedia to fail across the world.

==History by subject area==

===Hardware and software===
{{Main|MediaWiki}}

:''The [[software]] that runs Wikipedia, and the [[computer hardware]], [[server farm]]s and other systems upon which Wikipedia relies.''
* In January 2001, Wikipedia ran on [[UseModWiki]], written in [[Perl]] by [[Clifford Adams]]. The server has run on [[Linux]] to this day, although the original text was stored in files rather than in a database. Articles were named with the [[CamelCase]] convention.
* In January 2002, "Phase II" of the wiki software powering Wikipedia was introduced, replacing the older [[UseModWiki]]. Written specifically for the project by [[Magnus Manske]], it included a [[PHP]] [[wiki engine]].
* In July 2002, a [[rewrite (programming)|major rewrite]] of the software powering Wikipedia went live; dubbed "Phase III", it replaced the older "Phase II" version, and became [[MediaWiki]]. It was written by [[Lee Daniel Crocker]] in response to the increasing demands of the growing project.
* In October 2002, Derek Ramsey created a [[internet bot|bot]]—an automated program called [[Rambot]]—to add a large number of articles about United States towns; these articles were automatically generated from [[U.S. census]] data. He thus increased the number of Wikipedia articles by 33,832.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lih|first=Andrew|title=The Wikipedia Revolution|date=17 March 2009|publisher=Hachette Digital, Inc|isbn=9781401395858|pages=99–106|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AWuZAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Derek+Ramsey+%28Wikipedian%29%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Derek%20Ramsey%20%28Wikipedian%29%22&amp;f=false|authorlink=Andrew Lih}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been called "the most controversial move in Wikipedia history".&lt;ref&gt;Lih, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In January 2003, support for mathematical formulas in [[TeX]] was added. The code was contributed by Tomasz Wegrzanowski.
* On 9 June 2003, Wikipedia's [[ISBN]] interface was amended to make ISBNs in articles link to Special:Booksources, which fetches its contents from the user-editable page {{srlink|Wikipedia:Book sources|Wikipedia:Book sources}}. Before this, ISBN link targets were coded into the software and new ones were suggested on the {{srlink|Wikipedia:ISBN|Wikipedia:ISBN}} page. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AISBN&amp;diff=1029062&amp;oldid=1024040 the edit] that changed this.
* After 6 December 2003, various system messages shown to Wikipedia users were no longer [[hard coding|hard coded]], allowing Wikipedia {{srlink|Wikipedia:Administrators|administrators}} to modify certain parts of MediaWiki's interface, such as the message shown to blocked users.
* On 12 February 2004, server operations were moved from [[San Diego, California]] to [[Tampa, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2004-February/008418.html | accessdate =10 February 2007 | title = Server swapping soon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 29 May 2004, all the various websites were updated to a new version of the [[MediaWiki]] software.
* On 30 May 2004, the first instances of "categorization" entries appeared. Category schemes, like Recent Changes and Edit This Page, had existed from the founding of Wikipedia. However, Larry Sanger had viewed the schemes as lists, and even hand-entered articles, whereas the [[categorization]] effort centered on individual categorization entries in each article of the encyclopedia, as part of a larger automatic categorization of the articles of the encyclopedia.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Wikipedia:Categorization]]", Wikipedia. Retrieved on 30 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* After 3 June 2004, administrators could edit the style of the interface by changing the [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] in the monobook stylesheet at [[MediaWiki:Monobook.css]].
* Also on 30 May 2004, with MediaWiki 1.3, the Template namespace was created, allowing [[transclusion]] of standard texts.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Wikipedia:Template namespace]]", Wikipedia. Retrieved on 17 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 7 June 2005 at 3:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Standard Time]], the bulk of the Wikimedia servers were moved to a new facility across the street. All Wikimedia projects were down during this time.
* In March 2013, the first phase of the [[Wikidata]] interwiki database became available across Wikipedia's language editions.&lt;ref name=WikidataLiveNow/&gt;
* In July 2013, the VisualEditor editing interface was inaugurated, allowing users to edit Wikipedia using a [[WYSIWYG]] text editor (similar to a [[word processor]]) instead of [[wikimarkup]].&lt;ref name=VisualEd2013&gt;{{cite news|title=Boot up: wireless contact lens, Wikipedia's visual editing, Samsung's share slide and more|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/jul/02/rabbit-contact-lens|work=The Guardian|date=2 July 2013|accessdate=2 July 2013|location=London|first=Charles|last=Arthur|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104201314/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/jul/02/rabbit-contact-lens|archivedate=4 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; An editing interface optimised for mobile devices was also released.&lt;ref name=MobileWiki2013/&gt;

===Look and feel===

:''The external face of Wikipedia, its [[look and feel]], and the Wikipedia [[brand]]ing, as presented to users.''
* On 4 April 2002, BrilliantProse, since renamed Featured Articles,&lt;ref&gt;"[[Wikipedia:Featured articles]]". Wikipedia. Retrieved 30 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; was moved to the Wikipedia namespace from the article namespace.
* Around 15 October 2003, a new Wikipedia logo was installed. The logo concept was selected by a voting process,&lt;ref name="logovote"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/International_logo_vote/Finalists| title = International logo vote/Finalists| accessdate = 8 July 2006| work = Meta-Wiki| publisher = Wikimedia| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060716073834/http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/International_logo_vote/Finalists| archivedate = 16 July 2006| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was followed by a revision process to select the best variant. The final selection was created by David Friedland (who edits Wikipedia under the username ''"nohat"'') based on a logo design and concept created by Paul Stansifer.
* On 22 February 2004, Did You Know (DYK) made [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Did_you_know&amp;oldid=2500457 its first Main Page appearance.]
* On 23 February 2004, a coordinated new look for the Main Page appeared [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Main_Page&amp;oldid=2500386 at 19:46 UTC]. Hand-chosen entries for the Daily Featured Article, Anniversaries, In the News, and Did You Know rounded out the new look.
* On 10 January 2005, the multilingual portal at [http://www.wikipedia.org/ www.wikipedia.org] was set up, replacing a redirect to the English-language Wikipedia.
* On 5 February 2005, {{srlink|Portal:Biology|Portal:Biology}} was created, becoming the first thematic "portal" on the English Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Portal:Biology]]". English Wikipedia. Retrieved 31 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the concept was pioneered on the German Wikipedia, where [[:de:Portal:Recht|Portal:Recht]] (law studies) was set up in October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Wikipedia:WikiProjekt Portale/2003|Portals on German Wikipedia ordered by date of creation]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 16 July 2005, the English Wikipedia began the practice of including the day's "featured pictures" on the Main Page.
* On 19 March 2006, following a vote, the Main Page of the English-language Wikipedia featured its first redesign in nearly two years.
* On 13 May 2010, the site released a new interface. New features included an updated logo, new navigation tools, and a link wizard.&lt;ref name="New features"/&gt; The "classic" Wikipedia interface remained available as an option.

===Internal structures===

:''Landmarks in the Wikipedia community, and the development of its organization, [[Wikipedia:Administration|internal structures]], and [[Wikipedia:Policy|policies]].''
* April 2001, Wales formally defines the "neutral point of view",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/NeutralPointOfView |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010416035757/http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/NeutralPointOfView |archivedate=16 April 2001 |title=NeutralPointOfView |publisher=Wikipedia |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wikipedia's core non-negotiable editorial policy,&lt;ref&gt;"A few things are absolute and non-negotiable, though.

* In September 2001, collaboration by subject matter in {{srlink|Wikipedia:WikiProject|WikiProjects}} is introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_proposal |title=Wikipedia:WikiProject proposal – Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |work=English Wikipedia |date=18 May 2008 |accessdate=13 April 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506091041/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_proposal |archivedate=6 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In February 2002, concerns over the risk of future censorship and commercialization by Bomis Inc (Wikipedia's original host) combined with a lack of guarantee this would not happen, led most participants of the [[:es:|Spanish Wikipedia]] to break away and establish it independently as the ''[[Enciclopedia Libre]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://enciclopedia.us.es/index.php/Enciclopedia:Por_qu%E9_estamos_aqu%ED_y_no_en_es.wikipedia.org Why we are here and not in Wikipedia]'' (in Spanish, under GFDL)&lt;/ref&gt; Following clarification of Wikipedia's status and non-commercial nature later that year, re-merger talks between Enciclopedia Libre and the re-founded Spanish Wikipedia occasionally took place in 2002 and 2003, but no conclusion was reached. As of October 2009, the two continue to coexist as substantial Spanish language reference sources, with around 43,000 articles (EL) and 520,000 articles (Sp.W)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Especial:Statistics |title=Estadísticas – Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre |language=es |publisher=Es.wikipedia.org |accessdate=13 April 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905112951/http://es.wikipedia.org./wiki/Especial:Statistics |archivedate=5 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.
* Also in 2002, policy and style issues were clarified with the creation of the ''Manual of Style'', along with a number of other policies and guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=171151 First substantial edit to Wikipedia:Manual of Style], Wikipedia (23 August 2002). Retrieved on 30 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* November 2002 – new mailing lists for WikiEN and Announce are set up, as well as other language mailing lists (e.g. Polish), to reduce the volume of traffic on mailing lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikimedia_News/2002&amp;oldid=486954 |title=Wikimedia News/2002 – Meta |publisher=Meta.wikimedia.org |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In July 2003, the rule against editing one's [[Wikipedia:autobiography|autobiography]] is introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Autobiography&amp;oldid=1220207 |title=Wikipedia:Autobiography – Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date=30 July 2003 |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 28 October 2003, the first "real" meeting of Wikipedians happened in [[Munich]]. Many cities followed suit, and soon a number of regular Wikipedian get-togethers were established around the world. Several Internet communities, including one on the popular [[blog]] website [[LiveJournal]], have also sprung up since.
* From 10 July to 30 August 2004 the {{srlink|Wikipedia:Browse}} and {{srlink|Wikipedia:Browse by overview}} formerly on the Main Page were replaced by links to overviews. On 27 August 2004 the ''Community Portal'' was started,&lt;ref&gt;"[[Wikipedia:Community Portal]]", Wikipedia. Retrieved on 30 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; to serve as a focus for community efforts. These were previously accomplished on an informal basis, by individual queries of the Recent Changes, in wiki style, as ad-hoc collaborations between like-minded editors.
* During September to December 2005 following the [[Seigenthaler controversy]] and other similar concerns,&lt;ref name="Brandt" /&gt; several anti-abuse features and policies were added to Wikipedia. These were:
::* The [[meta:CheckUser Policy|policy for "Checkuser"]] (a [[MediaWiki]] [[software tool|extension]] to assist detection of abuse via [[sock puppet (Internet)|internet sock-puppetry]]) was established in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;"[[meta:CheckUser policy|CheckUser policy]]", [[Meta-Wiki]]. Retrieved on 25 January 2007. Checkuser function had previously existed, but was known as ''Espionage'' – for example, in the Arbitration Committee [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2005-09-26/Arbitration report|case of JarlaxleArtemis]].&lt;/ref&gt; Checkuser function had previously existed, but was viewed more as a system tool at the time, so there had been no need for a policy covering use on a more routine basis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2005-10-17/News and notes|Checkuser proposal]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved on 31 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
::* The introduction and rapid adoption of the policy [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living people]], giving a far tighter quality control and fact-check system to biographical articles related to living people.

Retrieved on 30 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing pages to be protected so that only those with an account could edit.
* In May 2006, a new "oversight" feature was introduced on the English Wikipedia, allowing a handful of highly trusted users to permanently erase page revisions containing copyright infringements or libelous or personal information from a page's history. Previous to this, page version deletion was laborious, and also deleted versions remained visible to other administrators and could be un-deleted by them.
* On 1 January 2007, the subcommunity named [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|Esperanza]] was disbanded by communal consent. Esperanza had begun as an effort to promote "[[Wikipedia:Wikilove|wikilove]]" and a social support network, but had developed its own subculture and private structures.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2007-01-02/Experanza|Esperanza organization disbanded after deletion discussion]] 2 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ezperanza"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:MFD/EA |title=Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:Esperanza – Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its disbanding was described as the painful but necessary remedy for a project that had allowed editors to "see themselves as Esperanzans first and foremost".&lt;ref name="Ezperanza" /&gt; A number of Esperanza's subprojects were integrated back into Wikipedia as free-standing projects, but most of them are now inactive. When the group was founded in September 2005, there had been concerns expressed that it would eventually be condemned as such.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2005-09-19/Esperanza group|New group aims to promote Wiki-Love]] 19 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2007 the results of 4 months policy review by a working group of several hundred editors seeking to merge the core Wikipedia policies into one core policy (See: [[Wikipedia:Attribution]]) was polled for community support. The proposal did not gain consensus; a significant view became evident that the existing structure of three strong focused policies covering the respective areas of policy, was frequently seen as more helpful to quality control than one more general merged proposal.
* A one-day blackout of Wikipedia was called by [[Jimmy Wales]] on 18 January 2012, in conjunction with [[Google]] and over 7,000 other websites, to protest the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] then under consideration by the [[United States Congress]].

===The Wikimedia Foundation and legal structures===

:''Legal and organizational structure of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], its executive, and its activities as a [[foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundation]].''
* In August 2002, shortly after Jimmy Wales announced that he would never run commercial [[advertisement]]s on Wikipedia, the [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] of Wikipedia was changed from ''wikipedia.com'' to ''wikipedia.org'' (see: [[.com]] and [[.org]]).

===Fundraising===

Every year, Wikipedia runs a fundraising campaign to support its operations.

===External impact===
* In 2007, Wikipedia was deemed fit to be used as a major source by the [[UK Intellectual Property Office]] in a [[Formula One]] trademark case ruling.&lt;ref&gt;In deciding [http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tm/t-decisionmaking/t-challenge/t-challenge-decision-results/o16907.pdf the trademark of F1 racing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031053106/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tm/t-decisionmaking/t-challenge/t-challenge-decision-results/o16907.pdf |date=31 October 2007 }}, the [[UK Intellectual Property Office]] considered both the reliability of Wikipedia, and its usefulness as a reliable source of evidence:
: "Wikipedia has sometimes suffered from the self-editing that is intrinsic to it, giving rise at times to potentially [[libel]]lous statements. However, inherently, I cannot see that what is in Wikipedia is any less likely to be true than what is published in a book or on the websites of news organisations. [Formula One's lawyer] did not express any concerns about the Wikipedia evidence [presented by the plaintiff]. I consider that the evidence from Wikipedia can be taken at face value."
The case turned substantively upon evidence cited from Wikipedia in 2006 as to the usage and interpretation of the term "F1".&lt;/ref&gt;
* Over time, Wikipedia gained recognition amongst more traditional media as a "key source" for major new events, such as the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] and related [[tsunami]], the [[2008 American Presidential election]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/16/AR2007091601699.html?hpid=topnews "On Wikipedia, Debating 2008 Hopefuls' Every Facet"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103053949/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/16/AR2007091601699.html?hpid=topnews |date=3 November 2012 }}. ''Washington Post''. 17 September 2007. "...at the same time, it's hard to find a more up-to-date, detailed, thorough article on [[Barack Obama|Obama]] than Wikipedia's. As of Friday, Obama's article – more than 22 pages long, with 15 sections covering his personal and professional life – had a reference list of 167 sources."&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2007 [[Virginia Tech massacre]]. The latter article was accessed 750,000 times in two days, with newspapers published local to the shootings adding that "Wikipedia has emerged as the clearinghouse for detailed information on the event."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberjournalist.net/news/004178.php "Wikipedia emerges as key source for Virginia Tech shootings"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022200632/http://cyberjournalist.net/news/004178.php |date=22 October 2007 }}. ''[[The New York Times]]'' via Cyberjournalist.net. 2007. "Even ''[[The Roanoke Times]]'', which is published near [[Blacksburg, Virginia|Blacksburg, Va.]], where the university is located, noted on Thursday that Wikipedia 'has emerged as the clearinghouse for detailed information on the event'."&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 21 February 2007, Noam Cohen of the ''New York Times'' reported that some academics were banning the use of Wikipedia as a research tool.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/education/21wikipedia.html "A History Department Bans Citing Wikipedia as a Research Source"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331235327/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/education/21wikipedia.html |date=31 March 2017 }}. ''New York Times''. 21 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 27 February 2007, an article in ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' newspaper reported that some professors at [[Harvard University]] included Wikipedia in their [[syllabus|syllabi]], but that there was a split in their perception of using Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;Child, Maxwell L.

''The Harvard Crimson''. 26 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In July 2013, a large-scale study by four major universities identified the most [[Wikipedia:Edit warring|contested]] articles on Wikipedia, finding that [[Israel]], [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[God]] were more fiercely debated than any other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23354613|title=Wikipedia 'edit wars' revealed|publisher=BBC|date=18 July 2013|accessdate=18 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718164809/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23354613|archivedate=18 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effect of biographical articles====

Because Wikipedia biographies are often updated as soon as new information comes to light, they are often used as a reference source on the lives of [[:Category:Living people|notable people]]. This has led to attempts to manipulate and falsify Wikipedia articles for promotional or defamatory purposes (see [[#Controversies|Controversies]]). It has also led to novel uses of the biographical material provided. Some notable people's lives are being affected by their Wikipedia biography.
* November 2005: The [[Wikipedia biography controversy|Seigenthaler controversy]] occurred when a hoaxer asserted on Wikipedia that journalist John Seigenthaler had been involved in the [[Kennedy assassination]] of 1963.
* December 2006: German comedian [[Atze Schröder]] sued Arne Klempert, secretary of [[Wikimedia Deutschland]], because he did not want his real name published in Wikipedia. Schröder later withdrew his complaint, but wanted his attorney's costs to be paid by Klempert. A court decided that the artist had to cover those costs by himself.&lt;ref&gt;"Atze muss zahlen", Klemperts' blog "recent changes" on 27 June 2007: [http://recentchanges.de/blog/2007/06/atze-muss-zahlen/ Recentchanges.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801090032/http://recentchanges.de/blog/2007/06/atze-muss-zahlen/ |date=1 August 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 16 February 2007: Turkish historian [[Taner Akçam]] was briefly detained upon arrival at [[Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport]] because of false information on his Wikipedia biography claiming he was a terrorist.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/fisk/article2469270.ece "Caught in the deadly web of the internet"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001000113/http://news.independent.co.uk/fisk/article2469270.ece |date=1 October 2007 }}.

* November 2008: The German [[The Left (Germany)|Left Party]] politician [[Lutz Heilmann]] claimed that some remarks in his Wikipedia article caused damage to his reputation. He succeeded in getting a court order to make Wikimedia Deutschland remove a key search portal. The result was a national outpouring of support for Wikipedia, more donations to Wikimedia Deutschland, and a rise in daily pageviews of Lutz Heilmann's article from a few dozen to half a million. Shortly after, Heilmann asked the court to withdraw the court order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Lawmaker apologizes for blocking Wikipedia |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSTRE4AI7NB20081119?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=oddlyEnoughNews&amp;rpc=69 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=20 November 2008 | date=19 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* December 2008: Wikimedia Nederland, the Dutch chapter, won a preliminary injunction after an entrepreneur was linked in "his" article with the criminal [[Willem Holleeder]] and wanted the article deleted. The judge in [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] believed Wikimedia's assertion that it has no influence on the content of Dutch Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Nederland_wint_kort_geding_Sijthoff/en News release of Vereniging Wikimedia Nederland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604185505/http://nl.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Nederland_wint_kort_geding_Sijthoff/en |date=4 June 2011 }}.

* February 2009: When [[Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg|Karl Theodor Maria Nikolaus Johann Jakob Philipp Franz Joseph Sylvester Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg]] became federal minister on 10 February 2009, an unregistered user added an eleventh given name in the article on German Wikipedia: ''Wilhelm''. Numerous newspapers took it over. When wary Wikipedians wanted to erase ''Wilhelm'', the revert was reverted with regard to those newspapers. This case about Wikipedia reliability and journalists copying from Wikipedia became known as ''Falscher Wilhelm'' ("wrong Wilhelm").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikimedia.de/fileadmin/wiki/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/pm_Medienkompetenz_1.pdf|title=Wikimedia Deutschland press release|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204025315/http://wikimedia.de/fileadmin/wiki/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/pm_Medienkompetenz_1.pdf|archivedate=2010-12-04|postscript=}}; [http://futurezone.orf.at/stories/1502467/ ORF Futurezone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929010706/http://futurezone.orf.at/stories/1502467/ |date=29 September 2009 }}. Retrieved 27 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
* May 2009: An article about the German journalist Richard Herzinger in the German Wikipedia was vandalized. The IP user added that Herzinger, who wrote for ''[[Die Welt]]'', was Jewish; the sighter marked this as "sighted" (meaning that there is no vandalism in the article). Herzinger complained about that to Wikipedians who immediately deleted the assertion. According to Herzinger, who wrote about the incident in a newspaper article,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/webwelt/article3807487/Wie-ich-im-Internet-zum-Juden-erklaert-wurde.html Welt.de: Wie ich im Internet zum Juden erklärt wurde] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901050513/http://www.welt.de/webwelt/article3807487/Wie-ich-im-Internet-zum-Juden-erklaert-wurde.html |date=1 September 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; he is regularly called a Jew by right-wing extremists due to his perceived pro-[[Israel]] stance.
* October 2009: In 1990, the German actor [[Walter Sedlmayr]] was murdered. Years later, when [[Wolfgang Werlé and Manfred Lauber|the two murderers]] were released from prison, German law prohibited the media from mentioning their names. The men's lawyer also sent the Wikimedia Foundation a [[cease and desist]] letter requesting the men's names be removed from the English Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news

One of the first things I asked Jimmy is how free a rein I had in designing the project. What were my constraints, and in what areas was I free to exercise my own creativity? He replied, as I clearly recall, that most of the decisions should be mine; and in most respects, as a manager, Jimmy was indeed very hands-off. Nevertheless, I always did consult with him about important decisions, and moreover, I wanted his advice. Now, Jimmy was quite clear that he wanted the project to be in principle open to everyone to develop, just as open source software is (to an extent). Beyond this, however, I believe I was given a pretty free rein. So I spent the first month or so thinking very broadly about different possibilities." —Larry Sanger.&lt;/ref&gt; Wales stated in October 2001 that "Larry had the idea to use Wiki software."&lt;ref name="wikipedia-l-000671"&gt;

* January 2001: Licensing and structure. &lt;!-- yes ... this quintuplet of paragraphs is too long for *this* article ... but instead of DELETING what you believe is overly verbose, please move the inappropriate content over to the GNUpedia article ... preferably after correcting any mistatements and filling in any gaps, if you happen to know something about the history --&gt; After partial breakdown of discussions with [[Bomis]], [[Richard Stallman]] announced GNUpedia as a competing project.&lt;ref name="archive1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/announcement.html |title=GNUPedia Project Announcement – GNU Project – Free Software Foundation (FSF) |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=19 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109190613/https://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/announcement.html |archivedate=9 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides having a nearly identical name, it was very similar functionally to Nupedia/Wikipedia (the former which launched in March 2000 but had as yet published very few articles—the latter of which was intended to be a source of seed-articles for the former). The goals and methods of GNUpedia were nearly identical to Wikipedia: anyone can contribute, small contributions welcome, plan on taking years, narrow focus on encyclopedic content as the primary goal, anyone can read articles, anyone can mirror articles, anyone can translate articles, use libre-licensed code to run the site, encourage peer review, and rely primarily on volunteers. GNUpedia was roughly intended to be a combination of Wikipedia and also [[Wikibooks]]. The main exceptions were:

# The strong prohibition against *any* sort of centralized control ("[must not be] written under the direction of a single organization, which made all decisions about the content, and... published in a centralized fashion. ...we dare not allow any organization to decide what counts as part of [our encyclopedia]"). In particular, [[deletionist]]s were not allowed; editing an article would require [[fork (software development)|forking]] it, making a change, and then saving the result as a 'new' article on the same topic.
# Assuming attribution for articles (rather than anonymous by default), requiring attribution for quotations, and allowing original authors to control straightforward translations, In particular, the idea was to have a set of N articles covering the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], with some to-be-determined mechanism for readers to endorse/rank/like/plus/star the version of the article they found best.
# Given the structure above, where every topic (especially controversial ones) might have a thousand articles purporting to be *the* GNUpedia article about [[Sarah Palin]], Stallman explicitly rejected the idea of a centralized website that would specify which article of those thousand was worth reading. Instead of an official [[card catalogue|catalogue]], the plan was to rely on search engines at first (the reader would begin by [[googling]] "gnupedia sarah palin"), and then eventually if necessary construct catalogues according to the same principles as articles were constructed. In Wikipedia, there is an official central website for each language (en.wikipedia.org), and an official catalogue of sorts (category-lists and lists-of-lists), but {{as of|2013|lc=y}} search engines still provide about 60% of the inbound traffic.

The goals which led to GNUpedia were published at least as early as 18 December 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ar.groups.yahoo.com/group/slec/messages/194 |title=slec : Mensajes : 194–223 de 3699 |publisher=Ar.groups.yahoo.com |accessdate=19 November 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022194429/http://ar.groups.yahoo.com/group/slec/messages/194 |archivedate=22 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{no icon}} {{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/anencyc.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329165205/http://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/anencyc.txt |archivedate=29 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and these exact goals were finalized on the 12th&lt;ref name="archive1"/&gt; and 13th&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/announcement.es.html |title=GNUPedia Anuncio del Proyecto – GNU Project – Free Software Foundation (FSF) |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=19 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512002054/https://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/announcement.es.html |archivedate=12 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of January 2001, albeit with a copyright of 1999, from when Stallman had first started considering the problem. The only sentence added between 18 December and the unveiling of GNUpedia the week of 12–16 January was this: "The [[GNU Free Documentation License]] would be a good license to use for courses."

The staff of at least five politicians were implicated: [[Marty Meehan]], [[Norm Coleman]], [[Conrad Burns]], [[Joe Biden]] and [[Gil Gutknecht]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Nate Anderson|title=Congressional staffers edit boss's bio on Wikipedia|url=https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060130-6079.html|website=arstechnica|publisher=Condé Nast|accessdate=9 June 2014|date=31 January 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012062850/http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060130-6079.html|archivedate=12 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The activities documented were:

(Multiple attempts)
| On 16 August 2006, the ''Minneapolis-St. Paul Star Tribune'' reported that the office of Representative [[Gil Gutknecht]] tried twice—on 24 July 2006 and 14 August 2006—to remove a 128-word section in the Wikipedia article on him, replacing it with a more flattering 315-word entry taken from his official congressional biography. Most of the removed text was about the 12-year term-limit Gutknecht imposed on himself in 1995 (Gutknecht [[election|ran]] for re-election in 2006, breaking his promise). A spokesman for Gutknecht did not dispute that his office tried to change his Wikipedia entry, but questioned the reliability of the encyclopedia. {{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/587/story/618899.html |title=Gutknecht joins Wikipedia tweakers |work=Minneapolis-St. Paul Star Tribune|date=16 August 2006 |accessdate=17 August 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821074302/http://www.startribune.com/587/story/618899.html |archivedate=2006-08-21}}{{Failed verification|date=February 2007}}

In a separate but similar incident, the campaign manager for [[Cathy Cox]], Morton Brilliant, resigned after being found to have added negative information to the Wikipedia entries of political opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Information included the mention of an opponent's son's arrest in a fatal drunk driving accident, and allegations of questionable business practices of another opponent. {{cite web |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002958137_campaign28m.html |title=Online postings changed; ex-Gregoire aide resigns |work=Seattle Times |date=28 April 2006 |accessdate=27 July 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524041212/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002958137_campaign28m.html |archivedate=2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following media publicity, the incidents tapered off around August 2006.

=== Notable forks and derivatives ===
There are a number of {{srlink|Wikipedia:Mirrors and forks|Wikipedia mirrors and forks}}.  Other sites also use the MediaWiki software and concept, popularized by [[Wikipedia]].  No list of them is maintained.

Specialized foreign language forks using the Wikipedia concept include [[Enciclopedia Libre]] (Spanish), ''Wikiweise'' (German), WikiZnanie (Russian), [[Susning.nu]] (Swedish), and [[Baidu Baike]] (Chinese). Some of these (such as ''Enciclopedia Libre'') use [[GFDL]] or compatible licenses as used by Wikipedia, leading to exchange of material with their respective language Wikipedias.

===Publication on other media===

The [[German Wikipedia]] was the first to be partly published also using other media (rather than online on the internet), including releases on CD in November 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitale-bibliothek.de/scripts/ts.dll?s=1&amp;id=E0016306&amp;mp=/art/1266/&amp;sc=Wikipedia.htm|title=Wikipedia, Die freie Enzyklopädie|language=German|accessdate=25 April 2007}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more extended versions on CDs or DVD in April 2005 and December 2006. In December 2005, the publisher Zenodot Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, a sister company of Directmedia, published a 139-page book explaining Wikipedia, its history and policies, which was accompanied by a 7.5 GB DVD containing 300,000 articles and 100,000 images from the German Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Lawsuits===

In limited ways, the Wikimedia Foundation is protected by [[Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act]]. In the defamation action ''Bauer et al. v. Glatzer et al.'', it was held that Wikimedia had no case to answer because of this section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.app.com/news.jsp?key=81411 |title=Judge tosses Matawan literary agent's defamation lawsuit against Wikipedia – Asbury Park Press |publisher=M.app.com |accessdate=13 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710045913/http://m.app.com/news.jsp?key=81411 |archivedate=10 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar law in France caused a lawsuit to be dismissed in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2007-11-05/French lawsuit]]. 5 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a German appeals court (the [[Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart]]) ruled that Wikipedia is a "service provider" not a "content provider", and as such is immune from liability as long as it takes down content that is accused of being illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/12/02/legal-victory-german-court-wikimedia-foundation/ In legal victory, German court rules Wikimedia Foundation need not proactively check for illegal or inaccurate content] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204213607/http://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/12/02/legal-victory-german-court-wikimedia-foundation/ |date=4 December 2013 }}, Wikimedia Blog&lt;/ref&gt;

This is evident in Sanger’s flip announcement of Wikipedia to the Nupedia discussion list. “Humor me,” he wrote. “Go there and add a little article. It will take all of five or ten minutes.” And, to Sanger’s surprise, go they did. Within a few days, Wikipedia outstripped Nupedia in terms of quantity, if not quality, and a small community developed.  In late January, Sanger created a Wikipedia discussion list (Wikipedia-L) to facilitate discussion of the project. | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061223004004/http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200609/wikipedia | archivedate = 23 December 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9432">Many [[loanwords]] in [[Hawaiian Pidgin]] (or Hawaiian [[Creole language|Creole]] English) derive from the [[Japanese language]]. The linguistic influences of the [[Japanese in Hawaii]] began with the first immigrants from Japan in 1868 and continues with the large [[Japanese American]] population in Hawai{{okina}}i today.

There are other Japanese words common among the Japanese American population (such as "okazu" and "obaachan"), but not as well-known among Hawai{{okina}}i's general population. Such words have not been included here, nor have Japanese words which have entered the English language on a national level, such as "[[anime]]," ([[:ja:アニメ]]) "[[karaoke]]," ([[:ja:カラオケ]]) "[[samurai]]," ([[:ja:武士|侍]]) and "[[sushi]]" ([[:ja:寿司]]). Hawai{{okina}}i is also unique in the United States in that Japanese loanwords often retain Japanese pronunciation, as in the rolled "r" sound in words like "[[karaoke]]," "[[furikake]]," and "[[karate]]." 

Some words are not from the standard Japanese language. They instead originated from Japan's regional dialects. For example, the word "bobora" is said to be spoken only in certain prefectures, especially in western Japan where many of the Japanese immigrants came from. It originates from the Portuguese word ''abóbora'' meaning Japanese pumpkin.

==Food==
[[File:Spam musubi dllu.jpg|thumb|[[Spam musubi]] made from [[Spam (food)|SPAM]]. (see definition for "musubi" below).]]
* [[Anpan]] ([:ja:あんパン ja:あんパン], 餡パン): A sweet bread filled with [[red bean paste|azuki bean paste]] and sprinkled on top with sesame seeds. Usually larger than the Japanese variety.
* [[Bento]] ([[:ja:弁当]], べんとう): Box lunch geared for portability for picnics, etc. It typically has rice, a main dish of meat or fish, and side dishes. It used to be food on a paper plate placed inside a thin cardboard box. Now, it's all in convenient styrofoam containers molded for each dish.
* [[Furikake]]:A seaweed and sesame seed based condiment commonly used to season rice.
* [[Manjū]] ([[:ja:饅頭]]): Confection with sweet azuki bean paste inside a flour-based outside.
* [[Miso soup]] ([[:ja:味噌汁]]): Soup made of fermented [[soybean]] paste called [[miso]]. ''Miso-shiru'' in Japanese.
* [[Mochi]] ([[:ja:餅]]): Rice cake made of a special kind of rice that has been pounded into a sticky mass. Mochi may be sweetened or unsweetened. Commonly pounded and eaten during New Year's, as in Japan. Sweetened azuki beans are commonly included with mochi as part of a confection.
:* Mochi crunch: [[Senbei|Rice crackers]] seasoned with shoyu. Also called "kaki mochi". Called ''[[arare (food)|arare]]'' in standard Japanese.
:* [[Mochi ice cream]]: Ice cream coated with a thin layer of frozen mochi.
* Musubi: Rice triangle wrapped in dried seaweed; may or may not have something in the middle, like a pickled ''[[ume]]'' or bits of fish. [[Spam musubi]] has a piece of [[Spam (food)|SPAM]] luncheon meat on top. In Japanese the word ''[[onigiri]]'' is more commonly used for rice balls. Without further clarification, "musubi" usually implies the triangle variety (round balls of rice are only eaten at funerals).
* Shoyu ([[:ja:醤油]]): [[Soy sauce]]. "Shoyu rice" is "soy sauce" sprinkled over rice. "Shoyu ''x''" is some ingredient ''x'' cooked in soy sauce, e.g. "Shoyu chicken", "shoyu pork", "shoyu tofu". This term is so widely used that most Hawaiian residents are unaware that is not the widely used English language term for soy sauce.
* [[Sukiyaki]] ([[:ja:すき焼き]]): Thin slices of [[beef]], [[vegetable]]s, and tofu simmered in a skillet or pan in sukiyaki sauce. It is also the title of a No. 1 hit song in the [[United States|U.S.]] made popular by [[Kyu Sakamoto]] in 1963. The Japanese title of the song is "[[Sukiyaki (song)|Ue o muite arukō]]&amp;mdash;it has nothing to do with the food product.)
* [[Teriyaki]] ([[:ja:照り焼き]]): Grilled meat basted with a sauce made of shoyu and sugar. Meat words such as "chicken" are often appended. A common dish in plate lunches. Often shortened to "teri", e.g. "teri burger".
* Tako ([[:ja:タコ]]): [[Octopus]]. Often used in a local dish called [[Poke (Hawaii)|poke]] {{IPAc-en|p|oʊ|ˈ|k|eɪ}} in which case it is called "tako poke".

==Objects==
* Benjo ([[:ja:便所]]): [[Toilet]], interchangeable with Hawaiian-derived ''lua''. Although originally a Japanese word with no particular connotation, in Japan, it is now considered to be crude, and many Japanese people find this term offensive. (See also: [[Japanese toilet]]).
* Bobora: A country hick fresh off the boat from Japan. Also called "Japan bobora". Originally from a regional Japanese dialect, based on the Portuguese word ''abóbora'', meaning a [[kabocha|Japanese squash]].
* Boro boros: Dirty clothes, rags. Old clothes worn for activities like house painting, car repair, etc.
* Chawan cut: A hairstyle that was common among little Japanese girls. It looked like someone put a bowl (茶碗, ''[[chawan]]'') over the head and cut around the rim. In Japanese, it is called ''okappa'', after the Japanese mythological creature called [[Kappa (mythical creature)|kappa]] which sports a similar haircut.
* Daikon legs: [[Daikon]] ([[:ja:ダイコン]] or 大根) are large white [[radish]]es having a stubby shape. The term refers to Japanese women's legs which seem short and stubby. This is rumored to be the result of sitting on the floor for long periods. The Japanese equivalent is ''daikon ashi''.
* Giri-giri: The [[cowlick]]. ''Giri giri'' is an onomatopoeic word with a different meaning in standard Japanese. This use of the word originates from local dialects spoken in mainly western Japan where it means ''tsumuji'', the standard Japanese word for the cowlick.
* Hanakuso: [[Dried nasal mucus]]. ''Hana'' means nose, and ''kuso'' means waste. ''[[Kuso]]'' in Japanese typically refers to human excrement. This compound is also found in standard Japanese.
* Hanabuddah (or hanabata): The fluid version of ''hanakuso''. ''Bata'' is from English "butter". The term in Japanese is usually ''hanamizu'' ("nose water").
* Hanabuddah days: Hanabuddah is most commonly seen on young children who neglect to wipe their runny noses. Thus, hanabuddah days refers to one's youth in Hawai{{okina}}i.
* Hashi (also ohashi): [[Chopsticks]], as in Japanese.
* "[[Kikaida]]": After the [[Kikaida (TV series)|television series]] of the same name become enormously popular in Hawai{{okina}}i, "Kikaida" became a generic name for children's shows featuring [[superhero]]es.
* Shishi: [[Urine]] or urination, used in "go shishi" or "make shishi". The [http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/shi_shi/ Double-Tongued Dictionary] gives three possible etymologies for "shishi": imitative from the sound of urinating, Japanese reduplicated ''shi'' from ''shiko'' "urinate" (sic., probably ''shito'' 尿 "urine"), or Portuguese ''[[Wikt:xixi|xixi]]'' "urinate". There is a Japanese [[kanji]] joke based on 五-四-四 "5-4-4", which can be read ''go-shi-shi'' in Japanese. Thus, “I gotta five-four-four” is a Pidgin euphemism for "I gotta go shishi".
* Zori: Rubber thonged slippers, often called [[flip-flops]] in the continental U.S. Also zoris (plural). Synonymous with "slippers" or "slippahs".  From the Japanese word ''[[zori]]'' ([[:ja:草履]]).  Called "''beach sandal''" ([[:ja:ビーチサンダル]]) in standard Japanese.

==Miscellaneous==
* Bocha: Take a [[bathing|bath]]. Originally from ''bocha-bocha'' Japanese onomatopoeia for splashing noises.
* Bon dance ([[:ja:盆踊り]]): From the Japanese [[Bon Festival]]. An annual summer dance held outside at [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[temple]]s to greet the returning souls of the deceased. They dance in a circle around a tower where people sing and beat taiko drums. The most famous bon dance song is "Tanko-bushi" (炭坑節).
* Habut/Habuteru: To feel grumpy or resentful, especially after you feel offended by something. Not standard Japanese but from Hiroshima dialect.
* Jan ken po: The children's game of rock (fist), paper (open hand), and scissors (peace sign). In Japanese, either ''[[janken|jan ken]]'' or ''jan ken pon''. The Japanese also do not say the prelude as used in Hawai{{okina}}i ("janken na manken an saka saka po ...") before they show their hands (many people in Hawai{{okina}}i do not use this either). This jan-ken-po prelude can also differ depending on the island.
* Ku-ichi:  a Jewish person. (9+1 = 10, with 10 pronounced "ju" in standard Japanese){{dubious|date=July 2016}}
* [[Shibai]]: A false act. Often refers to politicians or other influential persons who put on a false face. From the Japanese word ''shibai'', meaning "a (theatre) [[Play (theatre)|play]]."
* Skebe: [[Sexual arousal|Horny]]. From Japanese ''sukebei''. In Japanese, "H" (''[[ecchi]]'') is used for the same purpose, and ''sukebei'' refers to a pervert.
* Skosh: Just a little. From Japanese ''sukoshi'' "a little".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7107">'''John of Saxony''' or '''Johannes de Saxonia''' or '''John Danko''' or '''Dancowe of Saxony''' was a medieval astronomer.  Although his exact birthplace is unknown it is believed he was born in Germany, most likely [[Magdeburg]]. His scholarly work is believed to date from the end of the 13th century into the mid 14th century.  He spent most of his active career, from about 1327 to 1355, at the [[University of Paris]].&lt;ref name=Medieval&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glick|first1=Thomas|last2=Ivesey|first2=Steven|last3=Wallis|first3=Faith|title=Medieval Science Technology and Medicine: An Encyclopedia|date=29 September 2005|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=140394766X|pages=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
John of Saxony is quoted in various medieval manuscripts and referenced as the author of various astronomical or astrological treatises, even though his authorship in some cases is questionable.

A ''computus'' dating back to 1297 is attributed to John of Saxony even though the author is listed as Iohannes Alemanus.  The fact that the geographical longitudes of [[Paris]] and [[Magdeburg]], considered John's birthplace, among other facts is why some historians consider him the author.

Viewed with less suspicion is his commentary on ''Liber Introductorius ad Magisterium Idiciorum Astrorum'' written by al-Qabisi ([[Alcabitius]]) an Arab scholar from the late 10th century.  John of Saxony's commentary on this treatise is preserved in many manuscripts, several incunabula and old prints, the latest of which dates from the middle of the 16th century.&lt;ref name=Medieval /&gt;

Among his other contributions were a commentary on [[Alchabitius|Alcabitius's]] ''Introduction to the art of astrology,''&lt;ref&gt;''Introductorium ad judicia astronomiae'', {{CathEncy|wstitle=Jean de Saxe}}&lt;/ref&gt; which went through eleven printed editions, and an ''[[Almanac]]h'' for the years 1336 to 1380 that he computed for the meridian of Paris using the Alfonsine tables.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Thorndike, ''A History of Magic and Experimental Science,'' vol. 3, (New York: Columbia University Press, 1934), pp. 262-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

John of Saxony was of the opinion that astronomers of that time wrote their works in such a confusing manner that those who weren't trained in the field couldn't comprehend nor use appropriately.  Under the tutelage of his master, [[John of Ligneres]], he sought to write tables that accounted for any situation and could be put to practical use.  As he puts it "Therefore to the praise of glorious God, the honor of my master, and the profit of scholars who wish to learn the workings of astronomical tables, I, John of Saxony, with God's aid intend to give examples of all the operations which are commonly performed with tables so that there may be no one henceforth who will shrink from the use and employment of tables of the stars because of the difficulty working with them."&lt;ref name=Magic&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thorndike|first1=Lynn|title=A History of Magic and Experimental Science: &amp; 4. Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries|date=1 July 1934|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=0231087977|pages=258–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alfonsine Tables==
The more widely recognized work by John of Saxony is his ''Canons'' on the [[Alfonsine Tables]].  The [[Alfonsine Tables]] are the mathematical calculations from Ptolemy's Almagest with limited modifications.&lt;ref name=Italian&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grendler|first1=Paul|title=The Universities of Italian Renaissance|date=29 September 2004|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|isbn=0801880556|pages=Chapter 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These tables for calculating planetary positions, prepared under the auspices of Alfonso X, were originally in Castillian.&lt;ref name=Biographical&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bolt|first1=Marvin|last2=Trimble|first2=Virginia|last3=Bracher|first3=Katherine|last4=Williams|first4=Thomas|last5=Hockey|first5=Thomas|title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers|date=5 January 2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=0387351337|pages=598–600}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were also used to derive ecliptic longitudes or planets for any chosen time and observer's position, lunar phases, lunar and solar eclipses, as well as calendar dates.  Like the 11th century Toledan Tables before them, the Alfonsine Tables were based on the geocentric model of the planetary system as described in [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Almagest]].  Around 1320, the Alfonsine Tables appeared in Paris where they were studied at the University of Paris by astronomers [[John of Ligneres]], [[John of Saxony]], and later [[Johannes de Muris]].&lt;ref name=Medieval /&gt;

In order to study the tables, they were translated from Castillian into Latin which was the scholarly language of the day.   This is due in large part to the Catholic upbringing of the day in medieval Europe.  This act alone allowed greater access and understanding of astronomical work to that point.  In 1327 he added an influential set of explanations and instructions (''Canons'') to the revision of the ''[[Alfonsine Tables]]'' by his master, [[John of Linières]].  His intent was to allow students at the University of Paris to utilize the astronomical tables.

The canons of John of Saxony explained how one could find the planetary position (longitudes) at any given time.  One would have to calculate the length of time between the basic year and they year sought.  They would then divide them by mean figures of the planetary orbits, and add/subtract values to adjust for hours and minutes.  To expedite these calculations he had an accompanying table of [[sexagesimal]] multiplication.&lt;ref name=Starry&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kusukawa|first1=Sachiko|title=Astronomical Tables|url=http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/starry/tables.html|website=Starry Messenger|publisher=[[University of Cambridge]]|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to this, he divided the day into sixty parts rather than 24 hours, consistently representing time by [[sexagesimal]] fractions and multiples of a day. It is in this form that the Alfonsine tables circulated in Western Europe for the next three centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Thorndike, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qXmjRsQYG2oC&amp;pg=PA253 A History of Magic and Experimental Science],'' vol. 3, (New York: Columbia University Press, 1934), pp. 253-8, 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

After translation and Canons were added to the Alfonsine Tables, they were disseminated from Paris to the rest of medieval Europe.  As they were received the tables were converted to the local meridians for proper use.  Although widely used, a published print version of the tables and John of Saxony's Canons didn't exist.  It wasn't until 1483 when [[Erhard Ratdolt]] in Venice published both.  To date neither [[John of Ligneres]] and [[Johannes de Muris]] cannons were published in print.&lt;ref name=Medieval /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1824">'''Leabhar Oiris''' pronounced ({{IPA-ga|l̠ʲəuɾʲ ɛɾʲɪʃ}}) is a [[Irish language|Gaelic]]-[[Ireland|Irish]] [[manuscript]] and [[chronicle]].

''An Leabhar Oiris'' was created by one, or more, author or authors, who drew on material in the [[Irish annals]] relating to the years 976 to 1028. It is believed to have been written in an Irish monastic [[scriptorium]], after 976 and by 1500.

This is a '''list of [[Yiddish]] Abbreviations'''.

==Sorting Order==

The entries are sorted according to the Hebrew alphabet. Prefixes indicating prepositions and articles (such as ב, ד, ה, ש, כ) have generally been removed, with the following exceptions:
*Where the abbreviation is incomprehensible or meaningless without the prefix
*Where the prefix is so integral to the acronym that variants without it rarely, if ever, occur

For ease of searching and sorting, double letters (ײ and װ) have been treated as if they were two separate letters.

==Numeronyms and other abbreviations with numerical elements==

Some abbreviations included here are actually [[gematria]] ([[Hebrew]] [[numeronyms]]), but the number is so closely associated with some noun that it is grammatically used as a noun and is synonymous with it, for example ל"ו, ''lamed vov''.

Other abbreviations contain a variable gematria component alongside other words, like the chapter references פי"א perek yud-alef (chapter 11) or פ"ט perek tet (chapter 9). Rather than list separate entries for every possible gematria, or use only one example number, the gematria component is replaced with [x] to produce (for example) [x]"פ.

==Abbreviations from other Hebraic languages==

Some [[Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]] abbreviations may not be included here; more may be found in the [[List of Hebrew abbreviations]] and the [[List of Aramaic abbreviations]], respectively.

Many of the abbreviations here may be similar or identical to those in the other lists of acronyms. In fact, a work written in [[Yiddish]] may have Hebrew and Aramaic abbreviations interspersed throughout, much as an Aramaic work may borrow from Hebrew (ex. [[Talmud]], [[Midrash]], [[Zohar]]) and Hebrew from Aramaic (ex. [[Shulchan Aruch]], [[Mishneh Torah]]). Although somewhat less common than Hebrew abbreviations, some Yiddish material contains Aramaic abbreviations too (for example, Chassidic responsa, commentaries, and other material).

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Newspaper-display-ad.jpg|thumb|Display ad in a newspaper.]] --&gt;
'''Newspaper display advertising''' is a form of [[newspaper]] advertisement - where the advertisement appears alongside regular editorial content. Display ads are generally used by businesses and corporations towards promotion of their goods and services and are generally for larger budget clients.

Newspaper display ads are different from the regular "[[Display advertising|display ads]]" terminology, which is commonly referred to as advertisements placed on the internet in banner and other [[rich media]] format.

These ads can span across multiple columns - and can even cover full page, half page, quarter page or other custom sizes. They are designed in high resolution coloured and black/white formats providing higher visibility for the mass audiences of newspapers. For many major newspapers in developing markets, display ads play a significant role in subsidizing the cost of the published newspaper.

Display ads appear in all sections of the newspaper except the editorial page, obituary page, and classified section.

==Display Ads Vs Classified Ads ==

Display ads typically contain text, photographs,logos, maps, and other informational items. In a newspaper, display advertising appears on the same page as, or on the page adjacent to general editorial content. Whereas, [[classified ads]] generally appears in distinct sections - based on their ad category in a designated newspaper classified pullout. The classified pages were traditionally text-only, and available in a limited selection of typefaces. Classified ads can either be normal classified texts or classified display ads. Classified display ads are cheaper than regular display ads - and appear in smaller width sizes in the classified columns. Display Ads are generally 6-7 times more expensive than classified display advertisements.

Typically, newspaper display ads are used by larger business establishments with larger advertising budgets. Display ads include retail/branding, public announcements, tender, [[public notice]], education admission notices, UFR, special appointment supplements etc. For personal/individual requirements such as selling property, selling automobiles, or change of name, [[Classified advertising|newspaper classified ads]] are more optimally suited.

==Rate Calculations ==
Display ads charges are usually based on the amount of [[area]] they consume and are quoted in per sq. cm or per column cm . Each column width of the publication might vary on basis of a [[broadsheet]] or a pullout, however in general stands at 4&amp;nbsp;cm width.

Nowadays, most newspapers and magazines have converted to a "modular" system that simplifies ad size and eliminates the need to figure out column inches.  In a modular system ad sizes are represented by the amount of the total page the ad takes up.  For example 1/2 page, 1/4 page, 1/8 page, etc.  This has been a popular system among many newspapers because it simplifies the layout process (i.e. less ad sizes to fit in newspaper) and makes pricing much easier for an advertiser to understand.

'''Nisus and Euryalus''' are a pair of friends and lovers serving under [[Aeneas]] in the ''[[Aeneid]]'', the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan epic]] by [[Virgil]]. Their foray among the enemy, narrated in Book nine, demonstrates their stealth and prowess as warriors, but ends as a tragedy: the loot Euryalus acquires (a glistening Rutulian helmet) attracts attention, and the two die together. Virgil presents their deaths as a loss of admirable loyalty and valor. They also appear in Book 5, during the [[funeral games (antiquity)|funeral games]] of [[Anchises]], where Virgil takes note of their ''amor pius''{{clarify|date=October 2017}}, a love that exhibits the ''[[pietas]]'' that is Aeneas's own distinguishing virtue.&lt;ref&gt;James Anderson Winn, ''The Poetry of War'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

In describing the bonds of devotion between the two men, Virgil draws on conventions of erotic poetry that have suggested a romantic relationship to some, interpreted by scholars in light of the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|Greek custom of ''paiderastia'']].&lt;ref&gt;Louis Crompton, ''Homosexuality and Civilization'' (Harvard University Press, 2003), pp. 84–86; Winn, ''The Poetry of War'', p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Nisus and Euryalus are among the refugees who in the aftermath of the [[Trojan War]] flee under the leadership of Aeneas, the highest-ranking Trojan to survive. Nisus was the son of [[Hyrtacus]],&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 9.175, 234, 319, 406.&lt;/ref&gt; and was known for his hunting. The family cultivated the huntress-goddess who inhabited [[Mount Ida (Turkey)|Mount Ida]].&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 9.406–408.&lt;/ref&gt; Euryalus, who was younger, has spent his entire life in a state of war and displacement.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Petrini, ''The Child and the Hero: Coming of Age in Catullus and Vergil'' (University of Michigan Press, 1997), pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; He was trained as a fighter by his battle-hardened father, [[Opheltes]],&lt;ref&gt;''bellis adsuetus'', ''Aeneid'' 9.201.&lt;/ref&gt; of whom he speaks with pride. Opheltes seems to have died at Troy.

After their wanderings around the Mediterranean, the Trojans are fated to land on the shores of Italy. Some members of their party, especially the ''matres'' ("mothers"), are settled at Sicily before the Italian war, but the mother of Euryalus refused to be parted from her son and continued on.&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 9.284–286; Petrini, ''The Child and the Hero'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characterization==
Although Nisus and Euryalus are inseparable as a pair in the narrative, each is given a distinct [[characterization]]. Nisus is the elder, more experienced man. He is swift and accurate ''(acerrimus)'' in the use of projectile weapons, the javelin ''(iaculum)'' and arrows.

Euryalus is still young, with the face of a boy (''puer'')  [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Rites of passage|who hasn't started shaving]], just old enough to bear arms. He was more beautiful ''(pulchrior)'' than any other of Aeneas's men at arms. Euryalus maintains a loving relationship with his mother. He refuses to see her before he leaves on his mission, because he cannot bear her inevitable tears, and yet his first concern amid promises of rich rewards is that she be cared for if he fails to return.&lt;ref&gt;Petrini, ''The Child and the Hero'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot and themes==
The foray by Nisus and Euryalus is a well-developed, self-contained episode&lt;ref&gt;Petrini, ''The Child and the Hero'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; that occurs in the "[[Iliad]]ic" half of the ''Aeneid'', set during the war through which the displaced Trojans established themselves among the inhabitants of central Italy. Virgil introduces the characters anew, but they have already appeared in Book 5,&lt;ref&gt;The race is narrated at ''Aeneid'' 5.286ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  at the funeral games held for Aeneas’s father, Anchises, during the "[[Odyssey|Odyssean]]" first half of the epic.&lt;ref&gt;Although the games are an episode in the wanderings, they recall the funeral games for [[Patroclus]] in ''Iliad'' 23; Lee Fratantuono, ''Madness Unchained: A Reading of Virgil's Aeneid'' (Lexington Books, 2007), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; The games demonstrate behaviors that in the war to come will result in victory or defeat; in particular, the footrace in which Nisus and Euryalus compete prefigures their disastrous mission.&lt;ref&gt;W.S. Anderson, ''The Art of the Aeneid'' (Bolchazy-Carducci, 2005, originally published 1969) , p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The five runners are, in the order in which they would have finished, Nisus, [[Salius]], Euryalus, [[Elymus (mythology)|Elymus]], and [[Automedon|Diores]]. Nisus, however, slips in the blood from the cattle sacrificed during the religious rituals that preceded the race. Recognizing that he can't recover his lead, he trips Salius to hand the victory to Euryalus. Nisus shows himself willing to sacrifice his own honor in order to help Euryalus, but the gesture demonstrates not only his loyalty but a willingness to cheat. Salius objects to the foul, and is given a consolation prize. Nisus receives compensation for his bad luck, and Euryalus gets the winner's prize. The incident is treated as comic, but becomes ominous in light of what happens to the pair later.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''The Art of the Aeneid'', p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the night raid of Nisus and Euryalus has a discrete narrative unity, it is closely related to major themes of the epic, such as the transition from boyhood to manhood, also present in the characters of [[Ascanius]], [[Pallas (son of Evander)|Pallas]], and [[Lausus]],&lt;ref&gt;Petrini, ''The Child and the Hero'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; and the waste of young lives in war. Nisus and Euryalus's killing spree through the camp of the [[Rutuli]] is one of Virgil's most brutal descriptions of combat (especially when Nisus beheads the chief Remus with his warriors Lamyrus, Lamus and [[Serranus (mythology)|Serranus]]). The poetry of Euryalus's death—"as when a richly hued flower is cut down by the plough and withers as it dies, or when the rains beat down the poppy's head, weighed down on slack neck" — is a replay of the death of Gorgytion in the Iliad.

==''Amor pius''==
In portraying the ''amor'' of Nisus and Euryalus, Virgil draws on a [[Greek love|Greek model of love between men]]. In the [[Roman military]], [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sex in the military|homosexual behavior among fellow soldiers]] was harshly prohibited, in keeping with [[Mos maiorum|Roman values]] that defined a citizen's political liberty in part by freedom from physical compulsion, including sexual use.&lt;ref&gt;A Roman man was free to engage in same-sex relations with a [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|passive partner]] excluded from the protections of citizenship (an ''[[infamia|infamis]])'', such as a [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Master-slave relations|slave]], [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitute]], or [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|entertainer]]. See further discussion at "[[Sexuality in ancient Rome]]".&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Greeks, however, there was a long tradition of idealized [[Homosexuality in the militaries of ancient Greece|homosexuality in a military setting]]. Although the relationship between Nisus and Euryalus initially conforms to the Greek model of the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece#Terminology|''erastes'' and ''eromenos'']], their shared military exploits transform them into solidly Roman ''viri'', "men."&lt;ref&gt;Petrini, ''The Child and the Hero'', pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; By describing their love as ''pius''{{clarify|date=October 2017}}, Virgil endorses it as "honorable, dignified and connected to central Roman values."&lt;ref&gt;Winn, ''The Poetry of War'', p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[high culture|elevated]] decorum of the ''Aeneid'' excludes explicit sexuality in general.&lt;ref&gt;Compare the discreet treatment of the wild passion shared by Aeneas and [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] in the cave in Book 4. On the general propriety of sexuality depending on [[literary genre]], see Amy Richlin, "Sexuality in the Roman Empire," in ''A Companion to the Roman Empire'' (Blackwell, 2006), p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philip Meninsky''' (born 1919 in Fulham, England, died in 2007) was the son of [[Bernard Meninsky]]. Despite an early passion for art, at his father's wish, he initially trained as an accountant, before being called up for National Service.

After a first posting to Scotland, he was then sent to the Far East where he was captured in 1942 after the [[fall of Singapore]].

He spent the next three years working on the [[Death Railway]] where he recorded the lives of POWs by secretly making detailed drawings of camp life. These drawings were subsequently used as evidence in the trials of war criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Philip Meninsky biography
|author=[[Imperial War Museum]]
|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point, rendered skeletal by starvation, he developed tropical ulcers on his legs, and was transferred to Chunkai hospital camp, where his limbs were saved from amputation by [[Edward Dunlop]] and Major [[Arthur Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surreycomet.co.uk/news/theregister/obit/1639213.Philip_Meninsky_1919_2007/ Surrey Comet Obituary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604060727/http://www.surreycomet.co.uk/news/theregister/obit/1639213.Philip_Meninsky_1919_2007/ |date=4 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work from this period is largely held by the [[Imperial War Museum]] in London, England, but there is at least one in the [[State Library of Victoria]] in Australia.

Together with the works of [[Jack Bridger Chalker]], [[Ashley George Old]] and [[Ronald Searle]] these drawings and paintings form a unique record of this dark time in human history.

Old and Meninsky were reunited in 1995 after 50 years as guests of the Imperial War Museum for an exhibition ''Victory in the Far East''   – held 15 August to 15 December 1995.&lt;ref&gt;''Legion – The Journal of the British Legion'' Vol. 16 No.4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''R v Patel''''' is an important case in South African criminal law, heard on May 8, 1959. The appellant's attorneys were Levy, Rogaly &amp; Cohen, Pretoria, and S. and v A Rosendorff, Bloemfontein. The Appellate Division ruled that "a person has the same right to use force in the defence of another from a threatened danger, as he would have to defend himself, if he were the person threatened."&lt;ref&gt;123A, quoting Gardiner and Lansdown, vol. 2 at p. 1549 (6th ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facts ==
In an appeal from a conviction of culpable homicide, it appeared that the appellant's brother had been struck by the deceased on the back with a hammer, and—he was then in a crouching position—that the next hammer blow might have landed on his head. The appellant had in this critical situation used the only weapon to hand: his revolver. He had fired at the deceased and killed him.

== Judgment ==
The general principles mentioned by Watermeyer CJ, in ''[[R v Attwood]]'',&lt;ref&gt;1946 AD 331.&lt;/ref&gt; are that an accused is entitled to an acquittal on the ground that he was acting in self-defence if it appears as a reasonable possibility on the evidence

* "that he had been unlawfully attacked and had reasonable ground for thinking that he was in danger of death or serious injury. (Though there may be cases of lawful self-defence where the accused was originally the aggressor;"&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Ndara]]'' 1955 (4) SA 182 (AD) 184E.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "that the means of self-defence which he used were not excessive in relation to the danger;" and
* "that the means he used were the only or least dangerous means whereby he could have avoided the danger."&lt;ref&gt;340.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court in ''Patel'' appeared to approve this view,&lt;ref&gt;123.&lt;/ref&gt; holding that a person has the same right to use force in the defence of another from a threatened danger as he would have to defend himself, if he were the person threatened. The Crown had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had exceeded the bounds of justifiable homicide.

The '''Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707''' is an online publication of the [[Scottish Parliament]] and the [[University of St Andrews]] arising from a project to create a comprehensive [[on-line database]] of the proceedings of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] from 1235 to the [[Act of Union (1707)|Act of Union]]. The website was launched in 2008. 

The project was formulated by Professor [[Keith Brown (professor)|Keith Brown]] of [[St Andrews University]] in 1996. Funding was quickly approved by then-[[Secretary of State for Scotland]] [[Michael Forsyth, Baron Forsyth of Drumlean|Michael Forsyth]] and announced by  then-[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[John Major]] on 4 July 1996. As well as the initial funding by the [[Scottish Office]], monies for what became the Scottish Parliament Project were provided by the [[Scottish Government]], the [[Arts and Humanities Research Board]], and the [[Strathmartine Trust]].

Under the general editorship of Professor Brown, the eleven-year project to complete the database created a work of around fifteen million words in size. It includes parallel translations from the original [[Latin]], [[French language|Norman French]], and [[Scots language|Scots]]. 

The primary editors of the text of each period were:
* [[Alastair Mann]] (Early Modern)
* [[Gillian McIntosh]] (Early Modern)
* [[Pamela Ritchie]] (Early Modern)
* [[Roland Tanner (historian)|Roland Tanner]] (Medieval and Latin)

The lead website developer was [[Swithun Crowe]].

The '''Social Hall''', also known as the '''Officers' Club''', was a social club located on the northwestern side of the island of [[Alcatraz]], off the coast of [[San Francisco]], USA. Located in close proximity to the [[Power House (Alcatraz)|Power House]], [[Alcatraz Water Tower|water tower]] and [[Former Military Chapel (Bachelor Quarters)]], it formerly housed the post exchange.&lt;ref name="DickinsonBlair2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dickinson|first1=Greg|last2=Blair|first2=Carole|last3=Ott|first3=Brian L.|title=Places of Public Memory: The Rhetoric of Museums and Memorials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BN5IV8RZ2jQC&amp;pg=PA187|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=2 August 2010|publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=978-0-8173-5613-2|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was a social venue for the Federal Penitentiary workers and their families on the island to unwind after a hard week's work dealing with America's most hardened criminals after they'd been locked up at 17:30.&lt;ref name="Barter1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barter|first=James|title=Alcatraz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MIYBYBk6UEsC|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=September 1999|publisher=Lucent Books|isbn=978-1-56006-596-8|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jr2011"/&gt; It was burned down by a fire of disputed origins during the [[Occupation of Alcatraz]] in 1970; leaving a shell which still remains.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4555">[[File:Tabula hungariae.jpg|200px|thumb|Tabula Hungariae, [[Ingolstadt]], 1528]]
'''Tabula Hungariae''' (also ''Lázár's map''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reneszansziwiw.hu/entity/98/datapage Lázár térképe]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the earliest surviving printed map of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], which has supposedly been made by Hungarian [[Lázár deák]] before 1528. It was inscribed on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Register]] in 2007. &lt;ref name=mow&gt;{{cite web |title= Tabula Hungariae |url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22451&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html | date=2008-05-16 |publisher=UNESCO Memory of the World Programme |accessdate=2009-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Tabula_hungariae_orientation.jpg|thumb|200px|Approximate area covered by Tabula Hungariae.]]
The map is approximately 65×85 cm in size and is oriented in southwest-northeast direction. It shows the settlements and landmarks of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the early 16th century. The southern areas occupied by the [[Ottoman Empire]] are marked with different colors. As the only covered parts outside the border are in the south, it is thought that the purpose of the creation of the map was the preparations for the war against the Ottomans. Some of the settlements shown on the map vanished during the years of Ottoman wars and oppression.

The most valued information on the map are the names and descriptions of settlements. There are approximately 1400 geographical names on the map, of which 1270 are names of settlements (365 on the territory of [[Treaty of Trianon|post-Trianon]] Hungary.)

At the bottom of the map is the description of the country in German and Latin.

===Names of settlements===
The geographical names were transcribed differently from today. For example, today's ''é'' was written ''ee'', today's ''ö'' was ''ew''. It is also noted that ''c'' is sometimes written ''tz'', which is a characteristic of the [[Old High German]] [[orthography]]. These may be created by contributors, who prepared the work for printing. However, with some other names, Lázár used the pronunciation of [[Hungarian dialects]].

==Printing==
The map was printed with the aid of [[Georg Tannstetter]], was paid by [[Johannes Cuspinianus]], in the press of [[Petrus Apianus]] in [[Ingolstadt]].

==Legacy==
There were only a few maps printed, almost all of them lost through history, so researchers could only know it from descriptions. However, in the early 1880s, one map was unexpectedly found. It was bought by collector [[Sándor Apponyi]] in 1882. The map was transferred in 1924 to the [[National Széchényi Library]], and is also there currently.

==Later versions==
There had been made several copies of the original map until 1552 but these did not survive. However, there were maps made using Lázár's map also after 1552, with title ''Tabula Hungariae'', illetve ''Nova descriptio totius Hungariae''. Six different versions are known:

*[[Giovanni Andrea Vavassore]] (worked 1510-1572), [[Venice]], 1553
*[[Pirro Ligorio]] (1496-1583), [[Rome]], 1558 (lost), 1599
*[[Antonio Lafreri]] (1512-1577), Rome, 1558, 1559, 156?
*[[János Zsámboky]] (1531-1584), [[Vienna]], 1566
*[[Claudio Duchetti]] (1554-1597), Rome, 1577
*[[Giovanni Orlandi (engraver)|Giovanni Orlandi]] (worked 1600-1604), Rome, 1602

[[File:Heinrich Vogeler - Illustration Vom klugen Schneiderlein.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Heinrich Vogeler]]]]
"'''The Clever Little Tailor'''" ({{lang-de|Vom klugen Schneiderlein}}) is a German [[fairy tale]] collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]] as tale 114.  It is [[Aarne-Thompson]] type 850, The Princess's Birthmarks.  [[Andrew Lang]] included it in ''[[The Green Fairy Book]]''.

==Synopsis==
A proud princess set a riddle to her wooers and sent them away when they could not answer.  Three tailors came.  Two were known for their cleverness and skill, and the third for his uselessness.  The princess asked them what two colors were her hairs.  The first said black and white; the second brown and red; the third gold and silver, and he was right.  

The princess demanded that he spend the night with a bear as well.  In his stall, the tailor began to crack nuts.  He offered the bear not nuts but pebbles, and the bear could not crack them.  The tailor took one away, substituted a nut, and cracked it.  The tailor began to fiddle, and the bear danced.  The tailor offered to teach it, but first he had to cut its nails.  He trapped it in a vise and left it there.

The princess agreed to marry him.  The other two tailors freed the bear.  It came after the carriage.  The tailor stuck his legs out the window and threatened the bear with the claim that they were a vise.  It ran off.

"'''The Three Spinners'''" is a German [[fairy tale]] [[Grimm's Fairy Tales|collected]] by the [[Brothers Grimm]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, ''Grimm's Fairy Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/rumpelstiltskin/stories/3spinners.html "The Three Spinners"]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is tale no 14 and [[Aarne–Thompson]] type 501.  It is widespread throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'' p 716 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has obvious parallels to [[Rumpelstiltskin]] and [[Frau Holle]], and obvious differences, so that they are often compared.

[[Giambattista Basile]] includes an Italian literary fairy tale, '''The Seven Little Pork Rinds''', in his 1634 work, the [[Pentamerone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 585, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Italo Calvino]]'s ''[[Italian Folktales]]'' includes a variant, ''And Seven!''.&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'' p 14-18 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of ''Grimm's Fairy Tales'' contained a much shorter variant, '''Hateful Flax Spinning''', but it is "The Three Spinners" that became well-known.

==Synopsis==
Once there was a beautiful-but-lazy girl who would not spin. While her mother beats her for it, the Queen, passing by, overhears and asks the reason for the punishment. Ashamed to admit that her daughter is lazy, the woman replies that the girl spins so much that her mother cannot afford to buy enough [[flax]] to keep her occupied.  The Queen, impressed by such industry, offers to take the girl with her.

Once at the castle, the queen takes the girl to a room filled with flax. If she spins it all within three days, she'll be rewarded with marriage to the queen's oldest son.  Two days later, the queen returns and is amazed to find the flax untouched.  The girl pleads that homesickness has kept her from spinning, but she realizes that excuse will not serve her twice.

[[Rule of three (writing)|Three]] women appear in the room that night. One has a grotesquely swollen foot; the second, an overgrown thumb; the third, a pendulous lip.  They offer to spin all the flax for the girl if she will invite them to her wedding, introduce them as her aunts, and seat them at the high table.  She agrees, and they commence and complete the spinning.

In the morning, the queen is satisfied to see the flax all spun.  She arranges for the wedding to her son, the prince, and the girl asks to invite her "aunts".  When they appear, the king asks how they came to have such deformities, and the three explain that they come from their years of spinning.  The king forbids his beautiful daughter-in-law to spin again.

===Variant: Hateful Flax Spinning===
A king orders his queen and daughters to spin all the time.  One day, he gives them a great box of flax to spin, to his daughters' distress.  The queen invites three hideous old maids to come to the castle and spin.  The king sees them and asks the cause of their deformities.  Their answer: from spinning.  The king forbids his wife and daughters to spin again.

==The Seven Little Pork Rinds==
A girl eats seven pieces of bacon, leaving none for her mother. While the mother beats her for her [[gluttony]], a passing merchant asks the reason, and the woman replies that her daughter is ruining her health by working too hard. The merchant decides on the spot to marry this industrious girl.

The now-married merchant goes on a journey, leaving his wife the spinning. Making an effort to spin, she flicks a passersby with water; some passing fairies are so amused by this that they offer to do the spinning for her.  Despite their aid, the merchant's wife claims that the spinning has made her ill, and the merchant decides not to require her to spin any more, as her mother must have been right about her overworking.

===And Seven!===
In this version, as in the one just described, the part of the king is taken by a merchant; similarly, the mother berates her daughter for "seven" – meaning seven bowls of soup that the girl has eaten – but the mother pretends that they are spindles of [[hemp]] that the girl has spun.

The women helpers in this version – who also are deformed from their years of spinning – instruct the girl to invite them to her wedding by calling their names. If she does not do so, they warn her, she will be worse off than she would have been had they not spun for her. She forgets the names and puts off the wedding while she tries to recall them.  The merchant sees the three women cavorting in the forest and hears them call out their names, similar to the scene in [[Rumpelstiltskin]]; he describes this to his bride in hopes of amusing her and getting her to agree to a wedding date.  She is therefore able to invite her helpers and bring about the happy ending as in "The Three Spinners".

A Puerto Rican version exists, with three Holy Souls in [[Purgatory]] replacing the fairies, and a merchant in place of the king. The heroine in this version is an orphan abused by an aunt.

'''Tickex.com''' was a [[United States]] and [[UK]] based [[search engine]] dedicated to live event tickets; [[concerts]], [[sports]], and [[theatre]]. The business did not sell tickets directly to consumers, instead the search engine [[Search aggregator|aggregated]]  and displayed tickets from other sites then redirected the user to the chosen site for purchase. Tickex listed ticket vendors in both the primary and secondary ticket markets including companies  [[Ticketmaster]], [[Stubhub]], [[Ticketsnow]], [[EBAY]], [[Viagogo]], and [[Tickets.com]] providing customers the ability to search, compare, and buy tickets based on price, location, and date.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ticketnews.com/TickEx-Finds-the-Tickets-You-Want27127.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Tickex.com search engine the company maintained several other mediums for customers to access their inventory. Tickex provided [[desktop widgets]] which can be placed on any [[webpage]] and provides visitors of other sites access to the Tickex catalogue of tickets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mashable.com/2007/08/21/tickex/ TickEx Launches Ticket Search in the U.S&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007 Tickex "announced the launch of its GIG*gle application (now re-branded as the Tickex application), which allowed [[Facebook]] users to search for live events, such as [[sports]] games, live [[theatre]] and [[concerts]] in the [[United States|US]] or [[UK]]." The application also allowed users to see what tickets are available and see who among their friends are interested in attending.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.901am.com/2007/tickex-launches-giggle-ticket-search-application-for-the-facebook-platform.html TickEx launches GIG*gle Ticket Search Application for the Facebook Platform | 901am&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, police arrested a man named [[Cengiz Ayhan]] in [[Mersin]] on charges of being the leader of the Turkish Revenge Brigade.

[[Image:Virgilkapelle bwmarchitekten 05.jpg|thumb|right|The underground Virgilius Chapel, with painted Byzantine cross]]

The '''Vergilius Chapel''' ({{lang-de|Virgilkapelle}}) is an underground [[crypt]] next to the [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|Stephansdom]] in [[Vienna]]. It is rectangular in form (approximately 6 meters by 10), with six niches. Today, it  lies approximately 12 meters beneath the [[Stephansplatz, Vienna|Stephansplatz]].

==History==
The history of the chapel is not entirely clear. The architecture can be dated to the early 13th century. At this time, [[Frederick II, Duke of Austria|Frederick the Warlike]] (1230-1246), the last Duke of the [[House of Babenberg]], was the ruler of Vienna. It has been hypothesized that the Duke, who would have liked to have established Vienna as an [[episcopal see]], had the crypt built for St. [[Coloman of Stockerau]], who was to be the patron of the new [[diocese]]. However, the chronicles do not mention the chapel, which has given rise to the speculation that it is the remnant of a failed project.

In the year 1307, a burial chapel of the Viennese family Chrannest is mentioned. The chapel was said to have multiple altars, one of which was dedicated to St. [[Vergilius of Salzburg]].

In the Middle Ages, the Stephansdom was encircled by a large cemetery. A single small chapel, dedicated to St. [[Mary Magdalene]] (the ''Magdalenskapelle'' or Magdalene Chapel), existed for consecrations and [[requiem]] masses. The Virgilius Chapel lay directly underneath this chapel, and a vertical shaft connected the two buildings.

In 1782, the cemetery around the Stephansdom was closed. The Magdalene Chapel was destroyed by fire in 1781 and was not rebuilt (presumably as, without a cemetery, there was no need for a funeral chapel). The Virgilius Chapel was filled with rubble and faded into obscurity.

In 1973 the chapel was rediscovered during construction of the [[Vienna U-Bahn]]. Today there is a mosaic on the Stephansplatz showing the outlines of the Virgilius Chapel. The chapel itself has survived with hardly any damage and provides the visitor with an excellent glance into the world of the Middle Ages.

==Location==
The Virgilius Chapel may be entered directly from the [[Stephansplatz (Vienna U-Bahn)|Stephansplatz U-Bahn Station]]. It is possible to look into the chapel from above. A collection of historical ceramics has been installed at the entrance to the chapel itself.

The '''Vorderasiatisches Museum''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfɔʁdɐ.ʔaˌzi̯atɪʃəs muˈzeːʊm|lang}}, ''[[Near East]] Museum'') is an archaeological museum in [[Berlin]]. It is in the basement of the south wing of the [[Pergamon Museum]] and has one of the world's largest collections of [[Southwest Asia]]n art. 14 halls distributed across 2,000 square meters of exhibition surface display southwest Asian culture spanning six millennia. The exhibits cover a period from the 6th millennium BCE into the time of the [[Muslim conquest]]s. They originate particularly from today's states of [[Iraq]], [[Syria]] and [[Turkey]], with singular finds also from other areas. Starting with the [[Neolithic]] finds, the emphasis of the collection is of finds from [[Sumer]], [[Babylonia]] and [[Assyria]], as well as northern Syria and eastern [[Anatolia]].

Excavations in historically important cities like [[Uruk]], [[Shuruppak]], [[Assur]], [[Hattusha]], [[Tell el Amarna]], [[Tell Halaf]] ([[Guzana]]), [[Sam'al]], [[Toprakkale]] and [[Babylon]] built the foundation of the museum's collection. Further acquisitions came from [[Nimrud]], [[Nineveh]], [[Susa]] and [[Persepolis]]. The museum shows finds from the cultures of [[Sumer]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], [[Babylonia]], [[Assyria]], the [[Hittites]] and the [[Aramaeans]]. These finds often found their way to Berlin via the [[Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft|German Oriental Society]]. In 1899, the Middle East Department at the royal museums was created. In 1929, they were provisionally accommodated in the [[Bode Museum]] and the Pergamon Museum, where they have been accessible to the public since 1930. During the [[Second World War]], there were hardly any war-related losses. The mobile exhibits, which were taken as [[art theft|art]] [[Looting|spoliage]] to the [[Soviet Union]], were returned to [[East Germany]] in 1958. The collection had already opened again as the ''Vorderasiatisches Museum'' in 1953.

Notable pieces of the collection are the [[Ishtar Gate]] and Procession Way of Babylon, remainders of the ancient city of Babylon, parts of the [[Eanna]] temple and [[Karaindash]]'s temple to [[Inanna]] in Uruk. The museum also has an important number of Southwest Asian [[stamp seal|stamp]] and [[cylinder seal]]s, as well as [[cuneiform]] texts. It has more than 200 of the [[Amarna letters]] and the larger ("Meissner") fragment (''VAT 4105'') of the [[Sippar]] tablet from the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', which includes [[Siduri]]'s advice, unlike later editions of the epic.

At present [[Markus Hilgert]] is the director of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smb.museum/museen-und-einrichtungen/vorderasiatisches-museum/ueber-uns/kontakt.html Vorderasiatisches Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; Previous directors were Beate Salje, Walter Andrae, Gerhard Rudolf Meyer, Liane Jakob Rust and Evelyn Klengel Brandt, among others.

[[File:Tower of London White Tower.jpg|thumb|The White Tower seen from the southeast. To the fore is the projection housing the apse of [[St John's Chapel, London|St&amp;nbsp;John's Chapel]].]]

The '''White Tower''' is a central tower, the old [[keep]], at the [[Tower of London]]. It was built by [[William the Conqueror]] during the early 1080s, and subsequently extended. The White Tower was the castle's strongest point militarily, and provided accommodation for the king and his representatives, as well as a chapel. [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] ordered that the tower be whitewashed in 1240.

==History==
[[File:Tower of london.jpg|thumb|left|Nighttime shot of the White Tower.]]
The castle which later became known as the Tower of London was begun by [[William the Conqueror]] in 1066. It began as a timber fortification enclosed by a palisade.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen Brown|Curnow|1984|pp=5–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next decade work began on the White Tower, the great stone keep that still dominates the castle today. The precise date of the White Tower's foundation is unknown, and it is also uncertain how long building took. It is traditionally held that construction began in 1078. This is because the ''[[Textus Roffensis]]'' records that [[Bishop Gundulf|Gundulf]], [[Bishop of Rochester]], oversaw the building work under instruction from William the Conqueror.&lt;ref name=ABC9&gt;{{harvnb|Allen Brown|Curnow|1984|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dendrochronology|Dendrochronological]] evidence suggests construction of the White Tower began in 1075–1079. The archaeology of the standing building suggests there was a pause in construction between 1080 and 1090–1093, although it is unknown why.&lt;ref name=I&amp;P17&gt;{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gundulf did more than just oversee work and was a skilled architect. [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester's]] [[Rochester Castle|castle]] and [[Rochester Cathedral|cathedral]] were rebuilt under his auspices.&lt;ref name=ABC9/&gt; As the main castle in England's capital,{{#tag:ref|There were three Norman castles in London: the Tower of London, [[Baynard's Castle]], and [[Montfichet's Tower]].|group="nb"}} the Tower of London was an important royal building. The keep built by Gundulf bears testament to this as it was one of the largest in Christendom.&lt;ref name="Allen Brown 1976 44"&gt;{{harvnb|Allen Brown|1976|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The White Tower was multi-purpose. It was the castle's strongest point militarily yet provided accommodation fit for the king and his representatives. In [[Norman architecture]] the keep was a symbol of a lord's power. The White Tower was probably complete by 1100 at the latest, at which point it was used to imprison [[Ranulf Flambard]], [[Bishop of Durham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen Brown|Curnow|1984|pp=9–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was probably during [[Henry II of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;II]]'s reign (1154–1189) that a forebuilding was added to the south side of the tower to provide extra defences to the entrance, but it has not survived.&lt;ref name="Parnell 1993 20-21"&gt;{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|pp=19–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry III of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;III's]] relations with his barons were uneasy, and in the 1220s and 1230s he enhanced the castle's defences and domestic buildings. Though the work he started may not have been finished within his lifetime, he extended the castle to the north and east, building a new stone wall to enclose the castle.&lt;ref name=I&amp;P25-27&gt;{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|pp=25–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Hoarding (castle)|brattice]] (a timber gallery) was added to the top of the White Tower, projecting beyond its walls to better defend the base of the tower.&lt;ref name="Parnell 1993 32"&gt;{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry also undertook maintenance of the White Tower and it was during his reign that the tradition of whitewashing the building began. In March 1240 the Keeper of the Works at the Tower of London was ordered "to have the Great Tower whitened both inside and out". Later that year the king wrote to the Keeper, commanding that the White Tower's lead guttering should be extended with the effect that "the wall of the tower&amp;nbsp;... newly whitened, may be in no danger of perishing or falling outwards through the trickling of the rain".&lt;ref name=I&amp;P25-27/&gt; Henry did not explain his order to whitewash the keep, but may have been influenced by contemporary fashion in Europe to paint prestigious buildings white. He also added decoration to the chapel in the keep, adding stained glass, statues, and paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:towrlndn.JPG|thumb|upright|The 15th-century Tower in a manuscript of poems by [[Charles, Duke of Orléans]] (1391–1465) commemorating his imprisonment there. The white forebuilding to the left of the duke was demolished in 1674. ([[British Library]]).]]
Activity at the castle in the early 14th&amp;nbsp;century declined relative to previous periods. Though the Tower of London was still occasionally used as a residence, by the 1320s the chapel in the White Tower was used to store records. This marked the beginning of the castle's diminishing role as a royal residence.&lt;ref name=I&amp;P41&gt;{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The records were briefly removed from the White Tower in 1360 to accommodate the captive French king, [[John II of France|John&amp;nbsp;II]].&lt;ref name=I&amp;P87&gt;{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may have been during the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward&amp;nbsp;III]] (1327–1377) that a building abutting the south side of the White Tower was created. Built as storage, it may have been part of Edward's building programme at the Tower of London which saw its role as a military store come to the fore. The structure no longer survives, but is recorded on plans from 1597 and 1717.&lt;ref name=I&amp;P41/&gt;

[[Richard II of England|Richard&amp;nbsp;II]] was imprisoned at the Tower of London and abdicated there in 1399; according to tradition, the event took place in the White Tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1490s a new floor was added to the White Tower, creating extra storage.&lt;ref name=I&amp;P57&gt;{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architecturally virtually no trace remains of the White Tower's forebuilding, although it appears in a manuscript drawing [[circa]] 1500 depicting the imprisonment of [[Charles, Duke of Orléans]] and was recorded in a plan of 1597.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen Brown|Curnow|1984|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was demolished in 1674.&lt;ref name="I&amp;P 46-47"&gt;{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17&amp;nbsp;June that year, during the course of the demolition, bones belonging to two children were discovered beneath the stairs in the forebuilding. It was assumed that they belonged to the [[Princes in the Tower]]. The remains were re-interred in [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the Princes in the Tower is one of the most infamous stories related to the castle. After the death of [[Edward IV of England|Edward&amp;nbsp;IV]] his 12-year-old son was declared king as [[Edward&amp;nbsp;V]], but never crowned. [[Richard III of England|Richard Duke of Gloucester]] was named [[Lord Protector]] while the prince was too young to rule.&lt;ref name="Horrox"&gt;{{harvnb|Horrox|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward was confined to the Tower of London along with his younger brother, [[Richard of Shrewsbury]]. The Duke of Gloucester was then proclaimed King Richard&amp;nbsp;III in July. The princes had last been seen in public in June 1483;&lt;ref name="I&amp;P 46-47"/&gt; the most likely reason for their disappearance is that they were murdered late in the summer of 1483.&lt;ref name="I&amp;P 46-47"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horrox"/&gt;

By the [[Tudor period]], the science of fortification had changed to deal with powerful cannons. The new designs, with low angled [[bastion]]s, were not emulated at the Tower of London. All the same, some adaptations to use cannon were made; the changes included adding a timber platform to the top of the White Tower for cannon emplacements.&lt;ref name=I&amp;P73&gt;{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weight of the guns damaged the roof so that it had to be reinforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The one documented use of these cannon was during [[Wyatt's rebellion]] in 1554 and they were ineffective.&lt;ref name=I&amp;P73/&gt; The [[Board of Ordnance|Office of Ordnance]] and Office of Armoury were headquartered at the Tower of London until the 17th&amp;nbsp;century. Their presence influenced activity at the castle and led to it becoming the country's most important military store. In the 1560s two armouries were created in the White Tower and by the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;I]] (1558–1603) most of the gunpowder at the Tower was stored in the White Tower.&lt;ref name=I&amp;P58&gt;{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the last quarter of the 16th&amp;nbsp;century the castle was a tourist attraction with visitors allowed inside despite its use by the Offices of Ordnance and Armoury.&lt;ref name=I&amp;P97&gt;{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its role in providing storage directly impacted on the White Tower's structure and posts were added to support the floors. In 1636 a hole was knocked through the White Tower's north wall to ease the movement of provisions. In 1639–1640 the White Tower's external appearance was changed, with much of its facing material replaced.&lt;ref name=I&amp;P58/&gt;

In 1640 [[Charles I of England|Charles&amp;nbsp;I]] ordered that the Tower of London should be prepared for conflict. Platforms for cannons were built and 21 installed on top of the White Tower with three additional [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]]. Despite the new defences the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] captured the Tower of London without the cannon being used. In January 1642, Charles&amp;nbsp;I attempted to arrest five Members of Parliament. When this failed he fled the city, and Parliament retaliated by removing Sir [[John Byron, 1st Baron Byron|John Byron]], the Lieutenant of the Tower. The Trained Bands had switched sides, and now supported Parliament; together with the London citizenry, they blockaded the Tower. With permission from the King, Byron relinquished control of the Tower. Parliament replaced Byron with a man of their own choosing, Sir [[Conyers baronets|John Conyers]]. By the time the [[English Civil War]] broke out in November 1642, the Tower of London was already in Parliament's control.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1657 the entire building apart from the chapel was being used to store gunpowder.&lt;ref name=I&amp;P58/&gt; Storing both gunpowder and government records in the White Tower was not ideal, and there were repeated suggestions in 1620, 1718, and 1832 to move the gunpowder to a new location, although the proposals were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=I&amp;P87/&gt;

[[File:Tower of london 812.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Royal Armouries]] still have displays in the White Tower. This suit of armour belonged to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII]].]]
By 1661 plans had been proposed to clear an area {{convert|6|m}} around the White Tower to safeguard the dangerous material inside. Nothing was done until after the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666. During the fire it was feared the flames might reach the castle, specifically the White Tower, highlighting the need for safety measures. In the following years a protective wall was built around the White Tower. In the 1670s buildings that had accumulated around the White Tower to provide storage for the Offices of Ordnance and Armoury were pulled down. After this, repairs were carried out on the face of the White Tower. A staircase was also added on the south face, allowing direct access to the records in the chapel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|pp=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Tower of London had been open to visitors for centuries, it was not until the early 19th&amp;nbsp;century that alterations were made explicitly for visitors. In 1825 a building, the New Horse Armoury, to contain effigies of England's kings was constructed against the south of the White Tower. The [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival]] design of the structure&amp;nbsp;– one of the first purpose-built museums in England&amp;nbsp;– was widely reviled. By the end of the century the effigies and Queen Elizabeth's Armoury were distributed in displays in the White Tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|pp=97–101, 117}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-19th&amp;nbsp;century, under the encouragement of Prince Albert, [[Anthony Salvin]] undertook a programme of restoration at the castle. In 1858 the White Tower's roof was reinforced with iron girders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26&amp;nbsp;January 1885 a bomb in the White Tower damaged some of the displays.&lt;ref name=I&amp;P97/&gt;

The roofs of the White Tower and its turrets were repaired in the 1960s and 1970s. Accumulated dirt was washed from the exterior and the floors inside replaced. Also in this period a staircase was added against the south face of the keep, reopening access through the original entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1974 Tower of London bombing|1974, there was a bomb explosion]] in the [[Mortar (weapon)|Mortar]] Room in the White Tower, leaving one person dead and 35&amp;nbsp;injured. No one claimed responsibility for the blast, but the police investigated suspicions that the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] was behind it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/17/newsid_2514000/2514429.stm |title=On This Day 1974: Bomb blast at the Tower of London |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |date=17 July 1974 |accessdate=2010-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, the Tower of London as a whole was added to the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Site]]s, in recognition of its global importance and to help conserve and protect the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15244&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=UNESCO Constitution |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=2009-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/488 |title=Tower of London |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tower of London is in the care of [[Historic Royal Palaces]], a charity, and between 2008 and 2011 a £2&amp;nbsp;million conservation programme was undertaken at the White Tower.

==Architecture==
[[File:Whitetowerlondon.jpg|thumb|upright|The original entrance to the White Tower was at first-floor level.]]
The White Tower is a [[keep]] (also known as a donjon), which was often the strongest structure in a medieval castle, and contained lodgings suitable for the lord—in this case the king or his representative.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Friar|2003|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to military historian Allen Brown, "The great tower [White Tower] was also, by virtue of its strength, majesty and lordly accommodation, the donjon ''par excellence''".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen Brown|1976|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the largest keeps in the [[Christendom|Christian world]],&lt;ref name="Allen Brown 1976 44"/&gt; the White Tower has been described as "the most complete eleventh-century palace in Europe".&lt;ref name="I&amp;P 16"&gt;{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influences on the White Tower's design are unclear. Magnates in northern France had been building stone keeps since the mid-9th&amp;nbsp;century so the general design was well-established. More specifically the keep of [[Château d'Ivry-la-Bataille]], built around 1000, may have been a particularly prominent influence as it included a semi-circular projection in one corner.&lt;ref I&amp;P19&gt;{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen Brown and P.&amp;nbsp;Curnow suggested that the design may have been based on the now vanished 10th-century keep of [[Château de Rouen]], which belonged to the Dukes of Normandy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen Brown|Curnow|1984|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the western corners are square towers, while to the north-east a round tower houses a spiral staircase. At the south-east corner is a larger semi-circular projection which accommodates the [[apse]] of the chapel.&lt;ref name="I&amp;P 16"/&gt; Excluding its projecting corner towers, the keep measures {{convert|36|by|32|m}} at the base, and rises to a height of and is {{convert|27|m|-1|abbr=on}} high at the southern battlements where the ground is lower. The structure was originally three storeys high, comprising a basement floor, an entrance level, and an upper floor. The entrance, as is usual in [[Norman architecture|Norman]] keeps, was above ground (in this case on the south face) and accessed via a wooden staircase which could be removed in the event of an attack. The forebuilding added in the 12th&amp;nbsp;century no longer survives.&lt;ref name="Parnell 1993 20-21"/&gt; As the building was intended to be a comfortable residence as well as a stronghold, latrines were built into the walls, and four fireplaces provided warmth.&lt;ref name="I&amp;P 16"/&gt;

The main building material is [[Kent]]ish [[rag-stone]], though some local [[mudstone]] was also used. Although little of it survives, [[Caen stone]] was imported from northern France to provide details in the Tower's facing, much of it replaced by [[Portland stone]] in the 17th&amp;nbsp;and 18th&amp;nbsp;centuries under the direction of architect [[Inigo Jones]]. As most of the Tower's windows were enlarged in the 18th&amp;nbsp;century, only two original&amp;nbsp;– albeit restored&amp;nbsp;– examples remain, in the south wall at gallery level.&lt;ref name="Parnell 1993 22"&gt;{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White Tower was terraced into the side of a mound, so the northern side of the basement is partially below ground level.&lt;ref name="Parnell 20"&gt;{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interior===
The purpose of each room is interpreted based primarily on its design. As a result, there can be some ambiguity in what individual chambers were used for.&lt;ref name=I&amp;P17/&gt; Each floor was divided into three chambers, the largest in the west, a smaller room in the north-east, and the chapel taking up the entrance and upper floors of the south-east.&lt;ref name="Parnell 1993 20-21"/&gt; As was typical of most keeps,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Friar|2003|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; the bottom floor was an [[undercroft]] used for storage. One of the rooms contained a well. Although the layout has remained the same since the tower's construction, the interior of the basement dates mostly from the 18th&amp;nbsp;century when the floor was lowered and the pre-existing timber [[vault (architecture)|vaults]] were replaced with brick counterparts.&lt;ref name="Parnell 20"/&gt; The basement is lit through small slits.&lt;ref name="I&amp;P 16"/&gt; The sole access to the floor was via the north-east staircase turret.&lt;ref name="Parnell 20"/&gt;

The entrance floor was probably intended for the use of the [[Constable of the Tower]] and other important officials. The south entrance was blocked during the 17th&amp;nbsp;century, and not reopened until 1973. Those heading to the upper floor had to pass through a smaller chamber to the east, also connected to the entrance floor. The [[crypt]] of [[St John's Chapel, London|St&amp;nbsp;John's Chapel]] occupied the south-east corner and was accessible only from the eastern chamber. There is a recess in the north wall of the crypt; according to Geoffrey Parnell, Keeper of the Tower History at the Royal Armouries, "the windowless form and restricted access, suggest that it was designed as a strong-room for safekeeping of royal treasures and important documents".&lt;ref name="Parnell 20"/&gt;

The upper floor contained a grand hall in the west and residential chamber in the east{{spaced ndash}}both originally open to the roof and surrounded by a gallery built into the wall{{spaced ndash}}and St&amp;nbsp;John's Chapel in the south-east. The top floor was added in the 15th&amp;nbsp;century, along with the present roof.&lt;ref name="I&amp;P17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parnell 1993 20-21"/&gt; The absence of domestic amenities such as fireplaces suggest it was intended for use as storage rather than accommodation.&lt;ref name=I&amp;P57/&gt; In the 17th&amp;nbsp;century lead cisterns were installed on top of the White Tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parnell|1993|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===St John's Chapel===
{{see also|St John's Chapel, London}}
[[File:Whitetowerchapel.jpg|thumb|[[St John's Chapel, London|St John's Chapel]], inside the White Tower.]]
The semi-circular projection in the south-east corner to accommodate St&amp;nbsp;John's Chapel is almost unparalleled in castle architecture. The only other keep in England with a similar projection is that of [[Colchester Castle]],&lt;ref name=ABC10-11&gt;{{harvnb|Allen Brown|Curnow|1984|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|According to Allen Brown and P.&amp;nbsp;Curnow "Technically in its plan&amp;nbsp;... and more especially in its apsidal projection at the south-east angle housing the chapel&amp;nbsp;... there is nothing else like it in Europe save only at Colchester".&lt;ref name=ABC10-11/&gt;|group="nb"}} the largest in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Friar|2003|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; St&amp;nbsp;John's Chapel was not part of the White Tower's original design, as the apsidal projection was built after the basement walls.&lt;ref name="Parnell 20"/&gt; Due to changes in function and design since the tower's construction, except for the chapel little is left of the original interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen Brown|Curnow|1984|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapel's current bare and unadorned appearance is reminiscent of how it would have been in the Norman period. In the 13th century, during Henry&amp;nbsp;III's reign, the chapel was decorated with such ornamentation as a gold-painted cross, and [[stained glass]] windows that depicted the Virgin Mary and Holy Trinity.&lt;ref name="Parnell 1993 32"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3901">'''William Chaffers''' (28 September 1811 – 12 April 1892) was an English antiquary and writer of reference works on [[hallmark]]s, and marks on [[ceramics]]. His ''Marks and Monograms on Pottery and Porcelain'', first published in 1863, has appeared in many later editions.

==Life==
Chaffers was the son of William Chaffers and wife Sarah, and was born in Watling Street, London, in 1811; he was descended from a brother of [[Richard Chaffers]] (1731–1765), a manufacturer of [[Liverpool porcelain]]. He was educated at Margate and at [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]], where he was entered in 1824.&lt;ref name=dnbsupp&gt;{{cite DNBSupp|first=Thomas|last=Seccombe|authorlink=Thomas Seccombe|wstitle=Chaffers, William|volume=1|page=409}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=5016|title=Chaffers, William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was attracted to antiquarian studies while a clerk in the city of London, by the discovery of Roman and medieval antiquities in the foundations of the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] during 1838–9. At the same time he began to concentrate attention upon the study of gold and silver plate and ceramics, especially in regard to the official and other marks by which dates and places of fabrication can be distinguished. In 1863 Chaffers published two important works:&lt;ref name=dnbsupp/&gt;
* ''Hall Marks on Gold and Silver Plate, illustrated, with Tables of Annual Date Letters employed in the Assay Offices of the United Kingdom''; in the 8th edition of 1896 it included "Histories of the Goldsmiths' Trade, both in England and France, and revised London and Provincial Tables", and an introductory essay by C. A. Markham.&lt;ref name=dnbsupp/&gt;
* ''Marks and Monograms on Pottery and Porcelain of the Renaissance and Modern Periods, with Historical Notices of each Manufactory, preceded by an introductory Essay on Vasa Fictilia of the Greek, Romano-British, and Mediæval Eras''. The aim of the work was to be for ceramics what {{ill|Franz Brulliot|de}}'s ''Dictionnaire des Monogrammes'' was to painting, and it at once established Chaffers as the leading authority upon his subject.&lt;ref name=dnbsupp/&gt; Many subsequent editions have appeared, revised by later editors; the 9th edition appeared in 1900, and the 15th edition in 1965.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

Other publications are ''The Keramic Gallery'', in 2 volumes, with 500 illustrations (1872); a handbook abridged from ''Marks and Monograms'' (1874); ''Gilda Aurifabrorum'', a history of goldsmiths and plate workers and their marks (1883); also a priced catalogue of coins, and other minor catalogues.&lt;ref name=dnbsupp/&gt;&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

His reputation was furthered in organizing exhibitions of art treasures, at [[Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857|Manchester in 1857]], [[1862 International Exhibition|South Kensington in 1862]], Leeds in 1869, Dublin in 1872, Wrexham in 1876, and Hanley (at the great Staffordshire exhibition of ceramics) in 1890. Chaffers was elected [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London]] in 1843, and he was a frequent contributor to ''Archæologia'', to ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', and to various learned periodicals upon the two subjects of which he had particular knowledge.&lt;ref name=dnbsupp/&gt;

In 1841 he married Charlotte Matilda, daughter of John Hewett.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; About 1870 he retired from [[Fitzroy Square]] to a house in Willesden Lane, and later moved to [[West Hampstead]], where he died on 12 April 1892.&lt;ref name=dnbsupp/&gt;

He received the Collar of the Hanedan-i-Ali-Osman and the [[Imtiyaz Medal|Nişan-ı-Ali-Imtiyaz]], GC of the [[Order of Leopold (Austria)|Order of Leopold of Austria]] (1917).

==Early years==
Ömer Hilmi lived most of his life in Istanbul in the restrictive surroundings of [[Dolmabahçe Palace]]. He was born in the apartments reserved for the Veliahd, the Crown Prince, and then moved into the main palace once his father had become the Ottoman Sultan on 27 April 1909. Together with his brother, he tried to support his father during the difficult years of the [[First World War]]. On the death of his father on 4 July 1918, just before the end of the war, he and his family left Dolmabahçe Palace and moved to a Konak at [[Nişantaşı]] during the winter months and to one in Bağlarbaşı, above Beylerbeyi, for the summer.

==Exile==
Following the establishment of the [[Turkish Republic]] and the abolition of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Caliphate]], the entire Ottoman Imperial family were forced into exile in March 1924. Aged 38, Ömer Hilmi, left Turkey never to return, since he died before the decree of exile was lifted. He went into exile with his mother, Mihrengiz Kadın, who had been the wife of Sultan [[Mehmed V]], and with his two young children, Mahmud Namık and Emine Mükbile. Like all other members of the Imperial family, they left Istanbul from Sirkeci Train Station and first went to [[Budapest]]. They lived here for a few months, then moved to Vienna, then Paris, before settling in Nice, France. As the former Ottoman Sultan, Sultan [[Mehmed VI]], had settled in San Remo, many members of the family had congregated in the South of France. After living in Switzerland for a short time, his cousin, the last Caliph of Islam Prince Abdulmecid, also moved to Nice. Ömer Hilmi spent the next 11 years of his life in Nice, struggling to adapt to life in exile, before moving to Alexandria, Egypt in January 1935 with his family. Life in exile was always very difficult since members of the Imperial Ottoman family had no financial means, and all yearned to return to their homeland.

==Illness and Death==
His daughter, Emine Mükbile, who had married her distant cousin [[Ali Vasib]] in 1931, cared for him, her grandmother and brother during all this time. Ömer Hilmi suffered from a stroke and died soon after settling in Alexandria. He died aged 49 at Alexandria, on 6 April 1935, and was buried in Khedive Tawfik Mausoleum, Cairo, Egypt.
