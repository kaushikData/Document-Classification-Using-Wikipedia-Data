      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5317">'''Agent detection''' is the inclination for [[animal]]s, including [[human]]s, to presume the purposeful intervention of a sentient or intelligent [[agency (philosophy)|agent]] in situations that may or may not involve one.

==Evolutionary origins==
It is believed that humans evolved agent detection as a survival strategy. In situations where one is unsure of the presence of an intelligent agent (such as an enemy or a [[predator]]), there is survival value in assuming its presence so that precautions can be taken. For example, if a human came across an indentation in the ground that might be a lion's footprint, it is advantageous to err on the side of caution and assume that the [[lion]] is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Psychologists Kurt Gray and [[Daniel Wegner]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;{{cquote|The high cost of failing to detect agents and the low cost of wrongly detecting them has led researchers to suggest that people possess a Hyperactive Agent Detection Device, a cognitive module that readily ascribes events in the environment to the behavior of agents.&lt;ref name="BlamingGod"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Time-consuming steps, fast escapes and criticism==
Since it takes time to think of why a stimulus is present while simply reacting to it goes much faster, some evolutionary biologists criticize the assumption that agent detection would enhance the ability to escape predators as making a fast escape is of high importance to survive. These biologists state that simple reactions to stimuli that do not take a by-route over speculation about causes, such as running from the shape of certain footprints or a pair of eyes by simple reflex without even making a time-consuming association to a predator, would be selected instead by saving one step and therefore time. As a result, these biologists conclude that there are no specialized brain mechanisms for agent detection.&lt;ref&gt;2013 Sensory Ecology, Behaviour, and Evolution; Martin Stevens&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2012 Evolution and the Mechanisms of Decision Making; Peter Hammerstein, Jeffrey R. Stevens&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in religion==
{{See also|Evolutionary psychology of religion}}
Some scientists believe that the belief in creator gods is an evolutionary [[Spandrel (biology)|by-product]] of agent detection.&lt;ref&gt;Religion Explained, by Pascal Boyer&lt;/ref&gt; A [[spandrel (biology)|spandrel]] is a non-adaptive trait formed as a side effect of an adaptive trait. The psychological trait in question is "if you hear a twig snap in the forest, some sentient force is probably behind it". This trait helps to prevent the [[primate]] from being murdered or eaten as food. However this hypothetical trait could remain in modern humans: thus some [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] theorize that "even if the snapping was caused by the wind, modern humans are still inclined to attribute the sound to a sentient agent; they call this person a [[gods|god]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | format = 
  | doi = 
  | accessdate =Dec 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gray and Wegner also said that agent detection is likely to be a "foundation for human belief in God" but "simple overattribution of agency cannot entirely account for the belief in God..." because the human ability to form a [[theory of mind]] and what they refer to as "existential theory of mind" are also required to "give us the basic cognitive capacity to conceive of God."&lt;ref name="BlamingGod" /&gt;

According to [[Justin L. Barrett]], having a scientific explanation for mental phenomena does not mean we should stop believing in them. “Suppose science produces a convincing account for why I think my wife loves me — should I then stop believing that she does?”&lt;ref&gt;[[The New York Times]] [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/magazine/04evolution.t.html?pagewanted=11&amp;ei=5087%0A&amp;em&amp;en=166dbd9e75680e73&amp;ex=1173243600 Darwin's God] March 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Ask Dr. Science''''' was a daily humorous radio sketch produced by members of the comedy troupe [[Duck's Breath Mystery Theatre]]. It is broadcast on many [[public radio]] stations, using a format that mixes elements of a [[commercial bumper]] and a [[public service announcement]].  A concerned citizen asks a question, which is answered by an expert, "Dr. Science."  Not surprisingly, the questions are never answered correctly, and are often little more than a launching point for a [[non sequitur (absurdism)|non sequitur]] [[monologue]] from Dr. Science.  The show's motto is "He knows more than you do."  The sketch always concludes with the [[disclaimer]] that he is "not a real doctor," although Dr. Science insists he has "a Master's Degree... in ''science''!"

The program features two Duck's Breath members, [[Dan Coffey]] as Dr. Science and [[Merle Kessler]] as his assistant/announcer Rodney.

In the segment's earliest days, it was known as ''Ask Mr. Science''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/02/arts/ask-dr-science-passes-a-landmark-puncturing-experts-2000-times.html?pagewanted=all Barron, James (1991). "'Ask Dr. Science' Passes a Landmark: Puncturing 'Experts' 2,000 Times", ''New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The character originated as a quasi-improvised part of the Duck’s Breath comedy show.  The questions for Dr. Science were solicited from the audience in advance.

==Other media==

Coffey and Kessler wrote ''The Official Dr. Science Big Book of Science Simplified!'' in 1986.

In 1987, a Dr. Science television series on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network starred all five members of the Duck's Breath Mystery Theatre, as well as Denny Dillon. It ran for about 12 episodes.[https://us.imdb.com/title/tt0309148/]

During the early 2000s, the [[Warner Bros.]] website Entertaindom aired a series of [[Computer-generated imagery|CG]] animated shorts featuring popular clips from the ''Ask Dr. Science'' radio broadcasts.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

==Geology==
[[File:1997 278-13 Sahara Niger.jpg|thumb|left|Desert near Agadez, with the Aïr Mountains in the distance. Note the volcanic outcrops, common to the Aïr.]]
The [[Precambrian]] to [[Cenozoic]] Aïr Mountains consist of [[peralkaline]] [[granite]] intrusions which appear dark in colour (unusual since most granitic masses are light-toned in the field). In the Sahara Desert such mountains often stand out in stark relief as topographic heights amidst lowlands covered by sand.&lt;ref&gt;[rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect17/Sect17_3.html Use of Remote Sensing in Basic Science Studies], Section 17, [[NASA]]/Primary Author: Nicholas M. Short, Sr. (Site last updated: June 18, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The terrain consists of high plateau, mountain ranges, and broad, sandy valleys and seasonal wadis which once contained rivers. Areas of these deep, often intersecting, valleys also contain waterborne clay and silt deposits.  Underground watercourses in some of these valleys continue to provide year-round oasis and seasonal vegetation.
[[File:G06 s65 63158.jpg|thumb|Circular granite massifs (dark areas). A volcanic crater can be seen at the lower left. NASA image approximately {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} across.]]

The Aïr mountains themselves consist of nine almost circular massifs rising from a rocky plateau, bordered by the sand dunes and plain of the [[Ténéré|Ténéré Desert]] to the east. The massif is a [[plateau]] consisting of a sub-[[Cambrian]] age [[erosion surface]] on Precambrian [[metamorphic rock]]s, punctuated by a series of flat-topped, granite intrusion peaks, which include [[Mont Idoukal-n-Taghès]] (Niger's highest point at 2022&amp;nbsp;m),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite peakbagger |pid=11062 |name=Mont Bagzane, Niger}}: incorrectly calls peak Mont Bagzane.  Name of the peak is "Idoukal-n-Taghès", part of the plateau named "Bagzane". Also note, official and international sources believed Mont Greboun to be the highest peak as late as 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mont Tamgak]] (1988&amp;nbsp;m), [[Mont Greboun]] (1944&amp;nbsp;m),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite peakbagger |pid=11061 |name=Mont Greboun, Niger}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adrar Bous]], [[Fadei]], [[Chirriet]], [[Taghmert]], [[Agueraguer]], [[Takaloukouzet]], and [[Goundai]].

The massif contains [[volcanic]] features including the extinct [[caldera]] of Arakao, [[Cenozoic]] lava flows of [[hawaiite]] to [[trachyte]] composition, [[volcanic cone]]s, [[tuff]] rings and one of the largest [[Ring dike|ring dike system]]s in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Paul D.

==Climate==
[[File:Timia Oasis.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Guelta]] near the town of [[Timia]] in central Aïr provides year-round water in an otherwise dry region.]]
Because of its altitude (on average between 500 and 900&amp;nbsp;m) and despite its low rainfall (50 to 160&amp;nbsp;mm/year on the lower plateau), the Aïr forms a green region in comparison with the surrounding deserts, especially after the August–September seasonal rains. The climate is classified as [[Sahel]], like that of the regions well to its south.  While the mountains are largely bare of vegetation, the dry [[wadi]] river valleys (known by the [[Hausa language|Hausa]] term "''Kori''") channel and hold rainwater in [[guelta]]s (stone pools, such as that near the town of [[Timia]]), creating oases which provide forage for animals, and in some areas, farming.  The high Bagzane plateau of the central Aïr in particular provides adequate rainfall for intensive agriculture.  Other, vast, areas  of the region are entirely devoid of plant life and with their volcanic protrusions and [[Hamada|rock fields]] present an otherworldly appearance.

==Vegetation==
More than 430 vascular species has been recorded so far in the Aïr mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Bruneau de Miré, P. &amp; Gillet, H. 1956. Contribution à l'étude de la flore du massif de l'Aïr – Première partie. Journal d'Agronomie Tropicale et de Botanique Appliquée 3,422–438&lt;/ref&gt; The location of the Aïr as a southern extension of the Hoggar mountain range makes it a connection between the Saharan Flora and the Sahelian Flora.&lt;ref&gt;Ozenda, P., 2004. Flore du Sahara, third ed. CNRS, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the presence of mountains up to 2000 m a.s.l. generates locally favourable conditions for several species of the Sudanian zone and the Mediterranean zone.&lt;ref&gt;Poilecot in Giazzi, F., 1996.

During the 20th century a series of scientific missions in the Aïr has permitted to identify the majority of plant species developing in the Aïr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aubréville | first1 = A | year = 1938 | title = La forêt coloniale – les forêts de l'Afrique occidentale française | url = | journal = Ann.

In the vicinity of temporary rivers named ''koris'', species like ''[[Acacia nilotica]]'', ''[[Faidherbia albida]]'' and the palm ''[[Hyphaene thebaica]]'' coexist with planted date palms ''[[Phoenix dactylifera]]''. Severe droughts and high aridity have made the intermountain zone of the Aïr a particularly harsh place for plants to develop.&lt;ref&gt;Poilecot in Giazzi, F., 1996.

In comparison, mountainous areas are even less documented.

Three ferns were found for the first time in the Aïr recently, ''[[Cheilanthes coriacea]]'', ''[[Actiniopteris radiata]]'', and ''[[Ophioglossum polyphyllum]]'', suggesting that ferns may be more prone to develop in arid environments than commonly proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anthelme | first1 = F. | last2 = Abdoulkader | first2 = A. | last3 = Viane | first3 = R. | year = 2011 | title =  Are ferns in arid environments underestimated?

Because of their strong geographic isolation within a Saharan matrix, these species have a high conservation value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anthelme | first1 = F. | last2 = Waziri Mato | first2 = M. | last3 = Maley | first3 = J. | year = 2008 | title =  Elevation and local refuges ensure persistence of mountain specific vegetation in the Nigerien Sahara| url = | journal = Journal of Arid Environments| volume =  72| issue = 12| pages =  2232–2242| doi = 10.1016/j.jaridenv.2008.07.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population==
The town of [[Agadez]] in the heart of the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] country is the capital of Aïr. Much of the Tuareg population of Aïr until recently led a [[nomad]]ic life, relying essentially on camel and goats from which they take milk, meat and skins used in the production of local handicrafts.  Most sedentary populations were either dependents of higher caste Tuareg pastoralists or the [[Ikelan]] ( ''Bouzou'' in Hausa / ''Bella'' in [[Songhay languages|Songhai]]), former slaves and captives of the Tuareg from [[Hausa people|Hausa]] and other southern peoples.  These peoples were settled in northern oases, to tend the [[date palm]] plantations held by the noble clans.

Agriculture products from oases such as [[Timia]], [[Aouderas]] and [[Tabelot]] are traditionally exchanged against clothes, or salt, brought by camel caravans ([[Azalai]]) from the remote Tenere oases of [[Bilma]] and [[Fachi]] to the east.

==History==
[[File:Air massif sat map south.png|left|thumb|upright=1.3|Map of the southern Aïr Mountains.]]
The Aïr is known for its [[rock art]], dating from 6000 BC to around AD 1000.  During the [[Neolithic Subpluvial]] the region was a [[pastoral]] area, as is illustrated by images of cattle and large mammals. During the 3rd millennium BC, however, a process of [[desertification]] began and the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] from further north migrated into the region. Later art indicated war, depicting [[horse]]s and [[chariot]]s.  In particular, a five-meter-high carving of a [[giraffe]] at [[Dabous]] discovered in 1999 is internationally famous.  Cave art in the region is predominantly [[stone carving]], initially with sharp rock, and from around 1200 BC perhaps with metal.&lt;ref&gt;Trust for African Rock Art. ROCK ART OF SAHARA AND NORTH AFRICA:THEMATIC STUDY.  [http://www.icomos.org/studies/rockart-sahara-northafrica/07sous-zone3.pdf David COULSON. Sub-Zone 3: Niger] (June 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Tuareg tribes were pushed south by Arab invaders in the eighth and ninth centuries, there were [[Gobir]]wa [[Hausa people|Hausa]] in the southern Aïr.  Successive Tuareg ''Tel''s have controlled the area since at least the twelfth century.  Agadez, as well as [[In-Gall]] to the east, were the farthest outposts of the [[Songhai Empire]] in the early 15th century.  In the sixteenth century the area fell under the newly created Tuareg [[Sultanate of Aïr]], and remained so until the arrival of the [[French West Africa|French]] at the end of the 19th.

The emergence of the French weakened the Tuareg Kels and provoked both infighting and resistance to colonialism.  From the 1880s, Toubu raids increased, and when the Tuareg [[Ag Mohammed Wau Teguidda Kaocen]] rose against the French in 1917, many towns were destroyed on his way to the siege of Agadez.  When the French retook Agadez, a brutal [[punitive expedition]] through the Aïr left many formerly populous places abandoned, razed by Kaosen and the French successively.&lt;ref&gt;Jolijn Geels. Niger. Bradt London and Globe Pequot New York (2006). {{ISBN|1-84162-152-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Kel Owey continued to dominate the settled oasis towns and pastoral herding, the sedentary farmers (Tuareg, Hausa, or Songhai) expanded farming and sedentary livestock cultivation in the mid-20th century.

The famines of the 1970s and 1980s brought an end to this expansion, and as [[Agadez]] and [[Arlit]] grew, the towns of the Aïr have shrunk.  The [[Tuareg Rebellion (1990–1995)|Tuareg Rebellion]] of the 1990s saw brutal government reprisals which depopulated many villages in the Aïr.  Peace from the mid-1990s, as well as the uranium mines of [[Arlit]] brought unprecedented growth to the region, with many small towns gaining valuable tourism revenue.  In 2004, a locust invasion ravaged many gardens, bringing scarcity and contributing to the [[Second Tuareg Rebellion]] (beginning in 2007) which continues to plague the region, effectively ending the nascent tourist industry.&lt;ref&gt;Geels (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barbara Georgina Adams''', [[Royal Society of Arts|FRSA]] (19 February 1945 &amp;ndash; 26 June 2002) was a distinguished British [[Egyptologist]] and specialist in [[Prehistoric Egypt|predynastic]] history. She worked for many years at [[Hierakonpolis]], where she was the co-director of the expedition. Before this she worked at the [[Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology]] in London and worked on excavations across Britain.

==Early career and the Petrie museum==
Barbara Bishop was born in [[Hammersmith Hospital]] in London to Charles and Ellaline Bishop. Her parents had unskilled jobs but she gained a scholarship to [[Godolphin and Latymer School]] but her finances did not run to study after sixteen.

She worked and studied in her own time and in 1962, she became an assistant at the  [[Natural History Museum]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; She specialised in [[entomology]] at the museum and she became an assistant of R.B. Benson. She transferred to Dr K.P. Oakley's anthropology department in 1964 where she became acquainted with tool-artefacts and gained a knowledge of human skeletal anatomy.&lt;ref name="Friedman Lesko"&gt;[http://www.brown.edu/Research/Breaking_Ground/bios/Adams_Barbara.pdf Barbara Adams, 1945-2002],  by Renée Friedman and Barbara Lesko, Brow.edu, Retrieved 11 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; in 1964 she won the ''Miss Hammersmith'' beauty contest and a book of her poetry ''Bones in my Soul'' was published.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

Adams became a museum assistant at the [[Petrie Museum]] of Egyptian Archaeology, at [[University College London]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;H. S. Smith, 'Adams, Barbara Georgina (1945–2002)', ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, Jan 2006; online edn, Jan 2009 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/77023, accessed 11 Oct 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Her employment with Professor Harry Smith, Edward Chair in Egyptian Archaeology of the University College, helped her career.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;[http://www.brown.edu/Research/Breaking_Ground/results.php?d=1&amp;first=Barbara&amp;last=Adams Barbara Adams], Brown.edu, Retrieved 11 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first practical experience in 1965 was an excavation in [[Yorkshire]] by the [[University of Leeds]]. Later the same year she assisted in cemetery digs in [[Winchester]] and elsewhere within England. Contacts with artifacts from the Romano-British site at Dragonby in Lincolnshire) in excavations of 1966 were followed by a seminal encounter in the same year with Hierakonpolis artefacts. In 1967 she married a civil servant named Rob Adams, moved to Enfield and also gained a distinction for her London University diploma in archaeology.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

She travelled to Egypt during 1969 and studied field techniques for archaeology at the university of Cambridge. Her 1974 text on the subject of ancient Hierakonpolis showed the catalogued findings of Quibell and Green and was complemented by a lauded explication of the F.W. Green field notes. She turned her literary attention intermittently in the proceeding years to archived documents held in museums of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Friedman Lesko"/&gt; In Liverpool museum she was able to find unpublished material gathered by [[John Garstang]]. Over many years she documented his work in three publications ''The Fort Cemetery At Hierakonpolis'' in 1984 and ''Ancient Nekhen'' in 1990 and 1995.&lt;ref name=gruniad/&gt;

==Hierakonpolis and onward==
Her work with Garstang's excavations paid off when she was chosen as the pottery and objects expert for [[Michael A. Hoffman]]'s re-established excavations of Hierakonpolis in 1979-80. She assisted at a cemetery of a predynastic elite group and she worked on the site until 1986. She had worked as an assistant to [[Walter Fairservis]] in 1981 at Nekhan and again in 1984.&lt;ref name=gruniad&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jul/13/guardianobituaries.obituaries?INTCMP=SRCH Obituary], Harry Smith, ''The Guardian'', 13 July 2002, Retrieved 11 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; After Hoffmann's death in 1990, Adams and [[Renée Friedman]] became co-directors of the Hierakonpolis excavation which continued until 1996. She has been credited with the discovery of previously unknown funeral-masks and a life-size statue. She was editor of the Shire Egyptology Series (numbering 25 books in total). Her final work was based upon vase fragments from a cemetery at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]].&lt;ref name="Friedman Lesko"/&gt;

Adams married her highschool sweetheart Britain Hamm in 1972 in her hometown of London.&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt; Adams died from cancer in 2002.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

A '''Charcoal burner''' is someone whose occupation is to manufacture [[charcoal]]. Traditionally this is achieved by carbonising wood in a [[charcoal pile]] or kiln. As an occupation it has almost died out in the first world countries.

Charcoal burning is one of the oldest human crafts. The knowledge gained from this industry still contributes to the solution of energy problems today. Due to its historical and cultural importance, charcoal burning and [[tar distilling]] were incorporated in December 2014 into the register of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in Germany by the ''[[Kultusministerkonferenz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kmk.org/presse-und-aktuelles/meldung/27-kulturformen-ins-deutsche-verzeichnis-des-immateriellen-kulturerbes-aufgenommen.html Press release by the ''Kultusministerkonferenz'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and technique ==

===Medieval charcoal burners===
Since the [[Iron Age]], high temperatures have had to be produced for iron [[smelting]], for [[glassmaking]] and for the working of [[precious metal]]s. Charcoal has been used to do this for centuries and, in order to produce it, entire forests were felled. With the increasing use of [[stone coal]] from the 18th century, the charcoal burning industry declined.

[[File:Otryt - Path 15.jpg|thumb|Charcoal burning in modern iron retorts, [[Otryt]], Poland]]

Even in [[ancient times]], charcoal was manufactured in kilns. Logs were arranged in a conical heap (a [[charcoal kiln]] or pile) around posts, a fire shaft was made using brushwood and wood chips and covered with an airtight layer of grass, moss and earth. The pile was ignited inside the fire shaft and, at a temperature of between 300 and 350&amp;nbsp;°C, the carbonization process began. The process took six to eight days - in large kilns several weeks - during which time the charcoal burner had to control the draught (by piercing small holes and resealing them), being careful neither to allow the pile to go out nor let it go up in flames. By observing the smoke exiting the kiln, the charcoal burner could assess the state of the carbonization process. If the smoke was thick and gray, the wood was still raw; thin, blue smoke indicated good carbonization.

In earlier times, charcoal burners led an austere, lonely life.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Sandles, [http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/char_coal.htm "Charcoal Burners"], ''Legendary Dartmoor,'' March 20, 2016. Retrieved June 29, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; They had to live near the kiln, usually in a charcoal burner's hut (''Köhlerhütte'' or ''[[Köte]]'' in Germany, Austria and Switzerland). During the Middle Ages, charcoal burners were ostracised. Their profession was considered dishonourable and they were frequently accused of evil practices.{{why|date=July 2017}} Even today there is a certain denigration of this former occupation. In the German language to have a charcoal burner's faith (''Köhlerglauben'') is to have blind faith in something. That aside, the continuing requirement to keep the kiln at the right temperature in all weathers meant that the job must have been arduous, lonely and, at times, dangerous.

===Modern===

Charcoal burning is still carried out commercially in parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndr.de/fernsehen/sendungen/weltbilder/videos/weltbilder2111.html Smokey Mountain in Manila] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029145716/http://www.ndr.de/fernsehen/sendungen/weltbilder/videos/weltbilder2111.html |date=October 29, 2012 }}, retrieved 15 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It is rare in Europe, but still practised in Romania,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20131106143109/http://www.geo.de/GEO/geo-tv/die-letzten-koehler-von-rumaenien-74094/ The last charcoal burners in Romania, GEO Report] dated 2 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Poland, and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Lynn, [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-swiss-charcoal/swiss-farmers-keep-tradition-of-charcoal-burning-idUSLQ29563720080903 "Swiss farmers keep tradition of charcoal-burning"], Reuters, Sept. 2, 2008.

Even in the 20th century, charcoal burners in remote areas like the [[Harz Mountains]] and the [[Thuringian Forest]], still used ''[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;u=https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillebille Hillebille]''s, a large contraption of beechwood boards, used as alarm and signal device. This is commemorated in the name of a mountain ridge in the Harz, called ''Hillebille''. Today the tradition of this old craft is mainly preserved in clubs and societies. The best known are the European Charcoal Burners' Society (''Europäische Köhlerverein'') and the Glasofen Charcoal Burners' Society (''Köhlerverein Glasofen'').

==In popular culture==

[[A. A. Milne]]'s poem "The Charcoal Burner" appeared in ''[[Now We Are Six]]'', a collection of verse.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Milne, ''[[Now We Are Six]]'', Methuen &amp; Co. Ltd. (London), 1927.&lt;/ref&gt;  It begins:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Charcoal Burner has tales to tell.
&lt;br&gt;He lives in the forest,
&lt;br&gt;alone in the forest;
&lt;br&gt;he sits in the forest,
&lt;br&gt;alone in the forest.
&lt;br&gt;And the sun comes slanting between the trees
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3208">__NOTOC__
In [[linguistics]], '''codification''' is the process of [[standard language|standardizing]] and developing a norm for a language.

Codifying a language can vary from case to case and depends on the stage of standardization that already exists. It typically means to develop a [[writing system]], set up official rules for [[grammar]], [[orthography]], [[pronunciation]], [[syntax]] and [[vocabulary]] as well as publishing grammar books, [[dictionary|dictionaries]] and similar guidelines.  Several variants exist for a specific aspect, e.g. different ways of spelling a word, decisions on which variant is going to be the standard one have to be made.

In some countries such codification is done by a body constituted by the state, such as the [[Académie française]]. Codification often happens due to new inventions, changes in values or other cultural influences. After the process of decolonialization, many [[Africa]]n states had to decide whether they wanted to keep the colonial language or chose one (or more) of their [[vernacular language|indigenous language]] varieties as official languages, which made [[language planning]] necessary.

In a well-known model of language planning by [[Einar Haugen]], codification is only the second step. Step one is the selection process, step three is the implementation of the changes in society and step four is the elaboration of vocabulary (especially technical terms).&lt;ref&gt;http://ofeliagarciadotorg.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/planning-spanish.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the process of language planning, two major levels exist: corpus planning and status planning ([[Heinz Kloss]]). Codification is part of the corpus planning of a language, because the "body" of the language itself is being planned as opposed to status planning, where the [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] and usage of a language is enhanced:&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2001, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

*Corpus planning: Codification of a language (step 2); elaborating its functions to meet language needs (step 4)
*Status planning: Selection of a language (step 1); implementing its functions by spreading it (step 3)

Whether the codification is successful depends heavily on its acceptance by the population as well as its form of implementation by the government, e.g. promoting its prestige and spread, teaching the norm in school and language courses, and so on.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2430">'''Constructed action''' and '''constructed dialogue''' are [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] features of languages where the speaker performs the role of someone else during a conversation or narrative. Metzger defines them as the way people "use their body, head, and eye gaze to report the actions, thoughts, words, and expressions of characters within a discourse".&lt;ref&gt;Metzger 1995, p. 256, cited in Braga and Talbot 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Constructed action is when a speaker performs the actions of someone else in the narrative, while constructed dialogue is when a speaker acts as the other person in a reported dialogue. Constructed action is very common cross-linguistically.

==Constructed action==
Constructed action is common in many languages when telling stories or reporting the actions of others. During a narrative, the speaker not only reports the actions of others but performs them as well. The actions performed are not the exact actions of the person but an action constructed by the speaker. Liddell gives the example of a speaker patting their pockets when talking about someone having lost their keys. Since the speaker has not lost their own keys, the only reason they would pat their pockets would be to illustrate the story they are telling. The addressee then understands these actions not as the speaker's but of a character within the story.

==Constructed dialogue==
Constructed dialogue is when a speaker assumes the role of a character in the discourse. It often includes role-shifting, directed gaze, and body movement. For example, in [[American Sign Language]], a speaker may utilize constructed dialogue by shifting their body to denote different characters and directing their gaze to particular points. The signs produced are then understood as the signing of the character, not of the speaker themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6442">The '''conversational Model of [[psychotherapy]]''' was devised by the [[England|English]] psychiatrist [[Robert Hobson (psychiatrist)|Robert Hobson]], and developed by the [[Australia]]n [[psychiatrist]] [[Russell Meares]]. Hobson listened to recordings of his own psychotherapeutic practice with more disturbed clients, and became aware of the ways in which a patient's self – their unique sense of personal being – can come alive and develop, or be destroyed, in the flux of the conversation in the consulting room.

The conversational model views the aim of therapy as allowing the growth of the patient's self through encouraging a form of conversational relating called 'aloneness-togetherness'. This phrase is reminiscent of Winnicott's idea of the importance of being able to be 'alone in the presence of another'. The client comes to eventually feel recognised, accepted and understood as who they are; their sense of personal being, or self, is fostered; and they can start to drop the destructive defenses which disrupt their sense of personal being.

The development of the self implies a capacity to embody and span the dialectic of 'aloneness-togetherness' - rather than being disposed toward either schizoid isolation (aloneness) or merging identification with the other (togetherness). Although the therapy is described as [[psychodynamic]], and is accordingly concerned to identify activity and personal meaning in the midst of apparent passivity, it relies more on careful empathic listening and the development of a common 'feeling language' than it does on [[psychoanalytic]] interpretation.

==Psychodynamic Interpersonal Therapy (PIT)==

In its manualised form ('PIT'), the conversational model is presented as having seven interconnected components.&lt;ref name="Guthrie"&gt;Guthrie, E. (1999) ''Psychodynamic interpersonal therapy'', [http://apt.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/5/2/135.pdf Advances in Psychiatric Treatment, 5: 135-145].&lt;/ref&gt; These are:

* Developing an exploratory rationale
&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Together with the patient generate an understanding which links emotional or somatic symptoms with interpersonal difficulties 
* Shared understanding
&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In developing a shared understanding, the therapist uses statements rather than questions, uses mutual ('I' and 'We') language, deploys conditional rather than absolute statements of understanding, allows metaphorical elaborations of the patient's experience to unfold, and makes tentative interpretations or 'hypotheses' about the meaning of the patient's experience.
* Focus on the 'here and now'
&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Feelings that are present in the room are encouraged; abstract talk about feelings by the therapist is discouraged.
* Focus on difficult feelings
&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Gently commenting on the presence of hidden feelings or the absence of expected feelings.
* Gaining insight
&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Interpretations are provided which link the dynamics of the current therapeutic interaction with problematic present and past interactions in the patient's life.
* Sequencing interpretations
&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The therapist does not jump in with explanatory interpretations before laying the groundwork of the therapeutic relationship and jointly understanding the emotions present in the room.
* Acknowledging change
&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Emotional changes that are made by the patient during therapy are offered positive reinforcement.

[[File:La Vérendrye.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A coureur des bois in the painting, ''La Vérendrye at the Lake of the Woods'', circa 1900-1930]]

A '''coureur des bois''' ({{IPA-fr|kuʁœʁ de bwa}}) or '''coureur de bois''' ({{IPA-fr|kuʁœʁ də bwa}}; "runner of the woods"; plural: '''coureurs de bois''') was an independent entrepreneurial [[French-Canadian]] trader who traveled in [[New France]] and the interior of [[North America]].  They ventured into unsettled areas (the woods) usually to trade with First Nations peoples: exchanging various European items for furs. Along the way they learned the trades and practices of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native]] people. These expeditions were part of the beginning of the [[North American fur trade|fur trade in the North American interior]]. Initially they traded for [[North American beaver|beaver]] coats but, as the market grew, ''coureurs de bois'' were trapping and trading prime beavers whose skins were to be felted in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Daschuk |title=Clearing the Plains: Disease, Politics of Starvation, and the Loss of Aboriginal Life |publisher=University of Regina Press |date=2013 |p=15 |isbn=978-0-8897-7296-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
While the French had been trading and living among the natives since the earliest days of New France, coureurs des bois reached their apex during the second half of the 17th century. After 1681, the independent coureur des bois was gradually replaced by state-sponsored [[voyageurs]], who were workers associated with licensed fur traders. They traveled extensively by canoe. Coureurs des bois lost their importance in the fur trade by the early 18th century. However, even while their numbers were dwindling, the coureur des bois developed as a symbol of the colony, creating a lasting myth that would continue to define [[New France]] for centuries.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mémoires de Nouvelle-France: De France En Nouvelle-France|last = Wien|first = Thomas|publisher = Presses Universitaires de Rennes.|year = 2005|location = Rennes|pages = 179–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1610–1630: early explorers and interpreters ===
Shortly after founding a permanent settlement at [[Quebec City]] in 1608, [[Samuel de Champlain]] sought to ally himself with the local native peoples or First Nations. He decided to send French boys to live among them to learn their languages in order to serve as interpreters, in the hope of persuading the natives to trade with the French rather than with the Dutch, who were active along the Hudson River and Atlantic coast.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Les Indiens Blancs: Français et Indiens en Amérique du Nord, XVIe-XVIIIe siècle |last = Jacquin |first = P. |publisher = Libre Expression |year = 1996 |isbn = |location = Montréal |pages = 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These boys learned native languages, customs, and skills, and tended to assimilate quickly to their new environments. For instance, upon visiting [[Étienne Brûlé]] a year after leaving him in 1610 with a [[Huron tribe]], Champlain was surprised to find the young boy attired completely in native clothing and able to converse fluently in the Huron language.&lt;ref name=":0.1"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Early explorers such as Brûlé could educate the French colonists on the complex trading networks of the natives, serve as interpreters, and encourage the burgeoning fur trade. Between 1610 and 1629, dozens of Frenchmen spent months at a time living among the natives. Over time, these early explorers and interpreters played an increasingly active role in the fur trade, paving the way for the emergence of the coureurs des bois proper in the mid-17th century.

=== 1649–1681: rise ===

[[File: Edict of King making selling fur illegal.jpg|thumb|Edict of the King of France in 1681, limiting fur trade participation]]
The term "coureur des bois" is most strongly associated with those who engaged in the [[fur trade]] in ways that were considered to be outside of the mainstream.&lt;ref name="Canadian frontier"&gt;{{cite book |last=Eccles |first=W.J. |title=The Canadian Frontier 1534–1760 |ISBN=0-8263-0705-1 |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |location=Albuquerque |date=1983 |orig-year=1969 |edition=revised |url={{google books|EksQ2jB5__UC|plainurl=yes}} |access-date=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the [[North American fur trade]] era, this term was applied to men who circumvented the normal channels by going deeper into the wilderness to trade.

Traditionally, the government of New France preferred to let the natives supply furs directly to French merchants, and discouraged French settlers from venturing outside the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint Lawrence]] valley. By the mid-17th century, [[Montreal]] had emerged as the center of the fur trade, hosting a yearly fair in August where natives exchanged their pelts for European goods.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The people of New France|last = Greer|first = Allan|publisher = University of Toronto Press|year = 1997|isbn = |location = Toronto|pages = 53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while coureurs des bois never entirely disappeared, they were heavily discouraged by French colonial officials. In 1649, however, the new [[Governor of New France|governor]] [[Louis d'Ailleboust de Coulonge|Louis d'Ailleboust]] permitted Frenchmen familiar with the wilderness to visit "Huron country" to encourage and escort Hurons to Montreal to participate in the trade.&lt;ref name=":0.2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Les Indiens blancs: Français et Indiens en Amérique du Nord, XVIe-XVIIIe siècle|last = Jacquin|first = P.|publisher = Libre Expression|year = 1996|isbn = |location = Montréal|pages = 105}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this did not legally sanction coureurs des bois to trade independently with the natives, some historians consider d'Ailleboust's encouragement of independent traders to mark the official emergence of the coureurs des bois.&lt;ref name=":0.2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A history of Canada|last = Lancotôt|first = Guylaine|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 1997|isbn = |location = Cambridge|pages = 248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1660s, several factors resulted in a sudden spike in the number of coureurs des bois. First, the population of New France markedly increased during the late 17th century, as the colony experienced a boom in immigration between 1667–84.&lt;ref name=":2.1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The people of New France|last = Greer|first = Allan|publisher = University of Toronto Press|year = 1997|isbn = |location = Toronto|pages = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the new [[Indentured servant|''engagés'']] (indentured male servants), discharged soldiers, and youthful immigrants from squalid, class-bound Europe arriving in great numbers in the colony, many chose freedom in the life of the coureur des bois. Furthermore, renewed peaceful relations with the [[Iroquois]] in 1667 made traveling into the interior of Canada much less perilous for the French colonists.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Middle Ground: Indians, Empires, and Republics in the Great Lakes Region, 1650-1815|last = White|first = Richard|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1991|isbn = |location = Cambridge|pages = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The companies that had been monopolizing and regulating the fur trade since 1645, the [[Company of One Hundred Associates|''Cent Associés'']] and the ''Communautés des Habitants'', went bankrupt after the [[Beaver Wars|Iroquois war]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Habitants and Merchants in seventeenth-century Montreal|last = Dechêne|first = Louise|publisher = McGill-Queen's University Press|year = 1992|isbn = |location = Quebec|pages = 74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[French West India Company|''Compagnie des Indes occidentales'']], which replaced them, was much less restrictive of internal trade, allowing independent merchants to become more numerous. Finally, a sudden fall in the price of beaver on the European markets in 1664 caused more traders to travel to the ''"pays d'en haut"'', or upper country (the area around the Great Lakes), in search of cheaper pelts.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; During the mid-1660s, therefore, becoming a coureur des bois became both more feasible and profitable.

This sudden growth alarmed many colonial officials. In 1680, the [[Intendant of New France|intendant]] [[Jacques Duchesneau de la Doussinière et d'Ambault|Duchesneau]] estimated that there were eight hundred coureurs des bois, or about 40% of the adult male population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Canadian types of the old regime:1608-1698|last = Colby|first = Charles W.|publisher = H. Holt and Co.|year = 1908|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 193}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, reports like that were wildly exaggerated: in reality, even at their zenith coureurs des bois remained a very small percentage of the population of New France.

=== 1681–1715: decline ===
In 1681, to curb the unregulated business of independent traders and their burgeoning profits, French minister of marine [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] created a system of licenses for fur traders, known as ''congés''.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Making the voyageur world: Travellers and traders in the North American fur trade|last = Podruchny|first = Carolyn|publisher = University of Nebraska Press|year = 2006|isbn = |location = Lincoln|pages = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, this system granted 25 annual licenses to merchants traveling inland. The recipients of these licenses came to be known as "voyageurs" (travelers), who canoed and portaged fur trade goods in the employ of a licensed fur trader or fur trading company. The congé system, therefore, created the voyageur, the legal and respectable counterpart to the coureur des bois. Under the voyageurs, the fur trade began to favor a more organized business model of the times, including monopolistic ownership and hired labor. From 1681 onwards, therefore, the voyageurs began to eclipse the coureurs des bois, although coureurs des bois continued to trade without licenses for several decades.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Following the implementation of the congé system, the number of coureurs des bois dwindled, as did their influence within the colony.

=== Skills===
A successful coureur des bois had to possess many skills, including those of businessman and expert canoeist.&lt;ref name="Chronicle_Coureur"&gt;{{cite web |title = The Coureur de Bois|website = The Chronicles of America|access-date = February 11, 2012|url = http://www.chroniclesofamerica.com/french/coureur_de_bois.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; To survive in the Canadian wilderness, coureurs des bois also had to be competent in a range of activities including fishing, snowshoeing and hunting.&lt;ref name="coureurs2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Coureur de Bois: Courage and Canoes |website=Exploration, the Fur Trade and the Hudson Bay Company |publisher=Canadiana.org |url=http://www.canadiana.ca/hbc/stories/coureurs2_e.html |archive-date=February 27, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227060652/http://www.canadiana.ca/hbc/stories/coureurs2_e.html |access-date=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] described them, venturing into the wilderness suited "the sort of person who thought nothing of covering five to six hundred leagues by canoe, paddle in hand, or of living off corn and bear fat for twelve to eighteen months, or of sleeping in bark or branch cabins".&lt;ref name=":4.7"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Habitants and Merchants in seventeenth-century Montreal|last = Dechêne|first = Louise|publisher = McGill-Queen's University Press|year = 1992|isbn = |location = Quebec|pages = 122}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the life was both physically arduous and illegal, succeeding as a coureur was extremely difficult. However, the hope of making a profit motivated many, while the promise of adventure and freedom was enough to convince others to become outlaws.&lt;ref name=":0.12"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Les Indiens blancs: Français et Indiens en Amérique du Nord, XVIe-XVIIIe siècle|last = Jacquin|first = P.|publisher = Libre Expression|year = 1996|isbn = |location = Montréal|pages = 136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Long distance fur trade and canoe travel ===
[[File:Voyageur canoe.jpg|alt=depicted in 1868 by Frances Anne Hopkins|thumb|''Canoe Manned by Voyageurs Passing a Waterfall 1868'', by Frances Anne Hopkins (1838–1919)]]
Because of the lack of roads and the necessity to transport heavy goods and furs, fur trade in the interior of the continent depended on men conducting long-distance transportation by canoe of fur trade goods, and returning with pelts. Early travel was dangerous and the ''coureurs des bois'', who traded in uncharted territory, had a high mortality rate. Typically, they left Montreal in the spring, as soon as the rivers and lakes were clear of ice (usually May), their canoes loaded with supplies and goods for trading. The course west to the richest [[North American beaver|beaver]] lands usually went by way of the [[Ottawa River|Ottawa]] and [[Mattawa River|Mattawa]] rivers; it required numerous overland portages. Alternatively, some canoes proceeded by way of the upper [[St. Lawrence River]] and the lakes, passing by [[Detroit]] on the way to [[Michilimackinac]] or [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]]. This route had fewer portages, but in times of war, it was more exposed to Iroquois attacks. The powerful Five Nations of the Confederacy had territory along the Great Lakes and sought to control their hunting grounds.

Such trading journeys often lasted for months and covered thousands of kilometers, with the ''coureurs des bois'' sometimes paddling twelve hours a day.&lt;ref name="coureurs2" /&gt; Packing a canoe for such a trip was often arduous, as more than thirty articles were considered essential for a coureur des bois's survival and business. He could trade for food, hunt, and fish—but trade goods such as "broadcloth, linen and wool blankets, ammunition, metal goods (knives, hatchets, kettles), firearms, liquor, gunpowder and sometimes even finished clothing, took up the majority of space in the canoe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=James M. |last1=Volo |first2=Dorothy Denneen |last2=Volo |title=Daily Life on the Old Colonial Frontier |location=Westport, Connecticut |publisher=Greenwood Press |date=2002 |pp=176–177 |url={{google books|tYO1CM-W-dQC|plainurl=yes}} |access-date=October 5, 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Food en route needed to be lightweight, practical and non-perishable.

=== Relationships with the natives ===
{{main|Marriage 'à la façon du pays'}}
The business of a ''coureur des bois'' required close contact with the indigenous peoples. [[Native peoples]] were essential because they trapped the fur-bearing animals (especially beaver) and prepared the skins. Relations between ''coureurs'' and natives were not always peaceful, and could sometimes become violent.&lt;ref name=":3.0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The middle ground: Indians, empires, and republics in the Great Lakes region, 1650-1815|last = White|first = Richard|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1991|isbn = |location = Cambridge|pages = 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, however, trade was made much easier by the two groups maintaining friendly relations. Trade was often accompanied by reciprocal gift-giving; to the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] and others, exchanging gifts was customary practice to maintain alliances.&lt;ref name=":3.1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Middle Ground: Indians, Empires, and Republics in the Great Lakes Region, 1650-1815|last = White|first = Richard|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1991|isbn = |location = Cambridge|pages = 107}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson]] and his companions, for instance, "struck agreeable relations with Natives inland by giving European goods as gifts".&lt;ref name="Colpitts"&gt;{{cite journal |first=George |last=Colpitts |title='Animated like Us by Commercial Interests': Commercial Ethnology and Fur Trade Descriptions in New France, 1660-1760 |journal=Canadian Historical Review |location=Toronto |publisher=University of Toronto Press |date=2002 |volume=83 |issue=3 |doi=10.3138/CHR.83.3.305 |url=http://www.utpjournals.press/doi/abs/10.3138/CHR.83.3.305 |access-date=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Alfred Jacob Miller - "Bourgeois" W---r, and His Squaw - Walters 37194078.jpg|thumb|left|'''[[Bourgeois]]' W---r, and His Squaw'' (A French trapper and a Native American woman) 1858–1860, by Alfred Jacob Miller (1810–1874) |alt=depicted ca. 1858–1860 by Alfred Jacob Miller]]Furthermore, relations between the coureur de bois and the natives often included a sexual dimension; [[Marriage 'à la façon du pays']] (following local custom) was common between native women and coureurs des bois, and later between native women and voyageurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Louis |last=Bergeron |title=Tuberculosis strain spread by the fur trade reveals stealthy approach of epidemics, say Stanford researchers |work=Stanford University News |date=April 7, 2011 |access-date=February 27, 2012 |url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2011/april/tuberculous-genetic-analysis-040711.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; These unions were of benefit to both sides, and in later years, winter partners of major trading companies also took native wives. As wives, indigenous women played a key role as translators, guides and mediators- becoming "women between".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Sylvia |last=Van Kirk |title='Women in Between': Indian Women in Fur Trade Society in Western Canada |journal=Historical Papers / Communications historiques |publisher=Canadian Historical Association |volume=12 |issue=1 |date=1977 |p=42 |access-date=February 9, 2015 |doi=10.7202/030819ar |url=http://id.erudit.org/iderudit/030819ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; For one thing, Algonquin communities typically had far more women than men, likely as a result of warfare. The remaining marriages between Algonquins tended to be [[Polygamy|polygamous]], with one husband marrying two or more women. Sexual relationships with coureurs des bois therefore offered native women an alternative to polygamy in a society with few available men.&lt;ref name=":3.2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Middle Ground: Indians, Empires, and Republics in the Great Lakes Region, 1650-1815|last = White|first = Richard|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1991|isbn = |location = Cambridge|pages = 65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To French military commanders, who were often also directly involved in the fur trade, such marriages were beneficial in that they improved relations between the French and the natives. Native leaders also encouraged such unions, particularly when the couple formed lasting, permanent bonds. [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] and some upper-level colonial officials, however, viewed these relationships with dislike and disgust.&lt;ref name=":0.111"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Les Indiens blancs: Français et Indiens en Amérique du Nord, XVIe-XVIIIe siècle|last = Jacquin|first = P.|publisher = Libre Expression|year = 1996|isbn = |location = Montréal|pages = 164}}&lt;/ref&gt; French officials preferred coureurs des bois and voyageurs to settle around [[Quebec City]] and [[Montreal]]. They considered the lasting relationships with native women to be further proof of the lawlessness and perversion of the coureurs des bois.&lt;ref name=":3.3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Middle Ground: Indians, Empires, and Republics in the Great Lakes Region, 1650-1815|last = White|first = Richard|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1991|isbn = |location = Cambridge|pages = 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myths==
The role and importance of the coureurs des bois have been exaggerated over the course of history. This figure has achieved mythological status, leading to many false accounts, and to the coureurs des bois being assimilated with "''Canadiens''" (Canadians).

The myth-making followed two paths. Initially, people in France judged the colonies according to the fears and apprehensions that they had in the [[Ancien Régime]]. If order and discipline were proving difficult to maintain in continental Europe, then it seemed impossible that the colonies would fare any better; indeed, it was presumed that things would be even worse.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Accounts of young men choosing a life where they would "do nothing", be "restrained by nothing", and live "beyond the possibility of correction" played into the French elite's fears of insubordination&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and only served to confirm their prejudice; and thus coureurs des bois became emblematic of the colony for those in the metropolis. 
[[File:Pierre François Xavier Charlevoix.jpg|alt=French Jesuit Traveller and historian|thumb|Pierre François Xavier de Charlevoix (1682–1761)]]
The myth of the coureurs des bois as representative of the Canadians was stimulated by the writings of 18th-century Jesuit priest [[Pierre François Xavier de Charlevoix|F-X. Charlevoix]] and the 19th-century American historian [[Francis Parkman]]; their historical accounts are classified as belonging to popular rather than academic history.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Journal d'un voyage fait par ordre ru roi dans l'Amérique septentrionale|last = de Charlevoix|first = François-Xavier|publisher = Les Presses de l'Université de Montréal|year = 1994|isbn = |location = Montréal|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Charlevoix was particularly influential in his writings, because he was a trusted source of information, as he was a Jesuit priest who had journeyed in Canada. But his "historical" work has been criticized by historians for being too "light" and for relying too heavily on other authors' material (i.e. plagiarizing), rather than his own first-hand account.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Critics of Charlevoix have also noted that in his account, he confuses different periods of time, and therefore does not differentiate between voyageurs and coureurs des bois, misrepresenting the importance of the latter in terms of number and proportion in terms on influence on trading.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; But Charlevoix was influential; his work was often cited by other authors, which further propagated the myth of the Canadian as a coureur des bois.

Finally, [[Roman du terroir|romans du terroir]] (rural novels) also added to the myth of the coureurs des bois by featuring them out of proportion to their number and influence. The coureurs des bois were portrayed in such works as extremely virile, free-spirited and of untameable natures, ideal protagonists in the romanticized novels of important 19th-century writers such as [[François-René de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]], [[Jules Verne]] and [[James Fenimore Cooper|Fenimore Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Quebec and its Historians 1840 to 1920|last = Gagnon|first = Serge|publisher = Harvest House|year = 1982|isbn = |location = Montreal|pages = 87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==
Most coureurs des Bois were primarily or solely fur trade entrepreneurs and not individually well known. The most prominent coureurs des bois were also explorers and gained fame as such.

[[Étienne Brûlé]] was the first European to see the [[Great Lakes]]. He traveled to New France with Samuel de Champlain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |title=Brûlé, Étienne |first=Olga |last=Jurgens |volume=1 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/brule_etienne_1E.html |access-date=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Nicolet]] (Nicollet) de Belleborne (Ca. 1598 – 1 November 1642) was a French coureur des bois noted for exploring [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] in what is now the U.S. state of [[Wisconsin]]. Nicolet was born in [[Normandy]], France in the late 1590s and moved to [[New France]] in 1618. In that same year, he was recruited by [[Samuel de Champlain]] who arranged for him to live with a group of Algonquians, designated as the "Nation of the Isle" to learn [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native]] languages and later serve as an interpreter.&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield, 28{{citation needed|reason=This reference doesn't exist on this page|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Natives quickly adopted Nicolet as one of their own, even allowing him to attend councils and negotiate treaties. In 1620, Nicolet was sent to make contact with the [[Nipissing First Nation|Nipissing]], a group of natives who played an important role in the growing fur trade. After having established a good reputation for himself, Nicolet was sent on an expedition to [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] to settle a peace agreement with the Natives of that area.&lt;ref name=DCB_Nicollet&gt;{{cite DCB |title=Nicollet de Belleborne, Jean |first=Jean |last=Hamelin |volume=1 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/nicollet_de_belleborne_jean_1E.html |access-date=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Médard Chouart des Groseilliers]] (1618–1696) was a [[France|French]] explorer and fur trader in [[Canada]]. In the early 1640s, Des Groseilliers relocated to [[Quebec]], and began to work around Huronia with the Jesuit Missions in that area. There, he learned the skills of a ''coureur des bois'', and in 1653 married his second wife, Margueritte.&lt;ref&gt;Caesars, 39{{citation needed|reason=This reference doesn't exist on this page|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother, [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson]], also became a notable figure in the fur trade and is often mentioned in the same breath as des Groseilliers. Radisson and des Grosseilliers would also travel and trade together, as they did throughout the 1660s and 1670s. Together, they explored west into previously unknown territories in search of trade. Having incurred legal problems in [[New France]] because of their trade, the two explorers went to [[France]] in an attempt to rectify their legal situation. When this attempt failed, the pair turned to the English. Through this liaison with the English and thanks to their considerable knowledge and experience in the area, the pair are credited with the establishment of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Fournier 278{{citation needed|reason=This reference doesn't exist on this page|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre-Esprit Radisson]] (1636–1710) was a French-Canadian [[fur trader]] and explorer. His life as explorer and trader is crucially intertwined with that of his brother-in-law, [[Médard des Groseilliers]]. Radisson came to [[New France]] in 1651, settling in Trois-Rivières.&lt;ref&gt;Nute, 43{{citation needed|reason=Is this Nute (1987) ''The Voyageur''?|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he was captured by the Mohawks while duck hunting. Although two of his companions were killed during this exchange, the Natives spared Radisson's life and adopted him.&lt;ref&gt;Radisson{{citation needed|reason=Which reference is this?|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this adoption, Radisson learned native languages that would later serve him well as an interpreter. He worked throughout the 1660s and 1670s with his brother-in-law, des Groseilliers, on various trade and exploration voyages into the west of the continent. Much of Radisson's life during this period is wrapped up in the story of des Groseilliers. Together they are credited with the establishment and shaping of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |title=Radisson, Pierre-Esprit |first=Grace Lee |last=Nute |volume=2 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/radisson_pierre_esprit_2E.html |access-date=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut]] (1639–1710) was a French soldier and explorer who is the first European known to have visited the area where the city of Duluth, Minnesota is now located and the headwaters of the Mississippi River near Grand Rapids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |title=Greysolon Dulhut, Daniel |first=Yves F. |last=Zoltvany |volume=2 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/greysolon_dulhut_daniel_2E.html |access-date=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1910 [[Victor Herbert]] operetta [[Naughty Marietta (operetta)|''Naughty Marietta'']] featured the male-chorus marching song ''Tramp Tramp Tramp (Along the Highway)'', which included the words, "Blazing trails along the byway / Couriers de Bois are we" [sic]. (Some later versions change [[Rida Johnson Young]]'s lyric to "For men of war are we.")

In [[James A. Michener]]'s 1974 historical novel, ''[[Centennial (novel)|Centennial]]'' and the 1978–1979 [[NBC]] television [[mini-series]] of the ''[[Centennial (miniseries)|same name]]'', the colorful, [[French Canadian]] or [[Métis people (Canada)|French Metis]], coureur des bois, from [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada, named Pasquinel, was introduced as an early frontier mountain man and trapper, in 1795 [[Colorado]], [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spanish Upper Louisiana Territory]] of [[Mexico]], now the present-day state of Colorado. Pasquinel was portrayed in the miniseries by American TV actor [[Robert Conrad]]. The fictional character of Pasquinel was loosely based on the lives of French-speaking fur traders [[Jacques La Ramee]] and [[Ceran St. Vrain]]. In a 1990 skit called "Trappers," the Canadian comedy troupe [[The Kids in the Hall]] depict two trappers, Jacques  [[Dave Foley|(Dave Foley]]) and François ([[Kevin McDonald]]), canoeing through high-rise offices and cubicles to trap businessmen wearing designer Italian suits as a parody of this moment in Canadian colonial history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Nerdist|title=TRAPPER - Kids in the Hall|date=2013-02-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITLXo19248g|accessdate=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, in 2015, ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]'', directed by [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]], depicts a group of uncharacteristically violent, anti-Indian coureurs des bois in North Dakota, which was contrary to these trappers, who embraced the culture and way of life of Native Americans.

'''Cultural identity''' is the [[Identity (social science)|identity]] or feeling of belonging to a group. It is part of a person's self-conception and [[self-perception]] and is related to [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], [[social class]], [[generation]], [[locality (settlement)|locality]] or any kind of social group that has its own distinct [[culture]]. In this way, cultural identity is both characteristic of the [[individual]] but also of the culturally identical group of members sharing the same cultural identity or upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;Moha Ennaji, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DXsF7fT318QC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22cultural%20identity%22&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Multilingualism, Cultural Identity, and Education in Morocco]'', Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2005, pp.19-23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Child With Flag.jpg|thumb|Child with flag and a gun]]
Various modern [[cultural studies]] and [[social theories]] have investigated cultural identity and understanding . In recent decades, a new form of identification has emerged which breaks down the understanding of the individual as a coherent whole subject into a collection of various cultural identifiers. These cultural identifiers may be the result of various conditions including: [[Location (geography)|location]], [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[history]], [[nationality]], [[language]], [[sexual orientation|sexuality]], [[religious beliefs]], [[ethnicity]], [[aesthetics]], and even [[food]].&lt;ref&gt;Manufacturing Taste: TheWalrus.ca&lt;/ref&gt; As one author writes, recognizing both coherence and fragmentation:

{{cquote|categorizations about identity, even when codified and hardened into clear typologies by processes of colonization, state formation or general modernizing processes, are always full of tensions and contradictions. Sometimes these contradictions are destructive, but they can also be creative and positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2015 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | title= Despite the Terrors of Typologies: The Importance of Understanding Categories of Difference and Identity | url=https://www.academia.edu/11768378 | journal= Interventions: International Journal of Postcolonial Studies | volume=  17 | issue=  2 | pages= 174–195 | doi=10.1080/1369801x.2014.993332}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The divisions between cultures can be very fine in some parts of the world, especially in rapidly changing cities where the population is ethnically diverse and social unity is based primarily on locational contiguity.

As a "historical reservoir," culture is an important factor in shaping identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Nicola |last=Pratt |title=Identity, Culture and Democratization: The Case of Egypt |journal=New Political Science |volume=27 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=69–86 |doi=10.1080/07393140500030832 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since one of the main characteristics of a culture is its "historical reservoir," many if not all groups entertain revisions, either consciously or unconsciously, in their historical record in order to either bolster the strength of their cultural identity or to forge one which gives them precedent for actual reform or change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shindler|first1=Michael|title=A Discussion On The Purpose of Cultural Identity|url=http://theapollonianrevolt.com/structure-purpose-cultural-identity/|publisher=The Apollonian Revolt|accessdate=10 April 2015|date=2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419090905/http://theapollonianrevolt.com/structure-purpose-cultural-identity/|archivedate=19 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some critics of cultural identity argue that the preservation of cultural identity, being based upon difference, is a divisive force in society, and that [[cosmopolitanism]] gives individuals a greater sense of shared citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_A6qIkbYB_kC ''The Limits of Nationalism''] by Chaim Gans. {{ISBN|978-0-521-00467-1}} {{ISBN|0521004675}}&lt;/ref&gt; When considering practical association in international society, states may share an inherent part of their 'make up' that gives common ground and an alternative means of identifying with each other.&lt;ref&gt;C Brown (2001) ''Understanding International Relations''. Hampshire, Palgrave&lt;/ref&gt; Nations provide the framework for culture identities called external cultural reality, which influences the unique internal cultural realities of the individuals within the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Terrence N TiceTHE EDUCATION DIGEST, V. 64 (9), 05/1999, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Also of interest is the interplay between cultural identity and [[new media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Singh | first1 = C. L. | year = 2010 | title = New media and cultural identity | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/New+media+and+cultural+identity.-a0219656567 | journal = China Media Research | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | page = 86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than necessarily representing an individual's interaction within a certain group, cultural identity may be defined by the social network of people imitating and following the [[agenda setting|social norms as presented by the media]]. Accordingly, instead of learning [[behaviour]] and knowledge from cultural/religious groups, individuals may be learning these social norms from the media to build on their cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insanbilimleri.com/ojs/index.php/uib/article/view/406|title=Media and cultural identity - Mora - International Journal of Human Sciences|website=insanbilimleri.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A range of cultural complexities structure the way individuals operate with the cultural realities in their lives. [[Nation]] is a large factor of the cultural complexity, as it constructs the foundation for individual's identity but it may contrast with ones cultural reality. Cultural identities are influenced by several different factors such as ones [[religion]], ancestry, skin colour, language, [[Class (social)|class]], education, profession, skill, family and political [[Propositional attitude|attitudes]]. These factors contribute to the development of one's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holliday|first=Adrian|title=Complexity in cultural identity|journal=Language and Intercultural Communication|date=May 2010|volume=10|issue=2|page=177|doi=10.1080/14708470903267384-2196217058202341170.pdf|doi-broken-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural identity is essentially how we as individuals cater to all positions of our lives. We may be teachers, students, friends, bosses, employees, etc. How we act and how our schemas contribute to our positions are the building blocks of your overall cultural identity.

==Cultural arena==
It is also noted that an individual's "[[Social environment|cultural arena]]", or place where one lives, impacts the culture that that person chooses to abide by. The surroundings, the environment, the people in these places play a factor in how one feels about the culture they wish to adopt. Many immigrants find the need to change their culture in order to [[Acculturation|fit into the culture]] of most citizens in the country. This can conflict with an immigrant's current [[World view|belief in their culture]] and might pose a problem, as the immigrant feels compelled to choose between the two presenting cultures.

Some might be able to adjust to the various cultures in the world by [[Biculturalism|committing to two or more cultures]]. It is not required to stick to one culture. Many people socialize and interact with people in one culture in addition to another group of people in another culture. Thus cultural identity is able to take many forms and can change depending on the cultural area. The nature of the impact of cultural arena has changed with the advent of the Internet, bringing together groups of people with shared cultural interests who before would have been more likely to integrate into their real world cultural arena. This plasticity is what allows people to feel like part of society wherever they go.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holliday | first1 = A | year = 2010 | title = Complexity in cultural identity | url = | journal = Language and Intercultural Communication | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 165–177 | doi = 10.1080/14708470903267384 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
Language develops from the wants of the people who tend to disperse themselves in a common given location over a particular period of time. This tends to allow people to share a way of life that generally links individuals in a certain culture that is identified by the people of that group. The affluence of communication that comes along with sharing a language promotes connections and roots to ancestors and cultural histories.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Language can function as a fluid and ever changing identifier, and can be developed in response or rebellion of another cultural code, such as creole languages in the US &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Stuart|last2=Ghazoul|first2=Ferial|date=2012-01-01|title=Cultural identity and diaspora|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA302403835&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;linkaccess=fulltext&amp;issn=11108673&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;authCount=1&amp;isAnonymousEntry=true|journal=Alif: Journal of Comparative Poetics|language=English|issue=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Language also includes the way people speak with peers, family members, authority figures, and strangers, including the tone and familiarity that is included in the language.

Language learning process can also be affected by cultural identity via the understanding of specific words, and the preference for specific words when learning and using a [[Multilingualism|second language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=Bok-Myung|title=Cultural Identity in Korean English|journal=Journal of Pan-Pacific Association of Applied Linguistics|year=2010|volume=14|issue=1|pages=131–145|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=EJ920507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since many aspects of a person's cultural identity can be changed, such as citizenship or influence from outside cultures can change cultural traditions, language is a main component of cultural identity.

==Education==
Kevin McDonough pointed out, in his article, several factors concerning support or rejection of the government for different cultural identity education systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McDonough | first1 = Kevin | year = 1998 | title = Can the Liberal State Support Cultural Identity Schools? | url = | journal = American Journal of Education | volume = 106 | issue = 4| pages = 463–499 | doi=10.1086/444195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have also shown concern for the state support regarding equity for children, school transitions and multicultural education. During March 1998, the two authors, Linda D. Labbo and Sherry L. Field collected several useful books and resources to promote multicultural education in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Tice, Terrence N. [http://bf4dv7zn3u.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Cultural+identity&amp;rft.jtitle=The+Education+Digest&amp;rft.au=Terrence+N+Tice&amp;rft.date=1999-05-31&amp;rft.issn=0013-127X&amp;rft.eissn=1949-0275&amp;rft.volume=64&amp;rft.issue=9&amp;rft.spage=43&amp;rft.externalDBID=GTED&amp;rft.externalDocID=40876855 "Cultural Identity"], ''The Education Digest'', May 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immigrant identity development ==
Identity development among immigrant groups has been studied across a multi-dimensional view of [[acculturation]].  Dina Birman and Edison Trickett (2001) conducted a [[qualitative study]] through informal interviews with first-generation Soviet Jewish Refugee adolescents looking at the process of acculturation through three different dimensions: language competence, behavioral acculturation, and cultural identity.  The results indicated that, “…[[acculturation]] appears to occur in a linear pattern over time for most dimensions of acculturation, with acculturation to the American culture increasing and acculturation to the Russian culture decreasing.  However, Russian language competence for the parents did not diminish with length of residence in the country” (Birman &amp; Trickett, 2001).

In a similar study, Phinney, Horencyzk, Liebkind, and Vedder (2001) focused on a model, which concentrates on the interaction between immigrant characteristics and the responses of the majority society in order to understand the psychological effects of immigration. The researchers concluded that most studies find that being bicultural, having a combination of having a strong ethnic and national identity, yields the best adaptation in the new country of residence.  An article by LaFromboise, L. K. Colemna, and Gerton, reviews the literature on the impact of being bicultural.  It is shown that it is possible to have the ability to obtain competence within two cultures without losing one’s sense of identity or having to identity with one culture over the other. (LaFromboise Et Al. 1993) The importance of ethnic and national identity in the educational adaptation of immigrants indicates that a bicultural orientation is advantageous for school performance (Portes &amp; Rumbaut, 1990).  Educators can assume their positions of power in beneficially impactful ways for immigrant students, by providing them with access to their native cultural support groups, classes, after–school activities, and clubs in order to help them feel more connected to both native and national cultures.  It is clear that the new country of residence can impact immigrants’ identity development across multiple dimensions. Biculturalism can allow for a healthy adaptation to life and school. With many new immigrant youth, a school district in Alberta, Canada has gone as far as to partner with various agencies and professionals in an effort to aid the cultural adjustment of new Filipino immigrant youths &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=http://bild-lida.ca/journal/volume_2_2_2018/supporting-reconnecting-immigrant-families-with-english-language-learners-in-rural-schools-an-exploratory-study-of-filipino-arrivals-to-alberta/|title=Supporting Reconnecting Immigrant Families with English Language Learners in Rural Schools: An Exploratory Study of Filipino Arrivals to Alberta |first1=Gregory|last1=Tweedie|first2=Anja|last2=Dressler|first3=Cora-Leah|last3=Schmidt|| accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In the study cited, a combination of family workshops and teacher professional development aimed to improve the language learning and emotional development of these youths and families &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=http://bild-lida.ca/journal/volume_2_2_2018/supporting-reconnecting-immigrant-families-with-english-language-learners-in-rural-schools-an-exploratory-study-of-filipino-arrivals-to-alberta/|title=Supporting Reconnecting Immigrant Families with English Language Learners in Rural Schools: An Exploratory Study of Filipino Arrivals to Alberta |first1=Gregory|last1=Tweedie|first2=Anja|last2=Dressler|first3=Cora-Leah|last3=Schmidt|| accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==School transitions==
How great is "Achievement Loss Associated with the Transition to Middle School and High School"? John W. Alspaugh's research is in the September/October 1998 ''Journal of Educational Research'' (vol. 92, no. 1), 2026. Comparing three groups of 16 school districts, the loss was greater where the transition was from sixth grade than from a K-8 system. It was also greater when students from multiple elementary schools merged into a single middle school. Students from both K-8 and middle schools lost achievement in transition to high school, though this was greater for middle school students, and high school dropout rates were higher for districts with grades 6-8 middle schools than for those with K-8 elementary schools.&lt;ref name="Copyright Prakken Publications, Inc. May 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Terrence N|first=Tice|title=Cultural Identity|year=1999|publisher=Prakken Publications, Inc.|pages=43–44|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/218180019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jean S. Phinney Three-Stage Model of Ethnic Identity Development is a widely accepted view of the formation of cultural identity. In this model cultural Identity is often developed through a three-stage process: unexamined cultural identity, cultural identity search, and cultural identity achievement.

Unexamined cultural identity: "a stage where one's cultural characteristics are taken for granted, and consequently there is little interest in exploring cultural issues." This for example is the stage one is in throughout their childhood when one doesn't distinguish between cultural characteristics of their household and others. Usually a person in this stage accepts the ideas they find on culture from their parents, the media, community, and others.

An example of thought in this stage: "I don't have a culture I'm just an American." "My parents tell me about where they lived, but what do I care? I've never lived there."

Cultural identity search: "is the process of exploration and questioning about one's culture in order to learn more about it and to understand the implications of membership in that culture." During this stage a person will begin to question why they hold their beliefs and compare it to the beliefs of other cultures. For some this stage may arise from a turning point in their life or from a growing awareness of other cultures. This stage is characterized by growing awareness in social and political forums and a desire to learn more about culture. This can be expressed by asking family members questions about heritage, visiting museums, reading of relevant cultural sources, enrolling in school courses, or attendance at cultural events. This stage might have an emotional component as well.

An example of thought in this stage: "I want to know what we do and how our culture is different from others." "There are a lot of non-Japanese people around me, and it gets pretty confusing to try and decide who I am."

Cultural identity achievement: "is characterized by a clear, confident acceptance of oneself and an internalization of one's cultural identity." In this stage people often allow the acceptance of their cultural identity play a role in their future choices such as how to raise children, how to deal with stereotypes and any discrimination, and approach negative perceptions. This usually leads to an increase in self-confidence and positive psychological adjustment

== The role of the internet ==
There is a set of phenomena that occur in conjunction between [[Cyberculture|virtual culture]] – understood as the modes and norms of behaviour associated with the [[internet]] and the [[online world]] – and [[youth culture]]. While we can speak of a duality between the virtual (online) and [[Reality|real]] sphere (face-to-face relations), for youth, this frontier is implicit and permeable. On occasions – to the annoyance of parents and teachers – these spheres are even superposed, meaning that young people may be in the real world without ceasing to be connected.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002475/247577E.pdf|title=Youth and changing realities: Rethinking secondary education in Latin America|last=López|first=Néstor|last2=Opertti|first2=Renato|last3=Vargas Tamez|first3=Carlos|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-31 00204-5|location=|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the present techno-cultural context, the relationship between the real world and the virtual world cannot be understood as a link between two independent and separate worlds, possibly coinciding at a point, but as a [[Moebius Strip|Moebius strip]] where there exists no inside and outside and where it is impossible to identify limits between both. For new generations, to an ever-greater extent, digital life merges with their home life as yet another element of nature. In this naturalizing of digital life, the learning processes from that environment are frequently mentioned not just since they are explicitly asked but because the subject of the internet comes up spontaneously among those polled. The ideas of [[active learning]], of [[googling]] 'when you don’t know', of recourse to tutorials for 'learning' a programme or a game, or the expression 'I learnt English better and in a more entertaining way by playing' are examples often cited as to why the internet is the place most frequented by the young people polled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Políticas TIC en los Sistemas Educativos de América Latina. Informe sobre tendencias sociales y educativas en América Latina|last=SITEAL, IIPE-UNESCO y OEI|first=|publisher=Buenos Aires, IIEP-UNESCO Regional Office in Buenos Aires.|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The internet is becoming an extension of the expressive dimension of the youth condition. There, youth talk about their lives and concerns, design the content that they make available to others and assess others reactions to it in the form of optimized and electronically mediated social approval. Many of today's youth go through processes of affirmation procedures and is often the case for how youth today grow dependency for peer approval. When connected, youth speak of their daily routines and lives. With each post, [[image]] or [[video]] they [[upload]], they have the possibility of asking themselves who they are and to try out profiles differing from those they assume in the ‘real’ world. The connections they feel in more recent times have become much less interactive through personal means compared to past generations. The influx of new technology and access has created new fields of research on effects on teens and young adults. They thus negotiate their identity and create senses of belonging, putting the acceptance and censure of others to the test, an essential mark of the process of [[Identity formation|identity construction]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Youth ask themselves about what they think of themselves, how they see themselves personally and, especially, how others see them. On the basis of these questions, youth make decisions which, through a long process of trial and error, shape their identity. This experimentation is also a form through which they can think about their insertion, membership and sociability in the ‘real’ world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Los adolescentes y las redes sociales|last=Morduchowicz|first=R.|last2=Marcon|first2=A.|last3=Sylvestre|first3=A.|last4=Ballestrini|first4=F.|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

From other perspectives, the question arises on what impact the internet has had on youth through accessing this sort of ‘identity laboratory’ and what role it plays in the shaping of youth identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life on the screen: Identity in the age of the Internet|last=Turkle|first=S.|publisher=New York, Simon &amp; Schuster|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The psychology of the Internet|last=Wallace|first=P.|publisher=Cambridge, Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the one hand, the internet enables young people to explore and perform various roles and personifications while on the other, the virtual forums – some of them highly attractive, vivid and absorbing (e.g. [[video game]]s or virtual games of personification) – could present a risk to the construction of a stable and viable personal identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zegers|first=B.|last2=Larraín|first2=M.E.|year=2011|title=El impacto de la Internet en la definición de la identidad juvenil: una revisión|url=http://www.psykhe.cl/index.php/psykhe/article/view/469/448|journal=Psykhe|volume= 11| issue =  1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

'''El Ceibo''' is a major Museum in the [[Ometepe]] island in what once were the tobacco farm “Tel Aviv” kilns, known by its former name “El Refugio”, in the community of Sacramento, 10 kilometers from Moyogalpa in Lake Cocibolca or [[Lake Nicaragua]] administratively [[Ometepe Island]] belongs to the [[Rivas Department]]. The name of the island derives from the [[Nahuatl]]: ōme 'two' and tepētl 'mountain (s),' since it is almost entirely composed of two [[Volcano|volcanic]] cones: [[Concepción (volcano)]] and [[Maderas Volcano Natural Reserve|Maderas volcano]].

Access to the Museum is free to island residents and has an entrance fee of $10 USD for foreign tourists to visit both museums and $6 USD for domestic visitors.

The museum requires multilateral support to increase the exhibition area as well as scientific research on many pieces, to enhance information about the articles and to support scientific studies of the important archaeological area.

Due to the absence of outside interest, its own privately generated revenue is insufficient for its continued maintenance and operation into the distant future.

==Museum history==
The museum has two specific sections in two separate buildings; one is the Nicaraguan Numismatics,&lt;ref name="El-Ceibo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ometepeislandinfo.com/ElCeibo|title=El Ceibo Museums,  Numismatic Section|last=|first=|date=|publisher=|language=Spanish|dead-url=|work=El-Ceibo|accessdate=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another about pre-Hispanic archaeology of the area.&lt;ref name="El-Ceibo2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ometepeislandinfo.com/ElCeibo|title=El Ceibo Museums,  Archaeology Section|last=|first=|date=|publisher=|language=Spanish|dead-url=|work=El-Ceibo|accessdate=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeology exhibition area has six exhibition halls over 200 square meters, a two-storey exhibition, the only one equipped with air conditioning to preserve the archaeological exhibits.

The Museum was founded in 2007 by Moises David Ghitis Rivera, a Nicaraguan philanthropist, on his agricultural and cattle farm on the island of Ometepe. It is the only private pre-Hispanic museum in the island of Ometepe, with a collection of more than 1500 archaeological pieces, which are on permanent display.

== Pre-Hispanic Archaeology Museum ==
On the first floor of the Museum is the Ceramic Hall, displaying urns, [[metate]]s (grindstones) and stone tools.

On the second floor of the Museum there is the women representation, the Pottery Hall, varieties and body ornaments room; the 1,500 pieces on display there have been found throughout the island by different farmers, and others were held privately as families heritage which was donated to the Museum.

===Petroglyphs===
[[File: Petroglyph (Ometepe).JPG|thumb|250px|Petroglyph, El Ceibo Museum, Ometepe, Nicaragua]]
The outer courtyard of the Museum displays 16 petroglyphs specimens, found in the area, 13 of which were found in the [[Maderas Volcano Natural Reserve|Maderas volcano]], two on the Museum grounds owned by Moses Ghitis and 1 is of unknown origin.

The island has many petroglyphs some dated as early as 300 BCE.

===Ancient native tomb ===
Upon entering the museum, in the First Hall, the most striking display is the recreation of a pre-Hispanic tomb; it was found and studied 15 years ago by Ghitis Rivera, 700 meters from the Museum now. During the recovery process, it was mapped identifying location of human remains and the artifacts contained.&lt;ref name="El-Ceibo1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ometepeislandinfo.com/ElCeibo.html|title=Museo El Ceibo Ometepe History|last=|first=|publisher=Stephen Oleszkowicz|language=English|dead-url=|work=Ometepe Island Information.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-Hispanic tomb was reconstructed within the Museum; it contains teeth, bones placed in a ceramic vase, a jade pendant, an animal teeth necklace, an eagle head tripod and a gold [[Shamanism|shaman]], hence it is inferred that the remains belong to a very important person of Ometepe ancestors.

The origin of the gold Ometepe article opens an interesting topic of research, regarding its origin, meaning, etc.

===Oldest pieces of the collection ===
[[File:Fish Ornament.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Flint Spearhead, 5,600 years old, El Ceibo Museum, Ometepe, Nicaragua]] Flint fish-shaped [[File:Ceramic 5.JPG|thumb|150px|Ceramic Tripod, 2,800 years old, El Ceibo Museum, Ometepe, Nicaragua]]

Piece 2500 years old &lt;ref&gt;Xulos o perros a la barbacoa. “...e quando alguna fiesta principal comen estos perros “xulos” por el más precioso manjar de todos, e ninguno come la cabeza...” (Crónicas de Oviedo)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient trade ===
[[File:Gold Ornament.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Gold Ornament, El Ceibo Museum, Ometepe, Nicaragua]]
The collection of this Museum offers important evidence of trade that existed in the region in prehispanic times since the presence of various items indicate relationships with other regions such as El Salvador and Honduras, pieces were found that originated in these countries and presumably gold pieces from Colombia. Other pieces found have distinctive Maya, Inca, and Aztec influences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9195">The '''General Education Board''' was a [[philanthropy]] which was used primarily to support [[higher education]] and [[medical school]]s in the [[United States]], and to help rural white and black schools in the [[Southern United States|South]], as well as modernize [[agriculture|farming practices]] in the South. It helped eradicate [[hookworm]] and created the county agent system in American agriculture, linking research as state [[agricultural experiment station]]s with actual practices in the field.

The Board was created by [[John D. Rockefeller]] and [[Frederick T. Gates]] in 1902. Rockefeller gave it $180 million. Its head Frederick Gates envisioned "The Country School of To-Morrow," wherein "young and old will be taught in practicable ways how to make rural life beautiful, intelligent, fruitful, recreative, healthful, and joyous."&lt;ref&gt;Frederick T. Gates. "The Country School Of To-Morrow," ''Occasional Papers,'' No. 1 (1913) [https://books.google.com/books?id=aaygAAAAMAAJ online]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1934 the Board was making grants of $5.5 million a year. It spent nearly all its money by 1950 and closed in 1964.

==History==
The board was founded in February 1902 and chartered by the [[United States Congress]] on 15 January 1903, its object being the promotion of education throughout the United States, without distinction as to race, sex or creed. Beside gifts from several philanthropists, the board received, when chartered, a special gift of $1,000,000 from John D. Rockefeller for carrying on work in the southern United States. Upon evidence that this work would be effectively carried out, on 30 June 1905 he made an additional gift of $10,000,000 and in 1907 a further sum of $32,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Education Board, General}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rockefeller eventually gave it $180 million, which was used primarily to support higher education and medical schools in the [[United States]] and to improve farming practices in the South.  It helped eradicate [[hookworm]] and created the county agent system in American agriculture, linking research at state agricultural experiment stations with actual practices in the field. By 1934 it was making grants of $5.5 million a year. It spent nearly all its money by 1950 and ceased operating as a separate entity in 1960, when its programs were subsumed into the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;Harr &amp; Johnson, ''The Rockefeller Century'', 1988. (p.195)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
It had four main programs:

:1. The promotion of practical farming in the southern states.  Through the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] the board had made accumulative annual appropriations amounting in by 1912-1913 to $673,750 for the purpose of promoting agriculture by the establishment of demonstration farms under the direction of Dr. Seaman A. Knapp. About 236 men were employed in supervising such farms. In 1906 the General Education Board contributed $7,000, and due to the increased success of the programs in reaching the distant southern farming communities, G.E.B. contributions grew each year. In addition to promoting demonstration farms, instructors for the education of farmers were also furnished. The work of the Board also influenced the practical teaching of agriculture in the schools of the southern United States.&lt;ref name=ea2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=General Education Board 1902-1914 |date=1914 |publisher=General Education Board |page=48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2. The establishment of public high schools in the southern states. Upon the General Education Board's foundation in 1902, it was stated that the immediate prerogative of the organization was to "devote itself to studying and aiding to promote the educational needs of the people of our southern states."&lt;ref&gt;“General Education Board purpose and program,” 100 Years: The Rockefeller Foundation, accessed February 24, 2017, {{cite web |url=http://rockefeller100.org/items/show/2241 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225131331/http://rockefeller100.org/items/show/2241 |archivedate=2017-02-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; For this purpose, the board appropriated for state universities or state departments of education in the South sums to pay for the salaries of high school representatives to travel throughout their states and stimulate public sentiment in favor of high schools.&lt;ref name=ea2&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=General Education Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of this work, 912 high schools had been established in 11 southern states by 1914.

:3. The promotion of institutions of higher learning.  By 1914 the board had made conditional appropriations to the amount of $8,817,500, gifts towards an approximate total of $41,020,500.  This money was expended throughout the United States.&lt;ref name=ea2/&gt;

:4. Schools for [[Negro]]es.  By 1914, the board had made contributions, amounting to $620,105, to schools for Negroes, mainly those for the training of teachers.  [[Anna T. Jeanes]] had contributed $1,000,000 for that purpose{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}.

The work of the General Education Board had a social side as well. “Corn” and educative clubs to study house management, poultry, preservation of fruit and other subjects directly related with agricultural life were encouraged in various ways, more especially in connection with the girl's clubs. Other clubs of a purely social nature were organized for the promotion of more social life in farming communities.&lt;ref name=ea2/&gt;

The investigations which preceded the gifts of the Board were perhaps of as great importance to the development of education in the United States as the gifts themselves. The Board consisted of 17 members and maintained headquarters in New York City. In 1920 the president was Wallace Buttrick, and the secretary, [[Abraham Flexner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Collier's|wstitle=General Education Board|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
"In our dreams, we have limitless resources and the people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hands. The present education conventions fade from their minds, and unhampered by tradition, we work our own good will upon a grateful and responsive rural folk. We shall not try to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or men of learning, or men of science. We have not to raise up from among them authors, editors, poets or men of letters. We shall not search for embryo great artists, painters, musicians nor lawyers, doctors, preachers, politicians, statesmen, of whom we have an ample supply…The task we set before ourselves is very simple as well as a very beautiful one, to train these people as we find them to a perfectly ideal life just where they are. So we will organize our children and teach them to do in a perfect way the things their fathers and mothers are doing in an imperfect way, in the homes, in the shops and on the farm." - [https://books.google.com/books?id=QzhDAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false General Education Board, Occasional Papers, No. 1] (General Education Board, New York, 1913) p.&amp;nbsp;6.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19609">'''Hack''' is a term used primarily in [[stand-up comedy]], but also [[sketch comedy]], [[improv comedy]], and [[comedy writing]] to refer to a joke or premise for a joke that is considered obvious, has been frequently used by [[comedian]]s in the past, and/or is blatantly copied from its original author.  Alternatively, it may refer to a [[comedian]] or performance group that uses hack material or similarly unoriginal devices in their act.  Since comedians and people who work with comedians are typically exposed to many more jokes than the general public, they may recognize a topic, joke or performer as hack before the general public does; as a result, even performers who do well on stage may be considered hacks by their peers.

The word "hack" is derived from the British term "hackneyed" meaning, "over used and thus cheapened, or trite".&lt;ref name="stasonhack"&gt;"http://stason.org/TULARC/art/hack-stand-up-comedy"&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally a performer will be one of the first to develop a joke about a specific topic, and later on others will follow suit to excess.  This renders the topic "hack" to new performers, but is not considered a detriment to the originator of the material.

Reusing humor can also be [[joke thievery]] if it is taken without permission from another specific comedian.

==History==
From the [[Borscht Belt|Catskill]] and [[Vaudeville]] beginnings of [[stand-up comedy]], hacking was common&lt;ref name="radartake_3"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.radaronline.com/from-the-magazine/2007/02/take_the_funny_and_run_3.php |title=From The Magazine : Radar Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2008-11-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122182110/http://radaronline.com/from-the-magazine/2007/02/take_the_funny_and_run_3.php |archive-date=2009-01-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as there were few chances that a performer from one area would meet one from another and a single twenty-minute set could sustain a comic for a decade.

In the late fifties and early sixties, [[Will Jordan]] perfected a caricature performance of [[Ed Sullivan]] (incorporating mispronouncing the word "show" as "shoe") that became the basis for all other impersonators that followed.&lt;ref name="radartake_3" /&gt;  Soon after, [[Jackie Mason]], [[Rich Little]] and others began adapting Jordan's caricature to their own acts. This resulted in many of Jordan's shows being canceled due to other performers doing his bit two weeks previous to his shows at the same venue.&lt;ref name="radartake_3" /&gt; [[John Byner]], in turn, developed his own, oft-imitated, version of Jordan's caricature that [[George Carlin]] cited as being set up with the words, "Now you know!"

In the sixties, comedy took a turn for the more personal. Comics like [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Richard Pryor]], and George Carlin were no longer regurgitating joke after joke, but instead were offering insight to their own lives from a comedic point of view. As a result, jokes and persona were largely unique to the performer. Hacking proved more difficult, but also more offensive to the writer.&lt;ref name="radartake_3" /&gt;

In the seventies joke theft became more prominent with the boom in popularity of comedy. The eighties and nineties saw the popularity of stand-up comedy continue to increase. With the advent of pay-cable networks, comics were afforded the opportunity to perform their routines unfettered. With this came a new type of joke theft wherein the first comic to tell a stolen joke on some sort of media became the one associated with the joke.

For many years, [[Denis Leary]] had been friends with fellow comedian [[Bill Hicks]]. However, when Hicks heard Leary's 1992 album ''No Cure For Cancer'', he felt Leary had stolen his act and material. The friendship ended abruptly as a result.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook"&gt;{{cite book | title=Bill Hicks: Agent of Evolution | author=Kevin Booth and Michael Bertin | year=2005 | publisher=Harper Collins | isbn=0-00-719829-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole not just some of Hicks' material but his persona and attitude.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=44170 | title=Carlos Mencia is a weak minded joke thief | author=Joe Rogan | publisher=JoeRogan.net | year=2005 | accessdate=2006-10-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060903194637/http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=44170 |archivedate = September 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last= Rogan |first=Joe |work= Playboy Magazine |date= October 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hicksfaq"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060320081614/http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html |title= Dark Times: Bill Hicks: Frequently Asked Questions |author= Tim McIntire |year=1998 |publisher= BillHicks.com |archivedate= 2006-03-20 |accessdate=2006-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, it is claimed that after Hicks' death from [[pancreatic cancer]], an industry joke began to circulate about Leary's transformation and subsequent success (roughly; "Question: Why is Denis Leary a star while Bill Hicks is unknown? Answer: Because there's no cure for cancer").&lt;ref name="hicksfaq" /&gt;

Also in the nineties, began a nearly universal hack of an impression of [[Bill Cosby]], the style of which was first unveiled by [[Eddie Murphy]] in his concert ''[[Eddie Murphy Raw|Raw]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/19/movies/eddie-murphy-raw.html | title='Eddie Murphy Raw'  | author=Janet Maslin | publisher=New York Times | year=1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent times have seen public rivalries between comics over the subject of hacking. [[Louis CK]] has maintained a relatively quiet rivalry with [[Dane Cook]] over three bits on Cook's album, ''Retaliation'' that allegedly bear some resemblance to three bits on CK's album ''Live in Houston''. This claim is further complicated by both artists having performed bits on naming kids that strongly resemble "My Real Name", a bit from [[Steve Martin]]'s album, ''A Wild and Crazy Guy''.&lt;ref name="dead frog"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson |first=Todd |url=http://www.dead-frog.com/blog/entry/steal_this_joke_louis_ck_vs_dane_cook_vs_steve_martin/ |title=Steal this Joke: Louis C.K. vs. Dane Cook vs. Steve Martin &amp;#124; Dead-Frog - A Comedy Blog |publisher=Dead-Frog |date=2007-01-29 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=August 2010}}

[[Joe Rogan]], by contrast has been very open in accusing [[Carlos Mencia]] of hacking.&lt;ref name="monstersandcritics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/news/article_1265383.php/Joe_Rogan_confronts_Carlos_Mencia_at_Comedy_Store |title=Joe Rogan confronts Carlos Mencia at Comedy Store - People |publisher=Monstersandcritics.com |date=2007-02-19 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Italian comic and satirist Daniele Luttazzi was accused of having plagiarised many jokes from comedians such as [[George Carlin]], [[Mitch Hedberg]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Chris Rock]], [[Bill Hicks]] and [[Robert Schimmel]].&lt;ref name="rep_lut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.repubblica.it/spettacoli-e-cultura/2010/06/09/news/luttazzi-secopia-4703064/ |title=La Rete contro Luttazzi: "Copia" I dubbi dei fan, il tam-tam cresce - Repubblica.it |accessdate=2010-06-09 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.unita.it/media/Politica/Luttazzi_copia_Parte_1_1395.html|title=Luttazzi copia - Parte 1|accessdate=2010-06-11|work=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612084318/http://video.unita.it/media/Politica/Luttazzi_copia_Parte_1_1395.html|archive-date=2010-06-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But five years before those charges, Luttazzi himself told about his scheme on his personal blog: he wrote that he adds references to famous comedians' jokes to his work as a defense against the million-euro lawsuits he has to face because of his satire. (In March 2012, Luttazzi won a legal battle against [[La7]] broadcasting company, which in 2007 abruptly closed his late show "Decameron", accusing him, among other charges, of plagiarism from Bill Hicks. Sentence: It was original satire, not plagiarism. La7 shall pay Luttazzi 1 million 2 hundred thousand euros.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.corriere.it/spettacoli/12_marzo_10/satira-tv-luttazzi-vince-causa-contro-la-7-franco_69183226-6a83-11e1-8b63-010bde402ef9.shtml |title= Luttazzi vince la causa contro La7 |date= 10 March 2012 |accessdate= 10 March 2012 |publisher= corriere.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luttazzi calls his ruse "the Lenny Bruce trick" after a similar trick played by his hero, Lenny Bruce. Luttazzi asked his readers to find out the original jokes. He awards a prize to anyone who finds a "nugget", i.e. a reference to famous jokes: he calls the game "treasure hunt".&lt;ref name="blo_lut"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/node/144|title=Caccia al tesoro|accessdate=2005-10-24 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luttazzi also calls the charges "naive", explaining why those jokes are not "plagiarized", but "calqued", which is a fair use of original material. He uses a joke by Emo Philips to prove that the meaning of a joke depends on its context.&lt;ref name="blo_lut2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/node/811|title=Tecnica della diffamazione moderna|accessdate=2010-10-15 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luttazzi's blog lists all the comedians and writers quoted in his works.&lt;ref name="blo_lut3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/node/324|title=Caccia al tesoro|accessdate=2007-12-11 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, one of the contestants on the talent quest television program ''[[Australia's Got Talent]]'' was Jordan Paris, whose act was stand-up comedy. His act went well, the judges were impressed, and he made it through to the semi-finals.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, G 2011, '[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/comedy/australias-got-plagiarism-ripoff-comic-exposed-20110526-1f50v.html Australia's Got Plagiarism: rip-off comic exposed]', ''Brisbane Times'' 26 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later revealed that he had plagiarised his jokes from comedians [[Lee Mack]] and [[Geoff Keith]]. The television network eventually decided to give him a chance to redeem himself and he was allowed to compete in the semi-final, provided he use his own material. Paris' effort this time was self-deprecating, joking about his plagiarism and his large teeth. The first joke went well, but the rest went downhill. It was later found out that the joke that went well - "I just sacked my two writers - Copy and Paste" - had been done in 2009 by comedian [[Jeffrey Ross]], about [[Brad Garrett]], at a roast of [[Joan Rivers]]. Ross had said, "This guy has two writers, their names are Cut and Paste."&lt;ref&gt;Nancarrow, D 2011, [http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/oops-he-did-it-again-ripoff-comic-plunders-joke-about-plagiarism-20110629-1gq1d.html 'Oops. He did it again: Rip-off comic plunders joke about plagiarism'], ''Brisbane Times'', 29 June 2010,&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Blogger and comedian [[Troy Holm]] was ridiculed on the [[social networking]] site [[Facebook]]&lt;ref name="facebook1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/pages/Occupy-Troy-Holm/217011661714006 |title=Occupy Troy Holm |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; for stealing jokes and stories from comedian [[Doug Stanhope]] and posting them to his Blog from 2010, [[plagiarism|claiming them as his own work]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/working-hardprisondrug-war.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-18 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120701002315/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/working-hardprisondrug-war.html |archive-date=2012-07-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including Stanhope's "Fuck someone uglier than you" routine,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/fuck-someone-ugly.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103154727/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/fuck-someone-ugly.html |archive-date=2012-01-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was found on Stanhope's Acid Bootleg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Doug+Stanhope/ACID+Bootleg |title=ACID Bootleg – Doug Stanhope – Listen and discover music at |publisher=Last.fm |date=2012-06-26 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Troy Holm also plagiarized Stanhope's story of an encounter with a transsexual prostitute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Doug Stanhope |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicko_%28album%29 |title=Sicko (album) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=June 2018}} nearly verbatim, substituting himself as Stanhope, and changing a few small details,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/06/hooker-story-and-dmt-story.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-18 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120701001921/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/06/hooker-story-and-dmt-story.html |archive-date=2012-07-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; causing a backlash from Stanhope's fans. This catapulted Troy Holm into an internet icon which started the "Occupy Troy Holm" Movement.&lt;ref name="facebook1"/&gt;  Stanhope commented on the Occupy Troy Holm Facebook page that "To the few people who seem to think this is overboard...and it is...I don't think that you know the levels to which this guy has been ripping me off. He didn't take a tit-fuck joke and use it as a status update. He's been living my entire life as though it was his, changing some names and then promoting with twitters... Look at his site and most the entirety of it is me, including the comments where he uses my stuff to pass as his own conversation. And on Twitter. So who is he ripping off for that stuff that ''isn't'' mine?"&lt;ref name="facebook1"/&gt;

==Hacking in the media==
Hacking is not limited to stand-up comedy. Often entire premises in film and television shows are taken from comics or even other media.

[[Dick Cavett]] and [[Woody Allen]] often cited to each other the many instances of their jokes appearing in television shows without their permission, sometimes even falsely attributed to each other.

Allen's jokes and topics were regularly stolen by the highly successful [[television]] show, ''[[Laugh In]]''.&lt;ref name="Cavett interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheckymagazine.com/cavett.htm |title=SHECKY! Interview: DICK CAVETT! |publisher=Sheckymagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proved extremely painful to Allen.

Several episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', including "[[Missionary: Impossible]]", "[[Treehouse of Horror XIII]]", and "[[The Italian Bob]]" have poked fun at ''Family Guy'', implying that MacFarlane's show is guilty of stealing jokes and premises from ''The Simpsons''. However, the producers of both shows have said that there is no serious feud between the two of them and their shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/content/node/47771 | title = Interview: Matt Groening | accessdate = 2006-12-12 | author = Nathan Rabin | date = 2006-04-26 | work = The A.V. Club | publisher = Onion Inc. | quote = The rivalry is very affectionate...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://familyguy.tktv.net/news.html |title=Timeline at familyguy.tktv.net|quote=You know, it's funny. Matt Groening and I actually have a great relationship...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recourse and consequences==
There is, historically, very little [[legal recourse]] taken in cases of hacking. Some comics, however, have chosen to exact their own justice. [[W. C. Fields]] reportedly paid fifty dollars to have a hack comic's legs broken.&lt;ref name="radartake_3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="radartake_3" /&gt;

Typically, the repercussions of hacking are limited to personal animosity. On this issue, it sometimes appears that the offended comics are alone in their concern. For example, on February 10, 2007 at the [[Comedy Store]] in Los Angeles, Joe Rogan argued on-stage with Carlos Mencia, accusing him of hacking other comedians' work. According to Rogan's account, he had just finished his act and introduced the next performer, [[Ari Shaffir]], as a comedian who opens for "Carlos Men-steal-ia".&lt;ref name="rogan-video"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=53945 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-11-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407105943/http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=53945 |archive-date=2007-04-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mencia took offense and walked on the stage. The Comedy Store later cancelled Rogan's shows and suggested he "take a break" from the Comedy Store, which was then followed by Rogan's manager (who also manages Mencia) dropping Rogan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070215/ENTERTAIN/70215009 |title=Joe Rogan and Carlos Mencia face off at comedy club |accessdate=2007-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire incident was filmed as part of Rogan's internet reality show, ''JoeShow''. It was then made available to watch or download at numerous websites, including Rogan's.&lt;ref name="rogan-video"/&gt;

Joe Rogan said, "People take plagiarism so seriously in all other forms of media, whether it's music, newspapers, books, but with comedy, it's like, 'You're on your own, fucker.'"&lt;ref name="radartake_3" /&gt;

The [[internet]], however, has opened up a new medium for "outing" a hack. Websites like [[YouTube]] allow users to upload videos and share them with others. This has made it much easier to show evidence of joke thievery in a public forum.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In January 2012, Troy Holm, an amateur Comic, stole several jokes from [[Doug Stanhope]] and posted them to his [[blog]] under the guise of having written them, himself. Stanhope discovered the blog and tipped-off his fans who then deluged Holms blog with negative and berating comments. The blog has since been taken down.&lt;ref name="Laughspin Stanhope"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laughspin.com/2012/01/04/comedian-blatantly-steals-doug-stanhopes-material-fans-revolt |title=Comedian blatantly steals Doug Stanhope’s material, fans revolt |publisher=Laughspin.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roadrunner Records Stanhope"&gt;{{cite web|last=Records |first=Roadrunner |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/news/Doug-Stanhope-Punishes-A-Plagiarist-23921.aspx |title=Doug Stanhope Punishes A Plagiarist |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=2012-02-08 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Rosenthal]] and [[Steve Silberberg]] have published a ''Guide to Hack'' to help new comics avoid hacking,&lt;ref name="stason hack"&gt;{{cite web|author=Stas Bekman: stas (at) stason.org |url=http://stason.org/TULARC/art/hack-stand-up-comedy/ |title=The Complete Guide To Hack Stand-Up Comedy |publisher=Stason.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which references (and gives credit to) an earlier work on the same subject by [[Andy Kindler]] called, ''The Hacks Handbook: A Starter Kit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nathansmart.com/akhh.pdf |title=Handbook |website=www.nathansmart.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kindler national lampoon"&gt;NATIONAL LAMPOON February 1991 pp. 34-36&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hoxne Hoard''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɒ|k|s|ən}} {{respell|HOK|sən}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ref=BM-Juliana Bracelet |title=The Juliana Bracelet from the Hoxne hoard |date= |accessdate=19 June 2010 |publisher=British Museum |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/t/hoxne_hoard_juliana_bracelet.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907052033/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/t/hoxne_hoard_juliana_bracelet.aspx |archivedate=7 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the largest [[hoard]] of late [[Roman Britain|Roman]] silver and gold discovered in Britain,&lt;ref name="hist" /&gt; and the largest collection of gold and silver coins of the fourth and fifth centuries found anywhere within the [[Roman Empire]]. It was found by Eric Lawes, a [[metal detector]]ist in the village of [[Hoxne]] in [[Suffolk]], England on {{nowrap|16 November}} 1992. The hoard consists of 14,865 [[Roman currency|Roman gold, silver, and bronze coins]] and approximately 200 items of silver tableware and gold jewellery.&lt;ref name=jb169 /&gt; The objects are now in the [[British Museum]] in London, where the most important pieces and a selection of the rest are on permanent display. In 1993, the [[Treasure Valuation Committee]] valued the hoard at [[Pound sterling|£]]1.75 million (roughly equivalent to £{{formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|1750000|1993|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}).&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;

The hoard was buried in an oak box or small chest filled with items in precious metal, sorted mostly by type, with some in smaller wooden boxes and others in bags or wrapped in fabric. Remnants of the chest and fittings, such as hinges and locks, were recovered in the excavation. The coins of the hoard date it after AD 407, which coincides with the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|end]] of [[Roman Britain|Britain as a Roman province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Birley|2005| p=458}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owners and reasons for burial of the hoard are unknown, but it was carefully packed and the contents appear consistent with what a single very wealthy family might have owned. It is likely that the hoard represents only a part of the wealth of its owner, given the lack of large silver serving vessels and of some of the most common types of jewellery.

The Hoxne Hoard contains several rare and important objects, such as a gold body-chain and silver-gilt pepper-pots (''piperatoria''), including the [[Empress pepper pot]]. The hoard is also of particular archaeological significance because it was excavated by professional archaeologists with the items largely undisturbed and intact. The find helped to improve the relationship between metal detectorists and archaeologists, and influenced a change in English law regarding finds of treasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|Bland|1994|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hoard was discovered in a farm field about {{convert|2.4|km|mi}} southwest of the village of [[Hoxne]] in [[Suffolk]] on {{nowrap|16 November}} 1992. [[Tenant farmer]] Peter Whatling had lost a hammer and asked his friend Eric Lawes, a retired gardener and amateur metal detectorist, to help look for it.&lt;ref name="ca136"&gt;{{harvnb|Bland|Johns|1993b| pp=152–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; While searching the field with his metal detector, Lawes discovered silver spoons, gold jewelry, and numerous gold and silver coins. After retrieving a few items, he and Whatling notified the landowners ([[Suffolk County Council]]) and the police without attempting to dig out any more objects.&lt;ref name="johns2"&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, a team of archaeologists from the Suffolk Archaeological Unit carried out an emergency excavation of the site. The entire hoard was excavated in a single day, with the removal of several large blocks of unbroken material for laboratory excavation.&lt;ref name="cj1996"&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|1996| p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area was searched with metal detectors within a radius of {{convert|30|m|ft}} from the find spot.&lt;ref name="database"&gt;{{cite web| ref=Stage-1-Database | title=Roman Grey Literature Stage 1 Database | publisher=Archaeology Data Service | url=http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-811-1/dissemination/csv/phase_1/RomanGreyLiteratureStage1Database.csv | accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Whatling's missing hammer was also recovered and donated to the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum collection database, "hammer", {{British-Museum-db|Registration:1994,0408.410|id=1357947}}, accessed 21 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kenned"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kennedy |first=Maev |title=Golden hoard and silver too at British Museum |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/nov/15/arts.education |accessdate=26 June 2010 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=15 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hoard was concentrated in a single location, within the completely decayed remains of a wooden chest.&lt;ref name="ca136" /&gt; The objects had been grouped within the chest; for example, pieces such as ladles and bowls were stacked inside one another, and other items were grouped in a way consistent with being held within an inner box.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some items had been disturbed by burrowing animals and ploughing, but the overall amount of disturbance was low.&lt;ref name="johns14"&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was possible to determine the original layout of the artefacts within the container, and the existence of the container itself, due to Lawes' prompt notification of the find, which allowed it to be excavated ''in situ'' by professional archaeologists.&lt;ref name="johns2"/&gt;

The excavated hoard was taken to the British Museum. The discovery was leaked to the press, and the ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|Sun]]'' newspaper ran a front-page story on 19 November, alongside a picture of Lawes with his metal detector. The full contents of the hoard and its value were still unknown, yet the newspaper article claimed that it was worth £10 million.&lt;ref name="ca136" /&gt; In response to the unexpected publicity, the British Museum held a press conference at the museum on 20 November to announce the discovery. Newspapers lost interest in the hoard quickly, allowing British Museum curators to sort, clean, and stabilise it without further disruption from the press.&lt;ref name="ca136" /&gt; The initial cleaning and basic conservation was completed within a month of its discovery.&lt;ref name="cj1996" /&gt;

===Inquest and valuation===
[[File:Hoxne Hoard 24.jpg|thumb|alt=Silver tigress with engraved flame-like stripes, springing from its hind legs, with six prominent teats on its belly, in two rows of three, and a tail as long as its spine. The fore- and hind-paws are together, and lie on a line with the tip of the tail.|The silver "Hoxne Tigress" has become the best known single piece out of more than 15,000 objects in the hoard, despite being a broken-off handle from an unknown object.&lt;ref name="johns61"&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A [[Inquests in England and Wales|Coroner's inquest]] was held at [[Lowestoft]] on 3 September 1993, and the hoard was declared a [[treasure trove]], meaning that it was deemed to have been hidden with the intention of being recovered at a later date. Under English [[common law]], anything declared as such belongs to [[the Crown]] if no one claims [[Title (property)|title]] to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goo|2002|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the customary practice at the time was to reward anyone who found and promptly reported a treasure trove with money equivalent to its market value, the money being provided by the national institution that wished to acquire the treasure. In November 1993, the [[Treasure Valuation Committee|Treasure Trove Reviewing Committee]] valued the hoard at £1.75 million (roughly equivalent to £{{formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|1750000|1993|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}), which was paid to Lawes as finder of the treasure, and he shared it with farmer Peter Whatling.&lt;ref name="bj1993" /&gt; Three years later, the [[Treasure Act 1996]] was enacted by Parliament which allowed the finder, tenant, and landowner to share in any reward.&lt;ref name="Gilcrist"/&gt;

===Subsequent archaeological investigations===
The Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service [[Archaeological field survey|surveyed]] the field in September 1993, after it was ploughed, finding four gold coins and 81 silver coins, all considered part of the same hoard.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Frend|Frend]], p. 389&lt;/ref&gt; Both earlier [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] and later [[Mediaeval Britain|mediaeval]] materials were also discovered, but there was no evidence of a Roman settlement in the vicinity.&lt;ref name="database" /&gt;

A follow-up excavation of the field was carried out by the Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service in 1994, in response to illegal metal detecting near the hoard find. The hoard burial hole was re-excavated, and a single post hole was identified at the southwest corner; this may have been the location of a marker post to enable the depositors of the cache to locate and recover it in the future.&lt;ref name="database" /&gt; Soil was removed in {{convert|10|cm|abbr=on}} spits for analysis in the area {{convert|1000|m2|sqft}} around the find spot, and metal detectors were used to locate metal artefacts. This excavation recovered 335 items dating to the Roman period, mostly coins but also some box fittings. A series of late [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]] or early Iron Age post holes were found which may have formed a structure. However, no structural features of the Roman period were detected.&lt;ref name="database" /&gt;&lt;ref name="archsearch"&gt;{{cite web| title=Home Farm, Hoxne | publisher=Archaeology Data Service | url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/search/fr.cfm?rcn=EHNMR-1064719&amp;CFID=4318696&amp;CFTOKEN=13686167 | accessdate=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coins discovered during the 1994 investigation were spread out in an ellipse centred on the hoard find spot, running east–west up to a distance of {{convert|20|m}} on either side.&lt;ref name="johns16"&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distribution can be explained by the fact that the farmer carried out deep ploughing in 1990 in an east–west direction on the part of the field where the hoard was found. The farmer had ploughed in a north–south direction since 1967 or 1968, when the land was cleared for agricultural use, but the absence of coins north and south of the find spot suggests that the ploughing before 1990 had not disturbed the hoard.&lt;ref name="johns16" /&gt;

==Items discovered==
The hoard is mainly made up of gold and silver coins and jewellery, amounting to a total of {{convert|3.5|kg|lb}} of gold and {{convert|23.75|kg|lb}} of silver.&lt;ref name=johnsNovDec1993/&gt; It had been placed in a wooden chest, made mostly or entirely of [[oak]], that measured approximately 60×45×30&amp;nbsp;cm (23.6×17.7×11.8&amp;nbsp;in). Within the chest, some objects had evidently been placed in smaller boxes made of yew and cherry wood, while others had been packed in with woollen cloth or hay. The chest and the inner boxes had decayed almost completely after being buried, but fragments of the chest and its fittings were recovered during the excavation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|pp=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main objects found are:
* 569 gold coins (''[[Solidus (coin)|solidi]]'')&lt;ref name=jb169&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|Bland|1994|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 14,272 silver coins, comprising 60 ''[[miliarense]]s'' and 14,212 ''[[siliqua]]e''&lt;ref name=jb169/&gt;
* 24 bronze coins (''[[nummus|nummi]]'')&lt;ref name=jb169/&gt;
* 29 items of jewellery in gold&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|Bland|1994|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 98 silver spoons and ladles&lt;ref name=jb171&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|Bland|1994|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A silver tigress, made as a handle for a vessel&lt;ref name=jb171/&gt;
* 4 silver bowls and a small dish&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1 silver beaker
* 1 silver vase or juglet
* 4 pepper pots, including the [[Empress pepper pot|"Empress" Pepper Pot]]&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{cite web |ref=BBC-History |title=BBC – A History of the world – Object: Hoxne pepper pot |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/PJvWylU-Tlm_mo0HRFjbHw |accessdate=17 June 2010 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Toiletry items such as [[toothpick]]s

The Hoxne Hoard contains 569 gold ''solidi'', struck between the reigns of [[Valentinian I]] (364–75) and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] (393–423); 14,272 silver coins, including 60 ''miliarenses'' and 14,212 ''siliquae'', struck between the reigns of [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]] (337–40) and Honorius; and 24 bronze ''nummi''.&lt;ref name=jb169 /&gt; It is the most significant coin find from the end of Roman Britain and contains all major denominations of coinage from that time, as well as many examples of [[coin clipping|clipped]] silver coinage typical of late Roman Britain. The only find from Roman Britain with a larger number of gold coins was the Eye Hoard found in 1780 or 1781, for which there are poor records.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|Bland|1994|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest single Romano-British hoard was the [[Cunetio Hoard]] of 54,951 third-century coins, but these were [[Debasement|debased]] [[Radiate (coin)|radiate]]s with little precious-metal content. The [[Frome Hoard]] was unearthed in [[Somerset]] in April 2010 containing 52,503 coins minted between 253 and 305, also mostly debased silver or bronze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finds.org.uk/blogs/fromehoard/ |title=The Frome Hoard |publisher=[[Portable Antiquities Scheme]] |accessdate=10 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024051925/http://finds.org.uk/blogs/fromehoard/ |archivedate=24 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger hoards of Roman coins have been found at [[Misrata]], Libya&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnr.it/istituti/Banchedati.html?cds=098 |title=Banche dati |publisher=CNR-&gt;Istituto ITABC |date= |accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reputedly also at [[Evreux]], France (100,000 coins) and [[Komin, Dubrovnik-Neretva County|Komin]], Croatia (300,000 coins).&lt;ref name=Abdy&gt;{{harvnb|Abdy|2002| pp=32–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gold ''solidi'' are all close to their theoretical weight of 4.48&amp;nbsp;g ({{frac|1|72}} of a Roman pound). The fineness of a ''solidus'' in this period was 99% gold. The total weight of the ''solidi'' in the hoard is almost exactly 8 Roman pounds, suggesting that the coins had been measured out by weight rather than number.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guest|2005| p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of the ''siliquae'' suggests a range of fineness of between 95% and 99% silver, with the highest percentage of silver found just after a reform of the coinage in 368.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guest|2005| p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the ''siliquae'', 428 are locally produced imitations, generally of high quality and with as much silver as the official ''siliquae'' of the period. However, a handful are [[cliché forgery|cliché forgeries]] where a core of [[base metal]] has been wrapped in silver [[foil (metal)|foil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guest|2005| pp=102, 108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coins are the only items in the Hoxne Hoard for which a definite date and place of manufacture can be established. All of the gold coins, and many of the silver coins, bear the names and portraits of the emperor in whose reign they were minted. Most also retain the original [[mint mark]]s that identify where they were minted, illustrating the Roman system of regional mints producing coins to a uniform design. The coins' manufacture has been traced back to a total of 14 sources: Trier, Arles and Lyon (in [[Gaul]]), Ravenna, Milan, [[Aquileia]], Rome (in modern Italy); [[Sisak|Siscia]] (modern Croatia), [[Sirmium]] (modern Serbia), Thessaloniki (Greece), [[Constantinople]], [[Cyzicus]], [[Nicomedia]], and [[Antioch]] (modern Turkey).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guest|2005| pp=39, 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coins were minted under three dynasties of Roman emperors. The earliest are the successors of the [[Constantinian dynasty]], followed by the [[Valentinian dynasty|Valentinianic emperors]], and finally the [[Theodosian dynasty|Theodosian emperors]]. The collegiate system of rule (or ''[[Consortium imperii]]'') meant that imperial partners would mint coins in each other's names at the mints under their jurisdiction. The overlapping reigns of [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern]] and [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] emperors often allow changes of type to be dated to within part of a reign. So the latest coins in the hoard, of Western ruler Honorius (393–423) and his challenger [[Constantine III (western emperor)|Constantine III]] (407–11), can be demonstrated to belong to the earlier parts of their reigns as they correspond to the lifetime of the Eastern Emperor [[Arcadius]], who died in 408.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kent|Carson|1994| pp=144–145 &amp; 347–348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the coins provide a ''[[terminus post quem]]'' or earliest possible date for the deposition of the hoard of 408.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum collection database, "coin", {{British-Museum-db|Registration:1994,0401,0753.1|id=3022067}}, accessed 21 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''siliquae'' in the Hoard were struck mainly at Western mints in Gaul and Italy. It is unknown whether this is because coins from further East rarely reached Britain through trade, or because the Eastern mints rarely struck ''siliquae''.&lt;ref name="Guest-p93"&gt;{{harvnb|Guest|2005| pp=93–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of coins seems to follow the location of the Imperial court at the time; for instance, the concentration of Trier coins is much greater after 367, perhaps associated with [[Gratian]] moving his court to Trier.&lt;ref name="Guest-p93" /&gt;

====Clipping of the silver coins====
Almost every silver ''siliqua'' in the hoard had its edge [[Coin clipping|clipped]] to some degree. This is typical of Roman silver coin finds of this period in Britain, although clipped coins are very unusual through the rest of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name="Guest-p110"&gt;{{harvnb|Guest|2005| p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clipping process invariably leaves the imperial portrait intact on the front of the coin but often damages the mint mark, inscription, and image on the reverse.&lt;ref name="Guest-p110" /&gt;

The possible reasons for clipping coins are controversial. Possible explanations include fraud, a deliberate attempt to maintain a stable ratio between gold and silver coins, or an official attempt to provide a new source of silver bullion while maintaining the same number of coins in circulation.&lt;ref name="Guest-p110" /&gt;

The huge number of clipped coins in the Hoxne Hoard has made it possible for archaeologists to observe the process of coin-clipping in detail. The coins were evidently cut face-up to avoid damaging the portrait. The average level of clipping is roughly the same for coins dating from 350 onwards.&lt;ref name="Guest-p112"&gt;{{harvnb|Guest|2005| p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gold jewellery===
[[File:Hoxne Hoard body chain.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Frontal view of a grey female bust with four gold bands of many fine links, two draped over the shoulders and two plunging from the breast bone sweeping below the breasts and going behind the back. The four converge between the breasts, where each band ends in a head which connects to a centrepiece, a purple gem surrounded by eight smaller sockets, four empty and four with red stones|Front view of the gold body chain from the Hoxne Hoard. Visible are an [[amethyst]] and four [[garnet]]s; four other gems are missing, thought to have been [[pearl]]s.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum collection database, "body chain / mount / coin", {{British-Museum-db|Registration:1994,0408.1|id=1362670}}, accessed 21 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bland|Johns|1993b| p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
All the jewellery in the hoard is gold, and all gold items in the hoard are jewellery, other than the coins. None of the jewellery is unequivocally masculine, although several pieces might have been worn by either gender, such as the rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are one body chain, six necklaces, three rings, and nineteen bracelets. The total weight of the gold jewellery is about {{convert|1|kg|lb}},&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the average metal content of the jewellery pieces is 91.5% gold (about 22 [[carat (purity)|carat]]), with small proportions of silver and [[copper]] in the metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important gold item in the hoard is the body chain, which consists of four finely looped gold chains, made using the "loop-in-loop" method called "fox tail" in modern jewellery, and attached at front and back to plaques.&lt;ref name="Johns2010-p25-30"&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|pp=25–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the front, the chains have terminals in the shape of lions' heads and the plaque has jewels mounted in gold cells, with a large [[amethyst]] surrounded by four smaller [[garnet]]s alternating with four empty cells which probably held [[pearl]]s that have decayed. At the back, the chains meet at a mount centred on a gold ''[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]'' of [[Gratian]] ([[r.]] 375–383) which has been converted from an earlier use, probably as a pendant, and which may have been a family [[heirloom]].&lt;ref name="Johns2010-p25-30" /&gt; Body chains of this type appear in Roman art, sometimes on the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] or on [[nymph]]s; some examples have erotic contexts, but they are also worn by respectable high-ranking ladies. They may have been regarded as a suitable gift for a bride.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hoxne body chain, worn tightly, would fit a woman with a bust-size of {{convert|76|–|81|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few body chains have survived; one of the most complete is from the early [[Byzantine]] era, found in Egypt, and it also is in the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum collection database, "breast-chain", {{British-Museum-db|Registration:1916,0704.1|id=61702}}, accessed 21 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the necklaces features lion-headed terminals, and another includes stylised dolphins. The other four are relatively plain loop-in-loop chains, although one has a [[Chi-Rho]] symbol (&lt;big&gt;☧&lt;/big&gt;) on the clasp, the only Christian element in the jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Necklaces of similar lengths would normally be worn in the Roman period with a [[pendant]], but no pendants were found in the hoard.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|pp=30–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three rings were originally set with gems, which might have been natural gemstones or pieces of coloured glass; however, these were taken from the rings before they were buried, perhaps for re-use. The rings are of similar design, one with an oval [[bezel setting|bezel]], one with a circular bezel, and one with a large oblong bezel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There were 19 bracelets buried in the hoard, including three matching sets of four made of gold. Many similar bracelets have survived, but sets of four are most unusual; they may have been worn two on each arm, or possibly were shared by two related women.&lt;ref name="Johns2010-p42-53"&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|pp=42–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; One set has been decorated by corrugating the gold with lateral and transverse grooves; the other two sets bear pierced-work geometric designs. Another five bracelets bear hunting scenes, common in Late Roman decorative art. Three have the designs executed in pierced-work, whereas two others are in [[Repoussé and chasing|repoussé]]. One bracelet is the sole gold item in the hoard to carry an inscription; it reads: "{{lang|la|VTERE FELIX DOMINA IVLIANE}}" in [[Latin]], meaning "Use {{Bracket|this}} happily, Lady Juliane".&lt;ref name="Johns2010-p42-53" /&gt; The expression ''utere felix'' (or sometimes ''uti felix'') is the second most common inscriptional formula on items from Roman Britain and is used to wish good luck, well-being, and joy.&lt;ref name="Raybould-p140"&gt;{{harvnb|Raybould|1999| p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formula is not specifically Christian, but it sometimes occurs in an explicitly Christian context, for example, together with a Chi-Rho symbol.&lt;ref name="Raybould-p140" /&gt;

The jewellery may have represented the "reserve" items rarely or never used from the collection of a wealthy woman or family. Some of the most common types of jewellery are absent, such as brooches, pendants, and ear-rings. Items set with gems are notably missing, although they were very much in the taste of the day. [[Catherine Johns]], former Senior Curator for Roman Britain at the British Museum, speculates that the current or favourite jewellery of the owner was not included in the hoard.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|pp=57–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silver items===
[[File:Silver gilt spoon cat fish creature.JPG|thumb|alt=a short-handled spoon with fine detail marked in the bowl of the spoon of a cat-headed two-legged fish-tailed creature surrounded by fleur de lys|Silver-gilt [[cignus]] spoon decorated with a mythical marine creature]]
{{anchor|Hoxne pepper pot}}
The hoard contains about 100 silver and [[silver-gilt]] items; the number is imprecise because there are unmatched broken parts. They include a statuette of a leaping tigress, made as a handle for an object such as a jug or lamp; four pepper-pots (''piperatoria''); a beaker; a vase or juglet (a small jug); four bowls; a small dish; and 98 silver spoons and ladles. The beaker and juglet are decorated with similar leaf and stem patterns, and the juglet has three gilded bands. In contrast, the small bowls and dish are plain, and it is presumed that the owners of the Hoard had many more such items, probably including the large decorated dishes found in other hoards.&lt;ref name="johns61"/&gt; Many pieces are [[gilding|gilded]] in parts to accentuate the decoration. The technique of [[fire-gilding]] with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] was used,&lt;ref name="Cowell and Hook"/&gt; as was typical at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|pp=185–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Piperatoria====
[[File:Hoxne piperatoria 1.jpg|thumb|alt=3 silvery objects, two of recumbent animals (One with prominent horns) and a bust|right|''Piperatoria'' – display of a selection of spice dispensers from the hoard, the pepper-pot on the right depicts an elegant and learned lady]]
The pepper-pots include one vessel, finely modelled after a wealthy or imperial lady, which soon became known as the [[Empress Pepper Pot|"Empress" pepper-pot]].{{refn|At the time of excavation iconographically similar images of an imperial lady were known on the [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] bronze weights used on the portable balances known as [[steelyard balance|steelyards]]. Initially, these mistakenly were thought to be of an empress. In recent years, the term "empress" has been discarded as incorrect as a term to describe the figures on steelyard weights. Although the pepper pot now would be more correctly described as a "lady", the term "empress" continues in common use, even though the image is no longer thought to have been intended to depict an empress.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McClanan|2002| p=60|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} The woman's hair, jewellery, and clothing are carefully represented, and gilding is used to emphasise many details. She is holding a scroll in her left hand, giving the impression of education as well as wealth. Other pepper-pots in the hoard are modelled into a statue of [[Hercules]] and [[Antaeus]], an [[ibex]], and a hare and hound together. Not all such spice dispensers held pepper — they were used to dispense other spices as well — but are grouped in discussions as pepper-pots. Each of those found in this hoard has a mechanism in the base to rotate an internal disc, which controls the aperture of two holes in the base. When fully open, the containers could have been filled using a funnel; when part-open they could have been shaken over food or drink to add the spices.

''Piperatorium'' is generally translated as ''pepper-pot'', and [[black pepper]] is considered the most likely condiment these were used for. Pepper is only one of a number of expensive, high-status spices which these vessels might have dispensed, however. The ''piperatoria'' are rare examples of this type of Roman silverware, and according to Johns the Hoxne finds have "significantly expanded the date range, the typology and the iconographic scope of the type".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trade and use of pepper in this period has been supported with evidence of mineralized black pepper at three Northern Province sites recovered in the 1990s,{{refn|Catherine Johns lists three comparative statue-shaped pepper pots, one from [[Chaourse]] in Gaul, one from [[Nicolaevo]] and another possibly from Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|pp=76–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}&lt;ref name=cool/&gt; and from the [[Vindolanda tablets]] which record the purchase of an unspecified quantity of pepper for two [[denarii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowman|Thomas|1994|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological sites with contemporary finds have revealed spices, including [[coriander]], [[poppy seed|poppy]], [[celery]], [[dill]], [[summer savory]], [[mustard seed|mustard]], and [[fennel]].&lt;ref name=cool&gt;{{harvnb|Cool|2006| pp=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Evidence of the trade in other flavourings comes from recipes and legal texts published in Roman times, the [[Edict on Maximum Prices]] of 301 includes [[saffron]], [[ginger]], [[cardamom]], and pepper. The [[Edict on Maximum Prices|Prices Edict]] (ch 34.67) sets a ''maximum'' price for (long) pepper at 800 denarii per pound (gold has a maximum value of 72,000 denarii/lb in the same text). Comparison with earlier sources such as [[Natural History (Pliny)|Pliny's Natural History]] (bk 12.28-9) in 77–79 AD where values were given for long pepper at 15 denarii/lb, 7 denarii/lb for white, and 4 denarii/lb for black are problematic due to inflation in the intervening decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crawford|Reynolds|1979|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mango|2009 |p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

{{quotation|They just couldn't get enough of it, wars were fought over it. And if you look at Roman recipes, every one starts with: 'Take pepper and mix with ...' (Christine McFadden, food writer)

When the Romans came to Britain they brought a lot of material culture and a lot of habits with them that made the people of Britain feel Roman; they identified with the Roman culture. Wine was one of these – olive oil was another – and pepper would have been a more valuable one in this same sort of 'set' of Romanitas. (Roberta Tomber, British Museum Visiting Fellow)

So regularly filling a large silver pepper pot like ours would have taken its toll on the grocery bills. And the household that owned our pepper pot had another three silver pots, for pepper or other spice – one shaped as Hercules in action, and two in the shape of animals. This is dizzying extravagance, the stuff of [[bankers' bonuses]]. But the pepper pots are just a tiny part of the great hoard of buried treasure. ([[Neil MacGregor]], British Museum Director)

====Other silver pieces====
[[File:Hoxne Hoard ladle.JPG|thumb|alt=A spoon with an ornately decorated handle, two fish reinforce the junction of bowl and handle which ends in a flower like pommel|A {{convert|13|cm|in|abbr=on}} long "ladle" from the hoard, with decoration including a Chi-Rho and sea-creatures]]

[[File:Hoxne Hoard spoon detail 2.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Cochlearium with a Christian monogram cross|[[Cochlearium]] detail showing inscribed Christian monogram cross in the base of the bowl]]
The tigress is a solid-cast statuette weighing {{convert|480|g|oz}} and measuring {{convert|15.9|cm|in|abbr=on}} from head to tail. She was designed to be [[soldering|soldered]] onto some other object as its handle; traces of [[tin]] were found beneath her rear paws, which have a "smoothly concave curve".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|pp=61–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; She looks most aesthetically pleasing when the serpentine curves of her head, back, rump, and tail form a line at an angle of about 45°, when the rear paws are flat, allowing for their curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|pp=64, 186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her gender is obvious as there are six engorged [[teat]]s under her belly. She is carefully decorated on her back, but her underside is "quite perfunctorily finished".&lt;ref name="johns2010-62"&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her stripes are represented by two engraved lines, with a black [[niello]] inlay between them, in most places not meeting the engraved lines. Neither her elongated body, nor the distribution of the stripes are accurate for the species; she has a long dorsal stripe running from the skull along the spine to the start of the tail, which is typical of [[tabby cat]]s rather than tigers. The figure has no stripes around her tail, which thickens at the end, suggesting a thick fur tip as in a lion's tail, which tigers do not have, although Roman art usually gives them one.&lt;ref name="johns2010-62" /&gt; &lt;!--Early representation of lionesses may be confused with tigers because in some populations of European lions, adults retained stripes on the body as cubs elsewhere frequently have. Stripes appear in prehistoric European cave drawings of lionesses hunting. Tigers and lions remain close enough genetically that they can have viable offspring. The distinctive tuft at the end of the tail is more telling for lionesses. It often is overlooked that the lioness had a long history of importance in ancient cultures as the ferocious hunter for the pride.--&gt;

The large collection of spoons includes 51 ''[[Cochlearium|cochlearia]]'', which are small spoons with shallow bowls and long, tapering handles with a pointed end which was used to pierce eggs and spear small pieces of food—as the Romans did not use forks at the table.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faas|2002|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 23 ''[[cigni]]'', which are much rarer, having large rather shallow spoons with shorter, bird-headed handles; and about 20 deep round spoons or small ladles and strainer-spoons. Many are decorated with abstract motifs and some with dolphins or fanciful marine creatures. Many of the spoons are decorated with a Christian monogram cross or Chi-Rho symbol, and sometimes, also with the Greek letters [[alpha and omega]] (an appellation for [[Jesus]], who is described as the ''alpha'' and ''omega'' in the [[Book of Revelation]]). Three sets of ten spoons, and several other spoons, are decorated with such Christian symbols. As is often the case with Roman silver spoons, many also have a Latin inscription on them, either simply naming their owner or wishing their owner long life. In total, eight different people are named; seven on the spoons, and one on the single beaker in the hoard: Aurelius Ursicinus, Datianus, Euherius, Faustinus, Peregrinus, Quintus, Sanctus, and Silvicola. The most common name is "Aurelius Ursicinus", which occurs on a set of five ''cochlearia'' and five ladles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|pp=166–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown whether any of the people named in these inscriptions would have been involved in hiding the hoard or were even alive at the time it was buried.

Although only one of these inscriptions is explicitly Christian (''vivas in deo''),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|pp=167–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; inscriptions on silver spoons comprising a name followed by ''vivas'' or ''vivat'' usually can be identified as Christian in other late Roman hoards; for example the [[Mildenhall Treasure]] has five spoons, three with Chi-Rho monograms, and two with ''vivas'' inscriptions (PASCENTIA VIVAS and PAPITTEDO VIVAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watts|1991| p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formula ''vir bone vivas'' also occurs on a spoon from the [[Thetford Hoard]], but whereas the Thetford Hoard spoons have mostly pagan inscriptions (e.g. ''Dei Fau[ni] Medugeni'' "of the god Faunus Medugenus [the Mead begotten]"),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watts|1991| pp=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Hoxne Hoard does not have any inscriptions of a specifically pagan nature, and the hoard may be considered to have come from a Christian household (or households). It often is assumed that Roman spoons with Chi-Rho monograms or the ''vivas in deo'' formula are either christening spoons (perhaps presented at adult baptism) or were used in the [[Eucharist]] ceremony, but that is not certain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raybould|1999| p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hoxne Hoard silver personal utensils 2.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Two long, thin metal objects. The right object resembles a double-ended dentist pick in the shape of a crane bird. Its legs form the lower half, ending in a small pick; the body and wings form the handle in the middle; whereas the curved neck, head and long pointed beak form the upper pick. The left object is straight; a thin twisted rod ends in a large ball, followed by a fish motif again bounded by a ball, and ending in a crown with its peaks pointing inwards, presumably to hold bristles.|Two toiletry items: one in the shape of a crane-like bird; the other with an empty socket, probably for bristles for a makeup brush]]

There are also a number of small items of uncertain function, described as toiletry pieces. Some are picks, others perhaps scrapers, and three have empty sockets at one end, which probably contained organic material such as [[bristle]], to make a brush. The size of these would be appropriate for cleaning the teeth or applying cosmetics, among other possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|pp=165–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average purity of the silver items is 96%. The remainder of the metal is made up of copper and a small amount of [[zinc]], with trace amounts of [[lead]], gold, and [[bismuth]] present. The zinc is likely to have been present in a copper [[brass]] used to [[alloy]] the silver when the objects were made, and the lead, gold, and bismuth probably were present in the unrefined silver [[ore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iron and organic materials===
The iron objects found in the hoard are probably the remains of the outer wooden chest. These consist of large iron rings, double-spiked loops and hinges, strap hinges, probable components of locks, angle brackets, wide and narrow iron strips, and nails.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|pp=159–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organic finds are rarely well documented with hoards because most coin and treasure finds are removed hastily by the finder or have previously been disrupted by farm work rather than excavated. The Hoxne organic finds included bone, wood, other plant material, and leather. Small fragments were found from a decorated ivory [[pyxis (pottery)|pyxis]] (a cylindrical lidded box), along with more than 150 tiny shaped pieces of bone inlay or veneer, probably from a wooden box or boxes that have decayed. Minuscule fragments of wood adhering to metal objects were identified as belonging to nine species of timber, all native to Britain; wood traces associated with the iron fittings of the outer chest established that it was made of oak. Silver locks and hinges were from two small wooden boxes or caskets, one made of decorative cherry wood and one made of yew.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|pp=13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some wheat straw survived from padding between the plain silver bowls, which also bore faint traces of linen cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leather fragments were too degraded for identification.

==Scientific analysis of finds==
The initial metallurgical analysis of the hoard was carried out in late 1992 and early 1993 by Cowell and Hook for the procedural purposes of the coroner's inquest. This analysis used [[X-ray fluorescence]], a technique that was applied again later to cleaned surfaces on specimens.

All 29 items of gold jewellery were analysed, with silver and copper found to be present. Results were typical for Roman silver in hoards of the period, in terms of the presence of copper alloyed with the silver to harden it, and trace elements. One repaired bowl showed a mercury-based [[solder]].&lt;ref name="Cowell and Hook"&gt;Cowell and Hook, ''The analysis of the metal artefacts'', pp. 175–184 in Johns (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The large armlet of pierced gold (''[[opus interrasile]]'') showed traces of [[hematite]] on the reverse side, which probably would have been used as a type of [[jeweller's rouge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the earliest known and documented use of this technique on Roman jewellery.&lt;ref name = "La Niece"&gt;La Niece, ''Roman gold- and silversmithing and the Hoxne treasure'', pp. 185–188 in Johns (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Gilt items showed the presence of mercury, indicating the [[gilding#Fire-gilding|mercury gilding]] technique.&lt;ref name="Cowell and Hook"/&gt; The black inlay on the cast silver tigress shows the ''[[niello]]'' technique, but with [[silver sulphide]] rather than [[Galena (mineral)|lead sulphide]].&lt;ref name="La Niece"/&gt; The settings of stones where garnet and amethyst remain, in the body chain, have vacant places presumed to be where pearls were set, and show elemental [[sulphur]] as adhesive or filler.&lt;ref name="La Niece"/&gt;

==Burial and historical background==
The Hoxne Hoard was buried during a period of great upheaval in Britain, marked by the collapse of Roman authority in the province, the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|departure of the majority of the Roman army]], and the first of a wave of attacks by the [[Anglo-Saxon]]s.&lt;ref name=Campbell_TAS_13&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|John|Wormald|1991| pp=13–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attacks on Italy by the [[Visigoths]] around the turn of the fifth century caused the general [[Stilicho]] to recall Roman army units from [[Rhaetia]], [[Gaul]], and [[Britannia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snyder|1998| pp=18, 269}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Stilicho held off the Visigoth attack, the Western provinces were left defenceless against [[Suebi]], [[Alans]], and [[Vandals]] who crossed the frozen [[Rhine]] in 406 and overran Gaul. The remaining Roman troops in Britain, fearing that the invaders would cross the Channel, elected a series of emperors of their own to lead the defence.

The first two such emperors were put to death by the dissatisfied soldiery in a matter of months, but the third, who would declare himself [[Constantine III (western emperor)|Constantine III]], led a British force across the [[English Channel]] to Gaul in his bid to become Roman Emperor. After scoring victories against the "barbarians" in Gaul, Constantine was defeated by an army loyal to [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] and beheaded in 411.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snyder|1998| pp=19–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Constantine's departure had left Britain vulnerable to attacks from [[Saxon]] and Irish raiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snyder|1998| pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 410, Roman histories give little information about events in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snyder|1998| p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the next decade, [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]] described [[Sub-Roman Britain|Britain after 410]] as a "province fertile of tyrants",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snyder|1998| p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting the collapse of central authority and the rise of local leaders in response to repeated raids by Saxons and others. By 452, a Gaulish chronicler was able to state that some ten years previously "the Britons, which to this time had suffered from various disasters and misfortunes, are reduced by the power of the Saxons".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snyder|1998| p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burial===
Exactly who owned the Hoxne Hoard, and their reasons for burying it, are not known, and probably never will be. However, the hoard itself and its context provide some important clues. The hoard evidently was buried carefully, some distance from any buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hoard very likely represents only a portion of the precious-metal wealth of the person, or people, who owned it; many common types of jewellery are missing, as are large tableware items such as those found in the [[Mildenhall Treasure]]. It is unlikely that anyone would have possessed the rich gold and silver items found in the Hoxne Hoard without owning items in those other categories. Whoever owned the hoard also would have had wealth in the form of land, livestock, buildings, furniture, and clothing. At most, the Hoxne Hoard represents a moderate portion of the wealth of someone rich; conversely, it may represent a minuscule fraction of the wealth of a family that was incredibly wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearance of the names "Aurelius Ursicinus" and "Juliane" on items in the Hoxne Hoard need not imply that people by those names owned the rest of the hoard, either at the time of its burial or previously.&lt;ref name="john206"&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Warner58"&gt;{{harvnb|Warner|1996| p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no historical references to an "Aurelius Ursicinus" in Britain in this period. While a "Marcus Aurelius Ursicinus" is recorded in the [[Praetorian Guard]] in Rome in the period 222–235,&lt;ref name="Johns2010-p168"&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; a soldier or official of the late fourth or early fifth century would be more likely to take the imperial [[Roman naming conventions|nomen]] Flavius, rather than Aurelius. This leads Tomlin to speculate "The name "Aurelius Ursicinus" might sound old-fashioned; it would certainly have been more appropriate to a provincial landowner than an army officer or government official".&lt;ref name="Johns2010-p168" /&gt;

There are a number of theories about why the hoard was buried. One is that the hoard represented a deliberate attempt to keep wealth safe, perhaps in response to one of the many upheavals facing Roman Britain in the early fifth century. This is not the only hypothesis, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010| pp=205, 208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist Peter Guest argues that the hoard was buried because the items in it were used as part of a system of gift-exchange, and as Britain separated from the Roman Empire, they were no longer required.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guest|2005| p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third hypothesis is that the Hoxne Hoard represents the proceeds of a robbery, buried to avoid detection.&lt;ref name="john206"/&gt;

===Late Roman hoards===

In the center ring, whose diameter is roughly 1/7 of the whole dish, is the face of a full-bearded man, with four bird heads pointing outwards along the diagonals. Around the second ring, frolicking sea creatures such as nereids are depicted; this ring's diameter is roughly 3/7 of the dish. Around the outermost ring, humans and a faun are depicted as dancing, making music, drinking and enjoying other pastimes.|The fourth century "Great Dish" from the Mildenhall Treasure is a fine example of large silver tableware of the sort missing at Hoxne,{{refn|"They call it 'the most beautiful object to survive from Roman Britain', although it had been imported. It was perhaps deposited around 360."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Painter|Kent|1977| p=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} although it is believed the owners also would have possessed such pieces &lt;ref name="johns61"/&gt;]]

The Hoxne Hoard comes from the later part of a century (''c''. 350–450) from which an unusually large number of hoards have been discovered, mostly from the fringes of the Empire.&lt;ref name=pk18-19/&gt; Such hoards vary in character, but many include the large pieces of silver tableware lacking in the Hoxne Hoard: dishes, jugs and ewers, bowls and cups, some plain, but many highly decorated.&lt;ref name=pk18-19&gt;{{harvnb|Painter|Kent|1977| pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other major hoards discovered in modern East Anglia in the last century are from the fourth century; both are now in the British Museum. The [[Mildenhall Treasure]] from Suffolk consists of thirty items of silver tableware deposited in the late fourth century, many large and elaborately decorated, such as the "Great Dish".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Painter|Kent|1977| pp=33–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Water Newton Treasure]] from [[Cambridgeshire]] is smaller, but is the earliest hoard to have a clearly Christian character, apparently belonging to a church or chapel;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Painter|Kent|1977| pp=29–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; the assorted collection probably includes items made in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|Johns|1992 |p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kaiseraugst]] Treasure from the site at [[Augusta Raurica]] in modern [[Switzerland]] (now in [[Basel]]) contained 257 items, including a banqueting service with sophisticated decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Painter|Kent|1977| pp=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Esquiline Treasure]], found in Rome, evidently came from a wealthy Roman family of the late fourth century, and includes several large items, including the "Casket of Projecta".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Painter|Kent|1977| p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Esquiline Treasure is in the British Museum, as are bowls and dishes from the [[Carthage Treasure]] which belonged to a known family in Roman Africa around 400.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Painter|Kent|1977| pp=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mildenhall, Kaiseraugst, and Esquiline treasures comprise large items of tableware. Other hoards, however, such as those found at [[Thetford Hoard|Thetford]] and [[Beaurains Treasure|Beaurains]] consist mostly of coins, jewellery, and small tableware items; these two hoards probably are pagan [[votive offering]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guest|2005| p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hoard from [[Traprain Law]] in Scotland contains decorated Roman silver pieces cut up and folded, showing regard for the value of their metal alone, and may represent loot from a raid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ritchie|Ritchie|1981|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local context===
Hoxne, where the hoard was discovered, is located in Suffolk in modern-day [[East Anglia]]. Although no large, aristocratic [[Roman villa|villa]] has been located in the Hoxne area, there was a Roman settlement nearby from the first through fourth centuries at [[Scole]], about {{convert|3.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} north–west of Hoxne, at the intersection of two [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman roads]]. One of these, [[Pye Road]], (today's [[A140 road|A140]]), linked [[Venta Icenorum]] ([[Caistor St Edmund]]) to [[Camulodunum]] ([[Colchester]]) and [[Londinium]] ([[London]]).&lt;ref name="database" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Warner|1996|p= 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Location map+|Hoxne|float=right|width=254|alt=This map shows the hoard between the village of Hoxne and the town of Eye – across the map is an old Roman road and the settlement at Scole|caption=Near to the hoard are a Roman settlement at Scole and an earlier hoard at Eye; the major road in red follows the route of an older Roman Road, ([[Pye Road]])|places=

}}
The field in which the hoard was discovered was shown by the 1994 excavation to probably have been cleared by the early Bronze Age, when it began to be used for agriculture and settlement. Some settlement activity occurred near the hoard findspot by the first half of the first millennium BC,&lt;ref name="johns16"/&gt; but there is no evidence of Roman buildings in the immediate vicinity. The field where the hoard was deposited may have been in cultivation during the early phase of the Roman period but the apparent absence of fourth-century coins suggests that it may have been converted to pasture or else had reverted to woodland by that time.&lt;ref name="johns16"/&gt;

The Hoxne Hoard is not the only cache of Roman treasure to have been discovered in the area. In 1781 some labourers unearthed a lead box by the river at Clint Farm in [[Eye, Suffolk|Eye]], {{convert|4.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Scole and {{convert|3.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} south–west of Hoxne. The box contained about 600 Roman gold coins dating to the reigns of [[Valens]] and Valentinian I (reigned 364–375), Gratian (375–383), [[Theodosius I]] (378–395), Arcadius (395–408), and Honorius (393–423).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robertson|2000| p=404}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the largest hoard of Roman gold coins ever discovered in Britain, but the coins were dispersed during the 18th and 19th centuries, and cannot now be easily be identified in coin collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdy|2002| p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the relationship (if any) between the Eye hoard and that in Hoxne cannot be determined, even if the proximity suggests they may have been related.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|Bland|1994|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the Hoxne Hoard was discovered, there was speculation, based on the name "Faustinus" engraved on one of the spoons, that it may have come from the "Villa Faustini" that is recorded in Itinerary V of the [[Antonine Itinerary]].&lt;ref name="Warner59"&gt;{{harvnb|Warner|1996|p= 59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact location of Villa Faustini is unknown, but as it was the first station after Colchester, it is believed to have been somewhere on the Pye Road (modern A140) and one of the possible locations for it is the modern village of Scole, only a couple of miles from Hoxne. This early theory has since been rejected, however, because "Faustinus" was historically a common name, and it only occurs on a single spoon in the hoard.&lt;ref name="Warner59" /&gt; Furthermore, the logic of using inscriptions on individual items in the hoard to determine ownership of the hoard as a whole is considered flawed.&lt;ref name="Warner58" /&gt; Based on the dating of the coins in the hoard, the majority of which belong to the period 394–405,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bland|Johns|1993b| p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also has been speculated that the contents of the hoard originally belonged to a military family that accompanied [[Count Theodosius]] to Britain in 368–369, and which may have left with Constantine III in 407.&lt;ref name="Warner58"/&gt;

==Acquisition, display, and impact==

The smaller inner box contains coins, whereas the larger contains two goblets and stacked ladles. The shelf holds gold bracelets, gold chains, and engraved spoons.|Reconstruction of chest layout, Room 49 permanent display]]
The hoard was acquired by the British Museum in April 1994.&lt;ref name="Johns 2010-p4"&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010| p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Museum's entire purchase fund amounted to only £1.4 million at the time,&lt;ref name=johnsNovDec1993&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|Nov/Dec 1993|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the hoard had to be purchased with the assistance of donors that included the [[National Heritage Memorial Fund]], the [[National Art Collections Fund]] (now the Art Fund), and the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]].&lt;ref name="Johns 2010-p4" /&gt; The grants from these and other benefactors enabled the museum to raise the £1.75 million needed for the acquisition.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{citation |title=Plan to extend protection for buried treasure |last=Goodwin |first=Stephen |date=9 March 1996 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/plan-to-extend-protection-for-buried-treasure-1341027.html |accessdate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bj1993"&gt;{{harvnb|Bland|Johns|1993a| p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Items from the hoard have been on display almost continuously since the treasure was received at the British Museum. Some items were displayed at the Museum as early as September 1993 in response to public interest. Much of the hoard was exhibited at [[Ipswich Museum]] in 1994–1995. From 1997, the most important items went on permanent display at the British Museum in a new and enlarged Roman Britain gallery (Room 49), alongside the roughly contemporary Thetford Hoard,&lt;ref name="Johns 2010-p4" /&gt; and adjacent to the Mildenhall Treasure, which contains large silver vessels of types that are absent from the Hoxne Hoard. Some items from the Hoxne Hoard were included in ''Treasure: Finding Our Past'', a touring exhibition that was shown in five cities in England and Wales in 2003. A [[perspex]] reconstruction of the chest and inner boxes in which it was deposited was created for this tour, showing the arrangement of the different types of items with sample items inside. It is now part of the permanent display in London, along with other items laid out more traditionally.&lt;ref name="Johns 2010-p4" /&gt;

The first comprehensive research on the Hoard was published in the full catalogue of the coins by Peter Guest in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guest|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the catalogue of the other objects by Catherine Johns in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johns|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hoard was third in the list of British archaeological finds selected by experts at the British Museum for the 2003 [[BBC Television]] [[Documentary television series|documentary]] ''[[Our Top Ten Treasures]]'', which included archive footage of its finder, Eric Lawes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | ref=BBC-2Jan2003 | author=Staff | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/2622111.stm | title=Top ten treasures announced | date=2 January 2003 | newspaper=[[BBC News]] | accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Empress" pepper-pot was selected as item 40 in the 2010 [[BBC Radio 4]] series ''[[A History of the World in 100 Objects]]''.&lt;ref name="hist" /&gt;

The discovery and excavation of the Hoxne Hoard improved the relationship between the archaeological profession and the community of metal detectorists. Archaeologists were pleased that Lawes reported the find promptly and largely undisturbed, allowing a professional excavation. Metal detectorists noted that Lawes' efforts were appreciated by the archaeological profession.&lt;ref name="johns2"/&gt; The [[Treasure Act 1996]] is thought to have contributed to more hoards being made available to archaeologists. The act changed the law so that the owner of the land and the person who finds the hoard have a strong stake in the value of the discovery.&lt;ref name="Gilcrist"&gt;{{cite news |ref=Gilcrist |last=Gilcrist |first=Andrew |title=There's gold in them there hills |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/nov/17/heritage.highereducation |newspaper=The Guardian |date=17 November 2003 |accessdate=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manner of the finding of the Hoxne Hoard by metal detector, and its widespread publicity, contributed to changing the previous system of common law for dealing with treasure trove into a statutory legal framework that takes into account technology such as metal detectors, provides incentives for treasure hunters to report finds, and considers the interests of museums and scholars.&lt;ref name="Gilcrist"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.finds.org.uk/documents/treasure_act.pdf |title=The Treasure Act 1996 Code of Practice (2nd Revision) |publisher=[[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] | accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Interdental consonants''' are produced by placing the tip of the tongue between the upper and lower front teeth. This differs from [[dental consonant]]s, which are [[place of articulation|articulated]] with the tongue against the ''back'' of the upper incisors.

Interdental consonants may be transcribed with both a subscript and a superscript bridge, as {{angbr|{{IPA|n̪͆ t̪͆ d̪͆ θ̪͆ ð̪͆ r̪͆ l̪͆ ɬ̪͆ ɮ̪͆}}}}, if precision is required, but it is more common to transcribe them as advanced alveolars, as {{angbr|{{IPA|n̟ t̟ d̟ θ̟ ð̟ r̟ l̟ ɬ̟ ɮ̟}}}}.

Interdental consonants are rare cross-linguistically. Interdental realisations of otherwise dental or alveolar consonants may occur as idiosyncrasies or as coarticulatory effects of a neighbouring interdental sound. The most commonly occurring interdental consonants are the non-[[sibilant]] fricatives (sibilants may be dental, but do not appear as interdentals). Apparently, interdentals do not contrast with dental consonants within any language.

Voiced and voiceless interdental fricatives {{IPA|[ð̟, θ̟]}} appear in [[American English]] as the initial sounds of words like 'then' and 'thin'. In [[British English]], these consonants are more likely to be dental {{IPA|[ð, θ]}}.

An interdental {{IPA|[l̟]}} occurs in some varieties of [[Italian language|Italian]], and may also occur in some varieties of English, though the distribution and usage of interdental {{IPA|[l̟]}} in English are not clear.

Interdental approximants are found in about a dozen [[Philippine languages]], including [[Kagayanen language|Kagayanen]] ([[Manobo languages|Manobo]] branch), Karaga [[Mandaya language|Mandaya]] ([[Mansakan languages|Mansakan]] branch), [[Kalagan language|Kalagan]] ([[Mansakan languages|Mansakan]] branch), [[Southern Catanduanes Bikol language|Southern Catanduanes Bicolano]], and several varieties of [[Kalinga language|Kalinga]].&lt;ref&gt;Machlan, Glenn and Olson, Kenneth S. and Amangao, Nelson. 2008. "[http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/1772/olson.html Minangali (Kalinga) digital wordlist: presentation form]". ''Language Documentation and Conservation'' 2, 141-156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interdental {{IPA|[ɮ̟]}} occurs in some dialects of [[Amis language|Amis]]. [[Mapuche language|Mapuche]] has interdental {{IPA|[n̟]}}, {{IPA|[t̟]}}, and {{IPA|[l̟]}}.

In most [[Indigenous Australian languages]], there is a series of "dental" consonants, written ''th'', ''nh'', and (in some languages) ''lh''. These are always [[laminal consonant|laminal]] (that is, pronounced by touching with the blade of the tongue), but may be formed in one of three different ways, depending on the language, on the speaker, and on how carefully the speaker pronounces the sound. These are '''apical interdental''' {{IPA|[t̺͆/d̺͆ n̺͆ l̺͆]}} with the ''tip'' of the tongue visible between the teeth, as in ''th'' in American English; '''laminal interdental''' {{IPA|[t̻͆/d̻͆ n̻͆ l̻͆]}} with the tip of the tongue down behind the lower teeth, so that the ''blade'' is visible between the teeth; and [[denti-alveolar consonant|denti-alveolar]] {{IPA|[t̻̪/d̻̪ n̻̪ l̻̪]}}, that is, with both the tip and the blade making contact with the back of the upper teeth and alveolar ridge, as in French ''t'', ''d'', ''n'', ''l''.

'''''Klio: Beiträge zur alten Geschichte''''' is a biannual [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] covering [[ancient history]], focussing on the history of [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Roman Empire|Rome]] from the [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]] to [[Late Antiquity]], as well as relationships with the [[Ancient Near East]]. Areas covered also include [[epigraphy]], [[papyrology]], [[archaeology]] and [[numismatics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Klio Beiträge zur Alten Geschichte|url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/klio?rskey=2G8iLK&amp;result=44|website=De Gruyter|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The journal is published by [[Walter de Gruyter]] and articles are in English, French, German, Italian, or Spanish.

== History ==
The journal was established in 1901 as ''Beiträge zur alten Geschichte'' (English: ''Contributions to Ancient History''). Since the 6th issue, it has been named ''Klio'', after [[Clio]], the [[muse]] of [[historiography]]. The first [[editor-in-chief]] was [[Carl Ferdinand Friedrich Lehmann-Haupt|Carl F. Lehmann]]; in 1903 he was joined by [[Ernst Kornemann]]. The journal was published by Leipziger Dieterich-Verlag until 1944. After a first continuously numbered series of the journal from 1901 to 1923, a "New Series" was begun in 1925, which restarted at number one and came to an end with number 18 in 1944. In 1959, the first volume of a renewed series was published by [[Akademie Verlag]] ([[East Germany]]) as number 37 (as if the two previous series had been continuously numbered), although the journal ''[[Historia (Antiquity journal)|Historia]]'' had been founded in 1950 in West Germany as a replacement. A third "major" journal, ''[[Chiron (journal)|Chiron]]'' appeared from 1971. However, the importance of the pre-war series ensured that the full set was reprinted at the beginning of the 1960s, although not in the same format or at the same quality as the original publication.

Until 1992, ''Klio'' was edited by the government-controlled [[Zentralinstitut für Alte Geschichte und Archäologie]]. However, it also published works of Western historians and sometimes included [[Russian language]] contributions. Important articles appeared in ''Klio'' even after 1959, but the publications of [[East Germany|East German]] scholars at this time were not always up to date or at the level of international research, as a result of the shortage of money and the enforcement of the state's ideological views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Willing |first1=Matthias |title=Althistorische Forschung in der DDR.

In 1993 the journal received a new [[editorial board]]. The current editors are [[Manfred Clauss]] (Frankfurt am Main), [[Hans-Joachim Gehrke]] (Freiburg/Berlin),[[Peter Funke]] (Münster) and [[Christian Mann]] (Mannheim).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Klio.

From 1903 until 1944 and again since 1999 (in a ''Neuen Folge'' - new series) the journal has published ''Klio-Beihefte'' (''Klio Supplements''), consisting of [[monograph]]s, mostly published doctoral theses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Neue Folge der Beihefte der 'Klio' |journal=Gnomon |date=1999 |volume=71 |issue=7 |page=656}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Klio |journal=Gnomon |date=1991 |volume=63 |issue=3 |page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5313">The term '''language center''' or '''language centre''' (or more accurately centers, e.g. [[Broca's area]] and [[Wernicke's area]]) refers to the areas of the [[brain]] which serve a particular function for speech processing and production.&lt;ref name="thebrain"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/d/d_10/d_10_cr/d_10_cr_lan/d_10_cr_lan.html | title=BROCA’S AREA, WERNICKE’S AREA, AND OTHER LANGUAGE-PROCESSING AREAS IN THE BRAIN | publisher=The Brain From Top to Bottom | accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current scientific consensus ==
New medical imaging techniques such as [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] have allowed researchers to generate pictures showing which areas of a living brain are active at a given time. In the past, research was primarily based on observations of loss of ability resulting from damage to the [[cerebral cortex]]. Indeed, medical imaging has represented a radical step forward for research on speech processing. Since then, a whole series of relatively large areas of the brain have been found to be involved in speech processing. In more recent research, subcortical regions (those lying below the cerebral cortex such as the [[putamen]] and the [[caudate nucleus]]) as well as the pre-motor areas ([[Brodmann area 6|BA 6]])  have received increased attention. It is now generally assumed that the following structures of the cerebral cortex near the [[Primary auditory cortex|primary and secondary auditory cortices]] play a fundamental role in speech processing:

* ''[[Superior temporal gyrus]]'' (STG): [[Morphology (linguistics)#Paradigms and morphosyntax|morphosyntactic]] processing (anterior section), integration of [[syntax|syntactic]] and [[semantics|semantic]] information (posterior section)
* ''[[Inferior frontal gyrus]]'' (IFG, [[Brodmann area]] (BA) [[Brodmann area 45|45]]/[[Brodmann area 47|47]]): syntactic processing, [[working memory]]
* ''[[Inferior frontal gyrus]]'' (IFG, [[Brodmann area 44|BA 44]]): syntactic processing, working memory
* ''[[Middle temporal gyrus]]'' (MTG): [[Lexical semantics|lexical semantic]] processing

The left hemisphere is usually dominant in right-handed people, although bilateral activations are not uncommon in the area of syntactic processing. It is now accepted that the right hemisphere plays an important role in the processing of suprasegmental acoustic features like [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]].

Most areas of speech processing develop in the second year of life in the dominant half ([[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]]) of the brain, which often (though not necessarily) corresponds to the opposite of the [[handedness|dominant hand]]. 98% of right-handed people are left-hemisphere dominant, and the majority of left-handed people as well.

The [[Angular Gyrus]] is represented in orange, [[Supramarginal Gyrus]] is represented in yellow, [[Broca's area]] is represented in blue, [[Wernicke's area]] is represented in green and the [[Primary Auditory Cortex]] is represented in pink.]]
The differentiation of speech production into only two large sections of the brain (i.e. Broca's and Wernicke's areas), accepted long before the advent of medical imaging techniques, is now considered outdated. Broca's Area was first suggested to play a role in speech function by the French neurologist and anthropologist Paul Broca in 1861. The basis for this discovery was analysis of speech problems resulting from injuries to this region of the brain, located in the inferior frontal gyrus. Lesions to Broca's Area resulted primarily in disruptions to speech production. Damage to Wernicke's Area, which is located in the lower part of the [[temporal lobe]], lead mainly to disruptions in speech reception. This area was named for German doctor [[Carl Wernicke]], who discovered it in 1874 in the course of his research into [[aphasia]]s (loss of ability to speak).

Broca's Area is today still considered an important language center, playing a central role in processing syntax, grammar, and sentence structure.

In summary, these early research efforts demonstrated that semantic and structural speech production takes place in different areas of the brain.

The '''Leekfrith torcs''' are four [[Iron Age Europe|Iron Age]] gold [[torc]]s found by two hobby [[metal detector]]ists in December 2016 in a field in [[Leekfrith]], north [[Staffordshire]], England. The find consists of three neck torcs and a smaller bracelet, which were located in proximity to each other. They are believed to be the oldest Iron Age [[gold jewellery]] found in Britain. Subsequent archaeological examination of the area did not uncover further objects.

==Description==
One of the torcs is a smaller bracelet decorated with ornament in the style of [[Celtic art]], and the other three are neck rings.&lt;ref name="staffordshire" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sentinel" /&gt; The bracelet and one of the neck rings are made with twisted gold wire, and the other neck rings have [[finial]]s shaped like trumpets.&lt;ref name="staffordshire" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gu" /&gt; One of the latter has been broken into two pieces.&lt;ref name="Sentinel_3" /&gt; 

The gold content of the four torcs has been measured using [[x-ray fluorescence]] to be between 74-78% (roughly equivalent to [[Fineness|17-18 carat]]), with 18-22% [[silver]], some [[copper]], and traces of [[iron]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[tin]] – a mix consistent with other Iron Age gold finds in Europe.&lt;ref name="staffordshire" /&gt; The weight of the pieces varies from {{convert|31|g|oz|sigfig=1}} to {{convert|230|g|oz|sigfig=1}},&lt;ref name="BBC-39113201" /&gt; and over {{convert|350|g|oz|sigfig=1}} in total.&lt;ref name="staffslive" /&gt;

According to Julia Farley, curator of British and European Iron Age collections of the [[British Museum]],&lt;ref name="BMJF" /&gt; the torcs were "most likely" made in the area of what is now Germany or France,&lt;ref name="staffordshire" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gu" /&gt; most likely in the period 400–250 BCE ([[La Tène culture|La Tène period]]).  Farley commented:&lt;ref name="BBC-39113201" /&gt;&lt;ref name="staffordshire" /&gt;

{{Quote|sign=|source=|This unique find is of international importance. It dates to around 400–250 BCE and is probably the earliest Iron Age gold work ever discovered in Britain. The torcs were probably worn by wealthy and powerful women, perhaps people from the Continent who had married into the local community. Piecing together how these objects came to be carefully buried in a Staffordshire field will give us an invaluable insight into life in Iron Age Britain.}}

==Discovery==
The torcs were found by Mark Hambleton and Joe Kania at around noon on 11 December 2016,&lt;ref name="staffslive" /&gt; in a field in [[Leekfrith]] that  the two men were  searching using [[metal detector]]s. The men had permission from the landowner for the search.&lt;ref name="Sentinel" /&gt; At the time, Hambleton and Kania had not discovered anything of note with their metal detectors besides Victorian coins. They had no fixed plans as they surveyed the field, having started metal detecting as a hobby 18 months before (although Hambleton used to go metal-detecting with his father when he was young).&lt;ref name="McInnes-2" /&gt;

They found the first three torcs separately, approximately {{convert|6|to|8|inch|cm}} beneath the surface of the field&lt;ref name="McInnes-2" /&gt; and around {{convert|3.3|ft|m|sigfig=1}} apart.&lt;ref name="Sentinel" /&gt; The metal detectorists reported the find to a [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]] officer based at [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]] the next day.&lt;ref name="BBC-39113201" /&gt; The last torc was found by the same men, in the same field, several weeks later.&lt;ref name="McInnes-2" /&gt;

Archaeologists subsequently surveyed the site, but found no other items, declaring it a "complete find".&lt;ref name="Sentinel" /&gt; They also found no evidence of a settlement or grave on the site.&lt;ref name="gu" /&gt; A missing piece of the smallest torc was discovered by the original metal detectorists on 26 February 2017.&lt;ref name="staffslive" /&gt;

==Inquest==

[[File:Potteries museum &amp; art gallery.JPG|thumb|The [[Potteries Museum &amp; Art Gallery]], where the torcs were first put on display to the public]]

The find was publicly announced on 28 February 2017 at a [[press conference]] at the [[Potteries Museum &amp; Art Gallery]] in [[Hanley, Staffordshire|Hanley]].&lt;ref name="staffordshire" /&gt;

At an inquest held later the same day, the torcs were declared to be 'Treasure' under the [[Treasure Act 1996]].&lt;ref name="BBC-39113201" /&gt; {{nowrap|H M Senior}} Coroner for Stoke-on-Trent and North Staffordshire, Ian Smith,&lt;ref name="SSCB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.staffsscb.org.uk/Professionals/Procedures/Section-Ten/Section-Ten-Docs/Section-10G-Coroners-Contact-Details.pdf|title=Staffordshire &amp; Stoke-on-Trent Local Safeguarding Children Boards  Child Death Procedures|publisher=Staffordshire Local Safeguarding Children Board|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; described the find as "not quite in the same league as the [[Staffordshire Hoard]], but nevertheless exciting."&lt;ref name="BBC-39113201" /&gt;

As a result of the [[coroner]]'s finding, the items will be offered for sale to museums at a price set by an independent board of antiquities experts known as the [[Treasure Valuation Committee]], with the finders and landowners sharing the money paid by the museum that buys them.&lt;ref name="BBC-39113201" /&gt;

Prior to undergoing valuation, the torcs were placed on public display at the Potteries Museum &amp; Art Gallery from 1 March to 2 April 2017.&lt;ref name="potteries" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sentinel_3" /&gt;

'''Left Alternative''' was a UK political party resulting from the split within [[Respect – The Unity Coalition]] in late 2007.

The party operated in [[England and Wales]] and was backed by the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP). Soon after the split, the electoral label '''Left List''' was adopted and this label faced its first major electoral test in the [[London mayoral election, 2008|London mayoral elections]] and [[London Assembly election, 2008|London Assembly elections]] on 1 May 2008. [[Lindsey German]], the Mayoral candidate, came seventh and in both the Mayoral and Assembly elections, Left List received less than 1% of the vote, well down on Respect's performance in 2004. The name Left Alternative was subsequently adopted.

==History==
Respect was created in January 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3788125.stm BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt; using the issue of the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]] to mobilise its vote. Beyond this issue, it attempted to have a broad [[socialism|socialist]] agenda. Respect allows its members to hold membership of other political organisations and notably included the SWP. Respect's most high-profile figure has been [[George Galloway]], then [[Respect - The Unity Coalition|Respect]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Bethnal Green and Bow]], who was expelled from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 2003 for "bringing the party into disrepute".

===The crisis in Respect===
{{Main|Respect - The Unity Coalition#The split in Respect|l1=The split in Respect}}
In September 2007, Galloway wrote a letter to Respect's national council members saying that the party was "too disorganised" and "faced oblivion" unless it reformed its internal party management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themuslimweekly.com/fullstoryview.aspx?NewsID=215082B330A483E173B045F1&amp;MENUID=HOMENEWS&amp;DESCRIPTION=UK%20News Galloway slams own Respect party], ''[[The Muslim Weekly]]'', 14 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The letter also criticised the amount of money spent on the Organising for Fighting Unions conference and on an intervention at the Pride London [[LGBT]] rights event.

The letter was the opening shot in a dispute in Respect initially between Galloway and his supporters (including founding member [[Salma Yaqoob]]) on one side, and supporters of the SWP on the other. However the arguments later began to affect all of the membership including those not in the SWP or close to Galloway or Yaqoob. In particular, Galloway called for the appointment of a National Organiser, who would support the National Secretary, [[John Rees (activist)|John Rees]] (then an SWP member). The SWP perceived this to be an attempt to undermine John Rees who was the dominant voice for the SWP within Respect's leadership. A letter from their Central Committee stated: "The SWP believed that the post was created to undermine Respect National Secretary John Rees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpgb.org.uk/worker/692/swp%20party%20notes.htm |title=From the SWP's Party Notes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018030211/http://www.cpgb.org.uk/worker/692/swp%20party%20notes.htm |archivedate=18 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of the dispute, the SWP expelled three members who sided with Galloway: [[Kevin Ovenden]] and [[Rob Hoveman]], who both worked for George Galloway, and Nick Wrack, who was nominated for the position of National Organiser.

On 3 November 2007, Galloway's side announced plans to hold a "[[Respect Renewal]]" conference on 17 November, the same day as the planned national conference of Respect. The Respect Renewal conference was an open event and organisers claim 350 people attended. This figure was disputed by [[Chris Harman]] in ''[[International Socialism (magazine)|International Socialism]]''. The Respect national conference, which went ahead on the same day was attended by 270 delegates from 49 local branches and 17 student groups, as well as 90 observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harman|first=Chris|url=http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=396&amp;issue=117|title=The Crisis in Respect|work=[[International Socialism (magazine)|International Socialism]]|year=2008|accessdate=5 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linda Smith, Respect's national chair at the time of the split, has claimed: "The sectarianism and ‘control freak’ methods of the SWP have led us to a situation where Respect is irretrievably split."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://respectrenewal.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=20|title=Renewing Respect}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SWP has attributed the split to a shift to the right by George Galloway and his allies, motivated by electoralism (placing election-winning above other principles). This, say the SWP leadership, led to attacks on the SWP as the most prominent left group in Respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swp.org.uk/respect_cc.php |title=The record: The Socialist Workers Party and Respect |author=SWP Central Committee Statement |date=3 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907150924/http://www.swp.org.uk/respect_cc.php |archivedate= 7 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Left List emerges===
The [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] refused to take a side in the split and therefore continued to recognise Linda Smith as the Nominating Officer for Respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.gov.uk/regulatory-issues/regpoliticalparties.cfm?frmGB=1&amp;frmPartyID=467&amp;frmType=partydetail|title=Register of political parties: Respect—The Unity Coalition|accessdate=2008-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that her signature is required for candidates wishing to use the electoral label "Respect" (and similar registered names) on ballot papers in UK elections. A letter from the Electoral Commission to Linda Smith on 23 January 2008, set out its position on the split, following confusion on the matter from both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialistunity.com/?p=1617|publisher=Socialist Unity|title=RESPECT—SWP can't use the name}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the split, the side that included the SWP (but not Galloway or Linda Smith) nominated candidates in two district council by-elections. They could not use the name "Respect" on ballot papers without the signature of the nominating officer. Instead, both had no label on the ballot papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preston.gov.uk/elections/ElectionWard.asp?ward=94|title=Preston City Council Electoral Ward Nominees}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walthamforest.gov.uk/index/council/elections/leyton-by-election/leyton-by-election-candidates.htm|title=Statement as to persons nominated|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070620191530/http://www.walthamforest.gov.uk/index/council/elections/leyton-by-election/leyton-by-election-candidates.htm|archivedate=20 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This side in the Respect split announced that in the [[London mayoral election, 2008|London mayoral elections]] planned for 1 May 2008 it would stand [[Lindsey German]] for mayor (Respect's candidate in 2004 and chosen as Respect's candidate in 2007 prior to the schism) and candidates for the London Assembly, elected on the same date. It announced that its candidates would contest these elections under a new electoral label, the Left List, since Linda Smith had not allowed them to be listed on ballot papers as Respect candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.respectcoalition.org/?ite=1833 |title=Respect's Left List launches GLA challenge |publisher=Respect—the Unity Coalition |accessdate=2008-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506072756/http://www.respectcoalition.org/?ite=1833 |archivedate= 6 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/regulatory-issues/regpoliticalparties.cfm?frmGB=1&amp;frmPartyID=818&amp;frmType=partydetail|title=Register of political parties: Left List}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=14397|title=Why Respect is Standing as 'Left List' in London|accessdate=2008-03-17|publisher=[[Socialist Worker]]|date=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Left List contested every constituency and stood on the London-wide proportional representation list.
At the council elections on 1 May 2008, the Left List also contested seats as the Left List or the Left Party, Maxine Bowler in Burngreave, Sheffield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.respectcoalition.org/?ite=1822 |title=Respect announces Left List for Mayoral and GLA elections |publisher=[[Respect Party|Respect - The Unity Coalition]] |date=2008-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322212630/http://www.respectcoalition.org/?ite=1822 |archivedate=22 March 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Respect Renewal]] stood in the City and East London constituency as well as contesting the London-wide list. George Galloway headed the London-wide party list, and Respect Renewal candidates stood under the name Respect (George Galloway).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.respectrenewal.org/content/view/211/1/ |title=We Can Win In East London This May |publisher=[[Respect Renewal]] |date=2008-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327181236/http://www.respectrenewal.org/content/view/211/1 |archivedate=27 March 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.respectrenewal.org/images/stories/downloads/respectspecialeditionmar08.pdf|format=PDF|title=Respect Newspaper Special Edition|publisher=[[Respect Renewal]]|date=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both factions of Respect suffered as a result and together failed to reach the previous number of votes.

=== Left Alternative ===
The organisation's website began to display the title Left Alternative in late June 2008. On 10 September 2008 John Rees and Lindsey German resigned from the Left Alternative National Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecommune.wordpress.com/2008/09/10/rees-and-german-resign-from-left-alternative-leadership/|title=rees and german resign from left alternative leadership|publisher=The Commune|accessdate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SWP dumps John Rees"&gt;[http://www.cpgb.org.uk/worker/737/swpdumps.html SWP dumps John Rees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925044309/http://www.cpgb.org.uk/worker/737/swpdumps.html |date=25 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most elected councillors who had joined Left List at the time of the split from Respect subsequently defected to other parties, mainly Labour, over the course of 2008.&lt;ref name="SWP dumps John Rees"/&gt; In 2008, one Left List councillor defected to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. In June of that year, the three remaining Left List councillors in Tower Hamlets, including the Chair and Nominating Officer of the Left List, defected to the Labour Party as did one Respect Renewal councillor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/content/towerhamlets/advertiser/news/story.aspx?brand=ELAOnline&amp;category=news&amp;tBrand=northlondon24&amp;tCategory=newsela&amp;itemid=WeED24%20Jun%202008%2019%3A44%3A39%3A473|title= New blow for Galloway as four more Respect members defect}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/search/story.aspx?brand=ELAOnline&amp;category=News&amp;itemid=WeED14%20Feb%202008%2014:33:40:697&amp;tBrand=ELAOnline&amp;tCategory=search|title=Galloway defector signs up to join Tory party}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation's website ceased operation in mid-2009. The party deregistered from the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] Register of Political Parties in April 2010.

[[Image:Machaquilast3.jpg|150px|thumb|right| A [[Maya stelae|stela]] from Machaquila, in the [[Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología]] in [[Guatemala City]]]]
'''Machaquila''' (or '''Machaquilá''', using [[Spanish language|Spanish]] orthography) is a major ruined [[Maya city|city]] of the [[Maya civilization]] in what is now the [[El Peten]] department of [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name="ChocónLaporte02p1"/&gt;

==Location==
The ruins of Machaquila fall within the [[Municipalities of Guatemala#Petén Department|municipality]] of [[Poptún]], in the [[Petén Department|Petén department]] of Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;Chocón and Laporte 2002, p. 1. Ministerio de Cultura y Deportes. #215.&lt;/ref&gt; It is approximately {{convert|90|km|mi}} west of the town of Poptún, and {{convert|80|km|mi}} southeast of [[Sayaxché]].&lt;ref&gt;ITMB 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Machaquila is situated on the banks of the lower [[Machaquila River]], which is a major tributary of the [[Pasión River]].&lt;ref&gt;Fahsen 1984, p. 94. Laporte, Mejía and Chocón 2005, p. 401.&lt;/ref&gt; The site is in a relatively isolated region.&lt;ref&gt;Just 2007, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Classic period, the city's location would have placed it upon a [[trade in Maya civilization|trade route]] running from the [[Maya Mountains]] in the east to the Pasión River in the west, and ultimately to the [[Usumacinta River]].&lt;ref name="ChocónLaporte02p1"&gt;Chocón and Laporte 2002, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Machaquila is {{convert|30|km|mi}} southeast of the contemporary Maya site of [[Seibal]].&lt;ref name="LaporteMejíaChocón05p400"&gt;Laporte, Mejía and Chocón 2005, p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site core containing the city's monumental architecture is protected, but under threat from occupation by landless peasants. The surrounding area, where the majority of the residential architecture is located, falls within privately owned farmland.&lt;ref name="CiudadRuiz&amp;c2003p260"/&gt;

==Polity==
Machaquila shared a pared [[Maya script#Emblem glyphs|Emblem Glyph]] with Cancuen, probably suggesting some form of joint rule and participation in a larger polity that included both cities.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; A proposal that Machaquila, Cancuen, and [[Tres Islas]] participated in a form of government that involved the transference of the status of capital from one city to the next has not been universally accepted.&lt;ref name="LaporteMejíaChocón05p400"/&gt;

==History==
Machaquila flourished in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late to Terminal Classic]] periods,&lt;ref name="Fahsen84p94"&gt;Fahsen 1984, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; reaching the height of its power in approximately the ninth century.&lt;ref&gt;Just 2007, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise in activity at Machaquila appears to have been a side effect of the collapse  of the power of [[Dos Pilas]] over the Petexbatún kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, archaeologists announced that they had uncovered a hieroglyphic panel at Cancuen that depicts [[Tajal Chan Ahk]], the 8th-century king of that city. The [[high relief]] sculpture shows him installing subordinate rulers at Machaquila.&lt;ref&gt;Markey 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
The site was excavated in the early 21st century by the Atlas Arqueológico de Guatemala in collaboration with the [[Universidad Complutense de Madrid]].&lt;ref name="CiudadRuiz&amp;c2003p260"&gt;Ciudad Ruiz et al 2003, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site description==
The principal architecture at Machaquila has been dated to the Late Classic period, and includes temples and palace complexes. By 1984, nineteen stelae had been found at the site.&lt;ref name="Fahsen84p94"/&gt; Machaquila is unusual in the local region in lacking both an [[E-Group]] astronomical complex, and a [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]], which are both architectural arrangements that are often found in neighbouring cities.&lt;ref&gt;Laporte, Mejía and Chocón 2005, p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt; Machaquila is not particularly notable for its architecture or size, rather for its abundant sculpted monuments.&lt;ref name="LaporteMejíaChocón05p406"&gt;Laporte, Mejía and Chocón 2005, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plaza A===
This architectural group is a ceremonial complex that includes various [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramids]] (Structures 16 to 20, and 22). Stelae and altars are associated with each of the pyramids. The investigating archaeologists also assume that this complex includes the tombs of city's rulers. The group was closed off from the rest of the city by Structure 45, which was probably residential in nature.&lt;ref name="CiudadRuiz&amp;c2003p261"&gt;Ciudad Ruiz et al 2003, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plaza C===
This complex is the largest group at Machaquila, and had a primarily residential function.&lt;ref name="CiudadRuiz&amp;c2003p261"/&gt;

==Monuments==
Although many sculpted monuments were noted when the site was discovered, none remain at Machaquila. A few were moved in order to protect them, but the majority were looted and their whereabouts is unknown. Sculpted monuments from Machaquila included 18 stelae and 6 altars, and a series of sculpted blocks.&lt;ref name="LaporteMejíaChocón05p406"/&gt; Those stelae that were rescued are now in the [[Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología|Museo Nacional de Arqueología]] in [[Guatemala City]]. The remaining monuments at the site include broken stela butts, and featureless stelae where the sculpted portions have been cut away by looters.&lt;ref name="CiudadRuiz&amp;c2003p261"/&gt;

'''Malefic Time''' is a visual project created by Spanish artists [[Luis Royo]] and [[Romulo Royo]]. It is set in a post apocalyptic world that mixes reality led to the decay of the society with real manifestations of mythological beliefs and superstitions of different cultures.

The main plot is presented in a trilogy of graphic novels with illustration made by both artists. The protagonist Luz travels through the universe of Malefic Time and meets different people, allies, enemies and their way of surviving in this broken world.

The project has been carried to other media (comics, novels, RPG, music, shorts) that much develop  different aspects of the universe expanding and making it deeper.

==Fictional setting==
Malefic Time is a fantasy universe where humanity is not alone in creation: there are other creatures, called in many ways over the years, now known as [[Angel|Celestials]] and [[Fallen angel|Fallen]].

These creatures of immense power have been influencing, manipulating us and waging a war in which each side tries to crush the other. In 2019 the world began to sink: social structures crumbled, the world economy disappeared and riots began due to a disease that began to spread worldwide. It was then in 2020 when Celestials and The Fallen showed openly to the world.

This is 2033, and everyone has in mind that it is the end of an era. According to astrology the [[Age of Aquarius]] comes, a shift to inward development of individuals and the rejection of imposed laws that will strongly influence human behavior.

== Plot summary ==

=== Luz – Malefic ===

She is presented for the first time on the cover of the illustrated book with the same title more than 20 years ago. But it is not until in 2010 when [[Luis Royo]] and [[Romulo Royo]] retake the character, her story is told and the “Malefic Time” project is founded. Malefic is the protagonist, all the plot consists of her development and in the search for her identity.

Her real name is Luz. She moves through [[New York City]] looking for libraries and museums, she knows that there, in the old books and ancient paintings are all the keys to understand this new world and to find out who she is.

In the dilapidated warehouse where she lives there are hundreds of books and papers that she brings from her walks through the city libraries, all of them with apocalyptic themes, [[Romanesque art|Romanesque paintings]] books, [[Freemasonry|books of Masons]], [[witchcraft]], [[alchemy]], notes of prophets and seers, oriental writings, [[Aztec]] and [[Culture of Africa|African]] art, reproductions of paintings from ancient times, [[Greek mythology]] or [[Egyptian hieroglyphics]] studies. All part of a puzzle about the [[final judgment]].

The search for identity, answer her questions, the cracks and falls are what determine her. It is a broken character built on the [[Bipolar disorder|bipolarity]] between her power, determination, great resolute and combat skills, and her apparent role in the future destiny against the huge fragility supposed by the doubts, questions, and frequent states of obsession, disease, collapse and trance. She is a charismatic character with multiple layers that make her an atypical heroine/anti-heroine through which the deep folds and nuances of the story are known.

The course of his journey is from [[New York City]] to [[Tokyo]] and [[Paris]]. On a trip of spiritual quest. A road full of [[mysticism]] and forbidden topics by the current culture. A symbol of change for the man. An uprising against the oppression of the laws and regulations that govern the world.

=== Celestials and The Fallen ===

These beings have the easy association with the [[Angels]] and [[Demons]] in the [[Judeo-Christian | Judeo-Christian biblical tradition]] in appearance but are much more. They have been the origin of all gods for all cultures, they changed names throughout history, but their conflict and their intervention goes back to the earliest days of mankind. The first indications of their existence are dated back in the [[Sumerian mythology]] (cradle of human civilization) and then extends, altered, contaminated, adapted to all forms of religion in the ancient Mediterranean and soon after to other societies of the world.

The initial conflict, represented biblically with [[Lucifer|angel Lucifer's]] rebellion against [[God]] establishes an unbridgeable rift between these two positions that have continued settling their disputes over human existence. Both positions represent two diametrical ways of understanding existence with the following association, among others, these inherent values:

*Celestials: The Sun, the masculine, the Authority, order, the standard, foreign, Age of Pisces.
*The Fallen: The Moon, the Feminine, Nature, Spirituality, instinct, the inside, Age of Aquarius.

== Adaptations ==

[[File:Codex Bruchsal 1 01v cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Christ in Majesty]] shown within a mandorla shape in a medieval [[illuminated manuscript]].]]
A '''mandorla''' is an [[aureola]], or frame, usually in the shape of a [[vesica piscis]], which surrounds the figures of Christ and the Virgin Mary in traditional Christian art.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Liungman

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinguished from a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] in that it encircles the entire body, and not just the head. It is commonly used to frame the figure of [[Christ in Majesty]] in early medieval and [[Romanesque art]], as well as [[Byzantine art]] of the same periods.  

==Depictions==
The term ''mandorla'', from the [[Italian language]] name for the "[[almond]]" nut, refers to the usual shape. Sometimes  however, especially in earlier depictions, the mandorla takes circular or elliptical forms. Sometimes, also usually in earlier forms, the mandorla is shown as the intersection of two circles. [[Rhombus|Rhombic]] mandorlas are also sometimes seen.

In [[icon]]s of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the mandorla is used to depict sacred moments which transcend time and space, such as the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] and the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]] of Christ and the [[Dormition of the Theotokos]]. These mandorla will often be painted in several concentric patterns of color which grow darker as they come close to the center. This is in keeping with the church's use of [[apophatic theology]], as described by [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Dionysius the Areopagite]] and others. As holiness increases, there is no way to depict its brightness except by darkness.

In architectural iconography, the frame of the mandorla is often marked with [[Molding (decorative)|decorative mouldings]]. The interior of the mandorla is usually undecorated, but may contain the symbols [[Alpha and Omega|Α and Ω]] or, less frequently, depictions of a starry sky or clouds.

In a famous romanesque fresco of Christ in Glory at [[Sant Climent de Taüll]], the inscription ''Ego Sum Lux Mundi'' ("I Am the Light of the World") is incorporated in the mandorla design.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xtec.es/~jarrimad/medieval/romanico/taull.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] at [[Conques]] has Christ, with a gesture carved in [[romanesque sculpture]], indicate the angels at his feet bearing candlesticks. Six surrounding stars, resembling blossoming flowers, indicate the known planets including the [[Moon]]. Here the symbolism implies Christ as the [[Sun God|Sun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handinaute.org/roman.img/Conques02.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007071716/http://www.handinaute.org/roman.img/Conques02.jpg |archivedate=2007-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one special case, at Cervon ([[Nièvre]]), Christ is seated surrounded by eight stars, resembling blossoming flowers.&lt;ref&gt;http://homepage.uvt.nl/~s239062/EDIFICES/cervon/CERVONtim.JPG{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; At Conques the flowers are six-petalled. At Cervon, where the almond motif is repeated in the rim of the mandorla, they are five-petalled, as are almond flowers—the first flowers to appear at the end of winter, even before the leaves of the almond tree. The symbolism of the nine-branched [[Chanukkiyah]] candelabrum may be relevant. In the 12th century a great school of [[Judaism|Judaic]] thought radiated from [[Narbonne]], coinciding with the origins of the [[Kabbalah]].&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;{{cite book |last=Scholem |first=Gershom |authorlink=Gershom Scholem |title=Origins of the Kabbalah |publisher=Princeton Paperback |year=1990 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dRi8v-j7OMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q |isbn=0-691-07314-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, at Cervon the eight star/flower only is six petalled: the Root of David, the Morningstar, mentioned at the close of [[Book of Revelation]] (22:16).&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20160808231625/http://www.romanes.com/Cervon/Saint_Barthelemy_de_Cervon_0011.html&lt;/ref&gt; (In one of the oldest manuscripts of the complete [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[Leningrad Codex]], one finds the [[Star of David]] imbedded in an octagon.)

In the symbolism of [[Hildegard of Bingen]] the mandorla refers to the [[Cosmos]].&lt;ref name="ref6"&gt;{{cite book

==History and Characteristics==
[[File:Temple Miruksa.jpg|thumb|left|200x200px|Temple Miruksa]]

In 639, the site of [[Mireuksa]] was built during the late [[Baekje]]. It is the oldest and largest remaining stone pagoda in Korea. It is an important cultural property that faithfully shows the process of transition from wooden tower to stone pagoda.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rinks.aks.ac.kr/search01.aspx?searchExtend=0&amp;searchDir=0&amp;sType=&amp;section=&amp;page=&amp;rowNum=10&amp;filterList=&amp;total=1087&amp;behavior=&amp;disSearchWord=%ED%98%B8%EC%A1%B1&amp;query=%EB%AF%B8%EB%A5%B5%EC%82%AC%EC%A7%80+%EC%84%9D%ED%83%91|title=미륵사지 석탑|last=|first=|date=|website=rinks.aks.ac.kr|language=ko|trans-title=Mireuksaji Stone Pagoda|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This stone pagoda is called the primitive style of Baekje Stone Pagoda. In many ways, it is considered to be the starting point of the whole Korean pagoda. 
This stone pagoda with [[granite]] is unlike the Silla style pagoda of Silla style pagoda. It is a pile of multi-storied pagoda of three sides in the base of a square partitioned by a gravel stone.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Most of the western side and the southern side, and about half of the northern side are collapsed, and the number of floors is only up to 6th floor. Currently, maintenance and maintenance are in progress.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://media.daum.net/society/others/newsview?newsid=20131121104310067|title=The stone pagoda of Mireuksaji Iksan which is reborn ... 26 days Restoration start ceremony|last=kim|first=dong-chul|date=|work=Yonhap News|access-date=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restoration of the Mireuksa Temple was completed in 1991 under the supervision of the Cultural Properties Bureau at the time of the Roh Tae Woo administration. It was once claimed to be on the 7th floor, but during the restoration, a supplementary material was found to indicate that the tower was a 9th floor.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;



== Structure ==
The stone pagoda of Mireuksaji was the lower one as the wooden pagoda. The top of the temple was divided into three spaces on each side of the first floor, and a door was made in the middle of the room. Inside the center is a huge square pillar. On the first floor, four corners of the body were erected. It is followed by a double-sided technique of wooden architecture with a narrow top and bottom and a convex center. On the pillars, it was also installed in the shape of square and spear, which is the material that connects pillars and pillars in wooden architecture. The roof slope is thin and wide, and it is raised up to four corners and raised slightly.

==Restoration==
In 1915, it was repaired with cement to prevent the collapse of the tower during [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial period.]] However, in April 1994, the government decided to repair the damaged part because it was not beautiful and there was a risk of collapse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2018/06/20/0200000000AKR20180620044051005.HTML|title=콘크리트 걷어낸 익산 미륵사지 석탑, 20년 대역사 마무리(종합)|last=송고|first=시간|date=2018-06-20|work=yonhapnews|access-date=|trans-title=Ik-san Mireuksaji Stone Pagoda, which has been made of concrete, finished in 20 years}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[North Jeolla Province|Jeollabuk-do]] completed the basic process from 1998 to 2000, with the preparation for the repair of the Mireuksaji stone pagoda. Since October 2001, the National Institute of Cultural Properties has begun full-scale maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.sbs.co.kr/news/endPage.do?news_id=N1004811697|title=미륵사지 석탑, 20년 만에 '일제 땜질' 벗었다…웅장한 모습|last=김진형|first=|date=2018-06-20|work=SBS|access-date=|trans-title=Mileuksajji stone tower, 20 years after the 'tile soldering' took off ...

The repair work for Mireuksaji stone pagoda was planned to be completed in 2007. However, due to the fact that it is the largest stone pagoda in East Asia and it is a national treasure, the schedule was delayed and delayed until 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailian.co.kr/news/view/117803|title=&lt;현장클릭&gt; 익산 미륵사지석탑 보수 162일간의 현장 석탑해체 공정 80% 진행 중|last=|first=|date=2008-07-10|work=dailyan|access-date=|trans-title=Repaired Stone Pagoda in Iksan Mireuk Temple Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The Cultural Heritage Administration will restore the first and second floors completely symmetrically, and restructure the third and sixth floors before the dismantling. Members of local governments and some experts argue that the tower must be fully symmetrically restored to the fifth floor to prevent its retention and collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jjan.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=531321|title="미륵사지 석탑 비대칭 복원 문제 있다"|last=김|first=진만|date=2014-11-24|work=Jeonbuk Daily|access-date=|trans-title="There is an asymmetrical restoration of the Stone Pagoda of Mireuk Temple Site"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://v.media.daum.net/v/20150528215721124|title=완전 복원이냐, 부분 복원이냐..'미륵사지 석탑' 시끌|last=정|first=진명|date=2015-05-28|work=jtbc|access-date=|trans-title=The stone pagoda of Mireuk Temple Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Excavation ==
[[File:Mireuksa-writing.jpg|thumb|Mireuksa-writing]]
On January 14, 2009, the National Cultural Properties Research Institute of the Cultural Heritage Administration rehabilitated and restored the stone pagoda of Mireuksa Temple in Iksan. At that time, he found a martial art in the center of the upper surface of the pillar, named Sarijangum(舍利莊嚴).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.joins.com/article/22731717|title=백제의 유산 익산 미륵사지 석탑, 20년 만에 수리 마쳤다|last=이|first=은주|date=2018-06-20|work=jtbc|access-date=|trans-title=The heritage of Baekjae was completed in 20 years after the stone pagoda of Mireuksa Temple in Iksan}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

They found a small bottle with a height of 13cm and a shoulder width of 7.7cm. As a result of inspecting the inside with [[X-ray]], it was confirmed that it is composed of a double structure of inner and outer box. The variety of patterns and handwork techniques on the surface of Sariho show the excellence of Baekje Metal Craft.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

They also found the golden Sari-bonganki. The Sari-bonganki was engraved on the gold plate of 15.5cm in width and 10.5cm in height and painted red to make it clearly visible. It is written that Queen Baekje donated riches and founded a temple and prayed for the good of the royal family by sealing the Sari in the year of 639. It is evaluated as a precious stone statue material which can complement the lack of research of literature by precisely establishing the purpose of the founding of Mireuksa, It was more notable that there was a difference from the record of [[Samguk yusa|Samguk-Yusa]], in which the Queen was recorded as the daughter of "Sa", one of the eight nobles of Baekje, and that Princess Sunwha had created Mireuksa Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=103&amp;oid=003&amp;aid=0002484739|title=미륵사 석탑속에 유물 잔뜩‥"백제지역 최대 고고학적 성과"|last=이|first=민정|date=2009-01-19|work=newsis|access-date=|trans-title=The Stone Pagoda of Mireuk Temple is filled with relics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''Morgan Holmes''' is a Canadian sociologist, author, and a professor at [[Wilfrid Laurier University]], [[Ontario]]. She is also an [[Intersex human rights|intersex]] activist and writer, and former member of [[Intersex Society of North America]]. Holmes participated in the first public demonstration by intersex people, now marked by [[Intersex Awareness Day]].

== Early life ==
Holmes underwent a clitorectomy, described as a "clitoral recession", at age 7, at [[The Hospital for Sick Children]] in [[Toronto]]. This surgery was undertaken because her clitoris "could become erect", and the surgery has affected her life ever since, including repeated pelvic exams, adolescent sexual experiences, fear of intimacy, and feelings of difference and embarrassment. Holmes describes how clinician "promises of sexual normalcy are not being met" by surgical intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Morgan |last=Holmes |url=http://www.isna.org/node/743 |title=Is Growing up in Silence Better Than Growing up Different? |work=Chrysalis Special Issue on Intersexuality |publisher=[[Intersex Society of North America]] |date=May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Francine |last=Kopun |url=https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2010/04/30/neither_male_nor_female_the_secret_life_of_intersex_people.html |title=Neither male nor female: The secret life of intersex people |work=[[Toronto Star]] |date=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holmes refers to herself as "still intersexual" after medical intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alice Domurat |last=Dreger |title=Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex |authorlink=Alice Dreger |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=2009 |page=254 |isbn=9780674034334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

=== Activism ===
A member of the (now defunct) [[Intersex Society of North America]], Holmes participated with [[Max Beck]] and others in the first North American demonstration about intersex issues, a 1996 demonstration as ''Hermaphrodites with Attitude'' outside the Annual Meeting of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] in Boston.&lt;ref name="boston" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.isna.org/books/chrysalis/beck | title = Hermaphrodites with Attitude Take to the Streets | work = [[Intersex Society of North America]] | date = October 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is now commemorated internationally as [[Intersex Awareness Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intersexday.org/en/origin-intersex-awareness-day/ |title=The origins of Intersex Awareness Day |last1=Driver |first1=Betsy |date=14 October 2015 |website=Intersex Day |publisher= |access-date=2015-10-24 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Star Online 1"&gt;{{cite web | title = The 14 days of intersex | publisher = [[Star Observer]] | url = http://www.starobserver.com.au/opinion/2011/10/25/the-14-days-of-intersex/64300 | accessdate = 11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She participated in the second [[International Intersex Forum]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="rho"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rainbowhealthontario.ca/events.cfm?fuseaction=events.PublicEventDetails&amp;calendarEventID=54e29c71-fbc3-6784-49c7-cb4d31638375 | title = Argentinian Film XXY with guest speaker Morgan Holmes | work = Rainbow Health Ontario | date = 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235835/http://www.rainbowhealthontario.ca/events.cfm?fuseaction=events.PublicEventDetails&amp;calendarEventID=54e29c71-fbc3-6784-49c7-cb4d31638375 | archivedate = 2013-12-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academia ===
Holmes is a professor of sociology at [[Wilfrid Laurier University]], Ontario, where she describes her academic interests as sexuality and queer theory, feminist thought; qualitative health research and law related to sexuality and health. Holmes has also extended her interest in intersex issues to other forms of bodily diversity, including disability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20140606172230/http://www.wlu.ca/homepage.php?grp_id=891&amp;f_id=35 Dr. Morgan Holmes], Laurier Faculty of Arts&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
Holmes is widely published, including works that link intersex to queer theory and ideas of compulsory heterosexuality. In ''Re-membering a Queer Body''' (1994), Holmes describes how surgery on intersex infants is undertaken to make bodies conform to heterosexual norms: 
{{quotation|when a genetically male child (XY) is considered incapable of achieving "normal" heterosexual activity as a male, he will be reassigned as female even though the micropenis would be functional ... if one ''is'' born with a vagina, the appropriate sexual activity will be as receptor and not penetrator. Thus, when a body which has been designated female (either through chromosome testing or anatomical standards) possesses a phallus, the surgical procedure remains roughly the same as that for treating the micropenis: remove the phalloclit in a process of either partial or total clitorectomy.)}}

Holmes also problematizes this link, and in particular concepts of intersex as a [[third sex]]. In ''Locating Third Sexes'' (2004), Holmes argues that: 
{{quotation|much of the existing work on cultural systems that incorporate a "third sex" portray simplistic visions in which societies with more than two sex/gender categories are cast as superior to those that divide the world into just two. I argue that to understand whether a system is more or less oppressive than another we have to understand how it treats its various members, not only its "thirds".}}

Holmes also links the medical treatment of intersex bodies to the medical treatment of disabled bodies. In ''Rethinking the Meaning and Management of Intersexuality'' (2002), she argues that the surgical normalization of intersex infants is neither enhancement nor treatment. In ''Distracted Attentions: Intersexuality and Human Rights Protections'' (2005), she discusses the conceptualization of an intersex birth as an emergency, negating requirement for informed consent. In ''Mind the Gaps: Intersex and (Re-productive) Spaces in Disability Studies and Bioethics'' (June 2008) she argues that, while clinicians presume that "intersex characteristics are inherently disabling to social viability", recognition of the personhood of the intersex child necessitates refraining from "aggressive interference". The research notes trends to selectively terminate intersex fetuses.

In her book ''Intersex: A Perilous Difference'' (2008) Holmes argues that there is a duty to understand the stakes involved in conflating what is supposedly 'natural' with what is statistically 'normal', and of what is 'normal' with what is 'healthy'." Holmes reviews medical literature and popular culture to examine how society constructs monstrosity. She "singles out" the novel [[Middlesex (novel)|Middlesex]] by [[Jeffrey Eugenides]], "and episodes of The X-Files for constructing intersex characters whose lives essentially reproduce the social fascination with the monstrous and the deviant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dailyxtra.com/canada/news/book-review-intersex-morgan-holmes | title = Book review: Intersex by Morgan Holmes | first = Robert | last = Teixeira | work = [[Xtra!|Daily Xtra]] | date = October 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Intersex Enchiridion: Naming and Knowledge in the Clinic'' (2011), Holmes argues that the replacement of the word "intersex" with "[[disorders of sex development]]" in clinical settings "reinstitutionalises clinical power to delineate and silence those marked by the diagnosis" and "that this silencing is precisely the point of the new terminology."

In 2009, Holmes edited ''Critical Intersex'', a collection of essays on intersex issues, including theoretical and empirical research. The book has been described as "an important book" ([[Anne Fausto-Sterling]]), "the 'go to source' for a contemporary, international representation of intersex studies,"&lt;ref name="rho" /&gt; making "contributions that are precise, plainly written and very illuminating... the detail is fascinating and somewhat unnerving... beautifully clear and compassionate" (''[[Contemporary Sociology]]''), and "an important collection" (Suzanne Kessler, [[State University of New York]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Holmes has also written on her experience as an activist, including during her membership in the [[Intersex Society of North America]]. The essay ''When Max Beck and Morgan Holmes went to Boston'', provides an account of the participation by Holmes in the first public demonstration by intersex people, on October 26, 1996, an event that took place following the activists' exclusion from a clinical conference. The demonstration is now marked by [[Intersex Awareness Day]]&lt;ref name="boston"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intersexday.org/en/max-beck-morgan-holmes-boston-1996/ |title=When Max Beck and Morgan Holmes went to Boston |last=Holmes |first=Morgan |author-link= Morgan Holmes |date=17 October 2015 |website=Intersex Day |publisher= |access-date=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Munhata''' ('''Horvat Minha''' or '''Khirbet Munhata''') is an [[archaeology|archaeological]] site {{convert|11|km|mi}} south of [[Lake Tiberias]], [[Israel]] on the north bank and near the outlet of [[Nahal Tavor]] (Tabor Stream) on a terrace {{convert|215|m|ft}} below sea level.&lt;ref name="MeyersResearch1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric M. Meyers|author2=American Schools of Oriental Research|title=The Oxford encyclopedia of archaeology in the Near East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KYzrAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=25 April 2011|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excavations==
The area of {{convert|2000|m2|ft2}} in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] was first excavated in 1962 by [[Jean Perrot]]. The deposits on site were {{convert|3|m|ft}} deep and divided up into six distinct layers of occupation. These have been divided into [[PPNB]] aceramic during levels six to three, with later [[Neolithic]] and [[Chalcolithic]], [[Yarmukian Culture|Yarmukian]] and Wadi Rabah cultures in levels two and one.

==Construction==
Buildings in the earlier stages had stone, paved or plastered floors made of mud bricks on stone foundations with remains of hearths and other stone structures. The north walls of buildings contained a plastered niche, a feature found in a similar room in [[Jericho]].&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt; The [[PPNB]] levels also revealed an unusual circular [[courtyard]] structure with rooms radiating out from it and a large platform with channels cut in it associated with a pebble lined trough, presumably used for craft purposes.&lt;ref name="PeregrineEmber2002"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor1-first=Peter Neal|editor1-last=Peregrine|editor1-link=Peter N. Peregrine|editor2-first=Melvin|editor2-last=Ember|editor2-link=Melvin Ember|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Prehistory|volume=8 : South and Southwest Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C-TQpUtI-dgC&amp;pg=PA52|accessdate=25 April 2011|year=2002|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-306-46262-7|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yarmoukian phase continued with round buildings which developed into rectangular ones in the Rabah phase.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=A.M.T.|title=The Neolithic of the Levant|publisher=Oxford University, Unpublished Ph.D. Thesis|year=1978|pages=176–178|url=http://ancientneareast.tripod.com/109.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major break in settlement was detected between levels three and two, where the early levels were covered over with sandy soil.

==Culture==
Various flint tools and arrowheads were recovered from the site. Arrowheads had distinctive tangs (some barbed) with wings and pointed shoulders, some were diamond or leaf shaped and a few were notched. Finely denticulated [[sickle]] blades were found in large numbers with other tools including end scrapers, blades, burins and borers. One piece of [[obsidian]] was found in level six that originated from the same place as a piece from [[El Khiam]]. Grinding tools were also found including [[pestle and mortar]]s of basalt or limestone, polishers, rubbers and grooved stones. [[Stoneware]] vessels were found along with a few greenstone beads.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt; The site was also notable for finds of clay figurines of males, females and animals.

==Dating==
[[Radio-carbon dating]] of the site had large stated errors due to problematic dating materials but gave dates between ca. 7210 and 5420 [[Before Christ|BC]]. These provide a vague suggestion of the age of the site. [[Typology (archaeology)|Typological]] comparisons have been made of various artifacts highlighting a certain regional variation with more elaborate design arrowheads and less pressure flaking. This equates generally with the PPNB stages of Jericho and [[Beidha]] suggesting that occupations overlapped with these sites and a date of occupation during the middle and late 7th millennium BC.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;

==Introduction==
"Neurotheology" is a [[neologism]] that describes the scientific study of the neural correlates of religious or spiritual beliefs, experiences and practices. Other researchers prefer to use terms like "spiritual neuroscience" or "neuroscience of religion". Researchers in the field attempt to explain the neurological basis for religious experiences, such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert A. |last=Burton |authorlink=Robert A.

==Terminology==
[[Aldous Huxley]] used the term ''neurotheology'' for the first time in the utopian novel ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]''. The discipline studies the cognitive neuroscience of [[religious experience]] and spirituality. The term is also sometimes used in a less [[science|scientific]] context or a philosophical context. Some of these uses, according to the mainstream scientific community, qualify as [[pseudoscience]]. Huxley used it mainly in a philosophical context.

The use of the term neurotheology in published scientific work is currently uncommon. A search on the citation indexing service provided by [[Institute for Scientific Information]] returns five articles. Three of these are published in the journal ''[[Zygon (journal)|Zygon: Journal of Religion &amp; Science]]'', while two are published in ''American Behavioral Scientist''. Work on the neural basis of spirituality has, however, occurred sporadically throughout the 20th century.

==Theoretical work==
In an attempt to focus and clarify what was a growing interest in this field, in 1994 educator and businessman Laurence O. McKinney published the first book on the subject, titled "Neurotheology: Virtual Religion in the 21st Century", written for a popular audience but also promoted in the theological journal ''Zygon''.&lt;ref name=McKinney&gt;{{cite book|author=Laurence O. McKinney |title= Neurotheology: Virtual Religion in the 21st Century |year=1994 |publisher=[[American Institute for Mindfulness]] |isbn=978-0-945724-01-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to McKinney, neurotheology sources the basis of religious inquiry in relatively recent developmental neurophysiology. According to McKinney's theory, pre-frontal development, in humans, creates an illusion of chronological time as a fundamental part of normal adult cognition past the age of three. The inability of the adult brain to retrieve earlier images experienced by an infantile brain creates questions such as "where did I come from" and "where does it all go", which McKinney suggests led to the creation of various religious explanations. The experience of death as a peaceful regression into timelessness as the brain dies won praise from readers as varied as author [[Arthur C. Clarke]], eminent theologian [[Harvey Cox]], and the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] and sparked a new interest in the field. {{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

What [[Andrew B. Newberg]] and others "discovered is that intensely focused [[meditation|spiritual contemplation]] triggers an alteration in the activity of the brain that leads one to perceive transcendent religious experiences as solid, tangible reality. In other words, the sensation that [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] call ''oneness with the universe''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Newberg, Andrew B. |authorlink=Andrew B. Newberg |author2=D'Aquili, Eugene G. |author2-link=Eugene G. d'Aquili |author3=Rause, Vince |title=Why God Won't Go Away. Brain Science and the Biology of Belief |url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:www.andrewnewberg.com/books/why-god-wont-go-away-brain-science-the-biology-of-belief+%22discovered+was+that+intensely+focused+spiritual+contemplation+triggers+an+alteration+in+the+activity+of+the+brain+that+leads+one+to+perceive+transcendent+religious+experiences+as+solid,+tangible+reality.+In+other+words,+the+sensation+that+Buddhists+call%22%22oneness+with+the+universe%22 |publisher=[[Ballantine Books]] |location=New York City |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-345-44034-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[orientation (mental)|orientation]] area requires sensory input to do its calculus. "If you block sensory inputs to this region, as you do during the intense concentration of meditation, you prevent the brain from forming the distinction between [[self]] and not-self," says Newberg. With no information from the senses arriving, the left orientation area cannot find any boundary between the self and the world. As a result, the brain seems to have no choice but "to perceive the self as endless and intimately interwoven with everyone and everything." "The right orientation area, equally bereft of sensory data, defaults to a feeling of infinite space. The meditators feel that they have touched infinity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Begley |first=Sharon |authorlink=Sharon Begley |title=Religion And The Brain |url=http://www.newsweek.com/religion-and-brain-152895 |work=[[Newsweek]] |publisher=[[Newsweek Media Group]] |location=New York City |date=May 6, 2001 |accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The radical Catholic theologian [[Eugen Drewermann]] developed a two-volume critique of traditional conceptions of [[God]] and the [[soul]] and a reinterpretation of religion (Modern Neurology and the Question of God) based on current neuroscientific research.&lt;ref name=Drewermann&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite book |last=Drewermann |first=Eugen |authorlink=Eugen Drewermann |title=Atem des Lebens: Die moderne Neurologie und die Frage nach Gott.

(Vol. 2)|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it has also been argued "that neurotheology should be conceived and practiced within a theological framework."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Apfalter |first=Wilfried |date=May 2009 |title=Neurotheology: What Can We Expect from a (Future) Catholic Version? |journal=[[Theology and Science]] |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=163–174 |doi=10.1080/14746700902796528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it has been suggested that creating a separate category for this kind of research is moot since conventional Behavioural and Social Neurosciences disciplines can handle any empirical investigation of this nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://antiageing.astronrill.com/neurotheology.html |title="Neurotheology": A semantic trap set by pseudo-science for the unwary scientist |publisher=Dr Milind Ovalekar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various theories regarding the [[evolutionary origin of religion]] and the [[evolutionary psychology of religion]] have been proposed.

==Experimental work==
In 1969, British biologist [[Alister Hardy]] founded a Religious Experience Research Centre at Oxford after retiring from his post as Linacre Professor of Zoology. Citing [[William James]]'s ''The Varieties of Religious Experience'' (1902), he set out to collect first-hand accounts of [[numinous]] experiences.  He was awarded the [[Templeton Prize]] before his death in 1985. His successor David Hay suggested in ''God’s Biologist: A life of Alister Hardy'' (2011) that the RERC later dispersed as investigators turned to newer techniques of scientific investigation.

===Magnetic stimulation studies===
{{main article|God helmet}}
During the 1980s [[Michael Persinger]] stimulated the [[temporal lobes]] of human subjects with a weak [[magnetic field]] using an apparatus that popularly became known as the "[[God helmet]]"&lt;ref name=PMID_6664802&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Persinger |first1 = M A |title = Religious and mystical experiences as artifacts of temporal lobe function: a general hypothesis. |journal = Perceptual and Motor Skills |pmid = 6664802 |pages = 1255–62 |issue = 3 Pt 2 |volume = 57 |year = 1983 |doi=10.2466/pms.1983.57.3f.1255}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reported that many of his subjects claimed to experience a "sensed presence" during stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Sensed Presence Within Experimental Settings: Implications for the Male and Female Concept of Self | author=Persinger, MA | journal=The Journal of Psychology: Interdisciplinary and Applied | year=2003 | volume=137 | issue=1 | pages=5–16 | doi=10.1080/00223980309600595| pmid=12661700 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This work has been [[Scientific criticism|criticised]],&lt;ref name=AaenStockdale/&gt;&lt;ref name=Granqvist&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Granqvist |first1=P |last2=Fredrikson |first2=M |last3=Unge |first3=P |last4=Hagenfeldt |first4=A |last5=Valind |first5=S |last6=Larhammar |first6=D |last7=Larsson |first7=M |title=Sensed presence and mystical experiences are predicted by suggestibility, not by the application of transcranial weak complex magnetic fields |journal=Neuroscience Letters |volume=379 |issue=1 |pages=1–6 |year=2005 |pmid=15849873 |doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2004.10.057 |laysummary=http://www.bioedonline.org/news/news.cfm?art=1424 |laysource=BioEd Online |laydate=December 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Larsson&gt;{{Cite journal | journal=Neuroscience Letters | volume=380 | issue=3 | year=2005 | pages=348–350 | doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2005.03.059 | title=Reply to M.A. Persinger and S.

Granqvist ''et al.'' claimed that Persinger's work was not "[[blind experiment#Double-blind trials|double-blind]]." Participants were often [[graduate student]]s who knew what sort of results to expect, and there was the risk that the [[experimenter bias|experimenters' expectations]] would be transmitted to subjects by unconscious cues. The participants were frequently given an idea of the purpose of the study by being asked to fill in questionnaires designed to test their suggestibility to [[paranormal]] experiences before the trials were conducted. Granqvist ''et al.'' failed to [[replication (scientific method)|replicate]] Persinger's experiments double-blinded, and concluded that the presence or absence of the magnetic field had no relationship with any [[religious experience|religious or spiritual experience]] reported by the participants, but was predicted entirely by their suggestibility and personality traits. Following the publication of this study, Persinger ''et al.'' dispute this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Persinger, Michael| title=A response to Granqvist et al.

===Neuropsychology and neuroimaging===
The first researcher to note and catalog the abnormal experiences associated with [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] (TLE) was neurologist [[Norman Geschwind]], who noted a set of religious behavioral traits associated with TLE seizures.&lt;ref name=WaxmanGeschwind&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Arch Gen Psychiatry | year=1975 | volume=32 | issue=12 | pages=1580–6 | title=The interictal behavior syndrome of temporal lobe epilepsy. |vauthors=Waxman SG, Geschwind N | pmid=1200777 | doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1975.01760300118011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include [[hypergraphia]], [[hyperreligiosity]], [[Hypoactive sexual desire disorder|reduced sexual interest]], [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting spells]], and [[pedantic|pedantism]], often collectively ascribed to a condition known as [[Geschwind syndrome]].

[[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran]] explored the neural basis of the hyperreligiosity seen in TLE using the [[galvanic skin response]] (GSR), which correlates with emotional arousal, to determine whether the hyperreligiosity seen in TLE was due to an overall heightened emotional state or was specific to religious stimuli. Ramachandran presented two subjects with neutral, sexually arousing and religious words while measuring GSR. Ramachandran was able to show that patients with TLE showed enhanced emotional responses to the religious words, diminished responses to the sexually charged words, and normal responses to the neutral words. This study was presented as an abstract at a neuroscience conference and referenced in Ramachandran's book, ''[[Phantoms in the Brain]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Ramachandran, V. | author2=Blakeslee | last-author-amp=yes | year=1998 | title=Phantoms in the Brain| title-link=Phantoms in the Brain }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it has never been published in the [[peer-review]]ed scientific press.

Research by Mario Beauregard at the [[University of Montreal]], using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] on [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] nuns, has purported to show that religious and spiritual experiences include several brain regions and not a single 'God spot'. As Beauregard has said, "There is no God spot in the brain. Spiritual experiences are complex, like intense experiences with other human beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.harpercollins.com/author/authorExtra.aspx?authorID=30251&amp;displayType=interview |title=Harper Collins Publishers Author Interview with mario Beauregard |publisher=HarperCollins.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The neuroimaging was conducted when the nuns were asked to ''recall'' past mystical states, not while actually undergoing them; "subjects were asked to remember and relive (eyes closed) the most intense mystical experience ever felt in their lives as a member of the Carmelite Order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mapageweb.umontreal.ca/beauregm/Beauregard2006_CarmelitesfMRI.pdf |title=Neural correlates of a mystical experience in Carmelite nuns |author1=Mario Beauregard |author2=Mario Beauregard |publisher=Neuroscience Letters |issue=405 (2006) |date=26 June 2006 |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2011 study by researchers at the [[Duke University Medical Center]] found [[hippocampus|hippocampal]] atrophy is associated with older adults who report life-changing religious experiences, as well as those who are "[[Christian fundamentalism|born-again Protestants]], Catholics, and those with no religious affiliation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Owen AD, Hayward RD, Koenig HG, Steffens DC, Payne ME | year = 2011 | title = Religious factors and hippocampal atrophy in late life | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 3| page = e17006 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0017006 | pmid=21479219 | pmc=3068149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study using fMRI found "a recognizable feeling central to ... ([[Mormon]])... devotional practice was reproducibly associated with activation in [[nucleus accumbens]], [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]], and frontal attentional regions. [[Nucleus accumbens]] activation preceded peak spiritual feelings by 1–3 s and was replicated in four separate tasks. ... The association of abstract ideas and brain reward circuitry may interact with frontal attentional and emotive salience processing, suggesting a mechanism whereby doctrinal concepts may come to be intrinsically rewarding and motivate behavior in religious individuals."&lt;ref name="pmid27834117"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ferguson MA, Nielsen JA, King JB, Dai L, Giangrasso DM, Holman R, etal| title=Reward, salience, and attentional networks are activated by religious experience in devout Mormons. |journal=[[Social Neuroscience (journal)|Social Neuroscience]] | volume=13 | date=29 November 2016 | issue=  1| pages= 1–13 | pmid=27834117 | doi=10.1080/17470919.2016.1257437 | pmc=5478470| url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:35015066 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychopharmacology===
Some scientists working in the field hypothesize that the basis of [[spiritual experience]] arises in neurological physiology.  Speculative suggestions have been made that an increase of [[N,N-dimethyltryptamine]] levels in the [[pineal gland]] contribute to [[spiritual experiences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Strassman, R | year=2001 | title=DMT: The Spiritual Molecule | publisher=Inner Traditions Bear and Company | isbn=978-0-89281-927-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hood Jr.|first=Ralph W.  and Jacob A.

It has also been suggested that stimulation of the temporal lobe by psychoactive ingredients of '[[Magic Mushrooms]]' mimics religious experiences.&lt;ref name=Mushrooms&gt;{{cite news |first=Judy |last=Skatssoon |url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/health/HealthRepublish_1682610.htm |title=Magic mushrooms hit the God spot |publisher=ABC Science Online |date=2006-07-12 |accessdate=2006-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[hypotheses|hypothesis]] has found laboratory validation with respect to [[psilocybin]].&lt;ref name=PMID_18593735&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Griffiths |first1 = Rr |last2 = Richards |first2 = Wa |last3 = Johnson |first3 = Mw |last4 = McCann |first4 = Ud |last5 = Jesse |first5 = R |title = Mystical-type experiences occasioned by psilocybin mediate the attribution of personal meaning and spiritual significance 14 months later. |journal = Journal of Psychopharmacology  |pmid = 18593735 |pages = 621–32 |issue = 6 |volume = 22 |year = 2008 |doi=10.1177/0269881108094300 |pmc=3050654}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PMID_16826400&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Griffiths |first1 = R R |last2 = Richards |first2 = W A |last3 = McCann |first3 = U |last4 = Jesse |first4 = R |title = Psilocybin can occasion mystical-type experiences having substantial and sustained personal meaning and spiritual significance. |journal = Psychopharmacology |pmid = 16826400 |pages = 268–83; discussion 284–92 |issue = 3 |volume = 187 |year = 2006 |doi=10.1007/s00213-006-0457-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5099">'''Political subjectivity''' is a term used to indicate the deeply embedded nature of [[subjectivity]] and [[subjective experience]] in a socially constructed system of [[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, T., 2015. The politics of subjectivity in American foreign policy discourses. University of Michigan Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. The notion of political subjectivity is an emerging idea in [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]]&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D. 2016. Proximity, subjectivity, and space: Rethinking distance in human geography. Geoforum, 75, pp. 249-252. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2016.07.018 
&lt;/ref&gt;. In some sense the term political subjectivity reflects the converging point of a number of traditionally distinct disciplinary lines of investigation, such as [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], [[political theory]], and [[psychoanalytic theory]]. Above all, the current conceptualization of political subjectivity has become possible due to a fundamental shift in humanities and social sciences during the 20th century, commonly known as the [[linguistic turn]].

Major figures associated with the question of political subjectivity come from diverse disciplinary backgrounds, such as German philosopher [[GWF Hegel]], French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]], French historian [[Michel Foucault]], American literary critic [[Fredric Jameson]], American cultural anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]], American medical anthropologist [[Byron J. Good]], American philosopher and gender theorist [[Judith Butler]], Canadian medical anthropologist [http://artsandscience.usask.ca/profile/SRahimi Sadeq Rahimi], Argentine political theorist [[Ernesto Laclau]], Slovenian philosopher [[Slavoj Zizek]], Greek political theorist [[Yannis Stavrakakis]], and many others.

The term "political subjectivity" had been used in earlier literature, such as Steven Brown's book, ''Political subjectivity: Applications of Q methodology in political science''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=Steven |title=Political subjectivity: Applications of Q methodology in political science |date=1980 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0300025793}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to individual political view points as affected by social and personal psychological processes. But the term was later re-appropriated to refer to the much more intricate idea that the very experience of [[subjectivity]] is fundamentally political. According to Sadeq Rahimi in ''[https://www.academia.edu/12387120/Meaning_Madness_and_Political_Subjectivity Meaning, Madness and Political Subjectivity]'', "Politicality is not an added aspect of the subject, but indeed the mode of being of the subject, that is, precisely what the subject is."&lt;ref name="Meaning, Madness and Political Subjectivity"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rahimi |first1=Sadeq |title=Meaning, Madness and Political Subjectivity |date=2015 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1138840823 |url=http://www.routledgementalhealth.com/books/details/9781138840829/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early (1981) book by [[Fredric Jameson]], ''[[The Political Unconscious|The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=Fredric|title=The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act|date=1981|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|isbn=080149222X}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be considered one of the forerunners of the notion of political subjectivity.  In his book Jameson attributed what he termed a "political unconscious" to [[Text (literary theory)|text]], asserting that all [[Text (literary theory)|text]] has embedded in it, albeit in an implicit form, the encodings of the political history of the environment in which they have been produced.  He then proposed “the doctrine of a political unconscious,” as an analytic method for unearthing the [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutically]] repressed political memories of [[Text (literary theory)|text]], and “restoring to the surface of the text the repressed and buried reality of this fundamental history” (p.&amp;nbsp;20).  While Jameson's original theory of the political unconscious was primarily a [[Neo-Marxism|neo-Marxist]] approach to [[literary criticism]], later proliferation and interdisciplinary cross-fertilization of theories of subjectivity have greatly expanded Jameson's original ideas to include the range of political, cultural and psychological processes within the framework of political subjectivity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2917">'''Poverty Bar'''&lt;ref name=CGN&gt;{{California's Geographic Names|817}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a former settlement in [[Calaveras County, California|Calaveras County]], [[California]] now covered by the waters of [[Camanche Reservoir]]. Poverty Bar is located at latitude - longitude coordinates (also known as lat-long or GPS coordinates) of N 38.22547 and W -120.90938. Poverty Bar is shown in the center of the topographic (topo) map, which is sourced from the United States Geographical Survey map USGS WALLACE quad. The nearest major town is [[Campo Seco, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?lon=-120.9093835&amp;lat=38.2254734&amp;datum=nad83  Poverty Bar, USGS WALLACE Quad, California, Topographic Map]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Poverty Bar was founded south of the [[Mokelumne River]] from [[Lancha Plana]] in [[Amador County, California|Amador County]] as a [[gold]] [[mining]] town during the [[California Gold Rush]], nearby [[Camanche, California]], [[Cat Camp (Calaveras County)|Cat Camp]], and [[Sand Hill (Calaveras County)|Sand Hill]].     

A post office was opened in Poverty Bar in 1858 and closed in 1864.&lt;ref name=CGN /&gt;

Poverty Bar had a major fire on the night of September 7, 1859.  The fire originated in the grocery store of Lorengo &amp; Co., near the center of the town, and spread so rapidly in different directions that in a few minutes the entire town was in flames.  It appeared to have been arson, the second such incident there during that summer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boards.ancestry.co.uk/localities.northam.usa.states.california.counties.calaveras/868/mb.ashx?pnt=1  Weekly Stockton Democrat, Stockton, San Joaquin Co., CA, Sunday, 11 Sept 1859; from Ancestry.co.uk.]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[American Civil War]] the town raised the [[Union Guard]] a [[California Militia]] Company in 1861 and   maintained it until its declining population forced it to be moved. "On July 23, 1866, the company was reorganized and their headquarters moved to Campo Seco."&lt;ref&gt;Outline History of Calif. National Guard, Vol. 2, #107.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1964, before the Comanche Reservoir was filled, the graves in the cemetery of Poverty Bar were transferred to the old Pioneer Cemetery and the People's Cemetery in [[San Andreas, California|San Andreas]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AYMPR6xAj50C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s  Mildred Brooke Hoover, Douglas E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1538">'''Prevoicing''', in [[phonetics]], is [[phonation|voicing]] before the onset of a consonant or beginning with the onset of the consonant but ending before its release. In the [[extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet]] for [[speech pathology]], prevoicing is transcribed with a voicing diacritic (  ̬, U+032C) placed in front of the consonant, as in {{IPA|[ ̬d]}}. 

In several [[Khoisan languages]] of Southern Africa, such as [[Taa language|Taa]] and [[!Kung language|!Kung]], stops such as {{IPA|/dzʰ/}} ({{IPA|[dsʰ]}} or {{IPA|[dtsʰ]}}) and {{IPA|/dzʼ/}} ({{IPA|[dsʼ]}} or {{IPA|[dtsʼ]}}) are sometimes analyzed as being prevoiced {{IPA|/ ̬tsʰ/}} and {{IPA|/ ̬tsʼ/}},&lt;ref&gt;Kehrein, Wolfgang. (2002). ''Phonological representation and phonetic phasing''. Tübingen: Niemeyer.&lt;/ref&gt; though the cessation of voicing has also been analyzed as phonetic detail in the transition of a phonemically voiced consonant to its voiceless aspiration or ejection.

[[Kelabit language|Kelabit]] has a similar set of [[aspirated voiced]] consonants. Not all speakers produce the aspiration, resulting in prevoiced (or mixed voiced) {{IPA|[b͡p, d͡t, ɡ͡k]}} (or equivalently {{IPA|[ &amp;nbsp;̬p, &amp;nbsp;̬t, &amp;nbsp;̬k]}}, and neighboring [[Lun Dayeh language|Lun Dayeh]] has {{IPA|[b͡p, d͡tʃ, ɡ͡k]}} (= {{IPA|[ &amp;nbsp;̬p, &amp;nbsp;̬tʃ, &amp;nbsp;̬k]}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5082">In [[gender studies]], the analysis of '''gender differences in narcissism''' shows that '''male narcissism''' and '''female narcissism''' differ in a number of aspects.

[[Jeffrey Kluger]], in his 2014 book ''The Narcissist Next Door''  suggested that our society, still largely [[patriarchal]], is more likely to tolerate male [[narcissism]] and [[aggressiveness]] than these of females.&lt;ref name=kluger/&gt; This assertion was voiced, although without definite proof, by a number of other researchers.

In 2015 a number of media outlets reported&lt;ref name=kluger&gt;Jeffrey Kluger, [http://time.com/3734329/narcissism-men-women/ "Why Men Are More Narcissistic Than Women"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tele&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/relationships/11455614/Proof-at-last-men-really-are-bigger-narcissists-than-women.html "Proof at last: men really are bigger narcissists than women"]&lt;/ref&gt; about a study at the [[University of Buffalo]] which analyzed 31 years of data of narcissism research and concluded that men consistently scored higher in the first two of three aspects of the [[Narcissistic Personality Inventory]]:  [[leadership]]/[[authority]],  exploitative/[[entitlement]], and grandiose/[[exhibitionism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2015/03/009.html "Study: Men tend to be more narcissistic than women"], A University of Buffalo news release, March 4, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Gender differences in narcissism: A meta-analytic review.", Grijalva, Emily; Newman, Daniel A.; Tay, Louis; Donnellan, M. Brent; Harms, P. D.; Robins, Richard W.; Yan, Taiyi, ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]'', Vol 141(2), Mar 2015, 261-310. {{DOI|10.1037/a0038231}} ([http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=pdharms article text] available from DigitalCommons@[[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]])&lt;/ref&gt; The team leader of the research, Emily Grijalva, commented that on average this difference is slight (a one-quarter of a [[standard deviation]]) and there was almost no difference in the exhibitionism dimension (which covers such aspects as vanity, self-absorption and attention-seeking). She notices that a similar degree of difference is observed for other [[personality trait]]s, e.g., slightly higher [[neuroticism]] for women or slightly higher risk-taking for men.&lt;ref name=emily&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/09/narcissism-seen-as-leader-if-a-man "Narcissism increases the chance you'll be seen as a leader, especially if you're a man"], Emily Grijalva,  Monday 9 March 2015, ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons of reported gender difference were outside the scope of the study, however the authors speculated that it is rooted in historically established social conventions about what is acceptable for a particular gender and what are the traditional [[social role]]s for genders.&lt;ref name=emily/&gt;

A number of earlier studies (on smaller scales) reported similar bias.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua D. Foster, W. Keith Campbell, Jean M. Twenge, "Individual differences in narcissism: Inflated self-views across the lifespan and around the world", ''Journal of Research in Personality'', Volume 37, Issue 6, December 2003, Pages 469–486, {{doi|10.1016/S0092-6566(03)00026-6}}. ''Quote:'' "The results suggest that (1) reported narcissism declines in older participants, (2) consistent with previous findings, males report being more narcissistic than females, (3) that ethnic differences in reported narcissism are generally comparable to those found in the self-esteem literature, and (4) that world region appears to exert influence on narcissism, with participants from more individualistic societies reporting more narcissism."&lt;/ref&gt; A further indication for the trend was a 2008 finding that the lifetime [[narcissistic personality disorder]] is more prevalent for men (7.7%) than  for women (4.8%).&lt;ref&gt;Grijalva et al.

==Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)==

===Article 4 paragraph 1,CEDAW===
The CEDAW or the Convention,   also known as the international Bill of Women's Rights,  is a legally binding  [[international treaty]]  ratified by 187 States Parties, that entered into force in 1981.&lt;ref name="United Nations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=United Nations|title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women :Adopted and opened for signature, ratification and accession by General Assembly resolution 34/180 of 18 December 1979. Entry into force 3 September 1981, in accordance with article 27(1)|date=18 December 1979|pages=10|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/cedaw.pdf|accessdate=17 December 2014|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All  parties to  CEDAW, including the UN,  are bound to honor it.  The  UN Doctrine of  Gender Equality, and 'Special Measures for Gender Equality' are  inspired by  and rooted in the  CEDAW, specifically in  Article 4 paragraph 1, which states:

''Article 4, paragraph 1 : Adoption by States Parties of '''temporary special measures''' aimed at accelerating de facto equality between men and women shall not be considered discrimination as defined in the present Convention, but shall in no way entail as a consequence the maintenance of unequal or separate standards; these measures shall be discontinued when the objectives of equality of opportunity and treatment have been achieved. [emphasis added].''&lt;ref name="United Nations"/&gt;

===General Recommendation No. 25, on Article 4, paragraph 1  of CEDAW ===
The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), an expert body composed of 23 experts on women's issues established in 1982 to monitor the progress of the CEDAW's implementation,  in 2004,  adopted    ''General Recommendation 25, on Temporary Special Measures, on Article 4 paragraph 1 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women''.&lt;ref name="(A/59/38)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=General Assembly|first1=UN|title=Report of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women Thirtieth session (12–30 January 2004) Thirty-first session (6-23 July 2004)|date=2004|volume=General Assembly Official Records Fifty-ninth Session Supplement No. 38 (A/59/38)|issue=A/59/38|pages=Annexure1 78–86|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N04/462/77/PDF/N0446277.pdf?OpenElement|accessdate=2 February 2015|publisher=UN|location=New York|issn=0255-0970}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general recommendation 'clarifies the nature and meaning of article 4, paragraph 1, in order to  facilitate and ensure the implementation of Temporary special measures   and  accelerate  progress in achieving gender equality in 'employment and professional fields'.&lt;ref name="(A/59/38)"/&gt;

The purpose of the "special measures", which are 'temporary' is " to accelerate the improvement of the position of women to achieve their  "substantive equality with men, and to effect the structural, social and cultural changes necessary to correct past and current forms and effects of discrimination against women, as well as to provide them with compensation."   These      are   not   an exception 'to the norm of non-discrimination', but rather 'part of a necessary strategy'   to  achieve 'substantive equality of women'.&lt;ref name="(A/59/38)" /&gt;{{rp|paragraph 18}} The  'temporary special measures',   includes ''''preferential treatment; targeted recruitment, hiring and promotion; numerical goals connected with time frames; and quota systems''''.&lt;ref name="(A/59/38)" /&gt;{{rp|paragraph 22}}

=== UN and Article 4, paragraph 1 on Special Measures ===
The UN  Committee on CEDAW in its general recommendations number 25  commended the  Secretary General on his  initiative to   implement 'temporary special measures', noting  ''"The use of temporary special measures by the Secretary-General of the United  Nations is a practical example in the area of women's employment, including through  administrative instructions on  the recruitment, promotion and placement of women in the  Secretariat. These measures aim at achieving the goal of 50/50 gender distribution at all  levels, but at the higher  echelons in particular"''.&lt;ref name="(A/59/38)" /&gt;{{rp|note 3}}

In 2012, the UN  Secretary General drawing attention to   Article 4  paragraph 1 of the  ''[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)]]''  assured the  [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]]  that Special Measures were temporary,  and   will "be discontinued when gender parity has been achieved and sustained for a period of time".&lt;ref name="A /67/347" /&gt;

==Gender inequality in the UN==
Gender equality in the United Nations (UN),  particularly at managerial and decision-making positions at the D-1 level and above level, has been a United Nations General Assembly goal since 1970 and a recurring concern since then.&lt;ref name="women, 15 December 1970"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=General Assembly, 1930 Plenary Meeting|first1=United Nations|title=Employment of Qualified Women in Senior and other professional positions by the secretariats of Organisations in the United Nations system|journal=General assembly Resolution|date=15 December 1970|volume=2715 (XXV)|page=31|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/349/80/IMG/NR034980.pdf?OpenElement|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A/RES/45/239"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=General Assembly, 72nd plenary meeting|title=Personnel questions : C Improvement of the status of women in the Secretariat|date=21 December 1990|volume=A/RES/45/239|issue=|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/45/a45r239.htm|publisher=United Nations|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1984, the [[Un secretariat|UN Secretariat]],  in order to better focus efforts to wards achieving Gender Equality, prepared its first five-year "Action plan to improve the status of women for the period 1985-90".&lt;ref name="A/RES/45/239"/&gt;&lt;ref name="40/258. 18 December 1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=General Assembly|first1=United Nations|title=Improvement of Status of women in the Secretariat|date=18 December 1985|volume=40/258 B|url=http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/UNGARsn/1985/349.pdf|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then there have been several Five Year Plans, including Strategic Plans, to Improve the Status of Women in the UN.&lt;ref name="A/RES/45/239"/&gt;  In 1990, the United Nations General Assembly after years of slow progress, urged the Secretary General to "accord priority" to increase "the participation of women at the D-1 level and above to 25 per cent " by 1995.&lt;ref name="A/RES/45/239"/&gt;
In December 1994,  the UN General Assembly "disappointment" that the targets set in 1990 were  not achieved  and that  women in posts at the D-1 level  were  "still well below the 25 per cent goal", urged the Secretary General to prioritize the recruitment and promotion of women to reach to 50/50 representation in D1 and above posts by 2000.&lt;ref name="ST/SGB/282"/&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name="A/RES/49/167 - 23/dec"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=General Assembly|title= Improvement of the status of women in the Secretariat|date=23 December 1994|volume=A/RES/49/167|issue=94th plenarymeeting|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/49/a49r167.htm|accessdate=11 December 2014|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Feb 2004, in the context of the continuing sluggish progress in achieving the target of gender parity the General Assembly revised the target for achieving 50/50 goal to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=General Assembly|title=58/144.

===Representation of women in decision-making positions===
Women's representation in the UN secretariat, at the D1 level, in 2000, was 30.3 percent.&lt;ref name="A /65/334"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=General Assembly|title=Improvement of the status of women in the United Nations system Report of the Secretary-General|journal=GA Resolution|date=9 September 2010|issue=A /65/334|page=|pages=54|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N10/500/50/PDF/N1050050.pdf?OpenElement|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p 29, Table 19}}  By   2009, the representation of women in the  secretariat  at D1 level  decreased to 26.7 percent; by way comparison  the representation in the entire UN system in  2009 was 29.2 percent.&lt;ref name="A /65/334" /&gt;{{rp| p 29, Table 19}}

The representation of women in 2011  in the secretariat at D2 level  was 24.4 percent.&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|p 17}} In   December 2011, the representation of women in the Secretariat  at the D1 level  was 27.4 percent, an increase of .6 percent over a two-year period.&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|p 50, fn 64}} At the current rate of  progress,  according to the secretary general's report,  gender parity  at  the D-1 to  higher levels   will be achieved after  102 years.&lt;ref name="A /67/347" /&gt;{{rp|paragraph 133}}

===Reasons for continuing  Gender Equality===
Reasons  most frequently cited for failure to meet the General Assembly targets   for  Gender Equality,   and slide in   women's representation  at the D1 and above level,   according to the Secretary General, are:  [a]  failure by some "entities"   in the "implementation of special measures for gender equality",  and [b]  tardy implementation of five year Actions Plans [para 143].&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A /65/334"/&gt;{{rp|Table 19, p 29}} In  2010-2011 only two out of thirty departments  in the UN  applied the "target of gender parity"[A/67/347,  p 46, paragraph 110(b)]. The  [[UN Secretariat]], the largest entity in the United Nations system, in which 38.7 percent of the staff is women, according to the report, claimed to be one of them. .&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|paragraph p 46, Para B 3(b }}

==Special measures for the achievement of gender equality==
The Special Measures in ST/AI/1999/9, which has four sections, apply throughout the Secretariat "for the filling of all vacant posts in the Professional category and above", including temporary posts.&lt;ref name="ST /AI/1999/9-1"/&gt;{{rp|Section 1 and 2}}  Sections 1.6 and 1.8   of the ST/AI makes clear  that special measures "shall apply to the selection of staff for posts in all categories where '''women are under-represented'''".&lt;ref name="ST /AI/1999/9-1" /&gt;{{rp|Section 1.9}}

===Goal===
The Goal of the ''Special Measures'' as set by the General Assembly  is to  achieve a 50/50 gender  distribution in  the entire organization  and all departments, and  in all "posts in the professional category and above,  including posts at the D1 level and above.  This goal applies throughout the Organization, and in every department, office or regional commission, overall and at each level. It applies not only to posts subject to geographical distribution but to all categories of posts, irrespective of the type or duration of the appointment ..., the series of the Staff Rules under which the appointment is to be given ... or the source of funding. ..."&lt;ref name="ST /AI/1999/9-1" /&gt;{{rp|section1.1}}&lt;ref name="Gender related  system policies"&gt;{{cite web|last1=U N Women|title=Gender related United Nations system policies|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/fpgenderpolicies.htm#SPECIALMEASURES|website=UN Women|publisher=UN Women|accessdate=20 December 2014|date=20 December 2014|quote= ST/AI/1999/9 will remain in effect until the Secretary-General is satisfied that substantial progress towards the goal of gender balance has been made}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cumulative seniority===
Section 1.6 of ST/AI/1999/9 mandates that "Cumulative seniority shall be taken into account when considering women candidates for promotion, except when it would adversely affect their situation. Cumulative seniority shall be calculated as the average of the years of the staff member accrued in her present Professional grade and in her immediately preceding Professional grade".&lt;ref name="ST /AI/1999/9-1"/&gt;

===Selection appointment ===
Section 1.8  of ST/AI/1999/9 mandates "Vacancies in the Professional category and above '''shall''' be filled, when there are one or more women candidates, by one of those candidates" when "Her qualifications meet the requirements for the vacant post";  and "her qualifications are '''substantially equal''' (emphasis added) or superior to those of competing male candidates" (Section 1.8 (i)(ii)).&lt;ref name="ST /AI/1999/9-1"/&gt;

==Implementation and Monitoring==
Head of Departments(HODs) of UN entities  are responsible, and accountable, for the implementation of the special measures, and  the  Office of Human Resources(OHRM), under the Department of  Management (DM),  is  responsible  for monitoring the implementation of the  special measures .&lt;ref name="ST /AI/1999/9-1" /&gt;{{rp|Sections 4.1 and 4.5}}Steering Committee for the Improvement of the Status of Women in the Secretariat (ST/SGB/1999/9),  is responsible  for monitoring and implementation of policies of gender equality, including ''Special Measures''.&lt;ref name="ST/IC/2014/1*"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chief, Policy and Conditions of Service Section, Office of Human Resources Management|title=United Nations Index to administrative issuances: ST/IC/2014/1*|date=January 2014|publisher=United Nations|location=NY, USA|isbn=|pages=2/70|edition= 2014: Reissued for technical reasons on 22 May 2014.|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=%20ST/IC/2014/1|chapter=Introduction|quote=The  Annual  Index to administrative issuances lists in alphanumeric order by series symbol, all issuances at United Nations Headquarters that were current as at 31 December 2013.

The current Policies for ' appointments, placement and promotion' to obtain gender equality in the United Nations system are outlined  in ST/SGB/282 (Policies to achieve Gender Equality in the United nations),&lt;ref name="ST/SGB/282"&gt;{{cite web|last1=UN SECRETARY-GENERAL|title=POLICIES TO ACHIEVE GENDER EQUALITY IN THE UNITED NATIONS, ST/SGB/282|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/pdf/n9600282.pdf|publisher=Secretariat|accessdate=17 May 2015|date=5 January 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ST/AI/1999/9(Special measures for Achievement of gender  Equality), which  entered into force on 1 October 1999. Gender Equality A/I is listed under the heading 'Appointments, placement and promotion" in  the Index  to  Administrative Issuance in effect as on 31 December 2013. The Gender Equality A/I  is in force, and will remain in effect, as the UN secretariat has made clear,  "until specifically amended or abolished".&lt;ref name="ST/IC/2014/1*"/&gt;

===UN women===
The United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, known as UN-Women,  the United Nations entity responsible  for 'gender equality',  and  holding  "the UN system accountable for its own commitments on gender equality"  has  also promulgated that  the Gender Parity A/I  will "remain in effect until the Secretary-General is satisfied that substantial progress towards the goal of gender balance has been made".&lt;ref name="Gender related system policies2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=U N Women|title=Gender related United Nations system policies|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/fpgenderpolicies.htm#SPECIALMEASURES|website=UN Women|publisher=UN Women|accessdate=20 December 2014|date=20 December 2014|quote=II.  will remain in effect until the Secretary-General is satisfied that substantial progress towards the goal of gender balance has been made. The special measures governing the selection and placement of women candidates apply for the filing of all vacant posts at the Professional level in every department and office that has not met the goal of 50/50 gender distribution overall and at each grade level.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Secretary General Report on  Special Measures==
Special Measures have found regular affirmation by the Secretary General  in his reports to the General Assembly. In 2011, Secretary-General's Policy Committee, of which all heads of departments (HOD) are members, including HOD of management,   decided    on "specific actions"   to "accelerate progress towards the goal  of gender parity".&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;  An important  measure identified for action was  measures  for more effective implementations of  Special Measures. The Secretary General in  the  "Report of the  Secretary General" to the General Assembly, in September 2012, to accelerate the goal of gender parity, affirmed the following:&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;
* Special measures, include "targeted recruitment and promotion"&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp| p33, para 68}}
* Temporary special measures, paraphrasing section 1.8 of ST/AI 1999/9, "should be effectively utilized for the placement of women candidates who are '''equally or substantially better qualified''' and should be introduced or restored in entities and at levels where progress is slow".&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|p 55, para 143(b}}   
* Special measures "include mandatory selection of equally or better qualified women candidates, mandatory inclusion of women candidates on all shortlists, and justification in cases where they have not been included or where the shortlisted women are not selected despite prevailing imbalance at that level"&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|p 55, paragraph 147 (b)}}
* Special measures, in ST/AI 1999/9 to be revised and strengthened, to ensure effective implementation&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|p 45, para 108}} 
* Senior officials to ensure "effective implementation of special measures for gender equality."&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|p 55, paragraph 147 (b)}} 
* Special Measures are temporary and will "be discontinued when gender parity has been achieved and sustained for a period of time";&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|para 67}}
* In the context of the legal challenges to Special Measures in the United Nations, and hesitant implementation by some UN entities, the Secretary General  drew attention to the judgment by the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, in November 1994,  and   reiterated that "special measures are fully compatible with the objectives of Article 8 of the Charter of the United Nations".&lt;ref name=GRINBLAT1994&gt;{{cite journal|last1=United Nations  Administrative Tribunal|title=GRINBLAT Against: The Secretary-General of the United Nations|journal=Judgement|date=4 November 1994|volume=Judgement No. 671 Case No. 731|page=15, para XIX|pages=|url=http://untreaty.un.org/UNAT/UNAT_Judgements/Judgements_E/UNAT_00671_E.pdf|accessdate=19 December 2014|publisher=UN Administrative Tribunal|location=New York|quote=Mr. Samar Sen, President; Mr. Jerome Ackerman, Vice-President; Mr. Francis Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p 34 paragraph 72}}

==New staff selection system  and Gender Equality A/I==
{{Main|United Nations Staff Selection System}}
The [[United Nations Secretariat]], in  April  2010,   superseded   the  old  Staff selection  system (ST/AI/ 2006/3/Rev.1) with a new  [[United Nations Staff Selection System|staff selection system (ST/AI 2010/3)]].&lt;ref name="2010/3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=UN Secretariat|title=Administrative instruction  Staff selection system, ST /AI/2010/3|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N10/324/85/PDF/N1032485.pdf?OpenElement|publisher=UN Secretariat|accessdate=6 April 2015|page=1|date=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p2, preamble}}&lt;ref name="2010/3"/&gt;{{rp|p17, section 13.2}}  The new Staff selection system  was  listed in 2014 with   Gender Affirmative A/I ((ST/AI 1999/9))  as applicable  law for '''Appointments, placement and promotion'''.&lt;ref name="ST/IC/2014/1*"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2ST /AI/1999/9-1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=United Nations|title=ST /AI/1999/9.

The 'final provision' of the new staffing system which  entered into force on 22 April 2010  in section 13.3  notes that "The provisions of the present administrative instruction shall prevail over any inconsistent provisions contained in other administrative instructions and information circulars currently in force"&lt;ref name="2010/3"/&gt;{{rp|p17, section 13.3}}   There was a similar  provision in the  earlier Administrative instruction  Staff selection system (ST /AI/2006/3) as well.&lt;ref name="ST /AI/2006/3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Secretariat|title=Administrative instruction  Staff selection system (ST /AI/2006/3)|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/621/31/PDF/N0662131.pdf?OpenElement|publisher=UN Secretariat|accessdate=18 May 2015|date=15 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|p14, section 13.3}}  The UN Secretariat since 2010,  citing section 13.3 of the  new  Staff Selection System (ST/AI 2010/3),   has,  some times,  contended that provision of section 13.3  supersede  Gender Equality A/I(ST/AI 1999/9),  especially section 1.8 on affirmative action, as  Gender A/I is inconsistent with 2010/3.&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|p 33, paragraph 69}} [[UN Women]],  the agency  designated to implement UN Gender Policy,  however,  continues to  assert, including on its web site, that affirmative action for women remain in effect, and continues to be list it as applicable law.&lt;ref name="Gender related  system policies2"/&gt;  The Secretary General  has also  affirmed to the general assembly, as noted above,  that  Gender A/I, remains in effect.&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|p 33, paragraph 67}}   As a result of the secretariat's reservation, and reluctance to implement gender A/I,  it has  been  implemented with diminishing enthusiasm,   and become a frequent cause of litigation.

== Special Measures and jurisprudence==
UNAT jurisprudence has, in its consideration of unsuccessful male candidates,  as well as claims of women under the Organization's affirmative action policies,   repeatedly upheld  affirmative action provisions in  ST/AI/412  and its  successor ST/AI 1999/9,   as lawful and in accordance with the  UN Charter. ST/AI 1999/9.   ST/AI 1999/9 continues to be cited as an applicable  instrument  by  applicants,  as well as the respondent,  in  cases before the  [[United Nations Dispute Tribunal|UN Dispute Tribunal(UNDT)]]   and the [[United Nations Appeals Tribunal (UNAT)]].

===Judgement No. 671, Grinblat(1994)===
United Nations Administrative tribunal  with Judge Sumar Sen as president,  in a seminal  Judgment on affirmative action,  held   : "that the various resolutions for Improvement of the status of women in the Secretariat which have been referred to and statements of the Secretary-General have conceded the existence of an unsatisfactory history with respect to the recruitment and promotion of women that does not accord with Article 8 of the Charter.&lt;ref name="Charter of the United Nations, article 8"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Charter of the United Nations|title=Article 8 Charter of the United Nations|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter3.shtml|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=17 May 2015|page=CHAPTER III: ORGANS|date=26 June 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such circumstances, the Tribunal considers that Article 8 of the [[Charter of the United Nations|Charter]] must be regarded as a source of authority for reasonable efforts to improve the status of women. It would be anomalous indeed if this  unsatisfactory history had to remain unremedied for an unduly long period. Unless affirmative action measures are taken towards ameliorating the effects of this past history, they will, without doubt, be perpetuated for many years. This is incompatible with the objectives of Article 8, as recognized by the General Assembly. Hence, the Tribunal concludes that Article 8 permits the adoption of reasonable affirmative action measures for improvement of the status of women."&lt;ref name=GRINBLAT1994&gt;{{cite journal|last1=United Nations  Administrative Tribunal|title=GRINBLAT Against: The Secretary-General of the United Nations|journal=Judgement|date=4 November 1994|volume=Judgement No. 671 Case No. 731|page=15, para XIX|pages=|url=http://untreaty.un.org/UNAT/UNAT_Judgements/Judgements_E/UNAT_00671_E.pdf|accessdate=19 December 2014|publisher=UN Administrative Tribunal|location=New York|quote=Mr. Samar Sen, President; Mr. Jerome Ackerman, Vice-President; Mr. Francis Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|paragraph XVII}} The Tribunal added that,  "as long as affirmative action is required to redress the gender imbalance with which the Secretary-General and the General Assembly have been concerned, Article 8 of the Charter would permit, as a reasonable measure, preferential treatment to women candidates where their qualifications are substantially equal to the qualifications of competing male candidates; obviously such a preference is not needed if a woman's qualifications are superior".&lt;ref name=GRINBLAT1994&gt;{{cite journal|last1=United Nations  Administrative Tribunal|title=GRINBLAT Against: The Secretary-General of the United Nations|journal=Judgement|date=4 November 1994|volume=Judgement No. 671 Case No. 731|page=15, para XIX|pages=|url=http://untreaty.un.org/UNAT/UNAT_Judgements/Judgements_E/UNAT_00671_E.pdf|accessdate=19 December 2014|publisher=UN Administrative Tribunal|location=New York|quote=Mr. Samar Sen, President; Mr. Jerome Ackerman, Vice-President; Mr. Francis Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tribunal, however, cautioned that affirmative action, however laudable, did not justify any weakening of the requirements of Article 101 (3) of the Charter&lt;ref name="Charter of the United Nations, article 101"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Charter of the United Nations|title=Article 101(3) Charter of the United Nations|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter15.shtml|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=17 May 2015|page=CHAPTER XV: THE SECRETARIAT|date=26 June 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; that officials of the Organization be of "the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity": "In evaluating the reasonableness of affirmative action measures, pertinent provisions of the Charter may not be ignored.

=== Judgement No. 765, Anderson Bieler(1996)===
United Nations Administrative Tribunal,  with Mr. Luis de Posadas Montero, Vice-President, Presiding, reaffirmed Grinblat(1992), and held  that  "the affirmative action measure establishes a right to preferential treatment for women whose qualifications 'are substantially equal to the qualifications of competing male candidates'", and  ruled that "as the Applicant was the only woman short-listed for the post, and as she was equally, if not more, qualified for the post, she had a right to promotion, in the light of ST/SGB/237".&lt;ref name="Judgement No. 765, ANDERSON BIELER"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=UNAT|title=Judgement No. 765, ANDERSON BIELER|date=26 July 1996|issue=Case No. 837|url=http://untreaty.un.org/unat/UNAT_Judgements/Judgements_E/UNAT_00765_E.pdf|accessdate=9 February 2015|location=Geneva}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|paragraph V}}

===Judgement No. 1056,  Katz (2002)===
United Nations Administrative  Tribunal (Mr. Mayer Gabay, President; Ms. Marsha A.Echols; and Mr. Omer Yousif Bireedo)  in the case of an unsuccessful male candidate who challenged the promotion of a woman as unlawful and in violation of his rights of due process,  citing UNAT Judgements No. 411 (1988) and No. 958 (2000), recalled its “established jurisprudence ... that appointments and promotions are within the discretionary authority of the Secretary-General”,&lt;ref name="AT/Dec/1056"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=UN Administrative Tribunal|title=Judgement No. 1056, KATZ Against: The Secretary-General of the United Nations|date=26 July 2002|volume=AT/Dec/1056|issue=Case No. 1152:|url=http://untreaty.un.org/UNAT/UNAT_Judgements/Judgements_E/UNAT_01056_E.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|p6, paragraph IV}} and  that "qualifications, experience, favourable performance reports and seniority are appraised freely by the Secretary-General and therefore cannot be considered by staff members as giving rise to any expectancy".  The tribunal held that these "discretionary powers of the Secretary-General are not absolute.  They are governed by the relevant provisions of the Charter and by General Assembly resolutions.  In this context the Tribunal notes that ST/AI/412 provides that special measures for the achievement of gender equality within the Secretariat must be instituted towards achieving the goal of '50-50 parity between men and women both overall and for positions at the D-1 level and above by the year 2000.  It also provides for flexibility in various promotion requirements in order to increase the number of women considered for promotions, for example flexibility regarding seniority."&lt;ref name="AT/Dec/1056"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=UN Administrative Tribunal|title=Judgement No. 1056, KATZ Against: The Secretary-General of the United Nations|date=26 July 2002|volume=AT/Dec/1056|issue=Case No. 1152:|url=http://untreaty.un.org/UNAT/UNAT_Judgements/Judgements_E/UNAT_01056_E.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp| paragraph V}}

The Tribunal concluded that the male candidate had received "full and fair consideration" for the post and that the Organization was not bound by the recommendation of the hiring department.&lt;ref name="AT/Dec/1056" /&gt;{{rp|paragraph VII}} ''The Tribunal held that the Secretary-General "acted within his discretionary authority in deciding to promote a substantially equally qualified female candidate to the D-1 level post"&lt;ref name="AT/Dec/1056" /&gt;{{rp|paragraph V}}''

===Judgement No. 1302, (2006)===
United Nations Administrative  Tribunal (Mr. Spyridon Flogaitis, President; Mr. Kevin Haugh; Ms. Brigitte Stern) held  that ST/AI/1999/9 required that where there are both male and female candidates with substantially equal qualifications, "the female candidate should be appointed unless the qualifications of the male candidate are in some demonstrable and measurable way superior to those of the best qualified female candidate. The Tribunal has chosen to use the words 'demonstrable' and 'measurable' advisedly for, since appointment and promotion decisions are amenable to administrative review under the Organization's internal justice system and under the Statute of the Tribunal, and since the body carrying out such review ... should act on identifiable facts and on evidence, there should be evidence which can be examined and assessed by the body carrying out the review from which it can be determined if the affirmative action requirements have been fully complied with. This is an essential requirement if there is to be a meaningful review and if the policy of ST/AI/1999/9 or other affirmative action policy is to be enforced as an imperative. Otherwise, such policies become mere shibboleths or mere set pieces of lip service invoked in the pretence of achieving their objectives."&lt;ref name="Judgement No. 1302"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=UN ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL|title=Judgement No. 1302 Case No. 1386 Against: The Secretary-General of the United Nations|journal=ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS|date=29 September 2006|volume=AT /DEC/1302|issue=Judgement No. 1302|url=http://untreaty.un.org/UNAT/UNAT_Judgements/Judgements_E/UNAT_01302_E.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp| paragraph II}} The tribunal concluded that although as a general principle, the party making an allegation bears the burden of proving it,  but "this general proposition must require modification where the relevant evidence is solely in the hands of the Administration  and not available to an Applicant, the onus of proof in certain matters should be viewed as neutral rather than as resting on the Applicant".  The Tribunal, while  agreeing with the conclusions of the Joint Appeals Board (JAB) that "since there was no demonstrable or measurable evidence to support a conclusion that the successful male candidate enjoyed substantially superior qualifications when compared with those of the Applicant, a breach of ST/AI/1999/9 [had] been established"  Accordingly, the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to pay the Applicant the difference between her salary at the P-3 level and the P-4 salary that she would have received had she been appointed to the post in question, from October 2002, for the lesser of either two years or until her promotion to the P-4 level, and ordered the Respondent either to place the Applicant on the "Galaxy roster" until she secures a suitable post at the P-4 level or to pay her two months' net base salary .&lt;ref name="Judgement No. 1302"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=UN ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL|title=Judgement No. 1302 Case No. 1386 Against: The Secretary-General of the United Nations|journal=ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS|date=29 September 2006|volume=AT /DEC/1302|issue=Judgement No. 1302|url=http://untreaty.un.org/UNAT/UNAT_Judgements/Judgements_E/UNAT_01302_E.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp| paragraph II}}

===Tribunal judgments and orders related to ST/AI/1999/9 (Gender AI)===
Gender A/I, as  already mentioned,  has often been a subject of litigation.  In cases brought before the tribunal,  the respondent, ie, the Secretary General,   has, so far, not contested the applicability of the  gender AI as applicable law.  The  tribunal  in  several cases has upheld the validity of Gender AI and  cited it in its judgment.

'''''Studies in Iconography''''' is an annual peer-reviewed journal co-published by the Medieval Institute Publications of [[Western Michigan University]] and [[Princeton University]]'s Index of Christian Art. Founded in 1975, the journal is dedicated to publishing innovative work on iconography and every aspect of visual culture of the period up to 1600. Past volumes have included articles that have dealt with subjects as diverse as the art of the English parish church, the study of marginal imagery in Gothic manuscripts, and recent approaches to early Christian and [[Byzantine art]]. These topics are of current interest and are, like the other studies in the journal, approached from an interdisciplinary, theoretical, or critical perspective by eminent scholars in the field. The journal also includes a number of shorter articles on a variety of themes written by both established and emerging scholars. Reviews of published studies in iconography and art history are included in every volume.

The '''Taos language''' of the [[Tiwa languages|Northern Tiwa language]] branch of the Tanoan language family is spoken in [[Taos Pueblo]], [[New Mexico]].

==Sociolinguistics==

In data collected in 1935 and 1937, [[George L. Trager]] (1946) notes that Taos was spoken by all members of the Taos Pueblo community. Additionally, most speakers were [[bilingual]] in either Spanish or English: speakers over 50 years of age were fluent in Spanish, adult speakers younger than 50 spoke Spanish and English, children around 5 years old could speak English but not Spanish—generally a decrease in age correlated with a decrease in Spanish fluency and an increase in English fluency. Pre-school children and a few very old women were monolingual Taos speakers.

A more recent report by Gomez (2003) notes that the language "until a few years ago remained viable only in age groups of thirty and older", a sign that Taos is being affected by [[endangered language|language endangerment]] pressures. Nonetheless, it is one of 46 languages in North America that are being spoken by significant numbers of children as of 1995 (Goddard 1996). The most recent estimate is from 1980 with about 800 native speakers out of 1600 ethnic population (50% of the population).

Taos speakers have historically been reluctant to provide linguists with language data to work with and have preferred to keep their language secret from outsiders. G. Trager had to work with his consultants in private and keep their identities in confidence.&lt;ref&gt;G. Trager's primary consultants in 1935 and 1937 were young men of about 30 years of age.&lt;/ref&gt; The tendency for secrecy is a continuing general [[Puebloan peoples|Pueblo]] reaction starting in the 17th century in large part due to the oppressive persecution (including public executions and torture) of Pueblo religious practices by the colonial Spanish. The Taos community has been particularly guarded about revealing their language (and culture) to outsiders when compared with other eastern pueblos in New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Taos degree of Indian "blood" averaged around 95% in 1972. In 1970 only one Spanish-American female and 23 non-Taos Indians were living in Taos Pueblo. See Bodine (1979) and Eggan (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Due to secrecy practices, the details of language preservation are not known outside of the community.

==Language variation==

G. Trager found no [[dialectal]] variation in the 1930-1940s.

==Genealogical relations==

Taos belongs to a northern sub-grouping on the Tiwa branch of the Tanoan language family. It is closely related to and partly [[mutually intelligible]] with [[Picurís language|Picurís]] (spoken at [[Picuris Pueblo]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sources on mutual intelligibility report conflicting information. Mithun (1999): "they [Taos and Picuris] are close but generally considered mutually unintelligible". But, G. Trager (1969): "The facts that there are considerable phonological differences between the two languages [Taos and Picuris], but that the grammatical systems are very much alike and that mutual intelligibility still persists...". G. Trager (1946): "The two Tiwa groups [Northern Tiwa and Southern Tiwa] are fairly homogeneous: Sandía and Isleta [of the Southern Tiwa group] differ very little and are mutually completely intelligible; Taos and Picurís [of the Northern Tiwa group] diverge more from each other. Further, the group as a whole is very similar: Taos and Picurís are each intelligible to the other three, and Sandía and Isleta are understood in the north, though with difficulty". G. Trager (1943): "Taos and Picurís are much alike, and mutually understandable. Sandía and Isleta are almost identical. A speaker of the southern languages can manage to understand the northern two, but the reverse is not true." F. Trager (1971): "[Picuris] is most closely related to Taos; these two languages are in part mutually intelligible." Harrington (1910) observed that an Isleta person (Southern Tiwa) communicated in "Mexican jargon" with Taos speakers as Taos and Southern Tiwa were not mutually intelligible.&lt;/ref&gt; It is slightly more distantly related to [[Southern Tiwa language|Southern Tiwa]] (spoken at [[Isleta Pueblo]] and [[Sandia Pueblo]]).

==History==
In July 2012, [[Taos Pueblo]], which "does not formally encourage persons outside the tribe to learn their language" hosted a Tiwa Language Festival for tribal members to keep Tiwa from "going to sleep".  The Cultural Education Committee hopes to incorporate the Tiwa language into [[Head Start Program|Head Start]] in the fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

{{Main article|Taos phonology}}

According to one analysis, Taos has 18 [[consonant]]s:&lt;ref&gt;This list of consonants rests on Trager (1948). A different analysis is in Trager (1946) (and earlier publications). Both can be compared in [[Taos phonology]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Taos has three degrees of [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]]: ''primary'', ''secondary'', and ''unstressed'', as well as three [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]]: ''high'', ''mid'', and ''low''.

===Transcription===

Taos has been transcribed by Trager in [[Americanist phonetic notation]]. However, his transcription differs between his earlier work exemplified by Trager (1946) and his later work following and explained in Trager (1948). The following chart lists the symbolization of Taos phonemes in Trager (1946) and Trager (1948) and also a corresponding [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbolization. However, the chart only lists symbols that differ between the three—if Trager (1946), Trager (1948), and the IPA all use the same symbol it is not listed in the chart below.

| x&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; || xw || {{IPA|xʷ}} (1946), {{IPA|xw}} (1948)
|-
| y || y || {{IPA|j}}
|}

Both Trager (1946) and Trager (1948) use the same vowel symbolization. This symbols have roughly approximate values of corresponding IPA symbols except that the vowel transcribed as {{angle bracket|o}} by Trager is phonetically IPA {{IPA|[ɑ]}} and in Trager's phonemic categorizing a low back vowel (with rounding details irrelevant to the categorization).

More different is Trager's two ways of transcribing tone and stress. The table below shows the differences on the syllable ''ta''.

:{| class="wikitable"
! Stress + Tone combination !! Trager 1946 !! Trager 1948 !! IPA
|-
| primary stress + mid tone || tˈa || tá || {{IPA|ˈtā}}
|-
| secondary stress + mid tone || tˌa || tà || {{IPA|ˌtā}}
|-
| primary stress + high tone || tá || ta̋ || {{IPA|ˈtá}}
|-

|-
| primary stress + low tone || tà || tâ || {{IPA|ˈtà}}
|-
| secondary stress + low tone || tà || tȁ̏ || {{IPA|ˌtà}}
|-
| unstressed || ta || ta || {{IPA|ta}}
|}

The conflation between primary + high and secondary + high as well as primary + low and secondary + low in Trager (1946) was due to the belief that they were in [[complementary distribution]]. Trager rescinded this view in Trager (1948) and onward. In Trager's terminology, primary stress is called "loud" stress, secondary stress is "normal", and unstressed is "weak".

The orthography used in this article is essentially that of Trager (1948) with one modification: Trager (1948: 158) mentioned that the glottal stop ''’'' was not written when word-initial in the practical orthography he was teaching his [[Informant (linguistics)|informants]]—this practice is followed here.

==Grammar==

{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

===Nouns===

Taos nouns are [[inflection|inflected]] according to [[grammatical number]] with the number [[suffix]]es. Additionally, they may be inflected for [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]] with [[prefix]]es that indicate the number and [[grammatical person]] of the possessor as well as [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreeing]] with the number of noun stem.

====Number inflection====

Nouns are generally composed of a noun stem with a following number suffix. The number suffixes distinguish between singular and plural. However, in verbs, three numbers are distinguished—singular, dual, and plural—because of this distinction in verbs the plural suffixes on nouns are more appropriately duoplural (Trager uses the term "nonsingular"). The singular suffix is ''‑na'' and the duoplural suffix is ''‑ne''.

Two other number suffixes ''‑ną'' and ''‑nemą'' can express either singular number or duoplural depending upon the grammatical class of noun. For example, the noun stem ''cupa‑'' "judge" is duoplural with the addition of ''‑ną'': ''cùpáną'' "judges". On the other hand, the noun stem ''t’awa‑'' "wheel" is singular with the addition of ''‑ną'': ''t’áwaną'' "wheel". Examples with ''‑nemą'' include ''ká‑nemą'' "mothers" (duoplural) and ''cí‑nemą'' "eye" (singular). Following the terminology used for other Tanoan languages, these will be called here "inverse" number suffixes.&lt;ref&gt;In [[Kiowa language|Kiowa]] and [[Jemez language|Jemez]] linguistic studies these suffixes are known as "inverse number" suffixes. In this type of analysis nouns belong to grammatical classes which have a default grammatical number specification. The inverse suffixes change (or toggle) to a non‑default number.&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Grammatical number#Inverse number|inverse]] suffixes effectively indicate the grammatical number opposite the other suffix that appears on a given noun. Thus, since the stem ''p’iane‑'' "mountain" requires the plural suffix ''‑ne'' in the duoplural form (namely, ''p’íane‑ne'' "mountains"), the inverse ''‑nemą'' marks the singular in ''p’íane‑nemą'' "mountain". And, likewise, since the stem ''cibiki‑'' "robin" requires the singular suffix ''‑na'' in the singular form (namely, ''cìbikí‑na'' "robin"), the inverse ''‑ną'' marks the duoplural in ''cìbíki‑ną'' "robins".

=====Number classes=====

Taos nouns can be grouped into four grammatical classes based on which number affixes are required for the singular and duoplural inflectional forms. Trager calls these noun classes "genders". One class requires the singular suffix ''‑na'' in the singular form and an inverse suffix in the duoplural. Another class requires an inverse suffix in the singular and the duoplural suffix ''‑ne'' in the duoplural. A third class requires the singular and duoplural suffixes for the singular and duoplural forms, respectively. A fourth class only occurs with the duoplural suffix ''‑ne''. The first two classes, which use an inverse suffix, can be separated into two subclasses based on whether inverse ''‑ną'' or ''‑nemą'' is used. These are summarized in the following table.

:{| class="wikitable"

Noun class I is composed of primarily [[animacy|animate]] nouns. The animate nouns include persons, animals, and [[kinship term]]s. Two non-animate nouns in the class are ''c’ìpána'' "doll" and ''p’ȍxwíana'' "egg". The class includes both native words and [[loanword]]s from Spanish (such as ''yàwo’óna'' "mare" from ''[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yegua yegua]'', and ''prìmu’úna'' "cousin" from ''[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/primo#Spanish primo]''). Membership of this class is represented by the following list of nouns (cited in the singular form). The first list uses the ''‑ną'' inverse suffix in the duoplural.

Nouns in classes II and III are opposed to class I in that they are inanimates. However, there is no apparent semantic motivation for distinguishing the types of nouns with membership in class II and class III. Both classes include body parts, plants, natural phenomena, and man-made materials. Loanwords are incorporated into both classes. Examples of nouns in class II follow. Those with the ''‑ną'' inverse suffix are below.

Trager treats class III and IV as sub-classes of a larger single class.

The noun class system also applies to some other word types besides nouns. Demonstratives and some numerals are also inflected for number with different suffixes that agree with the noun that they modify.

=====Connecting -e-=====

When some stems are followed by the number suffixes, they are followed by a connecting ''‑e‑'' vowel. For example, the word "flower" consists of a stem ''pob‑'' and in the inflected forms the intervening vowel appears: ''pȍb‑é‑nemą'' "flower". Other examples include ''ȍd‑é‑nemą'' "chin, jaw", ''kwían‑e‑na'' "bitch", ''łȉw‑é‑na'' "woman". However, not all instances of ''e'' vowels occurring directly before number suffixes are this intervening vowel as there also some stems which end in a ''e'' vowel, such as ''c’ȕné‑na'' "coyote" which has the stem ''c’ùne‑''.

=====Reduplication=====

Several noun stem have [[reduplication|reduplicated]] stem material appearing between the stem and the number suffix. For example, ''kò’óne'' "washing" consists of the stem ''ko‑'' and the duoplural number suffix ''‑ne''. Between the stem and the suffix is the [[duplifix]] ''‑’o‑''. This duplifix consists of the consonant ''’'' and a copy of the final vowel of the stem ''ko‑''. The duplifix may be symbolized as ''‑’V‑'' where ''V'' represents the reduplication of any vowel that occurs at the end of the preceding noun stem.
Thus "washing" is ''ko‑’V‑ne'', which after copying is ''ko‑’o‑ne''. Other examples include

:{|
| ''cì‑’í‑ne'' || "knot"
|-
| ''cìwyu‑’ú‑na'' || "bird"
|-
| ''ȉa‑’á‑ne'' || "corn"
|}

Further details about the phonology of the reduplication are found in [[Taos phonology#Reduplicative patterning|Taos phonology: Reduplicative vowel patterning]].

The reduplication occurs in all four noun classes before the all number suffixes except inverse ''‑ną'' (in both class I duoplural and class II singular). The following examples show the patterning of reduplication and number suffixes found by Trager.

:{| class="wikitable"
! colspan="2" | Singular

|-

"'''The Swineherd'''" ({{lang-da|Svinedrengen}}) is a literary [[fairy tale]] by [[Hans Christian Andersen]] about a [[prince]] who disguises himself as a [[swineherd]] to woo an arrogant princess. The tale was first published December 20, 1841 by C. A. Reitzel in [[Copenhagen, Denmark]]  in ''Fairy Tales Told for Children. New Collection.''  The tale appears to be original with Andersen though similar tales are known.  "The Swineherd" has been adapted to various media.

==Plot==
A poor prince wants to marry the Emperor's daughter and sends her two beautiful gifts, a nightingale and a rose. The princess rejects the humble gifts because they're real and natural, rather than artificial. The prince then disguises himself and applies for the position of [[swineherd]] at the palace. Once on the job, he creates a musical pot. The princess slogs through the mud to the swineherd's hut and pays ten kisses for the pot. When the swineherd follows the pot with the creation of a musical rattle, she pays one hundred kisses for it. The Emperor, disgusted that his daughter would kiss a swineherd for a toy, casts her out. The prince, having found the princess unworthy of his love, washes his face, dons his royal attire, and spurns the princess as her father did. The princess is left outside the palace door singing dolefully.

==Sources==
The tale appears to be Andersen's invention though the punishing of proud princesses is a stock theme in folk and fairy tales. In Basile's ''[[Pentamerone]]'' (1634) a tale tells of proud Cinziella and her wooing by a prince disguised as a gardener.  In the Grimm collections, "[[King Thrushbeard]]" is a similar tale of a royal disguising himself to woo an arrogant princess.  Andersen's tale is less sentimental than the traditional tales. In traditional tales, the woman is softened and continues to love the man once he is revealed to be royalty but in Andersen she is cast away and left alone mourning the loss of love and status.&lt;ref&gt;Opie 230-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
The tale was first published by C. A. Reitzel in Copenhagen, Denmark on 20 December 1841 in ''Fairy Tales Told for Children. New Collection. Third Booklet. 1842.'' and first translated into English by [[Charles Boner]] in 1846 who published it in ''A Danish Storybook''.&lt;ref&gt;Opie 231&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
The tale has been adapted to various media. ''Les cent baisers'' (The Hundred Kisses), is a ballet choreographed by [[Bronislava Nijinska]] to music by Baron [[Frédéric Alfred d'Erlanger|Frederic d'Erlanger]] and a libretto by [[Boris Kochno]].  The ballet premiered at [[Covent Garden]] 18&amp;nbsp;July 1935 with [[Irina Baronova]] as the Princess and [[David Lichine]] as the Prince. The ballet was first staged in Australia by de Basil's Ballets Russes on 5&amp;nbsp;December 1936.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiadancing.org/subjects/5261.html Australia Dancing - Cent baisers, Les]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An operatic adaptation was undertaken by [[Nino Rota]] (1911&amp;ndash;1979) called ''The Swineherd Prince'' ({{lang-it|Il Principe Porcaro}}) when he was thirteen. Britain's only permanent marionette theatre, [[Harlequin Puppet Theatre]] at [[Rhos-on-Sea]], Wales, presented "The Swineherd" in an adaptation by Eric Brammell in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puppets.uk.com/rep.htm Harlequine Puppet Theater: The Repertoire]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, Soviet/Russian composer [[Boris Tchaikovsky]] wrote a suite of [[incidental music]] for a radio production of ''The Swineherd''.

Parts of the story have been used in [[Evgeny Shvarts]]'s 1934 play "The Emperor's New Clothes".

In [[grammar]], the term '''verbal case''' has been used with various meanings. 

#It may simply indicate the [[noun case|noun-case]] system of [[core argument]]s of the verb, such as [[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[ergative case|ergative]], [[absolutive]], and sometimes core [[dative]] or [[benefactive]]. That is, the cases of those nouns most closely associated with the verb, and which may trigger [[grammatical conjugation#Verbal_agreement|verbal agreement]] or may be affected by the [[voice (grammar)|voice]] of a clause, rather than the cases of the more peripheral oblique arguments. A ''verbal case system'' may thus be synonymous with ''[[morphosyntactic alignment]]''. 
#'Verbal case' may also mean those noun cases governed by the relationship of the noun to the verb, in contrast with 'nominal case', where the case of a noun is determined by another noun (for example, the [[genitive]]). In this use, 'verbal case' is nearly synonymous with 'case', as in most languages with case, all cases but the genitive are governed by the verb.
#It may also be used for noun inflections which confer verbal properties to the noun. When a noun takes certain cases, it may also agree with the verb in [[tense–aspect–mood]], for example, and so not behave as a typical noun.
#It may refer to inflections of the verb which are argued to behave semantically like case on nouns. Traditionally, case is defined as a morphological inflection of the noun, not the verb, and it is controversial whether verbal inflections can truly behave like a case system.

==Verbal case vs. nominal case==
It is frequently remarked that the [[genitive case]] behaves differently than other cases: Most cases (sometimes 'verbal' cases) are governed by their role in the clause relative to the verb, whereas the genitive (a 'nominal' case) is governed by another noun. For instance, the difference in English between nominative "I" and [[oblique case|oblique]] "me" is governed by its relationship to the verb (at least according to prescriptive grammars), whereas the genitive form "my" is associated with a noun: '''''I''' see the dog, the dog sees '''me''','' but '''''my''' dog''.

There are other situations where a case has been argued to be nominal rather than verbal. For instance, in [[Latin grammar|Latin]], a noun may be inflected for case according to its role with an [[infinitive]], which is arguably as much a noun as a verb, and this has been called nominal case:&lt;ref name=Butt&gt;Miriam Butt, 2006. ''Theories of Case'', p 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|first ||resist.[[infinitive|{{sc|inf}}]] ||Macedonian.[[nominative|{{sc|nom.pl}}]]
|}
:'At first, the Macedonians resisted'

Similarly, when a verb is [[nominalization|nominalized]], its arguments may remain with their original cases:
:''She likes me → (I don't like) her liking me''
Here, as the verb 'likes' is changed to the [[gerund]] 'liking', and the nominative 'she' changes to genitive 'her', but the oblique case of 'me' remains. Such situations are very common in [[subordinate clause]]s.

'''''Vägmärken''''' ('''''Markings''''', or more literally '''''Waymarks'''''), published in 1963, is the only book by former [[UN secretary general]], [[Dag Hammarskjöld]]. The journal was discovered after his death, with a covering letter to his literary executor, "a sort of White Book concerning my negotiations with myself - and with God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dag Hammarskjöld - Biographical | url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1961/hammarskjold-bio.html

== Personal significance ==
[[File:Dag-hammarskjold 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dag Hammarskjöld]], author of ''Markings'']]A collection of his diary reflections, the book starts in 1925, when he was 20 years old, and ends at his death in 1961. The typewritten manuscript was found in the bedside table of his New York apartment after Hammarskjöld's death in the Congo.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; As van Dusen writes: "His last night had been spent in the residency of Sture Linner ([[:sv:Sture Linner|sv]]), head of the [[Congo Crisis|United Nations mission to the Congo]]. He left there the copy of the German original of [[Ich und Du]] (I and Thou) presented to him by [[Martin Buber]] and the first dozen pages of his translation into Swedish...Beside the bed was the cherished copy of [[Thomas a Kempis]]' ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]'' which was always on the table of his [[New York City]] apartment next to his bed where the manuscript of ''Markings'' was found."&lt;ref&gt;Henry P Van Dusen. Dag Hammarskjöld. ''A Biographical Interpretation of Markings'' Faber and Faber London 1967 p 169&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the entries in ''Markings'' describe Hammarskjöld's struggles to view his professional duty as a spiritual responsibility. The entry on June 11, 1961, for example, reads: "Summoned/To carry it,/Aloned/To assay it,/Chosen/To suffer it,/And free/To deny it,/I saw/For one moment/The sail/In the sun-storm,/Far off/On a wave-crest,/Alone,/Bearing from land./For one moment/I saw."&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) [[Faber and Faber]] London 1964 p175&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammarskjöld died in a plane crash in [[Zambia]], near midnight, on September 17–18, 1961. The last entry of ''Markings'' is dated 24 August 1961: "Is it a new country/In another world of reality/Than Day's?/Or did I live there/Before Day was?/ I awoke/To an ordinary morning with grey light/Reflected from the street,/But still remembered/The dark-blue night/Above the tree line,/The open moor in moonlight,/The crest in shadow,/Remembered other dreams/Of the same mountain country:/Twice I stood on its summits,/I stayed by its remotest lake,/And followed the river/Towards its source./The seasons have changed/And the light/And the weather/And the hour./But it is the same land./And I begin to know the map/And to get my bearings."&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 181&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spiritual significance ==
''Markings'' was described by the late theologian Henry P. Van Dusen as "the noblest self-disclosure of spiritual struggle and triumph, perhaps the greatest testament of personal faith written ... in the heat of professional life and amidst the most exacting responsibilities for [[world peace]] and order."&lt;ref&gt;Henry P Van Dusen. Dag Hammarskjöld. ''A Biographical Interpretation of Markings'' Faber and Faber London 1967 p 5&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that "among the approximately six hundred 'Road Marks' staked down along the "Way' of Dag Hammarskjöld's pilgrimage, almost exactly a hundred are concerned in greater or lesser measure with God."&lt;ref&gt;Henry P Van Dusen. Dag Hammarskjöld. ''A Biographical Interpretation of Markings'' Faber and Faber London 1967 p200&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammarskjöld writes, for example, "We are not permitted to choose the frame of our destiny. But what we put into it is ours. He who wills adventure will experience it—according to the measure of his courage. He who wills sacrifice will be sacrificed—according to the measure of his purity of heart." &lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The entry of 4 August 1959 reads: "To have humility is to experience reality, not ''in relation to ourselves'', but in its sacred independence. It is to see, judge, and act from the point of rest in ourselves. Then, how much disappears, and all that remains falls into place. In the point of rest at the centre of our being, we encounter a world where all things are at rest in the same way. Then a tree becomes a mystery, a cloud, a revelation, each man a cosmos of whose riches we can only catch glimpses. The life of simplicity is simple, but it opens to us a book in which we never get beyond the first syllable."&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 148&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary significance ==
''Markings'' is characterised by Hammarskjöld's intermingling of prose and [[haiku]] poetry in a manner exemplified by the 17th-century Japanese poet [[Matsuo Bashō|Basho]] in his ''[[Narrow Roads to the Deep North]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p149&lt;/ref&gt; Representative examples include:

The Easter-lily's dew-wet calyx.&lt;br /&gt;
Drops pausing&lt;br /&gt;
Between earth and sky.&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p150&lt;/ref&gt;

They laid the blame on him.&lt;br /&gt;
He didn't know what it was,&lt;br /&gt;
But he confessed it.&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 152&lt;/ref&gt;

Trees quiver in the wind,&lt;br /&gt;
Sailing on a sea of mist&lt;br /&gt;
Out of earshot.&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 157&lt;/ref&gt;

In his foreword to ''Markings'', the English poet [[W. H. Auden]] states: "''Markings'', however, was not intended to be read simply as a work of literature. It is also an historical document of the first importance as an account—and I cannot myself recall another—of the attempt by a professional man of action to unite in one life the ''Via Activa'' and the ''Via Contemplativa''." &lt;ref&gt;WH Auden Foreword to Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 23&lt;/ref&gt; Auden quotes Hammarskjöld as stating "In our age, the road to holiness necessarily passes through the world of action."&lt;ref&gt;WH Auden Foreword to Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:See-through of Cupaloy.jpg|right|thumb|1939 Time Capsule sketch]]

The '''Westinghouse Time Capsules''' are two [[time capsule]]s prepared by the [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company]]: "Time Capsule I" was created for the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] and "Time Capsule II" was created for the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]. Both are buried 50 feet below [[Flushing Meadows–Corona Park]], the site of both world's fairs; the 1965 capsule was placed ten feet north of the 1939 capsule. The capsules are to be opened at the same time in the year 6939, five thousand years after the first capsule was sealed.&lt;ref&gt;Westinghouse (1938), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The time capsules are bullet-shaped, measure {{convert|90|in|m|}} in length, and have an exterior casing of about {{convert|8.75|in|cm|}} in diameter.&lt;ref name="Westinghouse 1938, p. 8"&gt;Westinghouse (1938), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Time Capsule I weighs about {{convert|800|lb|kg}}, while Time Capsule II weighs about {{convert|400|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref name="Press Release October 16, 1965"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/specials/magazine3/release.html Time capsule II deposited for 5,000 years at world's fair]. ''The New York Times'' archive. October 16, 1965. Retrieved October 17, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Time Capsule I was made of a non-[[ferrous]] [[alloy]] called Cupaloy, created especially for this project.&lt;ref name=anderson2016&gt;Anderson, Brian. [http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/the-future-is-still-now-inside-westinghouses-time-capsule-1 The Future Is Still Now: Inside Westinghouse's Time Capsule 1]. ''Motherboard.vice.com''. April 30, 2016. Retrieved on October 17, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Designed to resist corrosion for 5,000 years, the alloy was made of 99.4% [[copper]], 0.5% [[chromium]], and 0.1% [[silver]].&lt;ref name="Westinghouse 1938, p. 10"&gt;Westinghouse (1938), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Westinghouse claims that Cupaloy has the same strength as steel, yet will resist most [[corrosion]] over thousands of years because it becomes an [[anode]] in [[electrolytic]] reactions, receiving deposits instead of wasting away like most iron-bearing metals.&lt;ref&gt;Westinghouse (1939), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Time Capsule II was made of a [[stainless steel]] metal called Kromarc, supplied by [[U.S. Steel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/specials/magazine3/release.html Press release Saturday, October 16, 1965]. ''New York Times'' archive. October 16, 1965. Retrieved on October 17, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Westinghouse Research Laboratories determined, with extensive chemical testing, that this new super-stainless steel alloy would resist corrosion, much like the alloy used for Time Capsule I.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/specials/magazine3/brochure.html Westinghouse - Commemorative Brochure]. ''New York Times'' archive&lt;/ref&gt; Invented by Frederick Charles Hull,&lt;ref&gt;Vader Voort, George F. Vander (1993) [https://books.google.com/books?id=muV1h4Ddn4wC&amp;pg=PA58 ''Metallography--past, Present, and Future: 75th Anniversary Volume'']. ''ASTM International''. {{ISBN|978-0-8031-1484-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&gt; Kromarc 55 stainless steel is composed of 52.60% [[iron]], 21.24% [[nickel]], 15.43% chromium, 8.20% [[manganese]], 2.15% [[molybdenum]], 0.22% [[silicon]], 0.05% [[carbon]], 0.013% [[phosphorus]], and 0.012% [[sulfur]].

The contents of the time capsules were sealed inside an insulated, airtight, glass envelope with an interior diameter of {{convert|6.5|in|cm}} and a length of about {{convert|81|in|cm}}.&lt;ref name="Westinghouse 1938, p. 8"/&gt; The interior of the glass envelope of Capsule I was filled with [[nitrogen]],&lt;ref name="Westinghouse 1938, p. 8"/&gt; whereas Capsule II was filled with the inert gas, [[argon]]. The term "time capsule" was coined by [[George Edward Pendray]] for the 1939 World's Fair Westinghouse exhibit in New York.&lt;ref name=anderson2016 /&gt;

==Capsule contents==

===1939 Time Capsule I===
Among the 35 small, everyday items placed inside Time Capsule I were a fountain pen and an alphabet block set. Time Capsule I also contained 75 types of fabrics, metals, and plastics. Modern literature, contemporary art, and news events of the twentieth century were recorded on a [[microfilm]] "Micro-File" for placement in Time Capsule I; the "Micro-File" holds over ten million words and a thousand pictures, and has a small microscope for viewing. There are also instructions included on how to make both a large microfilm viewer and a motion picture projector for the [[newsreel]]s.

Also included in the capsule were copies of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, a [[kewpie doll]], one [[dollar]] in change, a pack of [[Camel cigarettes]], a 15-minute [[RKO Pictures|RKO Pathe Pictures]] newsreel, a [[Lilly Daché]] hat, and millions of words of text put on [[microfilm]] rolls which included a [[Sears Roebuck]] catalog, a [[dictionary]], and an [[almanac]]. A variety of seeds were placed in the time capsule including wheat, corn, oats, tobacco, cotton, flax, rice, soy beans, alfalfa, sugar beets, carrots, and barley.

The items in the capsule were selected to chronicle 20th-century life in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/specials/magazine3/items.html Complete Contents List of 1939 Time Capsule].

Retrieved on October 17, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; During packaging of the contents, under the direction of representatives of the United States [[National Bureau of Standards]], each object was examined to determine whether it could be expected to last 5,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Westinghouse (1939), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, care was taken to select items that are not interactive and do not decompose into harmful gases or acids. Organic items (for example, seeds) were placed in sealed glass vials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time Capsule 1939|url=http://davidszondy.com/future/timecapsule/timecapsule1939.htm|website=davidszondy.com|accessdate=17 October 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040822235433/http://www.davidszondy.com/future/timecapsule/timecapsule1939.htm|archivedate=August 22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five categories of objects were placed inside Capsule I:
* Small articles of common use
* Textiles and materials
* Essay in microfilm
* RKO newsreel
* Miscellaneous items

===1965 Time Capsule II===
Five main categories of objects were placed in Capsule II:
* Articles in common use
* Atomic energy
* Scientific developments
* Space
* Other

The "other" category included images of a guest book signed by visitors to the Westinghouse pavilion at the 1964 fair. Signers received tin pins, about {{convert|1.2|in|mm}} across (roughly the size of an American [[Half dollar (United States coin)|fifty-cent piece]]), stating, ''My name is in the Westinghouse Time Capsule for the next 5,000 years.'' The book's pages were photographed onto [[Cellulose acetate|acetate microfilm]] and placed into the time capsule. An exact duplicate of the capsule's articles resides at the [[Heinz History Center]] beside a replica capsule of Time Capsule I.&lt;ref&gt;Sterbenz, Christina.

==Book of Record==

The contents of Time Capsule I were recorded in a ''Book of Record of the Time Capsule of Cupaloy''. The purpose of this book is to preserve knowledge of the existence of the time capsule for 5,000 years, and to provide assistance to the people of the year 6939 in locating and recovering it. More than 3000 copies of the book were distributed to museums, monasteries, and libraries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Westinghouse (1939), pp 11-13&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid confusion about the 1965 time capsule, a supplement announcing Time Capsule II was sent to the original 3,000 depositories of the 1938 edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Westinghouse Time Capsule 1964 |url=http://davidszondy.com/future/timecapsule/timecapsule1964.htm |website=davidszondy.com |accessdate=17 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040822235727/http://www.davidszondy.com/future/timecapsule/timecapsule1964.htm |archivedate=August 22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If present-day methods of determining time are lost, future generations will be able to calculate the age of the time capsules using astronomical data. In the year 1939, there were two [[eclipse]]s of the [[moon]], falling on the third of May and the twenty-eighth of October. There were also two eclipses of the [[sun]], an annular eclipse on the nineteenth of April, the path of annular eclipse grazing the [[North Pole]] of the [[earth]], and a total eclipse on the twelfth of October, the total path crossing near the [[South Pole]]. The [[heliocentric]] [[longitudes]] of the [[planet]]s on the first of January at zero-hours [[Greenwich Mean Time|Greenwich time]] were as follows:&lt;ref name="Westinghouse 1938, p. 10" /&gt;

The mean position of the [[North Star]] [[Polaris]] (Alpha Ursae Minoris) on the first of January was [[Right Ascension]], 1 hour, 41 minutes, 59 seconds; North Polar distance, 1 degree, 1 minute, and 33.8 seconds. [[Astronomers]] of the early twentieth century determined that such a combination of astronomical events is unlikely to recur for many thousands of years. It is thought that this information will allow people of the future to determine the number of years that have elapsed since the capsule was buried by computing backward from their time.&lt;ref name="Westinghouse 1938, p. 11"&gt;Westinghouse (1938), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location of the two time capsules==
[[File:Time capsule internment plan.png|right|thumb|200px|1939 Westinghouse exhibit]]

Time Capsule I was lowered at noon on September 23, 1938, the precise moment of the [[Autumnal Equinox]]. The latitude and longitude coordinates of its burying place, as determined by the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey]], was recorded in the ''Book of Record'' as {{coord|40|44|34.09|N|73|50|43.84|W|region:US-NY_type:landmark}} within an {{convert|1|in|cm}}).&lt;ref name="Westinghouse 1938, p. 11"/&gt; The time capsule will likely move vertically or horizontally for geological reasons,&lt;ref name="Westinghouse 1938, p. 11"/&gt; so an alternate [[electromagnetic field]] method was provided. This method involves constructing a loop of wire {{convert|10|ft|m}} in diameter and putting an [[alternating current]] (between 1,000 and 5,000 [[hertz]]) through it with a power of at least 200 [[watt]]s. A secondary loop of wire, about {{convert|1|ft|m}} in diameter, will detect a "distortion field", thus indicating the exact location of the two metal alloy time capsules, assuming no other large metal objects are in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;Westinghouse (1938), pp. 39-41&lt;/ref&gt;

At the close of the 1965 World's Fair, a seven-ton "permanent sentinel" granite monument, made by the [[Rock of Ages Corporation]], was installed. The {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} shaft was filled using pitch, concrete and earth, and the monument placed to mark the position where the two time capsules are buried.&lt;ref name="Press Release October 16, 1965"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/specials/magazine3/brochure.html#Permanent%20Sentinel Permanent Sentinel].

==Messages==
The ''Book of Record'', a copy of which was microfilmed and put inside Time Capsule I, contains written messages from three important men of the time:

[[Albert Einstein]]'s message,
[[File:Albert Einstein signature.jpg|left|thumb|100px]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Our time is rich in inventive minds, the inventions of which could facilitate our lives considerably. We are crossing the seas by power and utilise power also in order to relieve humanity from all tiring muscular work. We have learned to fly and we are able to send messages and news without any difficulty over the entire world through electric waves. However, the production and distribution of commodities is entirely unorganised so that everybody must live in fear of being eliminated from the economic cycle, in this way suffering for the want of everything. Further more, people living in different countries kill each other at irregular time intervals, so that also for this reason any one who thinks about the future must live in fear and terror. This is due to the fact that the intelligence and character of the masses are incomparably lower than the intelligence and character of the few who produce some thing valuable for the community. I trust that posterity will read these statements with a feeling of proud and justified superiority.''&lt;ref&gt;Westinghouse (1938), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Robert Andrews Millikan]]'s message,
[[File:Robert A Millikan signature.jpg|left|thumb|100px]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''At this moment, August 22, 1938, the principles of representative ballot government, such as are represented by the governments of the Anglo-Saxon, French, and Scandinavian countries, are in deadly conflict with the principles of despotism, which up to two centuries ago had controlled the destiny of man throughout practically the whole of recorded history. If the rational, scientific, progressive principles win out in this struggle there is a possibility of a warless, golden age ahead for mankind. If the reactionary principles of despotism triumph now and in the future, the future history of mankind will repeat the sad story of war and oppression as in the past.''&lt;ref name=west47&gt;Westinghouse (1938), p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Thomas Mann]]'s message,
[[File:Thomas Mann signature.jpg|left|thumb|100px]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''We know now that the idea of the future as a "better world" was a fallacy of the doctrine of progress. The hopes we center on you, citizens of the future, are in no way exaggerated. In broad outline, you will actually resemble us very much as we resemble those who lived a thousand, or five thousand, years ago. Among you too the spirit will fare badly. It should never fare too well on this earth, otherwise men would need it no longer. That optimistic conception of the future is a projection into time of an endeavor which does not belong to the temporal world, the endeavor on the part of man to approximate to his idea of himself, the humanization of man. What we, in this year of Our Lord 1938, understand by the term "culture" a notion held in small esteem today by certain nations of the western world is simply this endeavor. What we call the spirit is identical with it, too. Brothers of the future, united with us in the spirit and in this endeavor, we send our greetings.''&lt;ref name=west47 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Inscription on the time capsules==
The exterior of the 1938 time capsule is die-stamped with this message to anyone that might stumble upon it prior to the scheduled opening year of 6939.&lt;ref&gt;Westinghouse (1938), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Westinghouse timecapsule replica4.jpg|thumb|center|800px]]&lt;center&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;TIME CAPSULE OF CUPALOY, DEPOSITED ON THE SITE OF THE NEW YORK WORLD'S FAIR ON SEPTEMBER 23,1938,&lt;br /&gt; BY THE WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC &amp; MANUFACTURING COMPANY. IF ANYONE SHOULD COME UPON THIS CAPSULE&lt;br /&gt; BEFORE THE YEAR A. D. 6939 LET HIM NOT WANTONLY DISTURB IT, FOR TO DO SO WOULD BE TO DEPRIVE THE&lt;br /&gt; PEOPLE OF THAT ERA OF THE LEGACY HERE LEFT THEM. CHERISH IT THEREFORE IN A SAFE PLACE.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The 1965 time capsule exterior has no message.

==Future languages==
The ''Book of Record'' requests that its contents be translated into new languages as they develop.&lt;ref&gt;Westinghouse (1939), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; It contains a key with illustrations devised by Dr. [[John P. Harrington]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] to help future [[archaeologists]] with the English language,&lt;ref&gt;Westinghouse (1938), pp. 20-37&lt;/ref&gt; since it was felt that existing languages could be lost.&lt;ref&gt;Westinghouse (1938), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes an illustration showing exactly where each of the 33 sounds of 1938 English are formed in the oral cavity in what Dr. Harrington refers to as a "mouth map."&lt;ref&gt;Westinghouse (1938), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;
