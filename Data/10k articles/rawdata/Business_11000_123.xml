      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4095">{{About|the military euphemism}}

An '''acceptable loss''', also known as '''acceptable damage''', is a military [[euphemism]] used to indicate casualties or destruction inflicted by the enemy that is considered minor or tolerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spears|first=Richard|title=McGraw-Hill's Dictionary of American Idoms and Phrasal Verbs|year=2006|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=0071486852|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[combat]] situations, leaders have to often choose between options where no one solution is perfect and all choices will lead to casualties or other costs to their own troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shambach|first=Stephen A.|title=Strategic Leadership Primer|year=2004|publisher=Department of Command, Leadership and Management, United States Army War College|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small scale practical example might be when the advancement of troops is halted by a [[minefield]]. In many [[military operations]], the speed of advancement is more important than the safety of troops. Thus, the minefield must be "breached" even if this means some casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ghaffari |title=Mines and human casualties, a robotics approach toward mine clearing|journal=Proc. SPIE 5608, Intelligent Robots and Computer Vision XXII: Algorithms, Techniques, and Active Vision|volume=5608|date=October 2004|issue=306|pages=306|doi=10.1117/12.571260|series=Intelligent Robots and Computer Vision XXII: Algorithms, Techniques, and Active Vision|first1=Masoud|last2=Manthena|first2=Dinesh|last3=Ghaffari|first3=Alireza|last4=Hall|first4=Ernest L.|bibcode=2004SPIE.5608..306G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a larger [[Military strategy|strategic]] level, there is a limit to how many casualties a nation's military or the public are willing to withstand when they go to war. For example, there is an ongoing debate on how the conceptions of acceptable losses affect how the [[United States]] conducts its military operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lacquement |first=Richard A. Jr. |title=The Casualty-Aversion Myth |journal=Naval War College Review |date=March 2004 |url=https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/82192134-8122-404a-a139-2fcc2de2fe38/Casualty-Aversion-Myth,-The---Lacquement,-Richard-.aspx |accessdate=20 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105133639/https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/82192134-8122-404a-a139-2fcc2de2fe38/Casualty-Aversion-Myth%2C-The---Lacquement%2C-Richard-.aspx |archivedate=5 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of acceptable losses has also been adopted to business use, meaning taking necessary risks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McManus |first=Gerard |title=Military Precision |url=http://www.aim.com.au/DisplayStory.asp?ID=875 |publisher=Australian Institute of Management |accessdate=21 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130711222335/http://www.aim.com.au/DisplayStory.asp?ID=875 |archivedate=11 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the general costs of doing business, also covered with terms such as ''waste'' or [[Shrinkage (accounting)|''shrinkage'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenstone |first=Richard J. |title=Acceptable Losses |journal=The Licensing Journal |date=August 2001 |url=http://www.rjg.com/acceptablelosses.html |accessdate=21 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111023741/http://www.rjg.com/acceptablelosses.html |archivedate=11 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The euphemism is related to the concept of [[Risk assessment|''acceptable risk'']], which is used in many areas such as [[medicine]] and [[politics]], to describe a situation where the a course of action is taken because the expected benefits outweigh the potential hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Last|first=John M.|title=A Dictionary of Public Health|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195160901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1140">An '''alternate director''' is an individual who is appointed to attend a [[meeting|board meeting]] on behalf of the [[board of directors|director]] of a [[company (law)|company]] where the principal director would be otherwise unable to attend.  The law relating to alternate directors varies from country to country, but in most jurisdictions, the alternate director has the same powers to attend, speak and vote at meetings as the principal director would have had, had the alternate not been appointed.

In some jurisdictions, the alternate must also be a director in his or her own right (so in effect, there would be one less person at the meeting, but the director who had also been appointed as an alternate would carry two votes).  However such structures are not common in developed legal systems.

The appointment of a temporary alternate is one of the few exceptions to the general rule that the office of a director is not assignable and non-delegable.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the United Kingdom, see section 308 of the Companies Act 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arbeitskreis Börse''' (abbreviated '''AKB''' or '''AK Boerse''') is a [[non-profit organization]] located in [[Mannheim]] ([[Germany]]), focused on [[investment banking]], [[capital markets]], consulting and [[start-up companies]] within the [[financial technology]] sector. It is the oldest financial association lead by students in Germany and with over 1,000 members among the largest student organizations in Germany. The Arbeitskreis Börse is dedicated to connect students interested in financial markets associated with worldwide leading [[bank]]s and [[consulting firms]]. These include [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]], [[KPMG]] and [[Oliver Wyman]], which are premium partners of Arbeitskreis Börse. It is organized first and foremost by students of the [[University of Mannheim]] but is receiving increasing support from students of other tertiary establishments in [[Mannheim]].
{{TOC limit|2}}

== History ==
The Arbeitskreis Börse was founded in response to a perceived gap in the services provided by student societies at the [[University of Mannheim]]. Students interested in the [[stock exchange]] and [[financial markets]], that sought to actively participate in [[capital markets]] did not have the opportunity to do so whilst engaging on campus as no such opportunity had yet been offered. 
Therefore, a small group of students independently organized an evening event within the university with the aim of creating a platform for students interested in the financial markets . Supported by the University this group developed into a non-profit association which was registered by the city of [[Mannheim]] on November 6th 1984.

Corresponding with positive developments within financial markets, membership within the Arbeitskreis Börse steadily grew to exceed 1,000 students within a few years. Through their stock market analysis and research papers the Arbeitskries Börse rapidly became well throughout the [[Rhine-Neckar]] area, which led to leading global investment banks and consulting firms taking notice of the Arbeitskreis Börse. At the [[University of Mannheim]] the lecture series "Semester Program of the Arbeitskreis Börse" was established and the Arbeitskreis Börse focused on building partnerships with financial institutions within the European financial hubs, London and Frankfurt in the following years. To satisfy external requests the "Kreis der Freunde und Förderer des AKB" was founded in October 1988, an association that could be joined by everyone interested in the Arbeitskreis Börse.

Today the Arbeitskreis Börse is the largest finance association run by students in Germany and the largest student society at the [[University of Mannheim]]. The Arbeitskreis Börse still provides the same extensive semester program and within the framework of their lectures they attract renowned speakers from both the world's leading investment banks and consulting firms. While doing this the students of the [[University of Mannheim]] get the chance to develop business contacts at several networking events. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akboerse.de/wir-ueber-uns/historie/|title= History of Arbeitskreis Börse|accessdate =2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
As a student initiative, the Arbeitskreis Börse is mainly organized by students of the [[University of Mannheim]] in addition to several students from other tertiary establishments in [[Mannheim]]. In June, the Arbeitskreis Börse annually appoints its new leading team and executive board. The team is made up of the heads of five resorts: member management, [[event management]], [[Information technology|IT]], [[marketing]] and social events. The executive board consists of five additional students who are responsible for resort management, [[finances]], working groups, semester programme, special events, contacts to the university, developments of the Arbeitskreis Börse as an association, premium partners and other cooperation partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akboerse.de/wir-ueber-uns/team/|title= Team of Arbeitskreis Börse|accessdate= 2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arbeitskreis Börse is supported by external partners, including [[Oliver Wyman]], [[Boston Consulting Group|BCG]], [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]], [[KPMG]], [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|PwC]] as well as the [[Mannheim Business School]] and alumni.

== Activities and semester program ==
The Arbeitskreis Börse attempts to form a direct link between the theoretical frameworks covered in academic studies and the practical application of these within a company. 
During each semester various events are organized on Mannheim's main [[campus]] - the [[Mannheim Palace]] in [[Mannheim]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]]. Firstly topical lectures are held by renowned individuals from within the financial or consulting industry, these have for instance included Armin von Falkenhayn, Head of Global Corporate and Investment Banking Germany at [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]]; Dr. Marcus Schenk, [[Chief Financial Officer]] at [[Deutsche Bank]]: Christian Zorn, Head of Investment Banking Germany at [[Morgan Stanley]] and Frank Mattern, former [[CEO]] at [[McKinsey &amp; Co.]]. Occasionally representatives of other industries such as [[Kurt Bock]], [[CEO]] at [[BASF SE]], are invited to hold such lectures. Secondly, several company [[workshops]] as well as student work groups are conducted to support Mannheim students aspiring a career in the financial sector. Within these lectures, the various companies prepare case studies that provide insight into their structure and everyday work environment. Following these lectures, the audience is able to discuss specific topics with top tier personalities and get to know company recruiters as well as employees.

The companies that have held lectures or offered workshops during the past years in cooperation with the Arbeitskreis Börse are - besides the premium partners [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]], [[KPMG]] and [[Oliver Wyman]] - leading banks such as [[Morgan Stanley]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[J. P. Morgan]], [[Credit Suisse]], [[Commerzbank]], [[Fidelity]], [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Barclays]], [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], [[Lazard]], [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons]], [[UBS]], [[RBC Capital Markets]], [[Leonardo &amp; Co.]] and [[Jefferies]], the central banks [[European Central Bank]] and [[Deutsche Bundesbank]] in addition to leading consulting firms such as [[Bain &amp; Company]], [[Boston Consulting Group]], [[McKinsey &amp; Co.]], [[Roland Berger Strategy Consultants]], [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], [[L.E.K. Consulting]], [[strategy&amp;]]. Further cooperating companies are [[Ernst &amp; Young]], [[Perella Weinberg Partners]], Blackstone, [[3i|3I]], [[Fresenius]] and [[BASF SE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akboerse.de/events/archiv/|title=Event archives of Arbeitskreis Börse|accessdate=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lectures ===
In cooperation with several company partners the Arbeitskreis Börse organizes an extensive lecture series every semester, composed of up to 12 company presentations and technical lectures concerned with current topics from the financial community and industry. To do so, companies from the fields of [[investment banking]], [[asset management]], [[consulting]] and [[auditing]] are invited to create a thought provoking presentation that explores various points of view. The lectures demonstrate relationships between the latest case studies and theoretical foundations from academia as well as findings from their business applications. At the following get-together with snacks and drinks students have the opportunity to get in personal contact with the speakers, to discuss specialist topics and ask questions regarding internships and career options.&lt;ref name="Startseite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akboerse.de/start/|title=akboerse.de|accessdate=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Workshops ===
Similar to this, the Arbeitskreis Börse, in cooperation with company partners organises numerous workshops every semester. Case studies offer a rare opportunity to gain better insight into specific business divisions and to analyse complex business matters. After the presentation of results, students come into contact with employees and are able ask specific questions and acquire information about a potential career within these companies. Getting to know preferences and strengths during the workshops makes it easier for a single business division or a certain enterprise to make a decision.&lt;ref name="Startseite" /&gt;

=== Working groups ===
Another task of the Arbeitskreis Börse is to transmit knowledge in Excel and Bloomberg and to encourage active discussions with problems from the area of finance industry and management consultancy. Students can meet weekly to acquire and deepen fundamental knowledge in the respective subject areas under instruction from experienced Alumni to be optimally prepared for internships and entry into the workforce. To advanced students, a platform to discuss highly demanding problems is offered. The knowledge acquired in the working groups is indispensable for future entry into financial business.&lt;ref name="Startseite" /&gt;

=== Social events ===
During each semester, numerous social events take place, which promote cohesion among members and help familiarise students with recently joined fellow students as well provide a temporary escape from stressful university life. Thus the students become part of a large community that outlasts their time at university and allows Alumni to return to Mannheim annually.&lt;ref name="Startseite" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2631">'''Blow-Fill-Seal''' (BFS) technology is a manufacturing technique used to produce small, (0.1mL) and large volume, (500mL +) liquid-filled containers. Originally developed in [[Europe]] in the 1930s, it was introduced in the [[United States]] in the 1960s, but over the last 20 years it has become more prevalent within the [[pharmaceutical industry]] and is now widely considered to be the superior form of [[aseptic processing]] by various medicine regulatory agencies including the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in the packaging of pharmaceutical and healthcare products. 

The basic concept of BFS is that a container is formed, filled, and sealed in a continuous process without human intervention, in a [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] enclosed area inside a machine. Thus this technology can be used to [[aseptic]]ally manufacture sterile pharmaceutical liquid dosage forms. 

The process is multi-stepped: first, pharmaceutical-grade plastic resin is vertically heat extruded through a circular throat to form a hanging tube called the [[parison]]. This extruded tube is then enclosed within a two-part mould, and the tube is cut above the mould.  The mould is transferred to the filling zone, or sterile filling space, where filling needles ([[mandrel]]s) are lowered and used to inflate the plastic to form the container within the mould. Following the formation of the container, the [[mandrel]] is used to fill the container with liquid. Following filling the mandrels are retracted and a secondary top mould seals the container. All actions take place inside a sterile shrouded chamber inside the machine. The product is then discharged to a non-sterile area for labeling, packaging and distribution. 

Blow-fill-seal technology reduces personnel intervention making it a more robust method for the aseptic preparation of sterile pharmaceuticals. BFS is used for the filling of vials for [[wikt:parenteral|parenteral]] preparations and infusions, [[eye drops]], and [[inhalation]] products. Generally the plastic containers are made up of [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]]. Polypropylene is more commonly used to form containers which are further sterilised by [[autoclaving]] as polypropylene has greater thermostability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32914">The '''chocolate industry in the [[Philippines]]''' evidences the [[Agriculture|agricultural]] roots of the Philippine society. The growing of [[Cocoa bean|cacao or cocoa]] boasts a long history stretching from the [[Spanish Colonial Era (Philippines)|colonial]] times. Originating from [[Mesoamerica]]n forests, cacao was first introduced by the [[Spanish Colonization of the Philippines|Spanish colonizers]] four centuries ago.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Peace and Equity Foundation. ''[http://pef.ph/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Industry-Study_Cacao.pdf A primer on PEF’s Priority Commodities: an Industry Study on Cacao].'' Philippines, 2016. 2. Accessed June 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the Philippine cocoa industry has been the primary producer of cocoa beans in the [[Southeast Asia]]. There are many areas of production of cacao in the Philippines, owing to its agriculture. The [[chocolate]] industry is currently on a small to medium scale.

== Etymology, history and development ==
{{See also|History of chocolate}}

=== Local terms ===
The word “[[chocolate]]” as we know it today was spelled in different ways throughout time, in different ways such as “chocalatall,” “jocolatte,” “jacolatte,” and “chockelet.” It is a derivative of the word ''cacahuatl'' or ''xocoatl'', a bitter drink the Aztecs brewed from cacao beans mixed with spices, wine, and other local ingredients that can be traced back to Pre-Columbian Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Boynton, Sandra. Chocolate: The Consuming Passion. New York: Workman, 2015. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cacahuatl'' is an amalgamation of the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] words ''kaj'' and ''kab'', which translates to “bitter juice.” The suffix ''-atl'' that means water or liquid was added to ''kajkab'', forming ''kajkabatl,'' and then later ''kajkabhuatl'' with the insertion of the diphthong ''hu''.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, Frederick. Turrialba (1960)  [https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=_ol0KGWC-f4C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13 Cacao Manual]. Costa Rica: Inter-American Institute of Agricultural Sciences, 1960. p. 13. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cacao tree, whose scientific Latin name given by Swedish botanist [[Carl Linnaeus|Carolus Linnaeus]] in 1753 is ''[[Theobroma cacao]]'', is one of the 22 ''Theobroma'' species. ''Theobroma'' means “food for the Gods", from the Greek words ''theo'' (god) and ''broma'' (food). This species is utilized as raw materials for pharmaceutical products and cosmetics, however, cacao is primarily used for the production of chocolate and cocoa by processing the beans.

[[File:Champorado2.jpg|thumb|[[Champorado]] is a sweet chocolate rice [[porridge]] in [[Philippine cuisine]].]]

In the [[Filipino language]], chocolate is translated as ''tsokolate'', which is also a hot chocolate drink made from ''tablea''. ''Tablea'' are cacao tablets made from roasted and ground cacao nibs molded into rounds or tablets traditionally used in the Philippines for making hot chocolate. A ''batirol'', a wooden whisk-like instrument, is the Filipino adaptation of the Spanish word ''batidor'' that is utilized by rubbing the stick back and forth between one's palms in order to thoroughly mix hot water with the tablet in a chocolatera to make it frothy. The result is ''tsokolate de batirol'', a thick, creamy, hot chocolate drink, otherwise referred to as ''sikawate'' in the Visayas region.

''Tablea'' is also used in the production of ''[[champorado]]'', among many other cacao delicacies. Otherwise referred to as ''tsamporado,'' it is a sweet, rice porridge dish in the Philippines enjoyed by many hot or cold, usually partnered with dried fish, either ''tuyo'' or ''daing''.

=== Origin of cacao in the Philippines ===

The cacao plant was primarily brought to the Philippines in the 1700s when a [[Galleon|Spanish galleon]] from [[Mexico]]&lt;ref&gt;Blanco, Manuel, and Andrés Naves. Flora De Filipinas. Manila: Plana, 1877. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; transported pure [[Criollo (cocoa bean)|Criollo]], considered to be one of the best kinds of cacao, from [[Mesoamerica]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. Although cacao trees were originally grown in Mexico and Central America, the Philippines became an ideal cultivation grounds for cacao because of its geography as a tropical rainforest located 10-15 degrees from the Earth's Equator, with the cacao belt located within 20 degrees of the Equator. Today, cacao trees are cultivated throughout equatorial region including the Caribbean, Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands of Samoa and New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sfu.ca/geog351fall03/groups-webpages/gp8/history/history.html "History of Chocolate"]. The World Atlas of Chocolate. N.p., n.d. Web. 08 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Key areas for production of Cacao ===
'''Batangas'''

Although the province of [[Batangas]] only accounts for 0.47 metric tons of cacao production {{as of|2016|lc=y}},&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystat.psa.gov.ph/?cont=10&amp;pageid=1&amp;ma=A60PNVOP|title=Production|last=|first=|date=|website=CountrySTAT Philippines|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is well known for its ''tsokolate'' ''tablea'' or chocolate tablets which are considered one of its delicacies and is often used to make traditional Filipino hot chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.batangas-philippines.com/tablea-tsokolate.html.|title=Tablea Tsokolate or Cacao Chocolate.|last=|first=|date=|website=Batangas Philippines A Destination For Travelers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cebu'''

Cebu along with other [[Central Visayas]] provinces contribute only around 1% of cacao production in the country, however, in terms of producing world-class and award-winning chocolate, Cebu is known for producing quality cacao.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/cebu/business/2016/05/27/growing-cacao-cebu-475932|title=Growing cacao in Cebu|last=Galolo|first=Jeandie|date=May 26, 2016|work=SunStar Cebu|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are currently less than a hundred farmer associations, cooperatives, and individual growers planting on an estimated 2,000 hectares in Cebu, the province aims to have a greater share in cacao production.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The province is home to ''criollo'' or the “cacao bisaya,” which is a superior quality cacao that has a strong, aromatic bittersweet taste and rich texture.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://business.inquirer.net/209001/cacao-phs-hidden-treasure-goes-luxe|title=Cacao, PH’s ‘hidden treasure,’ goes luxe|last=Olchondra|first=Riza|date=March 30, 2016|work=Inquirer|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also home to Ralfe Gourmet, The Chocolate Chamber, and Casa de Cacao headed by Raquel Choa who is known for elevating Philippine cacao-based products.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Davao Region'''

== Chocolate industry in the Philippines ==

=== Industry background ===
Cacao, which originated from [[South America]]n forests, is the source material of chocolate products. However, modern cacao is mostly produced by African and European countries such as the [[Cocoa production in Ivory Coast|Ivory Coast]], [[Germany]] and [[Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;Peace and Equity Foundation.

The Philippine cacao industry consists mostly of smallholder farmers who supply medium-scale manufacturers.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cacao / Tablea|url=http://industry.gov.ph/industry/cacao-tablea/|website=Securing the Future of Philippine Industries|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, domestic production is insufficient; local cacao demand outweighs the cacao supply both locally and globally. One major factor that affects caco production in the country is "the lack of post-harvest knowledge, equipment, and facilities to ensure bean quality for chocolate manufacturing." &lt;ref&gt;Peace and Equity Foundation. ''[http://pef.ph/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Industry-Study_Cacao.pdf A primer on PEF’s Priority Commodities: an Industry Study on Cacao].'' Philippines, 2016. 3. Accessed June 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Since that is the case, cacao exports are far less than country's imports. The Department of Trade and Industry Reports that in 2012, cacao imports amounted to 3,662 tons, while cacao exports amounted to only 512 tons.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Growing market opportunity for ''tablea'' ====
Recent increase in the number of cafes and restaurants offering chocolate or chocolate-based drinks provided for the relative rise of tablea market opportunities. In addition to that, healthy lifestyle trends in the past years contributed to this gradual increase of demand.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This is seen as a good sign of possible profit translation for cacao farmers and manufacturers.

=== Industry size ===
==== Philippine market ====
Philippine chocolate market is dominated by both local and [[international]] companies. The three largest companies in the Philippines processing cocoa are [[Universal Robina]], Commonwealth Foods, and Goya—all of which are located within Metro Manila.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Also contributing to the chocolate market in the country are several well-known commercial brands such as [[Nestlé]], [[The Hershey Company|Hershey's]], and [[Cadbury]] Adams.

=== Local manufacturers ===

==== Universal Robina Corp.  ====
[[Universal Robina|Universal Robina Corporation]] (URC) is one of the largest food and beverage manufacturers in the Philippines. They became famous for their instant coffee mix which catered towards Filipinos. They are also the company behind the Jack ‘n Jill brand which currently produces 26 snack products under its name. The Jack ‘n Jill products are classified into 3 categories namely Salty Snacks, Bakery, Confectionery. URC is one of the heaviest consumers of chocolate because majority of their Bakery and Confectionery snacks incorporate chocolate.  URC's first breakthrough chocolate product was the Nips. The candy coated chocolate, similar to the famous M&amp;M's, which was popular among kids. This was successfully followed by multiple chocolate products such as the chocolate covered marshmallow, Wiggles; the chewy butterscotch caramel, Chooey Choco; the chocolate coated nougat bar, Cloud 9.

==== Commonwealth Food Inc. ====
Commonwealth Food Incorporated is a multiproduct Philippine based company that produces coffee, chocolate, and biscuit products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pana.com.ph/directories/commonwealth-foods-inc/ |title=COMMONWEALTH FOODS, INC. &amp;#124; Philippine Association of National Advertisers – PANA Website |publisher=Pana.com.ph |date= |accessdate=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their chocolate production is overseen by the Philippine Food Industries Incorporated branch which is also known as the Philfood division. They are responsible for producing natural cocoa powder which does not go through Dutch-process procedures. They also produce chocolate syrup, mint-candy covered chocolate, Kool Joy; chocolate candy, Flat tops; and Cocoa Butter. They have reached consumers abroad by supplying cocoa butter to consumers from the United States of America and Europe. Commonwealth Food Incorporated also has a division that produces biscuits. The Fibisco Biscuit Corporation is responsible for the production of Filipino-favorite chocolate snacks such as the Choco Mallows, Hi-ro, and Chocolate Chip cookies.

=== Future of Philippine chocolate industry ===
The supply of cocoa has fluctuated in recent years due to climate and economic factors. The [[El Niño|El Nino]] phenomenon that hit in the year 2009 greatly reduced the cocoa production in the following years. The extreme weather conditions added to the impending financial crises to limit both the supply and demand for cocoa. Cocoa supply is still decreasing even if the demand is rising. Many entrepreneurs and governments have been looking into cocoa production recently as demand for chocolate rises. They are looking to compete with the top producer of the plant which is Africa. They produce more than 70% of the global cocoa supply. On the other hand, Netherlands and United States of America are the largest consumers of cocoa beans; both consuming Billions of U.S Dollars' worth of the product.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

According to the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database, the Philippines has shifted from a massive importer of cocoa beans into a steady exporter of the bean. Entrepreneurs had seen the potential of the cocoa bean industry.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The increase in demand and the falling supply was obvious to them, therefore giving them the idea of planting many hectares of the plant. The Philippine government has also been encouraging the citizens to grow cocoa beans because of the shortage. They are assisting farmers and the industry by supplying land and tested procedures in order to increase the Philippine production of cocoa beans.&lt;ref&gt;Quiros, Judy. "Shortage of cacao both a threat and an opportunity." Inquirer, June 15, 2013. Accessed June 26, 2017. Shortage of cacao both a threat and an opportunity.&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippines has the right climate and soil for the cocoa tree which leaves the government the problem of spreading the knowledge on how to plant and harvest for cocoa.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Currently, they are making steady efforts to compete with other cocoa producers. The Philippine government is preparing for the cocoa shortage by the year 2020 and aims to increase production to 100,000 Metric Tons.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, Nielberg (February 12, 2013). [http://www.confectionerynews.com/Commodities/Philippines-as-an-emerging-quality-cocoa-origin "Philippines as an emerging 'quality' cocoa origin"]. Accessed June 25, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Philippines is failing to meet the local demand of 30,000 Metric Tons, the strong effort and government support is sure to make an impact in years to come.

== Cocoa production in the Philippines ==
In the Philippines, [[Cocoa bean|Cacao or cocoa beans]] are produced in many locations. These include [[Luzon]], [[Mindanao]], [[Jolo|Joló]], [[Basilan]], [[Panay]], [[Negros (Philippines)|Negros]], [[Cebu|Cebú]], [[Bohol]], [[Masbate]] and many more.{{sfn|Lyon|1902|p=5}} Cocoa also refers to [[Cocoa solids|cocoa powder]] and [[cocoa butter]], which are two by-products of the cacao bean after it has undergone processing.{{sfn|Juan|2013|p=16}} Cocoa and [[chocolate]] processing was first introduced in the country by Commonwealth Foods Inc. (ComFoods) in 1953, while Serg's Chocolate Products Inc. became the first modern chocolate manufacturing plant in [[Southeast Asia]]. {{sfn|Juan|2013|p=31}}

=== Process ===

==== Planting and farming ====
For planting cacao in the Philippines, there are currently 9 registered and approved varieties by the National Seed Industry of the Council of the Bureau of Plant Industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://businessdiary.com.ph/2191/cacao-production-guide/ "Growing Cacao - Cacao Production Guide | Business Diary Ph."] Your Business Diary. April 30, 2017. Accessed July 07, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  These are based on high productivity, quality of the bean, consumer acceptability and resistance to pests and diseases. [[Soil]] requirements include good soil structure, which is deep and well-drained, but with sufficient water-holding capacity.{{sfn|Juan|2013|p=39}} Clay loam soil with an aggregate of [[sand]], [[silt]] and [[clay]] work best due to its large pore spaces which "promote [[aeration]], [[drainage]], and moisture retention". Organic matter in the surface layer or soil is also important to cacao growth so the soil must be well-shaded to preserve the organic layer.&lt;ref&gt;Peace and Equity Foundation. ''[http://pef.ph/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Industry-Study_Cacao.pdf A primer on PEF’s Priority Commodities: an Industry Study on Cacao]''. Philippines, 2016. 11. Accessed June 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Ideal rainfall and climate on the other hand is between 1,250 and 3,000&amp;nbsp;mm per annum, 1,500 to 2,000&amp;nbsp;mm in the dry season of not more than 3 months, and a temperature from 18 degrees to 32 degrees Celsius. This suitable temperature can be found in altitudes up to 700 meters or in areas between 300 and 1,200 meters above sea level.{{sfn|Juan|2013|p=39}} Because Cacao prefers a moisture-laden atmosphere, a climate of evenly distributed rainfall and few winds are ideal. {{sfn|Lyon|1902|p=6}}

After the seeds are selected carefully from highly productive trees which pest-free and disease-free, seeds are planted immediately either “at stake”, controlled seed beds, pots, or nurseries before they are transplanted to [[plantation]]s.{{sfn|Lyon|1902|p=11}} When field soils are forest land with good organic matter, [[tillage]] is not necessary. However, if the cacao is to be planted with other [[cash crop]]s, a more thorough preparation, which includes [[Plough|plowing]] and [[Harrow (tool)|harrowing]] the land, is needed. Roads, drainage, and shade trees are also established. Based on studies about distancing, cacao is generally planted in the following: cacao laid in rows 2 meters apart if open areas, 2.5 meters away from the base if under [[Coconut|coconut trees]], close planting followed by thinning, or 3 by 3 meters or 3 by 4 meters apart.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Peace and Equity Foundation. ''[http://pef.ph/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Industry-Study_Cacao.pdf A primer on PEF’s Priority Commodities: an Industry Study on Cacao].'' Philippines, 2016. 12. Accessed June 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although trees raised from seeds are still practiced, grafted, budded, or asexually propagated cacao seedlings are now also practiced.{{sfn|Juan|2013|p=40}}

==== Pruning ====
[[Pruning]] is generally done with great care using a sharp saw during [[wikipedia:Dry season|dry season]], when branches have come out, or after harvest as to control the height of the tree and facilitate the work. The first pruning, which is done to control the height of where the first branch is formed, is generally at least 5 feet, so as not to hinder harvesting and maintenance. When five or more branches have grown, weak branches are pruned, leaving only "three or four well-developed branches". The surfaces with cuts are then painted with coal tar or lead paint so as to protect the cuts from diseases or pests.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Peace and Equity Foundation. [http://pef.ph/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Industry-Study_Cacao.pdf ''A primer on PEF’s Priority Commodities: an Industry Study on Cacao''.] Philippines, 2016. 13. Accessed June 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nutrition and fertilizers ====
The health of cacao trees are examined based on soil and leaf analyses. Mineral deficiencies are documented to determine [[fertilizer]] requirements. {{sfn|Juan|2013|p=42}} Fertilizers are applied on Cacao around two to three months after transplanting and are increased in the second, third and fourth year of a tree. The fertilizers used on Cacao include [[Ammonium sulfate]], Single superphosphate, [[Potassium sulfate]], and [[Magnesium sulfate]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Harvesting ====
Cacao pods are [[harvest]]ed as soon as they are [[Ripening|ripe]] or mature. The ripening period of cacao generally happens during dry season and can be determined either by the aroma of chocolate that pervades the plantation or the changing of pod color wherein they turn reddish or yellow according to the variety. {{sfn|Lyon|1902|p=17}} The pods are harvested using a sharp instrument such as a knife and are cut as close to the stem as possible. This is done with utmost care so as not to damage the flower cushions, pods, and tree itself. Infested pods are removed. About four harvest cycles with 10 to 21 days intervals are generally made per season.

==== Sorting and grading ====
[[Sorting]] and grading will enhance bean quality. When the beans have completely dried, they are sorted and graded to remove flat, slaty, black, moldy, small, double beans and beans with insect damage.{{sfn|Juan|2013|p=48}} Beans are usually graded based on proportion of defective beans indicated by the Philippine National Standards for Cacao or Cocoa Beans. These processing and manufacturing guidelines successfully ensure quality before they are shipped or handled.&lt;ref&gt;Peace and Equity Foundation. ''[http://pef.ph/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Industry-Study_Cacao.pdf A primer on PEF’s Priority Commodities: an Industry Study on Cacao.]'' Philippines, 2016. 17. Accessed June 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Packaging and storage ====
The dried cocoa beans are packed in bags made of [[Food contact materials|food-grade]] or [[Non-toxic|non-toxic materials]] such as [[Jute|jute bags]] or sacks that an imprint of the label, production number, date, the grade of the beans, code of the cooperative, farmer or area. They are stored in weatherproof, well ventilated, free from moisture, insects, or any other factor that can [[contaminate]] the cacao. {{sfn|Juan|2013|p=49}}

=== Output ===
After the seeds are shipped to different [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]], they are used for making cocoa powder, cocoa butter, the processing of tablea([[Chocolate liquor|cocoa liquor]]) and other chocolate products such as liquid chocolate, and chocolate bars. Tablea and cocoa powder are also used to create a variety of products such as hot chocolate, champorado, tablea de cacao cupcakes, tablea brownies, krinkles etc.

For chocolate bar flavors, [[Filipinos|Filipino]] chocolate [[brand]]s such as Theo and Philo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoandphilo.com/products.htm|title=Theo and Philo Products|last=|first=|date=|website=Theo and Philo|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://risa.ph/category/barsbarks/|title=Barks &amp; Bars|last=|first=|date=|website=Risa|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CocoDolce,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freefoodco.com/products|title=Welcome to our selection of healthy products- all natural organic, coconut sap sugar &amp; nectar and delicious chocolates|last=|first=|date=|website=Freefood.co|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kablon, and others, offer unique flavors that include [[Chili pepper|chili]], [[mango]], [[calamansi]], [[Kapeng barako|barako coffee]], [[Philippine adobo|adobo]], [[Canarium ovatum|pili nuts]], [[pastillas]], [[bacon]], [[Turon (food)|turon]], and [[coconut]].

'''Collaborative software''' or '''groupware''' is [[application software]] designed to help people involved in a common task to achieve their  goals. One of the earliest definitions of collaborative software is "intentional group processes plus software to support them".&lt;ref name="Johnson-Lenz"&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson-Lenz|first=Peter|title=Rhythms, Boundaries, and Containers|url=http://nexus.awakentech.com:8080/at/awaken1.nsf/UNIDs/CFB70C1957A686E98825654000699E1B?OpenDocument|publisher=Awakening Technology|date=30 April 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the level of interaction it allows, collaborative software may be divided into: [[real-time collaborative editing]] (RTCE) platforms that allow multiple users to engage in live, simultaneous and reversible editing of a single file (usually a document),  and [[version control]] (also known as revision control and source control) platforms, which allow separate users to make parallel edits to a file, while preserving every saved edit by every user as multiple files (that are variants of the original file).

Collaborative software is a broad concept that overlaps considerably with [[computer-supported cooperative work]] (CSCW). According to Carstensen and Schmidt (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carstensen |first1=P.H.|last2= Schmidt|first2= K. |year=1999 |title= Computer supported cooperative work: new challenges to systems design |url= http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/carstensen99computer.html |publisher=Citeseer.ist.psu.edu |accessdate= 2007-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; groupware is part of CSCW. The authors claim that CSCW, and thereby groupware, addresses "how collaborative activities and their coordination can be supported by means of computer systems." Software products such as email, calendaring, [[text chat]], [[wiki]], and [[Enterprise bookmarking|bookmarking]] belong to this category whenever used for group work,{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} whereas the more general term [[social software]] applies to systems used outside the workplace, for example, [[online dating service]]s and [[social networking site]]s like [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]].

The use of collaborative software in the work space creates a [[collaborative working environment]] (CWE).

Finally, collaborative software relates to the notion of [[collaborative work systems]], which are conceived as any form of human organization that emerges any time that collaboration takes place, whether it is formal or informal, intentional or unintentional.&lt;ref&gt;Beyerlein, M; Freedman, S.; McGee, G.; Moran, L. (2002). [http://media.johnwiley.com.au/product_data/excerpt/39/07879637/0787963739.pdf Beyond Teams: Building the Collaborative Organization]. The Collaborative Work Systems series, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the groupware or collaborative software pertains to the technological elements of computer-supported cooperative work, collaborative work systems become a useful analytical tool to understand the behavioral and organizational variables that are associated to the broader concept of CSCW.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, P. (1991). Computer Supported Cooperative Work: An Introduction. Kluwer Academic Pub. {{ISBN|978-0792314462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aparicio, M and Costa, C.

[[Douglas Engelbart]] first envisioned collaborative computing in 1951 and documented his vision in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework], Douglas C. Engelbart, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; with [[NLS (computer system)|working prototypes]] in full operational use by his research team by the mid-1960s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3954.html A Research Center for Augmenting Human Intellect], Douglas C. Engelbart and William K. English, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; and held the first public demonstration of his work in 1968 in what is now referred to as "[[The Mother of All Demos]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/firsts/dougs-1968-demo.html |title=1968 Demo Overview and Links to Video |publisher=Dougengelbart.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Engelbart's lab was hooked into the [[ARPANET]], the first computer network, enabling them to extend services to a broader userbase.

Online collaborative gaming software began between early networked computer users. In 1975, [[Will Crowther]] created [[Colossal Cave Adventure]] on a [[DEC PDP-10]] computer. As internet connections grew, so did the numbers of users and multi-user games. In 1978 [[Roy Trubshaw]], a student at [[University of Essex]] in the United Kingdom, created the game MUD (Multi-User Dungeon).

The US Government began using truly collaborative applications in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=99362&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;coll=GUIDE&amp;CFID=107391064&amp;CFTOKEN=53017578 |title=Learning from user experience with groupware |doi=10.1145/99332.99362 |publisher=Portal.acm.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first robust applications was the Navy's Common Operational Modeling, Planning and Simulation Strategy (COMPASS).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.cwid.js.mil/public/CWIDFctShtSuccesses21Mar08.doc Heritage of Delivering Successful Warfighting Solutions]&lt;/ref&gt; The COMPASS system allowed up to 6 users to create point-to-point connections with one another; the collaborative session only remained while at least one user stayed active, and would have to be recreated if all six logged out. MITRE improved on that model by hosting the collaborative session on a server that each user logged into. Called the Collaborative Virtual Workstation (CVW), this allowed the session to be set up in a virtual file cabinet and virtual rooms, and left as a persistent session that could be joined later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark_Maybury/publication/220423771_Expert_Finding_for_Collaborative_Virtual_Environments/links/00b495295de7a430ec000000.pdf?disableCoverPage=true Collaborative virtual environments for analysis and decision support], Mark Mayburry&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[Pavel Curtis]], who had built MUDs at [[PARC (company)|PARC]], created PlaceWare, a server that simulated a one-to-many auditorium, with side chat between "seat-mates", and the ability to invite a limited number of audience members to speak. In 1997, engineers at [[GTE]] used the PlaceWare engine in a commercial version of MITRE's CVW, calling it InfoWorkSpace (IWS). In 1998, IWS was chosen as the military standard for the standardized Air Operations Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ezenia.com/news/infoworkspace-saves-lives-in-iraq/|title = (Press Release)  InfoWorkSpace saves lives in Iraq - Ezenia!, Inc|publisher = Ezenia.com|date = |accessdate = 2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IWS product was sold to [[General Dynamics]] and then later to Ezenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ezenia.com/products/products-infoworkspace/|title = (Press Release)  InfoWorkSpace - Ezenia!, Inc|publisher = Ezenia.com|date = |accessdate = 2014-06-25|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140527023159/http://www.ezenia.com/products/products-infoworkspace/|archivedate = 2014-05-27|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Groupware==
Collaborative software was originally designated as ''groupware'' and this term can be traced as far back as the late 1980s, when Richman and Slovak (1987)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Richman|first1= Louis S |last2= Slovak |first2=Julianne |date=June 8, 1987 |title= SOFTWARE CATCHES THE TEAM SPIRIT New computer programs may soon change the way groups of people work together -- and start delivering the long-awaited payoff from office automation.fouttoune |publisher=Money.cnn.com |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1987/06/08/69109/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:

{{quote|"Like an electronic sinew that binds teams together, the new ''groupware'' aims to place the computer squarely in the middle of communications among managers, technicians, and anyone else who interacts in groups, revolutionizing the way they work."}}

Even further back, in 1978 Peter and Trudy Johnson-Lenz coined the term groupware; their initial 1978  definition of groupware was, “intentional group processes plus software to support them.” Later in their article they went on to explain groupware as “computer-mediated culture... an embodiment of social organization in hyperspace." Groupware integrates co-evolving human and tool systems, yet is simply a single system.&lt;ref name="Johnson-Lenz"/&gt;

In the early 1990s the first commercial groupware products were delivered, and big companies such as [[Boeing]] and [[IBM]] started using electronic meeting systems for key internal projects. [[IBM Lotus Notes|Lotus Notes]] appeared as a major example of that product category, allowing remote group collaboration when the internet was still in its infancy. Kirkpatrick and Losee (1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kirkpatrick |first1=D. |last2=Losee |first2=S. |date=March 23, 1992 |title= HERE COMES THE PAYOFF FROM PCs New network software lets brainstormers around a table all ''talk'' at once on their keyboards. The result: measurable productivity gains from desktop computing |url= http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1992/03/23/76204/index.htm |publisher=Money.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote then:

{{quote|"If GROUPWARE really makes a difference in productivity long term, the very definition of an office may change. You will be able to work efficiently as a member of a group wherever you have your computer. As computers become smaller and more powerful, that will mean anywhere."}}

===Design and implementation issues===
The complexity of groupware development is still an issue. One reason for this is the socio-technical dimension of groupware. Groupware designers do not only have to address technical issues (as in traditional software development) but also consider the organizational aspects &lt;ref&gt;D'Atri A., De Marco M., Casalino N. (2008). “Interdisciplinary Aspects of Information Systems Studies”, pp. 1-416, Physica-Verlag, Springer, Germany, Doi 10.1007/978-3-7908-2010-2  {{ISBN|978-3-7908-2009-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the social group processes that should be supported with the groupware application. Some examples for issues in groupware development are:

*Persistence is needed in some sessions. Chat and voice communications are routinely non-persistent and evaporate at the end of the session. Virtual room and online file cabinets can persist for years. The designer of the collaborative space needs to consider the information duration needs and implement accordingly.
*Authentication has always been a problem with groupware. When connections are made point-to-point, or when log-in registration is enforced, it's clear who is engaged in the session. However, audio and unmoderated sessions carry the risk of unannounced 'lurkers' who observe but do not announce themselves or contribute.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130605033257/http://www.mitre.org/news/the_edge/june_98/transfer.html A Case Study in Technology Transfer of Collaboration Tools]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130912234901/http://www.mitre.org/news/the_edge/june_98/second.html Collaborating securely - Can it be done?]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Until recently, bandwidth issues at fixed location limited full use of the tools. These are exacerbated with mobile devices.
*Multiple input and output streams bring concurrency issues into the groupware applications.
*Motivational issues are important, especially in settings where no pre-defined group process was in place.
*Closely related to the motivation aspect is the question of reciprocity. [[Clarence Ellis (computer scientist)|Ellis]] and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Clarence A. |last1=Ellis|first2= Simon J. |last2=Gibbs |first3= Gail |last3=Rein|year= 1991 |title=Groupware: some issues and experiences. |DOI=10.1145/99977.99987 |volume=34 |journal=Communications of the ACM |pages=39–58|url=http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~tar/DBC/groupware-ellis.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that the distribution of efforts and benefits has to be carefully balanced in order to ensure that all required group members really participate.
*Real-time communication via groupware can lead to a lot of noise, over-communication and information overload.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

One approach for addressing these issues is the use of design patterns for groupware design.&lt;ref&gt;Till Schümmer and Stephan Lukosch. 2007. Patterns for Computer-Mediated Interaction (Wiley Software Patterns Series). John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|978-0-470-02561-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patterns identify recurring groupware design issues and discuss design choices in a way that all stakeholders can participate in the groupware development process.

==Groupware and levels of collaboration==
Groupware can be divided into three categories depending on the level of [[collaboration]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intranetjournal.com/faq/lotusbible.html |title=Groupware - Communication, Collaboration and Coordination |publisher=Lotus Development Corporation |date= |year=1995 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713051554/http://www.intranetjournal.com/faq/lotusbible.html |archivedate=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Casalino N., Draoli M. (2009), “Governance and Organizational Aspects of an Experimental Groupware in the Italian Public Administration to Support Multi-Institutional Partnerships”, in Information Systems: People, Organizations, Institutions, and Trchnologies, D’Atri A., Saccà D. (Eds.), Physica-Verlag, Springer, Heidelberg, Germany, pp. 81-89, {{ISBN|978-3-7908-2147-5}}, doi 10.1007/978-3-7908-2148-2_11&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Communication''' can be thought of as unstructured interchange of information. A phone call or an [[Instant Messaging|IM]] Chat discussion are examples of this.
# '''Conferencing''' (or collaboration level, as it is called in the academic papers that discuss these levels) refers to interactive work toward a shared goal. Brainstorming or voting are examples of this.
# '''Co-ordination''' refers to complex interdependent work toward a shared goal. A good metaphor for understanding this is to think about a sports team; everyone has to contribute the right play at the right time as well as adjust their play to the unfolding situation - but everyone is doing something different - in order for the team to win. That is complex interdependent work toward a shared goal: collaborative management.

===Collaborative management (coordination) tools===
Collaborative management tools facilitate and manage group activities. Examples include:
* [[Electronic calendar]]s (also called [[time management]] software) &amp;mdash; schedule events and automatically notify and remind group members
* [[Project management]] systems &amp;mdash; schedule, track, and chart the steps in a project as it is being completed
* [[Online proofing]] &amp;mdash; share, review, approve, and reject web proofs, artwork, photos, or videos between designers, customers, and clients
* [[Workflow system]]s &amp;mdash; collaborative management of tasks and documents within a knowledge-based business process
* [[Knowledge management software|Knowledge management systems]] &amp;mdash; collect, organize, manage, and share various forms of information
* [[Enterprise bookmarking]] &amp;mdash; collaborative bookmarking engine to tag, organize, share, and search enterprise data
* [[Prediction market]]s &amp;mdash; let a group of people predict together the outcome of future events
* [[Extranet]] systems (sometimes also known as 'project extranets') &amp;mdash; collect, organize, manage and share information associated with the delivery of a project (e.g.: the construction of a building)
* [[Intranet]] systems &amp;mdash; quickly share company information to members within a company via Internet (e.g.: marketing and product info)&lt;ref name="Intranet"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaffey|first1=Dave|title=Groupware, Workflow, and Intranets: Reengineering the Enterprise with Collaborative Software|date=1998|publisher=Digital Press|location=Boston|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Social software]] systems &amp;mdash; organize social relations of groups
* [[Online spreadsheet]]s &amp;mdash; collaborate and share structured data and information
* [[Client portal]]s &amp;mdash; interact and share with your clients in a private online environment{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Collaborative software and human interaction==
The design intent of collaborative software (groupware) is to transform the way documents and [[rich media]] are shared in order to enable more effective team collaboration.

Collaboration, with respect to information technology, seems to have several definitions. Some are defensible but others are so broad they lose any meaningful application. Understanding the differences in human interactions is necessary to ensure the appropriate technologies are employed to meet interaction needs.

There are three primary ways in which humans interact: conversations, transactions, and collaborations.

''Conversational interaction'' is an exchange of information between two or more participants where the primary purpose of the interaction is discovery or relationship building. There is no central entity around which the interaction revolves but is a free exchange of information with no defined constraints, generally focused on personal experiences.&lt;ref name="iSchool"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dunbar|first1=R. I.|last2=Marriott|first2=A.|last3=Duncan|first3=N. D.|title=Human conversational behavior|journal=Human Nature : An Interdisciplinary Biosocial Perspective|date=1997|volume=8|issue=3|pages=231–246|doi=10.1007/BF02912493|accessdate=3 December 2014|url=http://medisch-fitness.com/documents/75procentdagelijksegesprekkenbestedenweaanroddelen.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication technology such as telephones, [[instant messaging]], and e-mail are generally sufficient for conversational interactions.

''Transactional interaction'' involves the exchange of transaction entities where a major function of the transaction entity is to alter the relationship between participants.

In ''collaborative interactions'' the main function of the participants' relationship is to alter a collaboration entity (i.e., the converse of transactional). When teams collaborate on projects it is called [[Collaborative project management]].

It was established in 1965 to perform all contract [[audit]]s for the Department of Defense. Previously, the various branches of military service were responsible for their own contract audits.

The DCAA's duties include financial and accounting advisory services for the Department of Defense in connection with negotiation, administration and settlement of contracts and subcontracts.

==Early history==
The Defense Contract Audit Agency was established on January 8, 1965. Previously, the various branches of the military were responsible for their own contract audits and there was little consistency in contract administration and auditing.&lt;ref name="Orientation" /&gt;

The first efforts to perform joint audits began with the U.S. Navy and Army Air Corps in 1939. Audit coordination committees were formed by the Navy and Army Air Corps in December 1942 for contracts involving more than one service branch.  A single contract audit manual was issued on June 18, 1952, serving the three military service branches existing at that time.  However, writing standard guidelines was difficult, due to differences in the organization and practice of procurement between the services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BJaJ9a-fkpEC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=contract+audit+manual+1952&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c0MUtispje&amp;sig=-SK8AtHA66JClPHP6ROXYNKlCQ4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EgnAVJaCBMScNuaBg8AJ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=contract%20audit%20manual%201952&amp;f=false|title=Contract Audits: Role in Helping Ensure Effective Oversight and Reducing Improper Payments|work=GAO Highlights|publisher=U.S. General Accounting Office|page=5|date=February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defense contract audits became the responsibility of a single agency, the DCAA, in response to a feasibility study directed by Secretary of Defense [[Robert S. McNamara]] in 1962. William B. Petty, former Deputy Comptroller of the [[U.S. Air Force]], was appointed in 1965 as the new agency's director and Edward T. Cook, former Director of Contract Audit for the Navy, was selected as the deputy director.&lt;ref name="Orientation"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.dcaa.mil/newhires/orientation_handbook11-02.pdf|title=DCAA Employee Orientation Handbook|date=April 2001|page=1|publisher=Defense Contract Audit Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcaa.mil/about_dcaa.html|title=About DCAA|publisher=DCAA official website|accessdate=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent history==
As of September 30, 2013, the Defense Contract Audit Agency had 4,933 employees, located at more than 300 offices throughout the [[United States]], [[Europe]], Asia, and in the [[Pacific]]. This workforce consisted of 4,334 auditors and 599 support staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcaa.mil/DCAA_FY2013_Report_to_Congress.pdf|title= Report to Congress on FY 2013 Activities at the Defense Contract Audit Agency|page=2|date=March 24, 2014|publisher=Defense Contract Audit Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Agency provides standardized contract audit services for the Department of Defense, as well as accounting and financial advisory services regarding contracts and subcontracts to all DoD components responsible for procurement and contract administration. These services are provided in connection with negotiation, administration, and settlement of contracts and subcontracts.&lt;ref name="Objective"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcaa.mil/cam/Chapter_01_-_Introduction_To_Contract_Audit.pdf|title=Contract Audit Objective|work=Contract Audit Manual Section 1-104.2|accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; DCAA does not provide consulting and advisory services to contractors due to independence requirements.&lt;ref name="Information for Contractors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcaa.mil/DCAAM_7641.90.pdf|title=Information for Contractors|pages=6–10|date=June 26, 2012|publisher=Defense Contract Audit Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2015, DCAA also provided contract audit services to other government agencies, as well as other countries under the [[Foreign Military Sales]] (FMS) program, on a reimbursable basis.  The largest non-DoD agency for which DCAA performed audits was [[NASA]]{{mdash}}primarily since the same government contractors do substantial business with both DoD and NASA, especially on major programs.  However, Congress banned DCAA from performing non-Defense audits in the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Defense authorization bill addresses DCAA audit backlog {{!}} The Contracting Education Academy|url = http://contractingacademy.gatech.edu/2015/12/04/defense-authorization-bill-addresses-dcaa-audit-backlog/|website = contractingacademy.gatech.edu|accessdate = 2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agency structure===
The DCAA headquarters is located at [[Fort Belvoir]], in the same building as the [[Defense Logistics Agency]]. Under headquarters, the agency is organized into five geographic regions and a Field Detachment group, the latter handling contracts involving classified information.  As of 2011, the DCAA was organized into the following geographic regions.&lt;ref name="Information for Contractors" /&gt;

* '''Western''' region, with a headquarters office at [[La Palma, California]] (Los Angeles area), comprises California, Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington state, the Asian Pacific Rim countries and Australia.
* '''Central''' region, with headquarters in [[Irving, Texas]], includes Texas, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, northern Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
* '''Eastern''' region, with headquarters in [[Smyrna, Georgia]], covers Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, southern Virginia, Indiana, Ohio, and the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, as well as audits in Central and South American countries.
* '''Mid-Atlantic''' region, headquartered at [[Philadelphia]], comprises Pennsylvania, northern Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, the District of Columbia, West Virginia, southern New Jersey.
* '''Northeastern''' region, with a headquarters office in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]] includes Massachusetts, northern New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire. Its responsibilities include audits in Europe, Asia (excluding the Pacific Rim) and Africa.

Within each region are 15 to 22 field audit offices. These are referred to as ''resident'' offices when dedicated to the audit of one contractor, generally located on the contractor's property. ''Branches'' are field audit offices that perform audits of multiple contractors, and may have subordinate ''sub-offices'' responsible for audits of a single contractor.&lt;ref name="Information for Contractors" /&gt;

The DCAA also operates the Defense Contract Audit Institute (DCAI), located in Sandy Springs, Georgia. Its teaching staff maintain a library of self-study courses as well as providing seminars by live instructors to meet the training requirements of DCAA employees. On a limited basis, the institute also provides training for other government agencies and foreign military employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcaa.mil/DCAA_Course_Catalog_13_All.pdf|title=About DCAI|publisher=Defense Contract Audit Agency|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defense Contract Audits===
Defense contract audits are required to be performed in accordance with [[Government Auditing Standards]]. These standards, commonly referred to as the "Yellow Book", are published by the Comptroller General of the United States.&lt;ref name="Information for Contractors" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defense Contract Audit Manual, Section 2-101|accessdate=January 27, 2015|url=
http://www.dcaa.mil/cam/Chapter_02_-_Auditing_Standards.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policies and guidelines more specific to defense contract auditing are detailed in the ''Defense Contract Audit Manual'', a continuously updated online publication of the DCAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcaa.mil/cam/chapter_00_-_introduction_to_the_dcaa_contract_audit_manual.pdf|title=Introduction to the Contract Audit Manual|date=April 17, 2014|publisher=Defense Contract Audit Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective of a contract audit is to express an opinion, in the form of an [[auditor's report]], on a contractor's cost estimates or cost claims, depending on the type of contract. This involves evaluation of the contractor's policies, procedures and other internal controls over contract costs, and examining samples of supporting records for individual transactions.&lt;ref name="Objective" /&gt; Government Auditing Standards require the contract auditor to maintain strict independence during audits, avoiding relationships and situations that would look questionable to third parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://www.dcaa.mil/cam/Chapter_02_-_Auditing_Standards.pdf|title=GAGAS Independence|work=Contract Audit Manual, Section 2-203|accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contractor Responsibility===
The [[Federal Acquisition Regulation]]s (FAR) assign responsibility to the contractor for maintaining sufficient records to support claimed costs. FAR 31.201-2(d) requires the contractor to keep "records, including supporting documentation, adequate to demonstrate that costs claimed have been incurred, are allocable to the contract, and comply with applicable cost principles". The same FAR provision allows a government agency's contracting officer to "disallow all or part of a claimed cost that is inadequately supported."

A major area of emphasis in a DCAA audit is determining the adequacy and reliability of the contractor's records to prove the accuracy and reasonableness of contract costs.&lt;ref name="Information for Contractors" /&gt; FAR 4.703(a) requires contractors to "make available records, which includes books, documents, employee time &amp; attendance records, accounting procedures and practices, and other data ... to satisfy contract negotiation, administration, and audit requirements".

==2008 Allegations of intimidation, retaliation, lax oversight, and poor performance==
A report released by the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) on July 23, 2008 alleged that DCAA managers threatened a senior auditor with personnel action if he did not remove negative findings from a report criticizing a large federal contractor.  The report found a too-cozy relationship between management at the DCAA and some of the contractors they are assigned to audit, including [[Boeing]]. GAO also said auditors who complied with the investigation were subject to harassment and intimidation from their supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Brodsky, Robert|url=http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0708/072308rb2.htm|title=Contractors improperly influenced Defense audits, GAO finds|work=Government Executive|date=July 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.governmentexecutive.com/pdfs/072308rb2.pdf|title=Allegations That Certain Audits at Three Locations Did Not Meet Professional Standards Were Substantiated|date=July 2008|work=Report to Congressional Addressees|publisher=General Accounting Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Robert O'Harrow, Jr. and Dana Hedgpeth|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/09/AR2008090902925.html|title=Contracting Audit Agency Target of Investigations|work=Washington Post|date=September 10, 2008|page=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DCAA responded on July 25 that it had asked the US Department of Defense's (DoD) Inspector General (IG) office to investigate the GAO's claims.  "We take the GAO report very seriously," said [[April Stephenson]], DCAA's director.  US Senator [[Claire McCaskill]] said GAO may have uncovered the "biggest auditing scandal in the history of this town," and asked the DoD to immediately fire the supervisors cited in the report.&lt;ref&gt;Brodsky, Robert, "[http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0708/072808rb1.htm Report of Defense audit scandal makes waves]", GovernmentExecutive.com, July 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''[[Associated Press]]'' report on November 10, 2008 revealed that DCAA challenged $4.6 billion, or only 1.2 percent, of the contracts it audited as lacking necessary documentation.  The agency has not used its subpoena authority in over 20 years to produce the required paperwork from defense contractors under audit.  According to the Associated Press, in contrast to the GAO, which saves taxpayers $94 for every dollar it spends, DCAA's return on investment is only $7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcaa.mil/products.htm|title=DCAA Products and Services|publisher=Defense Contract Audit Agency|date=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As an example, the Associated Press reported that a May 2008 audit of [[Bechtel Group]], supervised by DCAA regional director [[Christopher Andrezze]], showed a "chronic failure" by Bechtel to produce the required documentation for the audit.  In spite of this, DCAA issued a report rating Bechtel's internal accounting procedures as "adequate," a passing grade which meant DoD auditors could ease up on the company.  The DCAA report did not mention the company's failure to produce the required documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Lardner, Richard, (''[[Associated Press]]'') "Auditors Can Be Easy On Defense Contractors", ''[[Boston Globe]]'', November 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) report in September 2009 found that agency auditors failed to follow "basic auditing standards" in 65 of 69 audits.  In its report, the GAO noted that the agency 
lacks sufficient independence from the contractors and the DoD agencies doing business with those contractors. The GAO concluded that pressure from outside groups creates a [[hostile work environment]] in 
which audit reports are falsified to appease contractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.federaltimes.com/article/20090923/DEPARTMENTS05/909230303/|title=GAO: Give troubled DoD audit agency more independence|author=Elise Castelli|date=September 23, 2009|work=Federal Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the GAO report, Senator [[Joe Lieberman]] said, "Perhaps it’s time for us to consider separating DCAA from the Department of Defense and … making it an independent auditing agency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/oct/05/senators-threaten-to-scrap-defense-auditor/?page=all#!|title=Pentagon auditor deemed serial failure|work=The Washington Times|date=October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DoD IG released a report of its investigation into the agency on August 31, 2009.  It found that the DCAA has an "environment not conducive to performing quality audits."  An audit of Boeing was cited in which the company was allowed to keep $217 million in taxpayer's money, because a DCAA regional auditor did not perform his/her duties properly.  When Boeing was unresponsive to a request for information, the regional auditor ordered a subordinate to change the audit report in Boeing's favor.  Said Senator [[Tom Coburn]] about the agency in response to the report, "It’s atrocious.  Several of those people ought to be fired."  Added Senator [[Claire McCaskill]], "This report is just further confirmation that DCAA is fundamentally broken.  I certainly hope the Department of Defense takes these accusations seriously. As I said before, if somebody is not held accountable for the shoddy audits the DCAA has produced, nobody should take this agency or their work seriously in the future."  DCAA director Stephenson stated in the IG report that her agency concurred with the IG's recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;Donnelly, John M., "Pentagon Auditors Blasted By New Report", ''[[Congressional Quarterly]] Today'', Sep 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the investigations, Stephenson was removed from her position as director of the agency by DoD comptroller Robert Hale and reassigned to Hale's staff effective November 9, 2009.  She was replaced by Patrick Fitzgerald, previously the Auditor General of the [[United States Army Audit Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "Chief Auditor Is Reassigned", ''[[Washington Post]]'', October 27, 2009, p. 2; Castelli, Elise, "[http://militarytimes.com/news/2009/10/ap_pentagon_auditor_102709/ Top Pentagon auditor reassigned]", ''[[Military Times]]'', October 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2015 Allegations==
Although the Defense Contract Audit Agency primarily audits Federal [[defense contractors]], prior to the passage of the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016]] it was also permitted to audit entities doing business with other parts of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]] at the request of the cognizant oversight authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2016/budget_justification/pdfs/01_Operation_and_Maintenance/O_M_VOL_1_PART_1/DCAA_PB16.pdf|title = Defense Contract Audit Agency 2016 Budget Estimate|date = |accessdate = January 5, 2016|website = |publisher = [[United States Department of Defense]]|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a request would usually occur when the oversight authority in question did not have the resources or expertise to perform an audit themselves.

Beginning in 2011, the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) Office of the Inspector General [https://www.nsf.gov/oig/] (NSF-IG) requested assistance from DCAA in examining the [[National Ecological Observatory Network]] (NEON), the largest construction project in the [[National Science Foundation|NSF]]'s history. DCAA auditors examined the initial (2008) proposal by NEON and concluded that the proposal was so defective that the project should never have been funded based upon it. Subsequently, the NSF-IG requested that DCAA examine NEON's accounting system to determine whether it was properly stewarding taxpayer funds. J. Kirk McGill, [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]] &lt;ref&gt;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Resume_-_J_Kirk_McGill_2015-01-05.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was the Auditor-in-Charge of that engagement. McGill and his team ultimately determined that NEON's system of internal control over taxpayer funds was riddled with material weaknesses and significant deficiencies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|title = English: J. Kirk McGill's April 27, 2014 Whistleblower Disclosure|url = https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:J._Kirk_McGill_2014-04-27_Whistleblower_Disclosure.pdf|date = 2014-04-27|accessdate = 2016-01-05|first = J. Kirk|last = McGill}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGill (who is also a [[Certified Management Accountant]]) concluded that NEON's management accounting was so deficient that the project could go millions of dollars over budget before NEON's management or the NSF would be able to react. Of even further concern, McGill (an expert on fraud and both a Certified Forensic Accountant and a [[Certified Fraud Examiner]]) discovered that NEON had spent approximately $1.8 million of taxpayer money through an extra-legal methodology known as a "management fee" on illegal expenditures including alcohol, lobbying, parties, and luxury travel.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|title = English: J. Kirk McGill's April 27, 2014 Whistleblower Disclosure|url = https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:J._Kirk_McGill_2014-04-27_Whistleblower_Disclosure.pdf|date = 2014-04-27|accessdate = 2016-01-05|first = J. Kirk|last = McGill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McGill prepared a draft audit report for review by his superiors containing the findings above. That draft was approved (after routine revisions) by his immediate superior, Supervisory Auditor Michael Quant, as well as by his second level supervisor Field Audit Office Manager Allen Jones. The office's quality assurance specialist Angie Vaill concurred. NSF Inspector General Allison Lerner was personally briefed regarding the findings on May 23, 2013.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|title = English: J. Kirk McGill's April 27, 2014 Whistleblower Disclosure|url = https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:J._Kirk_McGill_2014-04-27_Whistleblower_Disclosure.pdf|date = 2014-04-27|accessdate = 2016-01-05|first = J. Kirk|last = McGill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, McGill's finding that "management fees" such as that used by NEON were nothing more than a fraudulent evasion of the prohibitions against spending taxpayer money on certain expenditures would have seriously embarrassed the [[United States Department of Defense]] - the largest payer of those fees within the [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]]. Perhaps in response to this situation, DCAA Regional Audit Manager Jerry McAfee and DCAA Central Region Deputy Regional Director Martha McKune (McGill's third and fourth level supervisors respectively) ordered McGill, Jones and Quant to issue an unqualified (clean) audit report on NEON. When they refused, DCAA Deputy Director Anita Bales called McGill and threatened his employment if he did not stop 'rocking the boat'. When McGill again refused to falsely issue a clean opinion, McAfee (acting on orders from McKune) informed the NSF-IG on that DCAA had found no wrongdoing at NEON (contrary to the briefing on May 23, 2013) ''without'' telling McGill, Jones, Quant and Vaill that he had done so. On April 4, 2014, McGill, Quant, Jones and Vaill were given a direct order to issue the clean opinion. McGill refused and resigned from the audit rather than sign a "false report", while Jones, Quant and Vaill agreed to follow the order under protest.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|title = English: J. Kirk McGill's April 27, 2014 Whistleblower Disclosure|url = https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:J._Kirk_McGill_2014-04-27_Whistleblower_Disclosure.pdf|date = 2014-04-27|accessdate = 2016-01-05|first = J. Kirk|last = McGill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McGill notified retired [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command]] Agent Angela Janysek, then the Assistant Director of Internal Review at DCAA (and later its Inspector General), that the order to issue the clean audit report was illegal. The audit was sent to DCAA's Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern Regions for additional reviews. The Mid-Atlantic review concluded on March 14, 2014, that "We don't comment on Management Fee. I[n], the nonprofit arena, this is how the contractor pays for unallowable costs and the agencies know this to be a fact"  - in other words, DCAA management was aware that "management fees" like the one at NEON are used to pay illegal costs, but had deliberately looked the other way. On June 27, 2014, the Northeastern Region review determined that none of McGill's major findings (including the lack of control, and the "management fee") issues were legitimate, and ordered them removed from the final report. Jones, acting on this direct order, signed the final audit report and issued it without McGill's findings. McGill stated that he would take the matter to the appropriate oversight authorities. Immediately thereafter on June 30, 2014, DCAA Director Patrick Fitzgerald abruptly announced his retirement from Federal service (perhaps to avoid responsibility for the debacle), and DCAA Deputy Director Anita Bales (who had threatened McGill in January 2014) was appointed to replace him.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|title = English: J. Kirk McGill's April 27, 2014 Whistleblower Disclosure|url = https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:J._Kirk_McGill_2014-04-27_Whistleblower_Disclosure.pdf|date = 2014-04-27|accessdate = 2016-01-05|first = J. Kirk|last = McGill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McGill concluded that both the underlying findings at NEON as well as the order to remove those findings from the final audit report constituted fraud, waste, abuse, and/or corruption. As a result, he determined that he was obligated to report the matter by 5 CFR § 2635.101(b)(11) - the ''Code of Ethics for Executive Branch Employees''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|title = English: J. Kirk McGill's April 27, 2014 Whistleblower Disclosure|url = https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:J._Kirk_McGill_2014-04-27_Whistleblower_Disclosure.pdf|date = 2014-04-27|accessdate = 2016-01-05|first = J. Kirk|last = McGill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because McGill determined that he was required to report the alleged wrongdoing by both NEON and DCAA as part of his official duties, and because the [[Antideficiency Act]] prohibits Federal Employees from performing any of their official duties off the clock, McGill argued that blowing the whistle on the wrongdoing was actually part of his job, rather than a private act (as all whistleblowing had been prior to this point).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|title = English: J. Kirk McGill's April 27, 2014 Whistleblower Disclosure|url = https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:J._Kirk_McGill_2014-04-27_Whistleblower_Disclosure.pdf|date = 2014-04-27|accessdate = 2016-01-05|first = J. Kirk|last = McGill}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McGill argued that the [[Whistleblower Protection Act]], as modified by the ''Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012'' protected his activities as whistleblowing, at the same time as the [[Antideficiency Act]] and ''Code of Ethics'' required them. DCAA was forced to agree with his arguments, and McGill became the first Federal Employee authorized to perform protected whistleblowing activities on official time. This could have a major impact on the willingness of Federal Employees to blow the whistle, as prior to McGill all whistleblowing was performed on personal time - an expense many Federal Employees were not willing to bear.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|title = English: J. Kirk McGill's April 27, 2014 Whistleblower Disclosure|url = https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:J._Kirk_McGill_2014-04-27_Whistleblower_Disclosure.pdf|date = 2014-04-27|accessdate = 2016-01-05|first = J. Kirk|last = McGill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus authorized to act, McGill notified the [[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoDIG) of the wrongdoing. When DoDIG failed to act, McGill went directly to Congress and notified several members and committees including: the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]], the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation]], the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]], the [[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology]], and the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]]. He also informed [[Rand Paul|Senator Rand Paul]], [[Chuck Grassley|Senator Chuck Grassley]], [[Claire McCaskill|Senator Claire McCaskill]], and [[Michael Bennet|Senator Michael Bennet]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|title = English: J.

Kirk|last = McGill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 3, 2014, Senators [[Chuck Grassley|Grassley]] and [[Rand Paul|Paul]] sent joint letters to NEON and the NSF asking for an explanation for McGill's findings.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|title = English: J.

On September 25, 2014, McGill was contacted by DCAA Security Officer Jenny Lindenbaum. Lindenbaum accused McGill of making terrorist threats against the United States Capitol and stated that she had received "multiple reports" that he was taking medication related to mental illness, that he was seeking treatment for mental illness, and that he was a danger to his coworkers. Lindebaum stated that McGill's security clearance eligibility could be revoked (leading to his firing), and denied knowing that McGill was a whistleblower, but Assistant Director Janysek confirmed to McGill that she personally told Lindenbaum that McGill was a whistleblower. McGill denied the accusations in writing, and also noted that Lindenbaum had lied about knowing that he was a whistleblower. The investigation was apparently closed without comment.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|title = English: J.

Kirk|last = McGill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2014, McGill and his entire team was involuntarily transferred from the Denver Branch Office of DCAA, to the Rocky Mountain Branch Office. At the same time, Supervisory Auditor Quant was sent to a different office — splitting the team of McGill, Jones and Quant into three pieces. Meanwhile, Deputy Regional Director McKune and Regional Audit Manager McAfee were transferred to different positions in DCAA.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|title = English: J.

On December 3, 2014 a hearing on the matter was held before the [[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Full Committee Hearing - Review of the Results of Two Audits of the National Ecological Observatory Network|url = https://science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/full-committee-hearing-review-results-two-audits-national-ecological|website = Committee on Science, Space, and Technology|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second hearing was held on February 3, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Subcommittee on Oversight and Subcommittee on Research and Technology Joint Hearing - NSF’s Oversight of the NEON Project and Other Major Research Facilities Developed Under Cooperative Agreements|url = https://science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/subcommittee-oversight-and-subcommittee-research-and-technology-joint-hearing|website = Committee on Science, Space, and Technology|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015 the [[Office of Management and Budget]] ordered all departments and agencies not to use "management fees" to pay for illegal expenditures. Meanwhile, [[NASA]] banned the practice entirely. On September 18, 2015, a third hearing was held.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Subcommittee on Research and Technology and Subcommittee on Oversight Hearing: NEON Warning Signs: Examining the Management of the National Ecological Observatory Network|url = https://science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/subcommittee-research-and-technology-and-subcommittee-oversight-hearing-neon|website = Committee on Science, Space, and Technology|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|Committee]] ultimately substantiated McGill's allegations towards NEON and on December 11, 2015, NEON was fired from the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://news.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/NEON%20Letter%20Dec%2011%20(2).pdf|title = NSF Letter to NEON on 12/11/2015|date = |accessdate = January 5, 2016|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NSF fires managers of troubled NEON ecology project|url = http://news.sciencemag.org/environment/2015/12/nsf-fires-managers-troubled-neon-ecology-project|website = news.sciencemag.org|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=NSF looks for new contractor to finish troubled observatory |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/environment/2015/12/nsf-looks-new-contractor-finish-troubled-observatory |website=news.sciencemag.org |accessdate=2016-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151219023402/http://news.sciencemag.org/environment/2015/12/nsf-looks-new-contractor-finish-troubled-observatory |archivedate=2015-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This represents one of the largest Federal agreement terminations for cause in history.

McGill's case for whistleblower reprisal under [[Whistleblower Protection Act|5 U.S.C. § 2302]] remains under investigation at the [[United States Office of Special Counsel]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|title = English: J. Kirk McGill's April 27, 2014 Whistleblower Disclosure|url = https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:J._Kirk_McGill_2014-04-27_Whistleblower_Disclosure.pdf|date = 2014-04-27|accessdate = 2016-01-05|first = J. Kirk|last = McGill}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not the first time DCAA has been caught ordering its auditors to remove negative findings from its audit reports, nor the first time that it has been caught retaliating against auditors when they refuse to do so. The previous incident cost DCAA Director April Stephenson her job, perhaps explaining why DCAA Director Patrick Fitzgerald chose to retire rather than face scrutiny, leaving his deputy to attend the December 3, 2014, hearing in his place.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Full Committee Hearing - Review of the Results of Two Audits of the National Ecological Observatory Network|url = https://science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/full-committee-hearing-review-results-two-audits-national-ecological|website = Committee on Science, Space, and Technology|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted above, McGill's whistleblowing was conducted pursuant to his official duties, meaning that unlike many whistleblowers he remained at his post and blew the whistle without going outside of his duties. As mentioned previously, this could have a major impact on Federal whistleblowing in the future.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|title = English: J. Kirk McGill's April 27, 2014 Whistleblower Disclosure|url = https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:J._Kirk_McGill_2014-04-27_Whistleblower_Disclosure.pdf|date = 2014-04-27|accessdate = 2016-01-05|first = J. Kirk|last = McGill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, the fact that McGill's actions directly led to the termination of NEON's management of the multibillion-dollar National Ecological Observatory Network project makes him one of the most successful whistleblowers (at least dollar-wise) in history.

McGill also alleged on April 24, 2015 that DCAA is not actually an independent audit agency because it does not comply with the independence requirements of [[Government Auditing Standards]]. As a result, DCAA has not assigned him any assignments requiring independence since April, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = English: J. Kirk McGill's 24 April 2015 Whistleblower Disclosure regarding DCAA's Independence|url = https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Whistleblower_Disclosure_(McGill_-_Independence)_Rev._03-PDF.pdf|date = 2015-04-24|accessdate = 2016-01-06|first = J. Kirk|last = McGill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology passed the NSF Major Research Facility Reform Act (H.R. 5049) in April 2016. The purpose of the Act is to implement significant reforms related to National Science Foundation (NSF) Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction projects, such as the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). Indeed, resolving the misconduct at NEON and preventing such misconduct in future at NEON and other NSF projects forms the core purpose of the legislation. In the Committee report accompanying the bill, the Committee explicitly thanked McGill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/114/crpt/hrpt619/CRPT-114hrpt619.pdf|title=House Report 114-619|last=|first=|date=|website=Congress.gov|publisher=Congressional Printing Office|access-date=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 October 2016 the [[Project On Government Oversight]] issued a press release on the broader problems at DCAA using McGill and NEON as a case study to support their conclusion that DCAA may need to be removed from the Department of Defense to function properly due to its history of retaliating against whistleblowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pogo.org/blog/2016/10/whistleblower-alleges-culture-of-intimidation-at-dcaa.html|title=Whistleblower Alleges Culture of Intimidation at DCAA|website=Project On Government Oversight|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GenerationAdidas.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Generation Adidas official logo]]
'''Generation Adidas''' is a joint venture between [[Major League Soccer]] and [[United States Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer]] aimed at raising the level of young professional [[football (soccer)|soccer]] talent in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/354854/us-u-20-players-headline-2006-class|title=U.S. U-20 players headline 2006 class|author=|date=|website=ESPNFC.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program, sponsored by [[Adidas]], offers professional-ready players in the U.S. developmental system not yet eligible for the [[MLS SuperDraft]] early entry, allowing MLS to compete with foreign professional clubs without comparable restrictions on player signing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ussoccerplayers.com/2010/01/mccabe-explains-generation-adidas.html|title=McCabe Explains Generation adidas|author=|date=|website=US Soccer Players}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its establishment in 1997 to 2005, the program was sponsored by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and was called '''Project-40'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ussoccerplayers.com/resource_center/soccer_history/447766.html|title=US Soccer Players|author=|date=|website=www.ussoccerplayers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally intended to improve the U.S. national team player pool, American national team eligibility is no longer required for program entry.

[[Carlos Parra]] was the first Project-40 player when he signed with the league and was allocated to the [[New York Red Bulls|New York/New Jersey MetroStars]] in 1997. Since then, the program has included players such as [[Tim Howard]], [[DaMarcus Beasley]], [[Maurice Edu]], [[Carlos Bocanegra]], [[Clint Dempsey]], [[Jozy Altidore]], [[Ben Olsen]], [[Sacha Kljestan]], [[Freddy Adu]], [[Brad Guzan]], [[Michael Bradley (soccer)|Michael Bradley]], [[Nick Rimando]], and [[Kyle Beckerman]]. 

Generation Adidas players do not count against the MLS senior roster and usually earn a much higher salary than the league minimum. Entering into the program automatically classifies a player as [[professional]], and thus disqualifies them from playing college soccer. As a result, Generation Adidas players are also guaranteed scholarships to continue their college education should their professional career not pan out.

From 1998 to 2000, MLS entered a team of Project-40 players, supplemented by other MLS players who did not get much playing time, into the [[USL First Division|A-League]] in the [[United Soccer Leagues|USL]].

In 2017, MLS introduced Canadian Generation Adidas players, part of a new initiative with the [[Canadian Soccer Association]]. Canadian Generation Adidas players count as domestic players on US based MLS teams.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2017/01/04/mls-announces-2017-generation-adidas-class-and-senior-signings&lt;/ref&gt;

He later co-owned the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] baseball team before defeating [[Ann Richards]] in the [[Texas gubernatorial election, 1994|1994 Texas gubernatorial election]]. [[George W.

The [[September 11 terrorist attacks]] occurred eight months into Bush's first term. Bush responded with what became known as the [[Bush Doctrine]]: launching a "[[War on Terror]]", an international military campaign that included the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]] in 2001 and the [[Iraq War]] in 2003.

His tenure included national debates on [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]], [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], [[Terrorist Surveillance Program|electronic surveillance]], and [[enhanced interrogation techniques|torture]]. In the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]] presidential race, Bush defeated Democratic Senator [[John Kerry]] in another relatively close election.

In December 2007, the United States entered its longest post-[[World War II]] recession, often referred to as the "[[Great Recession]]", prompting the Bush administration to obtain congressional passage of multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial system.

====Primary====
[[File:George W. Bush in Concord, New Hampshire signing papers for presidential run.jpg|thumb|George W. Bush in Concord, New Hampshire, signing to be a candidate for president]]
Incumbent Democratic president [[Bill Clinton]] was completing his second and final term, and the field for nomination for President of both parties was wide open. Bush was the Governor of Texas in June 1999 when he announced his candidacy for President of the United States. He entered a large field of hopefuls for the Republican Party presidential nomination that included [[John McCain]], [[Alan Keyes]], [[Steve Forbes]], [[Gary Bauer]], [[Orrin Hatch]], [[Elizabeth Dole]], [[Dan Quayle]], [[Pat Buchanan]], [[Lamar Alexander]], [[John Kasich]], and [[Bob Smith (American politician)|Bob Smith]].

Bush portrayed himself as a [[compassionate conservatism|compassionate conservative]], implying he was more centrist than other Republicans. He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing the size of the [[United States Armed Forces]], cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities.&lt;ref name=msn/&gt; By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and McCain.&lt;ref name=msn/&gt;

Bush won the [[Iowa caucuses]], and although he was heavily favored to win the [[New Hampshire primary]], he trailed McCain by 19&amp;nbsp;percent and lost that primary. Despite this, Bush regained momentum, and according to political observers, he effectively became the front runner after the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2000|South Carolina primary]]—which according to ''[[The Boston Globe]]''—made history for his campaign's negativity. ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as a [[smear campaign]].&lt;ref name=anatomy&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/ |title=The anatomy of a smear campaign |work=Boston Globe |last=Davis |first=Richard H. |date=March 21, 2004 |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515081611/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/ |archivedate=May 15, 2006 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hook |first1=Janet |author2=Michael Finnegan |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/17/nation/na-mccain17 |title=McCain loses some of his rebel edge |work=Los Angeles Times |date=March 17, 2007 |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archivedate=May 15, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515081611/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/17/nation/na-mccain17 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/us/politics/19mccain.html |title=Confronting Ghosts of 2000 in South Carolina |work=The New York Times |date=October 19, 2007 |accessdate=April 14, 2013 |last=Steinhauer |first=Jennifer |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209070019/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/us/politics/19mccain.html |archivedate=December 9, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====General election====

On July 25, 2000, Bush surprised some observers when he selected [[Dick Cheney]]—a former [[White House Chief of Staff]], [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]], and [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]—to be his [[running mate]]. At the time, Cheney was serving as head of Bush's vice presidential search committee. Soon after at the [[2000 Republican National Convention]], Bush and Cheney were officially nominated by the Republican Party.

Bush continued to campaign across the country and touted his record as Governor of Texas.&lt;ref name=msn/&gt; During his campaign, Bush criticized his Democratic opponent, incumbent Vice President [[Al Gore]], over [[Gun law in the United States|gun control]] and taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Sack, Kevin |author2=Toner, Robin |date=August 13, 2000 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/13/us/2000-campaign-record-congress-gore-selected-issues-ready-for-prime-time.html |title=The 2000 Campaign: The Record; In Congress, Gore Selected Issues Ready for Prime Time |work=The New York Times |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archivedate=May 15, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515081611/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/13/us/2000-campaign-record-congress-gore-selected-issues-ready-for-prime-time.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the election returns were tallied on November 7, Bush had won 29 states, including Florida. The closeness of the Florida outcome led to a [[United States presidential election in Florida, 2000|recount]].&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt; The initial recount also went to Bush, but the outcome was tied up in lower courts for a month until eventually reaching the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZPC.html George W.

The Bush campaign advertised across the U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator [[John Kerry]]. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the [[Iraq War]], and accused him of failing to stimulate the economy and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq,&lt;ref name=msn/&gt; and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.

In the election, Bush carried 31 of 50 states, receiving a total of 286 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]]. He won an absolute majority of the popular vote (50.7&amp;nbsp;percent to his opponent's 48.3&amp;nbsp;percent).&lt;ref name="16 years"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/04/uselections2004.usa16 |title=And now... four more years |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |date=November 4, 2004 |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=Julian |last=Borger |archivedate=May 15, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515081611/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/nov/04/uselections2004.usa16 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush's father George H.W. Bush was the previous president who won an absolute majority of the popular vote; he accomplished that feat in the 1988 election. Additionally, it was the first time since [[Herbert Hoover]]'s [[United States presidential election, 1928|election in 1928]] that a Republican president was elected alongside re-elected Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress.

His administration increased federal [[government spending]] from $1.789 trillion to $2.983 trillion (60&amp;nbsp;percent) while revenues increased from $2.025 trillion to $2.524 trillion (from 2000 to 2008). Individual income tax revenues increased by 14&amp;nbsp;percent, corporate tax revenues by 50&amp;nbsp;percent, customs and duties by 40&amp;nbsp;percent.

After being re-elected, Bush signed into law a [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] drug benefit program that, according to [[Jan Crawford]], resulted in "the greatest expansion in America's [[welfare state]] in forty years;" the bill's costs approached $7&amp;nbsp;trillion.&lt;ref&gt;Greenburg, Jan Crawford, Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court, 2007, Penguin Books, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Bush opposed and vetoed [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP) legislation, which was added by the Democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by Congress. The SCHIP legislation would have significantly expanded federally funded health care benefits and plans to children of some low-income families from about six&amp;nbsp;million to ten&amp;nbsp;million children. It was to be funded by an increase in the cigarette tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Michael Abramowitz |author2=Jonathan Weisman |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/03/AR2007100300116_pf.html |title=Bush Vetoes Health Measure |work=The Washington Post |date=October 4, 2007 |accessdate=October 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush viewed the legislation as a move toward [[socialized health care]], and asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as $83,000 per year who did not need the help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=October 4, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/04/washington/04bush.html |title=Bush Vetoes Child Health Bill Privately |work=The New York Times |accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social services and Social Security====
Following Republican efforts to pass the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act|Medicare Act of 2003]], Bush signed the bill, which included major changes to the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs, while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncpssm.org/pdf/PL108summary.pdf |title=Summary of Medicare Act of 2003 |accessdate=August 20, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724191249/http://www.ncpssm.org/pdf/PL108summary.pdf |archive-date=July 24, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The retired persons lobby group [[AARP]] worked with the Bush Administration on the program and gave their endorsement.

[[File:President George W. Bush discussing Social Security.jpg|thumb|left|President Bush discussing Social Security reform at the Lake Nona YMCA Family Center in Orlando, Florida, March 18, 2005]]

Bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition from some in the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref name="ss-msnbc"/&gt; In his [[2005 State of the Union Address]], Bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy of the program and outlined his new program, which included partial privatization of the system, personal Social Security accounts, and options to permit Americans to divert a portion of their Social Security tax ([[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|FICA]]) into secured investments.&lt;ref name="ss-msnbc"/&gt; Democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system.&lt;ref name="ss-msnbc"/&gt;

Bush embarked on a 60-day national tour, campaigning for his initiative in media events known as "Conversations on Social Security", in an attempt to gain public support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28120-2005Mar11.html |title=Social Security: On With the Show |author1=Jim VandeHei |author2=Peter Baker |date=February 12, 2005 |newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, public support for the proposal declined&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=April 28, 2005 |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/f944a850-b830-11d9-bc7c-00000e2511c8,_i_rssPage=80fdaff6-cbe5-11d7-81c6-0820abe49a01.html |title=Bush shifts approach on Social Security reform |accessdate=September 9, 2007 |newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the House Republican leadership decided not to put Social Security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/060105/social.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205090810/http://thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/060105/social.html |archivedate=December 5, 2005 |title=Social Security in Limbo |work=The Hill |date=June 1, 2005 |author=Patrick O'Connor |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal's legislative prospects were further diminished by the fall of 2005 political fallout from [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hurricane dims Bush's hopes on Social Security |date=September 22, 2005 |last=Yeager |first=Holly |url=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/00d6ee20-2b9f-11da-995a-00000e2511c8.html |accessdate=September 9, 2007 |work=Financial Times |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050923024100/http://news.ft.com/cms/s/00d6ee20-2b9f-11da-995a-00000e2511c8.html |archivedate=September 23, 2005 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Democrats gained control of both houses of Congress as a result of the [[United States Senate elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], there was no prospect of further congressional action on the Bush proposal for the remainder of his term in office.

====Environmental policies====
{{Main|Domestic policy of the George W. Bush administration#Environment}}
Upon taking office in 2001, Bush stated his opposition to the [[Kyoto Protocol]], an amendment to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, citing that the treaty exempted 80&amp;nbsp;percent of the world's population&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=March 13, 2001 |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/03/20010314.html |title=Letter from the President to Senators Hagel, Helms, Craig, and Roberts |publisher=Office of the Press Secretary |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507053351/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/03/20010314.html |deadurl=yes |archivedate=May 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/kyoto/economic.htm |title=Summary of the Kyoto Report&amp;nbsp;– Assessment of Economic Impacts |publisher=Energy Information Administration |date=July 16, 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523060852/http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/kyoto/economic.htm |deadurl=yes |archivedate=May 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also cited that the Senate had voted 95–0 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol.

In May 2001, Bush signed an [[executive order]] to create an interagency task force to streamline energy projects,&lt;ref name=eo13212&gt;Bush, George W.

In 2002, Bush announced the [[Clear Skies Act of 2003]],&lt;ref name="EXsummary"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/02/clearskies.html |title=Executive Summary&amp;nbsp;– The Clear Skies Initiative |publisher=The White House |date=February 14, 2002 |accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aimed at amending the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] to reduce air pollution through the use of [[emissions trading]] programs. Many experts argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sierraclub.org/cleanair/clear_skies.asp |publisher=The [[Sierra Club]] |title=Clear Skies Proposal Weakens the Clean Air Act |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917224422/http://www.sierraclub.org/cleanair/clear_skies.asp |archivedate=September 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative was introduced to Congress, but failed to make it out of committee.

Later in 2006, Bush declared the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]] a national monument, creating the largest [[marine reserve]] to date. The [[Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument]] comprises 84&amp;nbsp;million acres (340,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and is home to 7,000 species of fish, birds, and other marine animals, many of which are specific to only those islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13300363/ |title=Bush creates world's biggest ocean preserve |date=June 16, 2006 |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108120830/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13300363/ |archivedate=November 8, 2012 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was hailed by conservationists for "its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.org/initiatives/marine/press/press2489.html |title=The Nature Conservancy Applauds President Bush for Creating World's Largest Marine Conservation Area in Hawaii |date=June 16, 2006 |publisher=[[The Nature Conservancy]] |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archivedate=November 28, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081128101124/http://www.nature.org/initiatives/marine/press/press2489.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush said, "This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress."&lt;ref name="drilling-cnn"/&gt; Bush had said in June 2008, "In the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen [[fuel cell]]s... In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home. So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/06/20080618.html |title=President Bush Discusses Energy |date=June 18, 2008 |accessdate=August 3, 2008 |publisher=The White House |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502232627/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/06/20080618.html |archivedate=May 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[2008 State of the Union Address]], Bush announced that the U.S. would commit $2&amp;nbsp;billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change, saying, "Along with contributions from other countries, this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner, more efficient technologies in developing nations like India and China, and help leverage substantial private-sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive." He also announced plans to reaffirm the United States' commitment to work with major economies, and, through the UN, to complete an international agreement that will slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases; he stated, "This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/stateoftheunion2008.htm |title=George W.

The issue had been debated for 13 years before it finally became law. The measure is designed to protect citizens without hindering genetic research.

According to the prosecutors, there was insufficient evidence to pursue prosecution for any criminal offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/connecticut/articles/2010/07/21/doj_prosecutor_firing_was_politics_not_crime/ |title=DOJ: Prosecutor firing was politics, not crime |newspaper=Boston Globe |date=July 21, 2010 |accessdate=July 31, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723130805/http://www.boston.com/news/local/connecticut/articles/2010/07/21/doj_prosecutor_firing_was_politics_not_crime/ |archivedate=July 23, 2010 |first1=Matt |last1=Apuzzo |first2=Pete |last2=Yost |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Purge of the Central Intelligence Agency====
Following the resignation of CIA director [[George Tenet]] in 2004, Bush nominated [[Porter Goss]] to head the agency. The White House ordered Goss to purge agency officers who were disloyal to the administration.&lt;ref name=salon&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.salon.com/2004/11/15/cia_13/ |title=Purging the disloyal at the CIA |newspaper=Salon.com |date=November 15, 2004 |accessdate=April 4, 2017 |first1=Geraldine |last1=Sealey}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Goss' appointment, many of the CIA's senior agents were fired or quit. The CIA has been accused of deliberately leaking classified information to undermine the 2004 election.&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45940-2005Jan3.html |title=Dubious Purge at the CIA |newspaper=Washington Post |date=January 4, 2005 |accessdate=April 4, 2017 |first1=Haviland |last1=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2001, Bush visited [[Pope John Paul II]] at Castel Gandolfo.&lt;ref&gt;Decision Points Bush, George W. Random House 2010 page 116&lt;/ref&gt;
During his presidential campaign, Bush's [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign policy]] platform included support for stronger economic and political relationship with [[Latin America]], especially [[Mexico]], and a reduction of involvement in "[[nation-building]]" and other small-scale military engagements. The administration pursued a [[national missile defense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://fas.org/nuke/control/abmt/news/010501bush.html |title=President Bush Speech on Missile Defense |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |date=May 1, 2001 |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archivedate=March 13, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313022704/http://www.fas.org/nuke/control/abmt/news/010501bush.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush was an advocate of China's entry into the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/east/04/05/china.WTO/ |title=Bush backs China's WTO entry despite standoff |publisher=CNN |date=April 6, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515133508/http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/east/04/05/china.WTO/ |archivedate=May 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush referred to an [[axis of evil]] including [[Iraq]], [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]].&lt;ref name=suterror&gt;{{cite web |url=http://millercenter.org/president/speeches/detail/4540 |title=State of the Union Address (January 29, 2002)&amp;nbsp;– Miller Center |publisher=Millercenter.org |date=January 29, 2002 |accessdate=July 31, 2012 |author=P.O.

In 2003, Bush then launched the [[Iraq War|invasion of Iraq]], searching for Weapons of Mass Destruction, which he described as being part of the War on Terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=November 30, 2005 |accessdate=January 19, 2009 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/30/bush.excerpts/index.html |title=Key points from Bush speech |publisher=CNN |archivedate=May 15, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515133532/http://edition.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/30/bush.excerpts/index.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those invasions led to the toppling of the [[Taliban]] regime in Afghanistan and the removal of [[Saddam Hussein]] from power in Iraq.

[[File:Bush meets Pranab Mukherjee.jpg|thumb|left|Foreign Minister of India [[Pranab Mukherjee]] with President Bush, March 2008]]
Bush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with European nations. He appointed long-time adviser [[Karen Hughes]] to oversee a global public relations campaign. Bush lauded the pro-democracy struggles in Georgia and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Freedom Agenda |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/infocus/freedomagenda/ |website=georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |publisher=georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, Bush reversed decades of U.S. policy when he visited India; the trip led to renewed ties between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-03-02-nuclear-pact_x.htm |title=Nuclear deal announced as Bush visits India |newspaper=USA Today |date=March 2, 2006 |accessdate=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visit focused particularly on areas of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], counter-terrorism cooperation, and discussions that would eventually lead to the [[India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/03/20060302-5.html |title=U.S. –India Joint Statement |date=March 2, 2006 |publisher=The White House |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611161845/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/03/20060302-5.html |archivedate=June 11, 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush's visit was in stark contrast to the stance taken by his predecessor, Bill Clinton, whose approach and response to India after the 1998 nuclear tests was that of sanctions and hectoring. The relationship between India and the United States was one that dramatically improved during Bush's tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1109/29825.html |title=Roemer key to U.S. –India relationship&amp;nbsp;– Daniel Libit and Laura Rozen |publisher=Politico.Com |accessdate=March 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126182109/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1109/29825.html |archivedate=November 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Midway through Bush's second term, questions arose whether Bush was retreating from his freedom and democracy agenda, which was highlighted in policy changes toward some oil-rich former Soviet republics in central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/23/AR2006042301017.html |title=Retreat From the Freedom Agenda |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |last=Diehl |first=Jackson |date=April 24, 2005 |newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an address before both Houses of Congress on September 20, 2001, Bush thanked the nations of the world for their support following the September 11 attacks. He specifically thanked [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] for traveling to Washington to show "unity of purpose with America", and said "America has no truer friend than Great Britain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html |title=Address to a Joint Session of Congress and the American People |author=Bush, George W. |publisher=[[The White House]] |date=September 20, 2001 |accessdate=April 6, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527194111/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html |archivedate=May 27, 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The September 11 terrorist attacks were a major turning point in Bush's presidency. That evening, he addressed the nation from the [[Oval Office]], promising a strong response to the attacks. He also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims. Three days after the attacks, Bush visited [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] and met with Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]], firefighters, police officers, and volunteers. To much applause, Bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing in a heap of rubble: "I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010914-9.html |date=September 14, 2001 |title=President Bush Salutes Heroes in New York |publisher=The White House |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225062850/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010914-9.html |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September 20 speech, Bush condemned [[Osama bin Laden]] and his organization [[Al-Qaeda]], and issued an ultimatum to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, where bin Laden was operating, to "hand over the terrorists, or ... share in their fate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html |date=September 20, 2001 |title=Address to a Joint Session of Congress and the American People |publisher=The White House |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archivedate=May 27, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527194111/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After September 11, Bush announced a global [[War on Terror]].

On October 7, 2001, U.S. and British forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of [[Northern Alliance]] troops in [[Kabul]] on November 13. The main goals of the war were to defeat the [[Taliban]], drive [[al-Qaeda]] out of Afghanistan, and capture key al-Qaeda leaders. In December 2001, the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated,&lt;ref name=taliband&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/11/world/nation-challenged-military-campaign-taliban-defeated-pentagon-asserts-but-war.html |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |date=December 11, 2001 |author1=Shanker, Tom |author2=Eric Schmitt |newspaper=The New York Times |title=A Nation Challenged; Military Campaign; Taliban Defeated, Pentagon Asserts, but War Goes On |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225062850/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/11/world/nation-challenged-military-campaign-taliban-defeated-pentagon-asserts-but-war.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders.&lt;ref name=taliband/&gt; Later that month the UN had installed the [[Afghan Transitional Administration]] chaired by [[Hamid Karzai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/isaf.cfm |title=Fact Sheet: International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan |publisher=[[Center for Defense Information]] |date=February 14, 2002 |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225062850/http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/isaf.cfm |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4673026.stm |title=More Dutch troops for Afghanistan |publisher=BBC News |date=February 3, 2006 |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225062850/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4673026.stm |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, based on [[UNICEF]] figures, [[Nicholas Kristof]] reported that "our invasion of Afghanistan may end up saving one million lives over the next decade" as the result of improved healthcare and greater access to humanitarian aid.&lt;ref&gt;Kristof, Nicholas D., [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/01/opinion/a-merciful-war.html "A Merciful War,"] ''The New York Times'', February 1, 2002. "Now aid is pouring in and lives are being saved on an enormous scale. Unicef, for example, has vaccinated 734,000 children against measles over the last two months, in a country where virtually no one had been vaccinated against the disease in the previous 10 years. Because measles often led to death in Afghanistan, the vaccination campaign will save at least 35,000 children's lives each year... Heidi J. Larson of Unicef says that if all goes well, child and maternal mortality rates will drop in half in Afghanistan over the next five years. That would mean 112,000 fewer children and 7,500 fewer pregnant women dying each year."&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with his January 29, 2002 [[State of the Union]] address, Bush began publicly focusing attention on Iraq, which he labeled as part of an "[[axis of evil]]" allied with terrorists and posing "a grave and growing danger" to U.S. interests through possession of [[weapons of mass destruction]].&lt;ref name=sotu2002/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Iraq: The War Card |url=http://www.iwatchnews.org/accountability/iraq-war-card |publisher=The Center for Public Integrity |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225062850/http://www.iwatchnews.org/accountability/iraq-war-card |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush withdrew U.S. support for several international agreements, including the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] (ABM) with Russia. He also signed the [[Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty]] with Russia.

Bush emphasized a careful approach to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians; he denounced [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] leader [[Yasser Arafat]] for his support of violence, but sponsored dialogues between Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] and Palestinian National Authority President [[Mahmoud Abbas]]. Bush supported Sharon's unilateral disengagement plan, and lauded the democratic elections held in Palestine after Arafat's death.

Bush opened the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City, Utah. Departing from previous practice, he stood among a group of U.S. athletes rather than from a ceremonial stand or box, saying: "On behalf of a proud, determined, and grateful nation, I declare open the Games of Salt Lake City, celebrating the Olympic Winter Games."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/02/20020209-2.html |title=President Bush Opens 2002 Olympic Games |date=February 8, 2002 |publisher=The White House |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514195905/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/02/20020209-2.html |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, in the course of a good-will trip to Asia, he attended the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=August 22, 2008 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26131736/ |title=Bush: Olympics exceeded my expectations |agency=Associated Press |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822105310/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26131736 |archivedate=August 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush twice invoked [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Section 3: Presidential declaration|Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment]], which allows a president to temporarily transfer the powers and duties of his office to the vice president, who then becomes [[Acting President of the United States|acting president]]. On June 29, 2002, Bush underwent a [[colonoscopy]] and chose to invoke Section 3 of the amendment, making Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] the acting president. The medical procedure began at 7:09&amp;nbsp;am. EDT and ended at 7:29&amp;nbsp;am. EDT. Bush woke up twenty minutes later, but did not resume his presidential powers and duties until 9:24&amp;nbsp;am. EDT after the president's doctor, [[Richard Tubb]], conducted an overall examination. Tubb said he recommended the additional time to make sure the sedative had no after effects. On July 21, 2007, Bush again invoked Section 3 in response to having to undergo a colonoscopy, again making Vice President Cheney the acting president. Bush invoked Section 3 at 7:16&amp;nbsp;am. EDT. He reclaimed his powers at 9:21&amp;nbsp;am. EDT. In both cases, Bush specifically cited Section 3 when he transferred the presidential powers to the Vice President and when he reclaimed those powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/acting_presidents.php |title=Acting Presidents Under the 25th Amendment |publisher=American Presidency Project |accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the announcement of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]'s retirement on July 1, 2005, Bush nominated [[John Roberts]] to succeed her. On September 5, following the death of [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]], this nomination was withdrawn and Bush instead nominated Roberts for Chief Justice to succeed Rehnquist. Roberts was confirmed by the Senate as the 17th Chief Justice on September 29, 2005.

On October 3, 2005, Bush nominated long time White House Counsel [[Harriet Miers]] for O'Connor's position. After facing significant opposition from both parties, who found her to be ill-prepared and uninformed on the law,&lt;ref name="Greenburg, Jan Crawford 2007. Page 278"&gt;Greenburg, Jan Crawford. Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court.2007. Penguin Books. Page 278.&lt;/ref&gt; Miers asked that her name be withdrawn on October 27. Four days later, on October 31, Bush nominated federal appellate judge [[Samuel Alito]]. Alito was confirmed as the 110th Supreme Court Justice on January 31, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes&amp;nbsp;– Nomination of Samuel Alito |url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00002 |publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=July 31, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829201552/https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00002 |archivedate=August 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other courts====
{{Main|List of federal judges appointed by George W. Bush}}
In addition to his two Supreme Court appointments, Bush appointed 61 judges to the [[United States courts of appeals]] and 261 judges to the [[United States district court]]s. Each of these numbers, along with his total of 324 judicial appointments, is third in American history, behind both [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Bill Clinton]]. Bush experienced a number of [[George W. Bush judicial appointment controversies|judicial appointment controversies]]. Debate during one confirmation session lasted "39 stupefying hours" according to ''The New York Times''. On August 3, 2001, the Senate did not consent to keep existing nominations in ''status quo'', returning 40 judicial nominations, and 164 total nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/10/20081006-5.html |title=President Bush Discusses Judicial Accomplishments and Philosophy |date=October 6, 2008 |publisher=The White House |place=Cincinnati, Ohio |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813153034/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/10/20081006-5.html |archivedate=August 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Source states "For the first time in history, the Senate used a filibuster to block a nominee to the Court of Appeals" hence one specific example is exactly in source {{not in source|date=June 2012}}--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/16/weekinreview/page-two-buzzwords.html |title=PAGE TWO: BUZZWORDS |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 16, 2003 |archivedate=April 24, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424160347/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/16/weekinreview/page-two-buzzwords.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Denis Steven Rutkus |author2=Mitchel A.

At the outset, Judicature magazine noted that the "Senate Democrats were gearing up for the approaching confirmation hearings" before the first set of nominees were sent to the Senate. It then cites ''The New York Times'' as saying "Senate Democrats have pledged they will not automatically vote to confirm Mr. Bush's judicial nominees and will subject them to intense scrutiny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2564309961.html |title="Strict Scrutiny?" the Content of Senate Judicial Confirmation Hearings during the George W.

===Reception===
The George W. Bush presidency has been ranked among the worst in [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|surveys of presidential scholars]] published in the late 2000s and 2010s.&lt;ref name="US News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Austin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mann"/&gt;

After his re-election in 2004, Bush received increasingly heated [[Public image of George W. Bush|criticism]] from across the [[political spectrum]]&lt;ref name="Republican right abandoning Bush"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelley Beaucar Vlahos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt; for his handling of the Iraq War, [[Hurricane Katrina]],&lt;ref name="TVNZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mike M. Ahlers"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; and other challenges. Amid this criticism, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] regained control of Congress in the [[United States elections, 2006|2006 elections]]. In December 2007, the United States entered its longest post-[[World War II]] recession, often referred to as the "[[Great Recession]]", prompting the Bush administration to obtain congressional passage of multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial system. Nationally, Bush was both one of the most popular and unpopular presidents in history, having received the highest recorded presidential approval ratings in the wake of the September 11 attacks, as well as one of the lowest approval ratings during the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 financial crisis]].&lt;ref name="Gallup"/&gt;

Bush said in 2013, "Ultimately history will judge the decisions I made, and I won't be around because it will take time for the objective historians to show up. So I am pretty comfortable with it. I did what I did."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jul/2/george-w-bush-history-will-judge-opinion-polls-i-c/ |title=George W.

Bush appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' on November 19, 2013, along with the former [[First Lady]], Laura Bush.

He added that people had said during his presidency that he should withdraw American troops from Iraq, but he chose the opposite, sending 30,000 more troops in order to defeat [[Al Qaeda in Iraq]], and that Al Qaeda in Iraq was defeated. Bush was also asked about Iran but declined to answer, stating that any answer he gives would be interpreted as undermining President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name=IsraelHayom&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=26127 |title=My position was: you need to have boots on the ground |author1=Amos Regev |author2=Boaz Bismuth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Bush's legacy continues to develop today. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from occurring in the US after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as [[PEPFAR]]. Critics often point to his handling of the [[Iraq War]], specifically the failure to find [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]], that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion—as well as his handling of [[Taxation in the United States|tax policy]], [[Hurricane Katrina]], [[climate change]] and the [[2008 financial crisis]]—as proof that George W.

Several historians and commentators hold the view that Bush was one of the most consequential presidents in American history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1264">"'''Good engineering practice'''" or "'''GEP'''" is engineering and technical activities that ensure that a company manufactures products of the required quality as expected (e.g., by the relevant regulatory authorities). Good engineering practices are to ensure that the development and/or manufacturing effort consistently generates deliverables that support the requirements for qualification or validation. Good engineering practices are applied to all industries that require engineering.

'''Sir Thomas Harcourt Clarke "Pat" Caughey''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|KBE|CStJ|JP}} (4 July 1911 – 4 August 1993) was a New Zealand [[rugby union]] player.

==Early life and family==
Born in [[Auckland]] in 1911, Caughey was the son of James Marsden Caughey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NZH19110708.2.2.1 | title=Births | date=8 July 1911 | work=New Zealand Herald | accessdate=16 November 2014 | page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whose aunt, [[Marianne Smith]] (née Caughey), founded in 1880 what became [[Smith &amp; Caughey's]] department store. Educated at [[King's College, Auckland|King's College]], he excelled at sports, playing in the 1st XV rugby and 1st XI cricket teams, and winning the school athletics, swimming and boxing championships.&lt;ref name="AB profile"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://stats.allblacks.com/asp/Profile.asp?ABID=141 |title = Pat Caughey | last = Luxford | first = Bob | publisher = New Zealand Rugby Union | accessdate = 16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rugby union==
A [[Rugby union positions#Centre|centre three-quarter]], Caughey represented [[Auckland Rugby Football Union|Auckland]] at a provincial level, and was a member of the New Zealand national side, the [[All Blacks]], from 1932 to 1937. He played 39 matches for the All Blacks including nine internationals.&lt;ref name="AB profile"/&gt;

Caughey played for Auckland University RFC and represented the Auckland provincial team and the national team before his 21st birthday. He toured Australia with the All Blacks in both [[1932 New Zealand rugby union tour of Australia|1932]] and [[1934 New Zealand rugby union tour of Australia|1934]], playing as a centre. He was one of 188 players who took part in the All Blacks trials for the [[1935–36 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and Canada]], and was selected for the final touring party. During the journey to Europe the tour management decided to play Caughey at second five-eighth, in which position he played 20 tour matches including three of the four tests. Caughey scored 14 tries on tour including a hat-trick against [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]], which were the only tries of his international career.&lt;ref name="espn"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Huw|title=A different world of All Blacks|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/newzealand/rugby/story/142808.html|website=espn.co.uk|accessdate=4 December 2014|date=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caughey played two more tests for New Zealand, in 1936 and 1937, before business commitments ended his high-level rugby career. In addition to his nine full internationals he played 30 non-test games for the All Blacks, scoring 31 tries. Rugby journalist [[Terry McLean]], whose brother Hugh was a teammate of Caughey on the 1935–36 tour, described Caughey as 'an elegant and stylish back of English style' and [[Charlie Oliver (rugby union)|Charlie Oliver]], vice-captain of the 1935–36 tour, assessed him as 'a temperamental player. He was a world beater on his day and was in the match-winner class, but he was liable to be inconsistent. His dashing attacks, and wonderful sense of anticipation, were features of the team's play. His defence, however, was not up to the same standard'.&lt;ref name="espn"/&gt;

==Business and public life==
Caughey worked at the family department store, Smith &amp; Caughey, for 63 years beginning in 1930, and was managing director and chairman of the company for 30 years. He served on the Auckland Hospital Board for 25 years, including 15 years as chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businesshalloffame.co.nz/past-laureates/caughey-thomas-harcourt-clarke/ |title=Caughey, (Thomas Harcourt Clarke |date= |website= |publisher=Young Enterprise Trust |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1967 New Year Honours]], Caughey was appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] for community services, especially as chair of the Auckland Hospital Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=44212 |date=1 January 1967 |page=44 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, in the [[1972 New Year Honours]], he was made a [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]], for services to health administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=45556 |date=1 January 1972 |page=42 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed an [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Officer of the Order of St John]] in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=43613 |date=30 March 1965 |page=3197 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and promoted to Commander of the same order in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=44569 |date=19 April 1968 |page=4527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Caughey was awarded an honorary [[Legum Doctor|LLD]] by the [[University of Auckland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=University of Auckland Calendar 1987 |url=http://www.calendar.auckland.ac.nz/archive/1987-calendar.pdf |accessdate=16 November 2014 |page=20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in Auckland in 1993 and his ashes were buried in Purewa Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.purewa.co.nz/details.asp?id=7446&amp;type=Ashes%20Burial |title=Burial &amp; cremation details |date= |website= |publisher=Purewa Cemetery and Crematorium |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was posthumously inducted into the New Zealand business hall of fame in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Business laureates recognised at glittering gala | date=2 October 1998 | work=National Business Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Education in the U.S.}}
The '''Higher Education Act of 1965''' ('''HEA''') ({{USPL|89|329}}) was legislation signed into [[Law of the United States|United States law]] on November 8, 1965, as part of President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]] domestic agenda. Johnson chose [[Texas State University]] (then called "[[Texas State University#Name changes|Southwest Texas State College]]"), his [[alma mater]], as the signing site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/Johnson/lbjforkids/edu_whca370-text.shtm |title=Johnson signs legislation into law |publisher=LBJ Library and Museum |accessdate=October 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714005531/http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/lbjforkids/edu_whca370-text.shtm |archivedate=July 14, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was intended "to strengthen the educational resources of our colleges and universities and to provide financial assistance for students in postsecondary and higher education". It increased federal money given to universities, created scholarships, gave low-interest loans for students, and established a National Teachers Corps.  The "financial assistance for students" is covered in [[Title IV]] of the HEA.

The Higher Education Act of 1965 was reauthorized in 1968, 1972, 1976, 1980, 1986, 1992, 1998, and 2008. Current authorization for the programs in the Higher Education Act expired at the end of 2013, but has been extended through 2015 while Congress prepares changes and amendments. Before each re-authorization, Congress amends additional programs, changes the language and policies of existing programs, or makes other changes.

== 1965 Act ==
In January 1965, Representative [[Edith Green]] of Oregon introduced H. R. 3220 as a bill to "strengthen the educational resources of our colleges and universities and to provide financial assistance for students in postsecondary education."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://acsc.lib.udel.edu/exhibits/show/legislation/higher-education-act|title=Higher Education Act|last=|first=|date=|website=The Great Society Congress|publisher=Association of Centers for the Study of Congress|access-date=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Senator [[Wayne Morse]] of Oregon introduced the Senate version of the bill, S. 600.  The bills sought to create an advisor council to review teacher training programs and to create a [[National Teachers Corps|National Teacher Corps]], which would recruit teachers to serve in low-income areas and train teachers through internships.  Other provisions of the bills included financial aid, scholarships, work study, and library enhancements.  Throughout 1965 numerous hearings were held by Special Subcommittee on Education and the Education Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare held numerous hearings.  Based on the recommendations of University administrators, educators and student aid officers, a new bill was introduced:  H. R. 9567.  It was passed by the House of Representatives on August 26 and the Senate passed the bill on September 2.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In signing the Higher Education Act of 1965 into law, President Johnson said that the act, along with the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965]] as "keystones of the great, fabulous 89th Congress" that would spread "the roots of change and reform" throughout the nation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Changes in 1998==
The [[Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs]] (GEAR UP) was first authorized under the Higher Education Amendments of 1998.  Also in the amendments of 1998 is the Aid Elimination Provision, which prevents students with drug charges from receiving federal aid for colleges and universities.  This is where question 31 on the [[FAFSA]] forms originates. The question asks whether the student has ever been convicted of a [[drug-related crime|drug crime]] while receiving federal financial aid. This statutory provision was upheld by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]] in the face of a constitutional challenge by the [[ACLU]] in the case of ''Students for Sensible Drug Policy v. Spellings''.&lt;ref&gt;{{caselaw source | case = ''Students for Sensible Drug Policy v. Spellings'', 523 F.3d 896 (8th cir., 2008) | findlaw = https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-8th-circuit/1386070.html | other_source1 = LexisOne | other_url1 = http://www.lexisone.com/lx1/caselaw/freecaselaw?action=OCLGetCaseDetail&amp;format=FULL&amp;sourceID=gdjc&amp;searchTerm=eTEf.HLZa.UYGY.Cdfb&amp;searchFlag=y&amp;l1loc=FCLOW | other_source2 = Law.com | other_url2 = http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202421214044&amp;slreturn=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- I think this information works better in its own section, because it is not a summary of the article, where it used to be --&gt;

The amendments also included a provision [HEA Section 487(a)(23)] requiring universities to make a good faith effort to encourage voter registration of students on their campuses. This requirement applies only to institutions located in states that require voter registration prior to election day and do not allow registration the day of the election. Institutions receive registration forms from the state after requesting them at least 120 days prior to the voter registration deadline, and must make them "widely available" to students.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rit.edu/fa/grms/compliance/statutes/Voter_Registration_Provision_in_Higher_Education_Amendments_of_1998.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes in 2003==
&lt;!-- None of the links in these references work!--&gt;In 2003, much of the Higher Education Act was set to expire. As a result, a number of minority groups united to ask for certain changes. Calling themselves the Alliance for Equity in Higher Education, this group was made up of "the [[American Indian Higher Education Consortium]], the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, and the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, an advocacy group for [[historically black colleges and universities]], [and they] presented their joint recommendations for the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act."&lt;ref name="burd"&gt;Stephen Burd, "Institutions Serving Minority Students Propose Changes to Higher Education Act," ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' 49, no. 26 (2003), http://web.ebscohost.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The Alliance aimed to help minority students enter fields where they seemed to be underrepresented and to give incentives to minorities to enter these programs. These incentives included more lenience on loan collection and full government funding for minority education. The Alliance also called for the government to create funding for students in graduate programs of universities serving the minority population.&lt;ref name="burd"/&gt;

Even though the Alliance's request to change the Higher Education Act was heard, significant parts were denied. In 2003, the request for increasing the amount offered in a [[Pell Grant]], to better cover a student's expenses, was denied by the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;"Capital briefs," ''Community College Week'' 16, no. 4 (2003): 3, http://web.ebscohost.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, other issues were corrected. There was a section passed, by the House, that did allow more funds to go to institutions, in order to keep them current; and a grace period for colleges asking for more loans was eliminated. So, if more funding were needed, minority institutions would not have to wait.&lt;ref&gt;Kristina Lane, "Bill Would Expand Higher Ed. Access for Minorities, Low-Income Students," ''Community College Week'' 16, no. 4 (2003): 3, http://web.ebscohost.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2008 reauthorization==
{{US student loans}}
With the changes proposed in 2003, the actual Higher Education Act was not reauthorized. Instead, many of its sections were renewed, with little radical change. Numerous extensions have followed, with the most recent extension lasting through August 15, 2008. The Senate passed an HEA reauthorization bill in July 2007, as did the House of Representatives in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Strong Step for Students: House Higher Education Bill Promotes Innovation and Student Success|publisher=[[Center for Law and Social Policy]]|url=http://www.clasp.org/admin/site/publications/files/0401.pdf|accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 14, 2008, the [[Higher Education Opportunity Act]] (Public Law 110-315) (HEOA) was enacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congress Expands Basic Aid and Supports Innovation in Student Success, Basic Skills, and Workforce Partnerships|publisher=Center for Law and Social Policy|url=http://www.clasp.org/admin/site/publications/files/0430.pdf|accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reauthorized the amended version of the Higher Education Act of 1965.&lt;ref name="ED.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/policy/highered/leg/hea08/index.html|title=Higher Education Opportunity Act - 2008|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act made major changes in student loan discharges for disabled people. Previously, to qualify for a discharge, a disabled person could have no income. This has been changed to a no "substantial gainful activity" test, which is the same standard used by the [[Social Security Administration]] in determining eligibility for [[Social Security Disability Insurance]] (SSDI). The changes took effect on July 1, 2010.

Also included in the 2008 revision of the HEOA were provisions requiring action by U.S. colleges and universities to combat illegal file sharing.&lt;ref name="Educause.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educause.edu/library/higher-education-opportunity-act-heoa|title=Higher Education Opportunity Act Anti-P2P provisions - 2008|publisher=Educause|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following significant lobbying by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) and [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), the additions to the HEOA of 2008 included requirements that all U.S. colleges and universities (1) release and annual disclosure to students regarding copyright laws and associated campus policies, (2) a written plan, submitted to the Department of Education, to combat copyright abuse using one or more technology-based deterrents, and (3) an offer to students of alternatives to illegal downloading.&lt;ref name="Law Offices of Zick Rubin Memo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/EPO0938.pdf|title=Dealing With the Higher Education Opportunity Act's New Copyright Protection Requirement|publisher=Law Offices of Zick Rubin|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant controversy surrounded the inclusion of anti-P2P legislation into HEOA of 2008, resulting in a letter from a number of leaders in higher education.&lt;ref name="Opposing Letter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/CSD5226.pdf|title=Letter Opposing The Inclusion Of The Entertainment Industry Proposal On Illegal File Sharing In The HEA Sent By The Higher Education Members Of The Joint Committee|publisher=Educause|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the [[College Cost Reduction and Access Act]] (CCRA), a budget reconciliation bill signed into law in September 2007, made significant changes to federal financial aid programs included in HEA. In addition to increasing the maximum [[Pell Grant]] award and reducing interest rates on subsidized student loans, this bill capped loan repayment at 15% of an individual’s [[discretionary income]], raised the income protection allowance, enacted loan forgiveness for public servants in the Direct Loan program, set publicly funded student loans to fixed rates from variable rate loans, and took actions to address problematic practices in the lending industry. Most CCRA provisions took effect on October 1, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[[American Association of University Women]]. ''Increasing Access to Higher Education''. January 2008. [http://www.aauw.org/advocacy/issue_advocacy/actionpages/upload/higherEdAct.pdf http://www.aauw.org/advocacy/issue_advocacy/actionpages/upload/higherEdAct.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The law for the first time also required post-secondary institutions be more transparent about costs and required the nearly 7,000 post-secondary institutions that receive federal financial aid funds (Title IV) to post net price calculators on their websites as well as security and copyright policies by October 29, 2011.

As defined in HEOA, the net price calculator's purpose is "to help current and prospective students, families, and other consumers estimate the individual net price of an institution of higher education for a student. The [net price] calculator shall be developed in a manner that enables current and prospective students, families, and consumers to determine an estimate of a current or prospective student’s individual net price at a particular institution."

The law defines "estimated net price" as the difference between an institution's average total Price of Attendance (the sum of tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies, and other expenses including personal expenses and transportation for a first-time, full-time undergraduate students who receive aid) and the institution's median need- and merit-based grant aid awarded.

Elise Miller, program director for the [[United States Department of Education]]'s [[Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System]] ([[IPEDS]]), stated the idea behind the requirement: "We just want to break down the myth of sticker price and get beyond it. This is to give students some indication that they will not [necessarily] be paying that full price."&lt;ref&gt;U''niversity Business: Preparing for the Net Price Calculator: Avoid Potential Pitfalls by Taking These Steps Today'' By Haley Chitty, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The template was developed based on the suggestions of the IPEDS' Technical Review Panel (TRP), which met on January 27–28, 2009, and included 58 individuals representing federal and state governments, post-secondary institutions from all sectors, association representatives, and template contractors. Mary Sapp, assistant vice president for planning and institutional research at the University of Miami, served as the panel's chair. She described the mandate's goal "to provide prospective and current undergraduate students with some insight into the difference between an institution's sticker price and the price they will end up paying".

The TRP faced the difficult challenge of creating one tool that could be used by a wide variety of institutions – from small, for-profit career schools to major research universities – while balancing simplicity for users.

To meet the requirement, post-secondary institutions may choose either a basic template developed by the U.S. Department of Education or an alternate net price calculator that offers at least the minimum elements required by law.

As part of its cost-transparency measures, HEOA of 2008 requires also on the College Navigator Web site a report giving the average institutional net price of attendance for first-time, full-time students who receive financial aid. This also forms the basis for transparency lists; a report on the College Navigator Web site the institutional net price of attendance for Title IV aid recipients by income categories; and for the [[U.S. Department of Education]] to develop a multi-year tuition and required-fees calculator for undergraduate programs for the College Navigator Web site.

The HEA has been criticized for establishing statutory pricing of federal student loans based on political considerations rather than pricing based on risk.&lt;ref name = Simkovic&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1941070 Risk-Based Student Loans] (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act also maintained the requirement that universities must make an effort to register students to vote. A 2013 Dear Colleague letter from the U.S. Department of Education stated that universities “must make the voter registration forms widely available to [their] students and distribute the forms individually to [their] degree or certificate program students who are physically in attendance at [their] institution. Distribution by regular or electronic mail is permitted.”&lt;ref&gt;https://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/GEN1317.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title VI==

During this reform period of 2008, Title VI of the HEA was reviewed.&lt;ref name="Hegji, Alexandra 2014"&gt;Hegji, Alexandra. 2014. The Higher Education Act (HEA): A Primer. Congressional Research Service.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Title VI provides federal funds to 129 international studies and foreign language centers at universities nationwide.&lt;ref name="brandeiscenter.com"&gt;Brandeis Center 2014- http://brandeiscenter.com/publications/research_opinion_full/joint_statement_on_the_misuse_of_federal_funds_under_title_vi&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of this act is to ensure and encourage diverse perspectives in order to enhance national security. As such, Title VI supplies grants for international language studies, business and international education programs as well as international policy.&lt;ref name="Hegji, Alexandra 2014"/&gt; Moreover, the recipients of these funds are required to engage in ‘public outreach’ for K-12, teachers, educators and the general public.&lt;ref name="brandeiscenter.com"/&gt;

Over the past decade concerns have been raised over these title VI funded programs. Conservative critics have emphasized that many of the international programs funded engage in biased, anti-American and anti-Israel rhetoric, with no offers of counterbalance.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Kurtz 2007- the national review -taking sides on title VI- http://www.nationalreview.com/article/223078/taking-sides-title-vi-stanley-kurtz&lt;/ref&gt;

Certainly, a 2006 review mandated by Congress found that the programs were not reaching their goals. Seeking to rectify this, Congress expressed the need for greater oversight by the Department of Education, as well as an investigation to ensure these programs reflected "diverse perspectives".&lt;ref&gt;U.S Department of Education- http://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/leg/hea08/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these reforms, the issues within Title VI have been deemed endemic. Writing in ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', [[Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights under Law|Louis D. Brandeis Center]] Founder [[Kenneth L. Marcus]] argued that "title VI doesn’t need to be tweaked-it needs to be overhauled".&lt;ref name="The Hill"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/education/218110-title-vi-and-campus-bias | title=Title VI and campus bias | work=The Hill | date=September 19, 2014 | accessdate=February 17, 2017 | author=[[Marcus, Kenneth L.]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration followed a joint statement released by 10 groups on September 17, 2014, which the Brandeis Center coordinated.

This joint statement expressed the deep concerns over the misuse of tax payer money, arguing that "these outreach programs, which have no congressional oversight, often disseminate anti-American and anti-Israel falsehoods."&lt;ref name="chronicle.com"&gt;Peter Schmidt, 2014, [http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/supporters-of-israel-say-programs-in-middle-east-studies-misuse-u-s-funds/86245 Supporters of Israel Say Programs in Middle East Studies Misuse U.S. Funds]
&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the groups voiced the opinion that " too often exclude scholars with diverse perspectives while stifling discourse on critical issues. The biased learning environment that results suppresses the academic freedom of students and faculty with different views. At some institutions, students are afraid to disagree with their professors."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://brandeiscenter.com/images/uploads/news/jointstatement.pdf Joint Statement on the Misuse of Federal Funds Under Title VI, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; 
This statement was accompanied by a white paper published by the Brandeis Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://brandeiscenter.com/images/uploads/practices/antisemitism_whitepaper.pdf | title=The Morass of Middle East Studies: Title VI of the Higher Education Act and Federally Funded Area Studies (Rev. Ed.) | publisher=Louis D. Brandeis Center | date=November 2014 | accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a report by the [[AMCHA Initiative]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amchainitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CNES-Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; underscoring the negative effects this biased perspective produces on campuses, UCLA specifically.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"&gt;Inside Higher ED- Pro-Israel Groups Question Federal Funds for Middle East Centers https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/09/18/pro-israel-groups-question-federal-funds-middle-east-centers&lt;/ref&gt; The AMCHA study found that "any time UCLA’s center sponsored or co-sponsored an event mentioning Israel from Fall 2010 to Spring 2013, 93% of the time the mention was negative and critical – as if Israel is a blight on the planet."&lt;ref name="The Hill"/&gt;

UCLA's media relations office issued a statement saying that the university "remains dedicated to complying with all federal laws and respecting the free and open exchange of ideas representing diverse viewpoints." &lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;

In light of such issues, the joint statement calls for changes in the Title VI program which would 1) "[r]equire recipients of Title VI funds to establish grievance procedures to address complaints that programs are not reflecting diverse perspectives and a wide range of views" and 2) "[r]equire the [[U.S. Department of Education]] to establish a formal complaint-resolution process similar to that in use to enforce Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964." &lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;

Responding to this statement Amy W. Newhall, executive director of the [[Middle East Studies Association of North America]] (MESA), asserted that MESA "resolutely opposes all forms of hate speech and discrimination, including anti-Semitism," but "is concerned that some of the reports issued by partisan political groups based outside academia may actually weaken efforts to combat anti-Semitism by portraying all criticism of Israeli policies as a form of anti-Semitism or as ‘anti-Israel.’" &lt;ref name="chronicle.com"/&gt;

However, as Kenneth L. Marcus asserts in a letter to the editor of ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' the co-signatories of the joint statement " urge the opposite: accountability systems to ensure that these programs offer the diversity of perspectives that existing law requires."&lt;ref&gt;http://chronicle.com/blogs/letters/our-goal-is-not-to-shut-down-open-discussion/&lt;/ref&gt;
As said statement concludes: "Arguably, Title VI programs no longer serve a legitimate purpose...  In 2011, Congress reduced Title VI funding nationwide by 40 percent, from $34 million to $18 million.  Unless effective and necessary reforms can be enacted, Congress may have to consider reducing or eliminating Title VI funding from Middle East studies centers." &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Extension of HEA==
After being reauthorized in 2008, the Higher Education Act was set to expire in 2013, but was re-extended to allow Congress time to work on the next reauthorization.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acenet.edu/advocacy/Pages/Higher-Education-Act.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017, House Republicans announced that they had finalized an overhaul of the act, authored primarily by Representative Virginia Foxx of (R - N.C.), the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. The new bill is called the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success and Prosperity Through Education Reform (PROSPER) Act. The act aims to simplify the federal financial aid process and expand federal work study programs. It would also repeal two Obama-era programs -  “gainful employment” and “borrower defense” - aimed at preventing financial exploitation of undergraduates, as well as bar their readoption.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/us/politics/house-republican-higher-education-bill-obama.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Committee spokesman Michael Woeste, “the reforms within the PROSPER Act are necessary to provide students with a high-quality education, and fix a system that has not been serving their needs.”&lt;ref&gt; https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/02/07/cbo-estimates-show-house-higher-ed-bill-could-hit-student-loan-borrowers-hard/?utm_term=.7595e5ca5cba &lt;/ref&gt;

Some concerns have been raised by advocacy groups about how the PROSPER Act would affect LGBTQ students. According to the Human Rights Campaign, “The PROSPER Act contains several provisions that would allow for the use of religion to justify otherwise prohibited discrimination that could negatively impact LGBTQ students.”&lt;ref&gt;http://democrats-edworkforce.house.gov/media/press-releases/the-prosper-act-what-people-are-really-saying-continued_&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the PROSPER Act includes a weaker version of the provision requiring universities to increase student voter registration, a requirement present in the Higher Education Act since 1998. Critics worry that this change will lead to lower youth turnout in elections, as voter turnout is already historically lowest among young voters.

'''Ingrid Antonijevic Hahn''' (born 22 July 1952) is a Chilean [[economist]], [[entrepreneur]], [[academic]] and former [[Ministry of Economy, Development and Reconstruction (Chile)|Minister of Economy, Development and Reconstruction]] (2006) for only two months, in the first cabinet of [[socialist]] [[President of Chile|president]] [[Michelle Bachelet]]. In her youth, she was a militant in the [[Popular Unitary Action Movement|MAPU]] organisation, and after the end of the [[Pinochet]] regime she was one of the founders of the [[Party for Democracy (Chile)|Party for Democracy]] (''Partido Por la Democracia a.k.a. PPD'') that has led the transition towards democracy in [[Chile]]. She is a progressive entrepreneur who promotes [[corporate social responsibility]] and the involvement of the [[private sector]] in projects initiated by the government that aim to benefit the whole country. She has acquired notoriety in her country for holding positions in organisations that have traditionally been held by men.

==Biography==
Antonijevic was born in the northern Chilean port city of [[Iquique]] in the [[Tarapacá Region]] to a politically right-wing [[upper middle class]] family. She is the youngest daughter of [[Croats|Croatian]] [[immigrant]] and entrepreneur, Leandro Antonijevic Bezmalinović, and Ingeborg Hahn Von Neumann from [[Germany]].

At the age of 7 her family transferred to [[Santiago, Chile]] where she continued her education and excelled academically, graduating in economics from the [[University of Chile]]. As a young student radical she became a militant in the [[Popular Unitary Action Movement|MAPU organisation]] that formed part of the [[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity]] coalition headed by [[Salvador Allende]] that was overthrown in a [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|military coup]] on September 11, 1973.

In 2006 she was awarded the ''Circle of Honour'' by the [[University of Chile]] in recognition of her services to the [[public sector]] and for being among the most prominent graduates of this university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.fen.uchile.cl/index.php/main/contenido/cont/6 Excellence and Global Vision – Facultad Economía y Negocios Universidad de Chile]&lt;/ref&gt;

Antonijevic was interested in [[meditation]] for many years before she became a devotee of [[Buddhist meditation|zen meditation]] after a holiday in [[Japan]], where she became a student of zen Buddhist priest [[Gudo Wafu Nishijima]]. She lives and works in [[Santiago, Chile]] and promotes zen meditation among her employees in the workplace. She has two elder sisters, Nadja and Ilona, two children, Felipe and Carolina Saint Jean, and two grandchildren.

'''Dr. Ivo Stern''' (24 December 1889 – 1961) was Croatian lawyer, writer, journalist, director and founder of the "Zagreb Radiostation" (now [[Croatian Radiotelevision]]).&lt;ref name="žz"&gt;{{harvtxt|Snješka Knežević|2011|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nacional2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/14093/zidovi-koji-su-izgradili-moderni-zagreb |title=Židovi koji su izgradili moderni Zagreb |date=15 February 2005 |issue=483 |first1=Robert |last1=Bajruši |first2=Marina |last2=Biluš |first3=Viktor |last3=Zahtila |publisher=[[Nacional (weekly)|Nacional]] |language=Croatian |accessdate=4 July 2012 |trans-title=Jews who built modern Zagreb |archivedate=4 July 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68u49L46k?url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/14093/zidovi-koji-su-izgradili-moderni-zagreb |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stern was born to a wealthy [[Jew]]ish family on 24 December 1889 in [[Zagreb]].&lt;ref name="žz"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nacional2/&gt; He studied and graduated at the Faculty of Law at the [[University of Zagreb]] in 1913. After graduation, he practiced the law for a while. After [[World War I]], in which he participated as a soldier in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], Stern lived in [[Vienna]]. In 1926 as the head of the Zagreb group of bankers and industrials, despite the opposition from [[Belgrade]], Stern founded the "Zagreb Radiostation". Stern was first director and major shareholder of the "Zagreb Radiostation". He was also the program editor until 1938. Stern was close friend of Croatian writer [[Milan Begović]].&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Usp. podatke iz radova N. Vončine, nav. u bilj. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Usp.

Distinctly higher in education, polyglot, charming and elegant, financially independent, Stern fraternize with many Croatian writers. His apartment in Jurišićeva street was a place of elegant banquets. He was a member of the Croatian [[Freemasonry]] and founder of the elite "Rotary Club" which had predominantly Masonic membership.&lt;ref name="nb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Nikola Batušić; Neke podatke o Ivi Sternu dugujem svome ocu dr.

Ivani Batušić (1912), koja je sredinom tridesetih godina upoznala Sterna.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stern wrote left pacifist oriented emphatic expressive poetry, which was published in the magazine "Plamen". He also wrote political [[feuilleton]]s. One of his feuilletons was devoted to the problem of the Jewish diaspora in the new post-war Europe, for which he was criticized and accused that he represents the [[Jewish messianism]] of [[Bolshevik]]s, [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Béla Kun]].&lt;ref name="nb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} O smislu lutanja — problem jevrejske rase — politički feljton, br. 9, str. 85 — 87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Usp. bilj. br. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jameson Cell''' is a high-intensity [[froth flotation]] cell that was invented by Laureate Professor [[Graeme Jameson]] of the [[University of Newcastle (Australia)]] and developed in conjunction with [[Mount Isa Mines]] Limited ("MIM", a subsidiary of [[MIM Holdings Limited]] and now part of the [[Glencore]] group of companies).&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991"&gt;G J Jameson, G Harbort and N Riches, "The development and application of the Jameson Cell," in: ''Fourth Mill Operators' Conference, Burnie, Tasmania, 10–14 March 1991'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1991), 45–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
[[File:Jameson Cells pictured adjacent to flotation columns at the Mount Isa lead-zinc concentrator.png|thumbnail|Figure 1. Comparison of the sizes of conventional column flotation cells and Jameson Cells with similar capacities.]]

The high intensity of the Jameson Cell means that it is much shorter than conventional [[Froth flotation#Flotation equipment|column flotation cells]] (see Figure 1), and it does not require air compressors to aerate the suspension of ground ore particles and water (known as a ''[[slurry]]'' or ''pulp'') in the flotation cell.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1992"&gt;G J Jameson, "Flotation cell development," in: ''The AusIMM Annual Conference, Broken Hill, New South Wales, 17–21 May 1992'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1992), 25–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of a requirement for compressed air and the lack of moving parts means that power consumption is less than for the equivalent mechanical or conventional column flotation cell.&lt;ref name = "Young2013"&gt;M F Young, K E Barnes, G S Anderson and J D Pease, [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/Downloads/technical%20papers/Jameson%20Cell%20-%20%20The%20Comeback%20in%20Base%20Metal%20Applications%20Using%20Improved%20Design%20and%20Flow%20Sheets.pdf.

Accessed 23 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In contrast to most types of [[Froth flotation#Flotation equipment|flotation cell]], the Cell introduces the feed and the air to the Cell in a combined stream via one or more cylindrical columns referred to as "downcomers". Other types of flotation cell typically introduce the feed and the air separately to the cell.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1992"/&gt;

The Cell produces fast mineral flotation rates, especially for very fine mineral particles.&lt;ref name = "Young2013"/&gt; It produces high concentrate grades from fast floating liberated particles &lt;ref name = "Barns2009"&gt;K E Barns, P J Colbert and P D Munro, "Designing the optimal flotation circuit – the Prominent Hill case," in: ''Tenth Mill Operators' Conference, Adelaide, South Australia, 12–14 October 2009'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2009), 173–182.&lt;/ref&gt; and is able to do this from a single stage of flotation.&lt;ref name = "Barns2009"/&gt; The high carrying capacity of the Jameson Cell is particularly beneficial when high yields (mass pulls) are required, such as in recleaning in metals flotation and in the flotation of metallurgical coal, where yields can exceed 80%.&lt;ref name = "Araya"&gt;R Araya, L Huynh, M Young and K Arburo, "Solving challenges in copper cleaning circuits with the Jameson Cell," to be presented at: Procemin 2013,Santiago, Chile, 15–18 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operating principles==

Froth flotation is achieved by mixing chemicals known as collectors with the ore slurry. The collectors adsorb onto the surfaces of the particles of select minerals (usually the valuable mineral that is targeted for concentration), making these minerals hydrophobic. Air is passed through the slurry in a tank known as a flotation cell. The air is broken into tiny bubbles by various mechanisms (depending on the design of the flotation cell), and the now-hydrophobic minerals attach to the bubbles, rising with them to the surface of the flotation cell, where they form a [[froth]]. The froth flows over the top edge (or "lip") of the flotation cell and forms the flotation concentrate. Ideally, none of the unwanted mineral particles float, and they remain behind as the flotation [[tailings]].

However, the selectivity of the collection mechanism is not perfect. Some unwanted ("[[gangue]]") minerals are also carried into the froth, largely by entrainment with the water rising with the bubbles. This is particularly the case for particles less than 10&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] in size.&lt;ref name = "Johnson2002"&gt;N W Johnson and P D Munro, "Overview of flotation technology and plant practice for complex sulphide [sic] ores," in: ''Mineral Processing Plant Design, Practice and Control'', Eds A L Mular, D N Halbe and D J Barratt (Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration: Littleton, Colorado, 2002), 1097–1123.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the gangue particles follow the water between the bubbles as it drains back to the underlying pulp. This process can be assisted by the application of sufficient "wash water" to the froth to displace the water entrained with the bubbles and the fine gangue particles brought with them.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1992"/&gt; Column flotation cells, invented in Canada by Boutin and Tremblay in 1961,&lt;ref name = "Clingan"&gt;B V Clingan and D R McGregor, "Column flotation experience at Magma Copper Company, with related experience of other mineral processors," presented at the ''SME Annual Meeting, Denver, Colorado, 24–27 February 1987''. Preprint 87-91.&lt;/ref&gt; grew increasingly popular in the 1980s and 1990s as a way of reducing entrainment of fine gangue particles during "cleaning" of flotation concentrates.&lt;ref name = "Johnson2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Lane"&gt;G S Lane and R C Dunne, "Column flotation – an Australian perspective," in: ''The AusIMM Kalgoorlie Branch, Equipment in the Minerals Industry: Exploration, Mining and Processing Conference, Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, October 1987'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1987), 81–93.&lt;/ref&gt; With heights usually between 6 and 14 meters,&lt;ref name = "Dobby"&gt;G Dobby, "Column Flotation," in: ''Mineral Processing Plant Design, Practice and Control'', Eds A L Mular, D N Halbe and D J Barratt (Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration: Littleton, Colorado, 2002), 1239–1252.&lt;/ref&gt; they could have froth depths up to 2&amp;nbsp;m,&lt;ref name = "Lane"/&gt; providing more residence time than conventional cells and more stable froth surfaces that enable better froth washing.
[[File:FlCell.PNG|thumbnail|Figure 2. A schematic diagram illustrating the operating principles of a conventional, mechanically agitated flotation cell.]]

Froth flotation efficiency is determined by a series of probabilities: those of particle–bubble contact, particle–bubble attachment, transport between the pulp and the froth, and froth collection into the product launder.&lt;ref name = "Atkinson"&gt;B W Atkinson, C J Conway and G J Jameson, "Fundamentals of Jameson Cell operation including size–yield response," in: ''Sixth Australian Coal Preparation Conference, Mackay, Queensland, 6–9 September 1993'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a conventional mechanically agitated cell, the void fraction is low (5–10%) and the bubble size is large (2–3&amp;nbsp;mm), which results in a low interfacial area with a low probability of particle–bubble contact.&lt;ref name = "Atkinson"/&gt; In a conventional flotation column, the void fraction is similarly low, and so the probability of particle–bubble contact is increased by increasing the height of the column to provide greater residence time.&lt;ref name = "Atkinson"/&gt;

Traditionally, the ore slurry and the air are introduced separately to the flotation cell (see Figure 2). The Jameson Cell differs from this traditional approach by mixing the slurry with the air in the downcomers.
[[File:Jameson Cell downcomer.png|thumbnail|Figure 3. The Jameson Cell downcomer.]]
 
The slurry is introduced at the top of the downcomer as a jet that draws in air through a second pipe to form a stable two-phase mixture (see Figure 3).&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991"/&gt; The plunging slurry jet shears and then entrains the air.&lt;ref name = "Harbort2004"&gt;G Harbort, J Cowburn and E V Manlapig, [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/Downloads/technical%20papers/Recovery%20interactions%20between%20the%20froth%20zone,%20pulp%20zone%20and%20downcomer%20within%20a%20Jameson%20Cell.pdf. "Recovery interactions between the froth zone, pulp zone and downcomer within a Jameson Cell,"] in: ''10th Australian Coal Preparation Conference, Pokolbin, New South Wales, 17–21 October 2004'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2004).

Accessed 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; before it is discharged into the tank portion of the Jameson Cell (see Figure 4).&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991"/&gt; The downcomer is designed to provide high-intensity mixing of the air and the slurry to generate a dense foam of fine bubbles and maximise the contact between the target mineral particles and the bubbles.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991a"&gt;G J Jameson and E V Manlapig, "Flotation cell design – experiences with the Jameson Cell," in: ''Extractive Metallurgy Conference, Perth, Western Australia, 2–4 October 1991'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1991), 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The probability of particle–bubble contact is "virtually 100%" with a slurry residence time in the downcomer of 5–10 seconds.&lt;ref name = "Atkinson"/&gt;
[[File:Diagram of a Jameson Cell.png|thumbnail|Figure 4. A cut-away drawing showing a typical Jameson Cell design.]] 
 
The high probability of particle–bubble contact, and subsequent short residence times (five to ten seconds in the downcomer,&lt;ref name = "Atkinson"/&gt; allows for a much more compact column design than conventional column flotation cells (see Figure 1).&lt;ref name = "Jameson1992"/&gt; The fine nature of the bubbles (0.3 to 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter&lt;ref name = "Barns2009"/&gt;) gives them enhanced carrying capabilities for fine mineral particles.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1992"/&gt; Fine bubbles also improve the separation of minerals, as they intensify the difference in the flotation kinetics of the valuable minerals from the gangue minerals, thus allowing higher grade concentrates to be produced.&lt;ref name = "Araya"/&gt;

The foam in the downcomer is about 50–60% air.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991a"/&gt; Because of this, the pulp is distributed in the form of thin interfacial slurry films between the bubbles, providing an ideal environment for particle–bubble contact.&lt;ref name = "Atkinson"/&gt; Collection occurs by migration of the particles within the thin films, which are not much thicker than the diameter of the particles.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991a"/&gt;
 
The best collection occurs when the volume of air roughly equals that of the injected slurry.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991a"/&gt;

The Cell is operated by initially closing the air inlet at the top of the downcomer and feeding the flotation pulp in through the nozzle.&lt;ref name = "Evans"/&gt; The air in the downcomer is entrained in the pulp, creating a partial vacuum that draws pulp from the tank up into the downcomer.&lt;ref name = "Evans"/&gt; The pulp level quickly reaches the nozzle, which is at a level above that of the liquid level in the tank.&lt;ref name = "Evans"/&gt; This creates a hydrostatic head in the downcomer, meaning that the pressure inside the top of the downcomer is lower than the atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref name = "Evans"/&gt; When the inlet is opened, air is drawn into the top space of the downcomer by this lower pressure, where it too is entrained into the downcomer contents by the plunging jet.&lt;ref name = "Evans"/&gt; At the same time, a downward flow is established in the pulp in the downcomer that is sufficient to counter the buoyancy of the bubbles, and the aerated pulp discharges into the tank.&lt;ref name = "Evans"/&gt;

Once in the tank, the wider cross sectional area of the tank reduces the downward superficial velocity of the mixture,&lt;ref name = "Evans"/&gt; allowing mineral-laden bubbles to disengage from the liquid&lt;ref name = "Evans"/&gt; and rise to the surface as they would in a conventional cell, where they form the froth.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991"/&gt; The velocity of the mixture discharging into the tank, and the large density differential between it and the remainder of the pulp in the tank, results in recirculating fluid patterns that keep the particles in the tank in suspension without requiring mechanical agitation.&lt;ref name = "Harbort2004"/&gt;

The purpose of the tank is simply for bubble–pulp separation, so the volume of the tank is small compared with alternative technologies.&lt;ref name = "Barns2009"/&gt;

The froth that forms at the top of the tank flows over its lip to be collected. This froth can be "washed" by a light flow of water, if desired.&lt;ref name = "Readett"/&gt; The bubbles flowing over the lip of the cell are smaller in diameter than those that flow over the lip of conventional flotation columns.&lt;ref name = "Young2013"/&gt;

==History==

The Jameson Cell grew out of a long-term research program aimed at improving the recovery of fine particles by flotation. The work started at [[Imperial College London]], and continued when Jameson moved in 1978 to the University of Newcastle, NSW, Australia, where he is Laureate Professor (2015).

===Academic research  (1969–1990)===

Jameson’s research into flotation began when he was at Imperial College London, in 1969. A colleague, Dr J A Kitchener of the Royal School of Mines, pointed out that many of the new mineral deposits being found around the world required fine grinding to separate the valuable particles from the rock in which they were embedded, and the flotation technologies available at the time were relatively inefficient for recovering fine particles. Kitchener felt that improvements could best be achieved by an increased knowledge of the physics of flotation, rather than the chemistry of the reagents. Jameson had gained some expertise in the properties of bubbles and particles in suspensions whilst a PhD student at Cambridge. He began research into the fluid mechanics of the flotation process and set in train a series of experimental projects into the effect of particle diameter and bubble size on the flotation rate constant. Much of the research was conducted by honours students in chemical engineering. Jameson accepted the challenge of coming up with practical solutions to remedy the situation, if these could be identified.

Jameson’s research showed that the kinetics of flotation of fine particles was a strong function of the bubble diameter&lt;ref name = "Collins1976"&gt;Collins, G.L. and Jameson, G.J., 1976. Experiments on the flotation of fine particles - the effect of particle size and charge. Chemical Engineering Science 31, 985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Ahmed1985"&gt;Ahmed, N.A. and Jameson, G.J., 1985. The effect of bubble size on the rate of flotation of fine particles, International Journal of Mineral Processing 14, 195-215.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the way to improve recoveries was to use small bubbles in the order of 300&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter. What was needed was a practical method of making such bubbles in large quantities, of the order of billions per second. The device needed to be simple to construct and operate, capable of running for long periods with minimal maintenance, and should be resistant to blockage by stray large particles in the feed. He began to look at the theory of bubble breakup in sheared flows, that is, in flow fields in which layers of liquid slide over each other. Lewis and Davidson&lt;ref name = "Lewis1982"&gt;Lewis, D.A. and Davidson, J.F., 1982. Bubble splitting in shear flow. Trans IChemE, 60: 283-291.&lt;/ref&gt; had recently published a theory to predict the maximum size of bubbles in a well-characterised flow environment. By balancing the forces acting on a bubble in a shearing flow, including the disruptive dynamic stresses from the liquid motion and the restoring force of surface tension, it was possible to predict the critical shear rate required to produce a bubble of given size. Jameson then looked for simple and practical ways of generating the required shear rates, and found inspiration in the kitchen sink. If a jet of water from a tap plunges into a basin full of water, a shear layer develops around the jet, that entrains air from the atmosphere into the water, and at the same time, breaks up the entrained air into fine bubbles. The effect is magnified if there is a detergent in the water. Detergents, known as frothers, are used in flotation to prevent bubble coalescence, and to create stable froths. By the correct choice of jet velocity and diameter, it is possible to provide a controlled shear environment that can generate bubbles of a suitable size for flotation, with the added advantage that the air is naturally aspirated by the jet, so there is no need for a compressor or blower. Thus the idea of the Jameson Cell was born.

After a number of failures, the radical new process for flotation emerged in the laboratory at the University of Newcastle. Jameson filed a provisional patent application in 1986. After an initial trial at the [[Renison Bell]] tin mine in Tasmania, certain design features were modified. He led a further plant trial with a small cell in the lead-zinc concentrator at [[Mount Isa Mines|Mt Isa Mines Ltd]] in Queensland, initially working alone. The plant metallurgists took an interest in the technology and helped to refine it, particularly checking the scale-up procedures that Jameson had devised. In 1988 a recent graduate was assigned full-time for a year to verify and validate the performance of the Cell. In 1989 a worldwide exclusive license was negotiated between Tunra Ltd on behalf of the University of Newcastle, Jameson, and MIM Holdings Limited, for the use of the Cell for metallurgical purposes. Summary papers on the theory&lt;ref name = "Jameson1993"&gt;Jameson, G.J., 1993. Bubbles in motion, Transactions of the Institution of Chemical Engineers A71, 587-594.&lt;/ref&gt; and practice&lt;ref name = "Evans"/&gt; have been published.

There have been ongoing significant changes to the design of the Cell since it was first developed in the late 1980s.

===Trouble in the mill (1980s)===

The commercial development of the Cell occurred indirectly as a result of problems being experienced in MIM's Mount Isa lead–zinc concentrator (sometimes referred to as a "mill" in the mining industry). MIM had been operating a lead–zinc concentrator at Mount Isa since 1931,&lt;ref name = "Young2000"&gt;M F Young, J D Pease and K S Fisher, "The George Fisher project to increase recovery in the Mount Isa lead/zinc concentrator," in: ''Seventh Mill Operators' Conference, Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, 12–14 October 2000'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2000), 157–163.&lt;/ref&gt; although lead–zinc ore was substituted with copper ore for a time between mid-1943 and mid-1946.&lt;ref&gt;G Blainey, ''Mines in the Spinifex'', (Angus and Robertson: Sydney, 1960), 182–191.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the lead, zinc and other mineral grains in the ore became progressively finer, the ore grade decreased and it became more difficult to treat.&lt;ref name = "Young1997"&gt;M F Young, J D Pease, N W Johnson and P D Munro, "Developments in milling practice at the lead/zinc concentrator of Mount Isa Mines Limited from 1990," in: ''AusIMM Sixth Mill Operators' Conference, Madang, Papua New Guinea, 6–8 October 1997'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1997), 3–12.&lt;/ref&gt; These trends, combined with an increase in the concentrator's throughput, significantly reduced the concentrator's performance in the 1980s, resulting in a "tense" period of "an endless circle of circuit changes, reagent changes, operator changes, metallurgist changes, and so on".&lt;ref name = "Young1997"/&gt; The decreasing grain size and pushing the grinding circuit beyond its design throughput meant a reduction in the degree of separation of the individual mineral grains (referred to as "liberation") during grinding. From 1984 to 1991, the liberation of [[sphalerite]] (the zinc-bearing mineral, ZnS) decreased from almost 70% to just over 50%.&lt;ref name = "Young1997"/&gt; This decrease in liberation resulted in a reduction in the recovery of zinc to saleable zinc concentrate.&lt;ref name = "Young1997"/&gt;

The initial response to the problem of decreased zinc recovery was in 1986 to start to produce a lower-grade concentrate that was a mixture of zinc and lead (known in the industry as a "bulk concentrate" and referred to at Mount Isa as the "low-grade middlings concentrate").&lt;ref name = "Young1997"/&gt; This concentrate typically contained 34% zinc and 13% lead, compared to the normal zinc concentrate composition of at least 50% zinc and less than 3% lead.&lt;ref name = "Young1997"/&gt;

By producing the bulk concentrate, the total recovery of zinc for sale was maintained at over 70% until 1989.&lt;ref name = "Young1997"/&gt; However, the high lead content meant that the bulk concentrate could not be treated by the [[Zinc smelting#Electrolysis process|electrolytic zinc process]], and it had to be sold to zinc smelters using the more-expensive [[Zinc smelting#Blast furnace process (Imperial Smelting Process)|Imperial Smelting Process]]. Initially, MIM received good revenue from its bulk concentrate, but as the nature of the ore continued to deteriorate, the production of the bulk concentrate increased and saturated the market. Payment terms declined until MIM received less than half the payment for zinc in the bulk concentrate than it received for zinc in the zinc concentrate.&lt;ref name = "Young1997"/&gt;

The problems in the concentrator also affected the performance of MIM's Mount Isa lead smelter.&lt;ref name = "Young1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pease1997"&gt;J D Pease, M F Young, C J Greet, N W Johnson and P D Munro, "Application of fine grinding to improve galena flotation at the Mt Isa Mines lead/zinc concentrator," presented at: ''39th Annual AMIRA Technical Meeting, Adelaide, 11 September 1997''.&lt;/ref&gt; The lead–zinc ore also contained increasing amounts of fine-grained, carbonaceous [[pyrite]] (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name = "Young1997"/&gt; This material was naturally hydrophobic and floated without the aid of a collector into the lead concentrate, diluting it. The additional sulfur from the pyrite in the lead concentrate reduced the lead smelter's lead production because the ability to eliminate sulfur from the concentrate was lead smelter's capacity bottleneck.&lt;ref name = "Young1997"/&gt;

As part of the effort to try to fix the problems, MIM installed some column flotation cells in the zinc concentrate and bulk concentrate sections of the plant.&lt;ref name = "Young1997"/&gt; In those days, the air was introduced into flotation columns using air spargers, usually in the form of a bag or sheath around a pipe.&lt;ref name = "Lane"/&gt; The spargers were high-maintenance items, and their performance was critical to the operation of the column.&lt;ref name = "Lane"/&gt;

===Inception and early development (1985–1990)===

====Lead and zinc flotation====

In 1985, MIM commissioned Jameson to undertake a project to improve the sparger design for flotation columns.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"&gt;J A Cowburn, R Stone, S Bourke and B Hill, "Design developments of the Jameson Cell," in: ''Centenary of Flotation Symposium, Brisbane, Queensland, 6–9 June 2005'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2005), 193–199.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he developed the concept of using a jet in a downcomer to create the bubbles and eliminate the need for a sparger in conventional flotation columns.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt;
 
The concept of the Cell followed when further investigations showed that most of the bubble–particle interactions were occurring in the downcomer, rendering unnecessary the collection zone of flotation columns.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; The idea of the downcomer and short separation tank was developed and a provisional patent application was lodged in 1986.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; This patent was later assigned to TUNRA Limited ("TUNRA"),&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; the technology transfer company of the University of Newcastle that is now known as "Newcastle Innovation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bulksolids.com.au/about_us.html "TUNRA Bulk Solids – Who We Are."] Accessed 1 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newcastleinnovation.com.au/about-newcastle-innovation#.UampkPWQ8-U "About Newcastle Innovation."] Accessed 1 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A pilot two tonne per hour (t/h) Jameson Cell with a 100&amp;nbsp;mm downcomer and using an orifice plate to create the jet was tested in MIM's lead–zinc concentrator.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; Subsequently, in 1988, MIM tested the flotation of a stream of fine lead-bearing particles in a conventional mechanical flotation cell, a conventional column and the Jameson Cell.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; The Cell gave the best recoveries.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; This was thought to be a combination of the short residence time of the particles in the Cell and the fact that the [[hydrophobicity]] of the lead particles decreased over time.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt;

As a result of this work, in 1989 MIM ordered four full-scale Cells, two for the Mount Isa lead–zinc concentrator and another two for the new Hilton lead–zinc concentrator&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; to be built at the Hilton Mine, located about 20 kilometers north of Mount Isa.&lt;ref name = "Rohner"&gt;P Rohner, "Lead-zinc-silver ore concentration practice at the Hilton Concentrator of Mount Isa Mines Limited, Mount Isa, Qld," in: ''Australasian Mining and Metallurgy, The Sir Maurice Mawby Memorial Volume, Second Edition'', Eds. J T Woodcock and J K Hamilton (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1993), 504–507.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mount Isa cells had diameters of 1.9&amp;nbsp;m,&lt;ref name = "Munro1993"&gt;P D Munro, "Lead-zinc-silver ore concentration practice at the lead-zinc concentrator of Mount Isa Mines Limited, Mount Isa, Qld," in: ''Australasian Mining and Metallurgy, The Sir Maurice Mawby Memorial Volume, Second Edition'', Eds. J T Woodcock and J K Hamilton (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1993), 498–503.&lt;/ref&gt; with three downcomers each,&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; while those at Hilton were 1.3&amp;nbsp;m in diameter&lt;ref name = "Rohner"/&gt; and had two downcomers each.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt;

====Coal flotation====

In parallel with this work, the Cell was tested for the recovery of fine coal at the [[Newlands coal mine]], also owned by MIM Holdings Limited.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; This fines stream was [[Hydrocyclone|cyclone]] [[Hydrocyclone#Design|overflow]], which contained 15–50% ash and was previously discarded.&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt; The particle size of this stream was less than 25&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt; Pilot plant testing showed that it was possible to achieve greater than 90% recovery of coal, with less than 10% ash in the product.&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt;

Subsequently, a full-scale plant was commissioned at Newlands in the 1988–89 financial year, with six rectangular Cells (1.5&amp;nbsp;m × 3.5&amp;nbsp;m) installed in a two-stage arrangement.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; The cells in the first stage had seven downcomers, while those in the second had six.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt;
These cells were in continuous operation at Newlands for 15 years until a new washing plant was built to replace the old one in 2006.&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt;

Two additional Cells were installed at MIM Holdings' Collinsville Coal operations in 1990. These had 10 downcomers each.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt;

====Copper flotation====

Also in 1989, Peko Mines, then a division of [[North Broken Hill Peko Limited]], also engaged Jameson to undertake test work in its Warrego concentrator near [[Tennant Creek]] in Australia's [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991"/&gt; The objective was to determine the Jameson Cell's performance in [[Froth flotation#Cleaning|cleaning]] copper concentrate to improve its grade by removing gangue minerals, including pyrite, [[magnetite]], [[hematite]] and [[quartz]].&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991"/&gt; Peko Mines personnel also tested a conventional flotation column for comparison. Following the test work, Peko Mines installed two full-scale, 1.4&amp;nbsp;m diameter Jameson Cells in the concentrator, each with three downcomers.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991"/&gt;
 
Peko Mines' decision was based on:

* metallurgical performance during pilot plant test work
* lower capital expenditure and installation costs
* shorter construction and installation times
* ease of operation and lower expected maintenance costs.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991"/&gt;

Peko Mines reported a payback on the investment in the Cells of two months.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991"/&gt;

====Electrolyte cleaning in solvent extraction – electrowinning plants====

[[Solvent extraction]] – [[electrowinning]] (often referred to as "SX–EW") is a process frequently applied for recovering copper from low-grade and/or oxidised copper ore. It involves leaching the copper from the ore using an acidic solution, collecting the leach liquor containing the copper and contacting this solution with an organic extractant. The copper ions in the leach liquor transfer to the organic extractant, moving from a relatively low concentration to a higher concentration. The extractant is subsequently brought into contact with a second aqueous solution that is more acid than the original leach liquor, and the copper again moves, this time from the extractant into the aqueous solution. The result is an acidic solution of copper in which the copper concentration is high enough for it to be recovered by electrowinning. The solution destined for electrowinning is known as the [[electrolyte]].&lt;ref&gt;P Hayes, ''Process Principles in Minerals &amp; Materials Production'' (Hayes Publishing Company: Sherwood, Queensland, 1993), 227–314.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The electrolyte solution usually contains traces of the organic extractant that exist as tiny droplets within it.&lt;ref name = "Readett1993"&gt;D Readett, "Copper recovery by heap leaching, solvent extraction, and electrowinning at Mount Isa Mines Limited, Mount Isa, Qld," in: ''Australasian Mining and Metallurgy – The Sir Maurice Mawby Memorial Volume, 2nd Edition'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1993), 721–725.&lt;/ref&gt; These need to be removed before the copper can be recovered in the electrowinning process, as the presence of minimal amounts of the extractant can cause difficulties by stripping and damaging the cathodes with a subsequent loss of cathode copper quality.&lt;ref&gt;Xstrata Technology, [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/Downloads/Documents/brochure_en.pdf "Jameson Cell – Rising to the Challenge."]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, MIM built an SX–EW plant at Mount Isa to recover copper leached from low grade ore stockpiled while mining its [[Mount Isa Mines#From survival to prosperity (1946–1973)|Black Rock open cut]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name = "Readett1993"/&gt; In a world first, a Jameson Cell was used to clean the electrolyte solution by removing the remaining organic solvent.&lt;ref name = "Readett1993"/&gt; This replaced the sand filters traditionally used.&lt;ref name = "Readett"/&gt;

The cell was 3&amp;nbsp;m high, twice the height of the early Cells used in MIM's lead–zinc concentrators, as it was thought that additional residence time would enhance recovery.&lt;ref name = "Readett"/&gt; It used a single downcomer.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; The downcomer was used to contact the electrolyte with air and the droplets of the organic extractant attached themselves to the air bubbles created in the downcomer.&lt;ref name = "Readett1993"/&gt;

After some initial modifications to the orifice size, the Cell was able to remove 70–90% of the entrained organic extractant.&lt;ref name = "Readett"/&gt;

====Early spread of the technology====

In April 1989, MIM Holdings Limited acquired the world rights to the Jameson Cell from TUNRA, with TUNRA retaining the rights to use the Cell for waste water treatment.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt;

After the initial applications within the MIM Holdings group of companies, the years to 1994 saw Jameson Cells installed by various base and precious metals companies in Asia, South Africa, Canada and the United States, mainly in concentrate cleaning duties, but also in SX–EW electrolyte cleaning duties.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; The installation by Phelps Dodge (now [[Freeport-McMoRan]]) for electrolyte cleaning at its Morenci operation in Arizona was notable for having a large cell 6.5&amp;nbsp;m in diameter with 30 downcomers.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; The Morenci Jameson Cell consistently recovered over 82% of the organic extractant.&lt;ref name = "Readett"/&gt;

Toward the end of the period, Cells were installed in coal preparation plants operated by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance and by Peabody for fines recovery.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt;

====Early design developments====

Improvements to this early design included a focus on the weight and wear of the downcomer.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; The downcomer was originally built with [[polyurethane]]-lined steel, and then changed to a [[high-density polyethylene]] ("HDPE") construction with seven elements.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt;

The orifice plate used to generate the slurry jet was a high-wear item and its materials of construction were also a focus of the development effort.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; After testing high-chromium hardened steel and various ceramics, high-density alumina was found to have excellent wear properties, and it became the standard.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt;

===The Mark II Cell (1994–1999)===

====Mark II improvements====

The original Jameson Cell design had the following features:
* small (200&amp;nbsp;mm diameter) downcomers
* no wash water
* no tailings recycle
* no bubble dispersers
* low capacity.&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt;

In 1994 MIM launched the Mark II model Cell.&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt; It incorporated the following changes:
* the downcomer diameter was increased to 280&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt;
* wash-water trays were included for froth washing&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt;
* a tailings recycle system was added to maintain constant downcomer flow and higher recoveries&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt;
* conical bubble dispersers were added&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt;
* increased depth of tank from the bottom of the downcomer&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt;
* increased distance between the downcomers.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; 
[[File:Jameson Cell external recycle mechanism.png|thumbnail|Figure 5. Drawing of a Jameson Cell fitted with an external tailings recycle mechanism.]]

These changes resulted in a higher capacity design.&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt;

One of the problems encountered with the Mark I Cell was that its performance was reduced if the feed rate to the cell varied, which was a common occurrence arising from normal fluctuations in operating concentrators.&lt;ref name = "Young2013"/&gt; This problem was resolved by recycling some of the tailings to the cell feed via an external splitter box called an "External Recycle Mechanism" or "ERM" box separate to the flotation cell.&lt;ref name = "Young2013"/&gt; Thus, when the production of the feed stream to the Jameson Cell decreased as a result of a fluctuation elsewhere in the concentrator, a higher percentage of the tailings was automatically recycled to the downcomers, producing a constant flow rate, hence feed pressure, to the cell.&lt;ref name = "Young2013"/&gt; This had the added benefit of giving a proportion of the tailings (typically 40%) a second pass through the system, which resulted in higher recoveries.&lt;ref name = "Young2013"/&gt; In coal fines flotation, this allowed a single Cell to achieve the same recovery of combustibles as had previously been achieved in some two-stage Cell systems.&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt; 
 
Subsequently, an internal recycling system, referred to as the "internal recycle control" or "IRC" was developed. This was mainly used in integrated rectangular cells (see Figure 6), where the feed tank and tailings recycling system could easily be built in a single unit with the flotation cell. This system reduced the cell installation costs and made the cell more compact.&lt;ref name = "Young2013"/&gt;
[[File:Jameson Cell with internal tailings recycle mechanism.png|thumbnail|Figure 6. Drawing of a Jameson Cell designed with an internal tailings recycling system.]]
 
During this period, the orifice diameter was increased from the 28&amp;nbsp;mm design used in 1990 to 34&amp;nbsp;mm with the Mark II model and 38&amp;nbsp;mm in 1997.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; This, together with the larger Mark II downcomer diameter, allowed the slurry flow per downcomer to be doubled from 30&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/h in 1990 to 60&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/h in 1997.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt;

The increased distance between the downcomers reduced the interaction of aerated slurry discharging from adjacent downcomers.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; This interaction could reduce overall cell recovery by causing particles collected by bubbles in the downcomer to detach in the pulp tank.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt;

There was significant turbulence in the areas beneath the downcomers.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; that could result in particles detaching from bubbles.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; These turbulent areas were calmed by the addition of conical diffusers beneath each downcomer.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; They allowed uniform bubble rise velocities across the surface of the cell by slowing the superficial gas velocity in the high void-fraction area immediately around the downcomer and provided a more even bubble dispersion.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; It was reported that the diffusers reduced the turbulence by 69% compared with a standard downcomer with no diffuser.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt;

====New applications====

While the JamesonCell continued to expand in base metals concentrate cleaning, SX–EW electrolyte cleaning and coal fines recovery applications, it also found new applications in cleaning potash slimes&lt;ref name = "Burns"&gt;M J Burns, G Coates and L Barnard, "Use of Jameson Cell flotation technology at Cleveland Potash Ltd, North Yorkshire, England," ''Transactions of the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy (Section C: Mineral Processing and Extractive Metallurgy)'', May–August 1994, C162–C167.&lt;/ref&gt; and was adopted by the Philex Mining Corporation as the sole flotation machine for its Benguet copper concentrator.&lt;ref name = "Harbort1997"&gt;G J Harbort, A S Murphy and A Budod, "Jameson Cell developments at Philex Mining Corporation," in: ''AusIMM Sixth Mill Operators' Conference, Madang, Papua New Guinea, 6–8 October 1997'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1997), 105–113.&lt;/ref&gt; This is not the normal application for the Cell. No other metals concentrator operates solely using Jameson Cells.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt;

=====Potash flotation=====

Cleveland Potash Limited extracts and refines sylvinite ore from a deposit in North Yorkshire, England.&lt;ref name = "Burns"/&gt; Its processing plant uses froth flotation to produce a product rich in [[potassium chloride]] ("KCl").&lt;ref name = "Burns"/&gt; After a test work campaign in which it compared the performance of the Cell with  mechanical flotation cells in various duties in the flotation circuit, Cleveland Potash ordered a Cell with 6 downcomers for recovering potash slimes.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; The test work had shown a 4.8% increase in the recovery of potash slimes, equivalent at the time to an increase in revenue of approximately £518,000 per year.&lt;ref name = "Burns"/&gt;

=====Copper rougher flotation=====

In 1993 Philex Mining Corporation, a Philippines mining company, replaced the mechanical cleaner circuit with Cells at its Benguet copper concentrator.&lt;ref name = "Harbort1997"/&gt; Following their successful operation, Philex replaced the mechanical cells in its cleaner-scavenger circuit in 1994 and began the phased introduction of Cell rougher and scavenger lines that was completed in early 1996.&lt;ref name = "Harbort1997"/&gt; This was the first operation in which the external recycle mechanism system was applied.&lt;ref name = "Young2013"/&gt; By the time the last Jameson Cell was installed, the entire flotation circuit was composed of Jameson Cells.&lt;ref name = "Harbort1997"/&gt;

The motivation for installing Jameson Cells was, in part, to take advantage of their space-saving capabilities and to improve copper recovery at a minimum cost.&lt;ref name = "Harbort1997"/&gt; The Cell circuit occupied 60% less floor area and achieved equivalent results to the mechanical banks with 40% of their residence time.&lt;ref name = "Harbort1997"/&gt; They provided a power saving of 18%.&lt;ref name = "Harbort1997"/&gt;

In addition to these benefits, the use of the Jameson Cells in the rougher and rougher–scavenger section of the plant resulted in a 3.3% increase in copper recovery and a 4.5% increase in gold recovery.&lt;ref name = "Harbort1997"/&gt; When combined with the other Cells in the cleaner, recleaner and cleaner–scavenger section, there was a 2.6% increase in final copper concentrate grade and a 3.5% increase in plant copper recovery, with a 2.6% increase in plant gold recovery.&lt;ref name = "Harbort1997"/&gt;

===The Mark III Cell (2000–2008)===

====Mark III improvements====
[[File:Jameson Cell Mark IV slurry lens.png|thumbnail|Figure 7. The Jameson Cell Mark IV slurry lens.]]

The Mark III design encompassed the greatest improvement in the technology since its commercialisation. The focus was to make the technology more robust and easier to use in operations. The total redesign of the downcomer assembly allowed it to be isolated and unblocked much more easily compared to the Mark II design. The Mark III design also saw slurry flow per downcomer to be increased from 60&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/h to 75–85&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/h using larger orifice sizes in the slurry lenses.&lt;ref name = "LH"&gt;Personal communication, L Huynh, Jameson Cell Manager, Xstrata Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mark III Cell was introduced in 2000. It included the following improvements:
* a new slurry lens orifice design (see Figures 7 and 8)
* a new design downcomer and nozzle
* a new design flat plate bubble dispersers
* a stainless steel adjustable above and in-froth wash water system (see Figure 9)
* automated air and wash water flow control
* air-isolating slurry-eliminating valves ("AISE valves") 
* a bottom-fed new slurry distributor.&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt;
[[File:Photograph of Jameson Cell slurry lens.png|thumbnail|Figure 8. A Jameson Cell slurry lens being inserted into the top of a downcomer.]]

The earlier models of the Jameson Cell used [[orifice plate]]s to generate the downcomer jet.&lt;ref name = "Young2013"/&gt; The new slurry lens design had a smooth, shallow entry angle that created an optimum flow regime over the ceramic, reducing wear and extending its life.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; The shape resulted in a decrease in power consumption by the feed slurry pump by up to 10% and resulted in better jet formation that improved air entrainment.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt;
[[File:Jameson Cell coal froth washing.png|thumbnail|Figure 9. A stainless-steel wash water system fitted to a Jameson Cell being used for floating coal fines.]]
 
For coal applications, the wash water addition system was changed from a tray to stainless-steel circular rings attached to a manual lifting system.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; This allowed the flexibility of an easy transition from above-froth wash water addition to the in-froth addition that might be necessary for high concentrate-grade operations.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; For metals applications, new design wash water trays consisting of removable rubber mats for easy maintenance were used.&lt;ref name = "LH"/&gt; 
 
The AISE valves were developed to prevent solids being sucked back into the air lines when individual downcomers become blocked. Solids depositing in the air lines and their build up in the air distributor decreases flotation performance as it prevents air from being efficiently entrained in the downcomers.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt;

====New applications====

This period was one of rapid growth for the Jameson Cells in the existing applications.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; Seventy-seven  Cells were installed in concentrators around the world, mainly in coal and base metal operations.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; However, during this time, the Cell also moved into the Canadian [[oil sands]] industry for the flotation of bitumen.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt;

=====Bitumen flotation=====

Flotation is one of the unit processes used to separate the bituminous component of oil sands as part of the process of oil extraction.&lt;ref name = "Neiman"&gt;O Neiman, B Hilscher and R Siy,  [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/Downloads/technical%20papers/Secondary%20Recovery%20of%20Bitumen%20using%20Jameson%20Downcomers.pdf "Secondary recovery of bitumen using Jameson downcomers,"] in: ''Proceedings of the 44th Canadian Mineral Processors Operators Conference, Ottawa, Ontario, 17–19 January 2012'' (Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum), 115–124. Accessed 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the bitumen is not recovered in the primary separation vessel and reports to the tailings.&lt;ref name = "Neiman"/&gt; These tailings are typically retreated in a scavenging operation to try to recover some of the remaining bitumen.&lt;ref name = "Neiman"/&gt;

Three industrial-size single downcomer Jameson Cells were sold by Xstrata Technology to [[Shell Canada]] in 2007 for a large scale pilot plant project and eight 500&amp;nbsp;mm downcomers were sold to [[Syncrude|Syncrude Limited]] in 2008.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; In the latter case, the downcomers were used to treat middlings in an existing tertiary oil recovery vessel in a bitumen recovery process patented by Syncrude.&lt;ref name = "Neiman"/&gt;

===The Mark IV Cell (2009– )===

====Mark IV improvements====
[[File:Jameson Cell downcomer quick-release clamps.png|thumbnail|Figure 10. Photograph of the quick-release clamps used to attach the slurry line to the top of the Jameson Cell downcomer.]]

The Mark IV Cell design was introduced in 2009. It included the following improvements:
* a flexible hose for easier alignment of the downcomer
* clamping of the slurry lens onto the downcomer (see Figure 10)
* stainless steel quick-release clamps in the downcomer assembly
* long-lasting rubber flaps in the AISE valves.&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt;

==Current applications==

===Base and precious metals flotation===

In base and precious metals flotation, the Jameson Cell has established itself as being particularly useful in several applications in flotation circuits that also use other types of flotation cells, such as mechanical cells. These applications include:

* preflotation roughers for removing naturally hydrophobic gangue materials&lt;ref name = "XT"&gt;Xstrata Technology, [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/Downloads/Documents/brochure_en.pdf Jameson Cell brochure.]  Accessed 2 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; (such as carbon, talc and elemental sulfur), where the Jameson Cell minimises the entrainment of the valuable minerals while eliminating naturally floating gangue minerals that would otherwise contaminate the concentrate&lt;ref name = "Smith"&gt;T Smith, D Lin, B Lacouture and G Anderson, [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/Downloads/technical%20papers/Removal%20of%20Organic%20Carbon%20with%20a%20Jameson%20Cell%20at%20R.pdf "Removal of organic carbon with a Jameson Cell at Red Dog mine,"] in: ''Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting of the Canadian Mineral Processors, Ottawa, Ontario, 22–24 January 2008'' (Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum), 333–346.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Carr"&gt;D Carr, G Harbort and V Lawson, "Expansion of the Mount Isa Mines copper concentrator phase one cleaner circuit expansion," in: ''Eighth Mill Operators' Conference, Townsville, Queensland, 21–23 July 2003'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2003), 53–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pokrajcic"&gt;Z Pokrajcic, G J Harbort, V Lawson and L Reemeyer, "Applications of the Jameson Cell at the head of base metal flotation circuits," in: ''Centenary of Flotation Symposium, Brisbane, Queensland, 6–9 June 2005'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2005), 165–170.&lt;/ref&gt;
* rougher-scalper and roughing duties where selectivity and froth washing produce high-grade concentrate. In this application, the recovery in one Jameson Cell is normally equivalent to several mechanical cells, and where the feed contains fast-floating liberated particles, the Cell can produce final-grade product, thus reducing the number of mechanical cells required in a flotation circuit&lt;ref name = "XT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D Curry, M Cooper, J Rubenstein, T Shouldice and M Young, "The right tools in the right place: how Xstrata Nickel Australasia increased Ni throughput at its Cosmos plant," in: ''Proceedings of the 42nd Annual Meeting of the Canadian Mineral Processors, Ottawa, Ontario, 19–21 January 2010'' (Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum), 215–234.&lt;/ref&gt;
* cleaner-scalper duties, in which the Jameson Cell recovers fast floating minerals to produce a final-grade concentrate, thus reducing the load on the rest of the cleaning circuit and reducing its size.&lt;ref name = "Barns2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "XT"/&gt; In this application, it can also be used as a low-cost way of expanding the capacity of an existing cleaner circuit&lt;ref name = "Seaman"&gt;D R Seaman, F Burns, B Adamson, B A Seaman and P Manton, "Telfer processing plant upgrade – the implementation of additional cleaning capacity and the regrinding of copper and pyrite concentrates," in: ''11th Mill Operators' Conference 2012, Hobart, Tasmania, 29–31 October 2012'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2012), 373–381.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Bennett"&gt;D Bennett, I Crnkovic and P Walker, "Recent process developments at the Phu Kham copper–gold concentrator, Laos," in: ''Proceedings of the 11th Mill Operators' Conference, Hobart, Tasmania, 29–31 October 2012'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2012), 257–272.&lt;/ref&gt;
* final cleaning duties where mechanical cleaning circuits are unable to consistently produce final grade concentrate because of entrained gangue, the Jameson Cell with its enhanced selectivity and froth washing, is able to remove the gangue&lt;ref name = "XT"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Lauder"&gt;D W Lauder, M Mavotoi and J W Glatthaar, "Fluorine removal from OK Tedi copper/gold concentrates," in: ''Eighth Mill Operators' Conference, Townsville, Queensland, 21–23 July 2003'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2003), 203–209.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coal flotation===

The Jameson Cell has been found to be particularly effective in cleaning and recovering fine coal particles. For example, at BHP Coal's Goonyella mine (now part of the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance) eight Cells were installed to replace the entire 32 mechanical cell flotation circuit in 1995 in its 1800 t/h coal flotation plant.&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Carretta"/&gt; The result was an overall increase in yield for the plant of 3.5% (better than the predicted yield of 2.1% that was used to justify the project) and the production of a low-ash product.&lt;ref name = "Carretta"/&gt;

Since then, Jameson Cells have been installed in many coal preparation plants around the world,&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; with the largest installation at the [[Curragh coal mine]] in Australia, where 12 Cells treat over 5&amp;nbsp;million t/y of coal fines.&lt;ref name = "XT"/&gt;

The Cell can also be applied to coal preparation plant tailings to recover fine coal previously discarded.

===SX–EW plants===

The Jameson Cell is used to recover the organic solvent in solvent extraction – electrowinning plants from both the electrolyte and [[raffinate]] streams.&lt;ref name = "XT"/&gt;

Contamination of the electrolyte increases operating costs and reduces the quality of the copper product.&lt;ref name = "XT"/&gt;  Any solvent remaining in the raffinate stream represents a loss of solvent and hence an increase in operating costs.&lt;ref name = "XT"/&gt;

Major users of the Cell in SX–EW plants include Freeport McMoRan at its Morenci operations, BHP Billiton at its [[Olympic Dam mine|Olympic Dam]] operations and Grupo México at its Cananea and La Caridad operations.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; In all, Xstrata Technology reports 41 SX–EW applications.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt;

Recent developments in the Cell design for SX–EW applications include large, flat-bottomed cell design to allow it to sit on the ground and large (500&amp;nbsp;mm diameter) downcomers that can have multiple liquor (there being no slurry in SX–EW applications) lenses fitted to each downcomer.

The biggest operating Cell is at the Olympic Dam operations, treating 3000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/h of raffinate.&lt;ref name = "XT"/&gt;

===Potash===

The first potash application was in England in 1993, where Jameson Cells were used to treat potash slimes (see [[Jameson Cell#Potash flotation|Potash flotation]]).&lt;ref name = "Burns"/&gt; It has subsequently been applied at Israel Chemicals Limited's Dead Sea Works and by an unnamed producer in the Saskatchewan province of Canada.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt;

===Oil sands===
The Jameson Cell has been adopted by Shell Canada and Syncrude for floating bitumen in the oil sands industry (see [[Jameson Cell#Bitumen flotation|Bitumen flotation]]).&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; Syncrude bought an additional eight 500&amp;nbsp;mm downcomers for its plant in 2012.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt;

===Iron ore===

The Jameson Cell can be used for the reverse flotation of silica from iron ore, where flotation columns have traditionally been used.&lt;ref name = "LH"/&gt;

===Phosphate flotation===

Phosphate processing operations that use flotation as the principal mechanism to concentrate the phosphate-bearing minerals usually discard particles smaller than 20&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter.&lt;ref name = "Teague"/&gt; This is because the fine particles have had poor flotation performance and because their presence decreases the flotation performance of the coarse particles.&lt;ref name = "Teague"/&gt;

Legend International Holdings Incorporated ("Legend") owns major phosphate deposits that average 20–60% particles less than 20&amp;nbsp;µm that contain up to 50% of the phosphate.&lt;ref name = "Teague"/&gt; This makes the traditional phosphate concentration practice uneconomic for these deposits.&lt;ref name = "Teague"/&gt; In response, Legend developed a process based on using the Jameson Cell in a rougher-scavenger-cleaner configuration to recover at least 80% of the phosphate at a grade of at least 32% P&lt;sub&gt;2&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; from a feed with a particle size distribution of up to 80% less than 20&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref name = "Teague"/&gt;

==Advantages ==

The Jameson Cell reportedly has the following advantages:
* ''relatively low energy use'' – the only energy that is required to operate the Cell is to pump the slurry through the slurry lens. This means that it requires significantly less electricity than conventional mechanical or column flotation cells.&lt;ref name = "Young2013"/&gt; In addition, the better particle–bubble contact means that fewer Cells are required for the equivalent duty of mechanical cells, giving an even bigger power saving.&lt;ref name = "Harbort1997"/&gt; 
* ''high recovery of fines'' – The Cell is able to achieve final product specification from previously discarded coal fines at very high recoveries (95–98%) in a single pass.&lt;ref name = "Young2013"/&gt; It has also been shown to be effective in recovering fine particles in base metals, potash and phosphate applications.
* ''effective froth washing'' – The Cell uses froth washing as standard to control concentrate grade. A conventional flotation cell has problems with recovering fine particles at high grades due to the entrainment of gangue minerals in the froth.&lt;ref name = "Araya"/&gt; The high throughput of the Jameson Cell means that the froth is produced in a small surface area so it is economic to apply froth washing to all cells&lt;ref name = "Seaman"/&gt;
* ''easily scaled up'' – the hydrodynamic conditions for particle collection inside the downcomer and separation in the tank are identical between the laboratory, pilot plant and industrial-scale Jameson Cell, meaning that there is direct scale-up. This makes predicting plant performance for small-scale tests straightforward.&lt;ref&gt;Xstrata Technology, [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/JamesonCellAdvantages/Pages/AccurateDesignandScaleUp.aspx "Accurate design and scale-up."] Accessed 9 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, factors have to be used to scale-up the design of mechanical and column flotation cells.
* ''relatively small footprint'' – the high intensity of bubble-particle contact means that very low residence times are required in the Cell (residence time in the downcomer is 5–10 seconds&lt;ref name = "Atkinson"/&gt; and the separation tank volume is small compared with alternative technologies&lt;ref name = "Barns2009"/&gt;). This means that the total volume of the Cell is lower than the alternatives.
* ''fast response to process changes'' – process variables such as air flow rate, froth depth and wash water are all automated making optimisation straightforward.&lt;ref&gt;Xstrata Technology, [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/JamesonCellAdvantages/Pages/EasytoTune.aspx "Easy to tune – quick to respond."] Accessed 1 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The small tank volumes means very short residence times in the tank (typically 1–3 minutes) so changes made, whether they are deliberate or from normal plant fluctuations, are observed almost instantly. 
* ''rapid start-up and shutdown'' – the small volume of the tank means that the Cell can be filled and drained quickly so with plant upsets the Cell can reach steady state very quickly. 
* ''low maintenance costs'' – the  Cell has no moving parts and is designed to provide easy access to serviceable parts. The slurry lens orifice has a service life exceeding 5 years under normal operating conditions and the service life of the other wet-end wear parts is reported to be over 10 years under normal operating conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Xstrata Technology, [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/JamesonCellAdvantages/Pages/MinimalMaintenance.aspx "Minimal Maintenance – High Availability."] Accessed 7 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''low capital cost''&lt;ref name = "Carretta"/&gt; – the small footprint of the Cell reduces the amount of steel required in its construction and, coupled with the simplicity of its design, has lower installation costs when compared with conventional or column flotation cells. 
* ''low operating costs'' – the lack of moving parts with a consequent lower power consumption, long wear life and easy access results in low operating costs.
* ''short payback periods'' – Cell users typically report short payback periods for their investments in the technology. For example, the 2007 installation of a 5.4&amp;nbsp;m diameter Jameson Cell with 18 downcomers to treat preflotation concentrate recovered up to 90% of the zinc previously lost to the tailings disposal facility and had a payback of approximately one year at the zinc prices of the day.&lt;ref name = "Smith"/&gt; Peko Mines reported a payback period of two months for its Cell installation.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991"/&gt; The complete replacement of 32 mechanical cells with eight Jameson Cells at the Goonyella coal mine had a payback of 17 months.&lt;ref name = "Carretta"/&gt; More recently, the installation of a Cell ahead of each of two cleaner trains at the [[Telfer Mine]] had a payback of between two and seven months.&lt;ref name = "Seaman"/&gt;

'''John Boyd Dunlop''' (5 February 1840 – 23 October 1921) was a Scottish inventor and veterinary surgeon who spent most of his career in Ireland. Familiar with making [[Natural rubber|rubber]] devices, he re-invented [[Tire|pneumatic tyres]] for his child's [[tricycle]] and developed them for use in cycle racing.  He sold his rights to the pneumatic tyres to a company he formed with the president of the Irish Cyclists' Association, [[Harvey Du Cros]], for a small cash sum and a small shareholding in their pneumatic tyre business.  Dunlop withdrew in 1896.  The company that bore his name, [[Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company]], was not incorporated until later using the name well known to the public, but it was Du Cros's creation.

==Veterinary practice==
He was born on a farm in [[Dreghorn]], [[North Ayrshire]], and studied to be a [[veterinary surgeon]] at the [[Dick Vet]], [[University of Edinburgh]], a profession he pursued for nearly ten years at home, moving to [[Downpatrick|Downpatrick, Ireland]] in 1867. 

Quite early in his life he was told he had been a premature birth, two months before his mother had expected. He convinced himself his health was delicate and throughout his life acted accordingly, but he had no serious illness until he contracted a chill in October 1921 aged 81 and died unexpectedly.  Sir Arthur Du Cros described him as a diffident and gentle-mannered man but confident in his abilities.&lt;ref name=ADC&gt;Sir Arthur Du Cros, Bt, ''Wheels of Fortune, a salute to pioneers'', Chapman &amp;  Hall, London 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Margaret Stevenson in 1871 and they had a daughter and a son. He established Downe Veterinary Clinic in [[Downpatrick]] with his brother James Dunlop before moving to a practice in 38–42 May Street, Belfast where, by the mid 1880s, his was one of the largest practices in Ireland. 

Dunlop developed pneumatic tyres for his son's tricycle and soon had them made commercially in Scotland. A cyclist using his tyres began to win all races and drew the attention of Harvey Du Cros. Dunlop sold his rights into a new business with Du Cros for some cash and a small shareholding. With Du Cros he overcame many difficulties experienced by their business, including the loss of his patent rights. In 1892 he retired from his veterinary practice and moved to Dublin soon after [[Harvey Du Cros]] with his assistance successfully refloated Booth Bros of [[Dublin]] as the Pneumatic Tyre and Booth's Cycle Agency. The pneumatic tyre revolutionised the bicycle industry, which had boomed after the 1885 introduction of [[John Kemp Starley|J K Starley's]] [[safety bicycle]].&lt;ref&gt;B. W. Best, '''Dunlop, John Boyd (1840–1921)''', rev. Trevor I. Williams, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

J B Dunlop sold out in 1895 and took no further interest in the tyre or rubber business. His remaining business interest was a local drapery. 

==Pneumatic tyres==
[[File:Dunlop first pneumatic bicycle tyre.JPG|thumb|right|Dunlop's first pneumatic bicycle tyre [[National Museum of Scotland]]]]
[[File:John Boyd Dunlop (c1915).jpg|thumb|Dunlop on a bicycle c. 1915]]
In October 1887, John Boyd Dunlop developed the first practical [[pneumatic]] or inflatable tyre for his son's tricycle and, using his knowledge and experience with rubber, in the yard of his home in Belfast fitted it to a wooden disc 96 centimetres across.&lt;ref&gt;The Bicycle, UK, 21 July 1943, p3&lt;/ref&gt; The tyre was an inflated tube of sheet rubber. He then took his wheel and a metal wheel from his son's tricycle and rolled both across the yard together. The metal wheel stopped rolling but the pneumatic continued until it hit a gatepost and rebounded. Dunlop then put pneumatics on both rear wheels of the tricycle. That too rolled better, and Dunlop moved on to larger tyres for a bicycle "with even more startling results."&lt;ref&gt;The Bicycle, UK, 21 July 1943, p3&lt;/ref&gt; He tested that in Cherryvale sports ground, South Belfast, and a patent was granted on 7 December 1888. Unknown to Dunlop another Scot, [[Robert William Thomson]] from [[Stonehaven]], had patented a pneumatic tyre in 1847. 

[[Willie Hume]] demonstrated the supremacy of Dunlop's tyres in 1889, winning the tyre's first-ever races in Ireland and then England.&lt;ref name="Gold Hume"&gt;[http://www.thepedalclub.org/archives/goldenbook/u-z/WilliamHume.html The Golden Book of Cycling – William Hume, 1938. Archive maintained by 'The Pedal Club'.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403120845/http://www.thepedalclub.org/archives/goldenbook/u-z/WilliamHume.html |date=3 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunlop time"&gt;[http://www.dunlop.eu/dunlop_uk/what_sets_dunlop_apart/history/ Dunlop, What sets Dunlop apart, History, 1889]&lt;/ref&gt; The captain of the Belfast Cruisers Cycling Club, he became the first member of the public to purchase a bicycle fitted with pneumatic tyres, so Dunlop suggested he should use them in a race.  On 18 May 1889 Hume won all four cycling events at the [[Queen's University Belfast|Queen's College]] Sports in Belfast, and a short while later in Liverpool, won all but one of the cycling events.&lt;ref name="Dunlop time" /&gt; Among the losers were sons of the president of the Irish Cyclists' Association, [[Harvey Du Cros]]. Seeing an opportunity, Du Cros built a personal association with J B Dunlop, and together they set up a company which acquired his rights to his patent.

Two years after he was granted the patent, Dunlop was officially informed that it was invalid as Scottish inventor [[Robert William Thomson]] (1822–1873), had patented the idea in France in 1846 and in the US in 1847. (see [[Tyres]].)  To capitalise on pneumatic tyres for bicycles, Dunlop and Du Cros resuscitated a Dublin-listed company and renamed it Pneumatic Tyre and Booth's Cycle Agency. Dunlop retired in 1895. In 1896 Du Cros sold their whole bicycle tyre business to British financier [[Ernest Terah Hooley|Terah Hooley]] for £3 million. Hooley arranged some new window-dressing, titled board members, etc., and re-sold the company to the public for £5 million. Du Cros remained head of the business until his death. Early in the 20th century it was renamed [[Dunlop Rubber]].

Though he did not participate after 1895, Dunlop's pneumatic tyre did arrive at a crucial time in the development of [[road transport]]. His commercial production of cycle tyres began in late 1890 in Belfast, but the production of car tyres did not begin until 1900, well after his retirement. J B Dunlop did not make any great fortune by his invention.

==Death and legacy==
[[File:DunlopLogo.png|thumb|The Dunlop logo is widely recognised around the world]]
John Boyd Dunlop died at his home in Dublin's [[Ballsbridge|Ball's Bridge]] in 1921 and is buried in [[Deans Grange Cemetery]].

Although the Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company no longer exists as a corporate entity, the Dunlop name lives on in a number of [[Dunlop (brands)|Dunlop-branded products]], including automotive, aerospatial, industrial and sporting products around the world. The Dunlop brand commonly appears as a [[Corporate sponsorship|corporate sponsor]] of international sporting events such as [[motor racing]] and [[tennis]] matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wood|first1=Zoe|title=Sports Direct sells Dunlop for $137m|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/27/sports-direct-sells-dunlop-for-137m|accessdate=4 April 2018|work=the Guardian|date=27 December 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404121724/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/27/sports-direct-sells-dunlop-for-137m|archivedate=4 April 2018|language=en|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1980s, Dunlop was commemorated in [[Northern Ireland]] when his image featured on the  [[Danske Bank £10 note|£10 banknote]] issued by the [[Northern Bank#Banknotes|Northern Bank]] as part of its Inventor Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pam West British Notes - 1988Torrens - SPECIMEN - 1988 - B - 7 digits - J B Dunlop obverse.

In 2005, Dunlop was inducted into the [[Automotive Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name="Automotive Hall of Fame"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Dunlop|url=http://www.automotivehalloffame.org/honoree/john-dunlop/|website=Automotive Hall of Fame|accessdate=4 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404120444/http://www.automotivehalloffame.org/honoree/john-dunlop/|archivedate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An avenue in the city of [[Campinas]], in southeast [[Brazil]], is also named after him; that is because a Dunlop tyre factory was established there in 1953.

'''Jonathan Brewster Bingham''' (April 24, 1914 – July 3, 1986) was an [[United States|American]] politician and diplomat. He was the US delegate to the United Nations General Assemblies and was elected to Congress.

==Early life==
Bingham was born in New Haven, Connecticut. His father, [[Hiram Bingham III]], was a [[United States Senator|Senator]] and explorer and his great grandfather, [[Hiram Bingham I]], was a missionary, who helped translate the [[Bible]] into [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]].

Bingham attended [[Hamden Hall Country Day School]] and [[Groton School]] and graduated from [[Yale University]] in 1936 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] and from [[Yale Law School]] in 1939 with a law degree. He was a member of [[Skull and Bones]], class of 1936.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandra Robbins]], ''Secrets of the Tomb: Skull and Bones, the Ivy League, and the Hidden Paths of Power'', Little, Brown and Company, 2002, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 he was admitted to the bar, and began the practice of law in [[New York City]]. His practice was interrupted in August 1941, when he joined the Machinery Branch of the newly created Office of Price Administration (OPA) as a legal advisor. He was not at the OPA for long, for in 1942 he joined the Military Intelligence Service. In April of the following year he was enlisted as a private in the [[United States Army]] and was discharged a captain in October 1945 with a [[United States War Department|War Department]] citation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jonathan Brewster Bingham|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=B000472|publisher=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomat==
On his return he was appointed chief of the newly created Alien Enemy Control Section of the [[United States Department of State|State Department]]. The Alien Enemy Control Section was unpopular and short-lived. Bingham got off the boat before it sank, resuming the practice of law in [[New York City]] in 1946.

He left the practice of law again in 1951 to become assistant director of the Office of International Security Affairs. Bingham left in the same year to become deputy administrator of the Technical Cooperation Administration, implementing the Point 4 Program of technical assistance to developing countries.  His book, ''Shirt-Sleeve Diplomacy: Point 4 in Action,'' was published in 1953.  He left the administration in that year and resumed the practice of law. In 1955 he became secretary to fellow Bonesman, [[W. Averell Harriman]], while he was [[Governor of New York]]. When Harriman was defeated in the 1958 election by [[Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller]], Bingham joined the law firm Goldwater &amp; Flynn.

In 1961 Bingham entered the world of [[diplomacy]], as a United States representative on the [[United Nations Trusteeship Council]] with rank of Minister in 1961 and 1962, serving as President in 1962. During this period he was also principal adviser to the U.S. ambassador to U.N. on colonial and trusteeship questions. From 1963 to 1964 he was a United States representative on the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] with rank of Ambassador. He was also alternate representative to the 15th and 18th [[United Nations General Assembly|United Nations General Assemblies]].

==Congress==
In 1964 he was elected to the House of Representatives from the 23rd District of [[New York (state)|New York]], a district in the Bronx, at a time when elections in the Bronx were decided in the Democratic primaries in contests between "regular" or machine Democrats, and "reform" or challenger Democrats. Bingham defeated Charles Buckley, the leader of the Bronx "regular" Democrats and a powerful, senior committee chairman in Congress, in a re-match following Bingham's defeat in his first try against the incumbent Buckley in the 1962 Democratic primary.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Bingham represented the 23rd District from January 3, 1965 until January 3, 1973, when, as a result of redistricting following the 1970 census, he was elected to the House from the 22nd District of New York following a bruising primary with neighboring Democratic incumbent congressman [[James H. Scheuer]]. He served the 22nd District from January 3, 1973 until January 3, 1983,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jonathan Brewster Bingham|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/jonathan_bingham/401453|publisher=Govtrack US Congress|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not pursue re-election when, in 1982, his district essentially disappeared as a result of yet another post-census redistricting. While in the House, Bingham served on the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee and chaired the Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade. He was particularly dedicated to nuclear non-proliferation and environmental protection.

On leaving congress he took up the practice of law as special counsel with Pryor, Cashman, Sherman &amp; Flynn. He also lectured at Columbia University School of Law. During his lifetime Bingham contributed articles to various publications. He also authored Shirt Sleeve Diplomacy-Point 4 in Action (1954) and Violence and Democracy (1970). {{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Affiliations==
He was a fellow of the Yale Corporation from 1949 to 1951, and served on its executive committee from 1951 to 1953. Bingham served on the board of directors of the People for the American Way, the United Nations Development Corporation, U.S. Committee for UNICEF and the Population Crisis Committee. He was a member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] and the [[Century Association]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Family==
He was married to [[June Bingham Birge|June Rossbach]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jonathan Brewster Bingham|url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/bingham.html|publisher=The Political Graveyard|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (June 20, 1919 – August 21, 2007), an author' playwright,&lt;ref name=NYTObitBingham&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/29/nyregion/29birge.html?ex=1346040000&amp;en=a59ff4c2f207a44b&amp;ei=5088&amp;pa...

[[File:Sousedík.jpg|thumbnail|right|Josef Sousedík]]
'''Josef Sousedík''' (18 December 1894 – 15 December 1944) was [[Czech people|Czech]] inventor, industrialist and resistance fighter.&lt;ref name="vsetin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mestovsetin.cz/EN/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=100315&amp;id=1002&amp;p1=1001&amp;vol_stavzobrazeni=2 |title=Important personalities in Vsetín history |publisher=Vsetín official city website |author= |date=January 8, 2007 |accessdate=September 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Josef Sousedík grew up in a poor family in [[Vsetín]] in [[Czechoslovakia]]. After finishing elementary school he trained as an electrician. He fought in the [[Austria-Hungary]] army during [[World War I]] and participated in the [[Battle of Slovakia]] in 1918. He opened his own workshop in 1919,&lt;ref name="vsetin"/&gt; using his patents and inventions. The workshop expanded into a factory employing over 200 people by 1934.&lt;ref name="vsetin"/&gt; The factory went bankrupt in 1934 during the [[Great Depression]] and was bought by [[Tatra (company)|Ringhoffer-Tatra]], which employed Sousedík as a CEO.

He was twice elected mayor of [[Vsetín]] from 1927–1938.&lt;ref name="vsetin"/&gt;

Sousedík was an anti-Nazi resistance leader during [[World War II]], collaborating with the [[Clay Eva]] group and the [[1st Czechoslovak Partisan Brigade of Jan Žižka]]. He was arrested in 1944 and shot dead after a fight during an interrogation.&lt;ref name="vsetin"/&gt; Sousedík was decorated with the [[Czechoslovak War Cross 1939–1945|Czechoslovak War Cross]] ({{lang-cs|Válečný kříž}}) in memoriam by Czechoslovak president [[Edvard Beneš]].

The [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948–89)|Communist dictatorship]] suppressed recognition of Sousedík's acts due to his collaboration with Western states and factory ownership.&lt;ref name="vsetin"/&gt;

==Inventions and products==

Sousedík owned over 50 patents, mostly in the electrical field, such as an electrical rudder. His factory produced electrical parts for the [[ČSD Class M 290.0]] and for the [[Tatra T86]].

==Cameras==
===RED ONE===
[[File:Redonecamera.JPG|thumb|The RED ONE in a simple setup]]

The RED ONE was RED Digital Cinema’s first production camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digital-intermediate.co.uk/examples/redcamera/redcamera.htm|title=The RED Digital Camera Company|work=digital-intermediate.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using an S35mm image plane, the RED ONE displays a natural depth of field from 2K to over 4K resolutions.&lt;ref name="red.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.red.com/products/red-one|title=RED ONE|work=red.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first RED ONEs were outfitted with the 12 megapixel MYSTERIUM sensor, capable of capturing up to 120 frames per second at 2K resolution and 30 frames per second at 4K resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simdigital.com/rental_product.aspx?pid=333|title=RENTALS|work=simdigital.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only possible acquisition format is REDCODE RAW.
The cameras were initially sold with a CF card slot that later could be replaced with a REDMAG module.
The second generation, RED ONE MYSTERIUM-X has a 14 megapixel MYSTERIUM-X sensor. It captures up to 120 frames per second at 2K resolution and up to 30 frames per second at 4K resolution.  With the upgraded sensor, the RED ONE MYSTERIUM-X offers more dynamic range, higher sensitivity and enhanced color management tools than the RED ONE MYSTERIUM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.red.com/products/red-one#features|title=RED ONE|work=red.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DSMC2===
DSMC2 cameras are modular and can not be customised in various configurations. Several lens mounts can be attached to the camera. Differences to the former DSMC line are reduced size and weight, cable-less connections, as well as the addition of [[Apple ProRes|Apple ProRes]] and [[Avid DNx|Avid DNx]].

==REDCODE==
REDCODE RAW (.R3D) is a proprietary file format that employs wavelet compression to reduce the RAW data coming off the sensor. This allows reduced file sizes while still keeping all advantages of a non-destructive RAW workflow.
In the beginning REDCODE was a JPEG2000 12bit linear file stream with PCM sound without encryption. Several third party applications were able to read and convert to other file format such as Cineform RAW. Redcode started as having two different options, named Redcode 28 and Redcode 36, later a 42 option was added.
With the introduction of the DSMC line compression ratios were introduced, making

==RCP Development Kit==
Announced at NAB 2013 and launched in 2014, The RCP Development Kit is a SDK (software development kit) that allows programmers to create custom applications to control their camera via mobile device, computer, or micro-controller. The kit included the RCP Bridge, a wireless module that allows apps to communicate with the camera. The bridge supports a wireless communication range of approximately 50 feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/04/07/red-wireless-control/|title=Red adds wireless camera control module, software development kit|author=Zach Honig|publisher=AOL|work=Engadget}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workflow==

=== REDCINE-X PRO ===
REDCINE-X PRO is a free-of-charge post-processing software collection developed by RED, built specifically for RED camera systems. It includes a coloring toolset, integrated timeline, and post effects software collection for both stills and motion. The post-production software allows for non-destructive manipulation of raw .R3D files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.red.com/products/redcine-x|title=REDCINE-X PRO|work=red.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;REDCINE-X was the first workflow software developed solely by Red.  Like REDCINE, RED offered it as an end-to-end workflow solution for Red customers. It preceded the current REDCINE-X PRO.

With REDCINE-X PRO, users can mark frames while shooting and access those specific frames within their timeline. Additionally, there are features like A.D.D. (Advanced DRAGON [[Bayer_filter|Debayer]]), a new algorithm for Dragon that analyzes every pixel, plus grading and RAW adjustment options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nofilmschool.com/2014/02/red-epic-dragon-camera-a-d-d-advanced-debayer-upgrade-few-months/|title=RED DRAGON Camera is Getting A.D.D. &amp; General Upgrades May Start in the Next Few Months|work=No Film School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Previous Workflow Software====

"RED Alert!" was the first form of workflow made available to RED owners/operators, though it was more of a diagnostic tool. It allowed RED ONE users to tweak [[Bayer_filter|debayer]] settings and render out to dpx/tiff/mov.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalfilms.wordpress.com/2009/03/28/red-post-–-the-easy-way/&lt;/ref&gt;

REDCINE was the first end-to-end workflow for RED users. A third-party company developed the software, and RED provided the [[Software Development Kit|SDK]].

===Hardware accelerators===
====RED ROCKET====

Red Rocket is an internal PCI Express card that is capable of 4K, 2K, or 1080p real-time [[debayering]] and video playback of R3D files coming from Mysterium and Mysterium-X sensors. It can be used to accelerate video editing in compatible Non-linear editing systems, outputting the image via HD-SDI to a user-supplied monitor. A component of the Red Rocket allows users to convert the HD-SDI signal to four HDMI outputs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.red.com/products/red-rocket|title=RED ROCKET®|work=red.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====RED ROCKET-X====

RED ROCKET-X is an internal PCI Express card optimized for the 6K RED DRAGON sensor and is designed to accelerate the processing of R3D workflow, regardless of resolution. Compared to RED ROCKET, RED ROCKET-X processes and transcodes files up to five times faster.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Debayering subpar asset.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}

===Third party workflow systems===

RED offers the RED Apple Workflow Installer, which allows R3D RAW settings within Final Cut Pro X. Other applications include support for QuickTime to use .R3D files, and plugins for Adobe Photoshop,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.red.com/downloads/508ebcee17ef022b21000558&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe Premiere Pro, Avid Media Composer, Final Cut Pro X, and Sony Vegas Pro.

==Notable accessories==
===3-Axis lens control system===
The RED 3-Axis lens control system is a turn-key wireless lens control kit for driving focus, iris and zoom. Included is the T.H.C. (Tactical Hand Controller), a wireless remote that allows the operator to adjust lens settings from a distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.red.com/learn/product-demos/red-3-axis-lens-control-system|title=RED 3-AXIS LENS CONTROL SYSTEM|work=red.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Manuel Francisco Ayau Cordón''' (December 27, 1925 – August 4, 2010) was the Founder of the [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]] in Guatemala, a [http://www.newmedia.ufm.edu/gsm/index.php?title=Interview_with_Rose_and_Milton_Friedman leading] private University in Latin America. He was born in [[Guatemala City]], on December 27, 1925. After diverse studies, he obtained a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from [[Louisiana State University]] in 1950, an L.H.D. from [[Hillsdale College]] in 1973, and an honorary degree in law ([[Legum Doctor]]) from [[Northwood University]] in 1994.

==Scholarly and Laboral Contributions==
His many entrepreneurial activities include that of CEO of "Samboro, S.A.",  a company dedicated to the production of ceramic tiles; and of directing a group of [[Guatemala]]n industrialists for over forty years in the production of industrial gases and hydro-electric energy.  Dr. Ayau has also served on the board of directors of several different companies, including [[IBM]] in Latin America and the Guatemalan local stock and debt exchange, of which he was founding President.

In 1959 he also founded the [http://www.cees.org.gt Center for Economic and Social Studies] (CEES) in Guatemala, to analyze the fundaments and philosophy of free society.  In 1972 he was instrumental in founding the [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín|Francisco Marroquín University]], of which he was the first President until 1988.

A member of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]] since 1964, he was its President from 1978 to 1980.  He was on the board of directors of the [[Liberty Fund]] in [[Indianapolis]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.libertyfund.org&lt;/ref&gt; and he was also a trustee of the [[Foundation for Economic Education]] in New York. He was also a member of the [[Philadelphia Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phillysoc.org/DistinguishedMembers.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118151439/http://phillysoc.org/DistinguishedMembers.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Guatemala,  Dr. Ayau entered politics as a member of congress from 1970 to 1974, and as presidential candidate in the 1990 elections.

Twice he has formed part of the Central Bank council and has been president of two different commercial banks, Vice-President of the National Electrification Institute (INDE), trustee of the Philadelphia Society, and Honorary Member of the engineering society "[[Tau Beta Pi]]".

He was a [[Gazprom]] executive&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_20071103/ai_n21086344/ Putin's game in European energy: divide and conquer] Spectator, The, Nov 3, 2007 by Barnett, Neil&lt;/ref&gt; and also the former head of [[Panrusgaz]] and Általános Értékforgalmi Bank. He is the 1,468th on the [[Forbes]] world's billionaires list.&lt;ref name= "Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/megdet-rahimkulov/|title=Forbes Profile|author=|date=|website=Forbes|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the wealthiest person in Hungary and a leading owner of [[OTP Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://444.hu/2013/07/19/csanyi-elmenekult-az-otp-bol/ Csányi elmenekült az OTP-ből, 444.hu (Hungarian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

His assets are now managed by a holding company in Cyprus.&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt;

==Early life==

Rahimkulov received his first higher education at the All-Union Correspondence Financial and Economic Institute. He graduated in 1973. In 1978, Rahimkulov earned a second diploma from the State University of Management in Moscow.

In 1971, Rahimkulov, still a student, took a job at the USSR Ministry of the Gas Industry.&lt;ref name="finparty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finparty.ru/personal/megdet-rakhimkulov/|title=БИОГРАФИЯ — МЕГДЕТ РАХИМКУЛОВ|author=|date=|website=FinParty|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

After graduating from State University of Management, Rahimkulov became deputy head of Soyuzgazavtomatiki, a Mingazprom enterprise. From 1989 to 1992, he was the general director of Gazexport. In 1992, Rahimkulov was appointed General Director of OOO Interpromkom (InterProm), a company that supplied IT equipment to Gazprom.&lt;ref name="finparty"/&gt;

Rahimkulov became a Chief Executive and 10% owner of a Gazprom and MOL joint venture in the mid 1990s. MOL is a Hungarian multinational oil and gas company. When Gazprom acquired AEB, a Hungarian bank, Rahimkulov maintained a 6% direct holding in the bank until 2011.&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt; Rahimkulov and his sons, Ruslan and Timur, sold their entire share of MOL to VCP Capital Partners Unternehmensberatung AG in September of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portfolio.hu/en/tool/print/1/12210|title=Rahimkulov family parts with entire holding in Hungarian MOL|author=|date=|website=Portfolio.hu|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rahimkulov bought shares in OTP, a leading Hungarian bank, with the proceeds from the MOL sale.&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt; As of September 2017, he and his sons own 24,186,511 shares in OTP, giving them 8.64% ownership of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.otpbank.hu/portal/en/IR/Shares/OwnershipStructure|title=Ownership structure|author=|date=|website=OTP Bank|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Richard Michael Hill''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|KNZM}} (born 23 December 1938) is a New Zealand [[Jewellery|jeweller]], entrepreneur and philanthropist who founded global jewellery retailer [[Michael Hill Jeweller]] in 1979. He retired as the company's chairman in November 2015. He currently resides in [[Arrowtown]] and was [[Ernst &amp; Young]]'s 2008 Entrepreneur of the Year in New Zealand.

== Early life and career ==
Born in [[Whangarei]] on 23 December 1938, Hill was educated at [[Whangarei Boys' High School]] from 1949 to 1954.&lt;ref name="Whos who"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Taylor |editor-first=Alister |title=New Zealand Who's Who Aotearoa 2001 |year=2001 |publisher=Alister Taylor Publishers |location=Auckland |issn=1172-9813}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill recalls being bullied, stating that he "hated” his time at school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/news/4658119/Daisies-from-Michael-Hill-romantic|title=Daisies from Michael Hill - romantic|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left school at 16 to pursue a career as a concert violinist but a year later was told he would have had to start much younger in life to be a noteworthy musician.&lt;ref name=hello&gt;{{Cite book

He performed well as a salesman and window dresser, winning international awards for his efforts in the latter.&lt;ref name=toughenup&gt;{{Cite book

In the spring of 1964, while working in the store, Hill met Christine Roe, an Englishwoman who taught art at a local high school. They married in March 1965 and had two children, Mark (born 1969) and Emma (born 1971).&lt;ref name="Whos who"/&gt;

On 1 October 1977, the house that had taken them four years to build was destroyed in a fire.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

{{see also|Michael Hill Jeweller}}

Following this setback, Hill re-assessed his life. With the help of a friend, he tried to buy his uncle's business, but the uncle refused to sell. On 13 May 1979, Hill opened his own jewellery store nearby, calling it [[Michael Hill Jeweller]].&lt;ref name=hello/&gt; One of his main points of difference was to limit his store's product range to jewellery items, dispensing with silverware, clocks, porcelain and glassware commonly found in other jewellery stores at the time.&lt;ref name=hello/&gt;

Hill had set himself a goal of "seven stores in seven years",&lt;ref name=hello/&gt; and in 1986 he exceeded that, opening his eighth store in [[Newmarket, New Zealand|Newmarket]]. On 9 June 1987, Hill floated Michael Hill Jeweller on the [[New Zealand Exchange|New Zealand Stock Exchange]], raising enough capital to expand the business locally and into the Australian market, where the company opened four stores in [[Brisbane]] later that year. In 1988, Hill set himself and his company another goal: "70 shops in seven years". This goal was also achieved.&lt;ref name=toughenup/&gt; In 2002, the goal of opening 1000 stores by 2022 was established by Hill, with the further aim of taking the brand global.&lt;ref name=toughenup/&gt; During that same year, the company opened its first three stores in Canada,&lt;ref name=toughenup/&gt; and by the end of 2009 the company had 242 stores in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Hill's daughter, Emma Hill, succeeded him as chairman after the November 2015 [[annual general meeting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Harris |first1=Catherine |title=Following in dad's footsteps |work=[[The Press]] |date=15 August 2015 |page=C15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philanthropy ===

Although he didn't become a concert violinist, Hill has maintained a strong love for the violin his entire life and continues to play. In 2001 he founded the biennial Michael Hill International Violin Competition "for emerging young violinists".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

=== The Hills golf course ===
[[File:Wolves are coming4.JPG|thumb|''The Wolves are Coming''—when installed at [[798 Art Zone]]]]
After buying a run-down farm in Arrowtown, Hill's interest in golf grew to the point where he built his own 18-hole golf course called The Hills on the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.remarkablegolftours.co.nz/the-hills-golf.php |title=The Hills Golf Course |date= |website= |publisher=Remarkable Golf Tours |accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Built into the course is a unique two-thirds underground clubhouse designed by [[Auckland]] architect [[Andrew Patterson (architect)|Andrew Patterson]] and his company, Patterson Associates. The clubhouse won the [[New Zealand Institute of Architects]] Supreme Architectural Award in 2008 and was a finalist in the [[World Architecture Festival]] in 2008 in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref name=thecut&gt;{{Citation

The course is notable for the sculpture which makes much of the course into an open-air gallery. Giant sculptures dot the course, many of them the work of Hill's son, sculptor Mark Hill.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.odt.co.nz/sport/golf/203105/pga-provides-chance-view-sculpture-private-course PGA provides chance to view sculpture on private course]," J. Beech, ''Otago Daily Times, 28 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; These works complement Michael Hill's own impressive collection of art.

Hill had ''The Wolves are Coming'' by Chinese sculptor Liu Ruo Wang installed. Originally on display at [[798 Art Zone]] in Beijing, the 110 larger-than-life wolf figurines were placed at the golf course in October 2012 on a site chosen by the artist, and not at the site prepared by Hill's staff. At the centre of the installation is a sword-wielding warrior; this piece alone weighs {{convert|3|tonne}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chandler |first=Philip |title=Sir Michael's stunning new sculptures |url=http://www.scene.co.nz/sir-michaels-stunning-new-sculptures/304094a1.page |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220000442/http://www.scene.co.nz/sir-michaels-stunning-new-sculptures/304094a1.page |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 December 2012 |accessdate=28 October 2012 |newspaper=Mountain Scene |date=18 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Edens|first=John|title=These wolves are teed off |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/news/7834034/These-wolves-are-teed-off |accessdate=28 October 2012|newspaper=The Southland Times|date=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Fashion designer===
In 2004, Hilton launched her own clothing line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kidzworld.com/article/6178-celebrity-fashion-lines-nicky-hilton |title=Celebrity Fashion Lines - Nicky Hilton|publisher=Kidzworld.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also designed a line of handbags for Japanese company Samantha Thavasa.&lt;ref name=youtube/&gt; In 2007, she started her second line, Nicholai, at a higher price point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-207_162-3929213.html "Paris Hilton's Sis Shows Her Sexy Side"]. CBS. February 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholai held its fashion show for the spring/summer 2008 season on September 9, 2007, in New York City during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week. In 2014, Hilton launched a 10-piece collection with eLuxe. She designed each piece as a reflection of her personal style and named all products for the women in her family, who embody the style of each piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wwd.com/markets-news/ready-to-wear-sportswear/hilton-to-roll-out-eluxe-line-7934160 |title=Nicky Hilton to Roll Out eLuxe Line |work=Women's Wear Daily |date=2014-09-22 |accessdate=2014-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924140432/http://www.wwd.com/markets-news/ready-to-wear-sportswear/hilton-to-roll-out-eluxe-line-7934160 |archivedate=September 24, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Hilton launched a line of jewelry. The pieces are fashion jewelry and in an Art Deco style, averaging around $200 per piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Accessories News: Nicky Hilton to Launch Jewelry Line|url = http://www.elle.com/fashion/accessories/news/a4560/accessories-news-nicky-hilton-to-launch-jewelry-line-192/|website = ELLE|date = 2010-08-16|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, she launched a capsule collection of handbags as part of a collaboration with Linea Pelle. Hilton said she was approached by Linea Pelle "to make a capsule collection and I really wanted to have it be classic. As in I didn't want to make these super trendy bags that would be out of style next season."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nicky Hilton Debuts Fall 2015 Capsule Collection with Linea Pelle: Designer Talks Handbags, Wedding Plans and More in EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW|url = http://www.fashiontimes.com/articles/18900/20150226/nicky-hilton-fall-2015-collection-linea-pelle-handbags-wedding-exclusive-interview.htm|website = Fashion Times|date = 2015-02-26|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, Hilton announced her collaboration with Tolani for a Mommy and Me capsule collection. The collection launched in stores in spring 2018. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pregnant Nicky Hilton Rothschild Announces New 'Mommy + Me' Clothing Line with Tolani|url = http://people.com/babies/nicky-hilton-rothschild-mommy-and-me-collection-tolani/|website = People|date = 2017-08-14|accessdate = 2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Model===
In 2005, Hilton was the face of Australian underwear line Antz Pantz alongside [[Kimberly Stewart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antzpantz.com.au/Our-Products/Holeproof-Antz-Pantz.asp |title=Holeproof Antz Pantz|publisher=Antz Pantz |date=2005-11-27 |accessdate=2012-01-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051127005657/http://www.antzpantz.com.au/Our-Products/Holeproof-Antz-Pantz.asp |archivedate=2005-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.life.com/celebrity-pictures/55814692/antz-pantz-it-girl-search |title=Nicky Hilton, Kimberly Stewart, Nathan Sapsford - Antz Pantz IT Girl Search - Photo |website=Life |date=2005-09-28 |accessdate=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart remains contracted, but Hilton has been replaced by Australian model Megan Maitland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antzpantz.com.au/Our-Products/Holeproof-Antz-Pantz.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619071510/http://www.antzpantz.com.au/Our-Products/Holeproof-Antz-Pantz.asp|archivedate=2006-06-19 |title=Holeproof Antz Pantz|publisher=Antz Pantz|date=2006-06-19 |accessdate=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, Hilton modeled for the cover of ''[[Lucire]]'' for its New Zealand and [[Romania]]n editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brad Batory |url=http://lucire.com/2005a/0906fe0.shtml |title=Lucire Fashion: Making of a heiress: Lucire's cover girl, Nicky Hilton, as produced by Brad Batory of Indashio - The global fashion magazine |publisher=Lucire.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other ventures===
[[File:Nicky Hilton Sepia.jpg|thumb|Hilton in September 2010]]
In 2006, she entered a partnership to open two Nicky O Hotels, the first in [[Miami]] and the second in [[Chicago]]. That same year, Hilton sued her partner in Federal Court in Los Angeles for damages and to seek an injunction against his use of the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nicky Hilton Sues Over Hotel|url = http://www.contactmusic.com/nicky-hilton/news/nicky-hilton-sues-over-hotel_1013752|website = Contactmusic.com|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 12, 2007, Hilton was sued for breach of contract by her partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotel-online.com/News/PR2007_1st/Feb07_FalorNicky.html |title=Hotel Developer Robert Falor Suing Nicky Hilton; Alleges Breach of Contract and Deceptive Business Practices / February 2007 |publisher=Hotel-online.com |date=2007-02-13 |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Hilton published her first book, ''365 Style.'' According to the author, the book "offers a simple method that helps girls identify the staple pieces that work best for their lifestyle, encourages them to stay true to their own tastes, and most importantly shows them how to have fun with fashion every day of the year."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = An exclusive glimpse of Nicky Hilton's new 365 Style book cover|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2649683/NO-money-buy-style-An-exclusive-glimpse-Nicky-Hiltons-new-book-cover-shares-fail-proof-3-6-5-approach-dressing.html|website = Mail Online|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''365 Style'' was published by [[Harlequin Enterprises|Harlequin]], a subsidiary of [[HarperCollins]].

In 2015, Hilton collaborated with Smashbox, the cosmetic brand owned by [[Estée Lauder Companies]], to create a cosmetic line consisting of three limited-edition cat-inspired makeup kits (one for each of her favorite cities: New York City, Los Angeles and London).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nicky Hilton Has a Seriously Cute New Project (Cat Lovers, Prepare to Freak!)|url = http://stylenews.peoplestylewatch.com/2015/06/05/nicky-hilton-smashbox-cosmetics-collaboraton-wedding-details/|website = PEOPLE.com|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
At 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on August 15, 2004, Hilton married childhood friend and businessman Todd Meister at the Vegas Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,683766,00.html Nicky's Vegas Surprise], ''People'', August 19, 2004.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2235">'''Owner earnings''' is a [[Valuation (finance)|valuation]] method detailed by [[Warren Buffett]] in 1986. He stated that the [[Enterprise value|value of a company]] is simply the total of the net [[cash flow]]s ('''owner earnings''') expected to occur over the life of the business, minus any reinvestment of earnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hagstrom|first1=Robert|title=[[The Warren Buffett Way]]|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-64811-6|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buffett defined owner earnings as follows:

:"These represent (a) reported [[earnings]] plus (b) [[depreciation]], [[Depletion (accounting)|depletion]], [[Amortization (business)|amortization]], and certain other non-cash charges...less (c) the average annual amount of [[Capital expenditure|capitalized expenditures]] for [[fixed asset|plant and equipment]], etc. that the business requires to fully maintain its long-term competitive position and its unit volume....Our owner-earnings equation does not yield the deceptively precise figures provided by [[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]], since (c) must be a guess - and one sometimes very difficult to make. Despite this problem, we consider the owner earnings figure, not the GAAP figure, to be the relevant item for valuation purposes...All of this points up the absurdity of the '[[cash flow]]' numbers that are often set forth in [[Wall Street]] reports. These numbers routinely include (a) plus (b) - but do not subtract (c)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Buffett | first = Warren E. | title = 1986 Letter to Shareholders | publisher = Berkshire Hathaway, Inc | date = February 27, 1987 | url = http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1986.html | accessdate = 2007-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2973">'''Round-tripping''', also known as round-trip transactions or "Lazy Susans", is defined by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' as a form of [[barter]] that involves a company selling "an unused [[asset]] to another company, while at the same time agreeing to buy back the same or similar assets at about the same price."  Swapping assets on a round-trip produces no net [[economic substance]], but may be fraudulently reported  as a series of productive sales and beneficial purchases on the books of the companies involved, violating the [[substance over form]] accounting principle.  The companies appear to be growing and very ''busy'', but the round-tripping ''business'' does not generate profits.  Growth is an attractive factor to speculative investors, even if profits are lacking; such investment benefits companies and motivates them to undertake the illusory growth of round-tripping.

Round trips are characteristic of the [[New Economy]] companies. They played a crucial part in temporarily inflating the [[market capitalization]] of energy traders such as [[Enron]], [[CMS Energy]], [[Reliant Energy]], and [[Dynegy]]. 

In international scenarios, round tripping is used for tax evasion&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Hanlon, Edward L. Maydew, and Jacob R. Thornock: Taking the Long Way Home: Offshore Investments in U.S. Equity and Debt Markets and U.S. Tax Evasion; presented at 2010 National Tax Association meeting, EIASM 2011 Workshop on Current Research on Taxation at the University of Münster, 1 Sep.2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and money laundering as well.&lt;ref&gt;Aswath Rau and Pallabi Ghosal: “Entering the Tiger’s Den: Foreign Investment in India through Mauritius or Singapore”; ''Singapore Law Gazette'', Feb.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other companies making unconventional round-tripping deals include [[AOL]] with [[Sun Microsystems]] and [[Global Crossing]] with [[Qwest Communications]]. It is alleged that when some telecommunications companies swapped capacity, they booked the value of the incoming capacity as revenue and the value of the outgoing capacity as an [[investment]]. These transactions had the effect of inflating profits. The [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] ruled that booking revenues from swaps in telecommunications capacity was improper.

Many such companies have used round-tripping to distort the market by establishing false [[revenue recognition|revenue benchmarks]], aiming to meet or beat the numbers put out by [[Wall Street]] stock analysts. As a result of abusive round trips, barter between publicly held companies has become discredited among professional investors.

'''Sanofi S.A.''' is a French [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical company]] headquartered in Paris, [[France]], as of 2013 the world's fifth-largest by [[Prescription drug|prescription]] sales.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Palmer and Carly Helfand for FiercePharma. 4 March 2014 [http://www.fiercepharma.com/special-reports/top-10-pharma-companies-2013-revenue#ixzz2y9cVWuGd The top 10 pharma companies by 2013 revenue]&lt;/ref&gt; The company was formed as '''Sanofi-Aventis''' in 2004 by the merger of Aventis and Sanofi-Synthélabo, which were each the product of several previous mergers. It changed its name to Sanofi in May 2011. The company is a component of the [[Euro Stoxx 50]] [[stock market index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/en/equities/indices/euro+stoxx+50+EU0009658145/constituents|title=Börse Frankfurt (Frankfurt Stock Exchange): Stock market quotes, charts and news|website=www.boerse-frankfurt.de|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanofi engages in the [[research and development]], manufacturing and marketing of [[pharmaceutical drugs]] principally in the prescription market, but the firm also develops [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter medication]]. The company covers seven major therapeutic areas: [[Circulatory system|cardiovascular]], [[central nervous system]], [[diabetes]], [[internal medicine]], [[oncology]], [[thrombosis]] and [[vaccine]]s (it is the world's largest producer of the latter through its subsidiary [[Sanofi Pasteur]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2007/11/23/afx4368351.html|title=Sanofi-Aventis to sign deal to build flu vaccine plant in China - source|date=23 November 2007|work=[[AFX News]]|publisher=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=2009-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanofi-Synthélabo===
Sanofi was founded in 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/entreprises/le-fondateur-de-sanofi-est-mort_1366122.html|title=Le fondateur de Sanofi est mort|work=lexpress.fr|accessdate=4 June 2015|date=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a subsidiary of [[Elf Aquitaine]] (a French oil company subsequently acquired by [[Total S.A.|Total]]), when Elf Aquitaine took control of the Labaz group, a pharmaceutical company.  In 1993 Sanofi made a move into the Eastern Europe market by acquiring a controlling interest in Chinoin, a Hungarian drug company that had about US$104 million in sales in 1992.&lt;ref name=PL1993&gt;Staff, The Pharma Letter.

[[Synthélabo]] was founded in 1970 through the merger of two French pharmaceutical laboratories, Laboratoires Dausse (founded in 1834) and Laboratoires Robert &amp; Carrière (founded in 1899). In 1973, the French cosmetics group [[L’Oréal]] acquired the majority of its share capital.&lt;ref name=20F-2002/&gt;{{rp|19}}  In 1991, Synthelabo acquired Laboratories Delalande&lt;ref&gt;Denis Cosnard for Les Echos.  11 December 1991.

Sanofi-Synthélabo was formed in 1999 when Sanofi merged with Synthélabo; at the time of the merger Sanofi was the second largest pharmaceutical group in France in terms of sales and Synthélabo was the third largest. The merged company was based in Paris, France.&lt;ref name=20F-2002/&gt;{{rp|18–19}}&lt;ref&gt;Tom Meek for PMLiVE 24 May 2013 [http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/a_look_back_at_sanofis_merger_with_synthelabo_477146 A look back at Sanofi's merger with Synthélabo]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the merger, Rhône-Poulenc's business included the pharmaceutical businesses Rorer, Centeon (blood products), and [[Sanofi Pasteur|Pasteur Merieux]] (vaccines),  the plant and animal health businesses Rhône-Poulenc Agro, Rhône-Poulenc Animal Nutrition, and [[Merial]], and a 67 percent share in [[Rhodia (company)|Rhodia]], a speciality chemicals company.&lt;ref name=Bris/&gt;{{rp|10}}   Hoechst, one of the companies resulting from the post-WWII split of [[IG Farben]], had seven primary businesses: Hoechst Marion Roussel (pharmaceuticals), [[AgrEvo]] (a joint venture with [[Schering AG|Schering]] in crop protection agents and pest control products), HR Vet (veterinary products), [[Dade Behring]] (diagnostics), Centeon, [[Celanese]] (chemicals), and Messer (chemicals).&lt;ref name=Bris/&gt;{{rp|9}} [[Institut Mérieux|Merieux]] has been in the business of selling blood products, and In the 1980s during the [[History of HIV/AIDS#1981: From GRID to AIDS|AIDS epidemic]], Merieux and other companies were involved in scandals related to HIV-[[contaminated haemophilia blood products]] that were sold to developing nations.&lt;ref name = NYTimes1996&gt;{{cite news | title =  Blood, Money and AIDS: Haemophiliacs Are Split; Liability Cases Bogged Down in Disputes | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/11/business/blood-money-aids-hemophiliacs-are-split-liability-cases-bogged-down-disputes.html | first = Barry | last = Meier | date = 1996-06-11 | work = The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid 2000 Aventis and [[Millennium Pharmaceuticals]], a US biotechnology company formed to discover new drugs based on the then-new science of [[genomics]], announced that Aventis would make a $250M investment in Millennium and would pay $200M to Millennium in research fees over five years, one of the largest such deals between a big pharmaceutical company and a biotech company at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Pollack for the New York Times. 24 June 2000 [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/24/business/international-business-aventis-unit-sets-big-investment-biotechnology-start-up.html Aventis Unit Sets Big Investment in Biotechnology Start-Up]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sanofi-Aventis merger====
Sanofi-Aventis was formed in 2004 when Sanofi-Synthélabo acquired Aventis. In early 2004, Sanofi-Synthélabo made a [[Takeover|hostile takeover]] bid worth €47.8 billion for Aventis. Initially, Aventis rejected the bid because it felt that the bid offered inferior value based on the company's share value, and the board of Aventis went so far as to enact [[Shareholder rights plan|poison pill]] provisions and to invite [[Novartis]] to enter merger negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Timmons for the New York Times. 3 April 2004 [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/03/business/international-business-aventis-invites-novartis-to-counter-sanofi-s-bid.html Aventis Invites Novartis To Counter Sanofi's Bid]&lt;/ref&gt; The three-month takeover battle concluded when Sanofi-Synthélabo launched a friendly bid of €54.5 billion in place of the previously rejected hostile bid.  The [[France|French]] government played a strong role, desiring what it called a "local solution", by putting heavy pressure on Sanofi-Synthélabo to raise its bid for Aventis and for Aventis to accept the offer&lt;ref&gt;Heather Timmons for the New York Times. 27 April 2004 [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/27/business/france-helped-broker-the-aventis-sanofi-deal.html France Helped Broker the Aventis-Sanofi Deal]&lt;/ref&gt; and by rejecting Aventis' poison pill proposal.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times 24 April 2004 [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/24/business/aventis-plan-is-rejected.html Aventis Plan Is Rejected]&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the largest risks in the deal for both sides, was the fate of the patents protecting [[Clopidogrel]] (Plavix) which was one of the top-selling drugs in the world at the time and the major source of Sanofi's revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Kimberly S Cleaves and Ann M Thayer [http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/archive/mdd/v07/i08/pdf/804business2.pdf Warning, merge with care: Sanofi-Aventis] Modern Drug Discovery, August 2004:21-26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-merger activities===
In 2006, Iraqis infected with HIV sued Sanofi and Baxter due to HIV-[[contaminated haemophilia blood products]] sold by Merieux in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Paul von Zielbauer for the New York Times. 4 September 2006 [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/04/world/middleeast/04aids.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 Iraqis Infected by H.I.V.-Tainted Blood Try New Tool: A Lawsuit]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the US patents on [[clopidogrel]] (Plavix) were challenged when a Canadian generics company, [[Apotex]], filed an [[Abbreviated New Drug Application]] under the [[Hatch-Waxman Act]], received FDA approval, and started marketing a generic clopidogrel. While Sanofi-Aventis and its partner on the drug, [[Bristol Myers Squibb]] (BMS), were able to get an injunction to stop Apotex from selling the drug,&lt;ref&gt;BMS Press Release. 8 December 2006 [http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/preliminary-injunction-against-apotex-upheld-on-appeal-56053592.html Preliminary Injunction Against Apotex Upheld on Appeal]&lt;/ref&gt; the case became complicated when settlement negotiations fell apart twice - the second time due to an [[oral agreement]] made by BMS CEO Peter Dolan that BMS failed to disclose to the [[Federal Trade Commission]] during the review of the settlement agreement to ensure that it did not violate [[antitrust]] law.  When Apotex disclosed the oral agreement to the FTC, the FTC launched an investigation that led to Dolan being fired by BMS.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Smith for CNNMoney.com 26 October 2006 [http://money.cnn.com/2006/09/12/news/companies/bristol/index.htm?postversion=2006091217 Bristol CEO Dolan gets fired: Company says it heeded request of a federal monitor]&lt;/ref&gt;  Apotex finally lost on the patent litigation issues after its third appeal was decided in favor of BMS/Sanofi in November 2011; Apotex had to pay ~$442 million in damages and ~$108 million in interest for infringing the patent,&lt;ref&gt;Donald Zuhn for Patent Docs. 9 November 2011 [http://www.patentdocs.org/2011/11/sanofi-aventis-v-apotex-inc-fed-cir-2011.html Sanofi-Aventis v.

In 2007 Sanofi-Aventis expanded on Aventis' prior relationship with [[Regeneron]]; in the new deal Sanofi-Aventis agreed to pay Regeneron $100 million each year for five years, under which Regeneron would use its [[monoclonal antibody]] [[drug discovery|discovery]] platform to create new [[biopharmaceuticals]], which Sanofi-Aventis gained the exclusive right to co-develop.&lt;ref name=RegenExpand&gt;Ron Winslow for the Wall Street Journal. 10 Nov. 2009 [https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703808904574528224003357650 Sanofi Expands Regeneron Deal]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009 the companies expanded the deal to $160 million per year and extended it through 2017.&lt;ref name=RegenExpand/&gt;&lt;ref name=GEN2009&gt;Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News. 11 Nov 2009 [http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/sanofi-aventis-commits-over-2-8b-to-regeneron-in-mab-discovery-alliance/68174500/ Sanofi-Aventis Commits Over $2.8B to Regeneron in mAb Discovery Alliance]&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2009 the collaboration had four antibodies in clinical development and had filed an IND for a fifth.

Between 2008, when Chris Viebacher was hired as CEO, and 2010, the company spent more than $17 billion in mergers and acquisitions to strengthen its consumer healthcare and generics platforms, especially in emerging markets, in the face of looming [[patent cliff]]s and the growth of the consumer healthcare segment.&lt;ref&gt;FierceBiotech.

===Rename to Sanofi and beyond===
The company dropped the -Aventis suffix of its name on 6 May 2011 after receiving approval at its [[annual general meeting]]. The reason given by the company for the change was to make its name easier to pronounce in countries such as China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mennella|first=Noelle|title=Sanofi changes name, pace of acquisitions to slow|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/06/sanofi-idUSLDE74521Z20110506|accessdate=7 May 2011|date=6 May 2011|agency=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Teriflunomide]] (Aubagio), small molecule for [[multiple sclerosis]]. Approved by the FDA in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

'''Product recall and effects''': The Epinephrine auto-injection devices made by Sanofi SA currently on the market in the U.S. and Canada were voluntarily recalled on 28 October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/allerject-epinephrine-auto-injectors-recalled-by-drugmaker-sanofi-1.3293765|title=All Allerject epinephrine auto-injectors recalled|website=Cbc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allerject.ca/Common/docs/en/Sanofi-Canada-Issues-Voluntary-Recall-of-Allerject.pdf|format=PDF|title=Sanofi Canada Issues Voluntary Nationwide Recall of Allerject Due to Potential Inaccurate Dosage Delivery|website=Allerject.ca|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reason stated by Sanofi was that the products have been found to potentially have inaccurate dosage delivery, which may include failure to deliver drug.&lt;ref name="auvi-q.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.auvi-q.com/|title=Auvi-Q® (epinephrine injection, USP)|website=Auvi-q.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fda.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm469980.htm|title=Recalls, Market Withdrawals, &amp; Safety Alerts - UPDATED: Sanofi US Issues Voluntary Nationwide Recall of All Auvi-Q® Due to Potential Inaccurate Dosage Delivery|first=Office of Regulatory Affairs, Office of the|last=Commissioner|website=www.fda.gov|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanofi US also added the following warning: If a patient experiencing a serious allergic reaction (i.e., anaphylaxis) did not receive the intended dose, there could be significant health consequences, including death because anaphylaxis is a potentially life‑threatening condition.&lt;ref name="auvi-q.com"/&gt;

In its news release on 28 October 2015, Sanofi Canada stated that it was "actively working with suppliers of alternative epinephrine auto-injectors to have a full stock available in Canada as soon as possible. Canadian customers were asked to immediately return the Allerject product to their local pharmacy to obtain an alternate epinephrine auto-injector."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/sanofi-canada-issues-voluntary-nationwide-recall-of-allerject-due-to-potential-inaccurate-dosage-delivery-538090301.html|title=Sanofi Canada Issues Voluntary Nationwide Recall of Allerject® Due to Potential Inaccurate Dosage|website=Newswire.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also filed a news release&lt;ref name="fda.gov"/&gt; confirming that the recall involves all Auvi-Q currently on the market in the U.S. The FDA release went on to provide information for consumers re: exchanging the device for another brand of product, also provided on the Auivi-Q web site. Sanofi US will provide reimbursement for out of pocket costs incurred for the purchase of new, alternate epinephrine auto-injectors with proof of purchase.

The alternate products expected to most commonly replace the recalled Sanofi devices are the EpiPens made by [[Mylan]] in the US and by Pfizer—under license from Mylan—in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epipen101.ca/en/welcome|title=Welcome to EpiPen® 101|website=Epipen101.ca|date=2015-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mylan already had an 85% market share of the auto-injectors in the US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-23/how-marketing-turned-the-epipen-into-a-billion-dollar-business|title=How Marketing Turned the EpiPen Into a Billion-Dollar Business|first=Cynthia Koons CynthiaLKoons Robert Langreth RobertLangreth|last=Reprints|website=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the first half of 2015. Maylan was expected to benefit from the recall by its competitor Sanofi, according to a report published in the Fierce Pharma newsletter of 2 November 2015: "....it is very hard to see Auvi-Q returning to the market, as it will need to be redesigned and face uphill battle to recapture patient trust after the recall," Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal wrote in a note to clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercepharmamarketing.com/story/sanofis-auvi-q-recall-puts-mylans-rival-epipen-full-control-blockbuster-mar/2015-11-02|title=Sanofi's Auvi-Q recall puts Mylan's rival EpiPen in full control of blockbuster market - FiercePharma|website=Fiercepharmamarketing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gal also believes that the company will eventually have 95% of the Epinephrine auto-injector market, according to another Fierce Pharma report on 3 November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/its-open-season-mylans-epipen-sanofi-teva-stumble/2015-11-02|title=It's open season for Mylan's EpiPen as Sanofi, Teva stumble - FiercePharma|website=Fiercepharma.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the summer of 2013, Sanofi was in a race with [[Amgen]] and [[Pfizer]] to win approval for a [[PCSK9 inhibitor|drug that inhibits PCSK9]], a protein that slows the clearance of [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL) cholesterol - the form of cholesterol that leads to heart attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Gina Kolata for the New York Times. 9 July 2013 [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/health/rare-mutation-prompts-race-for-cholesterol-drug.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all Rare Mutation Ignites Race for Cholesterol Drug]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sanofi's drug was discovered by [[Regeneron]] and is called [[alirocumab]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regeneron.com/regn727 Alirocumab on Regeneron's website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416102019/http://www.regeneron.com/regn727 |date=16 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An FDA warning in March 2014 about possible cognitive adverse effects of PCSK9 inhibition threw the competition into disarray, as the FDA asked companies to include neurocognitive testing into their [[Phase III]] clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;John Carroll for FierceBiotech 7 March 2014 [http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/regeneron-sanofi-and-amgen-shares-suffer-fdas-frets-about-pcsk9-drug/2014-03-07 UPDATED: Regeneron, Sanofi and Amgen shares suffer on FDA's frets about PCSK9 class]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Sanofi moved its head office location to 54, [[Rue La Boétie]] in the [[8th arrondissement of Paris]]. This former mansion designed by architect René-Patouillard had previously been the head office of Alcatel-Lucent.

Sanofi's previous head office was located in the [[13th arrondissement of Paris]], 174 Avenue de France. The architecture of the head office is of the predominant style of the area surrounding the [[François Mitterrand Library]]. After Sanofi and Aventis merged, the employees at the former Aventis head office in [[Schiltigheim]], [[Alsace]] moved to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.journaldunet.com/economie/reportage/les-sieges-sociaux-des-entreprises-du-cac-40/sanofi-aventis-regroupement-a-paris.shtml Sanofi-Aventis : regroupement à Paris]."

{{About|the European mobile commerce consortium|the American payment service provider|Simpay (United States)}}

'''SimPay''' was a [[consortium]] which was founded to promote [[mobile payment]] in 2003 but which was closed as of June 2005.&lt;ref name="The Register 2005"&gt;{{cite web | title=Simpay halts mobile commerce project | website=The Register | date=June 27, 2005 | url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/06/27/simpay_halts_project/ | accessdate=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simpay started in Spain by a number of mobile phone companies to build a open, interoperable solution, but was abandoned when key members pulled out in 2005.&lt;ref name="Button 2005"&gt;{{cite web | title=Man's best friend | website=The Economist | date=April 2, 2005 | url=http://www.economist.com/node/3785212 | accessdate=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In February 2003, [[T-Mobile]], [[Orange SA|Orange]], [[Telefónica]] and [[Vodafone]] formed a new [[Mobile Payment Services Association]] (MPSA)  with the goal to deliver an open, interoperable and commonly branded solution for payments via [[mobile phone]]s, designed to work across all operator networks. In June 2003 the consortium re-branded itself as SimPay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Hammersley | first=Ben | title=Put the tab on my mobile | website=The Guardian | date=May 27, 2004 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2004/may/27/phones.creditcards | ref=harv | accessdate=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005, [[Orange España|Amena]] and [[Proximus]] joined the consortium.

Simpay planned to create a pan-European framework whereby merchants and content resellers would be able to charge for products and services directly to a subscriber's bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Shillingford | first=Joia | title=Mobile wallets start to take shape | website=BBC News | date=March 1, 2005 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4287341.stm | ref=harv | accessdate=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=`Simpay' blurring the line between a telecom and a bank | website=Taipei Times | date=May 30, 2004 | url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2004/05/30/2003157563 | ref={{sfnref | Taipei Times | 2004}} | accessdate=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Capturing business requirements using use cases | publisher=IBM | date=December 15, 2004 | url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/dec04/behrens/ | ref={{sfnref | IBM | 2004}} | accessdate=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005, Simpay decided, "following the decision of one of its founding Members not to launch Simpay for the foreseeable future, [...] not to pursue its activity on a pan-European scale as originally planned." All activities were put on hold effective June 24, 2005.

The UK Simpay founders started work in 2005 on a project called "Payforit" which was launched in 2007 to provide similar services in the UK.

'''St. Joseph's Chapel''' is a mission parish of [[St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church (Manhattan)|St. Peter's Church]], the oldest [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York|Catholic]] parish in New York State. Established in 1983, it is located at 385 South End Avenue, [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].

==History==
St. Joseph's traces its origin to [[Maronite Church|Maronite Catholics]] who held services in a lower church at [[St. Peter's Catholic Church (Manhattan)|St. Peter's]] on Barclay Street from 1899 to 1906,&lt;ref name=Stpetes&gt;[http://www.spcolr.org/st-peters-church "History", St. Peter's Church]&lt;/ref&gt; when they built their own church on Washington Street.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KL4YAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA417&amp;lpg=PA417&amp;dq=St.+Joseph+Church+liberty+street+nyc&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EwNFAhrCeZ&amp;sig=FDjmqhiyk_mAI3qjF0EID5HBqU0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibqYPM47bLAhVJPD4KHXnaADg4ChDoAQgmMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=St.%20Joseph%20Church%20liberty%20street%20nyc&amp;f=false ''The Catholic Church in the United States of America'', p. 343, Catholic Editing Company, 1914]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, the Maronite community also established the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Lebanon in Brooklyn.

In 1946, the City of New York took title to the Washington Street property in connection with the construction of the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel. Saint Joseph’s Church moved to 157 Cedar Street next to the [[St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church]]. The new location was heavily remodeled including the removal of the top two floors and in use by May 1949. In 1969 the Saint Joseph’s Church property was sold to the Archdiocese of New York, but later the property was taken again by eminent domain, in anticipation of the construction of a building at the World Trade Center, which was never actually built.&lt;ref name=ololc&gt;[http://www.ololc.org/about.html "History of Our Lady of Lebanon", Our Lady of Lebanon Cathedral]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, St Joseph’s moved to Battery Park City at 385 South End Avenue and affiliated with St Peter’s Church. The Cedar Street location was razed and turned into parking. After the [[September 11 attacks]], in 2002, the cornerstone was discovered in the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] rubble.&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/911-museums-biggest-oversight-world-trade-centers-neighborhood-253584 "The 9/11 Museum's Biggest Oversight: The World Trade Center's Neighborhood", ''Newsweek'', June 5, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently on display at [[Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral (Brooklyn)|Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral]] in Brooklyn.

The chapel survived the [[9/11|September 11th Attacks]] and sheltered its inhabitants from harm from the disaster a mere one and a half blocks away. After the attacks, rescue and emergency staff removed the pews and operated the chapel as a command station.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/nyregion/st-josephs-chapel-sept-11-attacks.html "Chapel That Survived Sept. 11 Attacks May Not Survive Rent Increase," New York Times, April 18, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The chapel was renovated in 2002 after the events of 9/11 and reopened on September 11, 2002. It was rededicated by [[Edward Egan|Archbishop Edward Cardinal Egan]] as a Catholic September 11 Memorial on May 22, 2005.

==Closure==

In 2017, St. Joseph's Chapel was threatened with closure due to the St. Peter's parish's reluctance or inability to pay a tripling of its rent by a management company run by [[Richard LeFrak|LeFrak]] corporation and partners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nypost.com/2017/04/09/chapel-that-served-911-first-responders-could-shutter/ "Chapel that served 9/11 first responders could shutter," ''New York Post'', April 9, 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/nyregion/st-josephs-chapel-sept-11-attacks.html "Chapel That Survived Sept. 11 Attacks May Not Survive Rent Increase," ''New York Times'', April 18, 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, an announcement was made from St. Peter's that despite the community's efforts to achieve a better solution, St. Joseph's Chapel would indeed close in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://spcolr.org/documents/2017/12/Chapel.pdf "Announcement posted on St. Peter's parish website"]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7618">A '''stalking horse offer''', '''agreement''', or '''bid''' is an attempt by a bankrupt [[debtor]] to test the market for the debtor's assets in advance of an auction of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lexicon.ft.com/term.asp?t=stalking-horse Financial Times Lexicon] from the ''Financial Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=investopedia.&gt;{{cite web|title=Stalking-Horse Bid|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stalkinghorsebid.asp|website=investopedia.com|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent is to maximize the value of its [[asset]]s or avoid low bids, as part of (or before) a [[court auction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focusmg.com/articles/stalking-horse The ‘Stalking Horse’ in a US Chapter 11 363 Sale], ''Financier Worldwide''’s May 2006 Edition &lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==

While entering a [[stalking horse]] offer, the debtor can offer [[bidding]] protections such as [[breakup fee]]s to its best bidder before the auction. These incentives enhance the value of the offering for the bidder which might lead to a better price offer before the auction begins. This higher offer is now the starting offer for the auction and may result in benefiting the debtor and its [[Estate (law)|estate]].

==Examples==
On October 22, 2007, technology company [[SCO Group|SCO]] asked a bankruptcy court to approve a deal whereby a purchaser would acquire "substantially all assets used by the Company in connection with its SCO [[UNIX]] Business and certain related claims in litigation." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102542/000095013407021831/v34793e8vk.htm |title=The SCO Group, Inc. |work=Form 8-K |publisher=SEC.gov |date= October 22, 2007|accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement included a "stalking horse" provision: If the purchaser, York Capital Management, were to be designated as a stalking horse in subsequent bidding for SCO's assets, and if others outbid York, then SCO would have to pay York a $780,000 breakup fee and reimbursement of all expenses incurred by York up to $300,000. In this way, York would earn its expenses and $780,000 by acting as the stalking horse and preventing other bidders from making lowball offers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20071023172159177 |title= SCO Has a Bid; Would Like More - Updated |publisher= Groklaw |date= 2007-10-23 |accessdate= 2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 4, 2008, Steve and Barry's LLC, a [[retailer]] of casual apparel, filed a stalking horse agreement with the [[U.S. Bankruptcy Court]] for the [[Southern District of New York]]. Their partner in this [[asset purchase agreement]] was BH S&amp;B Holding LLC, a subsidiary of [[Bay Harbor Management]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20080804006183&amp;newsLang=en "Steve &amp; Barry’s Files “Stalking Horse” Agreement"], from Businesswire.com, 4 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 27, 2009, ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported that Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson had won a stalking horse bid to acquire Nortel Networks Corp's CDMA division, for $1.13 billion.  &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124849670377181071#mod=djemITP "Ericsson Powers Up U.S. Presence With Nortel Deal"], from ''The Wall Street Journal'', 27 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, 2010, the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] [[Major League Baseball]] team announced a potential stalking horse deal.  "'An auction with a stalking horse, or minimum, bid is more frequently used than a so-called “naked” auction without a floor price,' William K. Snyder, the court-appointed restructuring officer, said. 'Moreover, the stalking horse bidder commonly receives a “reasonable” break-up fee if unsuccessful in the auction,' said Snyder. Under the scrapped plan, the $304 million in cash portion of the Greenberg-Ryan group’s May 24 deal with owner Tom Hicks would serve as a minimum bid, with the next bid at least $20 million higher. Greenberg-Ryan would have received $15 million if it lost."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.star-telegram.com/2010/07/08/2323117/texas-rangers-proposed-july-16.html#ixzz0t9CX7uO2 Texas Rangers' Proposed July 16 Auction Scrapped]{{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 21, 2011, ''Reuters'' reported [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster]]'s intention to pursue a $290 million stalking horse offer with Cobalt Video Holdco. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/21/us-blockbuster-idUSTRE71K5SO20110221 "Blockbuster gets $290 million stalking horse bid"], from ''Reuters'', 21 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, 2011, ''TechCrunch'' reported [[Google]]'s intention to pursue a $900 million stalking horse bid for [[Nortel]]'s patents.&lt;ref&gt; [https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/04/google-makes-900-million-stalking-horse-bid-for-nortel-patents/ "Google Makes $900 Million Stalking-Horse Bid For Nortel Patents As It Looks To Fend Off Trolls"], from ''TechCrunch'', 4 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Hostess Brands]] used a stalking horse auction to sell off its assets in bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hostess CEO Says Stalking-Horse Bids Total $858 Million|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-01-31/hostess-ceo-says-stalking-horse-bids-total-858-million|author=Milford, P., McCarty, D.|publisher=Bloomberg|date=January 31, 2013|accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 17, 2013, Designline, now known as [[Environmental Performance Vehicles]]  the Charlotte, NC bus manufacturer, used the technique but received no offers.    &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/176993715/DesignLine-Stalking-Horse-Bidders|title = DesignLine Stalking Horse Bidders|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 15, 2013, [[Eastman Kodak]] proposed a stalking horse deal of $210 million whereby [[Brother Industries]] would acquire Kodak's Document Imaging division ahead of Kodak's bankruptcy court approval slated for June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kodak tentatively sells its scanning business to Brother for $210 million|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/04/15/kodak-tentatively-sells-its-scanning-business-to-brother|last=Fingus|first=Jon|publisher=AOL|work= engadget.com|date=April 15, 2013 |accessdate= 2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 10, 2016, [[Ziff Davis]] proposed a stalking-horse bid of under US$90 million after [[Gawker Media]] announced it was filing for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/10/gawker-media-files-for-ch-11-bankruptcy-protection.html|title=Gawker Media auction starts with Ziff Davis bid amid bankruptcy|last=Balakrishnan|first=Anita|date=2016-06-10|website=CNBC|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/11/business/media/gawker-bankruptcy-sale.html|title=Gawker, Filing for Bankruptcy After Hulk Hogan Suit, Is for Sale|last=Ember|first=Sydney|date=2016-06-10|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2016/08/16/hogan-vs-gawker-aftermath-update-gawkers-bankruptcy-sale-unfolding-week/|title=Hogan vs. Gawker Aftermath – Univision reportedly to buy bankrupt Gawker|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2016-08-16|website=PWTorch|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1693">'''Sulaiman Hamad Al Gosaibi''' was Chairman of the Board of the [[Ahmad Hamad Al Gosaibi &amp; Brothers]] Group of Companies based in [[Khobar|Alkhobar]], [[Saudi Arabia]] until his death in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coker |first=Margaret |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125616910974700325#project%3DGOISABI0910%26articleTabs%3Dinteractive |title=A Saudi Family Feud Roils World Banks - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2009-10-22 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Inheriting a small but growing trading company from their father, Sulaiman was the youngest of three brothers who built a diversified business group with interests across the commercial spectrum, keeping pace with the [[Saudi Arabia|Kingdom's]] [[Saudi Aramco|petroleum fueled]] growth.  Sulaiman was, until his death, the sole surviving brother and [[patriarch]] of the family [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] that was once considered among [[Saudi Arabia]]'s most formidable [[merchant]] empires. He was its largest shareholder though management of the Group has been primarily delegated to the hands of his nephews, Yousef Ahmad Al Gosaibi (Group President) and  [[Saud Abdul Aziz Al Gosaibi]] (Group Managing Director).  His son, Dawood Sulaiman Al Gosaibi, is also active in family investments.

'''Surangel S. Whipps''' is a [[Palau]]an businessman and [[politician]]. He served as the president of the [[Senate of Palau]] from 2007 to 2009, and as the speaker of the [[House of Delegates of Palau]] from 1993 to 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.palauoek.net/senate/SenatorWhipps.asp |title=Biography on senate website |accessdate=2008-11-05 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724001450/http://www.palauoek.net/senate/SenatorWhipps.asp |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is from [[Airai]]. His net worth as of January 2018 is around $450 million US dollars.

He graduated from [[University of Baltimore]] in 1971 and returned to Palau in 1972.

==Politics==
In January 2008, Whipps proposed a bill requiring the [[minimum wage]] to apply not just to Palauans, but to non-resident workers as well. It was reasoned that this would help more Palauans to become employed, due to the increased cost of hiring non-resident workers.&lt;ref name=ngelekelbelau&gt;[http://ngelekelbelau.blogspot.com.au/2008/02/should-non-resident-workers-be-granted.html "Should non-resident workers be granted minimum wage?"], nGelEkeL BeLau, 5 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tadich Grill''' is a [[seafood]] restaurant located in the [[Financial District, San Francisco|Financial District]] neighborhood of [[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States]]. It is the oldest continuously running restaurant in San Francisco,&lt;ref name="Berne"/&gt; having opened in 1849 as a coffee stand. In the 1920s, the Tadich Grill claimed to be the first American restaurant to grill seafood over [[mesquite]] charcoal,&lt;ref name="frommers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/sanfrancisco/D41090.html |title=Tadich Grill|publisher=[[Frommer's]]|accessdate=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; a traditional [[Croat]] method.

==History==
[[File:Menu, Tadich Grill, San Francisco 1983 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Menu, Tadich Grill, San Francisco 1983]]
The original restaurant opened in 1849 as a coffee stand on Clay Street&lt;ref name="Berne"/&gt; in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="frommers"/&gt; In 1887, John Tadich from [[Stari Grad, Croatia|Stari Grad]] (island of [[Hvar]], [[Croatia]])&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam S. Eterovich]]: [http://www.croatians.com/BIOGRAPHY-AMERICA-S-Z.htm Croatian Heritage] Biographies S - Z&lt;/ref&gt; purchased and renamed the restaurant after his surname. In 1928 the Buich family bought the restaurant from Tadich; they continue to own the restaurant today. In 1967 the restaurant moved to its present location at 240 [[California Street (San Francisco)|California Street]]; this was after [[Wells Fargo]] bought the Clay Street location for redevelopment. The current space is one-third larger than the original, and the Buiches worked with contractors to recreate the [[Art Deco]] interior design that the Clay Street space had. All of the moldings and woodwork were copied, and the original Clay Street bar was moved to the present location. The restaurant reopened within one month of moving.&lt;ref name="Berne"/&gt;

In 1925, Louis Buich advised that the chefs use a [[mesquite]] [[charbroiler|broiler]] for cooking fish. A native of [[Croatia]], Buich was familiar with the technique, as it was a traditional Croatian style. The Tadich's use of grilling became popular, and in a single day the restaurant can go through four 40-pound bags of mesquite charcoal. Little has changed in regards to the restaurant's cooking techniques, and the restaurant has only had seven chefs since 1925 (as of 2011).&lt;ref name="Berne"/&gt;

==Today==

Today, the menu focuses on seafood, [[stews]], and [[casserole]]. Ingredients are [[local food|locally sourced]], including seafood such as [[Dungeness crab]] and [[sand dab]]. The restaurant also offers a day-of-the-week menu, which has remained unchanged for many years. Items on the day-of-the-week menu include [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] [[Roasting|roast]] on Mondays, [[beef tongue]] on Tuesdays, and [[corned beef and cabbage]] on Thursdays. [[Oysters]] are also a major feature on the menu and most, if not all, menu items are prepared in restaurant. [[Prawns]] are the only frozen fish at the restaurant, and the Tadich actively avoids selling fish that is overfished, limiting sales of fish such as [[White seabass|sea bass]].&lt;ref name="Berne"/&gt;

Waiters wear white jackets and black pants and the restaurant does not take reservations. On busy days, the Tadich can see between 600-800 patrons waiting in line to dine at the restaurant. On average, the restaurant serves 700 meals a day.&lt;ref name="Berne"&gt;{{cite news

== Three components of the model ==
The triple helix model of innovation, as theorized by Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff, is based on the interactions between the three following elements and their associated ‘initial role’:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leydesdorff.net/th11/th11.pdf|title=The Triple Helix in the context of global change: dynamics and challenges|last=Leydesdorff, Loet; Lawton Smith, Helen|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; universities engaging in basic research, industries producing commercial goods and governments that are regulating markets.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As interactions increase within this framework, each component evolves to adopt some characteristics of the other institution, which then gives rise to hybrid institutions. Bilateral interactions exist between university, industry and government.

=== University-industry interactions ===

Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff argue that the initial role of universities is to provide education to individuals and basic research. Therefore, interactions between university and industry revolve initially around those two elements. In a [[linear model of innovation]], universities are supposed to provide the research on which industry will build upon to produce commercial goods.  The other interactions take place through the involvement of industry managers and university faculty in both sectors. According to Etzkowitz, the transfer of people between university and industry constitutes a very important transfer of knowledge. This can be a permanent move in one direction or the other, or in other cases, entire careers spent between the two spheres. He gives the example of [[Carl Djerassi]], a research director for a pharmaceutical company who joined Stanford University while continuing his industrial activity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

However, other scholars have pointed out that consulting activities of faculty members could also have drawbacks, like a reduced focus on educating the students, and potential conflict of interests relating to the use of university resources for the benefit of industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyer|first=Carol M.|last2=Lewis|first2=Darrell R.|date=1984|title=Faculty Consulting: Responsibility or Promiscuity?|jstor=1981827|journal=The Journal of Higher Education|volume=55|issue=5|pages=637–659|doi=10.2307/1981827}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional transfer of knowledge between university and industry happens through informal communication, conferences or industrial interest in university publications.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sampat|first=Bhaven N.|title=Patenting and US academic research in the 20th century: The world before and after Bayh-Dole|journal=Research Policy|volume=35|issue=6|pages=772–789|doi=10.1016/j.respol.2006.04.009|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another type of interaction, for example, is the creation of co-op programs like the MIT-General Electric course&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carlson|first=W. Bernard|date=1988|title=Academic Entrepreneurship and Engineering Education: Dugald C. Jackson and the MIT-GE Cooperative Engineering Course, 1907-1932|jstor=3105273|journal=Technology and Culture|volume=29|issue=3|pages=536–567|doi=10.2307/3105273}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims at integrating an industry approach into the students' curricula.

=== University-government interactions ===

The strength of the interactions between the government and universities depends on the government’s general relationship to and policy towards higher education. Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff's model uses a spectrum to define the extent of these interactions. On the one hand, when higher education is largely public, as in continental western Europe, the government has a higher influence on universities and the research they conduct by being the main source of funding.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On the other hand of the spectrum, typically associated with the United States, universities have a higher degree of independence from government influence although they also receive funding. However, the two ends of this spectrum are used as ideal-types that are not necessarily reflective of the reality.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Etzkowitz|first=Henry|date=2002-2011|title=The Triple Helix of University - Industry - Government Implications for Policy and Evaluation|url=http://www.sister.nu/pdf/wp_11.pdf|journal=Institutet för Studier av Utbildning och Forskning|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changing circumstances can push the government to create closer ties with academia, for example in wartime, and/or through funding of strategic disciplines, like physics. For example, in the United States, the [[Ministry of Defence|Department of Defense]] has extensively funded physics research during [[World War II]] and the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=acls;idno=heb00988.0001.001|title=The Cold War and American science: the military-industrial-academic complex at MIT and Stanford|last=Leslie|first=Stuart W.|date=1993|publisher=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of state involvement in higher education is the establishment of new universities, as through the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts]] of 1862 encouraging the creation of [[Land-grant university|land-grant colleges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kargon|first=Robert H.|last2=Knowles|first2=Scott G.|date=2002-01-01|title=Knowledge for Use: Science, Higher Learning, and America's New Industrial Heartland, 1880-1915|journal=Annals of Science|volume=59|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/00033790010028188|issn=0003-3790}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cornell University]], the [[University of Florida]] and [[Purdue University]] are three of the seventy-six institutions created under the land-grant.

=== Government-industry interactions ===

The relationship between governments and industry depends on the government’s attitude towards the market. In liberal economies the role of the government will be limited to preventing market failures. On the other hand, where the government is more involved in the economy, the government’s role is the regulation of the industry. These are also two ends of a spectrum, leaving room for substantial variation, based on circumstances and disciplines.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, as pointed out by Bhaven Sampat, in the 1960s, the government created a regulation to prevent patenting by or licensing to industry of university research funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; One key role of the government in its interaction with industry is the establishment of intellectual property law and its enforcement.

=== Strength of interaction ===
Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff initially argued that the strength of the interactions between governments, industry and university depends on which component is the driving force in the framework. In a statist model, a strong state is driving interactions between the three components in a top-down implementation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It creates stronger ties and a more integrated model. In a laissez-faire model, in which the industry and market forces are the leading forces, the ties are weaker and each institution tends to remain very independent. However, the distinction between the two models is not always clear cut, as the government can choose to adopt a strong or a weak stance depending on the context and the industry.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In a recent paper, Etzkowitz emphasized that the shift towards a knowledge-based society has given a bigger role to universities. Indeed, as innovation is increasingly based on scientific knowledge, the role of universities as creators of knowledge is more valued.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Etzkowitz|first=Henry|date=2003-09-01|title=Innovation in Innovation: The Triple Helix of University-Industry-Government Relations|journal=Social Science Information|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=293–337|doi=10.1177/05390184030423002|issn=0539-0184}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he argues that university, industry and government are more equal,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and that no particular element is necessarily the driving force of the triple helix model of innovation.

== Evolution and hybridization ==
The triple helix model of innovation also blurred the boundaries of the traditional basic roles of university, industry and government. According to Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff, this marks the second step in the triple helix of innovation framework.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; For example, universities increasingly take part in commercial activity through patenting and licensing, moving beyond the production of basic research. The next step is the emergence of intermediaries between the three elements as well as the hybridization of the three entities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nevertheless, each entity retains a strong primacy in its original field of expertise: the university remains the main source of knowledge production, industry is the primary vehicle of commercialization and the government retains its regulatory role.

Technology transfer offices have been established by universities to foster the transformation of university basic or applied research with a commercial value into commercial goods. One of the aims of TTOs is to create some revenues for the university, thus enhancing its role as an economic actor. However, the average profitability of TTOs remains very low.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, the revenues earned through the licensing of patents by TTOs in American universities are, on average, ten times larger than for European TTOs according to the Innovation Policy Platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.innovationpolicyplatform.org/sites/default/files/rdf_imported_documents/TechnologyTransferOffices.pdf|title=Technology transfer offices - Policy Brief|last=|first=|date=|website=Innovation Policy Platform|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science parks have also emerged as the result of the collaboration of industries and universities with the government.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; They can stem from the initiative of an industrial region to modernize itself with the impulse of a university. On the other hand, they can be the result of a university initiative to attract industry, as was the case with the development of [[Stanford University|Stanford]]'s science park around the university or the [[Research Triangle Park|Research Triangle]] in North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leslie|first=Stuart W.|last2=Kargon|first2=Robert H.|date=1996|title=Selling Silicon Valley: Frederick Terman's Model for Regional Advantage|jstor=3117312|journal=The Business History Review|volume=70|issue=4|pages=435–472|doi=10.2307/3117312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'entrepreneurial university' is another hybrid element which Etzkowitz defines around the following elements : the capitalization of knowledge, strong ties with industry and governments, a high degree of independence, and permanent evolution of the relationships between universities, industry and government.  Etzkowitz recognizes [[MIT]] as a great example of an 'entrepreneurial university’.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Quadruple helix model ==

Building on the triple helix model, the quadruple helix model adds a fourth component to the framework of interactions between university, industry and government: civil society and the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cavallini, Simona; Soldi, Rossella; Friedl, Julia; Volpe, Margherita|date=2016|title=Using the Quadruple Helix Approach to Accelerate the Transfer of Research and Innovation Results to Regional Growth|url=http://cor.europa.eu/en/documentation/studies/Documents/quadruple-helix.pdf|journal=European Union Committee of the Regions|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first suggested by Elias G. Carayannis and David F.J. Campbell in "‘Mode 3’ and ‘Quadruple Helix’: toward a 21st century fractal innovation ecosystem".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carayannis, E.G. and Campbell, D.F.J.|date=2009|title='Mode 3' and 'Quadruple Helix': toward a 21st century fractal innovation ecosystem|url=https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/3572572/mod_resource/content/1/8-carayannis2009.pdf|journal=Int. J. Technology Management|volume= 46| issue =  3/4|pages=201–234|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The aim is to bridge the gaps between innovation and civil society. Indeed, this framework claims that under the triple helix model, the emerging technologies do not always match the demands and needs of society, thus limiting their potential impact. This framework emphasizes a societal responsibility of universities, in addition to their role of educating and conduction research. This is the approach that the [[European Union]] has intended to take for the development of a competitive knowledge-based society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cresson|first=Edith|date=17 November 1997|title=Towards a Knowledge-based Europe. Lecture by Mrs Edith Cresson at the London School of Economics and Political Science|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quadruple helix model has been argued to include both the civil society and the users of innovation. How to define this fourth helix has been debated according to Högluind and Linton (2018)&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Höglund|first=Linda|last2=Linton|first2=Gabriel|date=2017-12-27|title=Smart specialization in regional innovation systems: a quadruple helix perspective|journal=R&amp;D Management|language=en|volume=48|issue=1|pages=60–72|doi=10.1111/radm.12306|issn=0033-6807}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some researchers see it as an additional helix while some see it as a different type of helix which is overarching all the other helices.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

== Triple helix and policy making ==
The triple helix model has been used as a lens through which evolving relationships between university, industry and government can be analyzed. But according to Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff, it can also be a policy making tool. For example, Etzkowitz argues that after the end of the Soviet Era, triple helix inspired policies were implemented in Eastern Europe to promote their growth. In Sweden, the triple helix policy aimed at tying together innovation initiatives at different scales to increase their overall efficiency.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  They emphasize the relevance of implementing the triple helix model for developing countries and regions.

=== Criticism of the model ===

The triple helix model as a policy-making tool for economic growth and regional development has been criticized by many scholars. One main criticism is that Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff’s framework was developed within Western developed countries, which means that it is based on a particular set of infrastructures and under circumstances. For instance, the model take for granted that knowledge intensive activities are linked to economic growth, that intellectual property rights will be protected, and that the state has a democratic and market oriented culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.triplehelixconference.org/th/11/bic/docs/Papers/Cai.pdf|title=Enhancing context sensitivity of the Triple Helix model: An institutional logics perspective|last=Yuzhuo Cai|date=10 July 2013|website=Triple Helix Conference|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, according to critics, the triple helix model is not a relevant policy making tool for developing countries where at least one of these conditions is missing. Further scholarly criticism of the model focuses on the conditions that enable the implementation of a triple helix innovation policy. It argues that Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff’s model is too vague and take for granted those necessary preconditions within their model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.triplehelixassociation.org/helice/volume-4-2015/helice-issue-4/triple-helix-scientific-news/enabling-conditions-for-regional-triple-helix-systems|title=Enabling conditions for regional triple helix systems|last=Cai, Yuzhuo; Ough, Rihannon; Liu, Cui|date=|website=Triple Helix Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Logan D.

'''William Ellwood Heinecke''' ({{lang-th|วิลเลียม เอ็ลล์วู๊ด ไฮเน็ค}}; born 1949) is an American-born [[Thailand|Thai]] businessman. He is the CEO and Chairman of [[Minor Corporation]], the CEO and Chairman of [[Minor International]], and Chairman of [[Minor Food Group]].&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2009/1005/thailand-richest-09-william-heinecke-excellent-adventure.html|first=Ron|last=Gluckman|title=Bill's Excellent Adventure|work=Forbes Asia Magazine|date=2009-10-05|accessdate=2013-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Heinecke moved to Bangkok in 1963 at age 14 with his family, having previously lived in Japan, Hong Kong and Malaysia. Heinecke's father spent 25 years in the United States military, serving in [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]]. When he retired, he joined the foreign service. His mother was an Asia correspondent for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. Heinecke studied at the [[International School Bangkok]],&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; and persuaded the editor of the now defunct [[Bangkok World]] to let him write a weekly column on [[go-carting]]. In return, he received advertising space alongside it.&lt;ref name="EscapeArtist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.escapeartist.com/efam18/Expats_In_Asia.html|first=Harold|last=Stephens|title=Expats In Asia: Bill Heinecke, Entrepreneur Extraordianaire|work=Escape Artist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 17, while still a high school student, Heinecke took over from the Bangkok World's advertising manager.&lt;ref name="EscapeArtist"/&gt; One year later, he founded Inter-Asian Enterprise, to supply office cleaning services, and Inter-Asian Publicity, a radio advertising company, using US$1,200 he had borrowed{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. He later sold Inter-Asia Publicity to [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]]. In 1967, he founded Minor Holdings, which would over the next four decades would grow into The Minor Group, including more than 30 companies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wharton"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.whartonhcmc08.com/bio-heinecke.html|title=Speaker Biography: William Heinecke|publisher=Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|date=2008-05-30|accessdate=2013-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heinecke had his first hotel venture in 1978, the Royal Garden Resort in [[Pattaya]]. His business ventures have included advertising agencies and other hotels in [[Bangkok]], [[Hua Hin]], [[Phuket (city)|Phuket]], [[Chiang Mai]], [[Chiang Rai]] as well as outside of Thailand. He also introduced American-style fast foods to Thailand in the late 1970s and 1980s – brands like [[Mister Donut]], [[The Pizza Company]] and [[Burger King]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Heinecke naturalized as a [[Thai nationality law|Thai citizen]] in 1991, [[renunciation of United States citizenship|renouncing United States citizenship]] in the process.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wharton"/&gt; He was the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Thailand and sat on the Prime Minister’s Foreign Investment Advisory Council. He is a supporter of the Thai Elephant Conservation Centre, and authored ''The Entrepreneur'', which has been translated into a number of languages.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

'''William Henry Peter Barber''' (10 September 1857 – 15 January 1943) was a New Zealand [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Newtown (New Zealand electorate)|Newtown]] in [[Wellington]].

==Early life and family==
Born in Wellington in 1857, Barber was educated at St Peter's School.  He began work in his father's dyeing firm of Barber and Company, and eventually became its head.

William Barber represented the [[Wellington]] electorate of [[Newtown (New Zealand electorate)|Newtown]] for the whole of its existence, from [[New Zealand general election, 1902|1902]] to 1908. In [[New Zealand general election, 1908|1908]] he was defeated for the reconstituted electorate of [[Wellington South (New Zealand electorate)|Wellington South]].

===New Liberal Party===
Barber was associated with the [[New Liberal Party (New Zealand)|New Liberal Party]]. His favourite idea was one shared by the other New Liberals-that the institutions of local government should be strengthened and given more scope and power. He heartily supported [[Harry Ell]]'s 1904 Municipal Corporations Bill, which provided for borough councils to hold referenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |journal = New Zealand Parliamentary Debates  
 |volume = 123 |pages = 372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barber also advocated state fire insurance, state coal mines, and the old radical favourite, reduction of taxes on the necessities of life. However, he did not favour the elective executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |journal = New Zealand Times |date = 24 November 1902|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other activities==
He served as a director of the Wellington Woollen Company (chairman at the time of his death), and chairman of directors of the Wellington Opera House Company. He was elected to the [[Wellington City Council]] in 1891 and served as a councilor for 26 years.&lt;ref name="EP obit" /&gt; He contested the [[Wellington City mayoral election, 1905|1905 Wellington City mayoral election]] and came second, beaten by [[Thomas William Hislop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=NZFL19050429.2.19.1  |work = The Free Lance |page=16 |title=Wellington City Council |date= 29 April 1905 |accessdate= 15 March 2016 | volume=V | issue=43 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the Hutt Valley Electric Power Board (retired 1933); director of Wellington Deposit and Mortgage Company; chairman of the Wellington College Board of Governors (1924–31) and a member of the Kauri Timber Royal Commission.&lt;ref name="EP obit"/&gt;
