'''Afshar''' or '''Afshari''' ({{lang-az|Əfşar türkcəsi}}, افشار تورکجه‌سی, Әфшар түркҹәси; {{lang-tr|Afşar dili or Afşarca}}) is a [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] spoken in Turkey, [[Iran]], [[Syria]], and parts of [[Afghanistan]] by the [[Afshar people]]. [[Ethnologue]] lists it as a dialect of [[South Azerbaijani language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijani, South|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/azb|website=Ethnologue|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better|date=February 2017}}

Afshar is distinguished by a large number of loanwords from [[Persian language|Persian]] and a rounding of the phoneme {{IPA|/a/}} to {{IPA|[ɒ]}}, as occurred in Uzbek. In many cases, vowels that are rounded in Azerbaijani are not rounded in Afshar. An example of this is {{IPA|/jiz/}} (meaning ''100''), which is {{IPA|/jyz/}} in standard Azerbaijani.

APC research has shown that Apple is Americans' favorite pie, that 59% of Americans consider pie an appropriate late-night snack, and that 20% of Americans have eaten an entire pie.&lt;ref name=funfacts&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.piecouncil.org/pdf/Pie_Fun_Facts.pdf |title=Pie Fun Facts |publisher=American Pie Council |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Pie Day ===
[[File:National Pie Day 2014 poster.jpg|thumb|2014 National Pie Day/''Labor Day'' tie-in poster]]
National Pie Day, which is held annually on January 23, is now sponsored by the APC since 1986.&lt;ref name=APC1/&gt; The holiday was started in the mid-1970s by Boulder, Colorado teacher [[Charlie Papazian]]&lt;ref name=denverpost&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.denverpost.com/lifestyles/ci_24976278/national-pie-day-colorado-born-holiday | title = National Pie Day: A Colorado-born holiday | date = January 23, 2014 | work = [[The Denver Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; after he declared his birthday to be National Pie Day.&lt;ref name=dallasnews&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20110121-sunday-is-national-pie-day-when-pie-takes-center-stage.ece | title = Sunday is National Pie Day, when pie takes center stage | first = Eric | last = Aasen | date = January 21, 2012 | work = [[The Dallas Morning News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This should not be confused with [[Pi Day]] which the U.S. Congress recognizes as March 14.

In 2014, the APC partnered with [[Paramount Pictures]] in promoting the romantic thriller film ''[[Labor Day (film)|Labor Day]]'' in conjunction with National Pie Day.&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/labor-day-national-pie-day-1201059145/ |title='Labor Day' Partners with American Pie Council for National Pie Day |date=January 15, 2014 |work=Variety |accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A pie-making scene features prominently in the film, and the film's general release was within a few days of National Pie Day.)

The APC distributed a promotional poster to pie shops and bakeries featuring images of the film's stars [[Kate Winslet]], [[Josh Brolin]], and [[Gattlin Griffith]] in the pie-making scene. ''[[New York Post]]'' writer Lou Lumenick noted dryly that the scene was an "eccentric choice for a promotion" since Brolin's character is an escaped murderer and "before they all make pies together, he abducts them from a supermarket and ties both of them up... A bond does emerge between Brolin and his hostages before he surrenders to police. But still." The poster is captioned in part "It makes the time we spend together, just a little sweeter. Pie. Grab a slice of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2014/01/15/poster-celebrates-make-a-pie-with-a-murderer-day/ |title=Poster celebrates 'Make a Pie With a Murderer Day' |author=Lou Lumenick |date=January 15, 2014 |work=New York Post |accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(Notwithstanding any problematic overtones, though, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'''s take on the scene was "What damage [the 1999 film] ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' did for the pie industry, ''Labor Day'' has reversed.")&lt;ref name=variety/&gt;

Like most communities of the [[Armenian Diaspora]], the [[Armenians in Cyprus|Armenian-Cypriot community]] is predominantly [[Armenian Apostolic]] (about 95%). Some 5% belong either to the [[Armenian Evangelical Church]], the [[Armenian Catholic Church]], the [[Latin Church]], the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], the [[Anglican Church]], the [[Plymouth Brethren|Plymouth Brethren Church]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] or they are [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]; of this 5%, historically the most significant groups have been [[Armenian Evangelical Church|Armenian Evangelicals]], who in the 1940s and 1950s comprised about 10% of the Armenian-Cypriot community, and [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian-Catholics]], who have been on the island since the time of the [[Crusades]].

==Armenian Apostolic Church==
[[File:Armenian Prelature building in Nicosia.jpg|thumb|left|The building of the Armenian Prelature of Cyprus in [[Strovolos]], [[Nicosia]]]]

The [[Armenian Diocese of Cyprus|Armenian Prelature of Cyprus]] (''Առաջնորդարան Հայոց Կիպրոսի'') was established in 973 by Catholicos [[Khachig I of Armenia|Khatchig I]] and ever since it has maintained a continuous presence on the island. In the years that followed, some of its Prelates participated in important church synods, such as Tateos (who participated in the Council of [[Rumkale|Hromkla]] in 1179), Nigoghaos (who participated in the Synod of [[Sis (Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia)|Sis]] in 1307) and Krikor (who participated in a conference of Greek Orthodox Bishops in Cyprus in 1340). The antiquity of the Armenian Church in Cyprus was confirmed by a bull of [[Pope Leo X]], which was issued in 1519 after multiple discords, according to which the Armenian Prelate would be senior to and take precedence over the [[Maronite Church|Maronite]], [[Jacobite Church|Jacobite]] and [[Coptic Church|Coptic]] Prelates.

Historically, the Prelature has been under the jurisdiction of the [[Holy See of Cilicia|Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia]], while today it is the oldest ''[[diocese|theme]]'' that falls under its jurisdiction. In the past, for various reasons, it was at times under the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem]] (1775–1799, 1812–1837, 1848–1861, 1865–1877, 1888–1897, 1898–1908), the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople]] (1799–1812, 1861–1864, 1877–1888, 1897–1898, 1908–1921), even the [[Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin|Catholicosate of Etchmiadzin]] (1864–1865). Cyprus was the place of refuge for two exile Patriarchs of Constantinople, Archbishop Tavit Areveltsi (1644-1648) and Senior Archimandrite Krikor Basmadjian (1773-1775). The current Prelate, a Catholicosal Vicar General, is as of 2014 '''''Archbishop Nareg Alemezian'''''. The parish priest in [[Nicosia]] is '''''Fr. Momik Habeshian''''' (since 2000), while the parish priest in [[Larnaca]] and [[Limassol]] is '''''Fr. Mashdots Ashkarian''''' (since 1992).

For centuries, the Prelature building was located within the Armenian compound in Victoria street in walled Nicosia; when that area was taken over by Turkish-Cypriot extremists in 1963–1964, the Prelature was temporarily housed in Aram Ouzounian street (1964–1968) and, later on, in Kyriakos Matsis street in [[Ayios Dhometios]] (1968–1984). Thanks to the efforts of Bishop Zareh Aznavorian and with financial aid from the [[Evangelical Church of Westphalia]], the new Prelature building was erected in 1983, next to the [[Sourp Asdvadzadzin|Virgin Mary]] church and the Nareg school in [[Nicosia]], by architects Athos Dikaios &amp; Alkis Dikaios; it was officially inaugurated on 4 March 1984, during the pastoral visit of Catholicos [[Karekin I|Karekin II]]. By initiative of Archbishop [[Varoujan Hergelian]], in 1998 the basement of the building was renovated and the “Vahram Utidjian” Hall was formed; previously a store room, it became a reality from the proceeds of the auction in 1994 of the art collection that Vahram Utidjian had donated to the Prelature in 1954. It was inaugurated on 3 February 1999 by Catholicos [[Aram I]]; numerous charity, communal and cultural events take place there. The Prelature’s consistory houses a collection of ecclesiastical relics, some of which were previously in the old [[Notre Dame de Tyre|Virgin Mary]] church or the [[Sourp Magar|Magaravank]].

[[File:Armenian Ethnarchy of Cyprus.JPG|thumb|right|The Armenian Ethnarchy of Cyprus with Catholicos [[Aram I]] (2008)]]

The current Charter of the Prelature, first drafted in 1945 and ratified in 1950, consists of 102 articles and, in its present form, applies as of 3 September 2010. The administration is exercised by the '''Armenian Ethnarchy''' (''Ազգային Իշխանութիւն'') through the '''Diocesan Council''' ['''''Թեմական Ժողով''''' (''Temagan Joghov''), consisting of the Prelate, two priests and twelve elected lay persons - 7 for Nicosia, 3 for Larnaca, 1 for Limassol and 1 for Famagusta] and the '''Administrative Council''' ['''''Վարչական Ժողով''''' (''Varchagan Joghov''), presided by the Prelate and consisting of seven lay persons appointed by the Temagan], currently chaired by '''''Sebouh Tavitian''''' (as of 2007) and '''''John Guevherian''''' (as of 2011), respectively. As of 1998, the elected Representative is ''ex officio'' a member of the Diocesan Council. There are also the '''''local parish committees''''' (''թաղական հոգաբարձութիւններ'', one in [[Sourp Asdvadzadzin|Nicosia]], one in [[Sourp Stepanos|Larnaca]] and one in [[Sourp Kevork|Limassol]]), the '''''committee for Christian instruction''''' (''Քրիստոնէական դաստիարակութեան յանձնախումբ'') and the '''''Ladies’ committee''''' (''Տիկնանց յանձնախումբ''). Under the committee for Christian instruction are the '''''Sunday schools''''' (''Կիրակնօրեայ վարժարաններ'') and the '''''youth committee''''' (''երիտասարդական յանձնախումբ'').

According to the '''Decision of the Council of Ministers 66.589/19–12–2007''', the Armenian Prelature of Cyprus receives an annual grant of €59.800 by the [[Republic of Cyprus]]; the Republic also pays the salaries of the Prelature's clergy and covers their medical and health care ('''Decision of the Council of Ministers 48.166/22–07–1998'''). The same arrangements apply for the Maronite Archbishopric of Cyprus and the Latin Vicariate of Cyprus (the latter, however, receives an annual grant of €51.260).

==Armenian Evangelical Church==

The first [[Armenian Evangelical Church|Armenian Evangelicals]] in Cyprus came after the arrival of the [[United Kingdom|British]] in July 1878. As they were not committed, and very few, they quickly became associated with the ''Mother Church'' ([[Armenian Apostolic Church]]), such as Apisoghom Utidjian, the official state documents translator - and the son of Stepan Utidjian, one the original founders of the [[Armenian Evangelical Church]] -, who served as Chairman of the Nicosia parish council for 30 years. With the influx of more [[Protestants]], [[Armenian Evangelical Church|Armenian Evangelicals]] became affiliated with the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America|Reformed Presbyterian Church]] as early as 1887. Although the main centres were Nicosia and [[Larnaca]], gatherings were occasionally held in [[Limassol]], [[Famagusta]] and [[Pano Amiantos|Amiandos]]. In [[Larnaca]], gatherings were held at the Reformed Presbyterian Mission church (built in 1892 and re-built in 1901–1902). In Nicosia, gatherings were initially held at the [[Reformed_Presbyterian_Church_of_North_America#Missions|Reformed Presbyterian Mission]] church (built in 1906–1907), until [[Armenian Evangelical Church|Armenian Evangelicals]] built their own church in 1946–1947 behind the old [[American Academy Nicosia|American Academy]] building, near the [[Arabahmet Mosque|Arab Ahmed Pasha mosque]]; its foundation stone was laid on 28 July 1946 by pastor Yohanna der Megerditchian, who dedicated it on 1 June 1947. The building was renovated in 1955, while a kitchen was added in 1959.

In 1933, the newly formed Cyprus Synod of the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America|Reformed Presbyterian Church]] divided its congregations into Armenian and Greek councils. Armenian Evangelicals were granted provisional autonomy from the [[Reformed_Presbyterian_Church_of_North_America#Missions|Reformed Presbyterian Mission]] in 1954, which was formalised in 1962. In [[Larnaca]], as [[Armenian Evangelical Church|Armenian Evangelicals]] dwindled after the [[Cypriot intercommunal violence#1963 Turkish self-segregation|inter-communal troubles of 1963–1964]], services were no longer held; in Nicosia, the Armenian Evangelical church was taken over by [[Turkish Cypriots|Turkish-Cypriot]] extremists during the [[Cypriot intercommunal violence#1963 Turkish self-segregation|1963–1964 inter-communal troubles]] and so services were then held at the [[American Academy Nicosia|American Academy]] chapel (built in 1955) until 1973.

After nearly 30 years of inactivity, by initiative of Nevart Kassouni-Panayiotides and Lydia Gulesserian (†) and with the help of Hrayr Jebejian, Executive Secretary of the Bible Society in the Gulf, [[Armenian Evangelical Church|Armenian Evangelicals]] were re-organised at the Greek Evangelical church in [[Larnaca]] in 2002. Since 2005, when Hrayr Jebejian moved to Cyprus, services are held every few months at the Greek Evangelical church in Nicosia. Also, the Armenian Evangelical Church organizes a few lectures in Nicosia. The following is a list of the Armenian Reverends and preachers in charge of the Armenian Evangelical community of [[Cyprus]].

==Armenian Catholic Church==
[[File:Bellapais Abbey.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bellapais Abbey]] (early 20th century)]]

[[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian-Catholics]] first came to the island during the [[Cyprus in the Middle Ages#Crusades—Lusignan Period 1191-1489|Frankish Era]] from the nearby [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]]. It is unclear whether they had their own structure during the Latin Era or if they were under the Latin Church of Cyprus, as has been the case since the Ottoman Era. What we do know is that Armenian-Catholics used [[Church of Saint Lazarus, Larnaca|Saint Lazarus' basilica]] in [[Larnaca]], the Holy Cross church in [[Nicosia]] (probably Arablar Djami/Stavros tou Missirikou) and the Virgin Mary of the Green (de Vert) in [[Famagusta]], which was built between 1311-1317. Armenian-Catholic monks and nuns also served at the Premonstratensian [[Bellapais Abbey]] and the Benedictine [[Notre Dame de Tyre]] convent in Nicosia, respectively. The only Armenian-Catholic Bishops' names which have survived until today are George Noreghes, appointed by Latin Archbishop of Cyprus Elias de Nabineaux circa 1340, and the Dominican Julio or Julian Stavriano, who served as Bishop of the Armenians (1561-1567) and later became Bishop of the Maronites (1567-1570); he started as [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Orthodox]] and later he embraced Catholicism. The latter's flock included about 1.000 Armenians and he used Saint Sergius' church in [[Famagusta]].

During the [[Ottoman Cyprus|Ottoman Era]], there was a very limited conversion of Armenian Orthodox to [[Catholicism]], mainly due to the proselytising activities of the [[Franciscan]] mission in [[Nicosia]] and [[Larnaca]], especially during the 17th and 18th centuries; however, these must have been temporary apostasies and their number never exceeded 50 at any given time. In 1794 the small (and perhaps newly formed) Armenian Catholic community of [[Larnaca]] was granted some holy chalices from the auction of the belongings of the old [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] monastery of the town.

[[File:Holy Cross cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|The Holy Cross cathedral in [[Nicosia]] (early 20th century)]]

It was during the [[British Cyprus (1878–1960)|British Era]] that the Armenian-Catholic community increased in number, due to the arrival of a large number of refugees from the [[Armenian Genocide]] (1915-1923). In 1931, there were about 200 Armenian-Catholics in Cyprus, rather poor, and many of them were middle-aged. Most of them became attached to the Latin places of worship, especially the Holy Cross cathedral in [[Nicosia]] and Saint Joseph's convent in [[Larnaca]]; between 1921-1923, the latter housed a small Armenian-Catholic school, run by Abbot Jean Kouyoumdjian - who served at the convent between 1921-1928. There was also another Armenian-Catholic cleric, Archimandrite Arsène Khorassandjian, who also served in [[Larnaca]] (and, at times, at the Holy Cross cathedral and the [[Terra Santa College|Terra Santa school]] in [[Nicosia]]), between 1931-1959.

In 1960, there were less than 100 Armenian-Catholics. However, their number decreased in the following years, due to emigration to other countries and assimilation with the Armenian-Cypriot, the Latin-Cypriot and/or the Greek-Cypriot community. However, due to the influx of [[Armenians in Lebanon|Lebanese-Armenians]] to Cyprus since the mid-1970s, there has been a small increase in the number of Armenian-Catholics on the island. Currently, local Armenian-Catholics are less than 20, in addition to about 30 foreign Armenians.

==Places of worship==
There are five [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian churches]], two in the capital [[Nicosia]] (one under Turkish occupation since 1964) and one in each [[Larnaca]], [[Limassol]] and [[Famagusta]]; the latter has been occupied by the Turks since 1964. Additionally, there are three Armenian chapels in the vicinity of Nicosia and one within the [[Sourp Magar|Magaravank]] complex, the latter under also under Turkish occupation since 1974. There is also an [[Armenian Evangelical Church|Armenian Evangelical church]] in Nicosia (under Turkish occupation since 1964). Finally, there is the renowned [[Sourp Magar|Magaravank]], under Turkish occupation since 1974.

===[[Nicosia]]===
[[File:Sourp Asdvadzadzin.JPG|thumb|right|[[Sourp Asdvadzadzin|Virgin Mary]] church in [[Strovolos]], [[Nicosia]]]]

The building of the Armenian Prelature of Cyprus and the [[Sourp Asdvadzadzin|Virgin Mary]] [Սուրբ Աստուածածին (Sourp Asdvadzadzin)] cathedral are located in Armenia street in [[Strovolos]], [[Nicosia]]. The Prelature building was built between 1983–1984 by architects Athos Dikaios &amp; Alkis Dikaios and was inaugurated on 4 March 1984 by Catholicos [[Karekin II of Cilicia]]. The Prelature's consistory houses a collection of ecclesiastical relics, some of which were previously kept at the [[Sourp Magar|Magaravank]] or the old [[Notre Dame de Tyre|Virgin Mary]] church; the relics are kept at a display case, donated in 1986 by brothers Garabed and Nshan Arakchindjian. The Prelature's basement is the “Vahram Utidjian” Hall, which was inaugurated on 3 February 1999 by Catholicos [[Aram I]]. The hall, previously a store room, became a reality thanks to the initiative of Archbishop [[Varoujan Hergelian]], using proceeds from the auction in 1994 of the art collection that Vahram Utidjian had donated to the Prelature in 1954. It is one of the main venues for events of the Armenian-Cypriot community. Together with the [[Sourp Asdvadzadzin|Virgin Mary]] church and the [[Nicosia Armenian school|Nareg Armenian School]], the land was granted ''in trust'' to the community on 16 December 1966 by the government; on 10 December 1979, [[Strovolos]] Improvement Board decided to rename the road in front of the plot of land from “Cyclops street” to “Armenia street”, as a gesture of solidarity to the Armenian people. A freehold title deed on the land was granted on 31 March 1983.

The [[Sourp Asdvadzadzin|Virgin Mary]] cathedral was built between 1976–1981 by architects Iacovos &amp; Andreas Philippou, with financial help from the [[World Council of Churches]], the [[Evangelical Church of Westphalia]], the [[Republic of Cyprus]], the [[Church of Cyprus|Holy Archbishopric of Cyprus]] and the faithful. Located next to [[Nicosia Armenian school|Nareg Elementary School]], its foundation stone was laid on 25 September 1976 by Archbishop [[Makarios III]] and Bishop Nerses Pakhdigian. On 16 April 1978, the Co-adjutor Catholicos [[Karekin I|Karekin II]] blessed the 16 columns of the church, while the inauguration and consecration of the cathedral took place on 22 November 1981 by Catholicos [[Khoren I Paroian|Khoren I]] and his Co-adjutor [[Karekin I|Karekin II]]. It is the only church in Cyprus built in a traditional Armenian style, with a central octagonal dome and a smaller dome for the bell. The church was renovated externally in late 2005 in memory of the Tutundjian family, killed in the [[Helios Airways Flight 522|Helios air accident]], while the belfry was also repaired that year, in memory of archpriest der Vazken Sandrouni.&lt;ref name="Gibrahayer5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gibrahayer.com/index.php5?&amp;page_id=185&amp;path=195,185|title=Sourp Asdvadzadzin in Nicosia is 30 years old|date=April 2012|accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liturgies are held every Sunday. The church celebrates on the nearest Sunday to 21 November, feast day of the [[Presentation of Mary]]. The parish priest (as of 2000) is '''''Fr. Momik Habeshian'''''.

The church was renovated internally in mid–2008. Many of its icons are the work of [[Armenians in Lebanon|Lebanese-Armenian]] painter Zohrab Keshishian. It is interesting that just below the holy altar, there is a [[khachkar|khachkar (cross-stone)]] donated by the [[Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin|Holy See of Etchmiadzin]]. On top of the church's entrance there is a marble inscription in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] reading: 

&lt;blockquote&gt; '''Կառուցաւ սուրբ եկեղեցիս յանուն Սրբուհւոյ Աստուածածնին ի հայրապետութեան Տ. Տ. Խորենայ Ա. Կաթողիկոսի եւ Աթոռակցի Նորին Տ. Տ. Գարեգին Բ. Կաթողիկոսի եւ յառաջնորդութեան Տ.

On the two columns facing the entrance are the following two aluminium commemorative plaques in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Նորոգեցաւ զանգակատունս ի յիշատակ Տ. Վազգէն Ա. Քհնյ. Սանտրունիի 2005''' ''(This belltower was renovated in memory of Archpriest Der Vazken Sandrouni 2005)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Նորոգեցաւ եկեղեցիս ի յիշատակ Յակոբ, Հիլտա, Արա, Պարէթ Թիւթիւնճեանի 2005''' ''(This church was renovated in memory of Hagop, Hilda, Ara, Baret Tutundjian 2005)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the side of the church there is a marble inscription in [[Greek language|Greek]] reading: 

&lt;blockquote&gt; '''Ο ιερός ούτος ναός της Παναγίας των Αρμενίων εθεμελιώθη υπό της Α. Μ. του Προέδρου της Κυπριακής Δημοκρατίας Αρχιεπισκόπου Μακαρίου Γ' την 25ην Σεπτεμβρίου 1976''' (''The foundation of this holy temple of the Mother of God of the Armenians was laid by H. B. the President of the Republic of Cyprus Archbishop Makarios III on 25 September 1976'') &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In front of the church's entrance is a white marble [[khachkar]] (cross-stone) dedicated to the eternal friendship of Armenians and Greeks in Cyprus; it was unveiled on 21 October 2001 by Presidential Commissioner Manolis Christophides. To the side of the church's entrance is the bronze bust of Archbishop Zareh Aznavorian; it was unveiled on 1 May 2005 by [[Armenians in Italy|Italian-Armenian]] donator Aleco Bezigian. Finally, in the coutryard of the church is the white marble [[Armenian Genocide Monument in Nicosia|Armenian Genocide Monument]]; it was unveiled on 24 April 1991 by Senior Archimandrite Yeghishe Madjikian. In 2000, two white marble [[ossuaries]] were built in front of it, as well as five small sandstone [[khachkar]]-like columns.

In the old Armenian cemetery, near the [[Ledra Palace]] hotel (Markos Drakos Avenue), there is the [[Sourp Boghos|Saint Paul]] [Սուրբ Պօղոս (Sourp Boghos)] chapel, built in 1892 by donation of Boghos Odadjian. Left unused since the [[Cypriot intercommunal violence#1963 Turkish self segregation|1963–1964 intercommunal troubles]], the chapel and the cemetery fell into disuse. It was restored between 2008–2009, together with the rest of the cemetery, by initiative of Representative [[Vartkes Mahdessian]] and the Armenian Ethnarchy of Cyprus. A Liturgy is held once a year since 2010. On top of the chapel's entrance there is a marble inscription in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] reading: 

&lt;blockquote&gt; '''Կառուցաւ ս. տաճարս  'ի հիմանց յանուն Ս. Առաքելոցն Պօղոսի արդեամբ բարեպաշտ Օտաճեան Պօղոսի Կ. Պօլսեցւոյ. Յամի Տ՟ռն 1892''' (''This holy temple was constructed from its foundations by the name of the Holy Apostle Paul by commission of the pious Constantinopolitan Odadjian Boghos in the Lord's Year 1892'') &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Behind it, from inside the chapel, there is another marble inscription in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] reading: 

&lt;blockquote&gt; '''Կառուցաւ մատուռս արդեամբ Օտաճեան Պօպոսի, մասնակցութեամբ արկեղ Եկեղեցւոյ Հայոց ազգի, Յ' Առաջնորդութեամբ Տ.

In the Armenian cemetery near [[Ayios Dhometios]] (Gregoris Afxentiou Avenue) there is the [[Sourp Haroutiun|Holy Resurrection]] [Սուրբ Յարութիւն (Sourp Haroutiun)] chapel, built in 1938 by donation of Haroutiun Bohdjalian and consecrated in 1949 by Bishop Ghevont Chebeyan. Left unused since the 1974 Turkish invasion, it was renovated in 2010. No Liturgies have been held since 1974. On top of its entrance, there is a marble inscription in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] reading: 

&lt;blockquote&gt; '''Ս. Յարութիւն: Շինեցաւ Ս. Յարութիւն մատուռս արդեամբ Տիար Յարութիւն Պօհճալեանի ի յիշատակ իւր եւ իւր ննջեցելոց 1938:''' (''Holy Resurrection. This Holy resurrection chapel was built by commission of Mr Haroutiun Bohdjalian in memory of him and his deceased 1938.'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the lower part of the southern wall, there is the following well-known inscription in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Մահուամբ զմահ կոխեաց եւ Յարութեամբն Իւրով մեզ զկեանս պարգեւեաց''' ''(He trampled death with death and through His Resurrection He granted us life)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finally, the [[Sourp Amenapergitch|Holy Saviour of All]] [Սուրբ Ամենափրկիչ (Sourp Amenapergitch)] chapel was built between 1995–1996 by architects Athos &amp; Alkis Dikaios and by donation of Aram and Bedros Kalaydjian. Located in Corinth street in [[Strovolos]], [[Nicosia]], within the premises of the Kalaydjian Rest Home for the Elderly, its foundation stone was laid on 15 December 1995 by the Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia, [[Aram I]], who inaugurated it on 16 February 1997.&lt;ref name="Hadjilyras-2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hayk.net/docs/The_Armenians_of_Cyprus.pdf|title=Book The Armenians of Cyprus|last=Hadjilyra|first=Alexander-Michael|date=May 2009|publisher=Kalaydjian Foundation|accessdate=16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matins are held regularly. On top of its entrance, there is a marble inscription in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] reading: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Սուրբ Ամենափրկիչ մատուռ''' (''Holy Saviour of All chapel'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===[[Larnaca]]===

[[File:Stepanos church.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sourp Stepanos|Saint Stephen]]'s church in [[Larnaca]]]]

The church of [[Sourp Stepanos|Saint Stephen]] [Սուրբ Ստեփանոս (Sourp Stepanos)], in Armenian church street in the city centre, was originally built as a chapel by the Armenian refugees who came to [[Larnaca]] after the [[Adana massacre]] in 1909. It was built as a replica of [[Adana]]'s main church and was dedicated to [[Adana]]'s patron Saint, [[Saint Stephen]]. However, as most of the refugees returned, the chapel was left unfinished. After a fund-raising which started on 24 October 1912, the small chapel became a church, whose construction finished on 1 April 1913.

Dedicated to the memory of the martyrs of the [[Adana massacre]], it is the first monument in the entire [[Armenian Diaspora]] in memory of the Armenian massacres in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. On top of the church's façade there is a commemorative composition featuring the Armenian ethnarch [[Hayk|Haig]], the last King of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]], [[Leo V, King of Armenia|Levon V]], a scroll held by a hand - representing the [[Ten Commandments]] - and the four symbols of the [[Four Evangelists]]; around King [[Leo V, King of Armenia|Levon V]], there is a commemorative inscription in Armenian: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Ի Յիշատակ Կիլիկիոյ Նահատակաց – 1 Ապր. 1909''' ''(In Memory of the Cilician Martyrs – 1 April 1909)''&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

while under the composition and above the entrance it reads: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Հայկական Մատուռ''' ''(Armenian Chapel)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The church was inaugurated on 20 May 1914 by Senior Archimandrite Serovpe Samvelian and was consecrated on 30 June 1918 by Archbishop Taniel Hagopian. Until the early 1940s, there was a small octagonal dome on top of the church. The church was renovated between 1956–1957 and again in 1998. Liturgies are held every other Sunday, in turns with [[Sourp Kevork|Saint George]]'s church in [[Limassol]]. The church celebrates on 25 December, feast day of [[Saint Stephen]]. The parish priest (as of 1992) is '''''Fr. Mashdots Ashkarian'''''. To the left and the right of the entrance, there are two marble inscriptions in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]: to the left, the inscription reads: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Կառուցաւ մատուռս Յամի Տեառն 1909''' ''(This chapel was constructed in the Lord's Year 1909)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and to the right, the inscription reads: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Նորոգեցաւ մատուռս Յամի Տեառն 1998''' ''(This chapel was renovated in the Lord's Year 1998)''&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Many of the church's icons are the work of [[Armenians in Lebanon|Lebanese-Armenian]] painter Fr. Hovsep Ashkarian.

===[[Limassol]]===

[[File:Sourp Kevork, Limassol.jpg|thumb|The church of Sourp Kevork in [[Limassol]]]]

The church of [[Sourp Kevork|Saint George]] [Սուրբ Գէորգ (Sourp Kevork)] is built in Vassilis Michaelides street near the city centre, on land donated circa 1935 by Satenig Soultanian, in memory of her father-in-law, Kevork. As the small Armenian community of [[Limassol]] could not afford to build a church, a theatre company was formed under Ardashes Bastadjian, giving performances in [[Nicosia]], [[Larnaca]] and [[Limassol]]. Together with a contribution by the Armenian Prelature of Cyprus and Stepan Kavafian, the church was built between 1939–1940, while its consecration took place on 11 April 1948 by Bishop Ghevont Chebeyian. The church was renovated between 1975–1976, in 2007 and again in 2015, while in 1989 its bell was made electronic by donation of brothers Garabed and Nshan Arakchindjian. Liturgies are held every other Sunday, in turns with [[Sourp Stepanos|Saint Stephen]]'s church in [[Larnaca]]. The church celebrates on the last Sunday of September, feast day of [[Saint George]]. The parish priest (as of 1992) is '''''Fr. Mashdots Ashkarian'''''. During the 1975–1976 renovation, the belltower was placed on top of the entrance, while an iron [[Armenian cross]] was added during the 2006 renovation, with the inscription in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] reading: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Սուրբ Գէորգ եկեղեցի''' ''(Saint George's church)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the lower part of the wall outside the repository, where the belltower used to be, there is another marble inscription in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. It reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Նուիրեցաւ ելեկտրական կոչնակս արդեամբ եւ ծախիւք եղբարցն Կարապետ եւ Նշան Արագչինճեանոց Տիգրանակերտցի ի թուին Քս.ի 1989-ի''' ''(This electric rattle was offered by commission and expenses of brothers Garabed and Nshan Arakchindjian from Dikranagerd in the year of Christ 1989)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In front of the church is a dark brown [[tuff]] stone [[khachkar]] (cross-stone), donated by the Arakelyan family; it was unveiled by Archbishop [[Varoujan Hergelian]] on 28 September 2008. Next to the church is the [[Limassol Armenian school]].

===Turkish-occupied areas===



====[[Nicosia]]====

The old [[Notre Dame de Tyre|Virgin Mary]] [Սուրբ Աստուածածին (Sourp Asdvadzadzin)] cathedral in Victoria street, currently in the Turkish-occupied part of the walled city of [[Nicosia]] near Paphos Gate, also known as Notre Dame de Tyre or Tortosa, was originally a Benedictine/Carthusian Abbey built between 1308–1310, on the site of an older church which had originally been built in 1116 and was destroyed by an earthquake in 1303, where Armenian-Catholic nuns served. Sometime before 1504 it passed into the hands of the Armenian Prelature of Cyprus and it used to be the centre of the Armenian community of Cyprus until it was captured, along with the rest of the Armenian quarter, by Turkish-Cypriot extremists during the [[Cypriot_intercommunal_violence#1963_Turkish_self_segregation|1963–1964 Turkish-Cypriot mutiny]] and occupied by Turkey during the [[Turkish invasion|1974 Turkish invasion]]. After the Osmanian occupation of Cyprus in 1570, it was temporarily used as a salt store, until it was returned to the Armenian community by a [[firman]] in May 1571; the Armenian ownership of the church was further confirmed by another [[firman]] in May 1614. During the period of the [[Armenian Genocide]], many persecuted Armenian refugees sought shelter on its verandah. It was located next to the old Prelature building, the Melikian-Ouzounian school, the Armenian Genocide monument and the Melikian family mansion. 

[[File:Asdvadzadzin 2005.jpg|thumb|left|The old [[Notre Dame de Tyre|Virgin Mary]] church in old [[Nicosia]] prior to its restoration]]

During the centuries it served the small yet prosperous Armenian community of Nicosia, the church underwent various modifications: in 1688 it was renovated, in 1788 the baptistery was constructed, in 1858 the arches of the northern verandah were built, in 1860 the belfry was constructed - amongst the first in Ottoman Cyprus, a donation by Hapetig Nevrouzian of Constantinople -, in 1884 it was restored, in 1904 the roof was re-built and a renovation took place, in 1945 the upper tier was erected for the choir (by donation of Aram Ouzounian), in 1950 the belfry was restored, while in 1960-1961 the Antiquities Department installed a new floor - after removing the mediaeval tombstones that were previously covered by the carpets. The church celebrated on the nearest Sunday to 21 November, feast day of the [[Presentation of Mary]].

After its illegal occupation in January 1964, it was used as barracks for the Turkish-Cypriot militia, while after its illegal occupation by the Turkish army in July 1974 it continued to be used as barracks for Turkish soldiers, until it suffered further damages by an earthquake in 1998. The site was abandoned and illegal Anatolian settlers inhabited the place until late 2006. 

In 2005, the [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]] carried out a preliminary study for the potential restoration of the entire compound, while in 2007 it conducted a feasibility study. Heavily desecrated, its restoration finally started in October 2009 by initiative of the Armenian Ethnarchy of Cyprus and the Armenian Representative, [[Vartkes Mahdessian]]. The works were carried out by the [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP-ACT]], with partial funding from [[USAID]], and were completed in November 2012.&lt;ref name="PIO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/pio/pio.nsf/All/DBF419D7DF6CC18EC2256FCE00331E37?OpenDocument|title=Factsheet on the Armenians|last=PIO|date=May 2010|accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nicosia Armenian Evangelical.jpg|thumb|right|The old Armenian Evangelical church in old [[Nicosia]]]]

There was also a small Armenian Evangelical church, located in Mahmoud Pasha street, in the Turkish-occupied part of the walled city of [[Nicosia]] - behind the old American Academy building, near the [[Arabahmet Mosque|Arab Ahmed mosque]]. Prior to its erection, [[Armenian Evangelical Church|Armenian Evangelicals]] used to worship God at the Reformed Presbyterian church on Apostolos Varnavas street, opposite the old Powerhouse and behind the building of the Holy Archbishopric of Cyprus. The church - a vision already since the early 1930s - was eventually built thanks to the initiative of pastor Yohanna Der Megerditchian, with the financial contribution of the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America|Reformed Presbyterian Church]] and the Armenian Evangelical faithful; its architect was Dickran H. Davidian. Its foundation stone was laid on 28 July 1946 by pastor Yohanna der Megerditchian, who dedicated it on 1 July 1947. On the lower part of the right wall to the side of the entrance there is the following inscription in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Էփեսացիս Բ:20 - 28 Յուլիս 1946 Նիկոսիա''' ''(Ephesians 2:20–28 July 1946 Nicosia)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The church was renovated in 1955, the year when the border fence and the gate were erected; in 1959 a kitchen was added. Unfortunately, during the [[Cypriot intercommunal violence#1963_Turkish self-segregation|1963–1964 intercommunal troubles]], the church was taken over by extremist Turkish-Cypriots. Between 1964-1974, the church and the surrounding buildings were used as a school for some time and then as the main military headquarters (sancaktarlık). After that, for a long time the buildings remained empty. Later on, the church was used as a Turkish folk music centre (1987-1997) and as Handicrafts Co-Operative (1997-2011); as of 2011 it is used as a music centre. As with the old [[Notre Dame de Tyre|Virgin Mary]] church, no Services have been held since 1964.&lt;ref name="Hadjilyras-2"/&gt;

====[[Famagusta]]====



The church of [[Ganchvor monastery|Ganchvor]] [Սուրբ Աստուածածին Կանչուոր (Sourp Asdvadzadzin Ganchvor) or Virgin Mary the Caller] was probably built in 1346 by Armenian refugees who escaped the Mameluke attacks against [[Ayas, Adana|Ayas]] of Cilicia. It is located between Kışla and Server Somuncuoğlu streets, in the north-western part of the walled city of [[Famagusta]] (next to the Carmelite church) and it is believed it was a part of an important monastic, cultural and theological establishment, at which Saint [[Nerses of Lambron]] is said to have studied, and whose foundations survived until the mid-20th century. A [[scriptorium]] used to operate in this monastery, manuscripts of which survive at the Armenian [[Cathedral of St. James, Jerusalem|Saint James’ Monastery]] in [[Jerusalem]].
 
It is unknown when exactly it ceased being used, however it possibly stopped operating already since the mid-Venetian Era. Up until at least 1862, there was a small bell-tower. Unused for more than three and a half centuries, because of Ottoman restrictions, in 1907 it was declared an ancient monument, based on '''''Colonial Antiquities’ Law IV/1905'''''. In the same year, it was repaired by the Antiquities Department, as it was in 1931. In 1932 it was restored, also by the Antiquities Department, which significantly repaired it between 1937-1944 (under the care of Theophilus Mogabgab, Director of Antiquities for Famagusta District), after it was leased to the Armenian Prelature of Cyprus on 7 March 1936, for a period of 99 years - which was achieved after the intervention of Co-adjutor Catholicos of Cilicia, [[Babken I of Cilicia|Papken Gulesserian]], who had visited the church in 1934, and Archbishop [[Bedros IV of Cilicia|Bedros Saradjian]].

[[File:Ganchvor-Carmelite church.jpg|thumb|right|The Carmelite church and Ganchvor church]]

The first Liturgy and its re-consecration were held on 14 January 1945 by Archimandrite Krikor Bahlavouni (also known as “Topal Vartabed”). On 8 March 1957 it was partially burnt by [[Turkish Cypriots|Turkish-Cypriots]], but continued to be used as a church until 1962; since then, the [[Famagusta]] Armenian community used the church of Ayia Paraskevi, which the Holy Archbishopric of Cyprus granted. The church celebrated on the nearest Sunday to 15 August, feast day of the [[Dormition of the Mother of God]]. In January 1964 it was taken by extremist [[Turkish Cypriots|Turkish-Cypriots]] during the [[Cypriot intercommunal violence#1963 Turkish self-segregation|1963–1964 Turkish-Cypriot mutiny]] and was occupied by [[Turkey]] in August 1974 during the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|1974 Turkish invasion]]. Between 1964-1974, it was used as a residence, despite attempts by the Swedish Contingent (SWEDCON) of [[UNFICYP]] and others to make other arrangements for the residing family. During the 1974-2005 period, the year in which it was declassified from a “military area”, it was used as a stable and a store room. Until 1974, there were beautiful frescoes on the walls, which today have disappeared. It has been left at the mercy of nature and vandals and it is in need of repairs. No Liturgies have been held since 1964.&lt;ref name="Hadjilyras-2"/&gt;

The Armenian Orthodox church of the Virgin Mary of Ganchvor should not be confused with the Armenian-Catholic church of Saint Mary the Green (de Vert), whose location is unknown.

====Halevga====

[[File:Magaravank-multiple.jpg|thumb|left|Multiple views of [[Sourp Magar|Magaravank]]'s interior and exterior (1940s)]]

[[File:Magaravank-1970.jpg|thumb|left|The interior of [[Sourp Magar|Magaravank]] in 1970]]

Of great importance is [[Sourp Magar|Saint Makarios]]’ [Սուրբ Մակար (Sourp Magar)] monastery [Մակարավանք (Magaravank), also known as Αρμενομονάστηρο (Greek), Ermeni Manastırı (Turkish) and Armenian Monastery (English)], located within Plataniotissa forest near Turkish-occupied Halevga, on the [[Pentadaktylos|Pentadhaktylos]] mountain range - at a height of 530 m. Its vast land (about 8.500 donums), extending up to the coast, included around 30.000 olive and carob trees, whose exploitation was the main source of income for the Armenian Prelature of Cyprus until 1974. The monastery was originally established by [[Copts]] circa 1000 AD on a location at which [[Macarius of Alexandria|Saint Macarius]] is said to have been an ascetic; his icon was believed to be miraculous and, until the early 20th century, the Armenian residents of the region - some of whom had found shelter after the [[Hamidian massacres]] (1894-1896) - believed they could hear the Saint galloping with his horse at night.

The monastery passed into the hands of the Armenians sometime before 1425. During the Latin Era, its monks were known for their strict diet, while during the [[Ottoman Cyprus|Ottoman Era]] it was known as the '''Blue Monastery ''' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: '''''Կապոյտ Վանք/Կէօք Մանասթըր''''', [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: '''''Mavi Manastır''''', [[Greek language|Greek]]: '''''Κυανούν Μοναστήρι'''''), from the colour of its doors and window blinds. For centuries, it had been a popular place of pilgrimage for Armenians and non-Armenians alike, a way station for pilgrims en route to the [[Holy Land]], as well as a place of recuperation and rest for Armenian Catholicoi and clergymen from [[Cilicia]] and [[Jerusalem]] (it was the favourite holiday resort for Catholicos [[Sahag II of Cilicia|Sahag II]], who used to ride his horse around its vast lands). Amongst its guests was Abbot [[Mekhitar of Sebaste]], who spent some time there in 1695 on his way to Rome, as well as Hovsep Shishmanian ([[Dzerents]]), who - inspired by the visible outline of the distant [[Taurus mountains]], in 1875 - he wrote the historical novel Toros Levoni, set in the times of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]]; according to tradition, in 1140 prince [[Thoros II, Prince of Armenia|Thoros]] II took refuge here to escape from his persecutors.

The monastery won the favour of the [[Ottomans]]: a 1642 [[firman]] exempted Armenians from paying taxes for the monastery, whose terms were renewed in 1660 and 1701. The 1650-1750 period is considered its “golden century”, as huge areas of land were purchased or given to the monastery. A large-scale renovation took place between 1734–1735 by Archimandrite Haroutiun, while between 1811–1818 Symeon Agha of Crimea financed a complete restoration and built the present chapel of the monastery. The initial chapel, at the centre of the monastic compound, was destroyed by earthquakes and natural conditions; the present chapel, next to the original one, was inaugurated on 3 January 1814. Renovations and restorations took place also in 1866 (by commission of the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople Boghos Taktakian), in 1926 (by commission of Dickran Ouzounian, Ashod Aslanian and Garo Balian), in 1929 (by commission of Boghos and Anna Magarian), between 1947–1949 (by commission of Hovhannes and Mary Shakarian) and again in 1973 (by initiative of the Armenian Ethnarchy of Cyprus). The road linking the monastery to Halevga was constructed in 1926-1927, by commission of Agha Garabed Melkonian, while the square, to the east of the monastery, was constructed in 1933 by commission of Catholicos [[Sahag II of Cilicia|Sahag II]].

For centuries, the monastery had been an important spiritual centre. Until the early 20th century, a large number of exquisite and priceless manuscripts written at the monastery’s [[scriptorium]] between 1202-1740, as well as numerous valuable ecclesiastical vessels, were kept here, before they were moved to [[Nicosia]] for safe-keeping; since 1947, 56 [[illuminated manuscripts]] are at the [[Holy See of Cilicia|Catholicosate of Cilicia]] in [[Antelias]]. It appears that the last monks lived permanently until about 1800. There are two monuments in the vicinity: a commemorative stone column at the square of the monastery, unveiled on 8 September 1933 by Catholicos [[Sahag II of Cilicia|Sahag II]], and a mortar obelisk dedicated to Abbot [[Mekhitar of Sebaste|Mekhitar]], on top of the namesake hill to the north-west of the monastery, unveiled on 2 August 1931 by Catholicos [[Sahag II of Cilicia|Sahag II]] and Archbishop [[Bedros IV of Cilicia|Bedros Saradjian]].

Between 1897-1904, [[Vahan Kurkjian]]’s (Pagouran) National Educational Orphanage had its summer sessions here, as did - for the whole year - a small Armenian school for the children of the region until 1914. The area was used as a summer resort and camping site for Armenian scouts and students. In 1948 the Archangels’ fountain was erected, by commission of Kapriel and Arshalouis Kasbarian, which was officially blessed by Bishop Ghevont Chebeyan on 2 May 1948. In 1949 Sarkis and Sourpig Marashlian funded the water distribution network, the turbine and the electric generator. The monastery’s chapel was a favourite place for Christenings. A new baptistery was constructed in 1968 by Karnig Kouyoumdjian. Until 1974, a large number of Armenian-Cypriot families rented rooms in the monastery during the weekends and holidays. On May’s first weekend, [[Macarius of Alexandria|Saint Macarius]]’ feast, many Armenian-Cypriots would visit [[Sourp Magar|Magaravank]] and some of them would rent rooms and help in the preparation of the harissa (chicken porridge). On Sunday, a Liturgy was held at the chapel of the monastery and harissa was served afterwards.

Unfortunately, the monastery was captured by the Turkish troops in August 1974, who later used it to house illegal settlers from Anatolia and, in the 1980s, to house military officers. Left at the mercy of vandals and nature, it has been desecrated and today is dilapidated and in a pitiful condition. Between 1998-1999 and again in 2005, the occupying regime intended to turn it into a hotel; after co-ordinated reactions, this unholy plan was averted. In December 2006 and in July 2008, it was visited by [[Hrant Dink]] and Catholicos [[Aram I]], respectively. By initiative of Representative [[Vartkes Mahdessian]] and the Armenian Ethnarchy, on 6 May 2007 the first visit-pilgrimage took place there after 33 years; it was repeated on 10 May 2009, 9 May 2010, 8 May 2011, 13 May 2012 and 19 May 2013, with the participation of a large number of Armenian-Cypriots and other Armenians, some of whom came from abroad.&lt;ref name="PIO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/pio/pio.nsf/All/DBF419D7DF6CC18EC2256FCE00331E37?OpenDocument|title=Factsheet on the Armenians|last=PIO|date=May 2010|accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Glasfenster Deutschbalten (1973).JPG|thumb|Baltic German stained glass]]
The '''Baltic Germans''' ({{lang-de|Deutsch-Balten}} or {{lang|de|Deutschbalten}}, later {{lang|de|Baltendeutsche}}) are [[germans|ethnic German]] inhabitants of the eastern shores of the [[Baltic Sea]], in what today are [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]]. Since their [[flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|expulsion from Estonia and Latvia and resettlement during the upheavals and aftermath of the Second World War]], Baltic Germans have markedly declined as a geographically determined [[ethnic groups in Europe|ethnic group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miljan |first=Toivo |title=Historical Dictionary of Estonia |year=2004 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |page=121 |isbn=9780810865716}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest groups of present-day descendants of the Baltic Germans are found in Germany and Canada.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} It is estimated that several thousand still reside in Latvia and Estonia.

For centuries Baltic Germans and the [[Baltic nobility]] constituted a ruling class over native non-German [[serfdom|serfs]]. The emerging Baltic-German middle class was mostly urban and professional.

In the 12th and 13th centuries [[Catholic Church in Germany|Catholic Germans]], both traders and crusaders (''see {{lang|de|[[Ostsiedlung]]|italic=unset}}''), began settling in the eastern Baltic territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Christiansen |first=Eric |title=The Northern Crusades: The Baltic and the Catholic Frontier 1100–1525 |date=1980 |location=Minneapolis |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=9780816609949 |oclc=6092550}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Livonian Crusade]], they assumed control of government, politics, economics, education and culture of these lands, ruling for more than 700 years until 1918 — usually in alliance with Polish, Swedish or Russian overlords.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} With the decline of [[Latin language|Latin]], [[German language|German]] became the language of all official documents, commerce, education and government.

At first the majority of German settlers lived in small cities and military castles. Their elite formed the [[Baltic nobility]], acquiring large rural estates and comprising the social, commercial, political and cultural [[elite]] of Latvia and Estonia for several centuries. After 1710 many of these men increasingly took high positions in the military, political and civilian life of the [[Russian Empire]], particularly in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Baltic Germans held citizenship in the [[Russian Empire]] until the Revolution of 1918. They then held Estonian or Latvian citizenship until the occupation and later annexation of these areas by the Soviet Union in 1939–1940.

The Baltic German population never surpassed more than 10% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/50985/Baltic-states/253375/Gradual-modernization|title=Baltic states - region, Europe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 there were 180,000 Baltic Germans in Russia's Baltic provinces, but by 1914 this number had declined to 162,000.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwLVOSCXhXcC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=baltic+germans+community&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiX7Ozj28jOAhUCAZoKHbILB_sQ6AEINDAE#v=snippet&amp;q=baltic+german+community&amp;f=false|title=Die Geschichte der baltischen Staaten|first=Georg von|last=Rauch|date=September 7, 1974|publisher=University of California Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 there were approximately 46,700 Germans in [[Estonia]] (5.3% of the population).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.einst.ee/factsheets/factsheets_uus_kuju/baltic_germans.htm Baltic Germans in Estonia], Estonian Institute einst.ee&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Russian Empire Census]] of 1897, there were 120,191 Germans in [[Latvia]], or 6.2% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/latvia/9.htm|title=Latvia - Population|website=countrystudies.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baltic German history and presence in the Baltics came to an end in late 1939, following the signing of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] and the subsequent [[Nazi–Soviet population transfers]].&lt;ref name="LSM-Oct2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ķibilds |first1=Mārtiņš |title=After 700 years in Latvia, Baltic Germans vanished in a matter of weeks |url=https://eng.lsm.lv/article/culture/history/after-700-years-in-latvia-baltic-germans-vanished-in-a-matter-of-weeks.a297470/ |accessdate=26 October 2018 |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting of Latvia]] |date=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all the Baltic Germans were resettled by [[Nazi Germany]] under the {{lang|de|[[Heim ins Reich]]}} program into the newly formed {{lang|de|[[Reichsgau]]e}} of {{lang|de|[[Reichsgau Wartheland|Wartheland]]}} and [[Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia|Danzig-West Prussia]] (on the territory of the occupied [[Second Polish Republic]]). In 1945, most ethnic Germans were [[heimatvertriebene|expelled]] from these lands by the Soviet army. Resettlement was planned for the territory remaining to Germany under terms of the border changes promulgated at the [[Potsdam Conference]], i.e. west of the [[Oder–Neisse line]], or elsewhere in the world.

Ethnic Germans from [[East Prussia]] and Lithuania are sometimes incorrectly considered Baltic Germans for reasons of cultural, linguistic, and historical affinities. But the Germans of [[East Prussia]] held Prussian, and after 1871, [[German nationality law|German citizenship]], because the territory they lived in was part of [[Kingdom of Prussia]].

==Ethnic composition==
Baltic Germans were not a purely German ethnic group. The early crusaders, tradesmen and craftsmen often married local women, as there were no German women available. Some noble families, such as the [[Lieven]]s, claimed descent through such women from native chieftains. Many of the German Livonian Order soldiers died during the Livonian War. New German arrivals came to the area. During this time the [[Low German]] (''Plattdeutsch'') of the original settlers was gradually replaced by the [[High German languages|High German]] (''Hochdeutsch'') of the new settlers.

In the course of their 700-year history, Baltic German families had ethnic German roots, but also had extensive intermarriage with Estonians, Livonians and Latvians, as well as with other Northern or Central European people, such as Danes, Swedes, Irish, English, Scots, Poles, Hungarians and Dutch. In cases where intermarriage occurred, members of the other ethnic groups frequently assimilated into German culture, adopting language, customs, and German family names. They were then considered Germans, leading to the [[ethnogenesis]] of the Baltic Germans. [[Barclay de Tolly]] and [[George Armitstead (mayor)|George Armitstead]], who emigrated from the British Isles, married into and became part of the Baltic-German community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estinst.ee/publications/estonianculture/I_MMVII/toimetus.html Deutschbalten, im 19.Jh. entstandene Bez. fÜr die dt.

==Territories==
Baltic German settlements in the Baltic area consisted of the following territories:

==Conquering the Baltics==

Small numbers of [[Ethnic Germans]] began to settle in the area in the late 12th century when traders and Christian missionaries began to visit the coastal lands inhabited by tribes who spoke [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] and [[Baltic languages]]. Systematic conquest and settlement of these lands was completed during the [[Northern Crusades]] of the 12th and 13th centuries which resulted in creation of the [[Terra Mariana]] confederation, under the protection of Roman Popes and [[Holy Roman Empire]]. After the heavy defeat in the 1236 [[Battle of Saule]] the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] became a part of the [[Teutonic Order]].

During the next three centuries German-speaking soldiers, clergymen, merchants and craftsmen constituted the majority of the quickly growing urban population, as the native inhabitants usually were prohibited from settling there. Membership in the [[Hanseatic League]] and active trade links with Russia and Europe increased wealth of Baltic German traders.

==Polish-Lithuanian and Swedish rule==
{{main article|Estonia under Swedish rule|Duchy of Courland and Semigallia}}
[[File:Sw BalticProv en.png|thumb|right|Polish-Lithuanian and Swedish lands in the Baltics]]
As the military power of the Teutonic Knights weakened during the 15th century wars with the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]], [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]], the Livonian branch in the north began to pursue its own policies. When the Prussian branch of the Order secularized in 1525 and became a Polish vassal state as the [[Duchy of Prussia]], the Livonian branch remained independent while searching for a similar way to secularize. Livonia became mostly Protestant during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].

In 1558, the [[Tsardom of Russia]] began the [[Livonian War]] against [[Terra Mariana]] which soon involved the Kingdoms of Poland, Sweden, and Denmark and lasted for 20 years. In 1561, Terra Mariana ceased to exist and was divided among Denmark (which took the island of [[Saaremaa|Ösel]]), Sweden (which took northern Estonia) and Poland, which annexed the newly created [[Duchy of Livonia]], and granted the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]], a vassal state of Poland-Lithuania, to the last Master of the Livonian Order [[Gotthard Kettler]]. The secularized land was divided among the remaining knights who formed the basis of [[Baltic nobility]].

The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia existed as a German-speaking country until 1795, while the northern part of Duchy of Livonia was conquered by Sweden which controlled [[Estonia under Swedish rule|parts of Estonia]] between 1561 and 1710 and [[Swedish Livonia]] between 1621 and 1710, having signed an agreement with the local Baltic German nobles not to undermine their political rights and autonomy.

The ''Academia Gustaviana'' (now [[University of Tartu]]) was founded in 1632 by King [[Gustavus II Adolphus]] of Sweden. It remained the only institution of higher education in the former Livonian territories and became the intellectual focus of the Baltic Germans.

At the end of the 17th century Sweden introduced the land [[reduction (Sweden)|reduction]] in its Baltic provinces and properties held by German nobility became the property of [[the Crown]]. That effectively turned serfs into free peasants, but it would be overturned when Russia conquered these territories in 1710 and restored the rights of German landowners under the [[Treaty of Nystad]].

==Russia's Baltic governorates (1710–1917)==
{{main article|Baltic governorates}}
[[File:Meyerbaltikum.jpg|thumb|right|Russian Baltic governorates]]

[[File:Mezotne garden side 2014 (1b).jpg|thumb|right|[[Mežotne Palace]] in Latvia]]

Between 1710 and 1795, following Russia's success in the [[Great Northern War]] and the three [[Partitions of Poland]], the areas inhabited by Baltic Germans eventually became [[Baltic governorates]] of [[Russian Empire]] - [[Courland Governorate]], [[Governorate of Livonia]] and [[Governorate of Estonia]].

===Autonomy===
The Baltic provinces remained autonomous and were self-governed by the local [[Baltic nobility]]. Until the imperial reforms of 1880s local government was in the hands of the [[landtag]] of each province, in which only members of the matriculated [[Baltic nobility]] held membership and cities were ruled by German [[burgomaster]]s.

Between 1710 and approximately 1880 Baltic German ruling class enjoyed great autonomy from the Imperial government and achieved great political influence in the Imperial court.  Starting from the 18th century Baltic German nobility increasingly assumed leading posts in the Russian imperial government, after all, Russia was ruled by a German dynasty of [[Holstein-Gottorp]], and Baltic Germans provided a well-educated, Westernized elite.

Germans, other than the local estate-owners, mainly lived in the cities, such as [[Riga]], [[Tallinn|''Reval'']], [[Tartu|''Dorpat'']], [[Pärnu|''Pernau'']] and [[Jelgava|''Mittau'']]. As late as the mid-19th century the population of many of these cities still had a German majority, with Estonian, Latvian or Jewish minorities. By 1867 [[Riga]]'s population was 42.9% German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history-museum.lv/english/pages/par-mums/muzeja-vesture.php|title=National History Museum of Latvia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the late 19th century most of the professional and learned classes in the region, the ''[[Intellectual|literati]]'', were Germans.

German political and [[cultural autonomy]] ceased in the 1880s, when [[Russification]] replaced German administration and schooling with the usage of [[Russian language|Russian]]. After 1885 provincial governors usually were Russians.

===Rise of native peoples===
Years of peace under Russian rule brought increasing prosperity and many new manor houses were built in country estates, but economic exploitation worsened situation of the native population.
For examples, see [[List of palaces and manor houses in Latvia]] and [[List of palaces and manor houses in Estonia]].

The native [[Latvians|Latvian]] and [[Estonians|Estonian]] population enjoyed fewer rights under the Baltic German nobility compared to the farmers in Germany, Sweden, or Poland. In contrast to the Baltic Germans, Estonians and Latvians had restricted civil rights and resided mostly in rural areas as [[serfs]], tradesmen, or as servants in manors and urban homes. They had no rights to leave their masters and no last names. This was in keeping with the social scheme of things in [[Russian Empire]], and lasted until the 19th century, when [[emancipation]] from [[serfdom]] brought those inhabitants increased civil freedoms and some political rights.

In 1804 Livonian peasant law was introduced by Imperial government, aimed at improving condition of serfs. Serfdom was abolished in all Baltic provinces between 1816 and 1820, about half a century earlier than in Russia proper. For some time there was no outward tension between the German speakers and indigenous residents.

If earlier any Latvian or Estonian who managed to rise above his class was expected to Germanize and to forget his roots, by the middle of 19th century German urban classes began to feel increasing competition from the natives, who after [[the First Latvian National Awakening]] and [[Estonian national awakening]] produced their own middle class and moved to German and Jewish dominated towns and cities in increasing numbers.

The [[Revolution of 1905]] led to attacks against the Baltic German landowners, the burning of manors, and the torture and even killing of members of the nobility. During the 1905 Revolution groups of rebels burned over 400 manor houses and German owned buildings and killed 82 Germans. In response Cossack punitive expeditions aided by German nobles and officers burned down hundreds of farms, arrested and deported thousands and summarily executed at least 2,000 people.

Reaction to 1905 Revolution included a scheme by Karl Baron von Manteuffel-Szoege and Silvio Broedrich-Kurmahlen to pacify the countryside by settling up to 20,000 ethnic German farmers, mostly from [[Volhynia]], in Courland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myvolyn.de/wolhynien-spezial/wolhynier-im-baltikum.html|title=Begegnung mit Wolhynien|website=www.myvolyn.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
{{main article|Ober Ost|United Baltic Duchy}}
World War I brought the end of the alliance of the Baltic Germans and the Russian Tsarist government. German heritage made them to be seen as the enemy by [[Russians]]. They were seen also as traitors by the [[German Empire]] if they remained loyal to Russia. Their loyalty to the state was questioned and rumors of a German fifth column increased together with the defeats of the Imperial army led by Baltic German general [[Paul von Rennenkampf]]. All German schools and societies were closed in the Estonian Governorate and Germans were ordered to leave the Courland Governorate for inner Russia.

Courland was conquered by Germany in 1915 and included into the military [[Ober Ost]] administration. After the Russian surrender at the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] in 1917, the [[German Empire]] occupied the remaining Baltic provinces.

The [[Ober Ost]] military administration began plans for German colonization of Courland. On April 20, 1917 the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern front announced that 1/3 or arable land there should be reserved for settlement by German war veterans. This was approved by Courland's German nobility on September 22, 1917.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===United Baltic Duchy===
Livonian and Estonian nobles on January 28, 1918 delivered a note of independence to Soviet representatives in Stockholm, announcing their intent to break away from Russia under the rights granted to them by the [[Treaty of Nystad]] of 1721. In response Bolsheviks, who controlled Estonia, arrested 567 leading Germans and deported them to Russia. After signing the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] they were allowed to return. Under German-Soviet treaties, Germany gained control over Courland, Riga, Saaremaa (Ösel), Livonia and Estonia.

In spring of 1918 Baltic Germans announced the restoration of the independent [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (1918)|Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] and pursued plans for uniting it with the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. On April 12, 1918 Baltic German representatives from all Baltic provinces met in Riga and called on the German Emperor to annex the Baltic lands.

Later, instead of outright annexation, a plan for a [[United Baltic Duchy]] ruled by [[Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg]] was developed. Its regency council met on November 9, 1918 but collapsed together with the German Empire.

==Independent Baltic states==
{{main article|Latvian War of Independence|Baltische Landeswehr}}
The Baltic Germans' rule and class privileges came to the end with the demise of the Russian Empire (due to the [[Bolshevik revolution]] of October 1917) and the independence of [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] in 1918–1919.

Baltic Germans greatly suffered under Bolshevik regimes in Estonia and Latvia. While short-lived, they pursued Red Terror against Germans, often killing them purely because of their nationality.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hnq7AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=baltic+germans+canada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjVgc_Y3sjOAhXlIJoKHQ79C_UQ6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=baltic+germans&amp;f=true|title=The Estonians; The long road to independence|first1=Gunter|last1=Faure|first2=Teresa|last2=Mensing|date=September 7, 2018|publisher=Lulu.com|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the collapse of the German Empire, Baltic Germans in Estonia began forming volunteer units to defend against the Bolshevik threat. On November 27, 1918 this was authorized by the Estonian government, and the Volunteer Baltic Battalion (''Freiwilligen Baltenbataillon'') was formed under the command of Colonel [[Constantin von Weiss]] ([[:de:Constantin von Weiß|de]]).

During the Estonian and Latvian independence wars of 1918–1920, many Baltic Germans signed voluntarily into the newly formed Estonian and Latvian armies to help secure the independence of these countries from Russia. These Baltic German military units became known as the ''[[Baltische Landeswehr]]'' in Latvia and ''[[Baltenregiment]] ([[:de:Baltenregiment|de]])'' in Estonia. The State archives of Estonia and Latvia keep individual military records of each person who fought in this war.

''Baltische Landeswehr'' units took Riga on May 22, 1919 which was followed by White Terror in which up to 2,000 people, mostly Latvians, were shot as suspected Bolshevik supporters.

Baltic German outlying estates were frequent targets of local Bolsheviks (as portrayed in the film, ''[[Coup de Grâce (1976 film)|Coup de Grâce]]'') and the combination of local Bolsheviks and nationalists following independence brought about land nationalisations and a displacement of Baltic Germans from positions of authority. Baltic Germans of the Livonian Governorate found themselves in two new countries, both of which introduced sweeping agrarian reforms aimed at the large land owners, an absolute majority of whom were Germans.

As a result of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the subsequent [[Russian Civil War]], many Baltic Germans fled to Germany. After 1919, many Baltic Germans felt obliged to depart the newly independent states for [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], but many stayed as ordinary citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Hiden, John, ''The Baltic States and Weimar Ostpolitik'', [[Cambridge University]] Press, 1987, {{ISBN|0-521-32037-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 there were 70,964 Germans in Latvia (3.6%) and 62,144 in 1935 (3.2% of population). Riga remained by far the largest German center with 38,523 Germans residing there in 1935, while Tallinn then had 6,575 Germans.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

While the German landed class soon lost most of their lands after the agrarian reforms, they continued to work in their professions and to lead their companies. German cultural autonomy was respected. The [[Committee of the German Baltic Parties]] in Latvia and ''[[German-Baltic Party|Deutsch-baltische Partei in Estland]]'' in Estonia participated in elections and won seats.

At the same time, as both young states built their institutions this often reduced the status of their minorities. In Latvia, children of mixed marriages were registered as Latvians while in Estonia they took the nationality of their fathers, who increasingly were Estonians. This quickly reduced the number of German children. German place names were eliminated from public use. German congregations lost their churches. [[St Mary's Cathedral, Tallinn|Tallinn Cathedral]] was given to an Estonian congregation in 1927. [[Latvian church property referendum, 1923|After the 1923 referendum]] [[St. James's Cathedral, Riga|St. James's Cathedral]] in Riga was lost and [[Riga Cathedral]] taken away after another [[Latvian Riga Cathedral referendum, 1931|referendum in 1931]].

===Agrarian reforms===
At the start of independence Baltic Germans owned 58% of land in Estonia and 48% in Latvia. Radical agrarian reforms were implemented in both countries to break German power and to distribute land to the veterans of independence wars and landless peasants. This largely destroyed the landed class of German noble families and their economic base.

On October 10, 1919 the Estonian parliament expropriated 1,065 estates (96.6% of all estates). March 1, 1926 law set the compensation to the former owners of arable land at about 3% of its market value and no compensation at all for the forests. This almost instantly bankrupted the German noble class, even if they were allowed to keep some 50 ha of their lands.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

On September 16, 1920 the [[Constitutional Assembly of Latvia]] nationalized 1,300 estates with 3.7 million hectares of land. Former German owners were allowed to keep 50 ha of land and farm equipment. In 1924, the [[Saeima]] decided that no compensation would be paid to former owners. In 1929, the Saeima voted that veterans of the ''Baltische Landeswehr'' could not receive any land.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Estonia===
In Estonia, there was only one German party, which from 1926 was led by [[Axel de Vries]] ([[:de:Axel de Vries|de]]), editor of ''Revaler Bote''. Their leading parliamentarian was Werner Hasselblatt (1890–1958). Germans never received ministerial posts in governments. The three largest minorities Germans, Swedes and Russians sometimes formed election coalitions. The ''Deutsch-baltische Partei in Estland'' was established to defend the interests of German landowners, who wanted to receive compensation for their nationalized lands and properties. After land nationalization they received no compensation, but could keep plots up to 50 ha which could not support their manor houses.

Germans were banned from governmental and military positions. Many Germans sold their properties and emigrated to Scandinavia or Western Europe. Most of the grand manor houses were taken over by schools, hospitals, local administration and museums.

Estonia's Baltic German population was smaller than Latvia's, so as Estonians continued to fill professional positions such as law and medicine, there was less of a leadership role for the Baltic Germans. Baron Wilhelm [[Wrangel family|Wrangell]], leader of the Baltic German cultural association between 1933 and 1938 was included in the Estonian Council of State after 1937 as a token representative of minorities. The last leader of Baltic German Cultural administration was [[:de:Hellmuth Weiss|Hellmuth Weiss]].

On February 12, 1925 Estonia adapted the Cultural Autonomy and national Minorities act which provided for some cultural autonomy of Germans. Despite this, German community in Estonia continued to decline as the majority of young people chose to emigrate. By 1934 there were 16.346 Baltic Germans in Estonia, 1.5% of the total population.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Estonia allowed German schools in German language, they were overseen by the ''Gesellschaft Deutsche Schulhilfe'', which was part of the Union of German Societies in Estonia. After adoption of the Minority law of February 5, 1925 the Baltic German Cultural Council was created on November 1, 1925. In 1928, German schools were attended by 3,456 pupils.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Latvia===
[[File:Large Guild Riga 1918.jpg|thumb|right|Building of the Large Guild in Riga, 1918]]
In Latvia, Baltic Germans remained a politically active and organized ethnic group, although they lost some influence after the [[1934 Latvian coup d'état]]. A couple of times Germans received ministerial posts in coalition governments. Commander of Latvia's Navy between 1919 and 1931 was Admiral Archibald Count von [[Keyserlingk|Keyserling]].

Six, later seven, German parties existed and formed a coalition in the [[Saeima]]. The leading politicians were Baron Wilhelm Friedrich Karl von Fircks, leader of the Baltic-German People's Party and [[Paul Schiemann]], editor in chief of the ''[[:de:Rigasche Rundschau|Rigasche Rundschau]]'' newspaper and leader of the Baltic-German Democratic Party. Increased activity of National Socialist supporters in the German community led to the resignation of Schiemann from the ''Rigasche Rundschau'' in 1933.

Minority cultural affairs were overseen by the Ministry of Culture and the German section was led by pastor Karl Keller (1868–1939) and later by Dr. Wolfgang Wachtsmuth. In 1923, there were 12.168 pupils in German schools. The Herder Institute, a private German university with three faculties (Theology, Jurisprudence and Political Science and Philosophy) was established.

In 1926, the German community introduced voluntary self-taxation, asking all Germans to contribute up to 3% of their monthly income to community activities. In 1928, the Baltic German National Community was established as the central representative body of Baltic Germans in Latvia.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Educational autonomy of Germans was severely limited in 1931–1933, when the Minister of Education [[:lv:Atis Ķeniņš|Atis Ķeniņš]] introduced a policy of latvianization in minority schools. On July 18, 1934 the autonomous German schools were brought under complete control of the Ministry of Education.

After the May 15, 1934 coup all associations and independent business organizations had to shut down, this affected the German community especially hard, as they lost their ancient communal centers – [[Large Guild, Riga|guilds]], and all of their property was nationalized. Then followed a wave of takeovers of Jewish, Russian and German businesses – banks, factories and trading companies were purchased by state owned banks at set rates in order to reduce minority control over businesses.

===1939–1940===

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 137-054436, Riga, Umsiedlung Baltendeutscher.jpg|thumb|right|Boxed goods of leaving Germans, Riga 1939]]
As a result of the secret agreements of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] between [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in 1939, Estonia and Latvia were assigned to the "Soviet sphere of influence". One of the main conditions posed by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] to [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] in August 1939 was the prior transfer of all ethnic Germans living in Estonia and Latvia to areas under German military control.&lt;ref name="LSM-Oct2018" /&gt; These became known as the [[Nazi–Soviet population transfers]]. Stalin proceeded to set up Soviet military bases in Estonia and Latvia in late 1939.

In a speech to [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]] on October 6, 1939 with was broadcast live on radio, Hitler announced that German minorities should be resettled in the Reich (Back home to Reich, ''[[heim ins Reich]]''). Resettlement was overseen by [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] who created a new Reich Commisariat for the Strengthening of Germandom for this purpose.

Treaties were signed with Estonia and Latvia in 1939 and 1940 concerning the emigration of Baltic Germans and the liquidation of their educational, cultural, and religious institutions. Nazi Germany succeeded in getting the Baltic Germans to abandon their homes and homeland in haste. Due to the imposition of wartime rationing, Germans were banned from taking along any valuables, objects of historic value, fuels and even food. Massive sell-off of household items and small businesses followed. Larger properties, real estate and businesses were sold over a longer period of time by a special German commission to local governments.

*Some 13,700 Baltic Germans were resettled from Estonia by early 1940.
*Around 51,000 Baltic Germans were resettled from Latvia by early 1940.

The Estonian and Latvian governments published books containing alphabetical lists of the names of resettled Baltic German adults together with their birthdate, birthplace and last address in the Baltics.&lt;ref&gt;''Eestist saksamaale ümberasunute nimestik''/''Verzeichnis der aus Estland nach Deutschland Umgesiedelten'', Oskar Angelus, Tallinn 1939; "Izceļojušo vācu tautības pilsoņu saraksts" : "The list of resettled citizens of German ethnicity".1940&lt;/ref&gt;

Baltic Germans left by ships from the port cities of Estonia and Latvia to ports of [[Gotenhafen]] and [[Stettin]] and then were transported to [[Poznań|Posen]] and [[Lodz]] in ''[[Reichsgau Wartheland]]'' (sometimes called ''Warthegau'') and other [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany]]. The "new" homes and farms they were given to live in had been owned and inhabited by Poles and Jews just a few months earlier who were executed or deported eastwards when Nazi Germany invaded Poland. The new arrivals fulfilled Nazi plans for ethnic Germanization of these lands.

===Spring 1941 resettlement===
In early 1941, the Nazi German government arranged another resettlement for all those who had refused to leave in 1939 or 1940. The action was called the ''Nachumsiedlung''. This time around no compensation was offered for any property or belongings left behind and this group of resettlers were treated with intense suspicion or considered traitors because they had refused Hitler's first call to leave the Baltics in 1939. Most of these arrivals were first settled in filtration camps. Unknown to the general public, the [[Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union]] was only 2 to 4 months away, and this was Hitler's last chance to transfer these people in peacetime conditions.

By this time, the remaining Baltic Germans in Estonia and Latvia found themselves in a vastly different situation than in 1939. Their countries were now occupied by the Soviet Union, and intense pressure and intimidation had been put on anyone with a position of privilege or wealth before 1939. Mass arrests and some killings had taken place. Fearing a worsening of the situation, the vast majority of the remaining Baltic Germans decided to leave. About 7,000 resettled from Estonia by late March 1941, and approximately 10,500 resettled from Latvia by late March 1941.

No books were published listing those who resettled in 1941; however, the present-day archives of Estonia and Latvia still have the lists of all those who left in this year.

===1941–1944===
A very small minority of Baltic Germans refused again to be resettled and remained in the Baltics past March 1941. Some fell victim to the [[Soviet deportations]] to Siberian [[gulag]]s beginning in early June 1941. The names and data of those deported from Estonia from 1941 to 1953 have been published in books. Details are kept at the [[Museum of Occupations]] in Estonia.

After the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union and the conquering of Latvia and Estonia, a small number of Baltic Germans were allowed to return in order to serve as translators, but requests of many resettled Germans to be allowed to return to their homelands were denied by Himmler's [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. Many German Baltic men were mobilized in the occupied Warthegau and served in the German army.

The resettled Germans fled west with the retreating German army in 1944. No precise numbers or lists are available for them. However, several thousand Baltic Germans remained in the Baltics after 1944, but they were subject to widespread discrimination (and possible deportation to Siberia until 1953) by the Soviet authorities ruling Estonia and Latvia. As a result of this, many hid or lied about their Baltic German origins. Most of those who stayed past 1944 were children of mixed ethnic marriages or themselves married to ethnic Estonians, Latvians or Russians and their descendants no longer consider themselves German.

==="Second resettlement" 1945===
{{Main article|Evacuation of German civilians during the end of World War II}}

The Soviet Union's advance into Poland and Germany in late 1944 and early 1945 resulted in the Baltic Germans being evacuated by the German authorities (or simply fleeing) from their "new homes" to areas even further in the west to escape the advancing [[Red Army]]. Most of them settled in [[West Germany]], some ended up in [[East Germany]].

In stark contrast to the resettlements in 1939–1941, this time around the evacuation in most of the areas was delayed until the last moment, when it was too late to conduct it in an orderly fashion, and practically all of them had to leave most of their belongings behind.

Seeing as they had only been living in these "new" homes for only about five years, this was almost seen as a ''second forced resettlement'' for them, albeit under different circumstances. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Many Baltic Germans were on board the [[KdF Ship Wilhelm Gustloff|KdF Ship ''Wilhelm Gustloff'']] when it was sunk by a Soviet submarine on January 30, 1945. By one estimate,&lt;ref name="DiscoveryChannel"&gt;"Wilhelm Gustloff: World's Deadliest Sea Disasters". ''Unsolved History'', The Discovery Channel. Season 1, Episode 14. (Original air date: March 26, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; 9,400 people on board died, which would make it the largest loss of life in a single ship sinking [[List of maritime disasters|in history]]. Additionally, many Baltic Germans died during the sinking of the [[SS General von Steuben|SS ''General von Steuben'']] on February 10, 1945.

Two books listing the names and personal data of all Baltic Germans who died as a result of the resettlements and wartime conditions between 1939 and 1947 have been published by the Baltic German genealogical society: ''Deutsch-baltisches Gedenkbuch. Unsere Toten der Jahre 1939–1947'' by Karin von Borbély, Darmstadt, 1991; and ''Nachtrag zum Deutsch-baltisches Gedenkbuch'' by Karin von Borbély, Darmstadt, 1995.

Later, with Estonia and Latvia falling under Soviet rule after 1944, the Baltic Germans did not return to Soviet occupied Baltics again.

Many thousands of Baltic Germans emigrated to [[Canada]] starting in 1948 with the support of Canadian [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|The Earl Alexander of Tunis]], who had known many Baltic Germans when he had commanded the [[Baltische Landeswehr|Baltic German Landeswehr]] for a short time in 1919. Initially only 12 Germans were allowed to settle in 1948. Based on the good behavior of this group, many thousands of Baltic Germans were soon allowed to immigrate during the following years.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Destruction of cultural heritage in the Soviet Baltics (1945–1989)==
[[File:Great Cemetery Riga 02.jpg|thumb|right|Some better preserved tombstones in Riga's [[Great Cemetery]].]]
During the 50-year-long [[occupation of the Baltic states]], Soviet occupation authorities governing the [[Estonian SSR]] and the [[Latvian SSR]], politically empowered by their victory in [[World War II]], were keen to erase any traces of ethnic German rule in past centuries.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Numerous statues, monuments, structures or landmarks with German writing were destroyed, vandalized or left to ruin.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The largest Baltic German cemeteries in Estonia, [[Kopli cemetery]] and [[Mõigu cemetery]], both standing since 1774, were completely destroyed by the Soviet authorities. [[Great Cemetery]]  of Riga, the largest burial ground of Baltic Germans in Latvia standing since 1773, also had the vast majority of its graves destroyed by the Soviets.

==1989 to present==

The present-day governments of Estonia and Latvia, who regained their independence in 1991, generally take a positive, or sometimes neutral, view towards the contributions of the Baltic Germans in the development of their cities and countries throughout their history. An occasional exception to this comes with some criticism in relation to the major landowners, who controlled most of the rural areas of the Baltics, and the ethnic Estonians and Latvians, until 1918.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

After Estonia regained independence from the [[Soviet Union]] on August 20, 1991, the exiled association of the German Baltic nobility sent an official message to the president-to-be [[Lennart Meri]] that no member of the association would claim proprietary rights to their former Estonian lands. This, and the fact that the first German ambassadors to [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] were both Baltic Germans, helped to further reconcile the Baltic Germans with these two countries.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Cooperation between Baltic German societies and the governments of Estonia and Latvia has made the restoration of many small Baltic German plaques and landmarks possible, such as monuments to those who fought in the 1918–1920 War of Independence.

Since 1989, many elderly Baltic Germans, or their descendants, have taken holidays to Estonia and Latvia to look for traces of their own past, their ancestral homes, and their family histories. Most of the remaining manor houses have new owners, operate as hotels and are open to public.

==Notable Baltic Germans==
{{Main article|List of Baltic Germans}}
[[File:Barclay de Tolly stamp 2011.jpg|thumb|Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly. Russia postage stamp, 2011]]
Baltic Germans played leading roles in the society of what are now Estonia and Latvia throughout most of the period from 13th to mid-20th century, with many of them becoming noted scientists or explorers. A number of Baltic Germans served as ranking generals in the [[Russian Imperial Army]] and [[Imperial Russian Navy|Navy]], including [[Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly|Michael Barclay de Tolly]], [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern|Adam von Krusenstern]], [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen|Fabian von Bellingshausen]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden|Friedrich von Buxhoeveden]], [[Paul von Rennenkampf]], [[Ivan Ivanovich Michelson]] and [[Eduard Totleben]].

Many Baltic Germans (such as [[Roman von Ungern-Sternberg|Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg]], [[Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel|Baron Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel]], [[Yevgeny Miller]], and [[Anatoly Lieven]]) sided with the [[White movement|Whites]] and related anti-Bolshevik forces (like the ''[[Baltische Landeswehr]]'' and the ''[[Freikorps in the Baltic|Freikorps]]'' movement) during the [[Russian Civil War]].

{{Group intelligence}}
A '''collective''' is a group of entities that share or are motivated by at least one common issue or interest, or work together to achieve a common objective.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Collectives can differ from [[cooperative]]s in that they are not necessarily focused upon an economic benefit or saving, but can be that as well.

The term "collective" is sometimes used to describe a species as a whole—for example, the human collective.

For political purposes, a collective is defined by decentralized, or "majority-rules" decision making styles.

==Types of groups==
Collectives are sometimes characterised by attempts to share and exercise [[political power|political]] and [[power (sociology)|social]] power and to make decisions on a [[consensus]]-driven and [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] basis. 

A [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]] or [[intentional community]], which may also be known as a "collective household", is a group of people who live together in some kind of dwelling or residence, or in some other arrangement (e.g. sharing land). Collective households may be organized for a specific purpose (e.g. relating to business, [[parenting]], or some other shared interest).

[[Artist collective]]s, including [[musical collective]]s, are typically a collection of individuals with similar interests in producing and documenting art as a group. These groups can range in size from a few people to thousands of members.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} The style of art produced can have vast differences. Motivations can be for a common cause or individually motivated purposes. Some collectives are simply people who enjoy painting with someone else and have no other goals or motivations for forming their collective.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

A [[Worker cooperative]] is a type of horizontal [[collectivism]] wherein a business functions as a partnership of individual professionals, recognizing them as equals and rewarding them for their expertise. The working collective aims to reduce costs to clients while maintaining healthy rewards for participating partners. This is accomplished by eliminating the operating costs that are needed to support levels of management.&lt;ref&gt;PRWeb Santa Monica, February 26, 2010.  [http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/02/prweb3635314.htm At One Year, New Agency Structure Succeeds: Commitment to Small Business Continues].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corruption in Slovakia''' is examined on this page.

== Extent ==
Transparency International’s [http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013 Global Corruption Barometer 2013] indicates that corruption remains a serious problem in [[Slovakia]]. High-profile corruption cases have plagued the country, including the “Gorilla” case that surfaced at the end of 2011. In this case, secret wiretap recordings between 2005 and 2006 were leaked to the internet, bringing to light millions of Euros in bribes paid by a private equity firm to Slovakian government officials in exchange for privatisation and procurement deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slovakia Corruption Profile-Political Climate|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/slovakia/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013 Global Corruption Barometer 2013], political parties rank as the third most corrupt institution in Slovakia, after the judiciary and public servants, and 56% of surveyed households believe the level of corruption in the country has “increased a lot” in the past two years. In order to combat corruption in the country, Slovakia has initiated several corruption reforms in recent years, including the creation of a central contract registry and publishing online all government contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slovakia Corruption Profile-Political Climate|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/slovakia/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 54th place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perception Index 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas ==
=== Business ===
Corruption is ranked as the second most problematic factor for doing business in Slovakia, according to the World Economic Forum’s [http://www.weforum.org/ [[Global Competitiveness Report]] 2013-2014], after inefficient government bureaucracy. Surveyed business executives report that public funds are often diverted to companies, individuals or groups due to corruption, and the lack of ethical behaviour by companies in their interactions with public officials, politicians and other companies represents a serious business disadvantage for the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slovakia Corruption Profile-Business and Corruption|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/slovakia/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies consider the occurrence of irregular payments and bribes to be fairly common in connection with imports and exports, public utilities, annual tax payment, and awarding of public contracts and licences or obtaining favourable judicial decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slovakia Corruption Profile-Business and Corruption|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/slovakia/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission''' (EACC) was established after [[Kenya]]’s President [[Mwai Kibaki]] signed the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Act on 29 August 2011. The EACC replaced the [[Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission]] (KACC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eacc.go.ke/default.asp?pageid=2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704061611/http://www.eacc.go.ke/default.asp?pageid=2 |archivedate=2013-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment==
The country’s Parliament disbanded KACC on 24 August 2011, in line with the requirements for change as stipulated in the new Constitutional dispensation after the promulgation of the [[Constitution of Kenya|2010 Constitution]].

The EACC was established on 5 September 2011 and Commissioners [[Irene Keino]] and Prof. [[Jane K. Onsongo]] appointed on 11 May 2012 to head the anti-graft agency.

Chairman Mumo Matemu was nominated by the Grand Coalition principals, President Mwai Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga in 2012 to head the anti-graft agency alongside commissioners Irene Keino and Prof. Jane Onsongo.

The three have since resigned concurrently amid controversy in between April–May 2015.

In November 2015, President Uhuru Kenyatta nominated new members to head the agency. Philip Kinusu as the commission’s chairperson alongside four other officials as commissioners. The commissioners are Dabar Maalim, Paul Gachoka, Sophia Lepuchirit and Rose Macharia

'''The Commission Secretary - HALAKHE DIDA WAQO is in charge of the day to day operations.''' Mr. Halakhe D. Waqo formally took office at the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) after a swearing-in ceremony held at the Supreme Court of Kenya, on 21 January 2013.

By doing so, he becomes the Commission’s first Secretary/Chief Executive Officer since EACC was established to replace the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission in 2012.

He is deputised by:

'''Mr. Michael Mubea''' (Deputy Secretary/Chief Executive Officer – Operations) whom joined the commission in 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12965">Before ForDisc, many anthropologists based their studies off of museum skeletal collections such as the [[Hamann-Todd Collection|Hamann-Todd collection]] that is housed at Case Western Reserve in Cleveland, Ohio, and the [[Terry Collection|Terry collection]] housed at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, DC. These museum collections house skeletal remains that were amassed from 50 to 100 years ago. Due to the age of these collections, their use in a medico-legal context did not produce accurate determination of the biological profile. ForDisc was forensic anthropologists solution to this problem, and allowed for classification when some measurements are not available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Book review: FORDISC 2.0: PERSONAL COMPUTER FORENSIC DISCRIMINANT FUNCTIONS.|last = Ubelaker|first = Douglas H.|date = 1998|journal = International Journal of Osteoarchaeology

ForDisc, an interactive [[discriminant function]]s program created by Stephen Ousley and Richard Jantz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-291090697.html|title=Dennis Dirkmaat publishes new book on forensic anthropology|date=31 May 2012|work=Computer Weekly News {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is widely used by [[Forensic anthropology|forensic anthropologists]] to assist in the creation of a [[decedent]]'s biological profile when only parts of the [[human cranium|cranium]] are available. The use of discriminant function analysis in this program allows the researcher to sort individuals into specific groups that are defined by certain criteria. In this program discriminate function analysis "analyzes specific groups with known membership in discrete categories such as ancestry, language, sex, tribe or ancestry, and provides a basis for the classification of new individuals with unknown group membership."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Forensic Anthropology|last = Ousley|first = Stephen|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 311–329|last2 = Jantz|first2 = Richard|editor-last = Dirkmaat|editor-first = Dennis|chapter = Ch. 15: Fordisc 3 and Statistical Methods for Estimating Sex and Ancestry}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program compares potential profiles to data contained in a [[database]] of skeletal measurements of modern humans.&lt;ref name="OJ2005"&gt;Ousley, S.D., and R.L. Jantz (2005) FORDISC 3.0: Personal Computer Forensic Discriminant Functions. 
[http://web.utk.edu/~anthrop/fordiscbody.htm University of Tennessee]&lt;/ref&gt;

Using ForDisc, a decedent’s biological profile can be created based on measurements from various areas of bones, along with information about the person's age, height, race, and illnesses. For ancestry ForDisc uses standard anthropometric measurements including maximum length, maximum breadth, bi-zygomatic breadth, orbital breadth and height, maximum alveolar breadth and width, minimum frontal breadth, basion-bregma, basion-prosthion, cranial base length, bi-auricular breadth, upper facial height and breadth, foramen magnum breadth and length, frontal chord, parietal chord, occipital chord, nasal height and breadth, bi-orbital breadth, inter orbital breadth, and mastoid length.

== Databases ==
The data behind this software largely originated from the Forensic Data Bank, which is contributed to by the [[University of Tennessee]] and other contributing institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1371408.html|title=Couple Fleshes Out Skeletons' Past|last=Kelly|first=John|date=14 September 2006|work=Washington Post {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Forensic Data Bank was created in 1986, through the use of a National Institute of Justice grant, and has gathered over 3400 cases.The Forensic Data Bank is a currently ongoing effort to record information about modern populations, primarily from forensic cases.

ForDisc's creators have also integrated  [[William W. Howells|W. W. Howells]] worldwide cranial data in to the program, for the use of archaeological remains. Howell's craniometric data set consist of 2500 crania from 28 different populations around the world dating to the later Holocene, in which around 82 cranial measurements were obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Who’s Who in Skulls. Ethnic Identification of Crania from Measurements|last = Howells|first = WW.|publisher = Papers of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology,|year = 1995|isbn = |location = Cambridge, Mass.: Peabody Museum.|pages = vol. 82, pp. 108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
This software is able to estimate the sex, ancestry, and stature from a skeleton of unknown identity. This software also can be used for international hearings of war crime and investigations of human rights.&lt;ref name="OJ2005" /&gt; This method is also used by the FBI, in different types of criminal cases.&lt;ref&gt;Application of Forensic Discriminant Functions to a Spanish Cranial Sample, by Douglas H. Ubelaker, Ann H. Ross, Sally M. Graver ''Forensic Science Communications'' July 2002 — Volume 4 — Number 3 [http://www2.fbi.gov/hq/lab/fsc/backissu/july2002/ubelaker1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this program was created for forensic anthropology use, many physical anthropologists are still using the program to determine the biological profile of skeletal remains that are considered archaeological in origin, but the use of this program on archaeological remains has produced misclassifications in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Century of Skeletal Biology and Paleopathology: Contrasts, Contradictions, and Conflicts|last = Armelagos|first = George J.|date = 2003|journal = American Anthropologist Vol. 105, No. 1, Special Issue: Biological Anthropology: Historical Perspectives on Current Issues, Disciplinary Connections, and Future Directions pp. 53-64|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of William W. Howell’s craniometric data set, which is published online, has made ForDisc 2.0 more appealing to many physical anthropologists concerned with archaeological remains.

== Updates ==
This program is continually updated. New and updated versions are created and added as more knowledge is acquired. The new features of ForDisc 2.0 are improved pictorial guide to measurements, and improved file management and printer control; larger number of variables, including post cranial variables; larger numbers of groups, including Howells' worldwide cranial data. The newest version, ForDisc 3.0 is an interactive forensic software that runs under the Windows system.

==Criticism==
According to the authors of the program, there are limitations that should be taken into account when using this program. Some of these limitations include the fact that ForDisc will classify any unknown into the ‘closest’ group, this means that even if an individuals ethnic group or race is not represented in the database, the program will classify it to the ‘closest’ group. Another limitation involves classification using hybrid individuals and groups. The authors state that genetic exchange between groups can cause misclassifications due to gene overlap that can consist of two ancestral populations. Another limitation deal with the classification of individuals under the age of 18, this is due to the nature of physical anthropologists ability to assess age in subadults. However, the authors state that there are differences between subadults in different groups, but these differences tend to not correspond to differences seen in adults. Another limitation that the authors believe researchers should take into account is the fact that this program is based on measurements that are affected by "disease, disuse, treatment, or trauma." The measurement of affected bone(s) may produce values that are inaccurate, and therefore he classification will not reflect the correct population affinity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ousley, Stephen, and Jantz, Richard. "Fordisc Help File, Version 1.35." Mercyhurst Archaeological Institute.   http://math.mercyhurst.edu/~sousley/Fordisc/Help/Fordisc3_Help.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The last limitation deals with archaeological populations. This limitation is due to the fact that most of the measurements in the data set that the classifications are based on in the program are from remains that are from the 20th century, and should not be used for classification of archaeological remains. This is because documented population differences and secular changes that have occurred throughout history. However, the inclusion of W. W. Howells craniometric data set has allowed researchers to classify archaeological remains due to the fact that much of the data set comes from individuals from the 19th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 2009 study found that FORDISC 3.0 "is only likely to be useful when an unidentified specimen is more or less complete and belongs to one of the populations represented in its reference samples", and even in such "favorable circumstances it can be expected to classify no more than 1 per cent of specimens with confidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2012 research was presented at the 81st Annual Meeting of the [[American Association of Physical Anthropologists]], which concluded ForDisc ancestry determination was not always consistent, and the programs' recommended acceptance criteria did not separate correct and incorrect determinations. The authors concluded that the program does not perform to expectations and should be used with caution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Poster: Elliott and Collard 2012 Going head to head: FORDISC vs CRANID in the determination of ancestry from craniometric data|url = http://meeting.physanth.org/program/2012/session08/elliott-2012-going-head-to-head-fordisc-vs-cranid-in-the-determination-of-ancestry-from-craniometric-data.html|website = meeting.physanth.org|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2333">'''Glenn Walters''' is an [[United States|American]] [[forensic]] [[psychologist]] and Associate Professor of Criminal Justice at [[Kutztown University]] in [[Pennsylvania]]. He worked for three decades in [[federal government]] as a clinical psychologist and [[Drug rehabilitation|drug program]] coordinator for military and federal prison inmates. He has published widely in [[criminology]], including [[addiction]]. He has developed a Psychological Inventory of Criminal Thinking Styles (PICTS). He argues that criminality is best understood and prevented by examining how it develops within the context of a person's life, and has critiqued genetic studies via metaanalytic research.

His earlier work focused on recidivist criminals within the justice system with failed lives, describing them as lazy and motivated primarily be fear; it has been pointed out that this does not seem to apply to those who manage to be successful, particularly those in [[organized crime]].

Walter has more recently sought to develop an overarching explanation of why any person develops into a certain [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] - a patterned set of rules, roles, rituals and relationships - described as falling within four broad groupings: leader, follower, rebel, and disabled.

The '''Greater Magaric languages''' are a branch of [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] proposed by Nicolas Schorer (2016). Schorer (2016: 286-287) considers Greater Magaric to be closely related to the [[Kiranti languages]] as part of a greater ''[[Himalayish|Himalayish]]'' branch, and does not consider Himalayish to be particularly closely related to the [[Tibetic languages]], which include [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]] and the [[Tamangic languages]].

[[James A. Matisoff|Matisoff]] (2015: xxxii, 1123-1127), in the final print release of the ''Sino-Tibetan Etymological Dictionary and Thesaurus'' (STEDT), has also proposed a [[Kham language|Kham]]-[[Magaric languages|Magar]]-[[Chepangic languages|Chepang]] language group.&lt;ref name="Matisoff2015"&gt;Matisoff, James A. 2015.

The '''Kuravar''' is an ethnic [[Tamil people|Tamil]] community native to the [[Kurinji]] mountain region of [[southern India]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Etymology==
The ''Kuravan" is a Tamil word which means "uyarnthavan" or "Thalaivan" means "Leader"

==History==

During [[British rule in India]] they were placed under [[Criminal Tribes Act]] 1871, hence stigmatized for a long time, after Independence however they were [[Denotified tribes of India|denotified]] in 1952, though the stigma continues.&lt;ref name=dis&gt;{{cite web

The whole population of Tamil Nadu knows that Narikuravar best Community as Tribal Gypsies but the subsequent Governments denied that fact and helped the reservation mechanism which systematically oppressed this group of people who were already been oppressed for ages by their own Tamil people. This has led to protests and resentment from the community.&lt;ref name="narikorava_sc_1"&gt;{{cite news | last= | first= | title= Narikuravas running from pillar to post for ST status | date=January 14, 2005 | url =http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2005/01/14/stories/2005011416090300.htm | work =The Hindu: Friday Review | accessdate = 2008-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Narikuravas are yet to be recognized as a scheduled tribe.

'''Lucy Stone''' (August 13, 1818 &amp;ndash; October 18, 1893) was a prominent U.S. [[orator]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], and [[suffragist]], and a vocal advocate and organizer promoting [[women's rights movement|rights for women]].&lt;ref&gt;Electronic Oberlin Group.

Retrieved on May 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, Stone became the first woman from Massachusetts to earn a college degree. She spoke out for women's rights and against slavery at a time when women were discouraged and prevented from public speaking. Stone was known for using her birth name after [[marriage]], the custom being for women to take their husband's surname.

Stone's organizational activities for the cause of women's rights yielded tangible gains in the difficult political environment of the 19th century. Stone helped initiate the first [[National Women's Rights Convention]] in Worcester, Massachusetts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Suffrage to the Senate|last=O'Dea Schenken|first=Suzanne|publisher=ABC-CLIO, Inc.|year=1999|isbn=0-87436-960-6|location=California|pages=645}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she supported and sustained it annually, along with a number of other local, state and regional activist conventions. Stone spoke in front of a number of legislative bodies to promote laws giving more rights to women. She assisted in establishing the [[Woman's National Loyal League]] to help pass the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] and thereby abolish slavery, after which she helped form the [[American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA)|American Woman Suffrage Association]] (AWSA), which built support for a woman suffrage Constitutional amendment by winning woman suffrage at the state and local levels.

Stone wrote extensively about a wide range of women's rights, publishing and distributing speeches by herself and others, and convention proceedings.

Retrieved on May 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Woman's Journal]]'', a weekly periodical that she founded and promoted, Stone aired both her own and differing views about women's rights.

==Early life and influences==
Lucy Stone was born on August 13, 1818, on her family's farm at Coy's Hill in West Brookfield, Massachusetts. She was the eighth of nine children born to Hannah Matthews and Francis Stone; she grew up with three brothers and three sisters, two siblings having died before her own birth. Another member of the Stone household was Sarah Barr, "Aunt Sally" to the children– a sister of Francis Stone who had been abandoned by her husband and left dependent upon her brother. Although farm life was hard work for all and Francis Stone tightly managed the family resources, Lucy remembered her childhood as one of "opulence," the farm producing all the food the family wanted and enough extra to trade for the few store-bought goods they needed.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Stone recalled that "There was only one will in our family, and that was my father's," she described the family government characteristic of her day. Hannah Stone earned  a modest income through selling eggs and cheese but was denied any control over that money, sometimes denied money to purchase things Francis considered trivial. Believing she had a right to her own earnings, Hannah sometimes stole coins from his purse or secretly sold a cheese. As a child, Lucy resented instances of what she saw as her father's unfair management of the family's money. But she later came to realize that custom was to blame, and the injustice only demonstrated "the necessity of making custom right, if it must rule."&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 11, 282 note 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the examples of her mother, Aunt Sally, and a neighbor neglected by her husband and left destitute, Stone early learned that women were at the mercy of their husbands' good will. When she came across the biblical passage, "and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee," she was distraught over what appeared to be divine sanction of women's subjugation, but then reasoned that the injunction applied only to wives. Resolving to "call no man my master," she determined to keep control over her own life by never marrying, obtaining the highest education she could, and earning her own livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 11-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerr writes "Stone's personality was striking: her unquestioning willingness to take responsibility for other peoples actions; her "workaholic" habits; her self doubt; her desire for control."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kerr|first=Andrea|date=1994|title=Lucy Stone: Speaking Out for Equality|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=99|pages=653|doi=10.2307/2167467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching at "a woman's pay"===
At age 16, Stone began teaching in district schools, as her brothers and sister, Rhoda, also did. Her beginning pay of $1.00 a day was much lower than that of male teachers, and when she substituted for her brother, Bowman, one winter, she received less pay than he received. When she protested to the school committee that she had taught all the subjects Bowman had, it replied that they could give her "only a woman's pay." Lower pay for women was one of the arguments cited by those promoting the hiring of women as teachers: "To make education universal, it must be at moderate expense, and women can afford to teach for one-half, or even less, the salary which men would ask."&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Woloch, Women and the American Experience, New York: Knopf, 1984, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Stone's salary increased along with the size of her schools, until she finally received $16 a month, it was always lower than the male rate.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, 1992, p. 23; Million, 2003, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "woman question"===
In 1836, Stone began reading newspaper reports of a controversy raging throughout Massachusetts that some referred to as the "woman question" – what was woman's proper role in society; should she assume an active and public role in the reform movements of the day? Developments within that controversy over the next several years shaped her evolving philosophy on women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

A debate over whether women were entitled to a political voice had begun when many women responded to [[William Lloyd Garrison]]'s appeal to circulate antislavery petitions and sent thousands of signatures to Congress only to have them rejected, in part because women had sent them. Women abolitionists responded by holding a convention in New York City to expand their petitioning efforts, and declaring that "as certain rights and duties are common to all moral beings," they would no longer remain within limits prescribed by "corrupt custom and a perverted application of Scripture." After sisters Angelina and Sarah Grimke began speaking to audiences of men and women, instead of women only as was acceptable, a state convention of Congregational ministers issued a Pastoral letter condemning women's assuming "the place of man as a public reformer" and "itinerat[ing] in the character of public lecturers and teachers." Stone attended the convention as a spectator, and was so angered by the letter that she determined "if ever [I] had anything to say in public, [I] would say it, and all the more because of that pastoral letter."&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 27-30; Kerr, 1992, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone read [[Sarah Moore Grimké|Sarah Grimke]]'s "Letters on the Province of Woman" (later republished as "Letters on the Equality of the Sexes"), and told a brother they only reinforced her resolve "to call no man master." She drew from these "Letters" when writing college essays and her later women's rights lectures.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 36, 68, 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having determined to obtain the highest education she could, Stone enrolled at [[Mount Holyoke College|Mount Holyoke]] Female Seminary in 1839, at the age of 21. But she was so disappointed in Mary Lyons' intolerance of antislavery and women's rights that she withdrew after only one term. The very next month she enrolled at Wesleyan Academy (later Wilbraham &amp; Monson Academy),&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; which she found more to her liking: "It was decided by a large majority in our literary society the other day," she reported to a brother, "that ladies ought to mingle in politics, go to Congress, etc. etc." Stone read a newspaper account of how a Connecticut antislavery meeting had denied the right to speak or vote to [[Abby Kelley]], recently hired as an antislavery agent to work in that state. Refusing to relinquish her right, Kelley had defiantly raised her hand every time a vote was taken. "I admire the calm and noble bearing of Abby K," Stone wrote to a brother, "and cannot but wish there were more kindred spirits."&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell, 1930, pp. 39-40; Million, 2003, 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years later, Stone followed Kelley's example. In 1843, a deacon was expelled from Stone's church for his antislavery activities, which included supporting Kelley by hosting her at his home and driving her to lectures that she gave in the vicinity. When the first vote for expulsion was taken, Stone raised her hand in his defense. The minister discounted her vote, saying that, though she was a member of the church, she was not a voting member. Like Kelley, she stubbornly raised her hand for each of the remaining five votes.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing a year at coeducational Monson Academy in the summer of 1841, Stone learned that Oberlin Collegiate Institute in Ohio had become the first college in the nation to admit women and had bestowed college degrees on three women. Stone enrolled at Quaboag Seminary in neighboring Warren, where she read Virgil and Sophocles and studied Latin and Greek grammar in preparation for Oberlin's  entrance examinations.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, 1992, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oberlin==
In August 1843, just after she turned 25, Stone traveled by train, steamship, and stagecoach to [[Oberlin College]] in Ohio, the country's first college to admit both women and [[African American]]s. She entered the college believing that women should vote and assume political office, that women should study the classic professions and that women should be able to speak their minds in a public forum. Oberlin College did not share all of these sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;Schenken, 1999, p. 644.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her third year at Oberlin, Stone befriended [[Antoinette Brown]], an abolitionist and suffragist who came to Oberlin in 1845 to study to become a minister.&lt;ref&gt;Oberlin College. Electronic Oberlin Group. Oberlin: Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow... Chapter 10. [http://www.oberlin.edu/external/EOG/OYTT/ch10.html ''Oberlin Women''.] Retrieved March 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Stone and Brown would eventually marry abolitionist brothers and thus become sisters-in-law.

===Equal pay strike===
Stone hoped to earn most of her college expenses through teaching in one of the institute's lower departments. But because of its policy against employing first-year students as teachers, the only work Stone could get other than teaching at district schools during the winter break was house keeping chores through the school's manual labor program. For this she was paid three cents an hour—less than half what male students received for their work in the program. Among measures taken to reduce her expenses, Stone prepared her own meals in her dormitory room. In 1844 Stone was given a position teaching arithmetic in the Ladies Department, but again received reduced pay because of her sex.

Oberlin's compensation policies required Stone to do twice the labor a male student had to do to pay the same costs. Stone frequently rose at two o'clock to fit in work and study, and she found her health declining. In February 1845, having decided to submit to the injustice no longer, she asked the Faculty Board for the same pay given two lesser-experienced male colleagues. When her request was denied, she resigned her position. Pleading with the faculty to restore Stone, her former students said they would pay Stone "what was right" if the college would not. Stone had planned to borrow money from her father when funds ran out, but Francis Stone, moved by his daughter's description of her struggles, promised to provide money when needed. Help from home was not needed, however, because after three months of pressure, the faculty yielded and hired Stone back, paying both her and other women student teachers at the same rate paid male student teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public speaking===

In February 1846, Stone intimated to Abby Kelley Foster that she was thinking of becoming a public speaker,&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; but not until the following summer did a storm of controversy over Foster's speaking at Oberlin decide the matter for her. Faculty opposition to Foster ignited impassioned discussion of women's rights among the students, especially of woman's right to speak in public, which Stone vigorously defended in a joint meeting of the men's and women's literary societies. She followed that campus demonstration by making her first public speech at Oberlin's August 1 commemoration of Emancipation in the West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1846, Stone informed her family of her intention to become a woman's rights lecturer. Her brothers were at once supportive, her father encouraged her to do what she considered her duty, but her mother and only remaining sister begged her to reconsider. To her mother's fears that she would be reviled, Stone said she knew she would be disesteemed and even hated, but she must "pursue that course of conduct which, to me, appears best calculated to promote the highest good of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 73-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone then tried to gain practical speaking experience. Although women students could debate each other in their literary society, it was considered inappropriate for them to participate in oral exercises with men; women members of the collegiate rhetoric class were expected to learn by observing their male classmates. So Stone and first-year student [[Antoinette Brown]], who also wanted to develop skill in public speaking, organized an off-campus women's debating club. After gaining a measure of competence, they sought and received permission to debate each other before Stone's rhetoric class. The debate attracted a large student audience as well as attention from the Faculty Board, which thereupon formally banned women's oral exercises in coeducational classes.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Stone accepted a challenge from a former editor of a county newspaper to a public debate on women's rights, and she soundly defeated him.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; She then submitted a petition to the Faculty Board, signed by most members of her graduating class, asking that women chosen to write graduation essays be permitted to read them themselves, as men so honored did, instead of having them read by faculty members. When the Faculty Board refused and Stone was elected to write an essay, she declined, saying she could not support a principle that denied women "the privilege of being co-laborers with men in any sphere to which their ability makes them adequate."&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, p. 82; Hays, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone received her baccalaureate degree from Oberlin College on August 25, 1847, becoming the first female college graduate from Massachusetts.

==Antislavery apprenticeship==
[[File:Stone facing left.jpg|thumb|Lucy Stone as a young woman]]
Stone gave her first public speeches on women's rights in the fall of 1847, first at her brother Bowman's church in [[Gardner, Massachusetts]], and a little later in neighboring [[Warren, Massachusetts|Warren]].&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, 1992, p.28; Million, 2003, pp. 86-87.&lt;/ref&gt; Stone became a lecturing agent for the [[Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society]] in June 1848, persuaded by Abby Kelley Foster that the experience would give her the speaking practice she still felt she needed before beginning her women's rights campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Stone immediately proved to be an effective speaker, reported to wield extraordinary persuasive power over her audiences. She was described as "a little meek-looking Quakerish body, with the sweetest, modest manners and yet as unshrinking and self-possessed as a loaded canon." One of her assets, in addition to a storytelling ability that could move audiences to tears or laughter as she willed, was said to be an unusual voice that contemporaries compared to a "silver bell," and of which it was said, "no more perfect instrument had ever been bestowed upon a speaker."&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to helping Stone develop as an orator, the antislavery agency introduced her to a network of progressive reformers within the Garrisonian wing of the abolition movement who assisted her women's rights work. In the fall of 1848, she received an invitation from Phoebe Hathaway of Farmington, New York, to lecture for the women who had organized the [[Seneca Falls Convention|Seneca Falls women's rights convention]] and the [[Rochester Women's Rights Convention of 1848|Rochester women's rights convention]] earlier that summer. These rights convention provided continuity for the woman's rights movement, even though no official organization was actually formed prior to the Civil War. Most of the well-known leaders at the time attended these conventions, except for those who were ill or sick. The best-known of them, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and Lucy Stone, met, and worked together harmoniously as they wrote, discussed, and circulated petitions for the woman's rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;Riegel, Robert E. "The Split of Feminist Movement in 1869." The Mississippi Valley Historical Review, vol. 49, no. 3, 1962, pp. 485-496.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Stone accepted and expected to begin working for them in the fall of 1849, the agency never materialized.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 99, 102.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1849, Stone was invited to lecture for the [[Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society]], and Lucretia Mott took advantage of her presence to hold Pennsylvania's first women's rights meeting on May 4, 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of abolitionists, Stone conducted Massachusetts' first petition campaigns for the right of women to vote and hold public office. Wendell Phillips drafted the first petitions and accompanying appeals for circulation, and William Lloyd Garrison published them in the Liberator for readers to copy and circulate. When Stone sent petitions to the legislature in February 1850, over half were from towns where she had lectured.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 99-100, 293n. 6; 102-03, 293n. 6, ''Liberator'', Dec. 14, 1849, Feb. 1, 1850; Million, pp. 111-12, ''Liberator'', Jan. 24, 1851.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Woman's Rights Convention==
In April 1850, the [[Ohio Women's Convention at Salem in 1850|Ohio Women's Convention]] met in Salem, Ohio a few weeks before a state convention met to revise the Ohio state constitution. The women's convention sent a communication to the constitutional convention requesting that the new constitution secure the same political and legal rights for women that were guaranteed to men.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu01stanuoft#page/104/mode/2up p. 105].&lt;/ref&gt;  Stone sent a letter praising their initiative and said, "Massachusetts ought to have taken the lead in the work you are now doing, but if she chooses to linger, let her young sisters of the West set her a worthy example; and if the 'Pilgrim spirit is not dead,' we'll pledge Massachusetts to follow her."&lt;ref&gt;"From Lucy Stone," ''Anti-Slavery Bugle,'' 27 Apr 1850; ''National Anti-Slavery Standard,'' May 9, 1850.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the leaders asked Stone and Lucretia Mott to address the constitutional convention on their behalf, but believing such appeals should come from residents of the state, they declined.&lt;ref&gt;"Women's Deputation to Columbus," ''Anti-Slavery Bugle,'' June 1, 1850; Stone letter to "Sallie B. Gove and Others," ''Anti-Slavery Bugle,'' June 22, 1850.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's rights conventions up to this point had been organized on a regional or state basis.  During the annual convention of the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] in Boston in 1850, with the support of Garrison and other abolitionists, Stone and [[Paulina Wright Davis]] posted a notice for a meeting to consider the possibility of organizing a women's rights convention on a national basis.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, 1992, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;
The meeting was held at Boston's Melodeon Hall on May 30, 1850.  Davis presided while Stone presented the proposal to the large and responsive audience and served as secretary.  Seven women were appointed to organize the convention, with Davis and Stone assigned to conduct the correspondence needed to solicit signatures to the call and recruit speakers and attendance.&lt;ref&gt;"Women's Rights Convention," ''Liberator,'' [http://theliberatorfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/The-Liberator-1850-06-07-Page-3.png June 7, 1850,  p. 91]&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months before the convention, Stone contracted typhoid fever while traveling in Indiana and nearly died.  The protracted nature of Stone's illness left Davis as the principal organizer of the first [[National Women's Rights Convention]], which met on October 23–24, 1850, in Brinley Hall in Worcester, Massachusetts with an attendance of about a thousand.&lt;ref&gt;McMillen, 2008, pp. 106–109&lt;/ref&gt;
Stone was able to attend the Worchester convention, but frail health limited her participation, and she made no formal address until the closing session.&lt;ref&gt;Stone's speech was not published in the official ''Proceedings'' and only briefly summarized in newspaper reports. But when Susan B. Anthony later credited Stone with converting her to the cause of woman suffrage, (''Report of the International Council of Women,'' Washington, D.C.: National Woman Suffrage Association, 1888, p. 47) she alluded to a phrase that appeared in the published accounts of that speech, and a legend arose that Anthony's conversion resulted from her reading Stone's speech at the first national convention. For a more probable dating of Anthony's conversion, see Million, 2003, pp. 132, 296 note 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention decided not to establish a formal association, but to exist as an annual convention with a standing committee to arrange its meetings, publish its proceedings, and execute adopted plans of action. Stone was appointed to the Central Committee of nine women and nine men.&lt;ref&gt;"Women's Rights Convention," ''National Anti-Slavery Standard,'' Oct. 31, 1850; ''Proceedings of the Woman's Rights Convention, Held at Worcester, October 23rd and 24th, 1850,'' Boston: Prentiss and Sawyer, 1851, pp. 16-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The following spring, she became secretary of the committee and, except for one year, retained that position until 1858. As secretary, Stone took a leading part in organizing and setting the agenda for the national conventions throughout the decade.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 116, 143, 146, 172-73, 225-277, 235, 239-42, 250-51, 260, 263-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Woman's rights orator==

At right, jeering men spray her with a hose, and another man displays a book titled "St. Paul Sayeth."]]
In May 1851, while in Boston attending the New England Anti-Slavery Society's annual meeting, Stone went to the exhibit of Hiram Powers's statue The Greek Slave. She was so moved by the sculpture that when she addressed the meeting that evening, she poured out her heart about the statue being emblematic of all enchained womanhood. Stone said the society's general agent, Samuel May, Jr., reproached her for speaking on women's rights at an antislavery meeting, and she replied, "I was a woman before I was an abolitionist. I must speak for women."&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the International Council of Women,'' Washington, D.C., National Woman Suffrage Association, 1888, pp. 333-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, Stone notified May that she intended to lecture on women's rights full-time and would not be available for antislavery work.&lt;ref name="Million, 2003, p. 112"&gt;Million, 2003, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Stone launched her career as an independent women's rights lecturer on October 1, 1851. When May continued to press antislavery work upon her, she agreed to lecture for the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society on Sundays. Arranging women's rights lectures around these engagements, she used pay for her antislavery work to defray expenses of her independent lecturing until she felt confident enough to charge admission.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dress reform===
[[File:Lucy Stone in bloomers.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An engraving of Lucy Stone wearing [[Bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]] was published in 1853.]]
When Stone resumed lecturing in the fall of 1851, she wore a new style of dress that she had adopted during her winter convalescence,  consisting of a loose, short jacket and a pair of baggy trousers under a skirt that fell a few inches below the knees.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 114-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The dress was a product of the health-reform movement and intended to replace the fashionable French dress of a tight bodice over a whalebone-fitted corset, and a skirt that dragged several inches on the floor, worn over several layers of starched petticoats with straw or horsehair sewn into the hems. Ever since the fall of 1849, when the [https://archive.org/details/watercurejournal12newy] ''Water-Cure Journal'' urged women to invent a style of dress that would allow them the free use of their legs, women across the country had been wearing some form of pants and short skirt, generally called the "Turkish costume" or the "American dress."&lt;ref&gt;''Water-Cure Journal'', Oct., Dec. 1849; Jan., Feb., June 1850.&lt;/ref&gt; Most wore it as a walking or gardening dress, but a letter writer to the National Woman's Rights Convention urged women to adopt it as common attire.&lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the Woman's Rights Convention, Held at Worcester, October 23rd and 24th, 1850''. Boston: Prentiss and Sawyer, pp. 76-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the spring of 1851, women in several states were wearing the dress in public.&lt;ref&gt;''Lily,'' March, May, June 1851.&lt;/ref&gt; In March, Amelia Bloomer, editor of the temperance newspaper ''The Lily,'' announced that she was wearing it and printed a description of her dress along with instructions on how to make it. Soon, newspapers had dubbed it the "Bloomer dress", and the name stuck.&lt;ref&gt;Noun, Louise R., ''Strong-Minded Women: The Emergence of the Woman Suffrage Movement in Iowa,'' Iowa State University Press, 1986, pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bloomer became a fashion fad during the following months, as women from Toledo to New York City and Lowell, Massachusetts, held reform-dress social events and festivals. Supporters gathered signatures to a "Declaration of Independence from the Despotism of Parisian Fashion" and organized dress-reform societies. A few Garrisonian supporters of women's rights took prominent part in these activities, and one offered silk to any of his friends who would make it into a short skirt and trousers for a public dress. Stone accepted the offer.&lt;ref name="Million, 2003, p. 115"&gt;Million, 2003, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
When Stone lectured in the dress in the fall of 1851, hers was the first Bloomer most of her audiences had ever seen. But by then, the dress had become controversial. Although newspapers had initially praised the practicality of the new style, they soon turned to ridicule and condemnation, now viewing the trousers as a usurpation of the symbol of male authority.&lt;ref name="Million, 2003, p. 115"/&gt; Many women retreated in the face of criticism, but Stone continued to wear the short dress exclusively for the next three years. She also wore her hair short, cut just below her jaw line. After Stone lectured in New York City in April 1853, the report of her speeches in the ''Illustrated News'' was accompanied by this engraving of Stone in the Bloomer dress.&lt;ref&gt;"Lucy Stone," ''Illustrated News,'' May 28, 1853.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone found the short skirt convenient during her travels and defended it against those who said it was a distraction that hurt the women's rights cause. Nevertheless, she disliked the instant attention it drew whenever she arrived in a new place. In the fall of 1854, she added a dress a few inches longer, for occasional use.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 168-69.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, she abandoned the dress altogether and was not involved in the formation of a National Dress Reform Association in February 1856. Her resumption of long skirts drew the condemnation of such dress-reform leaders as Gerrit Smith and Lydia Sayer Hasbrouk, who accused her of sacrificing principle for the sake of pleasing a husband.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 217-18, 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expulsion from church===

Stone's anti-slavery work included harsh criticism of churches that refused to condemn slavery.  Her own church in West Brookfield, the First Congregational Church of West Brookfield, was one of those, having expelled a deacon for anti-slavery activities.  In 1851, the church expelled Stone herself.&lt;ref name="Million, 2003, p. 112"/&gt; Stone had already moved significantly away from that church's Trinitarian doctrines.  While at Oberlin, Stone had arranged for her friend Abby Kelley Foster and her new husband, [[Stephen Symonds Foster]], to speak there on the abolition of slavery.  Afterwards, [[Charles Grandison Finney|Charles Finney]], a prominent professor of theology at Oberlin, denounced the Fosters for their [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] beliefs.  Intrigued, Stone began to engage in classroom discussions about the Trinitarian-Unitarian controversy&lt;ref&gt;[[Trinitarianism]] is the traditional Christian belief that God is three persons in one, with Jesus one of those three. [[Unitarianism]] holds that God is one and that Jesus was a great teacher but not God.&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately decided that she was a Unitarian.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Expelled from her childhood church, she affiliated with the [[Unitarian Universalist Association|Unitarian church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/biographies/lucy-stone|title=Lucy Stone|author=Susan Ritchie|date=February 17, 2014|publisher=Harvard Square Library|accessdate=March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Issues of divorce===

Before her own marriage, Stone felt that women should be allowed to divorce drunken husbands, to formally end a "loveless marriage" so that "a true love may grow up in the soul of the injured one from the full enjoyment of which no legal bond had a right to keep her&lt;ref name=Kerr156&gt;Kerr, 1992, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; ...Whatever is pure and holy, not only has a right to be, but it has a right also to be recognized, and further, I think it has no right not to be recognized."&lt;ref name=Hays169&gt;Hays, 1961, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Stone's friends often felt differently about the issue; "Nettee" Brown wrote to Stone in 1853 that she was not ready to accept the idea, even if both parties wanted divorce.&lt;ref name=Hays169/&gt; Stanton was less inclined to clerical orthodoxy; she was very much in favor of giving women the right to divorce,&lt;ref&gt;Hays, 1961, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; eventually coming to the view that the reform of marriage laws was more important than women's voting rights.&lt;ref name=Kerr156/&gt;

In the process of planning for women's rights conventions, Stone worked against Stanton to remove from any proposed platform the formal advocacy of divorce. Stone wished to keep the subject separate, to prevent the appearance of moral laxity.&lt;ref name=Kerr72&gt;Kerr, 1992, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; She pushed "for the right of woman to the control of her own person as a moral, intelligent, accountable being."&lt;ref name=Kerr72/&gt; Other rights were certain to fall into place after women were given control of their own bodies. Years later, Stone's position on divorce would change.

===Differences with Douglass===
In 1853, Stone drew large audiences with a lecture tour through several southern states.  Former slave [[Frederick Douglass]] rebuked her in his abolitionist newspaper, accusing her of achieving success by putting her anti-slavery principles aside and speaking only of women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, 1992, pp. 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; Douglass later found Stone at fault for speaking at a whites-only Philadelphia lecture hall, but Stone insisted that she had replaced her planned speech that day with an appeal to the audience to boycott the facility. It took years before the two were reconciled.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, 1992, pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western tour===
On October 14, 1853, following the National Woman's Rights Convention held in Cleveland, Ohio, Stone and Lucretia Mott addressed Cincinnati's first women's rights meeting, arranged by [[Henry Browne Blackwell|Henry Blackwell]], a local businessman from a family of capable women, who had taken an interest in Stone. After that successful meeting, Stone accepted Blackwell's offer to arrange a lecturing tour for her in the western states – considered then to be those west of Pennsylvania and Virginia. Over the following thirteen weeks, Stone gave over forty lectures in thirteen cities, during which a report to the ''New York Tribune'' said she was stirring the West on women's rights "as it is seldom stirred on any subject whatsoever." After four lectures in Louisville, Stone was begged to repeat the entire course and told she was having more effect there than she could have anywhere else. An Indianapolis newspaper reported that Stone "set about two-thirds of the women in the town crazy after women's rights and placed half the men in a similar predicament." St. Louis papers said her lectures attracted the largest crowds ever assembled there, filling the city's largest auditorium beyond its capacity of two thousand. Chicago papers praised her lectures as the best of the season, and said they were inspiring discussion and debate in the city's homes and meeting places. When Stone headed home in January, 1854, she left behind incalculable influence.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 158-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1854 through 1858, Stone lectured on women's rights in Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Cady Stanton would later write that "Lucy Stone was the first speaker who really stirred the nation's heart on the subject of woman's wrongs."&lt;ref&gt;''Eminent Women of the Age: Being Narratives of the Lives and Deeds of the Most Prominent Women of the Present Generation'', Hartford, Conn.: S.M. Betts &amp; Co., 1868, p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Petitioning and hearings==
[[File:Petition of E. Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Lucy Stone, and others (1865).jpg|thumbnail|right|Petition signed by E. Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Lucy Stone, and others]]

In addition to being the women's rights movement's most prominent spokesperson, Lucy Stone led the movement's petitioning efforts. She initiated petition efforts in New England and several other states and assisted the petitioning efforts of state and local organizations in New York, Ohio, and Indiana.

===Massachusetts===
After petitioning the Massachusetts legislature from 1849 through 1852 for the right of women to vote and serve in public office,&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 99-100, 102-03, 111-12, 292n. 23, 293n. 6; 102-03, 293n. 6; ''Liberator'', Dec. 14, 1849; Feb. 1, 1850; Jan. 24, 1851; Jan. 9 and 30, 1852.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Stone aimed her 1853 petitions at the convention that would meet on May 4, 1853, to revise the state constitution. Wendell Phillips drafted both the petition asking that the word "male" be stricken wherever it appeared in the constitution, and an appeal urging Massachusetts citizens to sign it. After canvassing the state for nine months, Stone sent the convention petitions bearing over five thousand signatures. On May 27, 1853, Stone and Phillips addressed the convention's Committee on Qualifications of Voters. In reporting Stone's hearing, the ''Liberator'' noted: "Never before, since the world was made, in any country, has woman publicly made her demand in the hall of legislation to be represented in her own person, and to have an equal part in framing the laws and determining the action of government."&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 131, 133-34, 135-38, 297 note 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multi-state campaigns===
Stone called a New England Woman's Rights Convention in Boston on June 2, 1854, to expand her petitioning efforts. The convention adopted her resolution for petitioning all six New England legislatures, as well as her proposed form of petition, and it appointed a committee in each state to organize the work.&lt;ref&gt;''Liberator'', May 26, 1854; ''Una'', July 1854; Million, 2003, p. 170, 171-72.&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech before the second New England Woman's Rights Convention, held in June 1855, Stone urged that one reason women needed suffrage was to protect any gains achieved, reminding them that "the next Legislature may undo all that the last have done for women." The convention adopted a resolution calling the ballot "woman's sword and shield; the means of achieving and protecting all other civil rights" and another urging the national convention to make suffrage petitioning its priority.&lt;ref&gt;''Reports on the Laws of New England, presented to the New England Meeting, Convened at the Melodeon, Sept. 19 &amp; 20, 1855,'' Woman's Rights Tracts, Boston Public Library; ''Una,'' June 1855, ''Lily'', Aug. 1, 1855; ''Boston Herald'', Sept. 19, 1855; ''Una'', Oct. 15, 1855; ''Lily,'' Nov. 15, 1855.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next National Woman's Rights Convention met in Cincinnati on October 17 and 18, 1855. It was here that Stone delivered impromptu remarks that became famous as her "disappointment" speech. When a heckler interrupted the proceedings, calling female speakers "a few disappointed women," Stone retorted that yes, she was indeed a "disappointed woman." "In education, in marriage, in religion, in everything, disappointment is the lot of woman. It shall be the business of my life to deepen this disappointment in every woman's heart until she bows down to it no longer."&lt;ref name=McMillen111&gt;McMillen, 2008, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; The convention adopted Stone's resolution calling for the circulation of petitions and saying it was "the duty of women in their respective States to ask the legislators for the elective franchise."&lt;ref&gt;"The National Convention," ''Lily'', Nov. 15, 1855.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the convention, suffrage petitioning took place in the New England states, New York, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nebraska, with resultant legislative hearings or action in Nebraska and Wisconsin. Amelia Bloomer, recently moved to Iowa near the Nebraska border, took up the work in that area,&lt;ref&gt;"Letter from Mrs. Bloomer," ''Woman's Advocate'', April 5, 1856, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; while the Indiana Woman's Rights Society, at least one of whose officers was at the Cincinnati convention, directed the work in Indiana. Stone had helped launch the New York campaign at a state woman's rights convention in Saratoga Springs in August,&lt;ref&gt;''Lily,'' Sept. 15, 1855, p. 134; ''Una,'' September 15, 1855, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the Cleveland convention recruited workers for it, as well as for the work in Illinois, Michigan and Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Stone to Susan B. Anthony, Nov. 15, 1855, Blackwell Family Papers, Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; Stone took charge of the work in Ohio, her new home state, drafting its petition, placing it in Ohio newspapers and circulating it during lectures across southern Ohio while her recruit worked in the northern part of the state. Stone also lectured in Illinois and Indiana in support of the petition drives there and personally introduced the work in Wisconsin, where she found volunteers to circulate the petition and legislators to introduce them in both houses of the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the national convention of 1856, Stone presented a new strategy suggested by [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] to send a memorial to the various state legislatures signed by the officers of the National Woman's Rights Convention. Antoinette Brown had married [[Samuel Charles Blackwell]] on January 24, 1856, becoming Stone's sister-in-law in the process.&lt;ref name="Lasser, 1987, p. 147"&gt;Lasser, 1987, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Stone, Brown Blackwell and Ernestine Rose were appointed a committee to carry out the plan. Stone drafted and printed the appeal, and Brown Blackwell mailed it to twenty-five state legislatures. Indiana and Pennsylvania referred the memorial to select committees, while both Massachusetts and Maine granted hearings. On March 6, 1857, Stone, Wendell Phillips and James Freeman Clarke addressed the Judiciary Committee of the Massachusetts senate, and on March 10, Stone and Phillips addressed a select committee of the Maine legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Stone report to the 1858 National Woman's Rights Convention, ''New York Times,'' May 15, 1858; Million, 2003, pp. 228, 230-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 4, 1856, in [[Viroqua, Wisconsin]], Stone gave the first women's rights and anti-slavery speech delivered by a woman in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistoricalmarkers.com/2017/04/lucy-stone.html|title=Lucy Stone|website=www.wisconsinhistoricalmarkers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax protest===
In January 1858, Stone staged a highly publicized protest that took the issue of taxation without representation across the nation. The previous summer she and Blackwell had purchased a house in Orange, New Jersey, and when the first tax bill came, Stone returned it unpaid with the explanation that taxing women while denying them the right to vote was a violation of America's founding principles. On January 22, 1858, the city auctioned some of her household goods to pay the tax and attendant court costs.&lt;ref&gt;Stone to Abraham Mandeville, 18 Dec. 1857, in ''Orange Journal,'' Jan. 16, 1858; ''Liberator,'' Jan. 29, 1858.&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, Stone and Blackwell spoke on taxation without representation before two large meetings in Orange, and circulated petitions asking the New Jersey legislature for woman suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;''Newark Daily Advertiser,'' Feb. 9, 1858; ''Liberator,'' Feb. 19, 1858.&lt;/ref&gt; Stone's protest inspired other tax-paying women to action: some followed her example and refused to pay taxes, with one case reaching the Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1863, while others went to the polls to demand their right as tax-payers to vote.&lt;ref&gt;''Sibyl,'' Feb. 1, 1858; Million, 2003, 246, 258-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
{{Further|Henry Browne Blackwell}}
Henry Blackwell began a two-year courtship of Stone in the summer of 1853. Stone told him she did not wish to marry because she did not want to surrender control over her life and would not assume the legal position occupied by a married woman. Blackwell maintained that despite the law, couples could create a marriage of equal partnership, governed by their mutual agreement. They could also take steps to protect the wife against unjust laws, such as placing her assets in the hands of a trustee. He also believed that marriage would allow each partner to accomplish more than he or she could alone, and to show how he could help advance Stone's work, he arranged her highly successful western lecturing tour of 1853.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 145, 157-162, 182-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Over an eighteen-month courtship conducted primarily through correspondence, Stone and Blackwell discussed the nature of marriage, actual and ideal, as well as their own natures and suitability for marriage. Stone gradually fell in love and in November 1854 agreed to marry Blackwell.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 182-85, 187-88.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Young Henry B Blackwell.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Browne Blackwell]]]]
Stone and Blackwell developed a private agreement aimed at preserving and protecting Stone's financial independence and personal liberty. In monetary matters, they agreed that the marriage be like a business partnership, with the partners being "joint proprietors of everything except the results of previous labors." Neither would have claim to lands belonging to the other, nor any obligation for the other's costs of holding them. While married and living together they would share earnings, but if they should separate, they would relinquish claim to the other's subsequent earnings. Each would have the right to will their property to whomever they pleased unless they had children.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell to Stone, Feb. 12, 1854, and Dec. 22, 1854, in Wheeler, 1981, pp. 76, 108-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Over Blackwell's objections, Stone refused to be supported and insisted on paying half of their mutual expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell to Stone, Dec. 22, 1854, [Aug. 28, 1855], and Feb. 7, 1856, in Wheeler, 1981, pp. 110, 144, 155-56; Blackwell to Stone, Aug. 29, 1855, quoted in Million, 2003, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to financial independence, Stone and Blackwell agreed that each would enjoy personal independence and autonomy: "Neither partner shall attempt to fix the residence, employment, or habits of the other, nor shall either partner feel bound to live together any longer than is agreeable to both." During their discussion of marriage, Stone had given Blackwell a copy of Henry C. Wright's book ''Marriage and Parentage; Or, The Reproductive Element in Man, as a Means to His Elevation and Happiness,''&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Henry C., ''Marriage and Parentage; Or, The Reproductive Element in Man, as a Means to His Elevation and Happiness'', 2d ed., 1855.&lt;/ref&gt; and asked him to accept its principles as what she considered the relationship between husband and wife should be.&lt;ref&gt;Stone to Blackwell, April 23, [1854], in Wheeler, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Wright proposed that because women bore the results of sexual intercourse, wives should govern a couple's marital relations. In accordance with that view, Blackwell agreed that Stone would choose "when, where and how often" she would "become a mother."&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell to Stone, December 22, 1854, in Wheeler, p. 109-10.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this private agreement, Blackwell drew up a protest of laws, rules, and customs that conferred superior rights on husbands and, as part of the wedding ceremony, pledged never to avail himself of those laws.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell to Stone, Dec. 22, 1854, and Jan. 3 [1855], in Wheeler, 1981, pp. 108, 115-16, 135-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The wedding took place at Stone's home in West Brookfield, Massachusetts, on  May 1, 1855, with Stone's close friend and co-worker [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]] officiating. Higginson sent a copy of Stone and Blackwell's Protest to the ''Worcester Spy'', and from there it spread across the country. While some commentators viewed it as a protest against marriage itself, others agreed that no woman should resign her legal existence without such formal protest against the despotism that forced her to forgo marriage and motherhood or submit to the degradation in which law placed a married woman. It inspired other couples to make similar protests part of their wedding ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 195-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Keeping her name===
Stone viewed the tradition of wives abandoning their own surname to assume that of their husbands as a manifestation of the legal annihilation of a married woman's identity. Immediately after her marriage, with the agreement of her husband, she continued to sign correspondence as "Lucy Stone" or "Lucy Stone – only."&lt;ref&gt;Stone note appended to Henry B. Blackwell to Augustus O. Moore, May 26, 1855; Stone to Susan B. Anthony, May 30, 1855; Stone to Antoinette L. Brown, Aug. 18, 1855, all in Blackwell Family Papers, Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; But during the summer, Blackwell tried to register the deed for property Stone purchased in Wisconsin, and the registrar insisted she sign it as "Lucy Stone Blackwell." The couple consulted Blackwell's friend, [[Salmon P. Chase]], a Cincinnati lawyer and future Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, who was not immediately able to answer their question about the legality of her name. So while continuing to sign her name as Lucy Stone in private correspondence, for eight months she signed her name as Lucy Stone Blackwell on public documents and allowed herself to be so identified in convention proceedings and newspaper reports. But upon receiving assurance from Chase that no law required a married woman to change her name, Stone made a public announcement at the May 7, 1856, convention of the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] in Boston that her name remained Lucy Stone.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 196, 202, 225-26, 304n. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, when Boston women were granted the franchise in school elections, Stone registered to vote. But officials notified her that she would not be allowed to vote unless she added "Blackwell" to her signature. This she refused to do, and so she was not able to vote. Because her time and energy were consumed with suffrage work, she did not challenge the action in a court of law.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, 1992, pp. 203-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
Stone and Blackwell had one daughter, [[Alice Stone Blackwell]], born September 14, 1857, who became a leader of the suffrage movement and wrote the first biography of her mother, ''Lucy Stone: Pioneer Woman Suffragist.''&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell, Alice Stone.

==Waning activism==
After her marriage, from the summer of 1855 to the summer of 1857, Stone continued a full lecturing, petitioning, and organizing schedule.
In January 1856, Stone was accused in court, and spoke in defense of a rumor put forward by the prosecution that Stone gave a knife to former slave [[Margaret Garner]], on trial for the killing of her own child to prevent it from being enslaved. Stone was said to have slipped the prisoner the knife so that Garner could kill herself if she was forced to return to slavery. Stone was referred to by the court as "Mrs. Lucy Stone Blackwell" and was asked if she wanted to defend herself; she preferred to address the assembly off the record after adjournment,&lt;ref&gt;Project Gutenberg.

How then could I blame her for wishing her child to find freedom with God and the angels, where no chains are?"&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Avery F.; Radway, Janice. [https://books.google.com/books?id=LbaHaN4BhEQC&amp;pg=PA157 ''Ghostly Matters''], University of Minnesota Press, 1997, pp. 157–158. {{ISBN|978-0-8166-5446-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The birth of her daughter in September 1857, however, began to reduce the level of her activism. Stone had made preliminary arrangements for the 1857 national convention to be held in Providence, but because she would not be able to attend it, she handed responsibility to Susan B. Anthony and Thomas Wentworth Higginson. When the [[Panic of 1857]] disrupted Anthony's plan to move the convention to Chicago, Stone made the announcement that the next National Woman's Rights Convention would be in May 1858.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 239-42.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony helped Stone arrange the 1858 convention and then took sole responsibility for the 1859 meeting. Elizabeth Cady Stanton took charge of the 1860 convention.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 250-51, 260, 263-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone hired a nursemaid to help care for her daughter, who was in poor health for several years, but she didn't trust her ability to provide proper care when Stone was absent. Stone eventually withdrew from most public work to stay at home with her child.  She resigned from the Central Committee, which organized the annual women's rights conventions. She began to suffer from self-doubt and a lack of drive in addition to the debilitating headaches that had plagued her for years.  She made only two public appearances during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (1861—1865): to attend the founding convention of the [[Women's Loyal National League]] and the celebration of the thirtieth anniversary of the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]], both in 1863.  Stone began to increase her reform activities back to a normal level after the Civil War had ended.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 257-275&lt;/ref&gt;

As a lifelong believer in [[nonresistance]], Stone could not support the war effort as so many of her friends did.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, pp. 56, 268&lt;/ref&gt; She could certainly support the drive to end slavery, however, which the war had made into a realistic possibility. In 1863, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony organized the [[Women's Loyal National League]], the first national women's political organization in the U.S. It collected nearly 400,000 signatures on petitions to abolish slavery in the largest petition drive in the nation's history up to that time.&lt;ref&gt;Venet, Wendy Hamand, 1991, ''Neither Ballots nor Bullets: Women Abolitionists and the Civil War'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=PfE0ULar1JgC&amp;pg=PA148 p. 148]. Charlottesville, VA: University Press of Virginia. {{ISBN|978-0813913421}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite her reduced public activity, Stone agreed to preside over the League's founding convention, and she later agreed to manage its office for two weeks to give Anthony a badly-needed break.  She declined, however, to go on lecture tours for the League.&lt;ref&gt;Million, 2003, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Blackwell had for years worked with real estate investments.  In 1864, amid wartime inflation, his investments began to pay off handsomely.  Stone was enormously relieved to have the family freed from the debts that had been contracted to buy investment property.  This major improvement in the family's finances enabled Blackwell to scale back his business efforts and devote more of his time to social reform activities.&lt;ref&gt;McMillen, 2015,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=tPCRBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161 p. 161]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning to ease back into public activity, Stone embarked on a lecture tour on women's rights in New York and New England in the autumn of 1865.&lt;ref&gt;McMillen, 2015,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=tPCRBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA162 p. 162]&lt;/ref&gt; She was still experiencing periods of self-doubt a year later, but, with Blackwell's encouragement, she traveled with him on a joint lecture tour in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;McMillen, 2015,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=tPCRBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA165 p. 165]&lt;/ref&gt;

==National organizations==
===American Equal Rights Association===

Slavery was abolished in December 1865 with the ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]], which raised questions about the future role of the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] (AASS).  In January 1866, Stone and Anthony traveled to an AASS meeting in Boston to propose a merger of the anti-slavery and women's movements into one that would campaign for equal rights for all citizens.  The AASS, preferring to focus on the rights of African Americans, especially the newly freed slaves, rejected their proposal.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois, 1978, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1866, Anthony and Stanton organized the Eleventh [[National Women's Rights Convention]], the first since before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] began.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 2, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/152/mode/2up pp. 152–53]&lt;/ref&gt;
In a move similar to the proposal that had been made earlier to anti-slavery forces, the convention voted to transform itself into a new organization called the [[American Equal Rights Association]] (AERA), whose purpose was to campaign for the equal rights for all, especially the right of suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 2, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/170/mode/2up pp. 171–72]&lt;/ref&gt;  Stone did not attend the AERA's founding convention, most likely for fear of the recent [[cholera]] outbreak in New York City, the meeting's location.  She was nevertheless elected to the new organization's executive committee.  Blackwell was elected as the AERA's recording secretary.&lt;ref&gt;McMillen, 2015, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tPCRBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164 p. 164]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, Stone and Blackwell opened the AERA's difficult campaign in [[Kansas]] in support of [[referendum|referenda]] in that state that would [[suffrage|enfranchise]] both African Americans and women.  They led the effort for three months before turning the work over to others and returning home. Neither of the Kansas referenda was approved by the voters.  Disagreements over tactics used during the Kansas campaign contributed to a growing split in the women's movement, which was formalized after the AERA convention in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois, 1978, pp. 79–81, 189&lt;/ref&gt;

===Split within the women's movement===

The immediate cause of the split was the proposed [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]], which would prohibit the denial of suffrage because of race. In one of their most controversial moves, Anthony and Stanton campaigned against the amendment, insisting that women and African Americans should be enfranchised at the same time.  They said that by effectively [[suffrage|enfranchising]] all men while excluding all women, the amendment would create an "aristocracy of sex" by giving constitutional authority to the idea that men were superior to women.&lt;ref&gt;Rakow, Lana F. and Kramarae, Cheris, editors, 2001. ''The Revolution in Words: Righting Women 1868–1871'', Volume 4 of ''Women's Source Library'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&amp;pg=PA47 pp. 47–48].  New York: Routledge.  {{ISBN|978-0-415-25689-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone supported the amendment.  She had expected, however, that progressive forces would push for the [[suffrage|enfranchisment]] of African Americans and women at the same time and was distressed when they did not.  In 1867, she wrote to [[Abby Kelley Foster]], an abolitionist, to protest the plan to enfranchise black men first.  "O Abby", she wrote, "it is a terrible mistake you are all making... There is no other name given by which this country &lt;u&gt;can&lt;/u&gt; be saved, but that of &lt;u&gt;woman&lt;/u&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Lucy Stone to Abby Kelley Foster, January 24, 1867.  Quoted in McMillen, 2008, p. 166. Underlining in original.&lt;/ref&gt;
In a dramatic debate with [[Frederick Douglass]] at the AERA convention in 1869, Stone argued that suffrage for women was more important than suffrage for African Americans. She nevertheless supported the amendment, saying, "But I thank God for that XV. Amendment, and hope that it will be adopted in every State. I will be thankful in my soul if ''any'' body can get out of the terrible pit.  But I believe that the safety of the government would be more promoted by the admission of woman as an element of restoration and harmony than the negro."&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 2, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/384/mode/2up p. 384]&lt;/ref&gt; Stone and her allies expected that their active support for the amendment to enfranchise black men would lead their abolitionist friends in Congress to push for an amendment to enfranchise women as the next step, but that did not happen.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois, 1978, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&amp;pg=PA199 p. 199].&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Blackwell, Stone's husband and an important figure in the suffrage movement in the coming years, also supported the amendment.  His special interest, however, which he pursued for decades, was in convincing southern politicians that the enfranchisement of women would help to ensure white supremacy in their region.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, Marjorie Spruill, 1993. ''New Women of the New South: The Leaders of the Woman Suffrage Movement in the Southern States'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=kE6lZpmLmK0C&amp;pg=PA113 pp. 113–14] New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-507583-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867, he published an open letter to southern legislatures, assuring them that if both blacks and women were enfranchised, "the political supremacy of your white race will remain unchanged" and "the black race would gravitate by the law of nature toward the tropics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/rbpe.12701100/ |title=What the South can do |author=Henry B. Blackwell |date=January 15, 1867 |publisher= Library of Congress |accessdate=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stone's reaction to this idea is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;McMillen, 2015, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tPCRBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA166 p. 166]&lt;/ref&gt;

The AERA essentially collapsed after its acrimonious convention in May 1869, and two competing woman suffrage organizations were created in its aftermath. Two days after the convention, Anthony, Stanton and their allies formed the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] (NWSA). In November 1869, Lucy Stone, [[Julia Ward Howe]] and their allies formed the competing [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] (AWSA).&lt;ref&gt;DuBois, 1978, pp. 189, 196.&lt;/ref&gt; The AWSA initially was the larger of the two organizations,&lt;ref&gt;McMillen, 2015,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=tPCRBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA185 p. 185]&lt;/ref&gt; but it declined in strength during the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Ann D., ed., 2009, ''The Selected Papers of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony: Their Place Inside the Body-Politic, 1887 to 1895'', Vol 5 of 6, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QSWhKqKt1moC&amp;pg=PR25 p. xxv]. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8135-2321-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified in 1870, differences between the two organizations remained. The AWSA worked almost exclusively for women's suffrage while the NWSA initially worked on a wide range of issues, including divorce reform and [[equal pay for women]]. The AWSA included both men and women among its leadership while the NWSA was led by women.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois, 1978, pp. 192, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&amp;pg=PA197 196–197]&lt;/ref&gt; The AWSA worked for suffrage mostly at the state level while the NWSA worked more at the national level. The AWSA cultivated an image of respectability while the NWSA sometimes used confrontational tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, for example, was arrested in 1872 for voting and found guilty in a highly publicized trial. In 1876, Anthony interrupted the official ceremonies at the 100th anniversary of the U.S. Declaration of Independence to present NWSA's Declaration of Rights for Women&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divorce and "free love"===
In 1870, at the twentieth anniversary celebration of the first National Women's Rights Convention in Worcester, Stanton spoke for three hours rallying the crowd for women's right to divorce. By then, Stone's position on the matter had shifted significantly. Personal differences between Stone and Stanton came to the fore on the issue, with Stone writing "We believe in ''marriage for life'', and deprecate all this loose, pestiferous talk in favor of ''easy divorce.''"&lt;ref name=Kerr156/&gt; Stone made it clear that those wishing for "free divorce" were not associated with Stone's organization AWSA, headed at that time by Reverend [[Henry Ward Beecher]].&lt;ref name=Kerr156/&gt; Stone wrote against 'free love:' "Be not deceived—''free love means free lust.''"&lt;ref name=Kerr156/&gt;

This editorial position would come back to haunt Stone. Also in 1870, Elizabeth Roberts Tilton told her husband [[Theodore Tilton]] that she had been carrying on an [[Adultery|adulterous]] relation with his good friend Henry Ward Beecher. Theodore Tilton published an editorial saying that Beecher "has at a most unseemly time of life been detected in improper intimacies with certain ladies of his congregation."&lt;ref&gt;Hays, 1961, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Tilton also informed Stanton about the alleged affair, and Stanton passed the information to [[Victoria Woodhull]]. Woodhull, a free love advocate, printed innuendo about Beecher, and began to woo Tilton, convincing him to write a book of her life story from imaginative material that she supplied.&lt;ref&gt;Hays, 1961, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, Stone wrote to a friend "my one wish in regard to Mrs. Woodhull is, that [neither] she nor her ideas, may be so much as heard of at our meeting."&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, 1992, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Woodhull's self-serving activities were attracting disapproval from both centrist AWSA and radical NWSA. To divert criticism from herself, Woodhull published a denunciation of Beecher in 1872 saying that he practiced free love in private while speaking out against it from the pulpit. This caused a sensation in the press, and resulted in an inconclusive legal suit and a subsequent formal inquiry lasting well into 1875. The furor over adultery and the friction between various camps of women's rights activists took focus away from legitimate political aims. Harry Blackwell wrote to Stone from Michigan where he was working toward putting woman suffrage into the state constitution, saying "This Beecher-Tilton affair is playing the deuce with [woman suffrage] in Michigan. No chance of success this year I fancy."&lt;ref&gt;Hays, 1961, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voting rights==
In 1870, Stone and Blackwell moved from New Jersey to [[Dorchester, Massachusetts]], which today is a neighborhood of Boston just south of downtown. There they purchased Pope's Hill, a seventeen-room house with extensive grounds and several outbuildings.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, 1992, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the town's women had been active in the Dorchester Female Anti-Slavery Society and, by 1870, a number of local women were suffragists.

=== New England Woman Suffrage Association===

At her new home, Stone worked closely with the [[New England Woman Suffrage Association]] (NEWSA), the first major political organization in the U.S. with women's suffrage as its goal.  Two years earlier she had traveled to Boston to participate in its founding convention and had been elected to its executive committee.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois, Ellen Carol (1978), ''Feminism and Suffrage: The Emergence of an Independent Women's Movement in America, 1848-1869'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&amp;pg=PA165 pp. 165, 168]. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press. {{ISBN|0-8014-8641-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877, she became its president and served in that position until her death in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, Susan B.; Harper, Ida Husted (1902). ''[[History of Woman Suffrage]]'', Vol. 4, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu04stanuoft#page/720/mode/2up p. 720]. Indianapolis, Indiana: Hollenbeck Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Woman's Journal''===

In 1870, Stone and Blackwell founded the ''[[Woman's Journal]]'', an eight-page weekly newspaper based in Boston.  Originally intended primarily to voice the concerns of the NEWSA and the AWSA, by the 1880s it had become an unofficial voice of the suffrage movement as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;McMillen, 2008, pp. 208, 224&lt;/ref&gt; Stone edited the journal for the rest of her life, assisted by her husband and their daughter [[Alice Stone Blackwell]].  Stone did not collect a salary for her work on the paper, which required continual financial support.  One of her greatest challenges was raising money to keep it going.  Its circulation reached a peak of 6,000, although in 1878 it was 2,000 less than it had been two years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;McMillen, 2015, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tPCRBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA191 pp. 191–192]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the AWSA and NWSA merged to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) in 1890, the ''Woman's Journal'' became its official voice and eventually the basis for a newspaper with a much wider circulation.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Robert Booth, ''Carrie Catt: Feminist Politician'', 1986, p. 117. Boston: Northeastern University Press. {{ISBN|0-930350-86-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, at a time when victory for women's suffrage was coming closer, Carrie Chapman Catt, leader of the NAWSA, said, "There can be no overestimating the value to the suffrage cause of the ''Woman's Journal''... The suffrage success of to-day is not conceivable without the ''Woman's Journal'''s part in it.&lt;ref&gt;Carrie Chapman Catt,  ''Woman Citizen'', June 2, 1917, as quoted in Blackwell, 1930, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="The Colorado Lesson"===
[[File:LucyStone-sig.jpg|thumb|Lucy Stone's portrait as it appeared in ''[[History of Woman Suffrage]]'', Volume II, in 1881]]
In 1877, Stone was asked by [[Rachel Foster Avery]] to come assist [[Colorado]] activists in the organization of a popular referendum campaign with the aim of gaining suffrage for Coloradan women. Together, Stone and Blackwell worked the northern half of the state in late summer, while Susan Anthony traveled the less-promising rough-and-tumble southern half. Patchwork and scattered support was reported by activists, with some areas more receptive. Latino voters proved largely uninterested in voting reform; some of that resistance was blamed on the extreme opposition to the measure voiced by the Roman Catholic bishop of Colorado. All but a handful of politicians in Colorado ignored the measure, or actively fought it. Stone concentrated on convincing Denver voters during the October ballot, but the measure lost heavily, with 68% voting against it. Married working men showed the greatest support, and young single men the least. Blackwell called it "The Colorado Lesson", writing that "Woman suffrage can never be carried by a popular vote, without a political party behind it."&lt;ref&gt;Mead, 2004, pp. 56–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===School board vote===
In 1879, after Stone organized a petition by suffragists across the state, Massachusetts women were given strictly delimited voting rights: a woman who could prove the same qualifications as a male voter was allowed to cast her vote for members of the school board. Stone applied to the voting board in Boston but was required to sign her husband's surname as her own. She refused, and never participated in that vote.&lt;ref name=Ohio&gt;Ohio History Central. [http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=359 ''Lucy Stone''.] Retrieved March 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconciliation==
In 1887, eighteen years after the rift formed in the American women's rights movement, Stone proposed a merger of the two groups. Plans were drawn up, and, at their annual meetings, propositions were heard and voted on, then passed to the other group for evaluation. By 1890, the organizations resolved their differences and merged to form the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA). Stone was too weak with heart problems and respiratory illness to attend its first convention&lt;ref&gt;Mani, 2007, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; but was elected chair of the executive committee. Stanton was president of the new organization, but Anthony, who had the title of vice president, was its leader in practice.&lt;ref&gt;McMillen (2008), p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lucy Stone in middle age.jpg|thumb|Lucy Stone in old age]]
Starting early in January 1891, [[Carrie Chapman Catt]] visited Stone repeatedly at Pope's Hill, for the purpose of learning from Stone about the ways of political organizing.&lt;ref name=Kerr236/&gt; Stone had previously met Catt at an Iowa state woman's suffrage convention in October, 1889, and had been impressed at her ambition and sense of presence, saying "Mrs. Chapman will be heard from yet in this movement."&lt;ref&gt;Van Voris, Jacqueline. [https://books.google.com/books?id=s2SkL2HNuwEC&amp;pg=PA18 ''Carrie Chapman Catt: A Public Life''], The Feminist Press at The City University of New York, 1987, p. 18. {{ISBN|0-935312-63-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone mentored Catt the rest of that winter, giving her a wealth of information about lobbying techniques and fund-raising. Catt later used the teaching to good effect in leading the final drive to gain women the vote in 1920.&lt;ref name=Kerr236&gt;Kerr, 1992, pp. 236–237.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catt, Stone and Blackwell went together to the January, 1892 NAWSA convention in Washington, DC. Along with [[Isabella Beecher Hooker]], Stone, Stanton and Anthony, the "triumvirate" of women's suffrage,&lt;ref name="loc leaders"/&gt; were called away from the convention's opening hours by an unexpected woman suffrage hearing before the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary]]. Stone told the assembled congressmen "I come before this committee with the sense which I always feel, that we are handicapped as women in what we try to do for ourselves by the single fact that we have no vote. This cheapens us. You do not care so much for us as if we had votes..."&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Stone. January 18, 1892.

In 1892, Stone was convinced to sit for a portrait in sculpture, rendered by [[Anne Whitney]], sculptor and poet. Stone had previously protested the proposed portrait for more than a year, saying that the funds to engage an artist would be better spent on suffrage work. Stone finally yielded to pressure from [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]], the [[New England Women's Club]] and some of her friends and neighbors in the Boston area, and sat while Whitney produced a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]].&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell, 1930, pp. 273–274.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1893, Stone invited her brother Frank and his wife Sarah to come see the bust, before it was shipped to Chicago for display at the upcoming [[World's Columbian Exposition]].&lt;ref name=Kerr236/&gt;

Stone went with her daughter to Chicago in May 1893 and gave her last public speeches at the [[World's Congress of Representative Women]] where she saw a strong international involvement in women's congresses, with almost 500 women from 27 countries speaking at 81 meetings, and attendance topping 150,000 at the week-long event.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, 1992, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Stone's immediate focus was on state referenda under consideration in New York and Nebraska.&lt;ref&gt;Mead, 2004, pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Stone presented a speech she had prepared entitled "The Progress of Fifty Years" wherein she described the milestones of change, and said "I think, with never-ending gratitude, that the young women of today do not and can never know at what price their right to free speech and to speak at all in public has been earned."&lt;ref name=FiftyYears&gt;{{cite web |url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/stonelucy/a/lucy_stone_prog.htm |title=The Progress of Fifty Years |accessdate=2009-03-22 |last=Stone |first=Lucy |year=1893 |work=Congress of Women |publisher=[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone met with Carrie Chapman Catt and [[Abigail Scott Duniway]] to form a plan for organizing in Colorado, and Stone attended two days of meetings about getting a woman suffrage drive restarted in Kansas. Stone and her daughter returned home to Pope's Hill on May 28.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, 1992, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who knew Stone well thought her voice was lacking strength. In August when she and her husband Harry wanted to take part in more meetings at the Exposition, she was too weak to go. Stone was diagnosed as suffering from advanced stomach cancer in September. She wrote final letters to friends and relatives. Having "prepared for death with serenity and an unwavering concern for the women's cause," Lucy Stone died on October 18, 1893, at the age of 75. At her funeral three days later, 1,100 people crowded the church, and hundreds more stood silently outside.&lt;ref&gt;Hays, 1961, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; Six women and six men served as pallbearers, including sculptor Anne Whitney, and Stone's old abolitionist friends [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]] and [[Samuel Joseph May]].&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, 1992, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Mourners lined the streets for a sight of the funeral procession, and front-page banner headlines ran in news accounts. Stone's death was the most widely reported of any American woman's up to that time.&lt;ref name="Coy'sHill"/&gt;

According to her wishes, her body was cremated, making her the first person cremated in Massachusetts, though a wait of over two months was undertaken while the crematorium at [[Forest Hills Cemetery]] could be completed. Stone's remains are inurned at Forest Hills; a chapel there is named after her.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Lucy Stone's refusal to take her husband's name, as an assertion of her own rights, was controversial then, and is largely what she is remembered for today. Women who continue to use their birth name after marriage are still occasionally known as "Lucy Stoners" in the United States.&lt;ref name=Spender348/&gt; In 1921, the [[Lucy Stone League]] was founded in [[New York City]] by [[Ruth Hale (feminist)|Ruth Hale]], described in 1924 by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' as the "'Lucy Stone'-spouse" of [[Heywood Broun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=June 1924 |title=New Magazine |journal=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,718627,00.html |accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The League was re-instituted in 1997.

Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] and [[Ida Husted Harper]] began in 1876 to write the ''[[History of Woman Suffrage]]''. They planned for one volume but finished four before the death of Anthony in 1906, and two more afterward. The first three volumes chronicled the beginnings of the women's rights movement, including the years that Stone was active. Because of differences between Stone and Stanton that had been highlighted in the schism between NWSA and AWSA,&lt;ref name=Mani115/&gt; Stone's place in history was marginalized in the work. The text was used as the standard scholarly resource on 19th-century U.S. feminism for much of the 20th century, causing Stone's extensive contribution to be overlooked in many histories of women's causes.&lt;ref name="Coy'sHill"&gt;Kerr, Andrea Moore, Ph.D. (2002) {{cite web|url=http://www.thetrustees.org/documents.cfm?documentID=194 |title=''Lucy Stone and Coy's Hill.'' |accessdate=2010-01-22 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210618/http://www.thetrustees.org/documents.cfm?documentID=194 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df= }} The Trustees of Reservations.

==Home==
The Lucy Stone Home Site is owned and managed by [[The Trustees of Reservations]], a non-profit land conservation and historic preservation organization dedicated to preserving natural and historic places in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The site includes 61 acres of forested land on the side of Coys Hill in West Brookfield, Massachusetts. Although the farmhouse in which Stone was born and married burned to the ground in 1950, its ruins are at the center of the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.oberlin.edu/alummag/spring2004/feat_lucy_02.html |page=2 |title=Lucy Stone Lost and Found |last=Cambo |first=Carol |date=Spring 2004 |journal=Oberlin Alumni Magazine |volume=89 |number=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Stone's wedding, both her parents and a married brother and his family lived in the two-and-one-half-story house, and family descendants continued to live there until 1936. In 1915, a pilgrimage of suffragists placed a memorial tablet on the house, which read: "This house was the birthplace of Lucy Stone, pioneer advocate of equal rights for women. Born August 13, 1818. Married May 1, 1855, died October 18, 1893. In grateful memory Massachusetts suffragists placed this tablet August 13, 1915." That tablet, severely damaged but surviving the 1950 fire, is now in the Quaboag Historical Society Museum. After the fire, the surrounding farmland was abandoned and left to revert to forest, and it is now used for hunting and harvesting timber. The Trustees acquired the home site in 2002 and have been maintaining the property ever since.

The '''Makoa''' (or '''Masombika''') are an [[ethnic groups of Madagascar|ethnic group in Madagascar]] descended from slaves traded through the major slave trading ports of northern [[Mozambique]] in an area mainly populated by the [[Makua people]].  They are among the last African diaspora communities in the world to issue from the slave trade. They are sometimes classified as a subgroup of the fishing peoples known as the [[Vezo]] (who are themselves a subset of the [[Sakalava people]]), although the Makoa maintain a distinct identity, one reinforced by their larger physical stature and historic employment as police officers by the French colonial administration.

==Ethnic identity==
The Makoa (called Masombika in the central highlands around the capital of [[Antananarivo]]) are an [[ethnic groups of Madagascar|ethnic group in Madagascar]] descended from slaves traded through the major slave trading ports of northern [[Mozambique]] in an area mainly populated by the [[Makua people]]. They are one of the latest African diaspora groups in the world to be created as a result of the slave trade.&lt;ref name=Africulture&gt;{{cite web | last = Boyer-Rossol | first = Klara |title =Réinvestir le sacré: Musiques, paroles et rites chez les anciens captifs déportés de l'Afrique orientale à Madagascar XIXe-XXe siècles | date = 2 July 2014 |url = http://www.africultures.com/php/index.php?nav=article&amp;no=12303 | publisher = Africultures.com |accessdate= 27 September 2014 | language = French | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are sometimes classified as a subgroup of the fishing peoples known as the [[Vezo]] (who are themselves a subset of the [[Sakalava people]]), although the Makoa maintain a distinct identity, one reinforced by their larger physical stature and historic employment as police officers by the French colonial administration.{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=27}}  The term Makoa is used today in Madagascar to refer not only to those who are believed descendants of Makua slaves, but also those who are very dark skinned, and those who are physically robust and powerful.&lt;ref name=Africulture/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Ethnic groups of Madagascar Map.png|thumb|left|200px|Distribution of Malagasy ethnic groups. The Makoa are classified with the Sakalava.]]
Slave trading was a major source of wealth for [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] kings since at least the 16th century, when the first people from Mozambique arrived in the western part of Madagascar. They were not slaves, but rather migrants relocating to Madagascar to escape the slave trading that was then ravaging the eastern coast of Africa.&lt;ref name=integration&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Rakotomalala | first1 = Malanjaona | last2=Razafimbelo | first2 = Celestin | title = Le problème d'intégration sociale chez les Makoa de l'Antsihanaka | journal = Omaly sy Anio| volume = 21-22 | issue = 1 | pages = 93-113 | year = 1985 | url = http://madarevues.recherches.gov.mg/IMG/pdf/omaly21-22_8_.pdf |language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest slave trading ports in Mozambique were located in the north, an area traditionally populated by the Makua people, and while not all the slaves exported from these ports were Makua, the name came to be associated with slaves exported from the area. Madagascar was principally an exporter of slaves, however, as kings sold fellow Malagasy captured in conflicts and slave raids among enemy villages to European and Arab traders. In 1819, King [[Radama I]], ruler of the [[Kingdom of Imerina]] that had come to dominate two thirds of the island of Madagascar from its capital at Antananarivo, capitulated to the entreaties of British diplomats to abolish the exportation of Malagasy slaves. The demand for slaves within Madagascar nonetheless remained strong, leading domestic slave traders to supplement those captured in Merina military expeditions to coastal provinces with others imported from Mozambique; clandestine importation of Makoa slaves increased dramatically over the course of the 19th century.  The town of Maintirano, between [[Mahajanga]] and [[Morondava]] on the west coast, was a major hub of the illegal Mozambican slave trade. An estimated total of 650,000 Makoa slaves were exported from Mozambique to Madagascar in total, with as many as 30% of these being resold and exported to other western Indian Ocean islands.&lt;ref name=Africulture/&gt;

On 20 June 1877, Prime Minister [[Rainilaiarivony]] under Queen [[Ranavalona II]] passed a law liberating all Makoa slaves. An estimated 150,000 Makoa were emancipated in territories under the control of the [[Kingdom of Imerina]]; in other areas of the west coast beyond Merina administrative reach, the illegal slave trade persisted.  The town of Morondava, under Merina administration, enforced the liberation of Makoa slaves, who grouped together to form their own neighborhoods within the city and established villages around its periphery. Makoa slaves from territory outside Merina control who managed to escape from their masters fled to Morondava to rejoin their free counterparts. Many joined the Norwegian Lutheran Mission that was active in Morondava in the late 19th century. In the 1880s, a number of Makoa solicited the aid of the Norwegian missionaries to help repatriate them to Mozambique. Over thirty years many Makoa in Morondava organized to return home, whether by building boats and rafts or by raising funds for passage on a ship. Norwegian records indicate that at least a few were successful in returning to Africa. Importation of Makoa slaves continued along portions of the west coast beyond Merina reach until the [[French Madagascar|French colonized Madagascar]] in 1896 and outlawed all forms of slavery on the island.&lt;ref name=Africulture/&gt;

Throughout the colonial period, life in Makoa villages reflected strong and enduring ties to the traditions left behind in Mozambique: language, dance, music, food, storytelling and other cultural features were in evidence. Inhabitants of the villages crafted furniture, jewelry, utensils and musical instruments (particularly including drums) of the types used in Mozambique. Certain Makoa cultural practices were adopted by the neighboring [[Sakalava people]],&lt;ref name=Africulture/&gt; including facial and body tattooing.{{cn|date=September 2014}} Today, Makoa villages and neighborhoods are large and preserve a distinct identity relative to the surrounding communities, although most of the cultural practices have been deliberately abandoned or forgotten.&lt;ref name=Africulture/&gt;

==Society==
Within Makoa society, a three level caste system emerged to replicate that predominant in larger Malagasy society. A slave master would typically designate a leader of the Makoa, who took the title ''ampanjaka'' (king), as well as higher status slaves and lower status ones.&lt;ref name=integration/&gt;

===Religious affiliation===--&gt;
==Culture==
&lt;!--===Fady===
===Funeral rites===--&gt;
===Language===
The Makoa speak a dialect of the [[Malagasy language]], which is a branch of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian language group]] derived from the [[Barito languages]], spoken in southern [[Borneo]]. Historically they spoke [[Emakhuwa]], the language spoken in northern Mozambique; church hymns and portions of the Bible were translated to Emakhuwa by Makoa Lutheran converts. There are several known Emakhuwa language documents written by Makoa in Madagascar that were carefully preserved by family and community members.   Today, no living Makoa in Madagascar continue to speak this language as their mother tongue.&lt;ref name=Africulture/&gt; 

===Dance and music===
The rap group Makoa claims to valorize an "Afro-Malagasy" identity associated with the Makoa people. Although the members of the group are not themselves Makoa by ethnicity, the popularity of the group and its inclusive message has contributed to rehabilitating the image of the Makoa in the popular imagination.&lt;ref name=Africulture/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1077">'''Mancuerda''' was a method of [[torture]].  A tight cord was wound around the [[arm]]s of the condemned. The executioner would then throw his entire weight backwards, or the pressure would be exerted by a lever.   

The cord cut through [[skin]] and [[muscle]] directly to the [[bone]].  Additional [[pain]] was produced by the fact that the body of the prisoner was stretched as in a rack, and the belt or girdle attached to the waist also contributed further to the suffering.

The procedure was repeated six or eight times, on different parts of the arms.  People subjected to such torture usually fainted from its effects.

[[Giovanni II Bentivoglio]], tyrant of [[Bologna]], is said to have subjected the astrologer [[Luca Gaurico]] to this method of torture after he was unhappy with a prediction that Gaurico had made.

'''''Mazhory''''' ({{lang-uk|мажо́ри}}, {{lang-ru|мажоры}}; which roughly translates as "''the superior ones''"&lt;ref name=KPMakar1042012/&gt;) is a slang term used in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[post-Soviet countries]] for children of privileged people, who take advantage of their inborn privileges ([[nepotism]], [[cronyism]], avoiding due punishment, etc.), often in an arrogant and abusive way.

'''Nation branding''' aims to measure, build and manage the [[reputation]] of countries (closely related to [[place branding]]). In the book ''Diplomacy in a Globalizing World: Theories and Practices'', the authors define nation branding as “the application of corporate marketing concepts and techniques to countries, in the interests of enhancing their reputation in international relations.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kerr|first1=Pauline|last2=Wiseman|first2=Geoffrey|title=Diplomacy in a Globalizing World: Theories and Practice|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many nations try to make brands in order to build relationships between different actors that are not restricted to nations. It extends to public and private sectors in a nation and helps with nationalism. States also want to participate in multilateral projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pamment|first1=James|title=New Public Diplomacy in the 21st Century A comparative study of policy and practice|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=35-36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some approaches applied, such as an increasing importance on the symbolic value of [[Product (business)|products]], have led countries to emphasise their distinctive characteristics. The branding and [[image]] of a [[nation-state]] "and the successful transference of this image to its exports - is just as important as what they actually produce and sell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=True|first=Jacqui|chapter=Globalisation and Identity|editor=Raymond Miller|year=2006|title=Globalisation and Identity|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=South Melbourne|isbn=978-0-19-558492-9|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;This is also referred to as [[country-of-origin effect]]. 

Nation branding is a developing field in which scholars continue their search for a unified theoretical framework. Many nations aim to improve their country's standing, as the image and reputation of a nation can dramatically influence its economic vitality. They seek to attract tourism and investment capital, increase exports, attract a talented and creative workforce, and enhance their cultural and political influence in the world.
Different ways that nation project their nation brand include export, foreign direct investment, and tourism. One example of exporting products is that the country Germany is known for their motor industry because famous car companies like [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]], [[Audi]], and [[BMW]] are German companies. An example of foreign direct investments that help the nation brand are US companies building [[maquiladoras]] and other European countries having factories in different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Olins|first1=Wally|editor1-last=Melissen|editor1-first=Jan|title=The New Public Diplomacy Soft Power in International Relations|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|page=169-179|chapter=Making a National Brand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In practice ==
Nation branding appears to be practiced by many countries, including the United States, Canada, France, United Kingdom (where it is officially referred to as [[public diplomacy]]), Taiwan, Malaysia, Japan, China, South Korea, Singapore, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Israel and most Western European countries. An early example of this was the [[Cool Britannia]] approach of the early days of the [[New Labour]] government (following the ''[http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/britaintm Britain (TM)]'' pamphlet by [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]]'s Mark Leonard), though this has since been replaced by a more credible [https://web.archive.org/web/20110604233305/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=PressR&amp;id=2000999 Public Diplomacy Board]. [[Cool Japan]] is a newer initiative aimed at promoting Japan's creative industries. There is increasing interest in the concept from poorer states on the grounds that an enhanced image might create more favorable conditions for [[foreign direct investment]], [[tourism]], [[trade]] and even political relations with other states. [[Developing nations]] such as Tanzania and Colombia are creating smaller nation branding programs aimed at increased overall image and with the case of Colombia, changing international perception.
Nation branding is seen as a part of Sweden's public diplomacy, especially with Brand Sweden. Sweden uses two main institutions, called the Utrikesdepartementet and the Swedish Institute, to study their nation branding. They wanted to present a good image through the press and also collect different reports on Sweden’s representations abroad. Different events and campaigns were also made to promote Brand Sweden, one example being the House of Sweden which was an embassy in the US. Another campaign was the Second House of Sweden which used the internet to introduce Sweden’s embassy virtually. Researchers in Sweden also studied the Nation Brand Index (NBI) results to collect data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pamment|first1=James|title=New Public Diplomacy in the 21st Century A comparative study of policy and practice|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=99-126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In academia==
Nation branding can be approached in academics as a field in social sciences, political sciences, humanities, communication, marketing and [[international relations]].
Scholars such as Evan H. Potter at the [[University of Ottawa]] have conceptualized nation brands as a form of national [[soft power]]. All efforts by government (at any level) to support the nation brand - either directly or indirectly - becomes public diplomacy.

[[Anti-globalisation]] proponents often claim that [[globalisation]] diminishes and threatens local diversity, but there is evidence that in order to compete against the backdrop of global cultural homogeneity, nations strive to accentuate and promote local distinctiveness as a competitive advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=True|first=Jacqui|chapter=Globalisation and Identity|editor=Raymond Miller|year=2006|title=Globalisation and Identity|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=South Melbourne|isbn=978-0-19-558492-9|pages=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indexing==
=== Nation Brands Index ===

The concept of measuring global perceptions of countries across several dimensions (culture, governance, people, exports, tourism, investment and immigration) was developed by [[Simon Anholt]]. His original survey, the Anholt Nation Brands Index, was launched in 2005 and fielded four times a year. Today it is fielded and published once a year in partnership with [[GfK]], named the Anholt-GfK Nation Brands Index, using a panel of 20,000 people in 20 countries to monitor the global perceptions of countries. There is also an Anholt-GfK Roper City Brands Index. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gfk.com/news-and-events/press-room/press-releases/pages/germany-knocks-usa-off-best-nation-top-spot.aspx | title = GERMANY KNOCKS USA OFF BEST NATION TOP SPOT AFTER 5 YEARS | date = 12 November 2014 | work = Press Releases | publisher = GfK Custom Research North America}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gfk.com/news-and-events/press-room/press-releases/pages/nation-brand-index-2013-latest-findings.aspx | title = US VOTED TOP COUNTRY FOR ATTRACTING TALENT AND INVESTMENT – BUT WITH A REDUCING LEAD | date = 14 November 2013 | work = Press Releases | publisher = GfK Custom Research North America}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gfkamerica.com/newsroom/press_releases/single_sites/010541/index.en.html | title = Two-Thirds of Nations Experience Reputation Decline in 2012 Nation Brands Index | date = Oct 23, 2012 | work = Press Releases | publisher = GfK Custom Research North America | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121106001244/http://www.gfkamerica.com/newsroom/press_releases/single_sites/010541/index.en.html | archivedate = November 6, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gfk.com/group/press_information/press_releases/008789/index.en.html Nation Brands Index 2011 released]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nation-branding.info/2010/10/13/nation-brands-index-2010/ Nation Brands Index 2010 released]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brand Finance Nation Brands===
[[Brand Finance]] produces an annual Brand Finance Nation Brands table, in which 100 brands are ranked according to national brand value. This is based on the royalty relief methodology and takes into account the brand strength of individual countries.  

==Futurebrand Country Brand Index==
Futurebrand publishes the Country Brand Index every year, which includes an overall ranking of the 75 countries and rankings by dimension, FutureBrand collected quantitative and qualitative data from Approximately  2,500 opinion-formers and frequent international business or leisure travellers in 17 countries (USA, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, UK, Germany, France, Russia, Turkey, South Africa, UAE, India, China, Thailand, Japan and Australia). complete perception dashboards for the top five country brands, regional leaders, and 'ones to watch' for the future. Futurebrand tests a global research sample based on the Hierarchical Decision Model (HDM) which involves determining an individual's awareness, familiarity, association, and preference towards a country's brand. In their 2018-19  ranking, the top 5 nations brands were (ranked from first to fifth) Germany, Switzerland, Japan, Sweden, and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.futurebrand.com/uploads/CBI-18_19-LR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monocle Soft Power Survey ===
''[[Monocle (lifestyle magazine)|Monocle]]'' magazine released its third annual Soft Power Survey in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://monocle.com/film/affairs/soft-power-survey-2012/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://howtoattractpublicsandinfluencestates.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/who-rules-the-world-monocles-top-twenty-overview/&lt;/ref&gt; The latest edition of the survey was launched in 2013 &lt;ref&gt;http://monocle.com/film/affairs/soft-power-survey-2013/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nivkh''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|iː|f|k}} or '''Gilyak''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɪ|l|j|æ|k}};&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; self-designation: Нивхгу диф ''Nivxgu dif'', {{IPA|[ɲivxɡu dif]}}) is a language spoken in [[Outer Manchuria]], in the basin of the [[Amgun River|Amgun]] (a tributary of the [[Amur River|Amur]]), along the lower reaches of the [[Amur River|Amur]] itself, and on the northern half of [[Sakhalin]]. "Gilyak" is the Manchu appellation. Its speakers are known as the [[Nivkh people]].

The population of ethnic Nivkhs has been reasonably stable over the past century, with 4,549 Nivkhs counted in 1897, and 4,673 in 1989. However, the number of native speakers of the Nivkh language among these has dropped from 100% to 23.3% in the same period, so that there are now just over 1,000 first-language speakers left.

==Classification==
Nivkh is not known to be related to any other language, making it a [[language isolate]]. For classification convenience, it is included in the group of [[Paleosiberian languages]]. Many words in the Nivkh language bear a certain resemblance to words of similar meaning in other [[Paleosiberian languages]], [[Ainu language|Ainu]], [[Korean language|Korean]], or [[Tungusic languages]], but no regular sound correspondences have been discovered to systematically account for the vocabularies of these various languages, so any lexical similarities are considered to be due to chance or to borrowing.

The Nivkh language is included in the controversial [[Eurasiatic languages]] hypothesis by [[Joseph Greenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Mattissen, Johanna (2001) Facts about the World's Languages, Nivkh. New England Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8242-0970-2}} p. 515.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Fortescue]] has suggested in 1998 that Nivkh may be related to the [[Mosan languages]],&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue, M. (1998). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Su_xVd0gTOcC&amp;pg=PA232&amp;lpg=PA232&amp;dq=nivkh+language+related+to+mosan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HqRwtXlQjK&amp;sig=mSxlvDhZxcSgVlFo6wFc-3p34Bk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yB75S6HfBYL-0gSL29zpBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=nivkh%20language%20related%20to%20mosan&amp;f=false ''Language relations across Bering Strait: reappraising the archaeological and linguistic evidence''.]&lt;/ref&gt; and later, in 2011, he has argued that Nivkh, which he also refers to as an "isolated Amuric language", is related to the [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages]], forming a Chukotko-Kamchatkan-Amuric language family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fortescue | first1 = Michael | year = 2011 | title = The relationship of Nivkh to Chukotko-Kamchatkan revisited | url = | journal = Lingua | volume = 121 | issue = 8| pages = 1359–1376 | doi = 10.1016/j.lingua.2011.03.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Sergei Nikolaev has argued in two papers for a systematic relationship between Nivkh and the [[Algic languages]] of North America and a secondary relationship between these two together and the [[Wakashan languages]] of coastal [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/15693360/S.L._Nikolaev._2015._Toward_the_reconstruction_of_Proto-Algonquian-Wakashan._Part_1_Proof_of_the_Algonquian-Wakashan_relationship Nikolaev, S. (2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/28569450/S.L.Nikolaev._2016._Toward_the_reconstruction_of_Proto-Algonquian-Wakashan._Part_2_Algonquian-Wakashan_sound_correspondences Nikolaev, S. (2016)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Proto-Nivkh, the [[proto-language]] ancestral to the modern-day Nivkh language varieties, has been reconstructed by Fortescue (2016).&lt;ref name="Fortescue2016"/&gt;

== History ==
The Nivkh people have lived, by many accounts for thousands of years, on the island of Sakhalin and the Amur River. They maintained trade with the neighboring Ainu, Japanese, and Mongolian, until Russian contact, which began in the 17th century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Peoples of Siberia|last=Ivanov|first=S.|last2=Levin|first2=M.|last3=Smolyak|first3=A. V.|publisher=The University of Chicago|year=1964|chapter=The Nikvhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th century shows the first recorded decline of Nivkh numbers, with official estimates dropping from 1856 to 1889. This coincided with smallpox epidemics and the expansion of Sakhalin's prisoner population, as Russia began sending groups of its convicts to Sakhalin in 1873. At this time, reportedly few Nivkh spoke Russian.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Shaman's Coat: A Native History of Siberia|last=Reid|first=Anne|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|year=2002|isbn=0-8027-1399-8|location=London|chapter=The Ainu, Nivkh, and Uilta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolutionary and post-revolutionary Russia accorded large changes for the Nivkh. The 1920s ushered in years of guerilla fighting in the area, Russians against Japanese, ending in 1925, when Japan ceded Sakhalin to the Soviets. The violence lead to Nivkh deaths, as the area's resources were depleted and disease spread. Later, Stalin's policy of collectivization was imposed on indigenous economies,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and in many cases, drove Nivkh individuals to hired labor, marking a departure from traditional means of subsistence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many Nivkh were forcibly displaced from their more widely spread settlements to Nogliki, a small city, in the process of centralization. The traditional Nivkh way of life was gradually and sometimes forcibly converted to a Soviet way of life, as changes in subsistence, diet, dwellings, and education have resulted.

==Dialects==
[[File:Nivkh settlements 2002 map.svg|upright=1.36|thumbnail|right|The settlements with Nivkh population according to the Russian Census of 2002 (excluding [[Khabarovsk]], [[Poronaysk]] and [[Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk]]).]]
Nivkh is divided into four [[dialect]]s, the Amur dialect, the North Sakhalin dialect, the South Sakhalin dialect, and the East Sakhalin dialect. The lexical and phonological differences between the dialect spoken by the Nivkhs of the Amur River basin and the dialect spoken by the Nivkhs of Sakhalin Island are so great that some linguists have classified them as two distinct languages belonging to a small Nivkh language family. Other linguists have emphasized the high degree of variability of usage among all Nivkhs; even within the Amur or Sakhalin dialect zone, there is said to be great diversity depending on the village, clan, or even individual speaker.

Fortescue (2016)&lt;ref name="Fortescue2016"&gt;Fortescue, Michael. 2016. ''Comparative Nivkh Dictionary''. Languages of the World/Dictionaries (LW/D) 62. Munich: Lincom Europa. {{ISBN|9783862886876}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes that the Amur, East Sakhalin, and South Sakhalin dialects have low intelligibility with each other, considers them to be separate languages.

==Grammar==
Nivkh is an agglutinating synthetic language. It has a developed case system, as well as other grammatical markers, but no grammatical gender. The basic word order of Nivkh is [[subject–object–verb]], the subject being frequently omitted in speech.[[Nivkh language#cite note-9|&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Nivkh is notable for the high degree of incorporation between words. For example, morphemes that express spatial relationships (prepositions or postpositions in many other languages) are incorporated into the noun to which they relate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gruzdeva|first=Ekaterina|title=The Linguistic Consequences of Nivkh Language Attrition|journal=SKY Journal of Linguistics|volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Words consist of easily definable roots and productive grammatical morphemes, most of which are suffixes. Nivkh has no adjectives, but rather verbs that describe a state of being. There are two verb tenses: non-future and future. The non-future form may combine with adverbials, as well as context, to indicate a time frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Syntax of the Nivkh Language: The Amur Dialect|last=Nedjalkov|first=Vladimir|last2=Otaina|first2=Galina|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|year=2013|location=Philadelphia, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Russian has become the dominant language in all spheres of life, Nivkh grammar has changed in the last century. For example, Nivkh has recently begun to mark plurals on counting nouns and pairs, a change that originated from the grammar rules of Russian. However, it has been postulated that due to the vastly differing grammatical structures of the two tongues, grammatical interference has not been extensive. Simplification has occurred past borrowed Russian structure, though; due to disuse of the language and a changing culture, many of the complex morphological aspects of Nivkh have been simplified or fallen out of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gruzdeva|first=Ekaterina|title=Aspects of Russian-Nivkh Grammatical Interference: The Nivkh Imperative.|journal=Studies in Slavic and General Linguistics|volume=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a process referred to as obsolescence, things like the distinction between the morpheme for counting sledges and the morpheme for counting fishnets has disappeared, with speakers opting to use more general categories of counting numbers or other descriptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language Death|last=Crystal|first=David|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=9780521653213|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=23|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The labial fricatives are weakly articulated, and have been described as both [[Bilabial consonant|bilabial]] {{IPA|[ɸ, β]}} and [[Labiodental consonant|labiodental]] {{IPA|[f, v]}}. The palatal stops may have some degree of affrication, as {{IPA|[tʃʰ, tʃ]}}&lt;ref name="CA"/&gt;. After nasals or {{IPA|/l/}}, the unaspirated stops become voiced {{IPA|[b, d, ɟ, ɡ, ɢ]}}. Unlike consonant alternation, this occurs also within a morpheme. The Amur dialect deletes some word-final nasals, which leads to voiced stops occurring also word-initially.

Nivkh's [[phoneme|phonemic]] distinction between velar and uvular fricatives ({{IPA|[ɣ]}} vs. {{IPA|[ʁ]}} and {{IPA|[x]}} vs. {{IPA|[χ]}}) is rare among the world’s languages. These sounds do occur in a great deal of languages, but usually they are [[allophone|interchangeable]].

Nivkh features a process of [[lenition|consonant alternation]] not unlike in [[Celtic languages]], in which [[morpheme]]-initial stops alternate with fricatives and trills:&lt;ref name="CA"&gt;{{cite journal

This occurs when a morpheme is preceded by another morpheme within the same [[phrase]] (e.g. a [[prefix]] or an [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]]), unless the preceding morpheme ends itself in a fricative or trill, or in a nasal or {{IPA|/l/}}.
* {{IPA|/'''p'''əŋx/}} 'soup'
* {{IPA|/pənraj‿'''v'''əŋx/}} 'duck soup'
* {{IPA|/amsp‿'''v'''əŋx/}} 'kind of seal soup'
* but: {{IPA|/cxəf‿'''p'''əŋx/}} 'bear soup'

Only the morpheme-initial position is affected: other clusters ending in a stop are possible within a morpheme (e.g. {{IPA|/utku/}} "man").

In some [[transitive verb]]s, the process has been noted to apparently run in reverse (fricatives/trills fortiting to stops, with the same distribution). This has been taken a distinct process, but has also been explained to be fundamentally the same, with the [[citation form]] of these verbs containing an underlying stop, lenited due to the presence of a former ''i-'' prefix (which still survives in the citation form of other verbs, where it causes regular consonant alternation). Initial fricatives in nouns never change.&lt;ref name="CA"/&gt;

===Vowels===
The vowel system of Nivkh is unusual, being described by [[Ian Maddieson]] as "defective." It is actually a rotated system in which a gap in the mid front region of the [[vowel space]] is compensated for by moving vowels around. The centralised {{IPA|/ɤ/}} has been described by Maddieson (1984) as complementing a gap caused by the lack of an ordinary mid front vowel.

The mid front vowel expected in a five-vowel system may have in the past developed into a close-to-mid front unrounded diphthong, represented in Maddieson's description of the language as {{IPA|/ɪe/}}.

Stress can fall on any syllable, but tends to be on the first; there is dialectal variation, and minimal pairs distinguished by stress seem to be rare.&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Mattissen, ''Dependent-Head Synthesis in Nivkh: A Contribution to a Typology of Polysynthesis'' (John Benjamins Publishing, 2003; {{ISBN|9027229651}}), pp. 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Falkland Islanders]] (also called ''[[Kelpers]]'',&lt;ref name="Chater"&gt;Chater, Tony. ''The Falklands''. St. Albans: The Penna Press, 1996. p.&amp;nbsp;137. {{ISBN|0-9504113-1-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Falklanders'' or ''Malvineros'' and ''Malvinenses'' in Spanish) derive from various origins. Earliest among these are the numerically small but internationally diverse early 19th century inhabitants of the [[Falkland Islands]], comprising and descended in part from settlers brought by [[Luis Vernet]], and [[England|English]] and American sealers; [[South America]]n [[gaucho]]s who settled in the 1840s and 1850s; and since the late 1830s, settlers largely from [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] (especially Scotland and [[Wales]]) with a minority from other European countries. There has also been significant recent contributions from [[Saint Helena]] and [[Chile]].&lt;ref name="Fitz"&gt;FitzRoy, Robert.

==Early settlers==
[[Image:Hope-Place.jpg|thumb|300px|Falklands [[gaucho]]s having [[Yerba maté|mate]]. Watercolour by Dale, manager of Hope Place - Saladero in the 1850s.]]
Following the abandonment of the [[archipelago]] by the [[Spain|Spanish]] authorities in 1811, the only inhabitants of the islands were people who in their various capacities travelled back and forth, carried out a variety of commercial and shipping activities, sought refuge there, and through various efforts attempted to colonize the islands.  Most numerous by far among them were the [[English people|English]] and American [[Seal hunting|sealers]] who had pursued their industry on the Falklands at least since the 1770s, as pointed out by [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] [[Edward Livingston]].&lt;ref name="Maisch"&gt;Maisch, Christian J.  The Falkland/Malvinas Islands Clash of 1831-32: U.S. and British Diplomacy in the South Atlantic.  ''Diplomatic History'', Spring 2000, Vol. 24, Issue 2, pp. 185-209.&lt;/ref&gt;  The average number of English and American sealing vessels operating in the area is estimated between 40 and 50&lt;ref&gt;[http://200.49.145.7/museomaritimo.com//Ushuaia/Malvinas/malvinas02.php Islas Malvinas: Las Malvinas y el Archipiélago Fueguino, Museo Marítimo de Ushuaia].&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that several hundred to 1,000 sealers were involved.

The settlement of [[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Port Louis]], established by [[Luis Vernet|Vernet]] on the site of the former [[Spain|Spanish]] settlement of [[Puerto Soledad]], had about 100 inhabitants at its high point.  In his account of his voyages in {{HMS|Beagle}}, Captain [[Robert FitzRoy]] quoted references to the numbers and makeup of the inhabitants from a fellow officer who had previously visited Port Louis.  According to that source there were about 100 people in the settlement, comprising:

{{cquote|25 [[Gaucho]]s and 5 [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]], 2 [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]] Families, 2 or 3 [[English people|Englishmen]], a [[Germans|German]] family, the remainder were [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], pretending to follow some trade, but doing little or nothing.  The [[Gaucho]]s he said were [[Buenos Aires|Buenos Ayreans]] and their Capataz a [[French people|Frenchman]].&lt;ref name="Fitz" /&gt;}}

That population was reduced in 1831-32 by various means unconnected with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] arrival at [[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Port Louis]] on 2 January 1833.  Luis Vernet and his family left the Falklands, and returned to [[Buenos Aires]] in November 1831 following his action involving the use of force against local American sealers,&lt;ref name="Maisch" /&gt; while the United States warship [[USS Lexington (1825)|''USS Lexington'']], Commander [[Silas Duncan]] arrested 7 residents he deemed responsible for the detention of US sealing vessels, and also transported from the islands a further 33 persons including families.  In his report on the incident Duncan says:

{{cquote|But in taking this step I have consulted their own wishes, and they have embarked on board the [[USS Lexington (1825)|Lexington]] by general consent; they say they have been deceived by Vernet and others, who have kept many of them upon the Island contrary to their inclinations and appeared greatly Rejoiced at the opportunity thus presented of Removing with their families from a desolate Region where the climate is always cold and cheerless and the soil extremely unproductive.  These individuals some of whom have families, come from [[Buenos Aires|Buenos Ayres]] and [[Montevideo|Monte Video]], also, and are principally [[German people|Germans]]; they appear to be industrious and well disposed persons.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Report by Silas Duncan Commander U.S.S. Lexington sent to Navy Secretary Levi Woodbury|Report by Silas Duncan, Commander U.S.S. Lexington sent to Navy Secretary Levi Woodbury on 4 April 1932]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 5 January 1833, at the moment when the remaining [[United Provinces of the River Plate|Argentine]] military abandoned the islands,&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Soldiers and Civilians who left Port Louis|List of the soldiers and civilians who left Port Louis, Falkland Islands on the ''Sarandí'' on 5 January 1833, and the prisoners sent to Buenos Aires by José María Pinedo in the ''Rapid'' on 1 January 1833]].&lt;/ref&gt; 27 of the original [[Louis Vernet|Vernet]] settlers and 2 temporary residents remained in [[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Port Louis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Thomas Helsby's Account of the Port Louis Murders/Residents of Port Louis as of 5 January 1833|List of the residents of Port Louis, Falkland Islands as of 5 January 1833]].&lt;/ref&gt;  These included 12 [[gaucho]]s from [[United Provinces of the River Plate|Argentina]] and their ''Capataz'' (foreman); a [[French people|Frenchman]]; 5 [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] from [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]]; 3 women from mainland [[South America]] and their two children.  Other nationalities recorded are [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Scottish People|Scottish]], [[Germans|German]], and North American, making up a tiny population of some 7 different nationalities.

[[Image:Sapper-Hill-Corral.jpg|thumb|210px|Gaucho stone corral at [[Sapper Hill]], [[East Falkland]] (120&amp;nbsp;m in diameter, 3&amp;nbsp;m high); dated 1840s.]]

An insight into the state of the local population in March 1833 is provided by Captain [[Robert FitzRoy|Fitzroy]] who outlines the scene of a land based population that is vastly outnumbered by the many ships that ply their trade around the islands, the whole completely unregulated by any authority whatsoever:

{{cquote|The [[gaucho]]s wished to leave the place, and return to [[Río de la Plata|the Plata]], but as they were the only useful labourers on the islands, in fact, the only people on whom any dependence could be placed for a regular supply of fresh [[beef]], I interested myself as much as possible to induce them to remain, and with partial success, for seven staid out of twelve ... Although the climate is so much colder than that of Buenos Ayres, the gauchos sleep in the open air, when in the interior, under their saddles, just as they do in the latitude of 35°.  While idling at the settlement they gamble, quarrel, and fight with long knives, giving each other severe wounds.  With their loose [[poncho]]s, slouched hats, long hair, dark complexions, and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] eyes, they are characters fitter for the pencil of an artist than for the quiet hearth of an industrious settler.  Besides these gauchos, we saw five [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] (p. 267), who had been taken by the Buenos Ayrean troops, or their allies, and allowed to leave [[prison]] on condition of going with Mr. [[Luis Vernet|Vernet]] to the Falklands.  Including the crews of some thirty [[whaling|whale-ships]], hovering about or at anchor among the islands; the men of several American vessels, all armed with rifles; the [[England|English]] [[Seal hunting|sealers]] with their clubs, if not also provided with rifles; these cut-throat looking gauchos; the discontented, downcast Indian prisoners, and the crews of several [[France|French]] whalers — who could not or would not see why they had not as good a right to the islands as [[English people|Englishmen]] — there was no lack of the elements of discord; and it was with a heavy heart and gloomy forebodings that I looked forward to the months which might elapse without the presence of a [[man-of-war]], or the semblance of any regular authority.&lt;ref&gt;FitzRoy, Robert. ''Narrative of the surveying voyages of His Majesty's Ships Adventure and Beagle between the years 1826 and 1836, describing their examination of the southern shores of South America, and the Beagle's circumnavigation of the globe. Proceedings of the second expedition, 1831-36, under the command of Captain Robert Fitz-Roy, R.N.'' London: Henry Colburn, 1839. Chapter XIII, pp. 274-279.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Charles Darwin]], who visited the [[Falkland Islands|Falklands]] in 1833 and 1834, was greatly impressed by the expertise of his two gaucho assistants in the exploration of the interior of [[East Falkland]]:

{{cquote|St Jago soon separated a fat cow, he threw his [[Bolas|balls]], they hit her legs, but did not entangle her: he dropped his hat to mark the place where the balls fell, uncoiled his [[lasso|lazo]] &amp; again we commenced the chase; at last he caught her round the horns. (...)  Meat roasted with its skin (carne con cuero) is known over all these parts of [[South America|S. America]] for its excellence — it bears the same relation to common [[beef]], which [[venison]] does to [[mutton]]. — I am sure if any worthy [[alderman]] was once to taste it, carne con cuero would soon be celebrated in [[London]]. (...)  We slept in a valley in the neck of land which joins the [[Lafonia|Rincon del Toro]], the great peninsula to the southwest point of the island.  The valley was pretty well sheltered from the cold wind; but there was very little brushwood for making a fire; the Gauchos soon found what to my surprise made nearly as hot a fire as coals, it was the bones of a bullock, lately killed but all the flesh picked off by the Vultures.  They told me that in winter time they have often killed an animal, cleaned the flesh from the bones with their knives, &amp; then with these very bones roasted the meat for their dinner.  What curious resources will necessity put men to discover!&lt;ref&gt;[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=EHBeagleDiary&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=438 Darwin, Charles.

According to Lieutenant B.J. Sullivan’s survey of the [[Falkland Islands|Falklands]], corroborated by other sources, in 1838 the then single settlement of [[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Port Louis]] had a population of 40-45 residents including some [[gaucho]]s and women from among [[Luis Vernet]]’s settlers.&lt;ref name="Destéfani"&gt;Destéfani, Laurio H. ''The Malvinas, the South Georgias and the South Sandwich Islands, the conflict with Britain'', Buenos Aires: Edipress, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;  The population grew to 50 in 1841, and 200 by 1849, boosted by the building of [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], the new capital with better port facilities which was inaugurated in 1845. New arrivals included more [[gaucho]]s from [[South America]] and military pensioners, farmers and shepherds from the [[British Isles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.falklands.info/history/history4.html A Brief History of the Falkland Islands.  Part 4 - The British Colonial Era.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006062947/http://www.falklands.info/history/history4.html |date=6 October 2007 }} Falkland Islands Information Portal.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1851 Falklands [[Census]] recorded 20 men as ‘Gaucho’ by profession, mostly of ‘South American’ nationality, with 8 of them having wives and young children.&lt;ref name="Census-51"&gt;1851 Census Information, Falkland Islands Government Archives, Stanley.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Clement Moody]], the first British [[Governor of the Falkland Islands]], recommended in his Dispatch 13 of 1842:
{{cquote|The settlers best adapted to colonise these Islands would be from among the industrious population of the [[Orkney Islands|Orkneys]] and the [[Shetland]]s, accustomed to a hardy life and as much seamen as landmen...&lt;ref&gt;(13 March 1999) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/southamerica/falklandislands/721585/The-Falkland-Islands-South-Atlantic-dreamers.html "The Falkland Islands: South Atlantic dreamers"]. London. ''The Telegraph''. Retrieved 10 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===South American influence===
The earliest known Falklands settler was Carmelita Penny (Simon) who had arrived as a slave after 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Political Register|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=waZYAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA160|year=1832|publisher=D. Green|pages=160–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her sons José Simon, Manuel Coronel Jr. and Richard Penny Jr. were all native [[Falkland Islanders]] (born in 1831, 1834 and 1837 respectively), whose fathers had been resident in the islands since before 1833.  Among the prominent early Falkland Islanders of [[Buenos Aires|Buenos Ayrean]] origins were the gaucho Manuel Coronel Sr., Santiago Lopez ([[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ‘St Jago’), [[Germans|German]]-born Charles Kussler, [[Antonina Roxa]], and another slave Gregoria Madrid.  Most popular among them was Antonina Roxa whose hard work in several occupations (she was a skillful gaucho, and worked as such at Hope Place - Saladero) made her the owner of a {{convert|6000|acre|km2|0|sing=on}} farm and valuable real estate in [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]].&lt;ref name="Census-51" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Census-42"&gt;1842 Census Information, Falkland Islands Government Archives, Stanley.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[South America]]n contribution to the Falklander [[ethnogenesis]] is further recorded by Commodore Augusto Lasserre of the [[Armada of the Argentine Republic|Argentine Navy]], who traveled extensively around the islands; according to his account there were up to 20 [[Argentina|Argentine]]-born Islanders in 1869, ''"working either as labourers or foremen in the ranches, because in this kind of work they are better than the majority of the foreigners".''&lt;ref name="Destéfani" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lasserre, Augusto. Descripción de un viaje a las Malvinas.  ''El Río de la Plata'' Newspaper, Buenos Aires, 19–21 November 1869.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Falkland-Islands-Corrals.png|thumb|300px|Location of some Falkland Islands corrals.]]
The mainland [[South America]]n-born Falkland Islanders contributed to shaping the Falklander identity in the 1830s-1850s, and nowadays their legacy is visible in Falklands [[genealogy]], Falklands English [[vernacular]], and Falklands [[toponymy]].

A number of modern Falkland Islanders have some mainland [[South America]]ns among their 19th century ancestors, mostly [[Uruguay]]an [[gaucho]]s who settled in the islands in connection with the development of the [[cattle]] and [[sheep]] farming industry that was to form the backbone of the Falklands economy for rather more than a century, until the offshore [[fishery|fisheries]] assumed that role in the 1980s.  Eventually, gauchos took part in the colonization of the uninhabited [[West Falkland]] in the 1860s and 1870s, although by that time many of them were of [[European ethnic groups|European]] origins ([[Scottish People|Scottish]], [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarian]] etc.).  There are some two dozen [[dry stone|stone]] or [[peat|turf]]-built [[corral]]s scattered around [[Camp (Falkland Islands)|Camp]] — picturesque historical monuments of the 1840s-1870s, the epoch of pioneers who settled and developed the country outside [[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Port Louis]] and [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]].&lt;ref name="Spruce"&gt;Spruce, Joan. ''Corrals and Gauchos: Some of the people and places involved in the cattle industry''. Falklands Conservation Publication. Bangor: Peregrine Publishing, 1992. 48 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Falklands English vernacular has a fair amount of borrowed Spanish words (often modified or corrupted); they are particularly numerous, indeed dominant in the local horse-related terminology.  For instance, the Islanders use ‘alizan’, ‘colorao’, ‘negro’, ‘blanco’, ‘gotiao’, ‘picasso’, ‘sarco’, ‘rabincana’ etc. for certain horse colours and looks, or ‘bosal’, ‘cabresta’, ‘bastos’, ‘cinch’, ‘conjinilla’, ‘meletas’, ‘tientas’, ‘manares’ etc. for various items of horse gear.&lt;ref name="Spruce" /&gt;

Unlike the older [[England|English]], [[France|French]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] place names given by mariners, which refer mainly to islands, rocks, bays, coves, and capes (points) important for navigation, the post-1833 Spanish names usually identify inland geographical locations and features, reflecting the new practical necessity for orientation, land [[delimitation]] and management in the cattle and sheep farming.  Among the typical such names or descriptive and generic parts of names are ‘Rincon Grande’, ‘Ceritos’, ‘Campito’, ‘Cantera’, ‘Terra Motas’, ‘Malo River’, ‘Brasse Mar’, ‘Dos Lomas’, ‘Torcida Point’, ‘Pioja Point’, ‘Estancia’, ‘Oroqueta’, ‘Piedra Sola’, ‘Laguna Seco’, ‘Manada’, etc.&lt;ref name="Spruce" /&gt;

==Late nineteenth to early twentieth century==
The development of the sheep-breeding industry in the second half of the 19th century was accompanied by substantial immigration, increasing the population sevenfold in fifty years, from 287 in 1851 to 2,043 in 1901.&lt;ref name="Census 2001"&gt;[http://www.falklands.info/background/census2001t.html Falklands Census 2001: Tables.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301063015/http://www.falklands.info/background/census2001t.html |date=1 March 2010 }} Falkland Islands Information Portal.&lt;/ref&gt;  The vast majority of immigrants during that period came from the [[British Isles]], mostly from Scotland.  Scots were particularly common in [[Darwin, Falkland Islands|Darwin]], many of them coming from the [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] Islands, which have a similar climate to these areas.
{{cquote|In 1871, many shepherds situation on the [[Falkland Islands Company]]'s main farm at [[Darwin, Falkland Islands|Darwin]] were of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] origin, and members of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Kirk of Scotland]]. Finding a growing need for a minister of their own, they undertook, with the assistance of the Company to employ a minister for Darwin, and in 1872, Rev Yeoman took up the appointment. In 1873, an iron constructed church was brought from England and erected at Darwin. About this time, it was estimated that one third of the Falklands' population belonged to the [[Presbyterian]] church. (...)  As Stanley grew, the Darwin minister visited the town occasionally and held services in the infants' school.&lt;ref&gt;Strange, Ian J. ''The Falkland Islands''. Newton Abbot: David &amp; Charles, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An additional boost to that population growth came from the expansion of [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]]’s port activities in service of the ships sailing between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Pacific]] via the [[Strait of Magellan]] or [[Cape Horn]]. The port was particularly busy during the [[California Gold Rush]], subsiding following the opening of the [[Panama Canal]] in 1914.

The early 20th century brought about a new industry to the region, [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] [[whaling]] in [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]], that supported a transient population varying from few hundred in winter to over 1,000 in summer.  Some Falkland Islanders found employment with South Georgian whaling bases or ships, while some whalers settled in the Falklands to blend into the local populace.  The whalers were predominantly [[Scandinavia]]n ([[Norwegians]], [[Swedish people|Swedes]] and [[Danish people|Danes]]), with a minority of [[British people|Britons]], [[Germans]], and a variety of other [[European ethnic groups|European]] nations.  As a result of both natural demographic growth and ongoing immigration, the population of the Falkland Islands reached a peak of 2,392 recorded in the 1931 census, a figure that would not be surpassed until late in the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Census 2001" /&gt;

==Post-Falklands War==
[[Image:Falklands-youth.jpg|thumb|210px|Falklands' youth.]]
Having shrunk as low as 1,813 in 1980,&lt;ref name="Census 2001" /&gt; since the [[Falklands War]] the number of Falkland Islanders has been steadily increasing to exceed 3,100 in 2007.&lt;ref name="CIA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/fk.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That new growth was supported by a thriving economy, with wool [[monoculture]] giving way to a more diversified [[agriculture]], [[fishery|fisheries]] and [[tourism]], augmented with services related to the [[RAF Mount Pleasant|military garrison]] as well as to the islands' role as one of the major gateways to neighbouring [[Antarctica]].  According to the 2001 census, the people who have settled in the Falklands during the last decade originated from the United Kingdom (30 per cent of the entire population excepting those resident in connection with the military garrison, including however some children born abroad to Falklander parents), [[Saint Helena]] and [[Ascension Island]] (6 per cent; 15.8 per cent if people resident in connection with the military garrison were included,&lt;ref name="SHG"&gt;Government of Saint Helena.

Sofia: Manfred Wörner Foundation, 2003. 96 pp. {{ISBN|954-91503-1-3}})&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chile]] (3 per cent), Australia and New Zealand (2.3 per cent), [[Argentina]] (1 per cent), followed by Russia, Germany, with minor contributions by several dozens other nations from six continents.  It should be noted that children born abroad to Falkland Island women were enumerated in the 2001 census as being "Foreign-born".&lt;ref name="Census quote"&gt;Table 10 of the [http://www.falklands.info/background/census2001t.html Falklands Census 2001] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301063015/http://www.falklands.info/background/census2001t.html |date=1 March 2010 }} contained the note: "''Some of those born outside the Islands are children of persons from the Falkland Islands where the mother's confinement, for medical reasons, occurred overseas, but the child arrived within six months of birth''".&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Falkland Islanders were even born beyond the [[Antarctic Convergence]], most recently in the 1980s in the territory of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pelagic.co.uk/logbooks/log97ind/970206.html ''S/V Pelagic'', Log Entry for 6 February 1997].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horizon.co.fk/goldenfleecexp/english/poncet_en.html Golden Fleece Expedition Cruises].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of Falkland Islander identity==

[[Image:Lewis-Clifton.jpg|thumb|130px|Hon. Lewis Clifton OBE. Speaker, Falklands Legislative Council.]]

The Falkland Islanders are British by [[citizenship]], and by either origins or [[naturalization]].  They are one of the [[nation]]s and mini-nations of the  United Kingdom and the [[British overseas territories]], including also the [[English people|English]], [[Scottish people|Scots]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[Northern Irish people|Northern Irish]], [[Channel Islanders]], [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarians]], [[Saint Helenians]], [[Bermudians]], [[Caymanians]] etc.&lt;ref name="Future"&gt;L.L. Ivanov ''et al''. [[wikisource:The Future of the Falkland Islands and Its People|''The Future of the Falkland Islands and Its People''.]] Sofia: Manfred Wörner Foundation, 2003. Printed in Bulgaria by Double T Publishers. 96 pp.&amp;nbsp;{{ISBN|954-91503-1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with their common British identity, each of these has its own distinct identity shaped in the respective particular circumstances of political, economic, social and cultural evolution history.  According to Lewis Clifton, [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the [[Legislative Council of the Falkland Islands|Falklands Legislative Council]], the Falkland Islanders are no exception:

{{cquote|British cultural, economic, social, political and educational values create a unique British-like, Falkland Islands.  Yet Islanders feel distinctly different from their fellow citizens who reside in the United Kingdom.  This might have something to do with geographical isolation or with living on a smaller island – perhaps akin to those British people not feeling European.&lt;ref name="Clifton"&gt;Clifton, Lewis. The Falkland Islands: Self-government with an emerging national identity? ''News and Journal 2004, The 21st Century Trust''. London, 1999. pp.&amp;nbsp;16-19.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Besides geographical isolation, the emerging of a distinct Falkland Islander national identity along with the originally undifferentiated British identity was possibly influenced by the [[devolution]] processes taking place among the United Kingdom nations:

{{cquote|The recent devolution aspirations of Wales and Scotland may be a factor.  No sociological study has ever been commissioned to try to identify a plausible theory, and therefore it is difficult to elaborate on this emerging dichotomy, but significant sociological change has occurred.&lt;ref name="Clifton" /&gt;}}

Since the 1960s, the political dimension of Falklander identity has evolved around the campaign for recognition of the Islanders' right to [[self-determination]]. Key to this was the formation of the [[Falkland Island Committee]] in 1968, Britain's recognition of the right to self-determination after the Islanders turned down the so-called "[[leaseback proposal]]" put forward by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.falklands.info/history/history6.html A Brief History of the Falkland Islands.  Part 6 - The Build-Up to War.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111092315/http://www.falklands.info/history/history6.html |date=11 November 2007 }} Falkland Islands Information Portal.&lt;/ref&gt; and the new Falklands Constitution enacted in 1985. The constitution vests political power in the elected [[Legislative Council of the Falkland Islands|Falklands Legislative Council]] rather than the old style colonial governors.&lt;ref name="Clifton" /&gt;

[[Image:Mike-Summers.jpg|thumb|130px|Hon. [[Mike Summers]] OBE. Member of the [[Falkland Islands Legislative Assembly]].]]

A specific regional aspect of identity is the human relationship the Islanders traditionally maintain with [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.falklands.gov.fk/international-relations.php Falkland Islands Government website.  International Relations: Chile and Uruguay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408225447/http://www.falklands.gov.fk/international-relations.php |date=8 April 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the well-known Islander rejection of the [[Argentina|Argentine]] sovereignty claim:

{{cquote|In the Falkland Islands a national identity dynamic also exists: it is constructed upon the Islanders’ desire not to deal with Argentina.&lt;ref name="Clifton" /&gt;}}

The [[Falklands War]] had tremendous security, economic and social implications for the Falkland Islanders.  The War opened the prospects for long needed reforms, reversing the demographic, economic and social decline that the Falklands had suffered for several decades.  The Islanders became self-confident masters of their natural resources, and managers of a vibrant economy that attracted a wide range of new technical and managerial personnel to immigrate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.falklands.gov.fk/background.php Falkland Islands Government website.  Economy: Background] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107140453/http://www.falklands.gov.fk/background.php |date=7 November 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Falkland Islanders consider themselves a nation, the ethnogenesis of which is no different from that of other immigrant nations typical of the [[Americas]], Australia or New Zealand; indeed no different from the case of neighbouring [[South America]]n nations, as pointed out by [[Legislative Council of the Falkland Islands|Councillor]] [[Mike Summers]]:

{{cquote|We are as much a people as those in [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Brazil]] and [[Chile]] and many other South American countries whose inhabitants are of principally European or [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] descent.&lt;ref name="Summers"&gt;Summers, Mike.

{{Sociology}}
In [[sociology]], the '''popularity''' of a person, idea, item or other concept can be defined in terms of liking, [[Interpersonal attraction|attraction]], [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]] and superiority. With respect to interpersonal popularity, there are two primary divisions: perceived and sociometric.

According to psychologist Tessa Lansu at the [[Radboud University Nijmegen]], "Popularity [has] to do with being the middle point of a [[Social group|group]] and having [[Social influence|influence]] on it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ru.nl/sociology/@877216/popularity/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
[[File:Rebecca1917version.jpg|thumb|From the 1917 silent film ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1917 film)|Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'', this image shows one girl behaving with overt aggression towards another girl.]]

The term ''Popularity'' is borrowed from the Latin term ''popularis'', which originally meant "common." The current definition of the word popular, the "fact or condition of being well liked by the people", was first seen in 1601.&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=popular Etymology Online entry for Popular], 5 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

While popularity is a trait often ascribed to an individual, it is an inherently social phenomenon and thus can only be understood in the context of groups of people. Popularity is a collective perception, and individuals report the consensus of a group's feelings towards an individual or object when rating popularity. It takes a group of people to like something, so the more that people advocate for something or claim that someone is best liked, the more attention it will get, and the more popular it will be deemed.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;Scott, B. A., &amp; Judge, T. A. (2009). The popularity contest at work: Who wins, why, and what do they receive? ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', 94(1), 20-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding the above, popularity as a concept can be applied, assigned, or directed towards objects such as songs, movies, websites, activities, soaps, foods etc. Together, these objects collectively make up [[popular culture]], or the consensus of mainstream preferences in society. In essence, anything, human or non-human, can be deemed popular.

== Types of interpersonal popularity ==

For many years, popularity research focused on a definition of popularity that was based on being "well liked." Eventually, it was discovered that those who are ''perceived'' as popular are not necessarily the most well liked as originally assumed. When students are given the opportunity to freely elect those they like most and those they perceive as popular, a discrepancy often emerges.&lt;ref name="Lansu"&gt;Lansu, T. M., &amp; Cillessen, A. N. (2012). Peer status in [[emerging adulthood]]: Associations of popularity and preference with social roles and behavior. ''Journal of Adolescent Research'', 27(1), 132-150.&lt;/ref&gt; This is evidence that there are two main forms of personal popularity that social psychology recognizes, [[Sociometric status|sociometric]] popularity and perceived popularity.&lt;ref name=Cillessen-Rose&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cillessen |first1=Antonius |author2=Amanda J. Rose|title=Understanding popularity in the peer system|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |year=2005 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=102–105 |url=http://www.psy.miami.edu/faculty/dmessinger/c_c/rsrcs/rdgs/peers_social_general/Understanding_Popularty_Antonius.curdirpdf.pdf |accessdate=7 November 2012|publisher=American Psychological Society |doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00343.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sociometric popularity ===
Sociometric popularity can be defined by how liked an individual is. This ''liking'' is correlated with [[Prosocial behavior|prosocial behaviours]]. Those who act in prosocial ways are likely to be deemed sociometrically popular. Often they are known for their interpersonal abilities, their [[empathy]] for others, and their willingness to [[Cooperation|cooperate]] non-aggressively.&lt;ref name="Borch"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Borch |first1=Casey |author2=Allen Hyde, Antonius H. N. Cillessen|title=The role of attractiveness and aggression in high school popularity|journal=Social Psychology of Education|date=13 May 2010|volume=14|issue=1|pages=23–39|doi=10.1007/s11218-010-9131-1|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11218-010-9131-1|accessdate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a more private judgement, characterized by likeability, that will not generally be shared in a group setting.  Often, it is impossible to know whom individuals find popular on this scale unless confidentiality is ensured.&lt;ref name="Lansu" /&gt;

=== Perceived popularity ===
Perceived popularity is used to describe those individuals who are known among their peers as being popular. Unlike sociometric popularity, perceived popularity is often associated with aggression and dominance and is not dependent on prosocial behaviors. This form of popularity is often explored by the popular media. Notable works dealing with perceived popularity include ''[[Mean Girls]]'', ''[[Odd Girl Out]]'', and ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]''. Individuals who have perceived popularity are often highly socially visible and frequently emulated but rarely liked.&lt;ref name=Cillessen-Rose /&gt; Since perceived popularity is a measure of visible reputation and emulation, this form of popularity is most openly discussed, agreed upon within a group, and what most people refer to when they call someone popular.&lt;ref name="Lansu" /&gt;

==Comprehensive theories==

To date, only one comprehensive theory of interpersonal popularity has been proposed: that of A. L. Freedman in the book ''[http://www.popularityexplained.com/ Popularity Explained].''  The 3 Factor Model proposed attempts to reconcile the two concepts of sociometric and perceived popularity by combining them orthogonally and providing distinct definitions for each. In doing so, it reconciles the counter intuitive fact that liking does not guarantee perceived popularity nor does perceived popularity guarantee being well liked.

==="Popularity Explained"===

'[http://www.popularityexplained.com/ 'Popularity Explained']' was first published as a blog before being converted to a book and various versions have been available on Amazon since 2013.

====Conceptual foundations====
There are four primary concepts that ''Popularity Explained'' relies on.

#'''Liking and attraction are not the same.''' The interpersonal feeling of "liking" is not the same as "attraction" and that both are responsible for different human behaviours. The neurological evidence of this comes from the research of [[Kent C. Berridge]] and his [[incentive salience]] model. ''Popularity Explained'' extrapolates the conclusions of this research and applies it to human-human interpersonal interactions.
#'''A hierarchy of interpersonal attraction exists in all social groups.''' ''Popularity Explained'' develops a very broad definition of [[interpersonal attraction]] asserting that it is based on a multitude of different factors but primarily those of: socioeconomic status; interpersonal similarity; physical appearance; and efficacy. It proposes the concept of a "Hierarchy of Attraction" which, in simple terms, is just a stylized bell curve that illustrates how attractive people are relative to each other in terms of a percentile.
#'''Interpersonal attraction (in the broadest sense) results in Input of Energy.''' Input of Energy is the interpersonal actions that an individual takes, consciously and unconsciously, when they experience an interpersonal attraction. Examples of Input of Energy given in the book include: attempts at physical proximity; changes in verbal communications; changes to non-verbal communication; biased interpersonal judgements; cognitive intrusion; and helping behaviour.
#'''Sociometric and perceived popularity are correlated but not equivalent.''' By combining these two concepts, ''Popularity Explained'' defines eight prototypical student types that can be plotted on the single graph.

====Three-factor model====

According to Freedman, an individual's place in the social landscape is determined by a combination of three factors: ''what'' they are; ''who'' they are; and the situation.
 
#''What'' refers to all those aspects of a person that are objective: participation in sports, physical appearance, etc. Perceived popularity is primarily the result of what a person is. It is mediated by Input of Energy combining with the Hierarchy of Attraction. This preferential receipt of Input of Energy by a select few is what propels them to the "popular" side of the graph that combines sociometric and perceived popularity. 
#''Who'' refers to the personality of the individual and how they treat other people. It is this factor that is responsible for determining where a student sits along the "liking" and "disliking" dimensions that characterize a student. The more pro-social an individual, the more they will be liked. 
#The Situation refers to the circumstances that an individual finds themself in. Different circumstances may result in different social outcomes. For example, the same student may be perceived as popular when in the social context of their church youth group but unpopular within the social context of their school as a whole.

== Interpersonal causes ==
[[File:1922 Locust yearbook p. 171 (Popularity).jpg|thumb|"Popularity" artwork featured in [[East Texas State Normal College]]'s 1922 ''Locust'' yearbook]]

One of the most widely agreed upon theories about what leads to an increased level of popularity for an individual is the perceived value which that individual brings to the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berger|first1=Joseph|author2=Fişek, M. Hamit|title=Diffuse Status Characteristics and the Spread of Status Value: A Formal Theory|journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=1 January 2006 |volume=111|issue=4|pages=1038–1079|doi=10.1086/498633 |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1086/498633?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103978062153 |deadurl=no |accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to be true for members of all groups, but is especially demonstrable in groups that exist for a specific purpose. For example, sports teams exist with the goal of being successful in competitions against other sports teams. Study groups exist so that the members of the group can mutually benefit from one another's academic knowledge. In these situations, leaders often emerge because other members of the group perceive them as adding a lot of value to the group as a whole. On a sports team, this means that the best players are usually elected captain and in study groups people might be more inclined to like an individual who has a lot of knowledge to share.&lt;ref name=Borch /&gt; It has been argued that this may be a result of our evolutionary tendencies to favor individuals who are most likely to aid in our own survival.&lt;ref name=Kanazawa&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kanazawa |first1=Satoshi |author2=Jody L Kovar|title=Why beautiful people are more intelligent|journal=Intelligence|date=May–June 2004|volume=32|issue=3|pages=227–243|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289604000352|accessdate=7 November 2012|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2004.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also of note that the actual value which an individual brings to a group is not of consequence in determining his or her popularity; the only thing that is important is his or her value as perceived by the other members of the group. While perceived value and actual value may often overlap, this is not a requisite and it has been shown that there are instances in which an individual's actual value is relatively low, but they are perceived as highly valuable nevertheless.&lt;ref name=Mulford /&gt;

=== Attractiveness ===
[[Physical attractiveness|Attractiveness]], specifically physical attractiveness, has been shown to have very profound effects on popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Bruyn |first1=Eddy H. |author2=van den Boom, Dymphna C.|title=Interpersonal Behavior, Peer Popularity, and Self-esteem in Early Adolescence|journal=Social Development|date=1 November 2005|volume=14|issue=4|pages=555–573|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9507.2005.00317.x
|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9507.2005.00317.x/full|accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People who are physically attractive are more likely to be thought of as possessing positive traits. People who are attractive are expected to perform better on tasks and are more likely to be trusted.&lt;ref name=Mulford&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mulford|first1=Mathew|author2=John Orbell, Catherine Shatto, and Jean Stockard|title=Physical Attractiveness, Opportunity, and Success in Everyday Exchange|journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=May 1998|volume=103|issue=6|pages=1565–1592|doi=10.1086/231401|jstor=10.1086/231401}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, they are judged to possess many other positive traits such as mental health, intelligence, social awareness, and dominance.&lt;ref name=Feingold&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feingold|first=Alan|title=Good-looking people are not what we think|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=March 1992|volume=111|issue=2|pages=304–341|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.111.2.304 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/?&amp;fa=main.doiLanding&amp;doi=10.1037/0033-2909.111.2.304 |deadurl=no |accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, people who are of above average attractiveness are assumed to also be of above average value to the group. Research shows that attractive people are often perceived to have many positive traits based on nothing other than their looks, regardless of how accurate these perceptions are.&lt;ref name=Webster&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster Jr.|first1=Murray|author2=James E. Driskell, Jr.|title=Beauty as Status|journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=July 1983|volume=89|issue=1|pages=140–165|jstor=2779050|doi=10.1086/227836}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon is known as the [[Halo effect]]&lt;ref name=Mulford /&gt; This means that, in addition to being more well-liked, attractive people are more likely to be seen as bringing actual value to the group, even when they may be of little or no value at all. In essence, physically attractive people are given the benefit of the doubt while less attractive individuals must prove that they are bringing value to the group.&lt;ref name=Borch /&gt;  It has been shown empirically that being physically attractive is correlated with both sociometric and perceived popularity. Some possible explanations for this include increased social visibility and an increased level of tolerance for aggressive, social interactions that may increase perceived popularity.&lt;ref name=Borch /&gt;

=== Aggression ===
The degree to which an individual is perceived as popular is often highly correlated with the level of aggression with which that individual interacts with his or her peers. There are two main categories of aggression, relational and overt, both of which have varying consequences for popularity depending on several factors, such as the gender and attractiveness of the aggressor.&lt;ref name=Crick&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crick |first1=Nicki R. |last2=Grotpeter|first2=Jennifer K.|title=Relational Aggression, Gender, and Social-Psychological Adjustment |journal=Child Development|date=1 June 1995|&lt;!-- year=2008 ???--&gt;|volume=66|issue=3|pages=710–722|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1995.tb00900.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relational aggression ====
[[Relational aggression]] is nonviolent aggression that is emotionally damaging to another individual. Examples of relationally aggressive activities include ignoring or excluding an individual from a group, delivering personal insults to another person, and the spreading of rumors. Relational aggression is more frequently used by females than males.&lt;ref name=Borch /&gt;

It has been found that relational aggression almost always has a strongly negative relationship with sociometric popularity but can have a positive relationship with perceived popularity depending on the perceived level of attractiveness of the aggressor. For an aggressor who is perceived as unattractive, relational aggression, by both males and females, leads to less perceived popularity. For an attractive aggressor however, relational aggression has been found to actually have a positive relationship with perceived popularity.&lt;ref name=Borch /&gt;

The relationship between attractiveness and aggression is further intertwined by the finding that increased levels of physical attractiveness actually further decreased the sociometric popularity of relationally aggressive individuals.&lt;ref name=Borch /&gt;

In short, the more physically attractive an individual is, the more likely they are to experience decreased levels of sociometric popularity but increased levels of perceived popularity for engaging in relationally aggressive activities.

==== Overt aggression ====
Overt aggression is aggression that involves individuals physically interacting with each other in acts such as pushing, hitting, kicking or otherwise causing physical harm or submission in the other person. This includes threats of violence and physical intimidation as well.

It has been shown that overt aggression directly leads to perceived popularity when the aggressor is attractive.&lt;ref name=Cillessen-Rose /&gt; Experiments that are controlled for levels of physical attractiveness show that individuals who are attractive and overtly aggressive have a higher degree of perceived popularity than attractive non-overtly aggressive individuals. This was found to be true to a small degree for females and a large degree for males.&lt;ref name=Borch /&gt;

Attractive individuals who are overtly aggressive barely suffer any consequences in terms of sociometric popularity. This is a key difference between overt and relational aggression because relational aggression has a strongly negative relationship on sociometric popularity, especially for attractive individuals. For unattractive individuals, there is again a strongly negative relationship between overt aggression and sociometric popularity.&lt;ref name=Borch /&gt; This means that attractive individuals stand to gain a lot of perceived popularity at the cost of very little sociometric popularity by being overtly aggressive while unattractive individuals stand to gain very little perceived popularity from acts of overt aggression but will be heavily penalized with regards to sociometric popularity.

=== Cultural factors ===
According to Talcott Parsons, as rewritten by Fons Trompenaars,
there are four main types of culture : marked by love/hate (Middle East, Mediterranean, Latin America) approval/criticism (United Kingdom, Canada, Scandinavia, Germanic countries) esteem/contempt (Japan, Eastern Asia). The last one, responsiveness/rejection, is typical for the United States. 
&lt;br /&gt;
There is no effort for popularity in Northern or Southern Europe, Latin America or Asia. This emotional bonding is specific for the high schools of the United States. 
In the love/hate cultures, the family and close friends are more important than popularity. In the approval/criticism cultures, actions are more important than persons, no strong links develop during school.

=== Demographic differences ===

==== Maturity ====
Popularity is gauged primarily through social status.  Because of the importance of social status, peers play the primary role in social decision making so that individuals can increase the chances that others like them.  However, as children, individuals tend to do this through friendship, academics, and interpersonal conduct.&lt;ref name="Adler" /&gt;  By adulthood, work and romantic relationships become much more important. This peer functioning and gaining popularity is a key player in increasing interest in social networks and groups in the workplace.  To succeed in such a work environment, adults then place popularity as a higher priority than any other goal, even romance.&lt;ref name="Lansu"/&gt;

==== Gender ====
These two types of popularity, perceived popularity and sociometric popularity, are more correlated for girls than they are for boys. However, it is said that men can possess these qualities to a larger extent, making them more likely to be a leader, more powerful, and more central in a group, but also more likely than women to be socially excluded.&lt;ref name="Lansu" /&gt;  Boys tend to become popular based on athletic ability, coolness, toughness, and interpersonal skills; however, the more popular a boy gets, the worse he tends to do on his academic work.  On the other hand, this negative view of academics is not seen at all in popular girls, who gain popularity based on family background (primarily socioeconomic status), physical appearance, and social ability. Boys are also known to be more competitive and rule focused, whereas girls have more emotional intimacy.&lt;ref name="Adler"&gt;Adler, P. A., Kless, S. J., &amp; Adler, P. (1992). Socialization to gender roles: Popularity among elementary school boys and girls. ''Sociology Of Education'', 65(3), 169-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Race ====
In some instances, it has been found that in predominantly white high schools, attractive non-white students are on average significantly more sociometrically popular than equally attractive white students. One theory that has been put forth to explain this phenomenon is a high degree of [[group cohesiveness]] among minority students compared with the relative lack of cohesion amongst members of the majority.  Since there is more cohesion, there is more availability for one person to be liked by many since they are all in contact.  This acts like [[Zipf's Law]], where the cohesion is a confounding factor that forces the greater links in the smaller minority, causing them to be more noticed and thus more popular.&lt;ref name=Card&gt;{{cite book|last1=Card|first1=Noel|title=Modeling Dyadic and Interdependent Data in the Developmental and Behavioral Sciences |location=New York, NY|pages=61–86|author2=Antonius Cillessen|authorlink=Analyzing social networks in adolescence|author3=Casey Borch |date=1 July 2008 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/?&amp;fa=main.doiLanding&amp;doi=10.1037/0033-2909.111.2.304 |deadurl=no |accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When considering race as a predictor for perceived popularity by asking a class how popular and important each other person is, African American students were rated most popular by their peers.  Popularity in race was found to be correlated with athleticism, and because African Americans have a stereotype of being better at sports than individuals of other races, they are viewed as more popular. Additionally, White and Hispanic children were rated as more popular the better they succeeded in school and came from a higher socioeconomic background. No single factor can explain popularity, but instead the interaction between many factors such as race and athleticism vs. academics.&lt;ref name=Kennedy&gt;Kennedy, E. (1995). Correlates of perceived popularity among peers: A study of race and gender differences among middle school students. ''The Journal of Negro Education'', 64, 186-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of popularity in the workplace ==

=== Importance ===
More tasks in the workplace are being done in teams, leading to a greater need of people to seek and feel social approval.&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt; In academic settings, a high social standing among peers is associated with positive academic outcomes.&lt;ref name="Eder"&gt;Eder, D. (1985). The cycle of popularity: Interpersonal relations among female adolescents. Sociology Of Education, 58(3), 154-165.&lt;/ref&gt; Popularity also leads to students in academic environments to receive more help, have more positive relationships and stereotypes, and be more approached by peers.&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt; While this is the research found in schools, it is likely to be generalized to a workplace.

=== Benefits ===
Popularity is positively linked to job satisfaction, individual job performance, and group performance.&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt;  The popular worker, besides just feeling more satisfied with his job, feels more secure, believes he has better working conditions, trusts his supervisor, and possesses more positive opportunities for communication with both management and co-workers, causing a greater feeling of responsibility and belongingness at work.&lt;ref name="SVan"&gt;SVan Zelst, R. H. (1951). Worker popularity and job satisfaction. ''Personnel Psychology'', 4, 405-412.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others prefer to work with popular individuals, most notably in manual labor jobs because, although they might not be the most knowledgeable for the job, they are approachable, willing to help, cooperative in group work, and are more likely to treat their coworkers as an equal.  If an employee feels good-natured, genial, but not overly independent, more people will say that they most prefer to work with that employee.&lt;ref name="Porter"&gt;Porter, L. W., &amp; Ghiselli, E. E. (1960). A self-description scale measuring sociometric popularity among manual workers. ''Personnel Psychology'', 13, 141-146.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contributing factors ===
According to the [[mere-exposure effect]], employees in more central positions that must relate to many others throughout the day, such as a manager, are more likely to be considered popular.&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt;
There are many characteristics that contribute to popularity:&lt;ref name="Hawkins"&gt;Hawkins, K. (2012). Why Popularity At Work Matters And How To Achieve It. Officepro, 72(2), 22-25.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Expressing and acting in genuine ways - others will turn away if they can detect that someone is being fake to them
*Focusing on positive energy - others will feel too drained to be around someone if their interactions are not started on a positive note or they don't have empathy to share in someone else's positive news
*Treating others with respect - others do not like to be around someone if they aren't treated equally and acknowledged for their hard work
*Create connections - others are more likely to approach individuals they have strong relationships with; these can be built by talking about more personal issues, attending work gatherings, and communicating outside the office walls
*Patience - turning away too quickly ignores that relationships take time to grow, especially in the busy and stressful environments that work often induces
*Incorporating others - others feel a sense of trust and belongingness when they are asked for help on a project&lt;ref name="Porter" /&gt;
*Hands-on or servant leader- Its a person that will do the work before anyone else, be the first to do the less desirable  jobs, and have a positive  attitude  about it.

=== Leadership popularity ===
With a greater focus on groups in the workplace, it is essential that leaders effectively deal with and mediate groups to avoid clashing. Sometimes a leader does not need to be popular to be effective, but there are a few characteristics that can help a leader be more accepted and better liked by his group. Without group or team cohesiveness, there is no correlation between leadership and popularity; however, when a group is cohesive, the higher up someone is in the leadership hierarchy, the more popular they are for two reasons.&lt;ref name="Theodorson"&gt;Theodorson, G. A. (1957). The relationship between leadership and popularity roles in small groups. ''American Sociological Review'', 22, 58-67.&lt;/ref&gt;  First, a cohesive group feels more personal responsibility for their work, thus placing more value on better performance. Cohesive members see leaders as taking a bulk of the work and investing a lot of personal time, so when they see a job's value they can ascribe its success to the leader. This greatest contribution principle is perceived as a great asset to the team, and members view the leader more favorably and he gains popularity.&lt;ref name="Theodorson" /&gt; Secondly, cohesive groups have well established group values. Leaders can become more popular in these groups by realizing and acting on dominant group values.  Supporting group morals and standards leads to high positive valuation from the group, leading to popularity.&lt;ref name="Turk"&gt;Turk, H. (1961). Instrumental values and the popularity of instrumental leaders. ''Social Forces'', 39, 252-260.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The popularity of objects as a consequence of social influence ==

=== Information cascades ===
Poplularity is a term widely applicable to the modern era thanks primarily to social networking technology. Being "liked" has been taken to a completely different level on ubiquitous sites such as [[Facebook]].

Popularity is a social phenomenon but it can also be ascribed to objects that people interact with. Collective attention is the only way to make something popular, and information cascades play a large role in rapid rises in something's popularity. Rankings for things in popular culture, like movies and music, often do not reflect the public's taste, but rather the taste of the first few buyers because [[social influence]] plays a large role in determining what is popular and what is not through an [[information cascade]].

Information cascades have strong influence causing individuals to imitate the actions of others, whether or not they are in agreement. For example, when downloading music, people don't decide 100% independently which songs to buy. Often they are influenced by charts depicting which songs are already trending.  Since people rely on what those before them do, one can manipulate what becomes popular among the public by manipulating a website's download rankings.&lt;ref name="Cornell"&gt;, Cornell Course INFO 2040 blog. (2011). Information Cascade in Music. ''Networks''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Experts paid to predict sales often fail but not because they are bad at their jobs; instead, it is because they cannot control the information cascade that ensues after first exposure by consumers. Music is again, an excellent example. Good songs rarely perform poorly on the charts and poor songs rarely perform very well, but there is tremendous variance that still makes predicting the popularity of any one song very difficult.&lt;ref name="Salganik"&gt;Salganik, J. (2006). Experimental Study of Inequality and Unpredictability in and Artificial Cultural Market. ''Science'', 311, 854-856.&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts can determine if a product will sell in the top 50% of related products or not, but it is difficult to be more specific than that. Due to the strong impact that influence plays, this evidence emphasizes the need for marketers. They have a significant opportunity to show their products in the best light, with the most famous people, or being in the media most often. Such constant exposure is a way of gaining more product followers. Marketers can often make the difference between an average product and a popular product. However, since popularity is primarily constructed as a general consensus of a group's attitude towards something, [[Word-of-mouth marketing|word-of-mouth]] is a more effective way to attract new attention.  Websites and blogs start by recommendations from one friend to another, as they move through social networking services. Eventually, when the fad is large enough, the media catches on to the craze. This spreading by word-of-mouth is the social information cascade that allows something to grow in usage and attention throughout a social group until everyone is telling everyone else about it, at which point it is deemed popular.&lt;ref name="Leskovec"&gt;Leskovec, J., Singh, A., and Kleinberg, J. Patterns of Influence in a Recommendation Network.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals also rely on what others say when they know that the information they are given could be completely incorrect. This is known as [[groupthink]].  Relying on others to influence one's own decisions is a very powerful social influence, but can have negative impacts.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson, L. and Holt, C. (1997). Information cascades in the laboratory ''The American Economic Review'', 87, 847-863.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zipf's Law ===
[[File:Facebook popularity.PNG|thumb|left|The popularity of [[Facebook]] over time illustrating Zipf's Law]]

The popularity of many different things can be described by [[Zipf's Law|Zipf's powerlaw]] which posits that there is a low frequency of very large quantities and a high frequency of low quantities. This illustrates popularity of many different objects.

For example, there are few very popular websites, but many websites have small followings. This is the result of interest; as many people use e-mail, it is common for sites like [[Yahoo!]] to be accessed by large numbers of people; however, a small subset of people would be interested in a blog on a particular [[video game]].  In this situation, only Yahoo! would be deemed a popular site by the public.&lt;ref name="Adamic"&gt;Adamic, L. (2002). Zipf, power-laws, and pareto-a ranking tutorial.  ''Glottometrics'', 3, 143-150.&lt;/ref&gt;  This can additionally be seen in [[social networking service]]s, such as [[Facebook]]. The majority of people have about 130 friends, while very few people have larger social networks.  However, some individuals do have more than 5,000 friends. This reflects that very few people can be extremely well-connected, but many people are somewhat connected. The number of friends a person has, has been a way to determine how popular an individual is, so the small number of people who have an extremely high number of friends is a way of using social networking services, like Facebook, to illustrate how only a few people are deemed popular.&lt;ref name="dunbar"&gt;Dunbar, R. (2010). You've got to have (150) friends. ''New York Times'' December 25&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Clear}}

Popular people may not be those who are best liked interpersonally by their peers, but they do receive most of the positive behavior from coworkers when compared to nonpopular workers.&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt; This is a result of the differences between sociometric and perceived popularity. When asked who is most popular, employees typically respond based on perceived popularity; however, they really prefer the social interactions with those who are more sociometrically popular.  For each individual to ensure that they are consistent with the group's popularity consensus, those who are high in perceived popularity are treated with the same positive behaviors as those who are more interpersonally, but privately, liked by specific individuals. Well-liked workers are most likely to get salary increases and promotions, while disliked (unpopular) workers are the first to get their salary cut back or laid off during recessions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

During interactions with others in the work environment, more popular individuals receive more organizational citizenship behavior (helping and courteousness from others) and less counter productive work behavior (rude reactions and withheld information) than those who are considered less popular in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt; Coworkers agree with each other on who is and who is not popular and, as a group, treat popular coworkers more favorably. While popularity has proven to be a big determiner of getting more positive feedback and interactions from coworkers, such a quality matters less in organizations where workloads and interdependence is high, such as the medical field.&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt;

In many instances, physical appearance has been used as one indicator of popularity. Attractiveness plays a large role in the workplace and physical appearance influences hiring, whether or not the job might benefit from it. For example, some jobs, such as salesperson, benefit from attractiveness when it comes down to the bottom line, but there have been many studies which have shown that, in general, attractiveness is not at all a valid predictor of on-the-job performance.&lt;ref name="Shahani"&gt;Shahani-Denning, C., Dudhat, P., Tevet, R., &amp; Andreoli, N. (2010). Effect of Physical Attractiveness on Selection Decisions in India and the United States. ''International Journal of Management'', 27(1), 37-51.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many individuals have previously thought this was only a phenomenon in the more individualistic cultures of the Western world, but research has shown that attractiveness also plays a role in hiring in collectivist cultures as well.  Because of the prevalence of this problem during the hiring process in all cultures, researchers have recommended training a group to ignore such influencers, just like legislation has worked to control for differences in sex, race, and disabilities.&lt;ref name="Shahani" /&gt;

Most prostitutes in Laos are from poor rural Laotian families and [[List of ethnic groups in Laos|the country's ethnic minorities]]. In addition to these, there are many prostitutes in Laos from [[China]] and Vietnam,&lt;ref name=MSF&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Laos|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=seglAAAAQBAJ|last=Stuart-Fox|first=Martin|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2008|isbn=9780810864115|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some Laotian women go to Thailand to work as sex workers.&lt;ref name=FandD/&gt; Laos has been identified as a source country for women and girls trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation in Thailand.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2008/105388.htm |title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2008: Laos|date=4 June 2008 |website=www.state.gov |publisher=U.S. Department of State |access-date=21 September 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many female sex workers in Laos are at high risk of [[sexually transmitted infection]] (STI) and disease. They often have limited access to treatment and services due to cultural sensitivity regarding sexuality and pre-marital sex.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==History==
The establishment of the [[French Protectorate of Laos]] in 1893 resulted in the arrival of French civil servants who took "local wives" while posted in the country. Prostitution increased during the [[First Indochina War]] and the [[Vietnam War]] as a result of the presence of foreign troops in Laos. At this time prostitutes came from Thailand to work in the nightclubs and bars of the capital city [[Vientiane]]. During the 1960s and 1970s the country's involvement in the Vietnam War led to Vientiane becoming famous for its brothels and [[ping pong show]] bars.&lt;ref name=FandD&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factsanddetails.com/southeast-asia/Laos/sub5_3b/entry-2961.html |title=Sex in Laos |author=Jeffrey Hays |date=2008 |website=Facts and Details|access-date=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the 1950s, prostitution was discouraged by the Lao government as a social evil.&lt;ref name="Kislenko-2009" /&gt;{{RP|154}} When the Lao People's Democratic Republic was established in 1975, prostitution was criminalised.&lt;ref name=MSF/&gt; Brothels were prohibited by law and disappeared from the country.&lt;ref name=RetireAsia/&gt; Prostitutes were initially interned in rehabilitation camps called ''don nang'' ("women's island"), though this practice was later discontinued.&lt;ref name="Phrasisombath-2012" /&gt;  In the 1990s, tourism and nightclubs returned to the country and with them prostitution became evident again.&lt;ref name=MSF/&gt;

==Reasons for prostitution==
Poverty in Laos is a cause of increased prostitution in the country, with the sex industry in neighbouring Thailand attracting sex workers from Laos.&lt;ref name="Kislenko-2009" /&gt;{{RP|134}} By 2011, changing socio-economic conditions in rural Laos had resulted in Laotian women from the [[Khmu]] ethnic minority becoming predominant at the lower end of the Laotian sex industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality|title=Trade circles: aspirations and ethnicity in commercial sex in Laos|last1=Lyttleton|first1=Chris|last2= Vorabouth|first2= Sisouvanh|doi=10.1080/13691058.2011.562307|pmid=21442500|date=24 Mar 2011|volume=13|issue=sup2|pages=S263–S277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research published in 2012 indicated that sex workers considered the profession to be "an easy and good source of income compared to other jobs". They also said that it had the advantage of being "suitable for a low-educated person because working in a bar does not require formal training or skills and is quickly learned."&lt;ref name="Phrasisombath-2012" /&gt;

==Locations used for prostitution==
Brothels are prohibited by Lao law.&lt;ref name=RetireAsia/&gt; Female sex workers in Laos are often employed as hostesses in places of entertainment, such as beer [[bar]]s, "drinkshops", [[karaoke bars]], [[nightclubs]], [[guest house]]s and [[restaurant]]s. They serve beer and snacks and provide conversation as well as selling sex. [[Pimp]]s are sometimes used to find clients. Sexual services are provided in guest houses, hotels, or the client's room, which are usually attached to places of entertainment. Otherwise they tend to take place in remote areas.&lt;ref name="Phrasisombath-2012" /&gt; The country's [[Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone]] in [[Bokeo Province]] has been called "a mecca of gambling, prostitution and illicit trade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jonathan Kaiman |title=In Laos' economic zone, a casino and illicit trade beckon in 'lawless playground' |url=http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-ff-laos-golden-triangle-20150908-story.html |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=8 September 2015 |access-date=13 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual health ==
Research conducted into female sex workers published in 2011 indicated that while 99% of them reported using condoms, 26% had had an abortion. Of those that had been pregnant in the last 6 months, 89.4% had had an abortion.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-08-01|title=Falling through the cracks: contraceptive needs of female sex workers in Cambodia and Laos|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782410006414|journal=Contraception|language=en|volume=84|issue=2|pages=194–198|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2010.11.003|pmid=21757062|issn=0010-7824|last1=Morineau|first1=Guy|last2=Neilsen|first2=Graham|last3=Heng|first3=Sopheab|last4=Phimpachan|first4=Chansy|last5=Mustikawati|first5=Dyah E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortions in Laos are not only illegal, but also are generally performed in unsafe conditions by untrained practitioners.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sychareun|first=Vanphanom|date=18 May 2004|title=Meeting the Contraceptive Needs of Unmarried Young People: Attitudes of Formal and Informal Sector Providers in Vientiane Municipality, Lao PDR|journal=Reproductive Health Matters|language=en|volume=12|issue=23|pages=155–165|doi=10.1016/s0968-8080(04)23117-2|issn=0968-8080}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, only 42% of all births were attended by skilled health professionals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2004, infection rates of [[chlamydia]] and [[gonorrhea]] were 33 and 18%. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Lao government implemented a national strategic and action plan in 2005, aimed at expanding universal access to treatment, support, and care. The primary target groups included females sex workers, mobile populations and drug users. However, the plan has not had much of an impact due to the quality of STI services being relatively limited in Laos.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Access to information and treatment regarding AIDS/HIV/STIs remains limited in Laos due to a conservative culture and sensitivity towards sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phrasisombath|first=Ketkesone|last2=Thomsen|first2=Sarah|last3=Sychareun|first3=Vanphanom|last4=Faxelid|first4=Elisabeth|date=2012-02-14|title=Care seeking behaviour and barriers to accessing services for sexually transmitted infections among female sex workers in Laos: a cross-sectional study|journal=BMC Health Services Research|language=En|volume=12|issue=1|pages=37|doi=10.1186/1472-6963-12-37|issn=1472-6963|pmc=3347996|pmid=22333560}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many individuals reported a fear of going to health facilities for treatment due to social discrimination regarding pre-marital sex and "clinicians' negative attitudes towards 'dirty disease'".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sihavong|first=Amphoy|last2=Lundborg|first2=Cecilia Stålsby|last3=Syhakhang|first3=Lamphone|last4=Kounnavong|first4=Sengchanh|last5=Wahlström|first5=Rolf|last6=Freudenthal|first6=Solveig|date=7 January 2011|title=Community Perceptions and Treatment-Seeking Behaviour Regarding Reproductive Tract Infections Including Sexually Transmitted Infections in Lao PDR: A Qualitative Study|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-biosocial-science/article/community-perceptions-and-treatmentseeking-behaviour-regarding-reproductive-tract-infections-including-sexually-transmitted-infections-in-lao-pdr-a-qualitative-study/FD0B5F2267269BA2AEDD7E9FD4E32877|journal=Journal of Biosocial Science|language=en|volume=43|issue=3|pages=285–303|doi=10.1017/S002193201000074X|pmid=21211093|issn=1469-7599}}&lt;/ref&gt; A general lack of knowledge exists in Laos regarding [[Reproductive tract infection|RTI]]/STIs. The main sources of information are radio and television. However, access to health information is even more difficult in rural areas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One study suggested that providers of contraceptive information and supplies are influenced by Lao norms, which disapprove of pre-marital sex, and stigmatize women who do seek contraceptive services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===HIV/AIDS===
{{see also|HIV/AIDS in Laos}}
In 2004, between 0.8 percent and 4.2 percent of female sex workers in Laos were estimated to be infected with [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="Phrasisombath-2012" /&gt; In 2015 the HIV prevalence for the total Laos population was 0.2 percent with 1096 new infections and 128 AIDS related deaths.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpro.who.int/hiv/data/countries/lao/en/|title=Country profiles on HIV/AIDS|website=WHO Western Pacific Region|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, an estimated 4,900 women aged 15 and up were living with HIV. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Laos}}
Laos is a source and, to a lesser extent, a transit and destination country for women and children subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Lao trafficking victims, especially from the southern region of the country, are often migrants seeking opportunities abroad who then experience sexual exploitation in destination countries, most often Thailand, as well as Vietnam, [[Malaysia]], China, [[Taiwan]], and [[Japan]]. Some migrate with the assistance of brokers charging fees, while others move independently through Laos’ 23 official border crossings using valid travel documents. Traffickers take advantage of this migration, and the steady movement of Lao population through the country’s 50 unofficial and infrequently-monitored border crossings, to facilitate the trafficking of Lao individuals in neighboring countries. Traffickers in rural communities often lure acquaintances and relatives with false promises of legitimate work opportunities in neighboring countries, then subject them to sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Laos 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282689.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=29 July 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of victims, particularly women and girls, are exploited in Thailand’s commercial sex industry. Some number of women and girls from Laos are sold as brides in China and subjected to sex trafficking. Some local officials reportedly contributed to trafficking vulnerabilities by accepting payments to facilitate the immigration of girls to China.&lt;ref name="state18" /&gt;

Laos is reportedly a transit country for some Vietnamese and Chinese women and girls who are subjected to sex trafficking in neighboring countries, particularly Thailand. Chinese women and girls are also subjected to sex trafficking within Laos.&lt;ref name="state18" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Laos as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 3]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18" /&gt;

== The Khmu and commercial sex ==
The [[Khmu]] are a minority [[ethnic group]] that reside mostly in isolated and mountainous areas in the Upper [[Mekong]] region of Laos. They are the second largest ethnic group after the lowland Lao and make up more than 10% of the 6.2 million population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Sa|first=Joia|last2=Bouttasing|first2=Namthipkesone|last3=Sampson|first3=Louise|last4=Perks|first4=Carol|last5=Osrin|first5=David|last6=Prost|first6=Audrey|date=2012-04-20|title=Identifying priorities to improve maternal and child nutrition among the Khmu ethnic group, Laos: a formative study|journal=Maternal &amp; Child Nutrition|language=en|volume=9|issue=4|pages=452–466|doi=10.1111/j.1740-8709.2012.00406.x|issn=1740-8695|pmc=3496764|pmid=22515273}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a significant number of Khmu women in northern Laos that are involved in the commercial [[sex industry]]. Many of these women voluntary leave their villages due to the very poor living conditions there. The Khmu women mostly move to border areas around the Upper Mekong where there is more infrastructure and recent development, including bars, restaurants and casinos. In addition, "Chinese sex workers at both casinos and local commercial sex venues increasingly host itinerant laborers and gamblers. Meanwhile, as a nod to promised development assistance, Chinese casino managers promote 'ethnic tourism' by supporting beauty contests in neighboring villages".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyttleton|first=Chris|last2=Vorabouth |first2=Sisouvanh|date=December 2011|title=Trade circles: aspirations and ethnicity in commercial sex in Laos|journal=Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality|volume=13|issue=sup2|pages=S263–S277|doi=10.1080/13691058.2011.562307|pmid=21442500|issn=1369-1058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and usage==

[[File:OrchhaSatiTemple.jpg|thumb|Orchha Sati Shrine]]

''Sati'' ([[Sanskrit]]: सती / ''{{IAST|satī}}'') is derived from the name of the goddess [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]], who self-immolated because she was unable to bear her father [[Daksha]]'s humiliation to her husband [[Shiva]].

The term ''sati'' was originally interpreted as "chaste woman". ''Sati'' appears in [[Hindi language|Hindi]] and [[Sanskrit]] texts, where it is synonymous with "good wife";&lt;ref name="Imperialism"&gt;{{cite book |title=Imperialism: Critical Concepts in Historical Studies |author = P. J. Cain, Mark Harrison |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |page = 209|isbn=9780415206303 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CkY3W7PZ-FkC}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term ''suttee'' was commonly used by [[Anglo-Indian]] English writers.&lt;ref name="doniger611"&gt;{{cite book|last=Doniger|first=Wendy|title=The Hindus: An Alternative History|year=2009|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=9780143116691|page=611}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sati'' designates therefore originally the woman, rather than the rite; the rite itself having technical names such as '''sahagamana''' ("going with") or '''sahamarana''' ("dying with"). '''Anvarohana''' ("ascension" to the pyre) is occasionally met, as well as '''satidaha''' as terms to designate the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinberger-Thomas|first=Catherine|pages=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3wPthVcxWGkC&amp;pg=PA21|title=Ashes of Immortality: Widow-Burning in India|publisher=University of Chicago Press,|location=Chicago|year=1999|isbn=9780226885681}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Satipratha''' is also, on occasion, used as a term signifying the custom of burning widows alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bharti|first=Dalbir|page=49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7U36KQVBVIgC&amp;pg=PA49|title=Women and the Law|publisher=APH Publishing|year=2008|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788131304426}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other terms related to ''sati'' are '''sativrata''' and '''satimata'''. ''Sativrata'', an uncommon and seldom used term,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harlan|first=Lindsey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7HLrPYOe38gC&amp;pg=PA119|title=Religion and Rajput Women: The Ethic of Protection in Contemporary Narratives|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520073395|page=119 footnote 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; denotes the woman who makes a vow, ''vrata'', to protect her husband while he is alive and then die with her husband. ''Satimata'' denotes a venerated widow who committed ''sati''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harlan|first=Lindsey|page=119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7HLrPYOe38gC&amp;pg=PA119|title=Religion and Rajput Women: The Ethic of Protection in Contemporary Narratives|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520073395|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian Commission of [[Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987]] Part I, Section 2(c) defines ''sati'' as the act or rite itself.&lt;ref name="NRCW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrcw.nic.in/shared/sublinkimages/13.htm|title=Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987 Official text of the Act|publisher=[[Government of India]]'s National Resource Centre for Women (NCRW)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025224737/http://nrcw.nic.in/shared/sublinkimages/13.htm|archivedate=25 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins and comparisons===

====Earliest records====
Few reliable records exist of the practice before the time of the [[Gupta empire]], approximately 400 CE although the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] historian  [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia]], who traveled to India with the expedition of [[Alexander the Great]], recorded that he had heard that among certain tribes widows were glad to burn along with their husbands, and that those who declined to die were disgraced.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 15.1.62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Legacy of Alexander: Politics, Warfare, and Propaganda under the Successors|pages= 177 |author = A. B. Bosworth|isbn = 9780199285150|publisher = Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Axel Michaels]], the first inscriptional evidence of the practice is from [[Nepal]] in 464 CE, and in India from 510 CE.&lt;ref name=axelmichaels&gt;{{cite book|last=Michaels|first=Axel|pages=149–153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PD-flQMc1ocC&amp;pg=PA149|title=Hinduism: Past and Present|year=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691089539}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early evidence suggests that widow-burning practice was seldom carried out in the general population.&lt;ref name=axelmichaels/&gt; Centuries later, instances of ''sati'' began to be marked by inscribed memorial stones called Sati stones. According to J.C. Harle, the medieval memorial stones appear in two forms – ''viragal'' (hero stone) and ''satigal'' (sati stone), each to memorialize something different. Both of these are found in many regions of India, but "rarely if ever earlier in date than the 8th or 9th century".&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Harle (1970), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25203206 An Early Indian Hero-Stone and a Possible Western Source], The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, No. 2 (1970), Cambridge University Press, pp. 159–164&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous memorial ''sati'' stones appear 11th-century onwards, states Michaels, and the largest collections are found in [[Rajasthan]].&lt;ref name=axelmichaels/&gt; Sati was also prevalent in the [[Chola Empire]] in [[South India]]. Vanavan Mahadevi, the mother of [[Rajaraja Chola I]] (10th century A.D) and Viramahadevi the queen of [[Rajendra Chola I]] (11th century A.D) both committed Sati upon their husband's death by ascending the pyre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in India: A Social and Cultural History [2 volumes]: A Social and Cultural History|author=Sita Anantha Raman|publisher=ABC-CLIO, 8 June 2009 – Social Science – 468 pages|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Woman, Her History and Her Struggle for Emancipation|author=B. S. Chandrababu, L. Thilagavathi|publisher=Bharathi Puthakalayam, 2009 – Feminism – 624 pages|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A description of ''sati'' appears in the Greek 1st-century BCE historian [[Diodorus Siculus]]'s account of the war fought in Iran between two of Alexander the Great's generals, [[Eumenes]] of Cardia and [[Antigonus Monophthalmus]]. In 317 BCE Eumenes's cosmopolitan army defeated that of Antigonus in the [[Battle of Paraitakene]]. Among the fallen was one Ceteus, the commander of Eumenes's Indian soldiers. Diodorus writes that Ceteus had been followed on campaign by his two wives, at his funeral the two wives competed for the honour of joining their husband on the pyre. After the older wife was found to be pregnant, Eumenes's generals ruled in favour of the younger. She was led to the pyre crowned in garlands to the hymns of her kinsfolk. The whole army then marched three times around the pyre before it was lit. According to Diodorus the practice of ''sati'' started because Indians married for love, unlike the Greeks who favoured marriages arranged by the parents. When inevitably many of these love marriages turned sour, the woman would often poison the husband and find a new lover. To end these murders, a law was therefore instituted that the widow should either join her husband in death or live in perpetual widowhood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'', 19.34.1-6&lt;/ref&gt; Modern historians believe Diodorus's source for this episode was the eyewitness account of the now lost historian [[Hieronymus of Cardia]]. Hieronymus' explanation of the origin of ''sati'' appears to be his own composite, created from a variety of Indian traditions and practices to form a moral lesson upholding traditional Greek values.&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth, pp. 174–187&lt;/ref&gt;


In the 1886 published [[Hobson-Jobson]], [[Henry Yule]] and [[Arthur Coke Burnell]] mention the practice of ''Suttee'' (sati) as an early custom of Russians near [[Volga]], tribes of [[Thracians]] in southeast Europe, and some tribes of Tonga and Fiji islands.&lt;ref name=yuleburnell/&gt; Yule and Burnell also compiled a few dozen excerpts of historical descriptions of ''sati'', the first being of Ceteus (or Keteus) mentioned above in 317 BC, and then a few before the 9th century AD, where the widow of a king had the choice to burn with him or abstain. Most of the compiled list on ''sati'', by Yule and Burnell, date from 1200 CE through the 1870s CE.&lt;ref name=yuleburnell&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yule|first1=Henry|last2=Burnell|first2=Arthur C.|pages=493–498|chapter=Suttee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-lFoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR1&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Hobson-Jobson: The Definitive Glossary of British India|location=Oxford|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199601134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indo-European practices====
{{Indo-European topics}}
The archaeologist [[Elena Efimovna Kuzmina]] enlists clear parallels between the burial practices of the ancient Asiatic steppe [[Andronovo culture]]s (fl. 1800–1400 BCE) and the [[Vedic Age]].&lt;ref&gt;See table 18 at {{cite book |author=[[Elena Efimovna Kuzmina]] |page=341 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x5J9rn8p2-IC&amp;pg=PA341 |title=The Origin of the Indo-Iranians |editor=J.P. Mallory |year=2007 |publisher=BRILL |location=Leyden |isbn=9789004160545}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Kuzmina's archaeological definition, ''sati'' is understood as a double burial, the co-cremation of a man and a woman/wife, a feature to be found in both cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Elena Efimovna Kuzmina]] |page=340 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x5J9rn8p2-IC&amp;pg=PA340 |title=The Origin of the Indo-Iranians |editor=J.P. Mallory |year=2007 |publisher=BRILL |location=Leyden |isbn=9789004160545}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuzmina states that in the Androvo culture and Vedic age, the practice was never strictly observed and was symbolic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Elena Efimovna Kuzmina]] |page=194 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x5J9rn8p2-IC&amp;pg=PA194 |title=The Origin of the Indo-Iranians |editor=J.P. Mallory |year=2007 |publisher=BRILL |location=Leyden |isbn=9789004160545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sacrifice of widow(s) or a great man's retainers at his death is attested in various Indo-European cultures outside of India. As an example where the widows vied for the honour to die with their common husband, the 5th-century BCE historian [[Herodotus]] mentions the [[Krestones]] tribe among the [[Thracians]]. The woman found to have been held highest in the husband's favour while he lived had her throat slit on his grave, the surviving wives reputedly regarding it as a great shame to have to live on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Herodotus |editor=Carolyn Dewald |translator=Robin Waterfield |year=2008 |page=305 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q7y3Suc6bKkC&amp;pg=PA305 |title=The Histories |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199535668}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing the ''Gothic Wars'' of [[Procopius]] (written circa 550 CE), [[Edward Gibbon]] notes that among the Germanic tribe of the [[Heruli]], a widow typically hanged herself upon her husband's tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Edward Gibbon]] |page=3218, footnote 4705 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LjcNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA16 |title=History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire: Complete Edition |publisher=Catholic Way Publishing |year=2014 |isbn=9781783790449 |quote=Among themselves ... the sick and the aged are put to death, at their own request, during a solemn festival; the widow ends her days by hanging herself upon the tree which shadows her husband's tomb.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cases of burning at funerals elsewhere, history and legends====
A well-known case is that of the 10th-century CE [[ship burial]] of the [[Rus' (people)|Rus']] described by [[Ibn Fadlan]]. Here, when a female slave had said she would be willing to die, her body was subsequently burned with her master on the pyre.&lt;ref&gt;However, in this ritual described by Ibn Fadlan, the slave girl is described as being stabbed to death prior to being burned. See page 19, at {{cite web|website=library.cornell.edu|title=Ibn Fadlan and the Rusiyyah|author=[http://www.ames.cam.ac.uk/general_info/biographies/islamic/Montgomery.htm James E. Montgomery]|url=http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/montgo1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such rituals as widow sacrifice/widow burning have, presumably, prehistoric roots. Early 20th-century pioneering anthropologist [[James G. Frazer]], for example, thought that the legendary Greek story of [[Capaneus]], whose wife Evadne threw herself on his funeral pyre, might be a relic of an earlier custom of live widow-burning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pausanias|last2=Frazer|first2=James G.|page=200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CetszVxoxAoC&amp;pg=PA200|title=Pausanias's Description of Greece|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012| location=Cambridge|isbn=9781108047258|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strangling of widows after their husbands' deaths are attested from as disparate cultures as the [[Natchez people]] in present-day US state [[Louisiana]], to a number of [[Pacific Islander]] cultures.&lt;ref&gt;''On Natchez, and on Anatom in present day [[Vanuatu]]'', {{cite book|last=Mackenzie|first=Donald A.|pages=158–159|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6chKHROa1icC&amp;pg=PA158|title=Myths of Pre-Columbian America|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1923|isbn=9780486293790}} ''Tahiti, Hawaii, Samoa'' {{cite book|last=Brantlinger|first=Patrick|pages=34–35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-IlVQXg5IUC&amp;pg=PA34|title=Taming Cannibals: Race and the Victorians|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780801462641}}, ''Fiji'' {{cite book|last1=Thornley|first1=Andrew|last2=Vualono|first2=Tauga|page=166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JTuavWoQW9oC&amp;pg=PA166|title=A Shaking of the Land: William Cross and the Origins of Christianity in Fiji |date=2005 |isbn=9789820203747 |publisher=University of the South Pacific |location=Suva, Fiji}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Sati''-like Hindu practice: Jauhar====
{{main article|Jauhar}}
The [[Rajput]] practice of [[Jauhar]], known from [[Rajasthan]] and [[Madhya Pradesh]], was the collective suicide of widows who preferred death rather than being captured alive and dishonored by victorious Muslim soldiers in a war.&lt;ref&gt;Arvind Sharma (1988), Sati: Historical and Phenomenological Essays, Motilal Banarsidass Publ, {{ISBN|9788120804647}}, page xi, 86&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bose, ''jauhar'' practice grew in the 14th and 15th century with Hindu-Muslim wars of northwest India, where the Hindu women preferred death than slavery or rape they faced if captured.&lt;ref&gt;Mandakranta Bose (2014), Faces of the Feminine in Ancient, Medieval, and Modern India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195352771}}, page 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maliseruthven/&gt; ''Sati''-style ''jauhar'' custom was observed only during Hindu-Muslim wars in medieval India, but not during internecine Hindu-Hindu wars among the Rajputs.&lt;ref&gt;Kaushik Roy (2012), Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia: From Antiquity to the Present, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-1107017368}}, pp. 182–184&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arvind Sharma]] states that there was a distinction between ''jauhar'' and ''sati'', because ''jauhar'' was principally motivated by a desire to avoid being captured by the invading Muslims, while ''sati'' was suicide of a devoted widow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharma|first=Arvind|page=xi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UJmWgz2mv5oC&amp;pg=PR11|title=Sati: Historical and Phenomenological Essays|year=1988|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ|location=Delhi|isbn= 9788120804647}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Hawley disagrees, and states there was a connection between ''jauhar'' and ''sati'' in terms of the insecurity and fears of the widow(s), and that these customs reinforced each other.&lt;ref name=maliseruthven&gt;Malise Ruthven (2007), Fundamentalism: A Very Short Introduction, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199212705}}, page 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Stratton Hawley (1994), Sati, the Blessing and the Curse, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195077742}}, pp. 165–166&lt;/ref&gt; Further [[Jauhar]] was a [[Tradition|custom]] for which special combustible rooms were built within the forts called [[Lakshagraha]] made of [[Lacquer]] and other inflammable substances.

====Practice within Sikhs, Jains and Muslims====
''Sati'' was observed within Sikh aristocracy. For example, when the founder of the [[Sikh Empire]] [[Ranjit Singh]] died in 1839, four of his proper wives and seven of his concubines committed themselves to ''sati''.&lt;ref name=anantsa/&gt; Two wives committed ''sati'' when Sikh King Kharak Singh died, and five women joined the funeral pyre of Maharaja Basant Singh.&lt;ref name=anantsa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Khushwant Singh]] (1962, Reprinted 2014), The Fall of the Kingdom of Punjab, Orient Longmans/Penguin, {{ISBN|978-0670087709}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Raja Suchet Singh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesikhencyclopedia.com/biographies/hindu-bhagats-and-poets-and-punjabi-officials/suchet-singh-raja|title=Suchet Singh, Raja – Hindu bhagats and poets, and Punjabi officials|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; died in 1844, 310 women committed ''sati''.&lt;ref name=anantsa&gt;{{cite book|last=Altekar|first=Anant S.|pages=131–132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYG4K0yYHQgC&amp;pg=PA131|title=The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization: From Prehistoric Times to the Present Day|year=1956|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Pub|location=Delhi|isbn=9788120803244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikh theology does not support the ''sati'' practice, however, as is evidenced by the criticism of the practice by the 3rd Sikh Guru [[Guru Amar Das]] (1479–1554).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Sharma|title=Sati: Historical and Phenomenological Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UJmWgz2mv5oC |year=1988|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0464-7|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient texts of Jainism, such as the [[Kalpa Sūtra]] the term ''Sati'' is found, and it means "virtuous woman".&lt;ref name=kelting184&gt;{{cite book|author=M Whitney Kelting |authorlink=Mary Whitney Kelting |editor=Peter Flügel|title=Studies in Jaina History and Culture: Disputes and Dialogues | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CIgqBgAAQBAJ |year=2006 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-23552-0|pages=184–186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many texts include a list of sixteen Satis, ancient women that represent auspiciousness and virtue, names revered in the mythology of Hinduism as well.&lt;ref name=kelting184/&gt; The connotation of the term ''Sati'', states M Whitney Kelting, means the same "virtuousness, chaste, dedication to her family" as in Hinduism, and in both cases, it is different from the associated practice called suttee during colonial British India.&lt;ref name=kelting184/&gt; Evidence suggests that there were instances of Sati practice (self immolation) by Jain women, including some in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M Whitney Kelting |authorlink=Mary Whitney Kelting |editor=Peter Flügel|title=Studies in Jaina History and Culture: Disputes and Dialogues | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CIgqBgAAQBAJ |year=2006 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-23552-0|page=184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Epigraphia Carnatica'', two of the 41 cases of ''sati'' in the time period 1400 to 1600 CE are those of Jain women.

In Bihar, the Muslim widows were stated to be carrying out a related practice. Buchanan Hamilton in his early 19th century ''Shahabad report'' wrote that Sati-like practice had spread to [[Mohammedan|Muhammadans]] because he had heard that a widow had herself buried in the coffin of her dead husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kumar|first=Raj|page=178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubRkhPM0ETMC&amp;pg=PA178|title=Essays on Indian Renaissance|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|year=2003|isbn=9788171416899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Models for the spread of sati===

====Altekar's chronology====
The earlier historian [[Anant Sadashiv Altekar]], in his (1938) ''The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization From Prehistoric Times to the Present Day'' held the position that the [[Vedic Age]] saw an active discontinuation of pre-historic burning of widows, on basis that a 1000 BCE funerary custom describes that of ''symbolic sati'', where the widow lies down by her deceased husband, but is then bidden to rise again, to enjoy the bliss of children and wealth remaining for her.&lt;ref name="Altekar 1956 118"&gt;{{cite book|last=Altekar|first=Anant S.|page=118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYG4K0yYHQgC&amp;pg=PA118|title=The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization: From Prehistoric Times to the Present Day|year=1956|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Pub|location=Delhi|isbn=9788120803244}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following, a brief sketch on the chronology on the spread of sati, as proposed by Altekar is given.

According to Altekar, there is no mention of actual ''sati'' in the period of Brahmana literature (c. 1500–700 BCE) and the later [[Kalpa (Vedanga)#Grhyasutras|Grhyusutras]], roughly composed 600–300 BCE on a number of rituals, but ''sati'' is not described or mentioned. In fact, what is written about funeral customs, is that the widow is brought back from the funeral pyre, typically by a trusted servant. Altekar thinks it significant that [[Gautama Buddha]], who castigated customs of ''animal'' sacrifice, and other customs where pain was inflicted, is entirely silent about burning women alive. Altekar takes these elements as proofs that burning widows alive had long ago died out as a practice. Nor do the authors of the [[Dharmasutras]] (c. 400 BCE–100 BCE) or [[Yajnavalkya]] (c. 100 CE–300 CE) say anything about it being commendable to burn a widow alive on her husband's funeral pyre. Although we have late fourth-century BCE evidence from Greek authors and the [[Mahabharata]] for the 'existence' of the custom of ''sati'', Altekar thinks it did not really begin to grow in popularity before 400 CE, by the manner of which it is infrequently mentioned in the [[Puranas]] of that time. A very early attested case from 510 CE is that of the wife of Goparaja, who immolated herself with her dead husband, according to the [[Eran|Eran inscription]] of king [[Bhanugupta]], with another similar case attested from 606 CE. As the custom grew in popularity, Altekar highlights as determined opponents of this aristocratic custom in particular 7th-century poet [[Bāṇabhaṭṭa]], but also 9th-century theologian [[Medhātithi]] and 12th-century Devana Bhatta. In Altekar's view, their crusades against the custom were largely unsuccessful.

According to Altekar, it is the period c. 700–1100 CE that sees ''sati'' becoming really widespread in India, in particular in [[Kashmir]]. As the centuries wore on, Altekar provides a few statistics on the spread of the custom. In [[Rajputana]], a later stronghold for ''sati'' there are two, possibly three reliably attested cases before 1000 CE. For the period from 1200 to 1600 CE, there are at least 20 such cases. For the [[Carnatic state|Carnatic]], we have about 11 inscriptions relative to ''sati'' from 1000 to 1400 CE; for 1400–1600 CE we have 41.

Thus, a main view that Altekar espoused is that the spread of ''sati'' increased over time (with local variations, for example reductions in territories governed by zealous rulers hostile to the practice), and probably was close to a maximum when the British began to intervene in the first decades of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;See Altekar's discussion, {{cite book|last=Altekar|first=Anant S.|pages=115–142|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYG4K0yYHQgC&amp;pg=PA115|title=The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization: From Prehistoric Times to the Present Day|year=1956|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Pub|location=Delhi|isbn=9788120803244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern causative models====
How, when, where and why the practice of ''sati'' spread are complex and much debated questions, without a consensus.&lt;ref name=anandyang&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yang |first1=Anand A. |editor-last=Sarkar |editor-first=Sumit |editor-last2=Sarkar |editor-first2=Tanika |pages=21–23 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GEPYbuzOwcQC&amp;pg=PA21 |chapter=Whose Sati?

According to Anand A. Yang, one model proposes, taking into account the association of ''sati'' with the warrior elite in particular, ''sati'' only became really widespread during the Muslim invasions of India, and the practice of ''sati'' now acquired an additional meaning as a means to preserve the honour of women whose men had been slain.&lt;ref name=anandyang/&gt; Sashi states, "the argument is that the practice came into effect during the Islamic invasion of India, to protect their honour from Muslims who were known to commit mass rape on the women of cities that they could capture successfully."&lt;ref name=ssshashi&gt;{{cite book|last=Sashi|first=S.S.|page=115|title=Encyclopaedia Indica: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh|volume=100|year=1996|publisher=Anmol Publications|isbn=9788170418597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Satigal (sati stone) in Kedareshvara temple at Balligavi.JPG|thumb|Satigal (sati stone) near [[Kedareshvara Temple, Balligavi]], [[Karnataka]]]]
However, this theory does not address the evidence of occasional incidences of ''sati'' in pre-Islamic times. The 510 CE inscription at [[Eran]] mentioning the wife of Goparaja, a vassal of [[Bhanugupta]], burning herself on her husband's pyre is considered to be a Sati stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OswUZtL1_CUC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=sati+stone+510+ad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2louc3IDfAhWLT30KHaAiCRIQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=sati%20stone%20510%20ad&amp;f=false |title=Vakataka – Gupta Age Circa 200–550 A.D.|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vidya Dehejia]] states that sati became regular only after 500 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=G3Q8DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=500+AD&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisv6uG44DfAhVUXCsKHVPzDJoQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|author= John Stratton Hawley (1994)|title=Sati, the Blessing and the Curse: The Burning of Wives in India |ISBN=978-0195077742| pages= 50}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that the practice originated among the [[Kshatriyas]] and remained mostly limited to the warrior class among Hindus.&lt;ref name=johnhawley&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=G3Q8DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=700+AD&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisv6uG44DfAhVUXCsKHVPzDJoQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|author= John Stratton Hawley (1994)|title=Sati, the Blessing and the Curse: The Burning of Wives in India |ISBN=978-0195077742| pages= 51–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yang adds that the practice was also emulated by those seeking to achieve high status of the royalty and the warriors.&lt;ref name=anandyang/&gt;

During the period of Muslim-Hindu conflict, [[Rajputs]] performed a distinct form of ''sati'' known as [[jauhar]] as a direct response to the onslaught they experienced.&lt;ref name=julialeslie&gt;On attested Rajput practice of sati during wars, see, for example {{cite book |last1=Leslie |first1=Julia |chapter=Suttee or Sati: Victim or Victor?|page=46|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vPdYkFguJ8IC&amp;pg=PA46 |title=Institutions and Ideologies: A SOAS South Asia Reader |year=1993 |editor-last=Arnold |editor-first=David |editor-last2=Robb |editor-first2=Peter |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=9780700702848 |volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Islamic invasions of South Asia have been recorded from the early 8th century CE such as with the raids of [[Muhammad bin Qasim]], and major wars of Islamic expansion after the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Wink (1996), Early Medieval India and the Expansion of Islam: 7th-11th Centuries, Brill Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|978-9004092495}}&lt;/ref&gt; This chronology has led to the theory that the increase in ''sati'' practice in India may be related to the centuries of Islamic invasion and its expansion in South Asia.&lt;ref name=anandyang/&gt;&lt;ref name=ssshashi/&gt;

Alternate theories for the spread of sati include it expanding from Kshatriya caste to others castes, not because of wars, but on its own, as part of "Sanskritization" and cultural phenomenon that conflated sati as a caste status symbol. This theory has been challenged because it does not explain the spread of sati from Kashatriyas to Brahmins, and Brahmins were not considered to be of inferior caste status than Kshatriyas.&lt;ref name=jshawley&gt;John Stratton Hawley (1994), Sati, the Blessing and the Curse, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195077742}}, pp. 162–167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leslie |first1=Julia |chapter=Suttee or Sati: Victim or Victor? |page=46 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vPdYkFguJ8IC&amp;pg=PA46 |title=Institutions and Ideologies: A SOAS South Asia Reader |year=1993 |editor-last=Arnold |editor-first=David |editor-last2=Robb |editor-first2=Peter |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=9780700702848 |volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory, by Hawley, is that sati started as a "nonreligious, ruling-class, patriarchal" ideology but later spread as a gilded status symbol of "valor", "honor" and "purity", representing strength and courage in internecine Rajput wars, and after Muslim invasions where Hindu women feared becoming the "booty for the captor" and committed jauhar and sati to avoid "rape, torture and other ignominies".&lt;ref name=jshawley/&gt;

The above theories do not explain how and why sati practice continued during the colonial era, particularly in significant numbers in colonial [[Bengal Presidency]] (modern Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Bangladesh and Assam).&lt;ref name=umanarayan/&gt; Three theories have been proposed: first that sati was believed to be supported by Hindu scriptures by the 19th century, second that sati was encouraged by unscrupulous neighbors because it was a means of property annexation from a widow who had the right to inherit her dead husband's property under Hindu law and sati helped eliminate the inheritor, and third theory being that [[Poverty in India#Poverty prevalence and estimates|poverty]] was so extreme during the 19th century that sati was a means of escape for a woman with no means or hope of survival.&lt;ref name=umanarayan&gt;Uma Narayan (1997), Dislocating Cultures: Identities, Traditions, and Third World Feminism, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415914192}}, pp. 59–65&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Grey states that the understanding of origins and spread of sati were distorted in the colonial era because of a concerted effort to push "problem Hindu" theories in the 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Grey (2013), Creating the ‘Problem Hindu’: Sati, Thuggee and Female Infanticide in India: 1800–60, Gender &amp; History, 25(3), pp. 498–510, {{doi|10.1111/1468-0424.12035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to  [[Annemarie Schimmel]], the Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] was averse to the practice of Sati; however, he expressed his admiration for "widows who wished to be cremated with their deceased husbands".&lt;ref name=annemarie113&gt;{{cite book|author=Annemarie Schimmel|editor=Burzine K.

The poet reports hearing the story from Prince Dāniyāl, Akbar's third son. According to Arvind Sharma, a professor of Comparative Religion specializing on Hinduism, the widow "rejected all this persuasion as well as the counsel of the Brahmans, and would neither speak nor hear of anything but the Fire".{{Sfn|Sharma|2001|p=25}}{{Refn|group=note|According to Arvind Sharma, a professor of Comparative Religion, "in most accounts of sati of the pre-17th century period, in which the role of the [[Brahmin|Brahamanas]] can be identified, they appear in the role of persons dissuading the widow from committing sati."{{Sfn|Sharma|2001|p=25}}}}

[[Jahangir]], who succeeded Akbar in the early 17th century, found ''sati'' prevalent among the Muslims of Rajaur (Kashmir).{{Sfn|Sharma|2001|p=23}}&lt;ref name=pirbhai108/&gt; They had been converted to Islam by Sultan Firoz. During this era, many Muslims and Hindus were ambivalent about the practice, with Muslim attitude leaning towards disapproval. According to Sharma, the evidence nevertheless suggests that ''sati'' was universally admired, and both "Hindus and Muslims went in large numbers to witness a sati".{{Sfn|Sharma|2001|p=23}} According to Reza Pirbhai, the memoirs of Jahangir suggest ''sati'' continued in his regime, was practiced by Hindus and Muslims, he was fascinated by the custom, and that those Kashmiri Muslim widows who practiced ''sati'' either immolated themselves or buried themselves alive with their dead husbands. Jahangir prohibited such sati and other customary practices in Kashmir.&lt;ref name=pirbhai108&gt;{{cite book|author=M.

[[Aurangzeb]] issued another order in 1663, states [[S. M. Ikram|Sheikh Muhammad Ikram]], after returning from Kashmir, "in all lands under Mughal control, never again should the officials allow a woman to be burnt".&lt;ref name=Columbia/&gt; The Aurangzeb order, states [[S. M. Ikram|Ikram]], though not mentioned in the formal histories, is recorded in the official records of Aurangzeb's time.&lt;ref name=Columbia/&gt; Although Aurangzeb's orders could be evaded with payment of bribes to officials, adds [[S. M. Ikram|Ikram]], later European travelers record that ''sati'' was not much practiced in Mughal empire, and that Sati was "very rare, except it be some Rajah's wives, that the Indian women burn at all" by the end of Aurangzeb's reign.&lt;ref name=Columbia/&gt;

The memoirs of European merchants and travelers, as well the colonial era Christian missionaries of British India described Sati practices under Mughal rulers.&lt;ref name=rajkumar173/&gt; The Spanish missionary Domingo Navarrete wrote in 1670 of different styles of Sati during Aurangzeb's time.&lt;ref name="Banerjee2016p82"&gt;{{cite book|author=P.

European travellers in the Mughal empire noted the practice, with Ralph Fitch noting in 1591:

While amongst the descriptions in [[François Bernier|François Bernier's]] Travels in the Mogul Empire, A.D. 1656–1668, he gives:
  At Lahor I saw a most beautiful young widow sacrificed, who could not, I think, have been more than twelve years of age. The poor little creature appeared more dead than alive when she approached the dreadful pit: the agony of her mind cannot be described; she trembled and wept bitterly; but three or four of the Brahmens, assisted by an old woman who held her under the arm, forced the unwilling victim toward the fatal spot, seated her on the wood, tied her hands and feet, lest she should run away, and in that situation the innocent creature was burnt alive.

Attempts to limit or ban the practice had been made by individual British officers in the 18th century, but without the backing of the [[British East India Company]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The first formal British ban was imposed in 1798, in the city of [[Calcutta]] only. The practice continued in surrounding regions. In the beginning of the 19th century, the evangelical church in Britain, and its members in India, started campaigns against ''sati''. Leaders of these campaigns included [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] and [[William Wilberforce]]. These movements put pressure on the company to ban the act. William Carey, and the other missionaries at [[Serampore]] conducted in 1803–04 a census on cases of ''sati'' for a region within a 30-mile radius of Calcutta, finding more than 300 such cases there.&lt;ref name=rajkumar173&gt;{{cite book|last=Kumar|first=Raj|page=173|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubRkhPM0ETMC&amp;pg=PA173|title=Essays on Indian Renaissance|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|year=2003|isbn=9788171416899}} Carey's actual figures for the year 1803 was 275; for the months April–October 1804, the missionaries arrived at the figure 115.

Serampore was a Danish colony, rather than British, and the reason why Carey started his mission in Danish India, rather than in British, was because The East India Company did not accept Christian missionary activity within their domains. In 1813, in a speech to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], William Wilberforce, with particular reference to the statistics on ''sati'' collected by Carey and the other Serampore missionaries, forced through a bill that made Christian missionary preaching in British India legal, to combat such perceived social evils as ''sati''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mangalwadi|first1=Vishal |editor-last=Stetson |editor-first=Chuck |pages=140–141 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T2IyKWOm1YgC&amp;pg=PA141 |chapter=India:Peril&amp;Promise |title=Creating the Better Hour: Lessons from William Wilberforce |publisher=Stroud &amp; Hall |year=2007 |location=Macon, GA |isbn=9780979646218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elijah Hoole]] in his book ''Personal Narrative of a Mission to the South of India, from 1820 to 1828'' reports an instance of Sati at Bangalore, which he did not personally witness.

The British authorities within the Bengal Presidency started systematically to collect figures on the practice in 1815.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

====Principal reformers and 1829 ban====
[[File:Plaque of Bipro Charan Chuokurbutty at Scottish Church College.jpg|thumb|Plaque of Last Legal Sati of Bengal, [[Scottish Church College]], [[Kolkata]]]]
The [[Bengal Sati Regulation, 1829|ban on ''Sati'']], effected by [[Lord William Bentinck]] in 1829, was largely due to the efforts of both [[Christian]] and [[Hindu]] reformers such as [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] and [[Ram Mohan Roy]]. In 1799 Carey, a [[Baptist]] [[Missionary#Christian missions|missionary]] from England, first witnessed the burning of a widow on her husband’s funeral pyre. Horrified by the practice, Carey and his coworkers [[Joshua Marshman]] and [[William Ward (missionary)|William Ward]] opposed ''sati'' from that point onward, lobbying for its abolishment. Known as the [[Serampore Trio]], they published essays forcefully condemning the practice&lt;ref name=sharma/&gt; and presented an address against Sati to then Governor General of India, [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Lord Wellesley]].&lt;ref name=marshman/&gt;
 
In 1812 [[Ram Mohan Roy|Raja Ram Mohan Roy]], founder of [[Brahmo Samaj]], began to champion the cause of banning ''sati'' practice. He was motivated by the experience of seeing his own sister-in-law being forced to commit ''sati''.&lt;ref name=hm&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaurasia|first=Radhey Shyam|title=History of Modern India, 1707 A.D. to 2000 A.D.|year=2002|page=118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MS_jrForJOoC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=RAM+MOHAN+ROY+SATI+PRACTICE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EXvoUt2SN4mIrgeP_4HoAQ&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=RAM%20MOHAN%20ROY%20SATI%20PRACTICE&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He visited Kolkata’s cremation grounds to persuade widows against immolation, formed watch groups to do the same, sought the support of other elite Bengali classes, and wrote and disseminated articles to show that it was not required by Hindu scripture.&lt;ref name=hm/&gt; He was at loggerheads with Hindu groups which did not want the Government to interfere in religious practices.&lt;ref name=dodwell/&gt;

From 1815–1818 ''Sati'' deaths doubled. Ram Mohan Roy launched an attack on ''Sati'' that “aroused such anger that for awhile his life was in danger”&lt;ref&gt;Sharma 2001, pp. 6, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1821 he published a tract opposing Sati, and in 1823 the Serampore missionaries led by Carey published a book containing their earlier essays, of which the first three chapters opposed Sati. Another Christian missionary published a tract against Sati in 1927.

[[Swaminarayan|Sahajanand Swami]], the founder of the [[Swaminarayan Hinduism|Swaminarayan sect]], preached against the practice of ''sati'' in his area of influence, that is [[Gujarat]]. He argued that the practice had no [[Vedas|Vedic]] standing and only God could take a life he had given. He also opined that widows could lead lives that would eventually lead to salvation. [[John Malcolm|Sir John Malcolm]], the [[List of Governors of Bombay|Governor of Bombay]] supported Sahajanand Swami in this endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' (2007) Constance A. Jones. Facts on File Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1828 [[Lord William Bentinck]] came to power as Governor of India. When he landed in Calcutta, he said that he felt ''“the dreadful responsibility hanging over his head in this world and the next, if… he was to consent to the continuance of this practice (sati) one moment longer.”''&lt;ref&gt;Marshman 1876 p. 757.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bentinck decided to put an immediate end to ''Sati''. Ram Mohan Roy warned Bentinck against abruptly ending ''Sati''.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma 2001, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after observing that the judges in the courts were unanimously in favor of it, Bentinck proceeded to lay the draft before his council.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell 1932 p.141.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Metcalfe, 1st Baron Metcalfe|Charles Metcalfe]], the Governor’s most prominent counselor expressed apprehension that the banning of ''Sati'' might be ''“used by the disaffected and designing”'' as ''“an engine to produce insurrection.”'' However these concerns didn’t deter him from upholding the Governor’s decision ''“in the suppression of the horrible custom by which so many lives are cruelly sacrificed.”''&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell 1932 p.142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus on Sunday morning of 4 December 1829 Lord Bentinck issued Regulation XVII declaring ''Sati'' to be illegal and punishable in criminal courts. It was presented to William Carey for translation. His response is recorded as follows: ''“Springing to his feet and throwing off his black coat he cried, 'No church for me to-day... If I delay an hour to translate and publish this, many a widow’s life may be sacrificed,' he said. By evening the task was finished.”''&lt;ref&gt;Sharma pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 February 1830 this law was extended to [[Madras Presidency|Madras]] and [[Bombay Presidency|Bombay]].&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite book|last=Rai|first=Raghunath|title=History |page=137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4-8Z0gqBkoC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=RAM+MOHAN+ROY+SATI+PRACTICE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EXvoUt2SN4mIrgeP_4HoAQ&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=RAM%20MOHAN%20ROY%20SATI%20PRACTICE&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was challenged by a petition signed by “several thousand… Hindoo inhabitants of Bihar, Bengal, Orissa etc”&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell 1932 p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; and the matter went to the [[Privy Council]] in London. Along with British supporters, Ram Mohan Roy presented counter-petitions to parliament in support of ending Sati. The Privy Council rejected the petition in 1832, and the ban on ''Sati'' was upheld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kulkarni|first1=A.R.|last2=Feldhaus|first2=Anne|page=192|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1YSU9Qp9w0MC&amp;pg=PA192|title=Images of Women in Maharashtrian Literature and Religion|chapter=Sati in the Maratha Country|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1996|location=Albany, NY|isbn=9780791428382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ban, priests in Sindh region complained that the British colonial government was interfering with the rare local ''sati'' custom. [[Charles James Napier|Charles Napier]] clarified in 1843 that anyone involved in this custom would be executed and their property confiscated. According to an account of his administration, there were no more ''sati'' thereafter, in the region Napier administered.&lt;ref name="quote"&gt;Napier, William.

The 1846 abolition in Jaipur was regarded by many British as a catalyst for the abolition cause within the [[Rajputana]]; within 4 months after Jaipur's 1846 ban, 11 of the 18 independently governed states in Rajputana had followed Jaipur's example.&lt;ref&gt;A much quoted table given at page 270 in {{cite journal|editor=William Gifford|year=1851|pages=257–276|last=Wilson|first=Horca H.|title=Widow Burning-Major Ludlow |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TzwMAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA270|journal=The Quarterly Review|volume=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; One paper says that in the year 1846–1847 alone, 23 states in the whole of India (not just within Rajputana) had banned ''sati''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bengal and Agra, Miscellaneous|journal=The Indian News and Chronicle of Eastern Affaires|page=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-3dNAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA76|date=22 February 1848|volume=132|publisher=Alexander E.

Some princely states, such as the major [[Salute state]] of [[Travancore State|Travancore]], were perceived not to ever have sanctioned ''sati'' within their domains. For example, the regent [[Gowri Parvati Bayi]] was asked by the [[Residencies of British India|British Resident]] if he should permit a ''sati'' to take place in 1818, but the regent urged him not to do so, since the custom of ''sati'' had never been acceptable in her domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=14 December 1839|volume=7, 198|page=383|publisher=James Burns|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e9HNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA383|title=Tinnevelly|journal=Church of England Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another state, Sawunt Waree ([[Sawantvadi]]), the king Khemsawant III (r. 1755–1803) is credited for having issued a positive ''prohibition'' of sati over a period of ten or twelve years.&lt;ref&gt;page 182 in {{cite journal|journal=The Oriental Herald|date=June 1824|volume=2,6|title=Burning of Hindoo Widows|pages=173–185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yo8eAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA182|publisher=J.

====Legislative status of sati in present-day India====
[[File:Burning of a Widow.jpg|thumb|''"Ceremony of Burning a Hindu Widow with the Body of her Late Husband"'', from ''Pictorial History of China and India'', 1851.]]

Following the outcry after the ''sati'' of [[Roop Kanwar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Rajalakshmi | first = T.K. | title = "Sati" and the verdict | journal = Frontline Magazine, [[The Hindu]] | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = | date=  28 February – 12 March 2004 | url = http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2105/stories/20040312002504600.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Indian Government enacted the Rajasthan Sati Prevention Ordinance, 1987 on 1 October 1987&lt;ref name="Trial by fire"&gt;[http://www.sabrang.com/cc/archive/2004/mar04/sreport3.html Trial by fire], ''Communalism Combat'', Special Report, February–March 2004, Volume 10, No.96, [[Sabrang Communications]].&lt;/ref&gt; and later passed the Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987.&lt;ref name="NRCW"/&gt;

The Commission of [[Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987]] Part I, Section 2(c) defines ''sati'' as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The burning or burying alive of&amp;nbsp;–
:(i) any widow along with the body of her deceased husband or any other relative or with any article, object or thing associated with the husband or such relative; or
:(ii) any woman along with the body of any of her relatives, irrespective of whether such burning or burying is claimed to be voluntary on the part of the widow or the women or otherwise&lt;ref name="NRCW"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Jodhpur Sati.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A shrine to wives of the [[Maharaja]]s of [[Jodhpur]] who have committed sati. The palmprints are typical.]]

The ''Prevention of Sati Act'' makes it illegal to support, glorify or attempt to commit sati. Support of sati, including coercing or forcing someone to commit sati, can be punished by [[Capital punishment|death sentence]] or [[life imprisonment]], while glorifying sati is punishable with one to seven years in prison.

There have been 30 cases of ''sati'' or attempted ''sati'' over a 44-year period (1943–1987) in India, the official number being 28.&lt;ref name=thomaswb182&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinberger-Thomas|first=Catherine|pages=182–185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3wPthVcxWGkC&amp;pg=PA182|title=Ashes of Immortality: Widow-Burning in India|publisher=University of Chicago Press,|location=Chicago|year=1999|isbn=9780226885681}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chnm.gmu.edu/wwh/lessons/lesson5/lesson5.php?s=3 Letter, Panduranga Joshi Kulkarni], [http://chnm.gmu.edu/wwh/index.html Women in World History] A project of the Center for History and New Media, [[George Mason University]].&lt;/ref&gt; A well-documented case from 1987 was that of 18-year-old [[Roop Kanwar]].&lt;ref name=thomaswb182/&gt;&lt;ref name="rediff2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2002/aug/07mp.htm |title=Magisterial inquiry ordered into 'sati' incident |publisher=rediff.com |date=7 August 2002 |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this incident, additional legislation against ''sati'' practice was passed, first within the state of Rajasthan, then nationwide by the central government of India.&lt;ref name="NRCW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trial by fire"/&gt;

In 2002, a 65-year-old woman by the name of Kuttu died after sitting on her husband's funeral pyre in the Indian Panna district.&lt;ref name="rediff2002"/&gt; On 18 May 2006, Vidyawati, a 35-year-old woman allegedly committed sati by jumping into the blazing funeral pyre of her husband in Rari-Bujurg Village, Fatehpur district in the State of Uttar Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times of India'', [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1538375.cms "Woman commits 'sati' in UP village"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101002080411/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1538375.cms |date=2 October 2010 }}, 19 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars debate whether these rare reports of ''sati'' suicide by widows are related to culture or are examples of mental illness and suicide such as those found among women worldwide.&lt;ref name=coluccilester225/&gt; In the case of Roop Kanwar, Dinesh Bhugra states that there is a possibility that the suicides could be triggered by "a state of depersonalization as a result of severe bereavement", then adds that it is unlikely that Kanwar had mental illness and culture likely played a role.&lt;ref&gt;D Bhugra and K Bhui (2007), Textbook of cultural psychiatry, Cambridge University Press, pages xvii-xviii&lt;/ref&gt; However, Colucci and Lester state that none of the women reported by media to have committed ''sati'' had been given a psychiatric evaluation before their ''sati'' suicide and thus there is no objective data to ascertain if culture or mental illness was the primary driver behind their suicide.&lt;ref name=coluccilester225&gt;Erminia Colucci and David Lester (2012), Suicide and Culture: Understanding the Context, Hogrefe, {{ISBN|978-0889374362}}, pp. 225–226&lt;/ref&gt; Inamdar, Oberfield and Darrell state that the women who commit ''sati'' are often "childless or old and face miserable impoverished lives" which combined with great stress from the loss of the only personal support may be the cause of a widow's suicide.&lt;ref&gt;SC Inamdar et al (1983), A suicide by self-immolation: psychological perspectives, International Journal of Social Psychiatry, Vol 29, pages 130–133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
Accounts describe numerous variants in the sati ritual. The majority of accounts describe the woman seated or lying down on the funeral pyre beside her dead husband. Many other accounts describe women walking or jumping into the flames after the fire had been lit,&lt;ref&gt;See Kamat for two examples&lt;/ref&gt; and some describe women seating themselves on the funeral pyre and then lighting it themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chnm.gmu.edu/wwh/lessons/lesson5/lesson5.php?s=1 Primary Sources: Letter, Francois Bernier] [http://chnm.gmu.edu/wwh/index.html ''Women in World History''], a project of the Center for History and New Media, George Mason University.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variations in procedure===
Although ''sati'' is typically thought of as consisting of the procedure in which the widow is placed, or enters, or jumps, upon the funeral pyre of her husband, slight variations in funeral practice have been reported here as well, by region. For example, the mid-17th-century traveler Tavernier claims that in some regions, the ''sati'' occurred by construction of a small hut, within which the widow and her husband were burnt, while in other regions, a pit was dug, in which the husband's corpse was placed along with flammable materials, into which the widow jumped after the fire had started.&lt;ref&gt;On hut, p.170, on pit, p.171 {{cite book|last1=Tavernier|first1=Jean Baptiste|url=https://archive.org/stream/sixvoyagesJohnB00Tave#page/170/mode/2up/|pages=170–171|year=1678|last2=P.|first2=J.

At Lombok, a high bamboo platform was erected in front of the fire and, when the flames were at their strongest, the widow climbed up the platform and dived into the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zollinger|first=M.|editor=James R.

===Live burials===
Hindus only bury the bodies of those under the age of two. Those older than two are customarily cremated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=PV Ayyar|title=Indian Customs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5hBvZY7SxeEC&amp;pg=PA155 |year=1992|publisher=Asian Educational Services |isbn=978-81-206-0153-6 |pages=155–156  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few European accounts provide rare descriptions of Indian ''sati'' that included the burial of the widow with her dead husband.&lt;ref name="asnic.utexas.edu"&gt;[http://asnic.utexas.edu/asnic/hardgrave/Satiart.rft.html The Representation of Sati: Four Eighteenth Century Etchings by Baltazard Solvyns] by Robert L.

(tr.)|chapter= 2.2.10|title=The six voyages of John Baptista Tavernier|publisher=R.L. and M.P.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th-century Flemish painter [[Frans Balthazar Solvyns]] provided the only known eyewitness account of an Indian sati involving a burial.&lt;ref name=solvynsrlh/&gt; Solvyns states that the custom included the woman shaving her head, music and the event was guarded by [[East India Company|East India Trading company]] officials. He expresses admiration for the Hindu woman, but also calls the custom barbaric.&lt;ref name=solvynsrlh&gt;[http://asnic.utexas.edu/asnic/hardgrave/Satiart.rft.html ''The Representation of Sati: Four Eighteenth Century Etchings by Baltazard Solvyns''], by Robert L. Hardgrave, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission of [[Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987]] Part I, Section 2(c) includes within its definition of ''sati'' not just the act of burning a widow alive, but also that of burying her alive.&lt;ref name="NRCW"/&gt;

===Compulsion===
''Sati'' is often described as voluntary, although in some cases it may have been forced. In one narrative account in 1785, the widow appears to have been drugged either with [[bhang]] or [[opium]] and was tied to the pyre which would have prevented her from escaping the fire, if she changed her mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://asnic.utexas.edu/asnic/hardgrave/Satiart.rft.html |title=The Representation of Sati: Four Eighteenth Century Etchings by Baltazard Solvyns |last=Hardgrave |first=Robert L. Jr}} The account uses the word "likely".&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hindu Suttee.jpg|thumb|right|"A Hindu Suttee", 1885 book]] 
The British local press of the time proffered several accounts of alleged forcing of the woman. As an example, ''[[The Calcutta Review]]'' published accounts as the following one:{{quote|In 1822, the Salt Agent at Barripore, 16 miles south of Calcutta, went out of his way to report a case which he had witnessed, in which the woman was forcibly held down by a great bamboo by two men, so as to preclude all chance of escape. In Cuttack, a woman dropt herself into a burning pit, and rose up again as if to escape, when a washerman gave her a push with a bamboo, which sent her back into the hottest part of the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| year= 1867| page=256 |title= Suttee| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qp4IAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA256|work=The Calcutta Review|volume=XLVI|publisher=R.C.LePage and Co.|location=Calcutta}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is said to be based on the set of official documents.&lt;ref&gt;Papers relative to East India Affairs, viz., Hindoo Widows and Voluntary Immolations. Ordered by the House of Commons to be printed. 1821–25, pp.221–261, ''ibidem''&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another such case appearing in official papers, transmitted into British journals, is case 41, page 411 here, where the woman was, apparently, thrown twice back in the fire by her relatives, in a case from 1821.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Oriental Herald|date=December 1827| volume= 15,48| title=Official Papers laid before Parliament Respecting the burning of Hondoo Widows| pages=399–424|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BPIaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA411| location= London| publisher=James S. Buckingham|editor-first=J.S. |editor-last=Buckingham}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Apart from accounts of direct compulsion, some evidence exists that precautions, at times, were taken so that the widow could not escape the flames once they were lit. Anant S. Altekar, for example, points out that it is much more difficult to escape a fiery pit you've jumped in, than descending from a pyre you have entered on. He mentions the custom of the fiery pit as particularly prevalent in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] and western India. From [[Gujarat]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]], where the widow typically was placed in a hut along with her husband, her leg was tied to one of the hut's pillars. Finally, from Bengal, where the tradition of the pyre held sway, the widow's feet could be tied to posts fixed to the ground, she was asked three times if she wished to ascend to heaven, before the flames were lit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Altekar|first=Anant S.| page= 134| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYG4K0yYHQgC&amp;pg=PA131|title=The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization: From Prehistoric Times to the Present Day| year= 1956| publisher= Motilal Banarsidass Pub|location=Delhi|isbn=9788120803244|postscript= (techniques for preventing escape)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Anant Sadashiv Altekar]] states that some historical records suggest without doubt that instances of sati were forced, but overall the evidence suggests most instances were a voluntary act on the woman's part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Altekar|first=Anant S.|pages=135–137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYG4K0yYHQgC&amp;pg=PA137|title=The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization: From Prehistoric Times to the Present Day|year=1956|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Pub|location=Delhi|isbn=9788120803244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolic sati===

====Funeral custom====
There have been accounts of symbolic ''sati'' in some [[Hindu]] communities. A widow lies down next to her dead husband, and certain parts of both the marriage ceremony and the funeral ceremonies are enacted, but without her death. An example in Sri Lanka is attested from modern times&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zinbun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~shakti/EnglishHP/suttee.html Defying blessings of the goddess and the community: Disputes over sati (widow burning) in contemporary India] by Masakazu Tanaka.  , section 6 in Tanaka's essay.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this form of symbolic sati has contemporary evidence, it should by no means be regarded as a modern invention. For example, the ancient and sacred [[Atharvaveda]], one of the four [[Veda]]s, believed to have been composed around 1000 BCE, describes a funerary ritual where the widow lies down by her deceased husband, but is then asked to descend, to enjoy the blessings from the children and wealth left to her.&lt;ref name="Altekar 1956 118"/&gt;

====Jivit tradition====
In 20th-century India, a tradition developed of venerating ''jivit'' (living satis). A ''jivit'' is a woman who once desired to commit sati, but lives after having sacrificed her desire to die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=538|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ienxrTPHzzwC&amp;pg=PA538|chapter=Sati|title=South Asian Folklore: An Encyclopedia : Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka|last1=Harlan|first1=Lindsey |editor-last=Claus |editor-first=Peter J. |editor-last2=Diamond |editor-first2=Sarah  |editor-last3=Mills |editor-first3=Margaret A. |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location=New York, London |year=2003 |isbn=9780415939195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two famous ''jivit'' were Bala Satimata, and Umca Satimata, both living until the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;On these two women, and a general in-depth treatment of ''jivit'' tradition, see {{cite book|last=Harlan|first=Lindsey|pages=171–181|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7HLrPYOe38gC&amp;pg=PA171|title=Religion and Rajput Women: The Ethic of Protection in Contemporary Narratives|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520073395|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==

Records of ''sati'' exist across the subcontinent. However, there seems to have been major differences historically, in different regions, and among communities. Furthermore, no reliable figures exist for the numbers who have died by ''sati'', in general.
[[File:Muhammad Qasim Bride.jpg|thumb|200px|The bride throws herself on her husband's funeral pyre. This miniature painting made in Iran originates from the period of the [[Safavid dynasty]], first half 17th century. (Attributed to the painter Muhammad Qasim.)]]

===Numbers===
An 1829 report by a Christian missionary organization includes among other things, statistics on sati. It begins with a declaration that "the object of all missions to the heathen is to substitute for these systems the Gospel of Christ", thereafter lists sati for each year over the period 1815–1824 which totals 5,369, followed by a statement that a total of 5,997 instances of women were burned or buried alive in the Bengal presidency over the 10-year period, i.e., average 600 per year. In the same report, it states that the Madras and Bombay presidencies totaled 635 instances of ''sati'' over the same ten-year period.&lt;ref name=missionaryherald130&gt;{{cite journal|pages=130–131|date=April 1829|volume=25,4|journal=The Missionary Herald|title=Burning of Widows in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GsMPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA130|publisher=American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions |location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1829 missionary report does not provide its sources and acknowledges that "no correct idea can be formed of the number of murders occasioned by suttees", then states some of the statistics is based on "conjectures".&lt;ref name=missionaryherald130/&gt; According to Yang, these "numbers are fraught with problems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yang|first1=Anand A. |editor-last=Sarkar |editor-first=Sumit  |editor-last2=Sarkar |editor-first2=Tanika |page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GEPYbuzOwcQC&amp;pg=PA23|chapter=Whose Sati?Widow-Burning in early Nineteenth Century India|title=Women and Social Reform in Modern India: A Reader|year=2008|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Indiana|isbn=9780253352699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lord William Bentinck|William Bentinck]], in an 1829 report, stated without specifying the year or period, that "of the 463 satis occurring in the whole of the [[Bengal Presidency|Presidency of Fort William]],{{refn|group=note|at its greatest extent in 19th-century, this Presidency included modern era states of Utar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, parts of Assam, Tripura in India and modern era Bangladesh}} 420 took place in Bengal, Behar, and Orissa, or what is termed the Lower Provinces, and of these latter 287 in the Calcutta Division alone". For the Upper Provinces, Bentinck added, "in these Provinces the satis amount to forty three only upon a population of nearly twenty millions", i.e., average one sati per 465,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1829bentinck.html Modern History Sourcebook: On Ritual Murder in India], 1829 by [[Lord William Bentinck|William Bentinck]] Within previously cited statistics from 1815–1824, the year ''1816'' had 442 reported incidents of ''sati'', the only figure in that statistics on the 400-level&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social composition and age distribution===
Anand Yang, speaking of the early nineteenth century CE, says that contrary to conventional wisdom, ''sati'' was not, in general, confined to being an upper class phenomenon, but spread through the classes/castes. In the 575 reported cases from 1823, for example, 41 percent were Brahmins, some 6 percent were Kshatriyas, whereas 2 percent were Vaishiyas, and 51 percent Sudras. In [[Banaras]], though, in the 1815–1828 British records, the upper castes were only for two years represented with less than 70% of the total; in 1821, all sati were from the upper castes there.

Yang notes that many studies seem to emphasize the young age of the widows who committed sati. However, by study of the British figures from 1815 to 1828, Yang states the overwhelming majority were ageing women: The statistics from 1825 to 1826 about two thirds were above the age of 40 when committing ''sati''.&lt;ref&gt;For these statistics and in-depth treatment, see {{cite book|last1=Yang|first1=Anand A. |editor-last=Sarkar |editor-first=Sumit  |editor-last2=Sarkar |editor-first2=Tanika |pages=29–31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GEPYbuzOwcQC&amp;pg=PA29|chapter=Whose Sati?

===Regional variations of incidence===

Anand Yang summarizes the regional variation in incidence of ''sati'' as follows:
{{quote|..the practice was never generalized..but was confined to certain areas: in the north,..the Gangetic Valley, [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and [[Rajasthan]]; in the west, to the southern [[Konkan]] region; and in the south, to [[Madurai]] and [[Vijayanagar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yang|first1=Anand A. |editor-last=Sarkar |editor-first=Sumit |editor-last2=Sarkar |editor-first2=Tanika |pages=22|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GEPYbuzOwcQC&amp;pg=PA22|chapter=Whose Sati?

====Konkan/Maharashtra====
Narayan H. Kulkarnee believes that ''sati'' became to be practiced in medieval days [[Maharashtra]] initially by the [[Maratha]] nobility claiming [[Rajput]] descent. Then, according to Kulkarnee, the practice of ''sati'' may have increased across caste distinctions as an honour saving custom in the face of Muslim advances into the territory. But, the practice never gained the type of prevalence as seen in Rajasthan or Bengal, and social customs of actively dissuading a widow from committing ''sati'' are well established. Apparently not a single instance of ''sati'' are attested for the 17th and 18th centuries CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kulkarnee|first1=Narayan H. |editor-last=Kusuman |editor-first=K.K |chapter=A Note on Sati in Maharashtra|pages=215–220|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4JqgSUSXDsC&amp;pg=PA215|title=A Panorama of Indian Culture: Professor A.

====Vijayanagara empire====
The ''sati'' stone evidence from the time of the empire is regarded as relatively rare; only about 50 are clearly identified as such. Thus, Carla M. Sinopoli, citing Verghese, says that despite the attention European travellers paid the phenomenon, it should be regarded as having been fairly uncommon during the time of the Vijayanagara empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sinopoli|first=Carla M.|pages=230–231|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J3nHg-eKWuIC&amp;pg=PA230|title=The Political Economy of Craft Production: Crafting Empire in South India, C.1350 – 1650|location=Cambridge|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139440745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Madurai====
Sangam literature (200 BCE) mentions the Sati of a Chola queen. The [[Madurai Nayak dynasty]], reigning 1529–1736 CE seems to have adopted the custom in larger measure; one Jesuit priest observing in 1609 Madurai the burning of 400 women at the death of Nayak Muttu Krishnappa.&lt;ref&gt;''On early rarity and Nayak adoption'', {{cite book|last1=Kulkarni|first1=K.R. |editor-last=Feldhaus |editor-first=Anne |chapter=Sati in Maratha Country |page=276 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1YSU9Qp9w0MC&amp;pg=PA176|title=Images of Women in Maharashtrian Literature and Religion|year=1996|publisher=SUNY Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=9780791428382}}, ''on Jesuit witness'', {{cite book|last=Weinberger-Thomas|first=Catherine|pages=119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3wPthVcxWGkC&amp;pg=PA119|title=Ashes of Immortality: Widow-Burning in India|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|year=1999|isbn=9780226885681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kongu Nadu====
[[Kongu Nadu]] region of Tamil Nadu has the highest number of Veera Maha Sati (வீரமாசதி) or Veeramathy temples (வீரமாத்தி) from all the native Kongu castes.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karikkuruvi.com/2014/12/blog-post.html?m=1&amp;grqid=Qf0uqMzz&amp;hl=en-IN|title=கொங்கதேசத்தில் வீரமாத்தி|website=www.karikkuruvi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kongu Nadu]] region of [[Tamil Nadu]] has the highest number of Veera Maha Satis (வீரமாசதி) or Veeramathys (வீரமாத்தி) in South India. [[Sangam literature]] talk about the Sati of a [[Chola]] queen.

====Princely State of Mysore====
Established in 1799, a few records exist from the [[Princely State of Mysore]] that say permission to commit ''sati'' could be granted. Dewan (prime minister) [[Purnaiah]] is said to have allowed it for a Brahmin widow in 1805,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinto|first=Janet|page=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O5MuPfDa468C&amp;pg=PA115|title=The Indian Widow: From Victim To Victor|year=2002|publisher=St Pauls BYB|location=Mumbai|isbn=9788171085330}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas an 1827 eye-witness to the burning of a widow in [[Bangalore]] in 1827 says it was rather uncommon there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor=Buckingham, James Silk|author=Eye-witness|title=Suttee at Bangalore|pages=281–285|volume=LVI|date=August 1828|journal=The Oriental Herald|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ohxUAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gangetic plain====
In the Upper Gangetic plain, while it occurred, there is no indication that it was especially widespread. The earliest known attempt by a government to stop the practice took place here, that of [[Muhammad Tughlaq]], in the [[Sultanate of Delhi]] in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;L. C.

In the Lower Gangetic plain, the practice may have reached a high level fairly late in history. According to available evidence and the existing reports of the occurrences of it, the greatest incidence of ''sati'' in any region and period, in total numbers, occurred in Bengal and Bihar in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/Organizations/healthnet/SAsia/forums/sati/prevention.html|title=The Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987 (No.3 of 1988) |publisher=[[Harvard School of Public Health]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nepal and Bali====
The earliest stone inscription in South Asia relating to ''sati'' has been found in [[Nepal]], dated to be from the 5th century, wherein the king successfully persuades his mother to not commit sati when his father died.&lt;ref&gt;John Whelpton (2005), A History of Nepal, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521804707}}, page 19&lt;/ref&gt; This inscription suggests that sati practice was known but not compelled.&lt;ref&gt;DR Regmi (1983), Inscriptions of Ancient Nepal, {{ISBN|978-0391025592}}, page 11&lt;/ref&gt; Nepal formally banned sati in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, Human Rights Violations in Nepal (1989), {{ISBN|978-0929692319}}, page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[Indonesia]]n island of [[Bali]], ''sati'' (known as ''masatya'') was practised by the aristocracy as late as 1903, until the Dutch colonial masters pushed for its termination, forcing the local Balinese princes to sign treaties containing the prohibition of sati as one of the clauses.&lt;ref name=merlecalvin&gt;''A History of Modern Indonesia since c. 1300'', by Merle Calvin Ricklefs, ''on forced treaties'', see {{cite book|last=Wiener|first=Margaret J.|pages=267–268|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GE1uc1UNXNYC&amp;pg=PA267|title=Visible and Invisible Realms: Power, Magic, and Colonial Conquest in Bali|year=1995|location=Chicago|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226885827}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Dutch observers of the particular Balinese custom in the 17th century said that only widows, themselves of royal blood, were to be burned alive. Concubines or others of inferior blood lines consenting to die with their princely husband could choose to be stabbed to death before burning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Creese|first=Helen|pages=240–241|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCUrhg_EibgC&amp;pg=PA240|title=Women of the Kakawin World: Marriage and Sexuality in the Indic Courts of Java and Bali|year=2005|publisher=M.E.

Lindsey Harlan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conncoll.edu/directories/faculty-profiles/lindsey-harlan/|title=Lindsey Harlan|website=Connecticut College}}&lt;/ref&gt; having conducted extensive field work among [[Rajput]] women, has constructed a model of how, and why, women having committed ''sati'' are still venerated today, and how the worshippers think about the process involved.&lt;ref&gt;This section is based on chapter 4, {{cite book|last=Harlan|first=Lindsey|pages=112–153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7HLrPYOe38gC&amp;pg=PA112|chapter=Satimata tradition: The Transformative process|title=Religion and Rajput Women: The Ethic of Protection in Contemporary Narratives|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520073395|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, a woman on the path to become a ''sati'' goes through three stages
* being ''pativrata'' during her husband's life,
* who, at his death, makes a solemn vow to burn by his side, gaining status as ''sativrata'' and
* finally, having endured being burnt alive, achieving the status of ''satimata''.

===Pativrata===
The dutiful wife, the ''pativrata'', is devoted and subservient to her husband, and also protective of him. If he dies before her, some culpability is attached to her for his death, as not having been sufficiently protective of him. Making the vow to burn alive beside him removes her own culpability, as well as within the afterlife, enables her to protect him from new dangers.

===Sativrata===
In Harlan's model, having made the holy vow to burn herself transforms the woman to a ''sativrata'', a transitional stage between the living and the dead, before ascending the funeral pyre. Once a woman committed herself to become ''sati'', popular belief thought her to become endowed with many supernatural powers. Lourens P. Van Den Bosch enumerates some of them. The ''sati'' would gain the powers of prophecy and clairvoyance, as well as the ability to bless women with sons, who had not borne sons before. The gifts from a ''sati'' were venerated as valuable relics, and in her journey to the pyre, people would seek to touch her garments to benefit from her powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Van Den Bosch |first=Lourens P. |page=184 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q7uHAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA184 |title=Between Poverty and the Pyre: Moments in the History of Widowhood |editor-last=Bremmer |editor-first=Jan  |editor-last2=Van Den Bosch |editor-first2=Lourens P. |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=9781134888832 |chapter=The Ultimate Journey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindsey Harlan probes deeper into the sativrata stage: As a transitional figure on her path to become a powerful family protector as ''satimata'', the sativrata dictates the terms, and obligations the family must fulfill in order for her to protect them once she has become satimata, by showing reverence to her by observing the conditions. These are generally called ''ok''. A typical example of an ''ok'' is to place a restriction on the type of colours used in the family members's clothing, or to forbid the use of some particular type of clothing.

What can be termed curses, ''shrap'' is also within the sativrata's power, understood to be a severe teaching to members of her family in how they have failed. One woman cursed her in-laws when they refused to bring neither a horse or a drummer to her pyre, saying that whenever in the future might have need of either (and many religious rituals requires such a presence), it would not be available to them. {{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Satimata===
After her death on the pyre, the woman is finally transformed into the shape of the ''satimata'', an spiritual embodiment of goodness, with her principal concern of being a family protector. Typically, the ''satimata'' occurs in the dreams of the family members, teaching for example, the women how to be good ''pativratas'', herself through her sacrifice having proved she was the perfect ''pativrata''. However, although the satimata's intentions are always for the good of the family, she is not averse to let, for example, children become sick, or the cows' udders wither, if she thinks this is an appropriate lesson to the living wife who had neglected her duties as ''pativrata''.

==In scriptures==
David Brick, in his 2010 review of ancient Indian literature, states&lt;ref name=davidbrick&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brick|first1=David|title=The Dharmasastric Debate on Widow Burning|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=April–June 2010|volume=130|issue=2|pages=203–223|jstor=23044515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There is no mention of ''sahagamana'' (sati) whatsoever in either Vedic literature or any of the early Dharmasutras or Dharmasastras. By "early Dharmasutras or Dharmasastras", I refer specifically to both the early Dharmasutras of Apastamba, Hiranyakesin, Gautama, Baudhayana and Vasistha, and the later Dharmasastras of Manu, Narada, and Yajnavalkya. – David Brick, Yale University&lt;ref name=davidbrick/&gt;}}

The earliest scholarly discussion of sati, whether it is right or wrong, is found in the Sanskrit literature dated to 10th- to 12th-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brick|first1=David|title=The Dharmasastric Debate on Widow Burning|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=April–June 2010|volume=130|issue=2|pages=206–211|jstor=23044515}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known commentary on sati by [[Medhatithi]] of Kashmir argues that sati is a form of suicide, which is prohibited by the Vedic tradition.&lt;ref name=davidbrick/&gt; [[Vijnanesvara]], of the 12th-century [[Chalukya]] court, and the 13th-century [[Madhvacharya]], argue that sati should not to be considered suicide, which was otherwise variously banned or discouraged in the scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharma|first=Arvind|page=102, footnote 206|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UJmWgz2mv5oC&amp;pg=PR11|title=Sati: Historical and Phenomenological Essays|year=1988|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ|location=Delhi|isbn= 9788120804647}}&lt;/ref&gt; They offer a combination of reasons, both in favor and against sati.&lt;ref name=davidbrickvij/&gt;

In the following, a historical chronology is given of the debate within Hinduism on the topic of ''sati''.

===The oldest Vedic texts===
The most ancient texts still revered among Hindus today are the [[Vedas]], where the ''Saṃhitās'' are the most ancient, four collections roughly dated in their composition to 1700–1100 BCE. In two of these collections, the [[Rigveda]] and the [[Atharvaveda]] there is material relevant to the discussion of ''sati''.

====In the Rig Veda====
Claims about the mention of sati in [[Rig Veda]] vary. There are differing interpretations of one of the passages which reads:

: इमा नारीरविधवाः सुपत्नीराञ्जनेन सर्पिषा संविशन्तु |
:अनश्रवो.अनमीवाः सुरत्ना आ रोहन्तु जनयोयोनिमग्रे || (RV 10.18.7)

This passage and especially the last of these words has been interpreted in different ways, as can be seen from various English translations:

:''May these women, who are not widows, who have good husbands, who are mothers, enter with unguents and clarified butter:''
:''without tears, without sorrow, let them first go up into the dwelling.''&lt;ref&gt;Horace Hayman Wilson: ''On the Supposed Vaidik Authority for the Burning of Hindu Widows, and on the Funeral Ceremonies of the Hindus ''. In: ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. 16 (1856), p. 202. [https://archive.org/details/jstor-25228678 Digital Version].&lt;/ref&gt; (Wilson, 1856)

:''Let these women, whose husbands are worthy and are living, enter the house with [[ghee]] (applied) as [[collyrium]] (to their eyes).''
:''Let these wives first step into the pyre, tearless without any affliction and well adorned.''&lt;ref name="kane"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027153622/http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Agora/4229/in3.htm  3.1 Women in Indo-Aryan Societies:Sati] this translation is ascribed to Kane, pp. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt; (Kane, 1941)

Verse 7 itself, unlike verse 8, does not mention widowhood, but the meaning of the syllables ''[[yoni]]'' (literally "seat, abode") have been rendered as "go up into the ''dwelling''" (by [[Horace Hayman Wilson|Wilson]]), as "step into the ''pyre''" (by [[Pandurang Vaman Kane|Kane]]), as "mount the ''womb''" (by [[Stephanie W. Jamison|Jamison]]/Brereton)&lt;ref&gt;Compare alternative translation by Jamison/Brereton:
:''These women here, non-widows with good husbands – let them, with fresh butter as ointment, approach together.''
:''Without tears, without afflictions, well-jeweled, let the wives first mount the womb.''
[[Stephanie W. Jamison]], Joel P. Brereton: The Rigveda: 3-Volume Set. Oxford University Press, 2014. {{ISBN|9780199720781}}. p. 1401. [https://books.google.de/books?id=fgzVAwAAQBAJ digital format]&lt;/ref&gt; and as "go up to ''where he lieth''" (by [[Ralph T. H. Griffith|Griffith]])&lt;ref&gt;Compare also alternative translation by Griffith:
:''Let these unwidowed dames with noble husbands adorn themselves with fragrant balm and unguent.''
:''Decked with fair jewels, tearless, free from sorrow, first let the dames go up to where he lieth.''
[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv10018.htm Hymn XVIII. Various Deities.], ''Rig Veda'', tr. by [[Ralph T. H. Griffith]] (1896)&lt;/ref&gt;. A reason given for the discrepancy in translation and interpretation of verse 10.18.7, is that one consonant in a word that meant house, ''yonim agree'' ("foremost to the ''yoni''"), was deliberately changed by those who wished claim scriptural justification, to a word that meant fire, ''yomiagne''.&lt;ref&gt;O. P. Gupta, "The Rigveda: Widows don't have to burn", ''[[The Asian Age]]'', 23 October 2002, available at [http://www.hindu-religion.net/showflat/cat/hinduism/67586/0/collapsed/5/o/1 Hindu-religion.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222092234/http://www.hindu-religion.net/showflat/cat/hinduism/67586/0/collapsed/5/o/1 |date=22 February 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the following verse, which is unambiguously about widows, contradicts any suggestion of the woman's death; it explicitly states that the widow should return to her house.

:उदीर्ष्व नार्यभि जीवलोकं गतासुमेतमुप शेष एहि |
:हस्तग्राभस्य दिधिषोस्तवेदं पत्युर्जनित्वमभि सम्बभूथ || (RV 10.18.8)

:''Rise, come unto the world of life, O woman&amp;nbsp;— come, he is lifeless by whose side thou liest. Wifehood with this thy husband was thy portion, who took thy hand and wooed thee as a lover.''

Dehejia states that Vedic literature has no mention of any practice resembling Sati.&lt;ref name=dehejiaoup/&gt; There is only one mention in the Vedas, of a widow lying down beside her dead husband who is asked to leave the grieving and return to the living, then prayer is offered for a happy life for her with children and wealth. Dehejia writes that this passage does not imply a pre-existing sati custom, nor of widow remarriage, nor that it is authentic verse because its solitary mention may also be explained as a later date insertion into the text.&lt;ref name=dehejiaoup&gt;V Dehejia (1994), Editor: John Stratton Hawley, {{cite book|title=Sati, the Blessing and the Curse|pages=50–51|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On this idea of discontuation, see {{cite book|last=Altekar|first=Anant S.|pages=118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYG4K0yYHQgC&amp;pg=PA118|title=The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization: From Prehistoric Times to the Present Day|year=1956|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Pub|location=Delhi|isbn=9788120803244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dehejia writes that no ancient or early medieval era Buddhist texts mention sati, and if the practice existed it would likely have been condemned by these texts.&lt;ref name=dehejiaoup/&gt;

===1st-millennium BCE texts===

====Religious texts====
David Brick, a professor of South Asia Studies, states that neither ''sati'' nor equivalent terms such as ''sahagamana'' are ever mentioned in any Vedic literature (Samhitas, Brahmanas, Aranyakas, Upanishads), or in any of the early Dharmasutras or Dharmasastras.&lt;ref name=davidbrick/&gt;

The [[Brahmana]] literature, one of the layers within the ancient Vedic texts, dated about 1000 BCE – 500 BCE are entirely silent about ''sati'' according to the historian Altekar. Similarly, the [[Kalpa (Vedanga)#Grhyasutras|Grhyasutras]], a body of text devoted to ritual, with composition date about the time of the youngest within Brahmana literature, ''sati'' is not mentioned, either. What is mentioned concerning funeral rites, though, is that the widow is to be brought back from her husband's funeral pyre, either by his brother, or by a trusted servant. In the [[Taittiriya Aranyaka]] from about the same time, it is said that when leaving, the widow took from her husband's side such objects as his bow, gold and jewels (which previously would have been burnt with him), and a hope expressed that the widow and her relatives would lead a happy and prosperous life afterwards. According to Altekar, it is "clear" that the custom of actual widow burning had died out a long time previously at this stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Altekar|first=Anant S.|pages=118–119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYG4K0yYHQgC&amp;pg=PA118|title=The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization: From Prehistoric Times to the Present Day|year=1956|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Pub|location=Delhi|isbn=9788120803244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nor is the practice of ''sati'' mentioned anywhere in the [[Dharmaśāstra#The Dharmasutras|Dharmasutras]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Altekar|first=Anant S.|page=119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYG4K0yYHQgC&amp;pg=PA119|title=The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization: From Prehistoric Times to the Present Day|year=1956|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Pub|location=Delhi|isbn=9788120803244}}&lt;/ref&gt; texts tentatively dated by [[Pandurang Vaman Kane]] to 600–100 BCE, while [[Patrick Olivelle]] thinks the bounds should be roughly 250–100 BCE instead.&lt;ref&gt;For extended dating debate, including Kane reference, see {{cite book|last=Olivelle|first=Patrick|pages=xxv-xxxiv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d0YTQ9Ty8r4C&amp;pg=PR25|title=The Dharmasutras: The Law Codes of Ancient India|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780191606045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only is sati not mentioned in Brahmana and Dharmasastra literature, [[Satapatha Brahmana]] explains that suicide by anyone is inappropriate (adharmic). This [[Śruti]] prohibition became one of the several basis for arguments presented against sati by 11th- to 14th-century Hindu scholars such as Medhatithi of Kashmir,&lt;ref name=davidbrick/&gt;

:''Therefore, one should not depart before one's natural lifespan.'' – Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 10.2.6.7&lt;ref name=davidbrick/&gt;

Thus, in none of the principal religious texts believed composed before the Common Era is there any evidence at all for a sanctioning of the practice of ''sati''. It is wholly unmentioned, although the archaic Atharvaveda do contain hints of a funeral practice of ''symbolic'' sati. In addition, the twelfth-century CE commentary of Apararka, claiming to quote the Dharmasutra text [[Apastamba]], it says that the Apastamba prescribes that if a widow has made a vow of burning herself (anvahorana, "ascend the pyre"), but then ''retracts'' her vow, she must expiate her sin by the penance ritual called ''Prajapatya-vrata''&lt;ref&gt;''On 12th-century Apararka date'', see for example, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Urakx-uhGFkC&amp;pg=PA75 page 75], ''On penance'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=Urakx-uhGFkC&amp;pg=PA207 page 207], in {{cite book|last=Banerji|first=Sures C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Urakx-uhGFkC|year=1999|title=A Brief History of Dharmaśāstra|publisher=Abhinav Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788170173700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Valmiki Ramayana====
The oldest portion of the epic [[Ramayana]], the Valmiki Ramayana, is tentatively dated for its composition by Robert P. Goldman to 750–500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;See in particular his discussion on the preceding pages of conclusion given at {{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Robert P|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DWX43jnbOngC&amp;pg=PA23|page=23|title=Balakanda: An Epic of Ancient India|year=1990|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691014852|location=Princeton, New Jersey}} An important strand in Goldman's argument for the dating concerns which cities are considered capitals, and which are not&lt;/ref&gt; Anant S. Altekar says that no instances of ''sati'' occur in this earliest, archaic part of the whole Ramayana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Altekar|first=Anant S.|page=121|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYG4K0yYHQgC&amp;pg=PA121|title=The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization: From Prehistoric Times to the Present Day|year=1956|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Pub|location=Delhi|isbn=9788120803244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ramashraya Sharma, there is no conclusive evidence of the sati practice in the [[Ramayana]]. For instance, [[Tara (Ramayana)|Tara]], [[Mandodari]] and the widows of [[Ravana]], all live after their respective husband's deaths, though all of them announce their wish to die, while lamenting for their husbands. The first two remarry their brother-in-law. The only instance of sati appears in the ''Uttara Kanda'' – believed to be a later addition to the original text – in which [[Kushadhwaja]]'s wife performs sati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharma|first=Ramashraya |title=A socio-political study of the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa|edition=1|year=1971|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ|pages=96–8}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Telugu adaptation of the Ramayana, the 14th-century Ranganatha Ramayana, tells that [[Sulochana (Ramayana)|Sulochana]], wife of [[Indrajit]], became sati on his funeral pyre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Indian epic values: Rāmāyana and its impact  |last=Pollet|first=Gilbert  |authorlink= |year=1995|publisher=Peeters Publishers|location= |isbn=90-6831-701-6|page= 62|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EVnK3q48dL0C&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=Sulochana&amp;q=Sulochana |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mahabharata====
Instances of ''sati'' are found in the Mahabharata.

[[Madri]], the second wife of [[Pandu]], immolates herself. She believes she is responsible for his death, as he had been cursed with death if he ever had intercourse. He died while performing the forbidden act with Madri; she blamed herself for not rejecting him, as she knew of the curse. Also, in the case of Madri the entire assembly of sages sought to dissuade her from the act, and no religious merit is attached to the fate she chooses against all advice. In the Musala-parvan of the Mahabharata, the four wives of [[Vasudeva]] are said to commit ''sati''. Furthermore, as news of Krishna's death reaches [[Hastinapur]], five of his wives choose to burn themselves.

Against these stray examples within the Mahabharata of ''sati'', there are scores of instances in the same epic of widows who do not commit sati, none of them blamed for not doing so.&lt;ref&gt;For this discussion, see for example, {{cite book|last=Sagar|first=Krishna C.|page=291 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0UA4rkm9MgkC&amp;pg=PA291|title=Foreign Influence on Ancient India|year=1992|publisher=	Northern Book Centre|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788172110284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principal Smrtis, c. 200 BCE – 1200 CE===
The four works, [[Laws of Manu|{{IAST|Manusmṛti}}]] (200 BCE–200 CE), {{IAST|[[Yājñavalkya Smṛti]]}} (200–500 CE), {{IAST|[[Nāradasmṛti]]}} (100 BCE–400 CE) and the {{IAST|[[Viṣṇusmṛti]]}} (700–1000 CE) are the principal [[Smrti]] works in the [[Dharmaśāstra]] tradition, along with the Parasara Smrti, composed in the latter period, rather than in the earlier.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

====Earliest phase, c. 200 BCE – 700 CE====
The first three principal smrtis, those of Manu, Yājñavalkya and Nārada, do not contain any mention of sati.&lt;ref name=davidbrick/&gt;

====Emergence of debate on sati, 700 CE – 1200 CE====

=====Later smritis and sati=====
Justifications for the practice are given in the ''[[Vishnu Smriti]]'' (dated from 700 to 1000CE):
:''When a woman's husband has died, she should either practice ascetic celibacy or ascend (the funeral pyre) after him.'' — Vishnu Smriti, 25.14&lt;ref name=davidbrick/&gt;

In contrast, [[Moriz Winternitz]] states that Brihaspati Smriti prohibits burning of widows.&lt;ref name=winternitz&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winternitz|first1=M|title=History of Indian Literature, Vol. 3|date=2008|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-8120800564|page=598|quote=Quote: The Brihaspati-Smriti is in fact a kind of Varttika on the Manava-Dharmasastra. It prohibits burning of widows.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brihaspati Smriti was authored after the three principal smritis of Manu, Yājñavalkya and Nārada.&lt;ref name=winternitz/&gt;

Passages of the Parasara Smriti say:
:''If a woman adheres to a vow of ascetic celibacy ([[brahmacarya]]) after her husband has died, then when she dies, she obtains heaven, just like those who were celibate. Further, three and a half krores or however many hairs are on a human body – for that long a time (in years) a woman who follows her husband (in death) shall dwell in heaven.'' — Parasara Smriti, 4.29–31&lt;ref name=Brick&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brick|first=David|title=The Dharmaśāstric Debate on Widow-Burning|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=April–June 2010|volume=130|issue=2|pages=203–223|jstor=23044515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither of these suggest sati as mandatory, but Parasara Smriti elaborates the benefits of sati in greater detail.&lt;ref name=Brick/&gt;

=====Liberation versus ascension to heaven=====
Within the dharmashastric tradition espousing ''sati'' as a justified, and even recommended, option to ascetic widowhood, there remained a curious conception worth noting the achieved status for a woman committing ''sati''. Burning herself on the pyre would give her, and her husband, automatic, but not eternal, reception into heaven ([[svarga]]), whereas only the wholly chaste widow living out her natural life span could hope for final liberation ([[moksha]]) and breaking the cycle of rebirth. Thus, acknowledging that performing ''sati'' only achieved an inferior otherworldy status than successful widowhood could achieve, ''sati'' became recommended when coupled with a dismissal of the effective possibility for a widow to remain truly chaste.

=====Rules on Brahmin widows=====
While some smriti passages allow sati as optional, others forbid the practice entirely. [[Vijñāneśvara]] (c. 1076–1127), an early Dharmaśāstric scholar, claims that many smriti call for the prohibition of sati among Brahmin widows, but not among other social castes. Vijñāneśvara, quoting scriptures from Paithinasi and Angiras to support his argument, states:

''"Due to Vedic injunction, a [[Brahmin]] woman should not follow her husband in death, but for the other social classes, tradition holds this to be the supreme Law of Women... when a woman of Brahmin caste follows her husband in death, by killing herself she leaders neither herself nor her husband to heaven."''&lt;ref name=Brick /&gt;

However, as proof of the contradictory opinion of the smriti on sati, in his [[Mitākṣarā]], Vijñāneśvara argues Brahmin women are technically only forbidden from performing sati on pyres other than those of their deceased husbands.&lt;ref name=Brick /&gt; Quoting the Yājñavalkya Smṛti, Vijñāneśvara states, "a Brahmin woman ought not to depart by ascending a separate pyre." David Brick states that the Brahmin sati commentary suggests that the practice may have originated in the warrior and ruling class of medieval Indian society.&lt;ref name=Brick /&gt; In addition to providing arguments in support of sati, Vijñāneśvara offers arguments against the ritual.

Those who supported the ritual, did however, put restrictions on sati. It was considered wrong for women who had young children to care for, those who were pregnant or menstruating. A woman who had doubts or did not wish to commit sati at the last moment, could be removed from the pyre by a man, usually a brother of the deceased or someone from her husband's side of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brick|first=David|title=The Dharmasatric debate on widow-burning|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=1 April 2010|volume=130|issue=2|pages=203–223|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.authenticate.library.duq.edu/ehost/detail?vid=6&amp;sid=0aa819e5-2ae2-4093-b435-17e8c6b41941%40sessionmgr4004&amp;hid=4201&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=rfh&amp;AN=ATLA0001832088|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Evolution over time=====
David Brick,&lt;ref name=davidbrick/&gt; summarizing the historical evolution of scholarly debate on sati in medieval India, states:
{{quote|To summarize, one can loosely arrange Dharmasastic writings on sahagamana into three historical periods. In the first of these, which roughly corresponds to the second half of the 1st millennium CE, smrti texts that prescribe sahagamana begin to appear. However, during approximately this same period, other Brahmanical authors also compose a number of smrtis that proscribe this practice specifically in the case of Brahmin widows. Moreover, Medhatithi &amp;ndash; our earliest commentator to address the issue &amp;ndash; strongly opposes the practice for all women. Taken together, this textual evidence suggests that sahagamana was still quite controversial at this time. In the following period, opposition to this custom starts to weaken, as none of the later commentators fully endorses Medhatithi's position on sahagamana. Indeed, after Vijnanesvara in the early twelfth century, the strongest position taken against sahagamana appears to be that it is an inferior option to brahmacarya (ascetic celibacy), since its result is only heaven rather than [[moksa]] (liberation). Finally, in the third period, several commentators refute even this attenuated objection to sahagamana, for they cite a previously unquoted smrti passage that specifically lists liberation as a result of the rite's performance. They thereby claim that sahagamana is at least as beneficial an option for widows as brahmacarya and perhaps even more so, given the special praise it sometimes receives. These authors, however, consistently stop short of making it an obligatory act. Hence, the commentarial literature of the dharma tradition attests to a gradual shift from strict prohibition to complete endorsement in its attitude toward sahagamana.&lt;ref name=davidbrick/&gt;}}

===Legend of goddess Sati===
Although the myth of the goddess [[Dakshayani|Sati]] is that of a wife who dies by her own volition on a fire, this is not a case of the practice of ''sati''. The goddess was not widowed, and the myth is quite unconnected with the justifications for the practice.

===Justifications for involuntary sati===
Julia Leslie points to an 18th-century CE text on the duties of the wife by Tryambakayajvan that contains statements she regards as evidence for a sub-tradition of justifying strongly encouraged, pressured, or even forced ''sati''. Although the standard view of the sati within the justifying tradition is that of the woman who out of moral heroism chooses sati, rather than choosing to enter ascetic widowhood,&lt;ref&gt;and thus, critically, ''sati'' regarded as an essentially voluntary act, the woman afterwards worthy of worship&lt;/ref&gt; Tryambaka is quite clear upon the automatic good effect of sati for the woman who was a 'bad' wife:{{quote|Women who, due to their wicked minds, have always despised their husbands ... whether they do this (i.e., sati), of their own free will, or out of anger, or even out of fear – all of them are purified from sin.&lt;ref&gt;For direct quotation, see p.56, for rest of discussion, consult essay {{cite book |last1=Leslie |first1=Julia |chapter=Suttee or Sati: Victim or Victor? |pages=45–63 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vPdYkFguJ8IC&amp;pg=PA45 |title=Institutions and Ideologies: A SOAS South Asia Reader |year=1993 |editor-last=Arnold |editor-first=David |editor-last2=Robb |editor-first2=Peter |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=9780700702848 |volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Thus, as Leslie puts it, becoming (or being pressured into the role of) a ''sati'' was, within ''Tryambaka''{{'s}} thinking, the only truly effective method of atonement for the bad wife.

===Exegesis scholarship against sati===
Opposition to sati was expressed by several exegesis scholars such as the ninth- or tenth-century Kashmir scholar Medatithi – who offers the earliest known explicit discussion of sati,&lt;ref name=davidbrick/&gt; the 12th- to 17th-century scholars Vijnanesvara, Apararka and Devanadhatta, as well as the mystical Tantric tradition, with its valorization of the feminine principle.

====Medhatithi====
Explicit criticisms were published by [[Medhatithi]], a commentator on various theological works.&lt;ref name=davidbrick208&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brick|first1=David|title=The Dharmasastric Debate on Widow Burning|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=April–June 2010|volume=130|issue=2|pages=208|jstor=23044515}}&lt;/ref&gt; He offered two arguments for his opposition. He considered sati a form of suicide, which was [[Religious views of suicide#Hinduism|forbidden by the Vedas]]:
:''One shall not die before the span of one's life is run out''.&lt;ref name=davidbrick208/&gt;

Medhatithi offered a second reason against sati, calling it against [[dharma]] (''adharma''). He argued that there is a general prohibition against violence of any form against living beings in the Vedic dharma tradition, sati causes death which is sufficient proof of violence, and thus sati is against Vedic teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brick|first1=David|title=The Dharmasastric Debate on Widow Burning|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=April–June 2010|volume=130|issue=2|pages=207–208|jstor=23044515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vijnanesvara====
Vijnanesvara presents both sides of the argument, for and against sati. He argues first that Vedas do not prohibit sacrifice aimed to stop an enemy and in pursuit of heaven, and sati for these reasons is thus not prohibited. He then presents two arguments against sati, calling it "unobjectionable".&lt;ref name=davidbrickvij/&gt; The first is based on hymn 10.2.6.7 of Satapatha Brahmana will forbids suicide. His second reason against sati is an appeal to relative merit between two choices. Death may grant a woman's wish to enter heaven with her dead husband, but living offers her the possibility of reaching [[moksha]] through knowledge of the Self through learning, reflecting and meditating. In Vedic tradition, moksha is of higher merit than heaven, because moksha leads to eternal, unsurpassed bliss while heaven is impermanent and smaller happiness. Living gives her an option to discover deeper, fulfilling happiness than dying through sati does, according to Vijnanesvara.&lt;ref name=davidbrickvij&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brick|first1=David|title=The Dharmasastric Debate on Widow Burning|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=April–June 2010|volume=130|issue=2|pages=212–213|jstor=23044515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apararka====
Apararka acknowledges that Vedic scripture prohibits violence against living beings and "one should not kill"; however, he argues that this rule prohibits violence against another person, but does not prohibit killing oneself if one wants to. Thus sati is a woman's choice and it is not prohibited by Vedic tradition, argues Apararka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brick|first1=David|title=The Dharmasastric Debate on Widow Burning|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=April–June 2010|volume=130|issue=2|pages=214|jstor=23044515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counter-arguments within Hinduism===
Reform and [[bhakti]] movements within Hinduism favoured egalitarian societies, and in line with the tenor of these beliefs, generally condemned the practice, sometimes explicitly. The 12th-century [[Virashaiva]] movement condemned the practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lingayat.com/alingayat/alingayat.asp "About Lingayat"] on lingayat.com  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205043742/http://www.lingayat.com/alingayat/alingayat.asp |date=5 February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Swaminarayan|Sahajananda Swami]], the founder of [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]] [[Swaminarayana]] sampradaya preached against sati in the 18th century in western India.

In a petition to the [[British East India Company]] in 1818, [[Ram Mohan Roy]] wrote that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"All these instances are murders according to every [[shastra]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mani|first=Lata |title=Contentious Traditions: The Debate on Sati in Colonial India|year=1998|publisher=University of California Press|pages=57}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In culture==
&lt;!--Jains condemned the practice in the 1st millennium, and same made efforts to stop would-be ''sati''s.  (I've commented this out, because although I had a source for this, I cannot find it now) --&gt;

European artists in the eighteenth century produced many images for their own native markets, showing the widows as heroic women, and moral exemplars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asnic.utexas.edu/asnic/hardgrave/Satiart.rft.html "The Representation of Sati: Four Eighteenth Century Etchings by Baltazard Solvyns"] by Robert L. Hardgrave, Jr. ''Bengal Past and Present'', 117 (1998): 57–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her article "[[Can the Subaltern Speak?]]" philosopher [[Gayatri Spivak]] discusses the British manipulation of sati practice,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=naJtCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage Gayatri Spivak: Deconstruction and the Ethics of Postcolonial Literary Interpretation] page 50, Ola Abdalkafor, Cambridge Scholars Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; and how sati takes the form of imprisoning women in the [[double bind]] of self-expression attributed to [[mental illness]] and social rejection, or of self-incrimination according to British colonial law.&lt;ref name="sharp6"&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Sharp
 | first = J.
 | title = Geographies of Postcolonialism
 | chapter = Chapter 6, Can the Subaltern Speak?
 | publisher = SAGE Publications
 | year = 2008
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The woman who commits sati takes the form of the [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] in Spivak's work, a form much of [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] studies takes very seriously.
The Australian rock band [[Tlot Tlot]]'s song "The Bonebass Suttee" on their 1991 album ''[[A Day at the Bay]]'' is about the practice.

The 2005 novel ''[[The Ashram]]'' by Indian writer [[Sattar Memon]], deals with the plight of an oppressed young woman in India, under pressure to commit suttee and the endeavours of a western spiritual aspirant to save her.

'''Schizoaffective disorder''' ('''SZA''', '''SZD''' or '''SAD''') is a [[mental disorder]] characterized by [[Psychosis|abnormal thought processes]] and an [[mood disorder|unstable mood]].&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|title=F25 Schizoaffective disorders|website=ICD-10 Version:2010|publisher=World Health Organization|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/F25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; The diagnosis is made when the person has features of both [[schizophrenia]] (usually psychosis) and a mood disorder—either [[bipolar disorder]] or [[Clinical depression|depression]]—but doesn't meet the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia or a mood disorder separately.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; The main criterion for the schizoaffective disorder diagnosis is the presence of psychotic symptoms for at least two weeks without any mood symptoms present.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; Schizoaffective disorder can often be [[misdiagnosed]]&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; when the correct diagnosis may be [[psychotic depression]], psychotic [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophreniform disorder]] or [[schizophrenia]]; this is important for patients or [[mental health consumers|consumers]] because the [[medical treatment|treatments]] and [[prognosis|prognoses]] for these other disorders are different from schizoaffective disorder.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaplan &amp; Saddock."&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kaplan |first1=HI| last2=Saddock |first2=VA |title=Synopsis of Psychiatry |year=2007 |publisher=Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7817-7327-0|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[DSM-5]] criteria revision for schizoaffective disorder is mainly an attempt to reduce the significant problems with misdiagnosis;&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; but whether this has been achieved awaits [[prospective cohort studies|outcome studies]] which have not been completed yet.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt;

There are two types of schizoaffective disorder: the '''bipolar type''', which is distinguished by symptoms of [[mania]], [[hypomania]], or [[mixed state (psychiatry)|mixed episode]]; and the '''depressive type''', which is distinguished by symptoms of [[major depressive episodes|depression]] only.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; Common symptoms of the disorder include [[hallucinations]], [[delusions]], and [[thought disorder|disorganized speech and thinking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brannon|first1=Guy E|last2=Bienenfeld|first2=David|last3=Talavera|first3=Francisco|title=Schizoaffective Disorder|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/294763-overview|website=Medscape Drugs &amp; Diseases|publisher=WebMD|date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The onset of symptoms usually begins in young adulthood, currently with an uncertain lifetime [[prevalence]] because the disorder was redefined, but DSM-IV prevalence estimates have been less than one percent of the population, in the range of 0.5 to 0.8 percent.&lt;ref name="Kaplan &amp; Saddock. p.501-502"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kaplan |first1=HI| last2=Saddock |first2=VA |title=Synopsis of Psychiatry |year=2007 |publisher=Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7817-7327-0|pages=501–502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis is based on observed behavior and the person's reported experiences.

[[Genetics]], [[neurobiology]], early and current [[environmental factor|environment]], [[behavior]]al, [[social]], and [[experience|experiential]] components appear to be important contributory factors; some recreational and prescription drugs may cause or worsen symptoms. No single isolated organic cause has been found, but extensive evidence exists for abnormalities in the metabolism of [[tetrahydrobiopterin]] (BH4), [[dopamine]], and [[glutamic acid]] in people with [[schizophrenia]], psychotic mood disorders, and schizoaffective disorder. People with schizoaffective disorder are likely to have [[comorbid|co-occurring]] conditions, including [[anxiety disorder]]s and [[substance use disorder]]s. Social problems such as long-term unemployment, poverty and homelessness are common. The average [[life expectancy]] of people with the disorder is shorter than those without it, due to increased physical health problems from an absence of [[health promotion|health promoting]] behaviors such as a [[sedentary lifestyle]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} and a higher [[suicide]] rate.

The mainstay of current treatment is [[antipsychotic]] medication combined with [[mood stabilizer]] medication or [[antidepressant]] medication, or both. There is growing concern by some researchers that antidepressants may increase psychosis, mania, and long-term mood episode cycling in the disorder. {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} When there is risk to self or others, usually early in treatment, hospitalization may be necessary.&lt;ref name="BeckerKilian2006" /&gt; [[Psychiatric rehabilitation]], [[psychotherapy]], and [[vocational rehabilitation]] are very important for [[recovery approach|recovery]] of higher psychosocial function.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Schizoaffective disorder is defined by ''mood disorder-free psychosis'' in the context of a long-term psychotic and mood disorder.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; [[Psychosis]] must meet criterion A for [[schizophrenia]] which may include [[delusions]], [[hallucinations]], [[thought disorder|disorganized speech, thinking or behavior]] and [[negative symptom]]s.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt;  Both delusions and hallucinations are classic symptoms of psychosis.&lt;ref name="APP textbook"&gt;Hales E and Yudofsky JA, eds, ''The American Psychiatric Press Textbook of Psychiatry'', Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc., 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  Delusions are false beliefs which are strongly held despite evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref name="APP textbook" /&gt;  Beliefs should not be considered delusional if they are in keeping with cultural beliefs.  Delusional beliefs may or may not reflect mood symptoms (for example, someone experiencing depression may or may not experience delusions of guilt).  Hallucinations are disturbances in perception involving any of the five senses, although [[auditory hallucination]]s (or "hearing voices") are the most common.&lt;ref name="APP textbook" /&gt;  A lack of responsiveness or negative symptoms include [[alogia]] (lack of spontaneous speech), [[blunted affect]] (reduced intensity of outward emotional expression), [[avolition]] (loss of motivation), and [[anhedonia]] (inability to experience pleasure).&lt;ref name="APP textbook" /&gt;  Negative symptoms can be more lasting and more debilitating than positive symptoms of psychosis.

Mood symptoms are of [[mania]], [[hypomania]], [[mixed state (psychiatry)|mixed episode]], or [[major depressive episode|depression]], and tend to be episodic rather than continuous.  A [[mixed episode]] represents a combination of symptoms of mania and depression at the same time.  Symptoms of mania include elevated or irritable mood, grandiosity (inflated self-esteem), agitation, risk-taking behavior, decreased need for sleep, poor concentration, rapid speech, and racing thoughts.&lt;ref name="APP textbook" /&gt;  Symptoms of depression include low mood, apathy, changes in appetite or weight, disturbances in sleep, changes in motor activity, fatigue, guilt or feelings of worthlessness, and suicidal thinking.

== Causes ==
A combination of genetic and [[environmental factor]]s are believed to play a role in the development of schizoaffective disorder.&lt;ref name=Lancet09&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Jim van Os|van Os J]], Kapur S |title=Schizophrenia |journal=Lancet |volume=374 |issue=9690 |pages=635–45 |date=August 2009  |pmid=19700006 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60995-8|url= http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/19525360/611943554/name/Schizophrenia+-+The+Lancet.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BMJ07&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Picchioni MM, Murray RM |title=Schizophrenia |journal=BMJ |volume=335 |issue=7610 |pages=91–5 |date=July 2007  |pmid=17626963 |pmc=1914490 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39227.616447.BE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Genetic studies do not support the view that [[schizophrenia]], psychotic [[mood disorders]] and schizoaffective disorder are distinct [[etiology|etiological]] entities, but rather the evidence suggests the existence of common inherited vulnerability that increases the risks for all these [[syndromes]]. Some susceptibility pathways may be specific for schizophrenia, others for [[bipolar disorder]], and yet other mechanisms and genes may confer risk for mixed schizophrenic and affective [or mood disorder] psychoses, but there is no support from genetics for the view that these are distinct disorders with distinct etiologies and [[pathogenesis]].

Viewed broadly then, biological and environmental factors interact with a person's genes in ways which may increase or decrease the risk for developing schizoaffective disorder; exactly how this happens (the biological mechanism) is not yet known.

== Diagnosis ==
Psychosis as a [[symptom]] of a psychiatric disorder is first and foremost a [[diagnosis of exclusion]].&lt;ref name=PsychosisExclusionaryDx /&gt; So a new-onset episode of psychosis ''cannot'' be considered to be a symptom of a psychiatric disorder until other relevant and known medical causes of psychosis are excluded, or ruled out.&lt;ref name=PsychosisExclusionaryDx /&gt; Many clinicians improperly perform, or entirely miss this step, introducing avoidable diagnostic error and misdiagnosis.&lt;ref name=PsychosisExclusionaryDx /&gt;

An initial assessment includes a comprehensive history and physical examination. Although no biological laboratory tests exist which confirm schizoaffective disorder, biological tests should be performed to [[diagnosis of exclusion|exclude]] psychosis associated with or caused by substance use, medications, toxins or poisons, surgical complications, or other medical illnesses. Since non-medical mental health practitioners are not trained to exclude medical causes of psychosis, people experiencing psychosis should be referred to an emergency department or hospital.

[[Delirium]] should be ruled out, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, indicating other underlying factors which includes medical illnesses.&lt;ref name=PsychosisExclusionaryDx /&gt; Excluding medical illnesses associated with psychosis is performed by using [[blood tests]] to measure:

* [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone]] to exclude [[hypothyroidism|hypo-]] or [[hyperthyroidism]],
* Basic electrolytes and [[serum calcium]] to rule out a metabolic disturbance,
* [[complete blood count|Full blood count]] including [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate|ESR]] to rule out a systemic infection or chronic disease, and
* [[Serology]] to exclude [[syphilis]] or [[HIV]] infection.

Other investigations which may be performed include:
* [[EEG]] to exclude [[epilepsy]], and an
* [[MRI]] or [[CT scan]] of the head to exclude brain lesions.

Blood tests are not usually repeated for relapse in people with an established diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, unless there is a specific ''medical'' indication. These may include serum [[blood sugar|BSL]] if [[olanzapine]] has previously been prescribed, thyroid function if lithium has previously been taken to rule out [[hypothyroidism]], liver function tests if [[chlorpromazine]] has been prescribed, [[Creatine kinase|CPK]] levels to exclude [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]], and a urinalysis and serum toxicology screening if substance use is suspected. Assessment and treatment may be done on an outpatient basis; admission to an inpatient facility is considered if there is a risk to self or others.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Illicit drugs aren't the only ones that precipitate psychosis or mania—prescribed drugs can too, and in particular, some psychiatric drugs. We investigated this and found that about 1 in 12 psychotic or manic patients in an inpatient psychiatric facility are there due to antidepressant-induced psychosis or mania. That's unfortunate for the field [of psychiatry] and disastrous for some of our patients.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{quote|quote=It is important to be understood here. I want to call attention to the fact that some persons with a family history of even the subtler forms of bipolar disorder or psychosis are more vulnerable than others to the mania- or psychosis-inducing potential of antidepressants, stimulants and sleeping medications. While I'm not making a blanket statement against these medications, ''I am urging caution in their use''. I believe [clinicians] should ask patients and their families whether there is a family history of bipolar disorder or psychosis before prescribing these medications. Most patients and their families don't know the answer when they are first asked, so time should be allowed for the patient to ask family or relatives, between the session when asked by [the clinician] and a follow-up session. This may increase the wait for a medication slightly, but because some patients are vulnerable, this is a necessary step for [the clinician] to take. ''I believe that psychiatry as a field has not emphasized this point sufficiently''. As a result, some patients have been harmed by the very treatments that were supposed to help them; or to the disgrace of psychiatry, [[iatrogenesis|harmed]] and then misdiagnosed.&lt;ref name="Preda A, MacLean RW, Mazure CM, Bowers MB Jr 2001 30–3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortunati F, Mazure C, Preda A, Wahl R, Bowers M Jr 2002 331–334" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Effexor-Psychosis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wellbutrin-Zyban-Psychosis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Steven M.

Substance-induced psychosis should also be ruled out. Both substance- and medication-induced psychosis can be [[diagnosis of exclusion|excluded]] to a high level of certainty while the person is psychotic, typically in an emergency department, using both a
* Broad spectrum urine toxicology screening, and a
* Full serum toxicology screening (of the blood).

Some [[dietary supplements]] may also induce psychosis or mania, but cannot be ruled out with laboratory tests. So a psychotic person's family, partner, or friends should be asked whether he or she is currently taking any dietary supplements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Food and Drug Administration|authorlink1=Food and Drug Administration|title=Final rule declaring dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids adulterated because they present an unreasonable risk|journal=Federal Register|date=11 February 2004|volume=69|issue=28|pages=6814, 6818|pmid=14968803|url=http://www.federalregister.gov/a/04-2912/p-276}} ({{Federal Register|69|6814}} and {{Federal Register|69|6818}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Common mistakes made when diagnosing psychotic patients include:&lt;ref name=PsychosisExclusionaryDx&gt;{{cite web|last1=Freudenreich|first1=Oliver|title=Differential Diagnosis of Psychotic Symptoms: Medical "Mimics"|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/forensic-psychiatry/differential-diagnosis-psychotic-symptoms-medical-%E2%80%9Cmimics%E2%80%9D|website=Psychiatric Times|publisher=UBM Medica|date=3 December 2012|accessdate=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Not properly excluding delirium,
* Missing a [[Substance-induced psychosis|toxic psychosis]] by not screening for substances ''and'' medications,
* Not appreciating medical abnormalities (e.g., vital signs),
* Not obtaining a medical history and family history,
* Indiscriminate screening without an organizing framework,
* Not asking family or others about dietary supplements,
* Premature diagnostic closure, and
* Not revisiting or questioning the initial diagnostic impression of primary psychiatric disorder.

Only after these relevant and known causes of psychosis have been ruled out can a psychiatric [[differential diagnosis]] be made. A mental health clinician will incorporate family history, observation of a psychotic person's behavior while the person is experiencing active symptoms, to begin a psychiatric differential diagnosis. Diagnosis also includes self-reported experiences, as well as behavioral abnormalities reported by family members, friends, or significant others. Mistakes in this stage include:
* Not screening for [[dissociative disorders]]. [[Dissociative identity disorder]] and psychotic symptoms in schizoaffective disorder have considerable overlap, yet a different overall treatment approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shibayama M | year = 2011 | title = Differential diagnosis between dissociative disorders and schizophrenia | url = | journal = Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi=Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica | volume = 113 | issue = 9| pages = 906–911 | pmid = 22117396 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DSM-5 criteria ===
The most widely used criteria for diagnosing schizoaffective disorder are from the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s ''[[DSM-5|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5]]''.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt;

The DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder definition was plagued by problems of being inconsistently (or [[reliability (statistics)|unreliably]]) used on patients;&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; when the diagnosis is made, it doesn't stay with most patients over time;&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; and it has questionable [[validity (statistics)|diagnostic validity]] (that is, it doesn't describe a distinct disorder, nor predict any particular outcome).&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; These problems have been slightly reduced (or "modestly improved") in the [[DSM-5]] according to Carpenter.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt;

When [[psychosis|psychotic]] symptoms are confined to an episode of [[mania]] or [[depression (mood)|depression]] (with or without [[mixed affective state|mixed features]]), the diagnosis is that of a “[[psychosis|psychotic]]” [[mood disorder]], namely either psychotic [[bipolar disorder]] or [[psychotic depression|psychotic major depression]]. Only when psychotic states persist in a sustained fashion for two weeks or longer without concurrent affective symptoms is the diagnosis schizoaffective disorder, [[schizophreniform disorder]] or [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt;

The second cardinal guideline in the DSM-5 diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is one of timeframe.
::DSM-5 requires two episodes of psychosis (whereas DSM-IV needed only one) to qualify for the schizoaffective disorder diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; As such, it is no longer an "episode diagnosis."&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; The new schizoaffective framework looks at the time from "the [first episode of] psychosis up to the current episode [of psychosis], rather than only defining a single episode with [co-occurring] psychotic and mood [[syndrome]]s."&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; Specifically, one of the episodes of psychosis must last a minimum of two weeks without mood disorder symptoms, but the person may be mildly to moderately depressed while psychotic.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; The other period of psychosis "requires the overlap of mood [disorder] symptoms with psychotic symptoms to be conspicuous" and last for a greater portion of the disorder.&lt;ref name="SadCreation"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Malhi GS | title = Making up schizoaffective disorder: Cosmetic changes to a sad creation? | journal = Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 47 | issue = 10 | pages = 891–4 | date = Oct 2013 | pmid = 24072567 | doi = 10.1177/0004867413505522 | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These two changes are intended by the DSM-5 workgroup to accomplish two goals:&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt;

* Increase the diagnosis' consistency (or reliability) when it is used;
* Significantly decrease the overall use of the schizoaffective disorder diagnosis.

If the schizoaffective diagnosis is used less often, other diagnoses (like psychotic mood disorders and schizophrenia) are likely to be used more often; but this is hypothetical until real-world data arrive. Validity problems with the diagnosis remain and await further work in the fields of [[psychiatric genetics]], [[neuroimaging]], and [[cognitive science]] that includes the overlapping fields of [[cognitive neuroscience|cognitive]], [[affective neuroscience|affective]], and [[social neuroscience]], which may change the way schizoaffective disorder is [[construct (philosophy of science)|conceptualized]] and defined in future versions of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] and [[ICD]].&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=TransformingDiagnosis&gt;{{cite news|title=NIMH Director's Blog: Transforming Diagnosis|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml|accessdate=October 2013|newspaper=NIMH Director's Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Types ====
One of two types of schizoaffective disorder may be noted in a diagnosis based on the mood component of the disorder:&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt;

* Bipolar type, when the disturbance includes [[manic episodes]], [[hypomania]], or [[mixed episodes]]—major depressive episodes also typically occur;
* Depressive type, when the disturbance includes major depressive episodes exclusively—that is, without manic, hypomanic, or mixed episodes.

==== Problems with DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder ====
The [[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Association's]] DSM-IV criteria for schizoaffective disorder persisted for 19 years (1994–2013). Clinicians adequately trained in diagnosis used the schizoaffective diagnosis too often,&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; largely because the criteria were poorly defined, [[ambiguity|ambiguous]], and hard to use (or poorly [[operationalization|operationalized]]).&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid18199238&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Malhi GS, Green M, Fagiolini A, Peselow ED, Kumari V | title = Schizoaffective disorder: diagnostic issues and future recommendations | journal = Bipolar Disorders | volume = 10 | issue = 1 Pt 2 | pages = 215–30 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18199238 | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-5618.2007.00564.x | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; Poorly trained clinicians used the diagnosis without making necessary [[diagnosis of exclusion|exclusions]] of common causes of psychosis, including some prescribed psychiatric medications.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; Specialty books written by experts on schizoaffective disorder have existed for over eight years before DSM-5 describing the overuse of the diagnosis.&lt;ref name="The Overlap of Schizophrenic and Affective Spectra"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marneros|first1=A|last2=Akiskal|first2=HS |title=The Overlap of Schizophrenic and Affective Spectra |year=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |isbn= 0-521-85858-5 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manic-Depressive Illness: Bipolar Disorders and Recurrent Depression, 2nd Edition"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goodwin|first1=FK |last2=Jamison|first2=KR |title=Manic-Depressive Illness: Bipolar Disorders and Recurrent Depression, 2nd Edition |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-513579-2|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bipolar Disorders: Mixed States, Rapid Cycling and Atypical Forms"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goodwin|first1=FK|last2=Marneros|first2=A |title=Bipolar Disorders: Mixed States, Rapid Cycling and Atypical Forms |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-521-83517-8 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective Disorders: New Research"&gt;{{cite book |author=Murray WH |title=Schizoaffective Disorders: New Research |year=2006 |publisher=[[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]] |location=New York |isbn=1-60021-030-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpenter and the DSM-5 schizoaffective disorders workgroup analyzed data made available to them in 2009, and reported in May 2013 that:&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;a recent review of psychotic disorders from large private insurance and Medicare databases in the U.S. found that the diagnosis of DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder was used for about a third of cases with non-affective psychotic disorders. Hence, this unreliable and poorly defined diagnosis is clearly overused.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As stated above, the DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder diagnosis is very inconsistently used or unreliable.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; A diagnosis is unreliable when several different mental health professionals observing the same individual make different diagnoses excessively.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; Even when a structured DSM-IV diagnostic interview and best estimate procedures were made by experts in the field that included information from family informants and prior clinical records, [[interrater reliability|reliability]] was still poor for the DSM-IV schizoaffective diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt;

The DSM-IV schizoaffective diagnosis isn't stable over time either.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; An initial diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder during time spent at a psychiatric inpatient facility was stable at 6-month and 24-month follow ups for only 36% of patients.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; By comparison, diagnostic stability was 92% for schizophrenia, 83% for bipolar disorder and 74% for major depression.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; Most patients diagnosed with DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder are later diagnosed with a different disorder, and that disorder is more stable over time than the DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt;

In April 2009, Carpenter and the DSM-5 schizoaffective disorder workgroup reported that they were "developing new criteria for schizoaffective disorder to improve reliability and [[face validity]]," and were "determining whether the dimensional assessment of mood [would] justify a recommendation to drop schizoaffective disorder as a diagnostic category."&lt;ref name="OnTrack" /&gt; Speaking to an audience at the May 2009 annual conference of the [[American Psychiatric Association]], Carpenter said:&lt;ref name="OnTrack" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We had hoped to get rid of schizoaffective [disorder] as a diagnostic category [in the DSM-5] because we don't think it's [a] valid [scientific entity] and we don't think it's reliable. On the other hand, we think it's absolutely indispensable to clinical practice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A major reason why DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder was indispensable to clinical practice is because it offered clinicians a diagnosis for patients with psychosis in the context of mood disorder whose clinical picture, at the time diagnosed, appeared different from DSM-IV "schizophrenia" or "mood disorder with psychotic features."

But DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder carries an unnecessarily worse prognosis than a "mood disorder with psychotic features" diagnosis,&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; because [[longitudinal data|long-term data]] revealed that a significant proportion of DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder patients had 15-year outcomes indistinguishable from patients with mood disorders with or without psychotic features,&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fifteen Year Schizoaffective Follow Up" /&gt; even though the clinical picture at the time of first diagnosis looked different from both schizophrenia and mood disorders.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fifteen Year Schizoaffective Follow Up" /&gt;

These problems with the DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder definition result in most people the diagnosis is used on being misdiagnosed;&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; furthermore, [[cohort study|outcome studies]] done 10 years after the diagnosis was released showed that the group of patients defined by the DSM-IV and ICD-10 schizoaffective diagnosis had significantly better outcomes than predicted, so the diagnosis carries a misleading and unnecessarily poor [[prognosis]].&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; The DSM-IV criteria for schizoaffective disorder will continue to be used on U.S. board examinations in psychiatry through the end of 2014; established practitioners may continue to use the problematic DSM-IV definition much further into the future also.

==== DSM-5 research directions ====
The new schizoaffective disorder criteria continue to have questionable diagnostic validity.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; Questionable diagnostic validity does not doubt that people with symptoms of psychosis and mood disorder need treatment—psychosis and mood disorder must be treated. Instead, questionable diagnostic validity means there are unresolved problems with the way the DSM-5 [[categorization|categorizes]] and defines schizoaffective disorder.

[[File:Emil Kraepelin2.gif|thumb|left|upright|[[Emil Kraepelin|Emil Kraepelin's]] [[Kraepelinian dichotomy|dichotomy]] ({{circa|1898}}) continues to influence [[nosology|classification and diagnosis]] in psychiatry]]

A core concept in modern psychiatry since [[DSM III#DSM-III (1980)|DSM-III]] was released in 1980, is the categorical separation of mood disorders from schizophrenia, known as the [[Kraepelinian dichotomy]]. [[Emil Kraepelin]] introduced the idea that schizophrenia was separate from mood disorders after observing patients with symptoms of psychosis and mood disorder, over a century ago, in 1898. This was a time before [[genetics]] were known and before any treatments existed for [[mental illness]].&lt;ref name="Craddock N p.109"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Craddock N, Owen MJ | title = The Kraepelinian dichotomy&amp;nbsp;– going, going...

The Kraepelinian dichotomy continues to be used in DSM-5 despite having been challenged by [[empirical data|data]] from modern psychiatric genetics for over eight years,&lt;ref name="EndofKraepelinianDichotomy"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Craddock N, Owen MJ | title = The beginning of the end for the Kraepelinian dichotomy | journal = Br J Psychiatry | volume = 186 | issue = 5 | pages = 364–6 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15863738 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.186.5.364 | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is now [[empirical evidence|evidence]] of a significant overlap in the genetics of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name="Craddock N p.109" /&gt; According to this genetic evidence, the Kraepelinian categorical separation of mood disorders from schizophrenia at the foundation of the current classification and diagnostic system is a mistaken [[false dichotomy]].&lt;ref name="Craddock N p.109" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mental_Health_on_the_Spectrum&gt;{{cite news|title=Mental Health on the Spectrum|url=http://www.nature.com/news/mental-health-on-the-spectrum-1.12842|accessdate=September 2013|newspaper=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dichotomy at the foundation of the current system forms the basis for a convoluted schizoaffective disorder definition in DSM-IV that resulted in excessive misdiagnosis.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; Real life schizoaffective disorder patients have significant and enduring symptoms that bridge what are incorrectly assumed to be categorically separate disorders, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name="Structure_of_Psychotic_Disorders_in_DSM_5" /&gt; People with [[psychotic depression]], bipolar disorder with a history of psychosis, and schizophrenia with mood symptoms also have symptoms that bridge psychosis and mood disorders.&lt;ref name="Craddock N p.109" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mental_Health_on_the_Spectrum" /&gt; The categorical diagnostic manuals don't reflect reality in their separation of psychosis (via the schizophrenia diagnosis) from mood disorder, nor do they currently emphasize the actual overlap found in real-life patients.&lt;ref name="Craddock N p.109" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mental_Health_on_the_Spectrum" /&gt; Thus, they are likely to continue to introduce [[false dichotomy|either-or]] [[conceptualization|conceptual]] and diagnostic error, by way of [[confirmation bias]] into clinicians' [[mindset]]s, hindering accurate assessment and treatment.&lt;ref name="Craddock N p.109" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mental_Health_on_the_Spectrum" /&gt;

The new definition continues the lack of [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] of the old definition.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Structure_of_Psychotic_Disorders_in_DSM_5" /&gt; Simpler, clearer, and more usable definitions of the diagnosis were supported by certain members of the DSM-5 workgroup (see next paragraph); these were debated but deemed premature, because more "research [is] needed to establish a new [[nosology|classification system]] of equal or greater validity"&lt;ref name="Structure_of_Psychotic_Disorders_in_DSM_5" /&gt; to the existing system.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Structure_of_Psychotic_Disorders_in_DSM_5" /&gt; Because of DSM-5's continuing problematic categorical foundation, schizoaffective disorder's conceptual and diagnostic validity remains doubtful.&lt;ref name="Craddock N p.109" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mental_Health_on_the_Spectrum" /&gt; After enough research is completed and [[empirical evidence|data]] exists, future diagnostic advances will need to either eliminate and replace, or soften and bridge, the hard categorical separation of mood disorders from schizophrenia; most likely using a [[spectrum approach|spectrum or dimensional approach]] to diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mental_Health_on_the_Spectrum" /&gt;

More [[Occam's razor|parsimonious]] definitions than the current one were considered by Carpenter and the DSM-5 workgroup:&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;One option for the DSM-5 would have been to remove the schizoaffective disorder category and to add affective [or mood] symptoms [that is, [[mania]], [[hypomania]], [[mixed state (psychiatry)|mixed episode]], or [[major depressive episode|depression]]] as a dimension to [[schizophrenia]] and [[schizophreniform disorder]] ''or'' to define a single category for the co-occurrence of psychosis and mood symptoms. This option was extensively debated but ultimately deemed to be premature in the absence of sufficient clinical and theoretical validating data justifying such a … reconceptualization. Additionally, there appeared to be no practical way to introduce affect [or mood] dimensions covering the entire course of illness, that would capture the current [[conceptualization|concept]] of periods of psychosis related and unrelated to mood episodes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{quote|quote=[N]o valid biomarkers or laboratory measures have emerged to distinguish between affective psychosis [or psychotic [[mood disorders]]] and [[schizophrenia]]. To the contrary, ''the idea of a dichotomy between these types of conditions has proven naïve''. [T]he admixture of “schizophrenic” and affective [or mood] symptoms is a feature of many, or even most, cases with severe mental illness. Most ''presenting symptoms of psychosis have little validity in determining diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment response'' in psychosis. [U]ltimately a more … [[spectrum approach|dimensional approach]] [to assessment and treatment] will be required.}}

The field of [[psychiatry]] has begun to question its assumptions and analyze its data in order to merge closer with [[evidence-based medicine]].&lt;ref name="Mental_Health_on_the_Spectrum" /&gt; The removal of the "episode diagnosis," and the addition of two episodes of psychosis, as qualifications for the DSM-5 schizoaffective diagnosis, may improve the diagnosis' consistency over DSM-IV for research purposes, where diagnostic criteria are by necessity followed ''exactingly''.&lt;ref name="SadCreation" /&gt; But the new definition remains long, unwieldy, and perhaps still not very useful for community clinicians—with two psychoses, one for two weeks minimum and without mood disorder (but the person can be mildly or moderately depressed) and the other with significant mood disorder and psychosis lasting for most of the time, and with lasting mood symptoms for most of the residual portion of the illness.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SadCreation" /&gt; Community clinicians used the previous definition "for about a third of cases with non-affective psychotic disorders."&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; Non-affective psychotic disorders are, by definition, not schizoaffective disorder. For clinicians to make such sizeable errors of misdiagnosis may imply systemic problems with the schizoaffective disorder diagnosis itself. Already, at least one expert believes the new schizoaffective definition hasn't gone far enough to solve the previous definition's problems.&lt;ref name="SadCreation" /&gt;

From a scientific standpoint, modern clinical psychiatry is still a very young, underdeveloped medical specialty because its target organ, the human brain, is not yet well understood. The human brain's [[neural circuit]]s, for example, are just beginning to be mapped by modern neuroscience in the [[Human Connectome Project]] and [[CLARITY]]. Clinical psychiatry, furthermore, has begun to understand and acknowledge its current limitations—but further steps by the field are required to significantly reduce misdiagnosis and [[iatrogenesis|patient harm]]; this is crucial both for responsible patient care and to retain public trust. Looking forward, a [[paradigm shift]] is needed in psychiatric research to address unanswered questions about schizoaffective disorder. The [[spectrum approach|dimensional]] Research Domain Criteria project currently being developed by the U.S. National Institutes of Mental Health, may be the specific problem solving framework psychiatry needs to develop a more scientifically mature understanding of schizoaffective disorder as well as all other mental disorders.&lt;ref name="RDoC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/news/science-news/2013/introduction-to-rdoc.shtml | title=Introduction to RDoC | publisher=[[National Institute of Mental Health|NIMH]] | accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
The primary treatment of schizoaffective disorder is medication, with improved outcomes using combined long-term psychological and social supports.&lt;ref name=Lancet09 /&gt; Hospitalization may occur for severe episodes either voluntarily or (if mental health legislation allows it) [[involuntary commitment|involuntarily]]. Long-term hospitalization is uncommon since [[deinstitutionalization]] beginning in the 1950s, although it still occurs.&lt;ref name="BeckerKilian2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Becker T, Kilian R |year=2006 |title=Psychiatric services for people with severe mental illness across western Europe: what can be generalized from current knowledge about differences in provision, costs and outcomes of mental health care? |journal=[[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] Supplement |volume=113 |pages=9–16 |pmid=16445476 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2005.00711.x |issue=429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community support services including drop-in centers, visits by members of a [[Community mental health service|community mental health team]], supported employment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McGurk SR, Mueser KT, Feldman K, Wolfe R, Pascaris A | title = Cognitive training for supported employment: 2–3 year outcomes of a randomized controlled trial. | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 164 | issue = 3 | pages = 437–41 |date=Mar 2007 | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/164/3/437 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070303025101/http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/164/3/437 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2007-03-03 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.164.3.437 | pmid = 17329468 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and support groups are common. Evidence indicates that regular exercise has a positive effect on the physical and mental health of those with schizoaffective disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gorczynski P, Faulkner G |title=Exercise therapy for schizophrenia |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=5 |pages=CD004412 |year=2010 |pmid=20464730 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004412.pub2 |pmc=4164954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participating in internet forums is sometimes used by people with schizoaffective disorder in addition to outpatient medication treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schizoaffective Disorder Treatment|url=http://psychcentral.com/disorders/sx4t.htm#self|website=Psych Central|at=Self-Help}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lawn|first1=Sharon|title=Self-Management: Supporting People with Mental Health &amp; Physical Health Conditions|url=http://www.mifellowship.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/3.%20Health%20Self-Management/3.2%20Dr%20Lawn%27s%20presentation.pdf|website=Mental Illness Fellowship|format=PDF|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schizoaffective Forum|url=http://www.mentalhealthforum.net/forum/forumdisplay.php?136-Schizoaffective-Forum|website=Mental Health Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Therapy ===
Skillfully delivered psychosocial treatments are perhaps the most important component of pushing for and encouraging improved overall functioning in schizoaffective disorder.  Supportive [[psychotherapy]] and [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] are both helpful.&lt;ref name="BMJ best practice" /&gt;  Intensive case management (ICM) has been shown to reduce hospitalizations, improve adherence to treatment, and improve social functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Dieterich M, Irving CB, Park B, et al | title=Intensive Case Management for Severe Mental Illness | journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume= 1| issue=CD007906 | date=January 6, 2017 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007906.pub3 | editor1-last=Dieterich | editor1-first=Marina | pmid=28067944| pmc=4233116 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With ICM, clients are assigned a case manager responsible for coordination of care and assisting clients to access supports to address needs in multiple areas related to well-being, including housing.

High quality psychosocial or [[psychiatric rehabilitation]] is very important for [[recovery approach|recovery]] from schizoaffective disorder. Psychiatric or psychosocial rehabilitation focuses on solving community integration problems such as obtaining and keeping housing and increasing involvement in positive social groups. It also focuses on improving and increasing [[activities of daily living]]; increasing daily healthy habits (such as normalizing [[Circadian rhythm sleep disorder|sleep-wake cycles]]; increasing early morning natural light exposure; increasing moderate exercise [such as 20{{ndash}}30 minutes of moderate to brisk early morning to pre-afternoon walking daily, in order to help normalize circadian rhythms]; helping individuals understand the specific benefits of healthy food choices; increasing stress-reduction activities such as yoga, tai chi, or meditation); and decreasing unhealthy behaviors (such as substance abuse and smoking); thereby significantly improving quality of life. High quality psychiatric rehabilitation may also focus on [[vocational rehabilitation]] including preparing the client for volunteer, part-time paid work, returning to school for further education, job skills training for full-time flexible or supported employment, and other client self-improvement efforts. Core principles of effective psychiatric rehabilitation must include providing ''hope'' when the client lacks it, ''respect for the client'' wherever they are in the recovery process, ''empowering'' the client, teaching the client ''wellness planning'', and emphasizing the importance for the client to develop ''social support networks''.&lt;ref&gt;PSR/RPS Canada, [http://www.psrrpscanada.ca/index.php?src=gendocs&amp;link=About], "PSR/RPS Canada Core Principles and Values"{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324203048/http://www.psrrpscanada.ca/index.php?src=gendocs&amp;link=About|date=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A long-term goal of psychiatric and vocational rehabilitation is that the client learn and actively engage in active stress management while in education or employment, while receiving treatment.

Psychiatric rehabilitation consists of eight main areas:

* Psychiatric (symptom reduction and management)
* Health and Medical (maintaining consistency of care)
* Housing (safe environments)
* Basic living skills ([[hygiene]], meals [including increasing healthy food intake and reducing processed food intake], safety, planning and chores)
* Social ([[Intimate relationship|relationships]], family boundaries, communication and integration of client into the community)
* Education and vocation (coping skills, [[motivation]] and suitable goals chosen by client)
* Finance ([[personal budget]])
* Community and legal (resources)

=== Medication ===
[[File:Lamictal 25mg.JPG|thumb|[[Lamotrigine]] (trade name Lamictal) is a common [[mood stabilizer]] medication]]
Few medications are approved specifically for schizoaffective disorder.&lt;ref name="BMJ best practice"&gt;BMJ Group, [http://bestpractice.bmj.com/best-practice/monograph/1199/treatment/step-by-step.html "Schizoaffective disorders: Treatment"], 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In general, medications are chosen to reduce symptoms of psychosis and mood disorder.

[[Antipsychotic]] medication is usually required both for acute treatment and the prevention of relapse.&lt;ref name="APP textbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="APA guideline"&gt;American Psychiatric Association, [http://psychiatryonline.org/content.aspx?bookid=28&amp;sectionid=1665359 "Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients with Schizophrenia, Second Edition"], 2004 {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140306093804/http://psychiatryonline.org/content.aspx?bookID=28&amp;sectionID=1665359%2346267 |date=6 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no single antipsychotic of choice in treating schizoaffective disorder, but [[atypical antipsychotic]]s should be considered because they have mood-stabilizing activity.&lt;ref name="APP textbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BMJ best practice" /&gt; [[Paliperidone]] is an antipsychotic with FDA approval for the treatment of schizoaffective disorder.&lt;ref name="Manufacturer's Official webpage"&gt;Paliperidone, [http://www.invega.com/schizoaffective-disorder-treatment/ "Schizoaffective disorders: Treatment"], 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Antipsychotics should be used at the minimum dose necessary to control symptoms.&lt;ref name="BMJ best practice" /&gt;  Potential side effects include [[extrapyramidal symptoms]], including [[tremor]], muscle stiffness, and [[Psychomotor agitation|restlessness]] or [[akathisia]].&lt;ref name=Stahl&gt;Stahl SM, Stahl's Essential Psychopharmacology: Neuroscientific basis and practical applications, New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atypical antipsychotics]] carry a risk of [[metabolic syndrome]], including weight gain, increased [[blood sugar]], and increased [[blood cholesterol]], so regular monitoring of weight and bloodwork should be carried out.&lt;ref name="Stahl" /&gt;  Some atypical antipsychotics, such as [[ziprasidone]] and [[aripiprazole]], are associated with less risk than others, such as olanzapine.&lt;ref name="BMJ best practice" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Stahl /&gt;  Medication choice is based on how [[efficacy|effectively]] it reduces symptoms, how few side effects it causes, and cost.

In people with treatment-refractory psychosis, a [[clozapine]] trial should be considered.&lt;ref name="APP textbook" /&gt;  Clozapine is an [[atypical antipsychotic]] that is recognized as being particularly effective when other antipsychotic agents have failed.&lt;ref name="Stahl" /&gt; Clozapine should also be considered in people with chronic and persistent suicidal thinking and behaviour, as it has been shown to reduce the risk of suicide in patients with schizoaffective disorder and a history of suicidality.&lt;ref name="APA guideline" /&gt;  Between 0.5 and 2% of patients taking clozapine may develop a life-threatening complication called [[agranulocytosis]], which is a significant drop in a type of [[white blood cell]].&lt;ref name=Stahl_70&gt;{{cite book|last=Stahl|first=Stephen M.|title=Essential Psychopharmacology of Antipsychotics and Mood Stabilizers|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-89074-8|page=70|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mPxu4fRKpoIC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=agranulocytosis+antipsychotic+stahl#v=onepage&amp;q=agranulocytosis%20antipsychotic%20stahl&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this risk, people taking clozapine must have regular monitoring of [[blood cell count]]s.&lt;ref name="Stahl_70" /&gt;

The management of the bipolar type of schizoaffective disorder is similar to the [[treatment of bipolar disorder]], with the goal of preventing mood episodes and cycling.&lt;ref name="Stahl" /&gt; [[Lithium (medication)|Lithium]] or anticonvulsant mood stabilizers such as [[valproic acid]], [[carbamazepine]], and [[lamotrigine]] are prescribed in combination with an antipsychotic.&lt;ref name="BMJ best practice" /&gt;

For depression, if an antidepressant is prescribed, ''extra attentiveness must be given'' by the prescribing clinician due its risk for long-term mood cycle acceleration (that is, inducing more frequent episodes of depression per unit of time) and [[prescribed medication-induced psychosis|medication-induced psychosis]] or mania.&lt;ref name="Preda A, MacLean RW, Mazure CM, Bowers MB Jr 2001 30–3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortunati F, Mazure C, Preda A, Wahl R, Bowers M Jr 2002 331–334" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Effexor-Psychosis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wellbutrin-Zyban-Psychosis" /&gt; For individuals who show emerging [[psychosis]], [[mania]], [[mixed state (psychiatry)|mixed episode]] symptoms, or mood cycle acceleration, switching to an antipsychotic plus lithium or lamotrigine is preferable to antidepressants.

For individuals who experience anxiety, [[anxiolytic|anti-anxiety medications]] can be used, usually on a short-term basis.&lt;ref name="BMJ best practice" /&gt; [[Benzodiazepine]]s, including [[lorazepam]], [[clonazepam]] and [[diazepam]], are types of anti-anxiety medications. Care must be taken when prescribing benzodiazepines due to the risk of the person developing [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] and [[dependence (behavioral medicine)|dependence]].&lt;ref name="Stahl" /&gt;

=== Electroconvulsive therapy ===
[[Electroconvulsive therapy]], or ECT, may be considered for patients with schizoaffective disorder experiencing severe depression or severe psychotic symptoms that have not responded to treatment with antipsychotics.&lt;ref name="APA guideline" /&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
Schizoaffective disorder is estimated to occur in 0.5 to 0.8 percent of people at some point in their life.&lt;ref name="Kaplan &amp; Saddock. p.501-502" /&gt; It is more common in women than men; however, this is because of the high concentration of women in the depressive subcategory, whereas the bipolar subtype has a more or less even gender distribution.

== History ==
The term ''schizoaffective psychosis'' was introduced by the American psychiatrist Jacob Kasanin in 1933&lt;ref name=pmid16857267&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lake CR, Hurwitz N | title = Schizoaffective disorders are psychotic mood disorders; there are no schizoaffective disorders | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 143 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 255–87 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16857267 | doi = 10.1016/j.psychres.2005.08.012 | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe an episodic psychotic illness with predominant affective symptoms, that was thought at the time to be a good-prognosis schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodwin|Jamison|2007|page=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kasanin's concept of the illness was influenced by the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] teachings of [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]] and Kasanin postulated that ''schizoaffective psychosis'' was caused by "emotional conflicts" of a "mainly sexual nature" and that psychoanalysis "would help prevent the recurrence of such attacks."&lt;ref name="Goodwin &amp; Marneros. p190"&gt;{{harvnb|Goodwin|Marneros|2005|page=190}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He based his description on a case study of nine individuals.&lt;ref name="Goodwin &amp; Marneros. p190" /&gt;

[[File:Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Karl Kahlbaum]] (1828{{ndash}}1899)]]

Other psychiatrists, before and after Kasanin, have made scientific observations of schizoaffective disorder based on assumptions of a biological and genetic cause of the illness. In 1863, German psychiatrist [[Karl Kahlbaum]] (1828{{ndash}}1899) described schizoaffective disorders as a separate group in his ''vesania typica circularis''.&lt;ref name="Goodwin &amp; Marneros. p189"&gt;{{harvnb|Goodwin|Marneros|2005|page=189}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kahlbaum distinguished between cross-sectional and longitudinal observations. (''Cross-sectional'' refers to observation of a single, specific episode of the illness, for example, one episode of psychotic depression; while ''longitudinal'' refers to long-term observation of many distinct episodes [similar or different] often occurring over the span of years.) In 1920, psychiatrist [[Emil Kraepelin]] (1856{{ndash}}1926), the founder of contemporary scientific psychiatry, observed a "great number" of cases that had characteristics of both groups of psychoses that he originally posited were two distinct and separate illnesses, ''dementia praecox'' (now called schizophrenia) and ''manic depressive insanity'' (now called bipolar disorders [plural since there are more than one type of bipolar disorder] and recurrent depression).&lt;ref name="Goodwin &amp; Marneros. p190" /&gt;

Kraepelin acknowledged that "there are many overlaps in this area," that is, the area between schizophrenia and mood disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marneros|Akiskal|2007|pages=3–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, psychiatrist [[Kurt Schneider]] (1887{{ndash}}1967) began to further refine conceptualizations of the different forms that schizoaffective disorders can take since he observed "concurrent and sequential types".&lt;ref name="Goodwin &amp; Marneros. p190" /&gt; (The ''concurrent type'' of illness he referred to is a longitudinal course of illness with episodes of mood disorder and psychosis occurring predominantly at the same time [now called psychotic mood disorders or affective psychosis]; while his ''sequential type'' refers to a longitudinal course predominantly marked by alternating mood and psychotic episodes.)&lt;ref name="Goodwin &amp; Marneros. p189" /&gt; Schneider described schizoaffective disorders as "cases in-between" the traditional Kraepelinian dichotomy of schizophrenia and mood disorders.&lt;ref name="Goodwin &amp; Marneros. p189" /&gt;

The historical clinical observation that schizoaffective disorder is an overlap of schizophrenia and mood disorders is explained by genes for both illnesses being present in individuals with schizoaffective disorder; specifically, recent research shows that schizophrenia and mood disorders share common genes ''and'' polygenic variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Van Snellenberg JX, de Candia T | title = Meta-analytic evidence for familial coaggregation of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder | journal = Arch.

[[File:Emil Kraepelin 1926.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Emil Kraepelin]] (1856{{ndash}}1926) Embracing the [[Kraepelinian dichotomy]] in [[DSM-III]] in 1980, while a step forward from [[psychodynamic]] explanations of the disorder, introduced significant problems in schizoaffective disorder diagnosis, as explained recently by the [[DSM-5]] workgroup]]
Schizoaffective disorder was included as a subtype of schizophrenia in DSM-I and DSM-II, though research showed a schizophrenic cluster of symptoms in individuals with a family history of mood disorders whose illness course, other symptoms and treatment outcome were otherwise more akin to bipolar disorder than to schizophrenia. DSM-III placed schizoaffective disorder in "Psychotic Disorders Not Otherwise Specified" before being formally recognized in DSM-III-R.&lt;ref name="Goodwin &amp; Jamison. p96"&gt;{{harvnb|Goodwin|Jamison|2007|page=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt; DSM-III-R included its own diagnostic criteria as well as the subtypes, bipolar and depressive.&lt;ref name="Goodwin &amp; Jamison. p96" /&gt; In DSM-IV, published in 1994, schizoaffective disorders belonged to the category "Other Psychotic Disorders" and included almost the same criteria and the same subtypes of illness as DSM-III-R, with the addition of mixed bipolar symptomatology.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodwin|Marneros|2005|page=192}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR (published in 2000) criteria for schizoaffective disorder were poorly defined and poorly [[operationalization|operationalized]].&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; These [[ambiguous]] and unreliable criteria lasted 19 years and led clinicians to significantly overuse the schizoaffective disorder diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; Patients commonly diagnosed with DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder showed a clinical picture at time of diagnosis that appeared different from schizophrenia or psychotic mood disorders using DSM-IV criteria, but who as a group, were [[longitudinal study|longitudinally determined]] to have outcomes indistinguishable from those with mood disorders with or without psychotic features.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; A poor prognosis was assumed to apply to these patients by most clinicians, and this poor prognosis was [[iatrogenic|harmful]] to many patients.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective Disorder Diagnosis &amp; Substandard Treatment"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lake CR, Hurwitz N | title = Schizoaffective disorder merges schizophrenia and bipolar disorders as one disease | journal = Current Opinion in Psychiatry | volume = 20 | pages = 365–79| year = 2007 | pmid=17551352 | pmc= | doi=10.1097/YCO.0b013e3281a305ab | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poor prognosis for DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder was not based on [[cohort study|patient outcomes]] [[empirical research|research]], but was caused by poorly defined criteria interacting with clinical tradition and belief; clinician [[enculturation]] with [[unscientific]] assumptions from the diagnosis' history (discussed above), including the invalid Kraepelinian dichotomy;&lt;ref name="Craddock N p.109" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mental_Health_on_the_Spectrum" /&gt; and by clinicians being unfamiliar with the [[empirical science|scientific]] limitations of the diagnostic and classification system.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt;

The DSM-5 schizoaffective disorder workgroup analyzed all of the available research [[Empirical science#Philosophy of science|evidence]] on schizoaffective disorder, and concluded that "presenting symptoms of psychosis have little validity in determining diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment response."&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; Given our understanding of overlapping genetics in bipolar disorders, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia, as well as the overlap in treatments for these disorders; but given the lack of specificity of presenting symptoms for determining diagnosis, prognosis or treatment response in these psychotic illness [[syndrome]]s, the limits of our knowledge are clearer: ''Presenting symptoms of psychosis describe only presenting symptoms to be treated, and not much more''.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt; Schizoaffective disorder was changed to a longitudinal or life course diagnosis in DSM-5 for this reason.&lt;ref name="Schizoaffective_in_the_DSM5" /&gt;

== Research ==
Evidence is sorely lacking about schizoaffective disorder's (likely multiple) causes and mechanisms (knowing these leads to specific and consistently effective treatments), and about how exactly mood episodes and psychosis are related (knowing this may lead to a simpler, clearer, and more usable behavioral definition of the disorder; as well as a better diagnostic system).&lt;ref name="SadCreation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mental_Health_on_the_Spectrum" /&gt; Whether schizoaffective disorder is a variant of schizophrenia (as in DSM-5 and ICD-10 classification systems), a variant of bipolar disorder, or part of a dimensional continuum between [[psychotic depression]], bipolar disorders and schizophrenia is currently being investigated.&lt;ref name="Mental_Health_on_the_Spectrum" /&gt;

Research into the assessment and treatment of schizoaffective disorder will rely less on [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] and [[ICD]] criteria as time progresses, and more on the [[spectrum approach|dimensional]] [[Research Domain Criteria]] currently being developed by the U.S. [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH). The Research Domain Criteria initiative, led by Bruce Cuthbert, Ph.D., of NIMH, is the inspiration for the Roadmap for Mental Health Research in Europe (ROAMER).&lt;ref name="Mental_Health_on_the_Spectrum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Future of DSM+ICD in Mental Health"&gt;{{cite news|title=No One Is Abandoning the ''DSM'', but it is Almost Time to Transform It|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/brainwaves/2013/05/07/no-one-is-rejecting-the-dsm-but-it-is-almost-time-to-transform-it/|accessdate=October 2013|newspaper=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ROAMER&gt;{{cite news|title=Roadmap for Mental Health Research in Europe|url=http://www.roamer-mh.org/|accessdate=October 2013|newspaper=ROAMER}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the Research Domain Criteria initiative is to address the marked variability and overlap within and among the disorder categories, and to foster development of more effective assessment and treatment for each individual patient.&lt;ref name="Mental_Health_on_the_Spectrum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Future of DSM+ICD in Mental Health" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ROAMER" /&gt; Over the coming decades, advances resulting from the Research Domain Criteria in the U.S. and ROAMER in Europe will be incorporated into future versions of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] and [[ICD]], with the hope of eventually leading to [[personalized medicine|personalized mental health]] of greater diagnostic accuracy and with more targeted and useful treatments, including biomedical, psychosocial, and possibly preventive approaches.&lt;ref name="Future of DSM+ICD in Mental Health" /&gt;

'''Selkup language''' is the [[language]] of the [[Selkup people|Selkups]], belonging to the [[Samoyedic languages|Samoyedic]] group of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic language family]]. It is spoken by some 1,570 people (1994 est.) in the region between the [[Ob River|Ob]] and [[Yenisei River]]s (in [[Siberia]]). The language name ''Selkup'' comes from the [[Russian language|Russian]] "{{lang|ru|cелькупский язык}}" (''selkupsky yazyk''), based on the native name used in the Taz dialect, шӧльӄумыт әты ''šöľqumyt әty'', lit. ''forest-man language''. Different [[dialect]]s use different names.

Selkup is fractured in an extensive [[dialect continuum]] whose ends are no longer [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]]. The three main varieties are the [[Taz River|Taz]] (Northern) dialect ({{lang|ru|тазовский диалект}}, ''tazovsky dialekt''), which became the basis of the Selkup [[written language]] in the 1930s, [[Tym River|Tym]] (Central) dialect ({{lang|ru|тымский диалект}}, ''tymsky dialekt''), and [[Ket River|Ket]] dialect ({{lang|ru|кетский диалект}}, ''ketsky dialekt''). It is not related to the [[Ket language]].

==Phonology==

There are 25&amp;nbsp;[[vowel]] and 16&amp;nbsp;[[consonant]] [[phoneme]]s in the Taz dialect.

* [[Voice (phonetics)|Voicing]] is not phonemic. Stops and fricatives may be voiced between vowels or after [[sonorant]] consonants.
* The palatalized stop and fricative {{IPA|/tʲ/}}, {{IPA|/sʲ/}} are most typically rendered as an alveolo-palatal [[Affricate consonant|affricate]] {{IPA|[tɕ]}} and fricative {{IPA|[ɕ]}}.
* Before [[front vowel]]s, palatalized variants of other consonants are also found.
* {{IPA|[ɴ]}} and {{IPA|[ʀ]}} are allophones of {{IPA|/q/}} when occurring before nasals and liquids, respectively.
* The non-coronal stops {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/q/}} have [[Free variation|optional]] fricative allophones {{IPA|[f]}}, {{IPA|[x]}}, {{IPA|[χ]}} when occurring before {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/sʲ/}}.

* [[Vowel length]] is phonemic. {{IPA|/ɔː/}} alone, deriving from proto-Selkup {{IPA|*/aː/}}, has no short counterpart.
* The [[tenseness]] contrast, an innovation of northern Selkup, is independent of length (e.g. {{IPA|/i/, /iː/, /ɪ/, /ɪː/}} all contrast).
* The full range of vowel quality contrasts is only possible in the initial syllable of a word: in later syllables, {{IPA|/e/ /ø/ /ɘ/ /y/ /ɨ/}} of either length do not occur, nor does long {{IPA|/uː/}}. (Shown on a darker gray background.)
* The non-phonemic lax central vowel {{IPA|[ɪ̈ ~ ə]}} only occurs in unstressed non-first syllables; it is normally treated equivalent with short tense {{IPA|/ɨ/}}.

Selkup has a syllable structure (C)V(C). Word-initial {{IPA|/ŋ/}} and word-final {{IPA|/tʲ/}} or {{IPA|/w/}} do not occur. Various [[consonant cluster]]s and [[geminate]] consonants such as {{IPA|/nt/, /rm/, /sʲsʲ/}} may occur, though many potential combinations occurring morphologically are simplified.

[[Stress (phonetics)|Stress]] in Selkup is marginally phonemic. Generally the rightmost long vowel in a word is stressed, or otherwise the first syllable, but certain suffixes with short vowels may acquire stress, leading to minimal pairs such as {{IPA|[ˈtɕɛlʲtɕalqo]}} "to stamp down" vs. {{IPA|[tɕɛlʲˈtɕalqo]}} "to stamp once".

His major break came through the film ''[[Arya (2004 film)]]'' directed by [[Sukumar (director)|Sukumar]]. Playing the role of Ajay, local MPs spoiled brat son, who is adamant and very possessive lover, gained him critical acclaim which made him a star in the Telugu film industry. Reviewer from Idlebrain.com quoted "Siva is good as adamant, at times confused, lover. He generated comedy in few scenes where he shows his frustration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idlebrain.com/movie/archive/mr-arya.html|title=Telugu cinema Review - Arya - Allu Arjun, Anuradha Mehta - Sukumar - Devi Sri Prasad - Raju|website=www.idlebrain.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewer from [[Sify.com]] wrote " Siva as Ajay is very promising."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/arya-review-telugu-13471786.html|title=Review :|website=www.sify.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by ''[[Sankranti (film)|Sankranti]]'', in which he shared screen space with actors [[Daggubati Venkatesh]] and [[Srikanth (Telugu actor)|Srikanth]].

He got 5 releases in 2006, ''[[Pothe Poni]]'', ''[[Kokila (2006 film)|Kokila]]'', ''[[Sarada Saradaga]]'', ''[[Aganthakudu]]'' and ''[[Annavaram]]''. His film ''Pothe Poni'' directed by [[Tammareddy Bharadwaja]], won Golden [[Nandi Award]], which got him Copper Nandi Award for the same. In 2007 two of his films- ''[[Pagale Vennela]]'' and  ''[[Chandamama (2007 film)|Chandamama]]'' were released. ''Chandamama'' directed by [[Pasupuleti Krishna Vamsi|Krishna Vamsi]], ''[[Navdeep]]'' was another lead and movie succeeded well at the box office and gained huge applause for him in the role of good-hearted Village boy. [[Kajal Aggarwal]], and [[Sindhu Menon]] were the heroines of the film. ''[[Target (2008 film)|Target]]'' released in 2008 and that's a wrong choice made. He did ''[[Mast (2009 film)|Mast]]'' in 2009 produced by actor [[Suresh (actor)|Suresh]]. ''[[Shambo Shiva Shambo]]'' directed by [[Samuthirakani]] was another milestone in his career released in 2010 and was a huge success. He worked with [[Ravi Teja]] and [[Allari Naresh]] in the film, while [[Priyamani]], and [[Abhinaya (actress)|Abhinaya]] were the heroines. He took up supporting roles for ''[[Janda Pai Kapiraju]]'' and ''[[Katamarayudu]]'', both of which helped him gain more fame post his commercial failures at the box office.

'''Society for the History of Discoveries''' (or '''SHD'''), founded in 1960, is an international, [[United States]]-based, organization formed to stimulate interest in teaching, research, and publishing the history of geographical [[exploration]].  Its members include those from several academic disciplines as well as archivists, non-affiliated scholars, and laypersons with an interest in history.  SHD advances its goals by organizing annual meetings at which pertinent scholarly research papers are presented, by publishing a scholarly journal with articles on geographic exploration, and by annually offering an award to student research papers in the field.  The Society is a US [[non-profit]] [[501(c)(3)]] organization administered by a voluntary and unpaid team of council members and officers.  Membership is open to all who have an interest in the history of geographical exploration.  It publishes a semiannual journal,  ''[[Terrae Incognitae (journal)|Terrae Incognitae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sochistdisc.org/about.htm About SHD].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The origin of the Society for the History of Discoveries (SHD) can be traced back to the summer of 1960 at an [[academic conference]] in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], that commemorated the quincentenery of the death of [[Prince Henry the Navigator]].  American scholars John (Jack) Parker, [[Thomas Goldstein (historian) | Thomas (Thom) Goldstein]], and Vsevolod (Steve) Slesarev, determined that there should be an organization in the United States that would encourage research into the history of exploration and discovery.  Later, in December 1960, Goldstein posted a notice at the [[New York City]] meeting of the [[American Historical Association]] inviting interested parties to meet at a nearby restaurant.  The people who attended that December 1960 luncheon constituted themselves as an executive board for a period of one year, and proceeded to organize SHD.

At the beginning of 1961, there were a total of twenty-one members in the Society.  The appeal of this newly created learned Society was wide. Because there were no barriers to qualify for membership, within a short time historians, geographers, librarians, museum curators, archivists, philosophers, mathematicians, linguists, cartographers, navigators, medical doctors, editors, book sellers, book and map collectors, and independent scholars comprised the membership.  Also, because there were no gender barriers, women scholars readily found a friendly intellectual home, and not only were they among the earliest members attracted to the new Society, they quickly assumed leadership positions.  By 2010, the organization’s membership counted over three hundred people, and numerous institutions subscribe to the Society’s journal, ''[[Terrae Incognitae (journal)|Terrae Incognitae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sochistdisc.org/shd_history.htm SHD History].&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding members established the major goals to stimulate interest in teaching, research, and publishing the history of geographical exploration. Since its inception, the scope of the Society's activities encompasses the discovery, exploration, and mapping of the earth's land and sea surface from earliest times to the present - the explorers and the explored.  Fields of specialization thus include the history of European expansion, the history of cartography, navigation, colonial settlement, biography, and bibliography.  To further its mission, the Society since 1969 has published annually a journal, ''Terrae Incognitae'', and a newsletter, which since 2000 is titled ''Terra Cognita''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sochistdisc.org/about.htm About SHD].&lt;/ref&gt;

Records of the Society are archived in Special Collections at The [[University of Texas at Arlington]] Library.

==Organization==

During most of its history, the Society was governed by three elected officers and six members of Council.  The officers were President, Vice President, and Secretary-Treasurer.  In 2006, the by-laws were changed to add another officer. Because the demands on the Secretary-Treasurer had grown, the office of Secretary-Treasurer was divided into two positions, Executive Secretary and Treasurer.  Duties are found at the Society’s Articles of Association, available via the Society website. Council meets formally at the annual meeting, and during the year via email and other technologies.

==''Terrae Incognitae'' and other publications==

The Society for the History of Discoveries determined at its 1966 annual meeting at [[West Point, New York]], to publish an annual journal.  It has become a major part of the Society’s identity, and all agree that the unpaid editor performs the Society’s most difficult and important task.  Bruce Solnick was appointed Executive Editor, and first published by Nico Israel in Amsterdam, the first volume of ''[[Terrae Incognitae (journal)|Terrae Incognitae]]'' appeared in 1969.  The [[peer-reviewed journal]] was published annually from 1969 through 2010. Beginning in 2011, the journal is published semiannually.  Past and current editors are listed at the Society website.  In addition to scholarly articles, each issue of ''Terrae Incognitae'' includes reviews of recent literature, and since 1979, an extensive bibliography of recent publications related to exploration and discovery.  Beginning in 2008 the editorial board of ''Terrae Incognitae'' extended the number of book reviews to be published in each issue.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.sochistdisc.org/terrae_incognitae/terrae-incognitae.htm Terrae Incognitae]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper by Commodore [[Pieter Verhoog]] was read by John Parker at the [[Columbus, Ohio]], annual meeting in 1980 which interested those in attendance so much that a special session on the [[Columbus landfall theories|Columbus 1492 landfall]] was scheduled at the next annual meeting in [[Athens, Georgia]].  In addition to focusing on the Columbus landfall at the meeting, John Parker and [[Louis De Vorsey]] were charged with producing a special issue dedicated to the first landfall, and it was published in 1983 as Volume 15.  It was re-published in 1985 by Wayne State University Press as a book titled ''In the Wake of Columbus: Islands and Controversy''.  One important and enduring result of the scholarship represented in Volume 15 was a highly received new translation of Columbus’ ''Diario'' by two Society members, Oliver Dunn and James Kelley, which was published to acclaim by the [[University of Oklahoma Press]] in 1991.

Beginning in 2010, ''Terrae Incognitae'' is published by Maney Publishing, an independent publisher operating internationally.  Maney produces the journal, both printed hard copies and also, in the future, an online version.  Maney will provide a full back issue archive online for institutional subscribers, and freely searchable electronic abstracts.  When Maney began publication of the journal in 2010, it announced that it would scan and make available in electronic form the back issues to the membership.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.sochistdisc.org/terrae_incognitae/terrae-incognitae.htm Terrae Incognitae]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Terra Cognita''===

Along with ''Terrae Incognitae'', the Society for the History of Discoveries also publishes an annual report each autumn, and 'Terra Cognita', a newsletter in the spring.  These documents, prepared by the Executive Secretary, include Council and business meeting minutes, election results, membership (including a directory) information, reports from committees, abstracts of papers read at the annual meeting, information on upcoming meeting sites, obituaries, various announcements of interest to members, a financial report, and one of the most popular functions, news of members. Periodically, the Society’s Articles of Association are reprinted.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.sochistdisc.org/news_letter/terra-cognita_1.htm Terra Cognita]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Annual Meetings ==

The venues of annual meeting are contingent upon invitations from universities, libraries, maritime museums, map societies, and from organizations familiar with the purpose of the Society. Since 1960, annual meetings usually are held in the Fall, but the 1989 and 1997 meetings were held in the Summer. On several occasions, the Society met jointly with the [[Hakluyt Society]], the [[North American Society for Oceanic History]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sochistdisc.org/annual-meeting-previous.htm Annual Meetings].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Somalis in Norway''' are citizens and residents of [[Norway]] who are of [[Somalis|Somali]] descent.

In 1999, the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''Udlendingsdirektoratet'', UDI) started to use blood testing on Somalis who applied for [[family reunification]] with parents, the tests showed that 1 out of 4 lied about the family ties. The tests were later changed to [[Genetic testing|DNA tests]] to verify family ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/udi-fortsetter-med-omstridt-dna-test/65752620|title=UDI fortsetter med omstridt DNA-test|date=2001-10-02|work=Dagbladet.no|access-date=2018-08-27|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leader of a Somali community organization in Norway and the [[Norwegian Medical Association]] protested the tests and wished they would be discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/udi-fortsetter-med-omstridt-dna-test/65752620|title=UDI fortsetter med omstridt DNA-test|date=2001-10-02|work=Dagbladet.no|access-date=2018-08-27|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, UDI started DNA-tests on Somali childless couples who applied for family reunification where one spouse already resided in Norway. The results showed that 40% of such pairs were siblings. As the tests became widely known, the ratio dropped to 25% and the tests were widended to migrants from other regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aftenposten.no/norge/i/l1q7A/DNA-tester-avdekket-juks-med-familiegjenforening|title=DNA-tester avdekket juks med familiegjenforening|work=Aftenposten|access-date=2018-08-27|language=nb-NO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
In 2004, Somali women had the highest nativity rate in Norway with 4.4 children per female, in contrast to 1.73 for Norwegian women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fhi.no/hn/statistikk/statistikk3/fruktbarhet-fodealder-og-helse---fa/|title=Fakta om fruktbarhet, fødealder og helse|website=Folkehelseinstituttet|language=no|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Statistics Norway]], as of 2017, there are a total 28,696 persons of Somali origin living in Norway. Of those, 12,767 individuals were born in Norway to immigrant parents.&lt;ref name="Popt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Population by immigrant category and country background|url=https://www.ssb.no/eksport/excel?key=297399|publisher=Statistics Norway|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Oslo Municipality, as of 2014, a total of 8,758 Somalia-born immigrants reside in [[Oslo]]. Of those individuals, many arrived during the 2000-2004 period (2,811 persons).&lt;ref name="Popos"&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistisk årbok for Oslo 2014 - Kapittel 1 Folkemengdens størrelse og sammensetning|url=http://statistisk-arbok.utviklings-og-kompetanseetaten.oslo.kommune.no/2014/pdf/UKE-2014-Kap01-3|publisher=Oslo Municipality|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socioeconomics==
According to Statistics Norway, as of 2012-2014, the percentage of Somalia-born immigrants in Norway with a persistently low income averaged out at 70.7%. This was a higher proportion than the native population and other immigrant groups, largely because most Somali individuals arrived as asylum immigrants, who tend to have lower incomes. The percentage of Somalia-born immigrants with a persistently low income has also steadily declined the longer that the individuals have resided in Norway, with proportions of 94.2% among 3 year Somalia-born residents, 74.7% among 4-9 year residents, and 61.6% among residents of 10 years or longer. This was relative to immigrant averages of 26.3% overall, 50.3% among 3 year residents, 28.5% among 4-9 year residents, and 20.2% among residents of 10 years or more. As of 2014, around 72% of Somalia-born immigrants have a persistently low income, with individuals born in Norway to Somali immigrants having a smaller low income percentage of approximately 65%.&lt;ref name="Popinc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Økonomi og levekår for ulike lavinntektsgrupper 2016|pages=57, 117, 118|url=https://www.ssb.no/inntekt-og-forbruk/artikler-og-publikasjoner/_attachment/281093?_ts=157f60210a8|publisher=Statistics Norway|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Municipality of Oslo|Oslo municipality]], about 50-70% of Somali males in Oslo are habitual users of [[khat]], a narcotic banned in Norway. The narcotic is expensive on the black market which is a contributing factor to destroying household economics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aftenposten.no/norge/i/x8XOX/Annenhver-somalier-tygger-khat|title=Annenhver somalier tygger khat|work=Aftenposten|access-date=2017-12-03|language=nb-NO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crime ===
According to Statistics Norway, in the 2001 to 2010-2013 period, the estimated proportion of Somalia-born perpetrators of criminal offences aged 15 and older in Norway decreased from 227 to 124 per 1000 residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kriminalitet blant innvandrere og norskfødte med innvandrerforeldre En analyse av registerdata for perioden 1992-2015|last=Synøve N.

According to a Statistics Norway report in 2017 investigating crime among immigrants in the 2010-2013 period, it was found Somalis, together with [[Iraqis in Norway|Iraqis]], Iranians and Afghans had the highest over-represented as perpetrators of crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ssb.no/sosiale-forhold-og-kriminalitet/artikler-og-publikasjoner/_attachment/332143?_ts=16035d6f0d8|title=Kriminalitet blant innvandrere og norskfødte med innvandrerforeldre En analyse av registerdata for perioden 1992-2015|last=Synøve N.

==Education==
According to Statistics Norway, as of 2016, among a total 24,651 Somalia-born immigrants aged 16 and older, 15,944 individuals had attained a below upper secondary education level, 3,709 had attained an upper secondary education level, 122 had attained a tertiary vocational education level, 1,793 had attained a higher education level of up to four years in duration, 378 had attained a higher education level of more than four years in duration, and 2,705 had no education.&lt;ref name="Poped"&gt;{{cite web|title=Level of education for immigrants 16 years and older. Country background. Numbers|url=http://www.ssb.no/eksport/excel?key=312177|publisher=Statistics Norway|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment==
According to Statistics Norway, as of 2016, Somalia-born immigrants aged 15-74 in Norway have an employment rate of approximately 32.4%.&lt;ref name="Popem"&gt;{{cite web|title=Employed immigrants (15-74 years) by country of birth and sex. 4th quarter|url=https://www.ssb.no/eksport/excel?key=302129|publisher=Statistics Norway|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2017}}, their unemployment rate was also about 7.5%.&lt;ref name="Popuem"&gt;{{cite web|title=Registered unemployed immigrants and persons participating in labour market schemes 15-74 years, by country background, years of residence, sex, contents and time|url=https://www.ssb.no/statistikkbanken/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?MainTable=ForstgenArbNye&amp;KortNavnWeb=innvarbl&amp;PLanguage=1&amp;checked=true|publisher=Statistics Norway|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistics Norway has been criticized for misrepresenting employment levels for African migrants due to employment was counted from 1 weekly hour of work. Counting full-time employment as 30 hours of work per week, 11% of women from Somalia were in full-time employment with another 10% having 1-19 hours of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nettavisen.no/na24/nye-innvandrertall-under-halvparten-er-i-full-jobb/3423547224.html|title=Nye innvandrertall: Under halvparten er i full jobb|last=Stavrum|first=Gunnar|work=Nettavisen|access-date=2018-10-27|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Nettavisen]], Somali females differ strongly in employment patterns to Polish women, where the latter are joining the workforce more rapidly, have twice as high an employment level and they stay in the workforce much longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nettavisen.no/na24/nye-innvandrertall-under-halvparten-er-i-full-jobb/3423547224.html|title=Nye innvandrertall: Under halvparten er i full jobb|last=Stavrum|first=Gunnar|work=Nettavisen|access-date=2018-10-27|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Southern Oromo''', or '''Borana''' (after one of its dialects), is a variety of [[Oromo language|Oromo]] spoken in southern [[Ethiopia]] and northern [[Kenya]] by the [[Borana people]]. Günther Schlee also notes that it is the native language of a number of related peoples, such as the [[Sakuye]].&lt;ref&gt;Schlee, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1159837 "Interethnic Clan Identities among Cushitic-Speaking Pastoralists", ''Africa''], 55 (1985),p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Dialects are Borana proper (Boran, Borena), possibly Arsi (Arussi, Arusi) and Guji (Gujji, Jemjem) in Ethiopia and, in [[Kenya]], Karayu, Salale (Selale), Gabra (Gabbra, Gebra) and possibly [[Orma language|Orma]] and [[Waata language|Waata]].

The language is locally and commonly known as ''afaan borana'' ("Borana language").

[[File:Chinese fitness dancing in Haikou People's Park.ogv|thumb|right|2012 video of Chinese women square dancing in [[People's Park (Haikou)|People's Park]], [[Haikou]]]]
In the [[People's Republic of China]], '''square dancing''' or '''plaza dancing''' ({{zh|s=广场舞|t=廣場舞|p=guǎngchǎng wǔ|l=public square dance}}), is an exercise routine performed to music in [[Urban open space|squares, plazas or parks]] of the nation's cities. It is popular with middle-aged and retired women who have been referred to as "dancing grannies"&lt;ref name="BBC blog post"&gt;{{cite news|title=China Blog: Dancing Grannies raise a ruckus|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-china-blog-25330651|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=December 12, 2013|accessdate=March 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the English-language media. Due to its low cost and ease of participation,&lt;ref name="China Daily story"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eight stories you want to know about square dance|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2014-07/24/content_17914368.htm|website=chinadaily.com.cn|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been estimated to have over 100 million practitioners, according to [[China Central Television|CCTV]], the country's official television network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hu|first1=Qingyuan|title=Dancing with danger|url=http://english.people.com.cn/90782/8455170.html|website=English.people.cn|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice has roots in both ancient and modern Chinese history. Dancing for exercise has been recorded as developed millennia ago in [[Emperor Yao]]'s China, and during the [[Culture of the Song Dynasty|Song Dynasty]] the public spaces of cities were noted for their use in performance. Most of the women who square dance came of age during the [[Cultural Revolution]], when folk dances such as ''[[yangge]]'' were widely performed, often as propaganda. Some have confirmed that this [[nostalgia]] is one of their reasons for taking part, although the benefits of the exercise and socialization opportunities also play a role.&lt;ref name="LA Times story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Makinen|first=Julie|title=
China's senior dancers and their 'red songs' would do Mao proud|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-china-dancers-20140826-story.html#page=1|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 26, 2014|accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Square dancers dance to a variety of music, mostly [[Music in China|Chinese]] popular songs, both contemporary and historic. The hobby began in the mid-1990s, as middle-aged women who had been forced into [[retirement]] began doing it to keep themselves occupied. Its popularity notwithstanding, square dancing has been the subject of considerable controversy in the 2010s China due to complaints of [[noise pollution]] in the evening or morning hours. Dancers in China's increasingly populous cities congregate in public areas because there are few dedicated facilities where they could go. Residents of nearby apartment complexes who have been disturbed by the high volume of multiple dance groups' musical accompaniment, especially late in the evening and early in the morning when they are trying to sleep, have sometimes reacted violently.&lt;ref name="NYT story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jacobs|first=Andrew|title=China Puts a Hitch in the Step of ‘Dancing Grannies’|url=http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/24/china-seeks-to-impose-its-own-routine-on-public-dancing/?ref=world|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 24, 2015|accessdate=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the Chinese government reacted to these complaints and incidents by prescribing a set of standardized routines for all dancers to follow, claiming they would be culturally unifying and healthier. The move was met with widespread criticism. Some Chinese complained that it did nothing to address the noise issues; others said the dancers should be free to choose their own routines. The real problem, yet others said, was not only the lack of better places for the dancing but the lack of other social opportunities for the women.&lt;ref name="NYT story" /&gt; The government soon clarified that the routines it created and promoted were only meant to be healthy alternatives to existing ones and were not required.&lt;ref name="World Post story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheehan|first=Matt|title=Wrath of Dancing Grandmothers Forces Chinese Government to Backtrack|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/25/china-grandmother-line-dancing_n_6938894.html|newspaper=[[Huffington Post|World Post]]|date=March 26, 2015|accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
The groups congregate in the early morning and evening, any time of year, at parks or public squares, or anywhere they can find enough space, regardless of what other use that space may nominally have, such as a [[parking lot]].&lt;ref name="BBC blog post" /&gt; Morning dancers try to avoid parks since they are preferred locations for ''[[taiji]]'', the [[martial arts]] school whose slowed-down moves are often practiced as exercise, known as ''tai chi'' in the West. They begin as early as 5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., and tend to use spaces nearer supermarkets so they are better positioned to bargain for and purchase fresh vegetables when the markets open.&lt;ref name="Tong thesis"&gt;{{Cite thesis|degree=Master of [[Landscape Architecture]]|last=Tong|first=Chen|title=Square Dancing in the Streets, Xuanhua, China|url=https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=osu1366332902&amp;disposition=inline|date=2013|publisher=[[Ohio State University]]|access-date=March 26, 2013|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the evening they tend to start dancing after dinner;&lt;ref name="NYT story" /&gt; for this reason spaces used by square dancers in the evening tend not to be too far from their homes as they also may have to tend to grandchildren they may be watching while their own children work late.&lt;ref name="Tong thesis" /&gt;

Dancers organize themselves into rank and file. The front rank comprises the most proficient dancers, the best being in the center. Each rank back from the one in front contains dancer who are less proficient. All the dancers face forward. This allows dancers to learn from those in the rows ahead. The back rank is often populated with beginners just learning the moves, while the front rows are well-coordinated.&lt;ref name="Youth Daily"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shu|first=Fang|title=能阻挡广场舞的也许只剩下台风了|trans-title=Maybe only a typhoon can stop square dancers|newspaper=Youth Times|url=http://www.qnsb.com/fzepaper/site1/qnsb/html/2013-10/10/content_457070.htm|location=[[Yan'an]]|date=October 10, 2013|accessdate=March 27, 2015|quote=”这是《武林旧事》里记录的节日街头的场景，南宋临安市民就喜欢在街头看跳舞，不过那些舞者个个都是专业范儿，跳的是美感。}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some groups have gotten large, as many as 80 members in some cases. Leaders of these large groups charge a small fee to regular attendees to support the use of the electronics. It is reported as being either {{CNY|link=yes|5}} per month or ¥20 annually. One group in [[Changsha]], however, was said to charge twice that.&lt;ref name="Weekly Times story cost"&gt;Zhao, 费用有每人每年20元的，也有每人每月5元的，视各领舞老师的意愿而定，但总体来说，“费用是很少的”。... 在长沙，一般需要缴纳的费用在每人每年40元左右。&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups sometimes split if one experienced dancer feels she can lead a group of her own, especially if there are dancers dissatisfied with the current leaders' interpretation of the songs. Groups that form by such splits often consider themselves in competition. These can take the nature of friendly, organized events,&lt;ref name="Weekly Times story competition"&gt;Zhao, "据曹露向时代周报记者描述，一位湖南师范大学的退休女教师，先是参加了学校附近的“广场舞”团体，熟练后感到“舞蹈节奏太慢，更新的速度也不太频繁”，随后带着队伍里的一些成员重新成立了自己的团队，从网上看视频学习舞蹈，甚至到外地“取经”，自此以每周教学一支新舞的速度，迅速将原先的队伍比了下去。"&lt;/ref&gt; or more serious competition for the best spaces available and the loudest sound.&lt;ref name="LA Times story" /&gt;

Apparel varies greatly. Many groups' members show up in street clothes or exercise clothing similar to that worn for [[aerobics]] or [[Yoga as exercise or alternative medicine|yoga]] in the West. More advanced groups sometimes wear costumes and use props. ''The New York Times'' reported seeing one group in green fatigues, dancing to songs from the [[Korean War]] era.&lt;ref name="NYT story" /&gt; A Beijing group attracted international attention in summer of 2014 for performing Cultural Revolution-era songs like "[[Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China]]" outside a local shopping mall every night, wearing military uniforms and using toy guns as props.&lt;ref name="LA Times story" /&gt;

The music is usually broadcast from a portable CD player and amplifier on wheels, powered by a large vehicle battery. Accompaniment varies. Some groups dance to Western pop or even [[waltz]]es, but most choose Chinese popular songs with a dance beat, such as the 2014 hit "[[Little Apple (song)|Little Apple]]",&lt;ref name="World Post story" /&gt; or older hits from the 1950s, often with propagandist lyrics. Some dances are complicated and demanding, but the majority are low-impact routines that primarily consist of holding the dancer's arms in front of the body in varied positions. For this reason they are often referred to derisively as "zombie dances."&lt;ref name="NYT story" /&gt;

==Perceived benefits==
[[File:Mass dancing at Haidian Northern Cultural Center (20170624195153).jpg|thumb|A mixed-age group of square dancers in Beijing, June 2017]]
"It's good for my health to be able to come out and exercise," a retiree told the ''Los Angeles Times''. "I used to be quick to lose my temper, but now nothing bothers me," a similarly aged retired paper mill worker explained to ''The New York Times'' about the effect square dancing had had on her. "When I dance, I forget all my cares. And I can also hike up mountains with little effort."&lt;ref name="NYT story" /&gt;

A recent survey found that Shanghai residents have more tolerance for square dancing. According to the report, 75% of residents supported the group dancing, and 73% of young residents supported it. Beyond that, most residents said they thought ''guangchangwu'' is good for health, both mental and physical &amp;ndash; 62% saw regular dancing as exercise and recreation, and 61% believed it helps elderly people expand their social circles and dispel loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wang|first1=Hongyi|title=Shanghai residents 'support' square dancers|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2014-07/18/content_17830503.htm|website=Chinadaily.com|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Dance as a form of exercise has a long history in China. The ''[[Lüshi Chunqiu]]'', an encyclopedia compiled in the third century B.C.E., during the [[Spring and Autumn period]], describes how, two millennia earlier in the time of [[Emperor Yao]], people began to dance slowly in order to reinvigorate their muscles after lengthy rains had kept them indoors, sometimes leading to joint diseases. Eventually they began dressing up in costumes and using props. "As time passed, they discovered that some activities could promote appetite, strengthen muscles and bones, and get rid of fatigue," writes one historian of [[Chinese traditional medicine]]. "Over a longer period of time, these activities became arranged in rhythms and movements which were harmonious and graceful—now they had dancing." While these may have eventually evolved into modern breathing exercises,&lt;ref name="History of traditional medicine"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F5qDqKBsrLwC&amp;pg=PA8 |title=History and Development of Traditional Chinese Medicine |author= Zhen'guo Wang, Peiping Xie |editor=Ping Chen|page=8 |publisher=IOS Press |year= 1997 |isbn=978-9051993240 }}&lt;/ref&gt; other commentators suggest a public aspect to such dancing analogous to modern square dancing may have been refined in later eras, such as the religious dances of the [[Warring States period]] that preceded the rise of [[Imperial China]]. A writer in ''Youth Times'' sees it as similar to public dancing in the [[Song Dynasty]] of the late first millennium C.E.&lt;ref name="Youth Daily" /&gt;

Chen Tong, a graduate student in [[landscape architecture]] at [[Ohio State University]], traces the origins of modern square dancing to the [[Cultural Revolution]] that swept China during the 1960s and early '70s, in the broader context of [[Urbanization in China|the country's urbanization]]. In 1949, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) won the [[Chinese Civil War]] and established the [[People's Republic of China]]. A decade later, CPC chairman [[Mao Zedong]] began the [[Great Leap Forward]] [[economic development]] initiative to accelerate [[Chinese industrialization#Industrialization of the People's Republic of China|industrialize]] the [[Economy of the People's Republic of China|Chinese economy]]. At the time most Chinese still lived in rural areas, as they had for centuries. Some had already moved to cities to take industrial jobs, but to better realize the aspirations of the Great Leap Forward, many of them moved or were forcibly relocated.&lt;ref name="Tong 19–20"&gt;Tong, 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cities during the Great Leap, there was an emphasis on collective use of public space even for activities that had usually taken place in the home. For example, entire neighborhoods were required to eat their dinner in public dining halls.&lt;ref name="Tong 19–20" /&gt; Ultimately, the Great Leap Forward proved disastrous, failing to industrialize effectively and causing [[famine]] due to labor shortages on farms. In 1962, the government began allowing people to move back to farms.&lt;ref name="Tong 15–16"&gt;Tong, 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterward, the [[Cultural Revolution]] began. Organized youth styling themselves the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] revolted against both Chinese traditions and official [[Ideology of the Communist Party of China|Chinese communism]], preferring the purity of [[Maoism]]. Since urban intellectuals' thought was believed to have been tainted by awareness or memory of [[capitalism]], many were [[Down to the Countryside Movement|sent to rural areas to live]], work and be properly re-educated through review of Mao's writings.&lt;ref name="SCMP 2014 article"&gt;{{cite news|last=He|first=Huifeng|title=The dancing damas: China's 'square dancers' take society by storm|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1663571/chinas-square-dancers-take-society-storm-their-loud-music-and|newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=December 18, 2014|accessdate=March 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, too, caused great hardship and economic disruption.&lt;ref name="Tong 19–20" /&gt;
[[File:Binus Operet 24-10-2009 Yangge.JPG|thumb|left|''Yangge'' dancers|alt=Six women in red gowns with white trim on a wooden floor against a white background performing a dance]]
In the rural areas they were relocated to, the urbanites first encountered the ''[[yangge]]'' [[folk dance]], very popular in rural areas, particularly in northern China. Originally performed to mark important agricultural occasions, ''yangge'' had been adapted by the CPC for its own uses as a [[propaganda]] tool. Performances often helped relieve tensions between the party and the peasantry during times when food was scarce, although during the more repressive period of the Cultural Revolution, ''yangge'' was itself banned along with many other traditional forms of expression.&lt;ref name="Tong thesis" /&gt;

The Cultural Revolution ended with Mao's death in 1976. Following the arrest and trial of the [[Gang of Four]], including Mao's widow, for perpetrating it, [[Deng Xiaoping]] took over as CPC chairman and instituted a [[Chinese economic reform|program of economic reform]] which continues as "[[socialism with Chinese characteristics]]". The pace of urbanization picked up again afterwards. As younger Chinese moved from farms to cities, found jobs and started families, their parents often moved in with them to better supervise their grandchildren.&lt;ref name="World Post story" /&gt;

Foreign dance trends, such as [[ballroom dancing|ballroom]], which had been suppressed during the Cultural Revolution, returned.&lt;ref name="Youth Daily" /&gt; Women who had experienced the brunt of the Cultural Revolution and its dislocations in their teens and young adulthood, including the exposure to and participation in ''yangge'' performances,&lt;ref name="BBC blog post" /&gt; began to reach mandatory retirement age in the mid-1990s, or were laid off from state-run enterprises following [[privatization]].&lt;ref name="SCMP 2014 article" /&gt; Some also began experiencing marital stress as husbands began having [[extramarital affair]]s with younger women, left home for long periods of time to work elsewhere, or both.&lt;ref name="Qianni Wang paper"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wang|first=Qianni|title=Public Dance: A Sociality Invented in Individualizing China|url=https://www.academia.edu/6003194/Public_Dance_A_Sociality_Invented_in_Individualizing_China|publisher=[[Academia.edu]]|date=February 9, 2014|accessdate=March 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They returned to dance as a way to stay fit, relieve boredom and socialize.&lt;ref name="Tong thesis" /&gt;

Some dancers themselves make this historical connection. "When I do the dances, it reminds me of my younger years when I was doing similar dances during the Cultural Revolution," a retired driver in her mid-60s told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 2014. "I feel the same kind of spirit and emotions." Another woman, whose troupe used the "red songs" written during that era, was more political. "The[y] can always remind us what the Chinese leaders did for us to have a good life today and how they fought hard for the ordinary people in China."&lt;ref name="LA Times story" /&gt;

The cities they were living in, however, lacked sufficient space for such activities. Chinese [[urban planning|urban planners]] had prioritized commerce and industry, often demolishing older neighborhoods with small houses and replacing them with large [[high-rise]] apartment complexes, increasing [[population density]]. Streets were widened to accommodate automobile traffic, driving many activities that had once taken place there elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Tong 21"&gt;Tong, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there were parks, there were severe shortages of [[urban open space]], especially in rapidly growing cities. The small city of [[Xuanhua District|Xuanhua]] northwest of [[Beijing]] had, as of 2013, a mere {{convert|1.2|m2}} of open space per resident, far below the {{convert|9|m2|sqft|adj=on}} suggested by the [[World Health Organization]], as compared with {{convert|11.2|m2}} per resident in Beijing and {{convert|20|m2}} in [[New York City|New York]] or {{convert|90|m2}} in [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref name="Tong 27–28"&gt;Tong, 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, they joined older Chinese in practicing ''taiji'', the slow [[martial arts]] school known in the West as ''[[tai chi]]'', and the newer practices of [[Falun Gong]].&lt;ref name="SCMP 2014 article" /&gt; ''Tai chi'''s philosophy strongly encourages its practice in parks, closer to nature, and space there was scarce.&lt;ref name="Tong 19–20" /&gt; Falun Gong was outlawed by the government in 1999, eliminating that option for exercise. So, the women, referred to as ''dàmā''s ({{zh|s=大妈|t=大媽|l=great mothers}}), often rendered in the English press as "grannies", began finding their own spaces to dance in the way they had in their youth.&lt;ref name="SCMP 2014 article" /&gt;

The ''dama''s ranks continued to grow along with China's cities. By 2008 half of the country's population was living in an urban environment.&lt;ref name="Tong thesis" /&gt; That year they received unintentional official encouragement when the government promoted fitness all over the country in anticipation of [[2008 Summer Olympic Games|that year's Olympics]] in Beijing.&lt;ref name="SCMP 2014 article" /&gt;

==Conflicts and controversy==

In the 2010s square dancing began to draw notice both in China and abroad. A [[Jiangsu]] TV network sponsored a contest, drawing participants from seven cities. Its successful broadcast drew more participants into the squares and plazas.&lt;ref name="Zhao contests"&gt;Zhao, "江苏卫视在去年推出了大型公益健身类节目《最炫民族风》，镜头对准的是全国1.8亿老人。 该节目在全国七大城市进行了招募，在众多“广场舞”群体中引起巨大反响，奖金更是高达上百万。"&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the Chopstick Brothers featured square dancers in the [[music video|video]] for their hit song "[[Little Apple (song)|Little Apple]]"; the dancers returned the favor by making it a popular tune for their routines.&lt;ref name="World Post story" /&gt;

However, square dancers also came into conflict with residents of the areas that surrounded their preferred spaces. Many were younger workers who complained that this noise pollution kept them or their families from getting needed rest, especially if different groups of dancers began turning their music up to compete with each other. "One man bouncing his infant daughter says he fears the first words she will speak are the saccharine lyrics that waft in daily through the walls and windows," the [[BBC]] reported in 2013. The dancers also drew complaints that they blocked building entrances, sidewalks or [[parking lot]]s.&lt;ref name="BBC blog post" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yin|first1=Leo|title=Square dancers facing a dilemma|url=http://www.womenofchina.cn/womenofchina/html1/opinion/16/9160-1.htm|website=Women of China|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annoyed residents have sometimes taken it upon themselves to quiet the dancers' din. In [[Wenzhou]], one group pooled the equivalent of US$40,000 to purchase a sound system of their own loudly reminding dancers to comply with Chinese [[noise pollution]] laws. [[Wuhan]] residents threw human excrement on dancers from the tops of their neighboring towers. In a 2013 incident that gained national attention, a man in Beijing's outlying [[Changping District]] was arrested after he fired a [[shotgun]] in the air and set his three [[Tibetan Mastiff]]s on a nearby group of dancers.&lt;ref name="LA Times story" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT story" /&gt;
[[File:Dancing Grannies in the public square.jpeg|thumb|right|Large dance in a public square]]
Altercations have arisen among the dancers themselves. In [[Qingyuan]], two groups of rival dancers allegedly came to blows when they tried to share a small space at a local park. A court ordered one group to pay the other's medical costs.&lt;ref name="LA Times story" /&gt;

Dancers have also taken their dances overseas. A dance on Moscow's [[Red Square]] provided no incident, but other square dancers have not been so lucky in other countries (similarly, Russians visiting cities in [[Manchuria]] have joined in the square dances). Two mainland Chinese women visiting [[Taipei]] decided to do their dance in the hotel lobby, attracting attention from guests there and causing friction with hotel management.&lt;ref name="China Daily story" /&gt; A group dancing in [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]], home of one of the earliest [[Chinatowns in Brooklyn|Chinatowns]] in the [[New York City]] borough of [[Brooklyn]], made headlines in August 2014 when its leader was arrested for violating a city [[Local ordinance|ordinance]] forbidding sounds over 45 [[decibel]]s; the charge was later dropped.&lt;ref name="NYT story" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dancing Grannies raise a ruckus|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-china-blog-25330651|website=BBC.com|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Square dancers' response to clashes with residents over noise has been mixed. While one group of dancers in [[Xi'an]]'s [[Weiyang District, Xi'an|Weiyang District]] voluntarily agreed to limit its routines to certain times and noise levels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Chinese damas' vow to say no to noise of square dance|url=http://english.people.com.cn/n/2014/0725/c98649-8760550-2.html|website=English.people.cn|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; others have been more defiant. "The louder the music, the more fun it is," one dancer told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2015.&lt;ref name="NYT story" /&gt; Song Jiahong, a humanities professor at [[Yunnan University]], says this apparent insensitivity to loud noise is another effect of the Cultural Revolution, when propaganda read over loudspeakers was a constant feature of daily Chinese life. "The intimate memories of the loudspeakers are lodged deep in the subconscious of the old [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]]," he wrote. "They have no concept that this can actually annoy others."&lt;ref name="LA Times story" /&gt;

But other analysts wrote that the problem went deeper than that. Tong writes: 
{{quote|As square dancing continues to flourish in the urban environment, the dancing activity happening on found and loosened space (urban public space temporarily appropriated by residents to meet their needs) reveals the tension between how the modern city is imagined and constructed, and how the real city is remade and lived in by common people, especially our elderly square dancers.&lt;ref name="Tong 34"&gt;Tong, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
As a remedy that his home city of [[Xuanhua District|Xuanhua]] could implement, he suggested closing off lanes of less busy streets in the neighborhoods favored by square dancers to create temporary pedestrian space. He estimated that this could provide up to {{convert|8.8|m2}} per dancer in the city.&lt;ref name="Tong 36–43"&gt;Tong, 36–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 government response===

In March 2015 two government agencies, the [[State General Administration of Sports]] and the [[Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Culture]], announced the development of 12 model square dancing routines it had hired and trained instructors to introduce around the country.&lt;ref name="12 routines press release"&gt;{{cite press release|date= |title=全国广场健身操舞活动 推出12套广场舞 |trans-title=12 National Square-Dancing Aerobics Routines Introduced |url=http://www.sport.gov.cn/n16/n2061573/n2760828/6285558.html |language=Chinese |location=Beijing|agency=[[State General Administration of Sports]]|access-date=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Dancing in public squares represents the collective aspect of Chinese culture, but now it seems that the overenthusiasm of participants has dealt it a harmful blow with disputes over noise and venues," explained Liu Guoyong, director of General Administration of Sports' public fitness department. "So we have to guide it with national standards and regulations." [[Xinhua]], the government's press agency, explained that the new routines would help make square dancing "a nationally unified, scientifically crafted new activity that brings positive energy to the people."&lt;ref name="NYT story" /&gt; The announcement was accompanied by a video set to "[[Little Apple (song)|Little Apple]]" demonstrating one of the new routines.&lt;ref name="World Post story" /&gt;

Despite the tension between square dancers and residents of the areas they danced in, most Chinese opposed the move and supported the square dancers' right to choose their own music and dances. "This isn't a business," one dancer told the ''Times''. "Dancing is free and voluntary, so why does the government need to get involved?" Their disapproval was echoed in some of the country's media. "What the grannies need are venues, not regulated routines," said RedNet, an online news portal. "Only an increase of public sports venues can satisfy urban and rural residents' need for fitness routines such as football and square-dancing, and lessen the phenomenon where square-dancing disturbs residents and takes up all the parks and public spaces." In [[Shanghai]], the ''[[Xinmin Evening News]]'' pointed out that "The biggest tragedy is not the square dance by grannies, but the fact that grannies have nothing else to do than square-dance."&lt;ref name="NYT story" /&gt;

Other commentators expressed more practical concerns, such as whether the higher-impact routines were ideal for older women. "Who pays the medical bills if the grannies hurt themselves doing these?", asked one person on a [[CCTV]] [[social media]] site. Wang Guangcheng, the [[fitness trainer]] who developed the routines, said that concern was misplaced. None of the groups of dancers he tested them on had any complaints, he said. "Some even asked that the moves be more complicated."&lt;ref name="NYT story" /&gt;

Shortly afterwards, officials stated that the new routines were not meant to be the only ones permitted, contrary to what the original announcement had stated. "We saw that some people on the Internet were worried that the new regulations meant all over China people would only be allowed to dance these twelve routines," said Liu. "Of course that's impossible. It's a misunderstanding." Many Chinese took this to be a tacit admission that the hostile reaction to the routines, and the sheer number of square dancers, meant that government realized it would be impossible to displace existing square-dance routines with its own.&lt;ref name="World Post story" /&gt;

Wang had earlier clarified that he designed the routines to provide fuller exercise than the ones he saw on the streets. His routines were designed to involve the entire body, and incorporate dance moves from styles the Chinese public was not yet widely familiar with such as [[salsa (dance)|salsa]] and the [[Zumba]] fitness routine. He hoped that the more intense routines would widen the demographic of square dancers. "I want to see more young people dancing in public squares."&lt;ref name="NYT story" /&gt;

The novel takes place in three of six metaphysical Zones that encircle the planet Shikasta (an allegorical [[Earth]]), and concerns two ordained marriages that link the [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] Zone Four with the [[Matriarchy|matriarchal]] Zone Three, and the [[tribe|tribal]] Zone Five. The story is told from the point of view of the matriarchal utopian Zone Three, and is about gender conflict and the breaking down of barriers between the sexes. Lessing called the ''Canopus in Argos'' series "space fiction", but ''The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five'' is generally referred to as [[feminist science fiction]].

The novel is influenced by [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[mysticism|mystical]] themes in [[Sufism]], an [[Islam]]ic belief system in which Lessing had taken an interest in the mid-1960s. The zones are said to correspond to Sufism's different levels of consciousness, and symbolise the "Sufi ladder to enlightenment".{{sfn|Galin|1997|p=140}} Lessing was criticised for abandoning her traditional fiction and switching to science fiction in her ''Canopus in Argos'' series. Notwithstanding this criticism, ''The Marriages'' was generally well received by critics, with some reviewers calling it one of Lessing's best works on the topic of gender conflict.

''The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five'' was adapted as an opera by composer [[Philip Glass]] with [[Libretto|story-libretto]] by Lessing, and premiered in German in [[Heidelberg]], Germany in May 1997. The United States premiere in English was performed in Chicago in June 2001. These productions were not very well received by theatre critics.

==Zones==
In the opening book of the ''[[Canopus in Argos]]'' series, ''[[Shikasta]]'', Lessing introduced six metaphysical Zones (akin to [[Plane (esotericism)|cosmological planes]]) that encircle the planet Shikasta (an allegorical [[Earth]]{{#tag:ref|In ''[[Shikasta]]'', Lessing does not state explicitly that the planet is Earth, but many critics believe that its similarities to Earth's history make it clear that Shikasta ''is'' Earth as seen by the Canopeans.{{sfn|Dixson|1990|p=17}}&lt;ref name=Stade/&gt;&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt; Other critics, however, interpret Shikasta as an allegorical Earth with parallel histories that deviate from time to time.{{sfn|Shinn|1986|p=111}}&lt;ref name=Hazelton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt;|group="nb"|name=Earth}}).{{sfn|Lessing|1994a|p=16}} These Zones, numbered One to Six, each represent different levels of spiritual being.{{sfn|Lessing|1994a|p=16}} ''Shikasta'' only deals with Zone Six, the innermost and least pure of the Zones, which one commentator described as "a kind of [[purgatory]] in which humans wait out the time between [[incarnation]]s on earth".{{sfn|Glover|2007|p=129}} Adjacent Zones in the numerical sequence border each other, from Zone Six (the lowest) up to Zone One (the highest and purest), each with a terrain more mountainous than the previous.{{sfn|Glover|2007|p=129}}{{sfn|Friedman|1986|pp=460–461}}

Three of the Zones in this spiritual landscape feature in ''The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five'', which Lessing describes as self-contained "countries", each with their own "societies".{{sfn|Glover|2007|p=129}}{{sfn|Friedman|1986|pp=460–461}} Zone Two, highest in the spiritual hierarchy, is located high in the mountains at the edge of Zone Three, which in turn occupies the hills bordering the lowlands of Zone Four, which is adjacent to the flat desert terrain of Zone Five.{{sfn|Friedman|1986|pp=460–461}}

==Plot==
The story opens when the Providers, the invisible and unidentified rulers of all the Zones,{{#tag:ref|Lessing does not identify the Providers, but some reviewers and critics have assumed that they are the Canopeans in ''[[Shikasta]]''.{{sfn|Glover|2007|p=128}}&lt;ref name=Sheets/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirkus/&gt;{{sfn|Bloom|2003|p=177}}|group="nb"|name=Providers}} order Al•Ith, queen of the peaceful paradise of Zone Three, to marry Ben Ata, king of the militarised and repressive Zone Four. Al•Ith is repulsed by the idea of consorting with a barbarian, and Ben Ata does not want a righteous queen disturbing his military campaigns. Nevertheless, Al•Ith descends to Zone Four and they reluctantly marry. Ben Ata is not used to the company of women he cannot control, and Al•Ith has difficulty relating to this ill-bred man, but in time they grow accustomed to each other and gain new insights into each other's Zones. Al•Ith is appalled that all of Zone Four's wealth goes into its huge armies, leaving the rest of its population poor and underdeveloped; Ben Ata is astounded that Zone Three has no army at all.

The marriage bears a son, Arusi, future [[Inheritance|heir]] to the two Zones. Some of the women of Zone Four, led by Dabeeb, step in to help Al•Ith. Suppressed and downtrodden, these women relish being in the presence of the queen of Zone Three. But soon after the birth of Arusi, the Providers order Al•Ith to return to Zone Three without her son, and Ben Ata to marry Vahshi, queen of the primitive Zone Five. Al•Ith and Ben Ata have grown fond of each other, and are devastated by this news.

Back in Zone Three, Al•Ith finds that her people have forgotten her, and her sister, Murti• has taken over as queen. Disturbed by the changes she sees in Al•Ith, Murti• exiles her to the frontier of Zone Two. Al•Ith, drawn by its allure, tries to enter Zone Two, but finds an unworldly and inhospitable place and is told by invisible people that it is not her time yet. At the frontier of Zone Five, Ben Ata reluctantly marries Vahshi, a tribal leader of a band of [[nomad]]s who terrorise the inhabitants of her zone. But Ben Ata's marriage to Al•Ith has changed him, and he disbands most of his armies in Zone Four, sending the soldiers home to rebuild their towns and villages and uplift their communities. He also slowly wins over Vahshi's confidence and persuades her to stop plundering Zone Five.

When Arusi is old enough to travel, Dabeeb and her band of women decide to take him to Zone Three to see Al•Ith. This cross-border excursion is not ordered by the Providers, and Ben Ata has grave misgivings about their decision. In Zone Three the women are shocked to find the deposed Al•Ith working in a [[stable]] near Zone Two. While Al•Ith is pleased to see her son, she too has misgivings about Dabeeb's action. The bumptious women's travels through Zone Three evoke feelings of [[xenophobia]] in the locals.

After five years of silence, the Providers instruct Ben Ata to go and see Al•Ith in Zone Three. At the border, he is surprised to find a band of youths armed with crude makeshift weapons blocking his way. Clearly they want no more incursions from Zone Four. Ben Ata returns with a large army and enters Zone Three unchallenged. He is not well received, but finds Al•Ith with a small band of followers who have moved to the frontier of Zone Two to be close to her. Ben Ata and Al•Ith reunite; he tells her of the reforms he has introduced in Zone Four and his taming of the "wild one" from Zone Five.

One day Al•Ith enters Zone Two and does not return. But the changes set in motion by the two marriages are now evident everywhere. The frontiers between Zones Three, Four and Five are open, and people and knowledge are flowing between them. Previously stagnant, the three Zones are now filled with enquiry, inspiration and renewal.

==Background==
[[File:Doris Lessing 3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Doris Lessing speaking at a [[Cologne]] literature festival in Germany, 2006|alt=A head-and-shoulders photograph of an elderly woman]]

When Lessing published ''[[Shikasta]]'' in 1979, the first book in her ''[[Canopus in Argos]]'' series, it represented a major shift of focus for the author. In her earlier books, Lessing had established a name for herself as a writer of realistic fiction;&lt;ref name=Stade/&gt; in ''Shikasta'' she introduced her readers to the [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[mysticism|mystical]] themes in [[Sufism]].&lt;ref name=Perrakis/&gt; In the mid-1960s Lessing had become interested in Sufism, an [[Islam]]ic belief system, after reading ''[[The Sufis]]'' by [[Idries Shah]]. She described ''The Sufis'' as "the most surprising book [she] had read", stating that it "changed [her] life".&lt;ref name=Lessingon/&gt; Lessing later met Shah, who became "a good friend [and] teacher".&lt;ref name=Lessingon/&gt; In the early 1970s Lessing began writing inner space fiction, which included the novels ''Briefing for a Descent into Hell'' (1971) and ''[[Memoirs of a Survivor]]'' (1974),&lt;ref name=NobelPrize-bio/&gt; and in the late 1970s she turned to science fiction when she wrote ''Shikasta'', in which she used many [[Sufism|Sufi]] concepts.&lt;ref name=NobelPrize-bio/&gt;

Lessing said that ideas for ''The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five'' had been with her for about ten years, but she "couldn't think of a way to do it".{{sfn|Rountree|2008|p=66}} It was only when she was halfway through ''Shikasta'' that she realised that she had "created a marvelous format" that she could use for other books, and it was this format, ''Canopus in Argos'', that made ''The Marriages'' possible.{{sfn|Gray|Lessing|1986|pp=337–338}} ''Shikasta'' was originally intended to be a single self-contained book, but Lessing's [[fictional universe]] developed, and she ended up writing a [[Canopus in Argos|series of five]].{{sfn|Lessing|1994a|loc="Some Remarks", p. 8}}

Lessing's switch to science fiction was not well received by readers and critics.&lt;ref name=Hazelton/&gt; By the late 1970s Lessing was considered "one of the most honest, intelligent and engaged writers of the day",&lt;ref name=Hazelton/&gt; and [[Western culture|Western]] readers unfamiliar with Sufism were dismayed that Lessing had abandoned her "rational worldview".{{sfn|Galin|1997|p=21}} George Stade of ''[[The New York Times]]'' complained that "our Grand Mistress of lumpen realism has gone religious on us".&lt;ref name=Stade/&gt; Reaction to the first two books in the series, ''Shikasta'' and ''The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five'', prompted Lessing to write in the Preface to the third book in the series, ''[[The Sirian Experiments]]'' (1980):

[[File:Idries Shah.gif|thumb|right|upright|[[Idries Shah]], who introduced Lessing to [[Sufism]]&lt;ref name=Lessingon/&gt;|alt=A head-and-shoulders black and white drawing of an elderly man]]

{{quote|I would so like it if reviewers and readers could see this series, ''Canopus in Argos: Archive'', as a framework that enables me to tell (I hope) a beguiling tale or two; to put questions, both to myself and to others; to explore ideas and sociological possibilities.{{sfn|Lessing|1994c|loc="Preface", p. 11}}}}

Further criticism of the ''Canopus'' series followed, which included this comment by ''New York Times'' critic [[John Leonard (critic)|John Leonard]]: "One of the many sins for which the 20th century will be held accountable is that it has discouraged Mrs. Lessing&amp;nbsp;... She now propagandizes on behalf of our insignificance in the cosmic razzmatazz."&lt;ref name=Leonard-Representative/&gt; Lessing replied by saying: "What they didn't realize was that in science fiction is some of the best [[social science fiction|social fiction]] of our time. I also admire the classic sort of science fiction, like ''[[Blood Music (novel)|Blood Music]]'', by [[Greg Bear]]. He's a great writer."&lt;ref name=Blume/&gt; Lessing said in 1983 that she would like to write stories about [[Red dwarf|red]] and [[White dwarf|white dwarves]], space rockets powered by [[anti-gravity]], and charmed and coloured [[quark]]s, "[b]ut we can't all be [[physicist]]s".&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt;

Lessing considered ''Marriages'' one of her better books, and said, "this book goes down into me pretty deep&amp;nbsp;... it will never happen again".&lt;ref name=Sperlinger/&gt; In an interview published in 1996, Lessing spoke passionately of the novel:

{{quote|Something happened when I wrote the book. I hit some other level. And is it a legend or a myth or a fairy tale or a fantasy? That isn't the word for what I’ve written, I think. You see, only I could have written ''[[The Golden Notebook]]'', but I think Anon wrote this other book.{{sfn|Lessing|1996|p=92}}}}

==Genre and themes==
''The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five'' is told largely from the point of view of the [[Matriarchy|matriarchal]] [[utopia]]n Zone Three, which places the novel in the category of [[Feminism|feminist]] utopias{{sfn|Glover|2007|p=128}} or [[feminist science fiction]].&lt;ref name=feministSF/&gt; The ''Canopus in Argos'' series in general falls under the banner of [[soft science fiction]], or "space fiction" as Lessing called it,{{sfn|Lessing|1994a|loc="Some Remarks", p. 8}} due to its focus on characterisation and social and cultural issues, and the de-emphasis of science and technology. [[Comparative literature]] professor [[Robert Alter]] suggested that this kind of writing belongs to a genre that [[literary criticism|literary critic]] [[Northrop Frye]] called the "anatomy", which is "a combination of fantasy and morality".&lt;ref name=Alter/&gt; Author [[Gore Vidal]] placed Lessing's science fiction between [[John Milton]] and [[L. Ron Hubbard]]".&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt; American screenwriter and film director [[Frank Pierson]] called Lessing's science fiction "mythic tale[s]" that are closer to [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]]'' and [[Frank Herbert|Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' than works by [[Arthur C. Clarke|Clarke]] and [[Isaac Asimov|Asimov]].&lt;ref name=Pierson/&gt; British writer [[Graham Sleight]] said ''The Marriages'' comes closest to [[Ursula K. Le Guin|Ursula Le Guin]]'s works in the way that both Lessing and Le Guin scrutinise societies. Sleight compared ''The Marriages'' to Le Guin's science fiction novel ''[[The Dispossessed]]'' (1974), saying that each revolves around conflicts between differing worldviews, namely the Zones in ''The Marriages'', and Anarres and Urras in ''The Dispossessed''.&lt;ref name=Sleight/&gt;

''The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five'' differs from the other books in the ''Canopus in Argos'' series in that it reads like a fable and is set in a metaphysical, or "psychic" space, outside the rest of the series' "normal" space/time universe.&lt;ref name=Glover2006/&gt;{{sfn|Shinn|1986|p=111}} The story concerns two ordained marriages that link the [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] and [[Militarism|militaristic]] Zone Four with the matriarchal and [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] Zone Three, and the [[tribe|tribal]] and [[Barbarian|barbaric]] Zone Five.&lt;ref name=Sheets/&gt; It focuses on, what ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reviewer Paul Gray calls, the "struggles between men and women and the dimensions of sex and love".&lt;ref name=Gray-Marriages/&gt; Literary critic Diana Sheets says that the book is about overcoming gender differences and opening up new possibilities. She argues that the premise of the story is that "cosmic order is ideally realized when men and women cross the gender divide and attempt genuine communication—sexually, emotionally&amp;nbsp;... thereby setting the preconditions for the attainment of enlightened consciousness."&lt;ref name=Sheets/&gt;

The marriages were ordained by the Providers because the zones had stagnated and the birth rate of both humans and animals had fallen.&lt;ref name=Gray-Marriages/&gt; Author Thelma J. Shinn says that, as in ''Shikasta'', Lessing's "pessimistic view of human capabilities still keeps control in a benevolent power rather than in the hands of the individual".{{sfn|Shinn|1986|p=112}} But after a push in the right direction, the individual triumphs: Al•Ith and Ben Ata initiate changes in both their own and their neighbouring zones.{{sfn|Shinn|1986|p=113}}

Literature academic Jayne Ashleigh Glover says that while Zone Three on the surface appears to be a feminist utopia, Lessing shows that it is far from idyllic. The story narrators, the Chroniclers of Zone Three, question their zone's behaviour and attitudes, and warn of the dangers of stagnation.{{sfn|Glover|2007|p=134}} Al•Ith, upon returning to Zone Three, is shunned by its inhabitants for failing to attend to their zone's needs,{{sfn|Glover|2007|p=135}} and Zone Three's stasis manifests itself in xenophobia when Al•Ith brings back new perspectives, followed by visitors from Zone Four.{{sfn|Glover|2007|p=136}}

Glover sees Al•Ith, Ben Ata and Vahshi as allegories for their respective zones, and the marriages between them as marriages between the zones, as stated by the title of the book.{{sfn|Glover|2007|p=129}} Author Müge Galin says that Al•Ith functions according to the nature of Zone Three rather than as an individual.{{sfn|Galin|1997|p=132}} Galin also argues that the six zones correspond to Sufism's different levels of consciousness. Both Al•Ith and Ben Ata are able to experience other levels of consciousness when they travel to each other's zones, but Al•Ith can perceive and experience the neighbouring zone far deeper than Ben Ata because she is from a higher zone/level of consciousness.{{sfn|Galin|1997|p=131}} Galin says that on the "Sufi ladder to enlightenment",{{sfn|Galin|1997|p=140}} those on higher rungs must pull up those on lower rungs. Thus Al•Ith can only move to Zone Two after she has pulled Ben Ata up to Zone Three.{{sfn|Galin|1997|p=140}}

==Reception==
Critic [[John Leonard (critic)|John Leonard]], in a review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', described ''The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five'' as "a remarkable recovery" from ''[[Shikasta]]'', which he called a "disaster".&lt;ref name=Leonard-Marriages/&gt; He said ''The Marriages'' works for him because it comes across as a fable, like an instructive [[Sufism|Sufi]] tale.&lt;ref name=Leonard-Marriages/&gt; Writing in ''[[HuffPost|HuffPost Culture]]'', [[University of Bristol]] academic Tom Sperlinger called the book "a legend" and listed it amongst his five recommended Lessing books that she as written since ''[[The Golden Notebook]]'' (1962).&lt;ref name=Sperlinger/&gt; Pierson found the book "enjoyable", despite the "dry and bookish sound[ing]" dialogue which felt like a [[translation]].&lt;ref name=Pierson/&gt; He added that readers familiar with Lessing's fortitude in ''The Golden Notebook'' may not appreciate her allegory in ''The Marriages''. While she is still "passionate, opinionated and outraged" here, Pierson said Lessing has withdrawn from writing about the real world and chosen to "soar unsteady currents of whimsy, dreams [and] mysticism".&lt;ref name=Pierson/&gt;

Several reviewers were impressed with the way Lessing tackled the subject of sexual politics in the book. Paul Gray remarked in a review in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, that contrary to appearances, ''The Marriages'' is not a feminist parable, but added that while Lessing often wrote about gender conflict, she has never done it "with more sweetness, compassion and wisdom" than she has in this novel.&lt;ref name=Gray-Marriages/&gt; Leonard commended Lessing for considering both sides of the gender divide and for being both critical and forgiving of Ben Ata and Al•Ith. Leonard said that Lessing had never written "a gentler book", adding, however, that her 1973 novel, ''Summer Before the Dark'', comes a close second.&lt;ref name=Leonard-Marriages/&gt; A reviewer in ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' also complemented Lessing on her handling of sexual conflict. While the review was critical of Lessing's prose style, and called her descriptions of the Zone Four war economy "a silly cartoon sketch", it said that "there is a&amp;nbsp;... generosity about this work not quite like anything she has done".&lt;ref name=Kirkus/&gt;

Reviewing the novel in the ''[[Roswell Daily Record]]'', American journalist [[Christopher Lehmann-Haupt]] called ''The Marriages'' one of Lessing's more accessible books because, in his opinion, her tendency to philosophise works better in fantasy than in other formats.&lt;ref name=Lehmann-Haupt/&gt; Author Lucille deView was more critical of book. Writing for ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', she complained that ''The Marriages'' is not as romantic a novel as it could have been.&lt;ref name=deView/&gt; She said that the fate of the book's mismatched lovers did not interest her and that their love came across as forced instead of passionate.&lt;ref name=deView/&gt; What could have been an emotionally charged romance became "a calculated intellectual game".&lt;ref name=deView/&gt; DeView also criticised Lessing's characters, saying that they "have the familiarity of childhood fairy tales with a little Walt Disney thrown in".&lt;ref name=deView/&gt;

==Adaptations==
''The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five'' was adapted for the opera in 1997 by composer [[Philip Glass]] with [[libretto|story-libretto]] by Lessing.&lt;ref name=opera-Marriages/&gt;&lt;ref name=DL-Marriages-opera/&gt; It was commissioned by the state of [[Baden-Württemberg]] and [[HeidelbergCement]] in Germany. The two-act opera for orchestra, chorus and soloists had its world premier in [[Heidelberg]], Germany in May 1997 under the direction of Thomas Kalb (music) and Birgitta Trommler (stage), with libretto translated into German by Saskia M. Wesnigk.&lt;ref name=DL-Marriages-opera/&gt; Lessing said that for the opera she expanded her allegory about gender relations: "There was room for two festivals: a woman's festival and a marriage festival. There are a lot of lyrics not in the novel."&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; A new production of the opera, directed by Harry Silverstein with music conducted by Robert Kaminskas, premiered for the first time in English in the United States in June 2001 at the [[Merle Reskin Theatre]] in Chicago, Illinois.&lt;ref name=DL-Marriages-opera/&gt;&lt;ref name=Covello/&gt;

The German premiere was not well received by the press, and ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' music critic John von Rhein found faults in the United States production.&lt;ref name=vonRhein/&gt; He said that the novel "falls flat as music theater", there is "no compelling dramatic narrative", and the music "drifts along innocuously".&lt;ref name=vonRhein/&gt; Von Rhein also complained that "score breaks no new stylistic ground, nor does it define the characters dramatically".&lt;ref name=vonRhein/&gt;

In 1988, Glass had adapted another book from the ''Canopus in Argos'' series, ''[[The Making of the Representative for Planet 8]]'', into a [[The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 (opera)|three-act opera]] with story-libretto by Lessing.&lt;ref name=opera-Making/&gt; It was commissioned by the [[Houston Grand Opera]], the [[English National Opera]], the Amsterdam Music Theatre and the [[Peabody Opera House|Kiel Opera House]].&lt;ref name=DL-Representative-opera2/&gt; The opera premiered in [[Houston]], Texas in July 1988,&lt;ref name=DL-Representative-opera1/&gt; and received a lukewarm review by ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' music critic [[John Rockwell]].&lt;ref name=Rockwell/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3889">'''The Millennium Breach''' was sponsored by the [[Eisenhower Foundation]] to mark the thirtieth anniversary of the [[Kerner Report]] on March 1, 1998. The Kerner Report was released by the [[Kerner Commission]], a committee established by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in 1968 to investigate the causes of the 1967 race riots in the United States and to provide recommendations for the future. The infamous passage of the Kerner Report found, "Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white—-separate and unequal."&lt;ref&gt;"'Our Nation Is Moving Toward Two Societies, One Black, One White—Separate and Unequal”: Excerpts from the Kerner Report." History Matters. http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6545/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Findings ==

The Millennium Breach was written by [[Fred R. Harris]], Lynn A. Curtis, and other Eisenhower trustees. The Breach presents the Foundation’s position on practical policy and how to replicate the grassroots non-profit, inner-city programs that have been effective since the release of the original Kerner Report in 1968. It targets private and public policymakers and inner-city community practitioners.

The breach documents the following trends since the release of the Kerner Report in 1968:

#From 1977 to 1988, the incomes of the [[Distribution of wealth|richest 1 percent]] in America increased by 120 percent and the incomes of the poorest fifth in America decreased by 10 percent
#In urban public schools in poor neighborhoods, more than two-thirds of children fail to reach even the "basic" level of national tests.
#During the 1980s, [[child poverty]] increased by over 20 percent, with racial minorities suffering disproportionately. In 1998, the child poverty rate in the United States was 4 times the average of Western European countries
#Over the 1980s and early 1990s, the U.S. tripled the number of prison cells and simultaneously reduced housing appropriations for the poor by over 80 percent.
#In the early 1990s, 1 of 4 young African-American men was in prison, on probation, or on parole. By the late 1990s, 1 of 3 young African-American men was in prison, on probation, or on parole.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Fred A., and Lynn A. Curtis. "The Millennium Breach." The Milton S. Eisenhower Foundation.Web. 23 Nov. 2009. &lt;http://www.eisenhowerfoundation.org/frames/main_frameMB.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recommendations==

The report recommended the adoption of national policies based on what the Eisenhower Foundation  believed to have been effective policies in education, employment, economic, development, race and criminal justice since the Kerner Commission. The following policies were recommended: 

#Fully fund the [[Head Start Program]] for all eligible children in pre-school
#Replicate effective school and housing desegregation and renewing [[affirmative action]] 
#Create a national nonprofit "Corporation for Youth Investment" that will provide boys-and-girls-club-type safe havens after school for kids 6 to 16 
#Reform public schools by restructuring academic programs; providing focused intervention for children with mental health problems; creating safe environments during the day and supportive nonprofit safe havens after school; increasing involvement of and assistance to inner city parents; reducing class size
#Reorder the budget in the "[[War on Drugs]]" from 70 percent enforcement and 30 percent prevention and treatment to 50/50.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Lynn A. et al. “The Millennium Breach.” The Milton Eisenhower Foundation. 1998 &lt;http://www.eisenhowerfoundation.org/docs/millennium.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3539">[[File:Slowcam.gif|thumb|Bill Slowsky in front of his computer, attempting to download a file using his [[DSL]] connection.]]

"'''The Slowskys'''" are a national television [[advertising]] campaign for [[Comcast]] Cable's Xfinity [[broadband]] [[Internet service provider|Internet service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comcast tortoises deal with sudden fame|url= http://adweek.blogs.com/adfreak/2006/03/comcast_tortois.html|work=Adfreak.com|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ads feature an [[animatronic]] turtle couple, Bill and Karolyn Slowsky. The ads are based on the idea that [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]], which Xfinity claims is slower than their service, is only fast enough for people who like things very slow. In the television ads, the two turtles are usually shown together explaining why they are so happy with DSL service, and that if they got Xfinity, it would be far too fast for them.

The characters were created by [[Goodby Silverstein &amp; Partners]] of [[San Francisco]], produced by RSA, puppeteered by [[Stan Winston]]. The campaign won the gold [[Effie Award]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://s3.amazonaws.com/effie_assets/2007/1897/2007_1897_pdf_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

TheSlowskys.com was a character [[blog]] on which everything slow is celebrated. Recently however, the blog was taken down and replaced by a peaceful, permanent [[Adobe Flash|flash]] [[GUI widget|widget]] that included their commercials. 

A knockoff of ''The Slowskys'' by Canadian cable provider [[Shaw Communications]] is called ''The Snailskis''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snailskis.com Shaw Communications Inc. - Snailskis: Say No To Slow with Shaw High-Speed Internet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824133838/http://snailskis.com/ |date=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian [[Andrew Donnelly]] is the voice of Bill Slowsky and actress (and former member of [[The Groundlings]]) [[Rachael Harris]] provides the voice for Karolyn. 

Later on, when the Slowsky fad reached its peak, the Slowskys Website created a fictional [[Political party|campaign]] in which the Slowsky couple traveled around their block in an [[Soapbox|old fashioned political circuit]]. On top of their vehicle, multiple [[Megaphone|bullhorns]] would amplify the Slowsky's voices so that people could hear them. The advertising video showed the Slowskys in the vehicle, and with Bill screaming "[[Campaign slogan|BE STILL WITH BILL!]]", much to Karolyn's annoyance, with "[[Hail to the Chief]]" playing in the background.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ARBsWcWA5s&amp;feature=channel_page BE STILL WITH BILL! - YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061129132050/http://www.theslowskys.com/slowparty/popmenu_sp.php?section=home The Slow Party - pop&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The party even offered membership cards&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061129132059/http://www.theslowskys.com/slowparty/membership_card.pdf Slow Party Membership (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; and requested slogans for their platform.T

'''Trade''' (also known as '''Chow'''&lt;ref name=chow&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=T72TJfZoywAC ''Definition of CHOW'']&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[gay slang]] term originating from [[Polari]], the coded language among English subcultures, and usually refers to the casual partner of a [[gay]] man or to the genre of such pairings.&lt;ref name=fantabulous&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=T72TJfZoywAC ''Fantabulosa: A Dictionary of Polari and Gay Slang''] by Paul Baker; Published by Continuum International Publishing Group, 2004; {{ISBN|0-8264-7343-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8264-7343-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Men falling in the category of "trade" are not gay-identified. Historically the motivations may at times include a desire for emotional fulfillment and admiration, but the term often refers to a straight man who partners with a gay man for economic benefit, either through a direct cash payment or through other, more subtle means (gifts, tuition payments, etc.).&lt;ref name=fantabulous/&gt; Trade originally referred to casual sex partners, regardless of sexuality as many gay and [[bisexual]] men were [[closeted]], but evolved to imply the gay partner is comparatively wealthy and the partner who is trade is economically deprived.&lt;ref name=fantabulous/&gt; Examples of this include wealthy Englishmen finding partners among deprived [[Cockney]]s in 1930s London; traveling men finding partners in places such as [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], and [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]] and locals picking up military personnel who are generally seen as being physically appealing and eager for extra income or benefits.&lt;ref name=fantabulous/&gt;

More modern usage has centered on any casual sexual encounter between men, and as an adjective to refer to any male considered masculine and/or sexually appealing.&lt;ref name="tradehistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peevish.co.uk/slang/t.htm |title=T in the dictionary of slang|publisher=A dictionary of slang |accessdate=2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, the terms ''trade'' and '''rough trade''' are treated as synonymous.  Often the attraction for the gay male partner is finding a dangerous, even thuggish, partner who may turn violent.  That is not to say that people necessarily desire to be physically hurt, but the danger of seeking a partner in a public park, restroom, or alleyway may be exciting.{{Fact|date=February 2017}} Another variation is in comparison to regular trade, rough trade is more likely to be working-class laborers with less education and more physical demands of their work, therefore with a body developed naturally rather than in a gym. They may have a less polished or cleancut style than an office worker or professional businessman.{{Fact|date=February 2017}}

==Royal favourites==
Royal favourites may at times have been trade.  The label could perhaps be applied to [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]], the favourite of [[James I of England]].

==Victorian and Edwardian eras==
While members of the African army and the [[Coldstream Guards]] in particular have long been regarded as coming from relatively elite backgrounds, guardsmen have also had a long and celebrated reputation as sexual partners to wealthier partners.  This has led to their figuring in plays by playwrights such [[Georges Feydeau]] and [[Ferenc Molnár]] as partners to adulterous society ladies, as well as to their performing as partners of men.    The novelist [[J. R. Ackerley]] wrote in his memoir ''My Father and Myself'' that he considered his guardsman father to have been the lover of an aristocrat for a long period of time before pursuing a wife and family, economically bettered in the end by the support he had received from his male partner.

==Risks==
In any relationship with rough trade, one takes a risk of becoming the object of violence. The 1975 murder of film director [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] has been attributed to Pasolini's dalliance with rough trade. Similar rumors circulated about the 1976 death of American actor [[Sal Mineo]] but statements from his killer cite a botched mugging and allegations otherwise are unsubstantiated. In 2005 German designer [[Rudolph Moshammer]] was killed by a 25-year-old Iraqi asylum-seeker with whom he had had sex but refused to pay for it.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, 21 November 2005, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4456524.stm Life for German designer's killer].

The '''Tubalar''' are an ethnic group native to the [[Altai Republic]] in Russia. 

According to the 2010 [[census]], there were 1,965 Tubalars in [[Russia]].

The villages with the highest population of Tubalars are [[Artybash]], [[Iogach]], [[Novotroitsk]], [[Tuloi]], [[Tondoshka]], [[Kebezen]], [[Ust-Pyzha]], [[Biyka]], [[Yailu]], [[Chuyka]], [[Torochak]], [[Paspaul]], [[Salganda]], [[Karakoksha]], [[Tunzha]], Krasnoselskoye, [[Uskuch]], [[Uimen]], and [[Karasuk, Altai Republic|Karasuk]]. 

The sacred tree of Tubalars is the [[Siberian Pine|cedar]], a symbol of the power, beauty and courage of taiga. The Holiday of Cedar is a celebration of this tree.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7152">The '''Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Act (1970)''' ("'''URA'''") was passed by the [[U.S. federal government]] in 1970. It was intended to ensure fair compensation and assistance for those whose property was compulsorily acquired for public use under "[[eminent domain]]" law. Similar provisions have been introduced by most of the individual [[U.S. state|States]].

== The federal government's response to eminent domain issues ==
This Act was a series of provisions codified in 1971 to ensure fair treatment of those displaced by federally funded programs, federally assisted programs or state and local agencies receiving federal funds. It was intended to make federal efforts to compensate these persons subjected to federal eminent domain efforts standard and uniform.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode42/usc_sup_01_42_10_61.html 42 U.S.C. § 4601, ''et seq'' and implemented through 49 C.F.R. Part 24]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act has since been amended at least three times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/realestate/uafnl99.htm|title=[Archived]  Final Rule Uniform Act Amendments - Archives - Real Estate - FHWA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) may fund some of these displacement projects. That Department lists the Act's essential objectives as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(1) to provide uniform, fair and equitable treatment of persons whose real property is acquired or who are displaced in connection with federally funded projects; (2) to ensure relocation assistance is provided to displaced persons to lessen the emotional and financial impact of displacement; (3) to ensure that no individual or family is displaced unless decent, safe and sanitary housing is available within the displaced person's financial means; (4) to help improve the housing conditions of displaced persons living in substandard housing; and (5) to encourage and expedite acquisition by agreement and without coercion.&lt;ref name="hud.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/library/relocation/|title=Real Estate Acquisition and Relocation/U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To be an eligible "displaced person," the Act sets forth factors for qualification:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If one moves from real property, or moves personal property from their real property as a result of a written notice of intent to acquire, the initiation of negotiations for, or the acquisition of, the real property, in whole or in part, due to a federally funded program or one with federal assistance; or on which such person is a residential tenant or conducts a small business, farm operation, or a business as a direct result of rehabilitation, demolition, or other displacing activity, as the lead agency may prescribe, under a program or project undertaken by a federal agency or with federal financial assistance in any case in which the head of the displacing agency determines that the displacement is permanent.&lt;ref&gt;42 U.S.C. § 4601(6)(A)(i)(I), et seq.; also see 27 Am. Jur. 2d Eminent Domain §862&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Once found to be eligible under the URA, such a displaced person can receive a range of benefits, or compensation types.  Importantly, instead of merely "market value," many property owners can obtain "replacement value" for their original property.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Stelle Garnett, ''[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=875412] The Neglected Political Economy of Eminent Domain,'' 105 Mich. L. Rev. 101, 121 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  Arguably, this goes above and beyond the Supreme Court's general standard that, under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]'s Just Compensation Clause, an owner need only be paid "fair market value" for their property.&lt;ref name=acres56454&gt;''United States v. 564.54 Acres of Land'', 441 U.S. 506 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

The URA endeavors to achieve this replacement value through providing the displacees with actual moving expenses, including mortgage and closing costs.  Businesses even get $10,000.00 in reestablishment expenses.&lt;ref name=acres56454 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;42 U.S.C. §§ 4622, 4625&lt;/ref&gt;  Displacees (not just owners, but lessees too) can also receive replacement advisory services to provide guidance in finding a new residence or business location.  Not only that, but if such replacement housing is not readily available, the displacing body is authorized to do what is necessary to get such housing—including excess payments and even purchasing, rehabilitating, or building a new dwelling for the dislocated owner.&lt;ref name=Garnett122&gt;Garnett, ''Neglected'', p.122 (citing to 42 U.S.C. § 4626 and 49 C.F.R. § 24.2, et seq.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsidizing displacees under the URA can be very beneficial in some cases, to the extent that the Act will provide an owner with an improved living situation.  There are provisions under the URA that may mandate furnishing a larger residence to the displacee.  Further, stipends are supposed to be limited to $22,500.00 for a homeowner to put toward buying a new home, yet there is evidence that more funds will be dispensed if necessary.&lt;ref name=Garnett122 /&gt;

The HUD website details all of the general requirements under the URA, including notice prerequisites, pre-negotiation appraisals, offers, payments prior to possession, etc.&lt;ref name="hud.gov"/&gt;

== The states' response to the URA ==
Most states have enacted similar legislation and require very similar relocation compensation for displacement by state-level activities.&lt;ref name=Garnett12324&gt;Garnett, ''Neglected'', p.123-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, the language of their statutes mirror that of the URA, though of late, some states have raised the amounts of compensation for dislocated businesses, with both goodwill and business value as traits of respective statutes.&lt;ref name=Garnett12324 /&gt;  [[Connecticut]]'s parallel version of the URA is one that attempts to compensate goodwill to non-chain businesses by allowing one to claim up to $10,000.00 of one's annual net income due to loss of a "substantial part of their patronage."&lt;ref&gt;See CGS §§ 267, ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Connecticut provides that a state agency can choose to utilize the compensation levels under the Federal URA in lieu of the state's act.  Its own relocation compensation requirements are lower than the URA's.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cga.ct.gov/2004/rpt/2004-R-0383.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that the Federal URA addresses interaction with the states regarding funding of projects and compensation of owners.  Any state agency receiving funding from a federal counterpart must demonstrate similar compensation efforts as that of the Act (albeit there is no indication that the state's benefits must be the same or higher), and that federal agency is prohibited from supplying the monies unless it has received the appropriate assurances from the state that fair and reasonable compensation is made for an owner's relocation.&lt;ref&gt;42 U.S.C. §§ 4627, 4630.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5299">[[Image:Kurdish Library J14 jeh.JPG|thumb|The [[Kurdish Heritage Foundation of America]] in [[Prospect Heights, Brooklyn]]]]
'''Vera Marion Beaudin Saeedpour''' (pronounced sah-EED-por; ''née'' '''Fine'''; March 27, 1930 – May 30, 2010) was an [[United States|American]] researcher and scholar who specialized in the study of [[Kurdish people]]. She founded the [[Kurdish Heritage Foundation of America]], the first library and museum in the United States dedicated to the subject. The foundation is located in the [[Prospect Heights, Brooklyn|Prospect Heights]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]] in [[New York City]].

==Early life==
Saeedpour was born Vera Marion Fine in [[Barre (town), Vermont|Barre, Vermont]] on March 27, 1930, to Jewish immigrants from Russia. Her father sold scrap metal and rags for a living.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/08/nyregion/08saeedpour.html|title=Vera B. Saeedpour, Scholar and Archivist of the Kurdish Culture, Dies at 80|last=Martin|first=Douglas|date=2010-06-07|accessdate=2010-06-08|publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

She grew up in the only Jewish family in the town.&lt;ref name=NYT1991&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/27/nyregion/about-new-york.html|title=About New York|last=Martin |first=Douglas|date=1991-04-27|accessdate=2010-06-09|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 17, she eloped with Marcel Beaudin and moved to [[Brooklyn]], where she worked at a bakery.&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt; She later spent eight years working as an assistant to [[New York City]] real estate developer [[Seymour Durst]].&lt;ref name=NYT1991/&gt; The couple had four sons, Marc, Paul, Adam and Jeb, and one daughter, Rebecca.&lt;ref name=NYTObit /&gt; Their marriage ended in divorce.

At age 40 she enrolled at the [[University of Vermont]], where she earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[sociology]] and a [[master's degree]] in [[philosophy]]. After her divorce from Beaudin, she enrolled at [[Teachers College, Columbia University]], where she earned a Ph.D. in 1976.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

While at Columbia, she moved to an apartment in [[Harlem]]. When her home was robbed, she called out to a man in an apartment across the street to ask if he had witnessed the [[burglary]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; That man, Homayoun Saeedpour, a 26-year-old Kurd from [[Sanandaj]], later rang her doorbell and offered cake and flowers.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; They married soon after.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

==Kurdish interest==
After her marriage to Saeedpour, Vera developed an interest in the plight of the Kurdish people. She was unfamiliar with the Kurds and their history when she first met her husband, but a decade later she felt she got to "know the Kurds better than any Westerner living". At one point, in need of a [[bone marrow transplant]] to treat his [[leukemia]], her husband's doctor refused to treat him, believing that he was [[Persian people|Persian]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ekurd.net/mismas/articles/misc2008/5/kurdsworldwide309.htm |title=NY: Kurdish Museum curator hopes her museum won't soon be history |date=2008-05-23 |accessdate=2010-06-09 |publisher=New York Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were married 5 years. Following her husband's death, in 1986, Saeedpour opened the [[Kurdish Heritage Foundation of America]] with a library in her [[Prospect Heights, Brooklyn]] brownstone. The museum, opened in 1988,&lt;ref name=NYTObit /&gt; was the first museum with a focus on the Kurds in the United States.&lt;ref name=NYT1999&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/realestate/12habi.html|title=The Home as Cultural Refuge|last=Baldwin|first=Deborah|date=2009-04-10|accessdate=2010-06-09|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library currently contains more than 2,000 texts in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] and other languages, as well as Kurdish artifacts, art, costumes and maps.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

For 15 years Saeedpour published a comprehensive and insightful quarterly on the middle east called Kurdish Life and edited the ''[[International Journal of Kurdish Studies]]'' as part of the Kurdish Program she established together with anthropologists at [[Harvard University]] and [[Cultural Survival]].&lt;ref name=BFPObit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/burlingtonfreepress/obituary.aspx?n=vera-beaudin-saeedpour&amp;pid=143332369|title=Obituary: Vera Beaudin Saeedpour|date=2010-06-05|accessdate=2010-06-09|publisher=[[The Burlington Free Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[Gulf War]], she organized a speaking tour for Kurdish politician [[Jalal Talabani]], later to become [[President of Iraq]].&lt;ref name=BFPObit/&gt;

==Death==
A resident of [[Fort Plain, New York]], Saeedpour died at age 80 of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on May 30, 2010, in [[Schenectady, New York]]. She is survived by her five children and two grandchildren.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

'''''Voisine v. United States''''', {{ussc|579|___|2016|el=no}}, was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held that the [[Domestic Violence Offender Gun Ban]] in U.S. federal law extends to those convicted of [[Recklessness (law)|reckless]] [[domestic violence]]. The court reached its judgment in a 6-2 majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetrace.org/2016/02/supreme-court-domestic-abusers-gun-ownership/|title=How Bad Does Domestic Violence Have to Be Before You Can’t Have a Gun?|date=2016-02-22|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/27/483714423/supreme-court-rules-domestic-abusers-can-lose-their-gun-ownership-rights|title=Supreme Court Rules Domestic Abusers Can Lose Their Gun-Ownership Rights|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/6/27/12040298/supreme-court-guns-voisine-v-united-states|title=The Supreme Court quietly handed gun control advocates a small victory|first=German|last=Lopez|date=27 June 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In 2009, an anonymous caller in [[Maine]] notified officials that a bald eagle had been shot in [[Kingman, Maine|Kingman]].&lt;ref name=Trace2016&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetrace.org/2016/02/supreme-court-domestic-abusers-gun-ownership/|title=How Bad Does Domestic Violence Have to Be Before You Can’t Have a Gun?|date=2016-02-22|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigating officers discovered the primary suspect, Stephen L. Voisine, was not legally permitted to possess a firearm. &lt;ref name="Trace2016" /&gt; His prior [[domestic violence]] conviction barred him from possessing a gun, resulting from the [[Domestic Violence Offender Gun Ban|Lautenberg Amendment]] signed into law in 1996.&lt;ref name=Trace2015&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetrace.org/2015/10/supreme-court-domestic-violence-misdemeanor-voisine-armstrong/|title=The Supreme Court Is Taking a Case That Could Let 'Unintentional' Domestic Abusers Own Guns|date=2015-10-30|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Voisine's interrogation, he admitted to shooting the eagle.  Subsequently, officials discovered his 28-year criminal record included 14 convictions for assault and domestic violence.  &lt;ref name="Trace2016" /&gt;

Voisine joined William Armstrong III to argue that their domestic violence convictions should not have precluded them from owning guns in the first place.&lt;ref name="Trace2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-lite-domestic-abusers-own-guns_us_56cf6822e4b0871f60eaa82b|title=Domestic Abusers Take Their Fight To Own Guns To The Supreme Court|last=Melissa Jeltsen Senior Reporter|first=The Huffington Post|date=2016-02-26|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They requested the Supreme Court to consider whether the Lautenberg Amendment was consititutional in the light of the precedent of ''[[DC v. Heller]]'' that the Second Amendment protected an individual right to bear arms. However, the court refused to consider this question, limiting itself to the question of whether the defendants' convictions for ''reckless'' acts of violence (as opposed to intentional ones) fell within the meaning of the Lautenberg Amendment.&lt;ref name="atlantic"&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/clarence-thomas-supreme-court/471582/&lt;/ref&gt;

During the hearing of this case, [[Clarence Thomas]] asked a question from the bench for the first time in 10 years.&lt;ref name="atlantic"/&gt;

== Opinion of the Court ==
[[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[Elena Kagan]] authored the 6-2 majority opinion. Justices [[Clarence Thomas]] and [[Sonia Sotomayor]] were the dissenters. The court held that [[Mens rea]] of recklessness was sufficient because the Lautenberg Amendment does not mention intentionality.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Voisine v. United States 579 US ___ at 7. &lt;/ref&gt; The court used an analogy of a thrown plate to illustrate the meaning of recklessness in an abuse context.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;The dissent disagreed with the majority holding that the term "reckless" is too broad under the Maine statute to pass constitutional muster for prohibition of firearms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9786">'''[[Economic development]]''' research has currently identified five phases, or "'''waves'''" of economic development practice. The differences between these waves are shaped by historical factors, the economic climate during historical periods, and leaders' response to these forces, which over time have created five strategies that differ from their predecessors. The five waves have all been designed to accomplish the same goal: to help entrepreneurs and businesses discover and expand markets for their services.&lt;ref name="OlberdingJulie"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olberding|first=Julie|title=Diving into the 'Third Waves' of Regional Governance and Economic Development Strategies: A Study of Regional Partnerships for Economic Development in U.S. Metropolitan Areas|journal=Economic Development Quarterly|date=August 2002|volume=16|issue=3|pages=251–272|doi=10.1177/089124240201600305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often these waves operate concurrently (thus, overlapping), or within a single economic development plan.&lt;ref name="Blakely and Leigh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blakely and Leigh|first=Edward J. and Nancey Green|title=Planning Local Economic Development|year=2010|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-6093-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First-wave economic development==

First-wave economic development, or the Growth Promotion Approach,&lt;ref name="BoothroydPeter"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boothroyd|first=Peter|author2=H. Craig Davis |title=Community Economic Development: Three Approaches|journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research|date=April 1993|volume=12|issue=3|pages=230–240|doi=10.1177/0739456x9301200307}}&lt;/ref&gt; is characterized by a focus on industrial recruitment through financial incentives such as tax [[Tax holiday|abatement]] and loans in order to lower costs associated with land, infrastructure, and labor.&lt;ref name="OlberdingJulie" /&gt; This method of business attraction was first used in the United States in the 1930s&lt;ref name="Blakely and Leigh" /&gt; as a response to the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="OlberdingJulie" /&gt; The economic development activities in this phase are sometimes called "smokestack-chasing."&lt;ref name="BlakelyBradshaw"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bradshaw|first=Ted|author2=Edward Blakely |title=What are Third-Wave Economic Development Strategies? From Incentives to Industrial Policy|journal=Economic Development Quarterly|date=August 1999|volume=13|issue=3|pages=229–244|doi=10.1177/089124249901300303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smokestack-Chasing===
This approach to economic development has its foundation in the "[[boosterism]]" of small towns in early North America. Typically in this wave, local economic developers focus attention on attracting one major employer to the region - be it a factory, mine, college, or prison. The first step in smokestack-chasing is to promote the location to the potential employer. Next, the economic developer seeks to improve the likelihood of the employer locating within the area by providing incentives (e.g., cheap land or labor, lax environmental regulations).
Detractors of this form of economic development have labeled it haphazard and suggested that smokestack-chasing is "likely to prove ineffective,"&lt;ref name="BoothroydPeter"/&gt; while others have said the result of smokestack-chasing is likely mixed, with increases in short-term job growth and per capita income as well as political support.&lt;ref name="TurnerRobert"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=Robert C.|title=The Political Economy of Gubernatorial Smokestack Chasing: Bad Policy and Bad Politics?|journal=State Politics and Policy Quarterly|date=Fall 2003|volume=3|issue=3|pages=270–293|doi=10.1177/153244000300300303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second-wave economic development==

Second-wave development strategies have their roots in the increase of worldwide competition, the descent of American manufacturing,&lt;ref name="EisingerPK"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eisinger|first=Peter K.|title=The rise of the entrepreneurial state: State and local economic development policy in the United States|year=1988|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-11874-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the critical evaluations of first-wave techniques of the late 1960s. These critiques labeled first-wave development as a [[zero-sum]] game between elites that instead of creating jobs merely transferred opportunities from one area to another at the benefit of "land-based" elites.&lt;ref name="MolotchHarvey"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Molotch|first=Harvey|title=The City as a Growth Machine: Toward a Political Economy of Place|journal=The American Journal of Sociology|date=September 1976|volume=82|issue=2|pages=309–332|doi=10.1086/226311}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first use of second-wave strategies was in the late 1960s&lt;ref name="FitzgeraldLeigh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fitzgerald|first=Joan|author2=Nancey Green Leigh |title=Economic Revitalization: Cases and Strategies for City and Suburb|year=2002|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-0-7619-1655-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and early 70s.&lt;ref name="OlberdingJulie" /&gt; In second-wave economic development, practitioners began to use strategies to retain and expand existing firms. They also included a focus on small business development&lt;ref name ="Blakely and Leigh" /&gt; through entrepreneurial tools like loans and enterprise zones.&lt;ref name="ClarkeSusan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Susan E.|author2=Gary L. Gaile |title=The Next Wave: Postfederal Local Economic Development Strategies|journal=Economic Development Quarterly|date=May 1992|volume=6|issue=2|pages=187–198|doi=10.1177/089124249200600207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third-wave economic development==

Third-wave was first identified in the early 1990s, and is marked by a declining emphasis on industrial attraction and retention and an increasing focus on strategies such as public-private partnerships, establishing regional networks,&lt;ref name="DodgeWilliam"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodge|first=William R.|title=Regional problem solving in the 1990s: Experimentation with local governance for the 21st Century|journal=National Civic Review|date=July–August 1990|volume=79|issue=4|pages=354–366|doi=10.1002/ncr.4100790408}}&lt;/ref&gt; developing industrial clusters, and increasing [[human capital]].&lt;ref name=BlakelyBradshaw /&gt;

Third-wave economic development focuses on “broadening of the foundation for effective economic development.”&lt;ref name=BlakelyBradshaw /&gt; It also stresses the importance of nurturing and advancing local and sectoral resources resulting in more complex economic development planning. States increasingly see themselves as key players in an evolving international economic competition – one that requires third-wave efforts to shift to an industry-wide perspective, and in many instances improves the socio-economic standing of its citizens&lt;ref name="OlberdingJulie" /&gt; through equity planning during the strategic economic development process.&lt;ref name="FitzgeraldLeigh" /&gt;

==Fourth-wave economic development==

This wave is also called sustainable economic development, and includes strategies that enhance environmental quality and [[self-sufficiency]].&lt;ref name="Blakely and Leigh" /&gt; In this context, [[sustainability]] refers to the process economic developers employ to determine a balanced approach to development that take into consideration "a full range of economic, environmental, and social characteristics that together comprise 'community,'"&lt;ref name="JepsonEdward"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jepson|first=Edward|author2=Anna Haines |title=Under Sustainability|journal=Economic Development Journal|date=Summer 2003|volume=2|issue=3|pages=45–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; or development that conciliates historically conflicting stakes: promotion of the economy, equitable distribution of economic growth, and the preservation of the natural environment.&lt;ref name="CampbellScott"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Scott|title=Green Cities, Growing Jobs, Just Cities? Urban Planning and the Contradictions of Sustainable Development|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|date=Summer 1996|volume=62|issue=3|pages=296–312|doi=10.1080/01944369608975696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable Local Economic Development (SLED)===
This wave has also been referred to as sustainable local economic development (SLED) because of the emphasis on local community. [[File:Pathways Out of Poverty Locations.jpg|thumb|Pathways Out of Poverty Locations]] Although there are various definitions of sustainability or SLED, most definitions share the following principles:&lt;ref name="NewbyLes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newby|first=Les|title=Sustainable local development: A new agenda for action?|journal=Local Environment|date=February 1999|volume=4|issue=1|pages=67–73|doi=10.1080/13549839908725582}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* quality of life (the connection between environment, economy, and social justice)
* fairness and equity
* participation and partnership
* environmental stewardship
* concerns for our future and the [[precautionary principle]]

An example of this approach applied to workforce training is the U.S. program [[Pathways out of Poverty]]. 

==Fifth-wave economic development==

The fifth-wave of economic development began in the 1990s with a two-fold interest in providing market solutions and regional strategies for development. The idea of a [[comparative advantage]] has been integral to the development of the fifth-wave. This wave has been marked by economic developers who work to emphasize unmet demand, function as a go-between with government to identify financing, and build partnerships for minority businesses between the public and private sector. The fifth-wave has led to concerns about displacement of impoverished populations due to [[gentrification]].&lt;ref name="Blakely and Leigh" /&gt;

[[File:George Lusk, President of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee.jpg|thumb|[[George Lusk]], President of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee.]]
The '''Whitechapel Vigilance Committee''' was a group of local volunteers who patrolled the streets of London's [[Whitechapel District (Metropolis)|Whitechapel District]] during the period of the [[Whitechapel murders]] of 1888. The volunteers patrolled mainly at night in the search of the murderer. The committee was set up by local businessmen who were concerned that the killings were affecting commerce in the area. It was led by [[George Lusk]], a local builder who was elected chairman during the committee's first meeting on 10 September 1888.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casebook.org/timeline.html | title=Jack the Ripper Timeline |publisher=[[Casebook: Jack the Ripper]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other committee members included Publican Joseph Aarons (treasurer), Mr. B. Harris (secretary),&lt;ref name=encyc&gt;Eddleston, John J. 'Jack the Ripper: An Encyclopedia' Published by ABC-CLIO (2001) pg 139 {{ISBN|1-57607-414-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Messrs. Barnett, Cohen, H. A. Harris, Hodgkins, Houghton, Isaacs, Jacobs, Laughton, Lindsay, Lord, Mitchell, Reeves, and Rogers. The ''Daily Telegraph'' reported on 5 October 1888 that the leading members of the committee were "drawn principally from the trading class, and include a builder, a cigar-manufacturer, a tailor, a picture-frame maker, a licensed victualler, and 'an actor.'"&lt;ref&gt;[[Daily Telegraph]] 5 October 1888&lt;/ref&gt; The latter was probably the entertainer Charles Reeves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casebook.org/notable_people/charles-reeves.html|title=Charles Reeves|publisher=Casebook: Jack the Ripper}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{synthesis-inline|date=January 2017}}

As chairman of the committee, Lusk's name appeared in the national newspapers and on posters in Whitechapel appealing for information concerning the identity of [[Jack the Ripper]] and complaining about the lack of a reward for such information from the government. Due to this publicity, Lusk received threatening letters through the post, allegedly from the murderer. Lusk is also mentioned in a letter dated 17 September 1888, reportedly discovered among archive materials in the late 20th century; however, most experts dismiss this as a modern hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casebook.org/ripper_letters/ |title=Ripper Letters |publisher=Casebook: Jack the Ripper}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:vigilancecommittee.jpg|thumb|left|300px|&lt;center&gt;Members of the Vigilance Committee examine the contents of the box sent to Lusk&lt;/center&gt;]]
On 30 September 1888 the committee members wrote to the government under [[Lord Salisbury]] in an attempt to persuade them to offer a reward for information leading to the apprehension of the killer. When the [[Home Secretary]] [[Henry Matthews, 1st Viscount Llandaff|Henry Matthews]] refused, the committee offered its own reward.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; The committee also employed two private detectives, Mr. Le Grand (or Grand) and Mr. J. H. Batchelor,&lt;ref name=encyc/&gt; to investigate the murders without the involvement of the local police.

The committee was unhappy with the level of protection that the community was receiving from the [[Metropolitan Police|police]], so it introduced its own system of local patrols, using hand-picked unemployed men to patrol the streets of the East End every evening from midnight to between four and five the next morning. Each of these men received a small wage from the Committee, and patrolled a particular beat, being armed with a [[police whistle]], a pair of [[galoshes]] and a strong stick. The committee itself met each evening at nine in The Crown, and once the public house closed at 12.30&amp;nbsp;am the committee members would inspect and join the patrols. These patrols were shortly to be joined by those of the Working Men's Vigilance Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Sugden Philip 'The Complete History of Jack the Ripper' Robinson, London (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[From Hell letter|"From Hell" letter]], which was sent with half of a human kidney, was posted to the committee's chairman George Lusk, who received it on 16 October 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casebook.org/press_reports/west_ham_guardian/881020.html |title=The East London Horrors. An Extraordinary Parcel |publisher=Casebook: Jack the Ripper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars&lt;ref&gt;Sugden Philip, Ibid &lt;citation #5&gt;, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; of the Jack the Ripper murders regard this letter as being the communication most likely to have been sent by the killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casebook.org/dissertations/dst-fromhellfact.html |title=From Hell: Fact or Fiction? |publisher=Casebook: Jack the Ripper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yale Model Government Europe''' ('''YMGE''') is a constituent program of the Yale International Relations Association (YIRA) at [[Yale University]]. Founded in 2010 under the auspices of the [[YIRA]] Independent Initiatives Program, YMGE is now a registered civic organization in the Czech Republic. The inaugural conference, YMGE 2011, took place in November 2011 in [[Prague]] hosting delegates from around the world. The second annual YMGE in 2012 drew 300 students from 25 countries spanning four continents. From 2013 onwards, YMGE has been hosted in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], and has now risen to about 500 attending delegates each year.

==Conference information==
YMGE was created in effort to reimagine the [[Model United Nations]] conference in a way that would be both more educational and more dynamic for the delegates. It combines the best of American and European conferences to create a hybrid format. The conference comprises two types of sessions. In standard committee debate, delegates will be placed in a parliament, European government, or supranational body to discuss important issues pertaining to the future of Europe and the international community. In crisis sessions, all committees will have to table their individual debates to come together and solve an issue that threatens the integrity of the international system and [[European integration]]. In preparation for the 2013 conference, Secretariat members have revised YMGE's mission, vision and values.

==Mission==
With the development of the mission to provide an innovative, collaborative, and inspiring environment in Europe for high school students to engage in high-level world politics, YMGE has changed its slogan to "Inspire, Collaborate, Innovate" so that it accurately reflects the qualities that the conference embraces.

==Committees structure==
The conference emulates the proceedings of the [[European Union]] and its nations constituent parliaments and ministries. Amongst the eighteen committees that will be simulated at the conference, there are typically five parliaments: European, British, French, German, and the [[United States Senate]]. The final thirteen committees are a sampling of national cabinets from across the [[European Union]]: the nine most populous members and the Czech Republic.

As in the real world, these committees form the framework of an integrated Europe: when something happens in the world that affects one committee, it affects all committees. Every committee will be kept abreast of developments in each of the others; if a new policy passed by the [[Belgian]] cabinet has repercussions in [[Denmark]], it will be up to the Danish [[minister (government)|ministers]] to react.
